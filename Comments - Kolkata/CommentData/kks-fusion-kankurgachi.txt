This place is a long time aquaintance, since a decade, they are keeping up, I would say, well. Since, its inception the taste bud has changed a lot for Kolkatans, I believe, they started in Calcutta. A nice place to hang out. Well decorated, stick to regular menus and drinks and, keep it there ;-)

Awesomely decorated and nice ambience, to talk about food, this is a family gathering place as well as teen hangout place also. The cleanliness is an add-on to that. However the spirit collection is really poor. That is very heartbreaking when you are in a hangout.

Just love the place for their service. The food is also very good. The cheese fondue, the Pindi chana and a lot of other stuff are just perfect. Also the alcohol prices are decent enough going by the ambiance and service.

Have not heard much about this place, a tired and hungry soul took me and my friend to this place for lunch on a weekday. The entrance is quite small and confusing, right then you see a vast and well planned restaurant seating area which was quite empty when we went. We were greeted and seated well, then we looked up the menu which has 3 sections fusion , Indian, Chinese. Few of the itms we chose was not available in the menu so we went for grilled chicken nachos, pan fried noodles in hot garlic sauce with chili chicken. Also they had only two beers available which was tuborg and kingfisher, we chose tuborg but got kingfisher as the former was not chilled (reason given by our server). The nachos arrived quite quick with a separate bowl of cheese sauce which was lumpy and not having the normal consistency, the presentation of nachos was horrible, the chips which they serve it seemed to be like home fried and tasted like "namkeen" which is what I don't expect to get as a nacho. The noodles and chicken was huge in quantity but it was better than the starter, glad that we could enjoy it. 
I had to head for the washroom which is in the back side and I regret going there as it was so bad that made me sick. Anyhow the servers were helpful and service was very good with all the personal attention but they seemed to be quite sad, with no smile on face! 
The whole experience doesn't make me feel go to this place again while im in Kolkata.

Visited on the 9th this restaurant is pretty big and has a live kitchen view. The service was slow I didn't see many staff. Though the food was good, and overall experience was nice. But yes the ambiance wasn't upto the mark. Overall a great experience.

Situated at Inox Swabhumi this restaurant is tough one to find. Been there a couple of times and have liked the food. In my recent visit i ordered a Fusion kebab platter (basically chello kebab) and cheese fondue which was great and their alcohol stock is excellent now, which was a big issue in the past. Though the ambiance and decor has gone down fairly with time and looks old. But I'm sure they will improve because it seems like they are renovating. All in all a great visit

Don't bother looking at the menu. Ask them what's available. Most of the things aren't. And it's not about a few items, it's like "No prawn dishes available", "No desserts available".
It's a pity since they started so well. The quality of food is also very average now.

Went there on dashami night after a movie at swabhumi..look and feel is nice..ordered a bit of liquor and crispy baby corn,pepper fish,masala kulcha and mutton rogan josh.food is average at its best..baby corn was good and tasty..probably they dont use pure bhetki for fish pepper fry..masala kulcha was a big let down as it was not at all soft and only a thin layer of masala inside it. Rogan josh nothng special average in taste.pieces of mutton were good but should have been more soft and less bony..overall an average experience but staff behaviour was good and friendly.people with a liking for sea food can visit here..

This restaurant is located right next to the Inox Swabhumi ticket counter . The interiors are spread over a large area , with tables that are meant for family outings . The staff here is less in number , which is why the service is tad slow. Most of the cocktails on the menu were unavailable, and even the available beer was domestic. The food isn't so bad. The non veg chilli garlic noodles they serve taste more like meifoon and is very light on the stomach. The ambiance is very homely , with mostly a family crowd, and warmly lit interiors.

The worst experience i hv ever had with any restaurant.  Most of the items in menu was unavailable. Only paying attention to large group ignoring single  couple . I would request please don't visit this place to get humiliated. U may get attention only when u r in large group where they can be assured of large amount of bill

I've been putting off writing this review because there's quite a lot that went wrong with my dining experience here. Firstly, they didn't have most of the drinks listed on their menu (the only vodka they had was white mischief or maybe it was magic moments). Anyway I really wouldn't mind that if the food compensated but it fell really short. We ordered the fish satay for starters and literally the only thing you could taste was salt. It certainly didn't help that it took them an hour (yes, a full hour) to get it. The Greek Style Fish (fish baked with spinach) was fairly well made though it took over an hour to arrive. The last thing we ordered was something called the Rotole di Pollo Al Romeo which is supposed to be served with a rich brown sauce. After waiting for close to an hour and a half it came with cream cheese sauce. When I complained they simply drained the cream cheese and substituted it for a bland brown sauce. On the whole, my experience here was appalling largely due to the terrible service.

A family friendly restaurant, situated in the ground floor of Swabhumi,just beside The Beer Republic.
First things first,was disappointed on their service, had ordered Dum Subzi Handi but they served Mix Veg instead and on letting them know about it they didn't have the minimum courtesy to ask for a replacement. Up next they added mineral water bottle charges which we had overlooked while checking the bill and found out afterwards. 
Further more, Their breads aren't upto the mark. 
Quantity of chicken is very less.
Only positives are the Quality of food and the ambiance of the restaurant.

Hopeless food, smelly air, clumsy ambience and uninterested staff defines kk. We order Indian main course dinner after watching movies in Inox 89 and they took forever to bring it. The paneer butter Masala was watery with chunks of paneer. The dal was tasteless. Upon complaining they accepted to wave the paneer charges. But my dinner was ruined. Beside a large group also complain and left disgusted. Actually they should be prosecuted for serving such sub standard food.

Okay now this is a place which I am gonna visit multiple times in future. This place was suggested to me by a friend. Honestly, I never expected the food here to be sooo good!
For starters we took Malai Paneer Tikka which cost just 175 bucks, had 5-6 sufficiently large cubes of paneer roasted on tandoor having a flavour of cheese and ground cashew. Also, Tacos..which was absolutely heavenly! 4 pieces of Tacos stuffed with chicken and topped with cheese served with tangy and spicy sauce! This one came for Rs. 350.
Then we ordered some drinks. Teachers which came for 350, Mojito (a cocktail having the perfect blend of Bacardi, mint leaves, soda and lime), and Pink Lady (a mocktail having litchi, pineapple and strawberry juices blended together with ice cubes).
For main course we had 3 dishes:
¬§ Yellow corn paneer malai kofta with naan - tasted amazing!
¬§ Pollo Cantina - Chicken grilled in spicy mexican sauces served with mexican rice.
¬§ Escalope of Chicken - Chicken breasts cooked in cheese sauce served with white sauce pasta.
Ambience was perfect for every kind of group..be it family, friends or couples.
Kk's fusion has really amazed me. Looking forward to visiting this place again and again and trying out their other delicacies!

Located just below Inox Swabhumi, this is quite a good place to hang out with friends and family. Went in with friends for couple of beers. The interior of the place is not what you would expect from just seeing the entrance. Once inside the whole ambience changes to a classy restaurant. Even though it may seem too pricey, but is suprisingly affordable. The service is also very good. The quality of food is good but can improve. Final verdict: WILL REVISIT.

Confused with the mixed reviews and ratings of this place, we took a chance and I'm glad to say we did. 
First of all this has a huge area that is well decorated and posh. Chandeliers, dim lighting, an open kitchen just add to the charm. 
Since we were in for lunch the place wasn't crowded.
The menu design could have been made better and in form of a diary. Just didn't go with the place. 
Now about the food. Plenty of options to choose from.
We ordered a * Long Island Iced  tea*  and one '* Salty Dog'* in drinks. The flavors were strong and had a generous kick of alcohol. Loved it. 
Since there was just two of us, we thought that a huge kebab platter would go great with the drinks. Thus we had the #Fusion Kebab Platter. It had 20pieces of kebabs. 4 pieces of each variety. Chicken and mutton. Lovely! 
We were too full to treat ourselves to anything else. ‚Ä¶üòÑ

We visited this place during our last kolkata visit. Initially our plan was different but as that place had a huge waiting and it was already late so our parents who already visited the place recommended this place@. 
The initial look and feel was not that great and we were quite sceptical of our decision. But it grew on is over sometime. Initially the crew was more busy in serving the regulars, or people who ordered for liquor. But then finally after a bit of noise, they attended us well. Initially during the waiting time, they served us DIY - masala muri or 'jhaalmuri' as we call in kolkata .Then came the ordered food. Their way of serving is unique and innovative. At the end of our dining experience - they even treated us with 'on the house' paan.
Food is good. 
Ambience - fine.
Crew can be trained.

Bongs and their strong connect to fishes especially hilsa is quite well known. Its monsoon and its pouring hilsa all over. Many restaurants are trying to culminate the rich taste of Hilsa with Mediterranean delicacies, and the fusion indeed results into a wonderful potion. An experimental restro being the KKs fusion, where chef owner Mr. Pradip Rozario is trying to recreate the magic of Hisas with his creative culinary innovations. The multi-cuisine fare is fusion, unique and original, covering the whole gamut of Indian, Continental, Italian, Mexican and Oriental cuisines.
            

Location: Located just below the Inox Swabhumi off EM Bypass. 

Decor and Ambience : The decor was aesthetically done with a well spread seating area both on the ground floor and the floor above. An interactive kitchen and a dance floor greets you as you enter. Dimly lit, the wooden furniture well laid, it gives you a feeling of a duplex European bar.

Staffs :The owner Mr. Pradip Rozario himself is a wonder man. His team is worthy of all appraisal. Extremely amicable and courteous. 

Food : to begin with the food journey, we were thr following hilsa delicacies were served to us-

1.oven baked hilsa with salsa formaggi.
                                          ...

Mindblowing Fusion Hilsa Festival at KK's Fusion..!

                An internationally renowned chef, Mr. Pradip Rozario‚Äôs yet another culinary attempt to blend in the flavors of the esthetic Hilsa, a fish which is so dear and near to us, by imparting in flavors from different cuisines, like Italian, Mexican and others. Located besides Inox Swabhumi, this place is an easy find. Huge and spacious, KK‚Äôs fusion, as its name suggests is renowned for the fusion delicacies it serves and innovates for its patrons from time to time. With the onset of Monsoon, its yet another effort by the world renowned Chef to create something magical. Team #panchphoron was cordially invited over for a food tasting event, where four unique and never-before-seen preparations of Hilsa were served, much to our pleasure and delight.

A very classy restaurant with awesome food n gud service. The continental n the Mexican section is the best part of the restaurant. A must try is the cheese funduo.Every time we visit the restaurant the interior as well the food menu is changed. A very gud restaurant with full value for money.

Honestly I did not understand why they have added a fusion to their name, the range of menu it offers doesn't have any trace of farsighted fusion attempt. The tandoori murgh was very dull, homemade ones are even better. Though they alcohol service was decent. And their indian main course dishes were somewhat decent. Ambience was good. And the service was so so. If you want to have moderately decent north indian cuisine this place might deserve a couple of visits.

Chef Pradip Rozario's K K's fusion is a contemporary style restaurant. Went there for lunch and was amazed to find it quite empty but nonetheless was pleased with the ambience. Surrounded by dark and lime green walls with hints of cream and wood trimmings, the decor was on point. That set the mood for the upcoming lunch. The menu had both Indian and Continental cuisine. We ordered for butter naan, mixed vegetable curry, peas pulao, chicken reshmi masala, and corn and paneer kofta. The food was fresh and served hot along with sides. But I was expecting a little spark from a restaurant of this repertoire. The staff was good and courteous. We also ordered two cocktails(Pina colada and screwdriver) along with beer. They were up to the mark. The prices are quite efficient.

Have been there for lunch..place is mostly empty. Decor is decent and not very elaborate. However it is spacious. The staff is courteous and helpful. Food was served quickly and was delicious. Each portion was also large and sufficient. It is not expensive also. Music is a bit let down and I feel that the playlist needs to be refreshed. Overall a great experience.

Awesome food and mocktails. .. we ordered Greek Style Fish which was awesome and cheesy, fish was soft and flavors blended quite well, not too spicy.. pasta was spicy and basil leaves made it unique and it was simply yum...  mocktails were refreshing... loved the mouth freshener shot(mix of pan and ice cream may b) served at the end which has taken this restaurant to a new level, an unique thing to try out.

My 2 friends and I visited this place for some fun time and chit chat. The place is large. Hospitality is good. And the food is great in taste. What else could we want to spend some good time? 
We ordered Greek Style Fish, Basil Mileage of Vegetable Pasta with Mocktails- Rainbow, Florida and Ginger Lemon on The Rox. Only the Rainbow and Florida didn't meet our expectation. Otherwise the Greek Style Fish was just outstanding. At the end, they brought some Mouth freshener which was mixed with crushed Paan, that was really unique in taste.
Overall I would like to recommend this place to my friends.

The monsoons are here and time to relish the one and only fish of all fishes hilsa, whenever the word come to my mind Experimental Foods, i only think about this restaurant, Chef Mr Rozario always comes with some lovely ideas to make some extraordinary dishes, this is the season of hilsa, basically I like to eat fishes but I don't love to eat them, every restaurant comes with their different menu and price as well as some awesome thalis too keeping in mind Bengali's affection for ilish fish, he prepared a few dishes for us which was look wise amazing and taste wise superb, lip-smacking. Though hilsa have some nano sharp bones which i found very annoying during eating time, I had a bad experience when i was a little kid, but still if it is taste good, smell good then no compromise i will defiantly go for this without any hesitation.

Bengalis are joyful group of people. And somehow this is the season the Bengali foodies are a bit more joyful than the rest of the times. Because this is the time of the king of fishes, the Hilsa. Obviously the exorbitant prices pose a hindrance to having it on daily basis ( else I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôd be a Hilsa for breakfast, Hilsa for lunch, Hilsa for evening snacks!! ). I‚Äôm for that matter, not a huge fan of fishes. Hilsa is a major no no for me ( I really have a fear for those microscopic bones ). However majority of the people I know will kill ( okay that‚Äôs a bit exaggeration or is it? ) for a good piece of Ilish.

Went there for a office party. we went there at 6 pm and we were the first customer of that evening. we got seated in the upstairs, it was almost a private area, we enjoyed that privacy for the next 2 hours. Their fusion kabab is fantastic, really liked that. main course items were so so. ordered kabuli naan, chicken taka tak, mutton lankeshwari hot pot, mutton roast etc, main course items were of dhaba style, nothing special but still good. Though the waiters were polite but the Service was on the slower side. drinks were little costly. overall had a decent experience.

I remember going to kks fusion quite often almost a decade ago. The first time I visited the place was with my father to celebrate my birthday. The restaurant was launched a few days before that so it had that feel and vibe in it. The decor was aesthetically done with a well spread seating area both on the ground floor and the floor above. My father was a bit apprehensive before visiting the restaurant but the visit was not a disappointment. We ordered for cheese fondue first. It was delicious. The hot cheese and then dipping the toasts in it was nothing less than sin. We ordered Indian for the main course. The food was excellent and the quantity was equally good.   I tried the chicken tandoori and mutton biryani on a later visit. This time also I was not let down. The service was prompt and professional.

Location is fantastic and instead of turning into low service and full of stag, this place could be better. Food is more of munchies and dhaba style food which will not fulfill your craving. Interiors has also become shabby and need a refurbish look. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place as its not at all for family crowd and food also not that great.

If u want a quiet space to just be alone with ur thoughts or have a adda with jhal muri with ur old mates from school or college or life this is THE place. It stole mah heart with a bowl of jhal muri with Bud Lights. Jhal muri with beer?wow what a tangy combi! I didn't even ask for it. Plus they gave a platter full things to nibble with my drinks. Peanuts n Aamchur n Beetnoon ie Rock salt n ginger soaked in vinegar. And I haven't even got to the any starters. If u wanna avoid the over noisy neighbour then this is THE place. The staff r wow too.
            

The Baked Ilish was soft and juicy. I was in a hurry but the staff got it done in time. He went overboard trying to give me a piece of Ilish of my choice. I was so touched by the warmth of this typical Bengali hospitality or athiteota. :-) Keep up this good work guys.

Never had such a bad experience till date. I with a friend visited this place on Saturday evening. We entered and stood there for a while because nobody was bothered to even ask us for the table. After being placed, We ordered for a LIT and a pinacolada and veg fusion kabab platter. Both the drinks being very shabby. We were waiting for the food which took 25 mins to come. And then arrived a fusion of nonveg kababs. On complaining the man said sorry, if you wait for 2mins we can bring you the veg ones. The last order took 25mins and this one will take just 2mins? We had to leave disappointed and starving.

The standard of food has taken a nose dive and it leaves me surprised considering the owner Mr. Rozario himself attends to this place. The food at their other outlet ~ Kurry Klub is still good.
Please improve the food offered. I would definitely visit again due my fondness for this place and hope the management by then would do something to restore the taste in the food served.

Any foodie of the city¬† who has tried fusion food at least once, is surely acquainted with the name of this restaurant. Brainchild of Mr Pradip Rosario, the Chef & owner of the place, this restaurant was the first one to introduce the concept of fusion food to the city. The other outlet under chef Rosario's guidance , Mio Amore, Mani Square is another renowned one.
Recently Mr. Rosario invited PanchPhoron over for the launch of special menu to celebrate the Bengali occasion of Jamai Sasthi. Though it might seem what does a fusion food restaurant has to do with Jaamaishasthi the items launched were surely pretty innovative & tasty.

Located prominently just beside INOX swabhumi. The decor is minimalist & is not very lit,just enough to see the color of your food. It was late at night & Chinese food was off the menu so we stick to normal food.We ordered, full tandoori chicken,Masala kulcha, Chicken reshmi masala, chicken bharta & Murgh tak-a-tak. I was very pleasantly surprised with both the quality & quantity of food!! The tandoori chicken is a must try. The chicken was very soft & so well-spiced!! I'm not too fond of bharta but was very surprised with the preparation,as in, the chicken in the bharta was not shredded but diced into very small boneless dice-like pieces & tasted too good to say the least!! The very well known dishes like reshmi masala & tak-a-tak also tastes wonderfull!! Lastly came a pan-like mixture which was served in shot glasses. For people who like pan or the flavour of pan would love this one. This one was served on the house & there was no mention of it on the menu. It definitely scored a star with us!! Looking forward to more visits here!!

It was a relishing Dinner date at K.K.'s Fusion with my significant one on the occasion of our "Ten years of Togetherness". I opted for Fusion food for the first time and totally loved it. We had Enchilladas for appetizer, and it was so savoury. The amount was quite substantial; and though sharing the dish, I feared I would hardly have space for the main course.The accompanying drinks were Pink Lady and Fresh Lime Soda. Next, served were the Mexican dish Pollo Cantina and Chicken Roulade... and they were no less delightful, the flavour of the blend of ingredients was perfect. The ambience of the restaurant is very pleasant and the etiquette of the staff is praiseworthy. But the cherry on the top was Chef Rosario's special treat for us - Caramel Custard. I was full, yet I enjoyed every bit of the delicious dessert. Overall, it was an experience worth cherishing.

Do not visit this place if you want to want to come out with some dignity. We went there and asked the waiter if there are any happy hours offer. He told us that there's a 15 percent discount on food. Now we order food and drinks. And at around 7:30 we ask for the bill. When the bill arrives we see that no discount is provided. So we asked the waiter about it. And he tells us to read the bill and on doing so we find that it says happy hours is from 12pm to 6 pm. Now the waiter tells me that according to then you are eligible for the happy hours as per the time of your bill and not your time of order. NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A RULE. Then he starts behaving rudely and finally he decides to give us the discount as if he his giving us our freedom. But we refuse to take it. Not tasted much food here but the ones we tasted were ok sorts. But no amount of food can compensate the bad behaviour. AVOID AND SPEND YOUR MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE.

As suggested by my brother, we went for dinner to this place to try out something new. We ordered Chicken Tacos and Chicken meat ball soup, the former was absolutely delicious and the soup was soothing to the tastebuds. For the main course, Paneer butter masala and Mushroom masala with Naan and Laccha paratha were ordered. We thoroughly enjoyed Spaghetti Bolognese even. To add the cherry on the cake, Chef Rosario himself served us dessert (sorry for forgetting the name of the dish). Overall a delightful experience.

Few days back, we were invited to KK‚Äôs fusion and genuinely I was overwhelmed. I have heard of chef Pradip Rozario and his legendary cooking skills. In fact he was the one who introduced fusion food to Kolkaa with his debut venture Kurry Club. Then after KK‚Äôs Fusion came in and Mio Amore (Mani Square).  Being very near to our place, I‚Äôve been to this place many a times but this time, it was bound to be different with Chef Rozario around.

This place is just beside INOX swabhumi and near to Hyatt E M Bypass. Parking is not a problem and hence a big relief. A meal for two should cost 1500/- for 2 here with a drink each.

The Cocktails were fine and lived up to the expectation.

¬† 

We were served the dishes and the service, I must say, was top notch.

Presentation of the grilled prawn was interesting, it came on a boat shaped dish with banana leaf on top and corianer chutney in side. It was a regular affair. The prawn, though, was fresh and nicely grilled.

And, then chef was sharing his experience of serving Muri (puffed rice) with aloo dum, served in a stainless steel tiffin carrier, to his outlet and as a demo, we were served one portion of the same. It a strange feeling to see the humble muri being honored in such a way, in fact unusual. But at the end of the day, it was muri with aloo dum‚Ä¶. And it was just that.

¬† ¬†

The pan fried fish was a savior. The fish was fresh with just the right amount of crispiness and the Russian salad brilliantly finished. I frankly couldn‚Äôt find any relevance for the boiled egg to be there, but then, an boiled egg always is loved.

¬† 

Chicken Roulade, frankly was a let-down. It was cold and the light, watery brown grav served with it, didn‚Äôt quite go well with it- Neither did the kulchas (Frankly, I was little confused what to do with them)‚Ä¶..

¬† 

Lamb chop as tender and well cooked, but I didn‚Äôt have rogun josh was such light, home-styled gravy earlier and so was a little surprised. Chorchori was done with exotic vegetables but I personally didn‚Äôt quite found any connection between it and the lamb, the mexican biryani served with it was damn good off course.

¬† 

The whole experience, frankly, was not so bad until the dessert came. The sugar mould with chhenar payesh looked great but a huge flow of fiery liquor spoiled the whole thing. From the photography perspective, it was brilliant, but gastronomically‚Ä¶. Errrrr‚Ä¶..
¬†

Overall, we had a mixed feeling about the whole evening. It was a mixed bag of surprise element, good food and well-err-ahem-type-of food.
¬†The parting gift was a huge pack of sweets from one reputed shop and was definitely a feel good factor.¬†

Shall I come again ? Definitely yes, but I‚Äôll probably stick to the trusted items in the menu card.

Chef Pradip Rozario, owner and chef at KK's Fusion, treads the rather brave culinary path in an otherwise saturated food demography, concocting innovative combinations of food constantly. This winter, he has come up with a special version of Indo European fusion food for Valentine's Day (already up on Zomato) whose pre-release sampling session I had an opportunity to attend, thanks to an invitation from

When fusion food comes in mind, and ur in Kolkata, Mr.Rozario's name tops the list. So thot of trying out, when was given a chance to. To begin with i¬† was invited to taste Indo European Fusion Culinary.¬† 
We were served a combination of cocktails and mocktails which includes Mango Mojito, Blue hawain, Daiquri Stawberry and Cool mint.
Then began the 5 course meal which included Grilled prawns in skewers marinated with coriander chutney, fenugreek scented Pan fried fish on Russian salad, chicken roulade torkari with seasonal greens and sundried tomato kulcha,¬† lamb chop rogan josh, served with vegetable chorchori and Mexican Riceand finally desserts - crunchy sugar cup filled with chanar payas and citric fruits
The first the grilled prawns¬† deserves a special mention and if u r a prawn lover one must surely try it. then there was fenugreek scented Pan fried fish on Russian salad which was total fusion item which consisted of bhrtki fish, duck egg and with salad, and i guess lots cream and maayonise. the next two items were above average. i saved my appetite for the dessert. To my knowledge, this is one of the best way ever, i have been a dessert. by none other than Chef Rozario himself. it was a complete fusion which consisted of lot of things like crunchy sugar cup filled chaaner balls, spirit, chocolate sauce to name a few with citrus fritus.
Before i finish i must mention the fine use of designed utensils for presentation, the interiors which creates a perfect ambiance for fine dinning experience.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: In the complete guidence and control of the Celebrity  Chef Mr. Rozario this awesome place falls near the 89cinemas just beside Swabhumi. The look is very simple from the main gate until you go in and find something eye warming. If you are looking for some quality and variety of dishes for your lunch and dinner then Mr. Rozario has some delicious stuffs for you here in the menu waiting.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE: As told earlier when you move in you'll see some fine dining with classy interiors. The sitting arrangement has been perfect allowing you to choose from so many tables in the big ambiance. You find a side bar for the mocktails and the cocktails and in the middle you'll find a small boofe stall. Lightings of the resto is decent with fine painting colorful walls as well as colorful sofas. Looking at the furniture so its been made up of wooden finish. Service of the staff is nice. They are attentive and listens to you porperly. Thou in between they started loosing their momentum when we have to call them by raising the hands.

FOOD: This place has some outstanding and variant varieties of cuisine to offer you. It was Invitation from one of the finest PR's in the city Pritha Sarkar so the menu decided as we dined in. We were greeted with the mocktails and cocktails.  

Beginning with the Mocktail in form of Mango Majito and Deep blue sea aka Bule lagoon and a fresh lime soda as a last inclusion. 

Mango Majito was very nice. It conatined good amount of flavour of Mango and pieces of mango coming through the straw as well. It was Tangy and tasty.¬†

Deep Blue sea(if i remember the name correctly) was quite hard in the beginnig but later it was going well.

Followed by the Starter we had the Grilled Prawn in skewer with coriander Chutney which was perfectly done. Prawn was well mixed and stuffed with the coriander chutney and the mix of both can be felt well on the tounge.

Secondly we had the Fenugreek Scented Pan fried Fish on Russian salad which was something very new to me. A combination of Bhetki fish peices surrounded and decorated with the Russian salad with the Boiled Egg on the top including mayonise, that was something different as a fusion food. 

Thirdly we had the Chicken Roulade Torkari with seasonal greens and sundried tomato kulcha. To be honest this dish put me in some disappointments, The chicken pieces were extremely dry and cold and the Kulcha was a bit hard. The decoration was nice by putting a small glass with gravy filled in it.

Fourth was the Lamb chop rogan josh served with vegetables, which was pretty well made. The mutton pieces were tasty and juicy, breaking easily. Taste was homely and it contained all green vegetables as well. And at the back we were served with rice coming straight from the cooker itself which was hot and tasty. This was a nice pick.

And finally Landed on the Dessert which was extremely eye catching for every person sitting on the table. The preparation of the Dessert was very impressive putting the dessert in the plate putting some vodka in and burning it up with the fire That really attracted everyone's attention. I was unable to complete it as m a non alchoholic. The taste was fine enough and sweet.

Lastly finishing up with the Fresh lime soda which was pretty average to me.

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality was very good. The Owner chef have maintained it from the kitchen itself so i found no compromise with the quality of food and the quanity was pretty decent as well. Prices for two are Pinched Rs.1500/-.

CONCLUSION: With the Valentine week is around the corner so they have some good and impressive plannings for the guest couples. I wish The team KK's Fusions a very good luck for the next week & ahead and appreciate their effort. Cheers.

NOTE: the review is based on my personal Visit and experience to this place.

For those who are not aware, this is Chef Rozario's outlet. Hence, when you walk in put your expectations right up there.
Very easy to locate as it is just beside 89Cinemas, Swabhumi.
It is not possible to make a couple of trips and review about KK's Fusion. Simple reason being the variety of cuisines and food that are in offer. I have made 5-6 trips before deciding to put this down.
Start with the Chicken Ponde and get amazed by it. Anything roasted is brilliantly done. Sizzlers are good, but I expect a little more. Try chef's special whenever you walk in. I have had good success almost all the times.
Avoid pork, instead grab on the desserts. They are really sweet.
KK's Fusion is one in a hundred for sure.

I've visited this place twice.but few years ago.So my review would be based on my past visit.
So my first visit was on my sister's bday.
The ambience was pretty awesome.
The seating was good and we were like 17 people in total and were seated comfortably.
Coming up with food.I would rate this place 5/5.
From starters to drinks..to main course.Everything was excellent.
We ordered mocktails , pasta , cheeese fondue and also had chinese.
Everything was so wow.No complaints!
My second visit was a sudden plan after movie.
We had paneer tikki , noodles and manchurian.
I loved it .

Literally had to edit the entire review after enjoying the meal today. Totally contented with this place. Was so happy after completing the dinner.
It's a family based restaurant with bar. Very homely ambience and interiors pretty decent. Waiters are very obsequious and helpful. Service is quick and management is really amazing.
Well it's actually known for its Continental which is really worth trying. Today,I tried North Indian and to my surprise I was absolutely appeased with the food.
Tried Achari Paneer Tika which was the best outta all the choices we made. The masala was so evenly spread and properly made. Paneer was absolute fresh and succulent. It was marinated really well. Loved it. One must definitely try it.
For Main Course,
Dal makhni which was again really very nice. Balanced really well with spices and butter.
ALU do Pyaza which made me super happy. Really loved the way they had prepared. Baby potatoes tossed in spices and thick tangy gravy with sauted onions.
Breads were decent enough.
All in all,had an amazing experience and pocket friendly.
Suggestion would be to change the collection of music.

The owner Pradeep is a friend and have been frequenting his establishment on Sarat Bose Road called Kurry Klub for decades.

Have been to KKs fusion a couple of times earlier and attended a fairly large dinner tonight.

This guy is some kind of a genius in fusion food,presentation and creating an atmosphere.

Had an array of items like roast chicken,chilli prawns,lamb and everything was above average.

But I still like the original KK better

Guess now a days you have think about dry day because dry day is increasing day by day so we went to restaurant on 25 September on id or something so for me and brother it was very bad experience  though fusion food we ordered were great though little pricey guess that why i am a typical bengali .But food was very innovative. But the waiter not good not pouring our glass with water when it was empty guess we ordered regular water that why they were treating us like that who knows and last after ordering food it takes almost 30 minutes for them to serve the food guess what sabar ka faal mitha hota hai i guess

We ordered various things. ... cheese foundee must try..... fusion kebab - an very like chello kebab. ... Mexican grilled chicken -very tasty though little spicy..... at last complementary mouth freshener liquid made of smashed 'pan' - just a cherry at top. .... little deduction of 0.5 star due to less variety of drinks. ... They should have flavored drinks also. ... but at both time the visit was very satisfied. ...

Went there with my office colleagues today. Excellent spread of various continental food. Started with their special chimney soup, then went on to garlic bread, cheese pasta, not to forget the mouth watering grilled fish with special lemon butter sauce. Main course was awesome. Had Veg Pulao and Chicken Lasaniya and ended with ice cream and an unique paan shot. Overall an different experience.

This restaurant is sort of hidden beside swabhumi..not easily noticed at a go..however they do serve up some decent enough continental food as well as north indian spreads..However last time I have been here found that the prices have soared up while the quality and taste have deteriorated greatly..We ended up on a dry day..so had to settle with mocktails..had a mocktail called florida which was not properly mixed..tasted way to sweet to my likeness..then ordered:
Fish n Chips: Well it tasted merely like a bengali fish fry,no where near to what fish n chips meant to be..and priced at 425/- for two fillets of fish..that way too high for a place like this..
Chicken Special Kebab: It tasted nice..spicy..proper marination and seasoning..
The service was prompt..and the garnishing of the dishes is quite unique..however when it comes to food they need to amend big time..completely dissappointed we left without our main course..
Even for this the total cheque comes to around 1150/- which is quite extravagant..
Food: 2.5/5
Pricin: 1/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 2.5/5

From the days when Swabhumi Inox was called 89 Cinemas, this joint has come a long way... Though, not in the right direction, if you ask me... But as Zomato is a thing of today, so will be my rating... OK this is gonna be a contrasting review. By that I mean I'll be comparing culinary parameters on two timescapes, KK's in 2005 vs KK's in 2015, so here goes...

Ambiance: 8/10(2005); 8/10(2015) [Classy/Elegant]
Food: 8.5/10(2005); 7/10(2015)
Service: 8/10(2005); 6/10(2015)
Pricing: 7/10(2005); 5/10(2015)

Dishes worth mention: I normally look forward to the seafood section here, that's a no-brainer... Try it, you won't regret...

That being said, I genuinely miss the old KK's experience, every time I watch a movie at Swabhumi...

This restaurant at swabhumi is a good place to head to.... I specially like the rajma masala , the corn paneer malai kofta.... Tandoori chicken is fair.... Generally not crowded... the presentation of the dishes is good .... Also i like that instead of the finger bowl, they have luke warm water that the waiter pours while u wash ur hands.... Give it a try.

I had purchased a Groupon voucher. I went to KK's Fusion on the 30th Jan to redeem it. I was told they didn't have anything except chicken on offer. I wanted to redeem it on another day when they'd have more choices and left the place.

Thereafter, I have been calling up KK's Fusion consistently in order to inquire about the availability of non-veg menu options. On all 3 days, till 2nd Jan I was told that they didn't have anything except chicken. This is unbelievable, unethical and illegitimate.

Finally, on the 3rd Jan they told they had fish. I went to the restaurant only to be told that had imposed certain restrictions (which wasn't mentioned in the fine print of the voucher). They told they would serve fish ONLY in starters (not in the main course, or the baked dish). I didn't make a fuss about it. However, for the desert they told that they had only 2 choices (and weren't carrying the rest). This is totally fraudulent. I have been completely deceived and am left with an awful impression, not mention the food, which by all standards, was pretty ordinary.

recommended by one of my friends, decided to spend the last night of 2014 at this restaurant with a nice dinner and some drinks. located right beside swabhumi, parking is available right in front of the restaurant. interior decor was well organized with enough lights and full of balloons for the festive season.

we straight away ordered appetizers - fusion kebabs and chicken satay. also ordered alcohol of our choice. it took them 20 mins to bring our appetizers to table, and by that time our first peg was already finished. nevertheless, the kebabs and the satay was very tasty, not too spicy though.

coming to main course, we ordered:

gamberoni picanti - a prawn item in mild red sauce, tasted great, prawns were of medium size and very well prepared, served with pasta and cheese
pesce cartoccio - basa fillet prepared in red sauce, filet was not well grilled, a bit raw, complained about that with no effect
pollo cantina - grilled chicken in mexican sauce, served with spicy rice, was good

in dessert, we ordered crepe fantasia - vanilla ice cream wrapped in thin pancake with chocolate sauce sprinkled over it. the pancake was a bit hard, appeared just like a roti.

when the bill came, we noticed a 600ml bottle of thumbs up was charged rs.125 plus tax where it costs merely rs.30 incl tax at any outside cold drinks shop. we complained about that and straight away offered around 7% discount on the total amount which covered the cost of two bottles - nice :)

our total bill came as around rs. 4700 for 4 adults and 2 children, food included 6 pegs of alcohol of our choice plus a mocktail and a cocktail. price was a bit on the higher side but the food quality was good. quantity per serving was decent too. the staff here were very courteous and helpful, explained the food in details when we inquired before placing order. i will surely visit again to try out some more unconventional preparations that they have in their menu.

The K.K.s CON - Fusion !

After the exhilarating victory at I.I.H.M. RIGOLO FEST, I and my co-participant Manikuntala went to enjoy the fruits of our effort. We planned and dropped in at the K.Ks. Fusion this Wednesday. We were quite early to this restaurant cum bar. Though it's not a very new venture but the interior still retains a signature charm. 

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† A Not So Welcoming Welcome Drink

We were served with a rainbow mocktail first, it appeared very lucrative and once I sipped it gave a tingling sensation in my tongue, the glass composed of  strawberry crush at the bottom, followed by pineapple juice and finally the top layer, that was composed with soda and blue caracao. 

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†The Kick Start With Starter

¬†Then after a very long wait they finally served us with their signature starter. The Fusion Kebab, The outlook of the platter was equally sexy as it's taste, the platter comprised of five types of kebab that included Reshmi Kebab, Barbequed Chicken, Chicken Tikka Kebab, Chatpata Aloo Kebab and the Fish Teherani. This was the star dish of the noon, each and every kebab was done to perfection, the Reshmi Kebab - It was well smokey and was the finest with it's extremely delicate flavours, the Barbequed Chicken - Full of flavour, a perfect dryness was in it, it gave kick of sweetness with every bite. The Chatpata Aloo - was not that happening I found it as a drier version of bengali classic dish Aloo Dum, the Chicken Tikka Kebab - was perfectly spiced, it was succulent and gave a flavour burst in the mouth. The Fish Teherani - Was extremely delectable and soft it's mild flavours just wooed us. The accompaniment served along was a Cilantro Sauce Or chutney, as we call, it was a good blend of curd and cilantro, this version is more found in the Middle Eastern Countries. There was a bit of julienne onion, they served us Nasigoreng  Rice topped with a Sunny Side-Up, the rice wasn't a Nasigoreng at all. This plate was a impeccable culmination of  fusion food plating. But they didn't serve exactly what their menu card was promising, Anyway I liked whatever they served and their style of serving.

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† The Main Course Over-Do

The Main Course was Camarones Acapulquenos - A Mexican delicacy by it's true sense, Medium sized prawns cooked in spicy tomato sauce and vegetables served with Mexican rice. The dish was quite loud and had imposing  flavours of tomato, the rice served was well enough, but the prawns were not juicy and the vegetables were over cooked, it was served with a bit of grated cheese on top and the plating was not so alluring .

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† The Non-Delighting  Dessert

For the Dessert we were served Ice -cream wrapped by crepes and glazed with chocolate sauce. This was the terror part of the meal, the crepes were not freshly made, the taste was dry and the chocolate sauce was awfully slurry.

Pros  &  Cons

The starter faired well but the scale of satisfaction dropped soon after the main course was tasted and it lowered more on the arrival of the Dessert. The staffs were quite confused, when the bar-tender was asked about the mocktail he was quite clueless, the manager was lacking modesty, and the bar was a dry bar, the ambience and interior was good but their were obstacles killing the setting ! The menu card promised something else than what was exactly served, the starter came to our table after almost 30 Minutes, that's too much when you are already having your gastronomical sense tickled. Their was a lot of NOs from the Menu.

Bar - Available.

Value For Money - NO, quite pricey !! In relation to was served.

KK's fusion is located right beside Swabhumi, and although the location isn't the greatest, it takes nothing away from the food itself. The food is good, service is good and the d√©cor doesn't bother the average eye. The only setback may have been the acoustics inside the restaurant.I first tried KK's fusion for the fondue, both the Swiss and the Hungarian. The latter turned out to be a better bet. The food is good enough for the average night out and it does the joint justice. There isn't much more to say apart from that it's worth the visit.¬†

Thanks for reading, and pardon me for any grammatical mistakes I may have made. :)

Experienced worst service in my life, the food served was very cold & after complaining about it we got no response from the waiters for another 15 mins.

This place was in my pending list of restaurants for a really long time. I passed by it numerous times and always thought of visting it as ive heard a lot of good words from others.
So finally one fine day i had nothing to do and so i called up my gf and two other friends and made a plan to dine out. This place was chosen by me and i was very excited that finally im visiting kk's fusion.
All of us met in front of tge restaurant and entered it was around 7.45pm or so. Now maybe we were a bit before time for a dinner as the place was completely empty and we were the only customers at that point of time. We were guided to a table near the t.v. and we sat down with so many waiters around us. One of our friend was in a hurry to get back home for some work so we didnt wasted any time and straight away ordered for starters it was 2 chrispy chilli babycorn and 2 stuffed grilled potatoes (i forgot the name) along with soft drinks. Next were 2 vegitable au gratin.
Then the wait started. Waiting....waiting...waiting and some more waiting. After almost 30 minutes came the babycorn. On luking at them i wondered whats this..?? Such small serving portions i mean normally you would expect that one plate would be enough for 2 people and applying the same logic we ordered 2 plates..but the portions sereved would somehow satisfy only one person... Nevertheless the waiter served us and we took the first bite and again a disaster. A restaurant of such fame cannot even make such a simple basic and common dish. I mean even a road side eatery can make better crispy chilli babycorn. Now i asked the waiter about the other dishes as we had ordered and he told just wait 5 minutes but the next dish arrived after another 20 minutes. Again only one potato cut in two pieces in one plate...how it tasted is another tragic story. One more thing both the above dishes were not served hot. Next came the vegitable au gratin (again late) now this thing was the only dish which lived up to our expectations it was nicely baked and was served hot. By that time we had lost our enthusiasm. We called someone for the main course and ordered half heartedly for some indian dishes...it was kadhai paneer, daal makhani, and breads.
Now this time they crossed all the limits... We were waiting and waiting and whenever we asked that why is it taking so long for the food to come when there is no rush at the restaurant we didnt get any reply. And even the stewards and other waiters were ignoring us we were fedup and decided to get up and leave. By that time a person who looked like the manager came and we told that we are leaving as we dont have so much time and patience to wait. But he promissed us that the food will arrive in 5 minutes please wait for some time. Then the main course came...again the portions were too small. Paneer had lots of dhaniya and i was feeling like im having paneer cooked only with dhaniya seeds and served as it is, the daal makhani was also nothing to write about and again the same thing the food was cold .We just did the formality of having whatever was served. And i was in a very bad mood...when your charging so much and its a costly restaurant and even if you cant do justice to the food atleast fix it up with some prompt and warm service. When leaving the manager asked us if everything was okay and i lost it and straight away said that this is not a restaurant its a circus going on with some clowns. Instead of apologizing He just smiled and said you come next time well serve you better on which a friend yelled that who is coming next time this was the last time we came here. We can cook far better than this at our home...stupid place spoilt all our mood.
I have given it 1 point as there is no negative point in zomato.

KK's fusion is located outside Swabhumi, and has good parking facilities on the opposite side of the road. The place has a decent ambiance, and a see through kitchen. So you have the opportunity to taste the art and watch the artists in action. The prices over here follow a kind of curve that is witnessed in a lot of bar cum restaurants. They have high priced starters but average priced main dishes, for obvious reasons. The food is good, but unfortunately nothing on which I can spend a few more pixels. They have some strange inclusions in their menu like paneer fried rice (seriously!) which I would like to try, and more so, because it is priced more than its chicken counterpart.

Have been passing this restaurant for years but eventually paid a visit only couple of weeks back, thanks to the place staying open till midnight. Located beside Swabhumi, it is a huge restaurant with large cushioned seats and big tables. I missed some two seaters but thats passable. The staff wer polite, warm but lacked mannerisms. They handed us 2-3 sets of menu with overriding items between them that too priced differently which should be looked into with utmost urgency. 

Coming to food, we tried their north indian main course that was good. The dal makhani was awesome, paneer preparations were good. Loved the butter naans but gilafi naan was a shocker. It was topped with tomato sauce that was a disaster and i wish they do not serve it at all. The biryani was average. The prices were reasonable but servings were freakingly huge. Consider the servings, i would say the food was great value for money.

There were certain unique practices, unlike other place in Kolkata like provision of separate small tables beside for stocking all the side dishes, vegetables that are being served. Although i have seen this in other cities but what really surprised me was that they dont give finger bowls but empty bowls on which you could wash your hands while staff pours warm water from a jar.

I felt it was a mixed experience but dint regret for the money spent here at all.

Excellent food, wonderful bouquet of menu.good varity of liquor as well.you will get bombay duck to octopus. 
Their kebab platter is also excellent. Just beside Swabhumi and inox (previously 89 cinemas) a good place to hang out.
If you love cheese then this could be the right place.I had a dish where the fish had to be dipped in cheese (forgot the name of the dish) .The cheese was served in a separate pot which was put on a oven.The fish and the bread had to be dipped in that warm cheese . yummy, it's fabulous.

If you spend money, spend it in style. KK's Fusion is great fine dining with high prices but amazing amazing food. Driinks are also great here. I came her with cousins and ate cheesy delights and drank vodka with pineapple juice and I absolutely enjoyed the night. We spend INR 3500 for three people three years back and with four glasses of booze so you can guess that it is a good place. Especially if you like cheese, this is your place.

The decor is also very nice as is evident in the pictures provided here. The waiters have good behavior and the overall smell of food in the place is great. The only downside in my opinion is the parking space which is going to test your patience as well as driving skills.

Been there few years back, the rating and review is honestly based on the last visit I had to this eatery. Not sure how this place is doing these days. But when we had been there it was really exhilarating for us to start off with such a striking experimental menu! Had some baby corn in the starter and moved on straight to some continental chicken dish and a chicken dish in Mexican sauce that came along with rice, the taste of these dishes were really good. But as a matter of fact, I haven't tried the sea food out here and would like to come back to have a try. The place has a relaxed ambiance and  nice interiors.

After catching an evening movie at Inox, we thought of trying out KK's Fusion as my wife was craving for continental food. When we entered the restaurant, we were immediately struck by the openness inside, with lot of space and scattered seating arrangement. They also have a nice bar with sit-n-sip arrangement.

Firstly, the staff seems to be very experienced and the way they treated us was a sign of maturity in the business. We were made felt at home. They were very courteous in suggesting as dishes and describing any items we asked.

Their menu list is a gem. It is very much experimental (we focused on the conti section!) with very interesting combinations. My wife went ga ga over the menu card! (when ur wife becomes so excited, there has to have some mettle....a man's thinking ;) )

We had the famous kebab platter as the starter. The food came in a little hanger with skewers of kebabs. It included fish, 2 chickens, lamb, potato. It included a plate of nasi goring with poach. When I took the first bite of the fish kebab, I was floored. It was soooo soft and creamy and tasty! They seemed to put some tenderizer in the fish which made it yummy when it was hot. However, the same kebab was pretty bad when it lost its temperature. 
The chicken reshmi kebab was standard, and tasty. The other chicken kebab was made in an oriental style, possibly with wine and w-sauce. It was smoky and bitter.
I loved the lamb. The potato kebab was soft and full of butter, and gave a welcome break between its non veg counterparts.

We were so full with the platter (including the rice), that we could not order the main course! We intend to return shortly to gorge into the awesome looking continental menu.

This place is located just below Swabhumi,on the E M Bypass and is somehow always busy,perhaps because of the location. 
Decent place,I thought. Infact I really liked the way it is spread out. The small bar as soon as you enter,the huge dining area and a flight of stairs leading you to a kind of mezzanine area which is better for people who want to eat in peace,away from the noise downstairs. Thoughtfully designed,simple,yet impressive. 

Food was decent too. Though I didn't try tooo many items on the menu ,I really liked the paneer tikka. It was a three layed paneer with red,white and green gravy between the different slices. Really tasty ! The paneer ,though extremely soft,was not crumbling,and was perfect !

Overall,I nice experience :)

This is the place which served me chilli garlic schezuan octopus, florentine and cheese stuffed greek style fish, mint lime ginger crushed cooler on the rocks, tandoori stuffed whole baby bekti ( also good at tangerine) and tangra, spicy lamb, one of the best fondue, and yes, spicy, clear hot pot indian style which is even better than yeu chew at ganesh avenue. Starting from fusion risotto to fusion kebab platter (huge one and divinely delicious and great looking when served). One of my top noch favourite across kolkata. Pradip Rozario knows how, what and when and again with what. Pradip simply rocks. An artist in the gastronomic world, and honestly I like this one rather than his other kurry clubs at kakurgachi or deshapriyo park or his goanese and mio amore in mani square. Not very perfect in ambience, specially not in a very good and safe street during night, but, as long as food and cullinary creativity and knowledge concerns, this is a place every foodie should visit at least once. My sincere thanks and lots and lotsa admiration for Pradip. Let the Iron Chef live and rule.

This place has been around for a while and had a certain novelty to it when it opened which made it fairly popular ....located bang next to INOX  Swabhumi only helped in its popularity. The place and the food has slid a bit in recent times but its still a decent place to grab a bite if your in the area. There is a decent mix of cuisine .... the cheese fondue is still one of the better ones in the city and my must order dish here ..... beside that the kebab platter and a few items from the mexican and italian menu are not bad.

The ambiance is soothing and comfortable. The food is also pretty good. Although my experience of the staff was not very good as we had to wait for a long time to place our orders and the waiters would not easily respond when called. My favourite item is the non-veg cheese foundue that they serve here...it is probably one of the best in the city. The serve break cubes as well as fried fish with it and it is absolutely delicious!

Great things are found in places you least expect them and that is how an old friend and me stumbled upon this amazing place. Nestled in one corner just adjacent to INOX Swabhumi, we decided to try this out for dinner one night after a movie. The interior is nicely made up, with just the proper amount of lighting and space. The staff are friendly and nice. Moving on to the food, as has been mentioned earlier we found the Kebab Platter to be very good. We also tried the Mexican Tacos which were good too. For the main course, we tried the fish which was nicely cooked and tasty. Vanilla Ice Cream with Chocolate Sauce for dessert was the standrad. A good place. One of the most appealing things of this place is their bar counter. This was the first place in Kolkata I ever saw a bar counter(yes this was a few years back) and that was an instant positive.

The place still serves a decent ambience and brilliant live music but other than food I was dissapointed with everything remaining.. The staff were slow food ordered took time and the kabuli naan was served as a sugar chapati.. When asked they said it's the best they can offer.. The place was busy so I ordered else and satisfied my hunger then the billing and the hand wash took a tedious 35 mins with multiple reminders which included requesting to the staffs.. 

Inspite being a vivid regular it is painful to be served this way..

This place used to be a favorite of mine a few years back. I used to eat here fairly often: the food was pretty novel for its time and surprisingly well priced. 

Now, though, it's a different story. The place is a mere shadow of its past self. The food isn't downright terrible, but it isn't nearly as good as it used to be. In my last visit here a few weeks back, for example, the lasagna- which used to be lovely back in the day - was a total mess. A part of that was attributable to the fact that instead of being served in a proper rectangular lasagna dish (as it was earlier). It was served in a cheap, circular plastic bowl, which made it impossible for it to be eaten properly. This is another issue with the place: the presentation of the food has seen a pretty sharp decline. 

The interiors seem to have taken a beating over the years: the sofas on the mezzanine floor were torn up in places and had pen marks all over them. The walls looked old, with the paint flaking off. The place needs a fair few repairs. 

The owners definitely need to pull their socks up if they wish to stay abreast of the competition in Kolkata's culinary scene today.

I had been here years ago

The food is a bit experimental, and well cooked. If you are very particular of how the item ordered should taste you may be in for a bit of a shock / surpise. 

The fusion food is made for the mughlai loving indian palate.
