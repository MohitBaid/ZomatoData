Would you go to a restaurant named Bihar ? I wouldn't. But just after my first visit here, I think now I regret not coming here before. After Nizam's moghul gardens betrayal, this probably is first in the queue of best beef serving restaurants of esplanade and adjacent areas.

Located almost next to Nizam, this underrated restaurant, after the make over, now looks more promising than before, with more than 15 tables and a few cabins if you want more privacy while you gulp.

The staffs here are experienced and aged, they'd serve you water as soon as you arrive and expect you to order right then, tell them you want a minute to decide and they'll not be coming to you anytime soon unless you call them at least thrice. The kebabs here arrive sooner than all the other dishes, so, no need to order starters separately.

Coming to the food, they have wide variety of beef dishes available under their menu. We ordered beef kebabs, beef korma, beef rezala, parathas and naans.
The beef kebab was undoubtedly the best of the lot, spicy, tender beef pieces with onions and capsicum, the servings are bigger than average portioned and tasted heavenly.
The beef korma was served with a boiled egg on the top, the two small pieces however, after having such large portioned beef kebab almost for the same price, seemed a little less. The beef rezala was a bit bland, I think that is what it meant to on our kebabs and korma attacked taste buds. Both of them tasted fine.
The naans here just need a special mention, the big fluffy white naans, I wish a few nearby better and more famous restaurants could serve naans half as good as them.

I'll be back here as soon as I can if only for more of their kebabs.

So my 2018 food trotting kicked off from this tiny tucked in outlet in the busy area of new market just beside Nizams for a quick tummy muncher. The place has been renovated recently & now it looks much cleaner & hygeinic. The sitting is very spacious & is always full of crowd who comes to satiate their beef cravings. Since my friend & I were looking something light we took the following:-

1. Beef roll - A medium sized kolkata styled roll with chunky succulent beef meat tucked inside. The roll had no fancy stuffing with sauce or too much onions. However the shallow fried paratha was very poor. The paratha was doughy & hence it was way too chewy to gulp. A roll with poor quality of paratha wrapping is always a major turn off.

2. Beef kebab - A plateful of delicious meat tossed in dalda,onions & chopped chillies. The meat was too tender that it melted in our mouths with every spoonful. This was sheer foodgasmic. This is a must try item if you visit UP Bihar. 

3. Firni - I am very shrewd person when it comes to firnis since i have had some great ones & equally some poor ones. So being quitr apprehensive, i decided to try the firni over here. To my dismay i was not quite happy with the texture since the firni was gooey/slimey & lacked the grainy texture. The taste was okayish at best.

The pocket pinch was certainly in the lower side with per head cost being Rs 115 per head. They dont charge GST.

One of the best eateries in town to have Mughlai food, especially Beef items. There's an old world charm to the place and is essentially a non-AC environment. So keep your expectations minimal with regards to the decor.

This was my first visit to this somewhat legendary outlet located at New Market. It's very easy to find as it is located right next to another powerhouse, Nizam's. The ambianve is lovely and the staff are courteous and well behaved. The service is also prompt, the food that we having been delivered to us in less than five minutes. I had ordered the egg beef biriyani, a plate of salad, chicken masala, the famed khiri kebab and firni. The biriyani was very decent, the amount that was put out for 80 bucks being quite satisfactory. I like an egg in my biriyani, and that made this all the more special. It was not too oily, and the meat was very palatable, although it could have been slightly softer. The chicken masala was very, erm, spicy, and the chicken was pretty good and soft. The real standout, though, was the ubiquitously known khiri kebab. It was an absolute feast for the taste buds as it was done perfectly. It had been sautéed beautifully and the mixture of spices it had been engulfed in was delectable. With a dash of lemon, it tasted otherworldly. The firni, however, was quite disappointing. It was rather disappointing, flat and not sweet enough in my opinion. I have had much better firni elsewhere. I am going to go here again, for sure, and probably have two plates of khiri kebab all by myself. They also leave green chillies on your table,  and that's fantastic. It remains the standout of what was a largely enjoyable, inexpensive and delightful first eating out in 2018.

As Nizam had stopped selling beef this restaurant has gained their popularity for beef items. Tried their beef bhuna, beef biryani, khiri kebabs and tandoori roti. Beef bhuna was little bit spicy whereas biryani was too good and one must try their khiri kebabs.
All the items were good both in quality and quantity. The food was value for money.

Priced Rs 44 the chicken roll was exactly 6 inches long. Midget roll! But the chicken pieces were succulent and fresh. The paratha was oily . I decided not to finish it till the end and just ate the chicken pieces. It is a better place for beef dishes as the beef roll order by my brother was of better size and most of the customers were trying khiri kebabs etc. 
It is just beside Nizam's. Hence if you are thinking about chicken go for Nizam's.

This is an old joint operating for last maybe some 70+ years and a steady favorite of many. And, before entering, be aware (or happy) ... because it serves some excellent bovine stuff. 

Like your old spouse gets a new makeover once a while, a complete interior renovation has been done recently and it's not that old, shabby joint now. Luckily, the food and pricing is still the same and has not changed.

While you browse through the menu card, order for a portion of their khiri kebab (kebabs made from cow's udder or mammary glad and is a bit chewy in nature) and beef sheekh kebab for moral support. In around 5 min and even before the glass of water reaches your table, they'll be served - piping hot and straight from the sheekh. Squeeze the lemon on them and thank the cook for sauteing them with just the right amount of onion, capsicum and green chilly. Now, while you put a spoonful inside mouth, start checking the menu card.

Are you still confused on what to order ? Good, go for their beef roll and you can thank me later. The parantha is quite thick and soft and complements the crunchy kebab. Take a bite of the green chilly served along with and again start browsing the menu card. 

If you're still hungry, go for their beef biryani. It may not have the finesse of Zam Zam, but not bad on any given day.

Budget restaurant for people who are open to eating beef. I ordered beef biryani which was light and mildly aromatic (nothing mindblowing though but certainly to suit your palate). The ambience though is not it's strong point. It seems a bit shabby in the first look and not impressively hygienic. I would not recommend it for a family getaway. But altogether certainly a place to visit if you're in mood for a good meal on a tight budget.

This is located at New Market Area just beside Nizam's. Very easy to locate henceforth. The place is quite shabby and if you are looking for a restaurant experience, then this is not the place. But if you want to have some nice biriyani, especially beef biriyani then this is the place to be. We orderd beef biriyani, chicken rezala and chicken korma. The biriyani was pretty good. The chicken rezala was amazing. The chicken korma wasn't bad either. The quantity was decent and it didnot create a hole in our pockets either.

A very good Pocket friendly restaurant. Located just beside Nizam's. Its a very very old restro. So ambience is like 1990's. We had Chicken tandoori which was good. Then had Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Masala(2 pieces). Both were good. Biriyani was like mainstream Biriyani of any restro. Chicken was good, not great. Then had coolfi😂😂😂. All in all... A good Competition to Saima.

I usually visit this eatery during winters because in summer it can get really stuffy.. Our random christmas shopping ends here.. The food is served best if you go between 12 to 3pm.. After that some items become unavailable or are tampered with.. (the beef bhuna becomes beef jhol as they add water to the gravy later during the day) the food tastes better than a lot of other famous establishments.. The beef items are worth trying.. The khiri roll will have u screaming for more.. And their beef kabab has that lingering smokey flavour.. Their tandoori roti are really large n soft.. I also love their beef tikia and beef chaap... I never tried their chicken items.. Not interested...
I must mention the beef biryani.. Really well done..
In winters its the best place out there fr some piping hot nihari with crispy freshly fried daal puri..this is not to be missed..

This buzzy place is for those who are up for grabbing some quality red meat delicacies (read beef) and that too in a tight budget. Situated just beside the Nizam at New Market area, the Khiri Kebab of this place will remain one of the must have beef preparation in the whole Kolkata. We ran short of superlatives once our tastebuds graced it. Alongside with that, the firni of this place was surprisingly awesome! Only negative was that they don't serve the firni cold like other mughlai food joints. 
We had also ordered Beef Biryani, Beef Bhuna, Beef Korma. Each one of the preparation was good if not excellent but not quite at the same level with the earlier mentioned two, especially the Khiri Kebab. 
The ambience is a huge drawback, but that won't matter if it's the food that only matters to you. 
Do visit if you are a lover of preparations made out of bovine meat.
Happy eating folks. :)

A shabby and a bit gloomy place, this is tucked in the ever busy New Market area, right beside Nizam, and has been serving some decent food for a long time. This place might look as a strict no when it comes to hygiene but let that not avert you from tasting its biryani and khiri(the meat from the udder of a cow). 

When hunger pangs are to be dealt under a strict budget, this place can serve as a good option, for even those who wouldn't wanna partake in beef. Irrespective of religion and class, this place welcomes their customers and caters to the needs. 

We ordered Tandoori Rotis, Khiri Kebab, Beef Korma and Beef Rezala. The rotis were tough and, in hindsight, was a wrong choice...parathas would have served us better. The kebabs were tender and adequately spiced, not overpowering to cut through the unique texture of this meat. The rezala was a bit sweeter for my palate and the meat was a bit tough. The korma was, however, a bit thin but tasted nice and the pieces were succulent and cooked through adequately. Although, the must try dish here is Khiri Kebab Roll.

The service was prompt. The ambience and decor might put off the people habituated with fine dining and thus, this is a niché place!

If you are looking for some cheap and quality food and ambience is not a thing to worry for you... this is your place... 
The place is situated next to Nizam in Hogg market... went there at around 7.30 yesterday...  Ordered Egg biriyani... tandoori roti.. Bhuna Beef... Chicken Masala and firni... 
The bhuna beef is the best thing about this place... the meat was soft.. tender and tasted heavenly.. the chicken preparation was good as well. @the biriyani is sufficient for a person and of good quality... the roti is a disappointment... hard as a rock... even the firni was not quite the way it should be... 
But the beef will make you forget everything... and since the price is so cheap so you shouldn't worry about it too much... Only if the stuff and the ambience would make you feel homely... it would have been ideal.. but it isn't... 
Would love to go again...

With nizam not selling beef any more this is the go to option for beef. Giving 3 coz the food is really tasty but ambiance is like null. This is what I ordered-
1. Khiri kebab- succulent meat pieces made into kebab it is really very tasty.
2. Paratha- perfect for accompanying the kebabs.
Pocket pinch is very low parathas ar for 12₹ and khiri kebab is 100₹.

I might be biased and I might be a dedicated Biriyani lover but I can't get over this place! The Biriyani is "perfection" and the meat is juicy and tender! So if you like your meat red and delicious and your Biriyani Kolkata style with a fat potato you must grab your next plate from here and you could perhaps laugh at its ironical nomenclature a little bit too.

There are few joints in Kolkata which serve beef & I've been in most of them. Here I've been a few times & mostly order tandoori roti, beef red gravy item & beef biryanis. Food is real average. The thing you might take a look at the space they have got. It's huge considering it's in the heart of city's business capital. Worth a shot if you're mean taker of red meat. Recommendation: Well, at your risk

Beef is what you want to eat, UP Bihar is the place to go. 
The ambiance, cleanliness may turn you off on the first look, but my advice would be to grab a seat in the cabin. Get yourself beef kabab, beef bhuna, luccha paratha, tandoori roti and green salad. 
Great taste, great texture, rightly spiced, well charred kababs, perfect crispy laccha paratha soft tandoori roti. Perfect evening snacks. 
Good place to visit with your friends, price is very cheap. Pocket pinch for two of us was Rs. 200 for all we ate. 
Its location, taste of food make the place the best beef destination in the city. 
Only down side is cleanliness. Hope management will take care of it.

Old structures always fascinate me...n as I ws walking down the rainy street of old market, this place in particular attracted me towards it...ancient structure, people working thr was a mix of youngsters n people older than the structure...
To be very frank the look of the place attracted me first. The epidemic of photo clicking lead me to order an aloo wrap for the sake of formality. A trigger happy me went on to shoot the place till an ancient yet firm voice commanded me to stop n have wat I have ordered from...right in d kitchen. I had no option but to oblige. It looked like a standard frankie like roll...wrapped in a butter paper, slipped in a paper pocket...
My first bite n my mind via my taste buds went into a tizzzyyy...it was beautiful!!! 2nd bite....3rd bite down...n before I cud understand I had already progressed to a second roll and then the 3rd...wat started as a formality ended as a surrender to the taste! All I cud muster at the end of it all was 'Anna daata...super sukhi bhava'...more than a 5 star to the place.

Fools dare where angels fear to tred. The once much talked about beef rolls are far from tasty and are a sure shot disaster. Chewy chunks of hurriedly fried beef in heaps of dalda, wrapped in thick leathery paratha, also deep fried in dalda. Definitely the last time I have eaten here. Far cry from the rolls of yesteryear. Highly advise against eating here.

Beef Bhuna and Tandoori Roti is a set combination here. If you are feeling hungry, you could opt for their Biryani as well. Cheap prices with decent taste, the quality however keeps on shifting. The place could have been set up better, but often due to negligence, the cleanliness is an issue here. The service is often slow but the food mostly makes up for it.

Kolkata has a few watering holes for beef lovers, and this, right in the heart of New Market, happens to be one.
You'd find yourself at the entrance of UP Bihar Restaurant, confused, and wondering how you found this one in a line of many old arched doorways. If you have a shopaholic girlfriend, and are at the end of the day and rope, this, dear reader, is where you can lick your wounds.
If you venture in, there'd be some great food to lick and bite into too. If you are through with the meal, well, you WILL lick your fingers.

It's not gross. Trust me. That's the kind of thing that'd come naturally at the kind of venue this is.

You'd have your choice of seats: a table for a group in the common eating area, or my favorite: the cabins.

Settle into a cabin, unless you reach there between the hours of 12PM - 3PM. The place looks dirty. The jug looks greasy. There are food stains on the table, and the waiters take a while before they actually come over.

Breathe. Browse the menu. You'd find the food quite cheap, and proceed to order. The menu is like the stuff of dreams of a young student who's begun getting the first supply of pocket money.

Always start with Nihari, if it is available. Otherwise, try out the Khiri or the Bhuna (always beef). If by this time political goons aren't after you for sacrilege, do ensure you taste the Nargis Kofta. It's kindness to the palate, and you have earned it.

I first came to know about UP Bihar from an old friend, who was a regular. I guess I am a regular too now! Tell a friend!

First of All thanks for Zomata for giving the needed data in form of Knowledge about food as per the liking.

As it was a week away from home and being in Kolkata I was totally going bersek on where to head to eat as I was now tired of chicken and fish.

I read from the reviews and my joy know no bounds when I learnt about beef and the name of the dishes in the hotel info.

I cannot express how deeply I was moved when I saw the pictures and I headed straightaway to this place. Without much botheration I easily spotted the restaurant which is next to renowned to Nizam's. As soon as I entered, there was serious contradiction between aroma and the vision. Joint is seriously old with old seating and tables and needed makeover. But whiff of meat was There were separate coupes for family where at least good quality sofa was in plain sight. I ordered Beef Kebab and Paratha and with the first morsel I was so moved I could have shed tears if not in public. All because I could eat beef after so many months after BEEF BAN LAW in Maharashtra. Quality of Food was great, meet was tender and long thick cuttings of onions with chillies was adding onto the galavti taste of Kebab. Post that ordered Daal Rice and what a homely comfort I got post eating that yellow plain dal. I just forgot the old, smoky, little unhygienic state and enjoyed eating at this place.

The only problem is they dont provide you with proper bill, it was a piece of paper with scribbling onto it.

Only place to have Khiri and Beef Kababs. One of kind, Chicken kebabs  with parathas are good too.  Kebabs + Parathas + Vinegar & Lime =  One awesome experience

This old joint in the new market area is a must visit for all meat lovers. The place doesn't look like much,  but the khiri kabab is one of the best u get in Kolkata.

Amazing food, extremely cheap and good quantity...the place might make you think if you should eat here or no but don't thing just walk in and order the beef biryani or the beef korma or the beef kabab with Paratha(my fav) and enjoy every bite...the staff might get a bit on the nerve but don't mind them just wait for your food and get ready to dig in!!!

If you are around the New Market area and a beef lover, one of the places you must visit is this one. Not for hygiene conscious people, they offer basic seating arrangement and fast service.  After Nizam's stopped serving beef and before Nizam's Moghul Garden resumed their beef section, Bihar saved us when we were nearby and wanted that meat.

My favourite here is the khiri kebab. The pieces are chunky and most of the time not overburnt like Nizam's.

They make an excellent beef stew too. Pair it with Rumali or Tandoori Roti. I had it with Paratha once and didn't like the result. The subtle gravy needs to be soaked in by the bread and the crispy, oily paratha fails to do so.

The beef tikia on the other hand is a good thing to try with the paratha. I love this spicy and tasty dish. I only wish the outside was less crispy and oily, but once I peel off that layer, it's pure delight.

Another plus here is during winters you will get the Nihari even if you come as late as 10 or 11 am. Though not as good as Sufia, the Nihari here is decent enough and good news for the late risers.

Went with my husband yesterday at around 8.30 pm as suggested by my sister several times.. The place was not so crowded. Ordered for Mutton Biryani.. Sorry to say it was far below expectations. The rice was overcooked and the mutton pieces were also hard.
Being biryani lovers we were not at all happy.

This was the first time I visited this restaurant. I was opting for breakfast, so ordered Beef Bhuna with Dal Puri. I must say the quality of both the dishes were excellent. Dal Puri was being served as soon as it being made. Which enhanced the taste and the Bhuna was simply delicious. Though the place was a bit dirty. But the food 🍴 was simply good.

Went today in the peak lunch hour around 2 p.m. so as usual it was crowded.. had to wait for 10 mins before i got my seat. 
Then after siting i ordered Beef chaap and a paratha. It cme after 10 more minutes then after having the chaap i was like ki it was worth the wait.. it was sooo yumm!!!
Then ordered a plate of Beef Kebab.. the meat in the kebab was a bit hard but comparing the taste it is negligible. 
NOW
If you hygienic then this is a strict no no for you.
If you just love the food the its too good..

So after reading a lot about this place, we finally decided to pay a visit. It's right next to Nizam in the crowded New Market. The food quality wasn't upto our expectation. Tried beef bhunna and chicken kasa, kasa was a little overpriced and quantify was less. The service was poor. It's a lil overrated.

Don't expect a great hygiene over here but the food over is hot and tasty so if you care less for a day then hop in to this restaurant to eat beef ,be it keema or rolls or else your biryani as it won't pinch your pocket over here with the affordable rates for a whole some meal but remember it has no A/C so summers really is a nuisance to eat here otherwise it fares fine .

My verdict -Go for cheap beef in new market area

UP Bihar is the place for you if you love beef and your Dad doesnt give you any cash!! Please go back if u care about hygiene although.. But as a customer said "Agar khana itna acha ho to gandagi kaun dekhe" The Khiri items are must try and I have not been disappointed a single time with their quality of food

Well, I went to this joint with zero expectations. I just craved for some beef and since this place is quite famous for its wide array of beef based dishes, I thought I should take a chance. However, once I entered I was taken aback. There is a certain charm about this place I can't really describe in words. If you are ready to forget about extra hygiene and a comfy ambiance, you can definitely visit this place. The sole reason being the quality of beef dishes they serve. I had beef biriyani and it tasted like heaven. The chicken dishes are not really worth trying though.

Whenever i go (read dragged) for shopping to new market, my girlfriend love this joint for it's khiri kababs (never tasted so cant tell you how good it is). I have tried out chicken korma (with half boiled egg), chicken kasha, tandoori chicken, naan and paratha.  Out of all i really liked the gravy of chicken korma and also tandoori chicken was good. For the chicken main dishes, they serve tender desi chicken (something i rarely come across these days) 
Overall, this is no fancy place, the food is good and the price is also fine. After a tiring exploration through the streets of new market, lunch at this place isn't a bad idea.

Firstly a couple of declarations from my end.This review is based on my maiden visit to this joint and the rating is based solely on the food as that can and should be the only talking point here. 
Aspects like hygiene,ambiance,decor,service,staff behaviour etc hold no relevance as has been highlighted in much detail by my fellow foodies.
So let me get straight to the point- what else but food! This is an out and out beef joint.Almost all and i repeat almost all regulars order the beef items on offer.I tried out the beef chaap and the beef kathi kebab along with the tandoori roti. The beef chaap took the honours and was yum to say the least.The pieces of beef were pretty soft,well boiled, not chewy at all and the gravy was to die for.Unfortunately i cannot sing paeans about the kebab though. It was over burnt and the meat had lost its flavour. May be it was not fresh.The beef kebab at Nizams next door is way better than what they serve here. Rotis were piping hot and extremely well-made.
Next on my target list would be the much recommended kheeri kebab/roll and the beef biriyani.
Prices as is the norm in beef joints are pocket friendly, though they have been jacked up since 15th October.

I love this place, have been visiting this place for quite a few years now.Ambiance wise this isn't a great place, but if Good Food, esp. Beef is what you are looking for then this is the place to visit.I love the Biriyani they prepare, simply delicious... The Beef tikka is equaly good, gives a smoky taste to the tikkas. The mutton dishes here are good too.Try the Kebabs here, I am sure you are gonna like them. On the negative side, this place does lack hygiene. So take that into account before you visit.Otherwise, the food is absolutely great.

I know. I know the place sounds weird. We first thought it too! But all your shenanigans would vanish once you taste their house specialties. I can guarantee you that.

This beef joint has been there for ages serving beef delicacies to the ever hungry Calcuttans. Today after a shopping spree, we wanted to buy something meaty yet not burn a hole in our pockets. Thus, here we were. U.P.Bihar.

The place is shabby, not very hygienic. One cannot except a place like this should have an appealing ambience. But the food? Oh my! It's what it's been known for. The only mughlai khana where they serve "Kheeri" and it's taste is no less than a miracle. Let me enlighten you first, kheeri is cow's meat from udder. It's tender, a bit crunchy and extremely tasty!

We ordered 1 plate kheeri kebab, 4 tandoori rotis, 1 plate beef korma & a plate of beef rezala. (Point to be noted: Don't take chicken or mutton unless you are a moron). Kheeri kebab as mentioned before was terrific. Tandoori rotis were stiff (didn't like it). Beef korma surprisingly turned out to be quite a dish. Rezala was too common (like you find most places, only here it's beef in stead of Mutton). Accompanied with all these, we took 2 bottles of Pepsi (pictures not taken as you definitely have seen a bottle of pepsi before).

All in all, a nice meal. Just so you know, this place is not ideal for family dining but a great place for a quick bite or lavish dining with friends.

Well, It's a shabby little place. No doubt about that.. but oh boy! The khiri kebabs and khiri rolls!!
If you consider the price and the juiciness oh the khiri kebabs, you wont find many places to beat this little gem of a place!
I like all things old, and this place IS just that!
Heard about this place from my uncle, who used to be a regular during his college days. So, I decided to give it a try.
The Khiri kebab is GOOD. It's soft and juicy, the waiters are one unruly lot, running around and loitering at the same time. There's a lot of banter between them. But, I guess that adds to the charm!
This place is not for everyone, this is rather an acquired taste!

Location : Right next to Nizam's
Specialty : Khiri kebab
Price: REALLY CHEAP
Ambiance : Not that great for most. Great for me (I have a thing for old establishments)

p.s: Khiri kebab means, the kebabs are made from chopped mammaries. So, keep that in mind if you have any mental blocks about such delicacy!! :P

This place is shabby and rundown. Even their menu cards are in tatters. The staff take a lot of time to come and take your order. And just as my other esteemed fellow reviewers I can't help but give this place a 3.5. Because the food here is good. It is actually very good. If you manage to get one of the booths you will just get more privacy not better service. But no matter where you sit the food served will be good....always. You go there for the food and food alone. Oh and one more thing if you have inhibitions with regards to eating beef and with regards to hygiene DO NOT go here. The must have is definitely the khiri kebab which is nothing but kebab made of the cow's udder. The texture and tenderness are the most captivating aspects of the dish. It is served on a stainless steel plate with chillies and tossed onions. Also I liked the beef nargis kofta. The beef kebab was just about average in my opinion. I am going back soon....for the beef biriyani. SOON.

U.P Bihar Restaurant.

Damn you, Shilpa Shetty cause you did not even tell us you were inspired by this place. Yes my folks, this place indeed is inspiring. Old, Cob-Webby, Dedicatedly Rundown, Nefariously Underground yet Delectably Worthy of my un-modulated praise.

Well, if you love food and Calcutta you must know Nizam and just look a few metres right of Nizam and you'll find a large signboard calling out "Bihar Restaurant". Try and go in and you will find another signboard yelling "U.P Bihar Restaurant". Though I have no idea why U.P gets extinct in that 3 foot space but inside it's all business, all U.P and all Bihar. The charm of the place lies in its shot through the vein sarcophagus. Architecture that is nowhere now, grandeur that is long extinct but an appeal that is of an experienced dipsomaniac who still tells a story holding his last peg of whisky.
 
Me and my friend went there and ordered a Beef Khiri Kabab, Two Tandoori Rotis and a Chicken Biriyani. Devoid of female companionship, we did not chose a cabin and sat at the general section (Though it is advised that you avail a cabin if you care for privacy and/or mental peace). The food came within 5 to 7 minutes. The Chicken Biriyani compared to all leading Biriyani chains, perfectly held its own with the chicken being succulent and the potato being sinfully creamy. Rotis were strictly okay with no extra frills, pretty decent. The Khiri Kabab (Kebabs made from Cow Udders) was an whole new level of awesome. Try this and you will not be disappointed. The bill came at 196 INR which is down right cheap. The taste is awesome & the quality is not compromised. A place that should definitely be tried out.

Please do try this place out. Stop caring about the decor and the service and concentrate on the food. Bliss will await you.

For starters, this place ambiance wise is my worst nightmare. Crammy, dirty, stuffy and do NOT drink the water they serve. Please go for bottled drinking water. There is nothing called service. You need to basically find yourself a cabin and jump inside it. I cannot imagine sitting and eating inside.

Why have you given this place a 3.5 then ? Well the food is better than most other Mughlai joints in the city and it is dirt cheap. We ordered one plate of Chickhen Biriyani, two plates of Beef Biriyani, a beef Kebab, a beef Khiri Kebab, and a beef bhuna, three cold drinks and it cost us 514 bucks. And every single dish was amazing. I am not a big fan of meat but tried one piece of from all the dishes and they were excellant even as per my taste.All my points are for the food and only for the food.

I would recommend this place as more of a takeaway joint than actually sitting and eating here.

All right, I have to be honest - The last time I had been here was six months back, and I completely forgot about it till I saw the pictures and remembered that I HAD eaten here. However, sadly, the beef biryani is supposed to be very good here, but we did not have it that day. Rather, I went for my eternal favorite - beef roll and Kheeri kabab. Both of them were very good that day, and we followed it up with a plate of bhuna beef with parathaa. The bhuna was good, but the paratha was too oily, which is strange, because the roll's paratha was not that oily.  Probably because it was wrapped in paper or something.

the ambience is totally NOT worthy of mentioning.
its crammed and super hot inside and very shabby.
but the food is good.
try the beef biryani there... obviously it is not at par with nizam's beef biryani but still it is lip smacking. the beef chaap is also good.
people should visit this place only for the food and if the place is too much for anyone to take then they are welcome to have take aways :P
