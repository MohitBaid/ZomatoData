I usuqlly visit this place to eat firni..
Though the place is not for family..
Nd service and ambience not at all good..
Bt firni over here seems traditionally connected..

This restaurant located near khidderpore tramdepot is one of the oldest moughlai restaurants in khidderpore.The special chicken biriyani garnished with cashew nuts and tomatoes is quite tasty ,so is the spicy flavouful mutton tikia and rich chicken chaap, you can also try the chicken kanti kebab which is small cubes of chicken fried in a rich hot gravy.The food maybe tasty but the quality is not upto the mark .Service is prompt but the ambience is not suitable for family dineouts.This restaurant is suitable for a cheap moughlai takeaway.

Foods are good at a nominal price...but maintenance is low.
