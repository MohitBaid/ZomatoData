Food quality is good on the bit overpriced side...
Staffs are good...
But behavior of owner is good at times and pathetic at times...
Business minded running with less compassion is not appreciable....

I can proudly say that I have developed a sweet tooth solely for this shop. The Pantua, Rasogolla baked and the traditional one, the Malai Chom chom, are heavenly. Their Chinese Singara is also amazing. But what I like the most is their Mishti Doi. I am insanely in love with them. Do give the doi a try and you will not regret it.

Today I tried rabri.
It was of good quality. Liked it very much.
Try once if you haven't tried it at all.
Located on the main road,it's easy to find.

The sweet shop named "Narendra Mistanna Bhandar", actually belongs to the same owner as that of "Bangasree Mistana Bhandar". Located near Anwarshah Road Crossing, at South Russa Road, this place is a descent shop to chomp on some nice sweets on the go, and to pack some for takeaway as well. In recent times, they upgraded it to air-conditioned, which is an added benefit.

located near bangur hospital, this shop is quite famous for the ridiculously soft and succulent rosogollas ...keeping with the changing times it has increased its repertory to include fusion sweets like baked chamcham, baked rosogollas and baked mihidana... well all these are sinful to say the least....go indulge in your sweet fantasies.....

This is a shop which provides quality sweets at right price.. They are at bar or sometimes i feel, better than the big fame counterparts .
Its located opp to the gate of Tolly club. There is ample parking space and you can park in front of the shop itsel.
Try their baked rosogolla and benchmark with those from the Big name starting with B... narandra is better any day.
I like their mishti doi too. 
narendra has the potential to be a very big name, Whenever I need sweets in bulk, i go for narendra sweet.

I had their chhanar chomchom, pantua, darbesh and kaju barfi. The chomchom and kaju barfi were good (the latter not as good as a Haldiram barfi) but the darbesh and pantua were pretty average tasting, too sweet and kind of bland. Some sweets are actually quite ordinary. Despite the sweetmakers claiming to be high-class confectioners on the box, I did not quite find them of a high quality. Sweet shops like Bhim Nag or Banchharam churn out far better sweets in the city.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: Located near the Tollygunge metro towards deshpran shasmal road. Just on the more. Keeps some huge variety of sweets for your requirement.

AMBIANCE AND STAFF: Ambiance is nice but small. Staffs are nice and well

Food: We had the Rasmalai and gulab jamun to taste. Both were equally well and tasty. 

Ras Malai was soft as well as it was tasting equally fabulous with the ras.

Gulab Jamun was soft and taste was very good.

QNQ AND PRICES: Qaulity was good and quantity was also satisfactory. Prices are reasonable.

CONCLUSION: With 4 outlets around the city they are serving well. They have got huge amount of sweet variety for you.

NOTE: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.
