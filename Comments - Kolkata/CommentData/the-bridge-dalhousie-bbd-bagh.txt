One of the most hyped restaurants in kolkata but was a major let down on my debut visit that too on the eve of new year. The place definitely fulfills the criteria of carrying a romantic and peaceful ambience beside the Ganges but failed to impress due to poor management and service. Repeated reminders for order fell into deaf ears of the waiters. Poor hospitality despite of having sky high prices in the menu card. Well to conclude, would never want to visit the place again.

As the name suggests this restaurant actually floats on the river Ganges with an amazing scenic beauty with the view of Howrah bridge, Second Hoogly Bridge and SBI Samriddhi Bhawan. Although having a great advantage of its location to mesmerize the visitors, it failed our expectations and made us disappointed, that too on the eve of 1st January. The uncleanliness and poor management of this place spoiled our mood the most. The food was also not worth the price taken.
P.S. The rating is only for the location and idea.

Went there on 1st Jan night to celebrate the New Year with lot of enthusiasm and high expectations. Perfect open air view of the Ganges and the SBI building that changes colour. Looks stunning!
However the entire experience in Floatel was a major letdown. The servers were busy arranging tables and they didn't have the courtesy to provide clean glasses. On repeated reminders we were given glasses for water. Drinks tat we ordered took them 1hrs 15 mins to serve, that too had to repeatedly remind them. It was not that the place was buzzing with guests, bt still I took them such a time to serve just drinks. Complimentary accompaniments came 1hr later, and the candle was brought to our table 20 mins before we were about to leave.. 
Pathetic service for food and drinks that are priced like 5star restaurants. Both the management and servers need to learn how to handle guests and hospitality. Worst experience ever on a new year night 😫
The rating is only for the scenic beauty and view. 
P.S. The food price available in Zomato are not correct, they are extremely high in hotel menu.

Let's start with good things first.
*)The ambiance is good.
*)Waiters are very nice with behaviour.
Now the bad part of the place was the food.
Yes the food was not just not at all up to the Mark.
Highly disappointed. Starters served cold I mean who would love to have their Kababs cold n not tasty.
Main course food too wasn't good.
The most disappointing fact was the person named Zaffar Khan. He badly needs to know how to talk with their customers, I mean this man was quite rude, if he has to ask something to us he could have been a little polite & gentle but he has an attitude which was very very disappointing. Very upsetting. I would not like to visit here and neither would suggest any of my friends here ever. I can still consider the food part but the person Zaffar Khan was the main concern for our dissatisfaction with the place. That's the candel they provide for candel light dinner....LOL!! 

P.S : The food review was on the buffet.

I would actually give it a negative one for the service provided to us. 
1. They have all the tables near the corners reserved on which no one sat throughout the duration we were there which was well over an hour.
2. We ordered a coffee and mushroom starter. The dish arrived within 10 mins but the coffee never did. The people who had come well after us were served before. Eventually we cancelled the coffee after waiting well over 45 minutes.
3. The waiters were so laid back that they another 10 minutes to get the card machine. 
Overall a bad experience and I would'nt recommend it even after it claims to be the first floating hotel of India because it doesn't give u a feel of floating. It's as stationary as any other Normal place would be plus overpriced.

Only best thing about this place is it's ambience that to only on the deck I.e. Open space area.. Worst food quality..! Burnt garlic Fried rice and schezwan rice sucks.. It was pathetic.. for starter chilli prown was good.. Also service is too slow.. it took them 45 mints to bring pre-ordered menu..! If u want to spent some quality nd cozy time with ur love this is the place.. but for food u can go at your own risk.. Only suggestion would be if u guyz can improve the standard nd quality of your food along with your staff service then this place will be worth it.. Tough job for you guyz. Hopefully you can improve ur food quality.. 2 star only for ambience

The place is absolutely amazing to be. The candle lit dinner on that Ganges is really an experience with the breeze comforting you to another level. 

The mocktails need improvement.

The food is good. The whole Bhetki in Plum sauce is huge and tasty. 

The ambience is just awesome. 

Rates are on the pricier side.

Heard about this place a lot as. So chose to select this place to celebrate our Anniversary dinner.Made the reservation three days earlier and also requested them to prepare Anniversary cake. On arrival we were shocked to see the service level. Staff were clueless about the reservation. They had us standing for nearly 15 minutes in a near empty restaurant to find us a table. No one was paying any attention as to why two people were standing inside the restaurant.When we finally decided to make a complaint then one person came and asked what happened and after listening to us he again vanished.We asked another person to check if atleast the cake was prepared so that we could take it and leave the place. But alas the cake was also not prepared.

Final review:-
Location is awesome but beware you would be entering into the domain of CLUELESS MEN if you decide to visit.

Service is very poor and the food tasted worst. Its just another place in kolkata which is way too much overhyped and over priced. Waiters was not sure about the ingredients availability for making drinks. Manager was not sure when the food will be served. Others were not sure about the dish names. For the first two rounds we took fish which was stated as some chicken preparation, took some veg nuggets which was stated as chicken croquettes. Drink menu condition was very poor. Papers were just hanging all torn up. Apart from the view total system is disgusting. Only the salad and soup was ok. That too not very good.

The breakfast buffet offers a variety of options - from pancakes with honey/butter to paratha with aloo sabji, idli, a live egg counter. Unlimited refills of food, tea, coffee, juice. Not sure about tourists, makes for a special breakfast spot for people in town as well!

Food - 4.5/5

This place has got beautiful view of bridge and river. It has got open n closed seating area and wonderful staffs. The idea is amazing which is way it tempted me to visit the restaurant. But it disappointed me by looking so badly maintained. I had only coffee which I enjoyed with complimentary cookies and fabulous sunset but the place needs major maintenance and redevelopment plan. From deck to restaurant to washrooms ... everything .. every inch n every part needs to be maintained. It looks very old n used up. I sincerely Wish they take up the project of relaunching such a beautiful place .. to make this - one of the must visit place of Kolkata . Sadly for now .. it's Out of my list for revisiting the restaurant.

It was absolutely a wrong choice visiting this place. We just couldn't finish the soup and the starter and had to leave. Soup and starter took 40minutes to arrive. The table and chairs used are not upto the mark. Felt like some cheap arrangement in the seating area. They need to improve in every category to be counted in good restaurants. Do not plan any special occasion and spoil the day.

I chose to celebrate my 5th date anniversary at this restaurant because of it's romantic venue .What I didn't know was the cocktails are a complete disaster here .Service is so poor that bad is an understatement.
Also when I ticked at the Fair box for service in their feedback form the waiter came to charge upon me why have i given him fair and not good .Ouuuch !

 ➡️In starters I had Golden crispy Prawn(this item was actually good )along with cocktails - Tequila sunrise and Margarita .
What a disappointment ! 

In main course I had  -

➡️ Moroccan lemon chicken steak with mushroom sauce 

➡️Seared stuffed chicken breast with crushed pepper sauce 

Ps- Both the dishes were okaish and preferably Moraccan chicken is better ..

The pros of the restaurant is it's signature structure of a ship , the surrounding ambience and of course the decoration.

We went for the buffet but again each and eveything was ice cold not one dish we had was hot it was cold.and tasted horrible.the hottest thing the had available to eat was the gulab jamun that was the dessert.
I wouldn't pay 3grand just to have gulab jamun again.

Wanted to visit this restaurant for long but after visiting it I have realized that its not worth going there at all. Extremely expensive, over-hyped restaurant which serves very mediocre food at five star prices. In this monsoon season the open-air section remains closed for public, indoor dining area is nothing extraordinary, glass windows are not so big so view is nothing exceptional. Service is poor, waiters have no clue about the menu, most of the items are not available every time, even all of their chef's special menus are also not available when we visited..ordered sarsowali fish tikka, murg tikka nawabi, chilli prawn and fresh lime soda. Fish used in the dish was of extremely low quality, hard, smelly, chicken nawabi and sarsowali fish tasted exactly same, may be same marination was used for both the dishes, prawn item was the only edible item but the price was exorbitant, 6 pieces of medium sized prawn at price of 950 plus 18% GST, even they couldn't make proper lime soda also. The restaurant was almost empty during our one hour stay, thats obvious because nobody wants to empty their pockets for third class food!! Service was bad also, when you charge such high price then high quality service is expected which was lacking. Overall disappointed , never going there again.

The overall experience could have been a lot better. 
The food quality,  no doubt was fantastic but there is so much more to a restaurant experience! 
The Bridge, is over priced.
Listed as a fine dining restaurant this place can certainly do with some improvement on their interiors. The tables and chairs in the indoor area could do with some refinement in terms of comfort and aesthetics. Considering the ambiance that is available to them, they could have put the area to better use.
With reference to our visit, the major downside was that during the payment process, we offered a Rupay Debit card which was not accepted, causing us inconvenience as we had to go to a nearby ATM. A very disheartening ending to our dinner.
The most shocking observation was that there were rats running around along the side of the indoor dining area which was absolutely appalling and unacceptable!

1 only because there is no negative rating options. Cost is extremely high. Well don't mind paying that much but then the food and the ambience should be worth it. And service? Nobody served us water for like 10 mins and there were only 5-6 tables to wait. Has to ask the waiter for water repeatedly. And don't get me started on the food, not worth what one's paying. DO NOT GO TO that place

Drinks: towards the expensive side however I am sure one can spend this amount once in a blue moon as this place is a worth come back for me...One advice though I dont know whether it would be advisable or not in Kolkata.... why dont u keep coolers on the open area..... I am in love with this place. Definitely I am coming back

Must visit place in Kolkata and being a Kolkatan its feels our pride to have something like this in our city.
Hope i could get some magic membership by which i can always pay a visit to the place.

The ambience of this place is just amazing.  It just sets your mood but the food spoils it. Trust me I am not a big fan of this plan as far as food is concerned. I hope they improve their food quality coz that will make them almost invisible.

Ambience is no doubt very good!! You don't have to work on it...it comes free.. river Ganges does it for you.. the service is also pretty good.. the only thing I didn't like much was the food! 
But it's one of the best place for organising a small party..

Relaxed ambience, open space, river view, exotic cuisines and candle-light dinner - with all these traits combined, you can definitely expect a menu which is a wee bit overpriced. Along with cuisines, it also has an interesting list of cocktails and mocktails to serve. I loved the way the mocktails have been named. I was absolutely fascinated with Cinderella and Masala Mantra, but my husband insisted on Guava Delight. Ingredients included guava juice, Tobasco sauce with salt and pepper mill. It lived up to its name - truly delightful.
We also had starter followed with a continental cuisine. I had to admit that the food isn't heavenly, but it is good enough to satisfy your taste buds and hunger as well. The only thing which irked me was  service which was slow. At one point, we felt like we had to wait for ages to get our order. But, its pros outnumbered its cons, hence, we let go of the service part.

The bridge on Floatel is situated in a vessel anchored in the Ganga. It has the advantage of being unique in location ...with Howrah bridge on one side and Vidyasagar setu on another side. Wonderful upper deck ..but we reached there on a hot summer afternoon. So had to sit indoor. You can watch the boats passing by while having your meal. We had ordered chicken and prawn starter. The prawn starter though priced on the steep side was disappointing. We ordered prawn rissotto...yummy with a lovely after taste. The chicken dish with the noodles was ok. The staff was very well behaved...guiding us with our choices.

Nothing much to say about this place really. Went there with high expectations. In a way this place disappointed me. We went for the dinner buffet.
Frankly speaking the amount they charge for the buffet is way high than what they deliver!!! The buffet menu is very limited and also there is not much nice to talk about the taste and quality of the food too.
The dessert section only had a mango flavored mousse, sweets of two kind and only a single choice of ice cream (an out and out let down i must say)
The only thing nice about this place is the ambience... The view of the howrah bridge all lighted up... And also the second Hooghly bridge on the other side is marvellous...
Other than that, i m sorry but this place is not worth the price they charge...

Though we missed out on the open air dining but the alternative table provided to us left no room for regret. It was a nice cozy dimly lit elegant ac room with our table offering mesmerizing view of the Ganga, Howrah Bridge, Vidyasagar Setu and launches, boats passing by. 
Food was good especially the Dan Dan spicy noodles. The service here needs a special mention. We were awesomely treated by very courteous staff.
The overall experience was so fulfilling that we didn't feel like wasting time taking pics :p..

Everything is perfect, except for the food and service. The view is incomparable, the location is as good as the view but the food is just not worth your money. The service is also not at par with other good restaurants. You can ask for the bill even before you start having your meal. It will take you ages. Your food might get digested by the time they provide you the bill. I have rated this only for the location.  There's a huge void which they need to fill.

Perfect place for date. Somewhere in between the Ganges, perfect ambience, a perfect view. It's better if you book a table so that you can avoid the rush which is what I did. If you ask me about the food, well I must say it's scrumptious, though I haven't had much but the menu looks good. As for the drinks we had wine and the menu is quite standard compared to any good bar/pub. Guys if you plan for a date to impress your girl, this is a perfect place.

The theme restaurant is located on the top deck of Floatel at Strand in Kolkata. The beautiful view of the river and the skyline of Kolkata and illuminated Howrah Bridge made us spellbound when we dropped for dinner. You can step out of the air-conditioned restaurant to the open deck to have a good view. Inside, you have a complete feel of a ship. The restaurant have a multicuisine choice of menu and we ordered grilled prawn and lamb filled potato balls. Food was good but becomes secondary because of the overall ambience. Must try if you are in Kolkata.

Most expensive experience ever and not even worth.. total waste of money... i went along with my friends and we have read the reviews that food is not good but unluckly we still decided to have buffet there as we would have some choice..as kids were hungry too.. so, we opted for veg and non-veg buffet to try out. As been said in other reviews .. both were hopeless.. price charges is like 5star - 1200++ for buffet .. a beer cost is Rs 850++ i guess he only thing keeping them in business is their location ..or else its a total waste of money.

We had our buffet breakfast and lunch at the restaurant during our stay at Floatel. 

Buffet breakfast was included and was quite decent with Indian and continental options.It was served in the restaurant indoor area. For lunch,we chose to sit in the outside deck area which had a beautiful river view. We ordered for Chooza Makkhani ,Masala Kulcha and soft drinks. The food was delicious! Chooza Makkhani was not sweet unlike Butter Chicken served at most places and had a unique taste which I really liked as I'm not a very big fan of sweet curries. Masala Kulchas were soft and went quite well with the curry.Overall, had an amazing dining experience at Floatel. Special thanks to Mr. Nayak who always served with a smile and was quite courteous and helpful .

Want to go for a romantic date on the ganges with breathtaking views of the kallolini Kolkata?  Then floatel is the place! The place is absolutely stunning for its deck nd view and top of the world experience of having food on the deck of the ship. The buffet here is moderately good. It's the ambience tat actually scores high than everything else. The service is also okay.

First thing first, if you wanna take your date out on a romantic place....this is the place you can definitely click. Ambience: mindblowing....on a ship deck with vidyasagar setu on one side and howrah bridge on the other with cool soothing ganges breeze for company. The tables are candle lit to add the requisite class to your romantic evening!!  
But that is it.....!!! Food: It is overpriced to be honest, nothing in the menu is worth the price. I guess the price also includes the "ambience cost" but even then it is overpriced. Every item on menu isnt available 24 × 7. That is also a let down.
Quality: Decent but nothing extraordinary!!

Finally: the serving team definitely needs to learn more courtesy. At the end they ask for feedback. Feedback is a thing which is taken so that a restaura improves its standard. For any average feedback the waiters ask you ample whys, whats, etc and try to justify that they are correct and you are wrong. That spoils the mood. Hope they correct this

Floatel is a flop show in terms of food, ambience, staff. Undoubtedly the concept and the view is unmatched, and one can try it in the evenings provided you are not looking for a great course of dinner. I particularly had a harrowed time as the staffs were confused where to sit us and hence we were  kept waiting for a while, the food was not worth the price, considering the fact that I spent approximately the same shells in ITC Sonar few days back. I will not recommend it for anything except for the view and if you think that the scenic beauty is more important than your pocket, please go ahead. ARRGGGGHHHH

Coming to the food, though the price is quite premium mainly for its prime location mostly, the taste of the food is not too bad. It is quite decent. The presentation of the food is good. The staff there are exceptionally nice and very helpful. Customer service is superb there.
The deck outside is a good place to sit and enjoy the view of the river if required.

Would definitely recommend everyone for a visit. The best thing is that it is 24hrs open

Visited this place on this New Year's eve. Was one of the bad decision taken,to have buffet dinner. Food was not good or atleast i have never tasted any food of this quality in a 3 star hotel. Coming to service.. may i know who were in charge to admit these people in a so called'3- star' hotel?? If this what the service is then i must say a road side dhaba has better service than this! Hope never to pay visit to such a place. And yea.. probably the only place where they charged buffet around 1560 approx and they don't serve icecream or any thing of that sought for desserts... forget about starters and maincourse. I payed visit with my cousins and everyone was dissapointed.

One of its kind in the entire country I believe!! The ambiance is heavenly! A perfect place for an wedding party or a romantic date! But one thing that has always disappointed me is the quality of food. I've visited the place thrice but only because no place else can provide such a beautiful and soothing environment. Last time we went in a group of 11 and ordered 11 chinese sizzlers. They took the order but when served, we observed that only 8 sizzlers were served in sizzler plates. Remaining 3 were served in normal plates. When asked the manager informed us that they do not have any more!! The sizzler was also the worst I've ever tasted! You can't just serve 5 pan fried chicken lollipops & a small amount of noodles and call it a sizzler. There were no breads, boiled vegetables or anything else. The rating is solely for the ambiance. For food, it deserves not more that 0.5

Subsequently had died rice and Hakka Noodles with chilly chicken for main course. The food was very average but price is prohibitive. The bill was 9k+. Service was poor.

A much awaited visit to this restaurant was a great success. We wished for tasting something different and hence we decide to go for  Continental. We started with Teriyaki Chicken Skewers... which was just perfect in taste. Moroccan Lemon Chicken and Seared Stuffed Chicken Breast was simply lip smacking. The presentation of both the dishes was also great! Chicken was soft and well cooked. The best part of the restaurant is the ambience. They also offer you a chance of candle lit dinner. It's a perfect place to go for a date or even with family. 
It might appear a little costly but given its beautiful ambience and food quality it's worth the price.

The ambiance is nice. Awesome view of the Kolkata Riverside. 

However the food quantity is simply too little to be considered. The Pan-fried fish is a part of the main course menu and is said to have a steak of fish with a side of spaghetti and veggies. All I got was single 4x4 inch piece of fried fish with frizzy noodles on top (not a side of spaghetti).

Can I have your cow's number? Because I don't know why it would take half an hour to get a lassi on the table.
The delivery speed was terribly slow, the hotel did not feel like floating and the idea of ambience seemed to be horribly clashing led string lights with tea lights on the table and about an hour of a bad instrumental rendition of Jingle Bells that's going to traumatise me this Christmas.
We ordered drinks: a coffee, a fresh lime soda and a sweet lassi.
The coffee was a grey something, I had to ask for extra coffee powder and upend three sachets of sugar to hide the awful taste.
The lime soda was just salty water with a slice of lemon.
The sweet lassi tasted like liquid cheese that had forgotten when it's last expiry date was.

Also, it might be useful if the waiters did anything slightly more than wait at their table!
The best part was the bathroom, it was quite clean. Although considering their level of cooking, it better be.

Been Here For Dinner Tonight With Family. Ambiance Was Excellent. Food Was Sumptuous  , We Ordered A'la Carte' Though. Coz Buffer Was Not Worth INR 1100+Tax .Also Service Was On A Bit Slower Side. And Service Staffs Gossiping Loud Is Not A Very Good Sign Of Professionalism

This place might be the best place according to ambience the city can offer except a few rooftops. I was here with family during a new yr food fest, the food was extremely dull in most of th cases,some starters like fish fry, cutlet was good,main course was oky,i dnt lyk ilish so avoided it but saw many ppl enjoying it.

Next time cam on date at night. The place was like heaven had some decent food but the price doesn't match the taste at all,but i wl say do visit the best time is after 4 at winter u can enjoy the sunset.its dope.

Dirty cutlery..Bland and dull food. Lacked flavour. Peas pulao was smelling burnt, 
Even with ample number of staff, the waiting time is too high. 
Unworthy of the price they charge... The place is over hyped only because of the ambiance 
Awful experience ... Extremely Disappointed :(

One of the only places in Kolkata where you can find such view while dining . A bit expensive though compared to the service you get .The  only thing which is not very good is the service. There is no one around to attend to you. But the food and ambiance makes up for it to certain extent.Overall a good experience. Must try the mutton dishes.

Location is superb; wid the view of the Ganges.
If U go to the restaurant U get a lavish buffet; U can ask the waiter for a discount; we got. It's also a v nice place to book for parties....there r different spaces of different capacities.
Food is good; bt visit it for the location more tan the taste of food. Staff behaviour is good.

We were staying that the floatel for our anniversary and first, we had a cup of tea/coffee and some french fries in the evening. For dinner, we had pan fried fish on a bed of spaghetti vegetables with garlic lemon butter and seared stuffed chicken breast with pepper sauce. The portions were quite reasonable and it was good to have chicken cooked differently. The food was divided up well from the kitchen itself and waiter at our table served us. For dessert we had mango cheesecake, though we wanted the bailey's panacota (it wasn't available). All of it was yum and by the end of it we were thoroughly satisfied. There is a 15% discount for in house guests for dinner which we got. There is nothing more romantic than having dinner by the riverside with your partner watching the boats and ferries sail by, with the wind in your hair.
Breakfast is complementary if you are staying there. There is a huge spread, with both continental foods as well as Indian foods. While you have the chicken sausages, french toast, pancakes, porridge, corn flakes, and some baked stuff, there is also dosa, idli, puri-subzi, dahi vada and poha. There were also buns, croissants, pastries, fruits, fruit juice and etc. It is a proper brunch and we didn't have lunch that day.

The only downside is that all the waiters do not speak English well. Considering the high prices and the fact that a lot of non Indians stay there, it should be mandatory that they speak English well.

Extremely poor service, very average food, plus they are overpriced!! I wonder what takes them so long to prepare when they provide such low grade food! We waited for almost 45 mins before the starters were served and then had to leave the place without eating , after waiting for around 1 hour. Mind you, this is when I was pregnant and they didn't think twice before making me wait for so long. Besides, they were not even ashamed of not being able to serve us!! Ridiculous!!

This has to be, by far  the most romantic location in Kolkata for a classy dinner with your loved ones. With the backdrop of the Ganges and the breathtaking view of the majestic second Hooghly bridge and the the first Howrah bridge, lit up in all their glory at night, the passenger boats, cargo ships and ferries dotting the river and the open air ambience by the riverside makes the experience something out of a dream. And not just the ambience, I have found the food there to be quite delectable and the service impeccable. I have been there thrice  and have tasted their malaysian chicken satay, cheese fish fingers and spanish chicken balls. The appetizers are really tasty. Another dish worth mentioning is the moroccan lemon chicken steak with mushroom sauce, juicy tender chicken, perfectly marinated and grilled that pampers your taste buds. From their 24 hour menu, I really loved their chicken ala king and mutton roganosh. I haven't really tried out most of their desserts, because they remain unavailable half the time, save for the mango cheesecake, which turned out to be orgasmic. The prices may be a bit steep..but I love going back to the place again and again.

Zomato allows you to give the minimum rating as 1 otherwise I would have rated it in negative.

The staffs are so rude and pathetic though being in an hospitality industry.
I came with one of my friend, went to the open terrace and asked for a table of 2. Every table on the terrace was empty but the staff told it's all booked I was surprised then another staff told there is one table left. Then both of them were discussing on that and the other was literally cursing the first staff on his behaviour.

I got this as a hint and left the restaurant then and there only.

Went for navami lunch. Simple buffet of bengali cuisine. Dishes were okay, nothing which sticks to ur palate. They gave us a really small table for 4, which was just enough for 2 ppl while there were other empty tables, right beside the windows which looks onto the river. On asking them, they sd the tables were reserved but none were occupied even after we finished eating after about 2 hours. The plus point of this place, the ambience and being on the ship feeling. The upper deck has beautiful view, great for taking pictures.

We were planning a visit to this place for a long time. & finally went there on my b'day. It was nearly 5.15 in the evening.. as we entered one of the staff told us that we hv to wait for 45 min. So we decided to leave. Then another staff came & arranged a table for us. Location was nice bt decoration was below avg ( later we heard that they decorate the terrace only fr parties). Now coming to the food  we ordered two starters( one chkn & one mushroom). Decoration of the food was superb. Bt the taste was not good at all. & comparing the price quantity was very small. & the most horrible experience was after we gave them an avg review. they were literally forcing us to chng the review. Overall experience was very disappionting. not recommended. Sourav Ghosh

This is THE ultimate place to take your significant other out on a date. They have seating arrangement at the rooftop as well as inside of the restaurant. But I would really suggest u go for the open terrace as u would be mesmerised by the view and the beauty,there is to take . The candlelight, the riverside breeze, the moonlight reflecting on the ripples, the lightened up view of the Vidyasagar Setu - there's just one word for the ambience- ENCHANTING. Now coming back to the food , we had gone for a buffet - it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. I wish there were more items and the taste could be improved but I am not complaining as the place itself is so charming that it would take your focus somewhat away from food. And this coming from me is a big deal as food is all there's on my mind . Lastly the service was apt and staffs were really polite. All in all one of the best dates ever :)

The name Itself suggests that the restaurant is on the bank of Ganga, which makes it divergent from any other restaurant in Kolkata. While the location is superb, the food taste is unsatisfactory and there is much room for improvement.  Staffs there are well behaved and polite. If you are thinking of value for money then I will suggest not to go.

The ambience is out of the world...the restaurants famous gangetic view is out of the world, romantic and soothing. The winter afternoons are really pleasant. The floatel is essentailly all about enjoying good food with good company amidst the natural ambiemce of the ganges river. So its a 10/10 feeling... :)

They have a splendid buffet with very classic starters. We went on christmas so the buffet had special items. They had a variety of citrus fruits and berries for salad and starter. They had a roast turkey. They had chicken items and veg salads as well. The main course had a richly made mutton biriyani and chicken side dishes. The king prawns were winners. The fish was creamy and mellowed. We ended with their dessert platter which had lemon cakes, chocolate items, gulab jamun, ice cream and sweet crispers. I loved all of it. Every bit of the menu was splendid. Its a must go with family or you dearest ones or for a roamntic date. The place is also open for birthdays and wedding reception/anniversary parties. Its a must go for everyone. Rate 10/10.

Good Food. Nice ambience. The open air seating arrangements on the deck is just awesome. In buffet dinner, we have got only one chicken item and only one veg item as starters. I guess number of varieties should be added to the starters. As well as we have been given the welcome drinks as per BAR-Man's choice. I guess choice should be applied for the welcome drinks. Apart from these two points, rest are just awesome.

Been here for the 1st time for dinner tonight i.e. 23/07/16...

Wonderful ambience.... With beautiful Indian music .... Exploitation of the Ganga is an added attraction.

Food is over-costly .... Food quality is moderate.

The waiting time is too high. Although the number of staffs seemed to be sufficient, we had to wait quite long at every step/phase of the dinner.... From the starter being served quite late to the bill being presented late ad well.

We ordered, chicken tandoor sizzler, hakka noodles chkn, an oriental chkn side.

Food is bland. The chicken and mixed veg dishes recommended by the waiter were both average at best. I had to also send my non-alcoholic mojito back since I'd ordered for an alcoholic one. Service was decidedly slow and I had order around the waiters to get things done on time. The pan fried ilish was not bad. The location and ambience are the saving graces. Lovely setting atop a lazy spot on the Hooghly.

Well to be practical the first thing to be said about this place has to be the ambience. Food and service is the best as well. It definitely feels you're in heaven when u drool over that Bloody Mary floating (figuratively) on the Ganges. The buffet spread is another special mention. Desserts in particular. You definitely feel everything is the best especially when u get such a positive and serene atmosphere and ambience out there. Peace.

A breezy air just passed through me, when I entered into the open air space there. You will really feel the Ganges from the top. I had firstly decided for buffet, however open air sitting beside the river is only available for ala carte. Also, the buffet menu is not a n eye catcher one. The food is like another restaurants in the city. The service is good as well as the behaviour. The moral is, if one wants to feel the Ganges  it's good otherwise bllahhh....

The Three Stars are only for the beautiful ambience and the site at which this Floating Hotel (Floatel)is located.Amazing night view of the City and the Hooghly River with an on board /on deck experience....in other words perfect for a quiet romantic evening.
But wait...... there's trouble in paradise and it's a big one too!😠......and it's the food.
I had already read reviews and decided not to order the buffet.
I ordered ala carte spaghetti and fish Beer to wash it down (literally). Quantity was too less with no special taste.Food = 1.0.Period.
Absolutely unworthy of the price they charge.
Service is otherwise good.

Food quality not good - rice was half cooked. Food options very less as well. Why keep rice only on one side when it's a common item?

Called in & booked seat 24hrs in advance still didn't get the one I requested for. Went there for a special anniversary dinner but the place & it's people didn't make us feel special at all. I know how a buffet works but the staff could at least wish 'happy anniversary'. No one even asked whether we were having a good time or the food was okay.

Tables placed inside are too small for 3 people. We could barely accommodate the plates.

This was my first visit but my special evening was spoilt. I felt I shouldn't have selected this place for dinner. For a 4 star hotel, the experience was NOT up to the mark AT ALL. I don't think I'd revisit, nor would I recommend this place to anyone.

Pretty decent. Tried a pretty sparse arrangement, but from my limited scope to understand the place, I'd say the grilled dishes, especially shellfish, is a delight. Plus they serve amazing desserts and cocktails. The boat gimmick wears off soon and the ambiance isn't the very best but the food and, if you get to, the open dining areas are worth absolutely every penny.

Floatel defines Kolkata. You get a view of most things that make Kolkata what it is - the Ganges, the Howrah bridge, the vintage buildings. However, they disappoint when it comes to food and service. We tried their buffet and there was very little to remember them by.

Considering the fact that is the only restaurant in town which actually floats and is situated on the river, the ambience could be well rated as a sight to spend time with.. 
The food was nothing special to talk about. We ordered a Pan Asian Chicken Sizzler which tasted right but was a little less on quality. We also ordered a Non Veg Burger and Mixed Hakka Chowmein which was up to the mark. The Captain Cap Mushroom was although a failure.. 
Considering the nominal price range, the food items were satisfactory.
Although the staff were very cordial and very well behaved, but the service was very slow and took around 20 to 25 mins for each order.. Also the unavailability of a beverage was informed to us 15mins after placing the order..

Visited the place 2:30 am on sunday. The restaurant is open 24 hours but availability of food is not much on odd hours. However, they greeted me well. I had fruit salad, chicken sandwich and soft drink. Ambience is good, location is awesome, and food prices will be steep. Enjoyed my early morning visit.

As you enter the Floatel,its like your are entering inside a cruise ship. The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements. The view of the river Ganga from the restaurant is just spectacular. Food is really good. The waiters and their service was also good. The ambiance is very different and awesome...

Best place to be with your date on 31st Dec night..as the fireworks above Ganges is clearly visible..this place is a 4 for its ambience,scenic beauty,and to make a date worth remembering.. Food is delicious but quite heavy on pocket...we opted for buffet. each item was beautiful but variety is less..more variety to taste buds will be appealing. Also there is no complimentary drinks which if added can make the experience wonderful :-) overall no regrets for a candle lit night well spent on the decks..prior reservation is highly recommended if you want to avoid a long que

I went there around few months back when I was in Kolkata, I must say location and ambiance is excellent no doubt about that. Best part is the open air portion over the river Ganga is just wow and sitting over there at the time of sunset with a glass of a drink is just out of the world. so full 5 for the for the ambiance. 
Now lets come to the food part, food was decent and taste was quite good, I went there with my wife and with my brother and his wife and we have taken buffet. So as per the quantity and quality it was good. Service was also very good, staffs was friendly enough to assist us.
So overall the price we have paid for the food and service for that awesome location was worthy.

A Sunday funday plan with friends. Scenic beauty - amazing. The river has many shades and colours and u see it at its best here. The service is very very poor. The food was decent but very expensive. I think they survive on the buffet. So anything on the ala carte menu needed to be reconfirmed from the kitchen. If u r going for the buffet, the offer on nearby is the best. Pls buy your discount vouchers from there.

First of all, this place has an amazing view. Soothing breeze just adds to your comfort and literally gives you a fine dining experience.
Food was good enough.
But, the service was not at all up to the mark.
Waiter didn't knew much about the dishes.
We kept asking for refilling water.
We asked to replace one dish just 1 minute after we placed order. But the new order didn't got placed.
They served us the water bowl for hand wash after we requested.
They handed us the wrong bill.
While leaving, they were blocking us in a way seemingly asking for tips.
So yes, this wasn't at all what we were expecting from a 3 star hotel. Total mismanagement.
But still, worth a try!

Only their ambiance carries marks for them. Visited 3 times. Everytime I enjoyed their ganges view and khola hawa that is not available anywhere else. 
A must visit place for people who visits kolkata from outside.
I prefer not to go for buffet. They charged 750+tax for buffet. But their variety and taste is not remarkable.
Better to order some different dishes of them. 
Must say I had tried lamb for the first time in floatel. Satisfied.

It's the ambience that might pull you to this place. But , I wish the food was equally good. If you decide to go this place be prepared to pay for the experience and the view . Food totally not worth it. Especially if its buffet and you want to hog , better to go to BBQ nation. You might have the appetite but only with one or two main course items you cannot go on.

My ratings only for the view!

The place is impressive., Clean and good, but if you compare with a high end restaurant of similar cost, then you know its lagging slightly.
Starters were average.

Main-course was lip-smacking, 

We went for lunch.
We preferred to sit 'outside' on the deck. There were tables and chairs laid out there. But were not allowed to sit there, as they said they 'do not serve outside'.
What is the fun when you go to a place, which has main USP that its floating on a river and you cannot sit at a place where you can enjoy the winter-sun and the breeze of river !!
Finally after lunch, lazed around on the open deck, enjoyed the open place, peace of the river and the lazy afternoon sun. This is the key reason for the 2.0 rating.

The fish dishes were amazing. So were the chicken items.
The quantity was also very good. We were two persons, it it was much more than sufficient for us. Ordered a fish item, a chicken item, a chicken pulao.

This place doesn't need any introduction as it's the only and probably the best floating restaurant in India. This restaurant have two parts one is covered up with glasses through which you can see the Ganges and the other one is in open air. Now coming to food. Last week I was their to checkout their buffet dinner. It was quite good variety of foods was quite impressive but the veg portion was not that good. Some preparations like the fried fish and the chicken was awesome. But in dessert that cookies sort of thing and the gajar ka halva was awful. Overall had a great time there.

Located on Strand Road opposite the State Bank of India headquarters this place is definitely one of its kind in Kolkata. Located on a floating ship as evident from its name the place offers great experience for everyone dropping in at this place. The open seating arrangement on the deck is truly magnificent with the Hoogly river being ever present for company. Food is also good enough..prices are a bit expensive but the wonderful view makes up for it. Overall, inspite of a few shortcomings on food quality the wonderful view and unique ambiance offered by the place makes it a must visit place in Kolkata.

The part of heritage Kolkata with most scenic view of Ganges while enjoying food. During winter sitting on outdoor deck can be bit uncomfortable hence we took best seat in house next to huge window pane. Between buffet and ala carte we opted for later. 
In starters had Hour and Sour Chicken Soup, Malaysian Chicken Satay and Fish n Chips. Washed it down with couple of 100 Pipers peg, Foster's, Breezer and Ginger Ale mocktail. Soup and fish was very impressive. Satay chicken lacked proper marination.

In main course had Pan Fried Fish and Moroccan Lemon Chicken Steak. Fish dish was served on bed of spaghetti vegetables which were not sauté properly. But bhetki was fresh and tasteful. Chicken Steak was so though and thick again lacks marination.

Service was shamelessly slow. Captain requested for feedback and on receiving was expressionless. Lacks cleanliness and maintenance. In billing found additional item been added. The final bill gave us a huge shock. It was INR 7902 inclusive all. Pricing at par of 5 star but expect view from restaurant everything else was 2 star category.

I would not suggest to waste an evening there..We went there on Christmas and returned home frustrated and disappointed.

The restaurant probably has the most exotic location in the city and most natural beauty to offer but the food isn't that charming yet. We went there to celebrate our parents' anniversary and must say was very disappointed after the food was served. We opted for the seafood platter and must say there are other joints in the city which offer much better food. Though the desserts were a life saver. And they have very good staff too.

I never want to remember about our experience which we have faced at Floatel. We visited the place late night on 10th November.We were a group of 10 so we have called them to make prior reservation.
To our utter surprise even then there was only 1 Table occupied food took almost 50 mintues to reach the table.As it was festive night we were all busy in chatting and enjoying the lovely open air ambiance
We ordered Mutton Rogan Josh,Chicken Makhni , Peas Pulao,\Paratha and one Pasta.
Lets start with the Mutton(3 Pieces in each portion) @650 whereas one of their senior staff told that they serve 4 pcs in one portion and believe me even if you will use microscopic lens u will not get any meat it is only bone and bone.
Peas Pulao is absolute smoke flavour as it was burnt.
Chicken is absolutely stale which nobody couldn't try.
Intially we wanted speak to the Chef on which a cook came to our table and just imagine his reply,'we donot serve boneless mutton and rest of the food he found absolutely alright.'
Then we wanted to meet the MOD who turned be the Chef Incharge of the Place.He was very apologetic for the whole incident but  just giving 2 nos Brownie he did charged for Bone Lamb@Rs.1300 along with other stuffs.
It was hand written bill as they want us to have the proof and moreover they have charged 22%Tax(Difficult to Calculate for me)
The senior management should look into this as it is nothing but cheating the guest and making sure they should clear the bill before leaving.
They should visit good restaurants to see what hospitality is all about.
I will make sure to speard this to lots of other people and will never visit this restaurant.
Sorry Cheaters

Had always wanted to visit this place for its ambience and food. The ambience was no doubt great, with a beautiful view of the 2 bridges on either side and the Ganges breeze around you. However the food and service was a huge disappointment. The Jamaican jerk fish was over cooked. The very familiar manchow soup could also not live up to any expectation. The choice of menu was also very limited, and its very difficult to even locate the waiter you have assigned to. The only saving grace was the desserts. Cheese was ok.... The coffee crème brûlée was really nice

I have many fond memories of this place. This was THE place to bring a date if you wanted to impress her. The food wasn't ever that great, but who cares. Grab a seat near the massive glass windows, order a fancy drink, some starters and then ask your date to walk out with you to go stand on the deck - and you might even be in a different world.

Ambiance: Exceptionally brilliant. Open air deck facing river Hooghly and having a candle lit dinner with your soulmate...according to me is a perfect way to celebrate the day.
Food Taste: Just ok. 
Price: Costly but recommended for the ambiance.

The open air seating arrangement and the cool breeze from the ganges makes the place more awesome thsn it actually is. The food preparations are quite ordinary and nothing worth a special mention. Had tried the bengali buffet and it was below average. North Indian food too was kind of okay. The service and ambience however are exceptionally good.

Its an ideal place for a romantic candle light dinner with folk songs playing at the background. Buffet is sumptuous. Service is not that good. Go and just have some romantic moments with your loved ones while enjoying food.

Felt like having a great a really overpriced dinner at the banks of the Ganges!!!!

The starters were good!! Others in the buffet not so mentionable!!!

But the view of the Howrah & the 2nd hoogly bridges from the deck, and the nice autumn breeze was really surreal!!!

Well the ambience is ok..nothing wow about it..had gone for a buffet dinner but seeing very less options on the menu had to go for al a carte. I was surprised to see the buffet menu having such less options and such simple dishes on a sunday evening. However, the good thing is the taste of the food is nice. I had expected a better menu and a better ambience.. The seats and tables very simple..nothing fancy compared to the price of food..the ambience of the restaurant is as good as mocambo which is a little surprising.

Well I have always wanted to visit this floating restaurant for its unique location and ambiance. Though i had a doubt about its food. Finally I and my cousin decided to try this joint and booked a table one day back. 
 We reached there at 1.45pm. It is located just opposite to SBI main branch at strand road. 
       It is on the third floor. And the ambiance was just WOW. Large glass windows and beautiful view. The vast Hooghly river, boats, hide and seek between sun and cloud created a mesmerizing view. The seats are very basic with wrought iron chairs and table which were not so comfortable. Though air conditioned temperature was not low enough and no fans were there as a result the temperature was not comfortable at all.
  We were served cool, green mango,sweet and sour mocktail with a dash of lemon. It was very refreshing and soothing. For starter, we had chicken sweet corn soup and Hong Kong bullet chicken. Both of them were really tasty. 
  In main course,we ordered butter naan, matar pulao,daal tadka,paneer butter masala and masaledaar murgh chaap with green salad. Naan was soft and tasted good with paneer butter masala. But daal was pathetic. We couldn't have more than one spoon. Chicken was spicy though edible and average in taste but pulao was too oily with excessive scent(atar). 
  In the meantime we had two different mocktails- blue sea and rose red colored mocktails. Both were good in taste.
  Dessert consisted of rasgulla and to our utter disappointment it was not at all fresh and anybody can say that from its look. 
    Now the important information, after having finished our lunch, the waiter asked me about the food. I informed them about daal and pulao. Next he gave me a card to write my experience and rate their food. When we were about to leave, the manager with the chef rushed to us asking why we rated their food as fair and not good or excellent. I explained my reasons, then manager told me that the chef was bound to answer this low rate before management today in the evening. I said that should be the way to maintain quality of food. The manager and chef tried to manipulate me for sometime but when they failed, they kind of forced me to rate it good and to put a sign over there. This is my worst experience in any restaurant and now i understood why it's condition is so poor.

Perfect destination for a date evening. Open air arrangement on the River Ganges,candle light, cool breeze a great ambience all together. Perfect place to spend good time for couples.
But if you are a foodie I would suggest this is not the right place for you.Food quality not so bad, not so great even.
But the thing I didn't like here is the services.Its actually bit pathetic.
But if you don't think of food,think of a date evening, then Floatel is a good choice.

This is the place for a quiet romantic meal. The restaurant has indoor/outdoor seating. We preferred the indoor seating as the weather was humid. They had good A LA carte menu options. We started out with Rangoli kebab(three types of multicoloured kebab) and Guava delight. The starters and drinks were excellent. Apart from starters, some main course dishes were also great, whereas a few needed improvement. Though Paneer ke dulme and Makkhanwali dal tasted good, I didn't quite enjoy Dum ka paneer, which tasted somewhat bland. Gulab jamun was just average. Overall, we enjoyed our evening @The Bridge. All I can say is that it was much much more than I expected! The ambience is great but the service should be better.

Ambience: ahhh what an ambience open air deck facing howrah bridge and 2nd hooghly bridge at a time with a candle..for my opinion this is the most romantic location of kol for dine in..so all those romantic couple should give it a try once..
Reception:adequate
Food: just thikthak
Price: a bit costly but for the location its reasonable.

1 of the best restaurant I have been to. We took inside sitting since it was sunny outside and really summer hot. You should avoid outdoor unless it's winter or afternoon or evening time. The staffs were super friendly and always ready to help. The food was quality and filling. There were variety of cuisine to choose from. The decoration was authentic. It gave a ship like feel truly. It was really huge. You can spend some quality time there. Would definitely love to go again. Price was okay considering the food and ambience. Definitely worth a try.

I have been to this place several times but the consideration Always had been the location especially on a cloudy day.... The food takes a back seat... For a good reason too. The buffet is nothing great and one pays a premium for the location...  
The food is not bad but not in the same league as the similarly priced places

You might visit restaurants everywhere where they offer you food to tease your taste buds and stuff but this place offers you with the most unique experience that you can ask for. YES THE PLACE FLOATS ON THE GANGES. It is on a dock sort of thing and you know its different from the moment you enter the dock from the lobby. Near by the millennium park on Strand Road besides Babu Ghat railway station and close to Esplanade, this is a very accessible place.
The view knocks down every other restaurant in competition and an evening reservation shall serve your senses just perfect since you get to see the Ganges and the boats and jetty floating past you.
The service is good  and the staff is polite. The seats can be a bit more comfortable(I guess renovation has been carried out so maybe now it is better).
The food is good and will complement to the experience. The only problem is that the place can get a little crowded at times.
Rest this is one really great experience for anyone who loves the river and wants to dine by the side of it.

Went there thrice, twice with parents and once with friends.  While love the novelty of sitting inside a floating restaurant and having food, do not love the taste of food so much. The meat items are too spicy. The desserts are, however, treats. I love their soufflés. 
Otherwise, great place, spacious enough, attentive and courteous staff.

This is a kinda place where I always wanted to be in and have lunch and today my wish got fulfilled. All thanks to you :) . Floatel is basically a floating hotel. It's located on the holy river Ganga and is easily noticed if one travels from howrah station to kolkata via howrah bridge, via strand road and vice-versa. Though we dint have enough space in us to have our main course, but definitely we had some amazing starters and a soup. But firstly, we had a seasonal fresh juice which had almost all the fruits in it, some of which are mango, pineapple and  strawberry. Right next we had a bowl of cream chicken soup, which had small chicken pieces hidden in the thick layer of cream. It was too good. Then we had the starters. We had Malaysian Chicken Satay, it's kinda skewed chicken served with a small bowl of spicy peanut sauce. We also had Golden Crispy Prawns, in them the prawns weren't fried. A new experience. Lastly, a special mention ofcourse. It has an open air seating arrangement exactly by the Ganges. One can go to that place and would get a beautiful view of both the Howrah Bridge and the 2nd Hooghly Bridge on either sides.  The hotel is on a ship. So far, the best hotel in terms of  ambience for me till date. Would visit again, very soon :)

This is pure novelty. The restaurant is indeed floating on the Ganges. The set up is good and the buffet was comprehensive. The taste was okay to decent. I wouldnt rave about it too much and the price not too unexpected. The outside seating was nice although we had to stand up the sun shade at least ten times due to the light river breeze! It would have been good for those things to be firmly fastened to the floor or at least attach a heavy weight at the bottom. That was a waste of time and energy. Also the crows! But can't blame the restaurant for that. Overall a reasonably pleasant experience minus the sun shade ordeal.

This place is no less than a heaven for a perfect romantic date. You first go into a ship through a bridge crossing the Ganges. Its on the third floor of the ship. Then you enter into a never before experience. Please if you are going for a date. go in the evening and sit in the outside area. Table reservation is preferred because you hardly will get place there. From there, you are just on the Ganges, on a ship, having dinner. Doesnt that sounds amazing? The real experience is also like that. You gonna get the entire breeze of the river. You have the entire view of both the Howrah Bridge and Vidyasagar Setu. Dininig experience is mind blowing here. Coming to the food experience.
 Food and Drinks have a large range. Starting from Indian and Continental, they have it all. Buffet is also available. If you are a foodie, try out the wide range of their buffets. Drinks are quite cheap.
I ordered for
House Ceaser Salad- They made it quite nice. Good for a starter.
Fish Cake Cabral-It goes best with drinks.
Drunken Prawn- Its prawn tossed with wine. A dish to die for.
Murg Tikka Nawabi- They made it aveage. I found little salty.
My family ordered for Indian Cuisine which was made equally good even better according to them.
Murg Pakhi Biriyani- A new style of biriyani.
Tandoori roti- Nice
and Narkol Chingri- It was the best of the lot. Try it without any second thought. 

They also have a nice range of Grilled food available only from 11 in the night till 4am. 

Overall:
Ambiance- 100/5 ;)
Service- 3.5/5
Food- 4.5/5
Quality- 4.5/5

I hv never had such a bitter experience while visitng a restaurant. It was one of my friend's birthday and I had pre booked a table for us and had insisted for an outdoor seating.  I had been assured a table on the deck and my booking was confirmed. After reaching the venue we were told that the deck was already full and we had to adjust in a table inside. After informing the manager about my reservation....he told us to wait and after waiting for 10 odd mins we were given a table. Then while ordering the food we were again informed that we can order only from the buffet menu. But we noticed that the nearby tables were being served from the ala carte menu too...neither the waiters were taking our orders nor the manager was attending us. After waiting for 15-20 odd mins...we just got up and left. My friend's birthday was almost ruined....zomato doesn't provide ratings less than zero...otherwise I would hv given a negative rating. I would suggest no one to go...unless u really want to throw ur money into the garbage. Trust me...even the cheapest roadside hotels and food joints have better service than this. It's nothing less than crap...!!!

Me and my girl friend went this December (2014) to Floatel. When we entered we were welcomed by warm waiters and waitresses.Rate was ok.2200 bucks for two. But the food was horrible. Atleast for us. Sukno Lonka( dry chilly) in Chinese rice preparation was completely new thing to both of us. Otherwise ambience was nice, but as a office party was going on, we had a feeling that we are getting out numbered as a couple..

The food tastes well but there are a lot, the management can improve. First of all the staff is untrained and do not respond in time. Secondly, if you are ordering something out of the buffet, it takes them more than an hour to deliver.

This place is overrated. Had it not been on the Ganges, there isn't anything to like about the 'Restaurant'. I wonder why The Bridge - Floatel is so ill maintained! Old and decaying decor, soiled table cloths, poor menu cards and lack of variety in the menu. If you want to satisfy your appetite opt for their buffet which offers you better variety than the Al a Carte. 
Also, try visiting the place if at al, in the evening. At least you would feel less guilty about how we have dirtied the Ganges over the ages. During day time the sight around you hurts with all the dirt accumulated at the shore and those floating on the river. 
Finally the service ! Very ordinary, and surprising specially when the guy is not sure about the differentiation between Long Island Iced Tea & Iced Tea! Tremendous!
I request a revamp on the whole, and to serve the essence of being a restaurant. Stop taking credit of just being floated over the Ganges with 14 Anchors.

The floatel was where we celebrated our first Valentine's day. A superb ambiance in outdoor with candle light dinner and splendid view of Hoogly. The breeze added to the romance. The food was good, although I believe A La Carte would have been better. Service was okayish considering the rush. A must visit.

Damn!!!! The ambience surpasses everything! Awsome view !! If u want to have a memorable eat out! This is the place hands down! Went to have coffee and snacks , food wasn't that great , pricing is also on the higher side but it is understand able as they need to maintain such a wonderful ambience! Overall I would recommend everyone to visit this place once ! Its worth it! 
P.s if anyone is looking for a place for a romantic evening ,do go here!!

Food is not overwhelming the taste is similar to any dhaba you can name but the specilaity is the taste of kolkata which you will feel on the deck where you are dining. The price of food is for the priceless feel that caters you when you step in.

This is the first time I have walked out of a restaurant after being seated. Came here on 1st January, the place was a complete mess. Guests were not being attended when they walk in to the restaurant, waiters are busy setting up table, taking up orders from angry customers and other things which they should have been very efficient in. We were seated in a table which was not even cleaned. After repeated requests, someone came to clean (?) the table. We waited for 15 min to get the menu, similar things happened on other tables where we could hear people shouting at waiters. After 20 minutes, we decided to walk out of the place. To me staffs should be trained well enough to handle guests in a manner where they feel wanted. May not come back here again.

Price is a factor. Too much over priced according to amenities and services. Other than that food is average. Staff behaviour is good, efficient.

I just dropped by for a quick drink & some finger food without even knowing much about the place & awwww, I completely fell for this place. Great ambience,  good food & very well trained staff to attend to us. However this place sparkled the thought that Kolkata needs more of such theme restaurants. Albeit a little offside for the city dwellers but simply worth a visit.

First of it's kind in India.  India's first floating the hotel, the very concept of this will excite you. Once you're in this place, this place a lot to surprise you. Firstly with the incredible view of the old Howrah on one side and the new on the other. The location is amazing. You also get to see the train passing, so in a nutshell you on a ship you can see the train passing by and besides also you can see the vehicles on road. I focused more on the location, now let me tell you about the food.  I had been to the Compass for my cousin's engagement, so we had 'KHAATI BANGALA KHABAR' which was amazing, I loved the food, the best part was the dessert baked gurer rossogolla. So I would recommend you to visit this place late evening when you can enjoy the view and your food.

After reading long and negative feedback about this place me and my spouse went there on our anniversary. We reached the place around 5,the restaurant was mostly empty and the staffs were busy with their own work.There was no one to entertain and as a naive customer of Floatel, we had no clue whether to sit outside on the deck or inside.We prefer to sat outside and later we ordered coffee as we came to knew that the restaurants starts of around 7 before that nothing is available.We chit chatted and loitered around the upper deck and enjoyed the breathtaking surrounding.Around 6.30 our tables were made with blue satin cloth and a romantic candle inside a wooden box..Awesome is the only word that fits here when the dusk falls down.Blue lights and the romantic candle with the Bridges on both side of the Floatel made us speechless. 
Now the food.We both preferred to stay off the buffet as we feared about the negative comments made on zomato ,so we ordered Fried Fish,Tandoori Dhania Chicken,Pasta and Sweet Lime Soda.Fried Fish quality was superb,Tandoori chicken was good and pasta was avearage according to me but rated good by my spouse.So food was good nothing like inedible.

1.There was always a waiter(North Indian ,Spiked Hair) watching over our table candle and as soon as the candle blows off ,he comes running and lights that.Thank you sir it was really special when you come with your smiley face and did it thrice.

2.We were taking selfies and it was difficult as well as awkward to take pictures like that,thank you to the person who took our order(Tall Dark ,Mustache) and later you asked for the camera and asked us to pose and took every care so that you could take that perfect picture.Thank you for making us special.

3.And finally out of excitement i dropped my engagement ring while taking pictures of our ring down below the deck(Me and my spouse looked at each other for a second as if a nuclear blast has taken place),now another waiter(Bengali gentlemen) came to me, seeing this he took two security guards and we all ran downstairs and to that place where my ring was and found it ,i was so much happy seeing his efforts.He later asked me if it was any special occasion that we both were celebrating ,i informed them about our anniversary and later while paying the bill ,the coffee and biscuits was offered as complimentary and he wished us happy anniversary.

So we had an evening which was something we will cherish for the rest of our life.Thank you Floatel.

There's really only one reason to come to Flotsam Hotel... To leave asap.

Service is so egregious, it's comical.
Food is so insipid, it's depressing.
Prices are so absurd, it's angerfying.

Decor can only be described as "90s commie meets trashy street bum".

If you do go for river sundowners... Smuggle in your drinks and leave asap.

Had a terrible experience on valentine's day. Very poor spread especially starters. Food was cold and some of the items which were over took more than 45 mins to be replenished.
Service was so pathetic. No one came to offer water or breads at the table.
And to end it all, it took them 30 mins to try and arrange for a bill, which they could not. So I ended up paying 2900 for horrible food, pathetic serfice, cramped up seating and walked away with no bill.

The river Ganges adds uniqueness to the hotel-restaurant. Why haven't anybody else come up with something like this, I wonder? The perfect romantic setting for any couple. Having said that, the ambience is the only USP of this restaurant. Foodwise, I have always found it pretty average and also exorbitantly priced.

Out of the 4.5, I will rate this place 3 for its ambience and location. Placed on the bank of river ganges, this is the ultimate romantic lunch/dinner spot for couples. Though I have visited this place with family too, but the feel wont be the same. Buffet for 1000+ is really worth. A hell lot of items and you will keep searching for place in your tummy after starters only. Drinks are a bit expensive but you can always opt for a margarita to add to the nature's supremacy. The roof top pulls me each time and this one place in kolkata, I miss a lot staying away from city.

Just don't know where to begin... I too wish if there was a way for the negative rating like jennifer, i'd have given it -5.

Me & my fiancée went to the bridge today to celebrate the 1st jan,2015, and cheers to them that they made it fully spoiled. 

We didn't go for the buffet, So when we got the menu, we simply stunned. There was nothing for the food menu, in the after sunset menu section there was only sandwich, chops N toasts ...
Can you believe it ??? when i asked is it the only thing available, the waiter replied yes, and then went to have a chat with the manager. Then he came back and said pasta might be available, i was kind of looking at him, 'coz I really had nothing to say. Then again his manager shouted, it's not available. Then he again ran, came back and said, chow mein might be available.
I mean they don't even know what is available N what isn't.. Then are not even aware of the menu even.
I got frustrated and asked to get the buffet menu, and

What the F......   1250+taxes for what ???
fish kalia.. sabji.. dal.. Rice.. my goodness.. 
Feeling like where am i..?? am i seating in a dhaba of a footpath... 

and it'll better if i don't talk about the price.. I really don't know what will i write then..

I had no choice but to choose a 650 carlsberg beer and a 30ml. smirnoff with soda for my Fiancée without anything else.

apart from this experience, the staffs/manager were shouting like they were in slums, and moving the chairs and tables making so noise.. 
Trust me i would had a better experience if i would have gone to any street fast food center.
They call themselves 4 star, they don't deserve 0.

Guys it's an advise from my end that please don't even dare to go there unless you want to simply waste a big amount of money just for the view of ganges, seating outside in rooftop, and want to have a candle-night dinner with your special one (though the night will never be special i bet you).
Overall it was horrrrrrrible N patheeeeetic..

I wanted to give 1.0, just because they atleast served the food which was ordered. But increased the rating only because of the location and view. Each and every other thing about the restaurant is BAD. Food is extremely overpriced and quality/taste does not conform to price. Even the decor seems quite worn out. Staff was unaware of the ingredients of a few dishes. Avoid this place at any cost.

I had booked the deck for a special evening u make sure that you will have to call 10000000 times to reach the manager and each time u call wait to a min of 15 mins for him to come online despite he doesnt turns up and on top he should throw his personal contact num which he will never on earth receive ! Complete pathetic foood guys its a sincere request plz never visit this place !!

Food - No complaints.  But very standard food. Something that you may get in a restaurant located in Central Kolkata.  Nothing great. Price - Exorbitant.  Price does not match with the food served. I certainly do not look forward to visit that the next time.

A lot could be done about this place to make it seem even close to a doable place to dine in. 
The service is one of the worst in the city. I am sorry but I don't think that bringing a different theme to Kolkata gives you the right to be so lackadaisical towards your customers and that too at the face of oodles of money being poured down for no good reason.

The chairs in the open area are rusted and broken. How can you afford to serve people in this manner is beyond me.
We went for the buffet after looking through their menu where we found nothing to our liking. 
The buffet had the most distasteful spread ever @Rs 1200. Worst buffet ever! I've got nothing to talk about.  

The only thing good about this place is the boat like feeling that you get while you are on your way to the restaurant.

Truly speaking, you guys should close.

P.S. - thanks for making my anniversary less memorable. I wish there was a way to give you guys a negative rating.

A much more elaborate menu than other parts with a lot of choices of Italian and chinese main course dishes. A tad more pricey too. However the seating arrangements are more comfortable and spacious with a great view. no difference in food though. It's all excellent! Do visit if you want to have the luxury of choices in the menu and try something different.

I gave a 3 for the view of the Ganga! It is breathtaking. The sublimity of the place is diametrically opposite to the banality of the food that is served here. I tried the breakfast buffet which was complimentary with the stay here - looked very up to the mark with a decent Indian and Continental fare, along with cereals, milk, juices, fresh fruits, sprouts, average tea cakes and croissant - good try but taste and quality wise shockingly commonplace!
The dinner buffet repeated the same dismal story.
The staff is courteous, quite a bit actually. But the place hits you as being overpriced because you really do not get any value for money. You end up paying for the romance of the ganges, staring at the backdrop of a city skyline that is fading into nostalgia and longing, just like the food that leaves you craving for more!

Location is superb and thats what i am rating it 3 for i guess. Having dinner floating on the hooghly river has its own delight.

Ambience is good but as the lighting and windows go its looks better at night than at day. So if you are looking for a romantic dinner after a fight then this is the place for you.

Food is very cheap and i dont mean money wise. Food here tastes like any other ordinary food that you get at a restaurant around the corner. And thats a bummer.

Service is also average and the staff is quite good except their bongali discussions which you can here from a mile away.

Price..... Man are you kidding...!!! Hilariously over priced. A note to the management ... Guys your price tags are not at all at par with your service and food.

PATHETIC FOOD PATHETIC SERVICE reminds you of Rajdhani service or may be rajdhani is better in service!!! Shitty food the food on the streets close to floatel serves better food!!! Highly priced for crap!!! It's not that I am writing on my first time, I gave them three visits and nothing improved!!!! The mentality of the people there is very shitty, the only positive is the Hooghly river!!! Hope I could rate them a zero!!! The buffet cold the breads arrive after a year!!! Starters served cold and super salty!!! They replaced a dish with noodles which had oil and noodles!!! Vegetables were a treasure hunt!!!!

Flotel is an awesome place to dine in. This place has an incomparable ambiance. This
is a restaurant with a theme, on the heart of Ganges. The evening view of Ganges
having dinner just creates memory. The food quality is descent too. I am quite
satisfied having dinner here. The evening view of Ganges will surely bring me
here few times.

Sitting regally on the Hooghly, the upper deck ( just above the restaurant, easily accessible to all guests) offers the most breathtaking view of the Howrah Bridges (both old as well as the new) and of the river in all its glory!
The service is good and the food delicious. The price tag, though considerably on the higher side, is justified by the unique luxuries that it provides to foodies and travelers alike.
All this (and the fact that its a round the clock facility) make The Bridge at Floatel a place you show off to your star gazed cousins flying in from Mumbai!

Why do anyone want to go to floatel ?? Odd location! Not even closer to a multiplex or even a shopping mall..!
Because..here we are talking about a romantic hangout :)
Fristly, the location. Yes, the address is a bit odd. But nothing can be better than to enjoy a luxury date above the Ganges (true beauty). The open air lounge is great too.
Let's come to the food now. I was on for a Special Puja Buffet Dinner. Again floatel stood up to the xpectation. The buffet menu list goes on with Chicken and paneer kebab as starters, pulao, bagda chigrir malaikari, doi hilsha, mutton daak-banglow, chicken kasha, 4 types of chatni at the end. And as it's known, everything is unlimited. The story concluded with Misti doi and sandesh. (some more dishes where there, which my brain refused to remember).
Service was also good. A bowl of mutton specially given to my family, though they were running out of it.
1200/- with tax what they asked for each. Well apparently it seems to be in a bit higher side. But logically considering king prawn, hilsha and mutton; it seems like Okky.
Enjoy.

Good food , excellent ambience ( river view , love their open air dinning arrangements on the deck ) , good service . This hotel is made inside an unused old ship on the banks of Ganga .  Its an ideal place for a date or a casual hang out with friends . Foods are really great . Try their fish and chips , mr. Brown's ball curry . Dont miss their chicken country captain and prawn masala circuit house along with white wine or white rum ( two of my personal favourite dishes here and a must ) . U can try chicken takari and rampuri sheikh as well . All the food tests fine . They serves a wide range of alcohol as well . I highly recommend this place for date or a dine out , you will never regret .
Costs around 1800 to 2500 for two .

Highly overpriced . You pay for the fact that you are dining or lodging on a worn out damp barge modified into a hotel . The buffet spread is boring with a repetition of dishes which might have different names but taste similar . The food is just ordinary for which just don't deserve such a price tag. Its a better value for money if you take a boat ride with some food and a bottle of beer packed for the half an hour lazy ride on the Ganges

Won't recommend to anyone. Price is unnecessarily and inexplicably high. You might end up scratching your head what r u being charged so highly for. Except for the location there is nothing praiseworthy. Their service is so downmarket that i) they served starter at the end of our meal ii) added shrimp to my specially ordered egg noodle without my consent iii) tried to convince me that it would enrich the taste (I might be allergic to shrimp, don't know how they were going to convince me then) iv) served soupy noodle to my husband who ordered hakka noodle v) couldn't provide a straw to a lemonade glass for which they charged us hundred rupees. If you value your hard earned money then stay away from this place or if you have more than you need then go for it.

The idea of floating on the river and having a meal, spending time with your friends and family, is the only thing that helps this restaurant to sell. The food is terrible and the service is worse. The bridge to reach the restaurant itself is inconvenient to walk on, especially for the elderly. The restaurant deserves points for the idea, implementation, beauty, decor and to an extent the (i.e. if you're lucky) some edible dishes.

Floatel is one of the worst places to visit ever! I've been here twice and both times bad experience. The first time their beverages tasted like river water. We didn't say anything although our drink was absolutely inedible.
The second time I went there with 4 of my female colleagues and was trying to have a peaceful Friday when a kid continously came and disturbed us at our table, made faces, shrieked and pushed our chairs. Then their parents came to our table and began screaming and attacked us literally when we told the kid to not irritate us. Floatel security did nothing. Especially Mr. Nayak/Naik said since they are guests that they are right and women should not talk only! Men were coming to our table to harrass us while we four sat there. This place is highly unsafe for women. Their hospitality is terrible and the people visiting as well as location are shady and unruly. Save yourselves and do not visit! Worst experience of my life.

Once of the most unique dinners I've ever had! With the whole restaurant on a ship floating in water and the city on view, it surely was memorable. Ambience is incomparable. The food was also very good, with a large variety of choices. Service was commendable too. Though it is on the expensive side, its a small price to pay. Two thumbs up from me!

Visited this place during Christmas with one of our guests who had come from Chennai. 
During this time Kolkata is always decked up, looking pretty and all. So, naturally no one is ever in a mood to study or work. 
Thus, we all decided to visit Floatel for a nice dinner. 

The ambience is very beautiful and that gets multiplied by 10 times if you can grab a table in the open air outside so that you can get a view of th river. 

We reached this place around 7:30-8:00. Upon reaching we were surprised to find a table in the open air. We all jumped and grabbed it.xD
It was quite chilled outside but nonetheless we were loving the view with cruises passing by and cracking crackers in the sky. :)

Now coming to the main aspect which is FOOD. 
We were 5 people and instead of any further nuisance, we all went for the buffet which was 1200 per person. 

To start it off, there was a live counter of tandoori items which served us our starters on the table.
1) Chicken Malai Tikka : Pretty normal but very soft.

2) Mutton Burrah Kebab : Even if I dont like mutton, I loved this. I drooled for even more and had almost 4 pieces at a go.xD

3) Chicken hariyali : I have never seen such a bright green tikka. Haha. But it was a good sight. It tasted very good too!

4) Tandoori Aloo and Tandoori babycorn : They did not have any starters for our vegetarian guests or vegetarians but on asking for it, they immediately made these which was quite appreciable. Tandoori aloo was nothing but babg potatoes marinated in tandoori masala and then grilled. Tandoori babycorn tasted like chilli babycorn but both were delicious though the aloo was a bit dry. 

Now, the buffet. 
1) There were three types of salads. 
a) Macroni salad : Good but a bit dry.
b) Chickpea salad : I have never liked chickpeas so it's obvious that I did not like this salad too. It was almost like what we call "aloo kabli".
c) Russian Chicken Salad : I love Russian Chicken Salad and it was indeed very delicious with the right amount of mayo and cream. Nothing was overpowering In it. Just perfect. 

2) The live tandoor section was also serving naans, laccha parathas and tandoori rotis. We went for naans, laccha paratha and kulchas.

IN THE VEG SECTION. :-
1) Tempura Fried Vegetables : This was amazing. Crisp fluffy coatings with vegetables inside. Loved the tempura fried spinach the most.;D

2) Dal Makhni : Very smooth and buttery with a slight charred flavour. 

3) Kashmiri Dum Aloo : Delicious with a slightly sweet taste. 

4) Mixed vegetable (Don't remember the name) : It had mushrooms in it and I liked it. 

5) Paneer Makhanwala : Smooth rich tomato buttery gravy with soft pieces of paneer in it. Good. 

6) Aloo Gobhi : Good.

7) Jeera Rice : Basmati rice, it was. 

Now. The non veg section. 
1) Penne Alfredo : it was for the vegetarians too. I found it a bit bland. 

2) Fish in lemon butter sauce : Thick pieces of bhetki in this buttery sauce. Heavenly. 

3) Chicken Biryani : Kolkata style biryani with soft pieces of chicken accompanied by delicious potatoes. 

4) Mutton Rogan Josh : The showstopper for the day. AMAZING. The best Rogan Josh I have ever had. Just amazing. 

Now the deserts.
1) Dahi Vada : Soft vadas dipped in dahi with imli chutney and bhujiya. Nice.

2)Gajar ka halwa : Delicious.

3) Chocolate mousse : Good. 

4) Mango mousse cake : This was just amazingly delicious. Not too sweet but perfect for the taste bud after a heavy dinner. Soft fluffy cake bases layeres with a thick layer of mango mousse. Scrumptious. 

The only sad thing is that they don't serve any complementary drinks.
The staff were well behaved and verg helpful. 
:)
An amazing evening. :))

This place has got quite a hype since it's opening, planned to visit and finally made it. 

This place I suppose is actually just about the hype! 
Apart from the ambiance and scenic beauty, there's nothing "so" great about this place. 

Coming to the point, 
I guess there seems just no point in writing about the sub-standard food that I just encountered few hours back.  
Meh. :-\ 

To summarize, 
Buffet options available. 
Opted for A la Carte, 
Few dishes tasted as if they were just cooked for the sake of it! 
Nearly bland. High on salt. Oily. Aargh! 

And a few were great to taste. 
Hoping to see a much needed improvement in the rest. 

I mean seriously, I just don't even feel like talking about the dishes. 
They weren't worth the pocket pinch I suffered. 

The staff was definitely courteous and yes, they personally did take a note of the negatives. 
Hope they are looked into and resolved by the management. 

At the moment, the verdict stands as: 
Over-hyped, overpriced! 

An average experience.  
(Thanks to the ambiance, few dishes, staff interaction regarding the flaws) 

A revisit is on my cards, hoping for improved services and a happy stomach.

One of the best scenically beautiful restaurants. A must try. One of the few restaurants where the veggie items are as good as the non veg items. Sit in the open and enjoy your meal, we have had loads of AC indoors already. :P  . The friend chicken is a must try.

The Bridge is on The 3rd floor of Floatel which is on the bank of river Hoogly. The view (with two giant bridges, small and medium boats, and lovely breeze) from the deck is really awesome . We were there at the time of sunset. Service is quite good, though the price is little bit high as per the food quality. The lunch time gets over at 3:30 pm, after that only chinese food were available, but on the basis of our request they managed to serve us continental also. It is a nice place to visit with your loved ones as well as with your family.

Ambience of the bridge is simply breath-taking as it gives you the majestic view of the Ganges! Nowhere in this city would you find a restaurant having the similar concept and hence it stands out! The service here is quiet okay :) Now coming to the food... I have had the buffet once and it did not satisfy me! The spread was good but the food was not well prepared! On another vacation we ordered kebabs and yes they were good :) for main course that day we concentrated on continental cuisine and it was horrible! so yes this is certainly not the place to have continental! the food pretty much over priced too!

To good to try different continental foods. Though its a bit heavy on pocket still it's manageable apx.₹ 2000 per head of you take dinner.
The hotel is actually a ship standing still on Ganges so the view of the surroundings is a treat for eyes. And the service is also to good.

I quite like this restaurant because it is a bit different. I do not like the entry because you have to be careful of water on the floor but for we are going to a restaurant on an actual barge, aren't we? So I guess its my own problem! Regarding the decor, it is quire decent inside and between your meal and your desert it is nice to stand outside and feel the breeze of the Ganga on your face. Now I shall come to the food. It is actually very good. Chicken kebabs are tender and with very nice flavor. The rotis are soft and good. The gravies are tasty and the Biriyani is very good. But I am especially fond of the Panchmeli Daal which lives up to its name and is a nice dish to order if you are having Jeera Rice. It is definitely worth a visit if you stay in Kolkata!

It is extremely sad that being a fun enthusiast I had not visited The Bridge, Floatel until two weeks back. The visit was one of those random decisions for desserts in the middle of the night. In fact, till date I have not been narrated about an exhilarating food experience here. It was my time to decide. 

We landed up at the Bridge at about 1 am. It was empty and I was glad. There was the Ganga flowing its steady path, the breeze from it calming everything around down and one order of tiramisu on the table with us chatting away to glory. 
A bite of the tiramisu and I understood why my friends hated the food. The dessert was not cold enough, much on the harder side, and the coffee flavour overtly powerful and uncomfortable. It tasted like a bad pastry put together with the ingredients of a tiramisu. We finished it with some effort. 

I will visit floatel for its ambience all over again a million times, and will strictly stick to only alcoholic beverages where all the six senses will be pleased.

The 1st thing i liked about this place..its location..on the Ganga, which provides a lovely view while munching. The restaurant is not high on decorating and the ambience is normal if  you cancel out the window views. I tried their buffet for which you have to pay a hefty 999+tax (luxury dining..bleh) but the dishes were very tasty. offering around 5 odd number of salads they covers both Chinese and Mughlai items (both veg and non veg) in the buffet and the menus keeps on changing. I liked their biriyani which was mildly fragranted and the mutton kosha which was very well cooked but tasted rather homely which i liked but thats me, some others expecting a Golbari Kosha standard would be dissapointed. After the main course They had the traditional Gulab Jamuns and pastries and fruits as desserts, all tasting good. However they can increase their options in the desserts section. Overall, If you are a tourist, you can visit to get a glimpse of the ganga from the Bridge which looks magical at  night. But as per food, its good but not a must have kind. For that money you will get far better food in many restaurants in Park Street.

I had been to this place twice- once during the DURGA PUJAS when they had this saptami/astami/nabami special buffet spreads and once for dinner with friends on a weekend. However,on both the occasions what was most attractive and engaging was not their food but the surroundings and ambiance . One cannot just beat the gorgeous view especially in the open dining area with the breeze teasing your hair and the constant lapping of the river water tantalizing your senses . Having said that I would also add that the food is really not all that great and infact a letdown given the price and expectations . Yet I would say it a must visit for all the ganges-romantics around atleast for once .

This place is all about the hype for it being India's first floating hotel but its not that great.  Good scenic place. Food was good too although the prices were bit on the higher side.The buffet has significantly less dishes than what is available in other restaurants for the same price. People should avoid taking the open air tables in summers.

This place is way below average. When I descended the ramp down from the jetty leading in to the floating hote I was quite inpressed. Then I thought to myself, that the places looks good and seems impressive so the food is likely to be good. I was excited. But The Bridge was utterly disappointing. The food was very similar to what any average caterer would serve at a reception meal. If they could even match the standards of say a Bijoli Grill or a Ananda Caterers or some such caterer having high standards I would have been more than satisfied. The cooking mediums did not come across as good as did not the main ingredients themselves. Everything except the steamed rice and chutney was excessively oily, the paturi was not as pungent as I would have prefered and the mutton kasha was not quite up to the mark. Only the chutney, aamer chutney, was good with a fair sprinkling of garam masala atop.
Personally I would not recommend this place. But you could just go to see if your opinion matches mine.

The pricing is definitely not reasonable which would have been fine had the food been out of the world, which it is not. In order for the place to become a VFM restaurant, they definitely work on the food to justify the above average prices.

Places like this in Kolkata are rare - open air , along the Ganges and offering a splendid view.
The open air bit is of course because Kolkata has the most dreadful humid weather possible therefore - unless it rains , its difficult to be in this place in summer months or even non summer months. Winter again is too cold to sit out!
Therefore such places don't have adequate opportunities to blossom!
However, my experience having gone to this place twice, has been really nice!
Its an amazing venue for a date, provided its breezy and cool and you can get a seat on the deck. The service is fine and the drinks are really nice. The food is alright as well but nothing really can beat the ambience of the flowing waters of the Ganges on a beautiful moonlit night against the backdrop of the restaurant.

A big recco for this place then! Weather can't really be helped can it? Go here for an experience worth shelling out money for!

Recently we booked their compass room with adjunct roof. Total no of guest were around 45. It was a horrible experience. Food quality, quantity and services were so poor- it is difficult to express. It was an embarrassing situation at all. Biriyani was one of the same which was served without chicken. Enough sweets were not provided. Guests were waiting for food for a long time. If you are thinking to book for party, my request to think twice before otherwise one has to face the same situation.

Honestly, the food is nothing out of the world but I am a bit biased about this place. This was where I went for my first date and (I know I sound corny to the core) found my true love. 
The rating is due to the ambiance. The setting. It's super romantic. 
The interiors have a classy feel and the food is above average. 
The lamb is great, and they have a wide range of drinks and desserts. As for the rest leave it to the Ganges to do the trick.

I had heard good about the restaurant. No wonder the place looked good. But... do not go there for good food and/or hospitality.
Though I got reservation (for 5 people) done 6 hrs. before the arrival, they seemed to have given all river side seats to their seemingly patrons and suggested us to sit at a non sea side table. After waiting for some 15-20 mins we finally got the desired table. We chose to go for a la carte,  the waiters suggested to go for buffet as orders may take time. But we chose not to opt for buffet. We ordered starters first. It was supposed to be surved with hummus sauce, as mentioned in the menu, but we had to ask them separately for that! The other starters were also not accompanied with respectice sauces/dips unless explicitly reminded. The main course was continental and nothing tasted good :( I shoud say the main course was pathetic. You can probably go there for some tea or coffee and enjoy the serenity. Thats it.

This is a place you go to for the ambience, for celebrating occasions and for formal dates. 

The food here varies between average to good. Nothing that would stay with you after you leave the place. The usual fish, assortment of rice and nans, mutton and chicken in Indian. There is a continental bit too which I missed out, and wish to rectify in the near future. 

The ambience is something quite unique and the USP of this place, it is a floating restaurant on the Ganges. The car parking facilities are adequate I felt and one has to walk down a plank to reach the restaurant. 

We went to celebrate a birthday and the staff were happy to oblige with our on the spot request for a birthday cake, complete with sparklers, that made us very happy. 

The pocket pinch was bordering on the ouch, 4000 rupees for a group of four. But for occasions, one really does not mind, especially given the ambience.

I wish this restaurant offers cruises in the near future, which would add the much needed oomph to the dining experience.

Basically the food is very bad... The service is very slow... Last time i visited floatel i got my bill after 30min or so..after asking them for several times.. As i was in bit hurry.
For me..if you only want to feel the scenic beauty...floatel is your place... But apart from that its costly.. And food are not at all upto the mark as per the price they charge...thumbs down for Floatel.

Went for a dinner date on 14th jan.. 
Well to start of the ambience was excellent. Open sky with the full moon grooming the river nd the candle lit table proved to be the best ambience for the evening. 
Coming to the food..  The quality of food was okay okay.. The service was good but a bit late. Special mention of the Mocktail Cinderella, it was definitely one of the best mocktail I tasted recently..
In total had a wonderful experience ..
A perfect place for a candle light dinner

Floatel....loved the ambience.,..its too good , amazing...I must say ambience of floatel floored me! Now coming to the food...I went with my boyfriend . we sat on the deck side of the restaurant with a tiny candle lighting up slowly slowly, it worked as a cherry on the cake. We ordered the mocktail first "Cinderella" ...aahh!!! It was fresh n juicy n tasty...loved it..then came our "Tom Yang (chicken) " soup ...it was superb,must say one the best soups i have tasted yet. Coming to the main course we ordered "Lachcha paratha,tandoori roti,chicken makhni and boondi raayta" . Paratha was good , chicken makhni was okay okay sort of and raayta was better of all ... So overall it was a wonderful experience....looking forward to go there again. :)

We wanted to go to Floatel for sometime and could finally make it on new year's day 2014 for lunch. We decided to go for "New Year Special" buffet priced at Rs 999 + taxes. The view of the Hugli from the corner table was breathtaking and we were glad to be there.  Unfortunately that quickly simmered with every sip of the yucky Tom yum soup and every bite of the cold chicken pieces. The salad was good but the buffet spread left a lot to be desired,  both in terms of quantity and quality.  The spread was limited to a couple of non veg continental chicken and fish and limited vegetarian items including malai kofta and pulao. No naan or roti to go with them today. Equally disappointing dessert platter. All in all a forgettable outing and definitely not the way we wanted to start off the year.

What can I say about this place, it's just breath taking if you talk about ambience and sorrounding. The hotel is literarly floating on the shore of Ganges. Once you reach you need to take an iron bridge to enter the main building which is on water.

We went to The Bridge, a beautiful restaurant located on the top floor of the hotel. Decorated with timepieces out of sailors equipments. The restaurant decoration however can be little confusing. Wooden finish, sailing equipments and on the other hand center buffet counter decorated with modern bread sticks, garlic and chilies on rope. But leaving alone the minute details, OMG! Sitting near the glass window watching the river, lightened up with stars shining up above. Priceless.

When we went it was raining and there was leak in roof, the waiter were keeping ice buckets near the bar counter to collect water. Once the rain stopped we went outside and as always it was just amazing, long stretch of river, able to see the howrah and rabindra setu bridge was an opportunity never to be missed.

We took our waiters advise to order food. He got us angara chicken, it was bonesless chicken fillets grilled in tandoor, served with onion, mini salad and mint curd chutney. The chicken was soft and the spice marination was seasoned well. Overall a good dish.

Now comes the main course. The waiter got us Thai fish curry and butter naan. I did question about the weird combo of Thai mild white sauce curry and Indian flat bread but he said it will taste good (I still didn't trust him but went with his choice).

Just to point something out here the cutlery used while eating starters and side plates were not removed when main course arrived even after telling the waiters twice.

The main course as I doubted was not worth eating. First, the combo was not at all made for each other. Second, the fish was too fishy. I couldn't eat even one piece properly and had to leave the food untouched.

We didn't go for desserts, but we ordered pinacolada and virgin mojito. The mojito was well made and tempted me to repeat the order.

The restaurant on the pricey side and will leave a hole in your pocket.

Will I go again? Yes, to try few other dishes

Food is fine but rates are a tad higher and I had expected the decor and ambiance to be slightly cosier. The location is the take away. We had gone for lunch and the place is suited for people looking forward to spend a day away from the crowd but it must be better at night. We had continental food and I confess I did have better food at cheaper rates with better ambiance.

I have been to floatel only once to celebrate my 2nd year anniversary. Ambience is marvellous the place is very well decored. We got to sit on the deck very peaceful & soothing ganges breeze was flowing by.
We ordered palak dhigry curry masala kulcha & lamb rampoori seekh kebabs. All tasted really well & fresh but the place is too much expensive, otherwise very well experience.

Floatel is out of order. On the new year eve I paid 1099+taxes per head (buffet dinner) for the following:
• undercooked chicken slices
• the menu tags were misplaced, so if you picked up a mixed pickel salad you actually had seafood salad in your plate
• I even pointed this out to the waiters, too busy they were to fix it
• taste being relative, I couldnt relate to it on any of the items, from turkey breast to prawn in white sauce to duck liver to rice 
• no spoon for desserts, one had to seek the waiter and ask for it
• cheese cake platter was totally empty and it took a customer to bring it to the attention of the staff
• not much variety in desserts either, too many cakes, the kiwi strawberry cake was good however 

Seems floatel only has the location to boast about. 
The difference between a good restaurant and a fantastic restaurant is the management. Long way to go when you consider similar restaurants within the same price bracket. 
I forgive you floatel. This too shall flow.

The best ambiance you could imagine you'll get here. The river Ganges in the back and the fantastic inside ambiance made it score so high in my review. The service was also fantastic. We have visited this place on Saraswati Puja, 1st we thouht it would be crowded as the other restaurant was on that day. But we were lucky enough to get seats easily. We have ordered one Pene Alfredo with Hakka Noodles, the service was very quick and the food was also very nice in both quality and quantity. Then we got a very nice time on the bridge view side. For me this experience was enough to make that day. I request all food lovers to give it a try atleast. Thank you.

The Bridge, located on the third floor of Hotel Floatel, opposite Calcutta Swimming Club, on Strand Road, boasts an amazing location, view and feel but the food disappoints equally !!!!!

The place has a good seating capacity divided in a large closed area and a small open air seating space. The former has a decent decor and i would suggest one to take seats beside the huge window panes. The real deal is the open air space being located on the third floor of the vessel anchored into the river waters. But on the other hand, i feel the hotel hasn't done justice to this area and compromised on the decor and arrangements with seats being very uncomfortable and tables being that of plastic and quite small. The only plus is that the mgmt hasn't congested this area with a lot of tables.

Coming to service, the staff lacks mannerisms and isn't polished. The service for ala-carte is toooo slow. Floatel being a 4 star hotel, one expects much higher standards. The prices being on the higher side at par with other 4/5 star hotels, one is disappointed further.. (Prices are at par with durbari of swissotel, aromas of kenilworth but lower compared to taj, itc)

Food is a disappointing factor. The menu engrosses lots of cuisine but limited options under each which is acceptable to me if what i order delights my taste buds but alas, that is not the case here. Kebabs are very average and there is no kebab platter on offer. Chinese starters are good especially the spring rolls which i love. Indian vegetables are not that good and dal makhani is below average. Veg biryani is nice though, with lovely flavors. I feel chinese main course tastes better and is comparatively more value for money. 

Bridge, only banks on the location and view which makes me rate it at a 3.5 instead of 2.5 coz otherwise, it fails on all counts. They have a few options in coffee at decent prices and the place being open 24 hours, could be a delightful option for a midnight coffee.

Recently I was on a trip to Kolkata and was browsing Zomato for some Candle Light Dinner Restaurant with good ambiance and food. The Bridge  Floatel was the best option and hence decided to visit this place.
I called one day before to book my table and the person was very helpful as he booked my corner table and informed me suitable timings to come for a better view and menu.

As I entered in the restaurant, I asked them about my booking and one person took me to my table. The restaurant was not at all crowded, but only few tables were occupied. As soon as I entered the open area, the view was jaws dropping. Cool Breeze, full city view, Howrah bridge, peaceful and cool place. It is one of the perfect place for a perfect date ^_^ .

Coming to the food, we ordered 2Fosters and they served some complimentary cheeselings. 
Then we ordered "Murg Anagara Begdi" : It was delicious, quantity was less (only 6 pieces)  but was quite heavy. 
And "Shanghai Noodles (Non Veg)" : Noodles were also very delicious, perfectly cooked and dipped in Gravy. Quantity was upto mark for 2 people. 

As I belong to New Delhi, so we just decided to have a candle light dinner on my every visit to Kolkata. 
I strongly recommend this restaurant to all and for every age group. :) 

In the end Thank you Floatel for m first official awesome and Perfect Date. :)

This restaurant has an emotional value attached with me as it was the venue for my first date and yes it was special indeed. Food, ambience, service everything was on the mark and the deck was an icing on the cake. The view of the river while having your food was amazing. The location is the main USP of this place which cant be matched by any of the restaurant in Kolkata.!

The decor is old world without being classical.

The restaurant has gifted the food lovers with an exhaustive menu list that includes Chinese and Indian. Though boasting off mainly with their chineese ,as the Indian menu is rather sparse, but the items are good enough, especially the Chelo Kebabs. Don’t miss the “Bar” in the restaurant’s name - It has a purpose. That’s what draws the huge population who love their meals to be washed down with some strong liquid. From beer to rum and everything in between, you’d find it here. They also make cocktails, & very cost-effective ones at that.

It was a fine evening of June, I went there for a different dinner experience with my best friend..It was a Friday so took reservation earlier...we enjoyed the ambience a lot..Bridge is a round shaped dining place,it can't be called a 5star but must a 3star...The Calcutta skyline,the floating boats, dark night and the glittering 2nd Hooghly Bridge_these will be in ur view if u r lucky enough to get a seat at window side...

Now its about foods!..
We asked for crab preparation,but we didnt get it..it was disappointing.but we njoyd the chicken breast salad...it was rly lovely..besides we had ch tandoori,butter naan,prawn preparations and mocktails....food can be rated 3.5/5...it was good..neither ordinary not too good..but its all about a differnt experince.....

I visited the place this Nabami..We planned 2 hav a kinda romantc lunch,but alas..It was overcrowded!!I didnt expect so much crowd..It has got a fantabuls ambience..U can eat and watch the Ganges outside.I suppose there is an open air sitting system also(nt sure) nbt that day it wasnt there due to rain..Coming to food,we went 4 Bengali buffet spread..I tried the following:
salads:batabi lebu-lonka, sprouts,chhana..all of them were good
Fried fish:awesome!
radhaballavi:good
alur dom:good
chingri malaikari: good
polao: not satisfied..grains were hard and undercooked
mutton kasha:average
chicken: good
chanar dalna:awesome!
parshe jhal: good
golap sarbat: below average,it tasted like sugar syrup
there was a huge variety of chatnis served with papadvaja-- aamra,khejur-amsotto,tomato,pineapple(this is all that I remember)..Must say every chatni had its unique taste..I dont hav much craving for sandesh but they had 3-4 of its kind,I tried them and found them delicious..apart from all I could try,som  delicacies like badhakapir trkari,dhakai chochhori were there...

Coming to picket pinch--It was 2400 for 2

The staffs were extremely well behaved and helpful..Lastly I would like to say I have had better Bengali food in Bhojohori Manna,but yes..If u want to opt for a lazy lunch with scenic ambience and u r in a mood to spend a bit more this would b the choice..

It was 2011 Pujas and i heard Guns about Floatel. Plus the experience of dining amidst the ganges was an experience i would have never let go of. We went on Nabami a group of 10 friends and we where not interested to have Buffet which was being served that day. It was outstandingly gracious for the captain of The Bridge to allow alacarte to be served to us. I distinctly remeber ordering Nawabi Pulao, Non Veg kebab Platter, Gosht Labadari and raita for my self.....and it was mind blowing. The quantity was huge and taste was mesmerising. Service was top class. But since it was 2 years back and i want to experience the same again...Floatel The Bridge..here we come.

Well, I am a little confused to see so many good reviews with high ratings. As a matter of fact they have one of the best ambience one can crave for, ganges in background. And again their internal ambience is very good too. Service is good to okay. But, as the taste and quality of food is concerned, I feel mot so bad and well, interesting would be best to describe them. I must admit that I have tried them only for very few (3) times. But, every time I was kinda disappointed by their quality in terms of taste.

Food wise the rating would be probably 3.5 but add that extra 1 points for the view and experience. 

Located in the Floatel hotel - this is a one of kind "Kolkata" experience- dining on the Ganges. You sit back on the beautiful candle lit open air deck and admire the beauty of the city . The flowing water of the river calms you as you sit back enjoy the food. Ideal place to sitback  and relax - sip a drink 

Coming to the food - wide range of option - tandoori , Chinese and continental food.  They do offer a buffet- however, i have gone a-la-carte every time I have been there. try the Fried fish fort william.   Tandoor items are  average to good. pasta is quite well done and quite filling.  

Again - the highlight is the view and food is good enough to accompany.   And yes - prices are also on the higher side.

Had been to the place some 4 years back when it was still new and been there for my love of continental food. It so happens that the food was horrendous. The lamb chops were like another brick in the wall.
Came close with this place again a month back when I was staying for a holiday at the floatel.
Firstly I must say these guys serve a good breakfast buffet platter which comprises things from english, continental,  bengali, south indian and punjabi breakfasts. Moreover at dusk the food and the view of the majestic ganga makes it an amazing surprise for anyone.
The menu is mainly infian, chinese and continental amd veey over priced.
In fact if you try the same dish twice over a small duration they taste very different,  for example the murgh biryani.
This place is all about randomly chosing a dish and hoping it turns out good for example the lamb curry in chilli sauce. 
You guys need to improve.

i went to bridge the floatel during the awadhi festival, overall, i enjoyed it a lot. i do not have any idea about the regular buffet, since i never tried. but yes the food served here was mouth watering.. the chicken legs (having the taste of tandoori chicken) was delicious... and the best i had anywhere before..! rest was biriyani, mutton, etc which i didnt eat much rather just tasted and kept on gorging on   the chicken legs (tandoori chicken) ... there were array of deserts including cakes, firnis. all tasting great. 
NOW COMING TO THE ENVIRONMENT-- i've heard a lot about it, but i guess my timing of going there was not right, so it could not impress me, went there for dinner, it was not cool outside, it could have been, but throughout hot air was being released due to the air conditioners working everywhere , so i chose to sit in.
also, the waiters were not that polite, several times giggling at the corners, i mean cummon i guess its a 3-4 star restaurant... they can afford to be more polite. :) but regarding the food--  hands off no complains.... !

We were totally mesmerised when the deck seem to move with flow of water and level of water. It's restaurant on the deck provides excellent views specially during the night time when lights add sparkle to the views. candle light dinner with your loved ones will be wonderful. Coming to food, the multi-cuisine menu features Italian, Indian, Chinese and Continental fare, but the recommended dishes are Colonial specialities like Prawn Mollumelon, Fishcake Cabral, Mutton Rissoles, Fried Fish Fort William and Mr Brown Ball Curry. 
Overall food is good but not splendid. the ambience can make up for it!!!!

This is one of my favourite haunts in Kolkata. The Bridge is on the 3rd floor of Floatel, which (for information of the uninitiated) is an anchored ship in the Eastern bank (Kolkata side) of Ganga. The Bridge consists of a pretty large dining lounge along with a couple of open air decks. The lower deck has seating and dining options. I always prefer sitting outside on the open deck, if available. 

Unfortunately, the decks are often booked for personal and official parties. Nevertheless, it's worth the try. 

The service in the restaurant is fine, though a few waiters love to ogle at girls scavengingly (which is not welcome in a hotel of this stature). Moreover, I remember having reserved a deck table once. When I had actually arrived there, the staff informed me than the deck was reserved for some private party for the evening. They could have told me about that when I had called them up earlier to reserve the table, because my main aim that day was to have a family dinner in open savouring the chill of the river. That was kind of disappointing. Other than these, I have always felt that the customers are well-served. I recall once they had packed us free food. Actually, we had cancelled one item out of the order which was taking a bit more time than what we would like. The staff were extremely apologetic and packed the dish for a takeaway, totally free of cost. That was good PR.

Food here is good, and expectedly expensive. A tip: Go for the à la carte, and NOT the buffet. The buffet might save you money, but the à la carte gives you a huge freedom of choice.

The decor is good, with a good display of diverse navigational instruments all across the hotel. Overall, the place's got my recommendation.

Last Sunday I had a pseudo-date and Floatel was chosen as the desired destination. Actually both of us wanted to visit this place for quite sometime and it never happened. So on a rain drenched evening we ended up at Floatel.

With great poise, and not tumbling over my saree, I crossed the slanting plank which you need to cross to get inside the hotel. The Bridge - Floatel is actually the restaurant on the 3rd floor of The Floatel Hotel. Although it was raining , the day was still very hot and humid and so we decided to sit inside in the a.c. at the beginning. The inside is  nothing impressive really. The walls have chipped paint and the large bay windows mostly reflect back rather than allow a view outside.

We opted for the buffet and the food was very disappointing. There was a section for salads and soups which also included dahi vada and chicken patte. There was no distinct demarcation between the starters and the main course.  There was chicken tandoori , chicken biriyani, mutton rogan josh, fish in lemon cilantro sauce, assorted pasta, yellow dal, paneer saagwala, crisppy babycorn, kadai vegetable and an assortment of naans. The only dish worth any mention was the fish in lemon cilantro sauce. All the dishes lacked flavour. They did not have any distinctive taste. 
The dessert was however quite good. I tried the mango gateau  and chocolate mousse. The gateau had the sweet taste of mango and was soft and fluffy with bits of raw mango which made it even better. The chocolate mousse was not so sweet and very smooth and melted in your mouth just like chocolate mousse is supposed to. Apart from this they also had, bread pudding, sahi tukda, misti doi and gulab jamun. My friend/pseudo-date was all praises for the sahi tukda as well.

The service is also quite erratic. When we entered , we were not escorted to any table. After we were seated the waiter came and insisted they serve us the buffet on the table, which we were not interested in. They were also quite accommodating when we wanted to go sit outside. But then after we had given the card we were asked by 3 different waiters if we have paid.

Also the bill came to 2725 bucks for buffet and two drinks which is towards the expensive side. 

After we were done with the dessert we went outside and that is when we realized the beauty of the place. With the ganga sprawled in front of us  reflecting the luminous silver light of the moon which casts a magical spell on the night. You can see the two bridges on two sides lit up like jewels in the night sky. We ordered a couple of drinks and went up to the top deck. The view from the top deck is breathtaking. Standing in the moonlight with the cool breeze from the river brushing your face, makes up for the disappointing food. This place reaps all the advantages of its strategic location.

I would give this place a .5 for the desserts and a 2.5 for its location.

Floatel on the bank of Hoogly has its charm. Situated in the prime office district of BBD Bag, it really kicks off the high spirits of you.. and if its a windy cloudy evening..... u r in luck..

I tried both the lunch and the dinner buffets.. bit costly for the menu but the ambiance makes up a bit for it... 

The food is descent and I liked the taste... apart from a few minor hitches. The dessert particularly was pretty good. The Khirkadam, the rasmalai , malpua and the misti doi requires special mention.

As a wrap up.. this place is all about having a decent meal in on the river eying the mighty bridges of Calcutta.... the ambience....

All in all if you re with someone special and want to have a spl time... this place is worth trying for...

i considered to give 2 points just for the ambience n the deck...we go to a restaurant to eat n the food they serve is PATHETIC!
i tasted  chinese from their alacarte section couple of years back and it was just average at such high prices.
a few days back,i recommended this place to my best friend for a dinner date with her boyfriend,on his bday.1st of all,the staff refused to provide a complimentary bday cake..most restros do that without even charging!
 next they opted for buffet at about 950 bucks per head and the food was HORRIBLE!
Soup was over spicy,just two starters, included veg wantons which were too oily,n the oil smelled YUCK and fish fingers,the fish was ROTTEN.dats it for starters.
the main course had items which were all NOT EVEN EDIBLE! everything was stale smelling or rotten or uncooked! the deserts included normal fare and were just the saving grace!
the bill mounted to 1900 for providing such raw and rotten food...my friends were still hungry who paid it inspite of the fact that their complaints were overlooked,saying the rest are having the same food without complaining..if i were in there shoes,i rather would have left the table unpaid,or call their manager and chef n insulted both of them for charging their shits which they displayed on the buffet table!! dont ever dare to opt for buffet there..have booze n food else where,n sit with a chilled bottle of beer for an hour or so and enjoy smoking on the deck!! dats the utmost thing you can try!

The only thing worth talking about this restaurant, is its location. While the view is a feast for the eyes, its food would make you wonder the credentials of the chef.
Set on the head of Floatel, The Bridge had all what it takes to reach out for the "stars". But in spite of all the advantages, it has missed out the basic principle that makes a restaurant. The basic principle is that people go there to EAT, and eat something better that their daily grind at home, not bowl after bowl of slop that is churned out in this so-called restaurant.
The food is not fresh, the salad reeks like carrion, the main course is disjointed, the dessert is just way too rich. The grilled lemon fish had way too much flour, the chicken in red wine sauce tasted like chicken in hot water, the rice was bland and the pasta was like an assorted mix which seemed to taken from plates of uneaten food. The starter (mark the singular noun) was slighlty better but it was outnumbered by the amount unedible dishes.The saving grace was the fruit pastry. Probably the pastry chef new what he was doing as the dish he came out with was , believe it or not, tasty!!!! The pastry was flake and crunchy and the filling was palatabe (tasted a bit on the synthetic side though). 
Not the place to go to, if you are passionate about food. If you want to relax with a bottle of beer, maybe you can give it a try.

Good food, great view but has tale tell signs of ageing in every nook n corner, cheap speakers belting out even cheaper numbers, watches that tell no time, the little stains on cutlery.. Its all there, if you are willing to overlook all these for the sake of the view it offers, then this might be the place for you. And oh yes did I say ouch? Thats because its overpriced period

"Aahatein, ho rahin teri, Dil ke dar pe mere, Tu yahin hai kahin na kahin." Be it the first date, be it the n-Th one, you can never find a better atmosphere than this at any restaurant in town(provided no one has booked the place for a party), thanks to the river on whose lap this beautiful river-deck restaurant stands. I have been here a few times and the ambiance made me sway with awesomeness. The restaurant is designed inside a small ship. The wooden floors while entering are very welcoming as well. The best time to enjoy this place is during sunset by relaxing on the open deck with your loved one. There is also an enclosed seating area but I prefer watching the ripples and the city life at a distant from the deck. This is not just a restaurant because there is provision for staying here too. I have never stayed here so won't be able to comment on that.  
Now coming to the food (if you still care). The food is indeed pretty over priced but the price I believe is for the ambiance only. We had crispy chilli baby corn, American fried chicken, Conjee crispy lamb and coffee. All of them were pretty standard and nothing exceptional. But I suggest this place for a brilliant evening.

If you want to spend some lone and quiet time or show some one the best view of this city of joy, The Bridge is your destination. Spectacular view of the Ganges with the local ferry ghats and  other activities, truly an essence worth remembering and cherishing. However, what needs to be improved is firstly the menu which has very selective dishes and secondly the food which did not really impress me. At the end, a restaurant's best competency consists more in the food than the environment.

The view from the Bridge is breathtaking... Ganges quietly flowing by, trawlers whizzing along, rickety fishermen silently rowing their boats and the two mammoth bridges connecting Kolkata to Howrah on either side. The location is superb but the people at the Bridge forget that we hardly go to a restaurant to enjoy the view. The food here is simply pathetic. Be it chai or a simple mango lassi or fried mushrooms, the chef sure knows how to screw it up. Been here several times and have been sorely disappointed with the quality of food every single time. I have been served rotten food, under cooked food, stale food and over cooked food till I decided that I've given this place enough benefit of doubt and stopped going there altogether.

My rating is for the location and the romantic view but eating here is just a waste of time.

the bridge is the most  romantic place for couples who want to enjoy a dinner under the moonlight night as the ripples of the hoogly river water laps onto to the stationery ship. i have visited the bridge many times and one time it must have been around 12midnight and we were escorted by the waiter who was really polite and understanding, we ordered some cold coffee and sandwiches and cake since that was the quickest items avialable... inside the deck area is actually the bridge restaurant where a buffet usually is laid out. but the best part of the bridge is the top deck of the ship u can stand there and see the beautiful skyline of kolkata strand road and it reminds me of bead of necklaces. the ship also have and banquet hall where easily 150 people can have a party. its a great place to have wedding parties as the setting is so scenic. they also have rooms for accommodation also where u can wake up in the morning and see the run rising from ur cabin. gosh i am so lost describing the setting and forgot about the food. the food is not bad at all only. overall it was a lovely experience would love to go again during the winters. definitely recommend it others for sure but the prices are quiet stiff.

Totally in love with this place. After a age long of planning, got the time to drop in to this absolutely beautiful restaurant and came out gleaming. Dont remember the last time i was this exited...As we entered, we had to wait for the train to pass and i was like "seriously", i mean how many places you get such sight? So unique inside, just like a ship, the deck,the waiters all dressed as captains/sailors. The view of the the howrah and vidyasagar setu, river, the boats etc..stunning. The ambience was top notch . Coming to the food,wide range of option and  just like its ambiance it was awesome. We had crispy prawn, chilly chicken boneless and fish and chips. Everything was just lovely and just well done. The management too was very polite and full of energy. Price i thought was little high but, for a place like this, i dont mind. It is a place where one can just go for a casual hangout to relax or fine dining with family or clients. It suits all occasion. Have outside seating so one can sit in or enjoy the breeze outside.

I will definitely be recommending it to my friends and be a visitor again.

The location of Floatel is simply excellent which is the USP of floatel along with quality food. The ambience is excellent and it's a great place to enjoy your food with the lovely breeze blowing by.
Although, its a bit pricey, the quality of the food makes up for it. The buffet is to watch out for.
The service is excellent. Even though they ran out of gulab-jamuns in the buffet, on our request, they managed to serve us another couple of plate quite fast.

All in all - a great place to have great food. Thumbs up.!

Location of Floatel is the key point why we visited more than twice! 
On the food, little expensive but both A-la-Carte menu & Buffet is good. 
Traditional Bengali dishes (both veg & non-veg) were excellent!
All though I would suggest more variety & Chef to need work little more on the continental menu.
And service was good & very clean & neat surrounding.
Over all this is a place must go with family & loved one.

This place is just fabulous. I think its underrated and people are reluctant to come here. There is no other place in the city where you can enjoy a lovely dinner, with a soft breeze blowing from the ganges. The ambience, decor is really pleasant. Service is promt and efficient. Coming to the food, it is really one of the very best in town. We had a buffet dinner and all of the items were just fantastic right from the starters to the dessert. 
Pricing would be on the higher side, but there's no complaining really!

there has always been a debate among analysts as to how to rate a restaurant.michelin guide takes numerous accounts into consideration.i peronally think that overall experience is the most important factor of all.we went to floatel last year and tried thier buffet on deck.it disappointed us.they had two starters and no complimentary drink.we ordered beer separately.the main dish was extensive and we had chicken,fish etc but still the items were below par when compared to buffet in other restaurants.only the desserts were delightful. in spite of this,we had a great time.the open air setting opp to hooghly river,with all its breeze.the romantic upper deck,the well lit restaurant inside-captured our hearts.its a memory to relish upon.and i would definitely like to go back again.

Not worth the second visit. Not worth even the first one, in fact. We went there quite late ( about 10:30 pm) and it was the time that defined our choice. 
The overall setup and ambiance was quite unique for people who have never sailed or been on a ship ( plus we got quite a bit of rolling that evening, even given we were touching the banks) . So if you look for something different from regular table-city view dining, check out this place. 
But for me, food is what comes first when it comes to eating :) We opted for a-la carte, as having buffet that late would be suicidal.  
 I had some tandoori chicken  salad, which was just ok - I get better shawarma salad at Spencer's food court while shopping, for half the price. The rest of gang had continental chicken preparations and one tenderloin steak. Nothing great, at Rs 500 per dish ( I can do better at home, sure u can , too) . Steak was not bad (although one can argue if any cooked piece of beef can be called steak) - at least if was not some dark tasteless mush, which is often served in Cal instead of STEAK. 
Will not go there again, for sure. Service, too, was too VERY slow, given that there were only 2-3 customers left. 
2 from me, for the ambiance only.

Hey guys m bak with another review but this time its only 3 .... Many might differ from my view point but I feel tat the score 3 tat I have given is only bcz of the view from the deck ... Of the River Ganga and the beautiful windy evening tat I spend there .. Yes had gone there last week to celebrate my friends bday .. Had heard a lot about the beautiful ambience and the view .. I was totally mesmarized by the surrounding ... Very unique in the city of kolkata .. But apart from tat I wudnt suggest this place to any1 who is a FOOD LOVER cz the food was not up to the mark ... I cannot specify anything coz in general the whole buffet was very ORDINARY and below average .... They had only chicken for starters ... Tats it !!! NO VARIETY !!! I can't really elaborate on the maincourse cz the paneer was nt fresh and the rest of the menu was equally a disaster ... I am very choosy when it comes to eating outside ... I don't mind shelling money but the food should be worth it .. They charged us avg 900 per person for buffet ... Not Worth it .. May be one time dining is fine just to experience the ambience ... I would suggest this place to people who like drinking liquor and enjoy the evening along with starters !!!! Good for relaxation along Ganges !!!

One of a kind hotel , Floatel lives up to your expectations . I had booked a table for 2 on valentine's day as a surprise for my sweetheart . The deck is the most beautiful place to be with your love on a special occasion.Floating on the ganges , it has a sense of clamness and a romantic "love is in the air" kind of feel.The interior has the feel of a victorian era ship.

Coming onto food , it was good . They have a great variety of dishes in the menu, and the service was really good. 

Finally from the price point of view , the food is reasonably priced considiring its 4 star status.However one might feel the starters to be over priced considering the quantity on offer.
 
I would have given Floatel 4/5 but that extra 0.5 is for the ambience it has to offer. The most romantic place to dine in kolkata. Definitely a must visit for anyone who loves food and ambience equally.

The Floatel is another unique and extremely romantic experience from Kolkata's Pandora's Box. Located on a ship parked in the Ganges, Floatel is actually is 4 star hotel. The Bridge is located on the top floor of the ship, and it doesn't have extravagant ambiance but it sure offers something that's one of its kind. 

I regret the fact that I could visit the restaurant only once, but I'm definitely going back whenever I'm in Kolkata next. The restaurant offers inside seating, as well as seating on the deck. The sunset from the deck is a spectacular sight, and goes extremely well with a cappuccino! PS: Please carry a tube of Odomos if you plan to take a seat on the deck! Mosquitoes aren't such romantic creatures I guess.

They offer both A-la-Carte as well as buffet. We opted for the buffet on my last visit, and were pretty amazed by the spread. The Chingri Malai Curry and Fish Kalia were brilliant! I still cant get over it! The Kochi Patha Mangsho was equally good. The staff at The Bridge was really polite and friendly which made it even more memorable!

A must visit for everyone visiting Kolkata! RECOMMENDED!

'Floating Restaurants' have always appeared very romantic in my eyes. No doubt this one is not an exception. At the top floor of a floating 4-star hotel on the Ganges, it has been surely one of the best places in ever teemed Kolkata to spend some special time with your love.
I wonder it will surely add a cherry on your good times with the awesome sunset view.

Well, last Sunday I got a chance to head into this attractive place. Most of all, attractive because of its location and ambiance. 

Located on the Ganges, while getting inside I thought of heading into a ship. The vintage look is really eye-catching. Ambiance is very beautiful inside as well as in open air on other scale. 
If you plan for a romantic date with your partner, then reserve one of the rooftop riverside tables with candle lights.

Food was as good as the presentation. I opted for a la carte over there with Cheese Fish Finger, Murgh Makhni and Stuffed Kulcha. Prices are at the higher side (because it is in a 4 star) but buffet comes with varieties of items in a good value for money.

I don't know whether all experience the same there or not, but I got a top class service over there. The waiters were polite like anything, and served with most efficiency. They just allowed me to eat by myself only. 

Overall it was an extremely awesome experience for me.

My Ratings-

Food-4/5
Ambiance-5/5
Service-4.5/5
Value for money- 3.5/5

Overall- 4.5/5 [Don't be so late to experience this lovely place]

I would surely suggest you to visit there to have a super cool time.

One of my favorite places to go to .... best view of the sunset one can get while in a restaurant.. the romantic setting and the vintage charm of this place is what keeps me coming back over and over again . 

Both the dinner and lunch buffets are nice and i adore the a la crate too.. the make amazing keema mutter and the seekh kebabs and all other tandoori items are great too .. 

not  a huge fan of their breakfast buffet ... but its not bad if u get to see the rising sun . 

warning... do not come here post 11 at night.. the restaurant claiming to be a 24 hour outlet can be irritating ... the staff in the night shift is not courteous at all... the dont even present the menu... the are wiping cutlery in the middle of the restaurant and it can be quite annoying.. 

the staff in the rest of the day is very warm and friendly .. the place is also nicely done up.... a perfect place for a romantic date ...

The Bridge of Floatel......being one of the most unique restaurant catches the attention of every people. It is situated among the busiest places of Kolkata....yet the silence of this place captivates your attention. Located on the Ganga river on the top of a Hotel......plush with finest of  the crockery.....along with pleasing attitude of waiters, make your eating a memorable occasion. The decoration and lighting creates a sense of royal dining experience. An open air restaurant on the rooftop is heavenly.....u can see sunset along with your food. The ambiance being the attraction here, I was not at all bothering about the food quality......although I found it good enough to give it an applaud. The price is okay. A must visit place just for its ambiance and looks.

It's the only floating hotel in Kolkata and offers 4-star luxury and unique facilities to the guests. We were welcomed by stewards, who were dressed up as members of a cruise ship cabin crew. The Floatel offers rich dining experience to the guests at "The Bridge", a rooftop multi-cuisine restaurant. With beer in our hands, we decided to walk around, view and explore. The Floatel stands tall at the edge of the Hooghly River, with facilities like landscaped garden area, banquet halls, open-air dining and a promenade walkway by the river. So, we could savor a cocktail of kebabs overlooking the River and gazing at the stars. Definitely a fun-filled and memorable experience!!

As you stroll into The Bridge on Floatel you are enchanted with the uniqueness of experiencing scrumptous food surrounded by the flowing river of the ganges.
During the pujas the spread at Floatel was different from the usual because of the native bengali cuisine which began with starters like chatpata fish salad and ended on a sweet note with misti doi. We enjoyed every bit of the amazing bengali culinary delights ranging from luchi, alodum, mochar ghonto, pulao, variety of fishes, prawns,chicken in mustard sauce and bengali food lovers all time favourite kosha mangsho.After gorging on the heavenly delights of traditional bengali fare the variety of sweets in the form of sandesh, rosogolla and misti doi left us completely content and blissfully happy. The folk songs and the impressive magic performances were some of the charms while experiencing the tasty food and watching the water glow under the sun

Good food especially if one is looking for some Continental cuisine. The primary reason of going there in the first place was because of the location(Hoogly river...shimmering water...steamers ferrying people...) and was not disappointed in that respect.
The staff were courteous and made some good suggestions while selecting a meal.
