Pretty yummy chinese food, great taste but quantity not enough. Also bit Overpriced considering the shabby ambiance of the restaurant . Chilli chicken tasted good but it was too sweet. Chowmin was decent too. They cater to home delivery orders mainly. Also waiting time is fairly long.

Most most faltu restaurant in Harish Mukherjee road area. Yesterday I went to my Mashi Bari and my cousin sister brought some items from this vogous restaurant 

1. 5 pic of small maida ball yes maida ball not momo, no stuffing at all 
For that they charge 80???? It's better to shut down your so called food joint , such as cheaters 


It's my request , please remove this restaurant

A good place for having a simple meal. The place is not very fancy but the food is okay. You can try their noodles n chicken manchurian is quite good.

This very old restaurant situated within my area of neighbourhood, sells very decent Chinese dishes along with rolls, cutlets. 
Prices are less, quantity is good but there's no pleasant ambience in here.
However, they do make pretty tasty fish fry and rolls.

VERY OVER RATED DISHES. the owner is very rude.
Food tastes just like any road side stall. Had a very bad experience. I had ordered mixed fried rice and chilly chicken. Mixed fried rice had very few pieces of mutton. Please guys don't waste your money by eating here because you will get the same taste and quantity in any of the roadside stalls at 1/4th price. Prices of each and every dish is exremely high! A simple chicken roll is of rs.55. Lol! Shocking!

Dicky's Restaurant is located in Bhawanipur, Harish Mukherjee Road Near beside petrol pump. It is a very small place specially a take away joint but in case someone is planing to sit and have food they have got 3 table inside the restaurant. The food is good and the quantity served in a plate is also enough for two.Â

I think this place is really indifferent about whatever anyone else has to say about it. Got a problem with the food? They don't care. Got a problem with the food not being delivered yet? They don't care. Got a problem with SOMEONE ELSE'S ORDER COMING OVER TO YOU? Well guess what? THEY DON'T CARE.

The only ones who DO seem to care are the employees. But just as soon as you walk into the establishment, you'll feel as if you're being greeted by the lovechild of Mussolini and Stalin - with the guy giving you  a look as if he's done YOU A FAVOR by providing you service rather than the other way around.

That's why we started getting it delivered to our address instead. But lately there's some new guy who takes the calls and he's just as rude as the other one - probably even more.

While placing the order just today, like, while I'm STILL TALKING mind it - he kept saying "Where's the order going to go? What address is the order going to go" like a broken record over me talking - and when I stopped and told him the address instead, he says, "You keep repeating the address but what are we supposed to send you? It's ridiculous!!! We can't just pack air into a box and send it to you you know!?!" - which is when I got so p***ed, that I hung up the phone and went to the place instead so that I can confront him about it.

Came off as a prick in person as well - but he apologized which goes a long way in my book sometimes - but what he said to me over the phone still made me want to punch his lights out.

What used to be my favorite place to order takeout from - has now become my last resort.

Okay food though. And I'm referring to Chicken Fried Rice and Chilly Chicken when I say that.

At the end of the day - NOT WORTH IT.

Eaten before but again reviewing for the first time. Ordered Chicken Hakka noodles and Chicken Chilly Dry and loved every strand of noodle and every bit of chilly. Never disappointed with its stuff. Typical taste of Chinese we have grown up eating, authentic or not I dunno but tasted simply amazing.Will eat again for sure.

Little overpriced...otherwise food is very good and tasty...you can hardly call it a restaurant bcz they have very less room for people to sit and dine....chicken gravy chowmein and dry chilli chicken is a good option to have here...but there chicken roll is a must try they add a smokeish flavour to their chicken rolls which makes it unique and different from other fast food centres.

Food is below par. Only average tasting dish I had was the chicken chilly and chicken fried rice. The chicken roll was horrible. Kabiraji was dry and was a disaster. Can avoid this place.

Note: Had a tremendous argument with the shop owner as I had parked in front of Dicky's while visiting a friend and it's supposed to be "his" parking spot.  Coincidentally the friend ordered takeaway from the same place. Its an honest review of the food and the food only. Even if zomato would have permitted 0 rating, I would have given it the same.

One of my childhood memories is frequently ordering food via home delivery from Dickys. Back then, very few restaurants used to offer such a service. They used to be fairly prompt in their service. They were a life saver during surprise guest visits. Ah I do remember ordering rolls, cutlets, momos, gravy chowmein, Dickys special chilli chickenâ€¦â€¦but over the years their quality has decreased exponentially. Quite often, the food is rotten, the ingredients of inferior quality and the restaurant is notorious for giving people gastric problems and stomach infections after consumption. I would stay away from this place unless they improve. A place to avoid folks!

Its basically a take away joint. Actually it has remained so for more than 5 years now. Was passing by, and suddenly nostalgia got the better of me. It has been years since I ate their food. Used to get it ordered. Their noodles or more appropriately chow mein is pretty nice. Generous in amount. Had the Hakka mixed variant. Tasted almost as good as it used to 5 years back. The chicken was juicy and soft but they probably went a little generous with the cornflower coat. Don't even remember what was the other thing I had. Overall the experience was not bad. They kept their flavours intact over the years as much as they have kept the stains on the walls or the dirt inside the tiny space.

Dicky's located on Harish Mukherjee Road is one of the more older restaurants.I remember visiting it a couple of times during my childhood when it used to pretty popular and decent too.Over the years the quality and popularity has declined quite a bit.

Last day my mom got for me a Dicky's special mixed chowmein and a chili garlic chicken.I did not have very high expectations but the food turned out to be pretty decent.The mixed chowmein though not brilliant was okay and contained generous amounts of chicken and prawn.The quantity was nice too.The chili garlic chicken was tasty and it had a nice kick about it.But unfortunately the coating was almost more than the actual amount of chicken.

Since I have not visited this place of late I will not be able to comment on the ambience or the service.The prices are more or less reasonable.Overall at present it is one of those places you can give a shot if you are passing by the area hungry or you live in and around.

I have been to Dickeys from around 1986 and still continuing. It is very good for take out. I have rated it as take out food joint and not as gourmet. Quality is really good for a take out and quantity is sufficient for 1.5 person to 2 per box. Even they delivers at home with Rs 10 extra if order is below Rs250. Savior for lazy days.

Dicky's one of favourite chinese restaurant. Quantity enough  for two peoples. First time I visit this restaurant on my childhood. Food quality and quantity same as earlier. If you wish to place bulk order to this restaurant, you'll not disappoint about quality.  But only negative point about this restaurant is space. very small space inside only 5-8 peoples can eat foods at a time.  My wife also love this restaurant, who not a foodies.

This place is best for take away dinner. 
It is one of my favorite place when ever i am a in a mood to relax at home eating some good food.
one can easily spot this place on Harish Mukherjee Road  adjacent to a petrol pump.
It is a small room where maximum of 6 people can sit at the same time. they place may seem tacky but one should not judge this place by its looks. This place definitely servers kolkatas one of the best  mixed gravy chowmine. Other choneese dishes are pretty well too but the chowmien is the star attraction here.
So whenever I am in a mood to chomp Chinese, I drop in here at the time of returning from home and take a parcel home.

Dicky's mixed gravy chow mien, a bottle of Fanta and myself in front of the TV I s what I call happiness is.

Its like I have grown up having Dicky's Gravy Noodles and Chilly Chicken. Its the best in the league as far as this particular dish is concerned. Being a great foodie and having tried and relished Chinese at various restaurants round the city, I can assure you that this dish served here with two sachets of chilly sauce has the potential of countering noodles from the chefs of some of the most renowned kitchens of the town!!

Dicky'sssss......Its a very nice restaurant in Calcutta and their chinese food is tasty.They home deliver food within 2 kms and i have their food very often. I have visited the restaurant only once and almost all the time i have asked them to home deliver. Its a small fast-food outlet. Sitting arrangement is only for 10 people i think. The chicken rolls here are also tasty too. Most of the time i order fish fry,fish finger and sometimes chicken pakora. Several times they have delivered tasteless food and once when i had ordered chicken cutlet the chicken was not cooked properly.But i think now the food quality is worsening than the food quality of the earlier times. Staffs are well and pricing is also very reasonable. Fried rice and prawn manchurian is goos too but sometimes they are also served tasteless. It is almost located  beside the petrol pump in Bhowanipur. They do not take much time to deliver but when heavy orders are ordered they take a lot of time. let me also tell you,that they charge rupees 10 for delivering in homes. When i pass by from there,it remains crowded and i would rate 3 stars for it. I want them to regain their position of food quality again.

Once upon a time  Dicky's  was a take away paradise,  great  food  was available at throwaway prices  .  the time i am talking about is  1995-2005  . after that the place went downhill  . not  only the prices increased  but  the QUALITY DETERIORATED a lot . now it survives mainly on past laurels  .  if you at all  need to go then try out their chicken sweet corn    soup  ,  mixed chowmein gravy  &  either garlic chicken or sweet  & sour chicken .  rest are sadly not what they used  to be . Price for two here would be Rs 450 & not 700 as zomato suggests ,  unless of  course you decide to go berserk  with the orders  .in case if you have trouble locating the place  ,  come down to HARISH MUKHERJEE road  & ask anyone about the PETROL PUMP on H.M ROAD  . OVERALL  , NOT RECOMENDED
