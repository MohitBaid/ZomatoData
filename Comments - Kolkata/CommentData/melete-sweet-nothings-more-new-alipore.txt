It is an absolute to delight to place orders @ Melete. From personalised cakes that are concept driven, personalised and unique to cute brownies and chocolates - there is something for everyone with an enormous value for money. The owner, Ms. Anjee Bhatia loves to experiment and "whip" magic in her mixing bowl and oven! I love it :D

Melete is simply amazing.
I have had their brownies more than once and they have never disappointed me. 
I even packed their brownies for my family once and they were equally impressed.

Melete is located in New Alipore.Have tried almost their every type of brownies from almond to walnut,terrific in taste.Blueberry is one of my favourite item of them,it's mouthwatering. 
Last month Melete also set up a stall in Jadavpur University. I have tried their chocolates also,amazingly tasty,they used to give it in a well decorated box, it looks very attractive.Prices are reasonable.One can not find a better home baked product than Melete.

I had brought approx.22 pcs of nutella truffles vua swiggy from Melete. Presentation wise it was nice. Coming to the chocolates i felt that the nutella flavour ,which the name suggest, lacks. I found little amount or should i say essence of nutella. The chocolate tasted good but the filling of nutella not adequate. Hope to try their brownies one day. I wish i could have given 3.3.

They gave a stall today at JU.
There was a wide array of brownies and chocolates. There were regular sized brownies in the range of Rs. 50 - 80, and also the miniature versions of these for Rs. 15.
We had many of the mini brownies- rum,nutella,butterscotch, white chocolate,jam cake and Oreo.
We also had a mint chocolate and a rum chocolate.
All the brownies were soft and flavourful.
I personally liked the rum brownie best, followed by the nutella one.
The chocolates are pretty good too.

Anybody seeking for delightful home bakers this is the best possible often. Sadly, have not met the owner personally but her/his products are outstanding! Thanks to Samridhi and Zomato, I was gifted Melete goodies. The brownies were so soft, they had a chocolatey layer to it. A perfect mix of softness, crunchiness..the perfect dessert!

Wish Zomato gave us an option of giving 100 stars cos they so do deserve it and much much more... Was roaming aimlessly on 1st Jan when I happened to enter Allen Park at Park Street. There were numerous food stalls there but what caught my attention were 2 young ladies telling everyone-- " Please try our brownies". Being a sucker for anything sweet, I went ahead and tried one. As soon as a piece went inside my mouth, I was instantly transported to Heaven. The brownie was sooooooo freaking awesome. I took 1 piece of each brownie. It was cost-friendly and totally worth each and every dime I spent on it. 

Thank you so so much for giving me a taste of Heaven on the first day of the year!!!

P.S: It took me about half an hour to write this small review as I was gorging on 1 of your brownies while writing it. Who knew brownies can be so distracting??? :P

Winter is here.So more reasons for craving a nice,fudgy brownies.Going by the reviews I figured out that brownies are their area of expertise.I ordered three variants of brownie through Swiggy(two each).They are providing a selective discount of 15% on their brownies which made the bill off INR 300 to INR 255.Its pretty reasonable even without the discount because the quality of their products I had was really good and also the sizes of brownies were commendable.
Brownies were sealed nicely and the product came in a box with name of the home bakery chain written over it.

All the brownies were textbook perfect.Fudgy with a bit of a crunch on top,sinful chocolatey flavour.
Now going through the flavour profile of the individual variant.

•Espresso brownie-It had rich flavour of coffee in it.It was bitter dark in taste with aroma of coffee..topped with white chocolate shavings.It was good though I wish it had a stronger coffee flavour.I wanted more bitterness and bold taste of espresso in it.It can be perfect for people who doesn't like the bitterness of coffee much and like it mild..But stronger the better with right hint of sweetness is my definition of a perfect cup of coffee.My brother gave the same opinion.
It was a great brownie nonetheless.

•Butterscotch brownie-There were little chunks of butterscotch within the brownie.The white chocolate layer on top was good as well.I am not a fan of white chocolate because it can be too sweet for my liking..but it added a good crunch to the dark,sinful chocolate brownie.It was my brother and mother's favourite.

•Peanut butter swirl brownie-There are rarely people who didn't take the peanut butter jar out off fridge and take a spoonful of it in their childhood days(I still do it though. :P)
Here generous amount of peanut butter was swirled over an amazing brownie.It was like magic.The bitter dark flavour of brownie was perfectly balanced with this sweet and salty swirl of pure indulgence.Loved it to the fullest.This was undoubtedly my favourite.

Melete-Sweet Nothings & More has taken a place in my heart as one of my favourite destinations when brownie cravings are on.Looking forward to trying out all the other varieties.

A home baker trying to create some innovative cakes with some unusual flavours, that's all I have to say about this place. I had ordered a cake for my grandma's birthday yesterday from here along with some brownies and truffles. To be very honest, I wasn't satisfied to the fullest.
Birthday Cake - The design was a customised one. It didn't look at all similar to the picture that I had sent to the authority. Flavour was Blueberry and Meringue as suggested by the owner. It was kinda okayish. Packaging needs much improvement as the buttercream frosting got messy due to delivery and sogged the cake box itself.
Brownies - They have an unique array of brownies of which I chose butterscotch and jam swirl. The butterscotch brownie was pretty good with chunks of butterscotch in each bite. It was topped with a thick layer of white chocolate which I absolutely loved a lot. Didn't get the chance to try the jam swirl brownies but my family members who had them, said it was pretty good.
Truffles - Here, the flavours were three - peanut butter balls, vanilla cranberry and coconut lemon truffles. Each one of them were pretty good. I especially liked the vanilla cranberry and peanut butter balls.
Everything is pretty good at Melete but they need to add that touch of finesse to excel in the long run. Pricing is alright as well. I would recommend this place for the brownies and the truffles but definitely not for the birthday cakes or so. That's it. Happy Dining! :)

It's a long time i have been thinking to gift my bae some delicious chocolates for his birthday. Both of us are fond of white chocolate which is quite difficult to find. So i looked in the menu of every bakery and sweet shops . But this particular shop Melete caught my eyes as i was browsing on swiggy. Finally bought it today. 2 boxes full of surprisingly exquisite and delicious as well as not too sweet chocolates reached my home. I tried 1 first but couldn't resist myself having more. They are beautifully packed. But i wish the outer package wound have been something like a gift box . But is ok considering the price of 1kg (though i have not measured the weight. The menu suggested 1kg) or around so. Each box contains 40pcs around which is a huge quantity to gift. I Will love to order more from them and personally visit them for pick up and find out greater sweet surprises.

An endeavour to bring to you happiness wrapped in the yumminess of chocolate and baked goods – Melete loves to serve you everything chocolate and all things yummy. The brain child of Anjee Bhatia, Melete is a six months old home bakers. It specialises in brownies with interesting flavours.

Location : this is basically a home baker located New Alipore. The best way to reach is dropping in near Hindustan sweets. Take the opposite lane, the third right , walk for a couple of minutes to locate sarada uchho vidyalaya and right opposite to it is Melete.

The occasion was the launch of their new product called Lite Bites. These are cookies made from different flavours. Keeping into account the dietary limitations, Anjee has tried to work with Stevia, a replacement of sugar. True to its name,Lite Bites is a healthier version of cookies made with multigrain ( suji/semolina, oat and wheat) . Needless to say, a great product for diabetics with sugar craving.

Post the lunch high tea was also served which included

Food :

1. Coconut bread along with an yoghurt dip – this was quite a new concept. The coconut bread I felt was soft and the accompanying yoghurt dip added to it further.

2. Foccasia – the foccasia can definitely be worked upon. I did feel the base was too quirky , the cheese was not laid properly. However, it tasted well off.

I have always loved brownies, and that’s what I started selling. I got obsessed with making the best brownies ever. I made a lot of them. I found the perfect recipe, and it clicked! Later I moved on to loads of exciting new products- cookies, tarts, quiches, and most recently breads. But still, brownies have a special place in my heart and we make brownies in 10 amazing flavours.

Everyone loves to eat cookies cakes brownies,we all want to eat this type of foods without gaining weight or we think about our health,but there is a big no because this joint seriously introduced some good healthier foods which is not only good as well tasty,i would like to thank Anjie for making this types of foods,this place easy to locate it is in new alipore area,just opposite lane of hindusthan sweets,mainly this is a home bakery take away joint,instead of sugar they used stevia which is taste like sugar,it is good for the health conscious people.

[Foods]
1. Cookies (suji wheat maida) - there were three types of cookies they served us,one made by semolina flour(suji)which one is a bit sweet but it was awesome slightly crunchy still very soft,this is a unique combination,will melt inside your mouth within a moment.Next one made by wheat,nothing is better than a warm chewy cookie,this one is a must try,using wheat instead of all purpose flour makes this one just lovely,stir in flour baked with baking powder and salt along with it.Last one all propose flour one,mixed with baking powder salt as well as proper amount of sugar,egg portion and with the vanilla,you will love to eat them not only because it was soft,very mooth from the beginning you will find it when you will put it inside your mouth.

2. Butter Scotch brownie - they have different types of brownies,this one was lovely as per taste and flavour,very soft melted in the mouth very gently.

3. Peanut butter - another in brownie section,taste was ok for me soft and good in taste,main things the flavour was very tempting.

4. Café brownie - this one just lovely I must say,perfect combination the flavour was lovely as well as taste too,very soft and melted in the mouth very quickly.

5. Lemon grass ginger - it was good in taste,and the flavour was awesome.

6. Coconut bread - this is one of the new thing which I tried,it was good in taste eating with yoghurt dip it was a good combination.

7. Foccasia - it was ok bit not upto the mark which i think,taste was very average cheese portion also need to be put a bit more.

8. Cheese tart - it was good the salty cheesy taste it was good combination,the layer you can feel while eating.

9. Lemon tart - it was look wise and the taste wise just super cool,the flavour was good as well as the size.

This type of joint where you will get some really good healthier foods without thinking about health you can easily eat more and more,wish you all the very best for the future.

Melete,the brain child of an upcoming entrepreneur,Anjee Bhatia,caters to all those sweet tooth who have health restrictions.The bakery is 6 months old bakery. based in New Alipore.It is a delight to see someone take such a noble initiative of bringing taste and health together.So all those diabetics out there,there is finally some good news for you.We were invited as team panchphoron for the launch of “Lite Bites”,their “sugarfree” cookies made from various ingredients.One might wonder as to how “sugarfree” and healthy go together since the sugar substitutes that are available in the market contain aspertame which is highly carcinogenic.Read on to know how this product is not carcinogenic.

We people are too conscious about our health and most of the time just skip desserts after a meal and thus the meal remains incomplete every time. Too much of cream, sugar and chocolates are completely no-no for us specially in our schedule where we hardly get time to work out. 

This problem has been solved efficiently by this small dessert and bakery parlour at new alipore,near hindusthan sweets. It's a home bakery and only take away is available.

I received an invitation from 'pinnacle communiq' for a food tasting session here through "panch phoron" group. 
Though l was a bit late, I received a warm welcome from the owner.

The concept of this bakery is to discard sugar in the desserts and to use stevia as a sweetener and replacement of sugar. Not only that, the cookies they offered are made up of multigrains; so again a healthier version where you are just avoiding flour.

What we were offered- 
1. Cheese tarts- they were just amazing. Lower crispy layer with salty cheese filling inside created a magic.

2. Coconut bread along with an yoghurt dip- A new recipe for me. Bread was soft, fresh with cashew nuts on top and the dip added to it further.

3. Foccasia- It was pretty average to me with toppings of cheese,bits of onion and bell peppers, though tasted nice.

4. Peanut butter brownie- Since i just love peanut butter,i was eagerly waiting to taste it. And i just loved the flavour. It was soft and fresh and scrumptious.

5. Butter scotch brownie- again a new recipe for me. Tasted amazing with full of flavours.

6. Coffee Brownie- ideal for coffee lovers with the strong aroma and flavour of coffee beans. It was soft and delicious.

7. Cookies- cookies are made up of semolina,oat & wheat which are very healthy. Taste and texture wise they were perfect. It was crispy,well baked and low on sweetness.

8. Lemon curd- It was just great. The tangy flavour went well with the cookies.

The owner is doing a great job here. She herself experimented for a long time and came up with these amazing items. According to her, the brownie can be preserved for 2-3 months in freezer without damaging the quality and taste and same goes for the cookies too. 

So people,no more skipping desserts and bakery items, the solution is a phone call away.

A chic little place in new Alipore serving the best treats that tingle the taste buds. Leaves people hungry for more. Upon request one can also bake their own cake for a nominal price. Worth a try and a day well spent. Kudos to all the hard work to satiate people's sweet tooth.

In this hard paced life of ours, the first and foremost thing which concerns us is our own health. This includes maintaining a proper life style, taking food at the correct times, not to overstress ourselves, and restrict the usage of certain food ingredients or atleast try to minimize them as much as possible so as to stay away from their harmful effects. The general tendency is to shift to something healthier, something natural and something beneficial  in the wake of the boom of the artificial and unhealthy substances all around. This is where, Anjee Bhatia and her creation Melete comes in.

Being a kid, I have seen my parents enjoying their daily cup of tea with the amount of sugar they desired to intake, until they realized that they could not afford to keep up with their daily lifestyles. The consumption started reducing and ultimately went a point where both my parents prefers to have tea without any sugar in it. I always thought the artificial sugar products which are promoted over the television by renowned celebrities could be a decent substitute until my perception went for a bang after meeting Anjee!

These so called sugarfree products not only are harmful but can even result in some deadly disease. So here was Anjee, explaining the idea behind this brand of her’s where she was trying to work with a natural sweetener, a perfect substitute for sugar. Only, this one is totally natural and do not possess any of the side effects of sugar or the sugar-free substitutes. Melete, is supposedly a Greek word and was carefully attributed by Anjee to name her brand. I had to google this as well a bit, and it apparently seems that the word in ancient Greek means practice or exercise, while in Greek Mythology it symbolizes one of the original three muses, as a source of inspiration.

I was invited to her place as a part of a group to celebrate the launch of Lite Bytes, which is a new innovation by Anjee along with Jenas Life Sciences to produce cookies made with Stevia instead of sugar. Anjee says, that people suffering from diabetes or any related illness where they are restricted the intake of sugar should also have the pleasure and freedom of having cookies, as they are supposed to be, not thinking that they are compelled to try sugarfree products or the ones with artificial substitutes owing to their illness.

The cookies here made by Anjee are no different than the ones which would have tasted had they were made with sugar. The only comparison which one could draw is that this one is tastier, lighter and healthier.These are lightweight and multigrain cookies and are made out of suji or semolina, whole wheat and Maida. The cookies comes in two packages, the smaller one weighs 200 gms and is priced at Rs. 150 while the bigger one weight 400 gms and is priced at Rs. 300. The cookies were wonderful to taste. Light and fluffy, it is hard to imagine that this has been made completely without sugar. The taste here was almost delicate, making it hard for us to distinguish among the flavor. Subtlety and finesse is surely Anjee’s prowess!

The packaging here is elegant and is carefully articulated so as to give it a visual pleasure at the time of purchasing or carrying it over for your near and dear ones. One could also order for corporate gift boxes, consisting of relatively more number of cookies for gifting to their family members or even to friends, employees or coworkers. If these cookies were not enough to tickle our palette, Anjee had more surprise for us in lieu of flavored brownies, Coconut breads, Cheese Tarts, Fuchasia, Lemon Dip and Yogurt Dip.

I had only heard of how good Anjee’s brownies were and I was lucky enough to taste some of them (Butterscotch, Coffee and Nutella) upon my visit to her place. The Brownies were soft, with wonderful texture  and had a very subtle taste of the filling, where they weren’t overpowering the basic existence of the brownies. The Cheese Tart was a pleasure in heaven. It is hard to explain the ecstasy unless one actually feels the same by having this item. The Fuchasia was lovely with it almost tasting like a Pizza. The highlight of the day, other than the cookies according to me was her Coconut Bread. Light, spongy and almost airless; the Lemon Dip was the perfect accompaniment to go with the Coconut Breads.

To conclude, if you have a loved ones who has some sugar related illness which prevents him from fulfilling his eating habits, if you have someone whom you care about and would like them to shift to a natural replacement of sugar, if you have someone who matters to you, do yourself a favor and try the Lite Bytes Cookies by Anjee Bhatia! If you would like to incorporate Stevia into other items you could even do that as well. It has taken Anjee a lot of attempts, hard work and dedication to perfect these cookies and I can promise you these creation of her’s tastes exactly the same as you would find with the normal sugar made ones. So, pick up your phone, call up Anjee and place your order. Am sure, you will not regret seeing the healthier side of life.:-)

When was the last time you enjoyed a dessert and it was ‘healthy’? Do the words ‘healthy’ and ‘tasty’ go together? Can something healthy be tasty? Are you wondering! Well, don’t think too hard since you have got the answer right here in front of you. You can get all these answers once you finish reading through this blog post. Recently I received an invitation at the launch of ‘Lite Bites’ a product from the bakery called Melete where I was introduced to some products which had the answer to our well-being and the secret to our good health in the coming days. Well, I’ll come to the description of the food items later but let me guide you through this unique concept that can transform the way we eat and live. Do you use sugar-free products or artificial sweeteners? Are you well aware about their side effects? I only can tell you it has got loads of side-effects and I hate talking about the extreme ones. Instead you can google about ‘Stevia’. Stevia is a natural sweetener or sugar substitute extracted from the leaves of a plant (species - Stevia rebaudiana). Stevia has ‘steviol glycosides’ which have up to 150 times the sweetness of sugar and has negligible effect on blood glucose. Isn’t that wonderful? Here at Melete you get cookies and brownies prepared with stevia that is healthy, has no ill-effects and is tasty at the same time. Melete, in partnership with Janus Lifesciences, has launched Lite Bites. True to its name, Lite Bites are healthier cookies made with multigrains like suji, maida, wheat along with stevia in it. Indeed an amazing product for diabetics with sugar craving.

A friend had treated me to their 'sweet nothings' - classic chocolate brownie and lemon brownie. They tasted alright, delicious and the way a brownie should. For similar confections, a nice place to pay a visit.

Tasted their cake on a stick at the KFB Bake Sale last month, and they were pretty good. And they looked amply pretty too! 
Would love to try out their brownies, which looked nice, but I was just too full to have anything else by the time I reached their stall!

I had the opportunity of tasting their fabulous confectioneries at a stall they put up in my college. I tried their walnut brownie, almond brownie, and an amazing white chocolate one. They have silky soft brownies, that melt in the mouth and the hit of chocolate is just divine! Looking forward to visiting their store and trying out more stuff!

Looks pretty and tastes amazing. We tried the butterscotch brownie, ended up buying more :) Texture was perfect, crumbly and chocolatey enough to leave you wanting more.

If you have a sweet tooth and you love brownies and chocolates, look no further. Have tried its various varieties of brownies and great mix of chocolates and I havent been disappointed. 
Have even used it as corporate gifts for my customers and the reviews I received from them also has been fantastic.
So next time you are around New Alipore, dont forget to collect your box of delicacies from Melete. P.S You can get it home delivered as well :)

I finally managed to have Anjee's homemade brownies at Park Street carnival. And I wasn't disappointed. The chocolate brownies were good, as they usually are in most cases. But what surprised me was how good the white chocolate brownie was. Damn. Can't wait to go back again! Way to go Anjee Bhatia :')

Probably the best brownies I had in years. It just melted in my mouth and left me craving for more. Recommended as anti depressant. It leaves u craving for more and more... I'd rather satiate my sweet craving by gorging on these sweet nothings...And calories...umm...I'd just forget about those for now😈

And here is why I need to give this awesome team a 5/5.

1. Easter eggs- cute, delicious and happiness is when the CEO herself comes to your home to deliver them while a pot luck lunch is on- PRICELESS
2. Chocolate brownies with nutmeg- I remember the first time we had a get together and I met the CEO, she instantly treated us with the best brownies, which melted in my mouth- needless to say we had a fight for the last crumbs in 10 minutes flat.
3. Bespoke and Customised- I only have to call the team and they are ready to get it done as per my tastes and likes- I can be very fussy with sweets and goodies, which Melete understands very well.
4. My late mom, Greta Noronha was an ardent fan for the brownies- she had two of them and this was the first time she ever opened her mouth for sweets. She wasnt someone who loved brownies, but when she did try the two pieces i picked from Melete in 2013, the joy on my moms face and her approval for the taste made me the happiest son around- bless you Melete, moms in a happier place now but am sure she misses your sweet nothing touch ;)
and finally,
5. Economical and perfect for gifting too, where else would your pocket strings be happy, but Melete!

I am looking forward to more such delightful times and goodies from Melete; believe me you wouldn't disagree with the same!

Tried to find this place after reading all the great reviews .... However despite three attempts we could not locate it even though we found the address. ... There is no signboard. ... We could only find a coaching centre in the building ....

Okay this is perhaps the most detailed review yet, but I think this venture deserves it and more than that, people need to know what to expect from it. Melete, as I think, is a breath of fresh air for those who like to customise their food especially chocolates because lets face it, we all are chocolate fanatics in some corner of our hearts. So here goes...

DARK CHOCOLATES - There are varieties of chocolates available everywhere, I know, but for dark chocolates, we only have to depend on foreign imports if we are rooting for quality; granted Bournville is a good chocolate but that's probably the only one - that's how I used to think at least till I came across Melete. I can tell you I am immensely fussy when it comes to dark chocolates and I am one of those who doesn't even like Cadbury Bournville (I know, judge all you want but that's the level of fussy I am when it comes to dark chocs). But if you are like me or if you like Bournville, DROP WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING, RUSH TO MELETE AND TRY HER DARK CHOCOLATES! The most fantastic dark chocolates I have ever had and it is addictive as anything, so beware! 

BROWNIES - Melt in mouth, you get that texture you expect in the best quality brownies there is. I am fussy about brownies and I have had brownies from different places - some of the reputed ones were divine but then there were ones which were overdone. Brownie is a very subtle art, I have discovered over the years Melete's brownies are of the "Divine" genre with ther perfect about of sweet and texture you expect in the top quality ones. Again I stress on the dark chocolate brownies, they are more than DIVINE! I am not a big fan of dry fruit brownies so I prefer the ones without but I believe those who love, it will be an exploding treat for them. You can't get enough of those. Mark my words

DARK CHOCOLATE FUDGE - Okay, these are perhaps my MOST favourite product Melete has to offer. Since the first time I had them, I haven't forgotten the taste. And if you don't trust me that's even better - just go ahead and try yourself. Actually, if you go to Melete and you are in Dilemma what you wanna get, GET THESE FUDGES!

SAVOURIES - I have had the savouries long back when Melete was a month old maybe and they were delicious but still I felt that they had room for much improvement. Its been a year and a half since then, I would have to go and try a few more of the savouries in recent times to tell for sure, so don't have much to write about those...

That looks pretty much what I wanted to tell...

Overall, I would always return to Melete for my chocolate hunger.

P.S. Oh and I forgot to mention, the dark chocolates, I mentioned above, don't melt in room temperature but don't expect them to stay hard in your mouth either, they are REALLY soft and in layers, you can even bite - I was blown away by this quality, its uncanny. I took a pack and travelled for 20 hours in train and they were intact. Well you can guess they can stay like that for days! And you have options for lots of fillings (if that's what they are called) including psst, liquor ones... yep that is so!

Brilliant hand-made chocolates, and everything else that can possibly come out of an oven. Perfect for all those special occasions when Cadbury is way too mainstream. :)
Ultimate example of food made with love. Also, super sweet owner (added perks). Must have!
