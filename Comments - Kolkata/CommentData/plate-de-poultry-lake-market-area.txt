I ordered for a home delivery from Plate-de-Poultry which is in the food court of Lake Mall. As from the name we can assume it is for egg-lovers.Yes definitely,but I have tried a lot of dishes there where the chicken,mutton,egg combining new dishes truly won my heart. I ordered 
‚óègrilled egg sandwich
It was stuffed with vegetable and egg with slight cheese served with french fries and tomato sauce.It was healthy and at the same time tasty too.Loved it.If you follow a healthy diet routine,do visit there for some healthy yummy salads too.

As an egg enthusiast I wanted to try out a lot of things at this stall at lake mall's food court. But time permitted for me to order only one item, So I went with the famous Mutton Cheese Omelette which was praised in almost all of the reviews I read. And it was delicious without fail quite heavy and served with grilled bread and salad. I'm definitely going back to try out more options like egg Benedict next time I'm in town!

The most rude staff behavior I received while I approached this counter.  The woman who was at the counter started screaming to a basic question which  we had inquired for.  Absolutely uncalled for and humiliating.  And when we told her that we would complain to the brand owner,  her reply was "Tumko dekh lungi mein" .  Everyone at the food court counter also told me to write a review stating her inappropriate and rude behavior.  Suggested to koi visit this place at all.

If you want a combo meal with a bit of western flavour, you can go for Plate De Poultry.  A place where you will get Chelo Kebab Platter at just Rs 300. Well, it's unfortunate that it won't be enough to share with someone, as you will love to gulp it alone. 
You can go for it once.  üòâ

Plate-de-Poultry,from the name you can guess that this restaurant used to serve decent  poultry items.Located in the food court of the Lake Mall this junction is a hidden gem. Before visit I had never thought this will come out so well from quality.Visited this place in lunch with the friends and we have tried lots of different items.In egg preparations, Egg Florentine was delicious and divine. Shakshuka was amazingly tasty, recommended one. Mutton and cheese omelette was terrific, another highly recommended of them. In drinks, Lemon mint iced teas was a bliss, Shirley‚Äôs temple was something different we have tried and it‚Äôs wonderful. In Chicken items, Chicken wings in barbeque sauce was the winner, it‚Äôs lipsmacking and yummy. One can also try the Saffron rice with chicken. Cajun spice sizzler was enjoyable. You can try their Chello kabab platter, the kabas were soft and tempting. Atlast the kheer and dry fruit thick shake was splendid, a shake which is something very unique,a must try from their junction.

This one's located at the food court in Lake Mall. I went for a movie with my friends and we decided to have lunch at the food court. We were searching amongst the stalls when we came across this one called Plate-de-Poultry. So here's the list of what all we had :
1. Mutton and cheese omlette - this is by far the best preparation of omlette I have ever had. It's loaded with cheese and juicy mutton. I am surely coming back just to try it again.
2. Chicken wings in barbeque sauce- juicy chicken wings glazed in barbeque sauce with mayo dip is my all time favourite. 
3. Egg Florentine - two round rusk breads with veggie and a poached egg topping. Tastes great.
4. Cajun spiced chicken sizzler - the thick breast pieces are cooked with unique spices which gives a salty and spicy taste, and that sizzle will take your breath away.
5. Chello kebab- though not like the signature chelo kebabs from heritage restaurants, this one is tasty and sure to make your tummy happy and full.
6. Lemon mint iced tea - this iced tea has a typical lemon and mint flavour which I had throughout the whole meal, it was that good.
7.  Shirley's temple- this is a very unique orange coloured mocktail and tastes brilliant.
8. Kheer and dry fruit thick shake - thick fruit shake with kheer and honey will make you go gaga. 
This small stall at the food court is good enough to catch your eyes and make you order everytime you visit the mall. The service is quick with the orders and they won't keep you waiting for long. The price is also reasonable. The food is hygienic and tasty.

A kiosk located in the food court of lake Mall. Bright and vivid. I had no idea about how their food would be because I hadn't had good food in the food court there. 
This took me by surprise by the lovely food quality and varieties they serve.
We ordered for lemon mint iced tea, Shirley's temple for refreshers. And barbeque chicken wings with dip as starters. 
‚úîÔ∏è The mutton keema omlette is a must try (I'm definitely coming back to have this again) . 

We also ordered the following :- 
Shaakshuka - an egg and veggie pie kinda thing .
‚úîÔ∏èEgg Florentine - spinach and poached eggs in toasted buns with cheese 
Chello kebab - quantity wise amazing. A lot of veggies, and chicken sashlik and grilled tomatoes. 

We also tried mikshakes from the milkiss brand. The kheer and dry fruit milkshake, and Choco chip shake.

You should definitely try the food here, it's amazing. Loved it!!

Went there today with a few friends. Located in the food court area of lake mall this place serves one of the best chicken and egg delicacies. Our menu comprised of mocktails, shakes and eatables and each and every dish we ordered were delectable.
From the mocktail section we ordered,
1. Lemon Mint Iced Tea
2. Shirley's Temple
Both of the drinks were equally refreshing and undoubtedly provided an amazing start to the food journey.
They have a speciality of making thick shakes. So from the thick shake menu we ordered-
1. Kheer and Dry Fruit thick Shake
2. Choco Chips Thik Shake
Both of the shakes were amazing and they justified the name of thick shake. The flavours were amazing. There were ample amounts of dry fruits in the first and dark Choco Chip in the latter. These shakes are highly recommended
From the food menu we ordered-
1. Mutton and Cheese Omelette - best omelette I have ever had. Unique and delicious. Do try it!
2. Chicken Wings in Barbecue Sauc- it was delicious and was served with Mayonnaise
3. Chello Kebab - this dish had a decent portion of rice with big dollop of butter with 2type of kebabs, grilled tomatoed and poached egg on top. The kebabs were succulent. This dish is a tasty and wholesome dish!
4. Saffron Rice with a Chicken Side Dish- the saffron rice was great and so was the chicken side dish we ordered separately whose name I can't recall. Anyway, the chicken complimented the rice perfectly. It had a perfect balance of spicy and sweet.
5. Egg Florentine- it tasted good!
6. Cajun Spiced Sizzled- one of the best sizzlers I have had in a long time.
7. Shaakshuka- it was a uniqus dish and was very tasty
Thoughg this place is placed as a kiosk but the food it offers is amazing! I would recommend this place to every food lover and would myself visit again!
Happy Fooding ‚ô•

If you're really hunting for a continental cuisine like egg and chicken then this is the right place for you. The place is located on 4th Floor, Yum Street, Lake Mall, Rashbehari Avenue, Lake Market Area, Kolkata.¬†

Place is very beautiful and cool at the same time. Liked this place not because of the food and taste only but the fusion they create. Staff is very generous and service is neat and fast.

                    Coming on to the food.
I tried :

Drinks :

1) Lemon Mint Iced Tea :A great and refreshing way to enjoy tea with nice touches of mint and lemon. It's refreshing! It's healthy! It's low in calories! Non-Alcoholic drink.

                    2) Lavender Lemonade :
This is a fresh squeezed lemonade made with coconut water and lavender simple syrup. It's just as gorgeous as it is refreshing.

                    3) Shirley's Temple :
It is a non-alcoholic mixed drink traditionally made with ginger ale and a splash of grenadine, garnished with a cherry.

                    4) Kheer and Dry Fruit thick shake :
This kheer and dry fruits shake is very filling and you might like to skip a meal after having it.
It has a sweet, creamy and flavorful taste of badam (almonds), milk ghee, saffron and cardamom.¬†

5) Choco Chips Thick Shake :
It's thick, creamy and so refreshing.

Starters :

1) Chicken Wings in Barbeque Sauce :
It's hot, spicy, or sweet flavored wings. Absolutely love it.

2) Egg Florentine :
Heavenly combination of fluffy muffins, spinach, poached eggs and white sauce, this dish would make a great weekday treat for a loved one. <3

                    Main Course :

1) Chello Kebabs :
Popular dish which consists of cooked butter rice and a variety of broiled mutton and chicken and is served with butter, egg yolk, raw onions and broiled tomatoes.

2) Cajun Spiced Sizzler :
This sizzler is undoubtedly yummy & sizzling, laden with a exotic spicy mix of chicken, chillis, eggs poach, onions & more.¬†

3) Saffron Rice with Chicken :
The saffron rice with chicken really makes it special. It is also a very healthy meal. It was outstanding.¬†

Overall, this place is a must visit for every foodie in the city.¬† I actually fell in love with this place and will be back here very soon. :)

On the day of Sashthi-2017, after watching movie in Priya,while me and my friends were searching for a heavy meal in the food court of Lake mall,we found 6 combo options in Plate-de-Poultry. We took 3 combo non-veg meal and one special non-veg meal. Taste,quality and quantity of these both type of combos were good. But the only thing is that there was no such markable difference between taste of rice of two combos I.e. spicy red rice and yellow rice. Taste wise both were nearly same. Lastly the only drawback is the lemonade,which was the part of combo non-veg meal. It tasted really bad. Otherwise these combos were good and atleast once one should try.

But the only thing is that there was no such markable difference between taste of rice of two combos I.e. spicy red rice and yellow rice. Taste wise both were nearly same. Lastly the only drawback is the lemonade,which was the part of combo non-veg meal. It tasted really bad. Otherwise these combos were good and atleast once one should try.

The lemonade in the combo meal is too salty and without any ice-cubes making the taste so bad. Plus thr fried egg has no salt in it. Their serving time is long. I do not recommend it at all.

Wisecracking about chicken can only take a chicken - joint so far (one point) in the journey and no more. Witty one liners and tall claims have to be matched with actions, and, in the case of food, quality (as well as quantity).
If their fast food is to be compared to other popular joints in town then they will be rated even lesser than amateur home made preparations. The place is a waste of money and a useless addition of calories, low on taste, quality and value. If someone tries out the place keeping a KFC or a Chaiwala (in tollygung) in mind, then they will be in for hardcore disappointment.
I have not tasted any drinks to comment on them but their food in general, and burger and French fries in particular, is less than basic and awful.

Located at the corner of yum Street. This place is surely a gem. They serve poultry based dishes. Their service was quick and they were courteous as well as helpful in choosing the dish. Now coming to the quality and quantity of food, the House sizzler that I ordered was finger licking good, good enough in appearance to excite the taste buds. Probably one of the best sizzlers I had so far. The quantity is  enough for 2 hungry people! The price is reasonable; the bonus being they don't charge any extra GST charge!I loved this place absolutely! 
This place is highly recommended.

A small outlet in Lake Mall( near Lake market area) serving poultry based food items and also offering a wide variety of shakes. We tried their chicken schintzels. It was really too good in taste and finger licking good. These are mainly fried chicken strips served with mayonnaise dip and ketchup sauce. The chicken strips were large in size and good in proportion.

Service was a bit slow. Otherwise food was really good. Prices were average. Would surely visit there again.

Loved eggs Benedict over here at 1st time. When we went to have it the next time,the breads were burnt and eggs overdone. So big disappointment there,but still I would recommend having it as it was delicious. They themselves come up with suggestions and recommended chicken schnitzel to us which was again bad due to a weird masala sprinkled on top. Their combo of 4 pieces of chicken sandwich with french fries was decent,but could have had a bit more chicken in it.But a big yay to the women behind the counter for being so good with their customers!

Corner location in lake mall food court, they boast of their chicken and egg delicacies and  beverage options called milk kis.
Ordered grilled chicken which was served with 3 garlic breads, a poach and a lil green salad and a caesar salad which I will say although well seasoned was a little low on chicken bt again offered two complementary bread.
Colourful plates and quite filling. A recommended place to try out in the yum street food court. Although didnt try but milk shake appeared yummy too.

This outlet of Plate De Poultry is situated at the food court of Lake Mall. We had ordered a portion of Chicken Nuggets and Chicken Schnitzel. The order took around 30 minutes to arrive , that too after a couple of reminders inspite of being told that it would take around 15 minutes. Quality wise it was a bit disappointing taking into account the prices. Since there are not much options available for these type if items at the Food Court this place will draw in crowds. Overall in times of need this can be an options!

We ordered Chicken Strip and Chicken Schitnzel which were served with 3 type of dips (which was amazing). Taste was good, quantity was great and service was equally good.

'Plate-de-Poultry' is located in the food court of Lake mall also known as the Yum Street.It serves different preparations of egg amd chicken. After hearing rave reviews about this place, I decided to give it a visit yesterday. The decor is nothing out of the world and every time I tried to ask something the waiter was nowhere to be seen. A quick glance of the menu gave me the idea of the pricing of the food. Every item was overpriced. I went for the fried chicken wings and thought that I would go for other items if the wings were delicious. The food took eleven minutes to arrive. The dish looked delicious but all articles that coruscate with resplendence are not truly
auriferous. The entire thing was tasteless. The batter was fried well but tasteless. The chicken inside was black in colour. I do not know why that happened but now I am sure that the chicken was not a fresh one as I felt nauseated all the way back home. I will never visit this place again.

The eatery is located in a corner of Lake Mall food court and yet grabs attention because of its peculiarity in serving only chicken and egg products enjoyed by most people today. I have eaten here thrice and tried varied items on the menu. The food prices were cheaper when it was very new and now they have a higher range of prices for the food items and have expanded their menu as well. Food wise great servings and wholesome food prepared and presented well. Tried chicken and cheese omelette, eggs benedict, grilled chicken sandwich, chicken liver omelette and fluffy egg white omelette. Plus the sides served along with omelette of different types are good accompaniments. In all, i like dropping by the lake mall just to visit this eatery :)

Chicken steak and Chicken Roulade are the two dishes am very fond of. Being an health freak I mostly order for the steak as it is completely oil free. The egg benedicts is some thing which I had during my last visit and I was surprised by its awesome taste (not a good option for take away thought, I believe). A visit to their store in Lake mall is a must to experience the best of their variety. And the best part is its very pocket friendly. Heaven for Chicken lovers.

It didn't have a dedicated establishment per say, but it's small outlet on the food court of Lake Mall was quite good enough. The price seemed okayish with generous helpings. We ordered Royal Devilled Egg and Egg Benedict. While the Egg Benedict tasted delicious with its combination of poached eggs and chicken, the Royal Devilled Egg was unable to live up to its reputation. The quantity served was sufficient. Giving it a try won't be a loss.

My first unplanned priorly uninvestigated visit at Yumm Street - the food court of lake mall ; and amonsgt the newer outlets Plate-de-Poultry caught my attention. Being a lone diner, i could not have anything more than one portion of CHICKEN ROULADE. The lady at the kiosk was very professional knowing her job well and briefed me about their PDP specials.But then they took almost pretty long half an hour to deliver the dish.
The dish had a sliced log of minced chicken ( tasted very similar to sausages) 3 pieces of garlic breads and some regular salad. The dip was supposed to be chilly honey sauce , but some low quality mayonnaise was given that too in an amount on lesser side.the dip lacked any punch of honey or chilli , hence i would say the overall dish tasted dry and bland.
Will update the review on further visits.

Whenever I visit lake mall this has to be the place of my selection to have a quick snack. So many variety of dishes made with egg & chicken. Specially love their Bull's eye Chicken Steak. It's one of its kind. One must try it to get the heavenly flavours of chicken and egg.

Like this place in lake mall food court... it's just a kiosk but service good quality food... staffs are very friendly and well behaved... service was fast too... we tried there 1. Egg Benedict... tasted very good... also the presentation was eye catching, it comes with crispy french fries and chilli mayo and tomato sauce, 2. Mango magic... ordinary mango shake with vanilla ice cream, it also tasted good but the ice cream was very bad... 3. Chicken burrito wrap... good, overall it's a good experience... pocket pinch was acceptable...

This outlet at Yum Street,the food court of Lake Mall, serves a wide and interesting range of egg and chicken items. They seem to have put in a lot of thought in creating their menu. They even offer healthy options for the calorie conscious,like egg white omlette and salads. I tried their Spanish omlette which was soft and had a lot of veggies...three colour capsicums,onions,jalape√±o,olives,mushrooms etc. It was excellent and very filling. Along with this they served toasted bread and ketchup. The downside was the coffee which though machine made was quite cold. Why can't they serve a hot cup of coffee? It would have made my meal perfect!

I visited this place during the pujas for lunch in the middle of pandal hopping with some of my friends. We were ravenous and hoping for something substantial at a decent price. So, the 5 course combo meal naturally caught out eyes. It contained a salad, 2 pieces of fried chicken wing, ¬†a butter corn rice, a chicken toscana and a scoop of vanilla ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce. At a mere 220, it was quite a lot, basically a three-course meal in itself. The taste however, was okayish. The rice was underseasoned, the chicken was a bit bland and the ice cream was half melted. Service was prompt and we even got a plate of complimentary chicken wings for making a purchase above 500. Would I revisit this joint again? Most certainly. They have some omelettes on the menu which looked very tempting. Would I try out this particular dish again? Probably not.

Plate-de-Poultry is the swag factor of the lake mall to be really modest. Located at the far end of the food court, we chanced upon it accidentally and were a bit skeptical at first. But the lady behind the counter is a really sweet person and helped us choose the right mix of food. The best thing that i tasted here was the sensational Egg's Benedict, which i would recommend to all! Besides that the Cheese and Chicken Omelette was lip smacking. Even the dips they serve are delicious. And the pricing is very moderate compared to the amazing quality and quantity on the plate.

The staff is really very warm and makes you feel at home everytime! Its my must go everytime I visit Lake Mall.
4.5 stars for the warm staff and the Egg's Benedict :P

A lil joint tucked in Yum Street serving something different from the usual fare of food courts.
Lots of different types of omelettes and side dishes.
Quality could have been better I must say.
The chicken and cheese omelette had few tiny strips of chicken, the garlic toast were so small in size they looked like biscuits and I better not mention the creamy chicken which was a total disaster !!!
The Spanish omelette, potato wedges and red rice were pretty good though.

Since the yum street food court of Lake Mall opened its door, "Plate-de-Poultry" is the most frequently visited outlet by me, hence a review about this place was long due and after trying out their 90% of their offerings its time to pen down this review.
Among the 10-12 outlets in yum street food court, "plate-de-poultry" is perhaps the only joint serving simple yet distinctive items.
The amount of versatility and experimenting agility which they have put in while setting up their menu is really commendable.
Upon the foundation of common and simple ingredients like "EGGS" and "CHICKEN", they have managed to create and offer a wide variety of dishes for different taste buds.
‚Ä¢Omlettes- We all usually keep having omelettes every now and then on breakfast and supper or some other time, but "Plate-de-Poultry" have managed to rethink our approach towards it by offering variety of omlettes like- cheese and tomato omlette, cheese and chicken omelette, cheese and jalepeno omletes, cheese mushroom and herb omelette, the good old Spanish omelettes etc;
Other lipsmacking and acclaimed egg delicacies like- egg benedict, spicy stuffed egg, egg salad, German potato and boiled eggs, deviled egg etc; each of these are served with perfection.
‚Ä¢Now coming to their chicken oriented delicacies- "Plate-de-poultry" scores full marks in this department as well by offering a wide range of succumbing chicken delicacies.
Be it universal favorites like- chicken pakodas, chicken cheese balls, chicken fingers, BBQ chicken wings etc; to panini/submarine sandwiches and burgers, they manage to leave an impressive impact to our palette.
Their effort in managing to keep a handful of healthy eating options like- EGG WHITES OMELETTES, CHICKEN/VEG/COTTAGE CHEESE SALADS etc; by considering those who prefers to maintain a strict diet and keep their total calorie consumption within a specific limit is really worth appreciating.
They also provide us with an option of low carbohydrate vinaigrette dressing along with the original ones for our salads in order to manage our overall calorie intake.
Till date "Plate-de-poultry" has successfully managed to satisfy my taste buds without compromising with my diet and health, be it their succumbing "Chicken Caesar Salad", "grilled Chicken, the protein rich microwaved fluffy egg whites omelettes etc; everything has delivered the everlasting sumptuous magic to my taste buds.
Though sometimes their service lacks the expected swiftness and speed but they made it up to me every time with their delectable offerings.
Overall one of the best option for you to enjoy a wide variety of delicacies in a reasonable expense in the complete food court or perhaps in the whole lake market area, especially their diet and nutrition friendly options makes them one of the most sought after eatery in the nearby vicinity.

one of the QSR at YUM STREET...Lake Mall....serves a menu which is a little different at a very reasonable rate...i tried their Eggs Benedict...and it was really good...with french fries...mayo and ketchup...@150...not a pocket pinch...3 portions...just a small suggstion, replace the chopped green bell peppers with Chives (roshun pata) which is more traditional...and if you can top the eggs with a little hollandaise sauce....but overall, i liked it, and i will definitely visit again...

I generally dont like the food court food of malls since they are nothing special or different from the normal. But this place definitely stands out. Have been there a couple of times and have loved it. The sea food omelette is completely awesome and a must must try. You can also try the chicken liver on toast. The egg white fluffy omelette is so so but if you are the health conscious types thats for you. You also have a low carb salad which you can try. Besides this the basic chicken pakora and the fried stuff is also there. I am surely going back here

My dad is old school...so he was 'very' hesitant when I took him to Yum street. Ordered the chicken wings..upon seeing the dish first he squinted,frowned and tried a piece. By the end he was licking his fingers;-)
Very affordable continental dishes...need to try Caesar salad.
P.S: They need to be a tad bit generous with their dips..

Me and chicken‚Äôn eggs are quite inseparable since the childhood ‚ÄúSunday ho ya Monday roz khao ande days‚Äù!  So needless to say I was quite excited to find this joint in the food court of LAKE MALL in lake market area . I have to say that it was after a long time I really loved a food court counter just for their food ! I cannot recommend their Devilled egg  and Spicy stuffed egg enough ÔÅä They have some good omlettes as well . Prices are very moderate . I am just going to go back to those devils !

I had the Chicken Pakora yesterday. The lady behind the counter was really polite. The food was affordable and really good as a snack. The pakoras were pretty big in size and filled with chicken which I find lacking in most other places. I liked how the pakoras weren't filled up with stuffing as we usually find. The chicken inside was really juicy and it was served piping hot so I found it to be really tasty. The menu sports a number of items and I would surely like to try the other items on my next visit.

Tried a chicken platter from here..first of all the corn rice was too sour n tasted of brine from the corn preservatives.  Second the chicken were too small n too tough to chew on n third I got a hair in my food n fourth it just takes way too ling for them to serve food. Bad experience never going back there again

Had the chicken ceasar salad today and quite liked it. Two bread portions were offered with the dish and they were good too. Being fried in butter, they were too good to resist with just two. Overall, a nice experience. Will surely try out the other delicacies the next time I am at the Mall.

I only had the Chicken Caesar Salad here...and i just totally loved it. The salad was totally delicious. The mayonnaise dressing was just near perfect. The chicken was juicy and good... They served it with an egg poach in top. I feared I would need to add salt but they did something which made the egg taste really good. It also came with two toasts.. Crunchy and soaked in butter.... Yummmmy!!!!
If they maintain this standard.. It can go places...

Had the grilled chicken with rice and gravy. Tastewise all were good. The rice was a simple fried rice. The gravy was the usual Chinese gravy. Coming to the chicken.. Soft, succulent and tasted really good. The chicken was dressed in paprika sauce I guess... That's the taste I got. In all... I liked the taste ..but a little bit more of chicken would have made this dish a great one.

Nice new eatery at the food-court of the newly opened 'Lake Mall'. Ordered an egg salad, on my first visit, which was quiet tasty. This place has some healthy food options in the menu, apart from the oily and spicy stuff, one expects at such eateries. On my subsequent visits, have had their Egg-Benedict with coffee and French fries. Though, the egg-benedict tasted good, I had somehow hoped for a thicker piece of chicken ham.

One sweet thing about the non veg combo we ordered was the little dessert that they gave us. Its had ice cream( basically cream) and a sweet. This dish tasted good and was quite resonable. Waiting to taste more of their menus.

I just love the quality they serves..its so healthy..there is no artificial overloaded coating in any of the fried items..tried almost all the dishes of chicken but a big fan of their bulls eye chicken steak..and the wings they serves is amazing. And the cherry on the top is their behaviour...way to go. All the best .

Went to the newly opened Food Court in Lake Mall for the first time and tried Egg Benedict and Breaded Chicken with Cheese and loved both. The only problem is not with the outlet but the Mall Authorities as they provide poor plastic cutlery and that means only spoon and fork b ut no knife something that is a must for Continental food.
