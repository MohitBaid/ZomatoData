This is probably one of the prestigious places in Kolkata yet it has failed to provide service and maintain quality food and sweets. This particular outlet is on VIP road and is quite easily accessible. I remember visiting here as a kid a couple of times which is exactly why I was much surprised to see this place has changed so much.

We took
1. CHANA BATURA--The chana in the chana batura lacked taste and salt. The pickle served on the plate was the only good thing. Also it was definitely not a plate worth 84 bucks.
2. GULABJAMUN--The jamuns were nice and hot but weren't worth the price.

The only pro about the place is they maintain hygiene standards.
Definitely not recommended.

Great food within budget.Haldirams is best for its vegetarian items. Nice and simple ambiance.Tasty food (everything on the menu tastes great). Cordial behaviour of the staffs.One can smell the flavour of the food from outside the restaurant( not exaggurating).😉
Conclusion: To meats lover, undoubtedly this place is a must try to treat the taste buds with yummy veggies dishs.

Chinese is not up to the mark 
Chola bhatura is Horrible
Dahi vada is too spicy 
Washroom is terrible the door lock doesn't work and cleanliness is inhumanly bad

Definetly this place doesn't need a description and it's not new.
This place offers you from wide variety of sweets to variety of veg snacks items.
As per the sweets they are famous by the brand name Haldirams and it's quite well known for the quantity and the quality in the local market.
Yesterday dropped by this place for having some quick snacks as to feed my hunger.
Ordered for Dhokla along with some Lassi.
Dhokla was soft and fresh and tasted more than just good and the quantity was good for the price. I was satisfied by the taste.
The Lassi over here comes in small cute bottles in flavours of Almond,Mango,Milk ,Badam, Strawberry.I personally tried out the badam , milk and green apple which I liked very much. They are not too costly too.

Ordered Online ----------- Khandwi and Mattar Pump.



The PROS :- Already famous for their iconic sweets. Wanted to have something Gujrati... so ordered Khandwi and Mattar Pump (the name fascinated me).   There were 6 pieces of Khandwi which was totally Smooth & Chatpata garnished with grated coconut and coriander leaves. Mattar Pump was something Crispy savoury snack with tasty peas filling. With its taste only I could feel that the oil in which it was fried was healthy. Nice Crispiness and taste. They also sent packets of tamarind chutney & tomato ketchup. Nice quality. Low cost. Good packaging. Fast service within 30-35 mins. Their food items totally satisfied my food cravings. 


The CONS :-  Nothing found.


( P.S. - Their Dosas & Chaats are also quite lip- smacking... )

Veg fried rice with veg manchurian: really good to eat & freshly made. 

Value for money. GST applied

Being a huge Haldiram's fan, this outlet disheartened me massively. I ordered 3 butter masala dosas and chole bhatura along with moong halwa and rajbhog. The dosas lacked in taste; the bhatura was a bigger version of the average bengali luchi. Honestly, it did not taste like bhatura at all. A portion of my dosa was burnt; I would have let it go had it been tasty. You can get a better filling inside the dosa in small low budget places; why visit Haldiram's then? All my money gone to waste, and couldn't even eat half of what I'd ordered. Only saving grace was the halwa and rajbhog. My goodness! Please upgrade the quality.

This one is the main outlet and production unit of Haldirams. Apart from sweets it has a Vegetarian restaurant serving South Indian food and some north Indian dishes. Food quality is good and price reasonable if you consider its a proper dine in restaurant. Some must try things are the kulfi and the gulab jamun they have, its really great. They also have a Fuchka or Golgappa counter and while its really expensive compared to the road side stalls the taste is really good.

Since childhood, I am a regular customer of this outlet. Mouthwatering chats, phuchkaa, dosa, kulfi and banarasi paan-I always felt like- Alice in Wonderland. 
Oh! but now the times have changed. Prices are high and food quality is very poor. 
Our total billing amount could have made us super happy if we went to some  non vegetarian restaurant. I should have trusted the Puchka dada of my para. The potato mixture of Puchka was salt less. 👎Only Gulab Jamuns were very good.

So was their with a friend of mine for an evening chit chat  session.  We had a chinese bhel and a papri chat. The idea of Chinese  bhel was nice since bengalis always have that sweet corner for the hakka chinese style.  The the bhel was personifying that idea,  crispy noodles,  slices of bell peppers,  tomato chilli's and those chinese condiment made it a mouth tingling  and a satisfying  treat and about the papri chat its was hygienic introduction of boiled geen moong dal was unique and all in all a good plate of chat.  The place was spacious and was apt for the purpose  we had. Alls well!  :)

Puchka might seem pricey...but they r really flavoursome!😋
They also serve awesome veg thali option!The thali is a complete filling meal option at a economical price!

We also ordered pizza on our last visit...it also tasted good !The pizza base is crisp and served with lots of mozarellla cheese! Recommended 😊

Haldirams is popular for its different varieties of sweets and veg dishes.As soon as you enter this outlet you can see huge range of sweets from their iconic kaju barfi to laddu to rasgulla to sandesh.You ask and they have it.There is also a dry fruit section and snacks section.They also have some 6-7 varieties of pastry.In this outlet there is a separate dine in section where you can have your favourite chaat or chhole bhature or veg thali or dhokla or pasta and the list goes on.We ordered chhole bhature first.The bhatura was literaly huge and they served pindi chana with it and some sliced onion and pickle.
Next we ordered chocolate pastry.It was nice and soft.We also had rasgulla and malai cham cham.Both the sweets were fresh and tasty.
The staff was also extremely cordial and cheerful.
Overall it was a great experience.

I'm not a veg person, but this happens to be the place which makes veg dishes taste super tasty. I love the huge store that welcomes you as soon as you walk in. I make sure that I buy a box of kaju barfi every time I visit the place because Haldiram's Kaju Barfis taste like heaven! I also love their chocolate sweets and I can never have enough of them! The food court on the right serves the best possible veg breakfast, I absolutely love their kachuris, dosas, chhola bhatura and dhoklas. I've also tried their thaalis and they never failed to impress me. A place you can't afford to miss if you are a vegetarian and a must visit place for non vegetarians as well.

Love all the snacks and main course too.They serve them hot fresh and hygienically.
Just didn't like the mishti doi.Though the taste was quite good but the smell was really bad.The flavor of keora was not going well with the mishti doi.And they provide tap water to drink.This is what I don't like about this place.
By the way I just love the place.Best place to have vegetarian food.Their quantity was also enough.

A Place I have been visiting since childhood. And by far the best place to have vegetarian food.

 There are a number of dishes which I absolutely love  in Haldirams and they are Chole Bhature, Masala Dosa, Pav Bhaji and Mixed Chaat. And I mostly order these. All of these dishes tastes fantastic. 

The food here is always fresh and tasty. The quantity is also good. Although I don't like the Chowmein with Veg Manchurian dish there its kind off bland in taste. All in all its a pocket friendly place and there food is definitely worth the money.

The only bad thing about this place is that they provide you normal tap water to drink which is according to me very unhygenic.

The thalis are ok, in quantity sense, but not so in quality sense.
The paneer dishes don't taste good.. 
The dosa is good though.

A place that I have been going to from childhood. It's quite a nostalgic trip for me to be here. Growing up this was a place we would save up our pocket money and go to as it was huge and the decor and ambience all was too palatial.

They had sweets of various types and highest quality@ on offer and it was a custom to go there before any visit to relatives place to buy sweets. I can still taste their ladoos and barfis.

I had my first pizza here, they used to make a onion pizza and a mushroom pizza which were just fabulous and us 90's kids of Kolkata got introduced to Pizza Hut and Domino's a bit late in life. Jokes apart cleanliness and hygiene is synonymous with Haldirams and each of their outlets maintain highest standards. Also their namkeens and savoury items are something that is found in every household. This outlet also serves great slush and Jalebis and they were a favourite during our childhood as in weekends after cricket we friends used to come here and hang out.

Coming to the food , they have an in house dining area and you get Various snacks and meals here. I tried out their Jeera Rice and Dal combo. Trust me it's heavenly.
One can also try their special Thali and the Chole Bhature.

A must have is their recently launched range of lassis and Milk Shakes. I tried the Kesar badam milk and the Green Apple Lassi. Both were awesome.

Thank you for maintaining the same quality . Will be here soon

This is a place where we frequently visit quite often.we have tried all the delicacies in the menu. The rates though are exborent. A Masala Dosa costs approx RS 110. The Dahi vadas are Tasty , so are the dhoklas. The samosas and khasta kachoris are small in size but big in taste. The different types of chats are to die for... The mini thalis at RS 200 are quite filling. You can have lassis, cold drinks, coffee for beverage's.you can have pani puris, Pavbhajis or chowmein. Ou also gave sandwiches and pastries available. Appart from 100 varities of sweets and bhujias.the ambience is good and air condition works perfectly well.a good place to hangout with your partner or friends.

Conveniently located near the Airport, this outlet offers fresh food and packaged food to take back.

Its a really huge outlet and it comprises of both Retail Unit as well as Self Service Restaurant. 
Should mention that the Retail Unit is huge and has almost all the varieties of products offered Haldirams.

Opens at 9:00 in the morning till 22:00 in the evening, it has a decent range of Fast Food and Veg Delicacies to offer.  You can visit Haldiram for some excellent for Dosa, Chana Bhaturey, Sweets, Dhoklas, Dahi Bara, Samosa Chaat etc. The sweets offered are great and not overpowering.

Haldiram's Kaaju Barfi and Raj Khachori is all time favourite of mine. Recommended !!

However, the prices are always on a higher side. 

Though they have ample parking space; I have always faced issues in parking the 4-wheeler due to heavy rush around.

A reputed sweet shop in the city of Kolkata. Ordered rosmalai. The taste was awesome. Loved it. The quality is well maintained. Also took home delivery one time. The service was quick and was quality was not hampered. Loved it.

Reviewing just the restaurant, it's 0830 hrs and we are having breakfast. The tables are filthy and the floor is being mopped in our presence, it's slippery and soapy. The tables had leftovers from

The Puri and the potato curry is really good, like the ones you get in the North. The Kachories were really great.

Lassi was a dissappointment as it was bottled and coffee from a machine??

Cleanliness is expected from a place of its reputation and size

This outlet is spacious and gives the feel of a food Mall. All sorts of sweet delicacies are available which pleases the taste buds as well as eyes. Assorted  packages of dry fruits, namkeens, sweets are available. Ideal for gifting on festivals. Gulab jamun, malpua are a must try. The self service counter is on the right side along with seating area. Had Raj kachori, chole bhature here which tasted good.

There is something wrong with Haldiram these days. They have increased the price and reduced the quantity. My family being marwari are regular visitors of Haldiram since the year it opened and we have witnessed all the changes they have introduced. Haldiram was famous for their rajasthani thali however they removed it from their menu.
Taste, quantity and hype about this place has went down but still to enjoy a proper veg, hygienic, Indian food, this place remains a first choice.
One can also place sweet orders for weddings or any other occasions. They have amazing package food collection for sell. Be it sweet, salty, namkin, bhujia, bhel, chocolates, cakes, they have multifarious option. 😍

what should I say about the place..I love it too much for my morning food....I go there thrice....There are varieties of items..but I just taste some of this...so according to my experience
1.club kachori-50rs/plate,or kesar jalebi 25rs/piece or  hot gulabjamun 15rs/piece complete my breakfast.
2.In lunch u can order any meal which is pocket friendly for u.
Total cost should be around 200 for breakfast for 2 person.
Next to the service,it's self service but there are always high queue in the outer counter where jalebi and club kachori is fried.so u should wait 10 minutes according to the circumstances.Some time it really annoying for u,as but for me the food experience is very good,but the last time I should wait 15 minute to get the food so it's irritate me..but it is a very good place to have a fine food experience,go and eat but always look at ur health....
For me in 10
food 7.5 service (no mark for my service)5(very slow in the outer stall,slow supply of kachori) atmosphere 8 
So u also have a great experience there.
also taste chola bhatura..it's also great......
*it is according to my experience,eat & share ur experience.(I don't lunch there so I can not tell u about the lunch menu ,taste and quality,according to many,it is also very tasteful)

Haldiram’s Prabhuji at VIP Road, is a very big restaurant with two floored where you can enjoy snacks, food, sweets, soft drinks and other refreshment items which also includes street chat items. I have tried Raj Kachori, papri chat with lassi and one sweet of rasgulla. All taste simply good because of its flavour and look as well. There are more than hundred items in the restaurant which all taste good. There is self service system in the restaurant. The restaurant is very big where easily two hundred people can be accommodated at a time. The restaurant is superb in interior with aristocratic look and fine furniture. Though it is so big but still it is very spacious. The environment and ambience is perfect to visit here with your friends and family. There is more than fifty staff that stands at each food corner zone to serve you with prompt service. Apart from these food items, there is also a pastry and ice cream corner inside the restaurant which you can enjoy after your main food. As I visited on Sunday, the entire restaurant was full and we had to wait fifteen minutes to get our table. This is one of the biggest restaurant of Haldiram’s in Kolkata which is worth to visit and enjoy its tasty items.

A sudden mood for dosa took us to haldriams, my first visit to this place , considered it as a bus stop prior this. The place is so brightly done , the central  chandelior in the middle adds a lavish vibe to the it. The seating part though is okayish.
Orderded one Masala dosa served with two chutneys and sambar , one paw bhaji. Both tasted impeccably good and i was more than satisfied. The white forest cake we had was a nice and sizeable pastry in such less price.

Quantity of items on thali is enough for two.... just awesome.... the best thing was today that I met one of my old college friend after 6 years and had great time together. thanks Haldiram's.

This is a good place for sweets, snacks and vegetarian food. Haldiram is famous for its kaju barfi and other snacks like bhujia, etc. You will get all the products of Haldiram at this place freshly made and beside their is a veg restaurant. I love the special thali that they serve with baby naan, jeera rice and main courses to choose from among the available list of that day. Situated at VIP road it's a great place for snacks.

Product Name- Aam Dahi
Price- 30/- 

I had purchased six cups of aam dahi on 30th October 2016 @ Rs. 30/- each with the expectation of the quality as expected from Haldiram's, but alas! It turned to be much cheap quality because the orange color mixed with the dahi was just like the color of roadside orange icecream stick. The bitter taste of the color was predominant. Hope to see the required changes in this product.

I have been visiting this place often since last 7 years and every time they never stop disappointing me. The prices keep increasing by rs.10 every 6 months or so and the quality deteriorates. The only good thing which is still left is the pastry. The chaats used to be good but recently they have reduced the quantity. The dosa is something which you should avoid since the masala is very less inside and the chutney will give you a stomach-ache (It happened recently to a friend of mine). The chola batura was decent. But the worst part is yet to come. When I tried buying a bottle of campa-cola, the sub-staff informed it was rs.40 (rs.10 more than MRP). At billing, it was billed at rs.35(rs5 hiked). That's not it. Then I found it to be expired. I asked for a change. But OMG! All the products had expired in the month of May only. I mean already you guys charging more than MRP and now the customer isn't even getting a proper product!! Not up to the mark at all!

This outlet of Haldiram's offers an altogether different Menu from the other two outlets (Chowringee & Ballygunge). Situated on VIP Road near the Rajarhat Flyover, this outlet is quite big having 2 separate sections, one for confectionaries and the other serves as the restaurant. There's also a small outdoor stall that prepares noodles. The food over here is just awesome!!! I would prefer the the food at this outlet anytime over the other 2 (although the other outlets serve good food as well). Their speciality is their Thali!! It rocks! Serving a variety of items which you can even choose from their wide options, the thali provides more than sufficient quantity of high quality items. The taste is simply wow!! My other 2 favorite picks over here are the Haka Noodles and the Masala Dosa. Both are simply delicious. I'm not at all into Masala Dosa but this is the only place where I would't get tired of having the same. Interior and decor is simple. Overall, a great place for tasty budget food! (y)

This place brings back a lot of memories. I was a regular at this place for two straight years. 

Its location, is its USP  and that is the only reason why it attracts a huge crowd through out the year.


The ambience is nothing to be proud of.


Service is "Self Help"


Coming to food. I, very sadly, have tried their entire menu. 

Their South Indian Section is decent, but the accompaniments are horrific, the sambar which they serve is a north Indian vegetable dal and let's not talk about the coconut chutney.

The North Indian Section is not bad and you might like some of the dishes.

But, Never Ever try the Chinese. Very bluntly speaking,  boiled noodles taste better than what they serve.

There Indian Desert Section on other Hand is to die for, you get hot Gajar ka halwa, which is rare in kol and a not so sweet Gulaab Jamun that melts in your mouth.

All in all its place that I don't recommend for any kind of leisure dining experience, but if you are looking to substitute your Office or college canteen then you might visit this place.

The food was decent.. though they give lot of ghee and butter on the chapatis.. and the paneer was decent too.. however the best option is that u can choose ur own set of meals which is a big plus..

Not good. They charge more for ordinary food. Health wise, it's good as you can trust on them as the cooking ideologies they adopt is extremely good but then nobody would pay more for ordinary food. You have to be extraordinary everytime in the business of food. The innovation has to be there so it's the same dish they have all time. Menu doesn't changed since 4 years.

Nothing special about this place. There are many better veg restaurants if you want to try vegetarian food. You yourself will have to select your food and pay at the counter collect the bill and submit it to collect the food. Few of their preparations are really good. Though most are very average. If you are just there for desserts you will not be disappointed at all.

Located next to anupama housing complex at kaikhali. This outlet has a huge premises and you will have the opportunity to buy every single thing that haldiram group offers. They have huge collection of freshly made or packaged sweetmeats,chocolates and namkeens. There is a separate place to dine in. They offer pure veg items. Thalis are good option. But the quality of their puri, pav bhaji, chola bhatora is not that good anymore.

This outlet of Haldiram’s is very near to my present home and thus I visit here the least. It is a landmark by itself and people refer to the place at Haldiram’s Stop.
The mezzanine cum ground floor has a parking slot while the first floor has the restaurant. It is not always buzzed by customers and hence a perfect place to spend some time.
I went there to meet few friends of mine and thus tried some South Indian stuffs. However, I did not like much of either the hospitality or the food.
Anyone visiting there can tried their boxed sweets which tends to be very well.

Well, Haldiram is well known by its name and it never compromises with quality. But quantity is decreasing day by day. It seems after few months they will only serve plates. And it is too expensive to eat. I don't like to write negetive reviews, but the price of the food forced me to write it. Anyways, the only good thing about VIP road haldiram is its quality.

I think no introduction is required for Haldiram's Restaurant chain. Variety of authentic vegetarian food is available here. And when you are done with your main course.. They have a humongous list of deserts available with them all the time. All items are freshly prepared & are symbol of purity that can be defined by their taste.

Under the roof they have wide variety of tasty and healthy snacks available in container packaging that you can easily carry to your home.

A must try for foodies. 
Try once if you haven't tried it at all. 
High quality standards.

Of course the restaurant hosted us and it's worth mentioning the review so that other people are aware of the staff's bad behaviour. .
Charity begins at home. .leave aside the food., if you do not know how to behave and be gentle, no matter what piece of work you do, it tastes bitter! And I think the person sitting in the cash counter is unaware of this fact! So for him I would have one free and probably very helpful advice and it would be please learn some manners first before getting into any business. .you never know whom u r interacting with ! I highly DO NOT recommend Haldiram at Kaikhali for food lovers particularly vegetarians who want to hv good food vis a vis serene ambience! Cz I think both r synergistic in having a good pleasurable eating experience!
The staff at the cash counter should be changed or harassment to the customers will continue. .

I always prefer this place for authentic veg foods, I think haldirams is a very common name to everyone & needs no introduction, however I go there to taste the chola bhatora only....two pieces of bhatora with a bowl of chole curry will make ur breakfast/,lunch/evening snacks or dinner a complete one. Try this. Onion & pickle also served with it. Other foods are awesome too, & pls don't miss their fuchka.

Veg Recipes at its best. I bet you won't find anywhere better ! The Dahi Phuchka Chaat & Mixed Chat was tangy. The Pav Bhaji was damn delicious, with that authentic smell. Parents & I really liked the Chole Bhature & Masala Dosa, later on. Though , few may find it bit costly, but it's worth it. Hope visiting it again. :))

hmm, the location was nice and well decorated.Food taste was good.We ordered Masala Dosa with butter, Pav Bhaji, Kesari gulab jamun(hot) Rajbhog...
Masala Dosa with butter, Pav Bhaji both are really good in taste. bt they serve masala dosa not so hot.. bt i manage bt in sweets quality was very bad.
in their menu card it shows Kesari gulab jamun(hot) bt i think they hv to change this name to gulab jamun(COLD) no kesar part is there and its totally cold...

If you want to talk with your friends for a long time and eat minimum, this is the ideal hangout. Self service food court, however the people at the counter are somewhat indifferent. Food is fine. Never had a proper thali but quick bites are nice, though not any close to extraordinary. Chola batura, dhokla, Papri chat, dahi phuchka, pav bhaji, cheese grilled sandwich, samosa, dahi vada...a nice range of finger food and street food. The desserts including dal ka halwa, gajar ka halwa, fruit koolfie, rasmalai are indeed nice, so are the beverages like milk shakes, lassi and thandai. Egg-less pastries are also available. Which are nice.

Okay! This is the place we have been to from our childhood. Any occasion, any day! Actually whenever we fell like having some delicious veg pizza / sandwich / barfi / any kinda mithai and snacks, this is our all time favorite outlet. And I just love the besan laddu. <3 All I can say about this place is, Lath Lag Jayegi ( it'll become your second home for sure )..

Haldiram Bhujiawala – Sweet Memories 

I can never forget my first visit to this store dating back to 2004 when my sister got engaged at one of their party halls. It was a small affair of close to 70 guests but it was a pleasant one. 

This place is actually a sweet shop including a hotel with veg food options. It’s an ideal place for people looking for a quick veg munch. Open from 9 in the morning till 10 in the evening, it has a decent range of fast food and veg delicacies to offer. You can visit Haldiram for some excellent for Dosa, Chana Bhaturey, Sweets, Dhoklas and chats like Dahi Bara, Samosa Chat etc. Located 2.5kms before airport it’s better to munch out here than try stale food at the airport.

I have been to this place at times. I really like their sitting arrangements. I have tried all d foods on their menu card. I really like the big thali (not the mini as I don't like puris) ,pav vaji, chola batora , chats, dahi vada .. apart from Kaju barafi ,laddos and their sweets you must try these foods .

The place itself is now called haldiram. This explains the impact of this joint. 

This is one of the best veggy food and snacks place in the city.

I have been to place several times, and tried almost every items. A really satisfying place and has always been famous for its sweets.
It is on the way to airport, so can spent some time before catching flight.
Ambiance is okay, service - well it's self service from counter to your table and also you have to pay first. I don't believe in prepaid order because we can't predict what and how much we will end up eating.
They doesn't sell only bhujiya and sweets but It's a restaurant itself.
Price is reasonable. If you are a vegetarian must visit this place. Among various items my favourite are Dosa, dahi Vada, papri chat and kaju barfi. Thali is also very good option to try.
Staffs are not at all friendly and cashier is also little bit rude.

I was treated to this outlet's soanpapdi, kaju barfi and malpua as part of the dessert after dinner at a friend's place who stays nearby this eatery. Malpua and soanpapdi were good, but what I liked was the kaju barfi. Not too sweet, but just rightly enough, the barfi was very pleasant-tasting and if given an entire box of it I would have devoured them all! I hope to actually visit this place and have some other items in the future.

This joint being the closest to my house has really helped me out in times of hunger. Practically in every week I buy something or the other from here. Me and my mum often come during our veg eating times for dinner. Among various items my favourites are their pav bhaji which I really love, dahi vada which is very delicious. The quality of dahi which they use in their food item is praiseworthy. The dosa items are also well prepared. The thali which they serve is very filling and a good option  for one to try. Apart from these I am not a fan of any other items. Few of the curries are very oily. The dessert items are very enticing. I love their jalebi, gulab jamon and milk cakes. One thing that I feel is that few items are a bit over priced and the main staffs are not friendly and not at all well behaved.

You may think of Haldiram's as the bhujia maker or preserved sweets maker - but have you thought it could be a vegetarian restaurant also? ;)

Situated on airport road near DumDum , this is one of the oldest restaurants I can remember, visiting as a child. Possibly one of the biggest sweet shops you will ever see in your life. Filled with packaged bhujias, rasgullas, gulab jamuns and other sweets, it also houses a restaurant as well. Catering to all sorts of meals - breakfast, lunch, dinner as well as evening snacks, you will be spoilt for choice here. 

Had been there recently around 2 months back. And the place hasn't lost its charm. Families with kids enjoying breakfast, or the occasional lovers coming in for some evening snacks and a romantic conversation. 

I had the poori platter for breakfast, accompanied with 2 warm rasgullas and 1 malpua. Ended the affair with some tasty pan available there. 

This place doesn't have parking per se, but you can park on the roadside without much of an issue. It does have a drive in arrangement as well for drop off, so you can pick your sweets and catch your flight in a jiffy.

An extremely popular Haldiram's outlet since a long time. Big space. Enough seating capacity. I am not a great fan of vegetarian food, but still tried it since I was damn hungry and could not think of anything else at that moment.

The biggest challenge for a glutton in a veg restaurant is the lack of options. You don't seem to find too many dishes with large portions, which can satisfy your hunger. And secondly, I am not a great believer of prepaid orders when I am in a restaurant. I mean it's hard to predict what and how much you'll end up eating. Not everything can be predetermined. Somehow managed to order a couple of Thalis. Mind you, it's self-service, from the counter to your table. They took a whole lot of time to prepare the Puris, which kind of tested my patience. The bhajis were spicy and tasted nice. The Gulab Jamun was too soft and mouth-watering.

The prices are pretty high, which is another problem with vegetarian food. You just can't equate how much you paid and what you got in return. Value for money is quite dismal.

I frequent this place with my mum(who's vegetarian 4 days a week) after shopping at city centre 2.Inspite of being a committed carnivore I can really go vegetarian if the dishes are done right.Trust haldirams to dish out gorgeous vegetarian fare that'll momentarily make you forget about the existence of butter chicken.We've tried the special thali,chowmien,veg manchurian and chola bhatura on various occasions and they are bang for bucks every single time.We generally end our visit by picking up giant packets of bhujia for home.Give non-vegetarian food a rest and try this place out if you're in the neighbourhood.Pocket pinch is on the lower side.

This is the first Haldirams to open a food court kind of eatery place with a speciality of vegan foods for one and all located 5 mins from the airport and incase if you are coming from ultadanga or rajarhat then its just behind the other foot of the flyover constructed to reach kaikhali bus stop .
A big board which can be seen even from quite a far distance makes it more visible to reach this huge building which looks very smart and eye catching , so now let me describe you the different foods available here starting from the regular sweets ,chocolates , cakes and namkeens all are available here in the same floor right as you enter the building ,so whether you like your favourite gulab jamun or your soan papri or you may like those rasmalis, well all you will get here hot and absolutely made fresh .
This place boosts a huge spread for chocolates also which is mostly imported and even very attractive so this place is always a hit in festivals as well as regular days .Then they have pastries too here which I kind of don't like much however you get a variety here .
And finally talking about the main foods you have to first get your coupons billed then reach the sitting area right inside on the same floor and there is street foods to proper meals ready always here whether you go lunch time or dinner you will get your mini and special veg platter which has a wide selection of side dishes ,rice ,Indian breads and sweets as well and not to forget your mineral water bottle comes along too .
Street foods like papri chaat,samosa,chola batura ,raj kachori ,south Indian foods from idlys to dosa and then beverages like cold coffee ,kesaria lassi and regular ones too is always available here which really is a one stop place for vegan foods and trust me their preparation is yummy and I am saying that being a hardcore non vegatarian .
And finally i would like to mention one important point is that they definetly charge you a little more of money then the regular foods you get but they give you great quality here and quality can't be compromised so this place can be considered for sure .

The mini thali came with pooris, a paneer subzi and a veg dish of your choice. Both subzis were masala-ridden and too spicy. No satisfaction to be had. The chola batura’s chola had a weird taste. The bottled drinks were too thin and too sweet, a disaster. Tis the season so we had the gud sweets. Both the rasmalai and rossogulla were good not great. The whole time we were there, there was another customer trying to talk to the manager about finding a roach in his food :-/ This didn’t color my opinion, I promise :-/

I have to this place a several times and there is so much to eat and take away. It is open full day and since morning you start getting all the good stuff. This is my opinion is the best place to fill yourself before catching a flight at the nearby airport.

The dosa and the chutneys are amazing. The rasmalai was also yum. The puchkas were also good. I did not like the misti doi. Got several sweets packed for my sister too. Simply a place to be if you happen to be at this side of Kolkata.

The only thing which can annoy some is that you have to line up for coupons or the bills. Rest Haldiram's is always known for its food and taste so enjoy and have a good fill.

The food is good and the place is always buzzing with people. However, its grossly overpriced. And the staff are not too well behaved. Still, this is one of the best vegetarian food joints u'll find. Yet I'll say Haldiram's Exide More outlet is way better!

Situated on VIP road, opposite to Newtown connector , this place offers a nice selection for veg snacks items.
I had been here quite a few times and I tried masala dosa, masala butter dosa, Channa bhatura, jalebi, keshar kulfi. Food was good is taste and quatity.
Pleace is quite clean and service is prompt also. The attitude of the person who sits at billing counter is not friendly enough. They should also ease the process of buying sweets or snacks.

The staff are also shouted at, in front of all the customers. The outlet is still surviving only due to the name created by haldirams group. The food items are costly, the sweets are in no way worth the money. You get better sweets in ganguram, kc Das and even roadside sweet shops. Pathetic place ! 
Pros :
1. The brand name built by haldirams , they're feeding on it and eventually ruining it. 
2. A prominent location.
Cons:
1. Overpriced 
2. Nothing exceptional. You get all the items in other smaller shops , which will be tastier n cheaper 
3. Atitude of the managers as if customers are begging for food. We pay for it ! 
4. Shouting, fights and all are a part of the daily routine. Not a place for any person with a basic sense of decency to go, and definitely not families.

Overpriced Shit!

Jalebi - Rs. 50 for 2 pieces of most ordinary jalebi's
Kachori - Rs. 50 for 5 pieces of small kachori's
South Indian dishes - Rs. 80+ for most dishes

Most of the items are highly overpriced and nothing different from other normal shops. So, unless you want to hang out for a couple of hours without going to a proper restaurant, it's not worth it!

Plus they have thousands of counters to collect food...even if the people at the counter make a mistake in serving the right items, the managers would create a ruckus and still make you pay for it.

Not worth it, would never visit this shitty place again.

My favourite place to hangout whenever I need a quick bite. Mostly love their chaat variety, specially impressed with their chaat version of the South Indian dahi vada.
Combo thali here is also good.
Items are a bit on the costly side

Excellent location, spacious sitting area, quick service and a varieties of PURE VEG food items - that's what sums up ur visit at Haldiram's. I am just back from this place and here to write the review. We had ordered for butter masala dosa, mix veg pizza, Rosomalai and Tea. It's a complete "Self service" place where you pay the money at the counter, collect ur coupons and go to the queue for the respective live food counter. All the items were ready by 15 minutes if not more. The crowd consist of mostly non bengalis however, I was surprised to see few bengali people over there too.
The restaurant and the store are side by side and you would just feel like lost in the realm of so many Haldiram's dry ready to eat items. For us, the pure non-veg giants, all we know about this place or company is the "bhujiya" and the "টক ঝাল মিষ্টি চানাচুর". But once you get inside, for a moment you would feel like, " শালা আজ থেকে non-veg খাওয়া ই ছেড়ে দেবো"...as whatever you would see around, you would eventually feel like trying - so many variants in sweets, nimki, bhujia, badi, and what not. Definitely a good place for a change of ur taste buds from kebabs to kaju barfi.@

We went there so many times to take sweets and had some snacks...their sweets are just lazawab...lajeez; I had their motochur laddus, dry fruits kaju barfis and others sweets also which was really delicious...their dhosa and mainly panipuri or fuchka and its 3types of flavoured pani are just awesome...price is bit costly but it worth it...and we worked for their sales application and website also, but the project got stopped...but anyways I can't stop to have their sweets...just yummm & ice cream flavours are also good..

Today I went to Haldiram and choose a item for 5 pcs...Later I realised I need less pcs but the staff denied and forced me to take original 5 pcs as the slip was already generated. He then denied to provide me any other items as I did not take the previous slip...the worst and arrogant staff of Haldiram all over

Today I have been there with a friend. I have visited this place for the very first time and I have very high hopes too. The place is quite well-managed and neat and clean. Too many options are there like various sweets, namkins, nuts, juices, so many of them to choose from. All are looking quite mouth-watering. We have ordered rajkachori, dahi puchka chaat, mango rasgulla, kesar payesh, kesar chumchum, malpua and chena pura. The malpua is too sweet to take; chumchum is quite normal and so is the kesar payesh and rasgulla. But chena pura is just too good. The raj kachori and dahi puchka chaat both are awesome and heavy too. I have taken home the famous kaju barfi and motipak. Both are very tasty. The food is a bit over-priced and also tastes okay, not too good; specially these sweets. Still we will visit this place again to try some more!

This Haldiram food court is quite similar to that of the one in exide xing. The food is all similar to all other haldiram branch. Serves tasty Veggie north Indian fast foods. The best part is however is the ambience, you can sit a long hours and chat and order food occasionally. It's a great hangout place to me. The pastry section is great. Good taste no egg pastries are awesome. 
Raj kachuri  is also a good item to try. And if you are hungry you can try the Chinese Thali.

My friends and I were in the mood of having some veg delicacies and so hopped into this particular haldirams restaurant. We decided to have chole bature nd pao bhaji. The chole bature was tasty..but the bature was extremely oily..health conscious people should stay away from it. The chole though tasty and spicy was too sour for our liking. The pao bhaji was horrible. The bhajji was soo sour that we had to throw it off and instead order another chole bature. Thankfully the Gulab jamun was tasty and even the malpoa...it was big and filling. The kulfi was the stardish. It was awesome. Verdict - Visit the restaurant only for its snacks and sweets.

Good place for breakfast.. Club kachori and Sabzi along with jalebi makes for a perfect star to the day. The quality of sweets served here is not bad. This is a self service restaurant. However, you will not find the staff very courteous. Guess that is coz it is always buzzing with people. Nothing much to talk about as far as the ambience is concerned. It's more of a sweet shop that also serves fast food,etc. Not bad if you do not mind those calories and cholesterol.

Later we washed it out with cans of chilled coke. A refreshing experience in a blazed afternoon.

Being a hardcore non vegeterian I am not quite fond of veg restaurants.. but HALDIRAMS is an exception.. specifically kaikhali haldirams!! And one reason for my love for this place is its just beside my house and I've seen the restaurant getting constructed and then becoming popular in no time.. well I love each and every dish they serve.. starting from jalebis, sweets, chaats, chana batora, dosa, meals.. everything.. my personal favourites include the masala dosa(I haven't found such good taste of the masala in the dosa anywhere else in the city), the kesar kulfi and the mega sized gulab Jamun.. and I never forget to buy a pack of kesar laddoos on my every alternate visit almost! I like their idea for self servicing.. quite systematic.. though I'm a little worried about their recent rates of price hikes but still I can say this place is just perfect for any occasion with anyone at any time.. be it breakfast or lunch or snacks or dinner!

I relish almost every non veg item served by them (except pani puri and pao vaji,I have had better).I love d entire variety of chats ( specially raj kachouri chat and papri chat) they offer.their chana batora is a dish to die for. Love their thalis as well.and abt d sweet: its like a symphony of Beethoven.they serve d best kesar kulfi and sitafal kulfi I hv ever tested and their kesar jalebis r simply d best. In short spacious place to hv ur breakfast/evening snancks( lunch /dinner) with family/frnds/loved ones.

Think of a dependable restaurant serving delicious Indian snacks and sweets made with quality ingredients, and Haldiram's  comes to the mind. Be it the Chhole
Bhature, Pao Bhaji, Club Kachori Subzi, or Chholar Dal-Luchi, Dhokla, Khandvi, dosas, idlis, or snacks like chaats, Batata Puri, Dahi Vada or Dahi Phuchka, you will get it
all under one roof. Add to these, thalis and desserts (Malpua, Kesariya Jalebi, Gulab Jamun, Badam Burfis,Sohan Papdi, etc.), there is something for everyone!
Each and every dish is hygienically prepared and well-presented, and you will not go wrong with any selection that you make. ☺

Decent food but a bit unfriendly system of service. You need place order at the shop adjoining the restaurant where you will not have much idea of the dish's appearance. Some dishes dont measure up in quality/ taste especially the items in the thali. They have a typical taste of items made in large batches and hence all gravies taste the same. They need to up the quality and also devise a better system of service

Food gives us ultimate relief. When it comes to Haldiram's just one word left ......awsum. In this mid summer when you are frustrated to cope up with the heat just come here and have a Kesar kulfi which I am tasting right now, that will give you ultimate satisfaction. I hate sweet all kind of sweet dishes and being a north Indian I am totally in love with butter chicken. But today for a change I tried haldiram's for the first time and as a result it blew my head off. When you think there is no person left to give u company just come here, like I did today after being betrayed by my best friend. 
   But loneliness got over with kaju pista roll, kesar kulfi, butter paneer roll and Manchurian. These are the special items you should try.....
Ambience was medium and service was awesome. And at last this restaurant will never let u down if u bring your date here.....he he

This is a great food joint near our college. All the dishes are purely vegetarian though, still they are delicious. The delicacies of sweets are huge and the aroma too. I'm a regular customer at this place. In fact this is the best haldirams to me. Some of the best dishes are Chola Batura, Thali that contains 2 kulcha/nun, rice, 3 vegetables or dal, one Gulab jamun, pickle, salad and water, dhokla, samosa and jalebi. Also among South Indian foods dosa and idli vada are nice. They also have huge assortments of bhujia in the front. In short, a great place.

This place makes me nostalgic. During 2000 to 2003, I have been a frequent visitor to this place, rather a daily visitor almost. Beyond 2003 also, I have visited this place several times. This place definitely offers one of the best Indian vegetarian dining and snacks experiences in the city. This place used to be centrally AC and the interior is literally as gorgeous as palace. Uncountable numbers of snacks, bhujias, sift drinks and sweets are displayed all around and you are free to take up as many as you wish. Dine in facility is quite good. Though last few times I saw one of the two wings of the building has been turned into a storeroom and probably the AC was not working. But that is not enough underrate this extraordinary place. Each and every item they offer are tasty and of fine quality with very reasonable price and quantity. Would like to specify some of my favourites here.
Dahi samosa
Aloo bonda
Dahi phuchka
Plain phuchka
Flavoured Milk shake and lassi
Dosa
Veg noodles
Paan

Unforgettable experiences. Would like to keep on visiting.

Planning to go for a meal and you prefer veg..then Haldiram's is a must among the list. We had two full thali. They asked to take choice of your vegetables. We choose all pander dishes. Among them I had a very gud taste with pander butter masala
 But rest dishes were not up to the mark. But if you interested for..."bhar pet" veg khanna ...then you can taste once. We also took rasmalai  and it was OK. They provide a water bottle too with the thali which is good.  The experience was satisfactory with ambience and food but not great.

A great hangout place and no doubt one of the best places to have a veg snack fest. The food they serve is hot and fresh. The choices they offer are a bit limited but is of good quality. Their hot jamuns are impeccable. A nice snack would be a nan along with a paneer dish. Nevertheless they could improve on their service and the lightning which is a big dampner for the place.

Whenever we visit kolkata, we never fail to visir this place. Located close to the airport, this outlet of Haldiram's is so big. The interiors are superb..so spacious and big enough. Good seating arrangement. There are so many varieties of sweets, bhujia,snacks, chanachurs that I always get confused what to buy and what not to. Every sweet and snack looks so tempting. We tried their dosas,chole battura..they are great. Also had their hot gulab jamun and my favourite misti doi and I liked both the items so much. We packed for our home different varieties of sweets like mango kaju barfi, moti chur ka ladoo, shondesh and I must say each and every sweet is just great..they are so tasty.
For this reason I love kolkata and love haldirams for their sweets :)

visited haldirams a few many times but havent really ate as much to give a review of it 

going into haldirams the drive way which is also the entrance of the haldirams getting in you would see a huge space where snacks are kept through out the whole space there is sweet section available just straight ahead and snacks corner at left and open air restaurant with open air kitchen just good placefor little cozy time spending.....


food-well apart from chola bhatura and samosa(available just in morning period) much of the my food tasting done here apart from snacks like mini samosa and nimkis  they quite good snacks  and do not forget to try their hot gulab jamun after stomach ful meal 

P.s-hoping to get a hand on that mini thali here some day

I don't know why lot of people visit this place. I am not sure what they like about this place. Haldiram started its business by selling bhujia and then grew from strength to strength. They probably has the biggest varieties of snacks. Don't trust their packaged food. At times they sell stale items. Their sweets are nothing special. And the vegetarian food quality that they serve is also not good. Not recommended if you are looking for quality vegetarian food.

I have stopped counting how many times I have been to this place since school days. Back then this was the most apt place to sit and chat and have some really nice Indian food with our little pocket money. This place is lovely, you will always find a place to sit even at the busiest days and hours. The service is quick and sweet options are awesome. I have ried almost all of the dishes in the menu, Chinese, South Indian, Chaats, Thaalis, Breakfast, Sweets and all other Desserts, Cold beverages etc. Coming to them one by one:Chinese: I love the noodles, although I am not quite fond of the veg manchurian, I think you can finish your noodles without any side dish.South Indain: Please go for the cheese dosa. It is quite good and I love the sambar and chatni too.Chaats: These are the best here like all other Haldirams. In a bad mood, these are going to lift you up. rajkachori is amongst my most favourite. Dahi vada is also great, its soft and most importantly the Dahi is super fresh and tasty. Paanipuri/ Phuchka is served with 2 types of tamarind water, one sweet and one sour, looks really hygienic and is a must try.Thaalis: When your are up for a heavy meal (dinner/lunch) just go for this option. They have plenty of choices for Sabzis and all of them are super good in taste. And the meal would be wholesome.Breakfast: Club kachori is the best option, coming second in my favourite's list. And be a little early for these, becuase they sell like hot cakes over here. Don't be surprised if you have to stand on a huge queue to get one plate. Don't forget to conclude your breakfast with their Hot Jalebis. ;)Desserts: Go for the Kulfi, Jalebi, Firni, or Moong Halwas. Kulfi and Firni are my favourites though, because they have a pleasing sweetness.Sweets: You have multiple options, sweets from every part of India is available. You are going to fall in love with the decor of each one of them. Amongst my favourite are, Rashmalai, Firni, Gulab jamun, Halwas. Malpua etc. Although I have not been able to taste them all, but someday I will.Cold beverage: Lassi is must try. As I have already mentioned, the Dahi is fresh and thick and perfectly sweetened, after a glass, you can feel so full that you might not feel like having anything else. Another one which was once my favourite is the badam milk, but I really feel the quality of badam milk have detoriorated a lot over time.  This was and always would be one of my favourite place for hanging out with local buddies and culturing over each one their item, everytime !

This outlet is very close to where I used to go for tutions that too in the morning around 7 am. I often used to have my breakfast here on the way back.

I have had both South Indian and North Indian food here and they were good but a little overpriced. PLAIN DOSA and CHOLE BHATURA were among the regulars. I have also tried the DAHI VADA but I don't actually remember which one Rajasthani or Madrasi.

Sweets are awesome. KAJU BARFI is one of my favourite sweets and you can blame Haldirams for that. KESAR PISTA KULFI is also fair.

Living up to its reputation, this outlet will never disappoint anyone, I wager. Owing to its close proximity to the NSCBI Airport, Calcutta, whether you are too early to the airport or simply wish to take some souvenir from Haldiram's alongwith you, you simply cannot ignore this place. With a spacious seating area and a self-help system (which is, of course, a wont in every outlet), what adds a feather to the cap of this particular Haldiram's food joint is that, the prices are never too heavy on your wallet. The rosgollas are served straight from the concoction-vessels, and they might burn your tongue if you show a bit of laxity on your part. The staffs always have a smile painted on their face, and they never show any sign of impatience or irateness if you're undecided over which one to choose and which one to leave.
The Thali is simply innovative; it allows one to savour a small bit of almost everything available on their à-la-carte menu. It comes with rice, three different types of sabzi-ki-tarkaari of your choice, two pieces of chapati, papad, pickle, salad and mineral water. 
Although never tried the tinned products, but I wish that day is not far away.

The quality of food right from the sweets at the main encounter to the snacks  offered at the adjoining restaurant is absolutely deplorable. It is quiet spectacular to see such a quick decline of this once decent eatery.

The staff behavior is poor and the items even poorer in taste. Strictly avoidable.

Quite a huge menu, reasonable pricing, comfortable inside to grab a quick meal but the ultimate benchmark for a restaurant has to be its food and that been an issue with this outlet with the food quality on a decline over the years.

The place is huge with a decent sitting area. The service is fast but quality depends on whose catering to you. The prices are fairly reasonable with decent serving sizes. The place is well lit and clean. The food is pretty hygienic but taste is average now which used to be great earlier.

The chaats are average with chola bhatura, paw bhaji being the better of the lot. The north indian thali is huge and over sufficient for a person. I used to be a lover of it but nowadays feel it is not that consistent in respect of quality. The smaosas etc are decent. Chinese food is horrible and i just dont like it here. The mixtures and other packaged fried items are ok and i do not like haldirams for their sweets.

Overall limited options in the vicinity is only reason for me turning up at this place once in a while.

A 4.0 because ages back when sweet plazas were not prevalant, this shop filled the void. Very good food and great sweets. Haldiram is known for its sweets and along with it its raj kachoris, dahi phuchkas with sweet/sour chatnis, bata puris, etc. I am not a fan of marwari kachuri aloo dum being a hardcore radha bollobi lover but I believe that other things are a msut here, especially motichoor ke laddoo and moti pak sandesh. If you like gulam jamuns then also this is your place. The tinned products of this place aer also quite nice.

Cons: If you're tryin' to give your taste bud a different feelin' each timd, don't be a regular there! Lacks variety.
Don't leave the place without: Havin' sweets as desserts!

Situated 2 stops before Kolkata Airport if you are travelling from Ultadanga is Haldiram's. The bus stop is itself named Haldiram after the name of this shop and restaurant. 

Most of us are quite acquainted with the common sweets available here but the VIP Haldiram is fairly a large place and it will take you quite sometime to go through their huge array of sweets, snacks, chocolates and sherbets. I have seen pretty much several variety of sweets here from dry ones to the ones dipped in sugar syrup to the Haldiram special ghee sweets. Every variety that I have tried here was simply superb. They also have a dry fruits in different variety like fried, salted etc. 

Attached with the shop is the Haldiram's Restaurant. One can sit and dine here. It is a pure veg restaurant but the menu has a lot if variety. You get North Indian, South Indian, Noodles, Pizza and even Fuchka and Kulfi here. All in all a great place for vegetarians. But non-vegetarians like me can equally enjoy too. 

If you have a sweet tooth then this place is for sure going to delight you. The vegetarian foods in the restaurant are tasty as well. And with our so many occasions round the year demanding purchase of sweets, Haldiram's wide variety of sweets can be one of the best option.

This huge Haldiram has been here forever but I haven't had the chance to visit here untill today. I went here today evening as I wanted to try something vegetarian and different with a friend. Inside is a huge world of Haldiram sweets and snacks. With stocks of bhujia, papad, chanachur, chips and all kinds of mithai. And on the left is the restaurant, one has to first buy coupons from the counter outside and then hand over the slips at their respective counters. 
We chose to have a lot food like a plain dosa, two paw bhajis, fountain coke and special mention to straw berry rasogolla, mango rosogolla and ras malai. All this costed us Rs.330, which is reasonable. The paw bhaji was the best, the only place where I loved the paw more than the bhaji. Rest were all usual. The ras malai is a must try loved it. And the flavored rasogolla were so nice and out of the box. I didnt get the mango taste in the mango flavored one but the strawberry looked and tasted enticing. 
This is a self service restaurant so nothing about the service quality. But ofcourse the difficulty is the waiting time and how one has to keep going back to the counter to be served and it can take quite some time for a few dishes. All in an ok ok experience. Good place for friends and adda. Happy eating!

Haldirams is by far the best vegetarian joint in town. Food is always fresh & warm I just love the mushroom pizza they serve and the lassi. Though pav bhaji is also high on list. Everything is great except the water and service. They provide normal tap water which I find extremely unhealthy. Otherwise good place and value for money is also fine.

This is by far the best vegetarian eatery in Kolkata... the food is just fantastic... specially Dahi Vada and Papri Chat... somehow dont like their Samosas...therefore simply hate mixed chat and samosa chat.. but again that's a personal choice. Love their kachuris... dhoklas... malpuas ( made of kheer and too heavy to consume).. the hot hot gulab jamun is just heavenly... dont like their rasogollas...I mean its a Bengali specialty after all... but never ever try their Firnis, its horrendous... yukky. Must ry their laddus.. specially the Besan Laddu with dry frits ... yum yum :P. I just dont like their jalebis its too thin for Bangali taste buds.

Used to love their thalis../ but somehow the quality has been deteriorated drastically. I dont like to eat there... the ambiance is too noisy... one more ting dont expect politeness from their staff...

Super cool chat and South Indian food. Being from TN, I am very picky on sambar. But believe me, these guys bowled me over with their idli, chutney and sambar right away. Same goes with the chat that my family was willing to walk for 20 minutes for each meal. 

On the downside they could do far better on dosa. But don't miss this If you visit Kolkata.

Haldiram's is a big franchise in india. It has 2 branches. One at VIP road near to domestic/international airport and one at Chowringhee.
The former one is also the factory where the food is manufactured.
Here are the star points.
1. Unbelievably wide selection of Indian sweets majorly of the north indian style.
2. A great place for vegetarian food including dosas, chats, juices, lassi etc.
3. Their bhujiya (spicy shredded potato fried) is world famous. This is where it is made. Have it or take a pick from various type of packs. Same goes for various types of snack.


Price is economical. Quality is simply world class. Its challenging to find something in this store that you will not like.

Been here Haldiram's innumerable times... 
This has been my favorite veg eatery for a long time.
.A very good place for every age level if you like veg dishes.
I love coming here again and again for their authentic taste in some of their dishes and sweets!
Today I visited Haldiram’s again with the similar eagerness with my family!
The Ambiance is quite the same and too good.
The rates of the dishes are reasonable as well.
Today we ordered a Mini Thali [consisting of 4 puris/1 chaptis, 2 sabzi, pickle and mineral water], a Masala Dosa and 2 nuns and 1 paneer butter masala.
We took the 4 puris and in the sabzi option we took Chole  and a Chilli Paneer.
They are actually the king of making dosas... It’s excellent!
Chili Paneer and Chole  were good as well!
But Paneer Butter Masala was a big letdown for us. Shouldn’t have taken that one... 
But overall it was quite good.We took some sweets [Gulab Jamun] as takeaway. 
It was quite excellent!
I recommend all the vegetarians to Haldiram’s.. it's awesome!

------------------ Edit 06.03.2015 ------------------
I visited Haldirams uncountable times so I decided to do a short review of all the menus I tasted here.
1. Dosas - All dosas are awesome. Haldirams is the king of Dosa making. My favourite one is the Masala Dosa.
2. Puri - Good.
3. Chole - Pretty good.
4. Chilli Paneer - Yummy! Must try
5. Paneer Butter Masala - Big letdown. Don't try it!
6. Gulab Jamun - "Gulab Jamun ho toh Haldirams ka ho, warna na ho"!
7. Paneer Chowmein - I don't know why but I love their chowmein very much especially the paneer chowmein. It's super tasty.
8. Hot Chocolate - Ok! Not good! Not bad!
9. Kulfi - Quite nice.

What started off as a promise to many of us about more than a decade ago has now failed to live up to the expectation!
Those were the days when it was a name on everyone's lips and in fact people from all around would drop by to dig into an array of mouth-watering chats &  Gol-Guppas ,  while shopping for sweets and savouries, enroute to the Airport or the way home !It was a hot favourite destination for tit-bits like Khasta Kachories, Samosa & Dahi Vada as well as Pizzas , Dosa or Utthapam! I must say that on week-end mornings , the garam club kachories with aloo ki sabji & Jalebis  is still  a big hit. The people still flock here for their favourite sweets which no doubt has a wide range  both in terms of quantity & price! What has actually gone negative is their upkeep & hygiene & is quite apparent as soon as you walk up the pathway to the main entrance with a foul smell emanating from the base of the building!Also the prices have shot up in addition to the reduction in the portions which used to be served earlier!
Hope Sri Prabhuji notices whatever I have written & addresses the  problem areas!

Since this place is located just adjacent to my aunt's place, I've been here a hundred times or more. A good place because of the quality of the food they serve, from the Chhola Bhatura and Dosa to Chowmein and Manchurian or the amazing varieties of sweets and also the other confectionery. The staff are mostly polite and behave well. I'm an obligatory non-vegetarian but I always love the Pav Bhajis and the Chhola Bhaturas. ALWAYS

I've been here a number of times now. Great veg food if that's what you're looking for. The huge layout of the place, offering everything vegetarian, from chaats to kachouris to even dosas and chowmein, this is a pretty sweet spot for one of those days you "should not eat non veg" for a puja or anything like that. 
Being haldiram's, there are, obviously an endless array of sweets to choose from (their kumra petha is a guilty pleasure of mine).
The restaurant space is large too. However, the only thing which I wish to see an improvement in is the attitude of the counter personnel. I've had a guy even filling me a cup of milk shake without asking what flavor I'd take, so I hope that changes in the future. Other than that, a great place to try out.

Oh its my favorite when it comes to gorging dosas, chaats and mithais. I love the hot gulab jamuns and the cheese masala dosa. Infact i love the entire menu, the staff is super good and pleasant the chaats are to die for. Being a vegetarian restaurant does not make any difference in their chinese thali too, not only is it too filling but also yummy. The place is clean and hygiene is well maintained. It is alos not overtly expensive which means you can go there anytime and enjoy a soulful food.

The chinese thali comprises of noodles, fried rice, chilli potato, veg munchurian and a very good salad. And yes, the chocopudding is a must try over here.
