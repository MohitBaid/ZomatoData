Good food. Decent mocktails.
We had ordered risotto pomodoro, crave special pizza, manchow soup, zuppa di broccolo, nachos, American corn salt and pepper and shawarma wrap. All items were delicious. Overall, the food was satisfactory and the per head cost was not pocket pinching.

The food was good, the ambience was great just the fact that, many of the dishes weren't ready to be served..like pizzas, which we would like to have often.. wasn't available, platter, and the menu is too complicated to spell...!! Would recommend to simplify the menu and/or names of the dishes..!!
The sitting arrangement was great, they also offer a private dining area of 10 as well..! 
All said, the food tasted good and the service was satisfactory. 
Just try not to charge/add service charge@10% of the gross amount.
By the way, your system too needs to get updated as one cannot offer anything above MRP. The packaged water that you charged us for is priced at 20/- (MRP) yet you charged us ‚Çπ50/- which is unlawful. Do take care of small things and get the system updated. 
Else everything was ok.

For starters we ordered wontons and crispy konjee vegetables. Both delicious.Then a shawarma wrap, crave special ravioli(best dish) and quesadilla; ended it with a tiramisu. Money spent worthwhile.

The food was below average. I visited a few weeks ago after hearing rave reviews, but the food that I ordered was average. I liked the interiors and the staff was polite, but I'm going for the food, and what I ate wasn't worth it. Maybe I'll try their other food some day.

Located in one of the most calmest area of Kolkata by the Lakes this is a must visit place .
The ambiance is just perfect for dining with your family and friends . The service is a bit slow but it's worth the wait.
Coming to he food 
For starters i had crisy chilly honey and Basil babycorn , cheese garlic bread which was made way it should be . Perfect .
For main course i ordered a spaghetti Napolitano 
And spinach feta ravioli (heaven ;-)) 
Wo dessert i had ordered sizzling chocolate brownie and it's sizzle itself will tell you how tasty it's going to be 
Pocket pinch - on the expensive side .

This is where I found that veg pizza and veg pasta can also satisfy your taste buds. Mind it, this a vegetarian restaurant. The pizza and pasta that we ordered for tasted excellent. First of all, we we're hungry like beasts and secondly, there were long queues at other food joints. But I don't think these are the reasons behind my liking of the veg dishes. I liked them because the mushrooms substituted the chicken successfully and the cheese was in perfect quality and quantity. Give it a try, if you are bored of meat (only if..)
Another aspect I must point out. When the bill came to our table, my husband verified and noticed that they had added service charge of 100 re extra. We asked them and they said "yeah, we usually get it, never mind, we are discarding this". We didn't allow them to change the bill and paid the service charge but this is a fault that we knowingly indulged. Be careful while paying the bill. (My visit was during the puja days, that may be a reason of this).
Thank you!

After hearing so much good stuff about this place we finally decided to land here on a Sunday night. Was not that much crowded and got seated in 10-15 mins. Ambience is quite ordinary. We decided to start with their minestrone and tomato basil soup both were okayish with nothing much special. Started options are quite less that‚Äôs why we decided to go with cheese fondue and wantons. Cheese melt was a little too thin but tasted really good. Wantons were not that great at all. Foreign course we ordered asparagus risotto, Mexican ragout and coriander rice, some veg Hakka noodles and crave‚Äôs special pizza. The Mexican rice dish along with that tomato based ragout gets a special mention. Was one of the best dishes of the evening. Pizza was good too. Risotto was quite poorly cooked and veg Hakka noodles were perfect to accompany. I didn‚Äôt have much expectation for their desserts but we still decided to order tiramisu and it turned out to be horrible. How can someone call this a Tiramisu. A big No No !! Portions are good for the price. Service is sloppy. Workers are not well trained. To summarise 3/5 Only for few good dishes. 0/5 for ambience and 3/5 for service.

It‚Äôs really disappointing to write this review here for a place where I would love to go and eat in the past. I visited the place on the 4th of November expecting the usual comfort food. And ordered my favourite Suppli Alla Romana without even looking at the menu. Service was pretty quick as expected since they had to cater to the customers waiting outside too. The dish didn‚Äôt look the way it used to previously. Nonetheless I ignored it hoping the Taste would be great only to be disappointed in the first bite. The outer layering of the little fried balls were thick and raw. The sauce on top was pretty dry. And the salad they used to serve was replaced by some cabbage and mayo. I called for the waiter and asked him to get it checked as this was not the dish I so fondly always had there. The waiter was back in a jiffy and said ‚Äúthe chef claims the dish is fine and nothing can be done about it‚Äù. I still did not react and asked him to cancel the same since it was really not edible at all. 
Next up we ordered the mezze platter and were created by a pretty decently sized pebble-like stone in the hummus which almost broke my mother‚Äôs teeth (picture attached below). On questioning the captain tells me it might have come in the chick pea we can‚Äôt really do much about it. I was still patient enough, took out the stone and we ate the rest of the food as I personally don‚Äôt believe in causing a commotion at a diner. We ordered a pizza which was fine and called for our bill. 
I was surprised to see they had charged me for those raw cutlets which I had returned, on purpose or by mistake I don‚Äôt want to know. I asked them to remove that from my bill and paid for the rest of the bill. I enquired about the owners presence at the restaurant and was told that he is barely there anymore. Is that why the quality of food has gone bad. Not going back here for sure unless I have a change of heart with time. What disappointed me the most was the attitude of the staff who showed no regret at all and were neither apologetic about the entire food experience. Please pull up your socks guys.

Revised my rating from 5 to 3.5. The service has really deteriorated over the the past few months. Reservation time is never adhered to by the restuarant - usual wait time on weekends is 20 mins even if you reach on time for reservation. Food service has become slow and staff seems to have lost courtesy. 
Used to be my favourite dinner place but needs improvement now.

Hi..
I have visited this place around 2 to 3 times.. everything served is really good but i have just one complaint they should really reduce the service charge.. 10% service charge is way too much... last time we were 3 in a grounp and i had to pay around 300 as service charge taxes extra..
i know it is optional but everytime asking to remove also doesnt sound ethical..
i hope the management takes this into consideration.

Decent interior and good food- that is what we can tag to this restaurant. Located in Southern Avenue, a few metres from Golpark, this is quite an urban dine-out. We came here to try out their Thai menu as I was "crave"-ing for some good Thai food. We started out with a chilled glass of Virgin Mojito which was decent. Since I wanted something cheesey, we ordered a plate of Jalapeno Cheese Poppers. Filled with mildly-spiced cheese filling and topped with sour cream sauce and tangy ketchup, this was a good appetizer. Next came in my boyfriend's favorite Khow Suey which was creamy and delicious, served with the various accompaniments like crispy noodles, coriander, cucumber juliennes, crispy Fried onions, etc. I found the coconut flavour too strong for my taste. My favorite was the Thai Green Curry which was served with Lemon flavored rice. The curry had a good undertone of lemon which I liked the most, although the quantity of curry was somewhat inadequate for the amount of rice served with it. We were so full that we couldn't finish off the entire rice. An overall good place. Would come again for the other cuisines.

Ambience- 3.8/5
Staff- 4/5
Food- 3.9/5

Conveniently located in southern Avenue, 10 mins away from Lake Mall. Nicely done interiors, though not very striking. Comfortable seating options available including the ones with the lovely view of the road and passersby. This is one of the best vegetarian restaurants in the city offering a wide variety in their menu. We liked most their Baba Ghanoush as well as the Cheese cake. üòç

One thing which troubled us all throughout was the constant loud chattering of a group of ladies. On several requests to the staff there, one of them finally went to talk to the ladies about it. But the result wasn't what is expected. The ladies continued their thing all the while, thus disturbing the others in the restaurant. 

Overall an ok experience. Worth paying a visit once.

This restaurant is the üëå (Best) Pure Vegetarian restaurant in Kolkata. This is a multi cuisine restaurant with ultimate seating comfort and you can also book table ahead on call or on Zomato. We ate lunch and were lucky that we booked table bcoz all were booked.

In starters we ordered Munchow Soup which has an ultimate taste, Cheese Pondue, Nachos which were also awesome. Cheese Garlic bread was also crisp and awesome. Hakka noodles were good but one platter called as Mezze Platter was pathetic however some alloo type thing was good.

I had planned to go to a different restaurant, but could not find place there. This restaurant is next door and I am a vegetarian, so I just walked in. The restaurant is not a large one and I was given a corner (as I was alone!). The arrangement of tables is a little awkward and congested. For instance, there were three two-seater tables pushed into a small niche near the kitchen. The staff is courteous, but not exactly friendly or forthcoming. I waited quite a while before my order was taken.

I ordered Falafel pockets and a sweet lime soda. The Falafel pockets tasted good, except that they seemed a little hard. It is strange that they do not have a mocktail section on their menu and there is hardly anything one can order to drink along with the food.

I would say an average experience.

Conveniently located in southern avenue. Nice cozy place. Good food. Serving staff ratio on a sunday would be 2 people for 3 tables which is quite good.

Every table has a neatly placed mineral water bottle, looks complimentary but is chargeable. On asking the manager updated us that 1% of customer ask for regular water rest our customers dont care for such petty amount. Hence they dont bother to ask the preference of water just add to the bill. Even the best of 5 star hotels ask their customer - but i guess the manager here has far superior standards.

Had the manager not shown his attitude would have given a better rating cause the food was good.

Went to crave today with a lot of expectations but all shattered. Called for crispy babycorn which was below average, the vegetables in the Mexican Ragout were stale and it did not taste at all like before. The pasta and the risotto were fine. I would say that the kind and quality of food they used to serve has deteriorated.

Crave foodworks, located in the serene neighbourhood of Southern Avenue is a place that should feature on every vegetarians wish list in the City of Joy. Space being a constraint, the interiors manage to make this joint feel like cozy and homely with the correct blend of furniture used and perfectly regulated lighting.

Coming to the food, the best part about Crave is the freshness of the ingredients that they use. One can easily make out the difference that this brings to the taste. On this particular occasion, the food I ordered:

Chocolate milkshake with ice-cream - Decent to taste, and a good accompaniment with the food in store. Nothing to write home about though.

Nachos - The tortilla chips were plated in a unique manner with a bed of kidney beans and babycorn, served along with the typical cheese sauce and salsa dip. The presentation and taste, both were quite delectable and did it's work of fueling our hunger further.

Crispy Honey Basil Babycorn - One of my favourite dishes at Crave. The babycorn tossed in honey and chilli sauce blend the sweet and sour flavour leaving a lovely honey aftertaste. The sesame seeds add texture and a little zing to the overall flavour

Pesto Magic (Pizza with pesto sauce) - An acquired taste for many Indians, the pesto-sauce pizza topped with generous amounts of exotic veggies and mozzarella & cheddar is a must try for someone looking for something out of the traditional pizza affair.

Quattro Formaggi (aka Four-Cheese Pizza) - One can't go wrong with the cheesy gooey awesomeness of the Quattro Formaggi and that holds true here too. My only gripe is that the base cheese was a little too rubbery to chew.

Darsaan with Ice-Cream - For the perennially sweet-toothed, ending the meal with this saccharine infused Asian delicacy is all that the "Kuch meetha ho jaaye" public could ask for, and then some more.

In conclusion, I would say that I hold Crave Foodworks in high regard majorly for the refreshing taste of the ingredients and a well thought out menu.

The best vegetarian place in Southern Avenue Area. It is situated just opposite to Nazrul Mancha near Golpark. It is big pinch in the pocket place but the food is completely worth it. The quality, look and the quantity of the food really makes you feel satisfied.¬†
The place is a right in the main road and has enough capacity which also has a nice private like table for 5-8 people.¬†
We started with Falafel Pockets and it was wondrous. The fillings was overflowing and had the right amount of ingredients. It had exotic vegetables to make it all the more delicious. The Spring Rolls were crunchy and good noodles in it. We heard Papaya Salad is famous here but we weren't in the mood of having a salad at that time (Something left for next time). We tried Chinese there. The Chilli Garlic Noodles were tasty but the Vegetables in Hot Garlic Sauce made the Noodles more palatable. To give our meal a sweet finish, we ordered Darsaan with vanilla ice cream and it was worth ordering.
Its ¬†a nice joint and I would definitely recommend this place to all food lovers. For Vegetarians it's the best place to go.

This place was on my bucket list for a long time. Rarely do you find a pure vegetarian restaurant which give you fine dining experience but crave is one of the few restaurant.  Place was jam packed with people. Elegant ambience. We place an order of zuppa Di broccolo in soup, which was served by soup bread and stick, papaya salad, falafel pocket, Penne Arrabiata, Crave special burger served with French fries.
Everything else though was pitch pocket.

Went to crave today with a lot of expectations but all shattered. Called for crispy babycorn which was below average, the vegetables in the Mexican Ragout were stale and it did not taste at all like before. The pasta and the risotto were fine. I would say that the kind and quality of food they used to serve has deteriorated.

Crave foodworks, located in the serene neighbourhood of Southern Avenue is a place that should feature on every vegetarians wish list in the City of Joy. Space being a constraint, the interiors manage to make this joint feel like cozy and homely with the correct blend of furniture used and perfectly regulated lighting.

Coming to the food, the best part about Crave is the freshness of the ingredients that they use. One can easily make out the difference that this brings to the taste. On this particular occasion, the food I ordered:

Chocolate milkshake with ice-cream - Decent to taste, and a good accompaniment with the food in store. Nothing to write home about though.

Nachos - The tortilla chips were plated in a unique manner with a bed of kidney beans and babycorn, served along with the typical cheese sauce and salsa dip. The presentation and taste, both were quite delectable and did it's work of fueling our hunger further.

Crispy Honey Basil Babycorn - One of my favourite dishes at Crave. The babycorn tossed in honey and chilli sauce blend the sweet and sour flavour leaving a lovely honey aftertaste. The sesame seeds add texture and a little zing to the overall flavour

Pesto Magic (Pizza with pesto sauce) - An acquired taste for many Indians, the pesto-sauce pizza topped with generous amounts of exotic veggies and mozzarella & cheddar is a must try for someone looking for something out of the traditional pizza affair.

Quattro Formaggi (aka Four-Cheese Pizza) - One can't go wrong with the cheesy gooey awesomeness of the Quattro Formaggi and that holds true here too. My only gripe is that the base cheese was a little too rubbery to chew.

Darsaan with Ice-Cream - For the perennially sweet-toothed, ending the meal with this saccharine infused Asian delicacy is all that the "Kuch meetha ho jaaye" public could ask for, and then some more.

In conclusion, I would say that I hold Crave Foodworks in high regard majorly for the refreshing taste of the ingredients and a well thought out menu.

The best vegetarian place in Southern Avenue Area. It is situated just opposite to Nazrul Mancha near Golpark. It is big pinch in the pocket place but the food is completely worth it. The quality, look and the quantity of the food really makes you feel satisfied.¬†
The place is a right in the main road and has enough capacity which also has a nice private like table for 5-8 people.¬†
We started with Falafel Pockets and it was wondrous. The fillings was overflowing and had the right amount of ingredients. It had exotic vegetables to make it all the more delicious. The Spring Rolls were crunchy and good noodles in it. We heard Papaya Salad is famous here but we weren't in the mood of having a salad at that time (Something left for next time). We tried Chinese there. The Chilli Garlic Noodles were tasty but the Vegetables in Hot Garlic Sauce made the Noodles more palatable. To give our meal a sweet finish, we ordered Darsaan with vanilla ice cream and it was worth ordering.
Its ¬†a nice joint and I would definitely recommend this place to all food lovers. For Vegetarians it's the best place to go.

This place was on my bucket list for a long time. Rarely do you find a pure vegetarian restaurant which give you fine dining experience but crave is one of the few restaurant.  Place was jam packed with people. Elegant ambience. We place an order of zuppa Di broccolo in soup, which was served by soup bread and stick, papaya salad, falafel pocket, Penne Arrabiata, Crave special burger served with French fries.
Everything else though was pitch pocket.

We ordered a medditerran platter and two drinks. The dips they served is to die for. The food was not only filling but also very healthy and light.
The restaurant manager was courteous enough to attend every walk in personally.

Many visits here, each time perfect. We luckily sit on the outer facing area and is awesome in the winters with family.

Today:-
Looked after by Nurul Hasan and Sishir.  As always, they have been polite and nice and portray warmth, THE MAIN INGRIDIENT WE LOOK FOR IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY. We are made to feel welcome, so we come!

Food:-
Always great, and today also AWESUM.

Today we had:
Falafel -- chick pea patty is crunchy, which adds to the awsumness. 
Margherita Pizza -- thin fresh with fresh tomato chunks.
Risotto --- proper consistency and salt.
Penny Pasta in White
American Corn with Salt Pepper
Cappuccinos 
Other drinks

SWEET TOOTH -- DARSAN.  

Few things they could serve without onion and garlic too, which helped one family member enjoy.

Keep it up, stay as you are.

Thanks.

Food is amazing which includes range and even quality . Mexican , Chinese , lebanese , thai , italian and what not .. tried  mushroom soup , pocket falafel, papaya salad , mushroom risoto and some pizza . Couldnt find any issue in any of the dish except slight issue in mushroom soup . No doubt service needs to improve and place need good manager was surprised when the attendant informed of no mineral water and even after an hour the guy didnt had sense to move out and buy even after asking many a times . When u charge 300-400 for a dish this kind of stuffs are not expected could have given 5/5 but was disappointed with this alot .

Saturday lunch. Nice experience seeing the place jam packed with people.

Started with falafel pocket, khowsuey, papaya salad and montecarlo. All the stuff were fresh. The papaya salad was delicious, haven't tried such in any other restaurant. The falafel pocket were light and fresh, the khowsuey  and montecarlo  was also great. The papaya salad had a correct balance of spicyness, sweetness and tanginess. 

A must try place for all those foodies who loves vegetarian food.

The first thing that strikes you is the warm and elegant ambience. And then you lay your eyes on the dreamy Italian menu. ¬†The cream of broccoli soup was hands down one of the best I've had, and I mean in soups, not in broccoli soups. It was chock-full of the creamy broccoli flavor. The mezze platter was ambitious in size and I loved all the components, salad included! Judge the mezze by the hummus, it passed with flying colors. The penne arabiatta was simple wholesome fare as it should be. So far, a standout meal. The grand truffle that we ended with was the only sore thumb. It was dense due to being straight out of the fridge and tasted like a block of chocolate ice. Definitely needs to be reworked. Everything else though, was pitch perfect.

Amidst so many new cafes in town it's a breath of fresh air. Cafe timing as per zomato is 12 noon but it actually opens around 2. We started with manchow soup which had a perfect taste, than we hopped to quesadillas and falafel, both tasted good. Drinks were also good. Lastly we had capoli pizza which was good. Suggestion to have desserts mentioned in the menu and service to improve.

Last night we landed here by default , It was a last minute choice . A all veg joint with all the common favourites on the menu . Nothing special was added. It has Italian , Chinese , Mexian and Meditarian . There was no liquor . On a sunday night it was packed . The place is small and it has too many seating in the tiny place , It felt cramped and noise level was high .¬†
We were five of us with different taste. Ministrone Soup was shared and loved by both of us . Others had the corrinder soup which was not the clear variety they were hoping for. .¬†
Then came the Margretta Pizza with additional topping . Thin crust , and not too cheesy . It was better than the Domino I had last week , I think i will wait to get back to Gurgaon for pizza .¬†
The Rissoto was tomato based gravy . I found too much spices and the rice under cooked . The manager explained that the rice was different . But then we were customers who make it regularly at home and we were aware of the texture and flavor of the Italian rice. .¬†
The only saving grace was the starter which was chinese . Baby corn tossed in sauces . It was hot and crisp . The chillie level was high even for someone who enjoys Bhoot Jhokia .¬†
All in all an average place . Would i go again? no not knowingly .

Went there yesterday with my friend, this place is one of the best restaurant in city that offers quite different and unique food. Items listed on menu are hardly found in normal restaurants and being completely vegetarian makes it quite amazing.
We ordered four items.

First one was Cheese Fondue - Absolutely delightful. Melted cheese was so much good and bread was crunchy.

Second was Wantons - Quite good and yup they served us another sauce which usually they don't do in any restaurant.

Third was Max and Crunch - A Special Item on that day menu.Pasta in white sauce with a bit of crunchiness and one of the best pastas I had in my entire life till date.

Last was Tiramisu Dessert - Quite good taste of coffee can be easily recognised while taking a bite of it. Tiramisu was beyond expectation.

Whether it's ambience or whether it's staff Kudos and congratulations for services provided by these guys.

Surely waiting to go and try some more items from their menu üòÅ

On a Sunday evening, didn't feel like going out yet wanted to have something nice and interesting. Opened up Zomato, browsed a few listings and Crave Foodworks seemed like a natural choice. Also since we wanted to order a variety of stuff, the multi-cuisine offering of Crave felt even more like an apt place to order from.

Their Zomato Order was not working, in-spite of they saying that they have rebooted their device and synchronized something, we tried many times and in vain. ¬†Ultimately after trying for 30-45 mins, we eventually had to go and get it. So much for not stepping out. :-(¬†

Anyways...besides not able to avoid laziness, it was a very good meal.¬†

What we ordered :¬†

1 Spaghetti Napolita - Rs 300, Not too fond of pasta and hence just tasted. Quite good and saucy.¬†

1 Cipola Pizza - Rs. 400, steep pricing but excellent thin crust pizza with generous amount of cheese and topping. Though at home it had become cold, for dining-in it would taste incredible for sure!¬†

1 Vegetable Hakka Noodle - Rs. 225, Excellent!¬†

1 Veg Manchurian - Rs. 225, Excellent though a bit spicy.¬†

Overall tab - Rs. 1422

Pricing wise I feel the prices are higher by 10-15%.

As this area doesn't have too many options, Crave is doing a brisk business. When i went to pick the order, there were decent number of people waiting to get a table.

What works is that its pure-veg.¬†

Should you visit? Yes, absolutely!

Is crave worth raving about? Frankly... yes! I maintain that well made vegiterian food is far better that the hastily cooked animal protein that most establishment serve up . The menu is very well though out and well executed, giving the vegiterian lot a taste of the aspirational exotic food. A special shout out to the laksa , which was the first vegiterian laksa of my life but which was full flavoured and had a nice play on textures with the bean sprouts and the baby corn. Good job with the presentation though I would recommend that it should be served in a soup bowl  since the broth splattered across the table  with every clank of the table ware. The honey sesame baby corn is quite the house favourite aswell. We were served very promptly by courteous servers. The only disappointment is the ambiance, on a Saturday afternoon it was loud, with tables playing bingo and ladies  kitty parties and what not. Not really the city slicker hangout I had in mind.

Everything from soup to dessert is excellent- the khow suey here is a must try and the grand truffle is to die for . Very courteous staff and a lot of items can be prepared JAIN on request for the no onion no garlic patrons- all in all a complete dining package. Ps : reservations recommend as the place is small

Have been to this place couple of times and must say they always maintain good consistent quality and taste.

Tried the Mediterranean platter and pad Thai noodles and both were very nice.

Service is quick , the only drawback is it small and getting a table on a weekend is impossible unless you have prior booking.


Overall a good small place

Crave is an amazing little place in Southern Avenue. We visited last night around 10 pm. They seated us in a cozy corner as we were just two of us. We ordered a starter and main course and a dessert. 
They had a crackling amaranth on their specials menu which we ordered for. It's a dish similar to crackling spinach. It tasted great but it was way too oily. We could hardly eat it. We spoke to the owner about it and he agreed with us. He cancelled that dish for us which was great. 
We order an alio oglio for main course which was amazing. It reminded me of the best Italian restaurants in town. Filled with capers and olives, it was a delight. 
For dessert we had blueberry cheesecake. I loved that too. It was smooth and delicious. 
The staff is very courteous and the service is great. 
We also ordered an ice tea which was fine. Nothing too fancy. Overall it was a nice meal.

I have been to Crave twice and both the times I have received amazing service and awesome food. We had ordered a variety of items - some were good and some were superb. The items worth mentioning are - the soups, the khow suey, the mezze platter. What is@ most commendable is the service. The staff were efficient, fast and friendly. The extra point for the service.

When we arrived at Crave on a jam-packed Sunday evening, we were sure to be kept waiting for while- which we were pretty much mentally prepared for. Considering that it was a recommendation coming from a food connoisseur herself, we were expecting great food. And I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be even more amazing that I what I had expected it to be. 
To begin with the food part, we ordered a Papaya Salad which was fresh and flavoursome than I've ever had before. It had just the right melange of flavours and crispness, that's unmatchable. As for the starters, the Crispy Honey Basil Baby Corn, the Falafel Pocket and the Batata Harra Pocket were our choices. Each was unique and lavishly garnished. You'd feel like it's just been served to you, like they'd been expecting you all this while. Every bite was a tasteful blend; with a unique twist. In fact, the Crave Special Pizza was truly one of the best thin crust pizzas I've had in Kolkata at until now. It had the right percentage of crispness and just the right flavour with a tinge of spice. 
The thing you could probably give a miss, not because they were bad, but because the deliciousness of the above dishes overshadowed the others are the Quesadilla, the Burnt Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice, the Vegetable Manchurian and the Blueberry Cheesecake. 
Not to forget that the staff were courteous, the food didn't take too long to arrive inspite of being a rushed Sunday and the ambience not too noisy. 
I have to mention that it was a wonderful experience dining at Crave and the food surely has a thumbs up from me!

Crave has great food there's no doubt about that. I especially suggest the tacos and the risotto pomodoro. I wasn't too impressed by the decor, but the food me forget about that. I did have a problem with how limited the menu was, they need to expand the variety of dishes that are served. They also need to add some more Mexican dishes, and remove the fajitas which were the only disappointment of the evening. Also the choice of desserts is limited, but the Monte Carlo I ordered was excellent. I would say it's a must visit.

When we arrived at Crave on a jam-packed Sunday evening, we were sure to be kept waiting for while- which we were pretty much mentally prepared for. Considering that it was a recommendation coming from a food connoisseur herself, we were expecting great food. And I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be even more amazing that I what I had expected it to be. 
To begin with the food part, we ordered a Papaya Salad which was fresh and flavoursome than I've ever had before. It had just the right melange of flavours and crispness, that's unmatchable. As for the starters, the Crispy Honey Basil Baby Corn, the Falafel Pocket and the Batata Harra Pocket were our choices. Each was unique and lavishly garnished. You'd feel like it's just been served to you, like they'd been expecting you all this while. Every bite was a tasteful blend; with a unique twist. In fact, the Crave Special Pizza was truly one of the best thin crust pizzas I've had in Kolkata at until now. It had the right percentage of crispness and just the right flavour with a tinge of spice. 
The thing you could probably give a miss, not because they were bad, but because the deliciousness of the above dishes overshadowed the others are the Quesadilla, the Burnt Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice, the Vegetable Manchurian and the Blueberry Cheesecake. 
Not to forget that the staff were courteous, the food didn't take too long to arrive inspite of being a rushed Sunday and the ambience not too noisy. 
I have to mention that it was a wonderful experience dining at Crave and the food surely has a thumbs up from me!

Tucked in southern avenue...serves awesome food...vegetarian is the fare.. but if you like good food this is the place...Their cheese fondue is different as is served with veggies along with bread...The soups...pastas and the pizzas are all good...surely a place I would happily recommend...

Crave leaves me craving for more everytime I visit this place.  Neil has done a wonderful job opening a pure veg joint.  I love their Som Tam, Mediterranean platter and orange granita.  It's a pleasure to visit Crave always.

I would rate it only 0.5 for the service and 5 for the food. Horrible experience in terms of the service. I don't know why are they in such a hurry to shut down. We called them at 9:45 and asked what time is the last order and we were told it's at 10:30. We reached there at 10 and before we had even taken our seats the waiter said it's the last order. We said that just 15 minutes back they said 10:30. Again in 10 minutes, when he brought us our soup he said last order. And the worst thing, we were served our main course before the starters. Come on, you don't expect that from even a roadside stall. But the food was impeccable. I pity the chef who in spite of being so good at his job has to put up with such inefficient staff.

Being a non-vegetarian I never thought I would ever be so fond of a pure vegetarian restaurant. This place pays attention to the details, the food ingredients are always fresh and presentation is impressive. Been here a bunch of times and yet to come across a dish I didn't liked. I would definitely recommend the Laksa, Baba Ghanoush and Monte Carlo.

One of the very few good vegetarian restaurant that i have come across. A small yet amazing food they serve. And the owner himself is so courteous. We have food without onion and garlic so they went out of their way to serve good jain food and infact told us to inform them from next time in advance so they could prepare more dishes too. Service is great and so is d staff!!

I had a chance to visit this restaurant after a long long time being ib my wish list, every pennny spent here was totally worth it.

For starters we ordered papaya salad and suppli Ala Romana. Both were delicious. The presentation of the Risoto Filled cheese balls was fabulous to say the least. My son thought it is an ice cream.

Additionally we ordered Khow Suey, Mexican Ragott with rice, a mixed sauce penne pasta, potato wedges. All were very nicely done. The staff who served us was very helpful and friendly.

This was possibly the first time i have come to a restaurant where i have ordered food based on the recommendation of the server, it was an unbiased and true suggestions which made our dinner a night to remember. 

Would definately visit again to try out the other dishes.

Very poor experience. At first the waiter said 20 mins for your order as the chef has a lot of orders !!! 
We ordered the manchow soup and it looked as if the manchurian gravy has been served in a bowl. Very garlicky and not good at all. 2 mins into the soup and the waiter comes up asking if we he could serve the main course. That arrives while I am still finishing the soup. 

We ordered the standard chilli garlic noodles and a vegetable - very ordinary food and experience . 

The team really needs to be trained on customer handling.

In Kolkata we rarely find any outlets catering to vegan Crave Foodworks is one of the gem which has given importance to this category.¬†
Even through we prefer to have non vegetarian food when we are dining out, we gave it a try.¬†
We ordered for Risotto Ai Fungi and a malaysian dish Laska Curry to end with Trio Panna Cotta Shots.
The ambience is ¬†quite contemporary. ¬†
Good work guys to bring all the vegan dishes of different cuisines.

This is one place  I visit often and it never ever disappoints the vegetarian me. Even a coffee turns into a proper meal cause the food served in the next table will fuel that "craving". Their trio of panna cottas,pizzas,baba ghanoush, steamed dumplings and even the simple virgin mojito is so well made,that you cannot help but be happy. Their khowsuey is not as lavish like Asia Kitchen but will surely leave you satisfied. This place is like the world has gone veg and you can sample any cuisine despite your preferences!! 
You gotta eat here!!

The taste of food here is very good, especially for a vegetarian Continental outlet with wide ranges of choices of cuisines ¬†such as Chinese, Thai, Mediterranean, Continental and Italian.

But overall I am a ¬†bit disappointed with the place as I found the price were exorbitant especially for the portions they served.

LOCATION:

Situated on the main Southern Avenue stretch right next to Indithalia or the What's Up lounge.¬†

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Crave has been there for a while now and has earned a decent reputation amongst the vegetarians in the city. Yes, the kitchen only serves vegetarian food but serves a plethora of cuisines such as Chinese, Thai, Mediterranean, Continental and Italian. Interiors are decent but not different or luxurious. A better was to put it is that its an upscale cafe.¬†

We were 10 of us including kids for dinner last night.

WINE & DINE:

We ordered for Khowsuey, Rice Balls, Tomato Soup, Two kinds of pizza, Mezze Platter, Pesto Pasta, Arrabiatta Pasta and Chocolate Monte Carlo to finish it off.

The Khowsuey I thought was decent. But our experience of the Khowsuey was diluted y the fact that the other condiments such as lime, fried garlic, fried onions and chillies arrived 15 minutes after the dish was served. By that time we were almost done with the dish. This service lapse resulted in an incomplete experience of the dish which resulted in it tasting ordinary.

The Rice Balls were average. I thought the way it was served was an issue as fried rice balls were placed on a bed of wet cole slaw in a martini glass. This resulted in the moisture from the cole slaw making the rice balls especially at the bottom soggy when they should have been crispy. Flavor was decent though.

The Tomato Soup was the best of the lot. It was well balanced, had the right amount of sweetness and cheese and it went well with the complimentary bread basket which was serve on the table.

The pizzas were also decent. I thought the Margherita pizza was quite nice actually.

The Pesto pasta was also good although I thought they could have done with some cherry tomatoes in there to balance the richness of the dish.

The Chocolate Monte Carlo was an absolute disaster. It was frozen when it came to our table and most of the dish was like eating ice. They did not bother to keep the dish at room temperature for some time which would have resulted in it having a much better texture than it did.

While some of the dishes we had were quite nice and would have resulted in me giving them a 3.5, the main problem lay with the service. The delay in getting the condiments for the Khowsuey can be overlooked but what was irritating was the unwillingness to cater to the small requests that we had. The only replies we got were "Ill ask the chef" or "Ill see what can be done". In a place where we payed about Rs.800/head serving fried garlic with the pizza should not be difficult especially when you are serving the same with the Khowsuey. I don't know how asking for fried garlic is customizing a dish and why such a small request should be turned down by the chef especially on a ¬†fairly empty night by the look of things.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

Food is decent but not excellent. Service is lacking though. We did not feel wanted for the entire length of our dinner.¬†

VERDICT:

A restaurant where food is decent but the service simply does not live up to standards.

The Virgin mohito is just awesome to start with and set it up with the cheese fondue before diving deep into the long list of Mai  courses for your appetite.  The desserts are a notch above everywhere else with the Monte Carlo being a speciality and thr chocolate cake and Panna cotta Shota a delight. 
Its a full satisfaction at every bite

The idea of a trio pannacotta with strawberry, chocolate and caramel each, caught our fancy and since we were full with food and drinks, we decided stop by at Crave and share one dessert between the two of us.

As pretty as it looked with three colourful shot glasses with each flavour, I am not a fan of a pannacotta being served in a mould like a mousse. The beauty of it lies in its light woobly smoothness and to take that away isn't a very good idea.

As we dug in, we realized the pannacotta was dense, and pretty ordinary, but what made it worse was the absolutely sugary, packaged, strawberry syrup in one, and a crude textured chocolate mousse-ish goey something in another. The caramel one was the only decent one, and I hope the chocolate chips were not added in it. 

We left unhappy, with little interest in going back.

Went there for lunch.. Quite liked the place.. Though it's really small and cozy but the food  is really good with a huge variety and selection..we orders for the Mediterranean platter, laksa and pizza. The laksa and pizza were to die for.. The laksa was very very good.. However the drinks were very average specially the ice tea. The Mediterranean platter was also not the best but pretty good.. Ordered the tiramisu which was a major let down.. Not at all light extremely creamy and unpleasant..

This small restaurant located in Southern Avenue is a definite recommendation when it comes to food. There is a lot of variety in the menu serving - Italian, Mediterranean, Lebanese, Burmese as well as Oriental cuisines. Dishes that one should definitely try - Nachos, Pasta, Mezze Platter, Risotto! Fast service and a warm family ambience. 

Not at all recommended for desserts; highly recommended for delicious food. Must visit.

This is one of those places in the city where getting a table on a Sunday is like a mammoth task. Try reaching there at 7:30 sharp and you'll be told they are already full. After not getting place twice, I went back for lunch instead.
I must say it is absolutely worth it. Every dish they serve is really really worth tasting. Be it their risotto or the pizza or pasta or mushroom balls. Every time I go their, I am surprised that I had not I had missed this dish the last time. One of my favorite Italian joints in the city.

One of my favourite vegetarian places. I always take my pure vegetarian friends here and the food never disappoints! The have amazing papaya salad and risotto balls. The khowsuey is yummy. The oriental food was always so so, the have some good asparagus risotto. Their cheesecake and panacotta is yummy to end a meal :) the service has been decent till date.

This is one of those places in the city where getting a table on a Sunday is like a mammoth task. Try reaching there at 7:30 sharp and you'll be told they are already full. After not getting place twice, I went back for lunch instead.
I must say it is absolutely worth it. Every dish they serve is really really worth tasting. Be it their risotto or the pizza or pasta or mushroom balls. Every time I go their, I am surprised that I had not I had missed this dish the last time. One of my favorite Italian joints in the city.

Ironically the food joint is only 5 minutes from my place but never had a chance to dine in it. Today when our tummies rumbled and our tongues demanded a different taste, we came up here. The food, the ambience, the service, everything was just great. Looking forward for another visit!

My friend has been recommending this place for a very long time. Finally got a chance to visit yesterday. It's a small restaurant with not many tables but has well done interiors. The menu is huge and has multiple cuisines. We called for mushroom soup which was extremely well made. For starters theyp recommended veg satay with peanut sauce. This was a brilliant dish. Simple dish with amazing flavours. Post that we called for blue berry cheesecake. This was the only disappointment. Very few restaurants in Kolkata manage to serve a nice cheesecake and they failed to do that. It was gooey and not what exactly you would expect your cheesecake to be. Definitely recommending to my friends and relatives.

Being the compulsive carnivore that I am, I hardly set my foot to any Vegetarian Restaurant. So when I was accompanied by a friend who was vegetarian, I had no choice but to try this place out and boy I was happy!The ambiance was quite good, the servers attentive and smiling with a good knowledge of the menu on offer.
We settled for a Lemon and Coriander soup which had hints of lemon grass and was very comforting on a cold December night. The flavorsome soup paved the way for our main course which was a very simple but excellently prepared Penne Arrabiata. It had good chunks of vegetables like broccoli, different coloured peppers, olives, jalapeno etc. The Pasta was really good and I will chew my words and admit that the vegetarian of Pasta can be equally tasty and beautiful.¬†
We rounded off our meal with a Blueberry Cheesecake which was garnished with White Chocolate. The cheesecake was quite big and really good. Even the white chocolate garnish was prepared with a very good quality white chocolate!The menu of Crave Foodworks boasts of almost all types of cuisines and there is a wide range of food to choose from. Overall a very good place to eat vegetarian food which is not going to upset the non-vegetarians, with great service! I am definitely going back.

Finally visited this place after loads of positive reviews for this place,specially from close friends.

To start with,i entered,there was no seat available,however kind of Mr.Amit,the restaurant manager,to give me a reserved seat as i was alone. 

Seats were a bit crampy,but whatever has been done in the given area is highly appreciable. 

Dim interiors,good collection of songs,classy furniture with a seating available in what i must call a semi mezzanine floor. 

I oredered a Pasta (penne) in pesto sauce with extra vegetables and no olives. Pasta was boiled to perfection,you can feel the freshly made pesto sauce whirl in your tastebuds. 
Suprisingly,olives were not voided and the vegetables were in a bare minimum quantity. I had also added that you can charge extra if applicable,but disappointed with this. Secondly quantity of olive oil in the pasts was a bit high,could have used lesser oil. 

Second dish ordered was a virgin mojito,boy it was absolutely perfect. Perfect blend of lemon,sugar,mint and well presented.

Staff were courteous and helpful. They offer 3 types of olive oil (basil,chilly,garlic) and also shredded cheese along with your food.

Price point of view - A bit on the higher side,but trust me it is worth it.

Definetely worth a try and reccomendations to all my fellow foodies and friends.

Ps - review based on vegetarian food.

The place is expensive per head came upto ‚Çπ 1200 . 
All over good experience . Do try the desserts. Monte carlo was good .

This place is a must visit for every vegetarian. The sheer variety of cuisines and the exotic fare should not be missed. For that matter even if you are a Non-vegetarian you cant afford to miss this pace. Top of the recommendation is the Batata Hara pocket.

The Pesto pizza was also delightful as was the Mojito. From Tum yum soup to Pad Thai noodles everything is a treat. But don't forget to start with the Veg Satay - it takes time but is worth the wait

Great service and very helpful staff

Visited this place after hearing mixed reviews about it. It's located on Southern Avenue after Vivekananda Park and before Gol Park. This restaurant is quite small and cramped but since we went for lunch on a weekday we had no problem. But I'm sure on weekends and for dinner there must be a lot of waiting,which can be irksome. But they're expanding so maybe that problem will be looked into. 
Coming to the food whatever we had was excellent. We started with the minestrone soup and all loved it ,so much so that two of my friends ordered a second bowl! It was perfectly spiced with vegetables,rajma and bits of pasta...just perfect for a winter morning. Next we had tacos..all really liked it ,the freshness of the veggies added to the taste. Also had spring rolls which also were very tasty and the dip with it was just perfect. For the main course we had veggies in hot garlic sauce and burnt ginger fried rice...both were good. For dessert we had Chocolate  Monte Carlo...which was good but I've had better elsewhere. Overall it was a great lunch experience...where all enjoyed. Will definitely visit again to try other dishes.

Overall a good place to eat. Liked the atmosphere, hospitality and food. Had to wait for long as they have only 28 pax seating arrangements.
Biggest turn off of the evening was we found that they have a separate kitchen outside the restaurant area; like a next door where food is prepared and ferried on open pathway. We experienced a hair in our Pizza. Uploading a pic for reference.
Think next time before you go. Hope they maintain a hygiene factor.

Crave foodworks is probably one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at. It is great in every aspect. The service was quick and the staff are very helpful in telling you what's good. Coming to the food, it is great. It is just amazing and all dishes are perfectly prepared. Whether you order Mexican, Italian or any other cuisine you will not be disappointed. The only thing is it is a small place but we cannot blame them, they have made the best out of whatever they got.

Location: Near Indthalia, Southern Avenue; A few minutes from Golpark.

Crave Foodworks is among the new kids of Kolkata who have managed to survive the taste test and live on to compete against the other budding newbies and stand tall through the test of time. Crave had been on my wishlist since its opening months back, but, somehow was unable to visit even after hearing about the wonderful experiences. Finally, struck off the list on September 26, 2015 over a family dinner (8 heads), this place lived up to the expectations that were built thanks to the word of mouth by a number of knowns.

About the AMBIANCE, it suffers through a space constraint and can only manage seating around twenty heads at one go. The arrangements are undoubtedly in a cramped manner needing a urgent spacing out and thus, might be an immediate turnoff for a lot of people. All I can say is, the fruit of patience is sweet. The place has a modern yet, simple decor with ceiling panels for dim-lighting and wall-paneling for show-lighting. Laminated tables, black upholstered sofas and cushioned designer-iron chairs make up the seating arrangement. Light music as a background adds up to the mood.

Coming to the FOODING, a multi-cuisine restaurant serving not so authentic yet, lip-smacking fare spread across the Middle Eastern, Chinese, Mexican and Italian cuisines.
After a bit of contemplation, the following was called for:

- Crispy Honey Basil Babycorn
A twist to the usual Crispy Chilli Babycorn was found to be a hit. Crispy fried Babycorn saut√©ed with sliced shallots and basil leaves in a honey based sauce. Served with a generous sprinkle of sesame seeds. Even after being poles apart, none of the flavors were overpowering. Perfect balance. Delicious it was. Recommended.

- Cheese Jalape√±o Poppers
Finger-shaped fritters filled with generous amount of cheese but, little jalape√±o. Missed the zing flavor of the jalape√±o. Served with a tangy salsa dip and sweet cheese jalape√±o dip drizzled around the plate. Nice presentation. Tasted nice.

- Cheese Fondue
Oh so cheesy!! Hot melted herbed cheese served along with saut√©ed pimentos, baby cabbage, bell peppers, mushrooms, babycorn¬† and garlic flavored croutons. Was among the best fondues I have come across till date. Cheesilicious! Recommended.

- Mezze Platter
The platter comprised of two types of Bread (Pita Bread & Lavash), two types of Salad (Fattoush: fried pieces of pita bread combined with mixed greens; & Tabbouleh: a parsley, barley and Cherry tomato mix), Falafel, Chilli paste, and four Dips (Hummus, Lebneh, Tzatziki & Baba Ghanoush).
The pita bread was soft and nicely baked. The Lavash was aptly flavored and found to have the crunch. The crisp Falafel was moist and flavorful. Visually three dips looked almost the same, but, the flavors of all the dips were distinct and spot on.
¬† >>For people unknown of the dips, here are the base flavors/hero of the dips:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Baba Ghanoush: Charred/Smoked Aubergine.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Tzatziki: Strained Yogurt and Dill.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lebneh: Hung Curd and Feta Cheese.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Hummus: Chickpeas and lime. 

All together, the platter was delicious and a hit.

- Crave Special Burger
A flavorful and crisp patty sandwiched in a multi-grain bun along with tomato, cucumber & onion slices, mayonnaise and fresh iceberg lettuce. Served along with French fries and coleslaw on the side. The burger was delicious, fries were crisp & salted and the coleslaw fresh and cold. Recommended.

- Burmese Khowsuey (One by two)
Perfectly boiled Noodles soaked in a flavorfully balanced coconut milk topped with sprouts served along with add-ons (crispy noodles, crispy garlic, thinly sliced green chilies, raw onion & cucumber, and lemon wedges) on the side. Add as per personal taste preferences. :)
An absolute delicacy it was. Recommended.
However a few add-ons (thinly sliced raw ginger, roasted peanuts, chopped coriander leaves) were missed. Hope they are also added to the tray.

- Penne Marinara (Mixed Sauce Pasta)
Penne pasta tossed in a perfectly balanced mix of arrabiatta and becham√©l sauce. However, the pasta needed a couple of more minutes over the boiler. Apart from that, the dish tasted good. 

- Spaghetti Aglio e Olio
Perfectly boiled spaghetti tossed along with saut√©ed garlic pods, pickled olives and herbs. The flavors were found to be spot on. Recommended.

- Crave Special Pizza
A nicely done thin crust pizza with a topping of char-grilled pimentos, caramelized shallots, pickled black olives & jalape√±os, oven-roast tomatoes, broccoli, american corn and thinly sliced assortment of bell peppers. Baked with a topping of cheddar and mozzarella cheese which could have been slightly more. Nevertheless, the pizza was delicious to taste.

‚Ä¢ The portions were extremely generous and a single order of each sufficed. Kindly check with the staff before ordering. No one would love wastage of food. :)

The STAFF were found to be courteous, friendly and had a fair knowledge about the fare. The SERVICE was prompt.
PRICES were found to be slightly inclined towards the higher end. The above affair left the wallet lighter by INR 5000.

Overall was a good experience.
- A spacing out could be considered soon. Nevertheless, if one doesn't mind the space constraint, this place is a definite try. :)
- Yet to try the desserts, would visit soon.

Loved this place. I judged this place from the outside(and also the fact that this was a pure vegetarian restaurant) and had decided that the Italian food in kolkata would be bad. Buy Oh my god! This place will surprise you with the flavours. The Suppli Alla Romana and the Assorted Bruschetta were good for starters. Penne Marinara and Spaghetti Basilica are good options for pasta. The Risotto Ai Fungi was delicious. The Cipola and Mediterranean pizza options were good and crispy. The nachos and Quesadilla were very well made. You should order the Khowsuey here and pan fried noodles. To end with dessert I can vouch for the Chocolate Monte Carlo, Tiramisu and the Darsaan being tasteful.

Like good things come in small packages, for this place can I say sumptuous dining experiences are probably set in small places? ;) Another restaurant at Southern Avenue which I'd love to recommend to veggie lovers and the hardcore non-veg foodies who sometimes do crave for delicious veg dishes. Service was quick, staff was courteous, food was spoon-licking good. ;) We had gone for lunch and had ordered for the following -

1. Tacos - The filling was well made.
2. Mixed sauce penne pasta - This had a slight smoky flavour. Tasted good overall when seasoned with oregano, chilli flakes and parmesan cheese.
3. Virgin Mojito - Refreshing and just the right amount to have with a meal.
4. Tiramisu - Pretty good
5. Monte Carlo - Super yummy! A glass full of brownies and vanilla ice cream topped with praline and caramel. It was the perfect ending to a delicious meal. The quantity is good enough for two.

Not very often do we get to savour a meal when each and every dish are almost equally good. This seems like an exception. Seating was comfortable enough. Tables though I wish were a little more larger.

Do visit if you've got a bunch of buddies with varied cuisine preferences. You won't be disappointed. :)

Firstly I would stress upon the fact that the table shall be reserved well before as it is very difficult to get a place here even on weekdays( also the manager seems very unwilling to arrange a place though the 

booking was one hour later from when we entered). Now the most important aspect of this vegetarian delightful food joint- food. It is a boon for people who are vegetarian foodies and also to those for whom being vegetarian is next to impossible. It serves to people from both the worlds. We ordered Manchow soup which was simply soulful. Well garnished with fried noodles, the flavours were relishing. Then we ordered Mediterranean dish Pita pockets hara batata. It was really yummy. Well filled pita pockets with salad, humus, potato wedges and served with a dip. Lebanese at its best. We ended our amazing food experience with a soulful dessert which was none other than Montecarlo. Simply ecstatic with loads of icecream and melting chocolate in the mouth. So overall a great experience. Looking forward for next session very soon but with a more polite and warm welcome of the guests instead of skepticism and rough approach of the manager.

I would certainly recommend this fantastic Italian/Thai/Mexican eatery to all Veg food lovers and for a change of taste in buds for the non veg eaters. We all know about our variety of Indian vegetarian cuisine so traditional and famous all over the world. However, for me who have never had anything other than Pasta and Pizza as Italian food, the Cheese Fondue was simply great, Brocolli soup was like melting cream and greens ... :) ... Risotto was good but should have chosen something else. Ambience is good. Serving prompt , recommendations good. What was awesome was the Dessert , MONTE CARLO ... never tasted something so good of late ... it was really sinful to dig into a luxury of nuts and chocolates with chocolate sauce, brownie and ice cream ... too yummy for words. Hope to visit again soon.

I'm not totally into veg meals but when you have got veggie friends, it's nice place to hangout with good veg food. Giving 4/5 for overall experience we had, if it was just for food, would have given 3.5/5, but indeed a good place it is...

I liked the place very much üòä. Went on a Sunday evening with a friend. Was amused to see a place so near serving only veg. As we went on evening time so there was very less crowd. We had a pizza and I had one cold lemon tea. Price was good. The pizza was good. Overall I'd rate it 4/5.

Okay, firstly, this place is AMAZING!
Everything from the decor, the menu, the music, the ambience, the service to the food is simply amazing! 
I wouldve loved to give it 5stars but there were basically two reasons why i didnt:
1. I got frozen cheesecake even though i specifically asked to check if it was frozen or baked. (The waiter probably misheard me) but i hate frozen cheesecake. So!
2. Chocolate panacotta was not available :'( and the strawberry-basil one tasted horrible. 

But, having said that.. I havent had such a nice dining experience in ages. And the caramel panacotta was simply amazing!!! 

I am definitely recommending this place to all my friends!!!!

With such awesome dining options coming up in the city, one can no longer say that there's a dearth of good vegetarian dining places in the city. Crave Foodworks certainly leaves an impression on you. Although the seating is very limited(approx. 25 pax) and getting a place can by tricky even during weekdays for dinner still it is worth the effort. All the dishes we ordered were amazing. Especially the Mezze platter and Lemon granitas.

Place is nice, very compact, small yet nice ambiance and good service. Went with group of friends for dinner. Serving time, food and price is pretty convincing. I'm not totally into veg meals but when you have got veggie friends, it's nice place to hangout with good veg food. Giving 4/5 for overall experience we had, if it was just for food, would have given 3.5/5, but indeed a good place it is...

Well this is my perfect food place in Kolkata :) And I literally "Carve" for "Crave Foodworks".

And I happen to have my fixed order every time coz its the best!! Though they serve Thai and Mexican also. I generally order Man chow soup, nachos (which is the best in Kolkata) with their three awesome dips, followed by pasta and then the best dessert Monte Carlo. The pizza is also equally good. But I am a pasta person. If you happen to be in Kolkata, I suggest you must try Monte Carlo here. Believe me, whoever comes to Kolkata in my family and friend circle, I make it a habit to take them to Crave Foodworks especially for Monte Carlo. 

Overall, the ambiance is decent, staff is courteous and the food is literally awesome.Will definitely keep on visiting Crave Foodworks.

Had heard great things about the place, and finally went to savour the food. It was Saturday evening, and we had to wait for some time before we got the table ... Worth the wait ...¬†
Its a small place, cozily furnished and the food presentation, serving staff and decor all were good.¬†
Now coming to the food .... Whatever we tried, we loved it. We tried 2 different types of Falafel, Mezze Platter and loved both of them. Next was Raviolli with Orange sauce, and Laksha (another name for Burmese Khow Suey) - and really enjoyed both. Overall an excellent experience ...

Pathetic experience. Horrible and insulting. Disgusting hospitality. The restaurant was totally empty when we went there at 6:40 p.m. They gave us a table and the menu. After 15 mins you come and tell us that ALL the tables are reserved and that we will have to LEAVE. This is an EMPTY restaurant. My wife and have never been so insulted in our lives. If you were booked why give us a table in the first place. You could tell us before seating us. And if you have seated us HOW DARE you ask guests to leave. Pathetic. We came all the way from Saltlake to eat at your place and you have ensured that neither I nor any of my associates will ever think of entering Crave.

I still am unable to digest the insult meted out to us. We were almost thrown out of an empty restaurant. Let's see how long your restaurant lasts with behaviour such as this.

Rubbish Place!!! First of all the prices are too  expensive compared to other famous chain of restrauants..They didn't say at first they serve only vegetarian food..We ordered for 2 plate of noodles..They gave it in 2 small bowls not adequate for a single person to eat even and they charge a premium amount for this..Then the Veg manchurian was below standard..It was too much spicy..They also didn't say anything when we asked while entering that they serve Indian Food or not..When we were placing the order then the waiter is telling that they don't serve Indian Food..Only the good item were the Tea and Lime soda..Then they gave a hefty bill...Total wastage of money and quality time..This place is absolutely not recommended and I wd never come back here again..

Ambiance and the whole set up was impressive in such a small area.... ¬†Italian , Thai , Mexican items in the menu and that to pure Veg...¬†
Went in a group and had a proper lunch from Thai soup, those who like coconut (milk) will enjoy it,¬†Mezze platter, mixed sauce Pasta, Schezwan Rice, Chilly Potato and thin crust Pizza, everything was delicious..¬†
Really one will 'Crave' for food here.....¬†
Staff,¬†Service and Quantity served was excellent and pocket friendly too as compared to other Italian restaurants..¬†
Will¬†definitely visit again to try other dishes...... Must visit....

Went to Crave on the recommendation of a friend. We ordered nachos and Fettuccini in pesto. 
NACHOS
Nacho chips - good
Refried beans - average
Salsa and sour cream - great
Cheese dip - too runny and watery for a cheese dip 

FETTUCCINI IN PESTO WITH PIMENTO AND BLACK OLIVES
Management please Google pimento. They are not the same as yellow and red bell peppers. And what you serve is creamy pesto. Please specify that. And maybe you would consider a little less flour while making the bechamel to make it creamy. It makes the whole thing bland and makes one feel bloated after having it.
Fair amount of basil in there so taste is compensated a bit. But nothing great.

I wonder how I never wrote anything about this place. This place is highly recommended for vegetarians. The cuisine is authentic. The food is to crave for, literally. I love its spinach and cheese ravioli and thin crust pizza. Apart from this I have tried falafel and pita bread, quesidillas, burger, all are great. Service becomes slow on rush days while at odd days, its timely. I still remember the chef himself asking us to review his food, personally. Great gesture. Go for it, for the food, for your taste buds.

Had heard about this place from a colleague. Good to see one more restaurant serving Vegetarian only with brilliant taste.! Yes you get it right.!

The place had a cool ambience, the service was prompt and warm.

Since we were not very hungry, we tried their Wantons, and they were very very delicious, much much better than expected.!
We also had Jalape√±o Cheese Poppers, the presentation was good and again, it was very tasty.!
We had ordered Mocha Frappe, that was not so great, seemed lesser cold than it should have been.!
Now coming to the best part, the Chocolate Monte Carlo, which was made with so much love, that every bite was heavenly.!

Truly, Crave Foodworks really did make me crave for food, and I'm surely visiting again to try more items from their menu.!

The place is a bit pricey already, I feel they should either work on their pricing or should not charge 10% extra service charge on the bill.!

This was my second visit to Crave Food works and the experience was simply awesome. We had ordered Honey Chilli Basil Babycorn for appetizer, Mexican Ragout for Main course and Chocolate Montecarlo for dessert. We tried these dishes for the first time and were not at all disappointed. All three were excellent but the dessert is a must try, it was simple superb. The only thing that the restaurant needs to work upon is their interiors and table spacing, else its a perfect dining experience.

Crave is located at Meghnad Saha Sarani.They serves delicious,delightful and decent foods.I have tried their Pasta Arrabiata contains pimento,black olives and onions in spicy tomato sauce seasoned with italian herbs. It was superb and lip smacking.In mexican cuisine,I have tried Quesadilla and it was also enjoyable.
Their restaurant set up is also impressive with sophisticated interiors which will attract anyone.
Overall, it was a wonderful experience.

Had gone there a couple of months back after being dragged there by a friend. Sadly, I was left underwhelmed by the eating experience. The place is way too overpriced and the food is way too mediocre in my view. We had ordered Minestrone soup, Balsamic Potato Salad and a Mezze Platter. The soup felt bland and the Salad tasted quite bitter for some reason. The baby potatoes in the salad felt kind of acerbic; it might suit someone's taste but definitely spoiled mine. Only the Mezze Platter was fine; but way too overpriced at 550 bucks as it does not have sufficient contents to back the price at which it is being sold. The dips and falafel in the salad along with the sauce was quite good; the bread wasn't. Overall, I wasn't satisfied with the taste of the food and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. For me, this restro is way too pricey for the kind of taste it delivers and ¬†it did not even leave me satiated at the end of the meal. I have tasted much better Italian and ¬†Middle Eastern food in the city at much lesser rates. Some people might like it of course, but this Crave does not really make me crave to go there again.

I have been to this place numerous  times and it is one of my favorite places in Southern Avenue. I find it strange that i am writing this review so late. But anyways, Crave Food works is located in the Southern Avenue in Kolkata on the Ground floor. Parking car isn‚Äôt an issue either. The parking place is available just In front of The Restaurant On Road,. So no more searching to park the car nearby. Let‚Äôs come to the restaurant. The ambience is just wow. I fell in love with it at the first sight. Also, the food is so Delicious. The quantity you get at that price is so good. Most of the places serve too little for the price. But Crave Food Works doesn‚Äôt disappoint. The quantity of the food is generous and the taste makes me go  again and again! The Waiter Was very Friendly and courteous. Thank You Crave Team.

This is the second time I am visiting the restaurant. It was a Sunday evening and totally packed up. Had to wait for some time to get the table as I didn't had prior reservation. Since it was very busy I didn't expect the taste and quality of food and service will be as good as I had when I first visited this place. But to my surprise I was totally wrong, the taste of the food and the promptness of the service were as good as I felt, the first time I visited this place. I will definitely come again....

I had visited the restaurant on 3rd of july,i believe it was one of the most pathetic experience.While we were seated on the table there was a COCKROACH moving around on the table, when complained about it,the waiter quickly removed the cockroach.after which we asked him to move us to another nearby table which was free,on this he says"Sir you would like to change the table for such a SMALL Thing".I was in shock and disbelief that did he really say that.Ultimately he didn't give us the table n we had to just leave the place.I cannot recommend anyone to go there where staff is so oblivious.One day there will be an insect on your food and the reply would be the same!!
One of the worst experience ever!

The place is exactly like the name suggests. You just can't stop craving for it. We have been there over 10 times ever since it has opened up.
 The Mezze platter is my favourite. The Hummus and baba ganoush are just amazing. The salads are also delicious. Previously they used to serve lebanese only on weekends but I guess due to popular demand they have made it available on weekdays as well.

Laksa that they serve is not something one should ever miss. PERFECT is the appropriate word for it.

The Mexican rice is excellent. The rice is perfectly cooked and the gravy tastes perfect with it. 

Virgini Mojito that they make is just bang on and goes well with the food. It just has the right amount of everything. 
The staff is very friendly and warm. You can't stop going back to this place.

A lot of variety and decently good quantity, but lacks the right taste.
They tried to innovate with the food, preparing and presenting them in fancy ways, but I would say that it backfired taste wise.
The part where it only sells vegetarian food is also a big reason why most non vegetarians won't enjoy the place much.

Size of the place is also very small and the ambience is very okayish.

Good attempt, but still a long way to go!

I was planning to try Crave Foodworks from a long time. It is a tiny place in Southern Avenue. The place has modernized contemporary look thanks to the interiors and the lights. The total setup is good. I had ordered a white sauce pasta and a risotto. Both the dishes were far beyond my expectation. The food and service is excellent. The cherry on the cake was the dessert. An orangy pastry, don't remember the name. I was delighted. It is a wonderful place that serves amazing food. I will definitely go there again. The place is too small and they serve great food. That becomes a problem. Making a reservation before hand is suggested.

Crave - as the name suggests, was a place I was lusting after every day that I would cross it. And one fine afternoon, when I couldn't control my drooling, I went over with a friend and ordered Szechwan Fried Rice with Vegetables in Hot Garlic Sauce; both the dishes had a fiery red chilli graphic suffixed.
Unfortunately for us, the young lad who took our order didn't forewarn us that these were both multi-talented items, each vying to impress our tastebuds with their overdose of ingredients.
On hindsight, a humble Vegetable Fried Rice or perhaps even a Burnt Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice would've been the perfect pairing.
My bad, I admit. Though, to be fair, my craving to return to the place remains!

(Revision To This Review: Please Refer to comments)

I am presenting this review based on my 3 visits to this place.
One of my friend recommended me Crave.
My 1st two visits were great, i did not have any single complain about the food, service, menu.
But my 3rd visit was so disappointment that i would definitely rethink for my next visit.
Starting from the point of making the reservation to the payment, i was facing humiliation in front of my friends as they have joined me on my recommendation.
Reservation: I called up the place to make a reservation for 10 people at 7:30pm and i requested them to reserve the table which is near the TV screen as my group wanted to enjoy the IPL match, after sometime i got a callback from crave, the person on the phone says that they have another booking for 10 people at 9pm (by this they meant to say that i have to leave the place before 9!!, amazing gesture)(disappointment). I requested to please cancel my booking as i can not assure you the duration of my dinner and neither i want to enjoy my dinner at such a place which is asking me to leave within a specified time. In return the person on the phone apologized for the gesture and requested me to come down for dinner.
I along with my group reached the place, the staff were courteous to welcome us and guided us to the table, the table were just in front of the TV screen.(appreciation for this)
Coming on to the menu: the menu is well designed and variety of items mentioned are appealing. One thing i would like to mention is that i am in love with virgin mojito of this place, they use the right amount of appropriate ingredients to prepare the drink.(appreciation) But during my 3rd visit i was disappointed as when i asked for it they were out of ingredients but 30mins later i found the drink on another persons table, here is the service gesture which i really do not expect from crave after my 2 visits, when i mentioned this to the staff they said that the order for that table was placed before my order(i can see you take 30 mins to prepare 2 glass of virgin mojito)(disappointment).
After my food i ordered a cold coffee with ice cream drink. When the drink was served on the table i did not had a look on it as i was enjoying the cricket match. After having 1-2 sips i realized that ice cream is taste which is missing from the drink, at this point i gave up and called for cancelation of my drink as i was not in a state to face any further disappointment and requested them to please call the owner, On my 1st visit i had an interaction with the owner of crave about the food and service so i thought to mention the issues to him at that time I saw him seating on the other table, to my surprise the staff said that the owner is not present at the place!!(the person whom i am looking at is imaginary!) I again asked another person about the owner from there too i got the same reply on my mentioning the owner on the distant table the staff started to apologize. Seeing this the manager arrives and asked me that whether i am facing any problem, he expected me to detail him all the problems again which i already did to his staff. The solution which the manager suggested me really made the rating of the place to zero, the suggestion was that he can not cancel the drink but he can serve the ice cream now, (clap for you sir, as you expect me to take ice cream and my coffee separately and also you wish me to stay for few more minutes after facing lies from staff)
Suggestion to owner: i am really impressed with the taste you offer, i also enjoyed my quality time during my 1st and 2nd visit but please train your staff not to tell lies and provide some mature suggestion which food lovers can appreciate. This review is not to show up my frustration but i really expect good things from few places and crave is one of them but the 3rd visit has totally turned down your image and rating.
Overall Rating:
Food-5/5
Ambience -4/5

When it comes to Vegetarian fine dining...there is just one restaurant that lives up to the reputation, "CRAVE". Nothing comes close. Each dish perfected and how...!!

I heard about this place many of my friend's they said one of the excellent restaurant to dine in with family, friend and colleague.

It is a small restaurant nicely executed well mannered staff .

Food :- ooh wow really i thought that i will visit this place regularly and suggest this place to my known ones.

The taste and preparation of the food will take you another level.¬†

So I rated 5.0 for having this wonderful experience.

At Crave..................

The food was not value for money.  The thing is when you go out you expect that the food served is grand but when pasta served is not cheesy enough to satisfy one's apetite one gets disappointed.  The story just not ends here as the sweet dish was a massacre as we ordered the best seller sweet dish chocolate monte Carlo which was kept in refrigerator since ages and filled with so muchbutter scotch as if it is avaialble for free. Long story shor-"Maza nhi aya"

This was my second visit to Crave Foodworks.

The first time we stumbled upon this place by accident ,while looking for another restaurant that used to be in the vicinity.

I am a vegetarian and am always looking for up and coming Veggie friendly food joints.

I do not much remember the items we ordered the on our first visit ,but the most resent one yesterday is still lingering on my taste buds.

We started off with the Penne Marinara, which is basically penne pasta prepared with both white and red sauces. The taste was authentic Italian and the entire presentation of the item was just amazing .

Next we ordered a Crave special Pizza, I have to admit i was a little apprehensive at first given they only have thin crust, but boy was it a different experience , we ended up licking our fingers by the time we were done with it.

I also ordered their Crave special Burger , this beauty had been prepared with expert hands and was remarkable to taste, the buns were fresh , the patty was crisp and the whole thing was a mouthful.

We also ordered their ever refreshing mojito which was very energizing and seemed to take all the tiredness away.

I would recommend this place to all who are looking to try¬† a versatile cuisine in Veg dishes.

I cant wait to be there again soon.

Crave food works, a small joint in Southern Avenue. Nice place with close friends,
The broccoli soup was nice , the felafel I found it very heavy... Better to order in the mains. The papaya salad we just couldn't eat... Very spicy.
In the main course we ordered the stuffed ravioli pasta with orange reduction..., the look was very nice and the it was delicious 
We also ordered the MEXICAN curry rice... Interesting dish
To top it all the chocolate montecarlo was just  outstanding.

A nice cosy outlet with delicious food. We started with the suppli alla romoda which basically were cheese balls. We had the cheese risotto which was really tasty. Special mention to the orange sauce reduction ravioli which was a first in any menu I have seen in Kolkata so far. The showstopper was the crave special pizza, of which one helping wasn't enough. A thoroughly amazing dining experience.

As far as the food goes, the place lives up to its name. Excellent food; wonderfully presented.
I would have given this place at least a 4 if the seating wasn't so cramped! They've stuffed too many tables at in a small area to increase the number of prospective patrons. Dining doesn't just mean good food; the experience is very important, and you can't enjoy good food if you can't even place your legs comfortably and your elbow hits the wall every time you try to take a bite!

Crave was a Really good experience! In terms of both food and service!
We ordered for laksa Chinese Mexican and Italian!
All the cuisines well satisfied our taste buds!
For starters we had crispy chilli babycorn n it was nice! Quesadillas were good too..
Lemon coriander and ministrone soup wer nice!
Noodles and Chinese veg were well made!
Laksa was awesome! Everyone loved it equally!
Thin crust pizza was average but it was thin crust!
For desserts we had chocolate mousse cake and tiramisu! I found the mousse cake better though both were well made! 
I wasn't very happy with the ambience though and they can still work on it!
The pocket pinch was on the higher side with a total billing of around 6K ! But I was happy with the overall experience and it's a place to visit agn! :)

This was my second visit to Crave Food works and I absolutely enjoyed the experience. Little cozy place, which is all about food and friendly atmosphere. There is a whole lot of options to choose from, different cuisines and good presentation. Lemon coriander soup is really well prepared. Hot and Sour soup is classic and didn't disappoint us either. If you are a salad lover, you will enjoy the papaya salad, which is fresh with a tinge of spice at the same time. The nachos were quite different from the rest of the places. I liked how the tortillas were baked. Hummus was really good too. I have to mention that the pita breads were slightly flavoured which added to the taste. The Mexican ragout deserves a mention too. Overall, an amazing experience.

Crave is another good option for vegetarian food lovers..and does have a lot of innovations on the menu.. The crispy chilly babycorn prepared along with honey is amazing..We also had nachos, fajitas, khow suey and the mexican ragout and rice, all of which were nice. The last dish stood out. Gulp it down with a lime granita and you are in for a good evening.

P.S. The monte carlo desert is an absolute delight. Do try it:)

Food lives up but the location, decor, seating, that feel of good dinning let's the food down badly. It is like the Indian team of 90s where it was only Tendulkar and rest a let down. Go for the food but do not expect great value for your money in terms of overall experience.

The place does look shady. It certainly has shady neighbours. But its alright if you've got an informal evening in mind.
Decor - quite downmarket and dated. No hand rail support on the stairs if you require it. Inside - dull blues and greys....not very appealing for a food joint. Most importantly, as with most eateries nowadays....it did not have any noise absorption material....so I couldn't hear my friend who was sitting opposite me coz my neighbours at the adjacent tables were far better audible. There is barely 12-14 inches between tables to squeeze yourself through...and hence the lack of privacy or hearing capability in your own conversation.
Food - Italian was good. Mediterranean...really bad.
Availability - We ordered Panzanella Salad to begin with and were told after 10 minutes that its not available. So we ordered balsamic potato salad. Was ok.
Service - That was the real let down. Untrained staff. Had to turn my head to call the waiter EVERY single time we needed anything - including the menu. We poured the water ourselves, served the food for second helping ourselves and even waved with the bill booklet for it to be taken away coz we were sitting with it for so long. After all this, we paid a forced 10% of the bill amount as service fee. I say forced coz it was included in the bill amount.

Honestly, I wouldnt pay a dime for that service. As for the food, if I really crave it, I'll just order it in or do a takeaway. I'd certainly have a much better experience.

The place looks very shady and you wouldn't expect good service. But this place proves you wrong when you order for food.¬†
We ordered for nachos, arabiatta pasta, aglio olio pasta, burgers, risotto and monte carlo, ¬†All of the dishes were quite yummy and do not miss the monte carlo for desserts.
Small and cramped up place, but good service in the restaurant and quite reasonably priced.

Its a small cafe type place & being a non-veg person, I wasn't expecting much from it..
But i must admit that i was wrong.

Laksa, pesto pizza, falafel pocket, mixed sauce pasta were the few the amazing items that we tried on our 2nd visit. The laksa alone drew me twice to this place. 

However in my opinion the Chinese items that we ordered on our 1st visit wasn't up to the mark compared to their italian & mediterranean preparations..

Crave is a small and cosy restaurant in southern avenue. But dont go by its looks as the place will blow your mind. Had first come tried the food when crave was catering at an exhibition and loved it so much that I decided to pay the place a visit. This vegetarian restaurant is a packet of surprises. We ordered the aragula salad,  pesto gnocchi , mezze platter and khousuey. All the dishes were extremely tasty. I also liked the way it was served. We were given one dish at a time and when the dish was over the next one was presented. This ensured that the we could relish every dish properly and it appeased our taste buds. In a city where everyday a new restaurant is opened this one quite manages to hit the nail on the spot!

This was our first visit n we loved it. Simple yet chic decor. Minimalist yet enduring. Small yet cosy and the best part about the place we noticed was they had 8-9 attendant for 8-9 tables n so 1 on 1 service. Moreover, they were quiet, well trained n courteous. 
Now about the food. We ordered crispy honey basil baby corn for starters, Hakka noodles and Monte Carlo for dessert. Every dish was beautifully presented, served with reasonable good proportions and we were full. Pricing was fine too. We ate sumptuously and left with a thought of coming back here soon n devour the other cuisines. Kudos to the management n staff for the amazing dining experience.

I have been to crave about 3-4 times and I surely enjoy the food. The ambience is decent and cozy, especially with the place running full a lot of times. Sure it is pure veg, but the vast choices don't disappoint.¬†
Why I would choose to go again-

Great, lip smacking food. I love the Monte carlo for dessert and their thai onion pancakes get your taste buds rolling.¬†
Main course choices range from Italian to Chinese and most dishes score a four star out of five. Nachos have a nice twist.
Prices are decent and quantity good.
Their in-house breads are particularly good

Con

The only con I feel here is that if you doggy pack food, they charge you. Most places like Barbecue don‚Äôt. So that‚Äôs something the owners should think about, especially with all the taxes you are paying.

But guess as long as quality of food is not compromised, I will not complain much about this!

It's a small joint that first disappointed me telling me that I won't get a table since all tables are booked and that I will have to come back and try after a couple of hours. Seemed a little rude but after having been here now, I truly acknowledge why they asked me to come back later and try. Truly TRY, this is what you have to do to get a table here. Thankfully I have been given a table today by removing the Reserved tag. 

What a treat and whole array of cuisines got my mouth watering. Thai Chinese mexican Mediterranean Italian etc. 

The perfect ambience for an evening out with family, you can't get out craving for more from CRAVE... Highly recommendable!

Pathetic is the word to describe the place.

Pathetic grass noodle salad, cold pizzas, confused pasta, pad Thai was pathetic.

Mojito tasted like sugar syrup after being replaced 3 times.

Pizza was served before the starters coffee before the deserts in short I wasted my money going there

Small place so make sure you book a table before u go. I am non veg. So most times crave is not an option but the one time we did go I was not disappointed.  The Thai curry has a very authentic taste . and so were the pastas . what struck me abt the place was its multi cuisine veg rest. Which does not serve Indian making it a great place for veg food enthusiasts who like experimenting with different cuisines.  
Not very cheap we averaged at 500 per person. And we did not eat too much . I.e : we all had room for a lil more food in our tummy . and being a non veg I do not understand paying so much for veg food. Hence the 3.5 otherwise great food

Great food as always. Decently priced. Small place with very few tables. 
Though a small suggestion, please try and work with presentation of food. Is very average, i am sure a little creativity with look will make the place fancy.
Even ambience needs a little more spark at present.
Confectionary corner was almost empty and didn't get me tempted to bit anything.

Few restaurants provide you with an amazing all-round experience and I believe that Crave is one of those few! 

I have been there twice now and having tried out various items on the menu, I am now comfortable with the notion of ordering anything from their menu and expecting it to be good. 
Portions are sufficient for 2-3 people and at the prices, are a good deal. What makes it special is that depending on the cuisine you order, the condiments, spices, and other add-on's change. For example: While we were having Italian, there was Oregano, Chilli Flakes, Olive Oil etc. When we were then having Mexican, the condiments changed to Sour Cream, Salsa etc which adds to the mood.The Spaghetti Aglio E Olio which had a strong flavor of basil that made it stand out. ¬†The Crave Special pizza seems to be an overload of toppings but it is actually an overload of awesomeness. The Nachos have a different (nice) flavour and the presentation is done really well! Before coming here the only place in Calcutta which served good Fajitas was Jalapenos, but after trying the Fajitas here, I'm replacing Jalapenos with this. The Papaya Salad has strong overtones of lemongrass, which I personally love, so that was good for me (caution: For all those who prefer less spicy food, please ask them to make the salad medium spicy). The Green Curry with Lemon Steamed Rice also had a distinct flavour to it (again, I assume it was the lemongrass) but it retained the basics of the dish and overall the dish was fantastic.
Both times we went, table was arranged promptly and we did not have any issues with the service. The dishes came promptly, the staff was courteous and the place, though small, has roomy tables and cushioned chairs.¬†So all in all, the place was great and I'm definitely adding this to my top favourites in the city.

The food is really nice, especially Khowsuey and Cheese fondue. The only issue is the pricing, which seems steep at about 620 bucks for each of these (including taxes). Management could do something about it, provided it feels the feedback makes business sense!!

PS: The Monte Carlo can be improved, pls try the Conclave Monte Carlo to know what I am talking about!

As the menu is huge I could only taste the falafel pocket, quesadillas and Monte Carlo. All three dishes were delicious. I'm sure the other dishes will also be good. The choice of cuisines range from Mediterranean to the fast east. I definitely recommend it. If u have the craving to eat good food go to crave foodworks.

Food was excellent .loved the interiors. But not satisfied with service. All staffs were in a hurry. Despite having very good food people cannot enjoy a perfect meal as the place is small and the staff is in hurry to serve and let the table get empty. Since deserts take time we were denied deserts by saying that all deserts are over , while desserts were just served in beside table. The food quality was up to the mark. A good place if take away is needed or ask for home delivery , but not a dine out place as you can't spent quality time if crowded.

At first glimpse, the place is rather nondescript. However, it had a cosy, cafe feel to it. Ordered a thai papaya salad. We felt it was a bit on the sweeter side but relished it nevertheless. Next up was mexican tacos and it was just perfect. The spinach and feta cheese Ravioli took the cake. We wanted it to last us for a much longer time. Had a great after taste. The sizzling brownie with chocolate sauce was our last indulgence. The evening ended on a high note and if only we had an extra stomach would have loved to try some of the other delectable items on the menu. 
Will definitely come back for more !

Have you ever wondered how can world class cuisines be good only with vegetarian options. Well no for sure. Isn't it? Not anymore. Crave has changed all the things possible in this field. This eatery is completely vegetarian and I must say it is a class apart.

I along with my wife and hr friends had gone there for lunch in Nove,ber. We were hungry and we wanted something new. We looked for places and opted this out to have the sunday lunch. It was recommended and truly it was an experience of a lifetime.

As we all were badly hungry to eat something new and that too outside of home we ordered quite a lot of things. Nachos, veg satay, manchow soup, lemon coriander soup, fuseli marinara, mexican ragout, american corn was what we ordered. And seriously they were brilliantly made and served one after the other in a well organised manner. Simply awesome is the word and we crave to be at the crave whenever possible.

The service was also cool. For 6-7 tables there were more than 8 staffs. We were attended and heard quite well. Everything was perfect which you would want to have in a sunday brunch.

The only two things which was say short or not likable were that the place is too small and that it plays loud music. This we forgave as soon as we started tasting the magnificent delicacies. But i always would prefer for a peaceful and spacious place to eat. So if u crave only for good and a high class food then crave is the place for you. But if u do not like loud music then you can try it once.:P

It is not that expensive also. Very reasonable rates and very affordable unlike other places with italian, mexican and chinese cuisines.

Crave Foodworks is highly recommended by me and a must try. Five stars from my and friend's end.

Went there on Sunday at sharp 7pm. Called them up before landing at the place and was told you may walk in. 

First thing when I was entering the place, I asked the person on the gate about valet parking. A very polite answer was yes sir we do Have. So I asked him where is the person who can take my car ( my friend was driving ). Immediately another person landed in conversation and said this entire road is a parking place and I can park anywhere. But when I asked where is the valet as said by your person. He said no valet service. 

Never mind we all entered after parking and the place was deserted with no guest and 6 waiters standing. I asked for a table for 5 and I was told to proceed towards a table meant for 4 with a word to give a chair. 
We all were about to sit but were interrupted by the same person who had put his leg in my earlier conversation bluntly saying - Sorry No TABLE. We are packed for the evening. I did confront  him about my call  some time  back about booking as well as other person instructions is for this particular table. He said his staff is not aware of the bookings. I checked all 6 tables and found only 2 tables had Reserved tag. 

I just walked out by simply saying this sort of arrogance to a new and small place is not good for the future. 

Anyways would not come back for an insult again and would re inns others too about take note.

If management can see this review, do check with this particular person to avoid  any such incidents in future.

Everything about this place except its ambience is amazing. Great staff, great variety of menu and their seems to be good homework done behind the recipes too. Definitely a must visit place for vegetarians. Could have been better if the place was a little bigger, with better interior decoration.

Amazing place for a visit with family or friends. Nice ambience, savvy food, great staff. The way they serve or present the dish is awesome. Basil sweet corn is a must have. I went on a weekday so couldn't have any Mediterranean servings. Hope to taste it soon. The soups are good too. 
Overall a great place to calm down in your hectic schedule. The service is fast. The food is hot.

I went to Crave with some friends about 2 months back. I ordered the Mexican food and found it barely mediocre, but my friend's Thai green curry was quite excellent. I live near this restaurant which is on Southern avenue and when I fractured my toe it was my first choice since I couldn't walk much on my foot and taxis were on strike (what's new?). So my friends and I (party of 5) went straight to Crave. The staff informed us that we would have to wait about thirty minutes. We waited patiently outside for 30 mns. then went to see what the situation was. At this point, there were other customers waiting for a table too. We suggested that they take our name, since it was really crowded. We waited 30 mns more, were asked to be patient and each time assured that a table would soon be free... another half hour passed and we realized that they had given the tables to newcomers! They rudely ignored us when we went to protest. I will never set foot there again - no matter the proximity or the taste of their green curry!

---------------------------------REVISED REVIEW--------------Visited again.. With a friend...the staff was courteous .. We ordered for bruschetta again..yes this time food was hot , fresh and amazing.
Also ordered for an arrabiata pasta which was delicious! 
Total bill : 677

Happy to see the much needed improvement!
Keep it up guys!
------------------------------------------------------------------@
My first and possibly the last visit to this place.

It is located in Southern Avenue outside keyatala road. I was here on sunday (07.09.2014)¬† with my friend and we were famished. We were instantly offered a table and we sat comfortably.
The ambience of this place is kept fuss free but neat. We quickly placed our order.
We ordered for Bruschetta done two ways and a plate of aglio olio. Then begun my painful experience!
Our food hadnt arrived in over 35-40mins! I complained¬† thrice and then finally a server comes and tells us that our pasta is ready and if they can serve it first. I agreed!( though i wanted my appetizer first!) The pasta was served cold! Thats it ! I complained and they were not interested. I was so disgusted. Then they got our bruschetta which again was served cold to us

The food surprisngly tasted good and that is why i am rating this place a 2.5 ! if only it was served hot!
I ordered for my cheque and a feedback form on which i penned down m angry thoughts.!
Lastly the server came and asked me if he can clean my plate when he could see that i was still eating my bruschetta! I simply took the bread out of the plate and asked him to take it away!

The staff and service quality here is probably the worst I have ever experienced!
¬†
I¬† DO NOT RECOMMEND¬† this place to anyone! Not unless they improve their service
My disappointment only increases while i write this review! I had such huge expectations from this place after reading good reviews!

LOCATION:3.5/5
AMBIENCE: 3/5
FOOD: 2.5 (Based on taste! How could they serve cold food! :@)
PRICE:3.5
SERVICE: 0/5!

Absolutely amazing!
The food, heavenly,
The ambience, exquisite 
The menu, eclectic 
The restaurant is set in southern avenue just opposite to nazrul manch, and at the first look of the restaurant, you would feel that the place is not fit for a meal and trust me that would be your worst judgement ever. ????
The place is quite small and mostly has long queues of people waiting outside, especially on a Sunday (trust me you need a lot of patience for having a meal there on a Sunday) but it is all worth the wait. 
I went there with parents and my cousin and they too loved it and said that they had the best meal in months. We ordered thai clear soup which was a good choice for a heavy meal to come. Quite a light and healthy option I would say, followed by cheese fondue which was thoroughly relished by us. In the main course we had ordered fettuccine in pesto and risotto formaggi, followed by phad thai noodles and vegetable manchurian. The best among these all was the noodles, though all the others had a quite a close margin. 
However the dessert was the best part of the entire meal. Super delicious, palatable presentation and the best about it was that all of it was 100% veg. We had ordered a tiramisu, chocolate monte carlo, and a cheesecake. While I was busy indulging into it I somehow manages to click 1 picture of the monte carlo. 
The restaurant does complete justice to its name as it helps to satisfy your craving for a delicious meal. And once you go there it is sure that you will crave for more of it. The cost would be 700-800 pax. It is a good worth for money. Go there ASAP! :)

One of the best restaurants serving vegetarian 'world cuisine' in town. The food is delicious and the presentation is exceptional.A great plus is the courtesy shown by the staff and their prompt service.The food is always fresh and the taste is something special. Recommended fare is the cream of Tomato & Basil soup,Tacos,Spaghetti Aglio Olio,Mojito,Chilly Garlic Noodles and most of all the Green Thai Curry with Rice.The ambience is decent and whatever little is wanting can be forgotten once the food appears. The staff is well versed with their menu and is very honest in their information. A very wholesome experience after a long time,especially in Kolkata.

This place was on my wish list for a long time and today i finally went to Crave food works for lunch.

They have many Italian and Chinese cuisine but a few Mexican.¬† They also have Pizza!
To give you a quick review, this is a plush cafe with mouthwatering food.

Ambiance- the decor is simply awesome, Minimalistic, but awesome! Hygienic, a very big point for me. 

Staff- very well trained, well behaved and friendly so full marks for this. 

Food- Mouthwatering ! We had spaghetti agilio oilo ( I dont exactly remember the spelling :P ) , panfried chow and burnt ginger capsicum fried rice. Out these I loved the pasta and the chow.¬† The quality of the food is also very good 

This is a pure vegetarian restaurant so , a treat for the pure vegetarians. but this is not apt for lunch. A good place to have food in the evening. 
¬†
I would recommend this place.

First the Likes (Quite a few of them I'd say) :

- Hospitality - This was one of the highlights for a 30-seater restaurant. The owner and staff were quite warm and welcoming. The staff knew the menu, which apparently is not the case everywhere.
- The ambiance - Not the best in the city. However, cosy and elegant. I liked the simple decor, neither overdone nor minimal.- Taste - The food did satisfy my taste buds to a great extent. I particularly liked their 'Cipola Pizza' and 'Falafel Pocket'. I must recommend these as Must-try's.
- Location - The restaurant is quite conveniently located. Although you might face a problem first time around. You are sure to locate it easily on a subsequent visit.

Next, the Dislike (Only one that I remember) - The Risotto Ai Fungi - Not to my liking. Would have preferred having it creamier (as is usually the case with this dish). Also, the quantity was a disappointment.

The price seemed worth it. Would not want it to go up further, though. :P

Nevertheless, I reckon the restaurant is set to make it big and I'd recommend it to all veggie Italian lovers.

Great location, colourful and vibrant decor, uncomfortable seating, lots of food options, decent prices, great food is what sums up crave food works for me !!

Crave is located on southern avenue beside indthalia. The decor is very vibrant, colourful and has been kept trendy, although not exactly to my taste. The seats were a bit uncomfortable to me. The staff are pretty warm, polite. The owner who is himself a chef really helped us in the orders and was very honest about his menu. The menu gives you lots of options at decent prices with good serving sizes. 

Coming to food, the place claims to serve some brilliant mediterranean food, but only on weekends. Sadly could not try it since it was a weekday but definitely intend to, some time soon. I tried a mix of their items including cheese garlic bread, spaghetti aglio e olio, veg satay, mojito and except for the veg satay i loved everything. Veg satay felt bit over flavoured and saucy to me. A special mention for the spaghetti aglio e olio which was definitely amazing. They serve olive oil in three different flavours alongside the continental which deserves to be applauded.

Overall liked the food, experience !!

Amazing Place for Vegetarians. Place is located opposite Safari park.
It is small place, however nice ambiance is created. 
Has very interesting menu. It was quiet difficult to settle down on one thing.
We started with Cheese Fondu, had really yummy cheese dip with sauteed exotic vegetables. Cheese was exceptional. 
Then the owner suggested a Mediterranean platter. Another amazing dish, must try. The dips were perfect , comprised of 4 dips and a sauce (parsley and basil).
Next the pizza. Crave special, very good combination of toppings are offered.
To end the journey, desserts are must. Darson was so perfectly cooked, not too sweet, thin and crisp.

Would be visiting this place again to try more stuff!

I saw the reviews for this place n decided to give it a try. The place looks nice, the service is good, the menu is interesting and it's pure veg. However, the food was not very satisfying. The starters- spring roll n salt pepper American corn was amazing. The main course was quite good too (schezwan rice, hakka noodles and manchurian). But everything constantly had this extra taste. Either too much of monosodium glutamate (ajinomoto) is being used or the oil used isn't very good. Could b both. This makes the food unhealthy n spoils d taste once it isn't very hot. If they improve on this, I'll rate this place a 4.5! Also the pocket pinch is not more than 300-350 per person at max! That's quite nice. It wasn't very crowded since I went on a weekday. Couldn't try the desserts, all sold out. Surely it's very good. Will try it next time :)

Crave Foodworks - Did made me crave for food. 
==========================================
Intro: 

Crave Foodworks was visited yesterday when i was randomly searching Zomato on some of the new places on advertisement and therefore, i discovered Crave. It is situated right beside China Bowl, Southern avenue and is a pure Vegetarian Paradise. They only serve and specialise in vegetarian food. I had been here with one of my friend to enjoy the various dishes which they prepare. Be it thai, Indo-Chinese, Mediterranean or italian, they serve it all. I was quite impressed that a good place for the vegetarians is being opened up due to scarcity of options. 

As i entered this place, i was very much impressed with the ambience. This place had something different about it and it was mesmerising to my eyes. They even had a music juke box where you can play music from the list and as per your choices. The ambience had a very classy touch to it with good decorations done at all sides. As i was served the menu, the simplistic yet well written Introduction about their crave was written and excellently designed menu was indeed catchy to the eyes. My first impression about this place was fascinating! However, there was one spelling mistake in the menu (Tsing Soi Potato which should be Tsing Hoi potato) which was immediately took notice of. This place will surely catch up with the crowds in the near future if they continue to serve promptly!
==========================================
Beverage, Food(Chinese) and Panna cotta ordered:-

1) Orange Granita - It was more like orange flavoured gola in a special glass. I would prefer to have the natural orange one and would not even mind paying extra. But this was disappointing to me. 

2) Chilly Garlic Noodles - It was good. Yet, more on the oily side and not at all spicy. As they had mentioned in the menu that it is very spicy, they should've provided the same. The noodles were overcooked.

3) Veg Manchurian - The manchurian was good but it was blended in the gravy for a very long time. Little less time would've done wonders for me. It was not bad at all but it can be improvised much more. 

(The Chinese was served to us along with their sauces and even the salad dressing was served which is a clear depiction of excellent culinary here.)

4) Panna Cotta - It was good. The presentation was excellent. But i have had better before.To me, The best Panna cotta here is caramelle one. Though, i tried strawberry and chocolate too.

Meal for two: 800-1000 for two max.

Summary:

Food quality 4/5
Food quantity 4/5
Taste 4/5
Value for money 4/5

Hygiene 4/5
==========================================
Pros:-

1) Good hospitality.
2) Excellent decor's and a la carte.
3) Food was well..good. They said to try the other dishes as they are much superior which will be in my mind when i visit next time. 
4) Reasonably priced.
5) Pure vegetarian restaurant.

Cons:-
1) Some of the items were not available.
2) Chinese can be improved much more. 
==========================================
Conclusion:

Be it the decor, the a la carte, the service or the food, it was clearly indicating that they work quite systematically and love to take observations of what their customers liked or not. Feedback form was a nice way to get corrected with the flaws. Overall, a good place to dine in specially for veg.

A vegetarian paradise. Italian, Mexican, Mediterranean, Thai or Chinese - they have it all and cooked to super perfection. Almost like each dish has been played around with numerous times to achieve the balance it deserves. Very very reasonable too. A must try place..!! Highly recommend..!!
