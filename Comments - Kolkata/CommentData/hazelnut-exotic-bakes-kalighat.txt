Though from outside this place looks cute and fresh, the desserts did not taste as they looked. I was thankful for the AC inside, but the service was so slow - for just one shake and hazelnut pastry I took 25mins - and neither dessert was very appealing (though pastry presentation was nice). The shake was not even really a shake, just a lukewarm semi-flavored milk with whipped cream (the wc was the tastiest part about the drink). The pastry was just bland, not rich in any noticeable flavor

A cute little bakery beside apanjan in kalighat. I was here with a friend to quench the little hungers during pandal hopping. A nice place to visit for some snacks and bakes. We had oreo pastry and caramel custard. Both were delicious. The caramel custard could have been softer. Rates a re appropriate.

Value for money. This is a place for those who want quality for the money they spent. Really a hidden gem. Went for pudding I was awestruck will probably go next time for the same & much more.

This is a hidden gem located in one of the bylanes near Kalighat. The place, though small, looks cute. I was surprised with the variety of pastries and savouries that they have. Among savouries, I went for Egg Hollowin. A boiled egg with a spicy stuffing was placed in a hollow, crunchy bread. It was unique and tasted great. 

We had three pastries. The Oreo pastry had a beautiful texture, with the topping made of crushed Oreo. I, however, fell in love with the choco chip pastry. It was loaded with chocolate and choco chips. It was goeey and sinful. The last one we had was the Blueberry Cheesecake. It was wonderful, except the layer at the bottom which was slightly hard. 

Overall, loved the pastries and the Egg Hollowin. I would definitely come back to savour the rest of the amazing collections here.

Recently discovered this place on Zomato and ordered for a birthday chocolate cake and chocolate pie slices. Both the items were made well, especially the pie. Found the place to be well priced. A good experience overall.

Ambience is 4.5/5 but need to improve on the taste of the pastries and savouries. The chocolate balls and mousse are the only 2 things I liked.

Had their Chicken Sandwich and got their Assorted Sweet Cookies. This tiny place has pretty good bakes at really reasonable prices. The savouries are all chicken based, some variety would have been good though.

This is a small bakery located near Kalighat area. I changed upon it once when I was in the area. Have only tried their Cake Pops till now and they were amazing. More delicious then you would expect them to be. Pocket pinch is affordable too. Would love to try more of their items.

Discovered this interesting bakery through swiggy and i thought of giving it a try. 
The chicken ziz zag and chicken bread roll were okayish but the pineapple pastry was absolutely delightful. Hope to try other pastries soon.

Hazelnut Exotic Bakes is located close to Tapan Cinema, about 2mins walk from Kalighat Metro gate 1. Small store but their items are very good in taste. I had their Chocolate Pop and it was fantastic to taste. Prices are very reasonable here.

Came to this place yesterday with my sister. This place is located two buildings next to Apanjan in Kalighat. It's a small store selling some really good bakes at a reasonable price. We had -
Chicken Sandwich - They gave two medium sized sandwiches at 40 bucks. The filling consisted of mayo and creamy chicken and tasted pretty good.
Cake Pop - This small cute beauty was priced at just 10 bucks and tasted yummy. A chocolate cake pop topped with chocolate ganache and rainbow sprinkles - it was a delight to the eyes and also to the taste buds. 
Caramel Custard - Won't recommend this item. It was good but not as good compared to other items. It lacked smoothness and a creamy texture. The thick caramel coating on top needs improvement as well.
Chocolate Mousse - This one was my favourite of the day. It was creamy, fluffy and aery with a thick white chocolate ganache on top with shredded cake sprinkles. Loved it the most. You shouldn't miss it.
We had all of these items at a price of only 135 bucks. So, it was damn cheap, good to taste and the staff courtesy was pretty good as well. Aren't these reasons enough to come back here again? Recommended. Happy Dining! :)

This is just a two to three minute walk from the kalighat metro station. Easy to locate if you are new.
This newly opened bakery in my locality is a must go go for all the sweet tooths. 
The light quick bites are delicious. Been quite a visitor so tried many of the quick bites. The pastries are win win. The chocolate pastries, the mousse are sinful delicacies and a treat to your taste buds. 
The ambience is good rather pleasing. They are courteous and their behaviour is pleasing as well. This place is surely recommend for all the sweet tooth cravings.

Bakeries are springing up in every nook and cranny of Kolkata but a few are delivering great sweet and savoury food items. 'Hazelnut Exotic Bakes' is however a bakery which can easily be called as a 'hidden gem'. 

This little confectionary shop is located in Sadananda Road beside 'Apanjan', opposite to 'Tapan Theater'. Me and my lady visited this confectionary today at 5 p.m. The shop is a very small one. The shop has been decorated well, keeping Christmas in mind. 

We went for one 'Chicken Puff' first. From the first bite, this item stole our hearts. The chicken filling inside was delicious and was prepared well. Up next, we went for 'Baked Chicken Roll' which was also delicious. However,

Finally Hazelnut is on Zomato!! I've been searching for this place ever since I've eaten here. Oh such a lovely place!

I visited Hazelnut within the first week of it's opening. Basically I was clueless about it's existence, but on viewing it, I couldn't stop myself from splurging on the sinful delights that this place has to offer. 

It's a very beautiful little cake shop, really pretty (both interior and exterior). And the cakes are oh so lovely!

Now coming to the beautiful little creations. I am head over heels in love with their chocolate mousse, so much so that I had 3 helpings. The brownie is amazing as well. We also tried out the black forest pastry which was delicious. The fruit delight was a pretty custard with ample of fruits and the caramel custard too, prove to be a winner. 
So you can totally understand how much we hogged.

Each of the above items are recommended! And mind you, Hazelnut is CHEAP! I couldn't really believe the pricing, really! 
All of the above came within 300 bucks.

I'm so much in love with this place. This place deserves so much love and appreciation. The cakes are wonderful and so is the man who sits at the store. Really jolly and friendly, and helped in choosing the perfect cakes. 

Will definitely visit again!

A very recently opened bakery in sadananda road just beside Apanjan. The home-made cookies I bought from them were really appreciated in my home. I tried their sandwiches, chicken envelope and garlic bread. Everything is fresh and value for money. Really nice initiative by the owner.
