Wow!  Amazing sweets.  The sweet shop is opposite my friends house.  Whenever I go there I make it a point to have sweets.  I'm not a sweet lover but I have a soft corner for good sweets.  This shop is a good one.

Very bad behaviour of the staff is their biggest drawback. Sweets are ok ,but they have stopped the delicious jalebis they used to make as well as the Kochuri z. Pity.

Landed up to this place while roaming around the streets of Kestopur. There i saw some good quality of  sweets with lots of varieties . So decided to have some of them. Both the sweets tried here good.  And all the other sweets kept for display looked very decent enough.

Recently (9-Aug-2015) got 3 kgs of Mihidana from this place for an occasion. I thought it would be good, but it turned out to be excellent. Sometimes the quality of sweets rendered by small shops surpasses the expectations. Hope they sustain the quality.

Gur based korapak sondhesh tasted good. But the singara was bad. There was a taste of burnt oil in the singara. Prices are commensurate with quality.
