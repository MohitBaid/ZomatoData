This place is one of my childhood keepers. Whenever I visit this place this takes me down the memory lane. It has same old smell and decor. I go to this place every year and that too always with family. This time also I went there and like always the pork dishes didn't fail to satisfy my taste buds. They still have authentic flavours in there food. Rice and noodles are not the best here but one can bet on there pork roast and chilli chicken. Before, it was one of the high priced restaurants but now their price range is like many other restaurants.

We ordered the Thai soup which was a little spicy but really delicious. Then for main course, we ordered Chicken gravy noodles and chilly chicken. The chilly chicken was extremely good. Perhaps the best I have ever had. 
Food - 4.5/5

One of the oldest joint in the area... Nice cozy ambience... Staffs are very friendly... Service is good too... Decor was bright and beautiful... We ordered a fried chilli pork, chilli chicken and a mixed hakka noodles... All were good in taste nothing extraordinary... Mainly it is good place for boozing... Pocket pinch is bit high I think...

Located at Theatre Road near Mullick Bazar, it is a very easy place to reach from Rabindra Sadan or from Park Circus Seven Point Crossing.

The place is quite good. Not that much crowded at times. The service is also very good. The price is on the higher side but every penny is worth of it.

Now this is my favourite place. I love the food here. It's light and not too much oily. I ordered a Chicken Black Mushroom Soup, a Chilli Roast Pork, a Mixed Chow and a Lemon Chicken. Now the Pork was delicious, well served and was dish to enjoy.
The Soup was also very light. The Lemon Chicken as always and the Mixed Chow was very good. The Chow dish looked too good when it was served. It was covered with egg fries and beneath that there was the Chow with Porks, Prawns and Chickenswith the Chow.

P.S. If you are a Pork lover this is the place to try out. :)

Quality Revived: Experienced marked all-round improvement 
- Environment: mostly a setup for take-away. But still decently caters for those who choose to sit around and enjoy...
- Quality of service: Good...Enjoyed the care with which suggestions were made leading to a healthy choice from menu
- Food: certain items were very tasty: Soups, Fish fillet, noodles....though Fried rice was sino-avadhi mix and did not quite appeal to my taste buds
Overall: Will definitely consider to return for more...Great revival - hope to see it being sustained...Am attached partially due to nostalgia

Restaurant is small but very beautiful and looks great.

ALL THERE DISHES ARE SIMPLY TOO GOOD.

I GOING TO THIS RESTAURANT FROM MY CHILDHOOD WITH MY FATHER.
THIS RESTAURANT IS NOT JUST A RESTAURANT FOR ME IT IS A LOVELY MEMORY FOR ME.

I LOVE THERE SOFT NOODLES AND CHICKEN SPRING ROLL.

Paid a visit to Jimmy's on the evening of Poila Boisakh (Bengali New Year Day) this year with my family and a friend with his family. Waiting time was approx 45 minutes. While that can spoil the mood easily, but we waited for our turn. This was my first time to this restaurant, the interiors were decent. We had veg and non veg soups and starters, followed by main course. I particularly liked the Chicken Broth with boiled vegetable that was ordered for one of the kids. We later ordered Mixed Fried Rice & Chicken Noodles to go with a dish that was suggested by one of the crew. We liked the food and enjoyed the overall experience.

1.Had Fresh Lime Soda which was quite mediocre.
2.Had Fried Shanghai Chicken which tasted great.
3.Had Fried Chilli Pork which was soft and juicy.
4.Had their Special Fried Rice, Sichuan Spicy Fried Rice, Singaporean Rice Noodles, Mongolian Chicken and Chilli Roast Pork in the main course. All of them tasted great and were properly cooked. The meat was tender and juicy in every dish.
5.Service is neither slow nor quick.
6.Staff members are polite.
7.Pricing is reasonable.
8.A great place to visit with friends and family. Only problem being that they only have tables for upto 4 people. Though we were 5 and one of us had to sit on an additional chair.

We placed an order online tonight for dinner. We were terribly hungry and was not in the mood of experimenting. So we chose the obvious ; veg hakka noodles and mandarin fish. The noodles tasted just ok but the quality of the fish was extremely poor. It also had a raw smell. The fish was just sauted in tomato ketchup with some veggies. I have visited this place several times though not in the recent past. I had far better expectations from this restaurant but have lost it completely today. The basa which they used of very poor grade n low cost.I think they too are in cost-cutting mode. Regret to say that I won't opt for this place again.

I loved the Lung Fung soup and the mixed Hakka noodles but the hot garlic chicken was ok. Although the place is not that big and the ambience is also ok but I really enjoyed myself​.

Jimmy's Kitchen was an age old favourite straight from the time that my mother was a kid. In those time's, Jimmy's was the best. And I am happy that it has remained the same. The food was as premium and authentic as my mother had known it to be and it surely is a level above all the Chinese joints in the city. The service was a quite the best and quantity of food was such that we literally had to pack it home after trying to have a full course lunch. The best dish of theirs is undoubtedly the chopsuey and I would literally rank it the best in the city. The ambience is just brilliant and is quite as it had been years ago. The only small downer is the premium pricing. But just have the food and you will be so busy licking your fingers that either you will give the price happily or you will literally forget about the pricing.

Went there with my parents. First thing which I noticed about this place is that the staff are not at all cordial. When we entered the place was nearly full and the waiters weren't even there to greet with a friendly smile. The waiters were too mechanical. Then a staff asked us to sit at the only empty table left in the restaurant. 
We ordered chicken fried rice and chicken in hot garlic sauce. The service was prompt though I felt that the chicken in hot garlic sauce was a bit undercooked. Overall, not really satisfied

This place has been around for eternity. One of the most famous names of Kolkata serving mouth watering Chinese delicacies. The ambience is old school and a bit shabby. The restaurant definitely has a shortage of space and seems to be understaffed especially when it gets crowded. Leaving these cons aside, the food they serve has been exquisitely good, and that too since times immemorial. Their Fried Chilli Chicken, Fried Pepper Chicken, Spring rolls,  Dumplings are the ones to savour, not to forget the Chowmein and the Fried Rice. The food is what makes me come back each and every time and undoubtedly is the factor that keeps this place ticking.

Friends please avoid this place as the food served are of average quality and the service staffs are horrible.  You have to plead with waiter to take your order. They accept table reservation but will only keep the seats reserved and will make the guest wait in que. The ice creams are served in plastic cups at triple amount of the MRP.

This is a place that  offers a good selection of food and drink which is combined with good service.

Perhaps one of the older restaurants in Kolkata it still manages to maintain its traditional menu with the recent addition of Hot and Sour Soupy Noodles.  This is a bar cum restaurant. The Mixed schezwan fried rice with red chilly chicken is a very popular dish here. Their Chili chicken and dry chili prawn is super and accompanying noodles quite a savory delight. 
But the place is definitely a little cramped! But that's not going to stop us from visiting again!

After a brilliant show at Kala Mandir, I was looking around for a place to crash in nearby for dinner, and in I hopped into Jimmy's Kitchen. The place is a small one, albeit a pretty renowned one. It has an accompanying bar, and I guess most people who flocked in had come along for a pint of beer in the cold winter night. I wasn't part of the herd, though. And since I was suffering from a cold, I decided to try for the hotter soup instead. So, my order consisted of a Lung Fung Soup, an American Chopsui and Kung Pao Chicken. The soup was hot, and much of a relief  in the weather. I wasn't expecting a top-notch preparation, and it was pretty good by its standards. The portions of meat were generous and well prepared. The American ChopSui they serve is sufficient for two, and since we were quite hungry, we gobbled up the whole of it quite fast. I loved it! It was crunchy and the sauce along with the portions of chicken and pork, garnished with egg on top, made for a sumptuous dinner. I was so engrossed in it that I nearly neglected the chicken. It tasted avergae, but the waiter served us a regular bowl (which is pretty big by the way) instead of a small one, without asking us. 

Overall, a nice place to drop in for drinks and meal, if you're nearby. The prices aren't high, but not too low either.

Nice cosy place with warm colours and soothing atmosphere. The space is small but they have managed it well. We went there for dinner and ordered for Dry Chilli Chicken as appetizer, and Special Fried Rice along with Schezwan Chicken. The cuisine is mainly Indo-Chinese, which they have perfected. The service was good too. The only thing that bothers is their steep price. But I personally would visit again.

Had to give them 1. Coz there's nothing lower than that. In all honesty this place deserves a negative rating. Spoiled my mom-dad's 25th anniversary. The billing amount was 2488 for 3people. Not that we spent miserly... but the food wasn't worth Rs. 24. Street stalls make better chow, and bapi da makes better momos.

CONS :
Extremely Overpriced
Quantity abysmally low
OILIEST, BLANDEST CHINESE FOOD IN TOWN

PROS :
Nil. Nada. ZILCH!!! 

(If you want to have good Chinese... opt for Mainland China or Hatari... way way better... if you want budget places go for Beijing or Tung Nam, both way better than Jimmy's Kitchen at half the price)

I have been visiting this place regularly for the past one and half years, since its right next to my current work place. You know some food is really good when you dont get bored of it in spite of having the same dishes over and over again. I love the mixed cantonese noodles, roasted chilli pork and dry chilli chicken that they serve. Every time i visit this place, i plan to have something else, but eventually end up having the same dishes.
The ambience is very old school and cozy. The staffs are nice and polite. Food and drinks are priced fair.

This restaurant I visit always gives me an old school feeling... I have been dining in this restaurant since childhood..but the menu never bores me to visit the place again and again.. I have always visited there Theatre Road restaurant so I can review about the service they provide in this particular joint.. The place is very small...but the sitting arrangement is such that you won't be disturbed while you are dining with your family..waiters are mostly old staff but very hospitable.. Service is bit slow but when the food comes to you table.. It's worth the wait.. You must try American chopshuey , Thai soup , the mixed fried rice is excellent... Hakka noodles mixed is succulent and tasty... The portion of is also good..

I had to visit this place 4 times in 7days this month. One of the oldest in the competition. The roasted chilli pork is out of the world. The only reason I gave it a 3.5 is because the place is not at all clean. I had 3-4 cockroaches roaming around my table. Otherwise this place serves good food and good alcohol.

Jimmy's Kitchen is more like an institution, it has been there for generations and our family and friends have been visiting it ever since it opened doors.... Yesterday we went for dinner, the whole lot of us and were seated immediately. We ordered chicken schezwan soup, sweet corn veg soup, chicken clear soup and schezwan soup with crab meat. All of them were delicious, wholesome and comforting. The schezwan was tad too hot... for the entrée we ordered crispy fried baby corn, spring chicken, chicken spring rolls and our family favourite golden fried Prawn... And my oh my... Perfection!!! The entrée was so massive that the mains we had to cut short to fried rice, cantonese noodles, garlic prawns, Kung pao veggies and the famous chilli chicken boneless (dry). We died and went to food heaven. The only thing that was a slight let down was the fresh lime soda. But over all it was as wonderful as ever! Yummilicious!

Located on the AJC Bose Road, near the theatre road, i have been visiting this tangra type Chinese eatery since the last 15 yrs. The place is bit small, crowded, but food taste is brilliant - though its a bit expensive. Love their mixed hakka chowmein specially as its assorted with all kinds of red meats.

I have been going to this place with my grand dad and my whole family since childhood ... 
Earlier they used to serve food with the sound of a bell from the kitchen ... 
This tym when I went to Kolkata for Durga puja I went back to this place ... 
This tym I was no more a kid and was treating my family to a sumptuous spread of yummy Chinese ... 
We ordered friend prawns which are not the way they used to be ...
Fish fingers ... Which were good ... 
Crispy chicken was very good ... 
American chopsuey was average ... 
Chicken or mixed noodles was great ... 
Mixed fried rice was tasty but chicken fried rice was the show stopper ... Also boneless chilli chicken which had 8 pieces and was really yum ... 
Only one problem ... There were no desserts to order .... 
Came back with a happy stomach ...

Again a restaurant in which I've eaten since donkeys years. Whenever I'm looking for comfort Steamed Chinese food, I get a takeaway from here. My order always comprises of the gravy chowmein, egg fried rice and chicken with mix veg. All these items are not fried and non spicy but very flavoursome. Especially when one has a cold then chicken noodles in soup is the best to have! They have recently increased their prices a lot which is a major drawback!

If I am ever asked which place in Kolkata serves the most premium and authentic Chinese food, I'll have only one answer - Jimmy's Kitchen.

Jimmy's Kitchen is a cult when it comes to dry chilli chicken or dry chilli pork. No other place in and around Theatre Road can make these dishes better than Jimmy's Kitchen. When ever,  I visit this place, I make it a point to have a lunch or dinner with hot and sour soup,  chicken fried rice along with either chilli pork or chilli chicken.

Went there for lunch after shopping. The ambience was good. A small area with probably 8 seatings. They managed a bar in that small area too. The place was well decorated and lighting was dim. Now coming to the food. We ordered chicken cantonese noodles and we asked the staff for a recommendation of a side dish. He suggested tossed chicken, we agreed. The service was quick. It took about 20 mins to serve the order. The quantity was good. One chicken cantonese noodles was enough for two. The staff were good and friendly. I found the place to be expensive compared to the quality of food they serve. It was my first and last visit. 

Chicken cantonese noodles :- The noodles was hard and thin. The gravy was good. There was small pieces of chicken and it had raw smell. Veggies were in good amount. The price was too much for that quality of noodles. 

Tossed chicken :- They provided 8 pieces of fried chicken. It was full of crispy curry leaves, chilly pieces and garlic pieces. It was dry. The chicken pieces were well fried and red. They were tasteless from inside no spices at all not even salt. It was not at all going with the noodles. Again the price was too high for the dish.

This place is decent enough for non veg lovers and veg options are very limited. Situated at theatre road near Kala mandir it has seating space which is almost full and also serves the Park Circus crowd craving for biryanis. Overall the place can be tried once if u don't find a place to eat in Park Street theatre road area.

This one is located right at the Kalamandir bus stop, at the entrance to the Shakespeare Sarani, just as you get off the A.J.C. Bose flyover. 

Its a famous place and I have tried their Mixed Gravy Noodles. The dish was simply awesome. It had ample portions of chicken, prawn and pork. Its one of the best I have had ever along with Chowman's. The quantity was also very good. They also serve alcohol. The price is a bit on the higher side but the quality of food more than makes up for it.

I definitely look forward to visiting them again.

This used to be a restaurant that we craved for as students 12-14 years back. Visited this place after a long time. The quality of food remains the same authentic Chinese as it was years back . What I was shocked with was the arrogance of some of the waiters who didn't even care to lend a patient hearing to one of the elderly customers who was taking some time to decide about his food. This behavioural aspect needs personal involvement of the management or else in the days to come, the team of chefs would have to cook the delicacies for the staffs only.

I had been hearing loads of good stuff about Jimmy's Kitchen which ensured my visit to this place. 
But I was disappointed. 

The decor/ambiance which makes the 1st impression was very basic and simple. 3/5
Service was good. Staff was courteous. 4/5
Portion was good. 4/5

Coming to the food part. 
The Mixed Fried Rice tasted average. The other items were just okay. Nothing great, not too bad either. 
All I can say, the taste did not do justice to the price.

Hope they pay more attention to their culinary skills.

Located close to kala mandir at theater road this restaurant has a heritage appeal to itself. One place that my father used to bunk college and hang out with friends. And well, i have done the same. 'Like father, like daughter'. Lately there has been a dip in the quality. But they are still one of the oldest places for old style chinese cuisine. The food still remains one of my favourites.

It's my worst experience with any Chinese restaurant in Kolkata ever. First of all I ordered a chilly fried pork with a tuborg green (not sure why they don't have tuborg strong) and when I asked for the 2nd beer, they told me I have been sitting with this much order for past two hours so either I will have to complete my next beer within next 20min or I will have to leave as they have some pesticides control people coming over there. Add to that the rude behavior of the boys and the pork much on a salty side are frustrating enough. Sorry people @ Jimmy's kitchen I'm disappointed

Jimmy's kitchen is generally always linked with Chinese food near thetare road . The location is far from ideal but the food is surely among the best rated Indian Chinese food in the city next to china town (of course). Their Chili chicken and dry chili prawn is super and accompanying noodles quite a savoury delight. The restaurant is not really the ideal for a relaxed evening meal - it gets quite busy and a little cramped. Take out is fast and maybe an option. No longer the cheapest but still quite economical.

I recently went there for lunch and I really loved the place. I had heard a lot about it but this was my first visit. The ambiance was good and calm. The lighting was very dim but the Chinese is one of the best I have ever had. We started with Loong Foong Soup; it was delicious and a perfect way to commence the lunch. Followed by that we had the fried chilli pork and a hot garlic prawn sizzler. The pork was tender and crispy, especially the lard. Some parts were a little tough but since they had bite-sized portions, it wasn't a problem. I do not eat prawn but my parents and sister said that it was spicy and even better than the pork and since I loved the pork, I am assuming that the prawn must have been really wonderful. For main course we had mixed hakka noodles and chilli chicken. I personally found the chilli chicken extremely bland and ordinary and would recommend to give it a miss. The noodles, on the other hand, was the best I have ever had: it contained pork, pork fat, shrimps, chicken, scrambled egg whites and noodles all extremely flavorful. So if you do not mind having pork, please try this! My parents had mixed gravy noodles which they loved, but since I didn't try it, I can't comment especially because I'm not a fan of gravy noodles. The staff was well-behaved and guided us patiently through the menu and I would love to visit this place again soon.

I have gone here for the first time yesterday. The food was ok but doesn't have anything special. Ambience was nice. They need to educate their staff a little more about the food, as I was asking for dry items and the server is suggesting for fried items. It a place where you don't burn fuel to go, but if there can have food.

One of the oldest restaurant in kolkata. Famous for its authentic Chinese food. But unfortunately they lost the quality drastically. After a long time we visited this restaurant and ordered chicken asparagus soup which is bland, no taste at all. As starter we order golden fried prawn which is frozen and no compare with golden joy (China town). Dried chilli chicken was chiwy. In the main course mixed chowmin and sweet n sour chicken was very normal in taste which you can get in any ordinary restaurant. Lastly the waiters are not professional at all and every items in this restaurant are highly over priced compare to its quality and quantity.

very disappointed! :(

i usually enjoy Jimmy's Kitchen food. love the super spicy chinese! 
however, last night i had some unfortunate experiences with the takeaway my parents brought home for us! 

I had asked for dry chilli chicken and a soup, with roast pork.

now, usually, dry chilli chicken means it doesnt have gravy, but a thick sauce that it is tossed in, with the assorted vegetables that chilli chicken has (like bell peppers and onions). but, the chilli chicken i received was just fried chicken pakodas and chopped up green chillies! the pakodas were not even tossed in any sauce. 

i guess this is their version of it, but i gotta say, i didnt enjoy it very much.

the next problem was the soup - it looked like manchow, (although i had been told by my parents that they dont have manchow),  but i had asked for a thick chicken soup. it had a lot of yummy looking ingredients (shiitake mushrooms, etc), but it tasted only like vinegar. the overload of vinegar killed the taste of anything else. 

finally, the pork - this was made decently. although the chunky pieces were very fatty, but no complaints.

They serve one of the best chilly porks in kolkata.
And I come back here for only that often.
Last Sunday we came here for a family dinner.
We ordered Prawn Cutlet and fried chilly pork for starters and a lung fong soup to go with it.The pork was excellent as expected. But the prawn cutlet that they served didn't look like cutlets at all.
They were crumbled. So I asked them to change it.They first denied saying that this is how the cutlets should be but later changed them on me insisting that I know how their prawn cutlets look like.
For main course we ordered:
Jimmy ' s special fried rice which was excellent. And we ordered roast chilly pork to go with it. It tasted moderate.
We also ordered American Chopsuey which was extremely disappointing. It was neither Sweet nor salty and rather dry.
Along with it we ordered chilly fish which tasted fine.
They serve no desserts (only regular ice creams which too was not available)which is a major con for me.
Go there for the chilly pork.:)
However I do feel their new market branch is way better than this one.

Chinese here is good but they have deteriorated the quality out here. The food has become too oily and they have literally increased the prices drastically. Would rather prefer going for a luxury dining now rather than sitting in this small restaurant.

quiet a place , laying hidden in Shakespeare sarani . Mainly catering to Chinese cuisines. It's a small place , with new year decorations around. Food was good , not too extraordinary. But yes , the service was quick and satisfactory . We ordered Jimmy's spl fried rice , chilli fish , and dim sum .... It was good.

Had heard lots about this place, finally today I had my lunch over there.  A decent restaurant. Had tried most heard chilly chicken, roasted chilly pork both are good. Other dishes like normal mix fried rice, garlic fish, crispy chickens are just average. Also tried sweet & sour fish which was good compared to others.  Decor wise it is very normal. Overall its average.

Like many others in Kolkata, I have had the opportunity to grow up on the staples of Shiraz biriyani and chilly chicken from Jimmy's Kitchen! They still remain as fond memories. Alas, the same can't be said still. Although I still prefer biriyani from Shiraz, the latest Jimmy's Kitchen experience has been just average; although still a far cry from many a mediocre Chinese restaurants across the city. 

The Chilly Chicken still remains my favourite. I love their somewhat bland noodles. It is less oily when compared to many other options in the city- which suits my palate.

I had the opportunity to visit this Place during my pandal hopping for my dinner. Conveniently located & easy to spot for customers is a plus point for this joint. Though my 1st experience with JK was with their new market branch which turned out to be a big disaster so I was a bit sceptical at first but thankfully I had a turn of events from this place.

So now coming to our order we had the following:-

1. Chicken with vegetables soup - clear broth served with chicken dices & veggies mainly consisted of beans,cauliflower,cabbage,carrot. The taste was fine but do add the red chilli paste to enhance its taste.

2. Chicken fried rice - rice was cooked in less oil which was good health wise but the main letdown was its quantity.

3. Kung pao chicken - shredded chicken pieces made with veggies & cashew nuts. The gravy was excellent to say the least but I feel the chicken pieces could have been more in terms of its price but the taste was top notch.

So overall the experience was good enough. The main issue with this place is their quantity specially considering their steep price. The service was fast & responsive.

My experience with Chinese cuisine started here at a very young age. The food and the ambience is sort of benchmark for me to evaluate Chinese food anywhere on the earth, in a way. The food is too delicious and perfect in its own way. It keeps its standard high and unchanged since ages. Be here to experience it first hand!

I am someone who always believes in giving a positive review.. as much as possible. But Jimmy's Kitchen disappointed me. Big time.
Went there for the 1st time. Not a very huge interior space but it looked nice. Ordered chicken asparagus soup, garlic chicken and chicken prawn chow mein(gravy). 
The soup was... i don't know what to say.. messed up? There were too many things but none of it was synced. The chicken was rough and flaky. 
There was no soya sauce in our table.. so asked for it. What was brought to me was more of a soya sauce water. 
Anyways, moving on. The main course. 
The noodles. They were not washed properly after boiling... they were in clumps and sticky. 
And the gravy was way too thick. And then we noticed that the soya "whatever" sauce went missing from our table. Realised, the other table needed one. 
NO WHERE ON EARTH is garlic chicken's curry red in color. I was so confused and traumatized that I couldn't touch it.

I crave for Chinese cuisine. And it was the first time, that there were leftovers on my plate. Forget about being tasty, the food wasn't even edible. 
And it is not a huge space that the service can be poor. We had to ask for refilling water in our glasses several times.
Sorry, but i really didn't expect this. It was the very first and last time at Jimmy's Kitchen for me.

I have no idea about how this restaurant was in the past but now the food quality is very poor here.. I opted for take away, ordered jimmy's special fried rice, fried shanghai chicken and dry chilli fish, all the three items were very very ordinary but the price is exorbitant.  Waiting time was minimal, they packed the food with in 10 mins that means items were already prepared, but quality and quantity of all the items were poor. It may be a good place for having some booze but not so good  for having quality chinese food and not suitable for family dining as well..

probably the best chinese I've ever had . The food they serve here is quintessentially Chinese and not the fake stuff that are served elsewhere. Some people may dislike it but I found the experience very enriching. Quantity is sufficient enough. Price is a bit high but that maybe for the location and the ambience and the experience is worth it. Loved the special sauce they serve. Eagerly waiting for the next time I visit this place : a true blue Chinese cuisine restaurant in the heart of Kolkata which leaves up to its claim.

It's really impressive when small packages can land a big punch like Jimmy's Kitchen. A small restaurant adjacent to a major German car dealer, Audi, is not only value for money, but the quantity and quality of food is spectacular.
Whenever I visit the place, I take the usual noodle soup with dried spring chicken and gravy noodles with dry chilli chicken. It is always a treat when you pay less for so much more. The quantity is spectacular. It is worth noting how the three of us (me and my parents) had almost filled ourselves with just one portion of the noodle soup. The gravy noodle was heaped on our plates.
This place has a lot to offer. It doesn't matter if it's old or small, what matters is the food that tastes absolutely delicious.
It's a mere 1400 for three people which roughly comes to around 400-500 bucks per head. It is highly reasonable and highly recommended. For a restaurant so old and so value for money being located in central kolkata, they do a very neat job. The service is quick and although the cutlery can be a little bit cleaner, the food makes those imperfections vanish.
This restaurant is someplace everyone will have the much needed treat and the relieving burp afterwards.

Roasted chilly pork .. This place is one of those really old and famous Chinese joints of Kolkata. Simple authentic Chinese ambience with loads of Chinese lanterns and fans on the wall. Simple and comfortable sitting arrangements. This is the first joint which was opened. Their food is super amazing and this place is famous for their pork dishes and my favorite is their roasted chilly pork , pork with black mushroom and babycorn and chilly crab claws !!! 
I highly recommend this place.

If you really want to eat good Chinese food in Kolkata and are not willing to spend a truck load of money on it, Jimmy's Kitchen sounds like the perfect place. 
The place is small with limited seating capacity and bar option available. It avoids being overly pretentious about the fact that it's a Chinese restaurant with minimal decor. We ordered the shrimp, egg and chicken hakka style noodles and chicken manchurian with crispy chicken spring roll. The noodles were light, well-seasoned and with good proportions of shrimp, egg and chicken in every bite. Portion size is good enough for 2 people. The Chicken manchurian had four decent size pieces of chicken without the dense cornflour coating that most Chinese restaurants follow in India. The gravy was light and mildly spicy and unlike the gloopy, jelly like substance that is usually served elsewhere. Crispy chicken spring roll was served piping hot and had a nice exterior coating and loaded chicken filling inside. We took Drums of Heaven for take-away. Unlike other chicken lollipops, they weren't the dark red color that we are so used but they managed to be juicy and crispy at the same time. 
Overall, they have polite staff who can suggest recommendations and the service is really quick as it should be, especially Chinese cuisine. 
If you are in Kolkata, do visit this place to satisfy your Chinese craving.

I have been here a couple of times when I was a kid and when i visited the restaurant today i noticed that it had virtually not changed. It was once Calcutta's authentic Chinese joint but i guess its been overtaken by many other restaurant. I must say, though that the quality of food here is still as good as it gets. Try the chilli chicken and the jimmy's special fried rice to enthrall your taste-buds. The pricing is bit steep but your tongue doesn't mind!

My must haves here are pork fried wontons and dry chilly chicken. Do try the Cantonese noodles and the honey garlic chicken.

The food is great, specially the Golden Fried Prawn (that's a must) and the service is good. Although I had ordered a Bloody Mary cocktail which was a disappointment. The food quality has come down a bit compared to the past few years. Overall, I would say it is average and there are a lot of other restaurants I would like explore. Jimmy's Kitchen is okay for a one time visit.

Jimmy's Kitchen used to be my dad's favourite chinese restaurant in the city..Untill a point of time they used to serve one of the most authentic and delightful chinese spreads,however in the recent years they have lost the charm..the quality and quantity have reduced sharply while prices have gone north..This place is nicely maintained, cosy,though you might need to wait for sometime to get a seat in the peak hours since it is not at all spacious..the service is pretty average,servers seems to be indifferent at times giving attention to their regular tipplers only..Coming to the food:
Fried Chilli Prawn: The size of the prawns do not justify the price,also it tasted a bit too salty for my likings..
Chicken Drumstick: Yet again dissappointed by the size..I felt it was a tad over-fried..
Kung Pao Chicken: Totally bland and devoid of flavours..
Chilli Roast Pork: This was indeed the best part of the meal,a face saver..nicely cooked,loved the balance of the dish..
Jimmy's Special Cantonese Chowmein: This is basically a gravy chow..loved the special dumplings in the chow,still proteins were less in quantity..
Overall our total cheque comes to Rs.1400/- for 2 of us which is way too high considering the quality of food served and the standard of this restaurant..I could have way better buffet lunch at this price in Mainland China..Not at all recommended..
Food: 2.5/5
Pricing: 1.5/5
Service: 1.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5

Again one of those old Chinese Restaurants which three generations of my family have eaten in. At one time the food was excellent though now its lost its way a bit. However I do collect an occasional parcel for old times sake as I have fond memories of many happy meals had here with my parents and grandparents.
My recommendations will certainly be the Roast Chilli Pork which is my must eat' dish here , the crispy wantons and the hakka noodles. The crispy chilli chicken is also quite nice.

At some point of time Jimmy's Kitchen was considered one of the best Chinese restaurants in the city. Now I think over the years somewhere down the line this place has lost its touch & charm.
The seating arrangement isn't big, there's no ambience as such but well this a MUST TRY place for pork lovers! Last time I was there it was with my family and most of them are die hard pork fanatics. 
Their mixed Cantonese chowmein, mixed fried rice and roast pork can give any posh Chinese restaurant a run for their money even today. My mom absolutely loves their chilli crabs & the dry chilli chicken, it has always been two of her most favourite dishes. 
The service is rather good and the food served is quite fast but the age old interiors and the worn out sofas are a turn off the moment you step in. 
I would request the management to do something with their interiors it's high time they look into it. But if you are someone who doesn't care whether where he or she is sitting as long as the food served is delicious and fresh...this one is the place to be!

This outlet is nothing short of a legend . My first memory of this place is of my childhood and my grand dad loved the hot and sour soup here . And I had my first sweet corn soup here . And they parked a scooter inside while closing . Since it was close to my school, a lot of birthday treats have happened here . I particularly like the mangolian chicken and the Thai soup here. And the food has never  disappointed me over the years . One must come here for their soups . Simply awesome .

Went there with college friends after a gap of almost 13 -14 years. Main intention was to have pork and my friends wanted a nice place to drink.

Nice food ....nothing special to mention. I thought it was a bit costly for the quality provided

It is good, old Chinese restaurant with very tasty food and competent service. The location is also a winner.

Best items are in prawn and pork. The chicken and crab, fish is good too. But the pork and prawn is truly outstanding. Best part, it still retains a lot of quality that i have experienced in early 80s. Great.

Very old Restaurant. Old Kolkata icon maybe. Foods tastes bit different here, retaining flavours of early days of Indian Chinese cuisine.
As it is said that this cousin which we refer simply as 'Chinese' originated in old Kolkata; one can still taste that distinct flavour untampered here.

Visited the place out of curiosity and being referred by others with my wife. Ordered a starter and rice and a side dish.. all were below standard and the waiters were least interested to attend us. Items are overpriced compared to quality.. had fame in the last decade but has lost the charm in recent days..

A great restaurant is known by its consistency. To that extent Jimmy's is only next to Chung-Wah (not to mention the hidden treasure boutique  Eau Chew) as the best of Calcutta Chinese (even better than Tangra). Not to be missed are the crab Claws, Shrimp Balls, Roast Chilly Pork and Chop-Suey. You can't go wrong with anything else you order - especially the Fried rice and Chilly Chicken. Drinks are a bit steep - but what the heck the food more than deserves it to whet the appetite. The ambience is plain - with a large proportion of regulars - some old men with nubile paramours (Oh gosh, even I feel ancient) but perfectly respectable.

Went to this place with a lot of hope - good Chinese and all. I hate to say about a renowned place as this, but the food is not up to the mark. I dont judge a restaurant by the ambience or the service but by the quality of food. And the food failed to tickle my senses, which good Chinese food should. I've been to places where better Chinese food is served at lower prices. Also, I didn't feel like a valued customer there.

Jimmys Kitchen is as old as the hills and a must eat place for young new execs who are starting their careers in Cal.You get introduced to the true Calcutta Chinese cuisine. The true mother of Chinese cuisine in India !! Close to the Theatre Road,Lower Circular Road crossing Jimmys is a very standard no frills outlet. Either you eat here of take home or have them cater for your bachelor/bachelorette party!!. The food here is clean wholesome and you get the true Chino-Indian flavours and taste, They dont specialise in true Schezwan,Cantonese or Manchurian cuisine- for that you will have to go to one of the 5 stars or Tangra Chinese homes.Service is fast and the place is clean with very basic decor and furniture. Prices are really amazing--the same stuff in Delhi or Jaipur  would cost you 2/3 times more. You get big helpings at a great price. A real  budget joint.

Think of the pure taste of Chinese food and then don't think of any other place than Jimmy's Kitchen. The first time I visited this place was on my 4th birthday treat for my nursery friends and their moms. It is my mom's favourite Chinese Restaurant and has been mine since then. Last time I visited this place, then had served me Mixed Soupy Noodles with a Hat and Crispy Chilli Chicken. The hat was actually an egg in the shape of a hat. My friend and I were pleasantly surprised! The taste is undoubtedly superb and the cost reasonable. Tiny place to hang out but with great Chinese dishes.

An old favourite among a lot of friends, I have paid few visits. I always order their wantons and asparagus chicken soup. The combination is dear to me for their taste and the comfort I get out of it. I like their Jimmy's special pan fried noodles, loads of veggies and chicken. If u like black bean sauce, give it a try here, you won;t be disappointed. I wish, the quantity and quality improves by 10% and they would get a 4 from me.

This Chinese kitchen has always made me nostalgic as I used to visit this place from my childhood days. 
Recently I visited this joint again and was in awe to find the same old decor and ambience like before.  
Now about the food,  I have always like the taste and this time too I was not disappointed. Chilly pork roast and authentic pork roast  are just delicious.  I have always trusted this place for its pork preparations.  

Besides,  we ordered for crispy chicken,  chicken fried rice, chicken hakka noodles,  dry chilli chicken and kung pao chicken.  

Other than the last one,  these dishes are the safest bet at Jimmy's according to me and not to mention these are carrying the same old awesome taste and flavor as before.  Tried kung pao chicken for the first time and this too has been quite impressive. 

Yes,  the price is on slightly higher side but Jimmy's Kitchen does provide an authentic taste and classy ambience for a family dine-out...

One of the best restro of town in terms of Chinese and seafood! Went there to celebrate my bro's employment party for the first time! Also visited their branch in EM Bypass once! Dunno why , I think this one is a bit better in terms of quality ! Heard a lot about this place, one of the oldest and best in Chinese cuisines! Being a Chinese food addict came to this place with high hopes! And I was not let down! :)
The dishes had a distinct flaveor different from all other Chinese preparation I had before! It felt much more authentic and the taste was a treat to the  taste buds! We had Chicken with black mushroom Soup, Fried Ginger Chicken and Roasted Pork as starters. The soup was appetizing! Small succulent pieces of Chicken and mushrooms in a light and sweet n sour base! The Chicken pieces of ginger chicken were glazed with a nicely flavored gingery  sauce making it temping! And the Roasted Pork! mmmm....!!!! The taste still lingers in my mind!! The best roasted pork I have ever had! What flavor! Perfect in all aspects that particular dish just blew me away! The pork I had in their Eastern Bypass branch were also just superb! I can any day vouch for this restro in terms of pork preparations! The starters were followed by a delightful combo of Chicken and Shrimp Fried Rice and Sweat n Sour Pork. Yet again an authentic , one of a kind rice preparation with an equally authentic and phenomenal pork dish! The authenticity is the main USP of this dining place! All the dishes are like their signature dishes no where else to be found in the city! 
The interior was decorated with dimly light hanging shades , somewhat old, giving it an traditional retro look! Its was a bit congested inside as the area inside is relatively small judging by the crowd! They could look into increasing the area if possible! The service was quick and efficient. U can ask for their suggestion if you face any confusion while ordering! Most of the waiters were experienced and well behaved! They surely knew how to make their customers happy!
Go to this place if you wanna have matchless experience in Chinese Cuisine, specially Pork Preparations!!

The first thing which is coming to my mind is Costly, or may be super costly. This is one of the very old traditionally Chinese restaurant in Kolkata. 
With my wife, we thought trying Jimmy's Kitchen near Kala Mandir, 
After counting on the prices, we thought of sticking to the basic, thus ordered 
Mixed Fried Rice - 220 (not sufficient quantity)
Mongolian Chicken - 280 for 7 to 8 shredded pieces

They were both ok, but nothing exceptional, to mention but definitely costly. Honestly I've tasted much better Fried Rice and Chicken in my life. So nothing there to write further.

Jimmy's Kitchen is an old is gold. Being one of the most reputed restaurant of Kolkata since yester years. 
A small restaurant without any parking with hardly 5 tables. We ordered;-
1. Chicken Sweet Corn Soup- Awesome creamy sweet corn soup. Enjoyed may be after a year or so. Simply delightful..
2. Mixed Fried Rice- The extremely well cooked mixed fried rice with a perfect blend of pork in it. The fried rice has a burnt flavor... Simply loved it !!!
3. Chilli Fish (Dry)- The most worthless Chilli Fish I have ever had. 0.5 marks is deducted for the same.
4. Some Chicken Item- Good one... !!

The prices are on a higher side. Chicken items cost Rs 200 plus but only 4 pieces.

Even after that, its recommended ...!!!

Where to begin! I have been going to this restaurant years after years! It was like my safest bet for Chinese food. This place existed even before the famous Mainland China was born and people in Kolkata loved this eatery for the taste of food it kept providing year on year.Situated near the hotspot of Kolkata called New Market, it is very difficult to get seats on weekend and on festive time shopping like Durga Puja or Christmas. Visited Jimmy's after ages! Coming back to my city for few days, I always want to revisit my early days here. Small space, few good food, and average hospitality...that is the current status quo of Jimmy's Kitchen. They need to improve on certain areas..seems like it is likely to fall from the grace it has been enjoying for long! Their soups are my all time favourite. If i am in the New Market area and my stomach is full with all the famous street food there I still manage to sneak in to this place for a bowl of soup. Thier all time fav is fried rice and chilli chicken and of course the drums of heaven. 

You might find it a tad too expensive compared to the chinese restaurants in China Town, also their quantity is not that great. Would prefer if they keep up with the changing food scenario in Kolkata. Will always love this place though for making my tongue savour the first taste of good chinese food.

This is 1 of the oldest Chinese Restaurant in Kolkata. Written in Yellow bold letters on a bright red board cannot be missed on AJC Bose Road. It is a full Family Restaurant cum bar. The interior is nothing wow, it is a small room with max 30 sitting arrangement. Mostly families come in the noon and opposite sex in the evening as it serves alcohol. The ambiance keeps changing according to the kind of people comes in. The waiters were not at all cooperative. They did not give us suggestions. Even after we asked them about their specialty they were least bothered in replying and taking orders and were more interested in watching football match.

They serve non oriental style Chinese food. I had tried Crispy Spring Roll, Chicken Prawn Fried Rice, Hot garlic Chicken and Special Hakka Noodles. They don’t compromise with their quantity at all. 1 plate of noodles/rice would be sufficient for two people. The food was nothing special. I recommend Crispy Spring Roll. It was not very oily, and was very tasty. The chicken prawn fried rice and the special Hakka noodles were alright. It wasn't mouth watering. The Hot garlic Chicken was ordered as semi gravy but when that was served it was too sour, watery and runny, very oily and the quantity was less. 

The price were little higher than the standard of food they had served us.

Bon Appétit!!

0.5 extra for being a heritage chinese restaurant and also I need to check the other items. I have wanted to come here from more than a decade back, as I used to have some food delivered in The Assembly Of God Hospital while I was working there. That experience was very good. This time I went just after the Puja holidays and didn't find the experience droolworthy. 

Otherwise strictly no frills chinese with authentic items. I had Chilli roast pork and Chinese Chopsuey- at the recommendation of server and they were okay. Not superb. Hatari was way more tasty in my book for the pork dish.

These guys do Serve very fast and seemed knowledgeable too.

Not much of an ambience to talk about and has normal bright lights with usual chinese decor. Seating space is less but not congested.

Pricing seemed a bit high as every main dish is above Rs. 250 or above. As it's not a fine dining place. In fact the floor space is pretty less.

Many better chinese restaurants have cropped up in the city and this place may only be visited for it's history and heritage. 

Parking is on the main AJC bose rd and it might be an issue sometimes. Somehow this kitchen has lost it's halcyon days and it is obvious.

Old school chinese resturant.. has been there at the corner of shakesphere sarani for a long time. The chopsuy, cantonese noodles and hot garlic chicken are my favourites. If you plan to have a soup, surely try the sweer corn chicken soup. The prawn and shrimp dishes are delicious as well. The ambience is good and the waiters are courteous unless you happen to get intoxicated with alcahol!

To begin with, I am referring to the one on Theater Road/Shakespeare Sarani and AJC Bose Road intersection, between Beck Bagan crossing and Malik Bazar crossing. This is the "vintage" Jimmy's Kitchen; and the one our whole family loves. Ambiance is nice, service is quick and good, prices are reasonable. Last visited on October 2, 2014 - the prices have gone up a little. To give you an idea - Veg Hakka chow is INR 180, Boneless Chilli Chicken with gravy is INR 310, Crispy Chicken (spicy not honey) is INR 310, Mandarin Fish is INR 330, Fish Finger is INR 380, Veg Fried Rice is INR 170, without taxes. Delicious food, and my special recommendation is for the Mandarin Fish , Crispy Chicken (spicy), and Fish Finger. Also, though, we didn't try it this time - the Golden Fried Prawn is not to be missed!

Have you ever felt that today;s chinese joints dont smell Chinese!!! I always feel it even in mainland china! But this is one joint where the smell of authentic sauces still lingers on. The best god damn cantonese chinese is available here and you cannot, just cannot, ignore this joint which is is still stuck in time and serves some amazing food.

You cannot miss Jimmy's Kitchen. This place stands out in bright yellow and red branding. Very boldly the name reads Jimmy's Kitchen. 30 - 35 SEATER restaurant right at the corner of the street. Serves decent quantity food. This is a family restaurant. But you might find the opposite sex members more because of the cheap booze. I had tried their Hakka noodles and chilli chicken. Very basic in taste nothing very yummy. They give good quantity. The ambiance of the hotel is quiet basic, it depends on the crowd . SO it will vary. Waiters don't give much of suggestion.  Have heard about their Pork recipes but I was not lucky enough to have it. May be next time !!!

Finally got to visit this place yesterday. We were a bunch of 7 people who wanted to get drunk and have some food. At 6pm we entered the place. The seating capacity is not huge but as it just early evening we managed to accommodate ourselves. Ordered a hell lot of a drinks along with some starters. The chilli roast pork was a standout. The veg dishes like the fried baby corn, veg manchurian were not up to the mark. The price of the drinks were reasonable too. The staff was quite patient and friendly as they patiently bore with our cacophony. Pocket pinch was 5600rs. Overall a great experience.

The restaurant is situated at the crossing of Theatre road and APC Road , near Kala Mandir.
My all time favourite is Fried Chilly chicken boneless, this is simply awsome with those green chillies.
All the other dishes are equally good, specially singaporean meifoon. The bar is also well stocked.
The place is a bit on a smaller side but the service is prompt and courteous. Usually it's very crowded in the evening.A good place to grab a quick bite as well , as you also get sandwiches etc. One of my old time favourites.
You get good chinese here in affordable price.

Try the Chilli Roast Pork here, it is awesommmmeeeeeee. Had been here coincidentally. While returning from a stand up comedy show at Kalamandir (which is nearby) we were hungry like hell, and it was raining too. So we decided to check out this normal looking chinese outlet. To be honest, I had heard about Jimmy's Kitchen before but never got the chance to try out ourselves. But finally we got this chance. We wanted to try some lamb or pork (since we are bored of our daily chicken or goat) and had to try the chilli roast pork and some mixed fried rice. Both the options tasted nice. The pork being especially awesome. I would not mind going back there for some more of that.

This will always remain my favourite destination for Chinese food. Have been visiting this restaurant since childhood and i do not find much change in the quality and taste of the food. It has been consistent all through. I love the pork dishes here... they are so soft that they melt in your mouth specially the chilly pork.  The noodles and the rice items are to die for as they have a special aroma and flavour of their own. The ambience of the place has undergone a biti of a change and that has enhanced its look. A perfect place when you ahave a craving for delicious chinese food in Kolkata.

I have eaten here just once based on my mother's recommendation and boy was it a treat! We were attending a school fest at Kala Mandir and wanted to eat lunch. The prices were high for school-boys but fests come once a  year right! We ordered noodles, fried rice and chili chicken and three boys with voracious appetites were satisfied. The taste of the fried rice, noodles and chicken were all special and I can still recall the pure satisfaction we had had upon eating the meal. I have never had the opportunity to eat there againbut I guess I shall make it a point to have lunch in Jimmys Kitchen when I pass by that area in the afternoon in the near future.

A great place for everyone, family, Gen X, Gen Y almost everyone who's fond of some awesome non-oriental style Chinese food (PS every calcuttan loves that). The chilly chicken and chilly garlic chicken actually adds/enhances the beer's flavour. The extra chillies with the chilly chicken opens up every single taste bud and makes u drool for more beer... :-P
The ambience is very old Calcutta and feels great anytime of the day. 
Price is medium.
Service is good.
This is not for people who are into authentic Chinese food but a must visit for the rest..

An old timer in this part of town, Jimmy's Kitchen has been there for ages. It now primarily caters to the drinking crowd, though you do see families sitting down for meals too.

The food is mostly well done. I particularly liked the Chilli Pork. It has probably gone down in terms of quality over last many years, but that is not surprising. They do have a varied menu, and service is reasonably fast. You will not be disappointed with the food, but with the atmosphere and the kind of interiors, you would be left wondering what you paid so much for.

As you enter this place you find yourself inside a small room with 8 -9 tables which looks a bit cramped up. Coming to the service it was bit slow as we had to call the waiters to take down the order for us. Since I was accompanied by a friend who is veg my order was vegetarian throughout.

veg hot n sour soup : The soup was good and tangy.
Veg chilli garlic noodles: Nothing great , it was not spicy as the waiter had told us.
veg manchurian ; an average dish which.

Overall the experience was average. I feel the prices are on the higher side. Maybe the non veg dishes are better than veg which I need to try, cause the veg dishes are totally not worth the price.

If u r a real food lover then u must visit here for a life time just taste the pork items. I think this is one of the best option for pork dishes with well ambiance and higher price than other pork eateries in the city. I have tried their most of the pork dishes and they are just superb with quality but u may not happy with quantity but u dont feel hurt just due to their taste and  quality. I never feel any discomfort after having very heavy pork meals even in mid summer. So whenever I think about pork it is jimmy`s kitchen. Only disadvantage is seating arrangement it is really very short but it cant resist you.But sadly i say some people goes only once or two in busy evenings think they over priced and dont look after the quality I again request them to visit once again in around 1pm.

I was there for Chinese. I ordered Singaporean mixed meifoon, which I found terrific. The serving had enough egg scramble slices, prawns, pork and chicken slices. Taste was good, the quantity was good as well. It costed around Rs 260 without taxes. The air conditioning was decent but little noisy ,although the decor was decent. The overall ambience was Ok. All of it went down really well with a glass of beer. Just that this place isn't very spacious and I felt claustrophobic every time I looked around. Long story short, if around, its a decent place to eat at, for Ok prices compared to similar eateries.

Do you need a good joint to meet and greet with colleagues and work-friends? 

Do you need a place where you would be served with the order lightning fast?

Consequently, these apart, another question came in to my mind!

Do you need a bleeding in your purse? 

If all the above answers are yes, I request you to be in Jimmy's kitchen. This place is no doubt expensive to a great extent! Although I like Jimmy's Kitchen for its location, the slow ambiance inside it amid the express serving of the dishes! It does not possess a luxury quality atmosphere, but good for an after work chill out with beer. You really don't need to wait much and you can carry on eating occupying a table for even more than 3 hours! 

Now about the food, it is good, not great, I would say. And you could try the Chinese style fish finger, chili roast pork and fried ginger chicken. These three are my personal favorites, while I like most of their dishes. On a sad note, I can’t visit a lot as it always pokes a hole in my wallet!

2.7 average rating for Jimmy's Kitchen. You gotta be kidding me. This place rocks. The sign on the outside has all the old world charm. I love that signboard. The inside has been upholstered and has a bit of a modern touch. The waiters continue to wear the same uniforms and their warmth and friendliness haven't gone anywhere. The decor is just about decent and the seating arrangement is comfortable enough. The food is just like any other Indianised Chinese restaurant in town. Yet at the same time just like any other Chinese restaurant in town there is a somehow a distinction of flavours and taste. The food here is good. The quantity for today's standards and at the prices that they charge is quite generous as well. This place deserves higher rating points only because of the food that they serve. My sister who used to reside abroad made it a point to come to Jimmy's Kitchen whenever she was in town and she is the one who is responsible for introducing me to this place. She knew about my love and obsession with pork and suggested that I try the mixed fried rice and sweet and sour pork. The greasy fried rice just blew me away. There was a hint of smoky flavour to it and the sweet and sour pork was so delectably succulent. Our second time we tried the golden fried prawns which were fantastic and the roast chilly pork. The pork was really hot and spicy as we expected it to be.  This sealed it. This was surely the beginning of my love affair with Jimmy's Kitchen. I will keep going back. Again and again.

I was thoroughly dissapointed.Quality of food was not up to the mark,worst part was that the chicken noodles i ordered had stale chicken in it which was very evident from the smell from the dish.Those beside our table had the same complain about the chicken served that day.But the waitors just did not pay any heed to what we had to say.I understand that some days could be bad for a restaurant in tetms of food but they should have ackowledged the fact that the dish was giving a foul smell.So just paid the bill and left empty stomach.Service is very bad.

This is a very old place and it has a no. of outlets all over the city. 
The place is dimly lit and the ambience is appealing enough. 
Coming to the food, yes it's good. 
However, funnily, if you order a sizzler you've to order a rice or noodles as well because the sizzler they serve is just vegetables :P
It is averagely priced, however the quality of food doesn't do justice with the prices since they've better restaurants in the area with low prices. 

In short, if you're looking for some decent Chinese food and the money is not your criteria- you can drop in here and you'll not be disappointed. :)

Very old and well known Chinese food joint, Food is tasty and though ambience is not very good, but, not very bad either. Fried chilli chicken, roast chilli pork and noodles (cantonese or hakka style) are pretty good. Definitely, you can try this place, they have not changed them with time (specially in decor and service, you can not think of fine dining service here), but, they still make good yummy food which is really worth trying.

I have one word for jimmy kitchen. Its just too over priced and the food is not up to the mark at all these days. At one time i would visit regularly on weekends but these the food is yuck. The chowmein is tasteless, in fact i told the chinese manager that his food was rather lousy. He just pretended that he did not listen to me. Hopeless and worth less food needs loads of improvement.

SIMPLE FOOD @ JIMMY'S KITCHEN (AJC BOSE ROAD)!
3 out of 5

Jimmy's Kitchen evokes mixed reactions amongst people. Yet it is still a name to reckon with for authentic Chinese delicacies. With regards to their decor, it hasn't undergone any change and remains much the same. The menu is very commonplace with no new items. Yet the food is delicious and scrumptious. The service is as usual quick and efficient; you do not have to wait too long for your food.

Their signature dish, which is the wonderfully prepared cha shao or roast pork, is still the most sought after dish from this old establishment. The dish is wonderfully made with the meat mixed in the right amount of spices and salt. The meat pieces are tender and juicy with the very expecting glossy and shiny red glaze on the outside. The roast pork is not only soft and succulent but sweet as well. The chicken preparations are amazing too. At times, the chicken dishes might prove to be too spicy for those expecting authentic Chinese fare that is non-spicy. Nevertheless, some of their chicken dishes that need mentioning in this review are Chilli chicken (dry), Honey chicken, and Chicken Chowmein. Apparently, their lemon chicken is well prepared and uses the right amount of lemon pieces though I have not tried it. 

Similarly, the noodle soup is still prepared in the same old manner with an adequate amount of vegetables, meat and noodles. The dish is light and delightfully tasty and enough for a person's meal! 

The major drawback here is that the food can be quite expensive here, considering the food quality (certain dishes might prove to be too greasy) and quantity and a meal can set you back Rs.450 a head or more. Nevertheless, the food is still considered by many loyalists to be the best and authentic in the whole of Kolkata (not my sentiments, though it is pretty decent fare).

It was after a long day I entered Jimmy's kitchen to pack away a couple of things for me and my sister. I decided on the chicken chow mien and roast pork (char sieu). For those who are unaware, Jimmy's Kitchen is one of the few restaurants in Kolkata which still makes an authentic char sieu, with the red glaze outside, and tender pork cut against the grain to make it more tender. My order was placed at 9.05 and it was delivered within 9.20, and the service was super fast but polite. While waiting, I asked for a diet coke, and it came immediately, with a glass and on request, big chunks of ice. The service was casual, but attentive. 

The pork was amazing, with the right amount of sweetness and juiciness to it, and even after half an hour, perfect. It was not greasy. This is recommended to people who are hardcore lover of pork, and it is one of their signature dishes. The chicken chowmien was perfectly cooked, but the only glitch was that the chicken was not tossed with the chow, but rather thrown on the top, which for me was not a good thing. However, it was still delicious. 

Albeit expensive, I would say that the chow and pork would easily serve two people (as it did to us), and that makes this place good enough for me.

Jimmy's Kitchen is a good chinese restaurant but the prices of the food items are really costly....for example, the chilly chicken(boneless) is itself Rs.255.food quality is average,,nothing great. 
Ambience is simple and staff is okay. Pork is also available here. The Crispy Chicken is delectable and also the Honey chicken. I disliked the Chilly Fish. The other dishes are tasty too.
I would rate 2.5

Once Upon a time one of Calcutta's best Chinese restaurant was Jimmy's Kitchen. While growing up in the 90's I remember going for regular dinners with my parents for Chinese food which is  close as to its origin but modified a bit to suit Indian taste buds which love things on the light side and looked forward to the weekly visits. Their Roast Pork was soft succulent with the perfect amount of salt and spices. The Mein Foon was non greasy and had loads of vegetables and meat. The soups were enough for 2 adults. The chicken preparations were marvelous. While their decor remains the same which is a comfort to old patrons the quantity of food has unfortunately rapidly gone downhill. The soup is barely enough for 1 person. The noodles would be right for two ladies who want a light bite. The quality for people who like Chinese food on the light side is unsatisfactory. Their once non greasy noodles are now dripping in oil. Their Lemon Chicken is still the best with the correct amount of lemons. The Chili Roast Pork swims in a pond of oil but is tasty nevertheless if one has it as a new variant of cuisine which once had its source in our neighbouring country. The prices on the other hand have gone uphill and considering the quantity and quality it does not give value for money. What is still special about the restaurant are the memories of having seen it in its good old days and the fact that even with all their flaws they still serve Chinese food much better than 90% of the other restaurants in Calcutta. So while it is a letdown for people who knew it in its glory as a new guest the restaurant would be moderately satisfactory. The one dish which still gets a rating of 10 out of 10 is their Noodle Soup which is perfect with lots of vegetables and meat and noodles and light and delicious. So do drop in for their delicious noodle soup.

Last weekend I again had the misfortune of going to Jimmy's kitchen for Dinner as we did not get a place to park anywhere at Park Street. The food is really pathetic and the service horrendous. The waiters simply tilt the portion bowl and push the food to help it slide down on to your plate. AAaggggh. Why can't Mr Jimmy teach his staff  proper way to serve food from Platter to plate.

The food at Jimmy's is reasonable priced. That's the only thing good I can say about the place. The staff is obnoxious. The service pathetic to say the least. The food is very Indian tasting Chinese... at times overpowering Soya in all dishes. Crockery cutlery being used very down market. Avoid.

Great place for authentic Kolkata style chinese cuisine. However on this New Year (2013) we as a family decided to visit the New Market branch. The ambience is the same, the waiters are friendly, however we were disapointed with the dishes which had prawns in it. The first bite of prawn/shrimp in American Chopsuey turned me off, it was not cleaned properly or was not good. However the waiters were prompt to serve dishes without prawns. The price is still quite reasonable compare to some other fancy resturants which musroomed recently in Kolkata, and the quantity of food is good, (for us a couple) one plate is enough, however we miss the old cutleries specially the soup bouls and dishes which is now replaced with ordinay shabby stuff. Great place for good food, not dining experiance though. Well what you get what you pay, not too cheap place nor very expensive place for dining.   Avoid dishes with shrimps or prawns.

Still a good, clean and reasonable place to eat, but avoid dishes with prawns. after years we went as a family went for New Years lunch at Jimmy's New Market branch. Found the cutleries have degraded, the service was not that bad. But the first bite of prawns turned us off. However the staff was very efficient to replace the dish without the prawns. I will not say avoid but if you are looking for a reasonable place to eat(not dininig experiance) this is one of the best one still around in Kolkata.

Went to the AJC Bose Road branch of this place twice about 6 years ago and was appalled by the lousy service and mediocre food. Never felt like going back again.

The New Market branch however, is excellent and i've only had good experiences there. Everything i've ordered off the menu has been good. The cha siao (pork roast) gets a special mention. 

Also, the vegetarian options are varied and not buffered by disgusting overdoses of cornflower. 

The beers are also kept at a very good temperature!

To be honest, the place has lost its charm. It once used to be good, but standards have fallen drastically. Although, I feel, the outlet near New Market is slightly better than this.

Its much higher than 400 for two persons! No specialities in the menu. Not a place to watch out for but if there is no other choice available it can be tried out. The chicken dishes are way too spicy and the main course is limited. Strictly for the office workers around the place and not at all a dine out.
