Located in prime location of top floor of city centre 1 with a majestic view of the whole city. Huge area wonderfully decorated with very simple minimalist furnitures and lightings. I went there for the buffet at the price of 749 and I couldn't have been more happy. A wide spread of dishes and each tastes as good as the other. Be it veg or non veg each dish is very tasty. Ambience is wonderful. Commendable service ànd very very courteous staff.

We visited Afraa lounge on a sunday evening. The ambience apparently was good but after sitting sometimes in a two sitter table we realised that the surrounding was smelling of pee. Well, aparently the AC wasnt switched on and the problem disappeared after switching it on. Moving on to dishes, we ordered 3 aantŕés, one fish n chips, one dry chilli chicken and one chicken wings. the fish fillet of the fish and chips, literally tested of vineger all over it. It was so sour, we could easily feed it to a pickle craving pregnant woman. The fish was dry. For this horrible dish, we had to pay over nine hundred rupees which was outrageous. then came the dry chilli chicken. we had to pay around 460 rupees for 7 little pieces of chicken. I am sure any roadside restaurant can serve a tasty dry chilli chicken in one-fourth the price. It is not worth to pay quadriple the price just for the ambience. The spicy chicken wings was the last thing in the menu. I was wondering how many killos of corn flour went into making of the batter for the chickens. it felt like they store frozen battered chicken wings after frying them once. And serve it with frying in another 1 or 2 batter coats. The taste was not at all appropriate for a well-reputed restaurant like that. the only 2 and .5 stars are for the service and stuff behaviour. I will not recommend to anyone unless he has money to waste...

If you like multiple options but with average food quality then Afraa can be considered once.
Tried their buffet lunch (749 +Tax) and honestly speaking it was a let down. Less options for starters, main course was above average but desert was a big let down. I won't be over critical but at 749 you would expect fantastic quality which sadly is not the case here. Ambiance is good, so one can visit the place if vanity is your middle name but for genuine foodies it's not your ideal meal hault.

Afraa is definitely the most underrated buffet places in Calcutta. Very few places serve Chicken(more than one recipe), Prawn, Mutton and Fish all in their buffet on a regular basis. The dessert section is strong with their tedious choice of tarts. The A-La-Carte is blistered with excellent food but with a higher tag. If quality is what you seek, then Afraa should be definitely on your list.

Afraa Restaurant and Lounge is the best place to visit to have great delicious food. I have visited the Afraa Restaurant many times and tasted amazing food. On the new year yesterday I had visited Afraa again with my friends and they too were equally happy like me. 
All the staffs are extremely well mannered and disciplined. Mr Sujoy Dey has been always extremely helpful and nice in organising the great food served to us and he personally makes sure that all my guests are very happy. A MUST VISIT RESTAURANT FOR ALL THE FOOD LOVERS FOR THE AMAZINGLY TASTY FOOD😀😀😀😀😀

Went for new year's buffet lunch at afraa with family.. The ambiance is classy and provides a nice view from the 7th floor. The salad spread was awesome... Loved them.. The cold cuts, cheeses.. Display was also beautiful. There was a nice soup and unlimited mocktails included in the buffet. The mains section had a nice array.. Loved a spinach and corn stuffed quesidilas(?)..it was my fav item along with prawn wrapped in batter and fried. The main section had lobster thermidor, grilled fish. And rum flavoured mutton along with many other items. The dessert section had few choices.. Plum pudding, yule log, rasogolla, christmas cake, a souffle and fresh fruits.

If you are vegetarian, it’s a perfect place to be in. And if you are non vegetarian than you are going to enjoy your food to the next level.
Weather you order from al-carte or try the buffet, the service remains the same. I can Say with surety the service which you get afraa can’t be compared with any other restaurant in Kolkata. The servers are perfect. My server was Sujoy, he was excellent.
The most amazing dish are panner tikka, lasagna, Mongolian.

Been there on 25th Dec to celebrate Christmas with my husband. It was the first time for me to visit Afraa and believe me, this place is just amazing. The place was decorated nicely and the food spread was just awesome. We choose to have for the buffet and it cost 1099AI for each of us. Little bit of high pricing but can compromise it with the food they served. Great food, nice ambiance and efficient management. Overall like the place very much and surely visit again.

One of the lavish  buffet spread in town. Lovely decoration, great quality food & skillful stuffs. What you want more? In such a low price tag (749 AI for weekdays & 999AI for weekend), I thing you should definitely visit this restaurant again.

Located at city center 1 this place has won my heart!!! I mean even the waiting area is so breathtakingly beautiful!!! With so much open space and a great view of the city life one literally feels like "Life is Good!"
The decor is mostly in white , being true to it's name.Very tastefully done.Simple yet pouring with class and elegance.
Coming to the food, started with the monk soup with added condiments ,I normally don't go for the soup when I am trying a buffet.But I am so happy I did not miss this one!Simply delicious.
Next ,the cheese section,i was impressed with the variety of cheese and bread to accompany with.And each one of them were too notch.
Cold cuts of chicken and pork were next.Tried simply all of them!!! Nothing to complain!!!Man I am getting hungry again writing the review!
Next was the salad section,I could try much from this section but the dips I tried made me drool!!!They were so delicious!!!I could have a pot full of those!
With an almost full stomach I headed towards the main course and starters....well the best starter among all those delicious ones was the Murgh Tikka bites!!!Simply the best starter I tasted!!!
From the main course, The Prawn Thermidor was tooooo delicious!!!wish I was not so full,else could have had some more! And also ordered a cheese kulcha which was simply so warm , gooey and tasty I simply couldn't stop at one slice!The salmon and mutton dishes were good too.
From the live section I got pizza cones and spinach ravioli in white sauce.I loved the pizza cones!
And of course!!!My first roast turkey!!!Opted for the cranberry sauce!!!Ooolala!!!!Just awesome!
And lastly went to the desert section,the ice cream was simply heartwarming!!!There were several others like plum cake,sandesh,pastries ,nolen gur rosogolla,etc.
And Blue Lagoon was the drink I opted for with several refills.
The non veg buffet costed 1100rs AI.
The service was very prompt and the servers and chefs super courteous.
Would love to visit again!
HappyEating!

First review starting from this great place. Visited for the Christmas Buffet here with family and loved every dish. The array of spread was huge and included everything one expects in a buffet; the cold cuts just won my heart, the dessert section was huge with various types of cakes like plum and fruits, mihidana, nolen gur er rosogolla and ice cream too.

The buffet was priced at 1099rs including all. Every penny spent was worth here. Interiors are done very beautifully suiting the absolute aura of this place.

Best of luck Team Afraa Lounge and Restaurant; will be visiting soon.

Located in the side of the main hotspot in salt lake, City Centre, Afraa can be deceptive with their cafe in front. But the main watering hole is inside as you reach the 7th floor and arrive at the fine dining extravaganza that is Afraa. We celebrated our parents 30th wedding anniversary with a dinner there on Christmas day, indulging our widespread palate. 

Initially, we ordered a betki piccata and a non veg platter. The betki piccata was wonderful to taste through the sauce could have been better applied, with the shallow dipping leaving the dish a bit dry. The non veg platter was heaven on the tongue as the galawati kebab, despite an innocuous appearance proved to be the highlight as it melted in our mouth. Fish tikka was delicious while Coconut rubbed chicken and fried pawns lived up to their repute. For our main course, we divided it into something exotic and something more at home. Thai green curry chicken paired up with steamed rice, while panner makhani was taken with kulcha. The chicken curry did disappoint, as the thin gravy and dull taste of the chicken was sadly not a good complement to the rice. But the paneer was excellent, as I was tempted to ask for another serving instead of the chicken. The kulcha was fresh and plump, and with the paneer makhana was heaven on a plate. Sea food risotto was the X-factor dish of the dinner – and while the calamari and prawns were excellent, the risotto itself didn’t live up to expectation. 

Coming to the ambience, Afraa reflects the fine dining experience well. Sparkling wine glasses and beautifully crafted plates lent to an exquisite decor, as we were given quick and proper service. The washroom through deserves an expansion, depending on requirement. The waiters were well versed in the menu and provided excellent recommendations. Despite the pricing being on the higher side as per quantity, we were well satisfied with the experience and more....definitely merits a revisit!

Had a Christmas Eve dinner at this place with friends and families - total of 10 people. One of the WORST EXPERIENCE ever. The starters were pathetically cold, food on the buffet was stale, the hot pasta was tasteless and the desserts were not inspiring at all. Don’t understand why should they advertise a Christmas Eve dinner when they can’t make a good meal. I came from Hong Kong to spend time with friends and families and regret why I chose this place.  Deeply hurt how the reviews for this place seems to be fabricated by them to continue to attract the crowd and fleece them. Anyway for me this name is a complete no no for the rest of my life.

Located on the 7th floor, beside the CC1. With huge sitting arrangement, the place is perfect place also to celebrate your special occasion. The stuffs are very helpful and courteous.

When it comes about food, they had a wide spread of buffet menu as well as A la Carte menu with full of dish from different continental. The desserts section was quiet awesome also. The price of the buffet is reasonable also. It is only 999AI for Sunday brunch buffet and 749AI for the other day.

So do visit this restaurant & I'll surely visit this restaurant again.

We went for a weekday lunch buffet. The restro being on the 7th floor overlooks the surrounding areas and offer a splendid view. The spread of the buffet was overall comprehensive. However, in my opinion the starter section needs some improvement in variety. The salads were fresh and vibrant, cold cuts were nice. In the main course, fish in cilantro sauce worked best for me. The mutton dish was a bit high on salt which was annoying for the palate. The deserts could have been a little better, but given the price point, it was satisfactory. Overall a nice experience.

Afraa can synonym with class.. Indeed a perfect chic ambience to hangout with friends and family. To me it's a perfect place to unwind. The food and beverages couldn't have been better right from ingredients, texture and plating its 10 on 10..The brunch platter has wide range of variation to offer and each is equally tasty. Nothing too much spicy, just right to encourage you to endeavour more of the mouth watering delicacies.

My favourites being :

1)Salami soaked in olive oil, it tastes heavenly.. just a bite is enough to loose your blues.

2)Red Apple spinach with Red Wine Vinegerret is another refreshing addition to the platter, freshly cut apple and spinach in a sweet and slightly tangy dressing.

3)Pork cold cuts were yummy and soft.

4)Brown Onion and Peas pulao is light on your tastebuds yet tasty.. Doesn't make you full yet its fulfilling.

5)Cottage cheese and corn florentine has a bulk of creaminess to it and the mild spices just cuts through. One of the tastiest dishes from the array.

6)Prawn Primevera is the star of the show. Creamy non spicy dish which fills your mouth the sweetness of fresh prawn meat. Can't help myself to more helpings.

7)Dhuyen ka gosht korma is for mutton lovers like me.. savour the softness of mutton while the gravy does wonder to the rice accompanied with it.

8)Orange and basil ice cream was unique and wonderful, nothing like I have tasted before. A must try!

9)Assorted tarts were a fantastic end to the culinary journey mentioned below.

They have both outdoor and indoor seating arrangement up on the 6th and 7th floors of City Center. From high up there even the unfinished metro lines look beautiful. The food is good by and large. We had the light lemon Caesar salad with lightly grilled tandoori chicken and sun-dried tomatoes. It was pretty good. We were served a bread basket with a mustard-mayo dip. It was average, not great. We shared the Afraa mixed meat grill between ourselves later. That was one huge platter with different kinds of meat, fish and prawn if you choose. It is really quite good and has something in it for everybody. One of our friends did not want to eat anything, so she munched on a few of the french fries from the platter. We had the Afraa lip lock,which is basically coke with a hint of ginger and added chopped gingers, to drink. We all really liked the drink, though perhaps it would have been better if the gingers were more finely chopped. For dessert we chose the Afraa signature oozing dark chocolate cake. It is chocolate cake with some amount of coconut in it. I liked it but most of my pals were not quite so appreciative. Although honestly speaking, the phrase "oozing dark chocolate" in the name of the dish is an outright lie.

The waiters are courteous, the service is fairly prompt. The prices are a little on the high side, but totally worth it.

Afraa can synonym with class.. Indeed a perfect chic ambience to hangout with friends and family. To me it's a perfect place to unwind. The food and beverages couldn't have been better right from ingredients, texture and plating its 10 on 10..The brunch platter has wide range of variation to offer and each is equally tasty. Nothing too much spicy, just right to encourage you to endeavour more of the mouth watering delicacies.

My favourites being :

1)Salami soaked in olive oil, it tastes heavenly.. just a bite is enough to loose your blues.

2)Red Apple spinach with Red Wine Vinegerret is another refreshing addition to the platter, freshly cut apple and spinach in a sweet and slightly tangy dressing.

3)Pork cold cuts were yummy and soft.

4)Brown Onion and Peas pulao is light on your tastebuds yet tasty.. Doesn't make you full yet its fulfilling.

5)Cottage cheese and corn florentine has a bulk of creaminess to it and the mild spices just cuts through. One of the tastiest dishes from the array.

6)Prawn Primevera is the star of the show. Creamy non spicy dish which fills your mouth the sweetness of fresh prawn meat. Can't help myself to more helpings.

7)Dhuyen ka gosht korma is for mutton lovers like me.. savour the softness of mutton while the gravy does wonder to the rice accompanied with it.

8)Orange and basil ice cream was unique and wonderful, nothing like I have tasted before. A must try!

9)Assorted tarts were a fantastic end to the culinary journey mentioned below.

Cucumber stick with mint youghurt

Visited this restaurant long back. It has been 4 to 5 years. And honestly speaking was not happy with the taste and experience at that time. But recently saw some amazing reviews, most importantly the consistent great reviews tempted my to visit it one more time.

So, as decided we decided to have their Sunday Brunch. Which includes unlimited hard drinks, unlimited cocktail, unlimited mocktail with unlimited food and that is in a Whistling 999 INR + Tax.

Location:
___________

It is located in CC1. In the same building, where the Afraa Deli is there in ground floor. This restaurant is on the 7 th floor.

Ambiance:
______________

The ambiance of the restaurant is just superb. The wine glass used to serve the water. The simple and neat presentation was just amazing. And yes the most catchings part is the waiting zone. It's a smoking zone also. The view from there and sitting there is just a superb experience altogether.

Now coming to the most exciting portion. Food.

As I mentioned there was unlimited drinks. And this portion was really amazing.

Note : hard drinks will be not that great. You can not even ask that quality of pure hard drink in the buffet :)

✓ Vodka Orange Cocktail - amazing one.
✓ whiskey orange Cocktail - nice one.
✓ Mojito - cocktail based. Amazing.
✓ Blue Laggonn - on the sweeter side. Tasted nice.
✓ virgin mojito - superb one. The best one on that day I felt.

The overall experience was grand. And what can you asked such good food and drink in just 999 plus tax.

And in between our dining some time we were out in the waiting zone, to take some break. So, on the Sunday - such amazing food, with close friend and family - you can not ask for more.

After the visit , after nearly 5 years my perspective of this restaurant has been totally changed.

To Management:

You guys are doing just amazing. And thanks for just the superb experience we had.

To All:

You can go for buffet there on any weekday. But I would say go for Sunday Brunch one. They will hijack you with the grand experience, amazing food and drink.

And till my next food adventure, happy fooding.

Ambience is lavish and classy, one can enjoy being here for hours and hours obviously accompanied with extremely delectable dishes.

We went here for a buffet lunch yesterday. The ambiance and decor of this restaurant is pleasing. The staffs are polite and well-coordinated.
More than sufficient menus were there for the selection of food. Some of the food items were really delicious, however, some of them were not up to the mark. Both the veg and non-veg starters were good. The fish item from the main course was amazingly delicious. We didn't find the mutton item as freshly-cooked preparation. The pizza was very stiff. The other main-course items were average kind. I was disappointed with the dessert part. The pastry was very dry and not good in taste. They should keep kulfi or ice-cream as dessert.
It is excellently a budget-friendly restaurant for buffet meal. Only suggestion for them is if they could keep freshly prepared food items.

Visited last Sunday with two other families.. this place used to be my favourite since the start but quality of service has drastically deteriorated .. had to wait for 20 mins for a drink .. being fine dining and the prices being abnormally high for drinks the feel is absent .. u can’t serve a scotch in royal challenge glass.. hated that part.. soda not being served in decanters but in pet bottles .. same with soft drinks.. how is fine dining ? I mean this is like no experience.. food in bits and pieces were good  ..The chops and fish kebabs were good but the chilly blast which were my favourite were just about ok and neither the noodles excited any of us.. I would really like the old experience to be back or else I’m not coming here. At least in near future .. thanks

Located at the 7th Floor  of CC1 offers great view of Salt Lake. The decor & ambiance is really nice with spacious sitting arrangements. I went for Sunday Brunch with my girlfriend. The staffs are very  polite & courteous, special mention Mr. Sujay who treated us very well. He took care of every minute details & even helped me click some snaps with my gf. He also suggested some mocktails & cocktails which were super refreshing and nicely done. Some of the chocolate based desserts were exhausted by the time my gf went for them but to compensate that he even arranged a special chocolate cake for her, that's really a nice gesture I must say!!!  No doubt this the best hospitality that I have experienced till date. Looking forward to visit for a candlelight dinner soon.
Thanks team...keep up the great service.

Ordered the lunch buffet last to last Sunday and was simply wowed by the variety of the spread. From cheese and cold meat to lamb shank and mutton. At just about Rs. 1000, the buffet was simply a steal. Awesome food and awesome value. Specially liked the many different types of cheese and the lamb shank. Plus there was one unlimited drink. Now how many could you have over lunch? :-) And last but not the least was the behaviour and professionalism of the staff. A must visit place for Sunday lunch/brunch for sure in Kolkata.

I have given the total point to this restaurant it's roof top ambience. One can view whole Kolkata from it's rooftop. You can enjoy having snacks with a beautiful view of Kolkata.

There is not huge options of food there, but still the food they serve is up to the mark in respect to taste.

Afra has continued to be a buzz in town among all foodies for many years and they have recently started Buffet on weekends. We decided to hop in for a bite and do check for ourselves what the buzz was all about. Afra is mainly famous among the people for its over spacious seating arrangements and simple yet classy interiors and decor. The huge place was oozing elegance. Simplistic and minimalist furniture design and dim lights sets up a perfect mood to enjoy good food.

Looking for a place for hangout with friend with lovely Cityscape and finger licking food? Then Afraa Restaurant and Lounge is your one stop destination.

The restaurant located at the 7th floor of CC1 and the lounge section situated on the 6yh floor. Both places have indoor as well as outdoor sitting arrangements, which is huge in terms of space. Being situated at the center of the Saltlake, you will get the amazing skyline view of City.

Now comes to the food. The place offers you both A la carte and Buffet option, which gives you a great freedom to choose your option according to your desire. The lunch buffet costs only 749AI for Monday to Saturday with 1 beer or soft drinks and the Sunday brunch cost only 999 + GST with unlimited alcoholic and Non-alcoholic drinks. So I think, there remain no such reason for don’t visit this restaurant.

We choose the buffet option for our lunch, with two extra starter items and drinks.

First come to those items that we ordered separately -

1.	Murg Tikka Kebab – One of the finest in its class. The chicken pieces were soft, juicy and the spicy level was carefully maintained. Love it.

2.	Paneer Tikka Kebab – Small cubes of Paneer were perfectly cooked with tikka masala. The paneer cubes were fresh and soft. Like it.

Now come to the Lunch buffet spread that Afraa offers us –

In starter and salad section, we have –

	Creamy Chicken With Tomato Buggets

	 Arborio Salad

	 Duet Of Beans With Pickled Onion

	 Apple Celeriac & Walnut Salad

	 Beetroot & Couscous Salad

	 Pork Cold Cuts

	 Chicken Cold Cuts

	 Egg Cocktail Salad

	 Live Papdi Chat Counter

	 Cheese Platter And Assorted Indian Bread

	 Melon Pops

	 Live Counter for Pizza

All items were good, especially the Pork Cold Cuts, Egg Cocktail Salad & Creamy Chicken with Tomato Buggets. We also ordered on papdi chat platter from their live counter, which was good also.

Now come to the Main-course & Side-dish section. Here we have –

	Hungarian Mushroom Soup (Chicken add-on is available) – The soup was veg in nature, tastes mild. But if you add chicken pieces if you want to customize.

	Jeera Rice - Rice was well cooked. The long grain Basmati with Jeera aroma is a perfect item to start your happy meal.

	Yellow Dal Tadka – Dense dal with little creamy flavor in it.

	Achari Aloo – Didn’t try this item, so can’t say about it.

	Oven Roasted Baked Vegetables – Lots of veggies cooked in slowly baked process. The added cheese and butter which enhance the taste of the dish with special aroma.

	Cottage Cheese Balls in Manchurian Sauce – The attractive thing about this item is the Cheese balls. It was too puffy in nature but somehow I feel it was little dry from inside.

	Singaporean Noodles – Veg noodles with traditional little spicy touch in it. Lots of veggies were added into it and the noodles was thick in nature. Love it.

	Prawn Thermidor – Now this is something special, that you don’t get in every buffet spread. The mid sized prawn with coating of egg yolk, butter, milk and flour mixture with mid spicy gravy tastes so good that you will keep licking your fingers. The best part about this dish is, the dish was not cooked, it was baked. So you will enjoy the full taste of cheese with prawn flavor. Amazing na?

	Sliced Fish in Coriander Sauce – Thin sliced ‘Basa’ fish was gently cooked with Coriander sauce. The fish was super soft in nature and just simply melts down in your mouth after having it. The gravy was little lite in terms of flavor as there was Coriander punch into it.

	Roasted Chicken with Porcini Jus – The roasted chicken was cooked in thin gravy. It was neither too spicy nor too lite. Overall a good balanced item.

	Mutton Roganjosh – This one really was the showstopper from the Main course section. The mutton pieces were slowly cooked with spicy curry and it tastes simply just heavenly. Best roganjosh I’ve ever tried. The mutton pieces were soft like butter, full of flavor, juicy and tender. The spicy gravy was really the perfect accompanier with rice or bread. Love it!

Now come to the desserts section. Here we have –

	Assorted Mousse

	Assorted Pastry

	Assorted Tart

	Fruit Salad

	Sweet Curd

So as you can see, they kept the Bengali touch with other cuisines also, which was really good. Mousses were full of creamy delicious flavor. In cakes, we have two different varieties – Pineapple and Red velvet. Both were damn good. Tart was good and finally the Curd was really out of the world.

After having such lovely lunch, thoda drinks toh banta hi hain Boss! So we headed towards the Lounge section, which was on the 6th floor. The place was really good in terms of spacing and decoration and the surround sound really makes your mood fresh.

We ordered three types of Bartender special drinks. Two were vodka based (Blue and the orange one) and one was white rum based (Purple one). The drinks were super refreshing and perfectly crafted. Kudos to the person behind the bar table.

So in conclusion, I’ll say Afraa Restaurant & Lounge is the must go destination for all food & drinks lover. With lovely food, warm hospitality from the management, Team Afraa really made our day. Overall a super satisfactory dining experiences.

Afraa is one of the fine dining restaurant cum lounge in City Center, Saltlake since the early day. Located at 7th floor the restaurant offers great skyline view of the city.

Afraa is well known to me for its lounge - quite big place with excellent ambience! However they are running the buffet for quite some time.

Unlike the popular buffet offering of the city, which focus on starters, Afraa's buffet offering takes care of salads and appetizers, main course and deserts. Please note that they alter the buffet menu regularly and offers ala carte along with buffets. So if you like to opt for ala carte you can! 

Coming to the menu I enjoyed on their buffet menu, the starter and salad section is quite huge. The list includes : Creamy Chicken With Tomato Buggets, Arborio Salad, Duet of Beans With Pickled Onion, Apple Celeriac & Walnut Salad, Beetroot & Couscous Salad, Pork Cold Cuts, Chicken Cold Cuts, Egg Cocktail Salad, Papdi Chat, Cheese Platter and Assorted Indian Bread, Melon Pops, Live Counter ( Mongolian )

Main course includes Hungarian Mushroom Soup (With Add-on Chicken), Jeera Rice, Yellow Dal Tadka, Achari Aloo, Oven Roasted Baked Vegetables, Cottage Cheese Dumplings in Manchurian Sauce, Singaporean Noodles, Prawn Thermidor, Sliced Fish in Coriander Sauce, Roasted Chicken With Porcini Jus, Mutton Roganjosh. 

Among these RECOMMENDED items are Cottage Cheese Dumplings in Manchurian Sauce, Prawn Thermidor, Sliced Fish in Coriander Sauce and Mutton Roganjosh. 

The desserts includes Assorted Mousse, Assorted Pastry, Assorted Tart, Fruit Salad and Sweet Curd. 

After the lunch with heavy buffet, we waited for some time, and they didn't stop us to take rest in the open air of the restaurant floor. After that we opted for some cocktail - two was Vodka based and one was white rum based - three were excellently great in taste. 

Highly recommended buffet of Kolkata - Afraa!!

Located on 7th floor of City Center one the Afraa Restaurant and at the 6th floor is the Lounge is one of the best places to hangout. Both the Restaurant and Lounge is having outdoor sitting available, and the view of the Saltlake city is just mesmerizing from such hight.

Now coming to the ambiance. In very simple words I must say it's beautiful. Giving 5 out of 5 for its decor and ambiance, which is grand and luxurious. The ambiance is really a mood maker. And the staffs are very courteous. It was a pleasure having lunch at this place which was really lavishing, and looking forward to visit it again in near future.

On reaching there we were served with Fresh Lime Soda as a refreshment. We also ordered Chef's special Murg Reshmi Kebab and Paneer Tikka kebab which was just outstanding and lip-smacking in taste. They offer buffet and ala carte both. Buffet menu as follows :
SALADS & STARTER :

 CREAMY CHICKEN WITH TOMATO BUGGETS
 ARBORIO SALAD
 DUET OF BEANS WITH PICKLED ONION
 APPLE CELERIAC & WALNUT SALAD
 BEETROOT & COUSCOUS SALAD
 PORK COLD CUTS
 CHICKEN COLD CUTS
 EGG COCKTAIL SALAD
 PAPDI CHAT
 CHEESE PLATTER AND ASSORTED INDIAN BREAD
 MELON POPS
 LIVE COUNTER ( MONGOLIAN )

MAIN COURSE :

 HUNGARIAN MUSHROOM SOUP ( with add-on CHICKEN ) :- It is primarily a mushroom soup but also consists of other ingredients like paprika, parsley, cream, black pepper, all-purpose flour, and etc.
 JEERA RICE :- It's a popular North Indian dish consisting of cumin seeds and long grain Basmati rice.
 YELLOW DAL TADKA :- Dal Tadka is basically one of the famous North Indian dal recipes. Dal Tadka is cooked lentils which are garnished with oil or ghee fried spices and herbs.
 ACHARI ALOO :- It's kind of dum aloo containing the taste of prickle spices which is no doubt liked by all.
 OVEN ROASTED BAKED VEGETABLES :- Roasted veggies baked in the oven with cheese and cream and topped with coriander and parsley leaf.
 COTTAGE CHEESE DUMPLINGS IN MANCHURIAN SAUCE :- This is a Lithuanian recipe. Cottage cheese balls are coated with bread crumbs and deep fried and after that, it is cooked in the Manchurian sauce.
 SINGAPOREAN NOODLES :- Noodles made in Singapore style tossed with vegetables and soya sauce.
 PRAWN THERMIDOR :- It is a French dish where the prawns are coated with onion paste, butter, flour, egg yolk, milk, grated cheese, salt, MSG and calamansi juice. Then it is baked in the oven. RECOMMENDED
 SLICED FISH IN CORIANDER SAUCE :- Sliced fish cooked in coriander sauce, not at all spicy but tastes too good.
 ROASTED CHICKEN WITH PORCINI JUS :- " Porcini " is a large wild edible brownish boletus mushroom also known as cèpe and " Jus " means a thin gravy or sauce made from meat juices. So here the roasted chicken is cooked in the thin gravy from meat juice along with the Porcini powder.
 MUTTON ROGANJOSH :- It is an aromatic lamb( Mutton ) dish which is one of the signature dishes of North Indian cuisine. It is a gravy made of browned onions, ginger-garlic paste, yogurt and special aromatic spices along with Kashmiri red chilli powder( paprika ).

DESERTS :

 ASSORTED MOUSSE
 ASSORTED PASTRY
 ASSORTED TART
 FRUIT SALAD
 SWEET CURD

The service was really commendable. After having our lunch we spend some time at the Loung which was perfectly decorated to make up party mood. We ordered three bartender's special cocktail and I must say each of the three was a perfect competitor of themselves. Two out of three was made of vodka and the other was of white rum. I strongly recommend this place if you want to spend some special moments with your near and dear ones.

Had been to Afraa couple of times and had always been an enjoyable experience but the time we had on 13th November evening was by far the best. It was my son's 11th b'day celebration and boy, we really had a time of our life. Lovely ambience (though it could have been a lil brighter with few extra candles) and super sumptuous food. Our host for the evening was Sujoy and he ensured we really cherish the evening. Really loved the continental fare that was served which was his recommendation. Infact we did nto have to bother about the food. It was jolly well taken care by him. 
What touch us the most was the small chocolate cake with molten coco for the b'day boy. 

Thanks Sujoy !!!

Hoping to be there again sometime very soon.

The lounge is the ideal place where you can sit back and look at the scenic beauty,if you plan to take your date on for a suprise he/she would love that place.
Speaking about the ambience,it is low lit and kinda soothing,the music plays on in the background on a soft note,the food is even good,properly served with good hospitality,and with all these comes the price which is a bit high,but who cares as long as you get that view and that hospitality with the food you order.

Afraa restaurant and lounge isn't a place to be missed out whether you stay in the city or not. The fact that i always wanted to go here ever since the time i lived in Saltlake but i never ever made it a priority point to do so for some or the other reasons. My Luck was late but it did come as a blessing ,thanks to Supreeta and Shagufta who invited me over at the 7th floor of this property which has some breath taking view to dine in . On coming here i got to know that they have a mid week lunch buffet menu functioning that is ( Mon - Sat from 12:30 pm to 3 pm ) covering a wonderful spread to feast on. I arrived a bit late but definitely had my hands on quite a lot of things which turned out to be very satisfactory indeed. The buffet spread has soups,starters,main course options in Chinese,Indian,Continental and a live counter. The desserts section is something which one would never probably refuse as they will spoil you for choice and for the ones who enjoy a little drink, well the buffet gives you the option to choose one beer or a soft drink all inclusive to complete a happy dining for you .

Dishes for the day from the SOUP there was Red lentil and green apple veloute, from the STARTERS there was Murgh Malai Tikka,Ambi Paneer Tikka,from the MAIN COURSE VEG there was Paneer Awadh Hundi,Mexican Triobeans Lasagne and Woktoffed ginger flavoured greens in sweet basil sauce. Moving further to the MAIN COURSE NON-VEGETARIAN there was Old Kolkata Kosha Mangsho,Balinese Hot Toddy Chicken,Pan fried Fish with Asian greens & mild garlic saffron cream,Prawn Newberg. There was STAPLES like Dal Dum Pukht,Yakhni Pulao,Bami goring noodles,Veg/Non veg Mongolian noodles,Wok tossed greens & chicken and Pizza Non veg. For the sweet tooth get your hands at some Assorted Mousse,Assorted Tart,Fruit Platter,Ice cream vanilla,Assorted Pastry and Komola Bhog. Now that sounds pretty wholesome and interesting ,but what is more surprising is the pricing of this buffet which is INR 749/- all inclusive. Read the last line twice in case you don't believe what i say and visit this place to feel the difference then after.

Now knowing about the menu spread in a little quick detail of the ones i indulged in from above was MURGH MALAI TIKKA,PANNER TIKKA that was pretty good for a starter and rich in flavour ,soft in texture and delicous to the core. I skipped most of the veg main course and opted for a few along with the non veg section and picked DAL DUM PUKHT,YAKHNI PULAO,KOLKATA KOSHA MANGSHO in Indian that was impressive in taste and texture. The BALINESE HOT TODDY CHICKEN,PAN FRIED FISH,BAMI GORING NOODLES was good from the Oriental choice however the Chicken dish could have had a nicer flavour . The CHICKEN PIZZA was simply hands down the best of everything here in my opinion. It was a thin crust one with proper coated cheese and loaded with flavours along with chicken pieces filled.

The day ended with a little soft drink and, the desserts that i picked was ASSORTED MOUSSE,VANILLA ICE CREAM and a ASSORTED PASTRY. It was not the best desserts i had from a buffet before but good enough to end your eating spirits in the sweetest way .

Make this place on top priority to visit very soon especially for this buffet as said for IN
@R 749/- or for a Sunday buffet which will cost you INR 999/- plus tax .

HAPPY FEASTING !

I was always told that Afraa always maintains a class, be it with venue or decor or food - Today I got the oportunity to experience it for myself as I was invited over for a Blogger's Meet at the restaurant by Shagufta and Supreeta for the Weekday Lunch.

The restaurant oozes grandeur as it is extremely muted. It has a lot of natural light which enhances the beauty of the place. The food spread was wide and by the time we got there, the lunch room was quite full with the clammering of people, which is considered a good sign!

Coming to the spread, they had plenty of cold cuts to choose from, salad bar, a counter where the chef cooks up deliciousness, a counter for the mains and a widespread dessert section. I was really impressed with the spread that was fine and very wide. Versatile is definitely their middle name.

I had the fish, prawns, mutton, chicken, the mongolian rice, pizza, kebabs and ended with a plate full of desserts.

The fish and the mutton are an absolute delight. Fall off the bone tender, the mutton is delicious. The fish on the other hand was very nice and light and had a sprout dressing which went beautifully with the dish. The prawns were juicy and nice, just the way I like it. The kebabs were juicy and very flavourful. Also, the mongolian rice was an absolute hit. Spicy and hit all the right notes.

Pizza was thin crust and cheesy, need I say more?

Coming to the desserts, we were quite full already. The tarts were amazing and the red velvet was to die for.

What really surprised me was the fact that despite it being a buffet, they maintained their standards really high. Fun fact is that the buffet is priced at INR 749/- Al. Isn't that amazing?

While on Sundays, they have the buffet and unlimited alcohol for INR 999/- Al.

I totally recommend dining here. It is worth the money and their menu keeps changing every day so a lot of variety to choose from! I am definitely going back real soon.

This place is situated on the 7th floor of G Block at City Centre 1, Salt Lake. We were recently here to give their Mid-Week buffet lunch, a try and we must say, we were impressed. Started by the Ambuja Neotia group, this place has all the qualities to make it your next dining spot.
This place impresses and expresses, both at the first sight itself. The main dining area is huge with a great casual vibe and the interiors set the tone of your dining straight. Besides the huge dining space, they have a place adjoined to the restaurant (a balcony) , where one can smoke and drink witnessing the beauty of the City of Joy from the 7th floor.

As we entered this grand outlet, we were greeted by the Manager who gave us a table instantly. We started off with :

• Fresh Lime Soda : It was different than the mainstream ones that we usually have. It was on point and the flavour of the lime could be distinctly felt making it a great cooler to start our dining experience with.

We grabbed our plates fast to try to start off with their enormous buffet menu. As we headed to the buffet section where all the main- course food was displayed, we could see a difference section only for desserts which were of many varieties! Vibrant and fresh interiors decorated all throughout the restaurant is soothing to the eyes as well. It is almost impossible to mention all the items that the buffet consisted of. Though every item served were as amazing as the other, but then I'll focus on the ones that grabbed my attention!

• Red Lentil and Green Apple Veloute : One of the best soups I've ever had. The taste of the green apple comprehended the uniqueness of the soup!

Starters :
• Murgh Malai Tikka : This kebab was absolutely soulful and one of the best kebabs I've ever had till now! The taste was so great that we went on filling our plates with them.

• Ambi Paneer Tikka : The Paneer was not only juicy but also good to taste. This delicacy is a veg option for all the veg foodies out there. You'll definitely love it.

Main Course :
I'll focus on the non-veg items more.

• Yakni Polao : Even before we digged into it, we were already in love with the aroma surrounding it. Served and cooked in the traditional way, this was heaven on the plate.

• Old Kolkata Kosha Mangsho : As the name suggests, this dish is a signature one as it upholds the rich heritage of the 'Kosha Mangsho ' which will definitely excite e Calcuttan for sure. The mutton pieces were extremely soft and melt in the mouth smooth. The presentation was attractive and it was overall a decent dish which will go hand in hand with the Yakni Polao.

• Balinese Hot Toddy Chicken : It was rich as well as delicious. This is a wonderful delight and yet another option to go for with the Pulao.

• Pan fried fish with Asian greens and mild garlic saffron cream : OMG! The presentation was just wow! The taste was splendid! Being a bong myself, I fell in love with this delicacy with the first bite and left me mesmerized! This dish is perfection in itself and one should absolutely try it once.

Desserts :

• Assorted Tart, Mousse and Pastry : The tarts of different kinds which tasted as great as the other while the mousse were of two kinds : Red velvet and White velvet. Both of them with their wonderful appearance and even wonderful taste will surely attract one!

• Vanilla Icecream and Komola Bhog : Normal Vanilla Icecream that we have on our day to day life served with Komola Bhog, a traditional Bengali sweet. Loved them!

Besides the buffet menu, we even tried some of their signature items which were enchanting!

• Wood Fired oven Pizza : It was their signature hand tossed thin, roman crust pizza which I loved the most. It was made with roasted vegetables, Italian plum tomatoes, chicken, fresh mushrooms, marinated onions and mozzarella. Damn. It was filled with cheese as well and the bread was soft to chew. They provided us with seasonings as well which we could add depending on our taste. Overall, the Pizza is an absolute gem over here.

• Mongolian Rice and Noodles : The items and the noodles were filled with lots of chicken and mushroom and the texture and the taste was well balanced. They were a complete comfort food, to be honest.

The entire buffet menu is curated at Rs. 749 on weekdays with unlimited food and a complimentary drink! They have yet another buffet menu for Sundays which costs Rs. 999.

This place is classy and has a fine tone in itself. The ambience, the decor, the appropriate service, co-operative management, the wonderful food will compell one to visit this place again and again! Great place to keep your hunger quotient running and you'll surely not be disappointed.

Service : 4.8/5

Apart from the world class view Afraa offers great lunch and Sunday Brunch buffets.
The midday lunch buffet on weekdays is priced at Rupees 749 inclusive of all taxes with one complementary beverage or beer.
The buffet has a specially curated menu having wondrous Indian and oriental options.

Regular buffet consists of Starters, main course and desserts pertaining to both vegetarian and non vegetarian palates with the items changing daily.
The starters include soup and kebabs like Ambi paneer tikka and Murgh Malai tikka.
The menu on the day I visited had Mexican Triobeans lasagne, pan fried fish with Asian greens in mild garlic saffron cream, old Kolkata kosha mangsho, Balinese Hot Toddy chicken.
The kosha mangsho was ecstatic with the meat falling off the bones! The mutton pieces used for the buffet were of real great quality unlike other buffets where the quality is not consistent.
The buffet also hosts a live kitchen which tosses and mixes your choices of orient right in front of you. The Mongolian rice /noodles tossed live was quiet a dish to be savored.
I need to take a special mention of the Pizzas they serve at buffet here, thin crusted and full of flavors.
Coming to the desserts, they were my favorite part of the meal. From assorted pastries to mousses, tarts, ice cream and kamala bhog the dessert platter was quite a treat!

Ambiance: 4.7/5
Food: 4.8/5
Value for money: 5/5

With the view they provide and the food they offer, Afraa is really a lovely place to opt for. The outdoor breezy seating is a plus. 

Their buffet at only 749 is something that's gonna keep foodies glued up! I had high expectations and they did keep up with that. Something to highlight is that, they offer meat, fish and chicken all in the buffet, the pieces they provide are moderate and won't let you down! Succulent pieces to satisfy your buds! 

Their think crust wood fire pizzas are a special mention. Cheesy to the perfect extent, well done meat pieces and perfect seasoning. Can't get over it still now! 

Succulent chickdn kebab are better than any average tandoor cuisine restaurant. Perfect blend of flavors and spice. 
They have a veg version with paneer (cottage cheese) it's no less delicious than the chicken. 

Dessert section is as dreamy as any freshly painted canvas. Rossogolla to lemon tarts and ice cream to mango muse, its a dream for any person with a sweet tooth! I loved their caramel tart a ted more. 

Summing it all up, ambiance, staff and food they offer is all worthy of the money they charge. I may sound a bit mainstream but yes your 749/- won't be a waste after all these while. Give it a try! 

Thanks team Afraa,
Love

One of the many famed names in the Kolkata food arena that sadly I have missed... finally made to visit the Afraa with my team Munching Monk's for the ladies night special. We seated in exclusive dinning zone as lounge was crowded with some corporate booking. Located in the 6th and 7th floor of City Center, Salt lake City.
This place has an amazing Retro Calcutta feeling which has the quintessential cosy and romantic ambiance in a backdrop of white. The restaurant was beautifully lit with candles lighting up the decor. Kudos to the chef's Swarup Chaterjee for the delicious mouth watering food and to the Mr. Somnath Dutta for the excellent hospitality.

Food we had-
¶Ultimate Bar B Q chicken pizza- barbeque chicken on top of the thin crust pizza with the pine-apple melted cheese was mouth watering.

¶Fish finger- Crisp on the outside and juicy from the inside. The fish were perfectly Fried. The delicate fish filling was totally melting in mouth.

¶Turkish Chicken Shish Kebab- Marinated with assorted indian spices to perfection, these kebabs were absolutely amazing & soft.

Now, the tippy toes are-
¶Cosmopolitan- I ordered for to change my taste buds for it but still I didn't like it . It appealed to my taste buds like always.

¶Screwdriver - While not being a fan of this particular cocktail, I still wanted to try it out as it was to be Afraa's one of the well made cocktail and yes that turned out to be true I like it quite a lot even though didn't order this on repeat.

¶Gateway Sunshine - A Pineapple juice with vodka mocktail was a falsification. Impecable pineapple taste blend with other juice make it yummilicious.

¶Blue lagoon - A classic mocktail with vodka Base is the perfect pitch.

¶Beer in the house - How can a tippy menu end up without 🍺.

Well this is a very popular plc mainly for its sophistication, calm ambience and comfortable seating both outdoor n indoor. The food is always upto d mark here...  Starters are amazing.  Both the lounge and the Restraunt serve really good starters. 
We went there for lunch buffet. They hav really good main course section apart from the starters but the dessert section was a little turnoff for us.  Only one flavour of ice cream was there.  One time visit for the buffet is okay for me.  May be next time i have to try ala carte

Afraa...A must place for fine dine. The restaurant opens to a wide space which is beautifully lit by nature's blessing (sun light) during the day time. The eatery is spacious with neat decor. The open space gives a beautiful sight of the surrounding locale and the right place to sit and munch on the Afraa delicaies. Food is exceptionally nice. I opted for buffet and consisted of a varied palate. The starters are sumptuous both veg and non veg. Deserts could have more variety as we're pretty common. Well what was very touching was Mr Sujoy who was designated to cater to our table. He has been brilliantly warm by his polite nature and extremely helpful in assisting us with the little nitty gritty.  Thanks Mr Sujoy and team Afraa for the brilliant afternoon. We shall definitely come back to savour the Afraa ambience, goodies and the warmth of the people!!

We had team lunch on 6/11/2017 here.  Our budget for 5 person from office was 5 thousand. We thought not to go for buffet as we can't utilize all the money, so we tried ordering food of our choice. Though food was awesome but after seeing the bill of 10 thousand plus we were shocked :) Problem was we had listened to waiter who asked us to go for their signature dish and those dish were very expensive & since the service was late so we had too much :) Though it was not good experience for us considering the price, I think this should be best place for buffet only.

Afraa is a big name when it comes to food and entertainment. It's been doing its business for a good amount of time now and made its foundation rock solid by its sincere and consistent services.
Had my share of experience and fun at afraa on last Friday. It was jam packed due to the ladies night. We were seated in the 7th floor. While the 6th floor had the ladies night going on as it's the lounge area of Afraa.
● Ambience: elegantly decorated. Lux furniture. dimly lit. Very soothing music (mainly live violin is played). Calm and composed. Accomodates 30 people approx. Has an open air/deck for smoking purposes.
● Drinks:
• Screwdriver
• Cosmopolitan
• Mojito
• White rum shots mixed with orange liquor
• Draught beer
• Blue lagoon (mocktail)
• Lychee drink (mocktail)
● Food:
• Fish fingers : finger licking good! These mini fish fingers were so apt as a finger food with drinks.
• Turkish chicken shish kebab: chunky chicken pieces marinated with cream, having a garlicky flavour, tasted so good along with the cocktails.
• Chicken barbeque pizza: thin crusted pizza loaded with bbq chicken pieces and cheese. Tasted so good and filled the tummy too.

● The party section: the lounge was filled with youngsters. people were enjoying to their heart's content as it was ladies night and drinks were free for the ladies along with their respective entries. Must appreciate the fabulous music played by the DJ.

** Enjoyed my heart out at afraa. Even though it seemed impossible for the staff to handle the crowd, but they executed their job immaculately. Hats off!
** Thanks to Mr. Somnath Dutta for the entire arrangement.
** Thanks to Mr. Sujoy Devgan for his warm hospitality.
** Thanks to Chef Swarup Chatterjee for the lip smacking food.
** And lastly, Thanks to a zillion to the birthday boy and our mentor Tanmay Basak for giving us such a wonderful treat.

Amidst the hustling and bustling city of Kolkata,Afraa has the quintessential romantic ambience in a backdrop of white.The restaurant was beautifully lit with candles lighting up the decore.Team Munching monks were invited for a exclusive ladies night special.We seated ourselves in exclusive dinning zone.Sujoy Devgan himself came up to each and everyone asking for any special requests on food and beverages.The menu included:

1.Turkish Chicken shish kebab
2.Barbeque Chicken pizza
3.Fish finger

The turkish kebab was delicious and polished off my us within minutes.The pizza was my personal favourite with chunks of chicken and melted cheese over it.The crust was paper thin --i mean who does not love that.The fish fingers were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside perfect to go with our drinks.All credits to chef @Swarup Chatterjee

Colorful concoctions of vodka and white rum kept flowing in for the evening.Basic Cocktails included

1.Cosmopolitan
2.Screwdriver
3.Mojito
4.Rum shots

For the non drinkers the bar tender mixed up specials like Gateway Sunshine and Blue lagoon.The mojito had a refreshing feel .The cosmo looked as appealing as it tasted 😋.The Mocktails were equally delicious-though i just took a sip 😊.The ambience is serene overlooking the vast city and violin in the background-that's what makes Afraa special from the rest.Kudos to team Afraa and Somnath Dutta for putting up such a beautiful cocktail dinner😍.

The Most Awaited Brunch

Afraa has such a romantic set up that every time you enter you are mesmerised by the white and blue backdrop and the all white dining setup creating an all formal ambience.
After my last visit at their ladies night ,this time was to try their much heard about buffet brunch spread.Afraa has made it an all food affair with a sumptuous spread.

On my plate this time there was so much that i could not just fit it into one plate😂😂😂😂

An evening in Afraa - where food lovers had a gala time on being invited for a Blogger's meet. So, take your sweet time and bear with me, as this one's gonna be a nice long review. Being one of the most happening lounge and restaurant in Saltlake Area with a famous location on the 6th (lounge) and 7th (restaurant) floor of City Center 1, Afraa has managed to create an aesthetic ambience providing a wide variety of lipsmacking food and drinks with elan. Brownie points for the well maintained Roof Top Seating Area alongside the Restaurant. But what makes Afraa a winner amongst the other top notch lounge restros around the city? Goes without saying, it is their particularly efficient staff, perfect balance between a classic fine dining restaurant on one floor & a hip-hop lounge bar on another, which adds that extra feather to their hat. Invited by Somnath Dutt, we had the best time over well made cocktails, delicious dishes and warm chit chats. Starting with their warm welcome on entering the restaurant, we were served various items with refreshing cocktails & mocktails adding more charm to the overall dining experience. Coming to the food :

• Fish Fingers >> One of the best Finger foods that I've had in a while. For a common item like Fish Finger, this one was extremely well made with juicy fish stuffed inside and a perfectly crisp outer layer. This was just the right companion for all the beverages, so we ordered for it on repeat.

• Turkish chicken shish kebab >> Succulent kebabs with a well balanced smoky flavour, this one was a winner for sure.

• Bar B Q Chicken Pizza>> For a change of palate, this thin crust pizza with cheese oozing out was the right choice. The toppings were ample in amount as well.

Now, shedding some light on the trippy juices :

• Cosmopolitan (Vodka based cocktail) >> An all time favourite, I ordered for this more than once. It appealed to my tastebuds for all the right reasons.

• Screwdriver (Vodka based cocktail) >> While not being a fan of this particular cocktail, I still wanted to try it out as it was said to be Afraa's one of the well made cocktails, and yeah, that turned out to be true. I liked it quite a lot, even though didn't order this on repeat.

• Getaway Sunshine ( A pineapple juice based mocktail) >> With the right mix of juices, it definitely was a great concoction.

• Blue Lagoon >> A classic mocktail which never fails to impress me, was well made here.

• Beer on the house >> The beer lover in me did a happy dance when those mugs of chilled beer started coming up to me one after another.

And thereby, our feast was unimaginably sumptuous and with the happy (and trippy!) tummies, we were charged up enough for a little dancing and hanging out in the lounge section downstairs, on the 6th floor of Afraa. And this evening, was all the more special to us, as we celebrated #MunchingMonk Family's Team Leader/Captain

Winter is here and this is that time of the year when you should indulge in amazing food sitting at a rooftop restaurant .And Afraa is that place which gives you a space filled with magic to have an memorable experience.

Attention all the beautiful ladies,you have a good news here.Afraa hosts ladies night every friday.So what are you waiting for Go grab those cindrella shoes and dance the night away.

Now about the food.
You can either opt for the buffet or go for a la carte.
Afraa also offers a wide array of assorted cocktails and mocktails to choose from.

We ordered
1.Ultimate Bar B Q chicken pizza-Thin crust topped with lovely bbq chicken ,pineapple dices and melted gouda cheese.This is totally out of the world.

2.Fish finger-Crisp on the out side and soft on the inside .The fish fingers were perfectly fried.The delicate fish filling was totally melting in mouth.

3.Turkish chicken shish kebab-Marinated with assorted spices and condiments and charred to perfection,these kebabs were absolutely amazing.

Mocktails & Cocktails-
1.Screw driver
2.Cosmopolitan
3.Beer

6.Virgin mojito

I went for
1 .Blue lagoon with pineapple base-I really loved the subtle flavour of pineapple in it.
2.Gateway sunrise-This is a litchi base mocktail and trust me its really worth having .

The staff was attentive ,friendly and cheerful.They also helped us in ordering these mocktails.

Places like Afraa only indulges the love for food!! The food quality and the ambience is the main reason to visit this place again and again. Located within the City Centre one in Saltlake area this place is the perfect place to take your loved ones for a dinner date. We were invited on the behalf of the Afraa team for the food bloggers meet. Located at 7th floor the first thing that attracted me most about the place is the ambience, the soothing lights and the live violen creates the perfect ambience for a romantic date.
The behaviour of the staffs were too good.
Now coming to the food!!
Afraa is famous for both its mocktails and cocktails.
The Blue lagoon needs a special mention here. Generally i tasted blue lagoon in a 7 up base but afraa made it in a pine apple juice based which was too good. And is highly recommended for non alcoholic mocktails lovers.
Like blue lagoon there were several mocktails based on juices.
Moving to the cocktails part, afraa served us with several types of cocktails like Screw drivers, Cosmopolitan, White Rum shots.
The presentation of each and every drinks own my heart and Afraa never compromised with the taste as well.
Now coming to the food items!!
Turkish chicken shish kebab - The kebabs just melted in the mouth those were too good in taste .
Barbeque Chicken Pizza - Pizzas were great in taste.
Fish Fingers - I loved these the most, the flavours in fish fingers were tempting and it is recommended for all food lovers.
With this bloggers meet, that day it was the birthday of our mentor of our group, the management team of Afraa knowing this arranged for a lovely cake!! With soothing live violin. The tune of violin was just mesmerizing!!
Over all we had a great time at Afraa and looking forward to visit again and again.
I would like to thank Somnath Dutt for making the whole arrangements.
Special mention should be made of Mr Sujoy Devgan for his hospitality .
And special thanks to the chef Mr Swarup Chatterjee of Afraa for such wonderful dishes.
Thank you Afraa for gifting us such a wonderful time looking forward to visit again and again.
Thank you Tanmay da for leading us!!
Before leaving we also visited the lounge at 6th floor where the friday special ladies night were being celebrated.
The loud music and the ambience just own my heart, the music were too good!!
Looking forward to visit the lounge again to dance with some great music.
Afraa is highly recomended to the party lovers as well as food lovers.

This place is located on the 7th Floor of City Centre 1 , and has a great view , to begin with . The lift leads right to the entrance of the lounge. The place has an amazing ambiance, and is sure to be a party lover's favourite. The ladies' night here is awesome , with great music , amazing crowd , and free cocktails on the house! The little wooden stairs beside the buffet area lead you to a view of Salt Lake till the horizon ! Grab your glass/ bottle and walk right up to this place , where you can smoke and feel the evening air like nowhere else in CC1. The place is the perfect party den for those of you who like your music loud and clear . However , it is tad expensive when compared to Kix lounge in the same mall premises , so be prepared to shell out those extra bucks for its extra awesome ambiance! Oh , and you might just witness the bartender set fire to the bar like they do in fancy movie scenes !

The restaurant offers a wide array of organic assorted contemporary and local delicacies to choose
from. Quite grateful that we could try and choose from almost all of the dishes- and surprisingly we were impressed.

The restaurant’s sumptuous week day lunch buffet menu features different culinary style exotic
Starters, variety of Cold Salads, Veg/Non Veg Main Course, Live Curving Station, Assorted Desserts,
Infused Water, etc.

Now, we tried a lot of things, but, these were some of my favourites:

1. Creamy Chicken and Broccoli; white beans soup with lemon and ricotta- I love a good bowl of soup, and this was indeed soulful

2. Palak Akhrot Ki Kofta- Soft koftas in delightful curry! 10/10.

3. Bethuarani Marinated fish with orange cilantro veggies- I love fish and this dish was extremely flavourful and an absolute stunner!

4. Roast chicken- THEY HAVE A LIVE COUNTER!! what??!! Yes. A must try, juicy and tender roast chicken FTW.

5. Desserts- EACH AND EVERY ITEM IN THIS SECTION IS WORTH IT, especially Indian Gratin with Vanilla Ice Cream.

Pocket Pinch: 749 AI with 1 beer or soft beverage
Timings: Mon-Sat; 12:30-3pm

Afraa Lounge and Restaurant, situated in the 7th floor at CC1 is a perfect place for your Weekend Brunch Buffet or maybe hanging out with your colleagues between work hours for a sumptuous lunch break on weekdays!

P.S. You can capture amazing cloudscapes from up there.

High end restaurant.. heavy on d wallet.. would be bit of injustice if I don try their nonveg items.. could come back for that and d ambiance..

In a mall people generally look for Restaurants after shopping to treat themselves with good food and some refreshment drinks. So Afraa Restaurant and Lounge is a perfect place for that. Actual place to hop in with friends and family.

Afraa Restaurant is located at 7th floor which offers a rooftop view where the entire city centre can be seen and it’s a heavenly place with great ambience of a luxurious hotel. They offer some premium buffets menu the whole week with different pricing and dishes.

Afraa Lounge is located at 6th floor just below their Restaurant and can easily be accessible from the Restaurant as there is a stairs outside which leads directly to the Lounge. We visited on 28th of October and we found it was decorated with Halloween theme as it appears on 31st Oct. Full lounge was decorated with Halloween masks, skeleton, skull face, scary faced pumpkins, etc which has created a great ambience and gave me an actual Halloween Night feeling.

When we speak of a restaurant based out of the 6th or 7th floor of a building, we seldom find it blooming, given it’s so-called remote location! On the contrary, places like Afraa have been heavily blooming and using their roof top ambience to lure more and more customers!

Their 6th floor is dedicated to the discotheque and the 7th to the restro! The ambience is to die for, so is the service! Imagine sipping a blue lagoon viewing the entire Kolkata from the Afraa rooftop and simply the imagination only blows you away!

We tried the below items:-

(i)	Veg thin crust pizza – The thinnest of the thin crust with lots of babycorns, varied capsicums, corns, jalapenos and what not – to give a good start to a great meal!

(ii)	Spaghetti pasta – Prepared live, with great veggie content, this one is another fine starter! They serve penne pastas also!

(iii)	Veg wantons – They do know how to fry the perfect wantons – great crispiness, fine stuffing and served with an awesome saffron dip!

(iv)	Thick cream veg soup – Tasted fine, also, chicken pieces were provided fot=r the non vegetarians!

(v)	Fruit platter – Consisted papayas, apples, pineapple and watermelons (all import quality mind it) – to add a healthy note to our meal!

(vi)	Papdi chat – Great presentation and great masala content, lots of chopped green chillies, although the papdi was a tad too hard to bite off!

(vii)	Pressure ki kabuli – The only rice available on the buffet, however, the fried and boiled potato content failed to impress us!

(viii)	Dum Kasturi – Yellow moong daal with red chilli paste, which fell low on expectations!

(ix)	Palak aur akhrot ka kofta – The main course which we all adored, palak stuffing within kofta with dry fruit gravy, we however, expected the kofta to be softer!

(x)	Mexican Spinach Noodles – A show stopper indeed, the high veg content and taste ensures you skip a heart-beat or two!

(xi)	Wok tossed potatoes – Just fine, nothing great!

(xii)	Mojo marinated Cuban vegetables – A decent Italian dish, but not much impressive!

(xiii)	Masala kulcha – A kulcha to remember indeed, the optimum masala stuffing and the perfect taste, can be had standalone also!

(xiv)	Lachcha paratha – Maida based, and low on taste, but crispy!

(xv)	Assorted salads – Included lachcha onions, c=sliced tomatoes, cucumbers etc

(xvi)	Papads – Served on request!

(xvii)	Indian Gratin : Mihidana with sliced as well as mini Gulab Jamuns – a nice Indian fusion, best when had piping hot!

(xviii)	Chocolate pastry – My ultimate favourite from the buffet!

(xix)	Vanilla ice cream – Went pretty well with the available desserts

(xx)	Assorted mousse – Chocolate, Butter scotch as well as Vanilla flavours were available

(xxi)	Blue lagoon mocktail – Great presentation, the pineapple slice deserves a special mention, but taste nothing extra ordinary!

(xxii)	Lemon tart – the lemon puree content fell short of expectations, but the tart outside was itself a treat!

(xxiii)	Getaway Sunday mocktail – Awesome peach based drink, the cucumber touch makes it a must have!

The list is endless and the above depict a glimpse of the items I personally had! There are more than double the items mentioned above if we include the non-vegetarian ones also! Nice to see a fine balance between the veg as well as the non veg items on their buffet menu!

A 5/5 for food presentation, 5/5 for service, 5/5 for ambience, 5/5 for price tag and a 4.5/5 for taste works out to a 5/5 overall for this place!

RECOMMENDED!

Modern & elegant touch to the ambiance makes this place perfect for a dinner date with your loved one.

Penne White Pasta : Cheesy penne pasta in white sauce and small chicken pieces.

Jamaican Jerk Chicken : Sliced soft grilled chicken cut from a whole grilled chicken, looked delicious with vegetables.

Tandoori Phool : Browny crispy grilled cauliflower that looked very good.

Thin Crust Pizzas : Pizzas made on thin & crispy crusts with chicken or veg toppings and cheese.

Mains :
========

Pressure Ki Kabuli : Fine cooked yellow basmati rice with potato, complementing every other main dishes.

Dal Kasturi : Mixed grain highly cooked spicy dal preferable with rice.

Afraa Lounge & Restaurant was probably one of the first to start the concept of a Sunday brunch in the city. I’ve been an Afraa regular since the place opened a few years back and the Afraa Sunday brunch has always been a favorite. . First of all, the ambience is great. They have both indoor and outdoor seating and eating a relaxed meal overlooking the Salt Lake skyline on a Sunday afternoon feels really nice. Second of all, they serve unlimited soft and hard drinks and cocktails. Third reason is that the brunch includes a huge spread with all kinds of veg and non-veg food – cold cuts, salads, an excellent selection of cheese, grilled meat and veggies, main course with Indian, Oriental and Continental fare and delicious desserts. Fourth reason is that for all of this, the price of the Sunday brunch is very economical. It is only Rs 999 plus taxes.
                                                                ...

Located on the seventh floor of City Center 1, the restaurant offers an excellent view of Saltlake and parts of the city. The restaurant is bright and very well lit with daylight. Staffs are well behaved and the ambiance is good. 
At first we were welcomed by a complimentary drink...a beer nd a mocktail (blue- lagoon).Then coming to the salads...they have an variety of salads..cold cuts..cheese platter and consists of one veg and non veg soup. We had a live counter of chaat...and pasta...
Next coming to the main course...which consists of of 4 non veg(chicken..mutton..prawn..nd fish..and 3 veg courses(corn rice..paneer nd ginger noodles). 
Their dessert section needs to get improved. Only a few pastries a tart and gulab-jamun.
Nd it consist of only one flavoured ice cream...which was vanilla...
Starters needs to get improved...Nd also the dessert section...Nd in main course rice should be added to the non-veg section..Nd the taste of pasta should be improved....

Excellent food and ambiance..
Specially the mutton dish , which was simply awesome.
Over all a good option for Mughlai and Continental food.
A large variety of drinks and mock tails.
Service level was excellent.
A little over priced of course.
Very well attended by Mr Subir Dey.
Thanks

For a romantic dining experience with candle light and live music there is no better choice than Afraa.The glassy modern western decor goes with the ambience it offers.They have both continental and Indian section in their menu.But we always prefer the former one as the options there are hard to omit.The  Braised lamb shank is a blast of flavour.The rich smoky flavour of the brown sauce along with the saffron flavoured potatoes,shallots and mushrooms is a feast for the tastebuds.Afraa also offers thin crust stone baked pizzas which are obviously different from the fast food chain versions.If you are fond of original Italian home style pizza,Afraa is the only option that should come to your mind. The options are very limited but that is quite obvious when you are experiencing something so exotic.
For ordering the "Four Seasons "and "Afraa" (from the veg section)and the "BBQ Chicken "  we don't  even think twice. Earlier they used to serve a seafood pizza "Sicilian "
of which we were die hard fans.Don't know the reason why it has been discontinued.We still miss it a lot. Being a pasta lover I am also a fan of their lip smacking pastas .The ravioli with mushrooms and mascarpone and  the baked potato gnocchi are superb in taste.The quantities are huge for pastas. It is better to be a bit judicious in ordering especially  if you have  a smaller appetite.My favourite one from this section is the seafood Risotto.For me,nothing can be better than having a bowlful of this heavenly taste to spend a lazy evening sitting in the cosy corner with  melodious violin playing  favourite tune and the floating flames creating a mystery of light and shade.

Afraa is perhaps the best venue in the city for gourmands. Its ambience quality and variety of food speaks for itself. 
It was a memorable evening me and my friend Anuradha spent there. The highlight of the evening was a special treat by our dear friend and celeb chef Swarup. Swarup is indeed a magician when he whips up exclusive dishes for his guests. 
They say "Food is the music to the body and music is the food to the heart" that sayings came true  when Chef Swarup specially sang for us. If his dishes tingled our tastebuds to a heavenly delight, then his melodius rendering of Gazals and taans filled our heart with a etheral joy.
Its one of the best dinner we had so far. Viva Afraa.

Afraa...I liked the name in the first place and ended up loving the complete experience, yes it is complete experience, beautiful lounge, open air sitting with amazing night Kolkata view, (of'course dewali added to it), wonderful ambiance and of'course the FOOD ... Ohh my God! I can travel 1500 kms just to have that heavenly clear vegetable soup, leave alone the mouth watering grilled fish and that Afraa special desert Monte Carlo. Chef, Hats off! Guys please open an outlet here in Delhi, everytime traveling to Kolkata will get expensive ;).
Cheers!

We were being served by Sujoy Ghosh  & feel really blessed to arrive here. The food quality served is awesome. It also had one live counter where it served italian food, which was mouth watering. The greatest asset is that the foods are cooked on less oil & one more thing need to added, that's location &  pleasant ambience as well of this place. Will recommend people to come and enjoy their time.

Been there tonight for a small birthday celebrations. This is not the first time I have been here. But I am writing this review for certain courteousness that I experienced today at this restaurant. Firstly the food quality and quantity is really good. We got there a bit late but they took the order and delivered the starters real fast. We ordered mixed meat platter which was as it should be. Main course we ordered Kolkata Bhetki, Pork Chops and a Continental Chicken item. All the food was sumptuous and very tasty. Specially mention the guy at the table Mr.Sujay, due to him we didn't have to bother about anything. He specially taken care about all the aspects and enquire simultaneously about the food and the service, we sincerely thank him for the well appreciated service and hope to feel like the same in the future.

Located on the 7th floor of G block, this place is an absolute stunner when it comes to plush interiors or the view through the glass panes. Their staff are well behaved and the ambience is soothing. Coming to food, we asked for draught beer which was unavailable. We opted for their lunch buffet. They have an array of salads,cold cuts, cheese platter ,2 starters,and a lavish main course,that tastes pretty good. Their dessert section needs to improve though. Only a few pastries and a tart( that reeked of raw eggs) with mihidana. They didn't have any variant of ice cream other than vanilla.

Here comes my first review. Just been to this place today for lunch with my friends. The ambience was perfect. We sat at a corner table which gave us the outside view from two of the glass walls. Great food served here. The starters were amazing. To count a few, we were served delicious thin crust pizza, a tremendously tasty thai curry (green sauce) and a lovely cheesecake as one of the desserts. We finished off with little shots of chillers and a chocolate pan was a cherry on the top. We were personally greeted by the chef. Nice people around. Finally the coordination of Mr. Sarkar and Mr. Dey added up to make this a happy and fulfilled meal.

Afraa- The name says it all. One of the best diners place in Kolkata. Located at City centre, Saltlake..this lounge alongwith open view from the top is as beautiful that cannot be described.

The interior is very classy and and soothing. The well laid big white sofas make you feel more comfortable.

The place is well known for its  best ambience. Everything is on top notch.

Now from these huge Buffet I tasted some of them mention worthy.

MINIATURE OF MAKHUNI PARATHA TOPPED WITH SANPLA NARKOL- A combination of Bangladeshi and Indian flavour. Pita bread kind of PARATHA with Sanpla and coconut paste in it.

CHICKEN KABIRAJI- A well known dish among Kolkata foodies. The kabiraji was good . Crispy from outside. The chicken was juicy and succlucent.

LOITTYA JHURI PARATHAS- A very unique dish. Loittya fish paste stuffed parathas. The fish was well marinated. Had that spicyness into it.Must try. 
BEGUN BASANTI – Fried eggplant with various spices cooked with mustard sauce. Another mention worthy dish.

TEL KOI- Perfect for puja menu. Large sized Koi Fish which was very tasty in itself. The spicyness of the  gravy added more flavours into it. Compliments with rice very well.

OLD KOLKATA STYLE MUTTON BIRIYANI- Tasted good. The rice was quite flavourful nice alongwith the mutton and potato. The mutton was soft and juicy.

KORAISHUTIR KOCHURI- Ahha..Durga Puja means Kochuri. And Afraa kept that in mind. The Kochuri was very tasty. Stuffed with peas and spices.

NARKOL DIYE CHOLAR DAAL-Complimented with Kochuri very well. The daal was thick and a little sweet. And perfect in taste. You can get small pieces of coconut in it. 
Now for the desserts tasted various kinds flavourful roshogolla like CHOCOLATE, BELFUL, KACHA MORICH, MANGO AND ANAR.. The mention worthy be KACHA MORICH. It was really very tasty. You will surely find a newness into it. Other roshogollas was also very nice with different colours and textures into it. 
All in one a great experience visiting over Afraa. Thanks to the management for such a warm welcome. Will be visiting again. Till then Happy Eating 🙂

Proud member of Team Panchphoron .

Not more often you visit a place with great decor, excellent food, courteous staffs, great management... Afraa is one of those few palaces which stand right on the top when it comes to the above listed parameters. Starting from the soup, starters, main courses, desserts are excellent... Much deserving 5/5 for the place... keep it up...

Went on a dinner date and the ambience and amount of dedication from the waiters and the staff made it a delightful experience.

We began the meal with Tandoori Betki, which our waiter Mr. Sujoy informed us is a signature dish of the restaurant. The fish was fresh, full of flavour, and the grilling was perfect. Next was the Pollo de graziella, an oven cooked chicken. The meat was soft and the whole dish was extremely tasty. We also ordered the Seafood rissotto which had generous quantities of prawns, squids, and fish. The rissotto was beautifully creamy and quite well prepared.
We ordered Copa Lolita for dessert, and it turned out be quite an interesting dish. It has chunks of toffee, ginger biscuit, one portion of caramel custard, and icecream.
We downed everything with Jacobs Creek Shiraz and Sula Chenin Blanc.

The food was excellent and very fresh. Our waiter Mr. Sujoy was extremely hospitable and helped make our dinner special. The musician also deserves a mention as he really set the ambience.

The title of the review.."Vegetarian People beware of non-veg food"
Seriously so many option in non-veg that you might just become a non-veg from being a vegetarian.

The place is on the 7 floor of CC1 building. The interior and the well dressed staff makes it look like a five star restaurant. The view is amazing and they serve water in wine glasses, so even we did not order wine, we had the experience of the same ;-)
The buffet is more inclined towards a continental food rather than the normal usual buffet starters that we eat.
They had excellent range of salads ,cold cuts, starters were limited to 2 (1 veg that too potato and 1 non veg which was fish and smelled strange)
For drinks you can choose between beer (pint) ,sweet lime and blue lagoon.
The service was slow upfront but when it became a little crowded, it became fast. ....I guess they brought in reinforcement. :-)
There was this live counter which servered rice rissotto..one of the best that I had till day...please do try....
The main course had a soup (average) ,Polao(awesome) ,dal,chicken,panner,fish, chowmein,mutton and prawn.
All the items are cooked in a different non-indian style ,which you won't find in other famous buffets of the city.
But all the items were good.
The desert lacked items ,was mainly cream pastry, a few tarts, one vanilla ice cream .
The best was the fruits in the desert section. :-)
Overall for 599( nearbuy coupon)...full paisa WASOOL...with nice dinning experience...
Will visit again ...and a must recommend for a different style of buffet.

Well, never was a great buffet lover except for a few exceptional places, but this was a altogether mixture of emotion at nabami night.

So we had banked on this place for the festive dinner; and to our disappointment buffet was only thing we got where we had their ala-carte in our mind

As buffets go, there were items like Kadamkona Mutton Korma, Lote poita, Kabirajis in starters to treat our taste-buds; there were Chanr dalna, Doi katla, a unique Biriyani to delight us and lastly it would be a crime not to mention the achaars and salads and fruits we all devoured!

But the dessert section ghastly bored us as none of them were even average... Honestly they need to excel in this section if they want to serve quality buffets...

Long for the ala-carte sometime again.

Till date it was the worst ever experience having dinner in Afraa. It was astami night n we were a group of 12 people. First of all the spread was too bad though the price was even higher than other well known buffets around the town. It cost 1700/-for each. The service was bad. They could not provide all the mentioned flavours of ice cream saying they did not have the stock. The rosogollas were the worst. It seemed they have served 2-3days old dessert. All the 12 of us n our friends or relatives,  nobody will go to Afraa ever, that's for sure.

Visited afraa on 26th September with a friend
Opted for the lunch buffet
The starters were grilled chicken n panner ,tasted mediocre,the soup was bogus
They had too many varieties , presentation was good,but damn tasted really bizzare
In the main course the prawn n mutton curry were good
There weren't too many varieties for deserts though
Ice Cream, pastry ,and velvet cake which was the only desert that we liked and assorted fruits
Not too impressed with the service also
Not value for money

Went there yesterday to end the pujo mood, and let me tell you it was not disappointing! Tried their buffet menu which had multiple choices for main course. I wish they could serve more starters as there was only one veg and one non-veg starter. But the main course had taken care of it. There was fish, chicken, prawn mutton. And everything was delicious.
The ambiance is superb as you can get the entire rooftop view from City Centre. The price was also reasonable. Definitely a good place to visit.

Visited last night,2nd October '17 at around 9:30 PM and received awesome reception,wait time for table was 5 mins,behaviour of everyone was too good.
Ordered a meat shared platter which has  continental preparation of bacon/pork,fish,egg,chicken,mutton and mashed potato. Topped it up with a prawn/lobster..however the platter without it is as good,but may not be sufficient for 3.Desserts were too good,we had home made icecream,Caramel custard.The hit was chocolate paan.
Staff were courteous and helpful, specially Sujoy.  They light a candle on your table making the ambience wonderful.

It was an awesome experience of dinner date on Navami night at Afraa. It was a full house. We enjoyed our dinner at open air place ! Started with Loytta jhuri pantharas, chicken kabiraji. Then kadamkua mutton kebab was delicious!

Had refreshing cocktails. And most of the lot I loved the Pan flavoured ice cream.
And flavoured Rosogollas

Ambience, decor and the service level of the staffs were truly of top notch!

I would definitely like to come back more often when I will be in kolkata.

Special mention Somnath Dutt for arranging our dinner!

And Sujoy Devgan for the heart warming services! The Foodinista

Sharodiya Mahabhoj. 
Maha Dasami (lunch /dinner )

The restaurant’s theme based on the puja is well designed . The food is extremely well presented. Their drama like presentation makes you await the next course. 

Mouth watering indulgence. 
Specializing in the Bengali cuisine , Afraa Restaurant has a unique mall presence in the Salt Lake area. The menu is fresh and appealing. The loytta jhuri pantharas with tomato kasundi, chicken kabiraji, kadamkua mutton kebab and doi tulsir ghol among house beverage is highly recommended. Sitting atop Salt Lake’s City Centre in split levels, with its interiors in white, wood and glass, Afraa Lounge & Restaurant affords a panoramic view of the township, while at night the surrounding area looks rather magical and captivating.
A very very good place to with family or solo . Ambience is something different than our thinking . Restaurant offers foods from Indian to continental type. Dessert options are lot of. Offers vide variety of foods .So I would suggest that this restaurant is the best place of a family dinning.
Chingri narkol bhapa,  purulia murgir mangso,  Dhone pata ar Kacha lonka diye doi mangso are the best attractions from the hot galley from the lunch date. 


And the paan ice creme and the rosgollas from the rosgolla bar are mouth watering. 

Doi tulsir ghol :

Doi tulsir Ghol is an aromatic, flavorful and delicious dish which is very much popular in West Bengal. The name itself get juices flowing in your mouth and this dish has a heavenly experience in every bite. When Doi tulsir Ghol is cooked perfectly it can turn into a dish beyond excellence. Doi tulsir Ghol is one of the representative dishes of West Bengal which you can serve in any special occasions.

Loytta jhuri pantharas with tomato kasundi:

Loitta or Lote Macher Jhuri is a spicy fish curry, very popular throughout Bengal. This fish is known by different names and spellings. In West Bengal and Bangladesh, it is called as Loitta or Loitya, in Mumbai it is known as Bombil or Bombay Duck, in Kerala it is called Bummili and Ushnish in Chinese. The fresh loitta fish is very soft in texture and cooked in various forms. This recipe is my own version of cooking loitta and trust me it tastes delicious. It goes well with white rice or roti. Loytta jhuri pantharas is a rolled slice with loytta. Delicious and mouth watering from the menu at Afraa,  is a must eat. 

Chicken kabiraji :
This is a deep fried dish stuffed with chicken. 


Kadamkua Mutton kebab :
Kebab is delicious. Mutton kebab is presented in a special way. 


Chingri Narkol Bhapa :

Chingri Narkel Bhapa is a very popular Bengali dish, it is  usually served  as a protein of   a Bengali  lunch or  a dinner  meal along with Dal, Veg Curry, and steamed Basmati rice.  " Chingri" is Prawn or shrimp, "Narkel" is Coconut, and "Posto" is Poppy seeds. Which mean Prawns cooked in coconut and poppy seed gravy. 

Purulia Murgi mangso :

It's a fried spicy food. Roasted with different spices it's absolutely a delicious one. 

Dhone pata r kacha lonka diye doi mangso :
It's a different food with minimal spice and dhone pata.


The menu at Afraa is a mix of traditional and contemporary dishes, with a generous dose of fusion fare. Think quesadillas stuffed with mochar ghonto, Kadamkua Mutton Kebab and Chicken Kobiraji for starters, and Chargrilled Moong Dal Steak with gandharaj-infused basanti gravy and Chingri Narkol Bhapa for mains. Yum!

My go-to place in Kolkata whenever I am confused on a place to dine out - and Afraa never disappoints. Best thing about this place is that you get good food, great drinks and nice hookah all under one roof. And yes, being situated in Salt Lake is an added bonus - which means I can avoid the mad traffic in Park St , Camac St etc.
Definitely the best bar/lounge in Salt Lake.

This is not the first I have to Afraa, but every time I get best service from hospitality.during Puja I had very bad experience in food in other restaurants  so this year I tried Afraa Bengali menu. It was superb. The service, presentation, hoapitality  everything were fabulous. And mainly Mr. Somnath Dutta he was best manager I ever seen. Every one should try.

Went here @Nabami Night for buffet... extremely poor food..some of the dishes are not there in the counter when I asked for those, they repeatedly kept telling that it will come..we spent 1 hr but those are not arrived. After that I saw salads and desserts are taken off, when I asked for that they told that it will come..after 30minutes they came up with 1sweet and that was also poor.. over all very very very bad experience. Over rated.Service poor..waiters and managers are liars..they are simply stealing money from the bag..very bad..worst in kolkata. Unfortunate .. disappointed. Guys pls don't go..they are simply cheaters.

No doubt this place has a good rating and I am sure that is for it's superb ambience,great view and they charge you for that as a platter of two prawn,1mutton pattie,two small fish piece and two little tiny chicken piece cannot cost you Rs975+tax
Yes its definitely costly and not a place for foodies as  you do not have much option,very normal presentation of food as already mentioned,people are already happy with the ambience and view.
So must visit for spending long hour and lazy evening but strict no for foodies

If you visit there for the first time you would have a sudden feel good factor because of the ambience. The decor is sleek and the view is awesome. You already have a smile on your face even before you taste the food. The next best thing are the various salad and the live counter where you can customize your choices. 
With unlimited liquor and snacks/salads its a go to place for a brunch and long chat with your group.
There is ofcourse a scope of improvement in the main course and that should be the focus point for the restaurant. The non veg and also the veg main course can be better.
You end up with a decent desert and hence it makes your overall experience good.

Visited this restaurant for their special Puja Buffet lunch. Even though we had pre-booked our seats, the management kept us waiting for some 35-40 minutes before allotting us seats. I don't mind having to wait 10-15 minutes, but this was way too much. I suspect that they had taken more reservations than they could handle.
Coming to food, it was kind of a mixed bag. I loved their Prawn Curry cooked with Coconuts & Mustard, as well as the Murshidabadi Lalmaas. A few of the desserts were good as well. Rest of the items were average at best.

Awful Special Durga Puja Buffet...Mismanagement all through out .Snacks served is cold and pathetic ...not at all presentable.Highly below  my expectations..If you can't manage why avoid it..Suggestion to the management if you can't maintain the quality why arrange such a buffet where prior reservations are being taken. It's simply ruining Afraa image.

The worst buffet I have had in my life. Took 1200. Was not worth even 1/10th of it. Entire food was cold. Most of the meat was stale. Rotis were hard. Rice of poor quality. Roshogolla (the pride of the city) was hard. 

Don't even think of going there if they serve you buffet. You will feel cheated of your money

Went for the buffet on a Sunday afternoon for our Hindu School team get together 😀 Food was good and so was the service. One thing that probably differentiates this from the other buffet in town is that it offers unlimited drinks as well! The ambience was great, from the enormous glass window you can see the city very far, it must be looking more wonderful in the evening, I need to come back for that. I visited the restaurant today at around 12-15 PM to 4:30 PM. It's Durga Puja time.. So perfect time to go and grab the beer 😁😁

Just based on my last visit, I should have given this place a lower rating. But apart from that all our earlier visits have been excellent so the above rating. The ambience of this city centre restaurant is very classy. On my last visit, we tried the asparagus soup. The flavours were good but it was thick and difficult to have. The tuscany mushrooms were excellent. They were gooey and a must have. The corn sheekh kabab was good without being great. The gnocchi was dense and I would suggest giving it a best. The afraa pizza'a topping was tasty but the crust could have been better.
Overall the dishes can be better.

One of the best locations for a fine dining restaurant. The 7th floor terrace has a wonderful view of the saltlake city. Plus they have one of the best continental cuisines in calcutta. I particularly liked the fish sautéed and the choice of assorted cheese. One suggestion though, the choices of desserts were a bit underwhelming, a little variety would make it the perfect continental buffet in Calcutta.

Afraa was on my wishlist for long and the main attraction for me was the view of Salt Lake from there... 

The ambience is really good with lot of natural light. Ordered “The Ultimate Barbecue Chicken Pizza” 🍕 - Loved it! 

Although the view of Salt Lake from the 7th floor didn’t impress me, but the food, ambience and hospitality surely did! 

Spacious seating arrangement and very courteous staffs.

Whenever the name AFRAA comes up, the first thought that goes through someone's head is "WOW''.
I PERSONALLY AM A BIG FAN OF AFRAA AND IT IS THE ONLY PLACE WORTH VISITING AT CITY CENTRE.
LOCATED AT  THE CITY CENTRE SALT LAKE SECTOR 1, THIS PLACE OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF BUFFETS AND DRINKS AT REASONABLE PRICES. 
ONE SHOULD DEFINITELY CHECK OUT THEIR WIDE VARIETIES OF UNLIMITED STARTERS THAT THEY PROVIDE IN THEIR BRUNCH AND LUNCH BUFFETS.
THE AMBIENCE OF THIS PLACE IS SOOOOO AWESOME <3 <3
TRULY LOVE THEIR AMBIENCE, THE FOOD, AND THE STAFF ARE ALSO VERY PROFESSIONAL AND WELL BEHAVED.
THE BEST THING IS THAT THEY SERVE BIRA 91 HERE <3 <3 
WOWWWIIEE... 
THE MUTTON BIRIYANI AND THE BROWNIE HERE IS A MUST TRY.
IN CONCLUSION, IF YOU VISIT CITY CENTRE THE NEXT TIME DO DROP BY HERE AND AVAIL GOOD FOOD AND DRINKS AT EXCITING PRICES. <3
MUCH LOVE.

The most awaited festival of Bengal Durga Puja and Bengali’s are very much excited about Puja. during puja days we all enjoy the entire day to the fullest and most of us used to eat outside of our home. yes, we do eat homemade food but it’s impossible for us to eat at home every day. keep this in mind most of the restaurants arrange a special buffet menu during puja days from Sasthi to Dashami. you can find homemade foods in restaurant style, from varieties of fried items to preparation of fish, chicken mutton, very famous Lucchi, Cholar Dal to Biryani & Kosha Mangsho. ” Afraa restaurant & Lounge ” which is a very popular place where you can have lip-smacking dishes. it’s located 6th and 7th floor, City Centre 1, Block G, Salt Lake Sector 1 Area. This place serves really good Continental, Italian & Mediterranean dishes. like previous year this year also they introduced some delicious dishes which they’ll serve during puja days. special festive buffet with welcome drinks will be available from 26th September until 30th September, Lunch timing will be 12.30 p.m. – 4.00 p.m. & Dinner timing will be 7 p.m. to 11.30 p.m.

Aafra is already a well rated and one of the besi fine dining restaurants to dine at without making a hole in the pocket. This time Team Panchphoron was invited over for the Durga puja special menu launch here.

Details of the Special buffet

Date- from 26th September to 30th September
Timing - Lunch - 2:30 pm onwards
                Dinner- 7 pm onwards
Price- 999+ Tax

The special menu has been made keeping in mind the festive mood and traditional dishes. We tried a few items from the extensive menu-

Starters

•miniature of makuni paratha topped with sanpla narkol- Small paratha sized pockets filled with a paste of sanpla and coconut. 

•Lyoithya jhuri paranthas- Well loithya is not particularly my favorite fish but this one did taste nice. Imagine a spring roll with a filling of awesomely marinated loithya fish.

• Chicken kabiraji- good old kabiraji but the filling inside is that of chicken. Okayish in taste

Main course

•Palong chhenar kofta- Best dish for vegetarians. An Innovative dish consisted of small dumplings made from Spinach and cottage cheese cooked in a mild flavored gravy.

• Begun basanti- Eggplants cooked in a mustard based gravy, this failed to tickle my taste buds. Somehow the combination just did not click for me.

•Tel koi- How can a Bengali meal be complete without a fish preparation eh?Sure to give the calorie freaks a heart attack at the first sight this tasted really nice.Taste this Bengali dish and you will know why we are famous for our fish recipes. 

•Lagan ka murgh- Chicken pieces marinated superbly and then slow cooked in a thick gravy makes this an ideal side with the biriyani or plain rice. My personal favorite of the day.

•Old Kolkata style mutton biriyani- Quite okayish in terms of flavor and taste, contradictory to the super high expectations. The mutton pieces were soft though and the aloo too was perfect. The rice was too mild in flavor.

•Cauliflower roast with kadai spice

•Tulai panji rice- Flavored rice cooked to perfection, I daresay that this one better than the rice of the Biriyani. 

•Narkol diye cholar daal- the quintessential cholar daal which is a mandate for all  almost  all Bengali occasions this is the best vegetarian dish to pair up your kachori/luchi with. 

•Koraisuti r  kochuri- Small kachoris stuffed with a mixture of crushes peas and spices. 

Desserts
• Flavored rosogollas- These were so disappointing. It may be due to the flavors used but I felt that the chana used for the rosogolla was not quite fresh. 

Overall it was quite disappointing given the fact that it's Aafra we were dining at. The world class ambiance really can not cover up for the average tasting dishes and very ordinary mocktails. The huge number of dishes is sure to impress anyone but,  ironically most of them tasted okayish which is surely a huge turn off factor considering it's THE DURGA PUJA SPECIAL MENU.

Note-This is a genuine and unbiased review based solely on my dining experience and I sincerely  apologise for the not so high rating. But this place really needs to get out of the deep slumber  of "POPULARITY" and consider aspects like taste of the food and hospitality as serious concerns. It pains me to have such an ordinary dining experience from such a well rated restaurant, as I really do have a lot of expectations from this place. 

Thanks to the whole Team of Aafra for having us there. Looking forward to a much better experience:)

We Panchphoron team went there and tasted the following - 

1)Miniature of makuni paratha topped with sanpla narkol-
sanpla (water Lily 's stem ) is a Bangladeshi Cuisine's vegetable. They made a paste of it with indian Spice and coconut. And it was served with small Parthas (Indian bread) in continental style (like Pita Breads).
Presentation was so attractive but its taste like normal paratha and sabji.

2)Loyitta jhuri pantharas- Indian style Fish spring roll.
It was Delicious. Must try with your Drinks. 😉🍺

3)Chicken Kabiraji- Kabiraji cutlet is made of fish , meat or chicken, crumb coated and then deep fried. It was juicy inside and crispy outside .

It was yummy and juicy!!

Main course-

4)Palong chhenar kofta- Spinach cottage cheese  kofta curry is an exotic gravy-based dish. These spinach and Cottage cheese koftas (also known as pakoras or dumplings) are simmered in rich creamy tomato gravy making this a very delicious dish. 

Highly recommended with any indian Bread.

5)Begun basanti- Pan-fried eggplants in rich and creamy mustard- yogurt based sauce.

It didn't met my expectation. 😅

6)Tel koi- Tel koi fish in mustard oil lightly spiced with ginger and cumin and flavoured with nigella. 

7)Lagan ka murgh- Dum ka Murgh is also popularly known as Lagan ka Murgh in Hyderabad which is actually slow cooked marinated chicken in cashew and poppy gravy. The chicken is marinated in curd/yogurt and spices and later slow cooked which gives a rich colour and texture to the gravy. 

I miss the Gravy , which I expected 😅

8)Old kolkata style mutton biryani- The biriyani was light and mildly fragrant.

This was certainly not the best biriyani and the egg was missing!!

9)Cauliflower roast with kadai spice- it's a spicy dish with thick gravy and goes well with rice or paratha.

10)Tulai panji rice- It's govindobhog rice, which was well fragrant and non sticky.

I found a few small stones while eating. They should improve the quality of rice. Not expected !!

11)Narkol diye cholar daal- cholar dal is made with chana dal or bengal gram added with spices and coconut . It was thick and nice.

12)Koraisutir kochuri- Green peas stuffed Kochuri , which was well made and tasty.

Dessert
Rosogolla bar- 

Mango / anar/ beliful/ mango / chocolate- Different flavoured rosogolla which were soft and sweet with different colours. But the Flavour was not so prominent.

Thanks to the management for hosting us.

Afraa has always been on the rim of my bucket-list, whenever I'm here in my city. 😍
People generally say, "Laalach buri bhalaa hain". But, when you have certain delicious dishes dazzling in front of you, laalach will bloom automatically haha... 😜😜 Being a foodie, its tough to resist. Well, there are several buffet options and I tell you, this is NOT A ONCE IN A LIFETIME EXPERIENCE.... Once you come here, I'm pretty much sure that, you're gonna get addicted! That's all! 😘😉
I will post the pictures of the dishes I had, but quite later. Pehle jalne ki bhoo toh aane do 😂

Seven of us went there last Saturday to celebrate a birthday. Four of us are down with 2 of us suffering from serious bout of diarrhoea. Never had this kind of experience in any restaurant, leave alone in Afraa earlier.

Afraa lounge is one of the prettiest places in the city to have a lovely lunch. I have been here a couple of times, but my most special experience has to be the recent one, when I went in for a Sunday brunch with my friends. This brunch menu offers a wide array of dishes from different cuisines, as well as an unlimited supply of drinks, all at Rs. 999 (excl taxes). The restaurant aims to offer different flavours, all prepared with the best quality ingredients. The best thing about this place is perhaps is ambience and decor. Washed in the bright sunlight, your Sunday will leave you refreshed, especially in the open seating area in the terrace. So, if you're looking for a place to spend your Sunday with your friends or family, head straight to Afraa, and enjoy a lazy afternoon there!

The most happening lounge bar of the city! Over the years, the name Afraa has solidified in people's mind as a posh lounge, who do not conpromise on their quality! If you are happy with shelling out some bucks for the perfect experience, then this is the place to be! Be there, and all your weekly office load can vanish in one moment :D
My favourite place is the one on the outside, where they serve the hookah, and you get the city's view! One of the best feelings.

Afraa Restaurant and Lounge really needs no introduction. The famed restaurant of Salt Lake is located in  City Centre 1 and is known for its wide variety of items . They have serving delicious food for a long time and is the perfect place for a romantic date or a family lunch. The service is beyond amazing. 

We visited here for our Christmas Celebration.The buffet spread was fantastic,ranging from a wide range of salads to an exhaustive amount of cold cuts. The salads were prepared intricately by the chefs.The chicken and pork cold cuts were fresh. The dips and cheese were fresh and I can say without a doubt that Afraa serves the best cheese among all the buffet spreads in Kolkata.

The monk soup in the main course was delicious.You can add noodles,chicken,paneer etc to make it even more delicious. The chicken tikka on crispwafer was a delcious combo.The crisp wanton coated vindaloo marinated crisp fish finger was a delicacy. The Pressure ki kabuli wemt well with the mutton. In additon we ordered Cheese Kulcha which was tasty. 

From the live counter we had Roasted Turkey with Cranberry sauce which was  delectable. We also ordered Pizza Cones whose taste was mesmerising.

The dessert section had a plethora of dessert  such as plum ckae,fruit cake,mihidina,nolen gurer rosogolla,nolen gurer ice-cream. Each and every item were perfectly made.

Lastly, a special thanks to the management,the chefs and all the other workers at Afraa for their impeccable service with a smile.

Imagining where to have your brunch next Sunday? Afraa Lounge and Restaurant is the place. Just today I visited this awesome place and my experience was wow.
Perched atop the Block G of City Centre I, Afraa Lounge and Restaurant is sprawling, bright and breezy. This place has both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. You can choose to sit outside enjoying your brunch with the breath-taking view of the Salt Lake cityscape. Inside, the pristine white decor, with pops of colours and wood accentuating it, the fine glasses, and of course, the unending line of starters, salads, mains, desserts and even unlimited drinks and cocktails, gives one ample choice of indulgences to choose from.
With choicest of delicacies from Indian, continental, and Oriental origins prepared flamboyantly, it is impossible to move away from the lip smacking. The array of drool-worthy desserts in bite-sized portions were just the perfect, pretty little things. Be it the chocolate tarts, the rainbow cakes or the red velvet pastries, rosogollas or freshly cut fruits, there was something for everyone to love.
A Sunday well-spent brings in a week of content.
Beginning with the starters, I was carried away by the delicious Prawn Cocktail served at Afraa brunch. This was amazing considering the amount of prawn used, the perfect blend of mayonnaise and cocktail sauce; so naturally I could not help but get multiple servings of this one. This is one of my favorites.
Next, I absolutely loved the cold cuts and carvings served. There were entire lot of cold cut meat platter starting from bacon, ham, chicken legs, chicken breast portions and veggies. Grilled chicken and veggies were also at the buffet. I took several servings of these. Also, the Cheese Platter is to be mentioned, as it had varieties of cheese served, however, as I am on a specific diet these days, I avoided this platter this time.
Apart from all these starters at the buffet, paneer kebabs, chicken kebabs and fried wontons were served at our tables. All of them were freshly prepared, with the perfect spices and taste. I specially loved the crispy wontons.
Moving on to the main course, I was already near to a full stomach with all these deliciousness. The main course had plenty of options in Indian, Oriental and Continental dishes. I took some Mutton Biryani, some spicy Prawn curry, two pieces of chicken from the spiced chicken curry and some Fish in sauce, for my dose of main course that Sunday.
Coming to my favorite section, that’s desserts, I completely indulged myself in those yummy chocolate tarts, bread crumbs in gooey chocolate sauce, those colorful bits of cakes, pastries, flavored cheesecakes and a box full of Ferrero Rocher chocolates.
Be it the ambience of the place, the widespread food options for the brunch buffet or the unlimited cocktails / hard drinks / soft drinks, Afraa gives you enough reasons to choose this one for your Sunday brunch. Also, guess what all these are priced at? All of these at just ₹999/- plus taxes. Quite pocket friendly too!
My idea of a perfect Sunday brunch is well defined by Afraa. So guys, Afraa is the place where you need to be this Sunday for a delectable brunch with an amazing city view.

A lazy Sunday can be fun day with an exotic brunch with your family or friends. Just imagine a delicious spread of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes and colourful cocktails at a beautiful indoor-outdoor lounge. Not just delicious and lip-smacking food but with a view of the city, Afraa creates a perfect setting to enjoy a glass of wine and to catch up with your old friends. 
Worried about those choosy friends and the one who's palette changes with their mood? Then, Afraa has something for everything. You can choose between multiple courses and you can even mix and match. 
For me Prawn Newburg was tasting heaven, prawns marinated with parmesan gratin and baked. I loved the presentation of the food and the variety of dishes to choose from. And my advice, don't overload yourself with a lot of starters because the main course is even more better. And always keep room for the desserts! I re-lived my childhood days walking through the desserts section, series of pastries lined after one another and the chocolate fountain. Even though I was full, I had to dip one marshmallow in the chocolate fountain.
Now imagine, what's the whole package for your perfect Sunday? It's just INR 999 (exclusive taxes)!

Went to Afraa a couple of days back for an office dinner. They served a real good food. Taste was good. Served in a better way. Ambience was outstanding (perfect for date / candle night dinner).
Staffs were courtesies. Complementary chocolate paan was good. Will visit again for lobster.

Recommended
1. Betki piccata.
2. Tandoori prawn
3. Braised Lamb Shanks
4. Lobster Thermidor
5. Afraa's Signature desert

Con.
Must have enough time in hand while you are visiting. They take a long time to serve. But that worth the food.

I went there twice. On first time Lamb was bit salty. Second time the lobster. Don't know why.

i'm not a frequent lounge hopper or party animal, so decided to try afraa lounge on a chilled evening, the outdoor seating area pulled me more to this place.
great ambience and Loved the drinks , cocktails and sides that we ordered.

My experience could have been much more rocking like the night..only if the person serving us was a little patient and courteous knowing we were 1st timmers. May be he was more comfortable attending his regular known faces customers which I noticed.

First things first. We were invited here for a food tasting session over a sunday brunch. But, please don;t frown. this place is close to my house and we come here - often. Let me be honest. The food is good, but the view is fabulous. Many of its problems get covered up there. 

The sunday brunch is a buffet and is priced at 999++ (including unlimited alcohol). So, that is a deal. I've tried few items from the cold cuts section and they were pretty good including the lovely sea food cocktail. The egg was visually superb. In the main course, surprise element was the laccha parantha. Instead of atta, they've made it with maida and that had made all the difference. It was one of the best in town. The dal makhni was good and I'd suggest to not to miss the mutton biryani. The meat pieces were super soft and it was simply good. 

Overall a nice experience and definitely recommended.

Located on the 6th & 7th Floor of City Centre 1, the restaurant offers a breathe taking view of Salt Lake and also parts of the city. With glasses all around, the city skyline looks beautiful, and the restaurant on the other hand is bright and very well lit with the natural light. It décor is classy and elegant at the same time, and will give you a lot of positive vibes once you enter the property. 

I went for the Sunday Brunch, and had a wonderful experience. The cocktails, food and wine were best in class, with unlimited servings and there was no compromise in quality. The cocktails are prepared as per your favorite color, and once it’s served, it looks incredible. I am also uploading images of the same, so as to show that I am in no way exaggerating. 

The food was brilliant, as expected from Afraa, the spread was humongous with variety of Starters, International Antipasti’s, Cheese Platters, Meat Platters, variety of salads, soups… I am not finished yet, and then comes the Main with staples and accomplishments followed by the Interactive counter serving Wood Fired Pizzas, Exotic Risotto Bars. The Live Carving counter was churning out dishes like Royal Bengal Mutton Roast as well as Anar & Green Chilli Stuffed Tandoori Badami Aloo. 

The feast was concluded with desserts like Komola Bhog, Kancha Lonka Rossogolla and Chocolate Monte Carlo. This entire session was accompanied with generous and unlimited servings of wine, exclusive beers and cocktails.

The open air section of the restaurant is a breather and enjoying the wind and the cityscape with a wine glass is pure bliss.

#Afraa Restaurant And Lounge is situated at a perfect point of City Center 1, Sector 1, Salt Lake.The parking is easy at City Centre mall.

#This place totally rocks!The music and ambience blows your mind away.It has some kind of romantic atmosphere.Anyone can go there by himself and won't get bored for an uniquely beautiful decor and the whole contain.

#I have visited several times at the lounge section only.I personally like to spend time at the outdoor seating areaand enjoy my cocktails and the view.I am a frequent visitorhere.

#The happy hour time is 12:30pm to 8pm.My favourites are Green Apple Martini,Classic Margarita & Long Island Iced Tea.

#Green Apple Martini(400.00Rs)is a fruity Vodka Cocktail madeby blending Vodka,Green Apple Schnapps and Apple Juice.Thisdelicious version of a Martini is served in a Chilled Martini Glassand is garnished with thin slices of Apple.This delicious concoctionwill surely tantalize your taste-buds with its sweet and sour flavour.

#Vodka Lemon Drop Shots(550.00) are fun and kind of sweet sour shooters.My choice is Clear vodka for it.

#Bartenders and waiters serves here with a extremely good behaviour.
#I would love to visit the rooftop restaurant someday and explore the food over there.

It's over priced place almost like 5 star hotel without the same ambience. Ordered Thai curry which came to around 800 with taxes and it didn't  include the steamed rice which I had to order separately. Most places where you are paying for Rs. 800 serve curry with rice. The Lebanese platter was good but the pita bread size was smaller compared to the falafel. The service was good but I find the place pricey and not a value for money that is why the place was almost empty on a Saturday night. Would not recommend.

Simply amazing. Everything here is sorted. The ambiance is nothing too fancy but seems posh and elegant. The best thing about the ambiance is the glass windows that provide panoramic view and is simply amazing.
 The food is lip smacking. The drinks are even better.  Bloody Mary and Manhattan were the best. 
The staff is friendly and the service is fast and very good indeed. The sheesha we ordered has an issue and it was immediately replaced in a jiffy. 
The DJ was good. Not the best but yes well enough to tap a few steps. Good experience altogether.

Nice fine dining ambience,  ordered potato Rosti, sausage pizza,  and Aafra chilly garlic prawn spaghetti.. Nothing impressed me much,  the texture of the pizza was great,  thin crust the way I like it but there was no real flavour.. Rosti was okayish..they gave the spaghetti with bolognaise sauce,  I mean what were you thinking.. It wasnt mentioned bolognaise anywhere.. Was meant to be chilly garlic spaghetti. Needs a lot of improvement.

One of the best places to visit for a Sunday brunch.

Decor/Ambience: The decor, the ambience, the soft music makes up for a perfect brunch environment.

Staff: very courteous and attentive.

Food/Drinks: we opted for Sunday brunch with unlimited drinks and this is one of the places where unlimited drinks actually mean "unlimited", which is one of the highlights as they offer really awesome cocktails, another one of those places who do not compromise on the quality of their cocktails in offer.
So, we had the following drinks:
1. Cosmopolitan
2. Caprioska
3. Screwdriver
4. Blue lagoon
5. Beer

Coming to food, another highlight of this place is their salads and cold cuts. There are so many kinds of salads offered and all of them so fresh and delicious.

The starters were pretty good as well.

The main course was average and this is the only reason I am giving the place a 4 rating instead of 5. If they work on their main course a bit, this would be the BEST Sunday brunch place in the city.

The desserts were yummy and they had a good variety.

Overall:

Great place to spend time with loved ones. If you love salads and cold cuts, you should definitely visit this place for the brunch. My fiancé is in love with their brunch and we are definitely going back!

আপনার গন্তব্য।

কাঁচের দেওয়ালে ওপাশে একটা আস্ত আকাশ আর..ইলশেগুঁড়ি  বৃষ্টি..  বিদ্যুৎচমক...।

" বৃষ্টির চেতনায় ঘুমিয়েছিলাম..

তখন বৃষ্টি  হচ্ছিল।

বৃষ্টির  গুনগুন  ধ্বনি..

কানে আন্দোলিত  হচ্ছিল বারংবার।

বৃষ্টির ঘ্রাণ  বৃষ্টির  স্পর্শ

আমার অবলুপ্ত  চেতনাকে

পুলকিত  করছিল  শতবার"......।

খাবারের কথায় আসি।

ব্যুফেতে বিয়ারের গ্লাসে চুমুক দিয়ে শুরু  হলেও সেই উত্তাপ বেশিক্ষণ  স্থায়ি হল না। তবে পিৎজা এখানে 

ভাল। চীজ বা স্বাদ.. একে অপরের পরিপূরক ।  বাকি সাধারন.. পাস্তা, ফল, ফ্রায়েড চিকেন..।

মাঝ পাতের দৈর্ঘ্য খুবি ছোট। ফ্রায়েড রাইস, রাজমা, তরকা, বাটার পনীর, প্রন,  চিকেন আর রেলওয়ে

 মটন।
প্রন খুব ভাল। বেশ নধর সাইজ...ডায়েট করা  সাইজ জিরো না। রেলওয়ে  মটন..অল্প আঁচে সেদ্ধ হওয়া..

 নরম তুলতুলে  মাংস। অনেকটা মটন  রেজালার  মত।

শেষ পাত অতি সাধারন। তিন  চারটে  পদ।  এত ভাল পরিবেশ..  কিন্তু  খাবারে মন ভরল কই?।

স্টাফদের ও ঢিলেমি নজরে পড়ল।

আর খাবারের পাত্রতে পরিমান ও কম করে দেওয়া। বারবার খাবার শেষ হয়ে যাচ্ছিল। 

প্রকৃতির  ডাকে সাড়া দিতে যেতে পারি দ্বিতীয়বার খাবারের ডাকে নয়।

I along with Indrajit Ghosh went there on 27.07.17 and opted for lunch buffet...We entered the place by 12.30 and they were about to start their service..Location wise I will rate this place as 4.5 but the food over here is so so..I mean we were dissatisfied with the food over here..For starter they gave fish tikka And trust me it was very hard to gulp inside your stomach..And there was another veg stater which was okay okay type..They have huge variety in their salad counter and we enjoyed chicken coleslaw salad..In the Main course I tried every dishes but nothing was impressive apart from the mutton...
They have huge options in dessert section and they were really good...So whatever rating I have given it is only for their dessert items.
P.s Dear Afraa My fiancé took me to afraa to celebrate my birthday ..And you thoroughly disappointed us ..

Visited Afraa for the much heared about Sunday Brunch with unlimited cocktails.. The starters included a fish dish, a veg dish, Pizza, Pasta. There were an array of salads and cold cuts. The main course included an array of dishes out of which I liked the baked fish the most. The desserts were sinful! Afraa has courteous staff who are eagerly waiting to serve you. The ambiance was of course the USP. Will visit again.

One of the best places to visit for a Sunday brunch.

Decor/Ambience: The decor, the ambience, the soft music makes up for a perfect brunch environment.

Staff: very courteous and attentive.

Food/Drinks: we opted for Sunday brunch with unlimited drinks and this is one of the places where unlimited drinks actually mean "unlimited", which is one of the highlights as they offer really awesome cocktails, another one of those places who do not compromise on the quality of their cocktails in offer.
So, we had the following drinks:
1. Cosmopolitan
2. Caprioska
3. Screwdriver
4. Blue lagoon
5. Beer

Coming to food, another highlight of this place is their salads and cold cuts. There are so many kinds of salads offered and all of them so fresh and delicious.

The starters were pretty good as well.

The main course was average and this is the only reason I am giving the place a 4 rating instead of 5. If they work on their main course a bit, this would be the BEST Sunday brunch place in the city.

The desserts were yummy and they had a good variety.

Overall:

Great place to spend time with loved ones. If you love salads and cold cuts, you should definitely visit this place for the brunch. My fiancé is in love with their brunch and we are definitely going back!

Located in City Centre 1 Salt Lake.
The ambience of the place is very good with a great view of the city. I went for office lunch so had buffet. The starters were that not great and certainly the platter lacks choices. But I must admit there were lot of options in salad. The main course was also good but not that great. In desert they were very few options. There was only chocolate scoop in ice cream.
Considering the price, they surely don't offer much variety on the platter. There are other better options.

Afraa has been our favourite lounge in salt lake for years now , bluish lightings , well stocked bar and open air view form the ninth floor is simply one outstanding combination . The booze and food are priced on the higher side but quality is never compromised. The restaurant on the upper level has an uniquely beautiful decor and the food is essentially awesome. I have attended several parties , the new year bashes on consecutive years , i personally thank Mr. Deepak Hazra the manager in charge who excels in his job and took good care of our entire group throughout the night.

We went with my office collegues for office lunch. We booked from earlier, if its around 30+ then please book for lunch or dinner from earlier. 
The roof top place is just wow!!! You can see yuva bharati stadium and 2nd hoogly bridge also. The decoration is so so, but the rooftop for party is awsum just.

Coming to food, we had buffet, the price with tax 750, the food quality not up to the mark. In buffet one veg starter, one non- veg starter and drinks@. The main course is not up to the mark. All item like chicken, mutton, rice, noodles everything was there. Desert is good, i like chocklet mouse, pastry and golub jamun.

The last one is service, this is not good, they even did not give so much spoon on table. Service should be better with compare to price.

Went there @12 pm. They were just opening. We just wanted to have a hookah and a quick nibble. But the hookah maker had not yet arrived, thus ordered a lemonade and nachos. The server there should be given some training in how to interact with guests. When I asked him, would it be possible to serve the nachos with chicken for which we'll pay extra, he actually laughed on my face and said-- that is not how Nachos are made. Disgusting attitude. Would like to visit again only for the view and the outdoor seating. But if that cheeky guy is there, won't even enter the premise.

Both of them were equally good and sumptuous. Two can be easily shared among three people.

Even the Pulao on the main course impresses. The Thai Noodles, lasagna and the prawn disappointed big time. The variety of chicken, vegetables, cheese and a lot of other items on the salad spread made it all worth for me.

The lighting is too bright and not @ all like a candlelight dinner one! The ambience is otherwise really nice. The service was good though. It cost Rs.7000 for a sumptuous dinner for 3.

Last night we went for our team dinner at this place. We opted for buffet with unlimited drinks. The ambience was really impressive. The dinner area was beautifully decorated. We had chicken kebabs and crispy baby corn for starters, which were average in taste. In main coarse, there was rice, rotis, dal makhani, mix veg, chicken and fish. We all loved the fish preparation. They Gulaab jamun, Monte Carlo ice cream in dessert.

But back then say around a year and a half, the crowd was very esteem and the place used to have a high aura.
Their parties were quite happening and even in normal days the place used to have a house full gathering.
The seats which were in the outdoor area ( open area ) were most preferable by the public as the atmosphere was way too good.
Food - pizza - unbeatable
Shisha - was a bit pocket pinch but great

The overall experience of visiting this place will surely leave you spellbound. Although I should admit that I was here for an office party and we had a big group with us but the ambience,setting and the facilities at this place will surely impress even the most hard-boiled critic.
From live sport screenings to the dance floor, from hookahs to open bar, from the iconic neon lighting to the comfy couches, this place has it all but surely the mvp of this place is the outside seating and the wonderful view of the city that comes with it. It is an experience worth the expense.
The prices are a bit on the higher side and not every item you would find in the buffet would draw you to a Linguini flashback so please keep your expectations in check with the food quality but it is acceptable and at a satisfactory level to a certain extent to say the least.

But yes afraa is a must visit and it is certainly one of the best group outing pub-like places in the city. For the quintessential enthusiast this place is sure to provide a long lasting wonderful impression.

We had our family weekend lunch here last Sunday. The buffet offered was a lavish affair with sizzling appetizers (fish, chicken and vegetables), chilled beer and soup. Wide array of choices in the main course left us spoilt for choices (especially duck-roast !!! ) along with the regular delights. Delightful desserts (choco fountain dip) caught fancy of the kids, who kept rushing for more..... We had a great time catching up with the cousins and spending the afternoon together in a leisurely environment. Highly recommended.

The restaurant has a beautiful decor entirely in white and we went there on a Saturday for lunch. It was already close to three pm and they were about to close for that afternoon so they asked us to opt for the buffet or order ala carte by 3 pm. We chose the later option and ordered Pork three ways, signature nasi goreng and pasta in chicken and bacon. Each item was amazing in taste and the presentation was impeccable. The pasta was loaded with ample amount of chicken and bacon. Pork three ways was the stand out dish for sure where bacon wrapped chicken was the best. We didn't ordered any desert just teamed up this perfect lunch with sweet lime soda. Next time we would like to opt for the buffet for sure.

We had our family weekend lunch here last Sunday. The buffet offered was a lavish affair with sizzling appetizers (fish, chicken and vegetables), chilled beer and soup. Wide array of choices in the main course left us spoilt for choices (especially duck-roast !!! ) along with the regular delights. Delightful desserts (choco fountain dip) caught fancy of the kids, who kept rushing for more..... We had a great time catching up with the cousins and spending the afternoon together in a leisurely environment. Highly recommended.

I had an al-a-carte dinner yesterday evening at Afraa Restaurant. The ambiance was quite good (though was so poorly lit at our table that we had to switch on mobile torch to see the menus) and most of the foods were excellent. Only a few things concerned me which I wanted to convey here. The first thing is cost of the drinks. Each and every drinks (mocktails, soft drinks, fresh lime soda) are surprisingly overpriced. A mocktail costs Rs.350 was so tasteless, blunt and icey that our Rs. 15 frooty tastes better that that. A glass of thumbs-up costs 150 and so on. The main food items are costlier than any established restaurant in park st. area (like Mocambo) though the quality was at per with them. Like a paneer butter masala plate costs Rs.650 and a single naan costs Rs.180, which I think is undoubtedly the highest in Kolkata (for the grade of resturant this is). Not sure I shall be there (for a al-a-carte dinning) anymore. For a al-a-carte it came around Rs.1800 per person for our dining. Thanks for reading through.

Very bad service, worse food, awful songs and wrong drinks! I can understand Saturday nights might be crazy but that doesn't mean the server would just rush the food, slamming it infront of your face without even asking whether you would like it to be served or not. We were sitting at the roof top and everytime we wanted something had to go in and ask for a server. The Dj tonight was even worse, played unlimited cheap songs. Felt like I was in Chandni bar or something. The cocktails I ordered had a higher quantity of alcohol than required making the cocktails so bitter. In the end after waiting long for a server to send us our bill they come up to us and say their card machine is not working. Our bill was around 3500 how can you expect someone to carry that much cash in days like these?!?! On top of everything they ask us "kya kiya jaye ab?" Like seriously??? You have such a lounge and you have only one single card machine? Atleast the server brings another machine after lying to us of having a single machine. Really hopeless! Waste of money!!

Being a foodie I always love to review different food joints (promote unofficially :p :p). The foremost thing about this place to hit my mind is its awesome romantic ambience. the joint offers a cosy atmosphere with classy decor which gives you ideal environment to spend quality time with your loved one. taking selfies also comes a major concerning issue for gals now and things trigger up when you get such a lovely decor. now comes to food. well this place is mainly suitable for them who would like to give their taste buds a change from the traditional spicy foods of India to medterrain.  just as every time I have a habit to forget names of item :( I hope you guys can make out from the picture. The chicken was very soft, delicious but I expected to be little more spicy. However, salsa was served to it with two pieces of nuggets . According to me it would have been much better if the charges were not overpriced. I would like to revisit this place and order some other easily pronounced soft drink. :) :)

First exp. going for a buffet lunch @afraa.

Well furnished and well designed restaurant.

Staffs are very friendly and well mannered and helpfull.

Talking about food.

Their buffet story are different from other buffet restaurant @Kolkata.

Starter: 4/5
Main course: 2/5
Desert: 3/5.


Starter: huge collection + good taste.

Complimentary lime soda or beer.

Live Pasta Counter Also Available.

Talking about main course, most of the items were too taste less. মুরগি,পাঠা আর মাছের নিজেদের রান্না টেস্ট করলে লজ্জা পেয়ে যেত।😂.

Deserts are good. But some deserts are too sweet.

I went here a few weeks ago, on a Wednesday afternoon to try their buffet. If you do not have a reservation, you might want to drop in early.
I loved their ambience. The restaurant's beautiful and service is polite and fast.
As for food, if you don't have a cuisine preference, this is the place to go. They serve bits and pieces of pretty much everything, starting from Dal Makhani, to Pizzas and Pastas and Noodles. The taste will probably not make your jaw drop, but it's pleasant. However, the fish and chicken in the main course did not really taste great. Sometimes it was a little bland. But still, good quality food. My favourites were their thin crust pizzas, their huge array of salads and their desserts were fantastic. They will serve a mocktail/beer with your meal too.
I would suggest them to serve better tasting food, since they are aiming to give you a fine dining experience, but except that little tweak, I had a good experience.

I have been a big fan of Afraa. But then what happened just now is disgusting. We go to Afraa because of the lovely open air ambience. Me and my wife visited today at 7.50 pm as the weather was really good. The tables outside to the left were occupied and they asked us to take one of the tables to the right. The table over there was stinking. The kind we get outside a public urinal. I called the person and communicated the issue and he said it was just cigarette smell. Now I am a smoker and I very well know how cigarette smoke smells. Next we went inside and enquired if any of the tables outside would be available soon. Almost immediately a four seater to the left was vacated and we were elated. But then the person over there made a frustrated face and said "ota four seater ache". They clearly had no intention to allow us to take that seat but seemingly complied when I said that 2 seaters arent available. They were still wanting to push me to the table that was stinking. In the mean while I noticed it was 7.56 and I should make the order to avail the happy hours. To my dismay the person at the counter said that "happy hours hobe na, 8.02 baje." He also said that the table which was vacated is not vacant, and some other story. I said that its still 4 minutes to 8 and how can he say that the happy hours are over. He just ignored and left along with the manager who turned his back. I did not want to lose my cool and simply came out of this place.  Its 8.10 now as I type this. This was perhaps my 20th visit to this place and its sad that this long relationship is over. I used to recommend it to a lot of people but then I dnt see myself doing that as well. Quite a shame. Unprofessional to the core.

Afraa was once an impressive option for every foodie, but guess with time a number of good continental options were made available at affordable price which marred the charm of it somewhat. But one thing which beats every other restaurant in town is the great location it has got. Glass walls gives impeccable 360 degree view of the city centre and the nearby area, was truly awestruck with the view.  
We went for the buffet lunch, starters were great, with a number of options of pizza, fries, noodles. Additionally there was a salad counter, where you can make your own stuff. 
The main course was somewhat dull and boring to be frank.
Desserts were nice but nothing extraordinary except my favourite Red Velvet! <3
The price per person was around 900 with tax on a weekend. Later we regretted not having ala carte.

Oh what a serene atmosphere it was. Felt like literally I was talking to the clouds! Situated on the 7th floor of G-block of city centre 1, this place is a delight with it's ravishing and lip smacking buffet lunch at an extremely pocket friendly price (Nearbuy coupons). With a posh decor, blissful ambience and courteous staff, it is nothing but paradise. Elaborate menu covering almost every type of cuisine, veg and non-veg, extensive spread of salads, mouth watering desserts platter and to top it all a pint of beer... What else is needed for a beautiful afternoon lunch. Kudos indeed! Would definitely like to visit Afraa again and recommend one and all the same! Value for money!

The cocktails they serve are to die for! I would totally recommend this place for the kind of crowd it attracts (which is not at all creepy, and hence, one of the biggest concerns of us ladies is taken care of right there) and for the kind of ambiance it provides!

If you are longing for a cosy fancy candlelight dinner and a nice time Afraa is always the place for you. Exactly why I had my birthday dinner yesterday over here. Started off with the Turkish Chicken Shashi Kebab served with yellow sauce and mashed potatoes. The dish was tasty though nothing new or exotic as the name suggests. The steller of the meal was their braised lamb Shanks. Such lovely meat cooked to perfection. Being a lamb lover I solemnly swear that was one tasty dish, they were quite generous with the size of the chops as well. Ended the meal with a lovely Copa Lolita, served with macaroons, fruits over a lovely toffee almond custard. In the drinks Blue Lagoon was too much on the sweeter side while the other one with Peach and Melon was quite refreshing. The staff is always very well behaved and courteous here at afraa but we did have to wait for the dessert for a long long time.

I had been to afraa deli earlier but this was my first time at the lounge and restaurant and I was quite impressed. The outdoor seating is beautiful but ended sitting inside as there was no place... so booking recommended. 
Coming to food do try the seesh kebabs... it's outstanding. Tender pieces of chicken, perfectly marinated with spices and served with grilled veggies fries and a bread. For main course had the barbecue pizza. It's was a perfect think crust pizza with generous helping of topping. But the best part of the meal was the dessert.. the dark chocolate brownie with ice cream. This probably the best I have had in a long time. It's extreme tasty.. must must must try! 
Overall lovely place  a bit expensive but worth it.

Had a great brunch with 2 friends whom I owed a feed. Zomato says to indicate whether it was a free meal (complimentary). No, not at all. Paid for.
The cheeses were excellent, the bread unbelievely good with the mustard mayo - sinful. The rest super, I mention the items I found way above. I would give 4.9 if the slot existed. Not giving 5 because I think that is unrealistic for any place, but close enough.

The best part of the restaurant it's decoration and the glass view of the outside. You can have a nice photo session as well after eating your food.  Therefore our social day becomes more memorable with all those nice snaps with the beautiful background.

I have seen so much reviews of this Lounge from the top reviewers in Kolkata and feel that I should write something out of the way.

This place isn't just about food,mocktails,cocktails or brunch but more about a distinctive culture that has been engineered and pioneered in the heart of Salt Lake city and stands iconic today.

I remember those times as a college goer when partying and resto pub meant flocking to the Park Street in Kolkata and we hadn't much in this part of the city other than that of the newly set up Nicco Park and the Jheel Meel extension in today's Sector V approach.

What they really transformed was a place in the heart of the then newly crafted City Centre Phase 1, a culture to honour the right of every good citizen to spend good time in privacy unwinding with good 
food and eatery.

Soon the lounge became popular with events,mostly in the weekends, the Friday night culture stepped in and this place was a hit gradually.

As I see this place getting transformed in the by gone 5 years , I  remember of having school parties twice, lazily unwinding with school friends after 25 long years into the ambience of open air or a sinking couch and hopping in and out of the place aĺl throughout the day to have a grab of either a green apple mocktail or saute Chinese greens or prawns in black pepper sauce.

I do remember tha some of the finest brands of wine and beer signatures were first , to be introduced within the reach of the masses.

People have always been my attraction, and they are the ones whose energy makes this space happening. 

Avishek, Palash and a host many faces, some working and some left , has transformed this space into a GenX culture propaganda and launched it right in the heart of many.

I strongly recommend and request the management to get many of these boyz back right here, to take this space to the top of the chart.

If you are in the mood for fancy dinner then the Afraa is definitely an option to ponder.  Everything from the luxurious decor to the soft-spoken waiters puts this joint among the best fine dining restaurants in the city. Located on the 7th floor right above its well-known sister the Afraa Deli in City Center, the restaurant is carefully hidden from the madding weekend crowd. To be honest, I was expecting the food to be pretentious and exorbitantly priced. We ordered pork chops and tiramisu and boy were we in for a treat. The portion size was fit for a lumberjack while the preparation had all the delicacies of a 5-star restaurant. I am talking about mashed-potatoes-lined-with-bitter-chocolate-level delicacy. The star of the meal were the pork chops which were cooked to perfection to retain the desired blend of succulence and flavor. Did I mention there was live music playing? Yeah! that too. In the end, the bill seemed justified and we will almost certainly revisit.

Been here today for anniversary lunch.Had ordered Nasi goreng and poppy sseds encrusted chicken morsels.surprisingly the chicken morsels had same taste as chicken satay of nasi goreng, apart frm chicken pieces could not find any other thing in nadi goreng, did not have the flavour as well.The waiters were more interested in the buffet lunch.I had a delightful experience of Afraa in all instances earlier...however was thoroughly disappointed today

A lovely lounge cum discotheque located in city center 1. Love the ambiance and specially the outdoor seating option which oversees the city. Just the perfect place to chill with friends. I ordered for a non-veg kebab platter which turned out to be very good. It consisted mutton galouti kebab , fish mahi tikka , chicken reshmi kebab and tandoori prawn. You get one of the best sheesha in town over here. Not to  forget the music which is fantastic too. Slightly on the expensive side but worth it. Overall an amazing experience!😊

I went for the Little app voucher for the lunch buffet. Loved the ambience but the service wasn't good at all. Very slow. Soup bowls missing. Breads arriving 10mins after we started the main course. Waiters weren't interactive much.

Gist : Big place with nice view with good buffet at reasonable price with many tasty items.

I visited this place on 26.1.17 around 1.20PM. Bit tricky to find (Actually I entered in City Center Mall from a different gate). The restaurant is on 7th floor and has a nice view from the top & decorations are good (some repairing is going on 6th). The restaurant is spacious and can accommodate almost 60 people (14*4+ 2*6) with a big table with a seating capacity of 14 people. Washroom is small & can accommodate one person. Opted for the buffet. Staffs are cordial. Starter, Main Course & dessert all equally good and options are so many. They presented items splendidly. Welcome drink was great as opted for a Fresh Lime Soda, but it was taken at the end. They do not serve ice cream but have a live pasta counter. Will definitely visit again.

Note : Due to limit, all photos can not be uploaded.

What to write about this place 🤔 it's one of the most popular &happing place in town... so my suggestion  is for those foodies who haven't tried this one yet 
"go and book a table now "
amazing ambiance , extremely friendly and efficient staff but the the real deal is the buffet lunch ... from the staters  to  dessert every thing is just delicious .... 
the buffet includes 
1 Veg Soup : 3.5 ( with chicken add on)
1 Veg Starter : skipped  1 Non-Veg Starter :   4 (crispy  fried chicken item served on the table) 4 Veg Salads : 3 2 Non-Veg Salads : 4 1 Rice : 3 4 Veg Main Courses 
2 paneer dish :3.5 
One mix veg dish : 2 3 Non-Veg Main Courses 
Chicken, Fish & Mutton :4
4 Desserts : 5
The dessert section is pretty wow from pastries to  mousse to tarts everything is a just fab.

I took my relatives and friends for a party on 21-Jan-17 and was carrying nearbuy deals. There was a mocktail free with the lunch but I was charged for 11 more mocktails although I was not informed that at what point it was made chargeable. I did not like this pricing policy as I expect anything chargeable should be called out to the customer in the beginning and customer should not be shocked at the end with a fat bill which is entirely overcharge..this behaviour seemed quite unethical to me and unprofessional.

Went there with two other guys and according to them it's a great place for hookah. They ordered some liquor and I ordered for double apple with apple base. The hookah was nice and had a good essence. The staff was good but a bit on the slower side. They took almost 30 mins for changing the coal albeit being not so crowded. 
Overall a good experience and I would recommend it for a weekend fun with friends.

I expected a lot from Afraa but today's experience was kind of a let down. It was a perfect winter evening and i visited this place with some friends of mine. Situated in City center, Afraa Restaurant and lounge has three sections. It has the ground floor, which is an outdoor seating area. Next is the 6th floor which has both indoor and outdoor seating area, and 7th floor ( which i havent been and therefore, have no idea whatsoever ). We sat on the 6th floor, outside. We were seated for 5 mins in the inside section because they were clearing the table for us, which was fine. What majorly disappointed me was how unprofessional the servers were in taking the orders, in providing the service to us and the way of communication. The service tonight was pretty slow for some reason, we waited for more than half an hour for our dessert. The food, however, was fantastic. The pasta was absolutely delicious, so was the pizza and hot wings. Hookah was nice and smooth, no choking. However, virgin mojito was a bit too sour but it was alright. Overall, the bill came up to around rs3500. Would i visit this place again? Hopefully i will, because i would really like to change my review here again.

A eyes shut choice for a good continental dinner...  This place never disappoints..  We were 7 people yesterday for the 2 of them afraa was the first time...  And they loved it as well...  We ordered mix of Indian and Italian .. Black daal and panner as the starter defiantly the takeaway...  From the continental lamb chops was very well taken by one of our dutch friends... So a big thumbs up from my end 
Disappointments umm.. I would put restrictive desert menu...(but of course we were late so not entirely the restaurant's fault) other than that excellent

They don't understand the concept of birthdays
They can't get you a cake from their own store downstairs 
They don't know what "polite" means
They don't let you pop a popper, even if it was outside the lounge in the terrace, because "We will have to clean it after you"
They forget that you ordered pizza
They even forget that you're there, waiting for the waiter to return, while he is smoking away a pipe of shisha in a corner...

Wow... Such an amazing place!

One of my favourite places when it comes to hanging out in Saltlake. I love the ambience and the food. In my opinion the brunch is a must try if you are here for lunch, as it  is a steal. Also worth having is the Happy Hour offer that is one of a kind with ranging from 12pm - 8pm. This is a great offer as it gives people with a penchant for drinking after office on those stressful days a relief. 

Looking to come back for more

A fine dining place in true sense...  Comfortable chairs with a wonderful outdoor view.. We visited this place on 1st January for new year lunch..  Food is excellent,  though i feel the service time is little on the longer side..  
Afra mixed meat as starter: 5/5..  Can't say a thing against it
Fish and chips: 4.5/5
Murg tikka makhani: 4/5
Garlic naan: 4/5 
The rating is cut for not serving hard drinks on 1st January lunch.. That was unexpected

Backstory: I'm a visitor of this place for the last 3 years. I've seen the greatest of great and the worst of worst in here, all happening.

Your first impression: If you are not a person who is very hard to please, you will murmur - WOW. This place is spacious, has a contemporary urban feel, with lot of empty floor space to walk, crawl and dance.

Impression over a continuous period of time: Nice place, nice music, predictable crowd, helpful staff, parking always available and good food...most of the days ;). I used to come here every Saturday  when they used to offer unlimited Scotch for a super reasonable package. Good old days gone now. Food is above average than similar places in Salt Lake.  Terrace facing opening air sitting at 6th floor is cool.

Summary: At this place to properly get drunk with some quality food and music you need to have at least 6K in pocket.

Went to Afraa for the Christmas dinner. The ambiance was amazing, it was neat. With Soft music .. The food was good i would say . Ordered for Pork 3ways, Turkish Chicken Shish kebab and good old chili blast chicken (chilli chicken, which I thought was way to expensive) along with Buds and a red wine.  Desert was the best of the lot, we ordered Oozing Dark choco cake and copa lolita.
That being said I felt (personal opinion) the food option/selection was lil less also the service was slow.

They served us orley fish. The fish was fresh and the preparation was tasty. They have a good salad counter. The mutton preparation was okay. The desserts were good.

I'm a little late in reviewing this one! Visited the Afraa Restaurant located on the 7th floor of CC1 Saltlake in Sashti evening for thei r dinner buffet! The decor is beautifully done. The music and candle lights give a romantic turn to the atmosphere. The outdoor view is spectacular!! You can see the entire Salt Lake City from top, and it's breathtaking!!!

Coming to the food : The starters consisted of a good spread of salad along with aloo tikki and prawns
The aloo tikki and prawns were simply HEAVENLY!! The BEST I have had till date. 
Coming to main course : They had a good spread of Chinese and Indian cuisine. The basha maach and mutton biriyani were too good!!!
The desert spread was great too!! But I found them too sweet in spite of having a sweet tooth.

Overall a very satisfying experience!!! Would love to visit again......

Absolutely pathetic...went there on a saturday evening, first they told us there was no place to sit outside at 10.45pm and we have to wait to have hookah, finally we get a place to sit at 11.15 and order a hookah and starters which they happily take; after taking the order they come to us 10min later to inform us the lounge is closing and the music stops and all lights have been switched on. As soon as they serve us the starters a server comes to tell us to hurry up as we have to close, we literally had to tell the staff that the starters are hot so please give us time to at least finish what we ordered, when they gave us few minutes before staring down our necks. This was absolutely unexpected from the staff and had they just told us at the time of our first order that they will close at 11 so we need to place all orders straight away we could have planned our evening accordingly, but thanks to afraa our evening and the afraa experience was absolutely ruined!!!!

Went for a Lunch at Afraa Resturant with siblings. The food quality was extremely good. Nothing like I've had before. Started with a Turkish Rashmi Kebab. Then had Speghetti with the salmon.
We were almost the last customers for the noon. But still we were treated well. The service was quick.
Above all the best thing about the restaurant was its ambiance. On the 7th Floor, large glass windows allowed lots of sunlight to pour in, making the place well lit. I don't know how it looks in the night, but I have a feeling that the mornings are better.

Have been visiting Afraa regularly since the last 5 years but the level of service and its niche - the fine dine ambience has come down considerably.

Was there yesterday, a Sunday, in the restaurant for a peaceful dinner but the beats and bass from the lounge below was so loud that it could be felt upstairs. On one end the gentleman was playing soothing tunes on the violin and at the other the bass from the lounge. Was just killing the ambience.

The warmth quotient of the waiters has come down considerably in comparison as well. This is or was not Afraa.

 For all goodness, the food, however with a revamped menu holds its stature in the disintegrating environment otherwise.

Khow suey soup 🍜 - presentation is fantastic. They serve it in the traditional style with the ingredients and the curry separately.

Mushroom 🍄 soup 🍜 - lacked flavour.

Veg platter - was served cold. Needs to be warmer. Paneer tikka stands out.

Thai Green Curry 🍛 with rice 🍚 : fantastic. Excellent flavours.

Would have rated it highly for old times sake but last experience just stops me to do so.

Keep munching!!!

Ciao!! 🍷🍷

Clean dining room. Polite and courteous waiters.
I found the service a bit slow. We had to wait a long time before our first starters arrived.
We ordered Tandoori fish, tandoori prawns, gulawati kabab as starters and lobster thermidor.
Food was excellent apart from the gulawati kabab which I found a bit sour and needs a bit of sweetness in the paratha. 
Lobster thermidor was great, served with home style fries and shredded salad, drizzled with vinaigrette. Tandoori fish and prawns were fabulous.
Overall experience was good.

Been here a few times. The food platter has lot to offer but the expense becomes quite a lot. And one suggestion would be that why don't we have an option for some Dance as the ambience has been created in such a way that I feel there should be option for some kind of High Voltage Music & Dance for youngsters (Of course following all Protocols of Decency).Not quite impressed with the food but the ambience is electric coz of the Open Roof Top option where you can have a smoke as well along with Shisha on a Breezy-Drizzling-Rainy evening/night.My Comment : Too Expensive to visit too often.

We had gone here to have the lunch buffet.
And undoubtedly one of the best and wholesome lunch buffet in the city.😊
There is a wide range of starters.🍴
The starters include soup,pasta,pizza,varieties of veg and non veg salad,fried rolls,salamis,corns and complementary Foster or cold drinks on each buffet.
The maincourse was equally amazing with rice,noodles,chicken,fish.
And the desserts were simply love. 😍
The pastries,mousse,gulabjamun and what else.
The interiors are very beautiful perfect enough for romatic lunch.❤

I went to Afraa with the intention of having great Pizza. It was something I hadn't encountered in Kolkata yet outside the chain stores a la Domino's, Pizza Hut etcetera. I ordered the Traditional The Margherita Pizza, it was good. It wasn't as good as you'd expect from a place like this. Pizza from Domino's is better. The ambiance and the service was excellent. If you're looking just for good Pizza this is not the place for you.

My and one of my friend went there to celebrate a special occasion and thoroughly enjoyed the buffet. Since ala carte is very expensive here and buffet is very cheap we opted for buffet and during our 2 hour stay we saw that every one in the restaurant was indulged in having the buffet, that means buffet is very popular here and why not? when they can serve such delicious food at such a low rate of 599 plus tax including a drink then why should people skip the buffet?? It was a monday so the restaurant was around 30% full so I dont think one needs prior reservation here. Beer/lime soda/soft drink will be served first. We took lime soda which was great. there was two types of soups, 5-6 types of salads. For starter chili fish and paneer tikka was served in the table. For main course there were peas pulao, plain rice, veg chowmin, veg maharani, paneer makhani, veg manchurian, veg au gratin, dal makhani, mutton kasha, one chicken item and one fish item(forgot the name), bread item as per order..To our surprise all the food items, both veg and nonveg were excellent. Loved all the items equally. Dessert section was also rich, there were assorted pastries, tarts, chocolate cake, mousse, gulab jamun etc but didn't see any ice cream!  599 plus tax is very cheap for the high quality of food they serve. Service and hospitality were excellent, soft music was playing in the background. Thoroughly enjoyed our outing here at afraa restaurant.

I had to delete my previous review to add a fresh one as Zomato doesn't allow to write more than one review. This review is for a Corporate party that we went to on 24th November at Afraa Lounge. It was for about 40 people and we had booked Afraa because we wanted to make a change from our regular party zones. 

Firstly, the manager Somnath, was extremely helpful and understanding. He got us the chef and designed the Menu as per our tastes - a mix of Indian and Continental and allowed us changes even after confirmation. 

The food was amazing on the day. I would rate it a 4.9 out of 5. All the dishes were fabulous. The service was also great. The staff were very helpful and prompt. A special mention is warranted for the Bartender - Ali. He was the star of the night. He prepared some fabulous Cocktails and mocktails which  totally set up the night for us. Also the DJ was great. All in all a great place to organize Corporate parties.

Afraa, for me is kind of a boring place to be around.

The interiors are highly monotonous. The blue light takes away the glory. Their white sofas are super uncomfortable. Super formal-ish overall. Would never want to sit inside.

The outdoors are nice. It's calming sitting there on a wintry evening with a couple of drinks.

Overall - Highly expensive food, super monotonous interiors.

Went today for a get together with some of my best buddies. Must say ambiance is superb with dim light and music, quality of food is good but service was not up to the mark. For making a single order, I had to raise hands multiple time and if they come then they were late with deliveries. Can't afford to visit again for dining but if the service improves then  will think of that...

Firstly let's discuss about the good sides. The interior, ambience and management team were absolutely spot on. Now moving on the food I must say it's a bit overhyped. We tried out the buffet during the durga pujas but the dishes were very average in taste. Only the dessert section was up to the mark. Would expect something better next time.

Oh Afraa! You are beautiful! Guys - Try everything and try different things every time you go. A tad expensive but I guess we can make do once in a while ;-) 
From their non veg grilled platter to their small bites like chilli cheese toast and fish fingers - everything is heart melting. You have to try their penne with smoked chicken and of course the orgasmic molten chocolate cake! Eat away in glory!

Its my 3rd time visit in Afraa with two of my friends. I don't want to talk about the ambience on the 7th floor because you all know that its a wonderful place to dine with your loved once and it gives a wonderful top view of our beautiful city. 
On last Saturday, I tried to call Afraa around 11.30 am and asked them to reserve our seats for lunch buffet. They told us that they are just opening and no need of reserving on that day. We reached around 2 PM there and got one wonderful 4 seater beside the large glass window. We opted for buffet.

They welcomed with a welcome drink. (Sweet lime/ Foster Pint Beer). On the starter they provided- paneer tikka, crispy fish pakora, chicken pizza. As they were preparing and serving these starters, requested us to start  with variety of salads with your selection of toppings. The best part is you can add the toppings as per your requirement. There is extra mayo, extra cheese everything is perfect and according to your need. Then comes the starters..hot and crisp with a dusted red chilly seasoning.
Once we are done with starter and salads, we navigated through main courses. On that day they had veg soup, lemon rice, methi paneer, mixed veg, kashmiri aloo, baked fish with lemon,chilly chicken and mutton ghost. Before this, my assumption was the main courses will be a little okayish as they are prepared on a huge quantities. But, afraa made my assumption wrong. All the recipes were finger licking good and pefectly balanced. Only one observation- I felt that chilly chicken was a little bit salty.
On the desert, we had 5-6 types of afraa special tarts and pastry, hot malpoa and moose.

On an overall experience it was one of my best dining experience there. For one person it costed around 700/- with tax. Will highly recommend for nice ambience,  best variation of food and outstanding staff behaviour. I don't mind to give them a 5 Star.

P.S.- They have a smoking zone. You don't have to worry about your car as City centre parking is there.
Also, you can drop via any bus/auto coming to city centre 1, then take the lift behind Afraa Deli and reach your destination of Afraa restaurant in 7th floor. Thanks.

Though the service and ambience is good, the food was not that great. The restaurant view really offers some great view. You get to see entire SaltLake from one side. We opted for buffet which tasted nothing unusual.

Went there just before the durga puja and we used GroupOn/nearbuy coupon for Lunch buffet (599 + tax wala buffet ;). 
Ambiance - Good! 
Welcome drink - Blue Lagoon! Good!
Salad & Soup -  Good...! Specially non-veg salads
Starters - Very Average! There were famous paneer tikka and one fish item. Oh I forget one small Pizza also, that was ummmm tasty!
Main course - Poor! Didn't expect jeera rice! Chicken was good. The Mutton dish was pathetic, I felt some Chinese touch in all Prawn, Chicken and Mutton items! -_- So finally all these with butter roti and 'jeera rice'!! And of course there was noodles too! 
Dessert - Ahhh Ultimate!!! Really the desserts were very good. so after very poor main courses, these made me smile at the end!

P.S - Checked others' reviews before visiting this place and also from my personal experience... may be girls like this place more ;) Don't mind!
Will visit again for a la carte or sunday buffet lunch :)

Afraa is a restaurant I have been to several times but never got around to review it. What is most amazing about this place is the view. It is unrestricted and one can see miles on all sides. Both the indoor and the outdoor seating are wonderful. I love the outdoors, especially on wintery evenings. This instalment of afraa was with my school friends, and we ordered the afraa mixed meat platter which had lamb chops, pork chops, breasts of chicken, grilled bhetki, sausages,  rashes of bacon, poached eggs and a lobster... served with pilaf rice and gravy and French fries. It was yummy beyond comprehension. The grilled chicken Caesar salad with bacon was amazing too! And for desert we had the afraa special desert. It was coconut and chocolate cake topped with rich caramel with a side of vanilla ice cream. It was too sweet gor my taste buds, but judging by how rapidly it was polished of the plates I would say it was delish! And the drink we had was awesome! The lip lock is a virgin mocktail with  ginger syrup and fresh ginger... Yummilicious!

Went there with a bunch of friends few days back. We basically loved the ambience. Took few mocktails, snacks, beer/breezers, hookah (brainfreezer) Hookah was damn smooth.The staff was very polite. Got invites for d ladies night as well. Overall one happening place in the city to chill out and have some goodtimes with friends.

Great place, drinks are really good. The hooka didn't last very long, the coal was out but flavour was still there but the waiter told us to get another hooka. It is quite expensive as i guess all clubs and lounges are. Sunday night it was pretty crowded guess people didn't care they had work the next day. The variety of drinks available was good, also a good range of cocktails for just 800. Hooka took a long time to come and it was hard to peg down a waiter had to try 2-3 times. The rooftop was amazing with a lovely view. Good place for a date on a weekday not a weekend. The DJ was really good too.

Well, wat an overrated and overpriced place I see!! Its catching attention because of the location and the ambience. During Durga Puja we visited n definitely the buffet was on Bengali cuisine. It wasn't serving plain white rice as probably they expected us to have doi machh,mochar chop or aloor Dom along with biriyani!! disaster!!! After we asked,they started serving white rice. Next I happened to spot chilli prawn ( probably a Chinese dish!! 😂) in the middle of Bengali cuisine. God knows why they mixed biriyani with Chinese or Bengali dishes altogether.
Only good part is the desserts!! Rabdi kamlabhog mihidana chhana sandesh n pan flavoured icecream!!

I've been there in this afraa restaurant and lounge at their lunch hour in this pujo astomi. My entire day has been spoiled after that visit. I'm writing this review after long gap as i want to forget that moment. The reason behind it........1. The food and side dishes are from mixed bengali and Chinese. Like dhokar dalna , one dal preparation, coliflower item , aloo posto and so on and in Chinese noodles, prawn manchurian. And 2 moghlai dishes like mutton biriyani ans children chap . Now chose from this !!!! 2. One soup is gandharaj dal.3. Their waiters are so busy they don't even bother about you !! Who you are ??? . I personally think there is no sense of making this kind of food all together. Not of course  this is the end . Again the mutton biriyani is cold like just made yesterday and i found not a good piece of mutton. But i found hair in it friends. What a excellent discovery. And their unlimited buffet menu is such that i had to ask to refill the sweet items. I had a first expression of the afraa restaurant and bar in the 6th floor. So i have visited their lounge for a special day of course with special amount for 2 heads is only 2408/= .and the experience is in front of you .

Went there for buffet lunch. The quality of food nd options was very good. Enough options are there for both veg and non-veg. Taste was also very good. Enjoyed every bit of it. 
Ambiance was very good. As the restaurant situated on 7th floor so one can enjoy the view while having the food. Service and staffs was very good. Service was very fast and prompt. 
And the offers what they are offering through nearby is excellent and absolutely value for money. 
Will surely revisit the place very soon.

The view and the ambience are the two big positives of this place. The food good but more on the okayish side. We tried the dinner buffet during pujas, which was extensive but what we remember most was the nolen gur ice-cream they had for dessert. They did a good job on the mutton biriyani and it paired well with the dak bungalow chicken...

Went for late lunch on Saptami with family to have some good food and experienced the worst ever possible food. We entered at 3.20 pm & while entering the restaurant we were informed that food will be served till 4 & it's only buffet @ Rs. 1200 all inclusive, after entering we were asked to take the main course as they will take little time to serve the starters, to our surprise we found inadequate food or no food ( Prawn & mutton ), when asked they said it's coming which took almost 15/20 minutes & the taste of the same were pathetic, in fact whatever left over food we had was below standard. The in house staff were very helpful especially Mr. Sujoy De, they tried their level best to serve us well but could not. When I asked to call the manager they got me the chief instead, who also had no answer, I showed him that none of us could hardly eat anything. I was also surprised to see that in a Rs. 1200 meal , they serve onion pakora ( Peyaji ) & chicken pakora (half done) as starter. Why were we allowed when their was hardly any food left? Just to have some business?  We had gone to a fine dining restaurant for a good culinary experience but was instead served with food that leaves a bad test in mouth & mind. They tried to cover up with giving us a 50% discount but it really doesn't matter as it was our ONLY family lunch during Puja which was completely spoilt.

Located at the City Center1, no doubt this fine dinning restaurant is over priced in terms of its food portions, but it has an amazing spacious ambience - white theme all around. Visited this place with couple of our corporate french clients to get their palette experience some mughlai cuisines. We ordered assorted kebabs, some main course but we all went crazy to try out their bengali dessert platter - misti doi, gulab jamun that ended with pan soaked in chocolate sauce and great hospitality.

The review of this place has mostly been fine dining with pricey menu and good service
I have been there when they had a great buffet ,which sadly has declined over the years.
But this was ala carte dinner and the exp was great.
After a grueling session of puja shopping we dropped in for dinner
Ambience amd setting is great and service is great.

The food is a mixed bag amd the portions are on the smaller side

Started of with pork 3 ways and bhetki picatta. The pork was great and sausage was delicious and wood grilled.

Then main course was risotto , though the menu says sea food , the chef was kind enough to change it to chkn for us.

The wine pairings are also good And the french tea cocktail awsum

Buffet experience was good they had little different menu options and everything was so amazingly prepared but for ala carte options are not that huge and taste way also it was okay.

I would have given 5 star if I would've write this before the bill arrived. They added extra 3k to bill and when we argued they went rude. After 1 hour they agreed to verify the order and I had to sit 30 min in CCTV room to see the footage which proved we were right.

After that the bouncers started abusing when we asked to compensate for the inconvenience.

It would've been my favorite place but I'm never visiting again.

The place is quiet relaxing. Open, bright and airy.
Food is so so types. I didnt fnd it tht fancy though. Thin crust pizza was yum. But there were only 3 item as starters which was a minus for me. Plus the main course was also minimal. Though they had some beautiful assorted salads and delicious desserts but no ice cream.
Experience was good but not that worth mentioning.

I visited the place with a few friends and from the moment we stepped in, I felt like I was going to dislike this place. 
The waiter was unhelpful and mean when we were deciding upon the menu. When a bill was presented, a 10% service charge was already added. I shouldn't have to tip the waiter after this, not that the waiter provided a good service to begin with. He fought and screamed at us and stopped after we pulled our phones out to record his behavior.

A very expensive & overrated place with mean staffers.

Please avoid.

Brunch is my favourite meal of the week. That is because I get to be super lazy and get up late, and then have a celebratory meal of surviving yet another week in this big, bad world. Last Sunday I went to Afraa Restaurant & Lounge, to try out their  Sunday Brunch, priced Rs.999/- plus taxes, it becomes a real good deal as it includes unlimited mocktails, cocktails and beer! God bless them😉 . And the good news for families with small kids is that, the brunch is non-chargeable for kids below the age of 5 years.

The best part of Afraa is its location. Perched atop the Block G of City Centre I, the place is sprawling, bright and breezy. The pristine white decor, with pops of colours accentuating it, the fine glasses, and of course, the unending line of starters, salads, mains and even desserts, gives one ample choice of indulgences to choose from.

As my friend Somnath played a wonderful host, I sampled quite a substantial portion of the spread. Some of my favourites were the Chicken Afghani, Tangra Style Chilli Fish and the Dal Makhni. The mocktails I tried looked pretty as a picture and were very refreshing too.

The array of drool-worthy desserts in bite-sized portions were just the perfect, pretty little things. Be it the chocolate tarts or the red velvet pastry, gulab jamuns or freshly cut fruits, there was something for everyone to love.

Conclusively, Afraa gives a lucrative brunch offer which is perfect for friends, families and also couples, looking for a good Sunday eat-out option at a decent price, which can be followed by a walk through the City Centre Mall, to burn down some of the calories consumed.
                                          ...

Its located behind the city centre mall at 6 & 7th floor.
I love the ambience ,the service which is really efficient and upto the mark ,attendant ( sujoy dey ) know what he's serving.

Outdoor seating is the bliss,you can see the city from there and it looks beautiful .
I can't say anything about their la carte but the Sunday brunch stole my heart 💓
Huge buffet variety was good but my picks would be non veg starters ( woodfire non veg pizza) ,drinks and outstanding desserts.
Looking to visit there again

This place is quite well and happening place in Kolkata . Dont have to say much about it . But last weekend I went there and quite shocked to see its almost deserted on Sunday eve . Previously It used to stick in dress code , now they are allowing people with chappals even on Sunday eve . Now come to food , As always I ordered its signature platter that consists of Bacon, Sausage , lsmb ribs, chicken , salami and fries . Its amazing. And Happy hours was running, so we got 1+1 drinks . The LIIT quality was really bad . As Instead of drinks they poured water . And even after 3 LIIT s it did not make me tipsy . So quality deteriorated .

Bt the secnd tym when i visited wid my frnds. To booz a bit. They were like i have to pay 1000 fr the entry. As last tym they didnt took. Ok we were stag i said them to call up there manager as i had a good experience frm his side. And he was like there is no manager. If u want to speak to the peoples who r in the counter. I was like am i begging in front of u. His name was ali and was just too rude. Even though i asked fr the number. He said i dnt have. Next moment we went frm there. Quite a bad experience. I came wid some gud reviews wid my frnds. Everything just gt thrashed.

Visited Afraa on a quiet afternoon. There were hardly 2 more customers and so we took a comfortable seat. The place emanated cleanliness and elegance. It was an exquisite and classy ambience.
We ordered the Polli di graziella. Before the main course they gave a complimentary bread platter. All the breads and snacks coupled with the dip was delicious. Never have I had a more filling start to a meal. Then came the main course immaculately plated. The sight of it was enough to sate hunger. But this wasn't the best part of the meal. Finally for dessert we ordered Afraa's Signature which was an oozing dark chocolate cake with ice cream and salted caramel. It was the most perfect combination I have ever had. The cake wasn't the usual kind of molten choco lava. It was baked the perfect amount. Slightly crunchy and the caramel lip smacking yummy with it. The cake was warm and melted into the ice cream. That dessert has lingered on in my memory ever since.

Afraa Restaurant : 
Thinking of taking your loved one out for a date or celebrating a special occasion on somewhere very romantic this place should be on your list , the candle light theme with the whole Kenny G music is so very romantic in an obvious way.. It's very fancy but a little dark themed.. 
The lounge and the restaurant are on separate floors, the Lounge is on the 6th where the restaurant is on the 7th floor of G block.
Now coming to the food.Its very good and the quantity is quite generous..We ordered the Afraa mixed platter which is very filling for two and if you order that make sure you don't go much with the main course as we didn't order a main course at all , for which I thank the person who took our order was very generous to suggest us..we ended up ordering a huge platter along with a small one and that was it..and for drinks we had red wine.
The staff were very nice and very polite too.
Now about the budget it's very expensive depending on what you order but the time you will have with all the romantic vibes around I guess it's worth it..you are not going there everyday..
So yaa I would definitely go there again, and I would suggest you to go there as well..

My wife and I had been to the restaurant on Saturday 30th. July to celebrate her birthday. This was our first visit and definitely our last after a very disappointing evening. The place appeared nice as we entered but were öffered a very bad seat with no view of anything but the side wall. The food served was good but costly. When we realized that we had ordred more than what we could eat we requested one dish to be packed so we could bring it home. Upon reaching home and  opening the packet we found a strand of human hair embedded in the food. When we telephoned the management
 they were arguing and rude. Kolkats does not lack better places for fine dining.

As it's been an good place to hangout ... the most disappointing was that the management is not good at all in dealing with customers.. they had generated an wrong bill and they are not ready to accept it.. they are not even concerned to check it and find whose fault in that.. after spending the some shitty hours with them, the CCTV footage revealed the truth that we have been charged with wrong bill .. so guys there are lots of option available for restro cum lounge be there ... and have better evening..

Afraa lounge:
Romantic roof top lounge with artificial candel light theme. Remember lounge and restaurant are different. Lounge on 5th floor and restaurant on 6th floor. You have facility to sit inside too but i bet you wont if you feel the ambiance outside. Food was tasty but was over priced and drinks were too mindblowing but over priced. Actually to enjoy the ambience you have to loosen up ur purse. Good option for special occasion.

Afraa restaurant:
Its on 6th floor. You can enjoy candel light dinner with your loved one. Perfect place for dating ocassion. I went for the buffet. The starters and main course was very limited which I dint like. But the desert and salads spread was huge. I loved their desert very much out of all the items. Price is on higher side for alacarte

Afraa lounge and restaurant,located on the top most floor of the Apollo building. It offers the complete view of Salt Lake. It is the perfect place for a dine out/date during the day time and evenings. The lounge hosts Ladies night every Fridays. And the restaurant offers brunch at 999 plus taxes, every Sunday.
The brunch buffet left me amazed. It started from one corner of the room, and stretched till the other end - phew! So much to eat plus unlimited cocktails, wine, beer - all within 999 plus GST.
We started with some exclusive salads, watermelon cheese, blue onion, cheese types, cold cuts, the list was never ending. There was a chocolate fondue too, but sadly too much of cake droppings caused it to choke. Hence, no boomerangs for me :(

Nonetheless, the main course had biriyani, pulao, prawn, muttton, chicken. The dessert counter was my place to be - from tarts to sponge cakes to chilli roosgolla. They had it all!

Kolkata people need not worry about finding a good brunch place any more - head to Afraa! 12:30 p.m. until 4:00 p.m. :)

Though the food and drinks were fine but had a really bad experience. 
Last weekend I was there with couple of my Friends and after finishing up, they billed an extra 3L tower. On asking them, they started arguing and didn't believe us. And hence one of my friend was made to sit infront of their CCTV footage and check whether we took it or not. Finally, they were at fault as the footage revealed. 
PS
- Trust your customers, if they can pay your overpriced rates, I don't think a Tower will make much of difference. 
- All this happened only after we got drunk. I pity my friend who was stable to check the whole CCTV footage.

The restaurent is located in the 7 th floor at G block in City centre. The ambience is just perfect for anyone to lit up there mood. Candles are lit which add ons the beauty. Last night i paid a visit eth my sister. Coming to the food, we ordered a dish from small bites named turkish chicken and from pizza section thr bbq chicken pizza. The turkish chicken literally gave us foodgasm. A fingerlicking dish. We were almost full so jist had a slice of pizza and the rest was parceled. The pizza is also great wth minimal cheese and is perfect for people who keeps in mind their calary intake. From the dessert we ordered molten cake which was also yummy and a perfect end to our meal. Would love to pay a visit again. The waiters concerened were also polite and humble.

The quality of the food here is just superb. I have been here twice very recently. 1st time we ordered the Caesar's salad and the Brazen lamb from the non veg platter.2nd time we ordered the pollo di graziella and the Afraa special pork chops. So summing up both the visits, I loved the Pork and the Lamb preparations, Kolkata being the heaven of continental cuisine and competing with so many very very good eateries I think this place can hold it's own. The salad was very low in quantity and the chicken in pollo di graziella was a bit on the hard side. The winner has to be the Pork Chops as the meat portions were quite sumptuous and filling. I would love to visit again and experiment with some of the other fares just that the pricey nature of the restaurant would make me want to think twice before I do.

Afraa is truly a magnificent restaurant to fine dine in. Spread across the sixth and the seventh floors of G Block in City Centre – I, Afraa seduces you with its tasteful ambiance, good food and foot tapping music. Yet, what appeals to me the most is the view. Coming to the food, I must say there is no place like Afraa to leave you feeling delighted at the end of your meal. Shall we proceed?

            Once you are seated at Afraa and provided with the menu card, the server promptly fills your pretty glasses with water and prepares to take your order. The menu card is not exactly the same as the one online, so do take a good look. On my visit to Afraa, after our orders were taken and as we waited for the food to arrive and the conversations to flow, we were served with some tempting bread to dig into. The complimentary bread platter consisted of some fine quality of warm and soft bread as well as breadsticks. 

I ususally don’t prefer Caeser salad, but it was hard to refuse one that came with chicken, sun dried tomatoes, anchovies, lettuce and bacon. Over candlelight and soft music, I fell in love with my salad and with Afraa. 

I had ordered a Detox Salad out of plain curiosity and my salad promptly arrived looking fresh and tempting. A bulk of the salad unsurprisingly contained salad greens followed by beans, avocados and mixed seeds, with honey mustard on the side. I had many a spoonful of my salad and moved on to a few slices of a vegetarian pizza. 

The Della Casa Pizza, interestingly was topped with panner tikka (cottage cheese), pepper, onions and potatoes lathered in generous quantities of cheese but unfortunately provided with a hard base that was a bit too burnt on the edges. It was large enough to be shared by two people.
                                          ...

The Restaurant is located at 7th Floor in City Centre 1. I had been to this place a couple of days back to have buffet lunch. Afraa has excellent ambience and a good spread of buffet. The food quality is top notch. They had Pizza, Kebab, Risoto and excellent spread of salads for starters followed by main course which taste wise was excellent. Just a feedback for the Afraa Management that if you have dal makhani in place of yellow dal it would help us vegetarians because who has yellow dal with either naan or veg pulao?? I also feel the spread for Indian Veg is limited as they just provided one paneer item and the rest of the menu was noddles, diced potato in garlic sauce and yellow dal whereas for non veg they had 3 items. Even when i requested the manager to provide atleast a dal makhini i got a pretty cold reply from him stating that this is what we serve everyday. As this restaurant belongs to Ambuja Neotia group expected better hospitality and response. Vegetarians might feel a bit cheated as they also end up paying the same amount as non veg Rs.599 + taxes. So if you cannot increase the spread please reduce the price for vegetarians because its common sense that all the non vegetarians will definitely have veg food along with the non veg spread but no vegetarian will ever have your non veg spread. Just think about it.  Over all I enjoyed the time spent their.

Afraa has a nice candlelit rooftop dining area which scores over the indoor area if the weather permits it to. The music is pop but hardly anyone grooves to it. The food and drinks were nice. Chicken wings was delicious while the vindaloo fish fingers was average. Service was a bit on the slower side.

Went to Afraa Restaurant and Lounge after a long time today for lunch. The decor is good and the ambience is okay. We had the buffet and the food was good.
Bit disappointed by the staff's behaviour this time though. They were reluctant to refill the food, and we had to ask them for second helpings instead of them asking us. We had asked for a finger bowl and they told us to use the wash basin instead. Hope they improve their attitude because it affects the overall experience. Compared to our prior experiences this was a huge let down. We will think twice before going there again.

I had been there for my birthday in 2016. My better half and sweet little daughter gave me a wonderful gift by planning and perfectly executing a surprise lunch at Afraa. And it was a surprise alright. Not until we reached the elevator and my wife asked for directions, did I know where we were going. The first sight of the restaurant was enough for me to decide to go there again..even before we had entered. 
The ambience was fantastic and the stewards and managers were extremely courteous; and that is not complimenting them enough. The view of the city from the 7th floor through the big windows is breathtaking! 
Now coming to the food, I was really feeling like an addict at a point. The buffet was stuffed with dishes and more dishes. Vegetarian or not, you are really spoilt for choice. The salads were quite adequate, liquor was on the house; the Vodka based cocktail was fantastic. Not being into Vodka much, I had ordered beer and repented after taking a sip from my wife's drink. The main course was also pretty well shaped and had fish, chicken and mutton (which was tender as as shepherd). The dessert had mousse of various shapes and sizes as well as cakes and pastries and ice cream.
The most impressive and touching part of the entire experience came after an interview by a reporter from T2. When the steward at our table found out that it was my birthday, he brought a couple of slices of cake on a plate with a lit up candle on one corner. It was really moved. 
I had a great day, and would suggest that foodies to go there and experience. However, I would not suggest a-la-carte dining here. Went there on Poila Boishakh, 2017. The food is still very good, but massively overpriced. Average price per dish is 750. This restaurant is even more expensive than any in Park Street. Even mocktails and sodas are priced in the 300 zone which is disappointing. Average cost comes to 1800-2000 per person. You will enjoy the continental fare, but will definitely not enjoy the pricing.

One of the posh dine-ins in Kolkata, located on the top floor of City Centre, Salt Lake... pretty nice ambience with spacious decor along with rooftop facility. The quality and quantity of food are good. However, they offer recipes with some peculiar names but with  common flavours .We ordered some prawn starters followed by Mixed Fried Rice and Good old blast Chilly chicken along with Virgin Mojito... The prices are little high though it is alright if the ambience and mood are taken for granted ;), would love to get some more items on their card :)

Spl mention to Mr. Subhrata for his wonderful service nd spl drink he specially made for me... We went for the buffet which was grt.. I loved the chicken pineapple pizza nd the chicken keema balls tossed in sweet n spicy barbecue sauce the most... The aubergine salad was new to me, but I really liked it, the spiciness of it... The fish salad was a disappointment, the fish was too chewy... Rest was grt... The paneer grilled to perfection with some Mediterranean spices..Nd offcourse the costume made drink by Mr. Subhrata was perfect... It was a concussion of cranberry syrup, pineapple juice nd coconut liquor nd kaluha.. it was just awesome...  Looking forward to visit again there for sure...

One of the very finest restaurants here in Kolkata. Serves you too class food, and wine.The salads, appetizers, mains, sides, desserts on a whole was extremely yum, and worthy. 
P.s. if you are students, or still in college, then I would suggest you go with your families. Just on a general note. Otherwise you will always be having fun of its your Friends and a huge group anyhow.. :D

Afraa lounge became our 2nd home kinda place after office. Being an employee of sector 5, during 2011 -12, the choices were limited, we didn't have bakstage, we didn't have xoxo, we didn't have Bistro. So for promotion party and any other corporate event, Afraa always used to be our first choice. The good thing I have observed about this place was between the 2 sections after you reach the floor, we always were given an entire part. 
We used to take the unlimited food and drinks buffet which used to cost around 800 during that period - I am sure it has increased like hell so do check before you opt for it. In drinks, they used to serve kingfisher beer pint, Smirnoff, Bacardi and Antiquity blue and all of them were pouring. 2 veg and non veg starters were served at the cozy and comfortable sofa where you can sip ur drink and bite the kebab while talking to ur friends, colleagues and tapping ur feet with the trance numbers played by the DJ. there is a nice open air portion where you can also take ur drink and have a smoke while watching the entire salt lake city heights in front of ur eyes. 
The dinner is also served with nice delicacy - assorted bread, 3-4 types of salads, dal makhni, paneer kofta, chicken kassa, mutton Rogan Josh, jeera rice, and in desert they had 2 types of sweets and ice cream section. Definitely a nice place for weekend hangout and corporate parties!! 👍👍✌✌

Their Sunday Brunch is definitely one of the best buffets I've had in this city. What adds value to it, are the unlimited cocktails that come with the buffet. As many as you want, as long as you order beer or vodka/rum cocktails. The salad bar has cold cut pork, along with chicken, fish and the usual Indian chaats that go with salad. Their starters include crispy fried chicken, something made out of fish, thin crust pizzas. The main course again, was brilliant (not really common for most city buffets). They had mutton biryani, a couple of chicken dishes, something made out of fish. I might be woolly about the details, but that's mostly because the cocktails left me pretty wasted. Overall food was brilliant. The service was impeccable. The ambiance couldn't be better. The bill came to around Rs. 2200 for two.

Situated In 7th floor of G block, CC1..
Decoration and the total interior z mind blowing.. 1 of the finest looking restaurant.. Ambiance z very nice and peaceful.. Service was good..
Went for a lunch buffet.. they served drink and we choose lime soda..
Started with soup.. then salads.. Both variety and number of starters were very disappointing  for me.. Only 3 types of starters.. Among those potato item, non veg item and non veg pizza I liked the pizza only..
BUT Main course saved the day.. I loved the options of main course and the food was very tasty.. There were veg hakka noodle, veg pulao, dal item, veg in black bean sauce, cheese item, chicken in red wine sauce, fish item and mutton dakbanglow.. 
Desert was okay..  But mouse was not that good.. AND there was only option for icecream..
So, overall okay.. Not a place for starter lovers.. Main course is their speciality.. 
Cost for 2 was Rs.1442 including vat..

One of the finest place in town! Have been to this place quite a times. Decor is very soothing inside out. You don't have those nagging staffs. You can sit here for hours and hours with your privacy totally yours. Try anything in food, it tastes good. Veg Platter is must a try. Sufficient for two people. Hukkah is nice too.
Perfect place to chill out  if you have a beer partner ;) :D

If you want a nice quiet place with a view, this is the place.
The ambience and the staff, both are excellent and i can only imagine how it will be like at night.
Coming to the food, had the buffet and wow, so many items in buffet at such a well renowned place, I just had to try all. And trust me when I say this that I finally was full,so full that I couldn't even finish my mocktail 😅
This was a treat to my gf and she loved it. We started with starters,1 veg aloo tikkas and 1 non veg fish tikkas. Then came a small pizza.
We then went for salads and and soup.
Then came the main course, 1 rice and 4 veg items(loved the paneer) and chowmein and 2 non veg items.
But for me the best was mocktail and dessert. Absolutely loved the soufflé and tarts. Wish I had some more place in my stomach. Apple pie and the pastry was just ok.

Good drinks and very good mushroom risotto cooked to perfection, most places over cook the rice but here it's like viola. Service is a bit slow. Had yummy aglio olio recently and good mushroom pizza.

It was my first visit to Afraa Restaurant at City Centre 1 on this Sunday evening after the movie @ INOX. Being my first visit I was in a confusion for everything. But after entering I found that the ambiance is just superb and moreover the outside view is simply awesome. Courteous staffs. We have ordered for some Pasta and Hakka Noodles. Taste was perfectly ok. Coming to this place one has to mind his / her pocket but that is worth it. Will surely visit soon.

My first visit to this place. Located on the 6 th floor of city centre, salt lake. We managed to have a outdoor seat. Yes the ambience is too good. You can see the salt lake city from the floor. Seems nice if the weather is good. They have the tiny lights on the tables resembling a candle. Overall great.

Coming to food, the most disgusting thing was lack of options in the menu. This brings down my rating. Needless to say. We ordered the only variety of non veg pizza available and a fish finger. Food was okayish. We ordered a mocktail and was surprised to see the quantity of a drink that costs 600 bucks. Cost is high i would say. Overall an average experience.

Like others, I did review the restaurant before visiting it.
My personal experience goes like this..
1. Ambience is totally amazing no doubt. But you go to a restaurant not only for ambience isn't it?..
2. The menu that is shown in zomato is an antique 1..It means they have updated the menu in which almost 60% of the food items are not available.
3. Cocktails??.. I ordered gimlet & cosmolito..Itz yuckkk.. 
I didnt find trace of lime in gimlet.. although before ordering asked their preparation. 
4. Now comes the food.. I would rate 3/5. 
As I have been to better places.. I ordered calamary and mixed platter.. 
Bill was around 4k.. I felt we wasted..
Note: Review is totally on my experience.. Taste may vary from person to person
Staff were good in behavior.

Suggestion: Please update the menu on zomato.

    Thirdly ,main course 3 non veg rest others were veg items... Veg pulau,veg Hakka chow,veg in black bean sauce,cottage cheese preparation,fish in green herbs ,chicken in red wine sauce and mutton duck baunglow.... All the main course items were excellent...

A trip to Afraa required some planning since it's across the city from where I stay. We had heard a lot about it and anticipated a great dinner to celebrate my daughter's home-coming. The decor, the ambience was impressive yet cosy. We were given a great table tucked away from the main room with a fantastic view. From that point on, the evening went downhill. The napkins stank of damp - the replacements were worse. The service was at best so slow that we were wondering whether we had been forgotten altogether. The courses arrived in batches so that some of us were halfway through or the food cold by the time the last person was served her main course. The service personnel did not seem to understand that we were there to dine together and not one by one. The food too was pretty pedestrian except a lamb dish. An eminently forgettable experience albeit an expensive one.

Sunday lunch is much awaited meal of d week. Had visited Afraa before and tried A lac art .last Sunday we chose buffet . The strangest part was no difference on prices for veg /non veg. Very little option for vegeterians. Infact just one sabji wit choice of bread and one Chinese dish. Quality of food is no doubt good ,but seriously the restaurant requires to add more options . overall would love to recommend to all.

We finally made it to afraa for sunday brunch.Its located on the 7th floor opposite city centre 1.
Classy interiors and staff are courteous,perfect for a romantic date. Unlimited food with drinks was their sunday brunch offer from 12 30 to 4pm but the drinks offer is only limited to some vodka and rum based cocktails and foster beer.No other hard drinks available.
There is a outdoor section for smoking and drinking with sitting arrangements which was nice.
Coming to food 1st they served one fish and one potato preparation as starters followed by thin crust pizza and pasta of your choice.The pasta was good and was served hot but apart from this everything else failed to make a mark.In the main course buffet mutton biriyani was good and the lunch ended well with desserts.
999 plus tax per person was their sunday brunch offer which was easy on the wallet but will visit next some other time.

Located on 7th floor of City Centre mall...it has a beautiful ambience and view. Friday evening went there with my friends who were celebrating their anniversary. Queue was not long. We ordered for a platter for starters along with roastie. Both were nice. Roastie was different and had a creamy topping. The cocktails suggested by Subrata were good. Then we tried out the pizzas, pasta, noodles and vegetables tossed in black bean sauce. The pizza base was tooooo sweet. Didn't like it much. Pasta was also OK. Their Hakka noodles is little thick than the other noodles and it tasted nice. The vegetables gravy was well made but babycorns used in that were too hard. The dinner ended with complimentary chocolate paan and a dessert. If one likes paan n chocolate one will love it. The dessert was yummy. chocolate cake with vanilla.

This is a place where the ambience is bound to please you.Dim lights,beautiful furniture altogether create a mellow atmosphere.
We were a group of ten and were seated by the terrace. I had a khauksuey which was good enough,though not the best. I followed it with pork chops,which was quite delightful,especially the apple served along with it. I washed all these down with liit,which was blended well. My friend tried the prawn and liked it. I had also tasted the masala kulcha with murg tikka makhani. This was nothing extraordinary.
Full points on the service,though.

I have visited the lounge twice. It is located in the g-block of city center 1 on the 6th floor.
It has both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. The indoors have comfortable sofa seatings for large groups and small two seaters as well for smaller groups. It also has a dance floor and screenings for tournaments also.
The outdoor seating has open roof with the flickering battery operated candles on the tables and cool breeze blowing adds a romantic charm to it. Hookah and smoking is allowed only in the outdoor seating and if you're lucky enough to secure a table there.

During the Happy hours beers are 1:1 which is quiet good. And goes easy on the pocket as well. The happy hours usually gets over by 8pm but even when it was 8:05 I was given the benefit of it. The staffs are very cordial and polite. Even during the late hours at night you won't feel uncomfortable even if you are out with your girlies only.

The place is expensive but then when you wanna enjoy all the good things you need to pay the price accordingly. If you're not worried about the pocket pinch and want to enjoy the evening with your date with a couple of drinks, good food and hookah then it's the perfect place to be.

The best thing about this place is the ambiance and food quality.

I believe these are the two most important factors for any restaurant and Afraa has blown my mind. Apart from that the staff there were extremely good, the best in my experience. There was no fixed guy who catered to our needs, rather anyone passing by always took a look if any glass were empty or if any plates needs to be removed.

This was something i didn't find in other restaurants. Moreover, since we were there in a buffet, we were open to choose between any item present there and I tried both veg and non veg.

I have to say both were more than awesome in taste. Specially the items of fish.

Overall a splendid experience after a long time. Afraa is 'a must go restaurant'...

Heard bout it a for a long time but didn't get a a chance to be there. But recently i got a chance to go there and I was very excited. The restaurant is at saltlake city center 6th floor. Going there we chose the rooftop seatings. And that was just awesome ( maybe as it was my 1st rooftop restaurant). They also have a very well decorated, illuminated lounge. But from the rooftop you can have an awesome view. A moonlit night with a candlelight present on the table made the ambience magical. Happy hour was available at the time. So we ordered drinks accordingly. With that they provide soft drinks or soda complimentarily, whatever u needed (this was new to me). We ordered hot wings n chicken sausage. Both was just awesome n more than enough fo 2.
We had a memorable night there with awesome food, drinks n ambience....

The garlic naans ...cheese kulchas are super amazing and super soft... the panner just melts in your mouth. Every item we tried was just too good... will visit very soon for sure...

Yeahh i did visit it the second time...and that too just in 15 days. This time it was the lounge on the 6th floor and i fell in love with the place. We took the outdoor seating and what a fantastic experience. The cool breeze was all that we needed in the humid weather. The lounge area is perfectly divided into different sections with privacy for each. The starters are mind blowing. Lovely ambience and a promise to come again very soon😊

Well, I had recently visited this place on a Saturday afternoon..It is located on the 7th floor of Block G, in City Centre 1. Very easy to locate it when you are in the mall, we were there to try their continental delicacies.
*AMBIENCE*
As soon as we moved out of the elevator, we found that Afraa is the only restaurant situated in that floor. So we didnt have to spend a single moment in locating the restro. It is wuite a wide spaced area with two small compartments of outdoor seating, which looked fabulous. But, you do not have the option to have your floor at this outdoor compartment. One of it is primarily a Smoking Zone, I suppose and the other one is sort of a lounge.
I was amazingly attracted towards one of the walls in the seating area, which was made with jars placed upside down. That was interesting caricature. The eatery had a seating capacity of around 60-65 people.
They offer buffet spreads, so some portions of the restaurant was reserved to serve the buffet.
*FOOD*
For starters, we ordered Turkish Shish Chicken Kabab, which was accompanied with French Fries, traditional dips and sumac flavoured green salad. The chicken pieces werent very soft. Perhaps it needed some more time to be cooked. There was a flat bread also provided with this dish, which served as a good accompaniment.
For the main course, we ordered Pollo di Graziella, which had two Chicken portions, sauteed vegetables, garlic breadstick and Mashed potatoes. We ordered a basket of Cheese Garlic bread, with the main course. The Garlic Bread was cheesy and soft to the core. A thumps up for that. But I was disappointed with the Chicken portion served in Pollo di Graziella. It was way too stiff than I had imagined. So could not appreciate it much.
As a sweet ending, we ordered Home made Ice Cream with Chocolate Salami, which was very average to taste.
*SERVICE AND PRICE*
Well, for the service part, I would say it was slow and Unprofessional. The food took a long time to be served. The staff didnt bother to replace our soiled plates, before serving the main course and served it on the same plate. Although, they were standing right in front of us, we had to call them to replenish the water in our glasses. I found that to be discourteous.
With regard to the price, considering the taste and quantity, I feel that the dishes are overpriced.

It was a great experience to have dinner at Afraa. The food, ambience and service provided left no room for improvement. The best part was that the waiter was so attentive that he could catch on from telephone calls we received that it was a special occasion (our anniversary). Without telling us anything he brought a dessert and arranged for the live violinist to come over and play a tune of our choice. We were very touched by the gesture. Needless to say that we will continue to visit Afraa and recommend it to our friends and family.

This was my first visit to this place with family that too on Nobobarshya. The restaurant is quite spacious with rooftop scenery being one of its attractive points. The decor is sober and I personally love their use of balloon glasses for serving water. Today being nobobarsho, they had a special spread of bengali cuisines for buffet. The buffet was quite elaborate atleast the main course n desserts. For starters they only had 2 dishes. From what I gathered from my mates (as I had opted for ala carte) the dishes were good enough and the desserts topped their favourites specially the 'gondhoraj doi' and 'anar' flavoured 'rasogolla'.
Me n my brother had bhetki piccata n pork chops along with some virgins, afraa lip lock and gateway sunrise. The bhetki piccata had generous amount of bhetki fillings in a crisp outer coat n was served with hollandaise based sauce. It was amazing. Then came in a artfully crafted platter, the pork chops. Served with mashed potatoes n salad with grilled apples, cabbages n celery. It was delicous from the first bite, the pork was perfectly cooked n had the perfect flavours.
Finally I would like to specifically mention about their courteous staff members. The one who was serving our table, gave us a plate of their special 'rasogolla' even though we hadn't asked for it, just bcoz me n my bro hadn't opted for buffet like our other family members. :)
So a thumbs up to this place :)

You know, the ambience, you simply can't just stay without moving yourself with the rhythm. And, an roof-top city view is not something every restaurant can offer you! So, it's obviously a must-go !!

I have been to this place for a number of times till now, precisely it has turned out to be my gang's hangout spot whenever we visit city centre 1, salt lake. We always go for the outdoor seating in the Lounge section of this place and trust me the place always gifts us with good views either of the entire city center or the salt lake city scape, with some amazing breeze and cool electric candles on every table during the evening hours. Much can't be commented about the drinks as it is the same everywhere but the way they serve is pretty good and the best part of seating outdoor is enjoying a smoke along with your drink and this place has that. Food is good but prices are on the higher side and we never tried hookah over there so can't tell anything about it. Overall this places pins you din with its amazing plush ambience and breathtaking outdoor seating. Will i be going back to this place, well yes its sort of my gang's hangout spot, definitely not gonna miss the hanging out. Special mention -- an ideal place for a romantic evening!

They make some excellent grills, and I especially love their lobster.  Wonderful collection of starters, great food overall, but a tad bit too pricey. Lovely place to go on dates.

I had been planning for a long time to go to Afraa. Had heard about the place from a lot of friends. A sudden plan with family made it happen. We were one of the early visitors and were greeted cordially by the staff. The restaurant is quite spacious and decorated aesthetically. The dim lights, the floating candles give you a refreshed feel. As the restaurant is located on the 7th floor, you get a beautiful view of the city from inside. We had some evening snacks and the food was sumptuous. The restaurant staff is very friendly and courteous and they constantly kept a tab on the tables for any help, if required. They also asked about any specifications we wanted in the food. Our 2year old niece was well entertained by them. In all, a lovely experience. Would definitely come here again.

Afraa is probaly one of the finest restaurants in town. Known for their warm, mellow, romantic candlelight dinner ambiance and elegantly furnished interior, the restaurant offers excellent cuisines for fine dining. The candlelit tables and live violinist playing melodious Bollywood tunes make for a soothing balmy atmosphere. For appetizers we had Jacob's Creek Chardonnay white wine accompanied with nachos and breadsticks with a Mediterranean hummus-like dip, followed by golden poppy seeds crusted chicken morsels with campari chili dip. Entree consisted of Malabar paratha, Paneer Achari and delicious melt-in-the mouth mutton. Dessert included Afraa's signature ice cream followed by the complimentary innovative chocolate-coated 'paan' served only after the main course dinner. Dining in Afraa is altogether a very delightful experience with value-for-money food and environment.

If you have a continental taste bud, then you will have a nice time @ Aafraa. Situated in City Centre I, saltlake top floor, this place is like a table top that will give you a beautiful view of the much planned Saltlake City. The ruling colour in decoration is white, that can soothe your mind in peace.The ambience and hospitality is entirely peaceful add to the surrounding view through the glass panes. Food is available both in buffet and a-la-carte.Pocket Pinch is around Rs.600/- per head. Food Quality is very good. I am not a continental foodie. So visited once, but had  anice experience!!!

Afraa restaurant and Lounge,  situated in the heart of salt lake and near city center,  is a very good place for continental food lovers.  It is a place where you would like to visit with your loved one.  The coolest thing is the top view of the salt lake city from the lounge and balcony.  The ambience and service is plausible. 
 The food is tasty, but could be better if we consider the price they are taking. Especially,  starter could be a lot better and variety was missing. Desert is the best option in the package in my opinion.  As a whole,  it is worth a visit.

The entire layout of this place is quite remarkable. Situated on the 7th floor of City Center, Salt Lake it gives you a breath taking view. Coming to the food, their buffet starts with two complimentary welcome drinks which includes beer. The starters are good but few in variety. The main course consists of continental and Italian dishes. The buffet may apparently seem over priced on paper, but here you don't just pay for the food, you pay for the ambiance too.

One of those places that I inevitably end up visiting during my short stays in the city. The proximity to my place of course, is the main reason for that. So they have this nice open air sections, along with the party area. Of course aside from winters and late evenings, the open air is ruled out. But the luminous bar area is really nice, as is the seating. Perfect for binging on cocktails, and hookah too. Weekends warrant a reservation. Their platters are good, and drinks are potent.

The food here is real good I loved it but then when you are such high prices you expect good hygiene too . I had ordered for a beer , after I started consuming it I saw a fly in it on reporting they just removed the fly with a spoon and said "chalta hai sir" and I was told to drink that. I would not at all recommend this place to anyone , I would rather go to some other restaurant like barbeque nation or sigree where proper hygiene is mentained

One of the most romatic and hushed places in the city. The atmosphere is totally pleasant and soothing. Dance floor, loud music, private party space and a roof top candle-lit open air seating for romantic dining; an all-in-one combination for cheering your mood as well as your taste buds.
Speaking about the food, among the handful of options available, we ordered Veg platter. It consists of Crispy chilly Babycorn, Paneer tikka, Potato wedges, Soya veg kabab and veg Galauti kebab. A combination of different tastes together served in a platter is bound to be delicious. 
Veg Nachos : It was average in taste and the topping was a bit on the sweeter side with trace amounts of kidney beans. Needs an uplift in taste as well as presentation. 
Afraa lip lock and Virging caprioska were ordered to quench our thirst. The former had a ginger base taste with lemon while the latter was a mint based mocktail. Both were pretty good and recommended among the available mocktails. 
Finally to end such a intimate evening we ordered Tropical Sundae. Full marks for the presentation, the preparation and the perfect combination of ice cream flavours like vanilla, mango, strawberry with fruit chuncks and marshmallows. 
The high point of this dining experience was the ambience. Candlelight, full moon in the sky and cool breeze together making it a memorable experience. 
Its a bit expensive affair but considering the experience, its worth a try.

The only time I've been here is with colleagues; and that too with a coupon from Groupon. We did have a prior reservation, but were skeptical how we'd be treated, as there were about 55 of us.

We were not disappointed. The salads were endless and the starters kept on coming. A very wide variety of main course as well. We did not have place enough to try out all the desserts.
We were disappointed by the mocktails though, but everything else was splendid.

Great ambiance and service.

Thankfully, we had a reservation and went on a weekday; I'm not sure if this would have been possible on a weekend. With this kind of food, I'm sure that this place must be packed. Wouldn't mind paying the full price for the buffet, the next time I drop in.

Went there a few weeks ago and ordered Bhetki picatta for starters and Lamb Shanks for mains. The starter was delicious but was really disappointed with the main course. Although the menu card mentioned that the lamb shanks would be served with potatos, mushrooms and shallots, there was not a trace of mushroom or shallots on the plate. Instead they served the lamb shanks with mashed potatos (which were too gooey) and an assortment of vegetables which were never mentioned in the menu. When we talked to the chef he said he had left out mushroom and shallots because they are 'allergic'.  On our request he agreed to sauté some but by the time he brought it out, our lamb had gone stone cold.
Overall it was not a nice experience. I had heard a lot about this place but after my dining experience can only say it all sounds over-rated.

To our utter disappointment, we cudnt relish any items in the buffet menu. The dishes was bland, tasteless and wasnt cooked well. The items served and the options were few....
The presentation and food quality wasnt up to our expectation even. Its better not to try out the buffet and try your luck in ala carte.

Signature Fish Dishes at Afraa - Fish Promotion 

It is true that different preparations of fish are less popular vis-à-vis chicken or mutton dishes served in famous hotels and restaurants. However there are numerous items prepared from different fish which are also extremely delicious and palatable. Hilsa, the queen of fish is a great example in this regard. But these fish items remain less admired mainly due to the fact that they are not properly promoted to the urban group. And this is the gap the documentary attempts to bridge by bringing the fish items in the limelight.

Probably the only time I have been so floored. It was quite a while back that we had dined here, and I still cite this as my favorite place; even though there has been considerable competition.
The ambiance is dim and very modern. Rest assured though, modern cliches aren't visible. here.
The staff is amicable. They serve with a smile all through. Personally, that and good manners are all that takes me to commend someone.

The major part is the food. The platters are amazing. We ordered the tandoori platter, and boy did it tinkle my taste buds!! The pizza was flawless; crisp crust and indulgent toppings, not indianised. The best part of it, was the lasagne. This is the best lasagne I have ever had!!
Returning soon, and sooner.

This place is perfect for continental lovers with a very pretty ambience. It's located in City Centre 1, Salt Lake. We ordered 'The ultimate Barbecue chicken pizza', which was really tasty. Alongside, we ordered a Spinach Cannelloni and a tomato Spaghetti. All the dishes were delicious and the quantity was also quite decent. We had been there on a friday night so the music from the lounge bar downstairs was a little disturbing. Otherwise the violinist in the place is phenomenal with the music and is a treat to the ears. 
I would highly recommend Afraa for family dinners and any other small and special occasion. It's a must visit for everyone.

Located on the 7th floor of block G city centre 1. Went there for a regular buffet lunch. The ambience was good. The staffs were well behaved. The view of the city from here is excellent. Coming to the food...
They served one complementary drink, I choose coke. They served the starters on the table, in starters they served one thin crust Chicken pizza( it was too thin like a roti), cheese balls and a veg starter. The starters were average in taste. In buffet they had one Chicken soup which was good and variety of salad. In main course they had Steamed Rice, Dal, 2 veg dishes, one paneer dish, murgh keema pulao, one Chicken dish, one fish dish and one lamb dish. Only the murgh pulao, paneer preparation and Chicken preparation were tasty. Others were average in taste. In Desserts section there were four varieties. Fruit cake, chocolate rum ball, strawberry tart and Gulab jamun. They also had vanilla ice cream. There was also a live counter of pasta.
The buffet was good but it lacks of starter. Main course and Desserts were all right. I will suggest them to improve their starters in the buffet. Otherwise okay.

The ambience is very relaxing.  U also have the option for roof-top dining which makes it even better.  It was very bright and airy.. perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon. The drinks were great, I think I ordered Cosmolito. We were lucky as it was Happy Hours so we got some free drinks. The food was was delicious specially Bekti Piccata (My fav.). The staff was very friendly and helpful. Planning a next visit soon.

Well I just want to say I am really grateful to my friend who suggested Afraa and seriously it was worth it. We also got to get the benefit of happy hours so we ordered a Long Island Iced Tea (1 +1) and Cosmolito (1 +1). The liit was simply mindblowing. The best liit i have had till date. The Cosmolito was suggested by a staff there and it was perfect for us. The perfect combo of sweet and yet get the taste of alcohol. Along with that we had ordered the ultimate barbecue chicken pizza and it was delicious. The crust was super thin and the toppings were full of chicken. The staff was very friendly and well behaved. There was also violin being played by a guy. So overall it was an experience worth the money. I definitely would love to visit Afraa again.

I was here for a weekday dinner. Distinct lounge atmosphere with the lava lamp lights and low, indistinct music. The open air section was unfortunately occupied. Food & drinks - the veg platter had a few good components - anardana kabab, paneer tikkas and corn tikki. If I remember right, they were a couple more items. The margherita pizza was fairly bland, obvious since there was hardly any cherry tomato. But a thin crust pizza is always enjoyable. I'll admit the oozy chocolate cake was very good. The tiramisu got a lot right, but was missing the required texture. Turned out to be quite expensive. Satisfactory meal, nothing wow.

Afraa like a second home to me situated in the heart of the city 6th floor at the city Center mall salt lake , open air with an In house centrally Air conditioned arena , specious, roof top is breezy in most days.. I mostly drop in for a few shots of absinthe or Smirnoff or a couple of beers as they have almost everything alcoholic ... Having said that their food menu will surprise you with the quality and the time taken to get served ... I am a true foodie so I relish the bong in me by ordering fish and there fish tikka , grilled fish, fish finger everything is lip smacking and I have not got disappointed for even once ... However the place is expensive but true value for money ... Music is average as they play loads of Bollywood and gets shut dot 12am

We paid a visit to this place last month, in January. I personally like the ambience - the huge glass windows offer a great view of Salt lake.

We ordered Thai corn for the appetizers. The portion was good. Food was nicely served. The taste was pretty good as well.

For mains, we ordered Fish and Chips, and crisp skin Kolkata betki. I was pretty much disappointed with the Fish and Chips. The fish was actually fish cutlet (the Bong way) and not the way fish is fried in the original Fish and chips you get in the UK. The fish cutlet was good though. The baked betki was pretty good. The mash was tasty. They also served some veggies on the side. A sauce was served which I liked a lot. The portion was quite good.

The staff welcomed us well, they served well. They also helped us with the discount once I realised I could not use the corporate discount as I was not carrying my office photo ID. Check with the staff the discounts they offer on various bank cards. I got a discount on hdfc card.

I have been there to Afraa twice. 

First time we went for the continental Al a carte menu and yes probably this place serves one of the best fish and chips in Kolkata. For the second time we opted for a buffet lunch and the spread was wonderful.

The ambiance is very nice, service is noteworthy and the waiters are courteous enough.

To conclude this place is very much recommended.

In one word i loved everything about this place. I've been going to city centre since 2010 and found out this place after 6 years.
About the decor its absolutely amazing blue mild lights spacious white couches large space soothing music what more would you want in a lounge.
We arrived a minute before 8 still the waiter got us happy hours which nearly saved us almost 2000/- for drinks. Happy smiling waiter ready to serve with his best. This is what the city is lacking these days The customer Service. Way too impressed.
When we informed that we'd go for seesha they took us to the open rooftop area which had a beautiful view of the city from the 6th floor.
Coming down to food we ordered Budweisers (happy hour made it 6) black dog large (happy hours made it 2), seesha teen paan flavoured with vanilla. one nonveg platter which had jumbo prawns nicely coated and fried, mutton kebabs, chicken kebabs and fish kebabs. Fish topped them all. And one afraa pizza, thin crust good amount of cheese and right blend of flavour. Drinks were accompanied with spiced pine nuts and cheezys. Absolutely worth 4500/- will surely visit you anytime soon. Thank you Afraa for this amazing and beautiful night.

I've been to the lounge area innumerable times and never was I disappointed. However, visiting the restaurant for the first time for a Sunday Brunch was a not so pleasant experience.
Though it says unlimited drinks, you'll only be treated with whatever is available at the bar on that particular Sunday. They had Bloody Mary, Mojito, Screw driver and another rum based cocktail on their list that day along with Fosters! Well, I've had better cocktails and what they offered didn't even taste good, leave aside the high.
The starters were the only good thing on their list. 2 veg and 2 non veg starters were worth the visit.
Moving on to the main course, they had both Indian and Chinese but not even a single item satisfied our taste buds.
Desserts too were a disappointment.
All in all, I would not recommend the Sunday brunch to anyone.

Lovely place, I must say. The ambience itself leaves you in a pleasant mood. Visit this place and you'll know why it features in the Romantic collection. :) 
Friendly staff. 
We went for the buffet. Honestly, the taste was nothing great. The pizza at the beginning was rather nice. One star less for that.
They however have a lot of varieties in the desert section.
Price is on the higher side. But that's totally worth it compared to the time spent there.
Surely Recommended.

Went there last Saturday, and we opted for the lunch buffet. First thing about this is the decor and the view from the restaurant. Its too good. Coming to the food part, for starters there were a no. of salads, from which the fish one deserves a special mention. I liked the pizza too. For the main course, there was veg fried rice, chicken, fish (which I loved the most) & mutton. The mutton was not cooked well, but the chicken & fish preparation was well to do. The no. of deserts there were very less according to me. But overall the service there was really nice, the waiters were all well behaved and always ready to help.

Celebrated my bday here! And im more than happy with the entire experience! To begin with, the ambience is soothing with the dim lights and soft music, the staff is very warm and courteous and are concerned about the guests,and  the menu can satiate any foodie! We ordered the famous veg platter,gnocchi, hakka noodles and the four seasons thin crust pizza. The food was good and appreciated by all. However the highlight of the evening was the presence of a violinist while i cut the cake- a surprise by Afraa, a moment which will stay with me for a long long time :)

I hardly visit kolkata and do not know much about restaurants; then while looking for something around salt lake I came across Afraa and decided to take all of my aunt's and uncles for a lazy lunch :D I loved the ambiance and its separate hide out for group. It was a lunch time and the place was bright and lovely. The outside view was great even at noon. I have no issues visiting this place again but I found it bit expensive.

Here is my detail review on what we tried

Starters-

    slow roasted mushroom soup - average

    Turkish chicken - Good

    Bhetki piccata - Perfect taste. recommended

    Paneer Tikka - Average

Main course

   lasagna - the combination of herbs used for the dish was awesome and the    dish itself was mouthwatering :P

  bhuna gosht adraki - gravy was worth trying. however I found the meat was missing the right softness.

 Kadai Paneer - just right on taste buds

Masala Kulcha- Good

Hakka Noodles - Average

Desert

Every one was full by this time and so just for name sake we ordered one tiramisu to share. I am glad that everyone loved it.

The best thing that I tried was lime juice :) It was awesome. Seriously..!

The staff was courteous and the decor was just right for fine dining.

Went there after buying vouchers from Nearbuy. It was worth the price. 2 mocktails were really great. The taste of chicken curry and mutton curry in the main course was too good. Dessert section could have been improved by adding freshly cut fruits and some other types of sweets as well. Overall it was worth the money.

We opt for Aafra whenever we are in the mood to indulge or treat someone, since it is the closest option with a good spread and guaranteed good food and service and therefore this review has been due a long time! The last I visited was somewhere in mid december post a shopping spree. My favourite and goto comfort dish is the mushroom and mascarpone ravioli which never fails to satiate me. I am very particular about how my mushroom sauce is prepd. there are very few places in the city that actually bother pureeing the mushrooms before adding them to the roux. They simply toss cream and chopped mushrooms together and pass that off as mushroom sauce. Aafra knows how to do its thing and which is why I totally highly rate their ravioli as the bestest!! Pizzas are also our usual choice but otherwise our other staple are the pork chops and or grilled chicken. Though here I would mention that the last time around the grilled chicken was tougher and drier than usual. I guess someone popped in the oven and forgot all about it for a while. On mentioning this to our regular server Subroto (who by the way is a gem!) by way of service recovery offered us some amazing desserts on the house, so brownie points for that! A little hiccup here and there but one place that we shall keep going back to! keep up the good work!!

New year's eve n dinner date for me😊 it was a candle light dinner with live violin tunes behind!.. The all over chiaroscuro ambience mesmerised me!..
Started with refreshin cocktails gateway sunrise,french tea. Huge collection of starters..we opted for garlic n cracked peppercorn prawns..one of the chef's choice..just lipsmackin.. In the main course you get exquisite dishes.. We tried seafood rissotto.i liked the peculiar taste..
Its bit swanky and the best part is the view you get..city skyline at night..from 7th floor..mindblowing.. The service was warm throughout and they bid adieu with chocolate pan!!..

Is there any rating more than 5? They know how to keep the fame intact. Pizzas, starters mocktails main courses and deserts, wooh, mouth watering. Very very polite and welcoming staffs, the mousse and the pizza were just deadly. Every time I go there, the mutton preparation amazes me. Keep it up.

After a lot of discussion and argument they finally decided this place for my birthday treat. Ambience is great with dim lights and I especially liked the outside seating arrangement. We ordered pasta, kebab platter and baby corn. All of them were very good especially kebab platter. Amazing place to spend time with your loved ones.Lots of memories associated with this place after that wonderful evening.

Lovely place for evening hangout with friends and buddies though a bit expensive. I love the open area of Afraa Lounge, good peppy music and lighting couple with nice food. The interior design and sitting arrangement is good if you are a group of people wanting to have some chilled out time.
The place does turn into a party place with loud music and bustling crowd at peak hours and weekends.. as supposed to be :) 

I love the view from this place.. sunsets with a drink and a composed environment is what you like then this is the place for you to be at.

Today went to the restaurant with my wife for the Christmas lunch. The ambience is amazing since it is located at the 7th floor. The sevice is also good. Now since we opted for the buffet I can't comment on the quantity but the quality was good. Surprisingly there were only 2 starters. So please think twice before going for the buffet if u love starters. Overall I would say it is very overpriced & we have many better options in that price range.

I went for a lunch on 25th December alone as I wanted to treat myself. As soon as I entered the host wished me and asked how many people I said one and his reaction  was horrible. If u don't allow single people put a board outside ur restaurant typical marwadi way of thinking. I had suggested this place to my friends and work colleagues bit for sure will do a negative publicity for sure now onwards. U guys shuld shut down ur restaurant or put board saying single people not allowed disgusting to the core

Thank you Afraa for hosting my birthday lunch yesterday. The hospitality and ambiance was spot on...Subrata had been very attentive throughout. 

The food was excellent. I prefer continental; the baked fish was succulent but crisp on the outside, just right. The impromptu pizza baked on a toasted roti was brilliant; it served well as an appetizer without filling us up. The mutton preparation (from the buffet) was delicious and the chunks were very soft; my parents are still raving about it. The selection of salads (particularly Hawaiian chicken and tandoori aloo bharwan) was much appreciated by my husband. Of course, your selections of whiskeys and wine made an excellent company for the spread at our table. 

It was an afternoon well-spent, so thank you once again.

Their Sunday brunch having a wide spread along with unlimited drinks is definitely a hit with friends. To our surprise, AAFRA also came up with a well decorated cheesecake when a friend's birthday got revealed!!
Good ambiance, good food and good staff.

Myself and my girl were back to where we have visited innumerable times -- Afraa but this time it was all the more special, as this was our last date before marriage. As the restaurant was closed, hence we opted for the lounge which is essentially the rooftop and provides a beautiful view of the city once its dark. Nice ambiance, with a battery lit candle on the table, it is a good place.

1. Chilly Cheese Toast : It was excellent. Properly cooked, with loads of cheese in it. It is what you call Afraa standard maintained

2. Penne with smoked chicken, caper, bacon, sun dried tomato & cream : Ahh !!! This was excellent. Properly cooked, with loads of white sauce and finely cut chunks of chicken, this was bang on but again to find a fault, the bacon was very overcooked. It could have been fried a little less. It become chewy.

Now the reason I deducted 1 point was solely because of the lack of option. I understand in a lounge starters, hookah and drinks brings in most of the moolah but I fail to understand why on earth would you have only 1 non-veg pasta? no risotto? hardly any non veg starters. Why would there be such a stark difference in the varieties present between Afraa restaurant on the 7th floor and lounge on the 6th?

This is my first visit to Afraa, City Center 1. Its located on the 6th and 7th floor with a brilliant bird's eye view of the area; as far as the interior is concerned the place is well crafted with big glass walls and nice abstract light structure above the table.
I skiped the soup and started the supper wth 
Grilled chicken wth garlic mashed potato & veg infused wth vat 69 scotch jus and mix cress - a nice dish with a subtle taste. The course continued through diff dishes. But the desert was th star of th show :
Ginger biscuit wth orange basil icecream. :) its a must try dish.

Tried lunch buffet at Afraa restaurant. The buffet has wide range in the salads and main course section but the starter is a bit weak. The starter has one vegetarian and one non-vegetarian item with pizzas. The problem is, say a person is on a non-vegetarian diet but does not like chicken. Now, this person has hardly anything to select in the starters, as there is only one non-vegetarian starter and that has chicken as the main food item.
Salads have plenty of options and so is the main course. Liked chicken salad and grilled fish. 
The dessert section has 4 to 5 items and all are quite good.
Overall, for Rs. 500 + tax, the buffet is a good value for money.

The lounge has the perfect setting for an outing in winters..

The Mojito is one of the best in the city definitely and their staff is also very cordial and helping. The sheesha is also super good.

Only negative being that food options very limited as they have specific hours for serving pizza. And other options are very limited and compared to earlier the quality has gone down a lot.

So this is a perfect place for me when I just want to sit and relax with sheesha and drinks with friends and only in winters.

Had been waiting to visit this place for a long long time. Expected lots of goods, but as my rating suggests. I was left disappointed. Ordered Bhetki picatta and Turkish chicken shish kebabs for starter. Picatta was sort of butter fish as we know. Tasted good. Other than this in main course order was Lamb shanks, Pollo di graziela and Scottish grilled salmon. Graziela chicken not cooked so good, shanks was OK, and salmon was raw. 
Well there you go, either I had a bad day there, or its that bad a restuarent. 
Hopefully, next time I visit I would be served better.

This place has the most amazing ambience ever. Right on the seventh floor of G block, it has this breathtaking view from its open air balcony cum smoking zone . We tried out their groupon menu and although the service and the spread can be improved upon, some of the dishes were brilliant. They have this fish salad that hits you with its oh-so-many flavours and their pizza has a thin munchy crust with a creamy spread on top. Fish begum bahar in the main course simply blew me away! And coming to the desserts, loved their strawberry mousse and brownie with ice cream toppings. Last but definitely not the least was their peach and water melon mocktail that was one of the most refreshing drinks I have ever tried out.

On a beautiful Saturday Afternoon we went for a buffet Lunch..
Place: The best thing of this place is the view from 7th Floor..I feel it will even better in Evening..Spacious..Interior decoration made his own identity..Though we sat at a crowded place..

Staffs:AS a foodie I used to visit many restaurants but never reviewed,if something special is not happens.... Here comes their staffs..

Their Staffs are very  friendly,well mannered,and knowledgeable.They took us from the door,and took my attention..second,they answered my every query patiently about the food & help me to gather more the knowledge of  the Food(mainly desert)..They take care every bit of us.One of them is SUBHABROTO..He is a nice guy with decent behavior.Even they politely ask me,if there is any special occasion of that visit??When they know its my better-half's birthday..They offer us to wait for 15 min..so that they can arrange and we can celebrate the occasion with cake and all that stuff,which we  politely denied..

Foods:..Comes to food it is nice as always..Specially the Pizza.Chicken Starter(cant remember the name) is good..But their is also chances of of improvement.specially the Non veg preparations..DESERTS are one of the good things of  this restaurant..Actually the buffet lunch is 3 out of 5..,which can be improved a lot ...My expectation is quiet high from you Afraa..

Been there couple of times and surely will plan many more soon. They have a very good staff and the crown in here is descent. @Afraa, do u still have the live band performance goin on? Please lemme know. For those who have not been there, please visit once and i promise u wont be disappointed. :)

I can say about this place that they probably have the best cocktails in whole salt lake area with such a massive list of cocktails and Thanks to Mr Pratyush Goswami and the whole team of afraa who tries  their label best to make this place BEST not only in salt lake but all over kolkata.
Frankly speaking every one complains about their food. According to me this place is all about to have nice drinks and enjoy in a beautiful ambience.If you get hungry they also have some finger food and it's really nice. They do nice mixed grill platter and Dry chilly chicken.Overall this place is renowned for prides itself on,it's cocktail ,music and their ambience and I can report that all of that is deserved.
So if you are looking for a fun or casual night out with friends,this place is GREAT!!!

we crashed in before 8 and could avail the happy hours offer. got into the 6th floor..It's very spacious and pretty calm for a bar. Decent staff. we had miller and long island iced tea. Comfortably affordable. It's good for a date night,u might want to look elsewhere during party and rock mode. 

the funny thing was that they denied of a table saying it's already full when my guy called , I had to call 2 min later to get us a table. :P ;) 
(no reservation needed for the 6th floor though)

Ambience and gourmet meals..
The perfect combination that describes Afraa..
I went there on Diwali, with my elder sis for the buffet lunch menu.
The spread was not humongous but the quality was top notch !!
There were a number of cold salads in the starters accompanied with some excellent pizza , Chicken ham and pork omlettes and all.
The one area where I felt there could have been a little improvement is the desserts section..
The strawberry mousse that was served felt kind of bland and watery and the apple cake felt a tad more dry than normal.

If these two can be addressed , the a big 5 star from my side !!

I have been to place for a couple of times only. This is located in CC1, Salt Lake. Both times I went for dinner.

Very spacious interior without clumsy arrangement of tables. The decor is very good with dim lights and I particularly like the inverted glass decoration.

Theres a candle placed in each table and as the server greets you for the first time he lights the candle and the dim lights along with the candle and a great view of Kolkata outside (only few tables have that view) gives you a feel of candle light dinner. In short the effort given behind the decor shows in the ambiance of the restaurant which is quite good.

We ordered Poppy Seed crusted chicken morsels with campari chilli deep which is a new dish that I have tried and its quite good. They give you sticks of chicken having covered with poppy seeds.

Personally I ordered some Liquors which were not available though they were present on menu (Jagermeister, Cointreau) and had to opt for White Wine. Each time the server had to go back to the counter and then come back with confirmation that the drink is not available. Staffs were just okay in being attentive and being knowledgeable.

We went for pizza in the main course. They have  some delicious thin crust pizza available.

Was too full to have dessert. Will definitely look forward to my next visit soon.

There are restaurants where you go for the food. And there are restaurants where you go for the experience. Afraa defines the latter. Although i am not a huge fan of their food, when you consider the spick & spank maintenance, the courteous service, the floating candles, and live music into the experience, you can almost let go of the fact that the food alone in this place is not great enough to be the usp. Dont get me wrong, the food is great. When you compare however, somehow it still falls short. Overall though, a great experience.

I have been to this place twice in September 2015 and I am quite satisfied in both of my visit.This place is one of my best restaurant visit of this year. The location of this restaurant is perfect and easily accessible if you are nearby saltlake city center-I and hence it is a demanded place for the corporate people for lunch and dinner option.The facility of bar is an extra mark to this place.The service is too good.One thing which I like is the variations on each day they provide with their cuisine.They have a separate live counter which you can find in quite a few places now in kolkata. So this place is a must be in your option if you are in salt lake and looking for couple lunch/dinner.

After hearing much about this place from colleagues, i finally decided to try this place out on my fiancés birthday. So they had this sunday brunch in place with unlimited wines and cocktails followed by starters and main course and ending with lovely deserts. What i must say is that if u r planning for a Sunday brunch then u must try this place once definitely. Not only do they serve amazing food, but they also have amazing and courteous staff. For lot of you who is unaware, they do offer corporate discounts to employees of organisations like TCS, Wipro CTS etc. All u need to do is carry your official id card with u and present it before billing. 
In terms of wine they serve u with Sula (both red and white wine), they have breezers, vodka based cocktails and obviously soft drinks and other accompaniments. In starters they would provide with pizza, fish fingers, some assorted veg kebabs and it keeps on changing. Their main course is not out of the world but the quality of food is quite decent and u would love it. 
The best part about this place is the ambience and the nice view (only few tables have nice views). So make sure u make ur reservation and head up for a nice sunday brunch. U can obviously njoy the lounger on the 7th floor with a nice view of city center and cool winds (if u r lucky with a nice weather).

Affra is one of those few places in the city which has been being an example of class decor amazing crowd awesome musics and great food in the city...it was still there when many of the bars and restaurants were not in the city and they were not even aware of such lounge of its stature.I have been going to this place for a long time we kind of have grown up going to this place and thus it carries many such evenings which has an emotional connect with us....of many lounges in the city affra stands apart for its beautiful cozy yet so plush ambience mixing amazingly with the outerdeck which throws an amazing view of the city to all the diners.As soon as you enter this place it will strike you so hard you won't be able to resist yourself from coming again and again...the happy hours are a showstopper...right from the food the hookah the music the service ...affra nails it all....I would even go back to this place even after 15 years from now.

My favorite hangout in Salt Lake. Calm and away from the crowd below in the mall. What i love most about the place is the open terrace sitting. Whether it be day or evening its always a treat to sit out. Food as usual is great and served hot. Drinks are costly but the happy hours make up for it. 

Pizzas and the pasta are tasty and make up your mood.

Nicely done restaurant decent ambience, average food and not so attentive staff.
The food menu is more fusion than specialty, Italian, Indian, Thai etc. We ordered a vegetarian mixed platter, fish for starters and Thai curry rice for main course. Starter was decent but Thai curry and rice was horrible,the young man serving us realized this before we could point out and offered to re do it. But we were put off by the quality of rice being served at this premium outlet. 
The managment should look into the quality + menu and focus only on what their chef do the best Italian and Indian. The desert and mock tail menu should have more choice .
Plus it should reduce the staff as there were many moving around aimlessly, talking among them selves.
Overall it's one of the better places around the vicinity. Will visit again.

Great place. Justr loved the food. But we had to wait inspite of booking we had.  At point in time the staff looked puzzled about the time we need to wait.   There should be a waiting area with adequate sitting arrangement for elderly people and children. However the food was awesome so was the behaviour of person who was serving us.

Visisted this place couple of times with fmily and friedns. It is superb. The food, the ambience, the decor everything will make you happy. The interior is excellent with floor to ceiling big windows that let lots of natual lights to brighten up the place. Sitting chairs are the very comfortable and soothing colors are used all over. They have a small open air arrangements with couches. Food is very tasty and very well served. Waiters are well aware of the different dishes and to me it is very important factors while placing the order. Price was it is probably one of the costliest in the locality, but at the you probably will not mind sheeling a few extra bucks as you get what you deserve.

Had a great experience in Afraa. We had the lunch buffet which included starters like chiken pakoras , chicken pizza , veg corn pizza which were all so fabulous. Also we had  2 awesome mocktail drinks - Virgin Mojito and blue lagoon . Among the salads one must try out the chiken salad and fish salad which were mixed with mayonaisse and were just fantabulous. The salads also included vegetable salads which were equally exceptional. You must not miss out on the juices stacked beside the salads. The main course included rice , dal, paneer , potato dish , fish , chicken , and mutton , all were equally amazing. We also savoured on desserts like brownie , mousse, rasgulla , cheesecake and chocolate icecream . I liked the pineapple mousse most . On the whole there s no better place than Afraa to enjoy such a warm experience as it provides a full view of cc1 along with indulging in such appetising dishes!!

"CLASSY" if you were to describe Afraa in a single word.With ceiling high glasses offering a great view,light music the ambience was just superb.We had the buffet lunch.
Started off with a mocktail/cocktail as per our wish. The mocktail included Virgin mojito and forr the cocktail had the Fosters Beer.The drinks were repeated once more with u getting either the same choice of micktail or a different one.
In the starters there was a Veg and Nin veg menu along with Veg and Non veg pizza.
Coming to the main course,we first came across the variety of salads-4 beg salads and 3 non veg salads.Among the Non veg salads,the chicken salad was just tol yummy-mayonaisse along with small pieces of chicken were sure the favourites.Also at the sides were stacked shots of various juices which also we enjoyed.
In the main course,there was soup,rice,daal,panner, a veg dish,steamed fried rice,fish in hunan sauce,afghani ghost curry and Chicken.
All the dishes were equally good with the Fish in hunan sauce topping the list.

Coming to the desserts,there was Chocolate Tart, 2 different kinds of Mousse,cheese cake,brownie and chocolate cake and ice cream.
It even didn't ended here there was a separate section for paan even.

To add to all,the waiters were too courteous with all smiles.
Definately would recommend anyone to visit this place and enjoy a mouth watering experience.

Well decorative. Food was Just awesome. The buffet is little expensive. But there are a lot numbers of dishes available in buffet. I personally couldn't taste all of them, otherwise I could have burst out 😂 . Each dish was delicious. The quality of food is good. The service was also very warm!! So it was a good day spent. Soon will visit again.

Afraa, one of the finest restaurants at Salt Lake (Kolkata) where I had my buffet lunch is really a lovely experience. The ambience is good, food - especially the non veg items are great in taste and behavior of the staff members are nice. However, the management should be earnest enough to increase the varieties, mainly in the dessert section ( where price is not a concern ) to give total satisfaction to the food lovers. Yet, taking it into consideration Afraa Restaurant and Lounge at Salt Lake Kolkata deserves strong recommendation.

Food was yum, ambience good too. they have a great view from up here.We had booked buffet through groupon and afraa was not reluctant to serve extra drinks, and they did not charge us too.Of all the cuisine, I liked continental the most. Keep up the name!The person who served us had a smile perched on right from the time he received us to the time we were done...a special thanks to you(sorry guys, dint ask his name)...for all your patience and service.

The thing that I remember about this restaurant is the ambience.. Double thumbs up for that!! 
Anyone ever mentions Afraa Lounge to me and the first thing that comes to my mind are the comfortable couches, lovely seating arrangements, etc. 

Of course the food was good and the service wasn't bad either.. But you should visit this place just for the overall experience it provides...
And come to think of it the food was actually kinda nice.. Delicious in fact.. Lots of variety..
All in all an afternoon well spent :)

Afraa has always been a special lounge from its inception. The brilliant white decor ( though losing sheen recently) with the lavish couches and perfect lighting makes this place my favorite party destination in Kolkata.
If you are heading to this place on a weekend make sure you enter pretty early else you would never get an outdoor table. I am fond on the outdoors because you can see a large part of Kolkata over your beer or shisha. To add to the cool ambience they have candlelit tables , which keep glowing till the end of your time there. Well they aren't actually candles that is ;)
Coming to food and drinks. They have happy hours till 8 and there is one on one on almost the entire drinks menu including imported beer, which is a plus as in most places they offer domestic liquor only for happy hours.
They make good cocktails , LIIT , mohito and Sex on the Beach are good enough.
Kolkata baked bhekti is a personal favorite and they make it according to your taste with preferred sauces. Apart from that usual pizzas kababs are decent. 
But the prawn that used to be outstanding 3 years ago, sucks now apparently.
The Sunday brunch at the restaurant is also pretty nice with all continental dishes and awesome desserts.
Overall it does dig a hole on your pocket but backs it up with a happy justification !

Afraa..
This is one of my all time favourite Place.
The attraction of this place is its ambience and its ourdoor sitting...
There was a time when we use to go to AFRAA every saturday to chill out with friends..We simple love sitting at their outside section with cold breeze & hookah giving us a good company...This place has its uniqueness in itself...Whenvr there is any occassion among the friend groups we still plan for AFRAA..Afraa is a place which can be said as one of the best lounges in kolkata because of its awesome music superb ambience and damn good quality of food.Although we dont drink we prefer going to this place just for hookah and their foodies...
Saturdays are fun because the crowd out there is just the best of the city...
In short an amazing a unique place and a place in which you will never get bored even if you go there everyday...

The stewards were courteous, They were asking many a times if we were having any problem with taste or spice etc.  Food : we have ordered prawn nd pork both was very tasty. The price was little bit higher . Ambience: the place is very romantic nd classy . You can call a proper fine dining restaurant.

Afraa lounge with its comfy, lazy, laid back ambience and good music is a perfect place for an evening chill. Whether you want to hang out with friends or or take out someone for a date, it suits the needs perfectly. The dance floor adds a star to its ratings. The outside sitting arrangements provide a good view of salt lake. Hookah is average. Food is at par with the quality standard expected out of the brand. The bar is well stocked and the DJ plays good music. Overall. A fulfilling experience.

Years and years it's been, since I am visiting Afraa. Salt Lake City in Kolkata has hardly any pubs to offer. This, is undoubtedly the finest! The view from the deck is brilliant and feels just perfect around the fall time! 
▼▼▼▼
2 things : 
There's this serious seating issue and if you're in a big group, make prior bookings especially if you want to be seated outside and enjoy the weather along with Hukkah! Food is good, music decent, crowd is bad. Would not really bump into many youth. They should start profiling now!

Tried Lebanese non veg platter as a Lebanese festival was going on. Overall it was very good. Betki dish in small bites section of the menu was rather poor - no idea that it will be fried with a thick batter with comparatively less portion of fish. For the main course opted for International Grill - slow cooked pork chops   and salmon. Salmon was excellent, pork was good too, however the pork cuts were fatty, we expected slightly leaner variant. Ambience is decent but you may not like high pitch sound of music from the lounge of 6th FL.

Afraa has become a tradition for us. Yess from last 4 years its a rule to go to afraa on Nabami night!!
Not only this, be it a GNO or an after ofc chill, be it a hookah treat or a lasagne, be it a -no place to go so we are here- or a mood swing.
Just one complain is "you are too expensive" so am cutting one point! !
But still if there is no plan on nabami we are again going there with the gang (though thay have already given a red alert for the same) but am sure this place is the nearest so....u know I have mentioned in the beginning **tradition**

It was good bt not best. It could have been much much better. There was lack of seasoning. No seasoning was provided on the table. 
As for the Poached Chicken Breast the chicken was very hard. It should have been soft and juicy.

And thanks to Rohan, the person who served for his mind blowing way of attending guests

We had an amazing experience in Afraa restaurant last week , when we visited during the Tuscany food festival . The food was delectable - we choose the salmon tartare salad and a lamb special from their special Tuscany menu, and we were not amazed. The server at our table ( subhra) made my first visit there extremely memorable . In addition to this we were also part of an exquisite olive oil tasting . And the violin playing flawlessly... It was an experience . All in all I would come back again and again for more .

Words are not enough to define afraa. The lounge is one of the best for sheesha lovers and the food is mesmerizing too. You can chill in open space as u can feel the breeze on the sixth floor . I love chilling out here with friends and cousins. Its a blessing in disguise for food lovers as well as sheesha lovers. Although a little pricey but its worth it.

Very nice place to visit for alcohol and drink .But if you want a lunch or dinner it's not that type . I have visited and tried tangy pasta and a desert here .That pasta was a drawback it was not Italian type classic pasta But the desert was truly fabulous .I'll visit again to try something different for sure .

Not bad service but the spread for a buffet Sunday brunch. V disappointing. To my surprise they were serving eggs for brunch as their live counter. A Italian would have been preffered. Have a look at the photo which they called the " scrambled egg " when asked for.

Went to this place on last Friday for lunch. After getting into that place the first thing that will struck you is the view from that 7th floor restaurant. Big glass pane allows ample of natural light to lit the restaurant which really looks nice.

We didn't go for the regular buffet. Started with Smoked salmon, dill and caper tartare. Washed it down with Michele Chiarlo Gavi white wine. Followed by Crispy Andhra calamari and Tangra style pork. Finished it off with non-veg platter.
The salad was amazing the salmon was done perfectly. Wasn't quite happy with the non-veg platter, fried prawns were really oily. Asked them to do the grill fully done but it was half done. But the tangra style pork stole the show. That was delicious. I'll go back for that again and again.
It will be a bit heavy on your pocket but this place is worth trying once at least.

This is without a doubt the best 'Afraa' in our city (no disrepect to the creperie & delis as they are good too). The ambience is amazing & the service immaculate. The buffet is expensive but the spread is very good. What I liked most about them are the cocktails & the salmon salad (from the menu), which I'd mentioned in the review for the creperie. A wonderful place for dining out on special days (or nights).

No complaints about the place. View amazing, quality of items great, very nice hangout with friends, rather one of best ambience iv come accross in kolkata. V chilled and relaxed. However service is something wch realllly needs overhaul. General attitude of waiters is unexcusable. Sometimes even harsh. That forms v imp part of hospitality industry, hence the lower stars by me. Small mention aboyt the crowd which has degraded over the years. Hardly can any one control that but its a turn off for me and iv resisted visiting the plc for this reason on several occasions hence had to mention this. Pls see if nethng can be done at this front as well. Cheers!

I have been here with friends. They are giving a treat for some achievement and what can be a better option than Afraa. Ambience too good, interior decorations are great and innovative. Even you can get a vivid view from the top most place of CC1. We have taken a window table and place our order. We took Mahi Tikka Ajwaini which is a fish based starter item and tastes Hatke! We had also ordered Bhatti ka Jheenga which is a prawn based delicacy. You must try it at least once even if you are not fond of prawns. Then we went on to main course and had hakka noodles and Fish n Chips. Hakka noodles is sooooooo tasty that you can have it without any side dish. It's the best noodles ever I have tasted so far! Fish n Chips is predictable and quite common among the lot. We were too full after eating all these, but.... still went for a dessert. They called it Chocolate Jalapeno. It's mouth-watering. Plz, try it. While having this dessert we all felt like we can have 10 more of these! And thus all's well that ends well. I will definitely visit this place again. Last but not the least this place is always full of customers even on weekdays during peak business hours, so please preplan and go.

Great Place !!!  Much better in winter evenings or breezy evenings , as you can sit in the terrace area to enjoy your food , drinks and sheesha.  6th floor is the lounge and is without doubt one of the best in Kolkata. One of the very few places where you can enjoy food, drinks ,sheeha together in open air. 7th floor is the restaurant , which is quite good too.  Place is sufficiently big and very well maintained.  Only the service is a little slow but is well compensated by the ambience and food quality.  You will definitely have a good time here !!!!

This is undoubtedly one of the best restaurants of Kolkata. The ambience, lighting, cutlery, service, atmosphere, feeling is just fantastic. Its menu offers all types of cuisines and delicacies from around the world. All their dishes are equally good. Their service is amazing. And their glass bottle attraction is so artistic ! After your "happy meal" the complimentary chocolate paan becomes the most sweet "icing on the cake". It ia the only restaurant where I can eat the same favourites all the time without getting bored. Get to their door without second thought. I have already visited the restaurant more than ten times and hence am a reliable person(as I hope). Kudos to the people who made this place exist : the Neotias !

Located at the city center 1, the view of the city from this restaurant is worth watching for, specially if you are here on a cloudy day. A unique white decor, even the waiting area seems to give you a really good view of the city.

I had visited the restaurant a couple of times but the review is limited to my last visit one fine evening. To start off I ordered a drink along with Chicken shish kabab and a non veg platter. The shish kabab was really tasty and went well the drink. 

On the main course I had the Chilli blast which was worth mentioning. Do give it a try.

If you are having a few drinks and dinner, this is going to be a slight pocket pincher to you.

I also had the buffet which they serve during my past visits, but somehow I feel that the quality and spread of the food have degraded a lot in the recent times.

This extensive review owes hugely to ZOMATO n AFRAA. The review is divided into two parts, the dinner arranged by ZOMATO n the sumptuous lunch buffet, a gift from AFRAA.

The ZOMATO Dinner

This time Zomato arranged the foodie meet up at AFRAA. Afraa, Resto Lounge was a place I had been wishing to visit and kept it for something special. Ultimately, I visited to spend a very special evening. The décor of this place calls to celebrate all “special” things in one’s life. Situated at the top of City Centre 1, the view is nothing less than enchanting for a city I love so much. The lighting, seating arrangements and the music all clubs in perfectly to create an evening you are not going to forget soon and the same will beckon you over and over again to create new memories.

Our table was already laden with unique starters from Mediterranean, Chinese and Italian cuisines and we were offered amazing Sangrias or other spirits at our arrival. I chose the Sangria and didn’t bother to move over to other drinks as this tasted phenomenal. For, starters we had Mediterranean pita bread with different kinds of cheese, Mango in chili with feta cheese on papadams, some fruits and pizzas. Pizzas and mango chilli were a hit among all while the pita breads and fruits were left alone by most. Here in Afraa, I have noticed both the times their pizzas are one of a kind. They are “healthy pizzas”. Their homemade tomato sauce over the very thin pizza base topped with unique toppings like onion and chicken/ olives and goat cheese / basil and corn makes for very healthy pizzas. Then arrived the we had the vindaloo marinated chicken sticks and fried tofu in sauce both were done nicely. Then came the main dish -- Tiger prawn and grilled bhetki in mango pickled ginger chili dressing with assorted vegetables in butter sauce; Rosemary and roasted garlic chicken in mushrooms sauce. I had the prawns and fish and it was really good, flavorful and filling. The chicken on the other hand was not very exceptional and could have been tender and juicy. But nonetheless, all our cravings were put to rest by the awesome desserts served --- chocolate jalapeno mud cake, orange basil ice cream and mascarpone quenelles with blue berry macaroons!!! The presentation and the innovation of the dessert platter took me by surprise and a wonderful one at that. The dessert tasted phenomenally awesome and as they say alls well that ends well and this proved it to me for once and for all.

The lunch arranged by AFRAA

A monsoon Sunday afternoon at about 1pm I entered Afraa with my friends to enjoy their all you can eat and drink brunch buffet. We were made to wait at the waiting area of Afraa, which was an open area roof top which had phenomenal views of the entire saltlake city and since monsoon what amazing painting on the sky by the clouds of grey Gandalf and white Gandalf! :P The wait for the table set our mood for the lunch for sure.

As usual, the staff - immensely polite, welcoming and warm asked our preferences for the drink and started serving their starters on the table. The starters had their signature pizzas, corn cheese in a cup and Fish Amritsari. The fish was soft and full of flavor and the pizzas were again light, hearty and healthy as I found it before. The corn cheese in a cup were finger foods which became a hit in our table.

The Drinks they served deserve special mention as the cocktails they had in a buffet surpasses any other restaurant in Kolkata. One has access to Wine(red and white), Foster beer, Red Label Whisky, Bacardi Rum, Vladivar Vodka unlimited in this Sunday brunch! Plus they whip up amazing cockatils and mocktails as much as you would want and wish for. And all these clubbed with mouth-watering pizza and pasta and starters for only 1200 seems like a steal. We all ordered at our hearts content and continued trying the delicacies served.

I personally preferred their Pasta which had a live counter, I ordered a hawaiin pizza with pinapple topping, I simply gorged on their Fish in lemon butter sauce and Mutton preparations. The dessert had brownies and gulab jamuns to my delight. We spend a quality 4 hours at Afraa and a Sunday afternoon have never been spend this well before.

Afraa’s plus will always be its locations, its presentation, the humble staff and their perfect brew with their signature pizza and pasta. If this is all you are looking for, head straight to Afraa.

I want to thank Afraa and Zomato for inviting me not once but twice to make such amazing memories to last for a lifetime.

Although the main course wasn't much to my liking, the starters were indubitably good, but the show stoppers for us were the cocktails. The servers unfortunately did not know the names of some of the drinks served to us, but  we had mojitos, caprioskas, a vodka and kiwi bartender's special and a whiskey based bartender's special cocktails. All of them were really good.
The main course and the desserts can be improved quite a bit.
Ambience and sitting arrangements are perfect.

When you walk into Afraa the first thing which strikes you is that the place is expensive, And hell ya it is but worth every penny of it. If you r Looking for a distraction free not so loud evening with your close friends/family/bf/gf... then this is exactly where you should be. If I had to describe the Afraa experience in one word, it would be 'classy'.  There is absolutely nothing you can complain about, be it the decor, the lighting, the food or the service. Even if you have to wait to get a table, you can do so on a beautiful balcony which gives a view of the entire City Centre mall, a beauty in itself. For ur 1st experience u cn gv a try on happy hours . Hukkha awsm, food super, no complain.  They got outside and in side sitting choice is urs. If you styng at kolkata n pissd of with ur life n this city,  thn gv a try on this restaurant,  trust me u gona lov ur city aftr watchng view from this balcony.  Aftr a big busy day u will forget all ur worries for a moment n gona seriously enjoy the hospitality n beauty of this place

Yesterday I went to this lounge for a party.. The ambiance is cozy with dim lights and good music with leather couches. The food was very tasty. But what I would recommend the most would be their cocktails. Price is a bit on the upper side but this place is fun to be.. There is also open air spaces for hukka and stuffs.. One could surely give it a try for a romantic evening or if one wants to party hard.. The music was good and the dance floor was spacious..

All of us didn't even felt like eating main course . Hookah which was called shisha or something here is only allowed inside and it rained in about 10mins after we got hookah and they neither did they gave us anything complementary nor the cheery cheese pineapple was good it had salted amul cheese !!!

Afraa is one of my favourite places to eat in Kolkata. I love their Grilled Bhekti with lemon butter sauce. Service and ambiance are excellent. I really like their Sunday brunch menu but the regular lunch buffet leaves much to be desired. Firstly, the breads are not that good. Secondly, there are mostly Indian dishes with very few continental options.

Otherwise, this place is a must visit. Lovely food, ambiance and service. Skip the lunch buffet though.

I went there with my parents yesterday for dinner. This is my maiden visit to this place. I have heard so much about this place that this was in my must visit list. Let's see if they can live upto the expectation.

1. Ambience - I wanted to give full marks to this place when it comes to ambience., what with its beautiful glass window view, white chairs, candles in each table and the best part, the live violin, but the loud music from the lounge area spoiled the peaceful ambience. The violinist is a genius who will make your dining experience a pleasant one

2.Food - We ordered the following , Bekti piccata as starter, their signature nasi goreng, creamy chicken and mushroom sauce pasta and cheesecake with ferrero rocher as dessert. The Bekti piccata was delicious with slight tangy twist to batter fried bekti. The creamy chicken and mushroom pasta is the normal white sauce pasta but the mushroom blended well. The nasi gorng was such a beautiful experience. It is sort of Indonesian mixed fried rice accompanied by two chicken kebab, mixed veg, two type of sauce , poached egg. This is a must have if you visit Afraa. The cheesecake was a bit harder than our expectation but it tasted really good. Extra points for how the food was garnished and presented before us. The complimentary chocolate paan was a sweet surprise

3.Hospitality - Staffs are extremely courteous and knowledgeable. They suggest so well that we ended up ordering all their suggestions and boy that was a wise decision.

I have been here 4 times, and I must say the ambience here is commendable, The cocktails along with the open air seating is all you need to destress at the end of the day. But if you are looking for food and hospitality, then you may get a bit disappointed ... as the preparation here, does not impress you at all, especially the indian dishes are quite bland.

Probably few people would be surprised with this rating....this one is purely based on the food experience...the good things quickly...a very nice and posh place right at the top floor of City Center 1...with indoor and outdoor seating available....great wooden flooring and live violin gets played, i guess they play the music you request...a very spacious place...nice decor like you expect in such places...one of their wall is decorated with bottles....they could have been a little more creative there...fill them with colored water...put some lights etc....the light probably was there, they just didnt lit it and that made the big wall look boring...

Nice wooden contemporary tables....nothing flashy...but a little small for 4 seaters...we could barely place the maincourse plates and not the extra plates...bt they got a small trolley to place them near us and either we help ourselves or they serve us if we need it...

Coming to the food part and where we should spend more time :)) talking....we didnt ordered a lot for 3 people in terms of items but i must say that they serve good portions...1 of my colleague was vegetarian, so we ordered a Veg platter for his starter and then he couldnt order any other variety coz there were lots of options in the platter and almost for 2 person....for the two of us who were meat overs, we ordered Bekti Piccata and Crispy Andhra `Calamari....I didnt tried the veg starter but it looked sumptous and my colleague mentioned that it was good...only at one point when he tried the paneer, it was stale and hard and he told the manager that its not fresh...they changed that item immediatey, no questions asked...i thought that was great service promptness but why to serve old stale paneer at the first place in such a quality place...the Bekti Piccata was really good, small batter fried bekti lightly tossed in some white sauce which they called golden raisin sauce...the sweet chunks of raisins were good but then the sauce could have been made a little hot or spicy to contrast with the sweetness of the raisins...the fried calamari were again batter coated rings of squids deep fried with curry leaves...overfried was the dish...so much so that we could hardy feel the squid...mind you, it was not burnt but just overfried...then we ordered a Afraa's mixed grill platter for 2 of us and boy was that huge...i mean, i think i can eat a lot but i would have strugged to eat that alone...bt as good as it looked in the platter, I was dissapointed with the quality...firsty, they couldnt plate all the items in the platter and got it in two rounds...the plate planning has to be done...grill platters looks the best when everything is nicely stacked...not sure why this is different here...ok now with each items...a huge pork chop which was 60% fat...i mean pork chop will have fat but this was quite a lot, the meat was hard which made me think that it was not marinated enough...bacon was super crispy and tasty...sausages were normal grilled ones and there was a big slice of salami which was not written in the manu...but super dissapointed with the chicken and lamb grills...tough meat....super tough...specially the lamb...it was just nt cooked enough and we got 3 pieces of rubbery meat...we just ate one...i always believe that like every other job, a chef can have a bad day in office too and i will leave it to that...its a dish for 1100 plus taxes and i would expect that to be better than that...

Overall a 3 for food quality not matching my expectations...a place ike that can do much better...i will visit again to see if they actually are worth a 3 or more....btw, a very prompt and friendly service team was always there to assist which is a great feeling

I was privileged enough to have been invited to the Zomato foodie meet up held here at afraa last month.Located in the 7th floor of City centre 1 in salt lake Afraa is one classy place to say the least.The wonderfully decorated crisp interiors along with the tantalizing lighting set us up perfectly for a memorable evening.

We started off the Jacob's Creek Chardonnay and a white wine based cocktail the Spritzer.There's nothing new to say about the soft and classic Jacob's Creek White Wine Chardonnay.The Spritzer was a white wine based cocktail with a dash of gondhoraj lemon and cut pieces of green apple lending more of a fruity taste.The presentation was superb and I felt it was a great drink to start off with.

For food,we started of with a Middle Eastern platter,Mango chili feta on papadams,assorted melon stuffed with bandel cheese and a the pizza afraa.The Middle eastern platter was rather average.The falafel was tad too hard and the pita bread though fresh could have been softer.The Mango Chili feta on papadams was beautifully done.It was tasty and tangy without being one bit overpowering.The melon stuffed with bandel cheese had an infusion of good quality cheese which I liked.The Pizza Afraa had generous amounts of tomato,basil pesto and goat cheese topping but it could do with a little more seasoning.I enjoyed the goat cheese topping but I felt the flavour and taste of the tomatoes overpowered the other more subtle ingredients.

Next came a fresh round of wine and cocktails.The Vodka Grape Crush had a nice kick to it and the hint of basil lend it a refreshing feel - a lovely combination.The Bell pepper mary was bloody mary served up in specially made bell peper mugs.Though the presentation was very attarctive,I am not very fond of the bloody mary.The Green apple and rose margarita and the mango daiquiri were another two cocktails that I tried and enjoyed thoroughly.We also had the sangria which is a red wine based cocktail with freshly cut fruits.The sangria here was one of the better versions I  have had anywhere in kolkata.Overall I was hugely impressed by the cocktails in terms of their taste,presentation and innovativeness. 

To accompany these subsequent round of drinks,we had the vindaloo marinated chicken sticks and crispy chinese tofu both of which went perfectly with our drinks.The Chicken sticks were exceptionally well marinated and they were fried nice and crisp on the outside while the interior was soft and tender.This along with the taratar sauce on the side and not to forget the brilliant cocktails was one hell of a combination.

For main course we started with the Vietnamese pho soup which was a rice noodles based soup with an array of fresh oriental ingredients.The light and intensely flavourful soup was just perfect to cleanse our palates and prepare us for even more.

I had the Tiger prawn and grilled bhetki in mango pickled ginger chili dressing with a side of assorted vegetables.Both the prawn and bhetki were very well cooked and fresh in terms of quality.The dressing was simple yet elegant and it was a treat to our taste buds.The Rosemary and roasted garlic chicken with mushrooms was tasty in itself but the chicken was slightly chewy on the inside.

Finally for desserts,we had a chocolate jalapeno mud cake,orange basil ice cream and mascarpone quenelles with blue berry macaroons.The desserts were all a class apart.I have always been a fan of desserts at afraa and this time also I was not to be disappointed.The Chocolate jalapeno mud cake was simply sinful.The taste and especially the texture was sublime.The orange basil ice cream was once again refreshing and served up in edible chocolate cups.The mascarpone quenelles with blue berry macaroons were also lovely.The macaroons were again one of the better ones I have had anywhere.The mascarpone quenelles balanced the sweetness of the macaroons and contributed for a lovely combination.

Overall the zomato foodie meet up at afraa was an utterly enjoyable experience with good quality food,exceptional innovative drinks,like minded foodie friends and the warm hospitality of the staff at Afraa and team zomato.Team zomato kolkata deserves special mention for the impeccable organisation of such a brilliant meet.Kudos.
Cheers! :)

Good Time at Afraa

Kolkata has slowly been gaining a reputation as a fortress of food innovation. And I don't doubt that for a bit. I have been dining in some of Kolkata’s best-kept secrets for many years now, and I must say it's quite an experience. For those of you searching for a culinary experience like no other, look no further than Afraa 

Located on the 6th & 7th floor of City Centre I, Salt Lake City, Kolkata, we booked this place to host a birthday celebration for my 7 year old daughter. The wood décor was classy & graceful, with display of fine wine bottles, soft illumination gives you a feel of luxury & you can always saunter towards the glass walls for a spectacular view of the city. Since we had a booking of 40 we enjoyed the terrace seating area on exclusive basis . 

We opted for lunch buffet. We started with the Welcome Drinks – Limited to one drink per person. 

You have options of wine (red & white) beer, soft drinks, Soda , juice etc . 

Rest are as follows with my personal feedback :  

Starters: 

Crunchy Fried Fish with Tartar Sauce - Excellent 

Crispy Chili Baby corn – Very Good 

Soup: 

Vegetarian Hot & Sour Soup: (I did not taste, must be good, I was rather enjoying my red wine)

Salads: 

Two Non Veg (Chicken + Egg) & Four Veg Salads with Dips & Condiments (Overall great 

& well presented) 

Main course: 

Mutton Roganjosh – Superb 

Roasted chicken in rosemary sauce – Good 

Ginger fish – Superb

Vegetarian lasagna – Very Good

Dice potato in masseman curry – Interesting 

Paneer butter masala – Very Good

Burnt garlic noodles - Excellent

Lasooni dal tadka - Excellent

Steamed rice -Synced very well with the above mentioned menu 

Assorted Indian breads –Served hot & separately on the table

Dessert:

Oven Baked Rosgolla - Excellent

Monte Carlo - Excellent

Cheese Cake was outstanding; I do not really remember the other one, only that that it tasted equally good. 

The restaurant buzzed with excited energy and was comfortably full with seemingly satisfied patrons. The Service was absolutely fantastic – Prompt, Friendly, Always Available & Somehow Exceptional ( Sobroto  volunteered us in taking quite a few group snapshots & arranged the Birthday Cake  ) 

Special Thanks to Mr Avisek (Sales & Marketing) for all his kind & heartfelt support.

Afraa being on the 6th n 7th floor of City Centre 1, the view was  beautiful and spectacular.. We specifically asked for a glass view seating as soon as we walked in, management was prompt enough to provide one. We opted for buffet. In starters we had fish fry and some veg kebabs.. Fish was juicy inside and crispy outside. What I liked about Afraa's thatthey prepared their buffet menu paying due attention to the unbearable heat and humidity of kolkata.. Salads had watermelon cubes, sautéed greens, fish salad and chicken ceasar salad with light and refreshing dressing. Mains comprised of Mutton stew, chicken afgani, plain rice, dal etc. I had mutton stew, extremely light on spice yet tasted wonderful on palate. Mutton pieces were juicy, tender and came out from bones easily.. Chicken Afghani was another marvel, the gravy was spicy yet light on palate (read stomach), chicken pieces were tender.. Kudos to Afraa for coining such a wonderful summer menu. In desserts, gulab jamun were lovely too. The server attending us was knowledgeable, polite and extremely helpful. After this hearty meal, the fellow was kind enough to point us a beautiful location to take pictures which surely increased our dining experience at Afraa. Will surely visit again, hoping Afraa's ambience will enthrall us at dinner time as well..

Afraa Lounge is definitely a good place to visit for a buffet. The place has a fantastic ambience, which is heightened by the fantastic view you get from the seventh floor. It definitely feels very hi-fi.

Having gone here twice, I can definitely say that the food here is definitely interesting. Some things that really stood out were the Maa Ki Dal and Au Gratin.

It is wheelchair accessible, with a ramp leading up to the lifts to the seventh floor. Inside the restaurant there is no problem moving around on wheelchair.

If I had to describe the Afraa experience in one word, it would be 'classy'. Starting right from the elegant decor, the glass walls with a stunning view of the city, the beautiful outdoor seating arena with couches and low-set tables, jazz playing in the background...everything is near perfection. We ordered buffet and were first served a veg and a non veg starter, both superb along with two cosmopolito cocktails (one was complimentary since it was happy hours..how good is that!). Now I have to admit that was one of the best cocktails I have ever had. Their main course buffet is a fusion of Indian and Chinese cuisines having hakka noodles, stir fried vegetables, chicken, a variety of salads and also choice of rice/nan/roti with mutton, which we washed down with red wine. Not to mention the chefs have managed to prepare each of the dishes excellently. However, they didn't have many choices to pick from in their dessert section, but the few that were there, were delectable enough. The staff was very polite and well-mannered and wait on you hand and foot, tending to your every gastronomic need. To sum up-
Food-4/5
Ambience-5/5
Service-5/5
Value for money-4/5
Expense- reasonable enough.The buffet is 500 plus taxes.
Next visit- anytime soon. Can't wait. :)
Cheers to the team. Keep up the good work.

We booked the place for a office party. The lounge was great. The DJ was courteous enough to reject crass music requests. And the drinks and the hookah were good. Here is the downside. The starter was prepared to kill your taste buds. And the main course, I never knew, as I followed the advise of a good foodie friend and gave it a miss. Good place to hang out with friends, a couple of drinks and so. But the food, I hope to try my luck out again in the coming weeks, and see if I get to increase the ratings.

I went both the restaurant and lounge... Had buffet lunch in the restaurant ..it is good as per the price but I feel some more menu addition could be done avoiding the unnecessary items but they do have quality food and service... Complementary drink is the most attractive inclusion to this meal... Awesome :)

The lounge is quite happening and popular.. They is happy hours till 8 p.m. buy one get one drink ... Coolest place to chill and party

And the much much awaited review
#zomato_foodie_meet_up_2
#celebrating_food_with_wine_finedine_and_foodaholics
The chosen location : afraa , 7th floor

I have been to visit here ever since last year. But unfortunately due to lack of company , I ended up not going. I had heard praises about its romantic ambience. I would like to thank zomato for this fairy tale dinner with a chauffer driven uber ride and then of course an amazing dinner.

The moment I entered I was taken aback by the scene..people chitchatting amidst a long table which was amazingly well laid. With wine glasses, candles and starters on the table. And the backdrop of this was kolkata and the dark blue sky with lights of high rise building glittering like stars. Kaustav, diksha, ishita was ever ready to greet us.

To begin with , the courteous Rohan asked " would the lady prefer white wine?" And I was swept off my feet with the princess treatment.

No sooner did Jacob's Creek Chardonnay appear on the table. I was enjoying my white wine when I was forwarded the menu. It was like huge. Only thing missing was lamb however.
Nonetheless,
The other drinks that I had was:
Sangria : it has to top the list of preference. It was red wine with seasonal fruits and it was amazingly done. I could not resist requesting for more and more of it

Spritzer: it was basically white wine with watermelon and a dash of gandharaj lebu. I somehow did not quite like it , but the presentation in a tea cup with a blue orchid just outshone everything

Vodka Grape crush: another of the remarkable cocktails that is have rejoiced in my lifetime. It was vodka based black grape crush with a hint of basil. The basil was however the show stealer.

Bell pepper Mary: was basically bloody mary served in bell pepper mugs. However I found it too spicy

Apple martini : it was not on the menu but was provided to us. Martini will apple juice with the right kind of mix made the drink a bliss.

Coming to the starters that was provided on the table was:
Afraa Middle Eastern Platter : basically a lebanese delicacy with falafel, shishtouk, etc. However I did feel the falafels were a bit too tad.

Mango chilli feta on papadams: this was the #1 of the starters. The mango created the aroma and palate magic. Heavenly and soulful bliss.

Assorted Melon stuffed with bandel cheese : was a new concept and tasted just fine.

Vindaloo marinated chicken with rocket tartar pizza : was the show stealer again. The generous chunks of chicken and the right amout of cheese made the pizza reach the epitome of amazing taste.

Soup:
Viatnamese PHO: I am sorry to say I did not like the soup at all. Lacked the sheer essence of a thai soup. It was a rice noodle soup and the broth tasted of red chilli vinegar , although the essence of lemon grass as an essential part could not definitely be felt.

Coming to the main course:
Tiger prawn grilled bhetki with mango-pickled green chilli dressing- was out of the world. The dish was amazing. The bhetki was an amazing affair. However I quite detested the concept of baby carrots, instead sauté veggies would have been a better alternative

Rosemary Roasted Garlic Chicken with baked garlic and pan fried mushroom: was another star dish. The chicken was roasted to the right amount and had a rich aroma of garlic. This dish left me with a feeling of ecstacy.

All's well that ends well. The much talked about dessert platter. It was innovative and presumably one of the amazing samplers I have ever tried. It was basically a trio of :
Jalapeño mud cake - which erupted all the taste buds and the taste will be savoured forever.

Orabge basil ice cream mounted on a chocolate base : was amazingly experimental and worth giving a huge hi-fi.

Mascarpone quenelles with blue berry macaroons: oh! How I wished I could go on eating this forever. It was a delicacy the macaroons was the best ones that I had and the quenelles was amazing.

And the good news? I was filled till the neck.

Thank you afraa for the amazing dinner, you all made the night so memorable with good food and amazing wine.

Team zomato thank you for arranging the meet up and making us foodies feel so very special. Good food will always be relished and zomato will always be celebrated. Thanx guys for making life beautiful.
Cheers guys!

This was the third time I was visiting Afraa Restaurant for dinner, the last two visits were couple of years back when I was not at all that keen in sharing my reviews / comments on food or restaurants. But this third visit of mine was bit different from the past two. Here I was invited and it was a Foodie Meetup arranged by Zomato. It was such a wonderful initiative on their part to arrange the second meetup of 2015 at Kolkata. It was an evening of delectable food and finest beverages which were all complimentary. 

The setting was more than perfect and every bit of the ambiance was crafted for an excellent evening ahead with some great people and scrumptious food. We were handed over the menu cards specially prepared for the Foodie Meetup. There were two separate sections in the menu card, one for the food and other for the beverages. Here are the stuffs I ordered for - 

a) Spritzer --- Apart from the welcome drink served on the table, Spritzer is probably the best drink to start off. It is a white wine cocktail with a refreshing touch of lemon. It is served in relatively less quantity but that does the trick to set you up for the evening. 

b) Sangria --- As we know it is a red wine cocktail with chopped fruits in it and a little bit amount of brandy. It was probably the best drink I had that evening, really one star cocktail for sure.

c) Vodka Grape Crush --- It is one nice vodka cocktail with black grapes and a hint of basil in it. Really another must try beverage.

d) Jacob's Creek Shiraz Cabernet wine --- There is not much to say about the velvety classic Shiraz Cabernet. It's one kinda spicy yet smooth wine with vibrant cheeries and a backdrop of cedery oak.

e) Foster beer --- I do always have atleast one beer, maybe its one bad habit but I gotta have one. This place was not an exception and I asked for one Foster, optimally chilled smooth liquid giving the touch I was looking for.

f) Afraa Middle Easter Platter --- Coming to the food, this platter was already there on the table, we didn't have to order for it. I would like to say the falafel in there was tad too dry for me, it could have been much better, so we had already raised this concern with the chef and it should be taken care of. 

g) Mango Chilli feta on papadams --- This was one star item, I'm gonna remember this dish for a long long time. Such a simply yet amazing starter. The mango in there gave the ultimate x-factor to the dish.

h) Assorted melon stuffed with bandel cheese --- Didn't really like this, it was bit dry and hard for me. Could have been bit more moist I guess.

i) Thin crust pizza --- Very average preparation to say the least, but had some lovely presentation. The goat cheese on it was nice though.

j) Chicken sticks with tartar sauce --- Really this dish went very well with the cocktails and beer, it was very well marinated and fried to perfection.

k) Tiger Prawn and grilled bhetki --- The looks of this dish can kill you. Superb presentation to say the least with lovely fresh ingredients used in it. The grilled bhetki gave an explosion of glory in my mouth, so did the tiger prawn. It was grilled to perfection and tasted real good. Must try! The dish came along with crushed baby potatoes, greek salad sticks, stck of asparagus, baby carrots, etc. 

l) Rosemary and Roasted Garlic Chicken --- This grilled chicken dish was nice but the chicken could have been bit softer, it tasted amazing though. It came along with baked garlic and pan-fried mushrooms.

m) Chocolate jalapeno mudcake mascarpone quenelles with orange basil icecream --- This dessert was a combo of four items as the name suggests and came in four separate compartments on a single specially designed plate. We were too full when this was served but still we again started hogging since this dish was another star item! It had the amazing mudcake that went so well with the orange basil icecream, and on top of that it had one of the best macaroons I had tried in a long time. Must try.

There is nothing much to say about the service and staff. They were extremely prompt, very courteous and taking care of our every small need. Much appreciated.

Just before wrapping up, I would like to thank Uber for the smooth rides to and from the restaurant, that too for free! Also I would love to thank the Zomato Kolkata team members who were instrumental in making this meetup possible and definitely Akanksha. Also thanks for the lovely gifts and multiple food coupons. And once again thanks a ton for the amazing meal which was ofcourse complimentary. The food and beverages served at the meetup were really good and I will be back pretty soon for another wonderful meal at this place. Till then, let the lovely memories of this evening stay with me!

Cheers!

One of our (me and my wife) favourite restaurant. Its not because its 5min away from our home but mainly because of the quality of the food they provide. We never felt disappointed with the kind of food they provide and we have tried almost everything in the menu! I also like the amount of oil they use in general (as light as possible) which is very healthy. Try out their various kind of food and cocktail. Strongly recommended. I would also like to mention our favourite guy Subhobrata Das who takes good care and his suggestions we can always depend on!

I had gone to Afraa Restaurant and Lounge a few months back. We had ordered a smoked chicken and bacon pasta, a salmon pasta, chicken risotto and a tiramisu. The food was excellent; the salmon pasta was delicious and the salmon was tender and melted in my mouth! The tiramisu was simply delectable. The other items were very good too; but these two stood out!  As for the ambiance, the decor is lovely and soothing. There was a superb violinist who was playing some melodious tunes and creating a great atmosphere. The waiters were courteous and amiable and the service was pretty prompt. The restaurant is a bit overpriced for a college student like me; but otherwise no complaints! I hope Afraa maintains its quality of food and service and keeps up the good work!

EDIT: I had gone to Afraa for the buffet lunch today. Sadly I am having to review my previous opinion. While the a la carte menu is exclusive and high quality, the buffet fell short of my expectations. We had a tomato basil soup (which was pretty ordinary), a few kinds of salads (only the chicken salad was good), two kinds of starters (which I didn't like). Then the main course had Indian and Chinese options, some of which were decently made and some which I didn't like at all (like Singapore noodles, Murg Afghani and the paneer dish). There was also the English shepherd's pie among the main course items, which I personally felt was quite awful. The dessert options were limited and not particularly great. The mocktails we were served weren't good either. The service, as always, is very hospitable and warm. I would recommend Afraa to improve their quality of the buffet lunch.

The very first thing that attracts one about this place is the beautiful ambience. The food here is equally welcoming, accompanied by great service. They make wonderful pepperoni pizzas and a nice salmon salad. The cheesecake and the copa lolita together make the perfect ending to the great meal.

Well, the food is actually worth the high billing price, which is not very usual for restaurants in Kolkata. 
We had Long Island Teas, Winetinis, Cosmopolitans for drinks which came with a treat of mixed breads, which were exquisite! 
Two mixed meat platters for starters, which were incredibly filling, therefore we only had a thin crust pepperoni pizza after that, which was very well flavoured and nicely baked. 
The dessert were these amazing cheesecakes which I would've gladly eaten quite a few of had I already not been full. 
The ambience is very picturesque although a little noisy. 
The service was excellent! We had everything that was recommended by the staff and it was just amazing. 
I would definitely definitely recommended going there.

The main highlight of the Afraa lounge is it's ambience and the service. However, when it comes to food one needs to be careful. Last time I ordered a pasta in pesto sauce with extra broccoli and no bell peppers and extra sauce. What I got was really dry pasta with extra bell peppers and v.little broccoli.
Yesterday, I thought to give that place another chance so i went there with a friend.
we ordered 2 Pinacoladas and a four seasons pizza.
It was the warmest (temperature wise ;P) drink I ever had and was the yuckiest Pinacolada ever.
This wasn't enough so they served us a completely burnt Pizza. It was evening and the place was dimly lit. I guess they thought  just cuz we can't see the pizza clearly, we might not be too careful about the taste either.

Some of us friends went for a Sunday brunch buffet at Afraa, but on finding the buffet menu not too lucrative and being not in a mood to drink, went with the ala carte menu. We ordered a salmon salad(regular salad with lots of veggies and chunks of salmon and egg served with bread rolls, crisps and tartar sauce), afraa special pork chops(pork chops in a heavenly gravy served with rice, the best of the lot), scottish salmon(a big slice of salmon served with veggies, nice presentation and taste) and finally, though almost full we ordered the sea food risotto(comes with 1 lobster, 1 mussel and laced with fish chunks and squid, this i say could have tasted better as it was too moist and not having that warm sweet risotto feeling). 
One of my friends was intent on drinking so he went for the buffet, pretty ordinary menu with cold cuts, 1 non veg, 1 veg sandwich, salads, eggs etc. In the main course they had a grilled fish(which was the standout, ps- i tasted a few items from my friend), mutton biriyani(good enough) chili chicken(i told them it is a very wrong combination), some veg noodles and other veg dishes like kali daal, paneer, mix veg etc etc. In dessert there were tarts, cheesecakes, cupcakes and a choco molten ice cream of sorts. The main advantage is the booze if you are going for the buffet, they serve JW Red Label, Four Seasons wine and all sorts of vodka and rum cocktails.
Lastly the waiters are very friendly, open to suggestions and will make you feel at home. Only they would not pack the bread rolls along with our left over risotto saying those are house compliments and cannot be packed. Overall a fine dining experience hosted by Afraa.

We went there for a buffet lunch. The ambience, the decor is good and welcoming. They served the starter on table. They have only two options in starter and we are not happy with that. 
Then we went for main course. There was only one rice item. No roti/tandoori or kabab item was there. Paneer was good. Actually all the food was very good at taste but I think they need a little variation. 3-4 items found in desert. 
Not up to the mark.
The service was good enough. We are happy with the service.
Btw, wine was perfect. Cheers. :)

AMBIENCE this is the usp of Afraa Restaurant. A bang on 9/10. Would have rated 10/10 only if the lounge's loud sound didn't spoil the live music and too much vibration felt from downstairs!
Situated on the 7th floor, the restaurant has glass windows through which u can have amazing salt lake city view!
Cozy furnitures with candles lit tables and amazing crockeries.
This place has an amazing decor and thats a visual treat in itself.
I went in with my family, didn't have much idea of the food Afraa specialises in, so approached the waiters and I must mention they were extremely helpful and courteous! With that assisstance we ordered our food and must say they were just yummy. Food was served at ease, so pleasure of eating out was multiplied. They never served hurriedly and the food was served hot. Mocktails were good too and it was again on the waiters advice we ordered some amazing mocktails!

I seriously would have rated it as 5 on 5 only if the restaurant was not disturbed by the lounge on the 6th floor, it was annoying as there was vibrations felt constantly and it hampered the live music!

Recommendation: 1. Non Veg Platter
2. Ceaser Salad

Location: City centre 1, Saltlake

Ambiance: Romantic, warm and exquisite. You can not complain about the ambiance, at all. Lovely Decor and great music make your food journey a memorable one. 

A must visit for the party animals. You get to see an amazing skyline view of Salt lake from open smoking zone!! 4.5/5

Service: Well, Good but nothing great. Nothing special to mention about. A bit slow for a-la-carte order. 3/5

Food: Ahh!! Lip smacking and very satisfying for the taste buds. I really had nothing that I didn't like about their food. Mocktails were refreshing, Starter platter was yummy and main courses were sumptuous, to say the least. At the end, they gave chocolate paan which I find innovative. 4.5/5

Overall, This place is worth your time and really, will give you a much needed gastronomic treat. Though a bit overpriced, still worth it.

We were lucky enough to get the best place in the restaurant for the first time. We loved the ambience at the first sight only. And the hospitality by the staffs deserve a special mention.
The food was delicious and especially the 'dhowadhar' lamb. 
The cocktails were a bit different from the regular cocktails we have in other restaurants. I personally liked the wine based cocktail.
All over, Afraa is a great place to hang out with family or friends for a lovely brunch or a luxurious dinner.

Had written a review  here for this place before and given 4 as my rating but changing it to 1 for a very bad experience...!!!
Visited here today again and had a such a bad experience that I wud never return again... Today during happy hour went there and ordered two drinks... They have  this 1+1 offer during happy hours...!!! So accordingly we should have received another two drinks... So we had placed this order to this guy called Biltu...!!! And then we had finished our two drinks and asked for our two remaining drinks this Biltu guy refused to serve us stating that we had ordered only one and 1+1 offer was already exhausted by the two drinks he had served before... !!! And since it was past 8 he said he is helpless...!!! He was also very adamant that it was not his mistake and it was my problem that he misunderstood... I would suggest the afraa management should impart some basic training to their staff...!!! He should atleast have some basic communication skill so that he can atleast understand the order... Or is it OK for Afraa management for their customers to get CHEATED in this manner???  Hoping for a reply this time.!!

Okay, first of all you really can't complain about the ambiance. The fine dining area overlooks the Salt Lake skyline and its not something anyone can have a problem with. The decor is lovely - cozy, laidback and welcoming. 
The platter? Exquisite. You get great food here. Period. The soup was nice and the starters as well. The noodles were nothing mentionable but definitely not bad. Their fish preparation was lovely, an indicator of good food i guess as most of the time, its the fish that ends up below par at most restaurants. 
Service? Friendly, nice but not particularly peppy. We went for the buffet so it didn't matter anyway. 
Finally? Its worth it. Definitely worth it.

So karma served us good when we decided to leave the restaurant we were sitting at and decided to leave it cuz the menu wasn't offering a lot of dishes. We ended up going to Afraa, and me and my friend were quite looking forward for the food. Upon reaching we found out they had a lunch buffet, and the visual stimuli was good enough excuse to go for the buffet. Had to wait a bit for the starters, but waited patiently thinking that the chef might be making it all exclusive and fresh! Which turned out to be utter disappointment. We were served with *onion rings/fries and *fish amritsari, and NOTHING else. Firstly the choice of starters (lacked imagination), secondly the variety of that and thirdly and most primarily the quality of both the items dashed our hopes for this place to such level that it was already irretrievable! The onion rings were eatable, but the fish amritsari my friend, it was freshly re-fried, totally giving away the freshness of it.
Quite annoyed, decided to go for the main course. Chose *butter garlic fried rice, *chicken cafreal, *mutton kosha, *paneer with corn & spinach for the main course. The only thing I could eat without any complaint was the rice. The chicken cafreal was quite dry and not-so-juicy, the paneer was stale and rubbery, the mutton was a dish where the flavor and quantity of tomatoes dominated over anything, even the mutton which wasn't very nicely cooked. I mean it was tender but not cooked well along with the masala.
The only thing that was ok for the afternoon was the wine! However, when the bill came, I wasn't as furious as I were while I ate. But still the amount of money taken for the lunch buffet could not and should not justify the quality of the food.
However the ambience and the service was good. And the ambience acted as a mirage! I think the bad decision was to go for the buffet and not à la carte!

Definitely one of the best places to dine out in Kolkata. Wonderful view from 7th floor, live music added further value to already superb ambience. Thoroughly enjoyed the food. We were five. The orders were mixed type -  oriental, Indian & continental. Each segment was perfect. But the best part of the experience was service we received.

I had to pass my time for 45 minutes. I was in city centre so I decided to visit the place. I just ordered a sheesha. They provide an open space which makes the evening more beautiful.
If I'm in saltlake and want to go for a date. Afraa lounge would be one of the best place I can select.

Afraa has been my favourite place for the last 4 years, let it be on a date, or a hang out route with my best pals and cousins. It has been one of the very few places with an amazing rooftop set up along with a great view of the Salt Lake city.... It is actually incredible with the set up they have put up especially when you can take your girl out there and want a special evening with her. Also, the hukka adds up to the ambiance, open air roof with some good alcohol and hukka adds up to the occasion. The ambiance is probably one of the best in Kolkata, the food is decent but heavily priced but once in a while visit to the place wont be too taxing to your wallet. A must go, if you are in kolkata... Happy Munchin :)

I visited this place once invited by one of my friends. It was a big team and we spent quality time. I cannot comment on the price as I did not pay. But I liked the ambiance. I loved the food as well and it was of excellent quality and taste. It was buffet menu, not all the dishes I liked equally but as a whole I lived the servings and the service. The most I loved is the boiled chicken salad. I still remember the taste.
I would like to visit this place again of my own and try the dishes of my choice and mood.

Ah! What can I say.the ambience. the food.the sweet violin tunes.the entire saltlake town from your glass window.the dim candlelight on your table.got a date? Give it an afraa treat. Nice food.will highly suggest Kolkata grilled bhetki with your choice of sauce, and rosemary chicken. tira misu in desserts is a must try.It also offers Indian food; though I personally enjoyed the continental more! It is one of the high end restaurants in saltlake and has a good pocket pinch.Service is extremely good and if you're looking for fine dining experience outside a hotel lobby go for afraa.you will not regret!

Went here for a new year party. The entry was 4500 INR. Drinks comprised of Unlimited Beer Pints of Kingfisher, Johnnie Walker Black & Red Label and Ciroc Vodka.
The ambiance was amazing. It is a proper nightclub and the factor of open air seating also makes it look cool.
On a separate floor they had kept buffet open till 3 AM.
The starters at the lounge floor were amazing.
Super party ambiance.

A wonderful restaurant with a few issues:
1. Overpriced.
2. Negative attitude about normal requirements like extra chair, mobile charging points etc which are very ordinary requirements in restaurants of these standards.
3. Authenticity of ingredients is doubtful- we asked them for "bhut jolokia " as per the menu but the waiter tried to convince us by serving with normal green chilies unaware of what bhut jolokia really is.

Its a very good place to hang out with. But this place is costly enough. So if you are in short of cash then this place is not a right one to visit. Cuz nothing is below 200. But still i like this place. Its more of a lounge than a restaurant. I love the music out here and then dark ambiance at night.

What a great place to hang out at. Great is the ambiance and the music and the service. The best feature is the open roof part where one can get a glimpse of the horizon over Salt Lake. Food is quality apart and Afraa has one of its kind Single Malt corner for single malt lovers. No other place has that I must tell you. It's located at the 7th floor of the G block at City Centre 1.

Need to look at the menu before ordering as the prices are at par with any 5 Star place. Well, one gets the similar feeling too. It's one of those places in town one must visit for at least once.

We had a pretty good lunch at Afraa Restaurant and Lounge recently. Elegant decor love the glass bottle wall .

We ordered up  Mahi tikka ajwani.. and Turkish sish kabab. Honestly the highlight was the tenderness of fish ! For me the dressing  certainly fell short of that mandate ! 

Kebab was Ok.I had better kebab.For main course we ordered Roasted and rosmary chicken again chicken was hard to bite upon.Fried rice was good.They gave us complementary bread basket.

We ended with the Cheese Cake which was quite nice and their signature Chocolate Paan and some Red Wine.All in all good restaurant with nice ambience.Staff was a bit lethargic always I had to call them to serve us.

We had a pretty good dinner at Afraa Restaurant and Lounge recently. Elegant decor love the glass bottle wall and good food and service made it a good experience overall. 
We ordered up Smoked Salmon with Dill & Caper Tartare Salad with Gazpacho Dressing. For those who are not in the know a Gazpacho is primarily a tomato and vegetable soup of Spanish origin that is served cold. Honestly the highlight was the perfectly poached egg .... the salmon in terms of quality was good but I have had far better and the Gazpacho was out of place completely the salad tasted better without it ! For me the dressing is meant to bind the salad and here the Gazpacho certainly fell short of that mandate ! 
The Pasta we ordered up was Porcini , Shitake , Honshimeji , Fresh Mushroom ,Basil and Truffle Oil and was very nice , Pasta perfectly done and a well balanced dish.
The star of the evening for me was their Signature Nasi Goering Platter which was spot on. Consisting of a lovely Chicken and Prawn Fried Rice , Chicken Satay , Fried Egg and Prawn Wafer it made for a lovely dinner. This I would certainly go back for. The Sweet Soy Sauce and Chilli Sambal served with it were both excellent and complemented the dish perfectly.
We ended with the Cheese Cake which was quite nice and their signature Chocolate Paan.

One can be an easy fan of the afraa lounge but what they miss is the relaxing and calming afraa restaurant. The North Indian we ordered was exquisite and the place had a strong touch of elegance even in its staff. I would personally recommend anyone not to miss the crispy chilly babycorn. And don't worry the money you spend is easily compensated both by the quantity and quality of the food.

Located on the 7th Floor of Salt Lake City Centre, the view from the restaurant is indeed awesome! The ambience is nothing great and just about ok. I have been here several times and this time on a Saturday afternoon I went with my friends for lunch. 

Everytime I eat here I have always felt that the food is simply great and super tasty. We ordered both veg and non-veg. Mahi Tikka Ajwaini in the starters and in Main Course Tarke wali Dal, Paneer Butter Masala, Handi Murgh Korma with Butter Nan. Trust me....each of them...even the simplest dal tasted so good. I will give a 9/10 to the taste and quality of food here. But the drawback I felt while ordering Main Course Non Veg is that they have just 2 options for  Chicken. I really feel that they should keep more options.

The price is a bit on the higher side and we got a handsome bill everytime we have been there. But I would say it is worth the food you get.

I would certainly keep coming back to this place for the wonderful food and the lovely view outside. It is one of my favourite joints.

I've been to this place multiple times and I love the Asparagus Soup and the Rissoto. Their Bread Basket also have a variety of breads served with Thousand Island dip and the chocolate pan at the end of the meal is the best.!

Went to this place, heard a lot bout it, as I seldom stay in kolkata, wanted to try it out. I'd say, I'm somewhat disappointed at this,being to some amazing lounges in Bangalore, I kinda thought, Kolkata will have some mach for it. Ambience was good, the balcony sitting arrangement is nice but the view is ruined by Metro Construction site, also they should think more to prevent mosquitoes. Drinks were nicely presented, a bit overpriced but that's ok. Coming to food, I'm really disappointed there, ordered a pork dish that taste like chicken, ordered a chicken item that's presented like fish, all confusing. Service is good and friendly. Haven't tried the hukka. Mostly because of the food and view, I'm giving a tad disappointed 3 to this joint.

Afraa....I went there yesterday for dinner with one of my good friends. To review, I want to mention that only one thing and that is ambience. Lights, decorations, tables are well placed with good distance in between tables, 7th floor nostalgic view of Kolkata where you see most green parts of Salt Lake. I just put all points regarding this. Next is food. Too much costly for what they serve. The taste of foods is ok, but not awesome. We choose turkish chicken shish kebab and International grill with Dalat spiced corn fed chicken. Turkish chicken is taste like more sweet and last one does not have any noticeable taste. The boiled cucumber have no taste at all. I suggest for those who want to be there, if you like ambience then you must go there, for food, just avoid it.

Ambience: This place is known for its ambience. Situated at the top floor of a building in the City Center Mall, Afraa provides a beautiful place for a beautiful date. It has both A/C and open air sections. The view is good, the decor is full white and the lighting is a good mix of colours. If you are going there on one of their parties or Ladies' Nights then you will see the entire place getting turned into a disco with really good DJs playing interesting mixes of popular songs. I rate it 4/5.

Food & Drinks: Honestly speaking no idea on food. I have heard their buffet is good and their desserts are delicious but I have never chewed a thing in this place. I have mostly tried the drinks and the hookahs. And as per my experience, all I can say is, if you are targeting the free "special" vodka shots on the Ladies' Nights, then be sure to be disappointed. By "special" they mean adulterated by too much lime juice. You will be forced to buy other drinks. Their cocktails are interesting, tasty and effectful. The bartender can actually make you a drink of your favourite colour! I got a purple one for myself. ;) Hookahs are just fine. I rate it 3.5/5.

Service: Good but nothing great as such. When it's less crowded, the waiters are more easily available. During parties it becomes difficult to place your order. When placed, it takes time but it arrives. Staffs is generally well-behaved. I rate it 3.5/5.

Price: I think it is overpriced, especially the drinks. It's advisable to go there when there is an offer.

Overall, I give it 3.5/5.

We went for my birthday dinner hoping for a good experience of fine, quiet and romantic dinner after fun n frolic in the lounge area. It was worth it. Starting right from the ambience, table spacing, lighting, service, food quality, all seemed to be made perfect for the occasion. We started with drinks with Whisky Sour well made. For starters we ordered potato wedges and believe it - never had a perfectly cooked wedge before. It was delicious. We stuck to vegetarian dishes only and the burning candle only seemed to add more taste to the already tasty food. What could be improved is the waiting area for guests and more feedback collected at the table itself which we see in all other fine dining space. The rating could have been perfect if more thought is given to customer at the table.

This place is the most soothing place I have ever been! You can relax and hang out with your friends! The interior and the overall decor is beautiful. You can go at dusk and enjoy the view and the amazing ambience. You can sit outside especially during the winters sip a drink, have hookah,some food and enjoy the weather!
The prices are on the higher side though,but the happy hours doesn't put a big whole in the pockets if you go before 8.
If you haven't been here,then you still have not had a lounging experience.

Afraa is indeed a rather up-scale restaurant. The food is very good and so is the décor. The staff cannot be faulted, they were professional enough. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the restaurant, however it does lack a certain something to help it stand out. Don't get me wrong, the experience itself is worth multiple visits.

The stand-out dish for me was the Tiramisu. I haven't had a Tiramisu that good in a while. The food is a little pricey but that balances out the natural flavour that the chef manages to bring out. Great Experience!

Thanks for reading, and pardon me for any grammatical mistakes I may have made. :)

Today we had buffet at Afraa. I must say we enjoyed everything very much. The decor and the ambiance are quite impressive. The entire space was naturally lit and it was airy. I have hardly seen any other place so comfortable. They offered wines as a part of the buffet. The starters were of just two kinds. One veg and the other non veg but both of them tasted good. Among the usual spread the salad section deserves special mention  grilled fish salad being  the best item.  Dessert was  good but could definitely be improved. Although the "misti doi Brulee " was  delectable. I would love to have few pieces of fruits along with my ice creme.

This place is known for the ambiance and romantic spot that to the day was 14th Feb so the place was perfect for an evening date.Now apart from the normal decor, they had arranged violin player which was really awesome . Full marks on the arrangement.

then they served wine which was not that good but you can't even expect more as it was complementary but the drinks we had ordered that was nice. 

Buffet spread was not that much compared to other restaurants in salt lake with the same price range, so you did expect that the food quality will be great, but yeah i was disappointed really.

starters were really good with different kind of salads, baby corn, etc. but when you get into the main course, you are highly disappointed, neither much options nor the food taste was up to the mark , i felt like i should have gone for A la carte. It's not that i am not fond of continental food, actually they had tried to mix continental and Indian food items so that the customers would chose from their preference but i have to say, it's a failed strategy as to accumulate both cuisines , they were not giving justice to single cuisine, the food items were less and you would be expecting more as the price is high. And the desert was above average.

So, obviously the whole experience was good for the behavior, service, location and decor but food taste and the experiment was not quite good that day.

I am sure this place would be great if they stick on their a la carte,,, buffet spread with that price is not helping anyone ...

Long time back I visited Afraa to try out their Sunday brunch.. It is located in one of the blocks of City centre mall in salt lake and is on the 7th floor. The ambience is just awesome. You can see the city from there and it looks beautiful. I have not tried their a la carte so cant comment on it but the Sunday brunch stole my heart totally. The variety was good but my picks would be the salads, outstanding desserts and the woodfire pizza that was served on the table. I did not like the sparkling wine that was complimentary with the brunch. Service was really good. Prices are steep but worth a visit.

Very good food combined with very good views. I even like the open air waiting area with views of the open area of the mall and the main road. Lovely place to chill out with friends :) On food, Vietnamese  PHO  and the slow roasted tomato + orange soup is great to start with. And then I love the meat grills, especially the salmon and the pork chops. Pizzas are worth mentioning too. Service was friendly and brisk, though the servers seemed to know little about the menu. The lounge downstairs is filled with about- 20 crowd, (some look even younger), so I prefer to skip. Take your call on that. But again, if you get the outside section there, worth a visit too :)

I am giving this place an average rating of 4.0 because I've been here quite a few times and this is like a general review about all of those experiences. 
I do like this place a lot. The dining area seems very comforting, somewhere you could sit for long and talk while enjoying a good, lavish meal. The buffet spread has always been great, consistent to the T every time I have visited.
I have been to their lounge a few times too and have to say this, their hookah is the best in town - flavourful and smooth.

If you visit the place during happy hours, it will be a total value for money.

Ambiance happens to be their USP and rightly so, but only seconded by their food.

Afraa is always a pleasure to dine in as the ambience , the food and the service is exquisite . I had visited the place last month with a friend and we were lucky to have happy hours on for the cocktails . They have some excellent in house cocktails and I suggest you order these ... As they are unique .
The good selection is always difficult due to the variety in the menu and the portions are sizeable enough to be shared by two people . 
I always would recommend this place to my friends and one should go with the sea food or the lobster Thermidor as it's heavenly .
A great place to relax and enjoy a great meal .

Afraa Lounge, City Center..... Visited by me for an invitation. Situated at top floor of City Center 1 offering a picturesque view of Salt Lake. The large windows overlook breath taking view of the city and trust me, what ever you ear and drink, tastes good. The food we offered and the drink we had made us feel good and have an ever lasting effect on us. Would love to revisit Afraa
Ambience- 5/5.

We had noodles, grills and soups, each of which was excellent, and to perfection.. I remember though, a fish preparation was not quite as good as the rest.. The deserts, were, on the other hand, sumptuous.. Their cakes, pastries, all of them are mouth watering and we even took some for home, not being to resist ourselves.. Would lime to visit once more in the future..

The best pork chops I've ever had, the fusion of barbecue sauce and tomato purée which adds enough sweetness, tangy-ness and sourness makes it different from pork chops of other grills... That, coupled with a toasty red wine and their wonderful bread rolls goes best together, for a pocket pinch of 1500 bucks per head, this restaurant is perfect for people looking for occasional  high dining..

The restaurant has a fabulous setting, the service is classy and the food is delectable. Its a place to make an impression if you're hosting someone. However beware, they will burn a hole in your pocket by overcharging on alcohol. They will charge you 27% sales tax over and above their inflated prices of alcohol and this is in addition to ST and VAT. I have not seen any other restaurant in Kolkata do the same. On questioning them, they fished out some circular which states that sales tax is applicable again on resale of alcohol in WB. Sales tax is usually included in MRP at first sale. They charge 4 to 5 times that MRP on their menu and then charge you a 27 % on that. So a peg of whisky retailing at Rs. 60 MRP , sold at Rs. 400/500 will cost you a whopping Rs. 500+/600+ almost 10 times. 
Moreover their food portions are average sized. I recently got robbed on hosting 15 of my friends.

Went to afraa with my friends for partying and had a horrible experience. We started off with flame shot(i dont remember what was it called, bartender special i think). Instead of giving it in shot glasses the bartender gave it in wine glasses and he was pouring the drinks into our mouth. It was perfect for a friend almost okay for myself but he burnt my other two friends while pouring the drink. It was absolutely horrible. One of them got a blister on her lips. Just if you are wondering, none of us were amateur drinkers! I have never come across such an unprofessional bartender till date. We had hookah and tequila shots as well. The hookah was good, very well prepared.
It could have been the perfect place for hangout because of the lovely ambience but that incident left us with a bitter-aftertaste and none of us plan to go there anytime soon.

I went to Afraa for a team lunch, we had the non-veg lunch buffet. The food wasn't up to the mark. The salads were good. There were 2 starters, one veg one nonveg, both were very bad. The main course was mediocre. All in all i was not satisfied with the food for the money we paid.  My team members also had the same view and mine.

Pleasant view and good food. Ambiance is good and seating arrangement is great.
We went to Afraa restaurant for a Buffet lunch (groupon coupon). The starters were limited , but they were of good quality. There was good variety in salads , fish was tasty and deserts were good too . I loved the pastry. 
They only serve foster beer for coupon lunch which is complementary , for other drinks you need to pay extra. There were few decent Chinese food items too.
If you want to relax in a pleasant ambiance with some friends and nice view with few light food items and drinks. This is the place to go.
Definitely worth checking out.

other than that evrything is ok 
food : its better u dont 
drinks: good collection reasonable price
hookah : most exciting part make u own hookahs with soft drinks beer or hard drinks bases and add flavour with ur own creativity , u wont regret it 

but if u want food go to the dining section which is separate and serves really good italian

I went to afraa to give my birthday treat.we secured some coupons from group on and got a hefty discount.
The ambience is very continental and would be ideal for a date.
The food though was not what i particularly liked. We were served some chicken tarts and tandoori aloo for starters(which were infact the only starters on the menu).
The main course was more Chinese and Indian rather than continental,which was very bland...i don't know why...
The mutton was the only dish that tasted good,but to my disappointment there was a streak of hair,which completely ruined my appetite.
The staff was very cooperative though and changed the plate quickly.
What annoyed me the most was they told me that the deserts have finished and they couldn't provide us with any proper sweets...when we questioned the manager about this he gave a lame excuse that they close the lunch buffet within 3 p.m. thus couldn't supply us with proper deserts(in the meanwhile customers came pouring in even after 3 p.m.)
Not a very pleasant experience for me...

Located in city center saltlake, this is the best disc/pub place in area..with an amazing ambience and its pretty huge as well,the best part is that during winters you can go out and chill in the open section of afraa...The food is also nice be it the platters or the pizzas pasta babycorn and i can go on in the foodlist because all of their items are nice...drinks served is also well steered..service is on a slower side and the hookah is also not upto the mark...which reduces the rating of this place...music is nice and feet tapping...
I love this place when you want to go to saltlake side to chill with your friends give this place a definite thinking.

I went there on 4th October 2015 (Dashami).. Menu on Buffet was most ordinary so i went for ala-carte ,ordered chowder soup, ceaser salad and a Sicilian pizza.. Other things were good but pizza was average as compared to its price bcoz toppings were very less.. moreover they said blue cheese is bit smelly so i asked them to replace it with Gouda and i also requested  to put some chicken instead of squids.. They did put some bar-b -q chicken, few pieces of fish(smelling) and Simple mozzarella.. No gouda or blue cheese in it. I couldn't even find a piece of prawn.. Though it didn't tasted dat bad but not worth paying such price for this pizza..

26th April 2015 I went there once again for Lunch with my Mother.. This time Buffet menu was Good though I choose  Ala carte ..  This time  I've Ordered 
 1. Vietnamese PHO with Prawn [ 1.5/5 ] -  Soup was horrible , it was just tasted like a bowl boil  water with a sprinkle of Rice Noodles n small chuncks of Prawn in it .. When i complained about its flat taste,the staff serving was very nice, he said the can change it to Prawn chowder .. I agreed.. But prawn chowder was also not up to the mark.. But better than earlier at least we could eat.. As I Have tried Chowder Over there earlier ( It was perfect that time) I understood that they have just added some flavour on our PHO soup instead of throwing it away..       
             
 2.  Bhetki Picata [ 5/5 ] - Perfect starter .. 5 pc of Soft ,succulent fish inside a Crispy thing Coating.. Raisin sauce n the Salad served with it perfectly compliments each other... Quantity is Good would have been better if served Six pcs at least ..

 3. The ultimate BBQ chicken Pizza [ 4/5 ] - Pizza was really good, Perfect crispy thin crust Pizza.. the staff said earlier that they don't put Pineapple in the topping as it gets soggy,doesn't go well in the pizza so we asked for Black Olive instead.. I would have  rated it 5 if the amount of topping would have been generous.. 

Taste n Quality of food is perfect in Afraa but I'll request the management to consider the the Quantity sply in case of Toppings..

A place I would love to go back again and again for  the sheer variety of salads and main courses served in their buffet line-up . They keep their starters deliciously simple with a veg and a non veg item so that you can gorge on their fresh and invigorating spread of salads guilt free. This is also a place I love because of its innovative main courses; one mutton stew with root vegetables was plucked out of any foodie' s heaven. Coming to the dessert platter , their best offering to me till date was their Monte Carlo and chocolate pastry. I usually add a spoonful of mango chutney to my dessert plate for a bit of sharpness. The best thing about Afraa is the beautiful blend of quality, taste and flavor which they offer in their food, so much so that even a simple dry cake melts in your mouth and takes you to heaven. Full marks to this place for their food and ambience. I can't wait to go back again

We cousin's decided to go and chill in Afraa. It was suggested by their friends since I don't stay I'm kolkata don't know much places. However, the entrance is through a mall in salt lake. We orders hookah and some chicken starters as well as grilled fish. Along with that we ordered cocktails I actually told them what I want in in our cocktails and they did it perfectly. Pizza was also nice best part is the view from the top. I recommend to sit outside and since it was a weekday there were hardly people around. I am guessing weekends will be crowded. Ambience is good but the car parking place is little deserted doesn't look very safe at really late. Cost is on the higher side but for the ambience it's worth.

Perfect place for a romantic date.. All the staffs are really helpful and have knowledge about what they are serving on the menu which is very important.. 

We ordered:
Appetizer - Afraa's mixed meat grill platter ( enough for two people to share)..
Main course - 1) Braised lamb shanks, saffron potatoes, mushrooms, shallots and parsley gremolata;
2) Afraa's special pork chops on warm bacon and cabbage salad, grilled apple and celery, Robert sauce..

The thing I liked the most about afraa was the ambience. We had taken the buffet. There were very few choice available and I didnt like any salad but one. The hot starter too wasn't great. for mocktails I had blue lagoon and fresh lime. Blue lagoon tasted like medicine! The main course was no good either. The chowmein was fine and there were just two sides out of which one was too sweet.
The biggest surprise in store was that when we were about to have deserts, the only thing I thought would save my day, only three of the desert were left. The chocolate tart and the brownie were finished. We asked them to bring the deserts and they brought gulab jamun. We waited for some time but to no use and then we finally walked away.
Overall, I had a bad lunch and the only thing I liked was the ambience.
However, going by the other reviews and ratings, I think I was having a bad day.

Went here after a long time and like before the food met the expectations. I have always been a fan of this place - loved their decor, the ambience and the location, all this add to ones expectations and till date they have always scored.

Started with the " afraa mixed meat platter", which is a must have for all meat lovers. The main course included pepperoni pizza ( best original pizza as per me) and smoked chicken and bacon pasta in red sauce. Finishing off with chocolate jalapeños (interesting flavours) and tira misu in expresso for deserts.

The portions were generous and we four friends were adequately stuffed, not to mention the fresh bread basket and chocolate pan (yummm). Being a dry day we didn't get to order any alcohol,  but then again it gives me more reason to come back the next time and sip on the array of wine choices they have. 

Be it a romantic date or family dinner Afraa fits the bill in all aspects.

Have been here many times for different events... sometimes for dinner while sometimes for Sunday drinks in the afternoon... i have to say that this place has never let me down in terms of food and the alcohol they serve... if there is an offer they hold their end to the Letter and dont try to cheat you out...

other than that the ambiance of the place is fantastic and the people there are good enough though they do at times lack the knowledge which they should have... service is a little slow but then its alltogether great to spend a good amount of time in a place...

the place is a little expensive for the food and the alcohol and sometimes you will feel you paying 5 star rates which is justified...

the portions of food in this place is a whole other thing as they are pretty small but the taste is spot on... 

this place is a frequent visit place of mine for the ambiance and the experience they offer...

Afraa is one of the best restaurants I have been to in Kolkata. There is absolutely nothing you can complain about, be it the decor, the lighting, the food or the service. Even if you have to wait to get a table, you can do so on a beautiful balcony which gives a view of the entire City Centre mall, a beauty in itself. The tables have just the right separation in terms of distance, so that you are not at all distracted by any other group sitting around you. The menu boasts of the best dishes worldwide you could think of, and you are spoilt for choice when it comes to ordering. Among the ones I remember even after a couple of years are the lasagna and the pasta, which were not only perfectly made but had a magical quality about them which made an indelible impression on our minds and hearts. The only disadvantage is that at certain tables, the noise from the lounge below is too loud, which prevents people from making easy conversation, even though most families and groups at a fine dining restaurant like this would definitely go there for excellent conversation over food and wine.

Went Afraa for lunch buffet with friends to celebrate friendship day. Location is CC1, G Block, 7th floor which is one of best located restaurants in the city. View is amazing from lounge area. Ambiance is very elegant and classy too. Servers are courteous.

But these are additional factors when coming to review as the main focus will be on food. 

Buffet comes with option for 1 serving of soft drinks/wine/beer. Veg and non-veg starters along with tandoori roti or naan will be served hot on the table along with drinks.

Starters are average as we found both chicken and paneer starters were not cooked properly.

Many varieties of salads were there which is overkill just to increase count of dishes. In the main course special mention for Sorshe Machh while others were pretty average. Worst was the mutton very though and chewy. Desserts are good but again nothing to remember. 

In total the dish selection for the buffet is very mediocre and nothing unique about it. Saw many rave reviews but looks like a hype to me. Buffet price was INR 597 net and for Sector V corporate another 15% discount.

Will recommend for location, view, ambiance and special occasions while advice will be to avoid weekday buffet. Be prepared for sky rocketing price of ala carte dishes. This is another such example where the food quality for buffet and ala carte varies like hell and heaven.

Afraa the place to be as its trending all over zomato, well after so much of reviews and mouth publicity the wait came to an end yesterday on friendship day  after week long planning. Went their with my besties as decided for a Sunday brunch. located in the over populated city centre 1 (the place is too full specially on weekends) on the seventh floor
 The place is pretty suave and the white environment is  soothing so quite eye pleasing . There was buffet option but than we went for a la-carte coz we wanted to eat less & healthy and more over we wanted to have continental food so we stick to our craving for continental ha ha as per the food we ordered for smoked salmon salad, poached chicken breast, grilled chicken in mushroom & oyster sauce which was a total yum and more then filling & steamed kolkata bekti. I loved the assortments they served in the beginning with a tangy yummy dip love the shapes of the bread assortments and also not to forget I ordered for a fresh lime soda and got another free it was really nice, okay back to the food part it was delicious and tasty and definitely up to expectations. oh yes we also got a complimentary dessert from the staff who was serving us Mishti doi & fruit cake that was really sweet n nice of them.
The staffs are really courteous and good and the place definitely worth what we paid for price is also affordable not over priced.
love to visit here again of course to try out the lounge which was on the 6th floor and looks quite classy . Also to note the restaurant had a rooftop lounge on the seventh floor said to be a waiting lounge which was more of a chill out lounge wish food was served there as it gives a lovely view of the city. overall had a great day friendship day cherished.

Finally today that is Friendship Day my never ending wait and desire of visiting afraa comes to an end. Dropped in with my gal pals for a day out. Located on the 7th floor i have been hearing alot about this place and zomato too is flooded with rave reviews. So i had to see and experience it for myself.

Ambiance of the lounge is far better than the restaurant which was located on top of the lounge. It had an open terrace but food was not being served there. When we enquired we were told that is the waiting lounge. Found it weird because noone was really going there and waiting for a table. People just went there to chill out, have a smoke and enjoy the view from the top and we no different(wink). Ofcourse the outdoor for the restro was smaller compared to the outdoor attached to the lounge below. 
Therefore, anyday the lounge is a far better option as they have shisha too. 

Their buffet spread seemed interesting and well laid out but we opted for the a-la-carte and  ordered the smoked salmon salad, the poached chicken breast , steamed kolkata bekti. The quantity and quality both were really good. I was craving continental for a while now and this place really lived up to my expectations. I want to specially bring to notice the smoked salmon salad which was just wow and i can go there again just to have this dish. They also served a platter of assortments with this mustard tangy dipping which too were nice for a change.

The service was good too and we also got a little complimentary dessert - mishti doi and fruit cake and both were yum.Over all i had a wonderful day with wonderful food and company. Cheers!!

UPDATE: Revisited on 25th april 2015.
Dropped by afraa for a casual dinner with my man. Had ordered their Cosmopolitan and the Classic LIIT. The LIIT was super strong. Anyone can get drunk with one glass. Cosmo was nice and the usual taste. 

Now coming to food we went for the non veg platter which had chicken, fish.mutton and prawn. Everything was very well cooked. The fish most importantly did not have any stench as such. So it was a delight.

Nest we went for butter naan and dhuen ka gosht korma. I particularly ordered this as it was described to have a smoky flavour which i personally love and even the waiter suggested we try it. Indeed the item was very tasty but unfortunately the mutton was not at all cooked and therefore  was chewy and disappointing. We actually had to waste it. However if the it was well cooked then it would have been one hell of a good dish as the gravy was finger licking good.

The manager was kind enough not not bill us for the mutton as he saw us waste it and he insisted upon it because afraa is an expensive restaurant, which was very sweet.  I am hopeful they will not repeat this mistake again.

Very bad and uncomfortable seating arrangement. Rather I would say it is the worst in entire Kolkata. As you can't seat comfortably in the sofa. If you want to use the backrest of the sofa, then your feet will have to be at least 12 inches above form the ground (it doesn't matter whether you are taller than average Indian population).
Abnormally high priced food and drinks. Yes I will say probably it is costlier than any 5 star hotel. For Example they charge INR 1,187 for one 60 ml peg Vodka. On the other hand in snacks they give practically nothing to eat, although they will cut your knees (and not your throat) while billing. I will recommend if you can afford, better go to any 5 star hotel. Probably you will pay lesser amount over there for your food and drinks.
I don't think no will love to see the under construction metro rail station form their balcony (which is a bonus from their side). 

Probably I will never go to this place in my life time and will never recommend anyone to go there.

It's expensive only till you realise how much quantity of food they serve per dish. The first time I was here, there were three of us hungry guys. We went nuts and ordered a Non Veg Platter, Fish n Chips, Nasigoren, Lobster Thermidor. And each dish had American sized serving portions. The platter alone was enough for three. But we pigged out that day. The food was very very good and The service too. The lobster still remains in memory because of the succulent and delicate meat.  Overall we had 5k worth of food that would have fed twice as many people. But the food was SO good it was worth falling sick after. 
The second time I was with family so we ordered in proper quantity. My dad even ordered a 500 bucks salad and it was  surprisingly tasty. The rest of the food like the Pork Ribs and Chicken noodles were delectable as usual. 
The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is because if you're sitting in the restaurant on a weekend night then you can't even hear yourself speak from the loud noise from their pub below.

Tonight was a big disappointment for us at Afraa!! I used to be a frequent visitor before thanks to the awesom ambience and the open air view.. However i feel offlate the services have really deteriorated and so is the attitude of the bartenders.. Moreover I think they should remove the so called ladies night!

What to say about this Salt Lake lounge. Have been to this a number of times. Its one of the most classiest lounge to party or chill with friends. The decor out here is simply yet classy & spacious too. Taking Hookah on the open balcony space after sunset is a pleasure.  Food tastes really good. Staff are courteous.  Pricing is pretty decent.

It should be a must visit !!

A fantastic view is available from the glass enclosed room, and the buffet had a selection for every adult.the accompanying Naan bread was a highlight. 

The kids' options were limited, especially in the beverages dept. We don't give our kids cold drinks (like Coke and Sprite), and feel that if the restaurant does want to cater for the range of visitors (including family), it should at least have milk shake options.

The staff were friendly.

This weekend was my first night out at the Afraa lounge. The place has a real good decor( I liked the terrace section the most and the bar, of course), and the staff is really nice-very courteous. The music is well a little haphazard but who cares after a few shots. What I didn't really like was that the place was pretty much full because of which, we really couldn't really enjoy the casual lounging part. We had to keep dancing and it turned out to be not that bad. There was a little problem with the goofed up bill in the end but as I said the people were very courteous, we winded up good. Over all, I would call it a good party place but I have seen better here itself in Kolkata, keeping also the high expenditure in account.

I visited This restaurant with my girlfriend..
The atmosphere of this restaurant is quite good.. They offered us a good seat with a great outdoor view.. We ordered bear & cactus blossoms as drink. They served my bear within HAPPY HOURS ( when I asked the waiter about the happy hours,, he told me that, as I ordered my beer within 8.00 pm,, so I will get another beer for free,, )
And also we ordered PASTA with white sauce & White gravy mixed chowmin.. After finishing 1st beer when asked them for the next (as they told about HAPPY HOURS) ,, they totally deny it & behaved without any manner.. HAPPY HOUR makes my day UNHAPPY.. When I am spending a good amount of money,, then definitely I will expect a good quality food . Pasta was too salty. Chowmin was average.. The price was too much according to their mannerless behavior & horrible food..
I am not gonna go there in future further..
TIPS FOR STAFF & MANAGEMENT : don't treat ur customers like begger.. Promise should be a Promise.. And train ur waiters & other staff with MANNER & GOOD BEHAVIOR...

[Sunday Brunch Special]

Location: 7th Floor, Block 'G', City Centre 1.

Afraa Restaurant & Lounge being situated at the 7th Floor has a great view in its kitty to encapsulate its customers in its charm and great service. The view in the forthcoming years would surely add as a plus for the place which still boasts of having a perfect setup to boost its customer's unwinding process.
Marking the date, June 7, 2015 was a day on which a great brunch along with the fellow foodies took place. All thanks to the warm hospitality of the Afraa Management. On entering, we were shown our seats which were at the private dining section (on request).

About the BRUNCH, the fare was widespread ranging from the European to the Asian and North Indian Cuisine.
Our brunch, being an invitation from the Afraa management was paired along with drinks on the house on the request of our fellow foodie,

I usually go there because of the wonderful classy ambiance-the windy open rooftop, the sophisticated decor, great music keeps me go back to this place again and again in spite of it being expensive. I usually go there for the amazing hookah and lovely drinks. One will really fall in love with the rooftop if the weather is good. An ideal place to chill with friends. Although its a little pocket pinching but the place gets all the attention because of the service and the ambience

Visited after quite some time. My previous experience was not so great. But this time it was great.

The ambience was better and the service quality has improved dramatically. Servers had a decent idea about the food and tried to provide right suggestion without being prescriptive.

We had salmon salad, sauté chicken, steamed bekti and thai green curry. Well cooked but not over cooked. The chicken was little too spicy and hot which may not be liked by all.

Appearance for all the stuff was pleasant. I liked the simplicity. 

The best was the steamed bekti. To my mind this is one of the most difficult dish as it may turn very bland if not cooked with right proportion of ingredients. It was perfect blend of herbs, soy sauce and ginger.

Time taken to serve the foods were ok and they maintained what was promised during taking the order. 

Need to come back once again to try the other exotic items.

Visited again for lunch. The breadbasket with the dip is very tasty. Maybe even serving butter wth it wuld be nice. We ordered the grilled chicken and grilled fish in lemon butter sauce. Both the dishes were excellent. Just loved the food.

Afraa Deli - A disc cum bar cum hookah Bar cum Place for Group Parties!
=======================================
Intro:

Afraa Deli is one of the most famous spot for the hookah lovers who reside in and near about Salt Lake. It comes under the posh place and has an open terrace where you can chill and relax by puffing sheesha. I had visited this place with my brother and another friend at around 11 p.m.

I had been hearing about the view from the terrace but sadly, i couldn't see as it had been totally dimmed out. Nevertheless, it was very busy at 11 p.m. and somehow we struggled to get a seat in the open terrace after about 15 minutes.
=======================================
Hookah and Food Ordered:

This place is quite expensive when it comes to food and hookah. However, one cannot complain as they do have a classic ambience too.

1) Brain Freezer Rasna - This sheesha as usual always is good. The staffs are too slow with the service and lacks the excellent hospitality which a place like Afraa Deli should possess.

2) Veg Kebab Platter - It had an excellent presentation. It comprised of Peshawari Paneer Tikka, Tandoor Glazed Three Spiced Baby potatoes, Assorted Mushrooms, Vadis and Griddle Cooked Dahi Ke Kebab flavoured with Fig and Sundried Tomatoes. The paneer tikka was hot,soft and tender. It melted in the mouth. The tandoori baby potatoes were ok. I am not much a big fan of mushroom so didn't taste it at that time. Vadis were quite okay. Dahi ke kebab was awesome. This dish costed 705 which is quite expensive for me.

The veg Kebab platter was not value for money to me.
=======================================
Pros:
1) Amazing ambience.
2) Amazing music.
3) Amazing location.
4) Good seating capacity.

Cons:
1) Costly. Way too much.
2) Hospitality requires to be improved.
3) Service isn't prompt.
=======================================
Summary:

Food presentation 4.5/5
Food quality 4.5/5
Taste 3.5/5
Value for money 3/5
Hospitality 3/5
Hygiene 4/5
Ambience 4/5
=======================================
Conclusion:

I would visit this place ONLY if i go out in a big group because its not at all an affordable place for students. I am a kind of person who would love to pay for hospitality and food and not ambience. Nevertheless, a good place to celebrate birthday parties or any kinds of events. :)

I'm not sure if one could give a ZERO or Negative rating, because I want to do that to this place. I had lunch yesterday with three friends, ( a buffet) .   During the buffet, on the buffet table row.. I guess you're supposed to put the tablespoon exactly as it were in the last position....probably  there was an angle of 10 degree difference from previous position...The waiter hurriedly came , made an annoying sound  from his mouth and placed that spoon in a position he thought it was right, when I was still standing there.

A few waiters here are downright rude and devoid of minimum manners. You get better treatment in street side food vendors, not to mention other restaurants in this city.

There were starters (like kebabs) included in the buffet , for which you have to ask (there was a small board at buffet "ask for starters') . We did but there was no response.

We didn't find the food anything above ordinary. The salads were good though. 

I won't waste money here.

Afraa is a good restaurant with nice interiors and well behaved staff. I visited this place yesterday afternoon and opted for the buffet. The spread wasn't elaborate but the food they served was good. The railway mutton, paneer lawabdar and the grilled bekti were superb. The chicken dish disappointed me. The dessert section had Mishti Doi, a cake and 3 cream desserts. The desserts were really good. The buffet also offered a complementary drink. Red wine, white wine, beer and soft drinks were the options.
Overall, a good restaurant with great ambience. And yes, the buffet was for 597. Thumbs up.

A very good restaurant. Probably the best at City Centre 1. You have to try the brownies. One of the best I had in the city. Atmosphere is good too and given its location in Salt Lake, the crowds they draw are very sophisticated and soft spoken, minding their own business. Hence it is an overall good experience at Afraa.

Went for an evening drink to give me a much needed respite form Kolkata heat but ended up in the open air terrace section. The breeze and view reminded my of the high rise bars in big cities. Lovely food, afraaa pizza was brilliant.

The starter of the veg platter was like the lull before the storm. After we munched them blissfully, accompanied by the drinks which felt like a cool breeze blowing across our faces, came the main course. The storm. The perfect pasta which stealthily melted in our mouhts leaving only the flavours to savour. 
The best part? Can't decide. The entire evening! 
The check was followed by a surprise mouth-freshener. A paan coated in chocolate, which was Diwali in your mouth. Enough said, eh?

Spent my anniversary night there. One big flaw first I would like to note here. The noise from the disc disturbs a lot in the family dining zone. I saw a person playing violin - but hardly could hear as the loud noise from disc was disturbing.

Apart from that - good food and good ambience. :-)

Starters: 2 of the starters, one veg and 1 chicken kebab. Average.
Main course: Most of the items were chinese and tasted "yuck"..!! But, The bhuna mutton was really really good and the only reason I am rating them 3/5. This is something worth tasting.
Desert: just above average.

One thing i love the most about this afraa is its marvellous view. Of course every restro offers you one and a less but almost the same things..but their usp is their view. It has got some splendid view from the restro where you and sit back and relax. Food, drinks, ambience, service...am not wasting time mentioning each n everything..because everything gets full marks.. But so far my favourite restro in kolkata for its view. Yes your opinion can be different of mine...but i personally prefer some place where you can sit back n relax and have some good time. From that view..am rating it my best restro in kolkata

Love the ambience at afraa. Outdoor seating with breeze blowing away. Heavenly feeing. A good place to chill out with your best buddies. 
Service speed is decent and food quality is to notch. The pizza we ordered was good enough.
Happy hours (buy 1 get 1 free) ends at 8pm sharppppp. We ordered something at 7:59pm ist which they didn't accept as a happy hour order because their clock showed 8:05. (Strange but true)
However the waiters are not particularly careful to attending customers in the outdoor seating. You've got to wait for them to take your orders. This is one thing which I disliked.
Go there on a match day. Chill with friends. Dance away. Good place to be in.

Today again visited afraa.Two days back to back and in two different   locations,different experiences.
This was the restaurant version not the cafe one.When I entered the place was looking so beautiful.As I was with my friend they gave us a table with a great view.Also lit up a candle.We orderd bear, cactus blossum cocktail,Pasta and noodles.They served the drinks first between 7:45pm-7:50pm. There was a happy hour advert so my friend asked weather we are going to get another drink free or not as we orderd within the happy hour time.The waiter simply said sure as you orderd before 8 then my friend asked another waiter about that he denied that and also stated talking rudely.Very bad situation created by thair own mistake.
The food was very cheap salty,seriously after speanding that amount of money we did't expect this kind of food and behaviour.
The service was quite quick but food was not good.
Tips for Afraa-Please mention the TRC's very clearly next to happy hour advert otherwise you will end up losing customers like me.
Bye bye Afraa never coming back....

I visited the restaurant with colleagues from US and a buffet was arranged for us. The food was awesome. The best part was when the US team started enjoying "GOLGAPPAS/FUCHKAS" that were offered as starters and they couldn't get enough of it. We also had "mutton papri chat" which was one of its kind and an instant hit with all.
One dish that deserves a special mention is "CHEESE BALLS IN THAI SAUCE". A veg dish which many of us may not enjoy, but those missing out the taste of it will be really really sad. A fantastic dish that burst into different flavors in your mouth and you just can't stop having it.
So if money is not a concern you should definitely go to this place.

Great and meticulous food! That sums up this restaurant.

Was visiting Cal over the weekend and decided to take my cousin and his family out for lunch in a nearby restaurant within Salt Lake and he promptly chose this place, located in the mall, pretty close to where he lives. 

Was a Sunday and they had a buffet and that seemed the easiest way to go, since we wanted to make it a quick affair. So we asked for the rates and were informed that since this was a buffet with unlimited drinks, they were charging 900 odd something per head. Steep and for an afternoon, when I would hardly indulge in more than two drinks, if at all. So we said that we would like just the buffet without the drinks and buy whatever drinks we wanted to. This is quite normal with many restaurants that I am used to, but this guy refused to accommodate and we were forced to then order A la Carte, which did not turn out to be a bad thing at all. 

The service sucks...firstly, I think the steward could easily have accepted our request for a food only option. That would have a] made us happy  b] spared his mates in the kitchen, the pain to cook up A la carte

Secondly we found a great table with a view but since there were only six of us and it was a table for ten, he declared it 'reserved'.... again, very poor floor service for an expensive joint.

The decor is interesting and clean line, but nothing really stands out other than the beer bottle walls. The views at certain places are great [we did not get to sit there]. Overall, the ambiance is nice during the day. It may well have more of a punch in the nights.

Anyways...the food: Excellent! 

The menu is extensive and with very cheffy items [no standard items]. The menu makes you want to read more and can leave you undecided as to which creations you would like to attempt, until you finally decide that you need to come back again to try the others. 

We ordered cocktails and were happy to get one round free owning to happy hours. My cocktail was something like a black russian with a touch of tequila, which produced an interesting fruity flavour to the otherwise straitjacketed drink.  My cousin ordered the sex on the beach, which she seemed to really enjoy too. So full marks to the bar.

We ordered the Andaman Tiger Prawns, Kolkata Bhetki, Pizza for the kid and some kulchas + rice with a smoke lamb curry [indian] . All the dishes were par exellence and the portions were sizable. We, pretty much, scraped out the bottoms of each dish. The prawns were large and fresh and immaculately presented. They tasted divine. Hats off to the Chef.

The lamb was just amazing and had a deep smoky flavour combined with creaminess which we polished off with the kulchas and the rice. Dare say, the meat itself was a bit tough for my taste, but I know some like it that way.

We also ordered dessert at the end, even though we were ready to drop. These were a bit too ostentatious and would have preferred simpler arrangements. One was a sort of a fruit salad served in a stemmed glass, very pretty but nothing that lingered and the other had a creme caramel with a chocolate bowl and a maroon and some other stuff...a huge collage....so desserts: great effort, but too complicated for me.

After all of this damage was extensive and it worked out to be about a 1000 a head with the drinks....but no regrets.

Upping the service, this place has potential to become a talked about restaurant

Highly recommended!!!! Will be back someday.

Well dinner in Afraa...initially before going to a restaurant I tend to get reviews about the restaurant and then try it myself to get a clarity on whether the reviews are really a correct one.
Afraa had a very good review and I was in the mood to splurge, so thought why not?
I knew the price of food is not in any term average but I was more prone to check the quality of food, the service and the ambience.
To ensure nothing is missed we booked a table, however later I found out there was no need on a week night!!
I took my time to decide on the food and we chose Betki Piccata & Double fried lamb with crisp basil slices of mutton as straters with Australian Chardonnay White wine. The Betke was soft and succulent and the Lamb tasted heavenly, moreover the presentation was also really good.
The main course consisted of Dalat Spiced corn fed chicken with creamy forest mushroom sauce which was another finger licking yummy stuff.
The ambience was an average, despite the loud music coming up from the Afraa lounge, but its perfect for a romatic dinner provided you know what to eat and not get lost in the huge variety of food.

One of the few places in the city that serves Corona (and not just on menu), that solely being the reason for some of those review pointers. Very nicely decorated, very chic and very flashy, actually. Music's good and food is even better. The dance floor's always full with an enthusiastic crowd, something I don't always appreciate coz the glass isn't sound-proof and so there's no table in the restaurant where you can actually evade loud music. So that said, if loud is what you want your night to be, Afraa is a place for a must stop, anytime in the beginning, middle or end. The food is superbly plated and tasted aw-freakin'-some. I looove the Bhetki-piccata!
This is however, a properly posh restaurant living up to it's name and so while everything will be all good if you can afford it, it isn' the sort of place you should come to with a budget spending.

The overview of the cityscape from the glass pane is breathtaking, the complimentary(serve when you have along wait to look forward to ) bread basket has the best beer -battar  mini bread i have ever tasted and had that been my order- i would give afraa a 10 on 5. However the fetching title -Slow roasted pork chops in a thai curry with mushroom rice - is SUCH an enormous letdown and definitely not worth a 20 minute wait. The problem is the seemingly giant pork cutlets having 1 part meat and 9 parts of pork lard- that is nauseating and disgusting. Pork fat tastes best when crisped up. All restaurants serving- lamb, mutton and pork chops keep the fat on while it cooks through and then trims them off before service. While making a mess of my place with the laborious task of scavenging for meat  from the translucent white fat - i kicked myself mentally for not ordering the squid, prawn, mussel pasta that i originally planned to eat. I was also pleased that i had not ordered the lamb chop- IMAGINE the Massacre!!!

Awesome place to hangout with friends.
Have a great party, dance, go for drinks. Simply great!
I hope it was near to Joka, so that I could go there often.
You can also go in the balcony to enjoy the weather.

As a fine-dining restaurant, it is definitely one of the best there is in City Centre 1, or Salt Lake for that matter. The view from the seventh floor is amazing, and so is the food. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about their service - mainly because in such places, you would expect someone to be around most of the time but it wasn't the case. Overall I would rate this restaurant on the higher side, but then there's nothing exceptional about it as well.

I have been lots of place but afraaa is the place that always gimme peace. This is the best place in Kolkata where you will cherish every single moment spent with ur loved one. 

This is the perfect destination for romantic candel light dinner. 

This plave us ideal for perfect romantic date with your loved ones,  as well as the party destination if you are there wid ur buddies. 

Yesterday after an awesome movie we want a perfect place for date, so we visited there. We sat on the balcony table the beautiful breeze and the location gave us a big smile.  

The waiters are  very courteous and warm. He guided us to our table.  
We order 3 large Jonny walker black label nd a coffie base cocktail in drinks.  As the time was happy hours we got buy 1 get 1 offer in drinks. Next we ordered a bartenders spl cocktail (recommended by the waiter) that was heavenly awsome. 

After spending so many time there we opted for food so we ordered "cheese cherry pineapple" and "chicken cheese ham
 sandwich" those r afraaa's spl. Food's are very good, bt cocktails steals the show. 

As the sun sets waiters installed candle on the table tht became a dream place to be at tht time. 

As per decore, music, food, in every category tgis place wins our heart. This is the place where we will always to want to be nd enjoy the beauty of the city of joy from the above. 

This is the best rooftop restaurant in kolkata as per my experience of this place. 
Hope to be there again and again. 

At last i will say as always "EAT DRINK WORK REPEAT" 

CHEERS!!!!!!!

AS my office was in Salt Lake I visited most of the eat outs in Salt Lake and this one too doesn't miss my check list. I have been to this place 3-4 times. The first time it was an office lunch and we had buffet so I really had no idea about the price and the food was average compared to a lot of other buffets that i have eaten. In the first visit itself i loved the view from the terrace  with huge wooden chairs to take some rest and enjoy. The view gets better at night if you want to spend some time alone and introspect or with a special one. During my next couple of visits to this place I came to know about the price and started exploring the menu. Compared to what we get in other restaurants I feel this is unnecessarily over priced with the kind of service or the food they serve. The mushroom starter comes for around Rs 400 and this was 3-4 years back. The quantity was not to fill your stomach either. Similar is the case with the drinks if you explore. Some day I had to pay Rs 6000 for a friend's drink ( 2 pegs single malt i guess), a starter, one indian chicken dish and a rice or something. I think the dessert is nice and the place is good. If you ask me about the food I would say just average. Some items like the salads are rather good than the other items. Check it out yourself. Go to this place if you are looking for a fine dining experience in Salt Lake else there are other places in Kolkata for fine dining. Best of luck.

I had the lunch buffet there and it's really good . Egg frittata , chicken Caesar salad, lamb stew, fish tin tan were superrrrrb.
Blueberry mousse and carrot cake in the dessert section was delightful.
I would have given them 5 stars if they had more options in their starters.

This part of the city always wanted a place like this and Ambujas have succesfully ventured into it and succeeded in making Afraa one of the best joints in the city. The ambiance, music, service all put together makes you visit this place often. i love sitting on the open air area with my friends along with a Shisha and my patent non veg platter. the cool breeze along with the music makes it the appropriate place to hang around with friends after a hard days work.

Ambiance was wonderful... Good view from the 7th floor as well. I'm posting this review because I felt the need to highlight that the food was served cold on a few occasions. I had visited Afraa on a Saturday afternoon and we were a group of 20+ people going for the buffet. The  food was ok. It wasn't that great, but it was nice. the spoiler was that the food was cold, and after an hour or so, only some of the dishes were being heated. Mutton biryani was nice and spicy, quite different from other varieties of biryani, but I found a few small bone pieces in the biryani, had to eat carefully because of that. The quality of food needs to go up a notch higher, and everything else is all good...

Personally, I find the ambiance  at the restaurant quite romantic. The biggest put off at this place is the constant loud music being churned out at the lounge on the lower floor. The music has vitiated my serene dining experience at this place on more than one occasion. 

The food on offer at this place has been consistently good. I have been at this place on quite a few occasions and never returned disappointed. On my latest trip I ordered pasta cooked in a mixture of red and white sauce along with my choice of vegetables. The pasta was on the mark except for the fact that the sauce was a tad too thick for my liking. But I hold nothing against the taste of the dish I had ordered. 

Surprisingly, for a restaurant of this caliber, it has never been able to get its Fresh Lime right on any of my visits.

This was my maiden visit to this joint on a Friday afternoon. Being a  resident of the southern part of the city i do not get to visit Salt Lake very often.Thus when a chance meeting with an old friend came up i grabbed the opportunity to pay a visit. Afraa other than Kaafila are the few  fine dining options available at City Centre-1,Salt Lake. This joint is housed on the 7th floor of the building that also houses Apollo Clinic. For first timers to City Centre , finding out the joint can be a task given the horizontal and spread out layout of City Centre unlike most malls in Kolkata which are more vertical and compact.
I found the place to be relatively empty during lunch hours given the fact that it was a Friday  and the ongoing festive season. The decor was classy with chairs in pristine white leather,wooden flooring and the floor to ceiling glass facade which provides a majestic and uninterrupted view of the city.We were seated at a table for two by the glass facade and thus enjoyed the view to the hilt.
We opted for the buffet.The spread had the right mix of veg and non-veg items. Not very exhaustive but adequate. I am personally not a big fan of buffet spreads that comprise of  a huge spread of 50-60 dishes.No one can do justice to it and neither am i gifted with a gargantuan appetite. Amongst the starters we had veg caesar salad, egg mayo salad, shredded chicken salad, papaya and beet salad.They also served chicken reshmi kebab and paneer tikka on the table.I found the egg mayo salad, chicken salad quite tasty and well made.However the kebabs served on the table were a let down.Both were chewy and lacked the flavour. The condiment served with it was also not up to the mark. The paneer tikka was served with ketchup and the some pieces of paneer were kind of raw with hardly any masala coating on them.Mixed bag  experience with the starter section i would say.Perhaps they need to replace certain dishes especially a few of  the salads.
Now coming on to the main course.It comprised of plain basmati rice, lasooni  yellow dal, baked veg, aloo dum variant, kadhai paneer, baked fish in lemon sauce, chicken curry and mutton rogan josh. The mutton was the best of the lot.Rich flavoursome gravy, dark brown soft and succulent melt in your mouth pieces of mutton stole the show.The baked dishes-veg and fish both were a letdown and quite tasteless. Dal and paneer was decent and most restaurants get it right. Chicken was decent enough though nothing special.Bread items-naan-plain/butter and tandoori roti were served on the table.There is no roomali roti though.Sigh!!
The dessert section comprised of 4-5 dishes. I tasted the choco mousse,mishti doi, vanilla kiwi cake.All of them were really good.There was another cake variant too though i was too full by then to take a bite. would suggest to people who possess a sweet tooth to save the best for last.The dessert items were very good and kind of made up for misses in the other sections of the buffet.
Pocket pinch: Priced at Rs 500/- excluding taxes this is the closest to VFM-value for money option at Afraa. The added attraction is two-fold.There is a complimentary pint of beer or a glass of white/red wine. Citi bank credit cardholders get a 15% discount both on food and beverages.
Flip-side: Quite a few.Firstly water is served in this huge balloon glasses.I found them to be quite uncomfortable.I mean wine in balloon glasses is fine.But water- i drink a lot of water while having my meal and this huge glass with an equally long stem is a pain.Waiters are not very attentive towards guests and neither towards the buffet counter.Green salad is absent and had to be asked for. Refills at the buffet counter had to be reminded for. Continental dishes in the buffet were a disaster.They should correct it soon.
Last but not the least booze costs a bomb out here.We had 2 glasses of Caprioska cocktail(Vodka based).They were awesome as always but priced at Rs 450/ glass shocked us a bit.
If you are in CC-1 do drop in.Cheers to the festive season.

Afraa is located in the 7th floor in city center, it offers nice views. Decorated in white and wood decor, it has a wide range of food offerings in its menu. 

I liked the every time I have been there, however, it is quite expensive by price. Buffet is value of money, but food is not a varied as a-la carte.

I remember the non veg platter, and a satay was well done. They also serve great mojitos , few places in Kolkata who do.

It is actually a feather on the cap of Ambuja group. Yes it is expensive but once a while i guess one can pay that for a quality time family or that someone special. They have a special glass cabin sort of dining area which feels insane when it is raining outside. The 7th floor location gives a nice view of the city centre. It is my must go place whenever i am in town.

Been here with a Coupon worth Rs. 475/-  from Groupon ,which offers full course buffet lunch for one person with a mocktail.
We started with chicken and potato starters and the view from the glass was really mesmarising. Potato starters are average and chicken tastes delicious with mayonnaise. Bolied egg salad is good but did not liked the Chicken  liver one. In main course,
they had steamed rice, dal, paneer, veg curry, fish, chicken, mutton to relish the taste bud. In dessert two types of pastries, choco mousse and sweet card also taste good.

The service was nice and with a great view of Saltlake, really had a great time there.

Aafra, City Centre 

Located at City Centre 1, on the 7th Floor above the Apollo Diagnostic Wing, this place
described in one word is awesome! The glass facade gives a panoramic view of Salt Lake
from one side that definitely adds to  thrill of dining here! The ambience was a cut above
the class.

I happened to be here with my wife , who wanted to  celebrate my B’day on the 19th and 
had also invited our Brigadier friend & his wife to have lunch. We opted for Buffet which was 
smartly priced @Rs 862/- inclusive of taxes.

We started off with Beer for the two for us while our spouses settled for Fresh Lime soda Sweet.
There were  starters two types of starters ,assorted veg pakodas & grilled chicken tidbits accompanied with two types of dips. 
For lunch there was Tomato Soup, Choice of salads,array of pickles ,chutney & dips.The spread had a mix of Indian & Continental dishes.For the main course there was Mutton , Fish & Chicken.One of the veg items Potatoes in Khatta onion was gr8!The mutton was indeed very well made. For bread we had options for Tandori roti, Garlic /Butter Nan,Kulcha, served at the table. There were four kinds of dessert
to choose from.
The service too  was satisfactory. On the whole the entire experience at Afraa was worth the money!
It will make you feel comeback again & again!

Food is tasty.... c'mon where wont you get tasty food in kolkata :) ..... beers are not so tasty.... due to the price tags... 
Afraa doing great to up the nightlife in kolkata, but genuinely needs competitors.

superb decor, gr8 view of city from the restaurant, superb quality of good...what else one needs if u want to spend quality time with your near and dear ones....didn't gave him perfect 5 only because the rates are preety steep for a standalone restaurant...preety much comparable to any 5 star hotels....but I would also like to say food quality of most of 5 stars are not at all gr8...

If we consider the ambiance then surely it will be one of the best. Food options in buffet are also extensive. 

But their is only one cons:

Unlimited drinks in buffet service is not at all a good option, though they provide red and white wine, but these drinks are not worth a try. Dont come only because of this unlimited drink facility.

Otherwise food, dessert, starters all are worth a try.

One of the best option for parties.

Definitely one of my favorite restaurant's in Kolkata. Be it the food or the ambiance or the staffs. I love everything about this place. Never found anything to complain about this place and I always recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a good place to dine out with friends or family. 

Special tip- always opt for the window seat.. from where you can see the whole saltlake city from the glass.. amazing view that just enriches the taste of the food even more ;)

Being one of the best restaurants of Kolkata, Afraa lives upto it's standard. The veg platter is really very good and I would ask everyone to give it a try speacially the dahi kabab. Lasagnia is really delicious. However, the staff is not efficient in their service and I had to wait a lot for the food to arrive which gave the restaurant negative points. All in all, it is worth a try. I would recommend foodies to go and check it out!

Have been to Afraa a few time, and unlike other restaurants Afraa delivers quality every time. 

The food has been delectable, I would recommend the Indian and the continental selections. The non-veg Kabab platter is a must try, the pastas and the thin crust pizzas are one of the best in the city in terms of consistency of the product. 

The service personnel are well equipped  and trained to be attentive but not intrusive. The soft live violin blends well ambiance. 

Would recommend all to visit Afraa if you want to have a memorable dining experience.

Have been to Afraa 4-5 times during the last couple of years every time for an office party. Situated on the 7th Floor of City Center, this place is very famous among the office goers in and around Salt Lake. Afraa has two sections, one lounge area and another restaurant for proper dining. The lounge is usually booked on Friday and Saturday evenings for office parties. The bar area is great with experienced and trained bar tenders. Afraa serves good cocktails and fire shots as well :) 

The Food: The food is not that great. It is just average. I have mainly had appetizers here and found it very average. The thin crust Pizzas are however very tasty and goes well with beer. The desserts are pretty good, especially the in house pineapple cake. 

The ambiance is quite classy with an optional outdoor seating. Afraa also serves hookah. Though I have not tried it, but I have heard that the hookahs are good here. This is a great place to party but the prices are definitely on the higher side. Cost for two would be around Rs. 2500. A must visit if you are looking to party near City Center.

Went there after reading the reviews here. Well was not disappointed. Although it was a weekday with rains all around . The place was nearly empty so had all the attention of the service. The buffet was quite good and heartening . Liked the ambiance and the service. The price is quite reasonable for a week day lunch buffet. The spread was more or less satisfying but without any surprises . Had expected some continental stuff in the buffet but had to be content with with the more Indian fare. Will recommended  .

Primarily very nice ambiance. Service is relatively fast but you kinda like to soak in the positive atmosphere till the food arrives. The restaurant started with exclusive Italian menu but gradually diversified into various other cuisines including Indian. I guess thatz coz of Demand Supply Algorithm :) A variety of choices for the veggie guys. Will highly recommend the Four Mushroom Pasta and Anti Pasti.

I must say they are one of the top 3 restaurants if you count ease of access, parking, food quality, ambience and decor, service and staff behavior and professionalism. And honestly they get 4.5 in all the above. A very very good restaurant indeed. Only point anybody can raise is their price, I agree, a little overpriced, but, please also check the quality of ingredients and service they provide and the food they serve. My personal favourite.

service is great,so is the food,but be careful about what u order,u will get exactly what u ordered for..but like the complete saying goes..you actually wanted the one on the next table.so ask the waiter discreetly(they are very discreet!)and then go about ordering.its your money after all,and you are going to be spending quite a bit of it!

The place has a good Ambience.  

Negatives:
1. Pricing is more than what it should be. The rates are not at all justified. 
2. Hookah is very bad. The people making it don't have much idea on how to prepare. 
3. The management is very mean. I didn't understand for what they show attitude. 
4 . Not a good collection of liquor. 
5. DJ part is not great.  Its ok ok. 
6. Food is ok.  Not that great too. Taste factor missing is some of the dishes. 
7. The staff behaviour is very bad.

Afraa Salt lake

Like most of my food escapades, Afraa too happened by way of a team lunch. We had signed up for a pre set menu. Here's my two cents on the experience:

Located at Salt lake City Centre 1, Afraa stands at one of the most prized properties in Salt Lake City. Besides, it is famous for it's lounge and the Friday parties. What gives Afraa an edge is its Balcony where the smoking zone is located. Amazing view. A 4.5/5 for location.

Ambiance -- A complete recipe for a pleasant dining experience, the interiors are very appealing, which somehow would make your expectations from the food shoot up through the ceiling. The stylish bar, the interiors done with wood, the view from various corners of the place, all amazing. Five-On-Five for ambiance!

Staff -- Courteous, helpful. Since we were a huge group of over 20, and we like to hog on the non veg starters, they had a pretty tough time serving us, there were delays, however that is but natural

Food -- Here's the big one, food at Afraa is above average but not amazingly tasty. The veg starters -- Veg Kebabs were good, non veg starters were about average. 
Paneer like always, did not impress me much. The fried chicken wings -- they have a different name for this -- was good as well.

The main course was elaborate with a variety of salads, which was impressive, with sprouts, to fruits to fresh vegetables, different peppers. Disappointment was with the lamb biryani. Overall the main course was fine, though my expectations from Afraa was more. Nothing in the main course section that I would remember and say wow! They had this multi-tiered shelves where pudding, mousse, pastries and sweets were kept, which delighted me. Afraa did win my heart for its starters.

Overall, I can give Afraa a 4, though the pricing is on the higher side, the outlet does not have the general mass as it target customers so it is fine.

When you walk into Afraa the first thing which strikes you is that the place is expensive, And hell ya it is but worth every penny of it. The continental food here is just to die for. Order anything continental (I have never eaten anything Indian there) and it will mesmerize you. The place has a nice feel to it with its dim lighting (but not dark) and its glass bottled decor. The menu has one of the most elaborate wine collections I have seen in Kolkata. Unfortunately though not everything is available all the time. (A bit of a negative thing for an otherwise awesome restaurant). Anyway grab a decent bottle of wine and enjoy a sumptuous meal of finely prepared chicken and seafood. The service is good and the staff are adequately polished. Never leave the place without having a couple of chocolate pans. If you want more they will give you more as well :). Overall a very nice place, a bit on the expensive side, but certainly a place your should put on you Wishlist.

The ambience was great, from the enormous glass window you can see the city very far, it must be looking more wonderful in the evening, I need to come back for that. I visited the restaurant today at around 2-15 PM. I ordered for Kolkata Betki(fish) and sweet lemon soda. The betki was just awesome. However the cost for only two items came about Rs. 938/-, so it was pricey indeed. I also found they offer lunch buffet which is Rs. 500/- + Tax.

With your ass vibrating through the roof, the definition of 'fine dining' indeed took a new definition in my dictionary. With a discotheque on the 6th floor, a 'candle lit' dining experience will not be what you had expected. *Or maybe it was just a ploy to get your food digested faster* Otherwise the restaurant had an amazing interior. Very welcoming and the view was very pleasing to the eye. Over all it was a pretty comfortable place to dine and the violin player added much to it!

Coming down to the food, we ordered a Afraa's signature mixed grill. The pork chop was nothing great or to slurp over but the chicken,the lamb, the fish and the prawns were pretty tasteful. It was something we all enjoyed thoroughly! And amazingly it was pretty filling! Meat was juicy and well cooked. 
We ordered for a chicken and asparagus Risotto which was really good! I am picky about a risotto, but his i found very well made and creamy. It tasted good and this too was pretty filling!

Overall a good experience! The tiramisu to end the dinner is also something you must try to end happy!

The cocktails are quite nice . I tried a crispy vegetable pasta and it was delicious. The red pesto pizza was also excellent although by the time we were done with starters and the pasta we were quite full. A special mention for the Brunch at afraa on the weekends. It's just perfect for a Sunday brunch over some relaxed conversations .

Food at Aafra was good. Service was good too. We were a group of 5 -- so we could taste a number of items. The chowder (soup) on their menu was amazing. So was the chicken Ceasar Salad -- the greens were crispy and was served with garlic bread. We had taken the non veg kebab platter -- that too was good. My husband opted for salmon pasta -- he liked it. My lamb chops in mushroom sauce was heavenly and succulent. So was the ginger flavored mocktail I ordered. My friend had ordered bhetki steak in honey mustard sauce and her husband grilled lobster in the same sauce -- they both liked it. We had no space for dessert. But they served chocolate dipped paan with the bill -- one of my friends loved it a lot. However I like both my chocolates and paan unadulterated. But that is just me. Overall, good good and good ambiance.

unfortunately, both the times I've been here I've opted for buffets so I havent really got a chance to explore their menu; but judging from the quality of food they served, I bet even the a-la-carte's worth the money!

Not Out of the world, but good

Afraa surprises you every time with extra courteous staff to least bothered ones, it also surprises you with the food! The pricing seems to be a little high.
We have been there for breakfast buffet and loved the unlimited wine, and starters, but the main course was a put off. The pizza was weird, not tasting the best they make, noodles cold. 
Otherwise, it has decent food, good view of the city, nice interiors and well, with the staff, I hope you get the good ones attending you when you visit!

Located in one of the most visited places during weekends, Afraa at City Centre 1 is one of the best restaurants I have been to. Loved the ambiance and the food was delicious.

We had visited after 12:30 pm, so took the buffet lunch and the menu was continental that day. Right from starters, the food was great. There were 7 types of salads of which I loved the 'fetushi', fancy names they had! The main course had lamb, chicken, rice with oysters, a splendid dish with egg yolk ( I was too busy enjoying the treat and hence can't remember the name of that dish :P). 

Did I mention that we got complimentary wine too? That felt wonderful :D

Coming to my favorite part, the desserts. There were cakes, pastries and ice-creams of almost 10 varieties. I certainly remember the date nut wrapped in chocolate and topped with cream which felt heavenly. 

If you are looking to have a good time with a special someone or making that someone feel special, then Afraa is like your safest bet. The decor, music and the overall setting has a very positive vibe. A sumptuous yet totally worth it treat!

Great ambience.. Good food..

The amazing view of outside from Afraa.. The music playing inside.. the eating arrangement, the decor, everything is just perfect for a soothing sensible experience!

I had opted for a lunch buffet in my first visit.. the soup & d starters were served in the table itself.. but when some of us asked for a second helping of the started, they just said we need to collect it by our own! That was rude I felt..!

The salads were of all varieties.. they had served salads with ingredients starting from eggplants, pasta, walnut & what not!! there were 10-12 kind of them and I could only taste 3-4 of them, which were strictly okay!
Then came the main course.. We were shocked to see one type of rice and Only 2 types of gravy (Mutton & Fish) were present! We were supposed to pay more than 750 bucks per head and we were getting only 2 side dishes in the spread!! No chicken, no prawn!! anyways, we adjusted with that and I have to admin both the mutton and fish were superbly prepared! Great taste, amazing flavours!

Semi-happy with the spread, we moved on to their dessert counter.. We were shocked again! 8 kinds of desserts! That was WOW! The mousse, the brownie, the pastry, the ice-creams, the souffle, the chesscakes, the kheer & the gulabjamuns... with 4 types of sauces.. & each of them was amazing! I could have paid a 1000 bucks just to have those desserts! OMG, they were absolutely heavenly!!

Afraa is highly recommended for people having strong sweet tooth, like me!
The pocket pinch will be on a higher side, but the ambience and the quality of food(dessert I mean) will definitely make you happy!

I've been there a couple of times with friends. Good Italian food. Ambiance is also ok if you are a smoking person. It's a bit let down on the outdoors as it's clouded with the smoke of the cigarettes and hookahs. I didn't like the ambiance being a  non-smoker myself.

Very good ambiance. Also, my wife and I like the fact they experiment with their menu. Good food. One very big complain is that most of their servers are extremely arrogant and uncaring. It's like some of them specifically hate to serve, but are there because of money. Couple of the managers are also very arrogant. They also don't care. 
Hate to see a very good concept dragged down by a bad serving team. There is one server we really like though (Souvik). Very courteous and proactive.

Afraa located at City Centre is an absolutely superb experience for anyone and everyone. The moment you reach the 7th floor where its located, you get a hang of what would be greeting you.  The first thing that strikes you and amazes you about this place is the ambiance. Its just screams wow. The lighting is just perfect. The seating is so comfortable and the music system is the real hero of this place. They play nice house and trance, a welcome change from lounges playing trash. The vibrations of the music helps soothe your senses.
They have happy hours which we could not avail but still it was a delightful experience. Love the Virgin Mojito mocktail there. The Veg platter was a disappointment though. They can definitely work on their kebabs and probably introduce more variety. The service was pretty good and quick and the staff was friendly. Pricing is steep but you can expect it from such a place. 
Just loved the place and would be visiting again and again. 4.5 stars for Afraa.

I find Aafra to be flawless! Seriously! My policy is-when in doubt, go to Aafra. They will NEVER dissapoint you. Be it presentation, service or food. Go and freely order anything off the menu and you will be happy. I have no particular favourites as i experiment freely everytime i go in. However dont order their pasta since it is not exceptional, though it is good. Again, when in doubt order a pizza- best in town. And douse ur food with genourous helpings of olive oil... Im particularly fond of their desserts - mousse n cheese cakes. Their carrot cake is a bit dry and ive has better muffins. Their salads are gorgeous too. In fact their kebabs r brilliant as well. The best thing i like about aafra is that they use cheese in a manner that the different flavours of different types come out. They dont under estimate their customer at all. You shall always leave aafra with a smile.

IT'S ON A ROOF-TOP AND ITS A BAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Afraa is a stalwart here and for good reason!!!!!!!!!

This unsurprisingly popular spot is one of the few ROOFTOP restaurants which has a bar ,a diner's delight during the spring season!!!!
Its spacious,really good decor,quality of food is excellent,nice hookahs,service is good and quick!There is an assortment of hookahs and chairs for lounging.
We ordered :-

-Barbequed frankfurter

-Afraa's signature mixed grill with pork chops,chicken steak,spicy lamb barrah chops,fish,sausages,prawn,fried egg,tomatoes,mushroom and jacket potatoes.

-Warm dark chocolate cake,chocolate sauce,honey nut crunch icecream
 
All the dishes were FULL-FLAVOURED and HEAVENLY!!!!!!!!!

The staff are so friendly, it really beggars belief but you will not be disappointed plus the attention to detail is EXCELLENT!!!

This is a destination bar par excellence, with unbeatable views, a crowd who are blinged up for the occasion and relatively easy access.

Will give it 4.5/5 for the ambiance and service.
For the food, a 4 on 5!!

Overall quite an impressive experience I must say. To start with the atmosphere here is very chilled out and refreshing and the ambience is very well done. I feel the lighting of the place too is very suitable and adds on to its positivity. The choice of menu and its taste needs to be appreciated. The continental section is really nice and so is its Italian section. The mocktails are also well made. The prices are kind of high but I feel manageable. 
I feel the crowd there also has a standard and you won't feel uncomfortable due to stares all around you. So I would give it 4 and suggest all to try this one for sure. Don't miss this one guys.

Sunday brunch was nice. Slightly puzzling selection on spread but that is how it goes in kolkata . Come to think of it, everywhere. Chicken liver salad was good. There was bandel cheese , along with the usual imported suspects. No blue cheese, which is a pity , as very few people eat them so more cheese for those who like the!!! Also, cheaper for the restaurant , too , A hunk blue stilton will probably last a month. 
Wine was sula, red, robust. Came for free, almost, so cannot complain. 
Biriyani was very good.  
Skipped dessert. Slightly unimaginative motley.
Go for bottled water.

Visited Afra after almost 3 years with a few family friends last Saturday. The place has completely lost its charm. The service quality was too bad. Took ages to serve. We went at 8 PM and left the place only at 11.30 PM and that also we did not order any drinks. The Platter took more than 45 mins to come. We ordered the mains quickly but still it took another 45 mins. One of the dishes (Nasi Goreng) had cockroach. When showed, the waiter came and took the plate away and replaced with another without offering any apology. Ridiculously pricey for the kind of service they are providing. Top it all there was no water in the toilet. Horrible experience. Will never visit this place again.

The restaurant is on the 7th floor of Salt Lake City Centre. It has a very upmarket feel and very good ambience for fine dining experience and matching price-line. But the food quality did not match the ambience and price. We ordered Pizza which is a thin crust one but was lacking in cheese and sauce and taste. The spaghetti bolognese was too spicy. In the sea food platter some items like squid has too much spice in them while the lobstars were too bland.

However the complementary bread basket with small soft breads and cheese dip was just fantastic and so is the complementary Paan with dark chocolate coating. If the main courses had maintain this standard it would have made the restaurant one of the best in the city.

Although it is not cheap by any means, what makes Afraa stand out is the great service and amazing lunch buffet, which is quite unlike most other buffets in Kolkata. They stock an array of cheeses, some local and some imported with this mindblowing kul-er achar and gives you good wine/beer if you are feeling like a drink. The a-la-carte is again, my favorite, as the choice of food is quite vast, and tasty.

I love the ambiance, the service which is really efficient and up to the mark, the attendants who know what they are serving, the HUGE seafood platter and the wine. The last time I went there, I was totally taken by their risotto. This time it was the buffet. Keep up the good work, Afraa!

Food quality is delicious. Prices are expensive and quantity is not much,,,,the quantity should be increased. I had a preparation of Chicken which was well done. Staffs are polite. Ambience is nice...the fish preparations were also tasty.

i would rate 3.5 for AFRAA RESTAURANT.

The restaurant with vibrating floor..that is the name i would give Afraa.. i have always loved continental food and u get the right taste of it here..the quality of food is worth mentioning.
and when u are not ready to compromise on the quality , it is just right for the pocket..
the decor and ambiance is good too.. so if u want to shake your leg along with some delicious food from all over the world Afraa is the right place for you!!



----- 30 Jan, 2013 -----

i would call this restaurant as a restaurant with a vibrating floor because the restaurant is divided into 3 parts..and the discotheque is just below the dining restaurant..
the food is undoubtedly the best, have always been a fan of continental food and afraa is the best..the decor and ambiance is good too..
a perfect place where u can shake your leg and enjoy good food...

AFRAA, mostly known for its great ambiance and location, it offers a great view of the salt lake city from the 7th floor of city centre-1. The interiors are amazingly done. 
AMBIANCE- Super, wooden floors, amazing cutleries etc.
FOOD: is a bit of a let down. The taste was okay but nothing to get excited about. 
PRICE: VERY HIGH. A meal for two will not cost less than 3000 (with 1 drink each)

A restaurant shd be known for its food and not its ambiance. so i will not be rating this place too high...2 out of 5 from me.

very very expensive but absolutely great food. Loved the ambience. Only issue is you wont be able to make a quite dinner because of the discotheque one floor down which makes Afraa quite noisy environment. 

Jumbo prawn starters were too good. Wish to visit it more often, but price wise it is quite expensive to consider it for more visits.

Went there for lunch buffet (500+tax). The ambiance is good. The 7th floor location of the restaurant offers a good view of the city. But any restaurant should be known for its food and this is where this restaurant is bit of a let down. The main course mostly consisted of usual Indian/Chinese dishes. I expected more of the European fare. The taste was OK but nothing to get particularly excited about. The taste of the few continental dishes on offer were also somewhat "Indianized" Overall I will rate this restaurant as average.

I am talkimg about the afraa lounge and not the restaurant. The ambience is very good and probably u wud not get it anywhere else in kolkata.
The hookah and happy hours are the only other good things about the restaurant.
Taste of food is not as good given the price. Also the service is not good and can be called amateurish.
But if you are looking to hangout with friends in the evening, take a hookah and you wpuld not regret. Also they give out the space for private parties a lot time, which is quite irritating as it ruins your plans.

If you are tired of the usual fried rice and biryani then trust me you must go here and I would say visit Afraa after twilight the large glass pane will give you mind blowing view of Salt Lake and it would just add to the experience. Great place for a romantic evening date

It used to be much better when it opened. The Restaurant seems to be on a downward slide as far as the taste is concerned. Every visit of mine I find it gone down by a notch or two. Their Sunday brunches are very popular but the menu is a big let down... they serve trash as food. A'La carte is better.

Wish they go back to their old standards. It used to be wonderful.

I am primarily a vegetarian though when it comes to food I DO NOT discriminate. So i was part of family dine-out yesterday.

Afraa City Center
Ambience : super, the waiter will light a floating candle as you take the table.: CHIC!
The important thing i that you are on 7th floor and the design of the restaurant lets you feel that you are indeed on 7th floor which I think works wonders for serious diners!

We had : Puttanesca Pizza, Mediterranean mezzeine Platter and Burnt garlic risotto.

Puttanesca pizza: Texture was super, crunchy yet too hot for my taste.

Platter:           Very good with all the goodies i.e. sauce (tahini, hamas and all the other essentials), a small pitcher full of black and green olives drenched in olive oil, peta bread, the fillings. All very flavorful and heavy.

Burnt garlic risotto: Star of the evening. Well balanced ,spiced , tecture very good, taste - awesome!

Apart from these there were 2 virgin drinks : Afraa lip lock and vrigin Mohito
They really tasted good but afraa will have to do a lot more to actually make them go with the food. 

value for money : Okay.
Service: very good!

Afraa.. Located in City Centre I in Salt Lake.. It is divided into two parts restaurant and lounge.. I personally prefer the lounge over the restaurant due to its private and comfy seating and open-air spaces, to indulge in idle chit chat and to just simply relax. Arfaa in Arabic means white. And the entire interiors of this lushly done up lounge bar are, yes, you've guessed it right - sparkling white. I went there recently, and was impressed by the overall appearance and feel of the place. The fusion music reaches the soles of your feet and you cant help but sway and tap along. The food is okayish but as the restaurant is located in the 7th floor, it provides an excellent view of the city -- which is what makes it so special. The Happy Hours they have in which they give 1 on 1 on drinks is a great crowd puller. Otherwise it's a bit pricey.
Three and a Half stars from me :)

A cool place to hang around, have food, drinks & chat. The offers are also nice. Service sometimes takes time. It offers a brilliant panoramic view of Salt Lake from the balcony seating and has aesthetic interiors. It started off pretty well but now over the years, I have personally experienced a great decline in their quality and service.

For almost last one month I am having lunch at Afraa.  The food is excellent, especially Garlic Toast, Pasta with Mashroom in white sauce is awsome. 
There are a few thing I did not liked about the restaurant is usage of black pepper. Black pepper is used in a large extent in almost all dishes.  Also the salads have too much of dressing.
But overall I will recommend this for a light lunch or dinner with a glass of wine.
Cheers

This place is one of our favorite places in Kolkata ! Not only is their staff really friendly and amazing, but they're food tastes brilliant as well. It isn't very pricey especially for the quality of food that you get. They're pizza's are amazing and the pork chops are brilliant as well. Everytime we've been there the staff have made us feel absolutely at home and they're super warm and welcoming. This is probably the best place you could go for a nice romantic date!
Quick Tip - Try visiting at Happy Hours to get a more economical deal on drinks

Being bored of the usual haunts on Park Street, i decided to give Afraa a try and boy am I glad that I did. 
Afraa can proudly say that it sets the standards for fine-dining, in an otherwise "confused" dining market. Located on the top of city centre, this place offers spectacular views (although the last time I went, it was marred by metro construction), breezy weather, great decor and ambience and delicious variety of food. 

Afraa is split across 2 levels, the restaurant and the lounge. I personally prefer the lounge over the restaurant due to its private and comfy seating and open-air spaces (smoking ;)). Its the perfect place to impress a lady or pamper your loved ones. Each floor is tastefully decorated and ornamented. I hear Mr. Neotia (owner of city centre mall) was personally involved in the design of this place and it shows. 

Afraa serves a variety of cuisine from oriental to Indian, and all are painstakingly prepared to serve you a delicious meal. The shahi chicken and lababdar are my personal favourites. The service is outstanding and I doubt you'll come across more friendlier waiters anywhere. Another great novelty is the chocolate paan that they serve at the end of every meal.

While it is an expensive place compared to other joints in the city - whoever said fine-dining is cheap??? I look forward to many more meals and evening at Afraa.

I like the paneer korn palak and chicken afghani , Biryani was also good. In dessert you must try roasted chamcham. Overall it  didn't match as it was touted.i will rate this place 2.5.

There is an impression that Afraa provides good Italian food in Calcutta. I asked for Raviolli (stuffed pasta that was there in menu) and like every other restaurant they said they don't have it! Authentic italian touches e.g. sun dried tomato, cheese varieties were missing and other pastas looked pretty ordinary.
We also ordered lamb chops, that was not succulent at all.

I had a lot of expectations from Afraa. Some were met..some weren't. The reviews on Trip Advisor told us to expect small amounts of food and exorbitant prices. Heres a small brief on what went right and what didn't. The ambience was pleasant, if you're going in a group be sure to book the larger tables as some of them have great views. We were a group of 4 plus my 15 month son. We ordered a kebab starter, tuna salmon salad, sea food grill platter , mixed meat grill platter and a lasagna.
The kebabs were overcooked, and the lettuce in the salad seemed wilted. However the Seafood platter and Mixed Meat Grill Platter were a joy to eat. However we spent close to Rs7500/- (we had around 4 to 5 drinks)...so definitely overpriced..in retrospect it may have made more sense going to the Hub at Taj Bengal.

1. The food is indian 'western' - that is, it is tailored to the indian muglai taste buds and cooked accordingly. Food is cooked well.
2. Service is okay.
3. It is not deserving of its 'self rated 4 star' as the food is not authentic western food, but an indian version of continental cuisine - oily and spicy.

Afraa Deli in Salt Lake City Center:We had the chicken strips and tuna and egg grilled sandwich. The chicken strips were horrible! Not worth the money at all.The sandwich was ok but they took upto 45minutes to make it! They told us something about how their kitchen is on the 7th floor and took their own time.We also had a chocolate milkshake and darjeeling tea both were not great totally not worth the money! The ambience and location is good but overall the experience was average.

Afraa Creperie is one of those places that makes me grin broadly with pleasure. The first thing that struck me was the elegant and tastefully done up interiors. The Creperie is visually part European Bistro, part English Pub, part colonial Calcutta clubhousedining hall and part library !! Simple but aesthtically pleasing, the restaurant oozes warmth and class. The USP of the Creperie is, well, Crepes! The menu, while not elaborate, is very interesting. Sweet, tasty crepes, amazingly soothing salads... and a crepe suzette to make you want to exist on crepes alone.... this is a fantastic combination of continental food with Calcutta cuisine. Please try the Coq au Vin Crepe, or the Frutti di Mare crepe, if you like chicken and fish. Vegetarians should try the spinach and cheese crepe, which is good too. and try the fried chicken salad, which is worth noting.
