The name of the cafe is quite relevant as it is situated at the footpath of Sinthi More. A small and cute place with a "traffic" themed decor.  Lets's come to the main part- The food_ We ordered Sweet chilly Chicken wings and Hot chocolate.. The chicken wings were just delicious, The hot chocolate was not upto my expectation though, still can be visited undoubtedly without a second thought.

A small joint with colourful indoors and small capacity of sitting around 20 people,this food joint is quite a steal.
The Corn N Cheesy pasta is creamy and smooth on your taste buds but they charge for any kind of ad d-ons. I added veggies only and the total was 150 .
 The Grilled Chicken in BBQ sauce Bread was good but I wish the filling was a little more.
Affordable.
The owner and the server are quite cheerful.

I have visited this place with my bestie. We have ordered pan fried momos. These are really tasty 😋.. The graffiti is very nice. Graffiti and decorations of this place are compatible with its name.This restaurant is ideal for adda sessions.

This place was in my wishlist for a long time. Visited recently. We had to wait for 8-10 minutes. Ordered wings of foodpath, chicken rajnikant, minty nimbu soda, frozen choco churmur. I liked all the preparations except chicken rajnikant. It was full of whole spices and taste was bitter. I will definitely visit again.

I highly recommend this place if you are a foodie then must give it a try. The foods are yummm. I won't say it's a very pocket friendly option but if you want to satisfy your tastebuds then this is the place . We had chicken lasagne it was extremely good and cheesy and we also ordered chicken 65 and a bowl of ice cream which was simply out of the world. The ice cream had choco drizzles and wafers i highly recommend that. Over all its a great experience , must give it a try.

Pros
1. Nice theme based decoration.
2. Decor is done according to foot path theme from where the name is taken.
3. Good hang out place.

5. Good variety of menu with moderate price.
6. Food is fine. I ordered butter chicken momo and cafe caramelo. Both were re-order worthy.
7. Well behaved friendly guy for placing order.

Cons

3. Privacy is compromised.

Overall- value for money.

A small restaurant,rather modified coffee shop which bring so so much to North Kolkata. Seating capacity is of 18 people with 3 big and 3 small tables. Interior is of FOOTHPATH theme.. 
Now to the main story.. We ordered Fish and chips for starters. 4 medium sized basa crispy fried fish with French fries with a dip of masala meonise.. Ignited my taste buds.. Cappuccino and Coffee Valentino was excellent. KitKat shake along with brownie shake was competing with each other.. Then came the Chello Cabab.. All these and no GST thereby making your meal more tastier and merrier..
Lastly don't go by the looks of this joint,just enter and have fun.. You won't be cheated..

Best zone for Adda 👌 
Though small in space with limited number of seats. 

Its a small one room restaurant located at the Sinthi More , easy to locate. 
Decorations are nice with road theme. 
Clean, good, pleasant atmosphere with Bollywood songs being played in the background  🎶

Coming to food - I ordered for Peri Peri Chicken Nuggets, Cappuccino , Frozen Churmur . Chicken Nuggets were very good at taste , hot n crunchy served with Mayonnaise.

Cappuccino was even nice. 

Frozen Churmur is a must try for all ice cream lovers. They serve with 3 scoop of ice cream, 2 cream rolls n chocolate sauce and choco chips. 

Services were good , it took time little more than expected as they have a lot of rush for delivery orders and all. 

Staffs were good. 

Prices are extremely reasonable.

Although Foodpath is very close to my University I made my first visit few days back. We ordered the following:
1. Meat Lovers Sandwich: The sandwich was very good according to me. The grilling was on point. Overall liked the sandwich. Quality of the food is very good. 
2. Blueberry Exotic Lassi: Now this was something new and refreshing. Tasted well but a little overpriced. 
3. Cafe Cappuccino: The way they served the coffee reminded me of Keventers, Darjeeling. Nothing great about the coffee. The usual one. 
I am looking forward to multiple visits in the future and would like to try the chelo kebab.

Been visiting here almost regularly for the last 2 years or so. This is a very cozy little cafe in the Sinthi area (maybe the only one where you can get some decent Italian food). The food is good. A little bit pricey, but tasty and of ample portion. One should definitely try their cheesezzy (white sauce) pasta, fish & chips and the cafe cappuccino.
 The chelo kebab is also okay.

As for the decor, it's cool and funky. The seating arrangements might not be very comfortable, and sometimes you have to share it with others. But at least their choice of ambient music is commendable (expect for that one weird phase where they had To Brazil by Vengaboys on repeat).

I have one gripe about the menu though. The current one maybe the second revision (and price hike) of the food items. They have ditched the puja special menu (after over a year) and expanded it with some new items. But I would very much like to see the salad items from before. Please bring the salad back!

Themed upon on footpath of Kolkata its totally a new concept of cafe. In Sithir More area there isn't much cafes available, so they are taking full advantage of it and pleasing people with their cafe experience. Ambiance is colourful, specially street lights matches the theme well. There was only one stuff present to take order and serve. Going through their menu card this is what we ordered...

Kit Kat Break Shake (4/5) :
----------------------------------------------
Kit Kat Break Shake was served very well in a mug where lid portion was filled with chocolate syrup. The sweetness of the shake with chocolatey flavour and crunch of Kit Kat, this drink was almost perfect. Except I was expecting 2 sticks of Kit Kat on top of it, that would have made it look much better.

Butter Chicken Momo (4.5/5) :
----------------------------------------------------------
It wasn't just Momo it was awesome Momo. Although 5 pieces of momo was served in a plate but they were so well cooked that someone can hardly say without taking a bite. Buttery flavour and mashed chicken inside tasted too good also momo soup tasted quiet decent.

Everything was going good, I was ready to rate this place 5 star but then this happened...

3 Cheese Lasagna with Chicken (1.5/5) :
----------------------------------------------------------------------
With the fascination of having good pasta on that day, we ordered this dish. This dish was served extremely well in a glass bowl with 2 garlic breads on side. It looked dam delicious until I took a spoon of it & then it was full of surprise. The dipper I went, more and more vegetables I found. After a few minutes it felt none less than veg curry to me. Taste wise it wasn't like pasta rather it just felt hot & salt less. It was served with Chicken add ons still there was very less pieces I found. Pizza seasonings, salt, paper, chilli sauce nothing actually worked for me. With broken heart somehow I ate it, because I don't like to waste food.

Pricing :
---------------------
Their dishes aren't dirt cheap like real footpath food counters. But its very well priced and enough value for money. No added taxes makes this place students favourite too.

Conclusion :
------------------------
Nice theme & ambience, well behaved staff, fast service makes this cafe good enough to give it a second try. But whenever ordering food look around your table and order the items others have ordered.

I really really enjoyed the pasta, BBQ fries and lassi that day! 
The thought of BBQ fries tickles my taste buds every time I think about it ;)
Will keep going and try all the new items added to the menu :)

Located near sinthi more this is small cafe soothing sudden cravings of students like us. Quirky walls , colourful chairs make the place very vibrant ! Though to mention the sitting arrangement was not at all comfortable. The stuffs were pretty reluctant to take the order. So we ordered

Brownie shake - Definitely not as good as shakes in other cafes , this was pretty average. The amount of brownie in the mug was also not sufficient.

Oreo shake - This shake was better than the brownie shake and the small Oreo crumbs made the shake taste amazing.

Chicken nuggets - These were delightful , deep-fried nuggets with a fresh coating , crispy from outside with sufficient amount of chicken , and the mayonnaise dip with it made our tummy all happy.

The place is pocket friendly , they don't charge gst yet. If you are in the locality , definitely a must try. :)

Great place to spnt tym with frnds.. Dis small food joint  definitely has the capability to make your "Adda"
more yummilicious.... 

Decors :
It's a theme based restaurant. From it's name we can easily get it's theme.. And the theme is Side walk.. Although it has few sitting arrangements but it is really good. The food joint is air conditioned. There are wall paintings of Autos and other vehicles..  wooden benches gives us a feel of " Chai ki Thek". And the yellow  black striped floor has it's own beauty. It really gives us the essense of eating in a side walk..

Location : 2C, Kali Charan Ghosh Road, Sinthi, Kolkata, West Bengal 700050


Staff and service : service was good. There was only one person who handle the whole thing.  Both billing and serving..


Food:
We tried kitKat break shake, steamed butter momo, chicken cheese lasange. 

KitKat break shake-  It was delicious.. Main ingredients  were chocolate crush,  chocolate sauce, Heavy milk and obviously  kitkat crush.. It was properly garnished with roasted crushed almond.. And it was undoubtedly  one of the best shake I jave ever tried... So it's highly recommended by me.. 

Steamed butter momo- It's also a pataka.. Please don't  judge it by it's look.  Because it has a regular steam momo look but it has a wonderful buttery taste.. It was served with  soup and sauce.  The sauce was spicy..and the soup was also pretty much good.. The stuffing was also really very nice and it was just melt inside the mouth.. 

Chicken cheese lasange- It's basically  a multiple layered dish.  It was kinda " Au gratin" in nature. So it had multiple  layers  of pasta strips, veggie & chicken mix and of course cheese.  It's also highly recommended by me. 
P. S : It's a live dish actually. You can select your own choice  of bases, toppings..

Pricing : No GST or extra taxes... And price is pocket friendly. .
All over its a nice place for evening outing.. U can enjoy ur food wid adda...

Being a student of Rabindra Bharati University, Foodpath happen to be my go to place. Located at Sinthee More the tiny food joint is cosy and pocket friendly. The interior seemed quite justifying the name of the restaurant as the it gives you a glimpse of a street. A road is flanked by footpaths and the sitting arrangements are set on both of the footpaths. Due to the limited space one needs to share table with other customers. 

 Now comes to the food, me my friends used to order Fish and chips, Asian pan fried chicken and Frozen creamroll necklace. Fish fillets are properly fried so are the French fries. Pan-fried chicken was so spicy that it made me cry. Lastly, the desert Frozen cream roll necklace was heavenly delicious and the taste still lingers on my lips.

Been here today with my sister.. The small place is well decorated according to its theme. We took Cream & Corn Chesezzy Pasta which was really tasty and Kitkat Break Shake which is a sweet crunchy treat for tastebuds. Prices are also reasonable and the caffe even doesn't charge any kind of taxes. Staffs are very well-behaved. Service is really good and they don't even accept tips even if you want to give.

Been there yesterday with one of my childhood friends. We were meeting after years and thought to spend some time here. But all tables were full and a 2 seater table was vacant but 2 bags were on the chairs. We thought there might be people who have gone outside so we waited outside. After plenty time of waiting we saw a group of people are leaving a table and they took the bags! The staffs didn't give a damn that we were waiting outside for plenty of time. Well we entered the restaurant and ordered the following items- Honey Chilly Baby Corn, Pan Fried Momo & KitKat Shake.
1. Honey Chilly Baby Corn- though it was written crispy fried baby corn in the menu card but it was not crispy at all but the taste was not so bad.
2. Pan Fried Momo- 5 pieces of Chicken momo tossed in Schezwan sauce are served with capsicum. The other momo options were not available. The momos were hard as if these were kept in refrigerator and after ordering these are tossed in sauce. Taste was not good at all.
3. KitKat Shake- the best part of the visit was this only. It was delicious in taste and one quantity is enough for 2 persons. It is a MUST TRY item.

The ambiance was good. Music was being played. It is situated 2 minutes walk from Sinthee More towards Sinthee. The staffs need to be more professional.

Have visited this place bunch of times with my friends. Yesterday I went there with my parents. This cafe is small yet very pretty and a nice place to spend your evening, gossiping with your friends and family. Yesterday we ordered two plates of pan-fried momo and cafe valentino. Taste was average. Food presentation was good. I think it could be improved. Staffs are very polite. I really like their cocktail icecream <3.

Oh I have been craving for this type of cafe in my area.. There have been many places in South kolkata which are definitely great cafeterias.. but in north kolkata very few places can really compete this one.
As the name suggests, the theme of this restaurant is Footpath full of Foods. The street lamps, wall decoration, floor everything suits the name. But the food is not at all street food. The food varities and quality is above awesome. And the price is also reasonable.

We ordered:

Peri peri chicken nuggets - 10 pieces of chicken nuggets served with Mayonnaise dip

Chicken Lasagna - tastes really good

Frozen choco churmur - 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream and one scoop of chocolate ice cream served with crushed rolls and chocochips anf hot chocolate fudge

And Brownie Cookie Shake

Total bill was 717/-

Only Con of this place is the lack of space. Only few seats are there. I wish they enlarge the cafe and allow many people at a time to have seat inside.

I have been to the Bangur outlet which has actually been done up even more nicely but still that is usually empty whereas I have stood in the line in the Sinthi outlet. Only one suggestion, they should offer some refreshments to the people standing in the line as a complementary gesture.

A small cafe themed with the name fabulously and mostly student zoned.

We first went to the Bangur branch. Bit found it closed. I ringed their number but they didn't pick up. Then I thought to go to the sinthee branch. I called them and they confirmed me that this branch is open. So, we stepped in there for the first time.

Coming directly on food.

We ordered :

1. Chelo kebab : Quality and quantity both are well . We know the best place for this item is "Peter Cat" where they took 450 bucks without VAT and 'Foodpath' is taking 265 bucks. And still the quantityity is same and quality is not that low at all.

2. Pranko Fried Momo : It was 99 or 110 bucks and tasted good. It tasted a little like KFC crispy chicken. Only fault in it was there was much onion and less chicken. But as it's crispy enough, we will let that matter go.

3. Blueberry Blast : A shake is Mandatory right ? Liked it . But it was over sweet toothed.

4. Melting Oreo Shake : The word *mouthwatering* is so much made for this . They give chocolate syrup , Ice-cream , Oreo blend and some broken Oreo .

They don't take any tax differently . How many themed cafe are so cheap ?

Maximum food in minimum price .

Nice place for so called adda.. just a few blocks away from my home.. The minus point is its very small and very easy.. Getting a seat in the peak hour is a long wait.. But apart from that its a nice place for hanguouts.. Among the foods special are chicken terrazinni and chelo kebab here is also good.. Served red hot!! Tried kitkat shake and oreo cookie shake.. The kitkat shake was awesome..
The dont take gst.. A major plus point!!!

It has a very nice ambience and a happy feel to it. It's like an escape from the usual Bangur outlet, in a good way. And of course, you have delicious food to go along with it. My only suggestion would be to start off with proper meals.

Great place for a quick bite... Aptly decorated according to its name aroun d roads & footpath theme.. But the seating is a bit uncomfortable specifically the benches. This is usually a takeaway joint but the service is satisfactory .Though it has just a couple of absent minded waiters. We had a couple of plates of mixed veggie pasta ,a cool virgin blue & a pins colada. D quantities & quality was appropriate according to the pricing.

Visited this place thrice. Best for casual friends meet up or evening outings 
Must try is the raw mango mocktail, fish and chips.
Disadvantage is the place is quite small and you may not get enough place if you are going there with large group (10-12 people)

I don't know why I come here inspite of being disappointed each time. It seems they have changed the menu since the last time I dropped by. I ordered Mac n cheese and Kit kat break shake. The pasta was more like a veggies and cheese since it had more veggies than the actual macaroni there's supposed to be! The kit kat shake was okay. It did not taste much like kit kat shake though. But then I found chunks of kit kat at the bottom of the jar. Behold! Indeed it was a kit kat shake. *Sighs* The only pro is it's an air conditioned eatery and the prices are inclusive of taxes. 
But all in all not nice people. Not nice.

This is to be the second time I'm reviewing 'FoodPath'. Compared to the first time, the splendid quality of delicacies really made up my evening. "Chicken cream and cheesezzy corn pasta" were always irresistible choice. Cheese is the core factor which caramelized the sliced veggies and corns; Whereas shredded chicken took it to the whole new different level. Now bringing the spotlight to the star, here comes 'Chicken Rajnikant'; A fine suggestion of the owner himself.  This soft, succulent, moist chicken infused southern flavours were a total 'BADASS'. A delightful striker to knock your tastebud off with its flavoured punches. Seems like I left you no choice but to hit FoodPath for once ;)

I am a frequent customer of this retaurent. Day by day the service of this place is getting degraded. Staffs are not at all professional. Yesterday I visited this place with my sister. one offer was going on, that was on Fish & chips, they offered Rs.199 platter at Rs.179. We ordered Chelo kebab, fish & chips.
The staff who was at billing section, he added Rs.199 to our bill. My sister checked it, when she asked for it, then he returned the blance.They first gave us Chelo kebab platter which is a main course. We expected Fish & chips to be served on our table first as staters. When we asked him, he said just to wait for few minutes. After 30 minutes when we almost finished our chelo kebabs he told us that only 2 piece of fish fries were available, and offered us to adjust the platter with another 2 piece of chicken wings, we just cancelled the order at that moment. I was really disappointed about the service. One request to the owner, to retain the reputation of your restaurent, please get more well oriented staff.

As goes the name, the restaurant is located on a footpath. The decor is on point. Ambience is good. This cafe mostly serves Italian dishes and this a restaurant themed mostly for students. Coming to the food, ordered cheesezzy chicken alfedo, Kolkata fish n chips, cafe cappuccino and kit kat break shake all were delicious. Space is a bit too clumsy as they have only 5-6 tables. Overall a nice cafe to hangout.

I had ordered Penne Sausage Arrablatta from the sinthee outlet to have it packed.
Came back to check you had out normal chunks of chicken.
That would have been completely fine had it not been full with bones and portions of chicken that are not fit to eat(chhant pieces that are added to chicken stock on road side food shops) certainly to not be served at a cafe.
Very very disappointed because I am now sorting all the meat pieces away.

Please don't cheat your customers like this. If you didn't have sausage pieces, you could have said so.

The one thing I didn't like was the seating chairs.. they were really uncomfortable.. I know that was following the theme but still I made me really uncomfortable.

Now coming to the food.. we order some drinks and Mac and cheese and barbeque chicken...

Mac and cheese was ok.. not an super one but kinda liked it..
Barbeque chicken was good
Drinks were fine.. I forgot the name..

So here are my points

Lets come to the main point. The FOOD.
Chelo kabab was damn good. Mango mastani shake was also very tasty.
I dont know why they cant serve any shake of choclate. Kitkat shake was my target, but they cant fullfill it.
It was my 1st time experience with cheloK as well as Foodpath. And i liked it. 👍

A small restaurant that serves mainly snacks located on the right hand side lane from sinthi crossing if you are coming from chiriamore side.
Its a small restaurant but the theme and the decorations are really eye catching. Its quite cozy and comfortable. As for the food , its quite good.
I had gone there with my friends and it is a good place to have snacks and gossip..
We ordered fish n chips, delhi styled cheezy pav bhaji and grilled chicken sandwhich.
All the dishes were really good, the fish was basa fish served with mayo and fries and tasted really good. As for the cheezy paw bhaji , it was a real delight to have it, the bhaji cooked with a lot of cheese was really good. The sandwhich was also nice with lot of stuffing and grilled to perfection and served with chips .
Overall it is a good place to eat.

I had huge expectations from this place. But the hopes kept on shattering as the clock hands moved during my visit.

The Menu list as presented here on Zomato is the same presented there. It's as old as "Puja Special" of 2017 and most of the dishes, even masala cold drink is unavailable.

We ordered Chelo kabab and Baked fish with butter rice. The later was unavailable. The former was okay, if not compared to the authentic Peter Cat's one. Grilled veggies except for tomato were missing. The sausages tasted like those brought from the chiller section of a grocery store. Next, Lasagna with meat balls was unavailable. The attendant said that Lasagna with chicken slices can be served. And then when it was served, half of the cheese on the top was burnt, half uncooked. While eating it, I soon realised that chicken slices were very few. Instead it was filled with veggies like carrots and broccoli. But that wasn't supposed to happen, isn't it? And the cheese in the lasagna..yuck! Tasted like a seasoned batter of cornflower and water. Very very disappointed! The only thing good were the drinks. We tried Blue Lagoon, Chill-o-coffee and Chill-o-coffee with chocolate. All were absolutely delicious!

Now the hospitality. Just one attendant, who was either busy on the phone or too deaf to not hear even in such a small enclosed room. His attitude was one of the worst I've seen in this business.

The ambience is good. Cafe like, cool. The owner had good ideas while launching this joint, but the employees are ruining it.

Never coming back!

A small cafe style eatery located in a place where there are few places to sit down and enjoy with your friends. Colourful walls and a footpath themed decor looks nice. I had ordered steamed chicken momo as a takeaway. It came with a clear chicken soup. The picture of the momo and soup is on my personal plate. The soup was just about ok and the momo was nice. No sauces accompanied the momo by the way. Dont know whether they forgot to pack it or thats their style.

I loved the placed. Food is good and the interiors is quiet interesting.

I frequent this place mostly for Kolkata fish and chips. It's awesome. The fish is perfectly fried with the right amount of crunch. And mayo with flavour of mustard is the perfect combo to go with.

I don't favour the momos much that they serve as there are other places in the city that serves the best momos.

You can also try out baked cheese ball lasagna. It's good.

Their service is quiet prompt and I liked the fact that they inform us if the food orders takes more time to serve than the usual time taken.

A roadside thematic cafe with some great food. 
Pros: Pasta is really delicious except spaghetti meat balls, that I really don't like coz of too much spice in it. Fried section is again a hit, one must try Asian pan fried chicken, fish n chips. And lastly​ shakes are there to refresh your taste buds; it's nice and much better than CCD in terms of quantity quality and pricing all three aspects.
Cons:
Sandwich is tasty but too costly compared to the place where you are having. Spaces are little short I feel. And prices can be little bit cheaper.
Overall a decent place to hangout with ur biddies.

Just had the worst possible delivery experience possible from FoodPath today. Just a kilometer apart from my place I have always wanted to try this outlet out. Today for a Saturday evening binge eating I went for their Mile High Meat Lover Sandwich, their costliest sandwich going by the menu with extra cheese and The lemon Iced Tea cooler. To my utter surprise they delivered the ice tea in a filthy and used plastic soda bottle because THEY WERE OUT OF TAKE AWAY PLASTIC GLASSES. Now clearly when this kind of situation occurs, you either cancel the order or simply try and arrange for a glass anyway. But that doesn't give you the authority to serve your customer a beverage worth 70 bucks in a plastic soda bottle used for months. I was taken aback and naturally I had to throw it all away because of an instinctive disgust about the way it looked and delivered. Now coming to the sandwich it was a two layered sliced bread with a poached egg, shredded chicken, tomatoes and cucumbers in between. It tasted very ordinary rather tasteless. Lacking enough stuffing, also I didn't find any extra layer of cheese for what I paid 25 ruppees extra. Very disappointed and irritated. If management is listening, you should stop collaborating for home delivery if you people are that bad on delivering the same. Totally scrapped out the urge of visiting this place in person. Just cannot believe I paid 280 bucks for this and ruined my evening.

This place is near to my house, though I have visited the place many times earlier,but after a long time went there for pampering my tummy 😂 after returning from tuition I was bit hungry and chose to have something there, so I ordered #BbQChickenWings and #CoolVirginBlue. It took time to serve the dishes, but when I tasted it then I get to know why it was a bit late to serve. Lolz. But it is of course a nice place to visit, hangout with friends or to pamper your Tummy 😘 the stuffs were helpful and presentable. For sure I will be there again :)

Even if I want I cannot give it more that 1.5. My escape from the pathetic mess food turned out have a bad ending for I choose to try out this cafe. Most of the things on the menu weren't available and rather we dictating what we wanted to have, we ended up having the only pastas that were available. It is very difficult to get a classic White Sause pasta wrong, and they did it. Bland to the core, we had to add figuratively tons of oregano and chilli flakes to make it atleast edible. With no salt and milk like white sause, the pasta was a complete letdown and the food at mess seemed more promising somehow. 

The only thing good about this place was ambience. And that is why 1.5 is for. Rest, I am never landing up in this place, ever!!

I ordered another plate and it was one of the most satisfying meals i ever had, I'm coming back for this dish particularly again.

Being an old and regular customer i may say that this place has always been awesome. Food quality, quantity and pricing is always satisfying. However, today my frnz n i ordered butter chicken rice, the famous chelo kebab, Kolkata fish n chips. Cheezzy corn penne in alfredo sauce and Mexican corn salad. All of them tasted good except the Mexican corn salad. It tasted awful. So i deducted .5 and another .5 for the unavailability of some of the dishes like baked fish and gondhoraj prawns every time i wish to have them.

The only cafe kind of restaurant is Dunlop area. It is a small restaurant. Generally you have to wait to get your table. They have nice sandwiches. Pasta is also good. Snacks like momo, salt and pepper mushroom, fish and chips are all good. Drinks are nice too. They used to have masala tea which was very good, but they do not have it now in their menu. Also variety in sandwiches have decreased. But they have added some new items in the menu. Sandwiches in the new menu are a bit costly. Other than that nice place to hang out. Do give it a try.

I've visited this place a lot of times. They've now got a new menu with some newer additions to the list of delicious, must have foods. 
Because I've tried almost everything that they serve, let me provide you a detailed review. 

Firstly, the ambience is pretty good. The interiors live up to the name of this place as the tables and seats along with the painted walls make you feel like it's on a footpath. 

Moving on to the food: 
Pasta : 
1. Spaghetti with meat balls - 2.5 /5
2. Baked Meat ball Lasagna - You have to try this one. It's super delicious , to say the least. 4.5/5
3.Penne Sausage Arrabiata- 3/5
4. Cheesy chicken Alfredo - 2.5/5

Coffee:
1. Cappuccino - 4.5/5. This is probably the best Coffee . Better than CCD. Enough said. 

 Momo:
1. Fried Chicken Momo - 3/5
2. Pan Fried Momo - 4/5

Overall, this place is good. Do visit it.

Being a big drooler for Pasta & Spaghetti, I find this place to be a food-heaven close to home.
I've tried most of their dishes. These guys don't usually disappoint. Except, there's a certain 'Spicy Chicken Wings' that I particularly didn't like.
*PENNE ITALIANO is a real hit if you're looking at Pasta. While 'Spaghetti With Meatballs' was bit of a letdown.
*Their latest inclusion is Chelo Kabab. Don't call it so if you don't want to ( :P ). But the dish is worth a try.
*They also deliver at your door which in my case was almost 3km away. :)
*For dining-in, don't expect a lot of privacy though!
Overall, cool resort for after-class hangouts or serving your stomach after an evening stroll.

Visited the place yesterday. And now I am going to write the experience.
First of all it is very small outlet. It has two tables for two persons and 3 tables for 4 people. And it was hot there.
We ordered momo,but they said momo is not available, so we ordered spaghetti with meatballs. We need to wait 20-25 mins for the dish and some people came after us but got the food earlier.

Then the food was horrible. The meatballs were like homemade small daal vadas. They didn't taste like proper meatballs. And the spaghetti was not cooked properly. There was much more spices and oil and gravy than the spaghetti. It tasted like chicken or mutton kosha. 
Toooo muchhh spices. When we take first sip only oil was there.
Very bad experience. Will never recommend.

Foodpath stands to be one of my favourite hangout zones. I have been highly impressed with the overall ambience and their constant effort to get us something new. You can give the coffee a miss and try their refreshing mocktails for a change. I am a big fan of the fancy bottled soda based drinks they serve.The traditional fish and chips couldn't get any better and non veg pastas are creamy and tasty. I also recommend the butter steamed momos which are soft enough to melt in your mouth. My only complaint is the smaller portions served that keeps getting lesser with every visit. Other than that, Foodpath surely deserves a mention since they have become quite popular in North Kolkata.

The ambiance is also pretty, the inside matching perfectly with the name 'FoodPath'. I have already tried all of there menu and so finding a few li'l extras on it on behalf  of  Pujo special delighted me. Ordered Ghondhoraj Prawns with Lemon Butter Rice and a Monster Oreo Sundae, the latter suggested by the restaurant staff. What do I say, I enjoyed them thoroughly, especially the sundae. I would request everyone to give it at least a shot. Going to visit again to tick off the other Pujo specials.

Foodpath has filled the vacuum created by the sheer absence of cafeterias in Sinthi and Baranagar. The decor is absolutely brilliant and so is the food. Fish and chips, chicken and cheese pasta etc. are sure to make you visit the place time and again. There is a bit  of space crunch,  which is overshadowed by the highly stylised decor. My suggestion is to include more continental dishes on the menu and to start an active home delivery service.

It's a small cafeteria, nice and warm decoration, nice ambiance. You have to be selective before ordering here, as some items are great and some are just bad. Go for the barbecue sandwich or any kind of pasta. The beverages are not up to the mark, lassies are too sugary and hot drinks are average. Momos are also good.

The design of the restaurant exactly simulates a food path which makes you stop for a while, look around and admire. Being completely air conditioned and having a good decor, the place has most certainly qualified as a perfect place for chit chat. I had been there on several occasions but the first time, I vividly remember was the eccentricity of the place that had attracted me. 

Now coming to the food, I would say that even if its not extraordinary, the food here tastes good especially the CHELOW KABAB and the STEAMED MOMOS, which I had more than just a few times. Ask them to brush a little less butter on the momos.

Happily Recommended!!

The worst thing about this restaurant is , they asked for money at the time of order

One thing kept in mind when we enter in the restaurant we must have money with us.

Ordered through a food delivery app. We decided upon a chicken lasagna & a creamy chicken Alfredo which was quite delectable. A little less cheese could have been great. My friend ordered a salad which was crisp and not at all soggy. No extra taxes.  Recommended.

Food Path is a small, thematic eatery, with a foot-path like interior design, vibrant wall paintings, and lip-smackingly delicious snacks at an affordable price.
This one seems to be a hot favourite spot for couples and friends to hang-out, located off the Sinthir-more crossing.
I ordered for Chicken wings and Fish & chips. Could not help but to gorge on them, and in the end, licked the sauce and mayonnaise off my fingers too.
Only negative aspect is that, they lack a wash-basin!

Good food ... Good quantity 
The cheesy pasta could have been cheesier and more dense.
The stir fry chicken sausages was way too oily.
Just a few corrections in the cooking style will make the place better.

Very popular joint with most prominent con being sitting space. Its innovative architecture akin to a roadside footpath intact with cobbled street along with excellent food is a crowd puller, hence it mostly remains crowded in evenings and you have to wait for a seat.
Have tried their casear salad, fish and chips and momos along with mango mastani.
Food was good to taste and portion was enough only the suggested mango mastani didn't live upto the recommendation.
Waiting time is also a con. As customers come and go, I had to remind them twice for my order. A few items were not available like the chello kebab.
All in all would go back but better management is desired.

They have a small seating place in the evening it's always crowded ...

Edit:what is the purpose of listing your online delivery in zomato when you guys clearly unable to deliver..
Ordered twice both times later you guys cancelled the order... That's why am decreasing the rating 1 point

As I frequent this adorable cafe, it was time I reviewed it too. It is a small food joint with some of the best sundaes, pastas and sandwiches in the area. It has also opened another franchise in Bangur some time back, proving it's efficiency and demand. 
They have recently added Chelo Kebabs to their menu and this dish, as the name already suggests, is a pure delight! And the catch is, the pocket pinch is so low with such satisfactory food quality, you would never leave this place unhappy. 
I would have given it a complete 5 if this joint was a little more spacious and hence avoiding the long wait to get a seat. 
There are too many excellent dishes here that must be tried, describing them individually would be impossible. So I am adding the pictures of the dishes that you cannot miss while you visit this place.

This is the second time i had something from foodpath and i am very upset and disheartened with the services. back in 2014, when i visited for the first time, i was so much impressed with the quality of food. But sorry to tell you, over the time food quality has degraded. First, I would request you all to learn time management for online orders.I placed an order at 7.40pm and they delivered it at 8.50pm. And my house is just 5mins far from foodpath. You people informed it will take 30mins, 30mins became 1hr, and 10more mins.... what kinda service is this?? I called so many times, no one bothered to receive the calls.
Second, food quality have degraded a lot. I have ordered creamy chicken pasta, chicken club sandwich and cool virgin blue. I was again disheartened with the Pasta. Somehow this pasta couldn't make me happy. Next chicken club sandwich was a blunder, Was that really a chicken sandwich??? (Please take a look at it.. and did u forget to add chicken in it?? ) Soda was okay.
I am highly disappointed with you guys, maintaining the reputation is good but dont compromise on the quality.

After visiting the bangur outlet i really didn't like this outlet. Most of the menu's were unavailable, no lasagna, no sandwhich, no fried momo. The items available were so less that our bill didn't even cross Rs150. But anyway the food that they served were nice. Tried the 50-50 momo and butter steamed momo, both were nice.

If its sunday and you have a friend to gossip, coffee is the best option. Located at Sinthir more, if you are coming from Shymbajar, it will be on your right hand side. It has only 6 tables (a little bit cosy) but the decor is quirky and superb. We ordered for Hot Chocolate ( marvellous), Momo 50-50 & Tangy tomato pasta (spicy). Awesome food. If you want to taste good food do pay a visit to this place. The staffs are very friendly, courteous and the service is too good.
Prices are also reasonable. Highly recommended for North Calcutta people and if possible try that "Hot Chocolate" (one of the best, I ever had)

I think the cafe is doing well because when we were eating many people were waiting outside.. I think they should increase their space if possible.. I have also tried their bombay keema pav. And last but not the least, the foodpath cocktail sundaes is totally bliss. it has fully pampered my sweet teeth l.

Now foodpath is a very small eatery at the busy and congested sinthi more bt probably it's one of its kind in such a locality. Wher u expect mostly small hardware shops, basic grocery shops or egg roll counters at max as the main roadside eatery I actually felt surprised locating this restaurant. The place is lil congested u may be sharing table with strangers sometimes..bt the food is good and if u take the local standard it is extra ordinary and rare.. salt pepper fish we tried which was good though tooty frutty ice cream was a let down..pasta was good.. actually a good spot for the local young crowd for hangout..

The food is served in an attractive manner which makes the food all the more delicious. On a Sunday evening I had visited Foodpath with a friend and we had ordered Chilly Cheese Onion Toasts, Spaghetti with meat balls, Salt and Pepper fish, Crazy for Chocolate and Lime Soda. Each and every dish was delicious. Nice place to visit on a lazy evening!

I went there at 7.30 pm evening. With lot ofof expectation. But sadly, most of the food items were not available.and pretty lack of Veg item from the menu. Ice tea (raw mango) was little harsh in falvour not a descent experience.  Pasta was avarage.  enviroment was meant to be good. but ac does not works properly and they have bad choice of music. plays it much more louder than how it is required. Prices are pocket friendly. good place to hang out. but It really need some quality control and take care of these things. decor is good. but ambience need improvement.  and Menu written items should be available.  So, looking forward to its improvement.  It has lot of potential to become a good hangout place with good ambience and mouth watering snacks. I wish I can give it more than 4 next time.

They know how to make the best out of a small place located at a prime location in North Kolkata. Very creatively they have given a little place the look of a street of Kolkata by painting cars and putting up traffic lights,street lights ,paving up footpaths inside. They serve light snacks like sandwiches,toasts,omlettes,momos and beverages desserts,icecreams ,pastas etc. The buttter steamed momos served with thukpas are scrumptious . The mixed veg pasta was one of the tastiest pasta dish I have ever had. It was cheesy and melted in mouth with exotic herbs and sauces. The pasta is surely one of the numerous delicious things in the menu to go for. Do visit this place once. ♡
....................................
Paid a visit again after two years probably. It's pretty much the same. The ambiance,the menu. Only that they have become more popular and better at their service and quality of food. Keep it up guys.

Situated near sithi more..this place a very small food joint with a varied selection of snacks and drinks. Firstly, decore is OK but loud old Hindu music is like tortures to the ears. Service is OK. The one and only good thing about this place is, food. Good pasta, good salad. Chicken wings were a bit over done but well cooked. Pasta was the stand out winner of all the dishes ordered. They served ceaser salad with runny eggs which was really good. This place has a potential to go high if they do better dishes and do a little research about the food they are serving. Weak seasonings and too much spice are dish killers.

The place to grab a quick bite when you're hungry or the place to sit around with your friends for a adda with good food. My go to place with my girlfriend. It's a small joint. People have to queue up during busy afternoon hours. She loves the place. Good music and good service. Coming to food, they have a lot of items I haven't tried em all.  I love their sandwiches especially the coleslaw. Their cold items section is one of the best. Lassis, sodas are quite good. Served in containers and bhanrs . I am not a big fan of pasta but my girl lives the pastas here. I once tried their spaghetti meatballs and didn't like it at all. Omelettes are exceptionally good. Try pan fried momos and chicken, fish and chips, keema pao etc. Worth the money. Worth the waiting time. 
Very accommodating service. Kudos to the team.

My association with this joint goes back to my college days, when I used to occasionally stay back at our flat at Sinthi. The joint had just started up and they used to serve amazing pasta with white sauce and succulent and amazing momos. The menu was limited then. Slowly on, I have seen it evolving.

Location : this one is located near sinthi more. You head towards kalicharan ghosh road. A minute's walk and you locate it on the right hand side.

Decor : the theme of the joint is quite suggestive of the name itself. Its joint on the footpath where food is available, so foodpath. The walls are painted in with a lot of traffic, zebra crossing to make you feel that you are there amidst the road. The lamppost, the bird's nest beneath the lamppost, the street lights, the manholes are suggestive of what they want to potray. The joint is a small little 18 seater.

Ambience : the ambience is indeed nice. What I particularly love is the old bollywood classics and jagjit singh that is played. Gives such a nostalgic feel and is indeed relaxing.

Staff : the staffs do know the menu well and is point blank at suggesting dishes, which turned out to be real good. The staff is courteous and amicable.

Coming to the food way, to beat the summers was a much needed drink.
Beverages:
1. Strawberry blush - the sizzled up soda with strawberry pulp proved out to be a messenger of god to save me from the dying heat.

Food:
1. Bombay's keema pav - have been trying to locate a joint which serves keema pav. Because the last time I was in Mumbai, I wished a keema pav shower to occur always. And I finally did find keema pav available in food path. The minced chicken was cooked real well , sandwiched within pav with a dash of lemon, onion and green chilli took it to a different level. Highly recommend.

2. Fish 'N' Chips - the fish n chips was yet another the bombarding affair. The portion was quite generous. The fish fillet was quite thick. Marinated real well and crumbed fried to ectasy which melted in the mouth. however I have a complaint about the dip they serve. I would prefer them to serve the mayo and tartar dip seperately rather than just culminating it together.

Value for money : I believe such great food at such affordable prices are a rare phenomenon. 

By my sheer luck , all the food I tasted was real great, so a must try. Next time, awaiting for few more surprises. However people in Sinthi more need not worry, great food is available at their doorstep.

It was a bournvita drink. So dont try for it.. KEASAR LASSI was again mouth watering. For evening snacks, It is a must visit .Today was just a trial run!!Will go there next time also.

I have been hearing such good things about Food Path that I had to try it out today. I ordered Spaghetti with Meatballs in red sauce and loved it! The flavor is more Indian than Italian though. It is spicy, so tasty and incredibly filling. I just had half of the dish and I was full. Today was just a trial run but I'm impressed and I'm surely going back for more.

A long due visit to a close to home food joint. A dapper name "Foodpath". The food was simple and very tasty. A fresh welcome to the chop chowmain kabab roll concept of evening snacks for north kolkata, with healthy tasty continental snacks. We ordered the Mexican egg, very tasty nicely done and cooked to perfection. The corn and cheese toast had a very considerable amount of cheese , the aam panna soda was a refreshing drink in this Mercury bursting summer. I visited with my dad he ordered coffee that was also of very high quality. All in all a very welcome change and a great addition to the oh so boring never changing culinary destinations near sinthi and dum dum. Now the pocket pinch, all this at ₹300 not at all costly of I go by today's single trip to a CCD or so. Surely a place demanding many more visits to try all the things in menu.

Food is good. Prices are reasonable. Service is fast enough. Only drawback is that it's not spacious. The other outlet at Bangur is spacious though. Both the outlets provide same quality of food. Ambience is roadside types which is cool. I will recommend this place to all the people who are looking for a pocket friendly yet a good place.

First of all its a gallery only thing interesting is wall art . Now the most important thing which is also the bad part that is food . I mean WTF . The sandwich was anything I can get from a roadside hawker and sometimes roadside is better. The pasta again WTF who died making that shit ...come on . Also very disappointed with the Zomato users giving 4 plus rating to that shithole is not cool guys . If you want to know the difference between the dishes its all in the name. Guys a strict no go like ever even if your life depends on it.

The interior is smartly designed like a footpath but the place is too small. We ordered Chicken Coleslaw Sandwich, Stir fried chicken sausages and Mexican chicken sandwich. The first two were good though the third had too much musturd to our taste. We had also ordered milk shakes. Over all quite pocket-friendly and a nice place for a quick snack.

After a long day at work me and my friend decided to barge on something since we were really hungry..
So thought of trying out at this new place near our home..had it in my wish list for long.. the decor is really good..they give U the feel of footpath as small tables on the side of footpath..
For food we had Masala Cutting Chai and American White Pasta.. 
The pasta was him and the chai definitely would take up all ur headaches.. 
Will try the other food on the menu next time..
The only thing is u have to go up to the counter to order food and have to check on for the food..otherwise place is good for college goers and pocket friendly..and with a friend for chai instead of coffee.. ;-)

This is small eatery near sinthee more. The interior and decor is in a perfect blend with its name. Colourful walls one of which was filled with comments from satisfied customers. The floor is a replica of a footpath and seating arrangements are made on its each side.

Service was prompt and quick. The food also tasted good. The butter chicken steam momo (had a good stuffing of chicken), pepper fried chicken(spicy), and hot chocolate sundae were tempting.

The location of this restaurant is great. It is located at a place where there are hardly any food joints. The decor is interesting and quirky. Quality of food is really not upto the mark.
---------
We had cheezezy veg pasta and the same variety in chicken, and fish and chips.
-------- 
The pasta was awful...as the white sauce was full of flour. It even smelled of flour. Very disappointing indeed. The fish on the other hand was okay-ish....not that fresh though...the chips were tasteless. It was evident that the potatoes had been cut into fries and frozen for a very long time...hence the bland taste.

Fashioned like a footpath, the place is quirky with colourful walls that brings a smile on your face. Otherwise there's nothing much to the ambience as it's really small and you have to be lucky to get a place, that too sometimes shared. We ordered penne italiano, drums of heaven, stir fried chicken sausage and all of them turned out to be well prepared and delicious. The only negative thing is that the momo dishes are not available before 5pm. And to add to it, on the day we went there, they could not serve many of the sandwiches and salads. On the whole, it will not burn a hole in your pocket but avoid it if you want privacy. For foodies though, such things hardly matter!

If you cannot take orders for online delivery, then kindly switch it off and help potential customers save time. I know that yours is a small joint where people sit on shared tools, so even delivery infrastructure might be a problem. In such a case, you should switch off online delivery even for customers who have prepaid for their order.

Thanks

It's a small deli corner. Decently furnished. Fairly lit. Rates are decent. Good for a nice evening snack.  Cutting one point  for promising home delivery but not providing it. The pasta thing is also not very tasty. Lacked seasoning.the Asian pan fried chicken was nice but garnishing is an issue

After reading so many good reviews in zomato we have decided to go to Foodpath. Foodpath is located near Sinthi more (10 minutes by auto from DumDum station). Foodpath is a little joint for addas with petpuja... 
When we visited the restaurant for lunch, it was almost empty.
The Concept of the restaurant is very attractive ... the walls and the floor and tables, chairs all will remind you about Footpath. We ordered
Chicken Ceaser Salad
Chicken Lasagna
Asian Pan Fried Chicken
Blueberry Sundae
Pina Coloda Sizzling Soda
Ceaser salad , lasagne was too tasty and sundae was really lip smacking...
Pan fried chicken and Pinacolada was ok ... though Lasagna was best among all and it was too cheesy and scrumptious...
Overall we enjoyed our lunch and service was good ...Normally you have to pay while ordering dishes at first...
#A must try for lasagna

Went here a few days back with a friend at noon time when the cafe was quiet empty
Location- a few steps from sinthi more near the auto stand which goes to 30a/ dumdum.
Ambience- like d name.. Benches on footpath, seats are not so comfortable. But during summer the place is comfortable as it has a.c
Food- we wanted steamed momo which was not available hence we ordered 
corn, cheese and jalapeño sandwich which was served with wafer and sauce. It was creamy, filling and tasted good. The filling was quiet good.
Mix veg pasta which was full of veggies and was served with red sauce. It was spicy and tangy.
Pocket pinch- for the area the prices were little on the higher side but given the quality and quantity the prices are justified.
Will visit this place again to try their shakes and non-veg items. Recommended!!!

A very interesting place to begin with, I kind of liked the road themed interior with all the street lamps and pavements.
The sitting is not comfortable though..
Service is good..
Now the most important thing, FOOD!!!
We ordered crispy pepper chicken, pan fried chicken, Hawaiian chicken salad, penne italiano, penne Alfredo.. And pinacolada and crazy 4 chocolate for 5 hungry people.
Crispy chicken was well cooked, properly seasoned, well spiced.
Pan fried chicken tasted usual, saucy..
Salad was really good, and well presented though I personally didn't like cucumber in it :P

Pastas were very good, though they served red sauce instead of Alfredo bt we didn't mind cause it tasted good. Well cooked, properly tasty gravy, good flavoured chicken , mushrooms... Yumm
Drinks were served innovatively in glass jars..
Pinacolada was okish.. So was the chocolate thing .
Place is really good for the price.. Good experience no doubt!
I would really love if they provide more choices for desserts..

It has become a common relaxation place for me, for the last 2 months. Things I like most about Foodpath are - it's cool interior (the name suggests itself) with colorful walls, good music, fast and friendly service and cheesy continental snacks. Till now, I've tried their cheese and egg sandwich (serves with a handful of potato chips), penne and spaghetti with meatballs. A real value for money. Good experience so far. Suitable place for two for having a good 'adda' over a cup of coffee and taking selfies together.

It is my first visit here, though it will  become a regular joint now. The ambience is as you call it 'pretty'. Colourful walls. Good music. And good food with great prices. We had ordered lasagne and chicken drumsticks. Both were pretty good, rather great keeping the prices in the picture. Lasagne had just lots of cheese. Just lots. 
All in all a very cosy and pretty regular food joint. I look forward to trying out the other dishes on the menu. 
If only you could just speed up the service, it would be great!

I have been longing to visit this place ever since I laid my eyes on it on my way back home from college. The brightly coloured quirky little joint that this is, it is sure to attract your attention. I visited it for the first time just two months back and it has become one of my favourite places to hang out. The food is pretty decent when it comes to both taste as well as quantity. The lasagna is what I tried on my very first visit, and the two of us could not finish half of it, pretty filling it is. And super yum.
The pasta, sundaes, momos, lassis are good enough. My personal favourite is Mochachillo. They have this really cute way of serving these in jars with lids and the lassis in "bhaars"... Pretty attractive :)
The place is not at all harsh on our pockets. None of our visits ever exceeded 200 bucks. The staff are pretty courteous too.
The ambience is pretty, and eye catching as mentioned earlier. Neat and tidy. Well maintained
Could use a little more work on the menu though. Probably the addition of nachos, more variations of pasta..momos should work just fine.
The only not-so-great thing I had was the Spaghetti with meatballs. The meatballs were dry and hard and the quantity was disappointing.
Overall a great experience, with good food and many fond memories. :)

Mushroom Maggi, Cheesy Chicken Pasta, Pasta Chicken Salad, Barbeque Chicken Sandwich, Chill-o-coffee, Moccachilo. 

All the above items have been completely devoured by me and I can vouch for my life that you couldn't have eaten the above mentioned dishes anywhere else better than what Foodpath serves you. A special mention for the Moccachilo. At a mere 89 rupees, with tax around 100, this is best chocolate syrup cold coffee you would ever drink. Much much better and much much cheaper than Barista, CCD or any expensive coffee place. This is my must goto place when I am in that area. 

Taste awesome, Neat and Tidy Place and Decent Pricing. This is surely one of the hidden gems of North Kolkata.

Trippy colours and great food - this is one good place to hangout.

I visited this place shortly after it reopened after renovation. The place was colourful and cozy at the same time. I ordered a Creamy Alfungi pasta and Cool Virgin Blue in drinks. The service was fast and the order arrived in around 10 minutes. The drink was Ok but the pasta was perfectly delicious. At such competitive prices this place gives a bang for the buck and I can't wait to try some more.

Cold coffe, cafe valentino are must.
Best place to hangout with buddys and close ones. Reasonably priced. Structured like a road with footpaths qt either sides where you hwve your food. Street lamps?, painted with vehicle cqrtoons.
The food tastes great. A must for foodies

Yup this place!! What is it There left to speak? Best place for a hangout With bud's. I'm always a bit low on cash but that's never the problem cause any dish of theirs is enough to fill up my tummy!! 
The decor is Good! The fake manholes and the retro street lamps give a touch of authenticity to the place.
The food choices Is large after they upgraded their menu. 
Here are a few favourites of mine which I Oder regularly-
Chicken coleslaw sandwich- this is a dish which works really during summer 
Chicken club sandwich- Oo three layers of awesomeness, Pan fried eggs then Chicken with A mayo Mix
And then Veggies :3(I hate veggies but I love this one tho :v) 
Chicken tikka kabab- can easily be someone's dinner. Cause they give a lot of food 
Drinks-Every damn one :3 
Strawberry blush, and Choco brownie shake is ❤ 
There you have it. :3
I kept it as short as I could but I can write on and on...
P.s- Ignore My grammatical mistakes please cause I read in an Bengali medium school thus not well acquainted with English :)

It is a cafeteria which will make you surprised as the ambience and interior is totally different from others. When you will enter, you will see a road and footpath. It will definitely make you feel that you are eating on the footpath. The prices of foods is pocket friendly. So go and feel a roadside ambience.

Yesterday i again went to dis place. It is a nice time passing place wid ur frnds n wooing partner ;) We ordered Spaghetti with Meat Balls and Creamy Alfungi(Mushroom). Our dishes were served widin 7-8 mins.  As usual the food was simply wow. But their AC was vry low so it was not completely comforting. Was feeling hot inside. One awkward situation was- we were clicking pix of each other n d man sitting on d next table of ours wid 2 gals(bahenjis) was clicking our pix. I had to stop dat mad fellow.

I went with my brother as he wanted me to.
I liked theme, a foot path.
The interiors were according to the theme, but not very particular.
The service was slow.
The only rating it gets is due to the food, it's pocket-friendly and the staff's behave well.
All over it was a good experience.

Foodpath, is really a 'kind' of restaurants for foodies like me. I really enjoyed Paneer stuffed panratha, a long before.
But now, stir fried sausages and Mushroom on toast tastes best among all.
Good place for eating. Need to extend their menu, still good in class.
And I love its decoration inside. 💯

Nice little joint to have pasta, fast food and snacks at sinthi area.

 This place is very close to my home and i really like the variety of pasta here. They offer beverages at reasonable prices. Fast food menu contains maggie/ wai wai with egg or chicken. All items taste good but their momos are priced high considering quality. Their fried chicken wings are awesome. Space is small, some 6 tables. They provide home delivery for orders beyond rs 250. One can also rent this place and throw birthday parties, they provide the birthday cake on the house. Unique eatery at sinthi area.

If you want to spend time with your friends in any evening of the week just go there have a drink or two ( NON-ALCOHOLIC ) and have some snacks. It'll be worth it.

Though it's so close to my home, I was completely unaware of its existence. Thanks to Zomato for letting me have this blissful experience. Very easy to locate, FoodPath has an awesome decor, though you might feel it to be a bit cramped. It resembles a road-side eatery with wooden seats arranged on both the sides of a path having artificial covered manholes and street lights. The wall paper shows cars passing by, giving the place a touch of uniqueness.  Coming to the food, I must say it is appetite booster. Loved every bit of the Creamy Chicken Alfredo, it was extremely delicious. The Momo Fifty-50 almost takes you to cloud nine and I bet you can never ever resist yourself from exclaiming with a WOW after every bite of it. Chicken Hawaian Pasta Salad  wasn't available so had to get plain Chicken Pasta Salad which is good too. And last but not the least is the Blueberry blast. It's so refreshing and pretty to look at :D 
Went hungry , left pleased. Foodpath, I'll be back again :D

What I give for the ambience, I take away for the food. The place is very small, warm, cozy and hangout -friendly. There's a casual theme going on with the decor and sitting which I like (and honestly pretty rare in NorKol). Kudos to the team for that. However, the food doesn't meet any expectations. The black coffee was bland, tastelessly put together, as was the sandwich and the caeser salad. The croutons were wimpy and the salad felt mushy and damp rather than fresh and cold. The serveware and cutlery are pretty low grade too. I suggest they amp up the place with a little decent sitting arrengement (in lieu of the rickety stools and the rocking tables) and improve on their utensils arrangement before improving the food though. Oh and I expect a decently brewed ground coffee, not some ₹10/- instant coffee water when I dine out.

This place is just about 5min walk from my home and i am a regular visitor here. Situated at sinthee more, foodpath is a small cafe(really small) serving some yummilicious food. Inspite of being tiny and small, the decor is quite interesting keeping with the theme and name of the restaurant. I really appreciate the way the management has designed the interiors according to the theme of the cafe(given the very little place of the joint). The food here is excellent. The pastas served here are delicious and the amount is substantial. My favourites are the  creamy chicken pasta and the pasta alfredo. Among the other dishes the sausages are a delight and the same goes for fish n chips. The fish n chips served with colslaw is  a must try. The club sandwich is my personal favourite. The bevarages served here are really good,my personal favourite being cafe valentino.The service of this place is quite quick and efficient, however the only glitch in the service is that everytime any dish has to be ordered one has to walk up all the way to the cash counter. This surely needs to be looked upon as it might sometimes become a bit irritating.But apart from this nothing negative comes to mind regarding this small cute cafe joint. The price of the dishes are reasonable and are in line with the quality of food served.I personally love  this place and would recommend it highly for 'pocket friendly plus delicious small bites  with friends'.....

Me and Sohan decided to celebrate his medical degree somewhere new... other than the CCD. Then I decided to try out this small  food joint. The menu card here is designed by a friend of friend, adding to some more interest to check it out. 
We asked the only person around I.e the cashier about their speciality. To my surprise he knew nothing of the food items. We ordered Spaghetti with meat balls, Chicken Wings with Pina Colada and Masala Soda.
The serving time is really terribly slow. The first order came to the table was spaghetti, and it was the best Spaghetti With Meat Balls I ever had ! Better than the Bon Appetite's. The chicken wings were average.
It's comparatively cheap and a nice place to hangout. I only wish it was Little more spacious.

This place leaves you in a dilemma, and a good sort of dilemma that is. You get the feel of roadside on the inside. And no I'm not trying to rhyme or anything! 
The place is well, 'road themed' and everything has a sense of coherence justifying the theme. From the street lanps to the mini man-holes made on the repurposed road which serves as the sort of walkway inside the restaurant. 

Coming to the food, ordered two things and it was enough to tell me that they don't take the quality or taste for granted just because they've got a fancy themed place. 
So Had Italiano pasta, a mixed sauce pasta, which was great tasting and well balanced as far as the two sauces are concerned. 
Next had the tandoori chicken maggi. Man was it good! Not a fan of maggi but will definitely have maggi whenever I'm here. I think that should tell you if its good or not. 
Also the place is very pocket friendly. So all in all, I left happy and also, my wallet. Cheers!

Well today I have visited Foodpath and I must say it's an awesome food joint in North Kolkata, It's clean, neat , It has a cozy ambience, decent service and pretty authentic Italian dish choices. It has this pavement (Footpath) type decoration all over which gives you a different experience and good selfies. Now talking about food, Chicken cheesy Pasta, Salads, Pan Fried momos are real best in class. Apart from that the drinks are also fabulous, specially Raw Mango ice tea just took my heart away. Now all these can come in real small and affordable price which I liked the most. So, If you are out with your friends and want to grab some fancy good foods with a pretty reasonable budget and put a cool check in in Facebook, you must visit here once.

It is one of those places where you can sit for hours and chat with your friends. 
It is a small cafe and is wonderfully designed with mini street lights, wall paints, etc.
We had ordered for a Cafe Valentino, cool virgin blue and pan fried chicken. The beverages were really nice. A lot of people may find the Cafe Valentino a tad too sweet... but it was made exactly the way I would like my coffee to be :)
Pan fried chicken was good, chicken pieces were really soft and juicy. 
It is really very reasonable … total VFM !! 
The place is really far... But I wouldn't mind travelling all the way back to try out their other dishes. :)

A cafe which has all the good qualities of a theme restaurant. It has a brilliant ambience which resembles the footpath of Kolkata well decorated with the street lamps and graphiti.  The food is of good quality and tastes good. One can try their mumbai styled Keema Paw, my favourite being their sandwiches. The cafe serves good food at par with any high priced restaurant in Kolkata but at much cheaper rate. 
Arijit has really created a beautiful place with a real Calcutta feel and serves mouth watering delicacies.

Visited this place several times. Its very near from sinthi more. One of my very near one introduced me to this place. At a glance the place looked nice. It has a different approach towards it decoration from the other restaurants. The decoration simply justifies its name. The ambiance is good. Its a perfect place to hang around with friends and have a chit-chat around with delicious snacks.  
Well now about the food. The foods are really good in here. When we reached there we ordered one cheesy pasta, one barbeque sandwich, one crispy pepper chickens, one chicken balls , two strawberry shakes. Every item was good. We wished our stomach would have a little bigger space so that we can order more. The taste is also very good, and the most comforting part is that the service is really fast. After ordering these items we got all of this in just 10-15 mins. That's what is most Admirable part of this place. Our total bill was around Rs.550 including taxes. Well though it posses many good quality but one thing really disappointed me and that is no card is accepted in here.....  I thought i would rate it more but that thing really demoralized. A place like this should avail this facility. Its one of the major drawback of this place.
But overall this place is real nice & if anybody gets an opportunity then he should utilize it properly......

This was my first visit to this small eatery though it was on my wishlist for quite sometime. We went in there on a rainy Sunday afternoon; as far as my first experience goes, it was just unexpectedly awesome! Here are my observations, first the Cons and then the Pros. Here you go -

CONS:

(a) Very soft paper glasses are provided for any sort of beverages, be it a shake or sweet lime soda. Also separate plates were not served for each person. When a dish comes to your table you have to eat it from that bowl or plate itself. For e.g. we ordered for stir fried chicken sausage. When the food came in we four had to eat from one single plate in which the food was served! Maybe this is good for college-goers or couples, but not for other sections of the population. Also regarding food - on that day, some basic items on menu were unavailable, like steamed chicken momo, etc. 

(b) We found that orders have to be given at the cash counter, there is no one to collect the order from your table.

(c) The place doesn't accept cards till date, only cash. This can be a pain at times.

(d) We found that only One person is managing the cash, taking orders at cash counter, serving food to all the tables, cleaning tables when required. One waiter can be added I guess. The place is getting good crowd, so this can be a food for thought for the owner.

PROS: 

(a) Nice location, easy to locate.

(b) Food tastes just great. We ordered for Stir fried sausage, pan fried chicken, creamy chicken alfredo, blueberry blast, sweet lime soda, chocolate sundaes - each and every item made our souls so deeply satisfied. Special mention - Stir fried sausage, pan fried chicken, blueberry blast were just a gastronomical delight! Even the creamy chicken alfredo tasted so right, just the way I like it. The Pan fried chicken was so tangy and delicious.

(c) The quantity served for each of these items were good enough. But on a lighter note - The blueberry blast can be served in a bigger glass I guess! Actually we (everyone) ended up ordering two glasses of the blueberry blast, it tastes so good and satisfying, it isn't very thick, so can very well quench your thirst.

(d) Quick service, we didn't have to wait for too long.

(e) Nice intelligent interiors. Just resembles a typical Kolkata footpath. With customized street lights, bright and well painted walls, everything is so close to reality. Also liked the low inexpensive sitting arrangements. Only bad thing is - at times you may feel a little cramped for space here.

(f) Very reasonably priced. So this place definitely has to be a crowd-puller.

To wrap up quickly - there are so many other exciting dishes to try out here, so I'm surely coming back! Cheers!

FoodPath is located in Sinthee r More.
Just an auto from station will take you 7 rs.
Its opposite to Bake Club.
Mostly the office goers comes there and youngsters to hangout.
About the place, it is like you're sitting on the foodpath .
There are lamp post and the wall also has wallpapers of cars .
It is a small place with great service and good food.
We had Cheesy Pasta which was really tasty and makes you're tummy fully.
We even had chocolate sundaes and Mango Sundae just at 70 rs.
It was just like another Bon Appetite .
The lassis were served in large earthen pots.
And if you're a solitaire card member of ABP you will get some offers out there.
So do check out this funky place soon.

Went there yesterday for d first time.. Thanx to zomato... After watching those luvly reviews i jst cudn't stop myself..
Althou i know abt Foodpath since a long time..but never been there!!
Me n my bff went there...had a great time!! Thank god it wasn't too crowded yesterday. I simply loved the decor..the concept of food(foot)path amazed me.
Food is excellent.. I wanted to have sooo many things but ended with pasta salad. I had to order veg pasta salad unfortunately chicken was not yet prepared. Along with that Cafe-Valentino..let me tell u guys it was really awesome. My bff ordered keema pav and crazzy 4 chocolates shake. We were happy to see that the food was served within 2-3mins. We ate slowly n chatted more.. As soon as we completed our food, we had to get up. But i wanted to stay a bit more So i ordered Cool Virgin Blue..(its a soda). We sat half an hour more. No1 disturbed us and we had a wide range of gossips n pnpc's ;). At last i took a parcel of chicken momo for my sister(she luvd it). It was a superb experience for me..i wished for a place where we can sit comfortably and chat for long n have good food. Foodpath fulfilled my wish. Thank you!!
My only recommendation would be please try to introduce brownies with ice creams. I would luv to see that in ur menu and pastries too like choco lava types. So that we get everything under a roof. Lots of love.

Searching for a place which provides both pocket friendly and super yum food? Foodpath is definitely one of them! The mushroom maggie loaded with oodles of cheese and mushrooms  is to die for and you get to choose from a wide range of yummy dishes like keema pav, chicken pasta salad, shakes etc. The food joint is based on an interesting theme and it intrigues us as much as the "Name" does! 
So i repeat,
"if your a big time foodie looking for some pocket friendly, totally filling, super yummy food visit  Foodpath." 

P.S (A word of advice for the management): You people should try and come up with other outlets across the city. The more the better. :D
Cheers! Keep coming up with more yummy dishes! ;) :D

Visited this place for dinner tonight and it was a nice little place with the theme of footpath and little decor was looking good as well. 
I ordered one chicken and cheese parantha and one Cream Chicken Alfredo. 
Chicken Alfredo was nice with white creamy look and the taste of pasta, white chicken, mushroom and butter altogether gave some good taste to the buds.
Chicken and cheese parantha was however normal and I think its price could have been more reasonable. 
But overall a 4 as food was nice and not very heavy on the pocket too.

I live in New Delhi. My hometown is in Kolkata & this place is very nearby my home in Kolkata. Although I visited this place for once. I must say the ambience is interesting for it's interior, but somehow I felt it clumsy.

As per the food & menu they need to improve a lot... I can't rate this place more than 1 but for it's interior & home delivery option I will add 1 more...

Okay! First time I got 2 knw about Foodpath in an office party... where I madly fell for the food...so much so that I travelled from South to North just to savor the food all over again.
But this time what came as a bonus cookie was the place itself, I actually got to closely feel n observe what exactly the concept of Foodpath is.
It's a cozy nook dimly lit almost like the street lamps. The traffic wall graffiti and the floor  replicating footpath does perfect justice to the name of the outlet!
Oh yes... I loved the music... A soothing soundtrack  collection!! 

Now coming down to the food...just one word...  AWESOME!!
As  I mentioned earlier U vl simply love the food here... the  'stir fried sausage '... it's tangy and yum!
They have the best range of lip smacking pastas topping their speciality chart which comes at a very low price.
Pasta Alfredo, Cheesy Chicken Pasta, and Creamy Chicken Pasta Alfredo are a MUST TRY.... Being a pasta lover I heart their quality. ♥
All in all Foodpath will give a pleasant experience under its street food ambience,  with impressive food n drinks.
Gonna drop in very soon!!! :D

I loved Foodpath!!! The ambience is very interesting which gives a street feel where you can sit & have an adda session with friends. I loved the food here. From the sausage fries to the keema pav and the cheese pasta everything was delicious! I loved the blue berry shake... it's yummmmm!!! I also liked the way they serve the lassi in typical earthen cups called Bhaar in bengali. It is the place to visit in north Kolkata if you are a foodie and want to try out some innovative and tasty dishes.

Hmm..writing my first review in zomato and thatz fr 'Foodpath'...this can easily depict how much I am in love wd ds plc!!
Situated in a prime location like sinthimore and being d only decent cafe in that area, itz a crowdpuller!!!! Now it's time to share my stint with this place which has started 3 yrs ago..I used to be an engineering student,thrice a week had tuitions near this food joint...and now whenever am in kolkata, try to visit this place once!!!
Now my fav fillers from their list:
1)chicken club sandwich:A total hats off to this dish...n my staple food at 'Foodpath'....so yummylicious!! A generous filling of minced chicken with mayo, slices of cucumber n tomato and a poached egg...n they garnish the dish with potato wafers....a must try
2) Grilled chicken sandwich:filled with juicy chicken pieces, it is also good.But last time they served it over grilled, so I felt they need to take care of that.
3) Chicken cocktail sandwich:Once again a very filling and tasty dish, with loads of veggies , minced chicken and mayo.But I personally feel that they fill it with excessive veg coleslaw salad in comparison to hhe chicken.
4) Keema pav:An awesome dish!!! Foodpath's brainchild, a dish with perfectly blend with spices and garnished with lemon and chilly..gives u a desi tadka...a must try for a taste change!!!
5) Chicken pasta salad:Again a tasty and healthy dish...but with loads of veggies and less chicken(as per my taste)..served with potato wafers.A must try..
6) Cheese mushroom pasta:Perfect taste with loads of cheese snd mushroom....a dish on which I drool over....
In beverages genre, my choices are-cola cocktail, Masala cold drinks, blueberry crush and strawberry shake. I bet they won't disappoint u ever..
Ambiance and decor is good...but itz a problem with the sitting arrangement and space...only three pairs of couple seating arrangement ..if they are filled , u have to share ur seat with others..but the cafe owner and the staffs are always there to help you in a smiling face...price is also very pocket friendly ..overall rating 4 frm my side.
P.S.:I love their chicken momo too...
Best wishes..keep it up 'Foodpath':)
29th Sept, 2014:-one more review for ma fav joint n dis tym fr much awaited dish, stir fried sausage,which has created a stir amongst itz fans.n yes, I am no different. ...fried with cheese n flavoured with black pepper,alongwih crunchy diced capsicum and onion. Itz very filling and tasty!!!!!

Chicken Sausages were simply WOW. Its so delicious. The Mayo dip provided with the sausages simply added to the flavors of the food. Just loved it.  We took the Chicken Club Sandwich and OMG, that was a huge sandwich and tasted too good. The ingredients were awesome with fried eggs in the middle of the three layer sandwich with coleslaw mixed with chicken and mayonnaise in the other half. Another thumbs up for this item. And the Cheezy chicken pasta was an additional treat to us with Mango Lassi to end with. Surely gonna visit again and again for the SAUSAGE and PASTA. SIMPLY AWESOME

It's been raining since the last few days, so I was delaying my visit to this place, but finally today I made a decision and went to visit the much talked about FoodPath. The place existed so nearby and I missed it the whole time.. decor looks great, I must say we north kolkatans needed this kind of creativity. The guy at the order table was great, I had seen mentions of chicken sausage so ordered that and he suggested crispy chicken strips since keema paw was sold out. Also added a cool virgin blue and green apple soda. The food was fantastic and I was just overwhelmed with the quality of the drinks.. they surely will give some biggies a run for their money. Will surely drop in regularly.
They should just fix the door.

I started having snacks at this place since it sold milli's momo.. First of all I would like to congratulate as well as thank the owner at the same for opening such a worthy place for hangout near sinthee more where your choices are a few. Now about the food. I have tasted almost half of the items. The best thing about them is the stir-fried chicken sausages.. the sausages they serve are very fragile, tender and juicy.. talking about italian dishes like pasta, they are quite good at it.. but what they do is add a lot of white sauce in it.. otherwise its cool.. the chicken club foodpath, now I havent tasted it as a whole but took 1 bite from my friend. Its jaw dropping. Usually u dont expect these typ of sandwiches near areas like sinthee more and dunlop... I would suggest the cold coffee as your beverage.. dont go for the mocktails. Its not worth it.

My favourite place for adda and gorging over food this is my favourite restaurant...i love this place..but today when i went there with AK was wondering whether we will get a seat or not i gave a thought that the management people should now think of a bigger space for foodpath as it has become a very favourite joint of the youngsters in the locality...

i again ordered my fav stir fried chicken sauasage ,and a chicken club sandwich...their sausage i love and as i was extremely hungry i ate a sandwich from AK and dint let him eat..:p

I am a fan of their every item and they make it extremely well and satisfies my hunger..and am sure more reviews for this place will be coming from me and am loving it..:p

----- 25 Mar, 2014 -----

i really like this place a lot being a great adda place near my house and it offers some awesomeeee food and shakes..today i was extremely hungry and i literally dragged AK into foodpath to treat myself with some great stuff...i am a fan of their momos,shakes,pastas ..and their interior is so beautifully decorated that it gives u a feeling of having food sitting in the footpath..:-)
i have become crazy about their recently introduced chicken sausage which they called "stir fried chicken sausage"...they prepare it beautifully with capsicum and onion and provide a small amount of mayonnaise which makes it moreeeeeeeeeeee awesome to gorge on...i ordered a plate of momo also as it has rained today they served it hot and the soup tasted heavenly,i love to have momos on a rainy day...and took their cola cocktail as a drink...every dish and the drinks were superb and i am in love with it..
being juz steps away from my house i wish they try on more new items and this will become a great success and a cooler place for the young generation..:)

_9th april 2014-
One of the most visited place by me with AK..today also we while passing from foodpath dropped in here...it had a great ambience with lots of people coming in and gorging on food..

today we ordered for bar-b-que chicken sandwich,chocolate shake,mango mastani shake,crunchy pepper chicken strips...omg for the first tym tasted their crunchy pepper chicken strips it is awesomeeeeeeeeeeee i loved it some beautifull delicacies and tastes added to it..bar-b-que chicken is just as good as it used to be...and the one thing which has mesmerised me is their mango shake it is toooooooooooooo good and tasty and would juz refresh u in this summer...highly recommended !!

management people are very nice and this place is very much pocket friendly which just makes ur day..i will be visiting this place again and again coz this is the nearest place to treat urself with some great shakes and delicacies..:)

Stir Fried Chicken Sausage will make me visit this place fortnighly :P

*Location - Located at a prime location of Sinthi More. It experiences lots of public especially during the evening including all age groups.

*Brief - Today visited the place again to try their Chicken Sausages :D Yes I already tasted a Cutlet from Campari but when I am hungry "toh mein aapne aapki bhi nahi sunta" :D

*Ambience/Decor - Awesome ambience(see pictures attached) and the servers are very courteous. They have a prepaid system.
Though they are a small outlet and I wish they had a larger place.

*Things ordered - Stir Fried Chicken Sausage.
I had sausage at Kafe Bindass(Golpark) during their prime form, but unfortunately they closed down. But FOODPATH people added Sausage in their menu and made me SUPER HAPPY :D
The sausage looks super delicious(see pic) and tastes marvellous as well. They provide a dip and the combo is heavenly.

*Purse Check - It costs Rs. 100/- (inclusive of taxes). Friendly to pocket rates they have got. Awesome :D

*Overall - You guys are always special with your super food and super behaviour. But today I overheard a couple while they ordered Pasta Alfredo, the server said they dont have mushrooms and they had to change their order. Please its a request that you guys take care of these things in future.

Recommended to all :D
Going to visit again soon :)

----- 05 Mar, 2014 -----

Foodpath, located at Sinthi More, is always a delightful place to visit :)
I personally honour you guys as the best Cafe of this region.

The decor is delightfully nice and really gives you the impression of "Foot(d)path". The order is prepaid.

Just had a visit there tonight and I can just say one word about my experience "INCREDIBLE" !!
I ordered Chicken Alfredo Pasta for myself and my friend ordered Chicken Sausage. The manager suggested me to try their shakes and so I ordered one Choco Shake and a Blueberry Crust. The order came pretty quick.
Now the alfredo pasta has been tasted by me earlier and it tasted as juicy and spicy as ever with adequate chicken. But the Chicken sausage was a real treat. I never thought we would have chicken sausages here and this new entry is surely gonna steal the show for them. It was so nicely cooked and with some nicely prepared veggies. They also provided a small bowl of mayo sauce (great thinking). It was so tasty that I finished the bowl of mayo sauce myself :D
The shakes were really nice and was not icy cool. Just the proper one indeed. But if the shakes were provided in table glasses it would have made a huge difference. Do think about it :)

Really had an awesome time there and I saw a bunch of people from different age groups having a gala time there.
Its really one of my best experiences. Strongly recommended and I am giving it a 5 pointer now.
Enjoy :)

Just a note to the management, guys I think you should try adding chicken shawarma wraps and salads to your menus. Its high time Baranagarians should taste some Lebanese. Its kind of a appeal from me, and you have got some real good cooks, so do think about my suggestion. :D

----- 27 Nov, 2013 -----

Just love the food here. The pastas and the sandwiches are just superb. Also some of the new items of mushroom and chicken are yum!! Prices are also very reasonable. An excellent place to hangout with friends or with ur special one!

First of all, it is a very small place, and the seating arrangements is somewhat very clumsy! 
But the food covered all its flaws!!
We ordered :
Chicken pasta salad
Cafe valentino
Chicken momo (steamed). 
The cafe valentino had a good taste. It was not sweet. And that's how coffee should be made.
Chicken pasta salad was delicious. Well prepared along with good flavours.
The  chicken momo was wholesome. Properly cooked (though I missed the soup thingy!!).
The service is good.
They just need to increase the space. That's it!!
I would like to visit this place again (very soon) :)

Food path is a awsum place . The most cheapest place till date but you will have the best out of it. The coffee, club sandwitch, grilled sandwich, pasta, momo, kebab sandwich are my favourites. Only the place is small but you will njoy the delicacies..... Couples are mostly atracted to this palce. Home delivery is also available.

I feel sorry that I never gave this place a chance even when I live so near. This place is a gem in this deserted place.
The food is really good. Getting into the details.

Firstly :

The space is small and cramped and had a weird stench for which I had subtracted a point. It can roughly fit fifteen people.
So, you get the space crunch. But yes it had nice and quirky interiors but is slightly shady. The place would look much better with more lights :)
The management should look into the matter of space crunch. Because you cannot sit in a cramped space, with a foul stench and have your food. That is horrendous.
But trust me, the food makes up for it.
I literally had a HUGE gastronomic experience here.

Friend and I, both hungry and frustrated with work came down for a good food doldrum.

We ordered : 

Cafe Valentino
Cheesy Chicken Pasta
Egg and cheese sandwich
Keema Pav
Crunchy chicken strips

The food was really good. The Cafe Valentino is more like Cafe Mocha with chocolate vermicelli sprinkled on top. Very tasty and thick. I liked it.

The showstopper was the Keema Pav. My goodness it was awfully good. Very delicious and spicy and tangy and just perfect. Reminded me of Juhu Beach :D
The chicken strips were an absolute delight. Very nicely friend and served warm, they tasted delicious. They were pretty spicy too.
The sandwich was cheesy and they also served wafers with it.
And lastly the pasta. It was all cheesy and has a good portion of shredded chicken and pasta which was of a  penne and spiral nature. I loved it.

We had ordered so much that we almost burst out after our gigantic meal :P
People at other tables gave us weird stares. But I couldn't care less :D

Billed at INR 441/- , I was pleased to eat here and spend a lovely evening.

Coming back for more, very very soon.

Cheers! :)

Visited it with a colleague in order to introduce her with this great junction of pastas and more. Felt delighted to taste the Cheesy Chicken Pasta. It was awsome in taste! But the Cafe Valentino was expected to be better. Overall Foodpath is just an outstanding food point with a feel of sitting on footpath and tasting delicious momos and pastas.

Foodpath was the only reason of travelling from Tollygunge to Sinthee More and back, and because Zomato gave vouchers for the same. First of all, not being accustomed about the place made it quite difficult to reach it and I was pretty surprised to find it tucked away almost in a corner at the more. On entering the place, I noticed a funny stench which my friend said was in my mind, but I am quite sure of my nose because the managers at the counter kept room-spraying from time to time. So considering the inconvenience of location, extremely small size and the stench, I would rate them a 2.5 to 3.0.

Now, if I was someone living in the area, the place probably would be one of the cool things in vogue. Because of the lack of any cafeterias around, Foodpath is a relief for the young and old alike. The ambience is nothing extraordinary but the paintings on the wall could have been showcased better with brighter lights. A very casual vibe as soon as you enter the cafeteria, the mix of old and remix music over plates of food is bound to keep one busy and happy. The fact that it was crowded, full and catered to celebrities ensured its popularity.

Our orders - crispy fried chicken sausage, chicken caesar salad, blueberry shake, cafe valentino, strawberry lassi, keema pav and creamy chicken alfredo. The amount for each is sufficient for one person and the quality extremely fresh. Every food was cooked with care and tasted good. The shakes and coffee were awesome and in quite sometime I haven't had such thick flavour shakes and lassi. The coffee was frothy and generously full of choco chips and hot chocolate. The sausages were fried light and sprinkled with oregano and pepper flakes, the caesar salad had a lovely light dressing which surprised me pleasantly and had decent portions of chicken in it. The chicken for the salad was fried light and tasted pretty interesting, a nice take on a caesar salad basically. The pasta was generously cheesy and full of chicken and mushrooms, but the showstopper of the day has to be the keema pav. The keema pav is so, so GOOD. I will absolutely suggest having this here and not bothering with anything else if one is sufficiently hungry. The pav and the keema curry with onion, rock salt, chilli and lemon taste absolutely delicious. An absolutely hearty 4 for just the food.

Foodpath will open its new franchisee shortly in Salt Lake. I will wait till then and dream about only and only the keema pav.

Got to know of this gem of a place after receiving a food voucher from Zomato. True I had to travel all the way to Sinthi but the food made the journey worthwhile.
Foodpath is extremely tiny and seats only about 20 odd people. True to its name its interiors give you the feel of sitting on a footpath as you have your meal. They even have streetlamps glowing down! Really fun interiors!
The menu is not elaborate but is adequate. We tried the following...
The chicken pasta salad was really good. There was a very wise use of sour cream which added a wonderful zing to the dish. One of the best cold dishes I have tasted in a long time.
Next up we had the cheezy chicken pasta. It was really cheezy and nice and warm and oh sooo good! A big thumbs up for this one too!
We also had the creamy chicken Alfredo which was similar to the cheezy pasta with the exception of mushrooms being added to this dish.
We also had cafe Valentino and crispy chilli baby corn (the day's special). The Cafe was nice and smooth with a very detectable aroma of coffee but lacked the punch in there not being enough chocolate chips added to it. 
The only disappointment was the crispy chilli baby corn. It was soggy and pretty bland. We were also disappointed to know that most of the coolers were unavailable..
The pricing of all dishes are absolutely spot on making this an excellent hangout zone! I loved it and I am sure you will too.

P.S. They are opening a branch at Salt Lake shortly.

A small and youthful place which serves pretty tasty food ! There's not a lot of options for eating out around this area and as my University was located nearby, have been to this place quite a few times. Although I admit, Bake club (situated just opposite to Foodpath) used to be a more popular choice for grabbing a quick bite between classes ! But yes...at this place we could have a much better adda.....And take in the details of the quirky decor ! :) Coming to the food, they serve a bit of everything....The Sandwiches are good, according to my friends. The Chicken Momo tasted really nice but the momo sauce accompanying it was not that great ! What I liked more were the pastas....have tried the Pasta Italiano and Cheeszy Chicken Pasta....both are good enough. What I really loved was the Chicken Pasta Salad. Served with chips, this dish was actually delicious ! So yes, for me this place holds good food and great memories. :) 3.5 stars from me.

This place is near to where I live and I think this is the only restaurant in the vicinity to serve pasta and sandwiches, the food is good and the menu is also too good, specially with so great variety of sandwiches available there you will never ever get bored of visiting this place, the staff is good. the home delivery service is good. This place also serves awesome pasta and salads which is worth trying. The price is quite reasonable as I think you wont get pasta or proper sandwiches at the price that they offer and at the same time their marketing strategy is also unconventional which attracts me more. This is one good food joint that will surely grow to great lengths.

I ordered some pasta and shake at near about 3pm in the afternoon. It was a home delivery, they said your food will be at your doorstep within half an hour( the place is not much far from my home, it just 10 mins walking).. till 5 pm they go on saying our men is out with your food, and after half an hour when i called them again they said "mam your food has been delivered" , but i didn't received my order. Shit man they are useless, and the customer services is worse..

A small restaurent in a little known lane of North Kolkata, but not small in terms of food, taste and ambience.
An amazing concept restaurent, serving sandwiches, pastas, tea, coffee, paranthas, etc. Not for those looking for a heavy full-course meal; only for those looking a quick munch. 
Awesome taste, particularly the Hawaiian Salad, Keema Pav, Chicken Sandwich.
Recommended for a quick bite.

A small restaurant (or cafe) close to home with nice decor & decent food. I like their new menu & vastly improved food. So, I'm upgrading my rating & changing my earlier review. Sadly, all the items on the menu are not always available neither is their home delivery service. However, the service is earnest. Try the Chelo Kebab; they, surprisingly, do an excellent job in preparing this famous dish.

Not at all good...its too costly compared to the quality of food they serve. I think they were better when they used to sell momo....they even have increased the cost of momo for which they were famous about. 
Sorry dude..need some more innovations on the food you offer rather innovative decorations

I ordered some pasta and shake at near about 3pm in the afternoon. It was a home delivery, they said your food will be at your doorstep within half an hour( the place is not much far from my home, it just 10 mins walking).. till 5 pm they go on saying our men is out with your food, and after half an hour when i called them again they said "mam your food has been delivered" , but i didn't received my order. Shit man they are useless, and the customer services is worse..

A small restaurent in a little known lane of North Kolkata, but not small in terms of food, taste and ambience.
An amazing concept restaurent, serving sandwiches, pastas, tea, coffee, paranthas, etc. Not for those looking for a heavy full-course meal; only for those looking a quick munch. 
Awesome taste, particularly the Hawaiian Salad, Keema Pav, Chicken Sandwich.
Recommended for a quick bite.

near much home I found this restaurant which was just a momo seller before few days ..the momo was good and so they thought of converting it in a restaurant...using publicity from snapdeal and internet media ...food is very average and price is too not reasonable for auch a quality...they need to qork hard n bear loses first...3 star foe this

I know this place for quite some time now (since its inception)as I stay in Dumdum area,where finding good eateries is a distant dream...!

Food path is like a pool in this desert now..the young boys who took the challenge of offering us innovated versions of our well known maggi.

The ambience is perfect and the food is absolutely delighting.the bar b que sandwich,tandoor maggi ,lassi are some of my favourites here.

The only negative point I can think of is its small space,as its located in the sinthee more area..
But the food very well makes up for this .

Ok,i went here when i was starving while returning from the market , the place is small but with a decent crowd.
Food i must tell you is delicious as compared to the prices. Try the egg pizza for the evening breakfast and keema pav with green tea if confused what to order
The decoration is very attractive specially the way the tiles have been arranged look like a footpath . But a hygenic one

I went to Food Path....a small restaurant brilliantly painted along with pavement-like floors and looks....very exciting to eyes. Located at the most divine of the places, gathers huge amount of crowd during the late afternoon. The interior is decorated so well that the name fits just right. A little more music and a little more illumination makes the place really happening. Despite being a small place to look around, it is well maintained.

This food joint mostly offers fast food.....and much like evening snacks...it has fair bit of tasty Italian dishes as well as Chinese and Indian counterparts....I tasted Chicken Bar-B-Q Sandwich, Asian Chicken Sandwich, A three-layer Chicken Club Foodpath & Fried Momo. The Sandies are worth to eat, very delicious and praiseworthy and has enough variety to make you yum more. But.....but it burnt a hole in my pocket...yes, the prices are too costly against the food content they serve...it should be just a little low, so that the main segment....the college-goers, gets attracted.

The servers are good and help you with what they have to offer. And also.... Please, allow cards users to pay in credit. Install devices.
