What review can you give when the basic essential ingredient is missing from most of the dishes that you order. The food was screaming for SALT. I guess the rumours about reduced stocks of salt in many parts of the country have hit them hard and they have taken these rumours seriously. The Soup was good, Diced Chicken in Chilli Soy Sauce was good too. Leaving these aside, the rest of the order was in shambles....literally. Had great expectations from them after reading the many good reviews here....but my review is different to them all. Having a great menu speaking of "tossed with this" and "flavoured with that" won't help until one gets basics correct. This might have been a one off occasion.....so definitely I am going to try this place again. But the bottom line is that they need to pull up their socks.
