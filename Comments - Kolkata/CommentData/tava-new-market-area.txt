Sometimes something surprises when not expected. This place is one of them. They have little varieties in the menus ( both food and bar) , but they have a quite good ambiance. Among the bars in these are I thing it can be listed as a quick visit spot.

The variety of food items n drinks is not so good, infact it is poor. That must have been noted. Smoking place should have been a bit well constructed as it's very hard to have a smoke on the open place when it's raining :/ :/
Sorry but these must have been taken care of.

If you are going there I would rather suggest you to go yo the new empire bar its value for money. The service staff doesnot bother once you have placed the order you have to wait for 15 - 20 mins to get your order only drinks will be served quickly except that uou gotta wait wait n wait... food is overpriced a bowl of pineapple cheese cherry will cost you aporox 250/-, ambeince is not worth the money you pay .

Drinks were overpriced & limited variety, service inferior & no enjoyable ambiance. We went there to have some drink before dinner. Our experience was horrible, they took 30 min for serving 'Chicken Pokora'. By that time we already finished our drinks. I ordered 'Fresh Lime Soda' after 2 round of drinks and again I have to wait for 10-15 min for my Fresh Lime Soda. Crowd was pathetic as well as servers.  Please try to avoid this place.

Never come with your family or your girlfriend here. The crowd is pathetic and the behaviour of the staffs is just like a ticket blacker standing outside a cinema hall. They don't hesitate to argue with you if you complain about any service.

A very very average place . ambiance is nil  . 100 pipers which costs rs 180 else where  costs here rs 240/ 60  ml peg  .  considering  the  ambiance  these  place  should  be  last  on  your  priority  list  .  if  you  are  from  the  locality  then  better  go  to  NEW  EMPIRE  bAR  .  avoid  this  place  if  you  have  some self  worth  left  .  food  is  nothing  special  .  i  am talking  about  TAVA BAR  &  Not hotel  shalimar  which is otherwise very good  . located near Regal cinema  this place is best reserved for  old  tipplers  & for  local people. EVEN  ANTIQUITY bLUE which costs Rs  145/ 60 ml peg elsewhere costs  here Rs 170 ++ / 60 ml peg  .  my verdict is go a your own risk & don't tell me later  that i didn't tell you .  A dinner / lunch for two here would cost RS 900 for  TWO  to be more realistic  .
