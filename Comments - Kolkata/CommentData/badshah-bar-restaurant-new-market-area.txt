Went there on new year's eve with friends after hearing good reviews of its kebab rolls. The ambience is ok given the age of the restaurant. But it does not go with the pricing if we compare with the quantity given. 3 of us ordered egg chicken reshmi kebab rolls and one friend ordered biryani because he was hungry. The rolls were very good and the kebabs inside were juicy but were too small given the 90 bucks each we gave for the roll. The quantity of biryani was also very small. And quality was ok. The waiters were good according to me unlike some reviews I read.

Well one of the oldest restaurant in the region.. and the first creators of kathi roll!! still serving the the best of them.... its not possible to provide the best of ambience by this old one but they really serve finger licking good food.and provide a cheap bar along side but only if you let go of the ambience and service...

I went there few days back , but I was in a hurry so I only had the chance to taste the chicken egg roll, which was quite delicious and I personally loved it ! It's a good treat for ur tummy while you are quite hungry but you don't have enough time to sit and have something on a main course .

Located in new market area.. Just beside shreeleathers.. Decor is very basic, nothing much to describe.. Service was a bit slow..
I ordered chicken pakora, mixed fried rice, chilli chicken.. All of these were really disappointing..
¤ Chicken pakora- (2.5/5)small pieces of chicken coated with thick layer of conflour.. Worst one..

¤ mixed fried rice-(1/5) another disaster.. Omg.. It was too much oily nd spicy.. Rice was not properly cooked even..

¤ chilli chicken -(3.5/5) it was not bad.. Okay type..

Pocket pinch is not high.. bt worst food quality, completely waste of money.. 😣

Dire need of improvements required from the infrastructural sides. But the food quality still remains great. The rolls are favourites here. You can have a quick bite standing on the foyer of the restaurant, which is down stairs, about 5-6 steps downwards. So no wheelchair access per se. The rolls are brilliant. Definitely try them.

Worst place to grab. Drink or Eat!!
On the platter:Chicken rashmi roll,Chicken gravy noodles and Chilli chicken gravy.
This place has no pros.
Cons:Over hyped price,the roll was average but a little roll costed Rs90!!!
Noodle was bad and was having pungent odour probably due to the cornflour and worst is I found elaichi in my gravy.Chilli chicken was still digestable.
Proceed to the outlet only if u want to grab a beer while shopping around simpark mall!!

Service is a bit slow but food ain't  that bad for the price. I liked their Malai kofta curry, Lassi & fish tikka. No idea about their bar section as we only went there to have our lunch on a sweaty afternoon. They need to pay more attention towards hyegine. Dirty chair covers are a huge 'no-no' if there's any at all. That's the problem with many of older Kolkata restaurants. Most of them hardly think of a renovations or two. Go there if you're really hungry after a tiring shopping session & street food isn't something you're counting on.

Certainly one of the most underrated bar cum restaurants in Kolkata. Unlikely a few other reputed bars, this place serves no nonsense chilled strong beer. The seats are not comfortable but if you happen to be an admirer of Vintage New Market and the area nearby, this place will take you down the memory lane. The food is pretty good especially their fish and chips is one of the best in Kolkata. Go to Badshah, grab a bottle of beer, fish and chips and spend the time of your lives. P. S- This is not recommended for TGI and Irish House fanboys.

On a sweaty afternoon after hopping around the new market, two of us decided to went there. Took a seat at the bar section upstairs...which was a little shady. Apart from the ambience the food we had was okewise and pint of beer costs just about the market price. We ordered fish finger with veg hakka chowmin & Taiwan chicken. Fish finger was good but the chinese foods was average. If you went there for drinks i would recommend to have it with the snacks items. It's a pocket friendly place but do not except much from about the decor and environment.

I visited this restaurant twice, both being reunions – lunches with school friends and their families. On both these occasions, we opted for North Indian cuisine.....tandoori roti, naan, kebabs and chicken dishes. The food was okay.....no complaints from my end. My friends who were from outside West Bengal also seemed to concur. I only wish they had improved the interiors.

Went here for the first time. Ground floor is the normal restaurant. And 1st floor is the bar. A moderate size place with moderate ambience. Good place to booze with friends in a pocket friendly manner. 
We ordered vodka and beer. Alcohols are very cheap compare to other bars. And we also ordered paneer pakora. But that was not that tasty coz the paneer was plain with no Masala and even salt.
So thus I give 3.5 and would a suggest the viewers a visit to this place.

Feedback about Baadshah hotel and restaurant in new market kolkata. Firstly the service was very bad the waiter just threw the menu card on the table, then after several reminders to the waiter he served water where the glasses were smelling like shit. Also when we ordered kebabs to the person-in-charge he suggested to take chicken basket, we asked the price of the item and he said it's ₹200 only and we agreed to take it. Once we ordered the bill we were shocked to see that the item costs ₹300 instead of ₹200. We wanted to check the price with the person who took the order but the manager of the restaurant said he has left for the day and when we wanted to check the price in the menu card they said that it's a new item and not mentioned on the menu card. After a several quarrels the person whom we placed the order came and started shouting that he has said the price to be ₹300 and also mentioned that we had intention problems of not paying the same.

I would never visit the restaurant again and will never ask anyone to visit it for such poor service and such inhumane behaviour of the staff.

The food quality is also not at all up to the mark.

Kindly do not visit this restaurant ever. It's my suggestion to u all.

This place is located in Esplanade beside Sree leathers. It's always crowded in here. The restaurant looks pretty basic nothing fancy. But the food in here is something which is really good.

 I ordered Chicken Biriyani, Butter Chicken with Tandoori Roti and Coffee. Biriyani was good but I feel the quantity was less. The chicken tasted fine it was tender and juicy. But coffee tasted the best. And the service was prompt.

A late update though.I along with 2 of my friends went there while it was raining cats and dogs outside on the 4th of july.Located in New Market this restaurant can be easily identified.The interiors are well crafted accompanied by some quick service from the waiter's.I ordered chicken dopiyaza with tandoori roti while both my friends settle down for ice cream shake and totti fruti.The chicken was soft and juicy from inside.The ice cream shake could have been better but the totti fruiti was fantastic.

This restaurant is located in the new market area in kolkata which is a very busy and popular place for shopping. These area is really famous for cheap stuff. So when I say cheap stuff , I also mean food .. this specific restaurant is my favourite... and this restaurant is set up in a very cramp place .. no ambience, no looks nothing .. but the place is air conditioned . Now this is really required as kolkata is known for its hot and humid climate... food peddler coming to this food juncture can be guaranteed of a cool sitting. Directly coming to food , this place serves cheap and yummy food unless one is counting on calories. Now food arrival time is pretty quick inspire of it being fully packed up . Popular dish of this place chicken fried rice and sezwan chicken. As far as my palate is concerned food is tasty and easy to grab on types ... one can't count on the authenticity of the dishes ... I liked the place sometimes desi food is required to get a change in our life and it's pretty pocket friendly ... specially when u want to shop more... so my review is for Those shopaholics who wanna rest their feet and tummy after lots of shopping....full desi khanna, and one should not forget to try the tutty fruity after the meal as desert . Hopefully I made a justice to my followers......

Went to this small restaurant in Lindsay Street with my friends to taste their rolls. The rolls tasted great, they were small in size, slim, succulent and delicious! The chicken was soft as well. One roll is surely not enough to fill your stomach though it is great for snacks. Their service is bit late and the ambiance make that annoying. Overall, this place is OK to hangout with friends if you have a tight budget.

Worst ever experience... The food was really bad. We ordered fish finger, biryani, chicken bharta, chicken chilli dry and chicken egg roll
The fish finger didn't had any pinch of salt in its stuffing. Also the waiter was not ready to hear our problems. He tells that we have to prepare food according to the drunkers as they would required less salt. The biryani and bharta were ok but still shocked to see the depreciation of the quantity of food given. The roll was very bad as it is famous for its roll... Highly dissapointed

Nicely located near new market which is a respite for shoppers. The best thing in this place is that u can sit inside the A.C restaurant with just a cold drink and a chicken roll. I personally dont like their rolls because of their tiny size but their chicken cutlet and fish fingers are too good. Have visited their bar upstairs onve which serve alcohol for a very reasonable price. Overall a nice place to relax after a hectic shopping experience.

This is a very old restaurant and I've been here countless times.....But that was in the days long gone by... in those days shopping meant being in new market.... Infact New Market and Shopping was synonymous. But that time is no more....With do many glitzy malls in the city new market is not the sole option anymore. Moreover earlier eating joints too were limited while now they are proliferating everywhere. So though I've been here countless times that was long ago. Even earlier the ambience was nothing great and now too it's quite downmarket. But the food was generally good. Now standards have further deteriorated, this place mainly runs because of the location and because it's economical. I had chance to have egg roll recently and I will rate it as an average roll.

Chilli fish was really good (they really know how to get the Chinese right). Fish fry & fish sticks were really delicious, kind of new taste for me with mustard oil but really loved them.

Biriyani is sweeter thn normal Kolkata biriyani and the egg white of chicken bharta is totally black. 1st time I see the black egg white. I upload the pics. People are over confident about their work, so u have to order quickly after getting the seat. Previously when we visited this place we liked bt this time we r sad for you guys.

Situated on the Ground Floor of 5 Lindsay Street, in Esplanade, Near Globe Cinema this quaint restaurant can be undoubtedly called the Kings of Rolls in Calcutta. Located in the crowded footpath of New Market Area you are bound to give it a miss if you are not a true fan of Badshah. As for me they would always remain the quintessential place to savor a kathi roll. 

It's even better than the legendary Nizam's which, sadly, has slipped quiet a notch in quality. Nizam’s were the first to introduce the Rolls in Calcutta or perhaps India. The best part of the Badshah roll is that they don't put any sauce in it. Instead you get a crispy, lightly fried paratha, with proper chicken or mutton kebabs in it. Remember to ask for an extra squeeze of lime and voila you are ‘In’ for a treat of your lifetime. I have visited this place many a times in the 25 long years that I have spent in Calcutta. A must visit for every foodie.

I am writing this review totally based on the second floor of the restaurant, where they serve alcohol. The staircase is not inviting at all leading to the sitting area. 
The place is dark, with literally dirty tables and not so comfortable sitting arrangements. Servers being non professional and over friendly. Also the food was very bad, we had taiwan chicken with couple of beers and it was like having beer with dessert, its that sweet. And when complained they were arguing that its how it supposed to be, they had complaints from other tables too regarding overly salted chicken. 
Maybe, the restaurant section is good(as i never tried food there), but i am not ever going back there for drinking with my friends.

Have been eating rolls from here maybe since decades now. Always done a takeaway. They still have the least oily and light thin paratha compared to all others who have super thick and hard ones. The chicken inside the rolls are small kebabs hence that is also not oily. Like it and recommend it as its light and one does not feel stuffed with the unnecessary paratha and oil and extra masalas. The rolls are still reasonable price wise compared to other places!

Me and a friend met at new market to grab a drink and have some decent food as we had a lot to catch up about. After searching zomato i came accross this place and thought of giving it a try. It has 2 floors both air condioned. The bar was at the top floor. The top floor is pretty dark with some coloured lights hanging over the tables. I kind of liked it as because you get to see the food and ur table mates quite comfortably and also do not get distracted by the fellow foodies at the other tables. We grabbed beers which was provided to us in about 5mins. Then we ordered prawn and chicken friedrice and teamed them up with taiwan chicken which was their speciality in the menu. The fried rice was average with good quantity. I really like the chicken dish. The chicken was tossed in some sauce which was really tasty. This dish is bit on the sweeter side but really full of flavours. The staffs were very helpful and polite. The only problem I faced was during the payment. As I was paying by card I was asked to go to the payment counter in the top floor but the machine did not work. Then again I was asked to go all the way downstairs for the payment and yet again that machine did not work there either. Luckily I had enough cash with me for the payment. Overall a good experience. Maybe will visit again to try some indian food.

A place good for a drink but nothing other than that. Very clumsy environment with slow service and standard food quality. Situated at a very convenient location in new market, the place is only to be visited for a quick drink or if you are too hungry to explore.

There are some restaurants where a particular dish or item stands out. Badshah'r Roll is pretty famous.. This outlet is located in esplanade near sreeleathers. 
The chicken roll is quite nice. It's not very oily as rolls usually are, dripping with oil. They give a generous amount of filling as well and it's delicious. However, with time the quality has gone down. Have only tried the rolls from this place so can't comment of the other food items. Pocket friendly.

I have been here many times and such low rating does not do justice to this restaurant. They serve really tasty food. Mutton kasha and parantha is the best combination one can order. It's lip-smaking. Though it's a bar I've visited this place with my family a lot of times(and none of us drink alcohol). The point is the atmosphere is absolutely fine. If in New Market area, must try Badshah. You won't be disappointed.

My visit to this place cannot be explained much as we were not entertained by due to lack of resources.

Just like any other day, we - a bunch of friends went for an evening stroll and quite casually decided to dine in this eatery. As we opened the door to enter, we were stopped by asking if there were prior reservations to which we declined. Then he asked us to wait which we patiently did. However, after 15 minutes of wait, he came and said that there aren't any seats available to accommodate us. Listening this, we departed from the place.

This restaurant is located on the the lindsay street. It gets featured in the list of legendary restaurants of the city of joy . It has been serving people with delectable choices of mughlai and rolls over the years but with time they have lost their name and fame. I visitd this place few days before the pujas and it was damn crowdy and the management was least concernd about the comfort of customers . Even i saw a waiter picking up a fight with a customer regarding service issues.
if you ever head to this place just expect average tasty food nothing more than that :-)

Badshah has been very close to my heart. I agree that its quality of food has never been as good as others serving mughlai cuisine. Yet, each of our "new market trips" used to end with a glass of lemonade from a nearby vendor and lunch at Badshahs. 

Though it never had a good ambience, there was something which attracted me whenever I was there. 
Each time my family and I ordered the same Chicken/Mutton boti kebab and Paratha. 

To me, this combination was great and truly I never ever ordered anything else apart from this. For me, Badshah has always been about Boti kebabs and parathas. 
Yeah, it is something special. 
Happy dining

I like exploring shaddy places and this one is another one. They have those green trippy lights. They rolls they serve are pretty yum and they are cheap. What more can anyone  ask for. It was pretty crowded with all age groups of people. Worth exploring this place!!!

This place is known for its egg chicken roll and specially for its kababs. You can take your female frnds. Not an awkward place to sit.

Famous for their legendary rolls, this outlet proudly stands very close to Globe Cinema. They were a famous name once, but sadly their quality has gone down the hills down these years. I remember of dropping here once for their drinks, but that was many many years back for me to remember anything properly. They still manage to serve decent rolls though. Crispy Parathas and succulent chicken, can anyday compete with Nizam's. Be careful of the chillies though. They tend to give in a lot of them, unless told not to right at the start.

One of the legendary eatery in the city of joy. Badshah the name itself gives you the idea of the cuisine they serve.
Located at the Esplanade near the Sreeleathers outlet.
They are famous for the rolls specially and mughlai khana. This is one bar where people eats more than boozing.
The interiors are a bit old fashioned but that's the catch which gives you the old vibes from it. It's a must try place for the foodies.

A LEGENDARY ROLL CENTER BECOMES A GOOD RESTAURANT..... WOW!!

* Location : Just beside Sreeleathers, Lindsay st in New market area, this legendary roll center has been furnushing the interior... so good to see.

* Ambience : You cant expect a beautiful decor in the busy street of Lindsay because the space of decoration is not so easy there, this outlet is located there for long long years. Yet they have expanded much inside. There are 2 large hall rooms, the entering one is for general, they serve rolls and all foods there. And the room inside the hall,is especially a bar; they serve alcohol and foods there. I appreciate this seperation because many aged people and teenagers may not like the bar culture in this traditional outlet. Chairs and tables are quite ordinary,but they are recently renovating it; so the roll lovers may expect a better decor and comfort.

* Foods : I ordered.....
       1. Their traditional EGG MUTTON ROLL and the paratha of the roll was very crispy and thin and not at all oily. As every legendary restaurants this special "roll outlet" has certainly degraded. But still they have kept their reputation. (rating 9 on 10)
       2. CHICKEN SWEET AND SOUR SOUP would be excellent if they wouldn't provide so much of green chilly. The taste was good,but black peeper smelled so much that you would feel uncomfortable. (rating 5 on 10)
       3. CHICKEN TANDOORI was really good, well cooked and after all varieties of rolls, this tandoori item is renowned here. Everyone was taking it So I tried and instantly liked it so much. Chicken pieces were big enough in comparison with its price. (rating 10 on 10)
       4. CHICKEN FRIED RICE was moderate, not upto the mark. (rating 5 on 10)


* Price : Reasonable. Even alcohols. Anything expensive is not going to count here for busy Lindsey st.

* Management : This outlet is always a popular one; so service staffs know how to retain their reputation. They were mainting perfectly many different kind of orders of 2 different kind of customers, alcoholics and non-alcoholics. It was good to see. Thumbs up for them. (rating 9 on 10)

* Recommended : Surely for its variety of rolls. They all are deicious.

* One Complain : To the management.....
                    you guys are very fast in serving. So we were having trouble to end up one item and another one came so fast. I complaint twice and then you slowed down. Give the customers time to swallow the foods please!!!

At a glance tbh ut looked very shady , shabby and unsophisticated ... tucked in a corner next to the hogg market 
We had tandoori roti and reshmi kebab butter masala
Food was decent . Would say the best. I have had better.
Prices decent again
Waiters too eager for tips and also to throw you out asap though there arent really too many people waiting.
For a one time experience it okay.
Wouldnt really want to hop in again ..there are much better eateries in that area

Badshah is a well-known eatery in the crowded footpath of New Market, Kolkata. This place is also known for the famous Kathi rolls and poses a stiff competition for Legendary Nizam’s in serving the best rolls in Kolkata. I dropped by this place to experience their version of Kathi roll for some late afternoon bites.

Ambience was bit disappointing. Interior is not so eye-catchy with dim lighting and looked gloomy in the afternoon! Moving on to the food, I went ahead ordering a Double Chicken Double Egg Kathi roll. It was prepared and served fresh. Roll was Luscious and went well with the combination of the sauces provided along with. The flavour of tender Kebab in the roll was extraordinary. Service was prompt and they were more eager in serving the customers.

Badshah is definitely a good place to drop by for Quick bite amidst New Market shopping/food hopping experience.

Badshah is one of the renowned restaurants in New market. We ordered chiken tikka kebab roll, it was delicious. 
For health freaks you must try this one. Low oil and very light and healthy. 
Only thing that I found not satisfying was size. It was really small, as it could not feel a hungry tummy.

Must try restaurant.

One of the most popular places you can find in new market area..too famous for a mere street food stall..don't get me wrong, they are the supreme leaders of street food in this place..the volume of money they collect in any odd day is much much higher than many top restaurants in the whole city. .

But that doesn't always translate into an awesome experience of food..I honestly had an mixed experience in this place..

Times I found the rolls of this place just great..lip smacking bites, punchier flavours and insanely tasty..

But sometimes the whole experience was a flat line..just ok ok..

Its hard not to recommend this place because you will end eating in it anyway in this place if you visit this place..hard to miss..

But experience can be not so over the top..

HAVE A NICE TIME

This is a really old establishment.

The interiors are a bit dark so its hard to read the menu card.  The tables are placed close to each other, so you can pretty much see what your neighbour is eating.

We ordered fish fry, chicken kobiraji and chicken roll.  The fish fry was good and it was served with potato chips and onions.  It would have been better if it had been served with kasundi.
The chicken in the kobiraji was well done, but the egg coating didn't taste so good.  This too was served with potato chips and onions.
They forgot to get the chicken roll so cannot comment on it.

Service - they were short staffed on the day I went, so needless to say it was slow.    Perhaps its better on other days.

Food: 3/5

I had chicken roll here before. It was really good. Today I had veg hot and sour soup. It had a generous amount of spinach. I didn't like it at all. I had chicken kobiraji. It was buried in airy egg fries with a little bit of onion and chips. It was a let down. I thought it would have been like coffee house's. The table was small too. Not big enough for 4 people.

Every time I go shopping to New Market, I visit this shop for a snack - mostly a roll. I generally seat myself on the bench at their reception or get a take-away but yesterday, I went into their AC restaurant with my 12-year old. The waiters were quick in giving us the menu card soon as we were seated. We ordered an Egg Double Mutton Roll and a Special Chicken Reshmi Roll and a milkshake. Within a few minutes we were served with the rolls and soon after, the milkshake arrived. My son was not impressed; he is a massive foodie. The rolls were okay by him but the milkshake was a disappointment. Although pricey, their rolls are filling

Probably one of the best chicken roll available in calcutta...the size of their paratha is small though and little thin compared to other roll centres... but thats what i like about them...and its not at all oily at the same time... if u tell them to make the paratha with no oil they even do that... people who are health conscious and still want to grab a katti roll, well this is the place....you can easily eat 2 rolls and still you wont feel very heavy...

Note: Badshah is restaurant but my rating is only for thier rolls....

The ambience is cozy but the quality and the service is really out of expectation...when u end up in a well known restaurant  like Badshah...the price is well above the quality and few people who deals with the service should start treating their customer as they should be treated!!!

I am quite surprised at the low ratings this place has received.  It's an iconic place where my parents will take me and brother for lunch in the afternoon after a day off shopping for pujo.  I love their egg chicken roll... It's got that nice soft buttery feel and I just love it... The other food is also ok

Best part is they are at midpoint at New Market just beside Sumangal..Have been there many a times..Better platters-:
Cantonese Gravy mixed noodles,Dry Chilli Chicken..I am much disappointed with their rolls..I requested for chicken roll & they served this without egg..when asked they told for egg I need to mention this..apart from this it's very much pocket friendly,calm,nice service..Must go for a dine out

Very few places really get a chicken roll right and Badshah is one of them! Never have I been disappointed after eating chicken roll here.

Rest places get the sauces wrong, or the paratha is too thick and chewy 

Badshah chicken roll has been my favorite since childhood and yesterday evening was no different!

Cost 60 Rs which is okay

I have not tried dining here but have tried roll on different occasions. They make one of the best rolls in town. Though situated at heart of the city and is never out of people, the quality remains the same and has remained so across many years. To taste good roll this is the ideal place.

It is purely nostalgia which takes me there every time. The place has not changed a bit. It has the same old decor and same old chairs. It is completely a different experience if one spends some time at the quirky bar above the restaurant The dark ambiance is hypnotic sometimes if not spooky. Here one gets beer at a cheap rate and delicious starters and main course and rolls. The service has deteriorated a bit but that's with every restaurant which is old and forgotten.

Badshah is a legendary place in the heart of the city which serves amazing rolls but down the years, they have degraded in terms of quality and taste. Earlier people shopping in New market used to swear by their rolls. They have a restaurant also which serves multicuisine which is okay too. I hope that they improve and restore their lost glory.

Sad to see this place has lost its value in both ambience and taste since last few years.
If Newmarket was the shopping area for me and family , definitely this was the place to hog. Alas!! Once I took my kid and was wondering why did I come here. Some water was flow in down the floor, the manager (when called to see) was hardly bothered about it. And the taste , nothing was at all near to good. This was a year back. However , having a connection with this hangout, a month back I order two rolls for "to go".they don't taste the same delicious rolls . Hope and wish they change and come with flying colors soon.

Badshah used to be one of the stalwarths of Kolkata Cullinary scene in yesteryears,but sadly today it is no more than a shadow of its past greatness..Yet another of thos fallen angels this place has went horribly wrong in the last few years..Even a decaded back it used to serve on of the Finest Rolls or more aptly I should say Kolkata's Kathi Roll (without any bland sauce) and you could have finish your meal with a couple of those species..Hot,less oily,smoky charred morsels of chicken/mutton..it used to be an experience itself and thats the only reason for me to rate this place as High as 1.5..Presently this is even worse than a roadside eatery..They used to serve quite a delectable Handi Biriyani with tast fried onions on top,sadly the food don't taste even eatable anymore..The ambiance here literally Sucks!!it is creepy, unhygienic, quite uncomfortable because of low ceilings and some of the worst crowd..The upper floor has a bar area which serves pretty economical Drinks,60ml Royal Stag will cost you around Rs.110/-..apart from that don't even try this place for food..not even the Rolls anymore..The service is quite lackluster..and whats most unprofessional is 60% of the listed menu is not available most of the time..
Overall would suggest Nizam or Karco for some quick delicious Rolls in the vicinity..

Badshah is considered an institution in the New Market area, and spoken about in hallowed tones by my mum and aunties. I was lucky enough to be taken there by my mum, and she confirmed for me that the food today is just as delicious as it was 40 years ago!

We had a plate of veg biriyani and a veg cutlet, and both were delicious! The service was good, but not brilliant, however the food well and truly makes up for it.

On a good day, you could get what in my humble estimation is the original Kolkata kathi roll! Their frills-free chicken roll draws me back to them, over and over again. Almost like I look for an excuse to head towards Lindsay Street. Dry, slender and with just the right amount of smouldered orangish chicken pieces, with kachha pyaaz, green chillies and just a hint of a masala, makes their rolls really slim and delicious, minus the grease; unlike the 'mushtanda' ones that you get all over town, almost like more value for your money! But if you're a freak for solid, overflowing rolls, then no, this is not the place for that drivel!

Badshah was in vogue since my great-grandfather's time and has been quite a thing in  Esplanade! Lately the standard tanked and it started to disappoint! Until recently, with a revamp! Went in to basically avoid the rain and have the Kobiraji! 
Now we started with Fish Finger, 10 pieces a plate, yes that's right, and it was quite delicious! The quality of the fish was very good, and the Fry, just right! It was followed by Chicken Kobiraji, and that was a delight! It was light and fluffy and very tasty! I remember my previous visits when the Kobiraji was oily and smelly, but gone are those days and for good! Next was followed by a stewards suggestion, Murgh Malai Kebab! A different take on kebab, cooked with cream. It was sweet, with the perfect amount of char! But I would have liked it a bit more soft!
The interior is still a little shabby even with dim lights and all!
Overall Badshah did not disappoint this time! #GoodWork #Foodie

Badshah, one of the old resturant is situated at the lindsay street in the New Market area. They offer both dine-in and take away.

We tried their Kathi rolls, but i found them oily, overpriced. On the second day, we decided to try their chinees, so we ordered chowmin and chilli chicken. Quantity was good but again poor quality and high price.

Ambience not soo good. They dont clean their dishes properly. I would say try them if you are hungry and dont have any other options in hand.

" To all the girls I've loved before, who've travelled in and out my door, I'm glad they came along I dedicate this song to all the girls I've loved before..." a timeless classic by Julio Iglesias which somehow fits in perfectly with my feelings for Badsha.

  I've given Badsha a 5 , does it deserve it ? perhaps not but to me it will always be a 5. Badsha was where my parents went on their first date ( back in those days you got married first and then went on dates), and when I was considered old enough (10) I was allowed to accompany my parents and as a special treat tickets were also purchased for a show at Birla Planetarium which is just a short distance away. Although it was a little more than 22 years ago, I still remember the heavenly taste of their double egg double chicken rolls and the rich aromatic smell of their "Badsha Special". It was all we had to eat that day "ekta kore roll and ekta plate Badsha Special" but I will never forget the excitement that I felt going with "Ma and Baba" like a big boy nor will I ever forget the heavenly taste of the rolls or the chicken and paratha of the "Badsha Special".

My family left Calcutta shortly after and whenever we came back Badsha was always on the list of things to do but somehow in the hustle and bustle of life we just never seemed to make it. Badsha will for me forever hold those wonderful & nostalgic memories of a little boy preening like a peacock because he was allowed to get into the car with his folks and go to a restaurant.

" To all the girls I've loved before, who've travelled in and out my door, I'm glad they came along I dedicate this song to all the girls I've loved before..." (P.S- I am told that the Birla Planetarium show was a complete washout as having stuffed myself at Badsha I walked in and promptly fell asleep.... but such are the wonder years of our lives).

It's quite sad to see a legendary place like Badshah loosing it's credibility as one of the best roll outlets in town. Time takes it toll on everything but I still like their preparation and at times stop by to get a bite. The interiors are decent and they do serve drinks but many wouldn't prefer that here. The only thing that'd favor a foodie is their low prices and I hope Badshah gets back to the level of perfection that used to muster cause New Market is owned by the legacy of places like this and many others.

Badshah is located at the lindsay street in the New Market area and has both dine in and take-away-roll corner. They serve both Indian and chinese delicacies. This used to be one of my favourite eateries. I remember coming to this joint with my parents when I was in school. Since then this restaurant has been a source of sheer nostalgia for me. I used to love their chinese dishes like fried rice, chilli chicken, chowmein and not to mention their rolls! But recently there has been a severe drop both in the quality of the food and the service. The prices in case of rolls are overrated. The staff is not courteous and you receive cold reception from them every other day. The dishes and glasses are rarely clean. I am hugely disappointed with this place. Try this only if you're at New market and is terribly hungry else the Badshah now is not even worth of a single visit.

One of the many little places serving kathi Rolls aswell as  some other dishes,mainly tandoori and non veg. Convenient for the area residents or if youre in desperate need of a quick bite. The rolls are reasonably tasty but found them a bit oily,so tell the cook to go a bit easy on the oil. Reasonably priced but not really a place to plan and go out to.

It was always a relief to come here grab the yummy rolls and soups ,chilli chicken and egg fried rice... food is good..prices aren't too high,they r affordable and after doing shopping in new market this one place where I prefer to eat because the ambience is very nice,soothing quiet and services are good. Today again I went there and best part I liked the taste is still same ,still good quality. I and my friend was extremely hungry we straight away ordered chicken sweet corn soup,egg fried rice and chilli chicken along with thumbs up.  And our bill came 591rs which was perfect.

Any roll here is mouthwateringly delicious with just the right balance of flavours.One tip for you guys is to ask them to fry the onions they put in the roll.I have  been visiting Badshah for as long as I can remember!Every trip to Kolkata or New Market means a Badshah pit stop for sure. kabiraji is a must try!Over the years I would say their snacks remain stellar but the main course is priced too high for the quality and ambience.DONT miss out on the rolls!Hands down best roll in town!

After a hectic shopping spree in the all time favourite and historic New Market, you deserve to take a respite in this place for sure. The crispy rolls are simply awesome and since it is not very big in size, you could always have more than one roll for sure. It is a small place and brings back a lot of childhood memories having gone there with my mum, although it may have deteriorated a bit over the years but I still like it. A must try is all the fish items along with a cold drink which is served in a very old fashioned way with a straw. Enjoy the Kathi rolls and chit chat over your shopping items - am sure you will like it too. Very nostalgic ...

Visited Badshah on a saturday afternoon for lunch. It was crowded with shoppers of New Market.
The food or the ambience is nothing BADSHAHI out there. Pretty average, it was.
My father used to love the food served here 25 years back. 
Few days ago, we tried their rolls (chicken kebab and mutton roll) which were very much ordinary with lots of onion juliens and very less pieces of meat.

Anyway. Here are the things we ordered :-
1) Hot and sour chicken soup (1 into 2) 1/5 : My brother loves chinese and urges on to ordering chinese anywhere he goes. He went ahead by ordering this soup and he immediately changed his decission of having chinese out there.The soup had a lots of vegetables and chicken pieces but there was an overpowering taste of soy sauce and was more like a hojpoj where the leftover veggies were literally thrown into it.

We moved onto order the main course :- 
2) Chicken tikka butter masala (1 plate) 3.6/5 : It had 6 decent sized pieces of chicken in a thick succulent mildly sweet gravy. The quantity of the gravy was however not sufficient.

3) Fish tikka ; 1 plate @Rs.250 (3.5/5) : There were 4 decent sized portions of fish which were well charred with a good balance of tandoori masala covering. The fish was flaky and tasty but we expected atleast 6 pieces for the money paid. 

4) Masala kulcha (3 no.s) 3/5 : The kulchas were thick with a generous amount of mixture of different vegetables (beans, carrots, potatoes) and were  heavy. Being very heavy, these were average to taste. 
 
5) Butter naan (1 no.) 3.3/5 : The butter naan was nice and soft. 

The pocket pinch was around 1,300 bucks which was more or less reasonable.
The overall experience was nothing extraordinary. So a one time visit is recommended. 

Happy eating. :)

Its one of the oldest restaurant of the new market area..coming here since i could hardly walk...rolls have been always my favourite...the chicken/mutton inside the roll are so well cooked with a awesome awesome tangy flavour on it and at the same time spicy (they don't use sauce/ketchup in rolls)....parathas r awesome n soft....last time i visited the place i decided to try out some other foods from this great restaurant... i ordered chicken kabiraji,mutton rara and tandoori roti...
Kabiraji was good and large in size served with potato chips and salad..chicken was well marinated and soft..but the item was way too oily..
Mutton dish was also tasty and spicy bt again very oily..
Tandoori was average in taste and size..
Ambience is also quiet average ..considering its quite an old resturant...
Overall..its a best place to have rolls only...

Badshah rolls are basically take away stuffs but you can surely grab one any time whenever you pass Lindsay street. The restaurant offer a greater variety from kulchas to kebabs but its not something extraordinary. The ambience is alright and obviously it is a family restro. Services are good.

N if I am planning to sit.. its a bluish ambience inside..very noisy coz I dont like the crowd. Most of the items arent available. But if u r lucky enough ..try the chicken sashlik platter. U will love it. N den the mutton golbari with paratha is something that I love as well. So I guess. If u r not in search of great food. Bt u have to eat. I guess badshah is your call.

I got introduced to this place in my mid teens by a senior in college with whom I had gone to New Market. She took me for a roll treat to Badshah. The menu is limited, but the taste is awesome. But the problem is that the aroma made us order much more than we had planned to. The fun part is that even after hogging like mad people the bill was pocket friendly even in college goers’ standard.

Badshah has been a favourite haunt of mine for ages! In fact I think they make the best rolls in the city. Gone are the days when they used to serve Chicken and Fish Kobiraji Cutlets or even a plain (but delicious) Fish fry!. They even made a killer dry chilli chicken once upon a time.

Now all that is left is Rolls, and i'm glad to say they haven't let standards slip on that front. My usual order is Egg Chicken Kebab Roll Double Sticks, Mutton Kebab Roll Double Sticks with a side order of Mutton Kati kebab. The thinness of the paratha and it's non-greasiness adds to the flavour of the rolls so that you can taste the meat and the subtle paratha. This is one of my favourite comfort foods. 

If it's rolls, it's Badshah!

Oh my God! This defines rolls for me. This review, however, is based on a much much much earlier experience when I was four feet tall. I had not really experienced Zeeshan then. My father had treated me to egg chicken roll here and I was awed. That is what my feeling really was and I totally loved it since then. Sadly I am not into shopping and haven't really gone much to the new market area to actually go and eat rolls there. But I would definitely suggest people to go an try it out.

My 1st encounter with Badshah dates back to almost 10 years back when my uncle took me there saying "Tui kokhono Badshah r Roll khasni? Cho..khaoabo! " ..well that was bengali :P and it translates to like "You never had Badshah rolls!!! lets go..my treat! " and we made merry with Badshah Rolls that day. Apparently I was unaware that they serve other dishes also apart from Roll at the 1st time, but later on have been there many a times and from my numerous visits my review will be like, Badshah = Rolls primarily. The parathas are quite soft from the inside and have a little crunch on the outside, they use chicken and mutton tikkas as fillings and they are very tasty and a bit on the spicy side which suits me just perfectly as i am somewhat aloof from the idea of eating clean while having fast food. Here i would add they generally dont add any sauce in their rolls but maybe they are adding if you ask for it. Apart from that i somewhat liked their Fried Rice but its nothing special and as for me none of their other items deserve any special mention, barring the rolls. Ambience is quite dull inside,nothing to boast of, service is also not fast, but quite pocket friendly i must say.
Definitely not the place to take your man/woman on a romantic dinner, rather its a perfect fast food joint for students and the numerous shoppers in the Hogg Market area to have a quick refuel while wandering through the roads of Esplanade.

My relatives love the rolls from this place. This joint is located near sreeleathers,new market. I have always ordered rolls from here so never been to their dining area. The cash counter is filled with people placing their orders and waiting for the same. 
Coming to the rolls have tried egg paneer roll, egg chicken roll, egg rolls,egg mutton roll. To be honest I dont find the rolls extraordinary though they are not bad. The paratha are a bit on the harder side. They also do not give any kind of sauces/ketchup in your rolls. Overall an average place.

The food, ambiance and maintenance inside of the restaurant on date deserves a 1.5 rating ..... however I will give this place a 3.5 simply and only for the rolls. 
Yes you need to go and stand there and make them make your paratha fresh or they will slip you a cold one , yes you need to request them to use less oil ( they do oblige ) , yes the kebab pieces have shrunk to miniature size and the rolls are expensive .... however taste wise I still find them to be the best for the following reasons -

--They still make the kebabs on a coal fire and I love the smoky flavor
--The parathas are thin and not layers of dough
--They still only serve up the role with raw onion, chili and lemon rather than sauce and oily fried onions.
The veg rolls are quite sad would not recommend you going with a veggie friend at all else the poor things are not going to be very happy ! 
Bottom line to enjoy your rolls from here get them made yourself at the Roll Counter and do a takeaway. I would not recommend either the restaurant .

Badshah has the best rolls in town .... they have been around for donkeys years and I remember going there as  a 2 yr old with my dad .... the size of the rolls has reduced but the taste is excellent ... they charcoal grill their kebabs and so they retain that slightly smokey flavour .... the parathas are thin and upon request made with little or no oil ..... however the vegetarians beware as the veg rolls are not so great ..... these are old stlye rolls minus thick oily parathas and tons of sauce .... the other food available inside is also decent but the stars of the menu are the chicken and mutton rolls! In terms of ambiance however its nothing to write home about so take-away is your best bet.

The first three letters of Badshah describe the place place rather aptly. BAD. Most of the items available here are available at other restaurants in close vicinity. One might have to pay a bit more for them but at least they will be delicious. The rolls are the only things worth trying. UP Bihar and Nizam's are so close by that I am never gonna have roll here. So BADshah chapter is closed for me. For good. Or BAD.

I went to Badshah after a long time and was pleasantly surprised. Actually it was not the food that had kept me away - I felt that it had started looking a little rundown and uncared for. The other day, however, when we dropped in, I saw that they had made the effort to make it look brighter and more inviting. The place looked fresh and  clean. The food of course was, as always, great and the service very courteous. I was happy to see that the rolls and cold coffee combination still worked. The cold coffee, especially, was superbly made.

A very old restaurant mostly famous for its rolls. I also like their chicken kabiraji along with a mug of beer. Mostly this restaurant, is for a take away for rolls but it has a decent dining place with bar. Shop at new market and drop in at badshah for some quick snacks is what I mainly visit here for. A decent place and also quite cheap.

Yet another food and drink preference in new market area.... heard about this place a lot and its rolls.... but it was rather dissapponting for me when i visited it few years back.... after that i have visited this place a number of time.... not because of its food or alcohol... but it is the sole drinking option in this area.... ambience is not at all good... food quality deserves 2.5.... too clumpsy a place to sit and enjoy ur food and drinks....

A one-time hero of the Kolkata roll world, nowadays people avoid Baadshah because of the exorbitant price and horrible food quality. A month back, I was shopping in New market, and, feeling quite hungry, my friend and I decided to drop in Baadshah for a couple of rolls. The place was quite empty, although it was 2.30 p.m, supposedly peak time. That should have warned us.

However, we do tend to be stupid, so ordered two chicken rolls. As we were seated, I noted that there were little bits of food sticking to the sofa, so i was quite turned off. The place has a bar upstairs, so I saw a good number of men going upstairs, while eyeing me and my friend, who was a girl, like we were meat on display. I was very irritated by their attitude. 

The rolls came in, and they were quite small, and not piping hot, but lukewarm. Although the chicken was okay, both my friend and I hated the paratha which was too oily and smelled of rapeseed oil. Our bill was somewhere around 70, and the waiter actually looked at us disappointed when we did not add any tip. For two rolls, served in very dirty conditions, we did not see fit to tip.

Sorry Badshaah, we will not return.

Badshah, once famous for its rolls, is now a  shadow of its former self. Excessive adulation has caused it to venture into the world of sit-down dining, dealing a death-blow to its roll business. Its location makes it the ideal spot for people to drop in before, after or while shopping, hence, it has become complacent.

The Mutton Roll, which is usually the decider of quality in any roll shop, is quite bad. The quality of the meat is good, but that is about it. It is cooked badly and stuffed into a limp paratha with tons of oily onions. The paratha is also very small - two-thirds the size of rolls from other well-known shops  - Kusum and Hot Kati Roll being the most obvious ones.

Patrons who do not go into the air-conditioned dining space are invited to sit on a sofa covered with pieces of onion, strips of mutton and bits of paratha. I had to dust a spot before being able to sit there. The roll was handed to me quickly enough, but, as described earlier, it was very bad. At 35 rupees per roll, it was simply not worth it. Hence, it is a place best avoided.

This is what I would call a kind of make shit restaurants. This place is for all the shopoholics who get extremely hungry by roaming around in New Market all day (count me on too ;) )this place has nothing called an ambience and interior. It just has a few set of tables and chairs, cliched mirrors on to sides. The staff is rude and not curteous. The only good things are that it is air conditioned and have a good food. Try the biryani, chicken fried rice, chily chicken and mutton do piyaza and the ambience wont matter much or so I hope. Even the rolls and fresh juice are good.

Badshah in Lindsay Street has kept on providing me a good space for rest, chat and drink during my college days. The calm and cozy atmosphere of the bar in first floor of Badshah allowed me and my close friend to have tete-a-tete. It offered me and my friends to take a break from the hustle and bustle of Kolkata, talk among ourselves and plan what to do and what not to do. We had white rum with chicken fingers. The cost of per plate chicken fingers was Rs. 75.00. It was not so reasonable. We needed to pay a certain amount as VAT along with actual price of the dish, which eventually gave us a bit jerk and we felt that we could easily access a better quality restaurant in Esplanade area. Youngsters do love to visit Badshah for its exquisite kebabs, which are really yummy and chicken rolls. Badshah is famous for chicken rolls. Most people order chicken rolls and eat them up standing outside the restaurant. Even I sometimes opt for eating outside Badshah when I am too hungry to engulf one or two rolls at a time and do not have much time or money to move into a quality restaurant. Recently they are giving small quantities of chicken pieces inside rolls and the parathas have also got thin but the taste remains all the same. Mutton preparations are also great to eat in Badshah. The aloo and paneer rolls are not so great. They did not care to marinate the paneer pieces with the right kinds of spices that are essential for making vegetarian rolls. Among the main course meals I like Chicken Do Piyaza with rice. They are delicious and spicy to eat. That is the one main course of Badshah I cherish for till date. The surrounding of the ground floor, which happens to be the restaurant is too clumsy to sit and enjoy lunch with family.

A BAR is present on the top floor or upstairs of badshah  .  donno    why zomato  has  listed  this place  as  a NON- BAR  .  vat-69 or 100 pipers here would cost you rs 200 / 60 ml peg  .  in food the day we went FISH was not available as it was already out of stock . we had BACARDI white RUM    @ rs 110/ 60 ml peg & old monk @ rs 90 /  60  ml peg  .  in  food  we  had  chicken  chowmein  gravy  (  rs 150 / plate  ) sweet  & sour chicken @ rs 165  / plate & hot garlic  chicken @  Rs 160 / plate .  overall  the bill  for  two  with  6 alcoholic  drinks  came  to  around  rs 1275 ,  which  was  neat  .  but  considering  the  ambiance  i  must  say  that food  here  is  a  bit  costly  ,  since  better  options  are  available  in  esplanade  area .

Please avoid this place at any cost!!!Although the location is really strategic and convenient but sadly that's the only positive about this joint.Horrible kebabs-akin to chewing gum, rude waiters,dirty cutlery,sharing of tables in the bar section,noisy and worst of all prices which do not justify the quality of food at all.The prices of drinks are cheap and this place is meant for college goers who are hard pressed for funds anyways.This joint is somehow surviving due to their rolls section at the ground floor which does brisk business throughout the day courtesy the steady stream of shoppers in the vicinity.
