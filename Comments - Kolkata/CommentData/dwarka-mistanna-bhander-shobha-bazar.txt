Dwaraka Mistana Bhandar is located at the crossing of Shyambazar. Sweets are good quality. Their sandesh are very good and they also have a variety of it. Rosogolla and Samosa are also good one.

Another place of sweets. Speciality of this place is their various types of rossogolla. They have mango, strawberry and lemon rossogollas which are quite a delicious thing. Again they have the softest rossogollas in the Kolkata I have ever tasted.

Located just opposite to Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar, near Shyambazr AV School. This is a decent sweet shop and has stepped up its quality and variety, from the past few years. Facing stiff competetion from Chittaranjan & the veteran Bhabhatarini Mishtanna Bhandar beside it, this sweet shop delivers standard sweets at a good price.

Situated just opposite the very famous Chhitranjan mishtann bhandar. Service was quick but staff were rude. Their sweets were made of desi ghee, pure mava and fresh chhena. Variety of sweets which looks good, smells good and tastes delicious. I liked the most their rossogulla and raj bhog. Now famous as Chhitranjan but tastes as good as they were. In snacks they have only samosa which was just â‚¹5 but it's size was also small and taste was average. Good sweets and good experience. Recommended to all.
