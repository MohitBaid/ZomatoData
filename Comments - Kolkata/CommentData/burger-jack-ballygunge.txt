Burgers are great but all 3 that I ordered were exactly the same.... the choice of the chicken burgers need to be diversified.

A sudden choice for a quick bite to beat boredome and was pleased with my judgment. The wraps and salads are a must try. I don't whether I was hungry so finished the food fast or whether the quantity was less but beside this didn't find much of a complain

thought of trying it for a quick bite. it was totally worth it. tried burger and it ws worth every penny. fresh and tasty. will definitely try other options too. 
its majorly a take away joint so quick service is there.

Since I ordered online, I am going to write only about the food. I ordered 2 Chicken Blockbuster Burger & 1 Chicken wrap. The burger was enough for one person. But I found the chicken patty inside both burger & wrap to be a bit hard & overfried. The party was just like what we get in KFC Zinger burgers, although KFC makes the fried chicken soft enough. Overall, it tasted good and it is cheaper than most burgers in town.
