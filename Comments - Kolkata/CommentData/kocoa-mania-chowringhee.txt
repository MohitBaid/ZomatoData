Belgian Choco mousse...sinful, a little bit sweeter...would have been lovely had there been a tinge of bitterness and silkiness...anyways good treat for young dessert lovers...it's a veg friendly joint with sparse outdoor seating...

A cute little bakery on Lord Sinha Road.. Kocoa mania is our go to place for instant cake delivery for any kind of celebration in our office.
They bake lovely cakes at reasonable price.. I am not really a very big fan of the taste of cakes here but overall, its good!
Also tasted their
Brownie - okayish &
Sandwich - they instantly make the sandwiches - its fresh, filling & tasty but if you are planning to take away it gets a bit messy because of the way they pack it.

Happy eating üòä

We went to this outlet of Kocoa Mania for the second time. No doubt the taste of the cake is good but both the time they didn't deliver the cake on time. The second time they were to deliver the cake at 4PM and we went there at 5.10PM but still they couldn't deliver us. When we spoke to the person associated she told it would take more of 45 minutes. And moreover the staff at that outlet is not at all customer friendly and rude at the way of talking.

One of my friends got me a cake from here. I don't know the exact location. 
The cake was really moist and chocolaty! It tasted really good after freezing it. The chocolate just melts into your mouth. Yummy!

The location is perfect, it's situated beside the gate leading to Emami Market. So it should be having a crowd jostling to buy....But that was not the case, I wonder why? For their stuff was really very good.The blueberry souffle was just awesome, with the correct sweetness and a lovely smoothness, the blueberry flavour too came through. The chocolate cake slice too was good, soft and moist...
Tasty. The masala Chai and Chilly cheese toast were also good.bI looked around the shop and saw that they had a variety of pastries and cakes, which were a visual treat.Definitely going back to try their other amazing stuff.

I had ordered my cake from Kocoa Mania. Got the reference through Just Dial so I decided to visit the store. I tried a belgian choco mousse and aa Choco truffle pastry (being a chocoholic) I loved the taste so I decided to place the order. I chose the cake and placed the order through whatsapp. It was carried out so smoothly, the delivery was done before the alloted time. And the cake stole the show. Keep up the good work!

A small joint located just beside the emami market which mainly features varieties bakery products and soft drinks. The spread was not much and the price was unexpectedly high considering the products. Even small tarts were priced at rs50 a piece. 
We had masala tea. And we couldn't get the touch of any masala. Tasted bland. Tea around the street corners tastes better than this. 
I didn't tatste the other bakery products. Hope they were upto customer expectations.

I just took cupcakes of blue berry and strawberry flavour for a friend's bday and she was happy seeing the beautiful cup cake, but when we ate it, it was having a foul smell, and i felt so embarrassed and disgusted, like seriously i was so exited to see her reaction and that foul cake spoiled it all. Highly disappointed. I am afraid do u guys even check fr how long u keep the cake in the mirror box. And i guess you guys know the meaning of feeding an old cake, if any consequences would have occurred you guys would have been held responsible. So be careful so that others do not suffer.
I would have given a negative score but there is none.

Kocoa Mania is a dream land for anybody with a sweet tooth. They feature everything that has to do icing, sugar and sprinkles!

Kocoa Mania is located on Russel Street. Near landmark would be Shri Shikshayatan College or as a matter of fact, Emami Market. If you're coming from Exide Haldiram, take the first left and you'll find this little eatery on your left after a few minutes of walk.

This place is a small shop with different types of pastries and sweets. They feature fancy cakes, cupcakes and pastries. Fondant Minion Cupcake, they got it! The food items here taste decent. It is light on the pocket and ideal for small bites and gifts.

Kocoa Mania is situated near my college and is just in front of the Emami Market. Cakes to cookies, everything is available here to tickle your sweet buds. They have a decent seating arrangement outside their outlet but the authorities need to step up their hygiene level. A fly was buzzing around our table and that was disappointing on so many levels. However, I chose to order a chocolate doughnut. The upper layer was quite yummy but the inner portion was blatant. The prices of the delicacies are also on the steeper side and can burn a hole in your pocket. I would like to wind up by stating that the staffs are courteous and delivers spontaneous service.

A cake and chocolate studio located in Lord Sinha Road,(emami market), Kocoa mania is a wonderful place for custom made cakes. 
I am surprised to find such poor ratings for this place, because I have always found the place to be good.
I have got two custom cakes ( an anniversary cake and a spinster themed cake both in chocolate truffle) made from here and both looked and tasted absolutely amazing.
Have also had their blueberry and red velvet cupcakes and they are nice.

The prices are like any other bakery and the location is a complete advantage for them.

I would recommend this place for custom cakes anyday!

They hardly have options in cupcakes. The chocolate truffle cake was too sweet. I could even taste a few chunks of sugar. What was worse was the fact that each pastry was for 70. I have tried their cupcakes as well, and it was average. They need to improve a lot.

Location: Near emami market. Opposite Shikshayatan college.
Ambience: Its a tiny outlet with an outside seating arrangement for 4-6 people.
Food: I have only tried their desserts so cant really talk about the other savouries they have on their menu.
The red velvet cake was a letdown.
The chocolate mudcake though, was quite good!
My friend had their chocolate mousse and she like that as well :)
Cost: The cost is at par with most of the other bakeries you see in the Sweet Tooth section of Zomato. But I felt the pricing was high; based in their food quality. High price should mean amazing taste and quality too!!

I am quite surprised at the low to mediocre ratings this place has received so far and strongly believe that this place is grossly under-rated. This outlet is conveniently situated 
bang opposite the Shri Shikshayatan School in Lord Sinha road. Size is pretty small, with a few seating arrangements just outside the bakery. A limited but decent variety of cakes,¬†cupcakes,¬†savories¬†and pastries etc are available. AC¬†is run at a pretty low temperature which keeps their stuff fresh and also might freeze you (joke!). ¬†
I ordered a black forest pastry, a chocolate slice cake, a paneer kulcha and 1 mojito for take-away. Mojito was pudina flavoured, nice and well packed in a plastic bottle - but the desired fizz was missing.
¬†Black forest pastry was also soft and nice, although whipped cream content was pretty high! Kulcha had low paneer and capsicum stuffing but tasted good when microwaved.¬†But the pick of the items was their chocolate slice cake - almost perfect, delicate and superb! All their stuff were pretty fresh.
Size of their items is decent and staff service is ok. Also, prices are reasonable and all their stuff generally costs between Rs. 20 - 50.

Overall, a very good experience and I wish this outlet their very best of luck!

I've been ordering cakes from this shop for a while now. The first time I tried Kocoa Mania's truffle cake is still a memorable day. Honestly, it changed my conception about eggless cakes. Super chocolaty with a perfect balance of spongy-ness and cream. Really loved it..¬†
I visited today, had a brownie and a mudpie.. The brownie is very soft and buttery, but a little too sweet. Mudpie was <3 Just in love with itt.. :D

If you dont like that too much of sweet in your desserts dont visit this place! today only got a coffee caramel pastry and a mudpie pastry after a shopping session with mom, the consistency and quality is v good minus the too much of sweetness! plus the whole shop is in a mess, need more maintenance.¬†
and i found the mini cupcakes overpriced too, the birthday cakes look amazing though..and also the brownie and the choco lollies!

This was the first time I ordered a personalized cake for my son's birthday. He loves Batman, and wanted to have a Batman themed cake too. A friend of mine suggested Kocoa Mania for personalized cakes. I must say, the service they give is excellent. I got the cake on time, with a complimentary candle and knife. All the guests were amazed after seeing the cake. My son didn't even want to cut it! The taste is unbeatable. Keep it up.

I've been here twice by now and never been dissatisfied. The scrumptious red velvet cupcakes is a must try. The one thing I loved about them is there student friendly rate of their delicacies and also aversion from using colors in their cupcakes and pastries . 
Would love it if they broaden their varieties as every bit is delicious and worth the 2nd visit. :)

This is a small bakery shop located just adjacent to Emani Market and opposite to Shri Sikshayatan. It's a small shop, with outdoor seating: 1 table, and a ¬†few chairs.

I went there with two friends to satisfy our insatiable desire for some desserts, however was utterly disappointed.

They have quite a good number of fanciful items in their offerings, loads of cupcakes, brownies, pastries and others. We had Belgian Choco Mousse, Truffle Pastry, Chocolate Mudcake, and Red Velvet Cupcake. All of these were a delight to look at. I spent a good amount of time in taking photos of those before starting to savour them, which was when disappointment struck.¬†

Honestly, all those were too sweet to taste. The excess sweetness was odd.¬†

None of us liked any of the items. Because there are other bakeries who offer much better items, at a lesser price.

Never going to visit this place again, and not recommending this to others either.

Kocoa Mania a small outlet opposite to Shri Shikshayatan. The store offers a number of cute cupcakes and desserts. However, I didn't really like the taste. We had red velvet cupcake, chocolate mudcake, Belgian chocolate mousse and truffle pastry of which the red velvet cupcake disheartened me the most. It had a strong smell of rose water which I certainly think is not an authentic ingredient of red velvet cakes. Moreover, the red velvet cupcake had chocolate frosting. Which I absolutely didn't like because chocolate is an extremely overpowering element, so I think it should not have been used to frost a red velvet cupcake as it kind of almost takes the real flavor of the cake away. It felt like the frosting was a futile attempt to cover up the cupcake's bad taste.
The mudcake and the chocolate truffle pastry were fine. But then again the Belgian chocolate mousse was too very sweet than what it should have been. I've been to other bakeries which serve almost similar food items that taste way better but are comparatively cheaper. So, I don't think I'll be back to this bakery again.

I visited this place twice and i really loved it both the times.. My first visit was 2 weeks back when i went to shop at one of my favourite place..This small cake shop is located just beside Emami Market and opposite of Shri Sikshayatan School/ College..During my first visit i had a chocolate mousse which was good enough and today during my second visit i bought a chococone..I found it to be really yummy..Chocalate and chocolate.. and totally creamy..Both the mousse and the chococone were reasonable, something around 50-60 bucks each..They also have very cute cupcakes and tuffles and also cakes for all occasions..A plus point for the vegetarians is that they make eggless cakes.. ;) In short i like everything about this place and the next time i would definately get some clicks of atleast the cute cupcakes.. :D
