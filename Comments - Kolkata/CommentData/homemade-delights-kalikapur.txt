Very poor delivery time and food is not tasty as well. I will never recommend for ordering food here. I had a very bad experience! 
Homemade delight failed in delighting me!! It's should improve its quality in food taste and delivery time!!

I have ordered from this restaurant on lunch. The service was prompt and delivery was on time. I ordered rice with chicken dum and alu bhaja . All were good. Though the chicken gravy could have been a little better.

I stay alone in Kolkata so I love the quality & quantity of food of Homemade Delights. It's like you're having a homemade tasty food. I regularly order food from here. It's very satisfying and the delivery guys are very friendly and on time.

My go to people, whenever I crave home food :) especially the mangso-bhat combo.
thank you for following all instructions on customization, and patiently hearing out requirements.
No wonder you've been bagging so many orders!
Might need to work a little on timely delivery on weekends.
Excellent otherwise

Homemade Delights indeed is as delightful as the most amazing Homemade food in Kolkata. I have been coming here for business visits and have tried ordering from a couple of restaurants. But Homemade Delights has by far delivered the best food for the hungry travellers. I have tried their Mutton Kosha, Dum Chicken and Chicken Kosha along with Aloo jhuri and all dishes are equally good. The portion size is generous and the taste is simply delicious. A special mention has to be given for their quick delivery. Hope to try new dishes in their menu next time!

I ordered quite a number of dishes from here for few days of my stay in kolkata. All the dishes were awesome, so tasty and very good in quantity. The recipes are medium spiced and hence were safe for the stomach. The items I liked most were Bhaja Masala Aloo Dum, Dhokar Dalna and Mochar Ghanto. They were just unique.

I took lunch from the restaurant on 3rd april 2016....ordered bengali cusine with mutton & egg kasha...delivery service is very good with the person delivering the item is gentle in his behaviour...he forgot to deliver one item...but he again came back & delivered it with a smile....Regarding food quality I wuld say it is uncomparable.....egg & mutton kasha in particular is excellent in taste...I thank the entire staff of the restaurant for making such a delicious and mouth watering cusine.
