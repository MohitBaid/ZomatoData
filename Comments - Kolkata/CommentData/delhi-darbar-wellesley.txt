Located near Reepon Street , AJC BOSE road crossing just beside Kathleen. A very shabby looking restaurant. Unhygienic. Poor Utensils. Really below standard food. Staffs behaviour was not good at all. Nothing to say about food. Just definitely not recommended.

Located near my office, went there during Ramadan .
Ordered Special mutton Haleem , tandoori roti and special firni .
Haleem is a high calorie dish made with rice, lentils, minced meat and spices , which is cooked slowly for a paste like consistency .
Haleem was above average.
Special firni was creamy , delectable to eat.
Pocket pinch is very cheap, a shabby not so good ambience with not so good staffs.

Quite reasonable joint serving satisfactory food....the sating area is a bit cramped...not recommended for family dinning....Staffs are ok..... The Chaanp tastes quite good...
An upgrade would be needed soon.....

Amazing food. Try the mutton chaap or mutton rezala with mutton/egg biryani. Really tasty and very authentic. Better than many well known joints.

Love the malai kofta, tandoori chicken and butter nan here! Good quality food with warm hospitality. One of the better north Indian restaurants of Kolkata.

You might have to wait for a while outside  DD to get a table but relish the aroma of chicken chaap, mutton tikkia, biriyani and more. This destination has been my favourite ever since school days. Mutton tikkia with rumali roti & tea. Squeeze the lemon on the sliced onion that comes complimentary. Then tear the roti and wrap a portion of the tikkia. Add few slices of onion into your mouth along with the roti & tikkia and then indulge yourself with a sip of tea. My nostalgic appetite is now at peace. Amen, now your turn.
