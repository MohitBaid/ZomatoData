This is a small eatery located in Bikramgarh market area. The food they sell is undoubtedly mouthwatering. Once you have the momos you would  visit the place again and again. The veg momos are superb and worth it. Noodles were properly cooked with veggies and spices. Thukpa was good. Personally, veg momos are my favourite. The eatery is pocket friendly with reasonable prices.

Very poor experience. I had ordered 3 packs of chicken momo and 1 pack of veg momo. The momos delivered were the smallest I have ever seen( smaller than a tea spoon),  pretty bland and with no accompanying soup. The chicken momos had a funny smell and therefore I ditched them. Check the photo for the size. Be very aware before ordering else you will be seriously disheartened. With a plethora of options available at the same price, its good to give this place a miss unless they pull up their socks.

Dear reader,

Whatever you do please do not order their Butter Garlic Pork, for i speak with experience and one which was rather disappointing. What you'll expect is tender pork meat with the flavours of butter and garlic playing with your tastebuds but what you'll get in reality is tough pieces of FAT which has nothing but too much spice in it and which will give your teeth a really good workout. The only good part about the dish were the capsicum and onion pieces that accompanied the FAT (which is called pork as per the restaurant). 

This was the VERY first time i had tried this restaurant on a rather nice rainy Diwali eve with the help of Swiggy. But i would NEVER AGAIN DARE TO TRY THIS PLACE OUT AGAIN.

Little tip to the restaurant - Pork Fat is NOT Pork Meat.

Interesting name. Interesting place...unique recipes.. Authentic stuff.. First time tried their Kaudi.. Which is macaroni type shells dipped in d regular thukpa soup and boy was it amazing...Pork being my fav meat i tried their pork version and it was supa yummy... Also tried their pork pot rice and pork garlic dry... The rice was too sticky and gravy for my liking.. But i really liked the dry garlic pork... Its in a super hidden lane of bikramgarh but once u find it...Ur tastebuds will thank you... Happy grubbing, :)

Ordered a pork chilli. Ordered via swiggy. Worst resraurant ever. I clearly mentioned to give less fat in the pork dish. I received 8 pieces of only fat. There was no pork. Ull should name the dish FAT IN CHILLY STYLE instead of PORK IN CHILLY STYLE.
