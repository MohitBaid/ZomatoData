Being a foodie I love trying out different restaurants for different cuisines ! I ordered 16-17 plates of Irani mutton biryani from this joint on my birthday ! I would like to mention a few points that grabbed my attention... 1. Great Packaging & looks 2. Quite filling and the mutton pieces were tender and juicy. 3. The signature dish, “butter chicken masala” is the best in town... I even got free “nolen gurer rosgollas” with the biriyani !

Worst biriyani ever. I had ordered Irani Mutton Biriyani. Look at the picture, its like rotten rice. The mutton was also tender. The plastic spoon provided by them got broken whole cutting the mutton.
