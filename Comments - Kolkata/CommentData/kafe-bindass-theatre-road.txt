Shittiest place with worst food and hookah.
Went there on sunday and they served hookah which was really bad and their chicken fried rice was half cooked.Upon complaining they just ignore and,it was an utter waste of time and money going there.

Nachoos were amazing. Hookah is good. Teen pann and double apple hookah is worth it. We completely  loved it. Ambiance is good. A nice place to sit and chill after college. It can be easily located.

I liked the taste of food n drinks... But didn't liked the ambience at all.. It was not at all maintained... Also the staffs are extremely over smart... The decor was impressive but they are not maintaining it too... The chicken in the chilli garlic chicken chowmin was not fresh... And the quantities they are serving in the drinks are not price worthy... Although I love the water melon mojito very much... The hookah was also pretty impressive... Pocket pinch was acceptable...

Located beside Birla High School, this place offers you a very cozy and feel-at-home vibes. Very nice place to just chill with your friends. Hookah is served here and they also have offers on the same. Had ordered a stuffed cheesy potato jacket and Chicken Lollypop. Both were made really well. It also has an outdoor seating arrangement. Amazing place!!! Definitely worth visiting.

Small and compact.
Honestly the decor and ambience kind of turned me off.
The food was nothing out of ordinary yet palatable. Caters well to your hunger.
The service was not satisfactory, maybe it was a bad day because the cafe was pretty packed.
Overall an average experience.

Kafe Bindass is located at Theatre Road , Kolkata. It's a very nice place for hangouts.

Ambience is cool , decor is nice with ample sitting arrangenents coupled with music.

Service is prompt.

Tried Drums of heaven, American corn & cheese sandwich & Green apple mojito.

Drums of heaven was tangy, juicy and palatable. 
Sandwich was nice with ample fillings.
Mojito was refreshing.

Pocket pinch is reasonable too. It's realy a Bindass place.

Located on a busy street, this is a nice place to hangout with friends. The interiors are good and clean, ambience is also good.
The kafe has two seating places , One is Inside where there are nice sofas with music played all over, and the other part is Outside - a open area where u can enjoy the weather ,without the music being noisy on you.
The Kafe offers great Sheesha " Hookah" with varieties of Cofee and appetizers. They also have a good no. of food items. Overall a good and compact menu.
Went there with a friend , and we decided to have seat inside. Already loaded with appetizers we quickly ordered pasta. Service was a bit on the slower side. But the wait was worth it, it tasted absolutely amazing. Served hot with garlic bread it tasted yumm. A must try for pasta lovers.
The quantity was good enough for two and the pricing was also reasonable.

Overall a good Experience. Surely will come back to try out the sheesha next time.

A fairly pretty cafe with a much attractive decor. Service is fast. And the food is frankly very tasty. Ideal place for finger food items; we ordered their Barbecue Wings, Drums of Heaven and Fish & Chips. While the first two orders thoroughly satisfied our taste buds to the fullest bits, the last order did not quite meet our expectations. All three items however left us satisfied on the quantity scale. Great job done by Kafe Bindass!

Good is an understatement for this place . Location is good the ambience is just the quality we need that is not filled up with noise or not just completely quiet.

The taste of coffee is classic and the way they brew it is also cool.

I expected more from the interiors but the nice food bats for them and gives you a feeling of calmness.

Noce place to groove in..

We went to this place after many years and found the place has been totally renovated.It was one of the few cafe established in kolkata when the concept of cafe was introduced.It has seating area both inside and outside the cafe and the ambiance and service went pretty well.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is calm and soothing.You will hear music being played all over the day.We chose to seat outside and it was quite a nice experience.

Service-The service at this place was quite fast and reliable and the sheesha was also prepared very well.The staff was also cooperative and friendly.

Food-The food was quite average at this place.Though it was served fresh and hot but needs some improvement in the taste.We had-
1:Masala fries
2:Veg pasta
3:Irish cold coffee

Service-4/5
Ambiance-4/5

The new overhauled kafe bindass looks vibrant and attractive. The food is decent and so are the drinks. What sets it apart from other places is the fact that this place is very light on the pocket. 
Overall, one could spend an evening at this place sitting either inside or out in front of the vibrant rainbow coloured wall.

This place can be easily located owing to its rainbow-colored exteriors. A small but spacious place, Kafe Bindass has a very regular ambiance, no unnecessary dim lights and all (considering it is a hookah joint; or maybe because we went in the afternoon). The hookah was really nice. You cannot help but notice the unique way of their food presentation. A plate of French fries is served in cone-like vessels, which I thought was very creative. Very different. Oh and the wall posters  and the rule board - you are sure to be amused. Plus, what better than a game of FIFA? Also excellent music choice, I am stealing the playlist when I come here again! 
I shall totally try more dishes the next time. Good service and standard pocket pinch too, not disappointed at all.

visited this place with my friends on 1st jan 2016 for hangout.

this place used to be one of the best hookah cafes in kolkata sometimes back.

but now this place has downgraded its quality and mostly its service to their loyal customers.

the new staffs are very rude and they dont value their customers.

they dont have fear of management also if we complain for service and quality they simply reply back rudely this simply show the lack of professionalism in their staff. 

its time for management to train their staff to behave with customers or else Kafe bindass will soon loose their brand value and their valuable customers.

it was a pathetic experience.

i will advice other not to visit this place who want good customer service along with hookah/foods.

i will advice other not to visit this place who want good customer service along with hookah/foods.

It was one of those nights me and our gang jus needed to sit down somewhere and talk trash :D.I loved this place,it was kindah canteen for my frnds who studied in a nearby college & were regular.It was a lovely small place not meant for a big group if its too crowded.Hookah ws bang on,staff were very cordial in providing us more chocolates in our hot chocolates ;) and potato fries were tasty.Personally the only thing that attracted me was the small outdoor seating they have,very cool ambiance for an adda session.

Kare bindass better known as KB, A place where Xaverian pass there leisure time, Which  they hardly get. üòÅ
after Renovation KB has made its quality oh hookah and it's service as well as the ambiance better off. It's a nice spot to visit though it's always filled with Xaverian and all the private and political issues are discussed people can still visit and enjoy their time.

Small and compact.
Average hookahs, and cheap price. Nice starters.
A good place for the jdbi bba people to chill out for a break during the classes.
Not a place to get ready and come to chill.
A regular cafe.
Overall it is good.

Shit place I have been ever..
Had ordered the so called "RedStrawberry" moctail which was pathetic to the core .on  complaint the staff who consider himself to be too smart says "Its what you have ordered not  what we have recommended you" & he denied replacing & communicated that the staff salary will b deducted . Hats off to " not so bindaas cafe".
Coming to the food we ordered chilli garlic american corn which was not upto the mark. 
The veg pasta was JUZ JUZ OK when u r too hungry otherwise can b avoided. 
Highly irrecomended place!

Next to my office . dropped in with a colleague for snack n hookah. 1st thing on arrival they told us chefs are on leave so most of the item on food menu is unavailable. We settled for grilled chicken sandwich and American corn sandwich along with hookah. Hookah arrived within 15 mins and within next 15 mins the flavour was gone. What we were inhaling was only smoke. Finally after a long wait of over  1 hour to our utter surprise a plate full of american corn came  where actually we ordered clearly sandwich. It took another 20 mins to replace the order . service is totally pathetic. Quality too.  Would never recommend anyone nor we will ever come back.

This place must have got a makeover but sadly enough it's just the interiors. Shitty service, to start with and pathetic quality of food. Me n my friend went there n ordered for a kit kat shake to beat the heat but guess what the shake was sour and there were absolutely no traces of kit kat. Next we tried our luck on American corn which was still edible but nothing great really. I will never visit this place ever again. No, thank you ! Haha.

Went to this place on 25th eve with frnds...first thing...d place definitely needs a makeover...decor was pretty avrg...hwevr d bluish hue lighting somehow manages to maintain d feel... music selection is okay...d food just manages to tickle ur taste buds.

The hookah however was good...especially brain freeze and double apple...

Pocket pinch comes at around 200 per head...which is well within budget fr ppl looking fr economical throw outs.

wana ¬†try hookah? spare yourself. stay away from this place. this place, kafe bindas, used to be one of the best hookah cafes in town but that was long ago. management issue or something entirely else, i do not know, but his place has downgraded to being a completely deserted at times. Service quality has hit a nadir. hookah chokes almost every now and then. food is decent though. pricing is affordable. but one wouldn't want to pay the price they charge for almost nothing. avoid this place. It's time the management either shuts it down or reincarnate it to stay in competition. but as far as i can presage, this place has no future .

Visited this place with my mumbai cousins who wanted to try hukka around 10 in the night and this was the closest of the lto. Where he was enjoying his hukka. I ordered a veg grill sandwich along with red bull, and crispy chilly babycorn. The sandwich was below average. And the babycorn was decent. The place was filled with smoke which I cant complain about as its a hukka joint. Though my cousin did enjoy the pan flavored hukka. The place was just decent and nothing great.

Kafe Bindass a long time ago meant good sheesha,fun evenings and decent food.Current state of the place is bad sheesha and not so good food.Kafe bindass located in moira street,is close to bean it up, and jdbi college/BHS school.
The interiors are not well maintained anymore and the place cries for a renovation.Their quality of sheesha has detoriated a lot.Their menu is no longer exciting.They dont seem to revamp the menu or the interiors considering that so many new places with exciting food options and good interiors are open now,not far from this place. 
The prices are pretty decent here,but id rather pay double and eat good stuff and enjoy the good atmosphere than come here. 
This place needs to pull up their socks and get back in the food game!

Kafe bindass is located near birla high school/ jdbi or just beside bean it up, theatre road. They serve sheesha and good food at accommodating prices. The main reason for this cafe to run is because of its location and the young college people who visit it regularly.

Coming to the pros and cons of kafe bindass:-

Pros :- 
1) serves good sheesha
2) located at prime location 
3) provides delicious food at reasonable price
4) decent ambience
5) staffs are polite


Cons:-
1) sometimes there is a problem with sheesha
2) the place cannot accommodate big groups.(seating capacity is not too great) 

Rest all is well. :)

From an affordable, enjoyable cafe to downright pathetic - This is how KB has gone down the hill! Was a regular at their Lake Road outlet before it shut shop. Initially used to thoroughly enjoy their Chicken Sandwiches, Coffees and the hookah. Starting at Rs.30/35 the sandwiches were dirt cheap and filling too. So were the potato wedges. Friendly staff and clean cafe was a big bonus as well.

However, now the food has become crappy to say the least. Stale bread, no fillings, increased prices (still affordable though), pathetic service are a regular fare. From a once regular, I have now shifted loyalty to better cafes springing up all over the city. Sorry, but I am NOT going back again.

Kafe Bindass is a very nice cafe but just not like CCD. 
The Cranberry Juice was just wow!
Then the strawberry soda and masala cola was great.
The chocolate muffin is a must try..The walnut brownie with chocolate sauce is awesome(i am feeling hungry :p)
Pizza barbecue was good too.
The cappucino was really well done.
Ambience is cool and staff is polite.
3,5 from me.
