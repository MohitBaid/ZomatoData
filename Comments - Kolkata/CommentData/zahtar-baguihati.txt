I got to know about this restaurant from nearby and I bought the nearby voucher which cost 449 for a 5-course non veg Chinese Dinner.
The quality of foods they offer are excellent and it's tastes good.
Trust me, the ambience is best than any other budget restaurant.
service is very good and the waiters are very frank and polite and giving the best service and hospitality that I got from them. 
The salad they provide is excellent and one should try them at least for a single time and you won't regret my review after that.
overall, it was a very very good experience till date, wish I could visit that restaurant every week.

Worst place to go..very poor service..very unproffesional...i would recommend never to go with your dear ones. Maximum times they don't have the options to serve.

Went there on a Saturday noon for lunch and ended up ordering their  chicken dhania shorba, chicken pahari kebab , aloo Chaat , masala kulcha , daal makhani , chicken lababdar , pulao , vanilla ice cream with darshan. I liked their chicken pahari kebab the most.it was juicy and succulent . Chicken dhania shorba was tasted good too. Loved their masala kulcha which they served along ghee. Bt I didn't like their chicken lababdar.it was too sweet for my taste. Bt the star of the show was the dessert. I loved it. I like to visit this place again.
Pros :
1.awesome decor
2.value for money
Cons:
1.slow seevice

Zahtar is the in house restaurant of the Maureen hotel. Let me start off by saying that it's a gorgeous restaurant. It's new, it's well decoreted and very well maintained. When it comes to look and feel this restaurant deserves the highest marks.

Coming to food. This was my first visit to Zahtar, and we had ordered Chinese :üîµ crispy chilli baby corn üî¥ chicken drumsticks üî¥chicken fried riceüî¥American chopsuey üî¥ Thai red curry and for dessert we ordered‚è∫Ô∏è vanilla ice cream with darsaan.
The service time was standard.
Both the starters were served in succession and both were amazing taste wise . The crispy chilli baby corn was cooked to perfection. The drumsticks were well cooked which retained the natural moisture of the chicken meat. It was not overdone, which was very good to see.
Chicken fried rice was good and so was the chopsuey which had a very good thickness. The Thai curry had a little too much vegetables for my liking but it too was a well prepared dish.

Vanilla ice cream with darsaan is always a winner when it comes to dessert . We were served a complementary icecream bowl which was on the house. It was a very nice gesture from the restaurant.

Along with quality, the quantity of each items served was quite nice. The price is very reasonable and the service was very good. I was mighty impressed with Zahtar. Highest recommendation from my side. Keep up the good work :)

Though I am a fan of¬† ZAHTAR I wouldnt rate this as a top notch restaurant in KOLKATA.Food or service quality was exilent. We had ordered two types of non veg appetisers both well prepared dishes with good portions. What annoyed us was the service!The waiter young boy Nitai was in a hurry to serve us and bid us goodbye since it was 10 pm! Well this kind of attitude is not expected from a well known restaurant! Disappointed.i visite it again for service and food quality.

Location- just beside the VIP enclave near to VIP big bazaar in baguiati. It is on the road with ample parking space and easily visible. It is located in first place.

Ambience and seating- it is a small seating area with 8 - 10 tables to grab. The ambience is nice and quiet unless you have an encounter with a rowdy family, like we had. Sometimes you can hear few notes of unknown music which may or may not be pleasant to hear.

Food-
1. Murg pahari kebab- the item was nicely grilled and Marinated but felt bit dry. Moreover the quality is good but quantity is too left to be desired.
3/5

2. Murg badam shorba- I really liked this item. It was nicely made with sufficient amount of chicken and generous amount of kaju and different badams in it. The overall quality and quantity was very satisfying. The only downside was the choice of crockery as soups must not be served with normal table spoon. Unethical.
4/5

3. MOTIA PULAO- it looked kind of different Pulao. I am not quite habitual to this taste of this Pulao. Nonetheless it tasted bland and quite difficult to find some taste in it. The quantity was ok for 1.
1.5/5
4. CHICKEN LABABDAR- the chicken was dry and not at all juicy but the gravy was good.
3.5/5
5. DAL MAKHNI- it was nice. Very good and well made and only thing that was good in the whole full course. 4/5
6. BUTTER NAN- it was very thick and overdone.
1.5/5
7.Blue lagoon drink- the drink was not very sweet. I don't like it.
1/5
8. Vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce- it is according to what you can expect. 4/5

Service- they were polite but during our stay at this place, there were many I mean MANY incidents of discrepancies. Intolerable.

Not good.

Overall experience- good but won't be coming back.

Not a very famous restaurant. The Zahtar restaurant is the inhouse restaurant of the Maureen hotel.
The place is amazing, nice decor . Looks like a 4 star restaurant. The people are very nice polite and help with your order a lot.
It was a family dinner with my mother and I took a nearby coupon for a 4 course meal which cost me 449 bucks.
They offered a soft drink, lemon corriander soup ,chili fish for starters, a noodle salad , schezwan noodles , garlic chicken(4 pieces) and darshan with vanilla ice cream.
The quantity of each item is less but overall it's enough for 2.
Now comming to the food. The soup was amazing, the fish was nice too, the noodles and chicken item were average.
The salad was very bad , but the darsan made for it.
My mother was pleased with the service and food, so to the management ... Keep up the good work.

Very frankly saying I had no idea about this place till I went there...it was ashthami night and we around 5 of us were planning to dine in a pocket friendly place....we just came across this restaurant and thought of giving it a try...though the appearance seemed to be on a higher side but zomato helped us with the menu and we found it pretty reasonable. Now coming to the food we dint got any continental dishes though they agreed for a Russian salad since the chefs were not available at that time so we ordered for Indian basically
Starter
1. Crispy chili babycorn
2. Crispy chilli chicken
Main course
1. Butter nan 
2. Chicken Bharta 
3. Murg rara Punjabi
4. Chicken Reshmi butter masala
5. Russian salad
We were there till 12 o clock and it was my birthday my friends carried a cake and we celebrated my birthday with the staff they were very sweet to serve a complimentary drink.
Nothing extravagant but an overall nice experience

Sunday's are always lazy where you don't feel like cooking at home. So i had the chance of stopping by The Maureen in baguiati. Honestly the variety was quite but only if the quantity matched the quality. Food variety was so much that one will get confuse from where to start. Food is tasty and celebrating occasions here would be my recommendation. Service was top notch and we were being taken care of well. Ambience was great. I will recommend Zahtar- The Maureen to every one. Also a thank you to Nitai for making our visit more relaxing and enjoyable. He is a great person tbh. 


P.S. management should provide clean clothes to their staffs. Please look into this seriously. Take proper care of your staffs.

There is ample parking space where you can park your vehicles and enjoy your dinning experience. 

Thanks!

Situated between JoraMandir and Big Bazaar stoppage. Do not take the flyover, either you are coming from Ultadanga area or Airport area.

Ambiance is so nice. Staffs are really helpful and caring.

All the food items were really tasty. We ordered Chicken Pahadi Kebab, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Murgh Lababdar, Naan, Pulao and Darsaan with Vanilla Ice Cream. Lababdar was awesome. Gravy was thick and full of butter, making it exceptionally well.

If you are in search of a good restaurant with nice ambiance in VIP road, you can try this restaurant.

Zahtar is a part of a lavish Hotel Maureen, located on the main strip of VIP Road. Do not take the VIP Road Flyover on your way the restaurant.
The restaurant is spacious and beautifully decorated. A comfortable seating arrangement has been maintained.

Talking about the food, Manchow Soup was excellent with nice input of Black Pepper. Crispy Chilli Babycorn was also good enough.
Manchurian Balls in Gravy and Hong Kong Noodles were a nice combination and tasted really well.
Darsaan was a bit burnt and over caramelized.

Service was decent.

Visited on the day of jamai shasthi this year. They were offering special lunch/dinner thali at a reasonable price. Almost every thing was present starting from mocktail ,luchi, dal, rice,naan to chicken, mutton, dessert. And I must say each item was tasty to some extent. It is unfortunate that nowadays some newly opened four or five star restaurants are serving tasteless dull food from buffet counter at a very high price. But that was not the case here.Interior was spacious and waiters were friendly. One of them named Kishanlal was very  helpful and guided me to finish the meal.

Went for a family dinner. Quiet and minimalist ambiance. Comfortably small sized restaurant.Ordered chicken lemon coriander soup, hot and sour chicken soup, crispy chilli baby corn, chicken drumsticks, garlic chicken,chilli fish,mixed fried rice,mixed halka noodles nd darshan. The food was pretty good. Special mention for lemon coriander soup,garlic chicken,chilli fish and fried rice. Everything was very well cooked and very nice. Special mention for the exceptional service. We were served by a young chap named Nitai...Who was extremely courteous and made our evening a bit more special. We were the last customers but he dint show a single frown and continued to serve till pretty late. As we were a bit late, he made sure we were served all we ordered before the kitchen closed. Even if it mentions Tht the place serves 24hrs make sure you are there latest by 10pm or you may not get what you order as the chefs leave. Will definitely go back for more.

The service was very good,  starting from arranging the seats to our comfort, to serving some papad with some salad n green chutney to keep us munching while our Main Course was a little delayed.. The service deserves a 5‚ú°Ô∏è. 

We ordered Chicken Clear Soup,  really good,  as a clear soup should be. Then Salt n Pepper chicken, loved it.  In main course ordered Chilli Garlic Noodles(Mixed) n Lamb in Red Thai Curry with Streamed Rice.  Noodles was good, although I didn't like the Thai Curry and I tried this Thai Curry for the first time n they assured this is the authentic flavour of a Thai Curry so I can't actually blame the chef.  üòã
We ended with Gulab Jamun n Ice cream. Wanted to have Caramel Custard but was not available. The Gulab Jamun is a must try. 

Aside to Management,  please get the Continental availability sorted,  we went there with a mind set of Continental Dinner and adjusted to Chinese, which we don't regret though. üòâüòâ

The service , ambience and food quality with adequate quantity is awesome. Specially The service boy name nitai is very well mannered and serving the food in well decorated way. According to food quality the price is cheap,  specially the desert was superb i. E.  Darshan with vanilla ice cream. I will rate 10 star to the boy nitai as well as the restaurant also , who suggest our yummy food item.

Went for a family dinner. Quiet and minimalist ambiance. Comfortably small sized restaurant.Ordered chicken lemon coriander soup, hot and sour chicken soup, crispy chilli baby corn, chicken drumsticks, garlic chicken,chilli fish,mixed fried rice,mixed halka noodles nd darshan. The food was pretty good. Special mention for lemon coriander soup,garlic chicken,chilli fish and fried rice. Everything was very well cooked and very nice. Special mention for the exceptional service. We were served by a young chap named Nitai...Who was extremely courteous and made our evening a bit more special. We were the last customers but he dint show a single frown and continued to serve till pretty late. As we were a bit late, he made sure we were served all we ordered before the kitchen closed. Even if it mentions Tht the place serves 24hrs make sure you are there latest by 10pm or you may not get what you order as the chefs leave. Will definitely go back for more.

Went there for lunch one rainy afternoon. Located on the first floor of the Maureen hotel, this restaurant had a wonderful view of the cityscape through the glass panes. The decor is sophisticated yet comfortable.
We ordered both Chinese and Indian. Chinese ones included: chicken hot and sour soup, lemon coriander soup, fried noodles salad, Hong Kong noodles, chicken drumsticks. Loved them all.
Indian ones:  murgh badami shorba( didn't like it much), murgh dhania shorba, Pahari kebab, chicken tikka lababdar,motia pulao. 
The Chinese ones taste much better than the Indian ones at large.
For dessert,we had gulab jamuns,which clearly stole the show,Darshan with vanilla ice cream,and scoops of chocolate ice cream. 
Recommended!

The decor and its soothing ambience are the key features of Zahtar.
Bright lights, spacious and beautifully decorated indoors, quilted seats.

Conveniently situated just opposite to Big Bazaar, VIP Road with ample parking space. Its on the 1st floor of Hotel Maureen.

The ordered dishes were superbly done.
Kebabs with just perfect grilling. The portions served were sufficient, generous in quantity.

I was completely blown away by their choice of ingredients and the way each of them are being treated here. The cuts, the sears, the frying, the measurements, everything is just right.

Service was brisk , staffs were courteous and the food - scrumptious.
What more can a diner ask for. 

Hope to see more delicious offerings pelting out from Zahtar's Kitchen. Recommended !!

Situated in the first floor of Zahtar building, this place is easily locatable as it is situated opposite of VIP Bigbazaar. 
Interior decoration is really nice with good lighting and furniture. Courteous and humble stuff. 

Food qualities were strictly ordinary and they need to improve their depth of spice in foods. I like the garnishing on foods though. Here is what we ordered and their corresponded rating: 
Murgh Badami Shorba - 2.5/5 
Aloo Chana Chat - 1.5/5 
Chicken Pahari Kebab - 3/5 
Chicken Reshmi Kebab - 3.5/5 
Fish Amritsari -3/5 
Fish Koliwara -3.5/5 
Dal Panchmel -3.5/5 
Dal Makhani -2/5 
Steam Rice 
Masala Kulcha -3.5/5 
Darshan with Vanilla Ice Cream -4/5

Inspite that we have ordered all the foods at once, the food serving time was a bit high.

I have went to this place on Bengali New Year. We had coupons from Nearbuy for a Bengali Thali including mutton, chicken, prawn, fish paturi and other bengali dishes. Except for Basanti pulao I didn't like any of the foods. They clearly discriminate people coming in with coupons as I have witnessed.

But the ambience is good.

I wouldn't recommend this place. Overall 3/5.

Things wich i tried were blue lagoon as starter drink, den as starter i had harabhara kebab, aaloo chana chaat. Again in main course i liked tawa veg, stuffed kulcha & paneer butter masala. Good place for big get together, very spacious.

It's the time to appreciate again, but this time for our home cuisine i.e. bengali. Been there for having our Bengali New Year Lunch with some lovely people and they gave their best. Coming to the foods, From polao to Komolavog each and every item was magnificent, they served in a Bengali manner which was very stunning and trust me (if you're from Beng family you'll understand) first time I felt myself as a son-in-law without being so. This memory gonna drag me here again. The staffs were very courteous, decent, helpful and ambience was no doubt good. I'd like to recommend everyone to be there not only having Beng cuisine but also they have an ample of dishes from variety of cuisines those you can have. Keep it up.

This restaurant does not have quite the depth of spicy, North Indian food. However the ambience is very pretty and sophisticated also Courteous staff with polite and friendly behaviour. And this place can be easily located in the VIP Road area. 
They have variety in their menu however I feel they specialise only in bengali food. Food can be little more spicy and they need to include fancy mocktails and desserts in their menu.

The food was very well cooked Nd dal makhni was very tastey

We have visited Zahtar 3-4 times since its inception. The quality of food is really good with the prices not being too high. We have tried their Chinese and Indian cuisine and both are equally good. The lemon coriander soup needs a special mention and i would suggest everyone to try it while one is at Zahtar. Murg malai kabab and butter chicken were lip smacking during our last visit. The Chinese starters Crispy Chicken and Drums of Heaven also deserves a thumbs up. We quite like the location and ambience of the restaurant.
But we are really not impressed with their service. If you are in a hurry, this is not the right place for you. You should be prepared to wait till you are served with your food. Overall, it is a nice experience and has room for improvement.

Visited zahtar tonight, for dinner using nearby deal. The only thing I can say I just loved this place.. very peaceful  classic ambience, friendly staff, and the most important thing food  quality and it's quantity.We bought one coupon and it's valid for two person. Quantity is enough for two person  . We will be there for another hangout very soon.

1st impression is the last impression..... 
I am not satisfied at all.... Bought Coupon from nearbuy app.. Thought it would be good 1...But i was wrong. 
Decor... Service.. Good.. 
Food bad.. 
I opted non veg indian meal.. Among them some items were not available, like aam panna sarbat. But they alter it with mocktail... Ok
Soup - murgh Badami shorba - - not so hot and thick.. 
Kebabs-- Reshmi kebab.. Ridiculously cold... There were 4 pieces which is actually half of normal pieces... 
Salad... Fresh green salad... Ok
Main course-- chicken butter masala)not listed in original menue) ... 3 small pieces... Why 3??? (seriously speaking I can make better butter masala than that 1)
Dal - dal panchamal - - ok
Moti polao - - ok... With chunks of panner... Nothing special... 
Deserts - - - hot gulab jamun was good... 

So... Quantity and quality wise bad restaurant... It's more like a section of MAUREEN HOTEL which serve food for the people who stays there... 
I will not go to your place seriously... And will not recommend to any1...
Sadly I brought my nephew to eat... He was really upset..

Visited Zahtar for lunch last week. The ambience was pleasant , seating comfortable and service satisfactory. The seafood chowder soup was really a great start , american bell pepper chicken salad wasn't impressive , fish Portuguese with parsley butter rice was decent , it was a baked dish with fish in a spicy gravy with oodles of cheese , more like an indianized version of a continental item. The truti fruti and juices was okayish as well.Overall It was good for one go.

On the VIP Road, looking for a casual dine with VIP treatment Zahtar - The Maureen is ready with warm welcome as we received recently. Loved the crispy chicken and garlic pepper fish followed by the mixed noodles with shrimp, chicken and egg. We were feeling heavy by then and ended with hot gulab jamoon for the day. Wish to go again.

Looking for a spectacular Casual dine place with an extraordinary ambience? Then Zahtar - The Maureen located in Kolkata is the right place for you. Serving lip-smacking Continental, South Indian, North Indian and Chinese delicacies. We went for a lunch today afternoon.  The ambience was really very classy. We ordered ¬†Crispy chicken, Garlic Pepper Fish in starter. The platter was really very nice in presentation and flavor. ¬†Really they were better than i expected. After than in Main curse we asked for a plate of Mixed Fried Rice along with Fish in Hunan Sauce. The main course was very tasty too. Fried rice was full of shrimps, chicken and eggs. Very nicely done without much oil. As a Bengali Foodie, we just cant stay away from Deserts. Hot Gulab jamuns were really fascinating. ¬†It was so soft ¬†and smooth. Just mouthwatering.¬†
The prices were bit high. Service was bit slow but good. Staff is courteous. Order takes a bit longer time to finally reach table. But it is a bearable delay keeping the quality of food in mind.

Ambiance is really good. Especially in the evening, the place looks really fabulous. Good selection of songs add on to your mood.

I visited this place with my family for a buffet dinner on New year's eve. The restaurant is new and the decor is good and so is the ambiance. The buffet spread consist of cold drinks, ¬†juice, two starters which include chicken reshmi kebab and fish fry (served in the table), two type of pasta, noodles, paneer kadai, butter naan, pulao, chicken bharta and to finish it there was hot gulab jamun.¬†
The food was ordinary but the service was great. The waiters were very humble and continuously asked if we required something.¬†
The pulao was good but the noodles were not. I liked the gulab jamun.

But the overall service time was a bit longer than usual. We had to wait for a bit. The quality was really good. The service was excellent. Overall a must visit one.

Coviniently located on the VIP road this is a relatively New kid in the block, enriching the baguiati area with another restaurant offering semi fine dine experience I would say. This actually is the restaurant section of a well decorated boutique hotel. Though the area is not huge, it is actually quite elegantly decorated. On my first visit I found the glass walls offered view of their elengant hanging lamp shades and the VIP road, which really added to the elegance. Don't know why they covered the wall with curtains which made the place look smaller, in the second visit. Coming to the food, on the first visit I tried their Indian dishes and must say they well very well prepared. The Jeera pulao, soft butter naans and chicken tikka lababdar all deserves a special mention. The fish amritsari however was not at all up to the mark, being dry and smelly. The 2nd visit was a Chinese dine out and that didn't disappoint either. Soups,Starters, main course all were quite a stimulation to the taste buds. Quantities of dishes were enough for 2. Prices were reasonable too. Staffs are courteous. However they have an issue with their AC which often fails to coll the place, this area needs their immediate attention. Worth a visit if u are looking for some good multi-cuisine family dine out place on VIP road!!

I visited this place yesterday for dinner wid my family.. It was a sudden plan nd we opted for this restaurant just because of its menu.. There were enough options to chose from. We went there around 8.30 pm, and no one was present there except us. We had 2 little coupon with us.first of all, there was only one staff who took our order. But he didn't provide any menu card.. As we already visited many restaurant and they gave us a menu card which was particularly made for little customer. But here he just asked me what to order in starter and gave one or two options. Then did same for main course and dessert. I told him that more options were available in little menu bt he replied back that some of the items were not available. As we didn't get fried ice cream.even he forgot to offer mocktail and i asked for the options once again. Number of Pieces of chicken n fish dishes was not mentioned here.that is one mejor drawback.he told me that chicken dish comes with 4 pcs. Bt 8 pcs were given after that.m really thankful for this bcoz we were 4 persons to share 4 pcs? I mean seriously?!! Quantity was average. Pcs were kind of small. But Quality of food was really good.so, small pcs doesnt matter really.starter nd dessert were best. but after coming back home when I checked into zomato to give review, I found from one previous review that salad was also there and by checking the little menu once again I got confirmed that item was missing. They didn't offer us any chicken salad. Mixed noodle/ fried noodle salad was on the little menu. We also missed it but its mainly their responsibility to serve us properly. We bought 2 coupon. That means, we missed 2 plate of salad. It made my experience worst. Its first time that some restaurent didn't give us any menu card plus 2 dishes were not given as we paid for that too. Please be careful. Its not done. M really dissapointed. Staff behaviour was really good. They r courtious n well behaved bt management needs to be improved. Please. Its a huge mistake. M writing the review just to Inform the management that this kind of mistake happened with us. So careless behaviour. Isnt it?! Please, Look into this matter.I was really hoping to visit there again. But this thing happened!!

We went there on Saptami in afternoon for lunch. The hotel is right on main road so it's easy to locate. Ambience was good enough for a budget restaurant like this. When we entered there was no one in the restaurant except the staff. So, if you are looking forward to spend some lonely time then this restaurant is good. Coming to the food, it wasn't up to that level. We ordered Murg Tikka in starter and it was a bit salty but okay. Then for main course we took non-veg hakka noodles with spicy garlic chicken as there was nothing else worth ordering. Overall it was a good experience as the bill was Rs. 900 for two.

Being Navami wanted to check out The Maureen. As we stepped in the hotel it was very cold the A/C was chilled, we were informed the restaurant Zahtar was on the 1st floor. We checked in @ 7.09pm and got seated showed the nearby voucher and waited for the dinner buffet. We were served welcome drink ( soft drink) without our consent if we wanted it or not. The menu had blue lagoon as well as aampanna when asked said not prepared yet??? Than came the soup again without our consent if we wanted spinach or herbal soup. Though the soup was good enough. The entire restaurant was empty and it was 8.10 PM we had been waiting for a good 40 mins now for the starters to be prepared????? This was intolerable we dint have the time to stay long. Finally the starters arrived angari fish tikka ( Indian salmon with bones tandoori marinated)??? Doesn't go at all??? What a pathetic dish...Murgh Makhmali Kabab was ok but too salty. In fact the veg starters were good enough. The menu had 5 types of salad but only 2 were displayed I.e. chana aloo chaat & green salad??? Now comes the main course.... Fish in schezwan sauce was missing. Murgh Rarah was too salty. All Mans curry was too good tasted well with the navratna pulao... But when it came to the meat was horrifying large bones with only fats no solid meat... I mean w*f is this what you serve??? There were around 20 pieces of big bones and fat and no solid meat??? Guess the chef was sleeping while cooking or kept it aside for party.coming to bread kulcha was not made????? On desserts Darshan was not provided??? So was achar and pappad not made in accompaniments. Overall 10 items were not provided from the set menu... And yes forgot the A/C was only switched on after an hour and half when we were sweating profusely. Finally we had ice cream and left @ 10.07pm when finally we saw a couple arrived for dinner, a good 3 hours where no one was around us. Very bad experience for a hotel which is just a month & a half old... Please learn

Guess the chef was sleeping while cooking or kept it aside for party.coming to bread kulcha was not made????? On desserts Darshan was not provided??? So was achar and pappad not made in accompaniments. Overall 10 items were not provided from the set menu... And yes forgot the A/C was only switched on after an hour and half when we were sweating profusely. Finally we had ice cream and left @ 10.07pm when finally we saw a couple arrived for dinner, a good 3 hours where no one was around us. Very bad experience for a hotel which is just a month & a half old... Please learn

Well the ambience is the best part look like a star category hotel though not much expensive.  In fact the restaurant is well within the budget. They were accepting nearby voucher on an ashtami night as well.  Less crowded I have easily avoided puja crowd and long waiting.  Quality of food is OK not great not bad. A long way to go because during a puja night if a restaurant is almost empty some serious marketing measures should be taken.

Ambience is superb. As this is Durga Puja time so it's very over priced. The price did not match with the price mentioned in zomanto. Good was good. Its near my house so its a cool place to dine in.

Awh!!!!! How can I forget the moment. One of the nice restaurant of kolkata must be visit. Well decorated restaurant at the first floor of The Maureen Hotel. From Manager and Staffs are awesome and co-operative. Now lets look on the food. I have ordered Chinese, They actually made a Indo-Chinese Cuisine that makes a perfect taste for Bengalee food lover. Just like me :-) You should try once Fried noodles :-). I will take a second visit for this particular reason :-D¬†
Location - Opposite of FBB and Vishal Teghoria / Joramandir. Or Just near Bika Banquet. ¬†

Well, On a personal note, This is also a fine dine Restaurant. Believe me they don't make any partiality :-)

Shatabdi ( Restaurant Manager ) and Co. - Kudos !!!

A very cozy and a nice place to have a meal, though i have spent most of the time gossiping with my friends here and sipping to the lovely tea which they served me. Will definitely come back to taste all of their cuisines.

The place is conveniently located near the airport, the menu has great variety and the entire restaurant has a very warm feeling about it, the staff, the food everything is good, I recommend trying out their North Indian and continental dishes, they are pretty good and food is hygienically served , would love to come back here to try more of their dishes.

The best Indian and Chinese food available near the kolkata airport. It is relatively a new properly situated inside a three star hotel (actually the fine-dine area of the hotel itself) but it is not restricted to guests staying at the hotel only. ¬†The behaviour of the staff was nice and the rates compared to the quality of the food and the ambiance was fine for me. Make sure try the "chicken hariyali kebab" (which is given in the picture below) is out of this world!
