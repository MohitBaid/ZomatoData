I will never again visit this counter... Wasted my money the cold coffee was horrible ice water served with pinch of coffee, scoop of cream ( may be) and stale milk, smelling like curd... The pasta was 'yaaaaaak'... Why do the serve pasta when they don't have any idea about how to cook the dish... I mean they can sell daal roti... Which are the familiar with... There is no option for 0 so I have to give 1... Most horrible part was they started reasoning and insulting when I complained about their quality... 

Don't ever go to this counter friends

A waste of money basically. The beverage was worse than my home made juices. The service is not up to the mark. They should improve on their shop name at least. Menu is horrible I must say. No recommendations as you can understand.

Hello there,the most horrible pasta I ate today (in the Avani Riverside mall Howrah, top floor food court ). Suchhh a wonderful experience that from next time, when Ill come here again, I will stay 5ft away from this shop. If you have Enerzy, and you really wanna eat something good don't come here to waste your money. You will get so sweet tasted pasta, almost tastes like desert, half boiled uncooked vegetables, the food is falling down from your plate. What else do you want? Last but not the least we ordered for chicken pasta with white sauce. Guess what? We got some sugary uncooked VEG pasta. He didnt even inform us the counter is for veg only! Bingo! If Wanna kill your enemy in so many ways, invite him/her here :D

I had the opportunity to have the cold pasta salad at this joint. It was made with fresh ingredients and it was good for the price at being which it was offered. i wouldn't mind though if they provided a bit of lettuce in the salad instead of just cabbage and charge extra for lettuce if they wish to.Â 

The staff who prepared the salad was very sparing with the salad dressing and had to be constantly goaded to add enough of it. If they quit being niggardly am sure this place will pick up pace.

the orders should be served more efficiently and the milkshake had more ice than milk......it tasted bland rather than sweet. So it would really be proper if they serve the beverages on time
