I purchased the ladoo on 26 November 2017 from Bhikharam chandmal, kankurgachi. and when I opened the box in home, whole box with laddo was Termite (Deemak) affected. I just cant believed how poor quality food Bhikharam Chandmal are giving and playing with our and our children life and health. Just see the video and images yourself I attach herewith. how can they sell sweets in such manner I just dont get it. even if anyone just take box in hand you will able to see the whole box condition so how can their shop people selling them. I have doubt about their sweets freshness. Its not possible that Termite (Deemak) affect the box so huge in 1-2 days. I highly recommend to avoid buying anything from Bhikharam Chandmal.

The food is so tasty. The quality and quantity of food is really impressive. The ambience is good. The value for money is a little bit high. But over all the food is good.

Located at Kankurgachi crossing.
It is one of the famous food joint in Kankurgachi, serving veg food and sweets. We visited it today for some breakfast and opted for veg pasta and veg corn sandwich. The taste was good but the was horribly less. It was not even enough to fulfill a five years old appetite, for sweets we took the kesar malai chamcham which was fresh and yummy. The service is okayish and the pocket pinch was moderate.

It is one of the busiest food joint at kakurgachi more. Lots of seating arrangement is there for variery of veg items such as dahi vada, pau-bhaji, crispy baby corn, dhoka, chawmin, chole batora, lassi, kulfi etc. Quality of food is good but pocket pinch is high more over service is not upto the mark.

Sweets from Bhikharam are a part of our everyday dinner. 
Everything is amazing. It does not need a review.

Just one item should be mentioned in the 'should try corner' of zomato- the specially made raas bhara boondi during Ganesh Chaturthi.

My family cannot get over this place. :D

THANK YOU!

Bhikharam is mostly a good option for a quick snack. Some of their snack items are good. Their service is prompt. And mainly they have lots of variety in sweets and namkeens. However, this particular outlet has limited sitting arrangement, and at times their tables/spaces are filled with trays and sweets meant for delivery.

Tried Bhikharam Chandmal for the first time. I had a Kaju Barfi, Mawa Kesar Pedha and some chanachur. The barfi wasn't tasty. No hint of kaju at all. The chanachur was okay. Tilting more towards the sweeter side. The kesar pedha was lovely!

Location-Kankurgachi,Kolkata.

This outlet of bhikharam chandmal is divided into two sections one for mithai purchase and another is a small seating area for snacks.Its a huge and spacious outlet where you will find people buzzing through out the day to purchase their sweets and bhujia.

Service-Inspite of being so crowded the service at this place is quite fast.They have a separate billing counter which fastens the process of serving and packaging.

Food-The food at this place is quite good.We usually have snacks at this place and sweets ocassionally.We love their-
1:Puchkas
2:Kachoris
3:Matar puff
4:Papdi chaat

Food-4/5
Service-4/5

All we can say is that they provide good food and service at a reasonable price.😃😃

Best part is they serve you fresh as well as tasty products. Recommend.

One of those sweet shops, which is hard to miss if you are near Kankurgachi Signal, Spacious and huge, they serve a variety of sweets and snacks. This place is always buzzing with people trying to purchase their sweets, or their packed Bhujias. Their Thalis, Samosas and other food items are equally popular. I mostly try their Laddoos and Rabdis if I am around. :-)

Bhikharam Chandmal seta right in competition with with Haldirams, both being leaders in traditional vegetarian food and snacks.

Located at CIT Road and Kankurgachi crossing, the outlet is pretty spacious. I have visited the Salt Lake outlet and found it to be way better in comparison.

Coming to the food, nothing was extraordinary. Everything tasted normal.
The place is really unhygienic and uncleaned. The prices might be lesser than Haldirams but the quality diminishes too.

Located at CIT Road and Kankurgachi crossing, the outlet is pretty spacious. I have visited the Salt Lake outlet and found it to be way better in comparison.

Coming to the food, nothing was extraordinary. Everything tasted normal.
The place is really unhygienic and uncleaned. The prices might be lesser than Haldirams but the quality diminishes too.

Overall a fine experience. An Ideal Location at Kakurgachi crossing on the way pass by. I had pasta burger, spring roll and Singara and fruit sandesh for "choti bhuk" . Price is quite reasonable with a very small sitting area. Self service so staff is not so much hospitable

This place is equally favourite of mine. Lots if deliciousness. Tried their dry fruit sandesh, kaju barfi, perah, traditional laddoos, dahi vada and kachori chaat. The quality is good. Price is reasonable. The ambience is nice, air-conditioned. Sitting area is good.

Located right at the Kankurgachi crossing, this place is easy to locate. 
Mainly known for its mithais desserts, this place also serves up great dosas and dhoklas. I like their Indian dishes more than their chinese thalis or sandwiches.

Location : Very near kankurgachi circle

Decor - Simple. There are few seating space. There are only wooden seats.

Service - Prompt

Foods Ordered - Club Kachori & Dhokla

Description - I feel I am going here for ages. At one time it had monopoly in that area. There was no tiwari nearby. No other similar show in saltlake laketown bangur area. It serves varieties of snacks & sweets. Went there on a weekday morning for a casual breakfast. Club kachori was good. Dhokla is excellent. I always love them. 
Overall good experience. Recommended.

I hv read in the zomato.com that bhikaram provides home delivery facilities but when I ring to the given number they said that there is no home delivery facility in any of the bhikaram outlet. I m bit annoyed with the information provided in the zomato.com. If any of the facility is not available in any restaurant then it should not be mentioned in the zomato.com.

Nothing can beat the bhujiya of bhikharam chandmal. They had variety of sweets and snacks and also they serve desi thali. All are incredibly amazing. I prefer most their bhujiya, gulab jamun, lassi etc. It was one of the most favorable restaurant of mine. Highly recommended personally to all rajasthani snacks and sweets lover.

Its my first review here on Zomato and I am very sad to give a worst review about BHIKHARAM CHANDMAL,KANKURGACHI.worst service ever got at BHIKHARAM CHANDMAL,KANKURGACHI .first of all the cashier was too rude and not well behaved ,he charged us extra for packing charge i mean to say that we had our Dinner there itself still he charged us extra .
Then there was no coordination between the staffs and food was also not proper as it was stale and they just served like that and  rather complaining for that they didnt listen .
never wanna visit again .

From jelabi to kachori,from dhokla to dahi bada, from pedas to kaju barfi, this branch has a vast array of renowned sweet....so basically one can find the mixture & texture of South & North under in one roof... 
Not only their sweet array is great but they also make decent savories.. All I can say its provided good food for a very reasonable price..A budget place with a very good variety.. The options available are not plenty but the quality and taste is not compromise..
They have the standard non Bengali range of sweets.. As is the kaju barfi when freshly made.. They quite have a wide range of pre-packaged savories such as chips, bhujiyas, mixture, sonpapdi etc as well as mini samosas also...

It also serve pure ghee made rich north Indian thali for lunch which is yammy. This outlet has large variety of snacks and sweets alongwith South Indian foods. I also recommend it's kesher Peda and Rasmalai.

A saviour for Vegetarian people. All sweets are awesome but Chandrakala is the best for me(although a little too sweet). Service is awesome. The only place where you would love Gol Gappe(Puchka) with Pudina Pani. Even Paw Bhaji and Other food items are worth eating. Clean and healthy environment. Club Kachoris and Jalebis are one of the best of this place in Kolkata. But not so pocket friendly. Stuffs are a bit costlier than other shops. Son Papdi is a must try.

Location--near kankurgachi crossing
Food--well it offers a huge variety of sweets,snacks and meals which are more or less good...things which according to me worth trying are Dhoklas,Khandvis,radhballabi,rajkachoris,chaats,vada pao..
The sweets are of good quality..especially I love their rasamalai and barfis..
Their samosas and kachoris are good too
Cost--Moderate
Overall a nice place to visit when you want some good snacks at a modest price..

Bhikharam Chandmal is a well known place for sweets and deserts.Their laddoos and sonpapri is marvellous and mouthwatering. In milk special items,Rabri and rasmalai is simply delicious and delightful. Their new Laccha is a thing you can't miss,it is rich but superb and succulent, a perfect dish for iftaar and eid party.

Have been visiting this place since childhood, but reviewing it for the first time.
Purchased some lachcha paranthas, khasta kachoris and sambhar vada on 26 June, 2015. Had the paranthas with some home-made gravy and it tasted just awesome. Again, ate the kachoris as home-made "chats", which tasted fantastic.
Prices are on a higher side, but still ok - given the limited options for vegetarians in this area. Service is more often slow than not.
Seating area is again a bottleneck - however, nothing deters the "DOG" customers of this outlet from visiting here again and again.
CHEERS !!!!

This place is very close to my dad's office so when ever there is any occasion in our house the sweets come from this place. 
It is typically a North Indian sweet shop selling all kinds of typical North Indian and Rajasthani snacks.
In sweets the Laddu , Sonpapri , Kaju Barfi, Badam Barfi, are the best. Peera is also good. Apart from all these one of the personal favourite is the Balusahi, and the Khasta Kachouri. The place also sell packed snacks like chanachur. The best one being the sweet and sour flavour. 
While haldiram is not costly this place is tasty as well as cost effective. 
This place is a must try.

This delightful pure veg sweet shop is close to my place and falls on my way to work. We would buy sweets from here often, but the first time I ate here was in 2008 (don't remember the day, but it was when AILA had hit the city). After being under siege for over an hour, we were bored and hungry. So we decided to grab a quick bite on our way home, as the storm quietly passed over. We ordered a Masala Dosa and a plate of Paw Bhaji that day. They were both excellent, tad oily, but tasty to the core. 
On my subsequent visits I have tried their chats (all pretty good), their Chinese platter (not their forte), and Kachauris (heavenly).
Me being the sweet lover, I also dig their balushahis, jalebis, rabdi, strawberry sandesh, kaju rolls, and colored murabbas.

At one point of time in my life I had developed a taste for vegetarian foods in the city. Consuming a chunk of chicken and eggs everyday and hitting the gym was of no good. And after a late realization I started to stick to vegetarian for a while.

This was the time when my beloved neighbors had treated me to some great breakfast on a fine Sunday morning, at Bhikhaaram Chandmal.
And the best part of all of this was I started getting addicted to their food,and whenever it was a Sunday, the breakfast would comprise more of the food from this restaurant.

Not to forget,this is the only restaurant in Kolkata whose food I have tasted,from all its branches.
If you go in the morning be sure to grab a plate of the club kachori.If you are an hour late,you'll simply miss it.
Even better you can smell the hot jalebis and the fresh milk brewing,for the sweets to be made.

My first time was indeed a wonderful experience and ever since then,I have been a regular at this place.
For those grandmas and oldies in the home,who prefer vegetarian food Bhikhaaram provides the best of masala dosas,samosas and dahi vaadas.

Now coming to the sweets,never leave this place without having the ghee ka  ladoo.Even the fresh gulab jamuns and amritbhogs will mesmerize your taste buds.
In the end all you need is a glass of water to gulp it down.The food is absolutely non-spicy and easy to digest,setting a yardstick to the rest of the sweetshops/restaurants.

For a long time the sweet culture has been growing in Calcutta and with more competitors stepping in,this industry is flourishing in Bengal.
This particular restaurant is very neat and tidy and extremely well maintained. It is good to see how they have kept things tidy along with the A-grade type of food served.
My best wishes to the Bhikhaaram group for making it so good so far,and also for the near future.

Just like Haldiram, Bhikaran Chandmal is another favourite sweet and namkeen shop among the non-bengalis. Though lot of bengalis have started recognizing the shop of late. Their sweet and namkeen variety will make you confuse while selecting. Lot of options available. Gulab jamun and ladoos are couple of their popular items. The place is packed during holi and diwali. They are busy all day. Most of their food is of desi ghee as claimed by them. Price is on the heavier side for sure. But you will not be disappointed with the quality and taste.

Laddoo, moti pak, jalebi, gulab jamun, samosa, kachori, dahi vada...you name it...specialities abound in this magical place on kakurgachi more....I am afraid of getting down in kakurgachi when I take an auto from girish park. This is because I fear getting hypnotized by the smell, entering the shop and gaining zillions of calories. But what a place. Just amazing. It is worht a visit from anywhere in the salt lake area because tis motipaks are that good. My aunt stays in kakurgachi and mwe make it a point to have food from here whenever we go there.

One of my favorite sweet shops in the city . They make very tasty snacks and sweets. Especially love the singhara and the aloo bonda ... This is a frequent place for us during navratri too as they are one of the very few people who make SENDHA NAMAK snacks that can be consumed during a navratri fast. 

On the regular sweets they make awesome motichoor laddus and the dark orange kanpur style boondi laddo is absolutely melt in your mouth . During winters they make delicious gajar ka halwa... loaded in ghee and khoya also they have a good selections of namkeens( munchies) avaiable ... i love buyinh the red chili loaded Spicy potato chips. 

a must try here also is the peda and the kalakand .

Poor service and setup... please avoid. You will spend most of your time running from one floor to another getting your order right.

Too bad place
Staffs are extremly rude and quarelsome. The staffs fight and even abuse customers.
Food quaility is good but they dont prepare food in good way.

I like all the Bhikharams and the Haldirams and I love the food in all these places, This outlet is nothing different. The Chana Bhaturas are a delight. They also keep Mathura Peda which I absolutely love. Remember that all that I ever had from here was takeaway and I did not really face the problems mentioned in the other reviews, w.r.t. communication between food and coupon counters. Maybe I got plain lucky.

A good place for snacks and lassi in the late afternoon.  However, the coupon counter and food counter has poor communication. They really should take care of that.

Very bad customer service. I complained of not having any pineapple in my Special Chowmein but the cook had the audacity to say that he had indeed put in some pineapple.I have to say that my review is futile because according to them I am apparently an idiot who cannot differentiate between the presence and absence of pineapple.

WORTHLESS AS THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS COMMUNICATION GAP BETWEEN SALES COUNTER AND PAYMENT COUNTER. TYPICAL HUF BUSINESS POLICY AND ATTITUDE.

WORTHLESS AS THEY DON'T HAVE ANY COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THEIR SALES COUNTER AND THEIR PAYMENT COUNTER.
