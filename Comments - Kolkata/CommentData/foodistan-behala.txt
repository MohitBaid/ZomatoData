The food is worthless , very very very bad . I simply wasted my money by ordering food from this crap food joint . this is my last time I am having anything from here. I request to all the other people never have food from here . its totally a waste of money . they also don't carry changes with them while doing home delivery . highly dissapointed .

Very very poor quality of food. Don't have it. I had it yesterday and my mom too had it and she said it was causing  her problems though I did not feel anything like that

Only takeaway joint, and value-for-money.

Paneer Tikka Butter Masala- Lots of gravy, beautifully rich and creamy. Ample quantity. Paneer needs to be cooked a bit more though.

Kashmiri Pulav- Found it a bit oily. Lovely fragrance and enough quantity.

Cheese Corn Balls- It was a bit burnt the day I ordered, 'twas an off-day I guess. Was expecting molten cheese inside, but it was dry and had that burnt smell. There were the mandatory cabbage strips. And too spicy for my taste buds.

Fish Finger- Tastes really good, but it's very thin. Really.

Paneer Roll- My favourite, any day. It's non-oily and tastes like achaar. :)

Achaari Paneer Tikka- Was a complete letdown, yeah. Just chunks of paneer marinated in an achaar-smelling gravy. Worst part was, the marination and the paneer seemed completely separated. Could do better.

Chicken Steamed Momo- Complete disappointment. Extremely small pieces, and oily, I dunno why, even though it was steamed. Worse, the chicken filling had a lot of bones.

Fish Salt&Pepper- Loved this. Bite-sized, filling and tasty. :)

Very bad food quality, late service also. Had to wait for 30 mins for an order of 2 naan rotis when I was the only customer at that time. Pathetic.

Pathetic ……during this Durga puja I had taken Chicken Biriyani ,and when we served it for dinner the chicken found half cooked and blood stains at the chicken potion. Immediately I called them, they told sorry ,and assured me to prove the same  next day as it was late, but it was very unfortunate they have provided nothing, moreover when I visited their shop after few day they just misbehaved with me….Strongly not recommended…to all the customers at Satellite Township and near by…. They are treating customer as they are delivering the food at free of cost….Poor services I ever noticed ……
