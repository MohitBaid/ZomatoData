The music was amazing. The drinks and food was okay but the place has a very positive vibe. The DJ was playing old Hindi songs so he took my heart there. Apart from that, the place gets too crowded as there is not much space inside. The management needs to take control of the number of people they allow inside the club. Must Visit again üëçüèª

As one of the usual Saturdays I visited Nocturne being one of my favourite spot as always, with my uncle and aunt.

Unusual was that- the owner suddenly asked us to move out of the place without giving any reason.

YEAH??
That's surprising I know. 
Though I din't really understood what he meant by that, but then ofcouse this absolutely does no fall under any public relations and hospitality of a place so commonly being one's chill out spot in Kolkata.

Being this famous I expect some customer care and decency out of this place.
like seriously what the heck was that??

So guys next time when you go to Nocturne beware that the owner Anshuman is not around. Or else you never know....

A fun night out with friends is guaranteed here. Hulks, drinks and good music to dance the night away

One of the best clubs in kolkata. The interiors has the signature style of wooden finish all over giving it a classy look. The bar is pretty long and is easy to grab a drink or so. Lovely music with great visualisations are the forte of this club. Gets jam packed on friday and saturday night usually. They serve sheesha too with some select lipsmaking food on offer. My recommendations for this place. üòä

Great Music, lively environment, good staff, awesome crowd and a nice food what else you need...

But, now the cons, anyone ¬†planning to hit this place on weekdays uhuh a very bad idea must say.
This is place is dull and vacant during weekdays.

Dead on weekdays, Nocturne comes alive on weekends when one barely gets place to dance. It's one of those oldest nightclubs of the town, now desperately in need for polite service and renovation in order to compete with much better newer options in town. 

Nocturne has everything that could have gone right for it: Shakespeare Saraini location, parking space, good acoustics, decent cocktails and legacy. But in a way, Nocturne exemplifies Calcutta's morbid resistance to change, usually euphemized as 'old world charm'. 

An easily avoidable place to party in a town with much better options available everywhere!

This is another place in Kolkata which serves amazing food
The pizzas here are very good.try the oceatta blue which comes with egg.also noteworthy are the keema pao,lemon scampi, thai red curry,kebab platter,hummus with pita,chili paneer.
The coffee here is also good and it's recommended to try haze which is their coffee lounge in the basement for an eat out.the hookah here is also outstanding and pocket friendly too.the staff is polite and well trained. 
All in all imo this nite club cum lounge serves the best food in Kolkata.

There was a time when we use to party a lot and there was even better places than this one to party on a Saturday night but this incident was really shocking I went to this place with a friend of mine and I was denied entry saying that we have to be a regular client here or a member.I mean this is so stupid if I am not going to go here for the first time how will I even go here again and again such a stupid behaviour by the front staff.This proves that night clubs like myx and m bar are doing so well.I would suggest people not to go here if they have some good self respect.

Nocturne has a lot of potential to easily emerge as one of the best night clubs in the city. It's got the right kind of location, square footage, decor, food and beverage offerings, and even hype. But whatever is going wrong with the service man? Why are the waiters least interested in waiting on the guests? The management must surely look into this.

The ambience is phenomenal. The dj is just fabulous. Music and dance is at its zenith. The drinks and hookah are well prepared. Food is good enough. The only reason why i rate it low is because of its service. The bartenders are too slow and they take way long time to bulk in the food and drinks.

Went with group of friends to celebrate my Birthday yesterday (9th Oct 2015) , Club was empty however Manager told us he cant give us entry coz they have policy of 'ONLY MEMBERS ENTRY' on Friday and Saturday , never knows that nocturne is thinking themselves as they are Merlin or Princeton or Calcutta club. Manager was very rude without any reason so we left as we don't want to spoil our mood. If i get a chance I will rate them in negative.. But I like to thank them that due to them we went to Plush Lounge and discover one of the best lounge in city though not a regular club goer but still its far better then Nocturne..

Hey people,
I really wanna tell you.about the horrible experience I had here in nocturne. On 3rd October ie.,Saturday night I called on this number ( 033 3099 0492),provided on Google at around 11pm and the guy who received the call told me that club is open till 2 am and the cover charges is 1500 bucks.so from salt Lake we took around 25 minutes and we reached there at nocturne.. And guess what, that silly staff outside the entrance of the club stopped us from entering the disc  coz only members were allowed that night.. Even after telling him that we had called here earlier and we are ready to pay the cover charges, he didn't even allow us to talk and was really really rude to us..Lemme tell you Nocturne staff that,that was the worst behaviour from your end and you have definitely no respect for your guests.. I will never suggest anyone to visit this place ever again..

We went there to celebrate our IHM reunion. Loved the ambience. The lounge feel is pretty relaxing and the music gets loud after 10 and the crowd starts to build. Although, service is a little slow here, the food is tasty and well presented. Spring rolls, mezze platter, pizzas recommended. ¬†The crowd is pretty decent as they do a lot of profile check. Neat, modern and chic club. Had visuals with psy trance. Pretty cool. Definitely recommended.

More than restaurants,eateries,bars and the likes what defines a nightclub is the crowd it attracts.Nocturne scores here.

Pros : 1. Prime accessible location on theatre road accessible from all sides
2. The happening,spending crowd
3. Good DJ's who understand pulse of the crowd.
4. Decent food ( does anyone really eat in a night club?They munch and here the munchies like pizza are decent)
5. A well stocked bar

Cons : 1. Expensive on weekends
2. Being a small place,when they cordon off an area and seats for regulars you feel like children of a lesser God
3. Housekeeping.Cleanliness becomes an issue during crowded and pukish times
4. Service : You might miss your favourite song while on the trek to the bar to get a beer for your girlfriend.
5. Stag entries.As the evening grows,some swaggering hunks troop in ruining the delicate sex ratio.

However these are my personal opinion and not being a regular party animal( at least no longer ) I would like to give them the benefit of doubt and provide more nocturnal pleasure by the hour!!!!!!Cheers!!!!!

We visited this place on 25 th December,2014. It was for Rs.3000 per couple cover charges. We were 3 couples. After a few orders they told that our cover is exhausted. When we asked for the bill, they gave us a bill for Rs .12000 charge going arbitrarily for the dishes not ordered by U.S. When we protested strongly then only they were ready to change the bill. That was my first visit to this place. please be careful before ordering any thing.

You gotta breathe hard before writing a review for a place like this. Everything in this place has a upper hand. The drinks the food the interior the decor ..... Just the dj is what puts it down. We love in India and not us. What gets us grooving is indian music but you hear only English tracks which kinda starts sucking after long hours. You need Bollywood thumka to keep moving. 

I would recommend it if you are not concerned about your pocket.

Haze, in its all modern renovated avatar opened its door and I went with a bunch of of girlfriends to check out how our old hangout had converted. It looks gorgeous now! With ultra chic mirrored wall interiors and better seating arrangement now, we were quite pleased with the whole feel of the place. Our favorite however, is the inclusion of the much awaited, a bar area within the lounge. 
We had a pitcher of a beautifully marinated sangria, which tasted perfect!

This is a very classy place with its black marble walls and a corporate stint decor. They are on the basement level, under the HDFC building on Theatre Road. Easily accessible from Kala Mandir and Minto Park area. I went with some of my friends, around 5 of us. We had a peg of ballentines each, a large sized thin crust pizza and a kiwi flavoured hookah. They play music and videos together, so it gives watching a cable TV view while you hog and partake in adda.

Nocturne is one of the best pub / lounge / disc in City Of Joy. People like clubbing should hit this place on Fridays & Saturdays. The place goes insane & music played here is killer. A step to the basement is The Haze Lounge which is the best Hookah joint in my eyes with Classy Ambiance and awesome Hookah. The thin crust Pizza served here is the best you get around.The overall Service, Ambiance & Food is great.

I wasn't satisfied with this place. Firstly i called them to enquire about the cover charges and they say stags will be decided on the place and when we reach the place they say its not allowed. And then when i went to talk to the manager, he was ill mannered and rude. If we are suppose to pay them for the charges then why are we suppose to bear the arrogance. Shit place. Don't ever want to visit them again.

I've been to there hookah lounge almost 6-7 times and it's a really nice den. 
It's located in the basement opposite to the Shakespeare sarani police station. 
Parking is ample with valet. 

Ambience:-
The all white interiors with dim lights looks and feels very good.
The red fire water line actually adds a tough guy basement look to the already white interiors. 
The sitting is mostly sofas but not very cozy considering the fact it's a premium lounge. 

Usual order:-
Hookah---5 paan is a must here and is server with 2 chillam. One of the best hookahs I've smoked. 

Food:-
It's no place for gourmet meals so no complaints. Mostly finger foods.

Mozzarella cheese sticks: FANCY food. The cheese is full but overall very average.

Sandwiches: Ok 

Calzone: Tastes very bland with cottage cheese and spinach inside. Avoid

Drinks:-
This is the best part.

Espressotini: A must have for kahlua lovers. Sweet and a heavenly cocktail.

Beer: serves pint only but very expensive( considering you know the market price) and add 27% liquor tax to the already hiked price. Not fair. 

Wine: have ordered sula white wine by glass. Jacobs Chardonnay  by the glass is ‚Çπ750 plus liquor tax whereas sula is around 350-360 plus liquor tax. So the choice is yours.  

Drinks NOT accompanied by some free bar munchies.

Staff:- very courteous and helpful. Takes very good care of the guests. 

Pocket pinch:- ‚Çπ2400 for 3 

PS: the 4 star is justified for there hookah, cocktail and definitely the lounge atmosphere.

This has to be the most stupidest place on earth.

Reason - 
A) if you are going to allow only regualrs on a weekend - keep a board outside which says so
B) teach your staff how to talk to people..
The kind of attitude they have , is just not right

Nocturne is one of the best lounge/nightclub I have been to in kolkata. It excells in all the departments like music, drinks, food and most importantly the crowd. Ambience is also really cool with dim lights which is a trademark for any nightclub. Its reallly a good place to go out for a drink and snacks. The crowd is always lively. The service here is also good. And about the Haze which is located underground serves amazing sheesha and food. Overall I had amazing experience at Nocturne.

Love the ambience here. The lounge feel here set the party mood in effortlessly. Although, service is a little slow here, the food is perfectly satiating and well served. Being a vegetarian, I had ordered crispy chilly baby corn which was crispy in every way and perfectly spiced. The spring rolls are appetising and so is their falafel with pita platter. The pizza too is yum. The best thing going here is that in spite of being a little pricy, their quality of food is sufficient and not meagre. The cocktails could have been better, though. Shisha is good! And not to forget, the staff are eager to help.

The nightclub has a weird rule of allowing regulars only in Saturday nights. The exclusivity is maintained but at the cost of good business. My friend and I were on the verge of returning from the club (though we were ready to pay the couple cover charge per person) but a regular there (incidentally a school senior) helped us get in. 
The food was good, and so was the staff.

Great place to party or even just chill over a few drinks and snacks. There are two sections to the place-one the underground which is cosy, dimly lit and has a bit of a Moroccan feel to it minus the belly dancers but cool low seating and hookahs and the second the upper section with the wood, the bar and dj dance floor. Both have their own appeal and are trafficked according to the hour of the day. A fabulous place to host a small fun party. Be it the simple pita-hummus or momos  or there fancier mozzarella cigars and main courses the food is rather yummy but it is slightly expensive. A must go be it anytime of day or night.

One of the most popular places for party goers,nocturne-live the night is situated in the busy shakespeare sarani area.It is divided in sections, one for lounging and chilling,with white interiors and very cosy seating, the other with dark interiors, good lighting, with a well stocked bar and dance floor.The place  is always full, brimming with high energies and happy faces.
The food and drinks are very good and so is the sheesha.Worth special mention are the   butterscotch frappe,mojitos,LIT's along with very good pizzas(funghi ,calzone are my favourites)and pastas(alfredo and marinara).The mushroom(al funghi ) risotto is amazing.
Overall a very good and enjoyable place with amazing ambience, good crowd, good sheesha, and excellent food and drinks.What more do you need ? :)

‚ÄòLet‚Äôs Party‚Äô is the word which resonates once you enter Nocturne. I come back home (Calcutta) for a week (twice in a year) and try meeting up with maximum people in a single instant. We choose Nocturne for our Thursday meet while the timing was early it still had a decent turnout. Given that we had to proceed to have dinner we preferred to limits ourselves to a couple of drinks and few starters. However the look, ambience and ‚Äòparty feel‚Äô compelled us to stay longer. We started with a couple of breezers (Burberry on the insistence of the server) and a chicken momos (again suggested by the serve). I am vegen and the momo‚Äôs were enjoyed by my friends who had come from Delhi and the specially recommended the serve for the different and good taste. Even the breezer we had, was better and I have had never tasted it before (I always prefer Jamaican over others and now I have a choice). The serves were cordial, ambience delightful and while the overall experience was really good. We also had a ‚ÄòHookah‚Äô Pan-Apple-Rasana soft and mild leaving a bit of hangover. Would recommend to the place who come from outside. Always the pricing does not hit your pockets compared to places in Mumbai and Delhi (premium charges).

I visited this place with my the then girlfriend and a few friends. The first thing I noticed was the comfortable darkness that is the trademark of nightlife. That was a plus for me.

The second thing I noticed was the amazing bar which had a great stock for the liver of all alcohol. 

We ordered our drinks and were served chips (if i remember correctly) and an amazing garlic dip. This was definitely a plus point.

The good was very nice with sauteed chicken (very nice flavor and soft as well) and garlic bread. I ordered a mocktail that night. It was Shirley Temple and I quire enjoyed the way they made it.

The place was crowded and I food not like the cramped seating in the general area. Apparently the bigger space was cordoned off for some private party. I didn't like our seats. Plain and simple.

After some time the party who booked the part canceled the party and we were able to move to the nice large space with great cushions. 

It was a fun evening and I would recommend the place only if you have a large group. But make sure you are in couples because they do not allow stag entry. The food is good. The ambience is alright. Definitely a one time try after which you will be the better judge.

Brilliant once again the lovely veg platter.  And the world class sheesha the best one in kolkata. Graded 1 and we'll deserved.



----- 15 Nov, 2013 -----

The haze lounge in my eyes best ambience and hookah but was disappointed by the incapable staff. One of them a new recruit incompetent to take orders in simple plain English.  We  I ordered a veg white sauce pasta with vegetables.  He gets me a simple white sauce pasta saying it's veg sir and no vegetables in it.  Nocturne needs to work on this or its a no visit for me.



----- 01 Oct, 2013 -----

Good great awesome with perfect ambience and classy people all around. The sheesha is the driving factor with few tables and not much of seating space. but the quality of sheesha and the ambience created is marvellous. The stewarts are very responsive and well dressed to give u an adaptive feel of self saturation. Its 45 mins sir, s what being told to everyone when they serve hookah, this has mixed effect on people. the food is good when it comes to platters, 

For good or bad to few its a smoking zone where u can burn smokes with food or cocktails, if sheesha is not ur choice, which makes it more of an accomplished lounge in race of sheesha bars. 

I recommend it if u wanna feel the realm of class in sheesha puffing.

NOCTURNE - One of the most happening places in the City of Joy. 

I had been on the friday night to the NOCTURNE disc. They have another underground lounge for sheesha. For my foodie friends, this place might be a little difficult to locate. So i am going to talk about the location which is when you head from loudon street  and when you cross the Kookie jar and cakes or to be more precise bhajanlal mobile shop/Bada sahab shop from the first crossing take a left and after leaving a few building on the right hand side there is where you discover "NOCTURNE". When i visited this place, they had a valet parking system which was quite impressive. Nevertheless, i entered again at the disc after ages. The ambience was superb and amazing. They have a place on the right side for the hookah's. They had a open smoking area for which certain people might have felt offended. Nevertheless, the music at the start was a little on the bland side but when it took the speed it was outstanding. However, NO STAG entry allowed. 

I had ordered 
1) a hookah which turned out to be good but wasn't very enjoyable as there was too much of air coming in. 
2) 3 tequila shots - which were good. 
3) A flaming shot which was awesome too.
4) 2 small bp with coke.  

The ambience was perfect and cannot be criticised on any grounds. However, i felt the dance floor was too small. As i was sloshed, i had been leaving the gateway i could see all mercedes, Bmw's and Audi's parked outside. I was amazed because i understand that it is really one of the MOST HAPPENING place. However, when i was leaving what pinched me was the security guard's odacity to ask for tips. I mean such a big , happening and a posh nightclub can't even pay a guard few extra thousand bucks when earning so much? I was disheartened. Disheartened not about the fact that guard was asking for tips but disheartened about the fact that how can such big thing happen and that too not falling under the purview of the management? The management department is held liable for it and should look into this matter. 

To conclude, it is a place for posh people who can spend thousands of bucks and not at all pocket friendly. It comes under the blanket of expensive affair. However, no question of doubt relating to staffs politeness or the manager whatsoever. About the amount charged, i don't remember as it was under the cover charge system. 

Another 0.5 would have been gained until the last thing did not happen. 

Much an enjoyable experience though. :)

Awful...I must say...we went there a couple of days back...and it was a horrendous experience...the staff is absolutely uncourteous and insolent. We had spoken to them before dropping in and expressed our desire to be there. On phone they welcomed us, however, when we reached there, they said it was only open for regular members. We told them about our telephonic discussion and they started misbehaving. Have been to many places but this was the worst expereince we'v had so far....Absolutely not recommended......

One of the worst hospitality that I have ever seen in any lounge. Horrible management...  Staff doesn't know how to attend guest properly. They have there own terms and conditions which they never make us aware and later on they charge on the bill. What ever beverages that we want to have they don't provide us and they will try to serve us what they want to.. (expensive beverages). I ordered some dishes from the menu and they charged us triple of the price written over the menu just because it was a festive season..  
Horrible experience and I will recommend people not to prefer this place just because they cheat us. 
I have given 1.5 starts simply because of the music...

Nocturne haze ,situated in theatre road (shakespeare sarani) is mainly a hookah joint cum bar ....the decor is conceptually fresh with white being the theme ...they have categorized the hookah into single and double flavours ...i wont say the hookah is out of the world,but its good.But the space is cramped...they could have extended the place a little bit..one of the major plus-point of this place is their parking lot.most of the restaurants or bars dont have parking spaces for their customers in this area and this is one place which scores above them in this front.the mocktails are well-prepared and the crowd is chic,undoubtedly.But one thing which i found strange when i visited this place for the very first time was the whooping 20% tobacco tax.this was unreasonable and i was left with raised eyebrows.I found the staffs to be courteous ad well-mannered.overall i would give it a 3

The ambience is nice, though it is small and the lights are extremely dim, we had problems in even seeing the menu properly. 

My friends liked the hookah. 
We ordered the veg platter, pasta in mixed sauce and my friends ordered some chicken dish for themselves. 

The platter was nice, though the pasta was undercooked. 
The service was very slow and the female attendant was not well trained and she couldn't even speak English well. 
They themselves didn't know when the bar would open, some said at 4 some said at 6. 

A very mediocre experience. So there goes a 3 from my side!

Out of all the nightclubs I have been to so far, Nocturne undoubtedly has the best food, best drinks and the best crowd.

The drinks are well-priced to their quantity. Every one of them is perfect. I personally love their Cosmo and Kamikaze shots. Killer ! And they give these great munchies with the drinks too.

The food menu is varied and a perfect fill-me-up! Must try is the Alio-olio momos.

The ambience consists of a smoking room, lounge, a disk and a few booths. There is a hukka lounge downstairs. It is not a very big place.

The crowd is one of the best things. I can safely visit with my girl friends.

I give this place a 4.5. It is the best in Calcutta.

Whenever I think of hanging out and chilling with friends, Nocturne is the first place that strikes my mind. The soothing white ambeince downstairs and the cozy ambeince upstairs, the amazing food, and the super hookah makes this place my favourite. 

The Siciliana Pizza, the Aglio Olio momos and the falafel and pita wrap are all a must try here. 

The staff is very very courteous and gives excellent service always, and the place is not too over priced either. Perfect party destination for weekends with great music.

Nocturne located in theatre road was a really nice experience for our group of friends. The ambiance is really good, predominantly white based. Although its a small place, its still spacious. 
The Hookah was really good and so was the Blue Lagoon (we ordered the mocktail again after tasting it). Even the Virgin Mojito was really nice. The potato wedges we ordered was so so. The falafel was decent. The Pizza was really nice and crispy. 
The service was decent. The overall ambiance of the place is good as we enjoyed the IPL match being screened. The pricing is a bit steep but reasonable. Would surely visit this place very soon. 4 stars for Nocturne.

There is no entry criteria for this place... they can refuse people randomly. Me and my friends had gone down to Kolkata from Bangalore and wanted to have a decent night out. The stupidly arrogant manager actually said that its only for regulars and members. I tried to reason with him that we could not be regulars as we were not from the city.... But of course logic was useless.. Who know what makes these people soo arrogant... Or do they just believe in turning away substantial business!!1

Nocturne Haze.. It is located in Theater Road in the same building where Copper Chimney was there. I went there for my birthday treat last year.. It is a pretty decent place.. The ambiance is good enough with predominantly white being the theme.. The food here was satisfactory.. Though the pasta was overcooked and they served arabbiatta when I ordered for pesto. apart from that it was all good.. The hookah was really nice.. and the place is quite moderately priced which is a plus for the students. The service was kind of slow. Two and a half stars from me.

if by any chance you happen to visit this lounge bar , kindly wear your Armani suit and take a Bentley on rent otherwise entry is not possible , as per the desk manager they entertain only decent rich people , i asked like who...ans: people working in  HSBC & HDFC, bench mark itself is so funny but desk manager himself looked like  Bob Biswas.... (by the way Arjun Rampal should also learn this tip for his club LAP.)
