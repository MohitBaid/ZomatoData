Ordered a biryani combo through swiggy. Everything was good. But chick Pahari kebab was missing. Don't know whether they forgot to pack it or not but I called them immediately but they denied their responsibility. Such an incident is really very unexpected.

Dum is my favourite place when I start looking for Tandoori Chicken on a weekend night!
Their kebabs are awesome! Biryani very good and other items decent enough too.
Kebabs and murgh tandoori are the USP. Order via Swiggy for delivery if you want it on time though.
The concept of selling kebabs and tandoori murgh ona  per piece basis is the best part, as you can take exactly as much portion as you want!
Keep up the good work Dum!

Ordered rolls from here few days back.. it was huge in size, the paratha was very hard to chew but the stuffing tasted well with big chunks of chicken. But overall it was not that good. The size can be reduced a little bit and the paratha should be crispy thin. So,  rolls are not recommended from here.

Last time went here a few months back. . Unique concept is that here they sell individual pieces of various kebabs.

Cool. Like instead of having one whole plate of chokka tikka kebab, you can buy separate pieces of tikka, reshmi, tangi etc. 

Initially the added cost came out to be less than a typical one plate kebab in a similar level restaurant but as they increased their perv piece cost, the total cost went up.

But still, it is like standing in front of a chop stall and having various chops at your wish.

The kebabs are made with care, giving them correct flavour, softness and texture.

They are fresh, made right in front of you. So there is a waiting time, as it gets grilled.

The restaurant is basically an outlet, right on the main road. There are a couple of chairs to sit and wait while your kebab gets ready.

There are other items on offer as well but have never had them...actually right across lies Nausijaan so when it comes to Biriyani in Kasha, that's the only place for me.

If it's about kebab I am sure there is no other choice to come in mind if you have experienced kebab from here ..it's a small food spot without attractive banner but will drag you here again and again because of your taste buds 

Price is bit higher for kebab.I really wish if they can consider it plate wise as most of the people would like to buy 4/6 PCs .

The speciality of this restaurant is it can surprise u anytime if you ordered food online. We ordered a combo deal but surprisingly they will take out some items. And this does not happen only once the can repeat it again and again. We have been the victim of such thing twice and if you called them they will clearly deny the fact, don't know who the real culprit may be the restaurant or be the delivery boy but it happens often. Quality of food is average. But their special manner made me surprised very much.

A small takeaway at Kasba, Dum is an excellent outlet for North Indian dishes. The best thing about this place is that they serve the kebabs not as entire plate but on per piece basis. That's really convenient if you know exactly how much you wish to eat. Got Tandoori Murgh and Murgh Malai Kebab. The chicken was nice soft and tender. The pieces were well marinated and tasted really good. Very happy with the  service too! Good experience!

This Saturday was one such evening at home when all of us craved only for kebabs. Heard about this restaurant from a friend and decided to give it a try. I must say that it was indeed worth trying. We ordered for malai tikka kebab, lahsuni kebab and haryali kebab.
The kebab pieces were soft and succulent. Every bite was full of flavour. 
  What was most exciting was the wonderful taste and the sizes of the kebab!!! I would highly recommend this place...A must try for kebab lovers!! 
One recommendation for the owners please add on more varieties.

Dum is my go-to place whenever I happen to have some leftover Biryani of some other restaurant from the previous night. I hate to finish that Biryani without being complimented with some kebabs. This is when this little joint comes to the rescue. I mostly order kebabs from them because they sell kebabs per piece rather than per plate, which is the highlighting point of this joint.

Talking about the place, it's a really small joint only suitable for takeaway and home delivery. There are a few chairs outside, but having a quick bite there is not very enjoyable except for the tempting aroma of kebabs being made. They do serve soft drinks. Also an important thing to note is that they only prepare Biryani on Friday, Saturday and Sundays.

So far, I have tried Tandoori Murg, Murg Malai Kebab, Murg Haryali Kebab and Fish Tikka Tandoori. Firstly, their kebabs are fairly sizeable. Murg Malai Kebab was soft and succulent enough, flavours just blends in your mouth. Murg Haryali Kebab was equally soft and juicy, well marinated and was not too minty to kill the taste of tandoor. Fish Tikka Tandoori had the same softness as its counterparts, was quite well charred and tandoored close to perfection. Tandoori Murg was the least liked kebab so far. It was flavourful, but the choice of chicken pieces was not good. They were too small and actually had less of chicken than I would expect. Also tried their Chicken Roll which I would say is descent enough, tikka flavours are good and the roll is less oily.

Pricing is very cheap. Kebabs cost like ₹30-40 per piece. Quantity completely depends on you, so no hastes of a fixed platter size. Serving time is something I have concerns about. They take over 20 minutes even to serve rolls and if you are ordering kebabs, get ready to wait for a good 30 minutes or so if they are not marinated already. I know preparing kebabs from scratch is time-taking, but they seriously make you wait too long.

Overall, a great place if you are looking for some kebabs to compliment your mughlai or awadhi servings. Would try their Biryani or other main course items sometimes in the future.

I had a good experience of Dum and had recommended to friends. 
However my expectation was shattered on the 16th when at 5 PM I placed an order for home delivery at 8-45 PM of 3 plates Special Mutton Biryani.  After a number of reminders the food was delivered at 10 at night.
Meat was stale and so tough that it was hard to chew.  Hearing this complaint, the outfit sent a complimentary plate which was no better.

This joint at nabapally more of kasba is famous for selling kababs piece wise rather than platter wise. This way one can pick and choose an array of kababs but pay just the the price of a platter. I found this concept interesting. This is primarily a delivery or pickup joint with no sitting space. Its a small shop with kababs hanging in sheeks in the front. I have had their kababs on a couple of occasions. A few that i liked are : tandoori murgh, murgh malai kabab,murgh lasauni kabab. I'm yet to try out their biryani's.

This place is close to where I stay and had thought of visiting it sometime. So here's the deal. It's a takeaway. The usual biriyani, kebabs and rolls fare on the menu. I ordered the Awadhi special dum Biriyani. The order was taken care of promptly which was good. 

However, the Biriyani was way too oily. The mutton pieces too were a tad burnt on one side. I'm also assuming that the Biriyani and the mutton weren't cooked together.

The good thing about the place is that they serve kebabs by the piece, which is nice.

The extra feather on the cap is the mutton biryani. If u live in this part of the city or happen to pass by it take a moment off and test ur gastronomic buds here.

Dum was on my list for a long time finally I tried it out it is very close to my place but still I didn't go out and bring instead ordered food they told 40mins will be the time they need to prepare and they were on time its brilliant concept to keep d kababs as pieces instead of plate as for 2 people or 1 it is huge practically not possible so I ordered fish tandoori kabab chicken malai kabab as starters And then tandoori roti and butter nan and chicken in gravy good big pieces bang on...they gave 2 salad 2 green chutney that's also nice but in chutney they had too much of sour and in the fish salt was too less it didn't get incorporated well...and in the gravy too it was too sour if d sour was less then a 4 definitely

The starters are good but the main course lacks consistency and is very oily... U can be rest assured to get the dish as per the mood of the chef... They can take ages to prepare a simple starter and u have to wait a bit which is unnerving coz u have no idea whether they are preparing ur order or have forgotten about it...however the concept of piece wise Billing makes options flexible...guys pls be consistent with ur items and pay a bit more attention to the pulse of ur client and ul wud really make a lot of restaurants in ur vicinity shit bricks... Really wish they pull up their socks.

Dum biriyani is little juicy biriyani compare to what we generally get here@ Kolkata.Quality and quantity wise its good.But more than biriyani I found there kababs are exceptional.. Soft tender and juicy..not to forget there mutton gilaffi kabab was really yum...USP of the joint is that they serve kabab in single piece...

Recently opened joint in Kasba serving only north indian food. The board outside looks quite impressive although it is a small joint. So one fine day decided to give it a try. There is nothing much to say about the ambience so i will directly head to their food. I ordered for their mutton dum biryaani, Pankhai kebab and mutton gravy. I would say the food quality and quantity was good but tastes average. Nothing out of the world. More than the biryani i loved the pankhai kebab as it had ajwain and many other spices and was tasty. One thing however i noticed was the size of the leg piece of the kebab. It was humongous. I just hoped that they are not procuring chicken from arambagh where i have seen huge pieces which aint normal. I may be wrong but hey i get my chicken from the meat vendors and even a large or big chicken dont have thighs that are as big as that found in arambagh. I feel they are artificially inflated and Since i am a picky eater i guess i will rest my case here.

Price was ok and they serve kebabs as per pieces. Rs.50 per leg piece etc. Staffs were polite. Overall an ok joint.

On noticing this joint on my way back home... i decided to pick up food one fine day. i took a bharwan pankhai kebab which was a reshmi kebab stuffed with chicken keema. they charge by peice which makes kebabs more expensive from other places. but the kebab was worth it... tender chicken stuffed.. yummy!! then was a mutton gravy which was full of oil and tasted awefull.they were to give 4 pieces but it had 3 pieces in there! the pieces were as bad as the taste! PULL up your socks guys to survive in the industry!
