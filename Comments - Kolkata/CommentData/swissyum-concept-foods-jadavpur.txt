A small shop very near Hindustan Sweets at 8 B Jadavpur. This shop has a very wide range of all types of pastries, patty, cookies, numkeens. The shop is also packed with Christmas Cakes at a very reasonable price.. Chocolate cone is exceptional. This is undoubtedly the best cake shop in Jadavpur..

A small place beside Bawarchi near 8b bus stand. It has a wide range of pastries, cakes and some savoury dishes as well. 
In addition they're now fully prepared for the Christmas with a variety of cakes, starting from fruit cakes to diet cakes and even Nolen gur flavoured cake! 
Soooo we tried

Blueberry cake- a huuuge piece of vanilla cake with bluberry jam and blueberry pieces and oh wow!!! Such a generous amount for the price you pay.
Blueberry mousse- a very light bluberry mousse with perfect balance of sweet and sourness and with little pieces of berry in it. Again a really generous portion for its price.

Chocolate cone- when your pastry looks like an ice cream cone but actually is a pastry, it's a win win situation for you. A giant chocolate cone, filled with layers of very light choco mousse and brownie and topped with chocolate sprinklers has a perfect balance of sweetness. So even if you're not a die hard chocolate fan like me, you can go for it!

Chicken croissant- I would say that it had a little bit less filling and more bread but you know what! The bread doesn't make it difficult for you to eat. It's quite soft and buttery and not like any normal croissant bread (obviously different since they make their own bread üòÖ) and the filling is also awesome.
Plus the food is very rightly priced. So, it's a definite recommendation from me!!! üëç

A small place near 8b bus-stand in Jadavpur, which may go unnoticed if you don't pay attention. A small store though, but the taste of the foods is reaching sky! Awesome food for awesome value. Wide variety of pastries and savoury dishes as well. 
We tried 
Blueberry pastry and blueberry mousse- blueberry was very subtle in both the dishes, not too overpowering. It brought a tanginess to the dishes. The mousse had small pieces of crushed blueberries in it. They costs 35 &40 rs.
Chocolate cone- it came in a cone made of Chocolate with very light chocolate mousse and two layers of choco brownies in it. It was topped with choco flakes. Price-40 rs. 
I would definitely recommend this place to everyone and I'd like to visit this place some more times in future. üç©üç∞üç≠üçÆüòò

This franchise is fast becoming one of the names in the bakery industry. They have some fancy items to offer e.g black forest pastry, chocolate tarts, blueberry pastry, sandwiches and burgers. An added bonus is the price of the items....pretty reasonable to say the least. They have opened a lot of outlets all over Kolkata and are really doing well. Hope they continue to do the same.

Visited this newly opened shop of Franchisee at Jadavpur 8B. Have a Chicken Tandoor Patties and a Blue Berry Pastry. Both are awesome. My mother had a Chicken Sand witch which is, according to her, was delicious too. This shop have a wide range of collection of all types of Swissyum Packed Products. The thing which also touched our heart was a very warm and cordial reception from the Madam (Most probably the owner of the Shop) standing inside the shop. Loved the place.

The review is based on the pastries and paneer patties which my mother got for us from this joint last month. One was a Chocolate Truffle and the other a White Forest Pastry.

Chocolate Truffle seemed okayish as the chocolate content was low although the look was good.

White forest pastry tasted better.

Paneer Patties were good.

Prices - Market competitive.

Visited the newly opened outlet of Swissyum at very near to 8B Bus Stand, Jadavpur. This outlet is relatively less spacy in comparison with the main outlet at Lake Gardens. Tried one Chicken Berger. It is awesome and delicious. Then I tried a chocolate cone. It is simply mouthwatering. Have a wonderful evening snacks just at Rs 85. Swissyum is one of the most extra ordinary and emerging cake shop in Kolkata. This outlet is very well decorated with cordial cooperation from its staffs. Best of luck for the future.

A cake shop whose name is picking up in the fourth gear. In a very small span of time they have made a good reputation in the market for themselves. Landed up and took a yummy chocolate cake and the outstanding blueberry cake as take away. Smooth and silky, Gosh they are making it count with the kind of stuffs they are making now.

This newly opened Swissyum shop at Jadavpur takes off in style. There are wide range of patty, pastries, cookies, numkeens, mousses, burger, sandwich etc. It is located at the heart of 8B Stand just beside Hindusthan Sweets. Enjoyed yesterdays evening snacks with a delicious Chicken Sandwich. The shop is little less spacy but there is spontaneous service from the staffs working there. Shall visit the shop again.

In short term this is above expectations, coz talking about their savoury products and some of the pastries they really felt heaven for me, talking about their burger this is a must have for all chicken lovers, and who loves chocolate they may try any of their chocolate desserts, I.e full of chocolate and another one of my most liked pastry is their Belgian vanilla pastry, upper part of that is like woww! So rich and full of flavour, but one thing I didn't liked about the outlet is people working over there, they are a bit unknown to the products.

When I have already tasted all the items of mio amore     n bake club n got bored then came Swissyum.  It has started recently. Was a bit hesitant when I visited the shop for the first time...  I had a chocolate Cone n Chicken Sandwich. Guys must say it's yammy n paisa wasool at the same time. Rare combination must say.... Now I am a regular customer. May be the space is a bit short but that doesn't matter as the products offered are mouthwatering. The staffs are also very cordial n helpful.

This newly opened cake shop near 8 B bus stand might be easily missed owing to its unassumingly small size and in the hustle bustle of Jadavpur. Jadavpur 8B bus stand area is already a competitive zone for all the old and popular cake shops like Bake Club, Mio Amore, Bake paradise, Sugar and Spice and Kathleen. So Swissyum's shop is now added to this. They have a wide variety of snacks and pastries at display. I have tried the chocolate dream pastry, the butterscotch pastry and they both were good but not great. They are not overpriced but there's scope for improvement in taste. Nevertheless I would again visit this place to try the chocolate brownies and chocolate cones. Buck up guys, there's gonna be a tough competition from other already strong going bakeshops and all the best. Keep it up.

Came to this place today after my classes at JU. This is a newly opened outlet which is running for a month around since the beginning. This is a franchise store of Swissyum Concept Foods and have savouries, desserts, as well as a few munchies of the same brand.
I was full after having lunch, so I just opted for a small dessert. It was a chocolate mousse. Firstly, I would like to mention the major mistake was in the preservation which actually spoilt the whole taste of it. Mousses are generally refrigerated but this one was freezed. Hence, the chocolate mousse had lost its aery, fluffy texture and got hard. The cherry on top had dried up and the tempered chocolate and whipped cream on top became too stiff to be broken. Tastewise, the sweetness was a bit on the higher side. Maybe this was because the texture was lost and that matters a lot in case of a mousse. Hence, it's a 3 for now. Need to try their other items for a better rating. That's it. Happy Dining! :)

This is a new outlet of Swissyum Concept foods near my workplace.I dropped by here last Saturday for some evening snacks.The kabab puff was quite big and filling in terms of size.Taste was spicy and I liked it.Since I was too full after having this I opted for something small for an sweet ending.Their butterscotch laddoo was my choice.Loved this twist to our very own laddoo with crunchy butterscotch bits all over it.Loved the innovative way that Swissyum Concept foods takes with desserts.

This is a totally new outlet that has opened in Jadavpur, beside Hindustan Sweets. I have always been a great fan of the pastries and confectioneries of Swissyum, but this outlet disappointed me. 
There is a big time space crunch, with the only possibility of at most 3-4 people standing in a straight line. They hadn't put on the AC and it had become too suffocating. I hope they sort it out soon enough. 
We ordered a Kiwi pastry, which was nothing but a Kiwi paste on top of gelatin, and the pastry tasted somewhat stale and not at all as delicious as the usual Swissyum stuff. The White Forest Pastry too was disappointing. The only relatively good one was the Choco House. 

I really hope they improve soon, so that I can have a taste of their goodies just a few steps away from college.

Try out Swissyum and you are likely to avoid all other popular cake shops.
Prices ranging from 30-100, they have a wide variety of savouries and pastries.
Had chocolate cornetto mousse and it was absolutely bang on.
Recommended for sure.

After a hearty homemade lunch, I was looking for something to satiate my dessert cravings. After hours of checking out their Prince Anwar Shah outlet's menu, I was headed towards the 8B Mio Amore when I saw, tucked between two flowers shops near Hindustan Sweets was this Swissyum outlet. I dragged my boyfriend in there, who has a bigger sweet tooth than I do, and is a loyal Mio Amore patron. We took just a Chocolate Cone to share, since we were pretty full then, but I could not help sneak glances at the other items on display, which all looked amazing, so that itself will call for another visit, being so close to my college.
Coming back to the chocolate cone. It was decently priced at 40 bucks. It looked just like a Cornetto. There was a tempered chocolate cone replacing the usual waffle cone. Inside, there were alternate layers of chocolate mouse and chocolate sponge, topped with chocolate sprinkles. It was not overly sweet which many desserts tend to be. The tempered chocolate was perfect! It was crunchy, and not crumbly. Although he is still cribbing about missing out on the chocolate mouse from Mio Amore even a day later, I think Swissyum can give it some tough competition.

This place is located in Jadavpur 8B. I went there with my friend Poulami. I ordered blueberry mousse and my friend ordered tender coconut mousse. Tender coconut mousse was beautifully presented. It was in a small coconut shell and had a piece of coconut on the top. Now coming to the taste. Blueberry mousse was very delicious and one could get bits of blueberry in every bite. Coconut mousse was also delicious. I got a kiwi pastry packed for home and my friend bought chocolate doughnuts. Kiwi pastry was very soft and delicious with a kiwi jelly on the top. My friend told that the doughnuts were a bit stale. So they should keep this in mind and rectify this mistake. The pastries looked delicious and the price seemed reasonable. The staff should be more proactive.

Swissyum Concept Foods has been in my wishlist for a long long time. Even though they are not quite famous yet, they have been known to offer quality food items at reasonable prices. But somehow I never got the chance to visit them. So when I saw that they are opening an outlet in Jadavpur so close to my house, I could not but go at the first chance I got. This outlet is located just beside Hindustan Sweets in 8B squeezed between two flower shops. Since this is a very busy area, they are never without customers. Today(16.12.2016) I went there in the afternoon with my friend Anjali. After some deliberation we ordered Tender Coconut Mousse and Blueberry Mousse. The coconut Mousse was truly good. They managed to preserve the taste of coconut. It came in a cute little coconut shell. The mouse was really creamy with bits of coconut on it and a big piece on top. The Blueberry Mousse was equally good. The taste of Blueberry was intact fortunately. I got home their doughnuts and my friend bought a Kiwi Pastry. The doughnuts though delicious seemed a bit stale. And I heard another customer say that she was served stale Pastry the previous day. So this has to be taken care of. Otherwise the desserts they offer are good. They look very beautiful and the prices are quite reasonable too. They will provide a good competition to Mio Amore located nearby. Best of Luck.

P.S. They charge extra for even a small plastic. And the staff needs to be more proactive.
