This place is very famous among the people living in the Jadvpur area for biryani. It is a small joint situated in jadavpur. This place serves excellent biryani at a very low price and the quantity is enough. The rice is always cooked in such a way that you won't uneasy after having it. And the chicken pieces are also quite soft. It is one of my favourite places when comes to biryani.

The biryani used to be really amazing before but these day's it's really greasy but it can be good mouthful when you're hungry .The shop owner is little arrogant and they don't wash the salad which they serve which is really annoying.

Extremely good biryani at very cheap price. The special chicken biryani and special mutton biryani tastes very good and the amount is also very generous. The chicken kosha is a must try. But service is not that great.

Birianyi taste is ok. but very dry chicken and too much kewra water makes it bitter. over that the behaviour of the owner is very rude. he charged extra for salad. which always comes free.

Found this one randomly. This place is not for dine in. A pocket friendly outlet with minimum option. Can be specified under the roadside restaurant. They offer delivery to nearby places. Biryani here is a must try here. Chicken kossa was too good with proper spicy and adequate quantity. So overall it's a fine restaurant to order.

This place is located inside the bylanes of Jadavpur near 8B bus stand. Although at first sight this might come across as a small shop and make you skeptical but do not let that fool you. Their biriyani is actually pretty good. Priced moderately it tastes amazing and will make you crave for more. The flavor on the rice is absolutely beautiful. Personally i feel they can improve on the meat, but hey, the quantity and quality of Biriyani at the price they are providing, I am not complaining. They also have chaamp and a few more sides to acoompany. Ideal for students and for people who are looking for moderately priced god eating options.

This is a students place...You'll get biriyani for 60 and 80 bucks chicken and mutton. Only special about this biriyani is it's situated just 2mins away from my room and it's cheap. It's totally a dry biriyani...Rice Contains only oil, salt and food color nothing else. But that tastes good though. Talking about chaanp the mutton chaanp is the worst one, chicken chaanp is good enough but sometimes I found it to be a bit raw inside. If ure fond of good biriyani then it's not ur place.

Recently they shifted 2-3 shops before.
Remains crowded sometime...
Pocket friendly biryani joint... Both biryani and chicken tastes good here... Staffs are cooperative... Sitting arrangements for hardly 4-6 people are there.
TAKE AWAY joint... Nothing much about the ambience. Chicken biryani with egg costs 65... Chicken chap is. RS. 40... Chicken kasa costs 35... Quite cheap n quantity is well enough to fulfill one's. Hunger easily... Recommendable.

Tried Chicken Biriyani with Chicken Chaap at this place 2 years back. The small place has a sitting arrangement for around 6 people.

Coming to the food, Don't expect restaurant quality Biriyani at 60 rupees. But, They are good, at least better than other nearly Street Biriyani centers.

This place is located near 8B bus stand.Walk towards Bawarchi and take the first left turn. I went here today with a friend.
We had chicken biryani for ₹60. The plate comprised a chicken piece(ours was a leg piece) and a half potato,as usual. It was dry and not at all oily like other biryani joints. It had the right proportion of salt too. I JUST LOVED IT considering I am not a biryani fan and I don't have it more than twice a year (consciously). I even liked it more than Arsalan as far as proportions of oil and salt are concerned(but then they are the only ingredients which either make it or break it :P) though the chicken piece however wasn't upto the mark. The quantity was enough for one. 
We had to wait a little. Service was fine and as for ambience well, I had expected worse. In fact we had thought we would opt for takeaway. But reaching there we just gave in. 
This place is definitely worth a try!

PS- I was so excited that I almost forgot to click pics and realized only midway, but then it's never too late,is it! :P

Taste wise I find their Biriyani a bit dry and greasy, though they succeed in keeping the flavour intact. For a roadside joint they are quite good. But they are only suitable for sudden hunger pangs.

I came to know about this from a friend of mine. They have another branch perhaps the oldest at Garfa Main Road (near Garfa Boys High School). Though they charge at a meagre price their taste is pretty much unbalanced. I had ordered from their Garfa Branch twice & once from their Jadavpur branch & each time the taste is same. I had stopped visiting their outlets unless & until I feel compelled to.

Some convincing reviews and nice ratings in Zomato drew my attention towards Ajooba. This place is mainly a takeaway joint but has also thoughtfully added a few tables and chairs in case someone gets too hungry and decides to eat then and there itself. 

We came by today and had a plate of mutton biryani each. While the aroma and quality of rice is awesome for the price charged, the taste is pretty bland and unbalanced. The potato was too salty and the rice devoid of proper seasoning. I got a decent piece of mutton but the meat could've been softer. 

Overall, this place is better than a lot of biryani stalls selling their stuff at throw away prices. But, the taste impressed us no more than the excessively salty piece of potato did. :(

This is mostly a takeaway joint, though there are a few seats accommodated within a very small place. But the 4.0 is not for the ambiance or staff or any thing else, except for the food. Inspite being a very small outlet, the food is excellent. Very less oily, quite good portions and the cheeeap prices. The chicken and mutton kasha and the various biriyani combinations are perfect for gorging on our favorite biriyani, any time. Just take home or order delivery and enjoy good biriyani in the comfort of your house!

It's the small takeaway joint in Ibrahimpur Road, Jadavpur.  I bought two plates of Chicken Biriyani and Chicken Chap on my way back to home. As far as taste is concerned, this is decent enough . Their  quantity is very good. The Chicken chap is quite good but, a bit spicy.  The good thing is that this joint is very reasonable as far as price is concerned.  I find the biriyani meat  a bit hard, rather not so succulent . Otherwise It is a value for money joint.

A whole lot of biryani at a relatively low price. I've deducted one point for the limited seating facility and non availability of drinking water. Else if you want your biryani to-go then this is the place you should come to.

As I keep saying, Ajooba makes Ajooba biriyani! They are very pocket friendly and all your requests for an extra aloo or egg will be complied with, subject to payment of a nominal charge of 5/10 rupees. But it's not any like the ordinary cheap biriyani joint, it's biriyani is actually brilliant. The Mutton literally falls off the bone, and the rice is never dry.

Ajooba is my quick fix for bad days. And solace in my broke days. It's almost like a friend now, whom I visit at least twice every week.

One of the qualities that make you a human being is the ability to be non judgmental. After all, a learned man once said that the true mark of an educated mind is the ability to understand an idea without accepting it. This place is one such place which has made me redefine the notion of taste and how a place or its get up is not a in indicator of what is the spread(for some it may be a firm grasp of the obvious). Despite staying at a stones throw this place was never on my to go list and for what reason is something still unknown to me. Filling and easy on the palate is their biryani and the biggest plus point being the pricing. The meats are soft succulent and taste is sublime. Grab a plate served piping hot and experience a turn of the word "awesome" 
This one has desi Michelin stars all over it.

Ajooba biryani is the contingency plan for local residents and students. In a meagre ₹60 they provide decent chicken biryani which one can consume without the fear of burps. They also serve mutton biryani, aloo biryani and chicken and mutton gravy items but chicken biryani is the best of the lot. Not a fancy restaurant. But you feel like having biryani at pocket friendly price, you can give it a try.

This Biryani centre is Very close to my House, located near Kalibari lane just opposite of Jadavpur, CPM Party Office ,  compared to other small Biryani centre this is is good, the price is really cheap , as Special Mutton Biryani which contains 1 egg+1 potato+2 pieces Mutton @ 140rs , the Chicken Chanp is only 40rs 1 piece.
for a change or if any guest suddenly come to my place I prefer this one, Oil is a factor but C'mon we are not going to have Biryani everyday.
Taste is good to me

It is simply one of the best biryani joints that I like due to such affordable price tag. You can get a plate of chicken biryani with egg for 65 rupees. The Biryani is lightweight and not overspiced. The Chicken Kasha, Mutton Kasha are also good. Here you have the option of getting Biryani in almost any form. Like Aloo Biryani which will have the Biryani rice with a piece of flavoured potato. Mostly customers ask for take away. 2-3 tables along with chairs are also present but very rarely they are used

Have never been a part of the ambiance that the restaurant offers, got a parcel to enjoy the delicacy at home.
Awesome Biriyani and super pocket friendly price.
I would not use the word 'cheap' for the prices they offer for their amazing biriyani, instead I would prefer saying very less expensive.

Must try is the finger licking yummmm mutton biriyani !!

This outlet is really cheap wen it comes to biriyani...their chicken biriyani is average but a bit oily...chicken kasha is also good if u can ignore the oil factor...overall if u r running low in budget and u r desperate for some biriyani try it out here

Cheap but very good quality biriyani from this outlet. Another outlet is at Garfa Main Road, Jadavpur.
Anyways despite being a street biriyani shop/outlet serves good quality stuff. 
Good for sourcing biriyani when there a party at home or got a bunch of friends to treat.

Small outlet on the busy Ibrahimpur Road. But makes great biriyanis at the cheapest price. Good for casual eatings and still serves the half plate option, a lost tradition of Calcutta.
