In my previous visit I found the place good. But on my last visit the experience was horrible. Firstly service is horribly slow. We sat for about 25mins to get our Thali. The food came, rice dal and one sabji. Average food.
We were two people one took chicken and I took Mutton. The chicken was almost tasteless.
The Mutton they served was stale from atleast one day. When I took the Mutton on my plate it smelt horrible. Couldn't dare to put it in my mouth. I called the lady staff, she arrived after 10-15mins and after calling her 3time. I asked her to change the dish, and her first response was 'no one complain about mutton, this is good please have it'. I asked her to smell it. Then she finally said that she will change it. And she took another 10mins for it. By that time I was already seating for nearly half an hour in the middle of my lunch. So I just decided to go and wash my hand. As I was washing my hand she came with a leg piece of chicken in place of mutton. I asked her to take it back and give me the bill.
Here comes another story. I wanted to pay in card, she said if I pay in card I have to pay 18% GST. Whereas if I pay in Cash, no tax is required. I don't know how this GST works for them.
Anyway I will make sure not to recommend this place to anyone, nor to visit it again.

Quality of the food is very good. Some things need to be improved in service and management. I myself own a restaurant and I do believing and being a friend to a business of same stream. I would like to speak to the owner regarding some things and for some betterment. Please revert back.

Went on Valentine's Day....not at all good,mosquitoes were flying all around us,somehow managed to come out and went to another cafe.....ambiance was perfect for a bengali restaurant but not for a cafe, the cash counter looked like an ordinary grocery shop....ordered for Chicken club sandwich, which was unavailable then ordered for Cafe Latte, which tasted so so,and price according to taste was at a higher range, but due to their hospitality i gave them 3.....overall experience okay types.....

At the lazy Sunday evening i got out watching a bogus film and was all hungry. Walked a little towards the Lord's more and found this place very near to Gold Rush Restro. This place is basically a place which offers you with lot of variety. Though going through their menu i found that they are more specialist in Bengali Cuisines. Dined in here with my friend for some evening snacks.
We ordered Cuppachino at first with French fries. Cuppachino was average nothing special about it but the French fries gave me a hell of a shock. Rather i was expecting crispy small French fries with was potato finger fries of huge shapes (the first turn off). Then we opted for Chicken Cheese Sandwich. On the plate it looked good being served with potato chips but when i took the first bite it was all disaster. Cheese was too sticky and the amount of chicken was too less as chicken sandwich is concerned. Lastly we ordered the Fish Orly and this was the dish which gave them the 0.5 extra. Wrapped in barter the bhetki fish done the trick. It was so tasty and juicy that we ordered one more.

I was low on cash but needed a good place to sit and talk with my friend. She took me here. This place is located on the other side of the road from the Swissyum store. A small place where you might get all sorts of people from all age groups. We occupied 2 chairs on the upper floor by the window.

FOOD: Ordered a Cold Coffee. It was okay-the coffee was too strong.
My friend decided to have her lunch there and ordered a Chicken Thali.

STAFF: Nice people.

Bill: Rs.170. No surprises here.

P.S- I think this is the only place in the city where you get a cold coffee at that cheap a price.

Found this cafe out on a hot and humid rainy afternoon. thought it is a cafe the first time but its basically a restaurant. they make good ice cream desserts. Me and boyfriend we go there often just to have this one chicken thaali which has bhaat daal some bhaaja seasonal torkari a chicken dish and chaatni... food here never disappointed. very tasty delicious food. just think the staff should be a little more proffessional. love it anyhow.

A new restro opened beside my home- a 5-7mins walk from my home. This restro has bengali dishes,chinese dishes as well as parts of cafe. They also have various thalis. Since it was very new i ordered 2 veg thalis just to taste the quality of the food. Each veg thali cost 70rs.
Coming to the food, the veg thali consist of shukto,alu bhaja,a mix veg,rice,dal,chutney and salad. I liked the food. The dal was a bit tasteless,the sukto was good,the mix veg was ok,alu bajha was soft and the chutney was ok.Comparing to the price, the quality and quantity of food is good. To relieve your family members from one day work at kitchen,one can go for the thalis.Would try the other items.
