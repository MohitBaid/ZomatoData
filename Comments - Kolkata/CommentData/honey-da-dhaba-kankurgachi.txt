After failing to dine at an all time favourite restaurant  (due to parking issues).. two depressed souls end up by fluke at Honey Da Dhaba. Just after entering the restaurant they were welcomed with the mesmerising  aroma of punjabi food. Now the ambience was giving an old Kolkata restaurant feel. Heavy black stone dining table with heavy wooden chairs takes you back a couple of years.  Now we ordered half plate butter chicken and 5 tandoori roti. We decided that we will order another side dish after we see the amount of the butter chicken . When the food arrived we were shocked to see the amount.  Half plate butter chicken was sufficient for 5tandoori rotis! The  tandoori roti was soft and served hot. The butter chicken was also served hot and was amazing to taste. It had a smoky flavour and very little amount of sugar was used in the preparations.  Most restaurants generally goof up with the wrong proportion of sugar . We also ordered two fresh lime sodas which were refreshing enough. We were full after the meal yet we were upset that we couldn't order anything more as we found the food super tasty. The service was prompt and waiter was highly courteous. Surprisingly the bill after tax was Rs470. Now that says the pocket pinch was hardly a pinch considering the amount and the oh so good taste! Next time I am planning to go in a large group so that I can order and taste many items.

Ordered food from here last night.  Ordered 2 garlic Naan,  2 Naan, 3 dal makhani, , 2 paneer butter masala,  1 Chana masala,  1 aloo do pyaza.  And got everything under 1120. Had  a bit problem with the delivery (which explains the  - 0.5)but otherwise the food was amazing.  The dal and paneer were amazing.  It was better to stay home and and get food delivered from here rather than going to Jail Hind.  Amazing guys.  Always heard Good about you.  Will order many more times.

Went there for dinner yesterday and had a good experience!

Location and ambiance-Located near Manicktala ESI hospital on the main road..ambiance and decor was pretty good with soothing music playing on the background.Now coming to what we ordered :-


_______________________________________________
Mutton Boti kebab-6 soft tender pieces of mutton that literally melted in our mouth was the star of the show! This came along with a green chutney(which could have been better) and salad by the side.

Dal Makhani-This was a big turn down because it had a bland taste.could have been much better!

Baby corn mushroom matar-This was good slightly sweet which complimented the satisfactory proportions of mushroom,baby corn and peas added.

Butter Kulcha and Plain Basmati Rice- There is not much to say about this!The kulchas were pretty soft with generous quantity of butter.
We also ordered chicken curry for delivery and most of the other items were not available.
The bill came around 1100something
The staffs were pretty courteous as well..Overall had a good expirience!

Really sad with how the place has turned out to be. A year an a half ago, this place and the service was superb. I have been visiting this place for quite a lot but I would like to point out on my recent experiences about the service and the quality of the food which  has degraded over the years.
Well, few days back we had gone and ordered the biriyani and it was after 20 minutes they informed us that there is no biriyani and it will take more 30 minutes to get it done. It was really disappointing.
We again went there yesterday and finally got the Biriyani but it was cold. There is no complain about the taste and the quantity but it was really cold.
Even though the menu is full of the names of various dishes but not all were available and the staffs were telling what to order according to what was available.
Day by day their standard is decreasing and it is really sad.
Though I really cannot complain about the taste of whatever was served but I really wish it was hot.

It is a great place to visit for people who like Punjabi food. The chicken dishes are the highlight of the restaurant. The food has a essence of Punjab in it as well which is very rare to find. The prices are also very pocket friendly. This is a wonderful place in the heart of kakurgachi.

Worst home delivery experience ever! Ordered at 8:01 pm and received ice cold food at 10:38. Tandoori roti was cold and hard. Butter chicken was cold too. Delivery person don’t have insulated box and the plastic bag with food was dangling in the bikes handlebar. The receipt was soaked with oil so don’t know how much I was charged and while placing the order staff could not tell me the amount due. Would left a negative feedback. Waste of time and money. When I called at 10pm to get an ETA the attended asked someone about the status and I can hear on the phone that he was told that the order is not ready but he spontaneously lied to me that the order is on it’s way with the delivery driver. Bunch of morons and liars.

Although the food is ok, they prefer u not placing order online and at times home delivery takes 1.30-2 hrs. Instead of telling the facts they keep making stories. Shameful approach towards it's customers for a restaurant of it's stature. So please keep at least 2 hours in hand if you are placing orders over phone and ask them to spare the lies

I had been to Honey Da@ Kankurgachi today for dinner.It was relatively empty.When I looked through the menu card and ordered Makki Ka Roti,I was told it was not available since cook is on leave.Then I ordered for Pudina Paratha.I was told it's not available.Finally I settled for simple aloo paratha and palak paneer.After waiting for 15 mins,the waiter told me he was sorry to inform that palak paneer was not available too..Is it a langar or a restaurant they have opened? Disastrous service.Callous attitude.

Really like the punjabi food here and I've seen some of my friends complaint about the quantity of the dishes here but for me considering the price it was pretty good, the only thing that I had an issue with were the pieces of mutton in the Mutton Pasinda, wasn't tender at all, probably undercooked. Really liked their Biryani though, had that authentic punjabi biryani smell unlike the mughlai ones. Overall decent.

Peas pulao was less oily and navratan korma was on the sweeter side. Overall nice food they serve but need to add some extra spice to some dishes as sometimes it tastes too simple..

Visited this awesome restaurant for sunday lunch two days ago . The ambience was cool & very welcoming . We were six friends & were hungry like anything. So we ordered Chicken Lasuni Kebab(2plates),Chicken Pahari Kebab (2plates), chicken Biriyani (3Plates) , Kashmiri Pulao(1plate), Chicken Tikka Butter Masala(1plate), Mutton Rara Punjabi (1plate), Butter Nun 2nos . & Gajar ka Halwa 3 plates. I must confess the kebabs were very juicy & soft . The Biriyani & Pulao is a must try item at this place . Though the mutton was a bit stiff in the Rara punjabi dish  but all the chicken items were heavenly. The staffs were also very polite & quick at serving . And guess the pocket pinch ..only Rs. 2500/- WOW!!
Strong recommendation for the food lovers to pay a visit .

Looking for Awadhi of North Indian cuisine restaurant in Kakurgachi area, then Honey Da Dhaba in waiting for you. Though it is named as Dhaba, but it is nothing but a pure North Indian Restaurant. So let's come and explore this place.

On a single glance from outside, you might think that the restaurant is small in size, but it is not at all small. It is huge and too specious from inside which can easily accommodate around 40 persons at a time.

Service is quick and the stuffs are helpful & polite.

Now come to the food. We ordered -

1. Mutton Kakori Kebab - Seven pieces mid sized mutton pieces were served with green chutney and onion. Mutton pieces were boneless, spicy as well as well grilled. Which I love most about the kebab is, its semi burnt texture, with gives you special aroma during your dining.

2. Mutton Biriyani - When a biriyani lover enters into a pure North Indian restaurant, how can he keep himself out from biriyani? Yes. the ultimate bae. The plateful of rice were served with a mid sized soft aloo and a big pieces of mutton. Unfortunately there were no egg. The rice were well cooked and the mutton piece was too soft and juicy. Love it.

3. Chicken Do Piyaja - When the item come into the table, I got quite surprised when I found aloo and peas rather than onion in the Do piyaja. Though the serving guy demanding that it was Do piyaja, but I had doubt regarding that. The chicken pieces were soft. 6 pieces chicken were there and the gravy was not spicy at all, which was really very disappointing.

4. Chicken Kadai - Now finally we got the spicy touch with our Biryani. One big chicken piece was there, which were cutted into two halves as per our demand. Good in taste.

5. Onion Salad - Normal cutted onion pieces were served with cucumber and tomato. Nothing special.

So in conclusion, I will say, Honey Da dhaba in one of the budget friendly North Indian Restaurant in its area...Price is low and the quality of food is good. Overall a good dining experiences.

Well frankly I was a kid when I first had food from honey da dhaba. Just beside my house in kankurgachi this place has been a hit with foodies in our city for quite some time. The ambaince is quite nice with good chairs and tables. Though mostly nowadays I order takeaways rather than going there but for me when it comes to having good north Indian food close by honey da dhaba is what comes to my mind. Well I dont really want to say anything about any dish particularly because I have had many of what they have on their menu mainly the non veg section. But for the average eater I would reccomend the biryani which is quite good and can be compared to the biryani from the famous biryani places in town. Then comes your regular fare including all sorts of Indian breads including kulcha, naan, tandoori roti, kebabs, tadka, different sorts of mutton and chicken preparations. But for me it will always be fish amritsari masala and mutton rezala. Lastly the major Indian favourite butter chicken is also a must try. The staff is very courteous. But with a heavy heart I would also say that they have become a former shade of themselves with heavy competition in the city and sadly there food quality has diminished a little. It is pocket friendly and it will always be a nostalgic place for me.

We ordered navratna korma,chicken tikka masala , chicken saag along with naan. The quantity of the dishes were appropriate. The korma was perfect and so was the chicken tikka masala. The chicken saag was average. Naan was soft and tender. The waiter was patient and the dishes were served within 15 minutes. This place has a very nice ambience. But the only off thing was we had to wait 25 minutes in the queue as it was sunday.

For main course we ordered Mutton Special Dum Handi Biriyani and Mutton Chaap.
Biriyani was good and aromatic. Mutton Chaap was also very tasty.
We had a great time there. Quantity of food was good according with the price and service was quick too.

I dropped in with my friend today when we were starving. The interior was chic and elegant. Even though the place wasn't crowded, still the waiter took some time to get to us for which he apologized. Then he took very good care of us and I have to say he was very amiable and soft-spoken.
Coming to the food we ordered:

PLAIN KULCHA(3.5/5) : It did lack butter, it was fluffy but dry. No butter at all.
TANDOORI PRAWN BUTTER MASALA(5/5) : It was simply sapid and finger lickin' good, only thing that I observed was there were more pieces with just the shell and fewer pieces with meat.
FISH AJWAINI TIKKA(5/5) : Whoa! Extremely succulent, it just melted in my mouth. Way to go!
EGG BIRYANI(4.5/5) : Tasted fairly good but not extraordinary (I like it a little more oily 😉)
BOONDI RAITA : UNAVAILABLE, a little let down, but no issues.
DESSERT : None of the desserts on the menu was available, weird! Dissapointed🙁 Hence we called it a day with a glass of fresh lime soda.

Overall a nice experience, pretty pocket friendly with delicious north indian preparations. Another visit on the cards :)

I have placed an order for some foods 19-09-17 evening through Zomato. Copy of the bill is attached. I have ordered chicken chap for the first time from Honey Da dhaba. But, forced to throw away the dish as we could not eat it. Severe smell of coconut oil have been found in the chicken chap. I don't know whether they used to cook the chicken chap with coconut oil or they have used coconut oil by mistake. I would like to draw the attention of concerned authority to clarify it. If using coconut oil in chicken chap is their standard recepie, I will never take chicken chap in future. My post is not to criticize anyone, rather want to know the fact.

Honey Da Dhaba,Kankurgachi. 

I seek this place whenever I crave some authentic punjabi food.
By far,the best dishes I have tasted here are Chicken Bharta,Mutton pasinda,Chicken tandoori,Mutton Rogan Josh and the different varieties of naan. 
I did not like the Biriyani because it seemed too bland and void of both the taste and smell of Biriyani. 
But overall,a nice outlet with a friendly staff.

Used to visit this place a lot when three managers used to run this restaurant and used to run it well. Even on Sundays me and my family got seats during rush hour because they arranged for it. Nowadays this place is full of people who are deficient of decency. They don't even know how to talk to guests and how to react to the problems. It is full of punjabis now who are very rude even when they talk on the phone let alone conversing with them when you are at the restaurant. The only reason I am giving 3 stars is because of the quality of the food, which is just magnificent. Still, literally disappointed with their service.

Honey Da Dhaba, Kankurgachi
Location: opposite Bagmari Kabaristan 
Went there on panchami with gang of girls. Decor is really nice with comfortable chairs and tables.. 
We ordered:
*Chicken Biryani
*masaledar chicken 
*butter nun and masala kulcha.. 
May be it was due to puja rush the roti's were not upto the mark.. The masala kulcha could have been more stuffy.. The chicken curry was very nice and tasty.. 
The staffs were slow and later on they gossiped about the tips we gave.. 
Expect to change the staffs attitude towards customer or else the food is nice..

Never ever place home delivery order at honey da dhaba.....pathetic service, I generally don't give negative review until and unless things are beyond limits. To be more specific I placed an order at 6pm on 1/10/17 and was told that the delivery will take 45mins i. e. by 6.45. I started calling restaurant at 7.45 but did not got any proper reply whether delivery person was out with the delivery or not....i call them minimum 20 times but got no proper reply. Finally got delivery at 9.15pm. Plsss never trust this restaurant when guest are at ur place they will put you in very awkward position....attaching bill copy here with....which was made at 8.40pm after 2hr40min of placing my order.

The convenient location of the restaurant is obviously a big plus point and contributes substantially to its popularity. The decor is pretty amazing, albeit slightly dimly lit. We went for lunch on a rainy afternoon, and yet the place was full. We were a really big group, and I would really like to mention how diligently and courteously the staff attended us. We had Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Rara Chicken. We really wanted to try a few varieties of Naans, but had to settle for just Butter Naans, since the others were not available. Overall, definitely recommended.

Honey Da Dhaba is quite an old restaurant located near ESI Hospital , Kankurgachi . At one point of time they were one of the leaders serving north Indian delicacies but with newer players emerging in the market they have fallen behind in the pecking order . Though I have been visiting this place since my childhood days but today's visit was after a long time . The restaurant boasts of nice interiors with comfortable seating . Staffs are polite & well mannered . As I have never tried their Chinese dishes so can not comment about them . Today had the following : 
Mutton Boti Kebab : We were eager to have Mutton Adrak Ke Punje but they said it was unavailable so decided on this one . Actually many of the recently introduced dishes are still unavailable which is disappointing . The taste of this was mixed . The mutton itself was a bit rubbery but the spices were proportionate & tasty . The waiting time was very long . They said it would take 15 minutes to serve but in the end took 25 minutes .
Butter Nun : The butter nun was really good & tasted beautiful . 
Chicken Bharta : Have tried this dish on my previous visits also have never been disappointed . Quantity is sufficient for two people . The shredded chickens in spicy gravy with one boiled egg is mouthwatering . The combination of butter nun & chicken bharta was brilliant . 
They provide finger bowl at the end of the meal . 
They should make sure that all dishes are available at any point of time otherwise stiff competition will drive foodies to other joints .
Zomato needs to update the menu card as almost all prices have moved northwards .

This is a Cosmo dhaba. A Cosmo ambience with a pinch of Punjabi style and Punjabi music. I had once visited this place but in those days Zomato was not there. Anyway this is a pretty pocket friendly place. I ordered two starters- chiken tandoori & chiken pahari kabab. In main course butter nun and fish amritsari masala and my bill after applying GST was below 1000. The service was quite good, they were fast. Tandoori was awesome, although chiken pahari kebab was little flat. Fish amritsari masala was well cooked. Quality of fish was nice, real bhetki I guess. So overall on the near end of month, when u want a budget friendly food outing this place is perfect.

I visited the place with my two kids for takeaway on a Sunday afternoon about two months ago. We were to catch a train so we were in a bit of a hurry. So I talked to the manager about making the food as soon as possible and he assured me that I will get my food on time. He himself went to the kitchen and brought my food. The bill amount was 1200. Very cheap for the amount of food we ordered. Now coming to the food quality, just one word: Awesome. Everything was just perfect. But the reason I am rating 2 stars is the behaviour of the owner with the staff. Though I am not sure whether it was the owner or some other guest. If he was the owner and he is reading this right now, I would like to say to him, grow up and treat your staff nicely. If he was a guest and he is reading this, buddy if you are purchasing something from someone, that doesn’t give you are right to treat anyone like that.

Horrible food. Only item to cherish is Lasuni Kabab. Butter nun had negligible butter. The restaurant was not accepting cards. There was no mention at the entrance. Will ensure that I never visit this place again..

Location- Good!
Ambiance- Pleasant, though they can change it a little as it has been ages they're having the same interiors and exterior.
Service- Warm.
Menu- North Indian & Afghani
Food- This place offers one of the tastiest platters in the category of food they offer. Chicken, Mutton, Fish and even Vegetarian dishes, all spot on and salivating. The Masala Kulcha there is something i can have alone, without the need of any accompanying curry or dish. The Keema Naan was a Dhaba royalty for years before the others introduced it too. The Chicken in every form is soft, juicy and sumptuous. 
All in all i love the place and all its dishes, especially since they have this free delivery option available at a comparatively lower minimum order level. Yayy!

Visited the place yesterday for take away. Even though there was a huge rush because of Sunday, I got my food within 10 minutes. Excellent service by the parcel guys. Coming to the food, I had ordered lasuni kebab, Palak paneer and masala kulchas. All of which were awesome.

If people wants typcial punjabi food this is the  right place.I did home delivery so don't know about the ambience,decor,staffs but one thing is undoubtedly the best i.e.  the food.Starting with delivery it came a bit late but yet the food was qiute hot.Butter nan was good just they needed to make it a bit more soft.Masala Kulcha was just awesome and Mutton Rogan Josh was also good.Need to try the biriyani and the famous butter chicken.Overall this restaurant  deserves a visit  again.

I've been here and ordered from this Restuarant mutiple times. I've tried almost all of the items available in the Menu, be it Veg or Non-Veg and I've never been dissapointed. The Friendly Ambience and the professional behaviour of Staff makes me a frequent Visitor. They also deliver the food in time. Moreover, the quantity here is very good. Strongly recommended. :)

I have been to this place like about 10 years back until the previous day I visited the place again. Though it have been near my house I rarely order from here. The previous day I had ordered 5 mutton biryani (take away) but I am really sorry to say the food didn't taste right and we had to through away the major portion of it.The place have disappointed me and I would think twice before having anything from here in the near future.

Located at a place where people from different parts of Kolkata can visit easily. The quality of food is quite remarkable, i found it quite better than famous biriyani & kebab joints of the city. The price is quite pocket friendly for college goers. In a small amount you'll get to taste a lot. The service is very good. The waiters are very co-opertive and friendly. The place is well decorated and the ambience is quite good. A must try is the mutton seekh kebab, chicken reshmi kebab and tandoori chicken. Sorry I was so hungry and with the smell of seekh kebab nd reshmi kebab I forgot to click their pics...You guyz should try it out soon...

Ordered - chicken reshmi kabab( very nice), chicken tikka kabab(very nice), tandoori paneer (OK), green salad (very less price), fresh lime soda (big glass and nice). All rs 826.

This place is awesome !
We ordered
Lasuni kabab - was just too good <3
Butter nun - it was soft and big (yes the butter nun)
Chicken Tikka masala - yummy
Gulab jamun - served hot and was very tasty
Amount of food is more than sufficient . Think before ordering a lot !
Staffs really very well behaved . Service fast ,
place clean and tidy .
Then comes the price of the food ... oh boy ! How can someone offer so much in so less money ! Starter , maincourse and desert in just 600 .
In love with this place .

Mutton Galouti kabab not as good as the Mughlai specialty outlets. Only regret is that they don't accept cards of any kind. Might be a shock if you're not prepared.

Enter the place with a not so dhaba ambience, this place is on the restaurant genre though the name can speak otherwise.
Coming to the food, the Indian is really good. It is well cooked and paneer dishes are one of a kind. The drinks and mocktails have really less options though, just like a dhaba.
The food is submerged in the goodness of desi ghee and in good amounts. So calorie checker, perfect cheat day for you!

The staff was also courteous and well mannered.
Pocket pinch :  moderate.

I went to Honey da dhaba for my birthday dinner with my sister on 29th May, 2017.

Ambience : The decor was good and the restaurant was dimly lit which created a great feel.

Staff : I don't know whether it was for that particular day, but staff here was quite confused, I sat for around 10 mins, and they didn't even give me menu card. Then I asked for the menu card, I asked for babycorn mushroom masala, he said it was not available, then I asked him for options, he provided me with suggestion and didn't even wait and said you decide I will come back, I have to call him back to take order.
I ordered for masala papad, chilli mushroom, masala kulcha and garlic nan. After 15 mins he comes and says Garlic nan is not available, I have to order masala kulcha.
Then one another waiter served other table's food on mine, I said I didn't order this, he looked so confused, he asked his senior and he said it was for the table beside me.
Then when finally when they served food, masala papad was not served, I almost finished eating and masala papad was still not served, when I enquired about it, he said that it will still take 2-3 mins, guys its just a masala papad, then I cancelled the papad, finished my food and went home disappointed, I ate my birthday dinner like this. This is not available that is not available, then why do u have so huge menu, just mention the dishes that are available.

Food : Because of the staff, half of my mood was already spoiled, I didn't even get what I wanted, and have to settle for chilli mushroom and masala kulcha, my masala papad was not served, with such mood how can I enjoy my food.
It was Ok though.

A friendly ambiance, Honey Da Dhaba is an ideal place for dining out with friends and family members. I had visited 2 days back with my family and we were not at all disappointed with their service.
We had ordered for Chicken Tandoori, Lasooni Kebab, Butter Naan, Chicken Reshmi Masala and Lassi and all this came for around 1320 INR for 4 people (which is pretty reasonable!)
Now coming to the food, each and every item was delicious. The chicken was tender although the size was a tad smaller. Chicken Reshmi Masala seemed okay. The Lassi came in a big glass which was thick and filling and I would definitely recommend it to you all.
Definitely worth a visit!

Disappointed with the quality of food and service. Went there after recommendation from friends. However, the experience turned out to be far below expectation. Order was taken after follow ups, food was served after more than half hour waiting time. To the most, the quality was poor. Paneer butter masala looked as if water was added to make up for gravy shortage. The taste was bland for all the items ordered.

There are things that you enjoy as a child, and those memories always leave a mark. Honey Da Dhaba is the same. Only, the mark that it leaves, always keeps up to its reputation. 

As a child I would go there with my parents. And I remember the tall glasses of Sweet Fresh Lime Soda and the onions dipped in vinegar. These were the old days when the restaurant was new. I would rather have North Indian food here than anywhere else. We would go and order Roti and Chicken Bharta.

Times change. Costs rise. And sometimes it affects the quality. We no longer order Chicken Bharta there. The dish has lost its charm. I don't know why. But that does not mean the restaurant has lost its charm.

Many of my friends swear by non vegetarian food. They would not have vegetarian food, even if it were to be offered for free. I disagree. I love vegetarian food food as much as I love non-vegetarian food. Sometimes I would rather vouch for vegetarian food. Because the combinations one could create with vegetables does not compare to what one may conjure with meat, fish, or eggs.  

Still we order from there. We do not go there anymore. And we usually stick to our favorite 2 veg dishes - Navratan Korma and Veg Jhalfrezi. I could consume 3-4 tandoori rotis with just these. I have not had much experience with their non-veg food for a long time. But if anyone asks me for authentic North Indian food,  this is the only place I would direct them to.

Edit 31st March, 2017: Late tonight, around 10:30 PM, I ordered Tandoori Rotis, Veg Jhalfrezi, and Navratan Korma. I am surprised by the big portions they delivered. I haven't tasted it yet though. But posting the pics.
PS: This was not that good at all. The Jhalfrezi was okay, but the Navratan Korma was not that good. Maybe because I ordered late, they gave me whatever was available.

Edit 6th May 2017: The food from that night looks really bad. So I am removing the images. I will post some when I get some good ones.

Wonderful food, excellent service. We went to celebrate a friend's birthday here and it was quite a hit. We wanted to order tandoori chicken, however it wasn't available.. Being the first item on the menu, that was a downer. Ah well, as suggested by the very friendly and helpful Mr. Amit, the chicken lahsooni and the mutton adrak preparation were excellent.
We also ordered chicken lababdar and Kali daal with an assortment of keema naan, butter naan and pudina paratha.. food was good except for the pudina paratha which was really dry. The sweet and salt fresh lime soda was more salty than sweet. We were too stuffed to order dessert. All in all a good experience!

Honey da Dhaba is good if you want to try North Indian food. For starter we ordered Crispy chicken and Fish Tikka. The chicken was really bad and stiff. Fish tikka was good and unlike many places well cooked. For main course we had Butter nan, Rara Chicken and Dal makhani. Butter nan was very very soft, Dal makhani was lacking the thickness which it should have but what impressed us the most was the Rara chicken which is also there special dish,it was damn tasty. Staffs are very friendly and attentive. Atmosphere and ambience is nice. Pocket pinch is reasonable.

If you are trying to find a authentic dhaba experience it's not the place..
Foods are not much delicious as per the price range, the ambience is quite good although the service is not fast and quite inefficient in their work..
If you are just trying to find a north indian place to crash for a lunch,it might be helpful at kankurgachi..

Till far the most traditional and othentic punjabi cuisine I have ever had. Generaly the restru is not always filled with guests but the dishes prepared are to the perfect. We ordered tengri kebab, lesuni kebab and the kebabs were soft enough to tear with spoon (well I can't remember the exact term for the word tear at this phrase :(  ) the main course were biryani which was not too much rich. Chicken bharta was just mind blowing. Simply melts in mouth, making tongue to crave more.

Oh!!! How hungry we were when we entered the restaurant and I must say we returned full fully quenched... I went there today with my friends... And had #chiken_pepersalt which was a bit extra dry and OK type ... Then we opted for #hunan_fish which was pretty tasty..follwed by the main course of ... #butter_nun #dal_makhani and #chiken_jhalfrezi
The main course was very tasty and also ample in amount to fit our three buddies' tummy... The ambience was quite pleasing with the very attained waiter and their service... Altogether I will conclude that it a nice place for foodies to give a try!!!

The ambience is nice , spacious n tastefully done interiors. Service takes really long , the place is understaffed also the waiters can improve on their professionalism. Coming to the food, it's decent. I have tried reshmi kebab, mutton Kassa, naan , tandoor roti,chicken bharta. Naan , reshmi kebab and mutton Kassa  are good, Tandoor roti was not upto the mark... Chewy rotis and the chicken bharta had unbalanced flavours. I have tried this place twice, the second time I ordered for a home delivery n i dont know whether it was a zomato app glitch or from the restaurant side their chicken biriyani, even though being available wasn't showing in their online menu. All over decent place ... They don't strictly follow a typical dhaba menu.

Have been a faithful customer for last 20 years. Experience is quite bad wrt front desk, food availability and quality. Do not know if there is a change in management or in kitchen. Definitely needs an improvement. Coolcha's were raw. No tandoor chickens were available even on Sunday lunch time. Overall food quality is poor.

Firstly, I ordered food from here and got a 10% discount. Second, the food was delivered on time and there were no extra charges for home delivery! Third, the pan fried chicken and chicken tandoori were amazing, especially for such a price. Most restaurants are cutting down on their portions and increasing the prices. I'm happy to say that Honey da Dhaba hasn't yet started to follow that trend. Will love to order again!

I visited this restaurant yesterday evening, by chance. We ordered a cheese naan, garlic naan , one butter chicken, one lassi and one kulfi. Yes, we also had veg manchao soup. Mix of Chinese and Indian 😀.. I ended up paying Rs.607/- .. fairly priced .I found staff quite ager to serve. Decor is ok, fine for a family dining. Taste of the food is typical Punjabi types. Overall, I give thumbs up to this restaurant.

ONe of my recommendation for authentic punjabi cuisine,  i order biryani everyday from here and hence i find it quiet tasty even on regular basis. i am quiet satisfied with the quantity.
Their butter nun is tottaly different from other restaurants because their butter nun is very thin and well baked, one of the oldest dhaba in that area and yet they give attention to the ambiance.
worth a visit.

Located near manicktala Esi hospital. From my childhood days i go to this restaurant. Don't go by the name it doesn't resembles any dhaba. The interior decorations are average, nothing special to mention about. Seats are comfortable. The behavior of the service people are good. Coming to the food kebabs and birianis are their specialities. Yesterday thought of trying their rotis. The butter nun was prepared well, soft and delicious. In kebabs order chicken pahari kebab which was mind blowing. The chicken pieces just melted in the mouth. Definitely recommend this one. Coming to the side dishes ordered chicken reshmi butter masala mutton rara and dal makhani. Mutton rara and dal makhani was pathetic. Burnt smell was coming from both the dishes. Never tasted such awful dal makhni in my life. The mutton pieces were hard and chewy. The chicken reshmi masala was the saviour. It was good, the chicken pieces were very soft. Will never try their any veg or mutton dishes.

If if if you want to taste chicken,,let's face it there there won't be a better place than this.
When we went there,it was completely empty so we were not sure about how the food would be .
We were happy with the simple but sophisticated interiors though.
The menu card came and something that attracted my attention was chicken rara. It was something new for me and we asked the waiter what it was.
He explained and we decided to check it out ourselves.
We ordered chicken rara and tandoori roti.
It was absolutely fantastic.
I never had such amazing chicken preparation.
Waiting to visit it soon again.

A choice for winter & Punjabi speciality.We visited this place mainly for having Sardo Da sagh & makai di roti.It is situated just before kakurgachi.one of the oldest dhaba in this area.coming to ambience it's really nice decoreted with minimal decoration but will surely catch your eye.so 4 out of 5.coming to the service it was not satisfactory.The person at the desk was so much busy after telling us to wait he was to busy in knowing the cricket score he didn't even noticed that a table got vacent,so we took the liberty & took the seat from ourselves.server was also bit slow in bringing the foods.so over all a 3 out of 5.coming to the foods we ordered Sardo sagh & makai roti they were tasty.Sagh could have used a more salt,next we asked for tandoori roti, butter nun,butter chicken,chicken bharta.But unfortunately they ran out of butter chicken so it was substituted by chicken tikka masala.butter nun was just literally missing the butter so it was as a bit disappointing.other than that both the chicken were good.so another 4 out of 5.so another satisfied house for another visit.

My tastebuds longed for something Indian. They screamed for satisfaction. All I had to offer them was a dhaba's food. So came Honey Da Dhaba to my rescue. It was so desi, so embracing and their food simply touched my soul.
Ambience was pretty good, themed with false trees, paintings, mirrors, lights on the fans and I really like their seats. Comfortable, cosy and royal seats. Went on a family dinner and we all had a great time. What we loved other than the food was the staff behaviour. They were pretty fast and cooperating. We didn't had to tell them anything separately because they did all by themselves on time.
We ordered Dal Makhani, kashmir aloodum, tandoori roti and one plate rice. Quantity was more than enough, splendid in taste and brought taste buds back to life. Fresh lime soda and masala thumbs up were also nicely done.
The best part about the dinner was, the bill came to only 500 and simply dint hurt the pocket.
That's makes me say this is one of the finest dhaba in Kolkata. 😊

Specially like their biriyani..kabab. . Typical mughlai resturent serving from long time.

Note- going by this fast moving world of theme need some renovation or relook to build new theme..

This is quite an old Punjabi cuisine restaurant, located at Kankurgachi .This is my favorite north Indian restaurant. Their quality as well as quantity of food is really appreciable. Rates are also reasonable. Ambiance wise it is very comfortable. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The staff was decent.

First of all food is average..nothing special...   As per the name dhaba they do not provide dhaba kind of food...no spicy..no oily...no chatpata..    while my visit I tried dal makhni,,kashmiri aaludum,,kulcha,,naan..   aaludum,masala kulcha was a great disappointmnt..

Interior is good..seating arrangements are good...Location is great just near to kankurgachi crossing..

Honey da dhaba has been around for awhile now. Not only this, it hangs a poster saying best biryani in Kolkata outside the entrance. Let me summarize my review by saying that it is not. 
We went there for dinner. The lights are flickering and the chairs old. The interiors however on the first look might to be decent. We sat on the table opposite the kitchen door, and all we could hear was the constant shouting inside the kitchen. The starters were good, the vegetables and the roti were also nice. The real disappointment lay in the Biryani. It was the first time I have ever spit out the food in a restaurant. The biryani was cold and tasted stale. We asked them to take it away. They then asked me to try another, but I had to refuse. 
The staff was decent but trying to push dishes that were already in order. 
Overall, my biryani sucked. 

Order Highlights: 
Dahi ke Kabab
Chicken Lehsuni
Garlic Naan
Tandoori Paneer Butter Masala
Dal Makhani 
Masala Papad

I went there after getting a suggestion from a friend. To start with , the decor is very good , the arrangements etc will give you a very good vibe. Food also is good. We ordered crispy chilly babycorn and  chicken reshmi kabab for starters. Babycorn was very good where as reshmi kabab was ok.
For main course we ordered garlic butter naan , tandoori chicken masala and butter paneer. Taste of food is good but we had to wait more than 30 mins to get what we ordered and whenever we asked , we got illogical answers in return.
In case you exclude the experience and talk only about food then I would give it 4. But since we could not enjoy there, a 3 for Honey Da Dhaba.

For a winter afternoon lunch, my and wife and I ordered Makki di Roti  & Sarson da Saag, Aloo Paratha & Dal Tarka, Chicken Amritsari Kabab (1 plate of 6 pcs) and Firni. Food was very good - quantity and quality/ taste wise. Firni was far superior in comparison with that of other well known Mughlai joints of Kolkata. Service was excellent and prices very reasonable. Overall, we are highly satisfied and would strongly recommend Honey Da Dhaba.

This is quite an old punjabi cuisine restaurant, located at kankurgachi..i had visited it for the first time in 2007, when i was in class 10 and was amazed by their tandoors and kebabs..i went back there, in hunt for the same, today after almost 10 years, with my girl for a lunch..the decor is not themed on dhabas though the name bears the word dhaba..it basically has always had a standard restaurant decor and they still have maintained that..for the food , we had ordered chicken lasuni kabab - 3 large kabab pieces with a small bone @ 170/- which is sufficient for 2 and tasted delightfully delicious, just as I had been expecting...for the main course we had butter tandori rotis @ just rs 10/- each, makki ki roti @ rs 15/- and chicken bharta @ 200/-...the rotis were as good as I've had anywhere...the chicken bharta quantity could have fed more than 2...it tasted okayish though,nothing special..overall, it is a very economic restaurant given the quality and quantity they serve with that magical touch of the desi ghee...service was fine enough..definitely try this to satiate your north indian cravings...

Now when I think of Honey Da Dhaba, it's interiors gave me a very peaceful vibe when I first visited it. The ambience wasn't too heavy on you neither too light. It was perfect and the whole experience was smooth.

Coming to the food. We had ordered my favourite, Dum Aloo. Along with Dum Aloo, there was Dal Makhani and a Paneer Butter Masala with Garlic Naan and Masala ThumsUp. The food was perfect when it came to the taste, the quality and  the quantity.

To sum it up, it was a peaceful experience to my tummy and my mind and my eyes. 

Going to visit again very soon. :)

Oh and the staff were very courteous.

We used to visit this restaurant quite a lot when I was a kid. Though the name says "dhaba", its actually an AC restaurant. 😅 We used to have noodles and fried rice with chilly chicken or garlic chicken. We used to either dine there or order food once a month so you can very well understand how good this one is! Their home delivery service is appreciable as well. Once they saved us from embarrassment when some unexpected visitors showed up one evening. The fish tikka and chicken tikka is something I tried recently and its nice to see that the quality of the restaurant hasn't detoriated in these years.

This was the first time I had visited this place and I found it a little costly compared to the quality of food. The staff was good, the food was nice, the ambiance was nice. The only problem that I faced and the reason for this kind of a rating is  that there was just one staff who was running around the whole time around all the tables. I don't know maybe there was some problem, I am sure they don't run the restaurant with only one waiter but I believe they should have done something about it. The food took more than 30 minutes to arrive.
So altogether a nice and horrifying experience.

THE YO-YO HONEY SINGH OF FOOD

As a neighbouring, neat by restaurant to our residence, we have always taken recourse to their Special Chicken Biriyani with Chicken Bharta whenever we felt bored of eating maid-made dinner. A quick home delivery from there and vodka have been our prompt plans for celebrating any cause - sudden or small and we have thoroughly enjoyed it. Their take-away parcels are as carefully prepared, proportioned and packed as their quality of food on the spot.

After pandal hopping around the area on the day after Dashami - for lunch - we decided to try this place out with family.

AMBIANCE & SERVICE: The interior decor was great. Very few customers on that day. Our attendant was most probably new at his job. Made quite a lot of mistakes with our order. The manager looked after them on complaining.

FOOD: We ordered a Chicken Drums of Heaven (just to try their chinese and get an idea) for starters.
For main course, we ordered a Chicken Biryani, Mutton Rara Punjabi, Butter Chicken and Butter Nun.
The starter was good.
Quantities were sufficient. Mutton Rara Punjabi was mistaken with Chicken Rara Punjabi and it was really really good. Better than the Mutton one when it was replaced by the manager. Butter Chicken was good. Butter Nuns were crunchy and soft. The Biryani, I felt, was okay.

Overall, great food in this place! Definitely coming back to try the kebabs and the chinese main course items. :)

They maintain their quality and quantity. Though the price is bit high.If  you don't have great mughlai cuisine nearby it can be a good option.

I'd rate it lower than 1, had it been possible. There are no excuses for the the kind of food, and service they've provided. I placed an order at 6:45 in the evening today. I was told that the order will arrive in seventy five minutes (which in itself is too long). The order arrived two hours late. We were hungry af and were hoping that the food would make up for it. However, it only worsened our situation. 

Firstly, the food wasn't hot. Infact, it wasn't even luke warm. How do you enjoy north Indian that isn't hot?

Secondly, none of the dishes that we ordered were good enough. The rotis were chewy, and the dal, sabzis lacked flavor. Compared to the prices, I'd be happier to order food from a roadside stall. 

Horrible horrible experience. Please do not go on the few good reviews this place gets.

I had ordered food home and it was a very awful experience. 
It was nothing like eating Punjabi food. We ordered dal makhani , butter panner and masala kulcha . The food was below average, dal makhani didn't even  taste like dal makhani it was so bland, the panner cubes were like rubber. Kulcha was the only element edible. 
I didn't expect my food to be so disappointing. Plus my food was also not deliver on time , around 40 minutes after the stipulated  delivery time.

We ordered for half a tandoori and they got us pieces of the same leg ,the veg tadka highly recommend ed by the waiter had raw vegetables .A shame to our Punjabi brothers .

Yesterday I ordered 21 plates of biryani from Honey Da Dhaba and it was worst experience of my life. It was a treat for my team and it turned out to be a punishment. The rice was not cooked properly at lot, no masala, chicken white as if half boiled hard chicken was put into the boxes. If you guys can't deliver then do not take order. Never would order again in life and never would refer. It would have been better if I would have ordered from a roadside hotel at least tint of taste would have been there. Rating should be in negative. Please guys suggestion do not order from here! Horrible experience!!!! :@

No matter which other new hipster restaurant I go to, to try new food, I always come back here for a hearty soul touching meal. The taste of the food is remarkable. This restaurant is so underrated. All other dhaba chains are babies compared to this.

Another great authentic dhaba in Kolkata. It was 2:40pm and the house was full. Tried their tandoori chicken, biriyani and chicken reshmi masala. I must say that they do maintain both quality and quantity. If you are not that foodie then u should order 1 biriyani for 2 people. Apart from that I took 1 egg tadka and 1 palak paneer for dinner. And again both were awesome. But the the bad part is the service. They just don't care about Ur comfort. Neither they fill Ur empty glass nor switch on the fan. So, if I have to rate this place out of 10 then -

Ambience - 7
Food - 8
Service - 5.

I gave my girlfriend two choices,one was Shiraaz Golden Restaurant and the other was this. She chose this one. I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant and the staff(well not a plus point because the tax cancels it). We ordered shahi paneer with butter naan and regular naan. All of them sucked real bad,the naan was below average,the shahi paneer didn't taste shahi at all. It was saltless as well. We both dipped a piece of naan to the shahi paneer,after having the bite we looked at each others face in dissapointment.

The only resturant near my house that serves quality food. Is probably the best dhaba in the town serving a short menu this resturant excels in the quality of food but has a small seating arrangement and thus u have to wait a while for dine in. The interior too adds to the positives special mentions are chicken tandoori, kulcha,biriyani....and all the kebabs. It has been a part of my childhood...and deserves a 4 star

I don't know why this place has such a low rating. We had gone there last Tuesday when all the places of kolkata even the ones in park street was closed by 10 30pm. We really had a craving for Chinese dishes, but as this had punjabi food , i was a little apprehensive of their Chinese , so had order a half tandoori and tandoori butter masala because try had run out of tikka kebabs.  First of all the tandoor was so good , though in punjabi style the spices mixed are much lower in quantity than the ones in mughal style, but god were they delicious. The butter masala gravy was also very good. But what surprised us was that one of us had still ordered chinese and we were awestruck given its quality. I mean it's better than tangra. They had very little sauces and the taste of the sauces was present in almost a non existent way and the flavour of spices and chicken was what hitting you first. We had ordered the pan fried chicken , fried rice and chilli chicken and it was just so good. Even the decor of this place is nice with lots of real wooden works. The staff was very polite and well mannered.Would love to keep.coming back The price could have been tad cheaper though.

It was last saturday when I visited this place first time after hearing a lot about this place from my friend. We ordered special chicken biriyani, masala kulcha, mutton rara punjabi, kashmiri alu dom and reshmi kebab. Truly speaking, I found all the items were blunt in taste. Specially the mutton rara punjabi. My friend agreed with me and told that the quality of the foods were dropped. Really not satisfied.

Well, a decade back, I swore on God, that I would never ever visit this place again in my life – which was due to an extremely forgetful dining experience @ this place. But today, my conscience pushed me to rethink my earlier decision and I just decided to order from this place – again! I placed my order through the Zomato online food ordering facility – it was nice to see that they offered free delivery with very minimal packing charges.

I ordered their aloo-do-piyaaza, butter roti, steamed rice, papads as well as a Pepsi for office delivery as dinner (I was extending that day to finish off my work). I received a call from them stating that the order would be substantially delayed – which was ok for me! I ultimately received the parcel post 11 pm (although, the order was placed before 09:30 pm).

Packing was fine, so was the quantity served! The roti looked great, although, it became quite soggy (which is quite understandable as it was a delayed office delivery) – nice to see that it was atta based! Rice also looked fine, but the main course indeed scared me off – some potato, onions and gravy in a pool of oil! Well, I had to fish out so much of the oil to have the sabji – which was otherwise tasty (masala portion was very well prepared) and went very well with the papads. Was also served some complimentary salads/ lemon.

Service seems fine and prices are somewhat high! Nevertheless, this place is a huge craze in the Kankurgachi/ Ultadanga area – it’s legacy dating decades back!

The food was awesome and was served piping hot.

P.S. We also ordered fresh lime soda and masala cold drinks. The sweet lime soda was too sweet. And the drinks were served at room temperature. When we mentioned it to the waiter he not only added ice to it but  was also  so cordial and apologetic. Brownie points for him.

This is place where i have been going since my childhood.. This review in on a recent visit to this place. I order mutton biriyani, chicken butter masala, and rashmi kabab. Now here's what we got. Kabab was good and a special mention to the chatni qith the kabab.  Now coming to the biriyani and side dish.  Well after the kabab we were informed that mutton biriyani not available. They can provide chicken so we agreed.  Average biriyani. Now coming to the side dish.  I found the taste to be awful.  And it was just heated in the microwave and not prepared.  Food quality have seriously took a down fall.  As in my previous review the food is what that was good here.

Dinner on Sunday :( .A place which used to serve delicious food but turned into a place serving tasteless food. It's a Dhaba style restaurant but amazingly the Chinese starter (chilly baby corn) was way better than non tasty and weird Butter paneer masala.
To my further disappointment the waiter was very casual in my complaint and hurriedly replaced it with kadhai paneer which too proved to be another big disappointment. 
A total waste of my mood and money.
May be they still serve good non veg but these signature punjabi veg sabjis were total waste.
I would definitely avoid this place unless I don't get better options ( which for thank God is plenty now)

Location:Just opposite ESI hospital on CIT road,Kankurgachi.A 12 minute walk from Hudco more.

Ambience & Decor: Beautiful and classily done without being an eyesore or over the top.Peaceful and sprawling,perfect for a quite family lunch or date.Though there's no dhaba-like feel to the whole place ambience wise.Brownie points for the ceiling fans that doubled up as pristine chandeliers.

Food: Ordered for the following items for a late Sunday lunch-

Tandoori chicken:A full plate consists of 4 big juicy pieces,all charred to perfection yet basted enough to be kept moist.A touch too salty for my pallette but the awesome dahi-pudina chutney and onion lachchas balanced that out.

Also don't miss the nimbu ka achaar they serve as a condiment.It smells and tastes amazing.

Masala kulchas-Standard dhaba fare,good but not great.They skimped on the filling I feel,the edges were a bit doughy.

Mutton rarra punjabi-3 pieces of mutton in a keema-filled gravy.No mutton dish from any restaurant ever satisfies me because my mum's Sunday mutton kasha has set my expectations sky-high.The mutton pieces in this preparation were soft but not melt-in-the-mouth.The biggest flaw for me was the excess use of tomato in the gravy which completely overpowered and killed the rich,earthy taste of the mutton.Don't order if you don't like tomato-based 'khatta' gravies.

They didn't have kulfi for dessert and that was such a bummer,my partner and I were visibly devastated.We so look forward to kulfi at the end of a heavy,dhaba-style meal.

Service:Very polite servers.Our food was served extremely fast.

Prices-Not exactly reasonable but not exorbitant either.We paid Rs 880 for a full plate of tandoori chicken,2 Masala kulchas,1 mutton rarra punjabi and a glass of coca cola.Reasonable for a hearty meal for two,I would say.

Verdict: Though their immediate competition(the likes of RDBD & Punjabee Rasoi)are arguably doing a better job,this place deserves a visit.My partner insisted on this place because a lot of his special occasions as a child were celebrated here.I didn't regret his decision at all.

Nothing better than having the taste of a dhaba in a modern ambience. This place is known for it's Mutton Biryani. This comes with one piece each of mutton, egg and boiled potato. I also used to feel that egg or potato will deteriorate the tatse of Biryani but that is not the case. Infact they compliment the taste. The ambience, seating arrangement and service is of high quality. This is a must go place in Kolkata.

We went for a family dinner on a Sunday evening. We were 7 of us, so had to wait for 10 mins to get a table. We orderd dry chilli fish for starter and mutton biryani and chicken tikka masala for the main course. The dry chilli fish tasted really good with adequate spicyness and not that hot. The mutton biryani was very light but the mutton pieces were not that tender. However the quantity was huge. Each plate had 2 moderate sized mutton pieces, 1 egg, a medium sized potato and enough rice for 2 people with normal appetite. The tikka masala was my favourite and tasted awesome. 
We also ordered for fresh lime sodas and green salad. The soda was too sweet and in room temperature which was a turn off. After repeated reminders we got the salad after our main course was almost over. Service wise they need to improve a lot.

Honey da dhaba used to be my favourite North Indian joint for a long time..until recently when they decided to slash their prices and along with that the quality and taste of their food. 
The restaurant which once used to make the best biriyani around now serves some dry tasteless rice that is difficult to swallow even and mutton that will challenge the strength of your teeth. It's heartbreaking to see them compromise on the quality and taste so much after the price cuts. 
The tandoori has been reduced to half it's previous size and is tasteless with almost no salt. I had to sprinkle chaat masala on the tandoori in order to be able to eat it. 
I hope they are back to their old form soon..but till then going to this restaurant would be a very very bad idea.

Honey da dhaba. One of the best eateries in North Kolkata, and definitely the best near or around Ultadanga. This is my third visit to the place, thought of trying out their Chinese! 😛

Their Punjabi and mughlai are mouth watering, flavor is very good, quantity is ample! You can blindly trust this old eatery and should drop in whenever your tummy urges for good food! The Mutton Biriyani, butter chicken, stuffed paratha, chicken tandoori, chicken tangri masala are the recommended ones. This time, for a change tried their Chinese. Ordered a chicken chili garlic noodles, mixed fried rice and hunan chicken. The noodles tagged fantastic- enough flavors, enough flesh! The mixed fried rice was mild, has a nice aroma. The Hunan chicken to my utter dismay was a little too blunt for me; in other places the Hunan chicken is prepared with red bean sauce, here they serve with a white sauce with onions and bell peppers. It was okayish. The quantity for both was great! 

The decor I feel is too brightly lit for a restaurant. I think a little less light would amplify the ambience. Overall a blissful place for the hoggers and a great place to eat with family!

I had given a birthday treat here to my friends. A nice fine dining restaurant. They serve authentic north indian food. This place is filled most of the times. 
The tandoori chicken is delicious. The naan and the chicken butter masala is cooked to perfection.
For desserts we had ordered nolen gur ice cream and that was the only dish I found not to my liking.
It was overtly sweet and I love sweet things so you can understand the level of sweetness. Apart from that everything is top notch. 
Kudos to the chef and team.

Went for dinner yesterday on my 18th birthday with friends. 😀 Ambience was nice, with some peppy Punjabi numbers playing in the background! ✌ 🎶 But they took time to serve the starters. 😒 We ordered chicken reshmi kebab, and chicken lahsuni kebab (going by the reviews😂). Then for main course we had chicken biriyani, chicken Bharta, butter naan and chicken tikka masala. Kebabs were good.  😋 Biryani tasted good too, it contained two chicken pieces and an egg. 😀 But I did not like the chicken bharta and tikka masala. Both were bland. 😩😩 Naan was okay, as told by my friends! We wanted to order desserts but nothing was available except gulab jamun! 😕 That was a complete turn off. 😑😑 Anyway, this place is apt for an one time visit! 😓

With multiple dhabas brewing up across the city,many have forgotten this good old outlet which is famous for its Chicken Lababdar,juicy Tangri Kebabs and many more.
I had ordered online and the food was good,quantity was pretty decent and filling,tastes rich and nice...just need to wait till the morning to judge how healthy the food was actually.
It's really funny how they are able to deliver to shyambazar but not shovabazar(which is just a kilometre away from shyambazar).They had confirmed my order at 9 p.m. but delivered it after 2 hours;though the delivery time mentioned by Zomato was 1 hour.

3 points to HDD!

Last Night dated 22.05.2016 we are going there. After 1 hour waiting we entry the restaurant at 9.30 pm. When we get the order maximum popular item already out of stock. Total mass. Bed behavior of manager. We request every one don't go this type of restaurant...

THEY ARE A DISGRACE IN THE NAME OF DHABA.
1.they dont know how to manage their waiting customers.
2.they do take the tax on their service. But dont provide one.

3.Fan is not running

4.Ac is not running

5.Ordered food at 8:30.they served the food at 9:50.

6.one can't simply take the audacity of their manager,that lal pagriwala manager.after complaining to him numerous time they started to get arrogant and In the middle of the argument he directly told my cousin BAITH NA HAI TO BAITHIE WARNA CHALE JAIYE. JO KAR SAKTE HAI KAR LIJIYE. dont know if this is the way to talk to a lady.
before running a restaurant learn some decency first.
Rating one is too much for them.

This is a very good place to have north indian food. The food is tasty and reasonably priced. The quantity also on higher side. The interior are okay though it is little old and very highlyl maintained. Service could have been little better. But there is not much to complain as it is not a fine dinning. But quality wise definitely a very good place. Worth mentioning is there lasuni kabab which is fantastic. A must try place for noth indian food lovers.

Big fan of their tandoori chicken. In an age where people are reducing their portions and compromising on quality, this restaurant still serves the best and freshest tandoori's. Best part being, they acknowledge the fact that they will take time. But for customers, the time taken to receive perfect food is actually worth the wait. 
They home deliver and their queue for take away orders is more waiting to be seated!

Today visit there for 1st time.
1.Food : 3/5 
1st of all I want to say about the availability of food.Today what me and my friends want to ordered there is nothing which is really very disappointed us specially no tandoori dishes available there.We want to taste some well known dishes of this restaurant but we did not get it.So, finally we have to ordered chicken pahari kabab which is taste somthing diiferent but no doubt tasty.Then chicken briyani,mutton biriyani and chicken tikka masala.Chicken biriyani I felt the chicken piece is so rough and no juicy part is there,mutton was good.we ordered 2plate chicken tikka masala which is tasty but the 1st plate gravy is more dense than 2nd one.

2.Service: 3/5 From start to end they are totally so slow.After almost 15-20 min they come to take order and give food so late.Even our main dish come to finish but our side dish was not coming at that time.Even they take too much time to prepare a bill.

3.Ambience: 4/5 this a particular part of this restaurant which really like.Artistic furniture even their utensils and arrangement also unique.

The first time I had ordered food from here was probably in the year 2004. They had recently launched then and was a big name in and around Salt Lake and Kankurgachi. Their food was yummy and the prices was dirt cheap. I used to be regular to a cyber cafe nearby my home and they would gladly deliver multiple times from Kankurgachi to Salt Lake.

Its been 12 years now and I still am an ardent fan of this place. Although, it has been quite some time I had visited there last, their Roganjosh, Tikka Kebabs and Biryani still remains favorite to me. The interior inside the restaurant is quite spacious. Can easily accommodate many people at once. They have a take-away counter as well, which was initiated after a few years of their launch. Their service is usually slow, but the food makes up for it.

Their prices have increased in the recent past. Their quality has decreased as well. But, when it comes to Dhaba food, this is one of those old relics which will never fade into oblivion.

Whenever I am in a relaxing mood and have a craving for typical Biriyani and Chicken Bharta, I end up choosing Honey Da Dhaba. An absolute pocket friendly junction for an ideal lazy weekend evening. Don't forget to try their Sweet Lassi before leaving.

Being a resident of kankurgachi since 1992. This joint has served one of the best indian foods before the onset of the biggies in the food market in recent times. It still beats them all though. The kebabs are a must try. Quantity is well justified by the price and so is the quality.

For Punjabi style North Indian food, this restaurant is a viable option for those whose favorite cuisine is North Indian.

Went there few days back just because of the hype and word of mouth. Ordered their specialty Dahi ke kebab, and i admit, it was ultimate. Literally, craved for more of it. And that was it. Afterwards, their was just disappointment. Dal makhani, garlic naan, kadhai paneer, roti, nothing was good at all. Besides food, the service was also just adding up to the dullness.
All credit goes to the starter.

The butter chicken was good, hence the rating. Tandoori chicken was decent. Both were cold.

The order arrived more than 45 minutes *after* the Zomato delivery time, and was still missing items. It was very clear that they didn't bother packing it or sending anything out till the second complaint call. 

I had fond memories of this place from when I was a kid, but I doubt I'll try them again.

Easily located but a strict a no for dine-in for vegetarian people, you won't be able to stand the smell of non vegetarian food, hence decided a pick-up from their outer delivery counter, the food was ready in about 15-20 mins. The food however was much better than what we expected. Paneer Butter Masala & Dal Makhani were the best of the lot along side the variety of soft breads we picked.One can surely pick-up a meal if you want a break from your usual spots.

Located near Ultodanga Hudco more with excellent interior decoration. The staffs are very cordial, they have varieties in both veg and non veg section but I would say go for their tandoor preparatiins rather than any other cuisine. They have a small parking place on the ultodanga main road itself. Prices of the food are optimal...

Below par, however not mediocre.

I'd expect a lot more from a restaurant which is decently built and has been around for a good while. Only the 3rd time I've been here in all my 20 years -- and they've progressively deteriorated. 

The food isn't good, if it ever was. The service is alright at best. Their portions are fine though.

Not worthy of multiple visits in my honest opinion. Better option nearby will take you to Salt Lake.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

Went there for new years at 1 am .... The food was okayish and the staff had a carefree attitude.We waited atleast 10mins just to get the menu.What surprised me was the staff's attitude towards the customers near us.I understand it needed to be closed soon but if they cant take orders anymore or it might be delayed, there is a proper way of explaining.The customers just told the waiter to try and speed up and he was like"Sir the order has already been taken and it takes time.Aise karne se cancel hojaega" .
I was stunned seeing this attitude and what was more shocking was that they didnt even respond to him.Anyway about the food, it was normal food and nothing spectacular about it.What we ordered was a malai kofta and kadhai paneer with tandoori rotis.The paneer dish was still okay but the kofta didn't taste nearly as good as it looked.Also the rotis were not so good.Maybe its speciality is non veg but after yesterday I don't recommend going to this place.

I ordered food online using Zomato. For a top notch restaurant priced at around Rs.850 for two people, it is high time that you guys pick up your act and start acting like one. When I pay for Salad and order it, I really don't expect the cucumbers to be bitter. The least you could do is a taste test, before you belt out bland food like an assembly line.

The food is decent, but priced premium.. The restaurant has no competition in proximity. The overall feel of the restaurant is good. The wood furnitures are heavy and almost vintage. The over all outlook is kept simple.

Though I review this place today...bt m having their food since I was a kid. This place is just beside of my house. I avail their dine in n home delivery...both services. Decoration is simple. Foods are money wise worthy n taste wise very good. I am a fan of their biriyani. Being a non vegetarian I haven't taste their vegetarian dishes yet. Whenever I run out of time yet wish to have restaurant's food my destination is honey da dhaba

The ambiance is just perfect . 

Really the Kababs & Nuns are just awesome ... 

The other chicken side dishes are also very very tasty and Mutton items are also very good .

But I must say that it is not a pocket friendly dhaba :p 

They served every dishes so quickly .

*I would recommend you to go for the nuns , kababs , butter chicken , you can try their koolfi , any mutton side dishes & raita also :)

I have heard a lot about this restaurant but never tried their food as it is located at a place where I travel very less. But a friend planned to give us all treat so I went there today. I found the decor decent not very jazzy and flashy. We ordered a lot of food so individually I won't review all but to talk about the specialities I would say that I found the tangri kebab and chicken tandoori very delicious. The quantity of food is very standard so a plate of biryani can be easily shared by 2 people.. The prices are worth the amount they serve.. Don't miss the lassi cause it will actually give you a flavor of Punjab.. The only negative remark would be the variety of veg dishes that they serve is very less and out of them almost 90% are not available, so for veg people kindly ask before placing the order about the availability of food.
Happy hogging guys..

We visited honey the dhaba on October 20, 2015. The behaviour of the personnel are very cold. They made us sit whereever they chose. Though we were not occupying a large table and the restaurant was almost empty till we left it. The way they serve the food was very rude. But I must confess that the food was good. If you wish to sacrifice your self respect for the quality of food you can visit the restaurant. But my recommendation is..never visit this restaurant.

Decor inside is very average but nit  n clean ambience perfect for family gathering. 

Coming on to the food.. chicken tandoori is one of their signature  dish..
I live the butter Nan bharta and mutton roganjosh as well.. special mention to the chicken rara and their biriyani.. quality and quantity both are good..

All in all a great place for food specially with family..

One of the better North Indian specialty restaurants in the vicinity, this place serves quality dhaba analogous food. The authentic North Indian flavours laced in desi ghee is a treat for dhaba enthusiasts.

The Biryani served here is not satisfying, it can be much better, but the other dishes served pretty well make up for it. The Seekh Kabab was moist, juicy and had good texture, it seemed fried rather than roasted. The Butter Chicken with its thick gravy and loads of butter oil, was impressive and so was the Chicken Bharta. The Butter Naan was fluffy and butter laden and the Lachha Paratha was crisp and flaky, making the Biryani woes diminish. The Kulfi wrapped up the affair effectively.

Overall, with its classy decor, akin to a punjabi house, sizable portions and courteous service, it is an admirable place to dine with friends and family alike.

It's quite a good resturant when it comes to expertise in North Indian cuisine.The ambience,decor and the lighting are quite up to the mark.The staff are friendly and service is quite prompt.Food takes time depending on the itmes you order as they really focus on the food being well cooked.The palak paneer is excellent here,but what really drew my attention here was the special mango ice-cream they serve here which is seasonal.It was completely different from other mango ice-creams i have tasted elsewhere and what comes as a treat that they serve it chilled alphonso mango slices.The only problem is that since it's a seasonal food item you won't get hold of the alphonso slices on other months/seasons except on the month of summer when the mango season sets in.Overall it has been a pleasant food experience here at Honey Da Dhaba.

Quality of the food isn't bad, but they failed miserably in keeping up their standard during festive periods. Reduced the quantity served drastically, and half of the items on the menu wasn't even available. Ambience was good enough, and so was the taste, but the service spoilt the entire thing. Along with the deficiency in the food, the staff was equally unrelenting. They seemed least bothered about customer satisfaction.

This is the quintessential Punjabi eatery (only, you are not seating on charpai under an open sky) where you need to be rude and loud to get a quick service. Once you have mastered that art, you will not have much to complain about. Otherwise, well, try another place.

I have been going to this place ever since it was opened. This was our weekend dinner place. I have seen this place grow to one of the most frequented Punjabi restaurants in the city.

The ambiance is nothing out of the ordinary - you get to hear a lot of heavy cutlery banging against the plates. The occasional loud calls for the waiter. A little argument over an item added to the bill that was never served.

Pure Punjabi place! Very good Punjabi food.

Saw a video about this Restaurant 'Honey da dhaba' on how to cook Chicken bharta.From the very moment I logged in Zomato.com and checked out all the reviews what the Food Critics had to share & was amazed to see mostly positive Reviews about this Restaurant. I thought I should go & give it a try out.But before I went there I checked out the Menus & Photos posted by Public and I was very impressed by the Price tag & decent, lavish Interiors.So I went there the next day & ordered for their Signature dish 'Chicken bharta and Mutton Biryani.I liked the Chicken bharta but the Biryani was spicy and not too good....Finally when I finished my meal I received the bill & I was truly shocked to see the Bill amount was on a higher side....It came upto a total of 1120/-for just two biryanis & chicken bharta accompanied by green salad & a Sprite...thats it. The menu was showing less on Zomato.com thats the reason I thought of trying out their food.But in reality they had never updated the menu on Zomato..shows how irresponsible 'Honey da dhaba' can be. But is it worth? I don't think so.....its way too expensive. I guess they only welcome the Rich only & no ordinary middle class people will want to go back after eating out once......or maybe its their last time they will think thrice before eating out at 'Honey da dhaba' There are still better eat out which will atleast not burn a hole in your pocket.

I only liked the Reshmi Kebabs which I must say was one of the best that I had. Biriyani was no where near to the class like Arsalan, Aminia or even streets of Dalhousie. So if you are Biriyani lover don't order here.

Be it a sudden pang of hunger at office or a typical Sunday family dinner this place is always top of my mind for amazing North Indian food. 
The tangri kabab here is the best of its kind and well cooked with a coat of desi ghee that lingers even after you are done with it
Their Kadai Chicken is another dish that gets me floored every time.
The Kashmiri Polau is a personal favorite , rich in pineapple and dry fruits, well cooked in ghee and looks amazing as well with the sharp long basmati grains. 
Something that will leave this review complete would be their Lassi.  Absolute delight, thick and made with fresh curd served in a huge glass, hard to finish off alone at times.
Overall Honey da Dhaba is a complete package of delicious food at a reasonable price.

Nice place for dinner with family. Food is good. Though not extraordinary. But considering the menu prices I think they have a decent spread that also tastes good. Not much waiting time, god to grab a quick dinner. Extremely well mannered staff. They have a pretty quick delivery service as well. Well, I think they could work on the cleanliness and ambience of the place.

Good food !!!  (personally, I would prefer a take away)One of the few places in Kolkata where you will get to taste authentic North Indian delicacies. Dal , Paneer , Aaloo , Lassi , all have a Punjabi flavor to it. Ambience is not great so you may prefer a take away.   If you like authentic Punjabi flavor  , you will love it.  Must try at least once.

Went with 2 of my friends not so recently. I found the food to be very tasty. Bit on richer side but authentic north Indian food will have that extra calories. This joint is spacious, sparkling clean (including restrooms), sitting is comfy, service is prompt. Both my friends were from NCR. I was tad nervous taking them to north Indian cuisine joint (they asked for it) but when they gave Thumbs Up to the food of this joint, I was relieved. Recommendation: YES

Location wise, this is excellent. You will have no difficulty to find it. But food wise, wasn't as impressive. I had ordered lachcha paratha and reshmi chicken masala. Both appeared tasteless. Moreover my friend who ordered biryani had got a chicken piece with no flesh at all. On top of it, its way too costly for the same food that you get in other restaurants at lower prices. Try to avoid.

A very good Punjabi dhaba which quality has been getting better day by day. The speciality of its butter naan and dal tadka is mind blowing. Have been visiting this place since last 10 years. Never have been let down by their food quality. They have to improve the interiors a lot.

Well this is the dhaba my family has been going for years now. The things that have changed are the price of tandoori chicken has shot high as they cook it really well and ppl used to buy it a lot. Second, mutton rarra Punjabi gravy used to be full of keema in their earlier days and was really tasty but now the content of keema has gone down drastically and so has the taste. The mutton rogan josh we had was really awesome. No doubt as it was the most delicious one I've had in a long time. One more thing, their service used to be very prompt but now somehow it takes a hell lot of time to bring water or the ordered food. It has still got the potential to be a great restaurant if it changes a bit. Pocket pinch for 3 ppl is around 1200.

I was forcefully requested to eat Chicken Pahari Kebab by the hotel guy assuring that if I eat this, every time in future I would love to eat this only, however it was a complete mess... The chicken pieces were uncooked (kachha), & it was also tasteless...
About the chicken bharta, the only thing that I would like to say is, if I request my home cook lady to make chicken keema it would be much better than this...

The only good thing was sweet lime soda & butter nan... Would never visit again for sure...

Dont go by the name as the price here is rilly towards a higher range. Nevertheless, starting with butter chicken, and mutton rogan josh, the food is more than average. But the best thing about this place is the wide range of ice creams it provides. Have never tried pan icecream, nolen gurer icecream before.. And these were really tasty. Should. Defibitely worth a try.

1st time  visit. A quick review is here.

Experience: Good

Ambiance: Quite good

Money talk: Bit expensive

Staffs: Good

Taste & Food Quality: Good but nothing extra-ordinary

(Mutton Boti Kebab and Mutton Tawa Gosht>> The mutton was not well tendered for both the preparations though the taste was ok, Fish Tikka Kebab was good, Tandoori Paneer Tikka was the best among all, Keema-Naan was ok.)

It has got one of best locations near kankurgachi ..along the main road 
..... as regards to parking , the nearby area can be used for parallel parking ....
Ambience inside is quite soothing ... waiters having their own dress 
code .... quite a good place for trying out mughlai food .... 
Regarding starters, chicken lasuni kebab is one of their specialities 
.... tandoori chicken is also nice .... adrak ke punje is ok too .... in 
main course i normally have biriyani ...the rice is long and thin 
(slightly longer than what they serve in arsalan or aminia) .... 
tastewise its good .... polao is also nice ....
Pricing i would say is slightly a bit on the higher side ....
but still its a cheaper option than premium mughlai restuarants like 
Oudh ....
Overall i would say that the overall experience here wont be something 
out of the ordinary , but can surely be recommended for once in a while visit ......

This is the place I always wanted to visit. Now that day has finally come. Today 16th June I was visited here with my besties. Now first of all I would like to say that it is very dissapointing that zomato goes wrong with the price menu picture. Next time I will surely get a picture of the updated menu. Now let me come to the point. We ordered tandoori chicken in the starter, it was fantastic. Then we ordered tandoori roti and masala kulcha with dal makhani. Now the dal makhani was fabulous. On the desert it was my friend who choose the ice cream and it's taste still stick with my tongue. It was a flavour of nolen gur. It was just fantabulous. Now I must say that I would like to be here very frequently again and wish I would try the home delivery. They decor and the ambiance is charming. So 4 out of 5 from me as they burn the roti
;) and the kulcha was just so so.. But a must visit place.

its located in a perfect place for a restaurant..
ambiance was good but when it comes about the food they really does not serve anything special..
we have ordered tandoori chicken as starter which was good..
for main course we ordered mutton biriyani, mutton kasha & tandoori rooti.
taste was average..found nothing special here...

Honey Da Dhaba is a place from where I get my dinner packed often. Although I have never sat inside the restaurant and experienced the ambiance and service standards, I still feel the place is well made and the experience with the staff has been pleasant on most occasions. They serve the typical dhaba food with a mix of Mughlai and Punjabi food. The food is quite consistent. The Biryani might not be as good as Arsalan or Royal but they make a lot of good curries. Try the keema kulcha and the butter chicken.

Visited this place during Durga puja this year after ages. Used to b a regular here once upon a time as it used to b one of the few places which delivered to salt lake. The ambience is horrible, dark, clumsy , wallpaper is practically coming off and they play load Hindi songs and they apparently have the worst collection of them. 
The service was snail slow and the guy came twice to confirm our order coz he kept noting it down wrong. The food arrived after almost 45mins although the restaurant was almost empty. The food was ok nothing worth the wait but the kebab was horrible. Dry almost burnt. The biriyani was not bad but the star  was the the butter naan.

Not a good experience. Ordered Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala, egg tadka and butter roti. Chicken piece size medium, not satisfied. Taste was not exclusive as I used to have in Sharma Dhaba or Jai hind Dhaba. Egg tadka was pathetically bad in taste. Overall extremely disappointed. Wont come again. 3.0 rating only for ambience.

Very Punjabi, Very greasy, Very joyful (if you dig North Indian).
Here's what you should order:
1) Chicken Tandoori - generous pieces, looks and tastes adorable.
2) Chicken Pahari Kebab - rich, spicy, succulent and totally awesome when teamed with a Patiala peg).
3) Mutton Rara Punjabi - enough said 
4) Dal Makhni - they make a very authentic dal makhni  - with dollops of cream and pounds of butter but what the heck, it tastes heavenly with crisp tandoori rotis.
5) Yellow Amritsari Dal - a lighter lentil, a personal favorite - try it with jeera rice, or paratha.
6) Biryani - it is not their forte, but the stuff they make is pretty much palatable.

The revised prices are a bit on the higher side, but portion sizes are good.
P.S - There is always a very, very long queue at the takeaway counter. So try and enjoy a sit-and-eat meal, if you may.

I visited this place quite some time back and finally managed to write a review on that. The exterior didn't really insppire me but I did hear the name from quite a few people to actually take myself there.
The food is pretty good but the prices are sky high almost when you compare with the quantity they serve. I had the biryani which was pretty good. Other than that I had the butter chicken and butter nan, but then again the price is too high.
The service is good but at times you'll find this place overcrowded and you may not like the ambiance then.
I didn't have an experience that will compell me to visit this place again.

The Lasuni chicken kabab had such a great flavour and aroma! The good old chicken reshmi kababs and chicken tikkas are also brilliant!  I am in love with their kababs!! :) The Biriyani is also good and contains less oil than many others that I have tried, which is a very good thing!

naan or kulcha with their signature dal makhani or chicken bharta will b a nice combo with kebabs to add on some more flavour...not too spicy yet very tasty...also try their perfect tandoori chicken and mutton specialties...common items but cooked and served with some superb taste...
highly recommended

The first ever north Indian restaurant to open in this part of town was Honey da Dhaba. I remember my father taking us to this restaurant during the late eightees/ early ninetees to treat us on the occasion of my birthday. The food then was equivalent to the taste of restaurants in Central Kolkata of those days. The service was equally professional. I loved the chicken tandoori and chicken bharta of Honey da Dhaba. The bharta still remains a speciality of this restaurant. It is a cliched dish but the taste here is superb. With the passing of years the restaurant has lost its charm with the opening of malls and restaurants  in this area over the last ten years. We ordered for home delivery from Honey da Dhaba once and they were quite quick and prompt in service. The food quality and taste was more or less the same that we had tasted years ago. Recently they have revamped the interior and also changed the signage which has helped people in noticing it once again.

After hearing a lot I finally went today. Had chicken lasuni kabab. It was awesome. The chicken was soft and the lasun quantity was perfect. I suggest not to leave the place without trying it. Then we had chicken tawa kali mirch. The dish had boneless chicken pieces in thick gravy with vegetables. The dish was also good but the chicken could have been softer. Bread platter was also nice. Atleast we had kulfi which was also very good. The staff were well behaved, cooperative nd soft spoken. Punjabi music sets the mood. The only compliant I had was their quantity which was a lot.

I went to celebrate my Anniversary here & was delighted! The ambience was homely and no one could ask for a more courteous staff. And then there was food... Avant grade food! The tandoori chicken was cooked to perfection. It was spicy, smoky, juicy... We drooled over it. The Rara chicken and chicken bharta were almost forgotten in its wake. The Pudina paratha stole our hearts. The garlic naan had more butter than the paratha had oil. Rich, creamy lassi worked as palate cleanser. Finally the kesar pista rabri kulfi made our night. Thank you honey da dhaba for making my special day end so well. I will definitely visit many more times to come.

Its good to know that honey da dhaba has become a part of zomato's 'dhabe di shaan'.,I have been visiting this place for a long time but never got an opportunity to write a review..
Honey da dhaba is among the oldest dhaba's of Kolkata n truly hv been serving some good food on the table..
The staff being humble n polite..the ambience being satisfactory though..
Food presented to us has yummy taste,perfectly cooked which definitely leaves a smile on our face..
I would just like to thank the entire cooking manangemnt of honey da dhaba..n m sure u would be serving us in d same always..:)

Beware of this joint because of its sheer callousness and pathetic Service.   
Ordered a take away and relied on the food packets received. It’s a Mistake because this restaurant proved that restaurant service personnel can never be trusted. 
GUILTY!!!
Ruined my Dinner with family. 

ORDERED and RECEIVED: 

I ordered a Full Dhaba Chicken Tandoori---received some poor quality chicken tandoori with no accompaniments. Forget Chutney/raita not even courtesy salad.

Next I ordered Mixed Vegetable---Received Mix rice, a totally different item.

Ordered Tandoori Roti---Received. At least they didn’t mess up the roti. 

These people are so hopeless that they gave rice, roti and chicken tandoori and didn’t even bother to check that the order seems so nonsensical. Surely they lack common sense. According to them a normal person will order roti, rice and a dry tandoori.  
How can they interpret a simple mixed vegetable with Mix Rice? 

These people lack sense or its simply to annoy customers, I am not sure because they have done some hell of a job, Kudos. They don't know or care what to add as accompaniments with a Chicken Tandoori, a dhaba staple. 
Gave chicken tandoori but no salad and lemon. Sometimes i feel it is totally up to their mood, if they feel like adding the right accompaniments they will add salad and lemon in right amounts but if they don’t they will give you some pickle and some onion chunks. 
Waste of money is what this joint is.
Totally ruined our MOOD.

When we called the restaurant requesting to change the Rice, which they callously placed instead of vegetable, they said we have to come down to the restaurant for a change as if its our fault. Not at all Cooperative even with there so called home delivery fleet.

Now Coming to the quality: 

It can be anything from Very Good some day to pathetic. 

The Chicken Tandoori received today was really bad.
Just last week we ordered from the same place, they gave perfectly nice and juicy Chicken Tandoori (The reason we dared to order again) but today it was not even average. And these kind of surprises have started becoming pretty regular here at least with my last few months of order. I was a pretty regular customer five years back. The experience was something to remember/cherish but the last few encounters totally ruined all the fond memories with this joint.

NOW, THIS PLACE IS TOTALLY UNRELIABLE ON FOOD QUALITY, SERVICE and DELIVERY.

The Home delivery is UNRELIABLE.. Few months back I ordered over phone at 7 in the evening, which they promised to deliver by 9:30 pm, but received the same at 10:50 pm. There were kids, hungry and waiting for this insensitive restaurant's delivery personnel.  

So simply put it’s a Total risk Joint. So DARE to EAT!!!

Good Job HONEY DA DHABA you just successfully lost a customer. Don't forget the Geometric Progression. 
I think calling this place a dhaba would be derogatory to all the awesome highway dhabas.

As it is quiet closer to my place, I have visited that place few times. The thumbs up from me is the authenticity and quality they maintain in their food items. The service the provide is okayish. The only thumb down from me is the parking problem. And at times the shut it down before scheduled time. So I came back home with an empty tummy and broken heart.

The first thing I will tell if you expect an ambience of a roadside highway dhaba, you will be disappointed. It is just a name. But the overall decor is good. I have been there quite a few times and I am never disappointed. Service is quite good. 

Coming to the food, tandooris and kababs are really a cool option as starter. I mostly try kababs. Reshmi kabab, Chicken tikka kabab, Lassoni kabab, Mutton boti kababs all these taste awesome. But one thing I must say, try atleast one mutton dish here. Mutton dishes are really great here with soft meat. In spite of its fantastic quality of food, I must say dishes are little overpriced.

I hold this place as one of the best restaurant serving pleasant food around the Kankurgachi area for years. Because Im visiting them for last 10-12 years. All the occasions are celebrated at my home with HONEY-da-DHABA's food, specifically BIRYANI.
I love the biryani, dal makhni, chicken tikka kabab, tandoori, Dal tarka the most. Mutton do piaza could not satisfy my expectation.Once we ate peas pulao which was not bad also.
The ambience is good.
The location is just opposite the ESI hospital and on the stretch between Ultadanga to Phoolbagan.
The staffs are not good. they don't have detailed idea about the food they are serving..
I don't understand their DHABA name which don't match at all.
The price is not budgeted now. It has shoot up over the past 10 years.
The lighting is too dark which I feel need a modification.

Good afternoon all, a truely amazing experience for me & my family. From the monet I stepped in till the time I left, i felt like they have tried everything they could to make me comfortable. I read all the reviews and decided to take my wife and the rest of the family to have North Indian delicacies. And, Honey was upto it, be it a starter or a main course, everything I ordered, had a Amritsari/Jalandhari aroma. We had Kebabs, Tandoori Roti, Tawa Gosht (mutton) and in the end Lassi, however, i tasted Kulfi and it was much better than any other desserts available there. However, apart from it being a bit expensive, everything else is superb!!! And, I am waiting to revisit & reinvent the North Indian delicacies with Honey.:)

Good service, good ambiance and good food sums up Honey da Dhaba. Expensive or I should say little over-priced. I have read some reviews here about Honey da Dhaba. People think since the name has the word Dhaba in it, it should have the look and feel of a highway dhaba. Then these people must be expecting to see elephants at Hatibagan, bananas at Kelabagan. Common guys it's just a name. A fancy name. 



Anyways, moving ahead with the food, I have tried their Mutton Biryani, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Chicken Tikka Kabab, Chicken Reshmi Masala, Peas Pulao, Vegetable Jhal Frezi, Palak Paneer, Naan, Tandori Roti, Masala Kulcha. I have not been disappointed with any of these. Found the mutton in mutton biryani to be really soft. Everything's good about this place except the price. Over-priced!!

talk about service so its very slow..waiters hardly listen you , and finally the main thing food.. yeah i must admit food is good.. it gives punjabi real taste , i love its chicken bharta, dal makhani, reshmi kebaabs,naans are soft. but its over priced i should say, its expensive. and rahter it doesnt matches with the word ''dhaba'' its no where like dhaba whether compare with decor or price..

One of my favorites since childhood. The Lasuni Chicken is simply out of the world along with rest of the tandoori items and other preparations. But then the sudden unreasonable price hike is of concern. The food is no doubt "A class" but the pocket pinch is a bit too much. The ambiance is not bad. Nonetheless the quality of food remains the same since the last couple of years.

This is one of the places whereby tandoori dishes are yummy but the name Dhaba is a mismatched one. The taste is not at all like dhaba and it's pretty expensive too. The taste is good but service is slow. The ambience is alright not something to brag about. In weekends it's super crowded. Otherwise an average restaurant.

Oh...what a surprise...I never saw such a decrease of quality and quantity of the food in a very short time..yes I am saying about HONEY DA DHABA Four months ago I went to the restaurant with my friends and my experience was very good. Today 12.08.2014 I had revisited the resurgent for lunch. In between four months price of almost all food items had been increased 60-70% but in Zomato old  rate chart was given. The quality of the food became very poor and quantity of food has been reduced to almost 50% or lower than that. Special mutton biriyani costs Rs.340 and one Kashmiri polao Rs. 190 (Taxes extra) which is not at all sufficient for a single people. Along with that one tandoori roti was like a 'PAPAD' and one butter nun turned into a very very thin 'PARATHA'. When we complained the competent authority they showed complete ignorance to us and they were not at all bothered about our dissatisfaction. I strongly recommend  others not to go there rather avoid the restaurant. People who had very good experience about the restaurant must be aware of that the HONEY THE DHABA restaurant is only the shadow of its old form. Do not go there., if you go there, believe me you will be a looser....

Today, I went with 6 of my friends with lots of expectation to have some good quality of punjabi food, but sorry to say..I felt very disappointed with the quality and most importantly with the portion size of the food served to us. This is the third time, I went to this dhaba, but this time the experience is not upto to the mark and not at all satisfied with food items. I am not going to visit the place any more...I will not  refer my friends to go there at all.

It's rich and high on flavors in general, we have tried delivery also and they deliver it well packed and hot. A good option whenever I am really hungry and in the mood for a heavy meal.

The very first thing I would like to mention is the PRICE HIKE. The menu displayed doesn't portray the updated cost. The restaurant is 12.5 km away from my house but I still made an effort to go there or a different perspective would be that I had no better options.

The restaurant was a spacious one with a takeaway option as well. We were immediately greeted and guided to a table. The ambiance was very nice but a little bit of music would have added a topping to that. The decorations were very nice. While you enter you would notice huge mirrors on left side of the wall which gave an impression of a much bigger room than it actually was. There was a 42 inch TV (I guess) on the left wall to the table in which we were seating which shows that they have paid enough attention to the interior decoration. The waiter was very quick to give us the menu. This restaurant has been on my wishlist for long and I was aware what I would order.

We ordered CHICKEN LASUNI KABAB for starters and CHICKEN RARA PUNJABI and KABULI NAAN for the main course. We had to wait for a little while before the starters arrived and the thing which bugged me was that the starters for the adjacent table was delivered before ours although they came in late. Probably that was because of the choice of starters but human mentality or my mentality. Anyways the wait was not at all a waste. The kebabs which was served were delicious, tender, juicy. It had an mouth watering aroma to it. The chutney served went well with the kebabs. I have had kabuli naan only once before which had small bits of cherry on top and was of the impression something similar would come. But I think the distinguishing factor about these naan is the sweet taste. the ones served here was coated with caramelized peanuts and lots of peanuts. The side dish bore a typical Punjabi look with coriander leaves and that hint of extra oil or butter on top. The pieces served were wholesome and either had leg pieces or breast pieces.

I am mentioning the increased prices of the few things which I had which would give others a fair idea.

CHICKEN LASUNI KABAB --> 235/- (half plate)
CHICKEN RARA PUNJABI --> 320/-
KABULI NAAN --> 80/piece

I think ZOMATO should update the COST FOR TWO from 700/- to 900/-.

P.S. -- A word of advice even if you are very hungry order one naan per person (at-least kabuli naan). I feel that's sufficient enough to fill you to the brim if not they have a quick service.

The punjabi dhaba in north kolkata. The decor looks in like a well carved punjabi house. Food is awesome but quantity is less . I would be cursing this restaurant a lot for its slow service. But the variety of assorted tandoori dishes that this restaurant offers,definitely deserves a thumbs up. One can opt for the Chicken Lasooni Kebab and Mutton Boti Kebab for starters. It is easy to gulp them with a glass of Pepsi(any day). The staff is courteous but lack the earlier confidence.

Have been honey da dhaba thrice. Tried a variety of dishes. The best punjabi dhaba in north kolkata. The decor looks in like a well carved punjabi house. To start with u can go in for the tandooris. Go in for mutton adrak ka panje if u love mutton or chicken lasooni kebab if chicken is what u love. U can also try their tawa specialities-tawa murgh kali mirch. As for the main course  try their keema nan, they prepare it so well. Or if u wanna go for something experimental try mirch piyaz ka kulcha.  side dish try mutton jalfrezi for mutton seekers n chicken rara punjabi for chicken goers. At last try the kesar pista rabri kulfi. Its one of its kind. N after all the experience ur heart is bound to do balle balle..

To avoid traffic and hassle to park street after a tiring day at office, I chose to land up to this place with my family. I was expecting I would get soups, but alas this wasn't available. I thought I would get masala kola/fresh lime soda at least, but the waiter said they were out of stock. So finally I had to restrict myself by ordering chicken lehsuni kabab, tengri kebab, mutton boti kebab. The chicken lehsuni kabab, tengri kebab were "okay types", but mutton boti kebab was tasty and soft. In main course, we ordered Tandoori Roti and tawa ghost, chciken rara punjabi. Tawa ghost was nice, spicy and tasty but the chicken rara punjabi neither looked proper nor tasted good. Tandori rotis too were bit hard to tear apart. As a whole I give 3.5 to this place.

The place is always crowded. However the food is really good and value for money. The huge glassful of lassi is a must try. Almost all the dishes were very good. However I had very bad experience when I tried to pack lunch one day. It took almost 3 hours for them to get the food ready and I'll definitely not try their take away counter ever again.

Approximately fifteen years back, this dhaba was a boon to the residents of Kakurgachi and Phoolbagan. In the absence of no good diner nearby, and with the established notion of rushing to Park Street for all family dinners and other get togethers, this one was like a lagoon in the desert. Also, it served excellent food and was the first dhaba with high end restaurant like décor and reception. Needless to say, it attracted customers even from the far off corners of Kolkata. Their parcel counter beside the entrance gate was as much a hit as their inside dining option. In those days, we had visited it frequently and also a couple of times later in the following years.

Out of the blue moon, we decided to give it a visit recently and it felt nothing like the old times. Though the wood work is intact, but the upholstery (chair seats) needs serious repair.  Paintings on the wall are still thematic, but they don’t exude quality.  The staff is courteous but lack the earlier confidence. 

Being vegetarians, we ordered Dal Tadka, Navratan Korma, Tandoori Roti and Mirch Pyaz Ka Kulcha. Dal was OK and Kulcha was awesome. Navratan Korma had Panner Butter Masala gravy! Neither it looked nor tasted proper.

Most of the menu caters to non vegetarian food items.

Pros: One of my personal favourite. The most cherished destination from very young age. If you're lookin' for real Punjabi Khana in the town, you should definitely check-in. Offers the best-in-class North Indian delicacies in good environment.
Cons: Small space
Don't leave the place without: Havin' the best of North Indian thalis!

I would be cursing this restaurant a lot for its slow service. But the variety of assorted tandoori dishes that this restaurant offers,definitely deserves a thumbs up. One can opt for the Chicken Lasooni Kebab and Mutton Boti Kebab for starters. It is easy to gulp them with a glass of Pepsi(any day). The quality of Biryani is just fine over here.If I was a  Second timer over here I would definitely go for the chicken butter masala and naan roti. The vegetarian section is a trial in this restaurant,not so popular, but a trial is ok enough.Wrap up the dinner with the Pan flavored ice-cream.

I have visited this restaurant many years back, so can't remark about decor now. but just few days back when i wanted to order food home delivered to my place is suddenly remembered this place. i ordered daal tadka, tandoori chicken, chicken tikka reshmi masala and butter naan. and the total bill was 1000. it's completely VFM i would say. the taste of tandoori chicken was awesome. they did not add any red color and the chicken was fresh and juicy. the pieces were really big. the daal tadka was good. the chicken tikka masala was very good. overall definitely worth it.

This place, beyond doubt, serves the best Tandoori Chicken in town (hands down!) Had Dal Makhani and Butter Chicken with Tandoori Roti for main course, which was most average.  But it's worth visiting this place only for its Tandoori Chicken. I saw a plate of Reshmi Tikka on almost every table, so I shall give that a try too on my next visit.

I have been coming here very often. Today also went here for lunch literally starving. When you enter this restaurant it gives you a chilled ambience and a good Indian theme. Big mirrors and dim lights are ecstatic.
But today for the first time it lacked hospitality. We have been waiting there for almost 10 minutes and no one came to attend us. One of them were chatting with the person in Cash. Wasn't really bothered about customers, very disappointing.
However he somehow felt the need and decided to come and take orders. Their menu had a severe price hike. Anyway we ordered chicken korma egg tarka and 5 tandoori rotis.
Food was served prompt. Tarka had good quantity. But chicken disappointed me big time. Though it tasted mighty fine but two small boney pieces were served with a tumbler full of gravy. Concerned with their price it was a bad sight.
On the whole today's lunch experience in this overtly decorated restaurant went not so well.

Yesterday was really hot and humid. In order to escape from the scorching sun, I made a dash for the nearest restaurant available. Looked up zomato and it pointed Honey Da Dhaba. I have been there in the past but it was a long back. So with mu hopes high I went in, The place looked the same with a lighting fixtures added. For the entire period I was there I just noticed two service staff, too few for a restaurant this big. Well I sat down looked at the menu and ordered a Chicken Lehsuni Kabab and a mutton biryani. Since I was a regular a year back so was looking forward bto the kabab. But to my disappointment it was horrible. Just tasted like raw spices rubbed over the chicken. I immediately inquired from a server whom I knew, that whether the old cook has left. He told me yes it's a new one cooking. Listening to this I got worried about the biryani and I was right,  burned mutton in the biryani and the rice was kind of stir fried. Couldn't eat after a few spoonful.  So ordered a soft drink and informed the staff about the degradation of food quality, paid the check and left.

It was perhaps the most disappointing lunch I ever had. This place has indeed lost it's charm.

Being a South Calcuttan, I had somehow neglected this jewel all these years though I hd heard abt it quite often. But the perks of being an insanely spontaneous foody, suddenly without any rzn decided to check it out. And boy o boy.. How cd I have missed perhaps tthe best North Indian resto in town. Their tandoori was one of the very best I hd ever had only closely followed by Barbeque. Butter chicken was silky smooth on the tongues and Mutton was as soft as can be. The only resto that gives competition to this is Punjabi Rasoi dwn south.
One remarkably high scoring point abt this joint is its pricing. I bet u... any resto dwn south with this kinda suave decor wd have pinched u double the money. Hats off to the NORTH (of Kolkata and India) !!!

Honey Da Dhaba is total value for money and high on taste,their kebabs and gravy items are made quite well and the quantity is always more than enough . I have always done home delivery, it does take a bit long, but the food is worth the wait. In this part of town it is a relief and sheer foodie's delight. Must recommend for those who want to tuck into Murgh Reshmi masala, and the kebabs...

Though a bit costly but a great place to dine with your friends and family. Located at Salt lake, Honey da Dhaba is serving quality food since years...The recommended food is always Tandoor items whether its a Reshmi kebab or Chicken Tandoori. Tandoori Chicken tastes great and got the angaara cooked flavor that we find in the streets of Amritsar, Delhi or Chandigarh.

If you stay at Salt lake or North Kolkata, come and try the Tandoor items..they will serve you even if you come at 12AM.

3.8 for Ambiance.

First thing first, this is one of the best restaurants I have been in Kolkata.
I have been here numerous times.
Here are my three favourite dishes of this place.
1. Kheema Naan
Stuffy, meaty and aromatic. I love the taste of this wholesome naan. The flavors are rightly balanced.
2. Tawa Murg
White chicken stir-fried with lots of black pepper, green chillies, onions and green bell-pepper. This tastes fresh and raw. I just love it.
3. Nalen-gud ka Ice cream
This is something new tasted here in Kolkata. The icecream made of khajur ka gud. This icecream tastes so indian. I love the  flavor of the jaggey in it.

Honey the Dhaba has been serving up consistently good food for many years now and people who live close by or in Salt Lake swear by it. The dishes that I would highly recommend are Tandoori Chicken , Dal Tadka , Keema Egg Masala which is delicious (and I discovered thanks to Zomato) and almost all the kebabs which are pretty good. The Butter Naan , Masala Kulcha are all great accompaniments to the mains. For veggie options beside the Dal Tadka I can vouch for the Paneer Butter Masala , Channa Masala and Tandoori Alu Butter Masala.



----- 05 Jan, 2013 -----

This place has been around for a while and though they are located a bit far from my regular eating haunts I usually take the trouble to go because I like the food they serve. They don't make the best food in the city but they can be depended on to make a good wholesome meal and they have maintained the standard which is commendable. The chicken bharta is excellent as is the keema matar. Their rotis are all uniformly good so take your pick. The tandoori chicken and dal also deserve a mention.

Aah a great place to sit and eat amazing Punjabi cuisine. I love the tandoori chicken and the chicken butter masala here. The nun is soft and tender and it goes well with the tender juicy chicken pieces that they serve. I have eaten here many times both with friends and family and I have liked the experience every single time. What I do not like is that it is a bit pricey but I guess good food requires good price. I also have an issue with the service bordering on the slow side but then life is not perfect, is it! I say drop in at least once and then you decide on your own whether you want in again or not! I would have given it a 3.5 but the fact that i love its interiors makes me give this place a 4.0

This is a place near to my house and me and my family are frequent visitors. it is a very busy restaurant and you might have to wait in a queue at peak hours. the ambience is beautiful, its decorated in a very posh manner. I would call it a family restaurant because people visiting this place generally come with familly. the service is quite good, the waiters are really warm make you feel at home. Now, the food, excellent punjabi food, that is what you should expect. The food is familiar but oozing with flavour, everything from the naan to the tandoor to the chatni provided with the tandoori chicken will leave you wanting for more. MUST HAVE: nolen gurer icecream, trust me when i say it is exceptional and tastes absolutely of nolen gur. Its just beautiful. if you are into paan then you should also try the paan flavoured ice cream. Over all, a great place to catch up with friends or family! my family just wants to go back for more.....:)

It was my bday treat.. with family.. a very private party of 3 people.. & I wanted it simple! I had been a very frequent visitor to Honey da Dhaba some years back but heard of some very average reviews recently.. This time, we had very little time in hand and that made us ready to take a risk!

We entered at around 8.45 pm and the dhaba was half empty which was expected considering it was Monday night.. We were greeted by a waiter but in a non-welcome mood.. We ourselves had to find out the table and get seated.. Anyways, we were handed over the Menu card immediately.. 

The ambience is nice.. with wooden decor and a large LCD (which was turned off to my disappointment), huge and heavy glasses and punjabi dress clad waiters.. feel good overall!

A friend of mine had suggested to order Chicken Lasooni kabab and I went with her choice.. Added one Fish Tikka kabab also.. For main course we had settled for Garlic Nun, Butter Nun, Masala Kulcha and Chicken Tikka Masala. 

The Lassoni kabab was served quite fast..Trust me, it was heaven.. four big chunks of chicken kabab, mildly spiced, awesomely flavoured! Though the green chutney was a letdown I feel and lacked the kick. Then arrived the Fish Tikka which was again a wonder! The melt-in-the-mouth texture actually enhanced the lightly flavoured fish chunks! We were contended.. till heart and stomach as well!!

We wanted some break before the main course arrives but we were not allowed and it was served in a while! The masala kulcha tasted good but could be crispier.. The garlic nun was crispy but raw garlic pieces spread over the surface spoilt the charm.. Butter nun was usual.. Chicken Tikka masala was a turn on again! Succulent pieces of chicken kabab in coriander based creamy gravy.. not too spicy.. was a perfect side with the nun and kulchas.. 

We washed the food off with Sweet Lime Soda.. The bill read 1559/-, perfect to such a meal! Satisfied! 

P.S. Will definitely come back for the biryani, it looked tempting!!

Honey Da Dhaba is bit of expensive if we consider all the facilities and ambiance they provide. But the food quality is no doubt very good. Chicken tanduri and Chicken Butter Masala are some of my fav in this restaurant. Location is in very important place so crowd is never an issue for this restaurant.

during the Durga Pujas, even the best of restaurants serve the worst of meals. it is something that we are somehow mentally prepared for. and why not, doesn't matter what ever you serve, with the kind of rush,  surely everything sells out.
but then my friend took me to honey da dhaba. it was past midnight but still there was a considerable queue. and it really was worth the wait. we loved the food. every item was excellent, and though they had said that it would take some time to serve, I say it was much quicker than  we anticipated. 
so, in a nutshell, I think everyone is going to luv it.

enough good and bad have been spoken about this place lately. i guess it all depends on which side of the bed you wake up. jokes apart, the place is anything unlike a dhaba; clean interiors, dim lighting, comfy chairs, and maharaja styled dress of the waiters. the service is slow, albeit, but the food is amazing. the prices are reasonable and the portions are quite a lot. 
i had previously only ordered kebab takeaways from here and didnt venture in the restaurant. it was by chance that we decided to visit this place and we, by no means, were disappointed. 
a thumbs up for the food, a great place for the punjabi cuisine lovers and addicts.

I have visited this restaurant very recently on September 01, 2013 with friends. The only thing that comes to my mind now is that we indeed made a "BAD CHOICE"... Their service has gone down, its terrible to be there...its depressing...the waiters are always showing a lackadaisical attitude....They serve mineral water bottles without glasses when asked for then also you need to wait for another 10-15 mins.....Plates come before giving ordering MENU !! U need to show your disgust in every minute to whip the waiters for doing work or in that case for taking your MENU ORDER!!! Really amazing service, I must say....Folks, DO NOT visit this restaurant, else you will land up in a mess....I repeat, the service is agonizing and excruciating.

Brother got married, after months of preparations and celebrations ,finally it was over. Unlimited fun, countless restaurants, pubs, lounges in last 20 days. And finally we realized he was going to leave in 4 days to New York with Bhabi . So, we needed a proper family dinner . Nothing special but a peaceful family night with gossips and smiles . 
Honey Da Dhaba, near to our place, 20 minutes max. Been there before , loved it . So yeah, I suggested again , we should go to this place only.

LOCATION : 
On Ultadanga- Kankurgachi main road , one of the major arteries in north Kolkata . On the right side if you are coming from ultadanga side . Very easy to notice as the signboard is big and glows pretty well. 

Parking :
You can park your car in the 3rd lane, but the risk will be yours. But I guess they have some sort of JUGAAD, that they allow you to park there with some 10-20 bucks without receipt.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE : 
The first thing you'll notice is the door. Huge piece of wood.  lol , jokes apart ! Nice Decor ! I love the interior , Lighting is dim , perfect for foodie type of an ambiance . Waiters are well behaved , will advice you what will be suitable for you according to your choice. They wear typical Punjabi Dress that goes well with the name DHABA.

FOOD: 
Well lets talk about the real part now, Food. The tandoor section in the menu is something ! each and every dish is good. Ive been there 5-6 times and tried 12-14 dishes . None of them disappointed me. But the last time we went there we ordered dishes which are a must try !
1. CHICKEN PAHADI KABAB - excellent kababs , big pieces ! spicy and properly cooked . 

2. CHICKEN LASUNI KABAB - 4 gigantic pieces of kabab, tasted like heaven ! slightly on the neutral side neither spicy 
                                                   nor sweet.
3. TANDOORI PRAWN's -  One of the best tandoori prawns i've tasted ! Before that the best one for me for this was the
                                            dish was Golcunda Bowl from Delhi, but this can surely beat that ! Size really does matter .                                           And when you are in Bengal you are pretty sure about the quality of the prawns served. 
                                            Proper tendered prawns with beautiful garnishing . You will start licking your fingers once you
                                           are done with the dish.

4. CHICKEN TANDOORI :  You are at a restaurant which has "Dhaba" in it , so the last thing you should order for starters 
                                            has to be Chicken Tandoori , Well to be precise it's nothing special though. I've tasted better 
                                            ones in Kolkata. Still if you are fond of it. Go for it, its not bad either.

5. MUTTON BIRIYANI :  Well well , main course , Biriyani . Not of typical Kolkata style. Bit on a hyderabadi side. The rice
                                         is very nicely cooked and so is the mutton, Soft tendered meat which melts in your mouth,         
                                         Huge quantity ! One serving is enough for almost two . A proper biriyani you can say. Not of 
                                         typical Arsalan or Saabir style . But I like it.

The food is good, The ambiance is good, staffs/waiters well behaved, nice ambiance , Brilliant Mughlai Non-veg dishes. But slightly on a costly side. Go in there, you wont be dissatisfied . Take my words for it. But it is certainly not an everyday place as I told earlier . A full plate of biriyani costs around 300 bucks , which is very high according to kolkata standards . So not a very pocket friendly place to be in  I will rate it 4 out of 5 :)

If you are a passionate foodie ie. if you are interested in experiencing taste of Punjabi and Indian food in the town, Honey da Dhaba near Kankurgachhi is one of the best available options in the town.. I have visited the restaurant for more than 15 times at least and all d time i look for kababs, tandooris and biriyanis. i find value for money here and strongly reccommend Lasooni Kabab as a Must Try !!!

Honey da Dhaba is a restaurabt which offers one of the most delicious food in the town. The dishes are extremely tasty and healthy. The rates are very reasonable too. I prefer 'Take Away' because the rates are comparatively very high when you sit and eat at the restaurant. I love the CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA and BUTTER CHICKEN here. I would recomend you to visit the restaurant and have a bite. You will love it.

Located near Kankurganchi  on the  CIT Road ,initially  this restaurant used to serve simple  Punjabi Dhaba style food. However since the last decade or so they also included Chinese , Moghlai as well as Thai food but  with restricted choice. There is a problem regarding Parking , but thanks  to some arrangement made available.
The decor is simple & ambience is okay.The waiters dressed in a Punjabi attire add to its overall  glamour. I must say that they have maintained their quality since its inception & the food is  delicious  & service is good.I tried the Amritsari Fish Tikka which was very well made but the portion offered ( 04 standard  pieces served ) compared to the price was very pinching. Tandoori Chicken too was nice & soft .For the main course I tried Kadai Chicken along with Kabuli Nan & Pineapple Raita. I settled for their famous Rabri Kulfi  & must say that at the end of the day I returned home with a very satisfied feeling! Don't forget to have the pan( I am an occasional chewer ) from the shop adjacent to it as it is a good compliment to such a sumptuous meal!
One must visit with the family as I am sure you will enjoy the food!
PS: Their takeaway counter is just outside the main entrance & always busy! They  also give free delivery within certain limits  &  a minimum order value!

Very good food. Punjabi and north Indian. They serves a buffet too, at least they used to when I've last visited them few months back. Very descent Tandoori and Kebabs. Rotis and currys and dals. Their show stoppers are Chicken bharta, Plain/chicken tarka and chicken tandoori. Biryani and others are also very good. Very worth trying.

I had the best punjabi food here in kolkata, till today. The decor is really nice. Service is also good. Cost is high. All the dishes they we had were good like fish tandoori, chicken tandoori, the butter nun, kulcha, paneer, malai kopta etc. The preparation of mutton was also good, with soft mutton pieces. Lassi was also good. The most remarkable one is the kulfi. I can confirm that it was the best kulfi, I ever had.

This is one of the worst restaurants in east Kolkata. They are simply surviving on their road side location and old name. Earlier it was a decent one. But now when there are so many good restaurants around, there are no improvements seen here in any sector, be it is food quality, ambience, variety etc. Being myself a cook and a foodie, I can easily figure out that the taste of all the gravy based popular chicken preparations like butter chicken, Chicken tikka butter masala, Chicken bharta etc. are almost same and enriched with cream, dalda etc cheap ingredients. But the price is tooooo high and not at all worth their food standard. One can have very good meal in any other star rated high standard restaurant in the same price. They are making customers fool and capitalizing their love for food!  That is unfair & unethical but who cares !

The old-is-gold dhaba in Kankurgachhi!! This place serves hearty North Indian and Chinese food, has both dine-in and takeaway facilities. It is open till midnight which is an added advantage.

The portions are huge, and it's best to come here in a group. I loved their lassi. Then we ordered masala kulcha, daal makhani, and chicken bharta. The service was not very fast, but again it was a Saturday night and the place was full. Overall I liked their food and it did not burn a big hole in our pocket.

FOOD- 2/2.5
As a regular visitor of this place, the food has never failed to amaze me - even in the chaos of a Sapatami durga pujo night.
The tandoori chicken is a must have starter(which i consider to be one of the best in the city). The chicken is tender with all the spices well infused in it. The mutton boti kebab and the kakori kebab are also delicious
Their pudina parathas and masala kulcha are really well prepared . but what makes the joint stand out are their mouth watering meat dishes with each having their own characteristic flavours. the chicken amritsari and mutton keema matar are the my favourites
For the veg dishes,dal fry,  navaratna korma and palak paneer really make their mark on the palate.
I simply love their tutty fruity though it can be difficult to have the entire thing after having a full meal.
the portions are really good and more than adequate for 2 person.
PS do try out their aachars

Service- 1/1
Fast and efficient service and the waiters have a good knowledge of the food the serve. Even the takeaway service is pretty fast

Ambiance- 1/1 
the inside decor is really beautiful, sooting music and their huge lcd tv are a real plus during man utd matchday weekends

Cost (from the view of a college student)
a tad bit on the higher side but totally worth it. but cant give the extra 0.5

total - 4/5

PERFECT PLACE TO DINE OUT WITH FAMILY.

"IGNORE THE REST .... OOyyeee !!!! Punjabi is the best ....."

you would be delighted to taste the punjabi items ..... Be it the Tadka Daal (Ooye makkhan maar ke !!!) or the lassi .....

HONEY DA - DHABA STYLED FARE!

Though Honey Da Dhaba serves Chinese, North Indian and Thai fare, it is their North Indian fare that ranks very high among diners. The food service is quick but the servers need to be more informative and approachable. There is nothing much to say about the interiors. It is not a fancy restaurant, though the ambience and decor are simple and pleasing to the eyes. This is a great eating out option for a wholesome Punjabi meal. No matter how many times you dine there, the food standard is always the same. 

The place is well known and most sought after for their different and diverse mouthwatering kebabs. Some of their popular and much ordered north Indian kebab items are Fish Tikka kebab, Chicken Hariyali kebab, Chicken Tikka, Chicken Reshmi kebab and Chicken tandoori. All of these delicious meat dishes are to be had with their equally well prepared nans and rotis.  

A special mention must be made of their masala kulchas. The kulchas at Honey Da Dhaba are big and light with generous amount of masala stuffing.  Their nuns and roti can be had with the following dishes: Chicken Butter Masala, Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Chicken, Mutton Keema Matar, Mutton Rogan Josh and Mutton Rara Punjabi. Once again, a meal at a dhaba is incomplete without ordering the good old lassi to be had with your food. The meal can be rounded off with their desserts like kulfi, Firni, tutty fruity or their dessert of the day.
In comparison with other classy Punjabi restaurants, the prices of food here seem reasonable. At the same time, this is not a place for authentic North Indian food at economical prices. The prices are quite high in comparison to the food portions served here. Nevertheless, if you don't mind burning a hole in your pocket; this place definitely warrants a visit for authentic and genuine North Indian food.

This place gives damn nice Dhaba Punjabi food. I just love their Chicken Tandoori, it's absolutely awesomely made. The ambience is reasonably done up but nothing great I would say. 
The chinese section is not that good but average, I feel you should try the North Indian cuisine rather than the Chinese cuisine. The prices are reasonable and apt if you compare with the food quality and quantity. 
The staff are ok but need to be more affluent, but nevertheless they try to help you as much as they can. 
Overall I am impressed with this place and rate it 4. You should definitely try this one without fail.

went here just last week with my mom after a long day. This restaurant has been here for ages but some how havent been here. This was just my second visit here. The interiors are good but nothing great about it. We sat down and ordered for our meals which included fish tikka kabab, naan and mutton rogan josh, we did ask for lassi but they didnt have it which was a let down [first thing that comes to my mind when talking about dhaba :( ] the fish tikka was one of the best that I have had so far just the right ingredients and taste, The mutton rogan josh was good but nothing special about though the mutton pieces were really good and boneless. In desserts too we asked for 2 kulfis but they had just one and we went with it and the kulfi was also really good and well made I sulked as to why they didnt have any more of them. There are many varieties to this restaurant though I didnt try out much but definitely will again, And this restaurant doesnt go too well on your pocket for me I guess its a little over priced. Happy eating.

 Yesterday again we went to Honey Da Dhaba only because of their Tandoori Chicken. We ordered one of that with a plain naan, chicken korma and fresh lime soda. I was again disappointed coz they didn't have lassi and it was a Sunday and they didnt have any desserts either. I was am so dissapointed that I dont even feel like writing more about this place. This joint has always dissapointed me. Not fair..

Everything about this place is perfect !! But if you're looking for an economic place, it might be a little too harsh on your wallet.

However, it's worth it. The food quality is amazing. It's perfect for family time. And even if you're out with your buddies. Ambiance is great ! Lights are dim, but a little music could do wonders to the place.

Must try the kebabs. They do melt in your mouth ! 

Overall, amazing Punjabi restaurant.

I recently went there with two friends and the bill for 3 was Rs. 1200.

Honey Da Dhaba is our frequent visiting weneva we catch up a family dinner at kankurgachi area.  The ambience is a soothing one with the perfect lighting, bamboo furniture, etc.
Coming to the most important part- The Food ! Food is lipsmackingly good ...try out the kebabs, and go for any chicken gravy dish with butter naan or roti ! Veggies would love the Tawa Subz... u can even customize it according to your tastes and preferences.
Service is quick and commendable.. Price is suitable to the middle man pocket. End your meal with a Tuti-fruti for sure, if u r a dessert person ! :)

One of the best Punjabi restaurant in kolkata..when we went there it was evening so was empty, ambience is good and soothing, not like overcrowded dhaba..waiters were not much informative but since we visited many dhabas before so we didnot need many advice from those novice staffs.. we ordered Fish tikka, chicken pahari (hariyali) kabab, masala kulchas, mixed veg, chicken tikka masala.. food arrived after 20 mins.. all the items were excellent..kababs were delicious, kulchas were big, soft and full of masala stuffing.. price is very low in comparison with other classy punjabi restaurants..Had a very satisfactory experience and will visit there again in future.. They dont accept all kinds of debit/credit cards so its better to pay in cash..

If you  love kebabs and all the lovely N.Indian dishes,this is a must visit place  for you. The food here is excellent and cooked to perfection. The ambiance is really nice with a touch of Punjabi culture. The people serving wear traditional Punjabi dress which is unique......Serving is also good...........The main attractions are tadoori chicken ,chicken reshmi/butter masala, biriyani,fish kebabs and more...And for dessert the malai kulfi and Nalen gur'er Ice cream is a delight.Though the second one is my favourite.The truth is what ever they serve here is exccceeellent... So,is you are a foodie,you must visit this place and it won't disappoint....

I have always been a fan of this dhaba, because of their food quality and service. However, I have observed that are started to react strange if you are there for take away. They will always force you to pay by cash and if you offer card, they will say that card swapping machine is not working. So, I played a trick this time. I went straight inside and at the bill counter I asked if credit cards are now accepted and they said yes. And then I went outside and ordered my food at the take away counter. Later on when I offered my card, they told me to go inside. I went and they said machine is not working. I refused to accept and showed him the guy at counter who confirmed me the card payment is working. Then they said ok let us try and obviously it was a success. This is not a single incident with myself. It has happened and happening with many take away customers who wants to pay by cash.

Wrong food served on my table and as we started to leave the place in anger, nobody had the courtesy to approach us and apologize.

Food : Pls try Lassi, Dal tarka, Keema Matar, Any Dal, Rada C/M, Butter Nun...

Spicy food... so make sure you ask the crew to make it moderate according to your spice tolerance..

Easily one of the oldest dhabas in town, Honey da Dhaba is the place you can expect good quality food EVERY TIME; yes, they are truly that consistent in their culinary performance.... 

The ambiance, here, is something you'd have to be some really big shot, to dislike.... Also, the thing worth noting is that, there is a scope for improvement in the service... But at the end of the day, it all comes down to what's on the plate, and believe me, you won't be disappointed.... Items worth a mention are their Chicken Bharta, Keema Matar, Chicken Tandoori, Malai Kofta(veg), etc.

A well decorated DHABA with a torn sofa is not expected.

This place is having a good ambience  and i would suggest you to taste Chicken Butter Masala and the kebabs. My favourite dish here is the Dal Tarka and chicken tandoori. And in chinese,the crispy chicken is my favourite...Must visit there. I would rate 4.0 for HONEY DA DHABA....

The name says it all . But there's more to it than meets the eye. 

PRO's :
First of all ambience is quite good with the dimmed lights n plants here n there coupled with the typical mughlai furniture and art hanging about , really sets the mood.
Service is prompt with properly dressed waiters.
Food is quite delicious , be it the Tandoori kababs or the Biriyani or the Butter chicken or Rara punjabi 

CON's :

If you are looking for something economical, this isn't your cup of tea !
Rates are quite high and the portions quite measly. 
A person probably has to dish out somewhere upwards of 600/- to be properly content.


FINAL VERDICT : 

Authentic punjabi food that tastes simply amazing and if you don't mind dishing out extra bucks for questionable portions of food then this is the place for you. Total cost for two adult people can reach well above above 1000/- . So it's your call

Well It is the Dhaba and I am the Bee. Awesome Indian Food with very very fantastic ambience. Never go for Chinese food and Try different kababs and the Lassouni kabab is a must try though it is a bit costly but it worths it.
People who love rich must try Mutton rara panjabi
Fish Tikka kabab is the best in kolkata I must say and if You are bored with roomali or Tandoori roti or Nans, try the Masala Kulcha here.

Overall on festive day you may find a long queue but the place is totally worth of it and its quality is as good as it was 5years back

I first went to this place during Durga pujas, so had to wait a little.. But the wait was totally worth it.. The food is pretty good! One thing I'd suggest, Don't go for chinese or thai when you're here.. Play safe with Indian, coz they're very good at it! First thing first, the decor and ambiance is nice.. The badshahi furnitures and teaks gives you a genuine mughlai feel! We ordered chicken kebabs, mutton biryani and a side dish.. Each plate was authentic in taste, especially the kebabs.. They were so soft and juicy! The biryani was probably ever so slightly dry, but tasty.. All in all, keeping in mind the prices, its an amazing place to eat at.. 4 stars from me!

Try the dal makhni, malai kofta, mutton korma, mutton rogan josh, butter chicken here. The naan was very soft and fluffy too. A must have is the awesomest (I can't describe it any other way)sweet lime soda. The quantity of food is also great but the quality makes you crave for more and more. On rush days be prepared to wait it out. Well what better than saying "I love you Honey" ;)

I had chicken lasuni kabab,mutton biriyani and special lassi.Found the lasuni kabab very delicious.And the quality of biriyani was great.If you are planning to come here try special lassi,nothing can beat this.The atmosphere is calm and not full of crowd.The behavious of the weaters were very nice.Overall a quality restaurant where you can easily afford money.

awesome place to have reasonably good indian food. the quantity they serve for the price they charge is just wow !! the biriyanis and chicken malai tikka is a must try. and do not leave the place without having their special dessert of the day. the only con is that the serving time is a bit too long compared to other indian restaurants where you generally get your desired dish very quicly. otherwise a perfect place for a once in a month dine out with friends or family

Honey Da Dhaba is just Opposite to Maniktala ESI hospital.
I went there during puja so have to wait some time for seats.
Ordered Tandoori chicken, Chicken Bharta,Butter Naan and then chicken biriyani.
Tandoori Chicken was just awesome, one of the best in the city.
Chicken bharta was good. Butter Naan was also good.
Biriyani was very tasty, like it.
I am gonna taste some more dishes soon for sure.
Ambiance is Really nice, Decoration is good.
Staffs are okay, Service is late.
Price is high but quantity and quality of foods is good.
A perfect place to hangout with friends and family.
A Must Visit for all foodie.

Well, how should I review this place? It opened in front of me .. and we hav been here a million times. 
the food is great. especially the tandoori items. both veg and nonveg dishes are equally good. i have always had a good time here. 
The chicken bharta, rogan josh, keema are my favorites. even the biryanis and rotis are nice too. 
they have practically no dessert.. which is one negetaive. i wish they wud make some good Punjabi desserts too. 
this place remains a family favorite. 
i wish their home delivery was a little more efficient. every thing else is brilliant

very good atmosphere..well decorated, cosy, and the food quality is good. i ve not tried the nonveg though but the veg dishes are delicious. but the food prices are too much compared to others.. thats a minus point.

This place has the BEST TANDOORI CHICKEN in the city. Have visited this place many times with family & friends. Non veg is excellent but Veg is average. Service is OK but the staff should be more polite while talking to customers (only strong negative point). On Sundays and holidays there is huge rush in the evening.

They have almost doubled the prices from before. The price may look a bit high but the portions make up for it. Two people can easily share a biriyani & any side dish. The food & the ambiance is awesome.

Good food. The prices have doubled when you compare it to the menu here. Although food was more than good, good ambience (low light and chilled), not that professional waiters though. 

Ambience: 4/5
Food: 4.5/5
Value for money: 2.5/5
Professionalism: 3/5

One of my favourite eating joints. The mutton boti kebabs are lips smacking. Good punjabi food.
