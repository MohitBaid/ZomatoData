Well known sweet shop of baranagar located just opposite baranagar municipality. They sell savoury items like dahi bada and also offer packaging for it. Variety of sweets available. They participated in Cadbury competitions and since are making chocolate sweets too. Recommended.

Too much attitude of the service guys. Sweets are just ok. Not recommendable, there are better sweet shops available at the same price. Disappointed

Frankly speaking I have grown up with this shop as I live just 5 minutes walking distance from here. 
Quality of their sweet is really good. They are fresh. 
Some of their sondeshes, especially the one with rose petal, and the malai chomchom really can give tough competition to their famous and elite counterparts. 
Rosogollas are as usual good and they sell like hot cakes. 
Also people who work there, are really polite. 
They have included some snacks (fried and salty) in their menu. But they are simply ordinary. 
I would rate them 4, but now a days they have a tough competition, which has come in the name of Mahaprabhu Mishtanna Bhandar. 
I think Triptimahal should concentrate more on sweets than on snacks.
