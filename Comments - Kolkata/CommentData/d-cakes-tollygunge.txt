The most exotic and outstanding cakes I ever had. Truly one of the best in town. The cake was moist and soft. It melted away in the mouth. Strongly recommended. Thank you for making my special occasion even more special. Good job Dcakes.

Worst cake ever. If only I could give less than 1 stars.
The cake was not bad it was terrible my niece can make a cake better than their cake.
1) The delivery of the cake was 2 hours late 
2) The cake was terrible 
3) it was stale and we actually threw half of the cake

Excellent chocolate cake that fixed my chocolate craving. 
Eye appealing icing, perfect blend of chocolate cream and dark chocolate that tingled my taste buds. Soft and fluffy texture that melted in my mouth.  one of the best chocolate cake I had in Kolkata. 
Looking forward to have her highly recommended fresh seasonal fruit cakes.

Goodness of freshly baked cakes blended with the innovative ideas..Light foamy cream leaves you craving for more... The moist chocolate cake melts in my mouth, sticky with fudge frosting on my tongue. The bitter and simultaneously sweet smell of it puts me in a serene mind state. With the rich deep shades of brown on every delicious layer chocolate truffle cake acts as a slice of happiness on a white styrofoam plate.
