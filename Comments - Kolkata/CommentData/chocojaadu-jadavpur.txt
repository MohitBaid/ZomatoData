I ordered for some whisky chocolate from here via swiggy... the chocolates were excellent... nothing to say about service, staffs, deco n ambience... as I already mentioned it was a home delivery... pocket pinch was very friendly...

It's a dessert parlour. 
You will get various types of chocolate like milk, dark, wine, rum, whiskey and chocolate bouquet. 
Today i tried chocolate sandwich. 
It was delicious. 
Try once if you haven't tried it at all. 
I tried swiggy and delivery was quick. 
Sandwich cost me rs 50 only.
