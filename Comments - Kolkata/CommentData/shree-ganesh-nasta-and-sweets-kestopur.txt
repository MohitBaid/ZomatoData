This sweet confectionary is located at Kestopur.
Zero ambience.
Tried Samosa & Malpua. 
Tastewise average, nothing to rave about.
Pricing economical.

This sweet shop is located at Kestopur.

Shabby untidy ambience.

Quick service.

Tried Kachori-sabji , samosa and Misti doi. All were pretty average like regular shops, nothing special.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

Like most other early morning kachori shops - quick service, a couple of items available and average quality. Nothing worth mentioning. There are better kachori options available in nearby areas which look way more hygienic, taste better and are good value for money.

A small snacks shop specially for morning breakfast and evening snacks.

Located at Kestopur near the Milan bazar area.
I have tried their sabzi kachori and jalebi as well. Both are decent in taste.
Also there are Goja and Samosha options available as well as some sweets.An option for quick bite.

A busy place during the mornings of any day as it is very near to the main road..

Too many people always comes around..a lot of chaos..

You can come here in the morning but good thing f√≤od is fresh and you won't wait here for much time.
