This place is in sudder street and opposite Raj's Spanish café. It became our only haunt after Fairlawns stopped serving beer. It's an okay place and I hope it keeps serving affordable alcohol to people who haunt sudder street like we do

My friend and me use to come here almost every sunday... this place is located near new market area esplanade & the main problem about this pub is the noises... singers sing & dance here which is very irritating

I was in love with this pub because o the French hanging clock they ve got! Towards the lower end of Sudder Street this pub serves you really good. The service was remarkable. We had ordered dry chilli chicken as I don't prefer experimenting with food in a pub. They don't ve a smoking area so for smoking you gotta leave behind any o your belongings n smoke just outside the pub entrance.

Since fairlawn has closed down,we decided to go to Super Pub after lunch for a couple of drinks.
The staff really flattered me by asking for my I.D(crossed legal age 2 years back) and even though I insisted I was not about to consume alcohol,he persisted saying that under 21-s are not allowed inside.
That little episode done with,we had two beers and coke.
Service was quite prompt and the staff kept coming and pouring thums up for me into my glass with a smug face,which was quite funny.
Bill was 500/-
Will go again and post a detailed review.

Affordable and best bar in esplanade area to visit with friends or gf. Buy kingfisher or tuborg at 160 and carlsburg at 190. Side snacks range from 60 to 180 which are also good. Nothing to complain about. Smoking inside is prohibited.

Located near Blue Sky Cafe. Nice place to chill and drink. Staff are helpful and gentle.
Ambience is cool. 
My friend ordered a Tuborg Booster and I went for Mixed Fruit Shake.
Overall a good experience.

Though this place is called a Pub but it is more likely a sleezy Bar which serves cheap alcohol..This bar is actually located in Sudder street and they have a a.c. seating arrangement..though the place is not big,it is actually quite decent with comfortable seating arrangements,tv, and the place is more or less clean enough,though I would suggest to avoid the washroom here..Coming to the food this place is solely for tipplers enjoying their booze,booze is cheap,though don't expect any fancy brands or cocktails,just plain and simple whiskey,rum,vodka or beer..they do provide some generous portions of condiments with your drinks..
Coming to food,their food is just average,goes well with your drinks,spicy,tangy and loads of chillies,just the way you want it..we ordered:
Prawn Pakoda: It was nice..just small shrimps minced and spiced and fried..
Chicken Amritsari Kebab: Decent taste..though the chicken should have been a bit too soft..
Chicken Punjabi Masala: This was better..perfectly balanced flavours..a bit too oily though but tasted good with Tandoori Roti..
This place actually serves a loads of menus including Pizza and Pasta keeping in mind the crowds of Sudder Street,however honestly if someone craves for good food here I would recommend Blue Sky Cafe anyday..Overall our total cheque comes to Rs.1100/- for all the foods and 6 large pegs of RS..one positive is they don't charge any extra tax..
Food: 2.5/5
Pricing: 4.5/5
Service: 1.5/5
Ambiance: 1/5

My alternative destination if Fairlawn is quite crowded or I'm looking for a quiet place. This place is a stones throw away from Fairlawn. The drinks are priced reasonably and the food is good enough as well.

Not the ideal 'pub' per se.... But reasonably priced booze , lip smacking food and you got a keeper place to hangout.
The last order is at 11:00 but i am not sure how long they let you sit afterwards.

*** do try the tuborg booster. I dont think it is available elsewhere
