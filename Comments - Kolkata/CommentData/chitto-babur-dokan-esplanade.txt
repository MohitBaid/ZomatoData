Days would all be empty..One thing you can be sure of
I'll never ask for more than your love
Nothing's gonna to change my love for you
You already know by now how much I love you

Heavily overpriced -food wasn't of very good quality , a combo of chicken stew and toast costed around 78 bucks . Food didn't taste good as well. Khichudi for 30 bucks was kinda pocket friendly. Atlast , i would suggest not to vusit this shop , there is a restaurant named chittoda's suruchee just a few steps ahead , do visit there for a plate of chicken bharta and romali roti.

Delicious food, no frills place. We tried the legendary chicken Stu with butter toast, ghughni and fish fry. Everything tasted fantastic and very very fresh. The only thing that might bother you are the flies and overall dirty road where you'll have to sit on a bench and eat. But if you can get past those, definitely worth trying the finger licking good dishes!

The piping hot chicken stew along with the complimentary toasts, the delicious fish fry, prompt service and friendly nature of the staffs, and the pocket friendly price tag of such mouth watering food make up for the absence of proper seating arrangement and good ambience.
This place is one of those hidden gems of our city known for their pure bliss of delicacies.

Good Stews..
Mutton or Chicken.....Priced reasonably....Not as cheap as it should be especially being in Dacres Lane
...A piece of bread lightly toasted 'Shyaka' as we Bengalis say...While watchong a match at nearby Eden this place is a good option for a hearty yet light lunch.

This is an iconic eatery set up by chittoda now being run by his nephew. Their chicken stew is their signature dish. It is light and mildly spiced.. Comes with a potato and papaya and toasts.. I also had their special fish fry.. Which was ok.. This outlet is at the end of the food street of kolkata.. Dacres lane. No ambiance as such.. But gets quite crowded during lunch hour.. It is a must visit place in kol.

Chitto Babur Dokan has a cult following with people who work in and around Esplanade. Their stews are hugely popular and available in both chicken and mutton variants though I personally prefer the mutton. The meat is well cooked and soft and the gravy flavourful. I also enjoy their Fish Fry and Toast. An absolute no frills place but well worth a visit for the "experience" it offers.

Tcked away inside a bylane around Esplanade,  Dacre's Lane, a 2 min walk from Esplanade is the home to the now legendary Chitto Da's Suruchee Restaurant.

This shop has been around for more than 70 years and there is always a mad rush going on. You need to hustle a bit for a seat, but since when has that been a problem for the petuk Bangali?

What was ordered :
(1) Diamond Fish Fry. A thick, steaming hot crusted fillet of Kolkata Bhetki fried to perfection, at par with some of Kolkata's best.

(2) Chicken Stew with 2 pcs of complimentary buttered toast. The butter they put in both the toast and chicken stew is gargantuan, and certainly not for the cholesterol conscious.

(3)Fish Butter Masala and Mutton Kasha. Each has 3 pcs. The gravy of the former is absolutely mind-blowing, and the Mutton Kasha is delicious as well. Pair it with Rumali Rotis and you're good to go.

All these at an extremely decent pricing of 700/- INR - it is well worth a visit for Kolkata citizens.

This is a gem in dacre's lane. Many people know that already. For those who don't know... it's for them to know that this old place serves cheapest foods in the best quantity n good quality I should say. Unfortunately I couldn't try all they had to offer. Tried their chicken cutlet n fried rice meal. I couldn't believe initially that so much could be given in 60+120 bucks. Tasted awesome too.:) Will visit this nostalgia struck old place whenever I stroll down the streets of esplanade!!

This small eatery on Dacres Lane operating for decades is a favourite with office-going Babus (White collar staff) in the Dalhousie area. It is a legendary eatery on the city's food map. The eatery has no formal name and hence is referred by the name of its founder Chitta as Chittababur Dokan (Chittababu's Shop in English).

Since the core of its customers is officegoers from Dalhousie area who come for their evening bites after work, the menu is a mix of healthy food and traditional snacks. Its staple menu is basically stew (Chicken, mutton and vegetable), ghughni (A preparation with peas, similar to chana masala), liver curry, fish fry, fish finger, chicken pakora and its USP- butter toast. The menu is very reasonably priced keeping in mind middle class affordability.

Chittababu is no more. His nephew Sandip Roy is in charge now.

I sincerely believe few places on the streets of Kolkata make toasts as good as Chittababu‚Äôs Shop. Crisp and brown at places, with a thin streak of just absorbed butter in the middle and a dash of salt ‚Äòn‚Äô pepper sprinkled over. Umm‚Ä¶.pure bliss!

Apart from toasts, the ghughni made at this place is extremely popular and markedly different from the regular stuff you get outside home. The ghughni is darker, thicker and taken with two toasts can make you full. 

Their milk tea also stands out and, needless to say, is preferred by many to pair with toast or round off their evening snacking. It's 'office. para' style- comes with a stronger brew.

There are other pop picks like fish fry, fish roll and fish pakora (not available always) and all of them are my favourites. They have also been serving chilli chicken and maybe one or two odd Chinese dishes for some years but Chinese is definitely not their forte and doesn‚Äôt reflect their culinary expertise. I also like their chicken pakora. A small pakora with juicy chicken inside, a wee bit sweeter than regular chicken pakoras (because of the filling) makes it outstanding.

My dad referred me to this place, a favourite with him when he would go to office. I am grateful to him for this.

I came to know about this place from my dad. He was a regular here, in his office days. I reached Dacres Lane assuming I would walk into a small eatery. However on reaching there I realized there was no eatery. A hole in the wall was dishing out food to people standing in the lane and also to people sitting along the wooden benches placed on the corner of the lane. The lane was busy and it had two or three wheeler traffic in it, including an occasional car. People (mostly office goers come here for lunch) were standing in groups, holding the food with one hand and eating with the other. The eatery had waiters who were walking around in the lane, collecting orders and delivering them. They also had guys constantly sweeping the road for keeping the eating area clean.

The current owner, a young guy in his twenties, is the nephew of the person who started this shop ‚Äì Chitto Babu. He was amused seeing me as he took few seconds to understand I was new. So I asked for suggestion and he gave some. Later I had a little chat about the shop. There was obviously no menu card. The food they serve is generally good considering the price tag. But forget about the hygiene, this place hasn't any.¬†

Now coming to the food, I ordered a long list of items as I was hungry after a busy day's work. First I ordered Fish Fry. It had crisp outer cover, flaky juicy fish in the middle. Good thickness of fish. A masala layer between the outer crumb layer and the fish within. Very good taste and great texture. Flavours of fish was enjoyable. Next I took fish roll (recommended by that jolly fellow). Fish roll had a huge chunk of mashed fish and masala in the center. It was then covered by a layer of fish and then finally the bread crumb layer on the outside. Didn't like it though. Next what I ordered, is my dad's recommendation. It's chicken stew. And it was a revelation I must say. I couldn't believe I was having it on the streets of Kolkata. It looked bland, plain. It had a large thick piece of papaya in it and a large carrot in it as well. The papaya and the carrot were soft enough to be bitten and they retained their flavour. The chicken pieces were excellent. Super soft and juicy. They had specs of fat on them. What more can you expect? Mutton stew was on exactly the same lines. Papaya, carrot etc were there as well. The mutton pieces were very tender and juicy (certainly not expecting to be this good from a place like this). The best thing that goes with stew is a bread toast. Well here you won't be getting a perfectly toasted bread, but, a more "burnt" version. Last, I wanted to bite in something deep fried. So I took Chicken pakora. It was ordinary, nothing special about it. It was batter fried chicken. Crispy on the outside, besan and small chicken pieces inside. It had few strands of chilly. It had a fiery taste.

By this time you must have got an idea how hungry I was! And since the price was dirt cheap, I didn't mind stuffing my belly with all I could. The overall feeling of Chitto Babu's establishment wasn't bad. I would certainly visit here again, if I am in it's vicinity (and if my pockets become shallow).

If you love street food you will love this joint. An extremely old establishment serving the famous Calcutta fast foods. 

The eatery is located at a busy road well known for street foods in Calcutta. Deckers lane. The shop is extremely old. It has a huge clientele. Largely crowdy. So if you are expecting a posh sophisticated eatery, then it is not. Couple of benches in front of the open shop and that's it. However the food is absolutely charm.

I came to know about this old Calcutta street food joint from some of my colleagues. The location was a shock for me. But the food overwhelmed me. In fact the shop owner was enjoying himself seeing my expression. I can tell. 

You should / must try the chicken kobiraji / chicken pokora / egg devil. I wanted to try that chicken stew and fish roll. Looked so yum. Will have to get back sone other day to sample them. Note the tea was so good.

The taste  was delicious and also very cheap.
You can also try chicken pakora, Fish Kabiraji with Darjiling tea.

After watching celebrity chef Ranveer Brar trying the food at this stall.. Me and my frnd decided to do the same.. Ordered their famous chicken stew.,fish fry, chicken Pakora and chicken cutlet. The chicken stew was worth visiting this place.. It was light n sweet with the carrot n beans.. The chicken leg was moist and soft n tender. It was delicious... The fish fry was also really good.. Crisp on the outside n perfectly cooked on the inside.. Chicken Pakora was OK.. Chicken cutlet was also ok.. It was lightly spiced n tasted good.. The staff were quick n they approach their customers n help them out.. It's helpful for newbies like us.. All in all it was a good experience except the heat n the surroundings.. For those who can't sit on the benches there is chitto da's suruchee restaurant with the same menu.. Will visit this one too Syed Sameen Wazi

Located in our very own 'food street': Dacres lane, Chitto Babur dokan was in my wishlist for a very long time. So I decided to have a try on a rainy evening. Tasted their chicken pakora, I've tried chicken pakora in many places, but it was quite different. Completely boneless, coated with crunchy layer, deep fried, served with salad and mustard sauce, it was delicious. When it's street food you have to ignore the ambiance, in a crowded narrow lane, couple of benches and lots of office returned hungry souls were galloping the food. Have heard about their Chicken Stew with bread, surely will give it a try. Chicken Korma, Chicken Cutlet, Fish Fingers, Fish Fry were also there, on my next visit, these are must try. The behavior of the owner was also impressive. Anyone, who's willing to explore the street food of Kolkata must give it a try.
                    

Well, this is an edit after few months, we tried Veg stew with Liver & Bread, cheap and yummy!

It is situated at Dacres Lane which is just 5mins walking distance from Esplanade metro station.

It is famous for #Chicken_stew & it's really good at the heart of the city

Famous on the ring is #tea #chicken_stew with #toased_bread or you can take the "Bong Beauty" #khichdi #beguni #fried_papad

As per the ambiance it is not for that many times at rush hours you have to take your food by standing there. But if ambiance, hygienic food, are not a big deal for you then you should visit once the Dacres Lane which is a lane with plenty of food stores & best food in budget

It's a difficult task to satiate the office end hunger of swarming health conscious but tight budgeted population of Dalhousie Square everyday !! Even some of the celebrated food chains faltered in this arena. But the traditional charm and simplicity of this roadside stall has been taming the hunger of thousands of homebound population from time immemorial. Located in the narrow lane of Deccars Lane it chiefly serves toasts and poach for breakfast. In the evening the Chicken Stew is a champion of this place as it is not at all bland and comes up with right amount of salt and pepper. Moreover, the Fish fry and Fish Kabiraji are also delectable along with some variants of chops. Some people also goes for Bread and Ghugni. The tea is served in cup and plate which is damn refreshing.

If you are a passionate foodie to whom the ambience is of least botheration compared to good food, then you must surely peep in to this place to experience the nostalgic food cravings of good, old Calcutta....

I first went there when i was asked by a guest staying at the oberoi's willing to eat the their fish fry. I was amazed by this request. The place lived up to the expectation and delivered some lip-smacking fish frys. Recently was there for breakfast. Tried the the butter toast with a dash of pepper on it. Boiled eggs and omelettes were the other 2 items i ordered. All of them were really good. The pricing is very cheap here.
To conclude this is a gem for the office goers working around it. Keep it up team chitto babur dokan.

Chitto Babur Dokan is located at Dacres Lane, Esplanade . It is a small shop for quality quick bites at an affordable price , mostly crowded by office goers.

Zero ambience but with quick service.

Tried ghoogni - pauruti ( bread ) &  chicken pakora. Both tasted realy well and was light too. 

A very nice place to have quick bites in which both quality & quantity of food  is good.

This place is a heritage in terms of quick bites for office goers in Kolkata 'dharamtall', no question of ambiance, its straight street food, have it on the street amidst people passing by. We had ordered the chicken and mutton stew. I went to this place after a gap of couple of years. The stew doesn't taste the same anymore. It seems it has become more stomach friendly than ever. In Kolkata if the mutton is not soft and succulent, then the quality is Bad. Here the case was same for both the meet, chicken & mutton both were chewy and tasteless. Was not expecting spiced up cuisine while having a 'stew'.

Went there on 31st's eve as other so-called mainstream restaurants were overcrowded. This eatery has maintained its legacy in street food since a long time.¬†
Obviously we tasted the famous chicken stew with toast. If you are a regular goer in dalhousie opt this item as it's absolutely harmless, healthy food with papaya, carrot and one piece of chicken.¬†
Next we tasted fish fry. it was satisfactory.
We also packed baked fish, egg devil and chicken sizzling as per their recommendation and they turned out good but not divine.
Don't forget to have a cup of tea. they still serve tea in white ceramic cup and plate.
Overall obviously a must go place if you a foodie in kolkata.

This place! Carved onto my heart forever. Cheapest rates, and super awesome quality! Been here many times, and I'll be going here many times ahead in the future too. The famous Bengali combo of ghoogni and paoruti (bread), just amazing! The fish fries, fish kabirajis, and even chicken pakora. I've tried everything they serve. And I really recommend this place to everyone. Ambiance isn't that good, but I can definitely say that this place serves great food! Keep up the good work.

This is a gem in dacre's lane. Many people know that already. For those who don't know... it's for them to know that this old place serves cheapest foods in the best quantity n good quality I should say. Unfortunately I couldn't try all they had to offer. Tried their chicken cutlet n fried rice meal. I couldn't believe initially that so much could be given in 60+120 bucks. Tasted awesome too.:) Will visit this nostalgia struck old place whenever I stroll down the streets of esplanade!!

This small eatery on Dacres Lane operating for decades is a favourite with office-going Babus (White collar staff) in the Dalhousie area. It is a legendary eatery on the city's food map. The eatery has no formal name and hence is referred by the name of its founder Chitta as Chittababur Dokan (Chittababu's Shop in English).

Since the core of its customers is officegoers from Dalhousie area who come for their evening bites after work, the menu is a mix of healthy food and traditional snacks. Its staple menu is basically stew (Chicken, mutton and vegetable), ghughni (A preparation with peas, similar to chana masala), liver curry, fish fry, fish finger, chicken pakora and its USP- butter toast. The menu is very reasonably priced keeping in mind middle class affordability.

Chittababu is no more. His nephew Sandip Roy is in charge now.

I sincerely believe few places on the streets of Kolkata make toasts as good as Chittababu‚Äôs Shop. Crisp and brown at places, with a thin streak of just absorbed butter in the middle and a dash of salt ‚Äòn‚Äô pepper sprinkled over. Umm‚Ä¶.pure bliss!

Apart from toasts, the ghughni made at this place is extremely popular and markedly different from the regular stuff you get outside home. The ghughni is darker, thicker and taken with two toasts can make you full. 

Their milk tea also stands out and, needless to say, is preferred by many to pair with toast or round off their evening snacking. It's 'office. para' style- comes with a stronger brew.

There are other pop picks like fish fry, fish roll and fish pakora (not available always) and all of them are my favourites. They have also been serving chilli chicken and maybe one or two odd Chinese dishes for some years but Chinese is definitely not their forte and doesn‚Äôt reflect their culinary expertise. I also like their chicken pakora. A small pakora with juicy chicken inside, a wee bit sweeter than regular chicken pakoras (because of the filling) makes it outstanding.

My dad referred me to this place, a favourite with him when he would go to office. I am grateful to him for this.

I came to know about this place from my dad. He was a regular here, in his office days. I reached Dacres Lane assuming I would walk into a small eatery. However on reaching there I realized there was no eatery. A hole in the wall was dishing out food to people standing in the lane and also to people sitting along the wooden benches placed on the corner of the lane. The lane was busy and it had two or three wheeler traffic in it, including an occasional car. People (mostly office goers come here for lunch) were standing in groups, holding the food with one hand and eating with the other. The eatery had waiters who were walking around in the lane, collecting orders and delivering them. They also had guys constantly sweeping the road for keeping the eating area clean.

The current owner, a young guy in his twenties, is the nephew of the person who started this shop ‚Äì Chitto Babu. He was amused seeing me as he took few seconds to understand I was new. So I asked for suggestion and he gave some. Later I had a little chat about the shop. There was obviously no menu card. The food they serve is generally good considering the price tag. But forget about the hygiene, this place hasn't any.¬†

Now coming to the food, I ordered a long list of items as I was hungry after a busy day's work. First I ordered Fish Fry. It had crisp outer cover, flaky juicy fish in the middle. Good thickness of fish. A masala layer between the outer crumb layer and the fish within. Very good taste and great texture. Flavours of fish was enjoyable. Next I took fish roll (recommended by that jolly fellow). Fish roll had a huge chunk of mashed fish and masala in the center. It was then covered by a layer of fish and then finally the bread crumb layer on the outside. Didn't like it though. Next what I ordered, is my dad's recommendation. It's chicken stew. And it was a revelation I must say. I couldn't believe I was having it on the streets of Kolkata. It looked bland, plain. It had a large thick piece of papaya in it and a large carrot in it as well. The papaya and the carrot were soft enough to be bitten and they retained their flavour. The chicken pieces were excellent. Super soft and juicy. They had specs of fat on them. What more can you expect? Mutton stew was on exactly the same lines. Papaya, carrot etc were there as well. The mutton pieces were very tender and juicy (certainly not expecting to be this good from a place like this). The best thing that goes with stew is a bread toast. Well here you won't be getting a perfectly toasted bread, but, a more "burnt" version. Last, I wanted to bite in something deep fried. So I took Chicken pakora. It was ordinary, nothing special about it. It was batter fried chicken. Crispy on the outside, besan and small chicken pieces inside. It had few strands of chilly. It had a fiery taste.

By this time you must have got an idea how hungry I was! And since the price was dirt cheap, I didn't mind stuffing my belly with all I could. The overall feeling of Chitto Babu's establishment wasn't bad. I would certainly visit here again, if I am in it's vicinity (and if my pockets become shallow).

If you love street food you will love this joint. An extremely old establishment serving the famous Calcutta fast foods. 

The eatery is located at a busy road well known for street foods in Calcutta. Deckers lane. The shop is extremely old. It has a huge clientele. Largely crowdy. So if you are expecting a posh sophisticated eatery, then it is not. Couple of benches in front of the open shop and that's it. However the food is absolutely charm.

I came to know about this old Calcutta street food joint from some of my colleagues. The location was a shock for me. But the food overwhelmed me. In fact the shop owner was enjoying himself seeing my expression. I can tell. 

You should / must try the chicken kobiraji / chicken pokora / egg devil. I wanted to try that chicken stew and fish roll. Looked so yum. Will have to get back sone other day to sample them. Note the tea was so good.

The chicken stew was worth visiting this place.. It was light n sweet with the carrot n beans.. The chicken leg was moist and soft n tender. It was delicious... The fish fry was also really good.. Crisp on the outside n perfectly cooked on the inside.. Chicken Pakora was OK.. Chicken cutlet was also ok.. It was lightly spiced n tasted good.. The staff were quick n they approach their customers n help them out.. It's helpful for newbies like us.. All in all it was a good experience except the heat n the surroundings.. For those who can't sit on the benches there is chitto da's suruchee restaurant with the same menu.. Will visit this one too Syed Sameen Wazi

Located in our very own 'food street': Dacres lane, Chitto Babur dokan was in my wishlist for a very long time. So I decided to have a try on a rainy evening. Tasted their chicken pakora, I've tried chicken pakora in many places, but it was quite different. Completely boneless, coated with crunchy layer, deep fried, served with salad and mustard sauce, it was delicious. When it's street food you have to ignore the ambiance, in a crowded narrow lane, couple of benches and lots of office returned hungry souls were galloping the food. Have heard about their Chicken Stew with bread, surely will give it a try. Chicken Korma, Chicken Cutlet, Fish Fingers, Fish Fry were also there, on my next visit, these are must try. The behavior of the owner was also impressive. Anyone, who's willing to explore the street food of Kolkata must give it a try.

It is situated at Dacres Lane which is just 5mins walking distance from Esplanade metro station.

It is famous for #Chicken_stew & it's really good at the heart of the city

Famous on the ring is #tea #chicken_stew with #toased_bread or you can take the "Bong Beauty" #khichdi #beguni #fried_papad

As per the ambiance it is not for that many times at rush hours you have to take your food by standing there. But if ambiance, hygienic food, are not a big deal for you then you should visit once the Dacres Lane which is a lane with plenty of food stores & best food in budget

Intro : Known for its chicken stew and bread toast - This is a very old street side joint at decker' s lane 

Food : Unfortunately the chicken stew wasn't ready yet - I went around 10 in the morning.
Had bread and ghugni - Ghugni was average nothing great ,hence rating the place 3.5 

Overall - Will definitely come back for the chicken stew and update the review 3.5/6

Old Kolkata street food. The place is very old but don't go with the look. Old is GOLD. The chicken stew with toast bread topped with sugar is a delicacy which many people don't know about. Anyone looking for street food this place is a must try. Customers are usually office goers but why miss out on tasty food. It's in a lane near kc Das sweets and shouldn't be very hard to find. Bon appetite...üòÄ

Located at James Hickey Sarani (Dacres Lane). A food junction offering delicious dishes at low prices. I ordered Ghugni Bread toast which cost ‚Çπ17 only. It was just delicious & quantity was also good. Ans then tried Chicken Pakoda  which was also very tasty. But the Fish Kabiraji was average. Must visit for all food lovers.

It is situated at Dacres Lane which is just 5mins walking distance from Esplanade metro station.

It is famous for #Chicken_stew & it's really good at the heart of the city

Famous on the ring is #tea #chicken_stew with #toased_bread or you can take the "Bong Beauty" #khichdi #beguni #fried_papad

As per the ambiance it is not for that many times at rush hours you have to take your food by standing there. But if ambiance, hygienic food, are not a big deal for you then you should visit once the Dacres Lane which is a lane with plenty of food stores & best food in budget

Intro : Known for its chicken stew and bread toast - This is a very old street side joint at decker' s lane 

Food : Unfortunately the chicken stew wasn't ready yet - I went around 10 in the morning.
Had bread and ghugni - Ghugni was average nothing great ,hence rating the place 3.5 

Overall - Will definitely come back for the chicken stew and update the review 3.5/6

It's a difficult task to satiate the office end hunger of swarming health conscious but tight budgeted population of Dalhousie Square everyday !! Even some of the celebrated food chains faltered in this arena. But the traditional charm and simplicity of this roadside stall has been taming the hunger of thousands of homebound population from time immemorial. Located in the narrow lane of Deccars Lane it chiefly serves toasts and poach for breakfast. In the evening the Chicken Stew is a champion of this place as it is not at all bland and comes up with right amount of salt and pepper. Moreover, the Fish fry and Fish Kabiraji are also delectable along with some variants of chops. Some people also goes for Bread and Ghugni. The tea is served in cup and plate which is damn refreshing.

If you are a passionate foodie to whom the ambience is of least botheration compared to good food, then you must surely peep in to this place to experience the nostalgic food cravings of good, old Calcutta....

It‚Äôs an old street side eatery in Decars Lane, near esplanade. A hidden gem you can say. The place is famous for its‚Äô mouth-watering snacks like fish fry, fish roll, fish kabiraji etc. The place don‚Äôt have any proper seating arrangements there are some chairs outside where you can seat simply enjoy your foods. You will find plenty street food shops around but this place always remains crowded, people love to eat here for the quality they offer and also for the friendly behaviour of the owner. Tea, bread, ghugni, chicken stew are also available and quite delicious. Perfect place for quick bite, office lunch or evening snacks. Very much pocket friendly.

I first went there when i was asked by a guest staying at the oberoi's willing to eat the their fish fry. I was amazed by this request. The place lived up to the expectation and delivered some lip-smacking fish frys. Recently was there for breakfast. Tried the the butter toast with a dash of pepper on it. Boiled eggs and omelettes were the other 2 items i ordered. All of them were really good. The pricing is very cheap here.
To conclude this is a gem for the office goers working around it. Keep it up team chitto babur dokan.

One of the hidden Gems of the city serving Tea, Bread toast, Egg toast from years. Chitto Babur Dokan is located in Deckers Lane near Esplanade Tram Depot. I visited here for a a morning breakfast. Had a cup of Tea and Bread butter toast on it. The bread butter toast was heavenly. Very good in taste at such a low price. Also tea was fantastic. If you are nearby, a try here is recommended.

Chitto Babur Dokan is located at Dacres Lane, Esplanade . It is a small shop for quality quick bites at an affordable price , mostly crowded by office goers.

Zero ambience but with quick service.

Tried ghoogni - pauruti ( bread ) &  chicken pakora. Both tasted realy well and was light too. 

A very nice place to have quick bites in which both quality & quantity of food  is good.

This place is a heritage in terms of quick bites for office goers in Kolkata 'dharamtall', no question of ambiance, its straight street food, have it on the street amidst people passing by. We had ordered the chicken and mutton stew. I went to this place after a gap of couple of years. The stew doesn't taste the same anymore. It seems it has become more stomach friendly than ever. In Kolkata if the mutton is not soft and succulent, then the quality is Bad. Here the case was same for both the meet, chicken & mutton both were chewy and tasteless. Was not expecting spiced up cuisine while having a 'stew'.

Went there on 31st's eve as other so-called mainstream restaurants were overcrowded. This eatery has maintained its legacy in street food since a long time.¬†
Obviously we tasted the famous chicken stew with toast. If you are a regular goer in dalhousie opt this item as it's absolutely harmless, healthy food with papaya, carrot and one piece of chicken.¬†
Next we tasted fish fry. it was satisfactory.
We also packed baked fish, egg devil and chicken sizzling as per their recommendation and they turned out good but not divine.
Don't forget to have a cup of tea. they still serve tea in white ceramic cup and plate.
Overall obviously a must go place if you a foodie in kolkata.

This place! Carved onto my heart forever. Cheapest rates, and super awesome quality! Been here many times, and I'll be going here many times ahead in the future too. The famous Bengali combo of ghoogni and paoruti (bread), just amazing! The fish fries, fish kabirajis, and even chicken pakora. I've tried everything they serve. And I really recommend this place to everyone. Ambiance isn't that good, but I can definitely say that this place serves great food! Keep up the good work.

Had heard a lot about this famous food joint of kolkata in dacres Lane and also heard about their famous stew.
So today I went there to have chicken stew with bread and chicken pakora followed by a cup of tea. Firstly the food wasn't so great as I thought it would be and because the restaurant is in the road side so a good ambiance can't be expected but which we can expect is the cleanliness but sadly it was also missed.

An age old place for snack and tiffin at budget cost. The good there is of average quality now and the tea is even worse. Service is quick no doubt. You should visit if you want to taste some Kolkata Nostalgia, if you want to take some snap of "Office Parar Babu" sipping tea from white China. My rating for Chitto Da is less for food or service and more for being a heritage. :)

Before starting with my review I would like to thank my father for letting me know about this place that is age old and famous for stew. 

I have been waiting for a long time to get a chance to visit the place and finally today was the long awaited day. I tracked this place via google map and this place is located in James Hickey Sarani popularly known as Dacre's Lane. The lane starts with varities of food stalls preparing hot and tasty foods. 

So we finally reached here and inquired about what was available. We didn't get any menu card instead there was a person who was telking what was in the menu. And after hearing all the items we ended up ordering Chicken Stew. Now this stew is something that I have tasted for the first time. We were served almost in no time although the place seemed crowded. The place seemed quite popular among office goers. 

We were served in large sized steel hotel thalis which had a porcelain plateful of the Chicken Stew and two pieces of toasted bread. The stew looked pale yellow. It had vegetables like papaya, carrot, beans. The piece of chicken was of a generous portion not too bid but apt. It was garnished with sprinkles of black pepper powder. What I felt was that the juice of the stew tastes best with the bread. If you take simple spoonful of the stew you might not find it that tasty. Atleast that's what I felt. But it was good anyway. From the taste I was sure that even if I take few more bowls of stew I won't face any tummy complaints because it was made in such a way. Absolutely okay for health. And then was that piece of chicken. I can't recall when was the last time I had such tender properly cooked tasty chicken. It was simply awesome. The juice inside was simply marvellous. I enjoyed it thouroughly. 

The story doesn't end here. I ended up ordering a plate of ghugni which I felt I must try atleast once. The amount was generous from the view point of the price. It was as well garnished with cucumber slices and black pepper powder. Taste was really good but only a thing that I found it a bit sweet, but overall it was nice. 

So that was my experience at Chitto Babur Dokan. I wish to visit someday later. Happy eating!
