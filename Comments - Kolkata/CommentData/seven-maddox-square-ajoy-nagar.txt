Very poor service, water is not clean so please  order bottled water only.  Food is OK.  Rates are reasonable and ambience is good,  need to improve a lot and take care of water.

My experience here was rather mixed. I had ordered Chicken Hakka Noodles, Chicken Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken. The quality of food was really good, as were the quantities. However, the place isn't the most hygienic. The plates needed better cleaning. As I feasted on the food, many mosquitoes feasted on me, and some rather impolite flies tried to take a bite from my lunch without my permission.

Nice place. Good cuisine. Good for a cosy dinner with friends and family. Definitely will like to go again. A sudden discovery which turned out to be pretty nice.

Poor service and poor quality of food. Did not have much to offer though the menu carries a long list, nothing was available for breakfast except luchi aloo dum and toast. In other words the menu card is there only to be read while staff decides what customer will eat...

Half the things in the menu are not available. Over priced and not up to the mark at all. They donot have proper serving etiquette and donot heed to suggestions. The menu is huge but the food available sucks.

I guess my fellow critics have mentioned lots of negative praises... i too have some.

This place is an absolute waste of ur money and time... food quality is bad.
These guys are not even aware of what to serve in which crockery... we had ordered 2/4 chicken soup and we were served in ice cream bowl.
The chicken tasted stale, on complaining about the food they do not heed to ur suggestions... i missed on taking pics of their food.
One word to describe - HORRENDOUS.

Over Rated and Costly . Lesser Quantity .Oil used in food in bad. Ambience pathetic. Waiting time is huge because the place is really small and cramped. If you like cramped place and not so clean place , this will be good for .
Not good for decent family gathering.
But may be Kolkata standard is like that and being an outsider, i might not have kept up with the pace.
Sweet dish is always in short supply.
Service is also not upto the mark and you have to wait for long for service in a cramped place.
Waiting time is huge and you have to stand outside on the road so be careful.
