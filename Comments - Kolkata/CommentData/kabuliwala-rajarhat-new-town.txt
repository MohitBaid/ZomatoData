Nothing beats the experience of relishing lip-smacking Biriyani at home in chilly winter nights. Kabuliwala, undoubtedly, provides the best biriyani in town. The flavours and spice is absolutely on point and doesn't even leave the greasy feeling in your mouth. Not just the food, but also their packaging is top notch!

I ordered for Shahi Murg Biriyani and some Firni for dessert. We were also given some complimentary ghol. The biriyani was mind-blowing and it was the best biriyani I've ever had. Also the Firni tasted delicious and was the perfect ending for a sumptuous meal.

Kabuliwala is definitely the best delivery option if you're craving for some delicious Mughlai dishes and I was awestruck with the quality and the quantity of food they provide. Their packaging is absolutely commendable and no matter how cold it was outside they made sure the food remained hot. Had a wonderful experience!

Highly recommended! Would love to order again soon.

Kabuliwala,Rajarhat(Home Delivery only)
Was in my wishlist for long time at last managed to order from here ..
I was craving for kebabs in this chilly winter evening so ordered:

*Mumtaz Tangdi
*Murg Sugandhi
*Murg Gulabo
                                      The delivery was on time.I am impressed with their packing skills ♥
I'm ready to give 10/10 for the packaging :) and the kebabs were hot enough to serve us. All the kebabs tasted good and had different flavors like murg gulabo had mild gulab ka flavor and murg sugandhi tasted wow☺ and mumtaz tangdi had good succulent pieces of chicken tangdi ☺
And I'm looking forward to order biryani and firni :)
Love to recommend to all.

Having heard so much of Kabuliwala biryani from my friends in the corporate sectors of rajarhat/sector 5, I was quite eager to try their biryani. We ordered for murgh biryani and firni from this place
First I would like to start with their packaging. The biryani came in an earthen pot well packed and warm (as it had arrived a few minutes late than we had expected). The packaging is important because for home deliveries, specially biryani, its imperative that the food is kept warm and soft. Coming to the food it was delectable. The aroma was amazing, the food was light. It had big chicken pieces and the quantity of the food is overwhelming.
The firni was also very delicious.
I would highly recommend this place

A good place if someone is a mughlai food lover.. Prices are a bit more than the present market competitors but stills it's fine when we get that clay made handi with their biriyani..love their simple garnishing but can improve their taste to a better one..would love to try again..!

It was a very pathetic experience for me with Kabuliwala from Rajarhat branch. Few days back I ordered biriyani which was really delicious. With that experience I had ordered for foods like biriyani, chicken bharta with kulcha and salad when I had 10 12 friends at my place. Experience was really insulting. None of the food was eatable. I have to throw all the items and ordered from some where else. Most negative part of this experience is they will not convey when they are out of stock and some how they will try to finish last piece of their food. 
In one word experience is insulting and pathetic.

This brand has been around for quite some time now and has made a great name for itself in a relatively shorter period of time compared to other reputed biryani giants.Calcutta-style biryani is an emotion and what Kabuliwala has managed to do is to take the best parts of it(the boiled egg and the potato of course) and add it's own novel touch in the form of an accompanying burhani drink, bamboo plates and top-notch packaging.

I ordered their SHAHI GOSHT BIRYANI(4/5) for my family consisting of 4 people.

✔Ample quantity.Although the menu card claims that the biryani was meant for 3 people,it was more than enough for 4 moderate-eating adults.

✔There were 6 huge,solid pieces of meat in what would be 3 plates of biryani in other restaraunts.When it comes to the amount of meat,Kabuliwala tops in the generosity quotient.

✔The most striking feature was that the biryani was incredibly light, both in terms of grease and spices.It doesn't weigh you down after you're done with the meal.

✔It had long, independant, flavourful grains of rice,3 melt-in-the-mouth pieces of potatoes,3 boiled eggs and the meat was incredibly tender.

The FIRNI(4/5) was very creamy and wasn't overwhelmingly sweet.

I placed the order at 5.20 pm and they promised that I would get my order at 7.30 pm.I received the order at 7.15 pm sharp.

At 1200 bucks for a dinner for 4,the prices are pretty reasonable.

Overall,I would put Kabuliwala right up there in the top 2, along with Arsalan of course.💖

The best thing I like about Kabuliwala Biryani is that it is pretty light on the stomach and does not make you feel bloated or have uncomfortable burps. The generous portions and the presentation are next - the Chicken Biryani for 2 people can be shared at ease by 3 people since it contains 4 pieces of chicken(2 in a packet each), and the the quantity of rice is also sufficient. With complementary 'chaach', tablet tissues, plates, tissues, and even toothpicks, all your pre and post-dinner needs are taken care of. Must say, very thoughtful planning. They are also extremely punctual and accept both cards and cash as payment methods.

Had been on my bucket list for a long time..couldn't have been a better way to start the year other than by gorging into the sinful Biriyani of Kabuliwala..
I had ordered Gosht biriyani that comes in 2 alluminium pouches with 2 succulent pieces of mutton, a fried egg and 1 piece of aloo in each pouch. Aiding the Biriyani was Bhuna ghost which was just too tasty with 4 medium sized pieces of mutton cooked to perfection..the sinful course has Shahi tukra for the dessert..which I am adding to be my best ever tasted shahi tukra..they serve Burhani in 2 small cups as a complimentary..they also serve 2 wooden plates and 2 tooth picks and 2 tablet napkins (they look like tablets but when you wet then with a bit of water they unfold to soft napkins..this was something I saw for the first time)
Overall the experience was too good..however I would like to mention why I didn't rate the perfect score.
The one who came to deliver the food was waiting at a certain place outside eco park while we were standing at the gate where we were told that the food would be delivered while placing the order..finally when the delivery boy called us to come to the other gate we had to walk for a kilometer to get the food..and in the meanwhile all the food lost its heat and when we had them it was completely cold..though we told the delivery boy to come to the other gate he said he couldn't and that we had to fetch the food from where he was standing..hence this was the only bad experience I had..overall all was fantastic..

Heard a lot about this place.
So decided to order for biriyani on the last day of the year to end the year with a note.
Ordered for home delivery from this outlet.
As per the delivery the package that I received was well packed and delivery was within expected time.
Biriyani was awesome i must say. They serve you with egg and as well the demanded biriyani ka aloo. It was neither too oily and the taste was different and light not on much spicer side. 
We also ordered for Firni and which was good too. The sweet touch of Firni with biriyani tasted amazing.
Well satisfied with the food quantity and the quality as per the home delivery. 
The biriyani was enough for four people.
They serve in a earthen pot though which half enough.
Loved the taste!

Finally got the chance to this place
Ordered zubeeda nan, murg masala , murg biriyani and firni.

Zubeeda nan- contains 4 pieces the nan was very soft and was very yumm.

Murg masala- big pieces of chicken was served with a thick gravy, the murg masala was very tasty

Biryani- the quantity of biriyani was not good and a small piece of chicken was served , the aloo was also on the sweeter side 
The biriyani was above average

Firni- the best of the lot it tasted yumm.
Definitely one should order this.

The delivery was before time and the packaging was nicely done.

I ordered Biryani from this place on Thursday. They assured that it will be delivered bu 1:30 PM but I got my food at 2:45 PM. That too after so many phone calls. Being a delivery food joint, they should be very accurate on delivery time. I called them and complaint about the same. They also assured their manager will call me on next day. But I didn’t receive any call till now. They definitely serve good food but they should have good customer support too.

I order from this place sometimes. I am not too much into Mughlai cuisine, however I love the biriyani from this place. The earthen pot they use to send the biriyani, is something new and I you know that it an occasion when that pot is in front of you. Coming down to the food, I normally just order biriyani and I prefer it over Arsalan and Aminia, to me it seems that they use less spices and manage to taste just delicious. It is a feast for the eyes and the stomach. Order now, you will not regret it.

Ordered the...

Shahi Murg Biriyani

The Ghol is given complimentary along with the Biriyani... That too is amazingly refreshing...!!

There has been quite a buzz about Kabuliwala, lately.
I decided to go for this place this Sunday afternoon after reading such good reviews about this place.
I ordered food for me and only one of my friends, so there were only three items - Zubaida Naan with Murg Gulabo and Firni.
I was blown over by the quantity. One portion of Murg Gulabo can suffice 3 people with a medium appetite easily. And Zubaida Naan perfectly compliments this dish.
The Firni was amazing too.
Very good experience as a first time. Looking to order again soon.

Extra Points for the packaging. Quantity of biryaani was sufficient and enough for 4 people and justified with the price they charged. Taste was awesome. In dessert I had Firni. It was the best Firni I ever tasted till date. The saffron Flavoured Firni was the showstopper. 

Full value for money. Recommended

Ordered from this place on a rainy evening. Items ordered were Shahi Murg Biryani, Murg Bharta, and Gosht Keema Kulcha. I was a little sceptical about the quantity at first, however was quite surprised to find that it was more than sufficient for the 4 of us. 
The biryani came stacked with 3 pieces of eggs and 6 tender chicken pieces. The bharta came with the right combination of spices, quite different from the run of the mill bhartas served elsewhere. The Keema Kulchas was filled with minced mutton, and is a MUST try.

Overall the quality of all the dishes were amazing, and quite justified the steep pricing. Will definitely try out more from this place.

Kabuliwala was a long time wish which finally comes true in this rainy weather.Last day ordered their Mezban-E-Murgh Biriyani,it contains a big piece of Chicken,soft and juicy,one egg and an aloo. The Biriyani was amazingly tasty,quantity was impressive according the price.We also ordered two types of kababs. Murgh Sugandhi kabab was delicious and divine,it's mouthwatering. Murgh Gulabo was also splendid and terrific in taste.I would like to mention specially about their packaging,it's really grand and attractive too.Once it arrives at your place the packets itself will mesmerize your heart.Delivery was prompt and fast.Overall it's a memorable experience.Will order again soon.

Extra Points for the packaging. Quantity of biryaani was sufficient and enough for 4 people and justified with the price they charged. Taste was awesome. In dessert I had Firni. It was the best Firni I ever tasted till date. The saffron Flavoured Firni was the showstopper. 

Full value for money. Recommended

Ordered from this place on a rainy evening. Items ordered were Shahi Murg Biryani, Murg Bharta, and Gosht Keema Kulcha. I was a little sceptical about the quantity at first, however was quite surprised to find that it was more than sufficient for the 4 of us. 
The biryani came stacked with 3 pieces of eggs and 6 tender chicken pieces. The bharta came with the right combination of spices, quite different from the run of the mill bhartas served elsewhere. The Keema Kulchas was filled with minced mutton, and is a MUST try.

Overall the quality of all the dishes were amazing, and quite justified the steep pricing. Will definitely try out more from this place.

Kabuliwala was a long time wish which finally comes true in this rainy weather.Last day ordered their Mezban-E-Murgh Biriyani,it contains a big piece of Chicken,soft and juicy,one egg and an aloo. The Biriyani was amazingly tasty,quantity was impressive according the price.We also ordered two types of kababs. Murgh Sugandhi kabab was delicious and divine,it's mouthwatering. Murgh Gulabo was also splendid and terrific in taste.I would like to mention specially about their packaging,it's really grand and attractive too.Once it arrives at your place the packets itself will mesmerize your heart.Delivery was prompt and fast.Overall it's a memorable experience.Will order again soon.

We ordered 2 Mezbaan-E-Gosht Biryani, 1 Mezbaan-E-Chicken Biryani, 1 Badam Nargisi Murgh and Firni.
We could place the order easily. Kabuliwalah is professional and they re-confirmed the order.
About food, the Biryani was lightly spiced and not that heavy as Biryani usually becomes. I found this one to be a very good point. But the mutton pieces were not good and that's why I think Biryani at Kabuliwalah is overpriced. 
Badam Nargisi Murgh was delicious. The Firni was also good.

Kabuliwala's biriyany is lightly spiced, less oily, colorless but tastes great. I think this is the only place where biriyani and health are packaged together. My children loves their biriyany very much. Not only their biriyani is great but their customer service is no doubt the greatest. I am a regular customer of them. I had disputes with my orders on one occasion. When I informed them, their manager apologized and offered complimentery biriyany. This type of response I am sure I can not expect from any other outlet in Kolkata. Theally do care about their customers.

Awesomest!! Experience of biriyani. Delightful taste, adequate quantity and the Burani will sum-up your Moghlai meal. Though I had Bhuna chicken too, but I stick to their biriyanis in this review. Everything about them is lovely, their paper plates, mud cups for Burani , the paper towels and the jute red bag. On of the tastiest start-ups, definitely...
Already had them twice, can't wait for my 3rd meal. BTW, we had the Rozanna Murg Biriyani and Bhuna Murg.

A really good joint for Biriyani lovers. Really tasty and not that much oily- but again keep in your mind this is Kolkata style biriyani.

There packing is really impressive - specially inclusion of small but important components (like toothpick, paper towel) are great.

Really a good one👍🏻👍🏻

I had a worst experience with the restuarant. I had placed an order at 9.29pm and it was supposed to deliver at 10pm and after numerous calls i get to know they dont have the food. and i will get it within 10mins. i give them many calls yet they come to my door at 11.10pm and yet to my surprise they bring in the wrong order. I have to sleep hungry now... Pathetic management. the worst experience i ever had with any restuarant. Never ever will order again from you.@

Ordered mutton biryani and firni. Honestly speaking overall the biryani was good, but not worth a tag of 250 bucks. Price is high compared to the taste and quality, quantity was fine.phirni was good. You can give it a try but can't be your one and only biryani outlet.

The overall presentation along with packaging is too good to express. The taste will obviously give a sense of utter satisfaction to all the Biriyani lovers out there.

The first time when I was introduced to this delivery joint was when they had started out as a single outlet at Rajarhat and biriyani and bhuna masala(chicken /mutton) were the only options. They has come a long way with three outlets and a range of offerings now.

Since this is a take away restaurant, there's nothing to write about ambience.

Food- Both chicken and mutton biriyanis are equally good. The handi biriyani, even though it is meant for 3 people, is enough to satiate the hunger of four persons. Chicken /mutton pieces are tender and very well cooked. The eggs and big sized aloo(potatoes) along with the burani complete the dish. For side dishes, I prefer the chicken or mutton bhuna masala as compared to chicken bharta. But, there's very little difference in taste. Bharta has shredded chicken while bhuna masala contains 4pieces of meat. I've also tried their mutton kebab and it's decent. Firni is also good. All the items mentioned deserve a mention in terms of quality, taste and quantity. The only thing that I hope they do is introduce beverages like soft drinks. 

Packaging - Shahi biriyani comes in a huge handi covered with aluminum foil. Rozana biriyani comes in well sealed package of two. The side items are packed in plastic boxes while buranis come in clay cups. They also send plates, toothpicks and paper napkins along with the orders. Overall, packaging is leak proof and durable. 

Price - post introduction of GST, the pricing has increased. Even then, comparing the quantity of the items to that of the prices, I must say there's value for money. The pricing is still cheaper to that of the biggies in biriyani sector. 

Ease of ordering - One can call on any of the numbers mentioned in the link to place an order between 12noon to midnight. For a frequent customer like me, what's annoying is that I need to repeat all my details like address, landmark, contact number, name every single time that I place the order. They still don't have a process in place wherein the details can be fed once into their system and providing the contact number is enough to retrieve the details for every repeat order.

Delivery service - Initially they had a great delivery process in place and orders were delivered within 45mins to an hour. Then came the boom period. They were expanding in number and variety and honestly, the delivery mechanism went for a toss. There were days when I had to call 4to 5 times to track my order, 2 plus hours to receive the same. They were struggling to serve within time frame. Frustrated, I had stopped ordering for a couple of months. But when I ordered last weekend, my inhibitions were put to rest. They have bounced back with a fantastic delivery service again. 

Overall, this is a great place to order from if you love biriyani. A viable option if you have friends for company - it serves awesome food without burning a whole in your pocket. The only thing that I sincerely hope they do is automate the customer details to ease the ordering process for repeat customers. Kabuliwala might have started out as an alternative lunch/dinner option for office crowd initially but gradually they have become a preferred choice for both office goers and families.

In a nutshell, my rating would be 

Food - 5
Variety in menu - 4.5
Ease of ordering - 4
Pricing - 4.5
Delivery - 4. 

Overall - 4.5

Well, this place is Hogwarts for biriyani lovers! Hands down for the best Mughlai joint in the city..Next up was the all time favourite Handi mutton biriyani (with apparent flavours of mild aroma of ghee and tenderly marinated pieces of juicy mutton)..
The impressive thing you will love about the outlet is the quality of packaging with good quantity of rice,ample amount of meat ,eggs and also with the complementary drink &a disposable plates are also included..The presentations they had provided while delivery is up to its mark ..
So all in all the price is justified and food quality is awesome..

This is a delivery only restaurant. I ordered from this place a couple of times and both their veg and non veg biryanis are simply superb. I liked the sahi one over the other option, the price difference is not much so I will recommend all to go for that. The biryanis were not too spicy or oily, everything just the right amount. Quantity provided is really good and the packaging is simply brilliant. It really adds to the overall experience.

Food, particularly Biryani , is refreshingly good - light and tasty - must try. Portions are generous too. We love the stuff and order from them quite often. However, Delivery & professionalism needs to improve big time: Had a particularly bad experience today. It's 2 hours since placing the order, and no sign of food yet, even after multiple follow up calls! That's why the rating is 3.5. It's 4.5 for food (no complaints there) and 2.5 for delivery execution.

This place has been one of most sought after places serving Mughlai cuisine for a while now.We could not wait to try them after hearing such great stuff about them from friends who are generally from the it background.They almost swear by this place.Well kabuliwala is a delivery based placed and they cater to only newtown and salt lake areas for the time being.Try them once and you'll fall for them too..


We Had :- 

Shahi Gosht Biryani- One of the best Biriyanis out there.Not too oily and wonderfully flavourful.

Shahi Murg Biryani

Bhuna Murg Masala

Bhuna Gosht Masala-I tried this and it complimented the biriyani superbly.

Murg Sugandhi-Has to be one of the best kebabs i have had in a while.Soft pieces of chicken with flavour of gondhoraj Lebu.This is a favourite.

Muntaz Tangdi-Superbly made Tangdi kebabs stuffed with keema inside.

Kesar Firni-Well this spot was reserved for a dear place if mine.But kabuliwala managed to steal this spot too away from them.Current favoutite Firbi for sure.

This place is a rockstar when it comes to Mughal Cuisine.I just hope they come up serving the whole city in the near future :)

I tried this place twice before... And it is my third time when I got the chance to taste their delicacies again... It's just third try because they only deliver in the Rajarhat and Saltlake area... Also they don't have any resturant... Very sad... Otherwise it may be more than three times... They are so so so good... Their packaging is bang on... Mind blowing... I'm not describing it... Just go thorough the photos... This time I got to taste most of their dishes... Because it was a home party... I tried... 

❤❤❤ Shahi Gosht Biryani ~ Best biryani in town... Although they are saying each handi is enough for three... But believe me quantity was huge and it comes with 6 full size soft and succulent mutton pices, 3 yummy potatoes n 3 eggs... So if you share it was enough for 4 person... 

❤❤❤ Shahi Murg Biryani ~ Quantity is same as mutton one... And tasted mind blowing too... 

❤ Bhuna Murg Masala ~ Awesome one... 

❤ Bhuna Gosht Masala ~ Also mind blowing... 

❤❤ Murg Sugandhi ~ Big pices of chicken well marinated and grilled to perfection... The pices are flavorful n extremely yummy... 

❤❤❤ Muntaz Tangdi ~ And this is my favorite... Minced flavorful mutton stuffed in chicken tangdi and grilled to perfection... Month watering n mind blowing... 

❤❤❤ Kesar Firni ~ Best firni I ever had... 

They also serve you ego friendly plates for finishing all the dishes and the complimentary burani they used serve with biriyanis goes perfect with it... And the toothpick n the wet towel tablets are very needed after eat... 
So... Don't wait... Give it a try...

There are very few places that impress, entice and keep you craving for more all at the same time.

One such place is the Kabuliwala.

The place dishes out some of the best biriyanis, kebabs and firnis and are located in three locations around the city.
We recrebtly ordered in from the Lake Town outlet.

We ordered the Chicken Suganfhi Kebab and thr Mumtaz Tangdi to satiate our kebab cravibgs and none disappointed. In fact they are a must try if you are ordering in from the Kabuliwala.

For the main course we moved on to the chicken and the mutton biriyani, bith of which were packed in beautiful earthen handis. This reminds me, the packaging is top noth and makes carrying and unpacking the food a lot more easier.

As sides we chose thr chickeb and thr mutton kasha and for desserts thr Firni

Kabuliwala serves one of the best firnis in town and this sentence is ubquestionable.

If you haven't tried out the food at Kabuliwala yet...you have all the reason to envy me right now 😂

Kolkata's one of the best biryanis, hands down.

I had their biryani twice. Once from this one and another time from the sector 5 one.

The Shahi biryani is amazing. The portions are pretty huge as well. And the packaging is amazing. From plates to wet towel tablets, they provide everything. Not to mention the complementary Burhani.

The kebabs are amazing as well.

Highly recommended!

Finally this place is out of my bookmarks list and is in the been there list.
Tried their shahi murgh biryani . The packaging is commendable. Beautiful clay pots containing huge quantity of Biryani. They said one pot would be enough for 3 , but the quantity is too huge for 3 people. There were 6 pieces of chicken, 3eggs and 3 aloos.Buttermilk , given as a complimentary, was given in clay glasses. Tissues were oh so cute, looking like a polo mint.
Coming to the taste, delicious and giving off beautiful aroma..though personally, I feel the chicken pieces should have been cooked a little more . Few pieces were little chewy. One thing worth mentioning is that the biryani isn't much oily, light but tasty enough.
The buttermilk too tasted wonderful.
Kabuliwala indeed was a sinful experience 😊

As a Biryani Lover I always try to find the best biryani in town, so I find this place worthy for challenging my taste-buds.

We were at Friend's place at newtown so we ordered Chicken Shahi Biryani, Mutton Biryani, Gosht Kassa, Chicken Kasa, Murgh Sugandhi Kebab along with Mumtaz tangdi and Kesari Firni.

Kebabs: Mumtaz Tangdi is no match for any tangdi kebab in town, they were filled with spices. Tasted very good. Portion size was big.
Murgh Sugandhi was another kebab of chicken you need to try.

Biriyani: I don't have words to describe that how much good the Biryani was. All Biryani pots had 3 eggs, 3 pcs of Mutton and Chicken, 3 potatoes and huge quantity of Rice. The aroma was brilliant, portion size was good, tasted awesome. What need else?

Curry: Mutton Kassa and Chicken Kassa were also brilliant. All pcs of the meat were juicy and tasty.

Dessert: Am not a Firni lover but having Firni from here feels me like am in the heaven. It was so damn good.

*A MUST TRY EVERY ITEM FROM KABULIWALA, POCKET PINCH WAS LITTLE HIGH BUT YOU WILL NOT REGRET THAT ANYWAY*

There is nothing like eating Bengali Food and moreover there is nothing like Eating Biryani. 
My love for Biryani has gone wilder day by day and i keep on searching for the best places where i can have the best biryani possible. 

Dosent had to go too far as Kabuliwala has come to Rajarhat Newtown itself to serve the people there with their delicious food. From their other two outlets at Kolkata this outlet is a Home delivery only joint. 

Starting from their menu so its very very interesting according to me because they will not allow you to eat alone. The menu is set in such a way that you have to buy things in a quantity that will be enough for you. Rather than the kebabs and other starters the containing and quantity of Biryani has been an eye catchy material.

Staying at Chinar park was the best decision i made and that led me to other this fabulous food which were Shahi Murg Biryani, Bhuna Gosht Masala and Mumtaz Tangri.

Mumtaz Tangri : Started with the Mumtaz Tangri which was a strong grilled leg piece that looked amazing. Its not just another tangri kebab, make no mistake this is absolute blinder. The tangri had masala and spices filled inside that were giving a different feel.

Shahi Murg Biryani : This was just like its name Shahi. A matka full of Biryani that contained three eggs on the top and three pieces of Chicken with decent amount of rice for three people. The aroma and smell of Biryani made me feel like a dream. Tasty, less oily and meaty soft chicken everything was perfect.

Bhuna Gosht Masala : Usually we call it Mutton Kasa or Masala. Came with a brilliant packing. it had decent number of mutton pieces in it. very tasty indeed.

The very first outlet of Kabuliwala has made me surprised big time and i m eagerly looking forward to try their other outlets soon.

Kabuliwala makes the perfect biryani that is not too strong in flavor, moderately spicy and without the extra dose of artificial color.

Apart from Murgh & Gosth biryani, we had ordered Bhuna Murg Masala & Muntaz Tangdi and both the dishes were exceptionally well made. The chicken pieces were large, juicy and succulent, cooked to perfection!

The Kesar firni was a delightful affair too! Though the kesar flavor was missing; it tasted delicious nevertheless.

Extra points for the packaging. Price is reasonable considering the quality & quantity.

Recommended!

Being at my friend's house in Newtown and when it came down to have  dinner, we had plans for home delivery. Zomato popped this place being very close gave them a call. 

Packaging: 10/10 brilliant and beautiful. Safely packed, no spills. 
Delivery(9.5/10): They're quick! 

Food: 

✩Mumtaz Tangdi(8/10): Delicious and good sized leg pieces. Beautiful blend of ingredients. Palatable dish! 
✩Murg Sugandhi(10/10): Kono kotha hobena boss! ~ Enough said bruh! This starter was brilliant! Soft, well cooked kebab, comes on a skewer. Flavours are stupendous
★Shahi Gosht Biryani(9/10): They say it serves 3 but can some 4 easily if one can sacrifice an egg. Delicious, one mutton piece was chewy but the rest were perfect. A must try!

★Bhuna Murg Masala(8/10): This will be  a great side with your biryani. Exemplary taste, well cooked and decently sized. Try it! 

♡Kesar Firni(10/10): This is the best firni I've had in months! The texture is super smooth and the sweetness is appropriate! Eta khetei hobe kaka!

The biriyani junction in town. Absolutely in love with their Sahi Gosht Biriyani. Just brilliant in taste. With it we also ordered the Bhuna Murgh Masala which went very well with the biriyani.
For the starter Murgh Sugandhi and Muntaz Tangdi was just excellent to have.
And don't miss their Kesar Firni. The best I have tried.
Overall satisfaction was huge.
Price very reasonable for the quantity and quality they serve is perfect.

Use coupon code "SFOODS" and get Rs 75 off on your next Zomato online delivery with online payment. 

Being at my friend's house in Newtown and when it came down to have  dinner, we had plans for home delivery. Zomato popped this place being very close gave them a call. 

Packaging: 10/10 brilliant and beautiful. Safely packed, no spills. 
Delivery(9.5/10): They're quick! 

Food: 

✩Mumtaz Tangdi(8/10): Delicious and good sized leg pieces. Beautiful blend of ingredients. Palatable dish! 
✩Murg Sugandhi(10/10): Kono kotha hobena boss! ~ Enough said bruh! This starter was brilliant! Soft, well cooked kebab, comes on a skewer. Flavours are stupendous
★Shahi Gosht Biryani(9/10): They say it serves 3 but can some 4 easily if one can sacrifice an egg. Delicious, one mutton piece was chewy but the rest were perfect. A must try!

★Bhuna Murg Masala(8/10): This will be  a great side with your biryani. Exemplary taste, well cooked and decently sized. Try it! 

♡Kesar Firni(10/10): This is the best firni I've had in months! The texture is super smooth and the sweetness is appropriate! Eta khetei hobe kaka!

The biriyani junction in town. Absolutely in love with their Sahi Gosht Biriyani. Just brilliant in taste. With it we also ordered the Bhuna Murgh Masala which went very well with the biriyani.
For the starter Murgh Sugandhi and Muntaz Tangdi was just excellent to have.
And don't miss their Kesar Firni. The best I have tried.
Overall satisfaction was huge.
Price very reasonable for the quantity and quality they serve is perfect.

The food is nice, quantity will let you think of your appetite. What i liked the most is there packaging nice way to send in the meals . Why 3.5 is because your delivery staff has clearly asked for “tips” which on the way i do not like. But overall i will thumbs up for your food.

Few recommendations brought me to Kabuliwala & finally, I am extremely satisfied at the end. Their USP is the Shahi Murg Biryani, which is indeed very light-to-eat & easily melts in the mouth. Not at all rich(oil or other unnecessary spices). It never stuffed the tummy & I craved for more. The quantity which is ordered for three is actually meant for five :). The Buna Murg Masala was just 4 pieces with less gravy, but was a good pick.

The buttermilk was the darkhorse. It played it's part really well at the end. I won't comment on packaging & the plates & wipes.

It shows how much they respect customer satisfaction. Great job , Guys!

Definitely, looking for more such delicacies in future.
You all nailed it. Thanks for the experience!!

This is only a home delivery place in Rajarhat. Decided to give it a try after hearing about it from friends. The packaging, I must say, is excellent. They serve their biryani with buttermilk. Also, the delivery has awesome packaging and comes with sturdy plates and spoons which enables you to have it anywhere. The biriyani is a bit on the non - spicier side which may not entice the palate of the spice lovers. But the main thing being it is less oily and not made in dalda and does not leave an after taste as most spicy biryanis do and does not leave you feeling heavy. Also, the quantity is quite good. The rozana biryani comes with four pieces of meat, 2 eggs and 2 potatoes and also buttermilk served in a kulhar and easily serves two.
Overall a really good experience.

I have ordered food from Kabuliwala a couole of times. Their Biryani is good. It's quite light and tasty. If you're having a group lunch,  then ordering Biryani from here is quite cost effective. They have packages for 2 people,  which is branded as Rozana Biryani and one which can serve 3 people, called Shahi Biryani. The dish is a wholesome meal with nice pieces of mutton/chicken,  egg and potato. Their sides like Chicken Chap are a good bait too.  
Apart from food quality, Kabuliwala scores on their unique packaging. The food is delivered in earthen pots or zip lock pouches along with plates,  spoons and wet tissues. 
It's a convenient and cost effective lunch option which you can give a try if you're living or working in Salt Lake Sector V or Newtown area.

The best biriani served in sector 5 and rajarhat area.. It is a delivery joint and delivers in sector 5,newtown and rajarhat area. They serve biriani wrt to weight. One packet can serve 2 easily. The total package comes with 2 pieces of chicken/mutton, 1 nicely boiled mouth watering potato and an egg. This is one such biriani which have very less oil that can upset ur stomach,so order from here and still keep ur stomach ok for more.

As we all know 'first impression is the best impression', the delivery from Kabuliwala will surely give you a grt first impression.Packaging was just awesome.They also provide complimentary butter milk with biriyanis.

We ordered Rozana murg biriyani (4 pieces of chicken and two pieces of egg with two pieces of potato) and Bhuna murg masala(4 pieces of chicken).
Rozana murg biriyani is to server two people as per menu but quantity was very generous.

Biriyani was pretty good and less oily.
Bhuna murg tastes good but chicken pieces could have been softer.
What stole the show were the desserts.
We ordered Firni and Shahi Tukda-Firni was good as usual but Shahi Tukda is the one for which I will again order from Kabuliwala.It was so yummy and delicious.

But my 1st order was better in terms of taste and ease of pickup. In my 2nd order there was trouble in pick up as when we reached to collect our order they said they did not get any order from us. The manager forgot to tell the order. Anyway we hope this won't happen next time.

Kabuliwala is certainly a new player in the city when it comes to  biriyani.A pot of biriyani which is good enough for 3 adults,contain each three pieces of meat, eggs and potato .Biriyani is nicely made...potatoes n eggs are also put in dum(many places cook egg and potato separately and put together in the plate).Meat was soft and juicy.In dessert we had firni and it played its part nicely.

OMG.

That's one of a kind of paradise visit with respect to biriyani eating.Nowadays when we are crazy for restaurant foods but tensed about health hazard then Kabuliwala is a perfect solution.

First time in my lifetime being a biriyani buff I enjoyed eating biriyani without smelling that.

You can only feel when you eat because it does not have those familiar extremely overpowered smell.

It is light and almost oil free and the succulent mutton and those long grain rice with a mouth melting potatooooo............ Let me have my next morsel of this heaven

Seriously it is an experience worth to be remembered.

The packaging is also an added plus point.

The only request to the team is can you remove the egg please?

Frankly egg does not suit in this heaven.

Hope you will carry on your quality as well as taste always

If u r planning to order food for family get ready to spend 2000 Rs as the portion sizes are very small and not at all sufficient to serve one person. Dont fall for the wrong info being displayed on zomato. If u want to order food for  family order in bulk. Had to say a disappointing experience with them.

A takeaway place that offers Biryani in a presentable way and having office at Rajarhat allows me to have the experience of it. The biryani is not oily and would not stuff your tummy in a way that most others do. No burps or aftereffects, but leaves a delicious taste. Its very well packaged and delivered, so that you can have it anywhere. Must try !

Biryani is one thing Calcutta loves a lot. And to reciprocate it new biryani joints are mushrooming everywhere in the city each month. Some of them are proper dine in restaurants, while a lot are small roadside stalls and even takeaway / delivery only outlets. Kabuliwala is one such delivery only brand which started off in the Rajarhat Newtown area.
                                                                ...

Sometimes when you are too tired and feel like having a home set up to order food and relax ...try Kabuliwala.
Its an authentic place for non-veg lovers .,
The biriyani is good , the meat is fresh and nicely made .the spices make you smell twice and of course the mutton dishes are too good .
So dont wait ,want to sit back and taste class go try it .

Self-rule celebration!

As the title suggests, we resolved to fulfill our whatever desire remains in the corporate world. Determined to decree some appetizing food and eat together. Thus, adjured for Sahi Gosht biryani and Sahi Murg biryani from Kabuliwala to commemorate the day. And latter satisfied their name by delivering such delicacies with their complimentary drinks. Genuinely thankful to them. 

Both the dishes were served in big handis that included six succulent, full sized meat pieces, with three eggs and three potatoes respectively, that could serve three people. Honestly, one of the best Biryani dish I had ever tasted. And after eating your portion, you won't even fill that full that you feel irksome to work. Loved it. 
Later the we called our jollification off by bike ride to a remote place near our office, Unitech. Memorable indeed!

Ordered from here after a lot of feedback from my friends and Kabuliwala didn't disappointed me.

Ordered the famous Rozana Gost Biriyani which serves 3 people and Bhuna Murg and all of them was delicious. Biriyani was very lightweight in nature but it was tasty. Delivery was prompt too as promised.

So if you want to eat biriyani at your workplace this is the place you should call.

After having heard a lot of good feedback for this place finally decided to give it a try.For the first try I wanted to go purely with what this place is famous for and we ordered a mutton biryani for 3 people.Delivery was very prompt.The packaging of the food was excellent, everything was hot and fresh when it arrived and they also supplied proper sturdy plates and spoon with the food.
Coming to the food,the quality of ingredients used is very well which is evident from the food itself.But for my palate the rice is too bland tasting,the mutton on the other hand was adequately spiced and tender.Having said that some people having the same food with me loved it,so the verdict is if you are a spice lover this biryani will definately not attract you that much but if someone is more leaned towards light flavours this will be a hit.
For the price factor,yes it is steeper if you compare with other places serving biryani in kolkata but taking in factors like the service, quality of food and packaging I find the pricing is definitely worth it.

Prices have gone a bit steeper.. Gosht biriyani from 750 to 950..and taste has gone down a bit.. That's in a nutshell the review of the latest order which we had from Kabuliwala after about a hiatus of about 3-4 months.  Also Mutton pieces were a bit stiff this time Request to the management to look into the same.  Otherwise prompt delivery and a potential to be one of the best in Kolkata, in terms of mughlai food especially biriyani.

Quality of the biryani is degrading day by day. I have had biryani three times from here. First experience was awesome. You get what you read in the description of each item. Succulent meat pieces, well cooked potato, egg, very light biryani with chilled Burhani. Just what I was searching for long. Next time the Burhani was not served chilled and the meat pieces were not as good as the first time. Yesterday I had it for the third time and found out that the potatoes were not cooked at all. Still Kabuliwala deserves a 4 because of the tasty light biryani, well cooked meat, tasty side dishes and prompt delivery. Please take care of the quality. You are a much loved biryani destination for all the office goers in Rajarhat!

I ordered twice from Kabuliwala. First time it was Shahi Murg Biryani and next was Rozana Murg Biryani. Both times it was awesome. Packing was good and extra adding was butter milk which was very tasty. Can recommend to everyone.

It may look a bit overpriced but trust me the quantity and quality is best in that price. Biriyani is very light and goes well with their side dish. Chicken or mutton pieces in Biriyani are very succulent. Deduction of 1point is because they don't have any seating arrangement and only take away. Also to have Biriyani only is probably not a good idea, since it's very dry.

First and foremost, nicely packed food & on time delivery!!
Almost grabbed 80% marks in the packing..
Then comes about the delivery-timely delivered food at Cognizant,Bantala which is completely an outskirt!
Finally the food which is very sumptuous, ordered every thing starting from starter to dessert.
Biriyani is well cooked both mutton and chicken!
Had to cut of 0.5 marks because of mutton remained fibrous in the biriyani..
Loved the starter as well specially murg sugandhi, even appreciate the complimentary drink i.e.,mattha!
Overall its yummy 😋 
Everybody should try food from KABULIWALA....

Tried this delivery joint after hearing a lot of positive reviews. Packaging is wonderful, really innovative, specially that of tandoori chicken. The tandoori chicken tasted decent. I also ordered chicken biryani for 2 people, but the quality was enough for 3. Taste wise, I felt that the biryani was bland, should have been spicier, raita was also served with biryani.
Lastly I had ordered bhuna ghost which was again okay, nothing great.
I got a discount of 40 percent on the non biryani items.
Delivery took an hour which was as promised.
Okay joint to try out.

Recently we have ordered for Dinner on a Sunday. This was in Rajarhat area. It was observed that there was significant change in the Biryani quality. It was Dry mostly. Also the Mutton pieces were not well done. This is the first time I have experienced such below standard from Kabuliwala team.

Hope this can be rectified at the earliest.

Hence I had to downgrade the rating.

----------------------------------------


In one word "Awesome" ... from all the angles.

We ordered last Friday for a lunch treat in our office. We were overwhelmed by the presentation & the quantity of the food offered to us.

Keep serving delicious dishes as always.

Light and fragrant,  they make one of the best biriyanis in town. Plus,  the cute packaging is also an added bonus. The amount is well proportioned and the accompanying chaas is also very nice.  They deliver on tine but it is better to place the order well ahead of time. They only have delivery option as of now- no dine in.

Ordered from here after hearing a lot of positive feedbacks from friends and reading favorable reviews on zomato...

although the feedback about biryani is what pushed me to finally give kabuliwala a try , i ended up liking other stuffs which i ordered along with biryani...

Everything was neatly packed and delivered with good plates , spoons etc. Amount of biryani was sufficient for its price. The taste of biryani was a little pale. Dunno whether this is the usual taste or if it was an unusually off day...but to be frank i did not like the biryani too much... Although i admit that the kababs were tastier than the ones from Arsalan , Aminia and the likes...
                    

Will surely give another try at their biryani......kababs deserve reorder anyways

Kabuliwala is one of the best places for Biriyani in Kolkata. And that statement is setting the bar up very high. Aesthetically the presentations were excellent considering it is a delivery or takeaway only joint. Do try there Handi Biriyani. But the one dish that I`d recommend over everything else is there Gosht Handi Kebab. My family and I loved it and even called the chef later on to give our compliments. It is really one of the best mutton dishes I have ever had. 
I`d say to order well before hand and give them time for the delivery. Rushing them would give you room for disappointment and would come in the way of you enjoying the magnificent food.

Good biryani but worse service. Whenever I have tried to order there has been innumerable delays with the delivery time. And today on 5th August 2017 when i tried to order a Shahi Subzi Biryani I was told that it is not available. Even after being flexible with the delivery time the reply was that they cannot deliver the it today. All the other days were ok but today without the food and such pathetic service I think you guys deserve even worst ratings

I have ordered sahi murg biriyani yesterday. It came with a package of 3plates, 3 tissues and 3 toothpicks, 1 biriyani handi and 3 cups of burhani. I liked the food a lot. The flavour of the biriyani was very lite. Quantity  wise it's for 3 person. The meat was fully cooked and very soft.

However, the delivery was not that smooth as the delivery boy didn't bring the atm swap machine as well as his phone. So it was difficult to get the delivery.

I would like to order again from Kabuliwala just because the food was awesome.

They have made home delivery an art.I mostly order rozana murg or gosht biryani which is more than sufficient for two people.
Biryanis are delicious.Side dishes are ok among which bhuna murg masala was great.
The packaging is awesome-biryanis inside air-sealed packs,nice looking 'shola' plates,small packets of toothpicks and tablet napkins-the whole presentation looks great.
Delivery is also fast and staffs are polite.

This place was opened a few days back. Since then have heard so much about this place and rave reviews about their Biryani. Honestly it was all true! 
I had come to Central Mall in New Town, hence had the chance of getting Biryani delivered over here. Got them home. It was very very good. 
We had taken - 
Murg Gulabo - Kebabs flavoured with pure rose water. The succulent chicken pieces were so tender and the subtle aroma of the rose water made it even fantastic. 
Murg Sugandhi - This was made with Gondhoraj lemon and tasted wonderful. 
Shahi Ghosht and Shahi Murg Biryani - We had taken one plate of each of these. H E A V E N L Y is the word for it. Apart from Arsalan, after a long long time, I had such good Biryani. It had no overt smell, nor it was too oily. Had six succulent pieces of meat in each plate along with three delicious juicy potatoes and eggs. Highly recommended for the Biryani. Oh yes! Complimentary Burani was served and it was brilliant!
Firni - It wasn't that great. Although the grainy texture was perfect but taste wise it wasn't upto our expectation. 
Everything was perfect with Kabuliwala's food except there were a few glitches with the delivery. The person who came to deliver, Mr Bablu Maity was so inefficient. He had no sense of direction and kept us waiting for twenty minutes. Packaging and delivery of the firni was poor. This should be more well planned. Points have been deducted for the same reason. Otherwise all was well and good. Thumbs up for Kabuliwala. Best wishes to the team. Happy Dining! :)

I just loved it... The food, the packaging, the super fast delivery everything.. We ordered Shahi Gosth n Bhuna Murg Masala, its not that the taste of the biryani was superb but yes it was good to taste..as m a foodie so more or less I have had biryani from more or less all the renowned outlets of Kolkata. The biryani out here was not that light nor that spicy and rich and oily but was ok and the quantity was over the top, we were four of us it was sufficient enough for all though we had it in dinner. The Bhuna Murg Masala was good to taste n really added more taste to the biryani. I just loved the plates made out of the bark of tree, its very unique concept n I n my family really liked it, oh yes the coin tissue was super cute...and to add on to my surprise dey gave buttermilk as complimentary and it was totally liquidised but a single drop did not spill from all the three glasses. Packaging was too good n I got the food delivered within less than half-an-hour. Overall I liked the food that way it was presented and its worth the price. Its a must try one for sure....

Had ordered mutton biryani in office during a team lunch. The taste is simply mouth watering. Cooked with less oil and mutton pieces were substantial. The delivery was bang on time and presentation was so fresh...with clay cups and paper towels. We had some issue with the receipt, but the staff were really kind to send it back to us again. Highly recommended for office goers in Kolkata's IT Hub.

For the last couple of months I've been hearing about Kabuliwala home delivery biryani in New Town / Rajarhat area. Today, I decided to try it out and ordered a Rozana mutton biryani (Rs 600).

The delivery was on time and I could pay by card to the delivery man. The packaging and presentation were excellent and I appreciated the two glasses of buttermilk (in earthenware glasses). The disposable plates were nice and strong and could support the weight of the food without sagging or bending. But what disappointed me was the food itself.

Like most foodies in Kolkata, I have tasted biryanis from multiple sources and I think have the ability to differentiate between them. I would rate Kabuliwala biryani as mediocre and won't give it more than 2.5 points out of 5. Let me elaborate :
1) The mutton pieces were TOUGH and I really had to struggle to chew them.
2) Taste of the biryani (both the rice and mutton) was ordinary. Usually, Kolkata biryanis have an aromatic signature (such as kewra) which was conspicuous by its absence here.
3) The positives were the soft, well-cooked potatoes and less oiliness.

Mutton biryanis from other nearby (Rajarhat area) outlets like Arsalan and Aminia are definitely superior. They are also cheaper, despite having far greater overheads involved in operating swanky, air-conditioned restaurants in prime locations in Chinar Park. Kabuliwala being a purely home delivery outfit operating with much lower overheads should actually price their products lower than Arsalan and Aminia but it is the other way around.

To conclude, if one is targeting the premium end of the market, one needs to offer a premium product and not just premium packaging.

I don't think I'll reorder biryani from Kabuliwala in a hurry though I might check out their other preparations in the days to come.

Have been hearing a lot about this place from friends and the Zomato ratings were also quite encouraging so thought of giving it a try. Ordered Rozana Mutton Biryani, Bhuna Murg Masala and Phirni for Dessert.

To begin with, I must mention that even thought they are a delivery only joint, they need a minimum order of 1100/- to do a delivery. There is no exception, not even if you are willing to pay delivery charges, which is really silly. I mean if i just want to order food for myself then there is no option to order. Ideally a delivery only place shud not have any minimum order limit, not for 5 kms area atleast. This is one of the reasons i am giving it a 3.5 else the food was a 4.

Now coming to food, the portion is very good. Biryani was nicely flavoured, less oily and server with a aaloo and an egg. At Arsalaan you have to order thr special biryani to get the egg. The prices is quite good, esp in comparison to the quantity. Chicken bhuna had good chunks of chicken and the gravy was nice and thick. The packing in big red zip seal parcels was also quite neat. The Phirni was ok, i still find Arsalaan to serve the best phirni in town.

Overall a good option for delievry if you have a house party or a big group at office to place the order.

This is only a take-away and home delivery outlet. But the quality of their dishes is beyond words. Their mutton biriyani which comes in a beautiful clay hari is so near perfect . The rice is perfectly cooked with the right amount of spices and the mutton pieces are tender and aromatic. One pot is sufficient for 3. The whole package along with firni came in claypots of different size and shape and the whole presentation was beautiful. You have to order for at least 1000 INR to get the food delivered . Please do try their biriyani package once or you will miss a major contributor to Kolkata Biryani cult.

A few weeks back, we ordered Kabuliwala biriyani for Friday office lunch in Unitech building.We had read a lot of good reviews about them and probably had high expectations. First of all, their packaging was very nice - tissue, plate, etc was provided along with the food. We had ordered Chicken biriyani and mutton biryani. Portions are huge, so you should order one for 2 people. Quantity of the serving is quite good. I can't say the same about the taste of the biriyani and found it quite ordinary. Not sure if the right quality of rice is used to prepare the biriyani but I didn't find it that tasty. The mutton was well cooked in the biriyani. The chicken was a bit too fibrous and didn't really taste good.
In summary, the quantity is good but quality wise, there are better options..e.g. in the canteen!

Perhaps the best in the city in terms of biriyani.
Whenever you want togry biriyani...try the shahi ghosht biriyani in clay pot.

They serve with a special type of plate which is another USP.
A must have in your bucket list.

For improvement...
Firni is still not the best in town...looking forward to have the best one in next order

I have no option for negative rating...or else would have given it.
It's a over rated Biryani shop.
Chicken seemed to be super hard and chewy.
Biryani was  superdry, only good thing of this is the potatoes which was super soft ( over cooked).
Full marks on packaging and presentation..but they need to work a way hard to improve the quality of the main ingredient that's Biryani.
Should I judge the credibility of the store or zomato...
I have to think twice believing in zomato rating now.
Never had a worst biryani like this..
Method of cooking may be any but chicken cannot be so hard...

Kabuliwala had been on my wishlist for quite some time now,and I finally got to try their delicacies. They only provide home delivery,so we ordered that was supposed to be delivered at Eco Park.

We took Rozana Murgh Biriyani and Phirni.The packaging was brilliant.They provided complimentary buttermilk with biriyani and everything was so nicely packed,that not a single bit of anything was leaking.They also provided plates and tissues,so everything was just perfect.

Coming to the quantity and quality of food served,in one word - brilliant !! Chicken Rozana Biriyani,which they claim to serve two people,actually was enough for the three of us.The biriyani rice had the perfect amount of spices and the chicken pieces were also good enough.

There is only one negative point,due to poor network connection,there had been a problem while we were ordering.But I had specifically mentioned that the payment method would be cash on delivery,and I remember to have repeated that twice.I don't know why they thought that I have taken the option to pay by card.My bill was 430 INR.The delivery man said that he was expecting me to pay by card and hence had no change of 70 INR.I forcefully had to pay him 500 INR for the lack of change from my side and as well as his side and there was no one whom I could approach at that location. This is the reason why I had to rate them at a 4 whereas in terms of everything else,they deserve a perfect 5 out of 5.

At around 10 o'clock in the morning I made up my mind I'll have biriyani today. Well that's bcz we were discussing 'Kabuliwala' in office.
So, at 12.05, I ordered for Chicken biriyani, sugandhi kebab (Save it for your kebab love) and Firni. Well I got a 40% discount on the last two. QUANTITY and QUALITY wise I will rate 4.8/5... 0.2 less cuz therez alwayz space for new additions and improvements. If you are looking for Biriyani with more chicken and a big aloo then this is the best place for you to order. Amazing Service. 5/5 .
Perks of ordering from Kabuliwala: Nice plates, complimentary chhaas(buttermilk). They actually care about how you will have the food in office. Thanks for that. :)

The biriyani is extremely well cooked with succlucent pieces of meat, aloo and a well defined boiled egg. Quality of rice is extremely good and most importantly the biriyani doesn't feel heavy or oily. The portion easily serves two.
Overall a great experience, will repeat order soon. Good job Kabuliwallahs👍🏻

It's been 3 weeks in a row now this joint is serving us. I guess it's the best delivery restaurant in DLF2_EcoSpace_Gianjali Park_Unitech circle where we are used to eat horrible food at astonishing prices. We have experimented with most of the food they offer by now. My personal favorite has been Shahi and Rozana Gosht Biriyani, as I am not much of a chicken lover myself.
Gosht Handi Kebab and Bhuna Murg Masala goes perfect as a side dish along with India's one the most popular rice preparation. As long as quantity is concerned, we order a 'serves two' for three people. Quality of oil and ingredients used can be understood from the taste, and they are easy on your stomach as well.However, there are a few drawbacks as well. Highly priced menu makes Kabuliwala a strictly 'Contribute and Eat' kind of food joint. If anyone is planning an Office party and the catch is to serve people with delicious mouth watering North Indian delicacies at good price, Kabuliwala is definitely a go, given that budget is not an issue.If you are planning a self sponsored treat, it's going to burn a hole in your pocket.Just a suggestion for the restaurant authority, a bit of salad can be useful at times. If you can look into the matter.

They provide only delivery and their packaging is awesome... 

We ordered shahi murg biryani as gosht biryani is not available.... Tastes good... 

Service is excellent as we got our order within 15 mins....

Will order again as have not tasted their mutton because a biryani without mutton and aloo is not a biryani after all... recommended...

Finally tasted Kabuliwala's much talked sahi handi biryani at lunch today. This place has become one of the famous take away joints in Rajarhat lately, their Sahi Mutton Biryani handi priced at 950, which is said to serve 3 people can easily serve 4 people as well. Pretty generous with the amount, the biryani here tastes different and quite delicious. There is not much oil and still you can feel all the spices right up. The mutton was cooked real nice. We went for the Murgh Bhuna Masala as the side with the biryani and it was delicious. It had an authentic mughlai flavour in it, the curry had a thick taste of just the correct amount of malai and butter masala. Maybe they can go for boneless chicken pieces for this one. Their firni on the other hand was quite ordinary, I will prefer a Alibaba/Aminia firni over it anyday. Kabuliwala has good value for money, serves quite lovely biriyani, do try.

Take away only outlet. Food was well packed, no leaking of oil or buttermilk. Packing 5/5

Ordered rozanna murg biryani and bhuna murg masala. Contains 1.2 kg of biryani enough to serve 3 people in my home. Rice was well cooked Nd chicken was juicy. Low on spices and oil. Perfect as desired. Bhuna murg masala was also good. A perfect add on for the biryani. Buttermilk was fine. Food 4/5

Along with the food they provide two plates which looked pretty nice, two coin tissue and two toothpicks..

One of finest joint for Mughlai food lover especially Biriyani. The best Biriyani I did have in recent times. Not only it tastes better, it does not add any discomfort for eating. By Biriyani, we used to have recall for Arsalan, Aminia etc. Now, after Kabuliwala arrived, I have stopped Arsalan and Aminia. Both of them are arrogant in behaviour and you are certain for physical discomfort after having food them. But with Kabuliwala being delivery only outlet, it scores very low on the delivery aspect. Within New Town, it asks for minimum order of Rs 1000 and Rs 100 for delivery which I believe is unfair. Inspite of the fact I love their food, just because they force me to buy more food than required for my family and also pay additional delivery charge, I restrict myself from ordering there. Hope they will re-think this aspect. Rated below 4 because of the service aspect.

A purely biryani  joint with few other north indian dishes. Firstly the service was really prompt although my area was action area II where they are yet to expand via online order. However they did deliver me my parcel at RS.50/- extra charge. 
I was intending to try their place as it has been trending on zomato and people are rating it above 4 *. So i ordered their mutton biryani which serves 2 people and firni. The quantity was huge and it actually served 3 people at my place. The mutton pieces were really nice, juicy and good. There were 4 mutton pieces and 3 potatoes and 2 eggs to be exact. All were good. The biryani was low on oil and spices . But somehow we did not enjoy the biryani taste as much as i had hoped . It just dint fulfill or feel like we were having biryani. I would any given day prefer aminia biryani . 
Also the prices are really steep and tastewise not worth 600/-. I ordered as a trial and i had no option. So they should consider going for smaller quantity and lower rates. 
Firni was good and had almonds in it and voila priced at 30/-. The best was their buttermilk which was really refreshing and their packaging is superb.
Overall i think the biryani is over hyped and very expensive for a delivery only joint.

This was my 3rd time relishing experience of the Kabuliwala biryani. The biryani is so light and oil free that you would not feel full even after gulping a full plate. The biryani and the firni is simply delicious and mind-boggling. And when it comes to service and presentation, they truly deserve a thumbs up. Highly recommended for all biryani lovers...

Ordered Rozana Gosht Biryani from this joint. The delivery was a bit late but it was worth the wait. The first impression, well the packaging was good, they even provided tablet tissues, tooth pick and Salan. The food was hot and the biryani was light, not too oily. The portion were just perfect, not too little and not too much.

Overall it was a good Biryani experience!

A no-fuss delivery only joint serving piping hot on the best biriyanis in the city around Salt Lake and New Town area. 

For starters had sumptuous Mumtaz Tangri. A must for carnivorous, chicken drumsticks stuffed with mutton keema and cheese. In side dish creamy Murg Bharta a perfect complement to their sinful biriyanis.

Their concept of packaging is extremely unique. Biriyanis are served in a huge clay handi with complimentary buttermilk. Only thing where they needs to improve about their delivery timeline commitment.

This was my first time experience of this place. Every time earlier we thought its gonna be so much food and would get wasted but this time we got the guts and ordered mutton biriyani for two people and three firnis. Food came before time. The things I wanna talk about are the packaging, it was perfect to the T. They put so much effort in detailing. The giant delivery came with cute small paper plates two coin tissues and toothpicks. Raita in two small mud cups. Food was mind blowing, it was kinda soul food for me. Mutton was falling off the bones. Each grain of rice was nicely coated in ghee. Perfect spice blend. Potatoes were perfectly cooked. However the ultimate topper was the firni. It was so smooth and melting in mouth. To our surprise it had almonds and other dry fruits inside. Very satisfying experience will order more. Value for money is perfect, 690/- for everything is good enough.

Ordered Shahi Murgh Biriyani, Bhuna Gosht & Bhuna Murgh, and Mumtaz Tangri . Biriyani is easily better  than the outlets of Arsalan/Aminia @Rajarhat . Light, and tasty, with 2 well cooked and juicy chicken pieces, 1 egg,1 aloo and quite a good amount of rice. 😊 Bhuna Chicken was better than the Bhuna Gosht . Mumtaz Tangri however stole the show with juicy leg pieces filled with generous amount of keema . Lastly a review wud be incomplete without mentioning their packaging 😍 
RATING :
Food : 4.5* ( both in quality and quantity)

Highlights 
🔸applauds to the customer service ( ordering, delivery, payment) is smooth. You can pay through card too, just mention while ordering. 
🔸Quantity and quality of food is great and packaging is full proof. They give proper plates and spoons for firni. 
🔸what I liked : all kebabs and the firni 💯/💯
Go for shahi biriyani instead of normal. 
I found the biriyani very simple (well that's authentic kolkata biriyani but am more of hydrabadi biriyani person), aloo and mutton pieces were yummy.
 Overall a nice place to order from.

however...we wud have been happier if the chicken biryani also came in the kabuliwala special earthen pot which is now available only for the mutton biryani

Finally after reading about lot of reviews we ordered shahi ghost biriyani. First surprise was price was increased to 900 against 750 as published in zomato. Moreover they charge 100 for delivery because of which I picked up. Now for the taste rice was good since it is less greasy compared to other biriyani joints but mutton pieces were not at all good. The biriyani mutton pieces all of 6 was hard,fibrous and chewy.
Won't be ordering again in near future.

Ordered shahi gosht biryani and murg gulabo. The quantity and flavor of the biryani is really good. It comes with three eggs, potatoes and six pieces of succulent mutton. It's really light, non greasy and flavorful. Murg gulabo was an interesting try with a beautiful aroma of infused rose petals. Also, liked the complimentary butter milk that came with the biryani. Overall, kudos!

Today we ordered chicken and mutton biriyani from Kabuliwala.we heard a lot about their famous sahi biriyani and hence thought to go for that.biriyani was good ,not at all oily so I must say it was easy to digest. Qunantity was huge .one hundi biriyani us enough for four people.packaging quality was very good.they have provided chaach as a complementary. But somehow I felt it is overpriced.taste wise they can improve a lot.last but not the least we ordered firni ad well which was a pure bliss.

Ok. So what's Kabuliwa.la (perhaps a domain name initiated business!)? This is pure play experiment of a so called 'wanna-be entrepreneur'. Must be the brainchild of a food loving Indian - let's do 'business' and it must be like WowMomo, or Panda Express or a mix of both!!

I tasted their Biriyani! It's  not bad. Not much oil, quantity is adequate. But, hey no dish below 500 bucks for 2 people?! You are in the Biriyani marketplace of Kolkata. A dish at the footpath starts from Rs 60! And those who are well known for years serves at Rs 150 - Rs180/plate. Ok, an egg and a potato doesn't land you at a place to start charging Rs 250 per person. I tasted your Biriyani, as I said. It's not that good! And yes, what if and exactly what if I am a bachelor, a person alone who doesn't need 2 plates? He he! You don't have an option below Rs 500! You are much like the Yellow Taxi walas in the town. 'Baas 10 plate bechna hai, aur 10 plate mein pura din ka paisa aa jana chahiye!'

I am utterly upset. Last Sunday (20th May) ordered 2 plates of Mutton Biriyani (for 4 people) and a plate of Chicken Biriyani (2 people) for the guests in my house. It was 7PM and I assumed I have 3 more hours in hand for them to deliver before our dinner. Ok, order accepted. I receive a call at 9PM. They say, "Sir Mutton Biriyani is out of stock. We have couple of more Chicken Biriyanis left. Would you mind if we deliver only 2 chicken Biriyanis?"  Come On! That's it. I am done. You have proven your level, quality of service, and the kind of business you do! "Cancel the full order", was the only word left with me! And I had to go back to them who have been serving us good Biriyani for more than a year now - Arsalan Chinar Park.

NEVER NEVER NEVER skip preparing your dinner depending on this bunch of 'bikers first'! They bike a lot, but have targets on Biriyanis! Once the target reached, they will close for the day, leaving you hungry for the night!!!

Ordered couple of times in the last week. The biriyani was excellent. Food quality and quantity were both satisfactory. A single plate serves two people. Contains 4 pieces of meat, 2 potatoes and 2 eggs. When ordering mention the number of people sharing the foods. They will pack accordingly. With biriyani they provides complimentary butter milk  sealed in an earthen pot, which is quite nice. 

The side dishes are also excellent. My favorite is Bhuna Gosht. The mutton pieces are extremely succulent. I would highly recommend this dish even more than the biriyani. 

Delivery is extremely efficient. Prompt. Supports both cash and card payment.  The packaging is  more than excellent.  In fact, I have never seen such effective packaging in any other deliveries. Each delivery includes bio-degradable plates, compact towels, etc.  Each of the items are eye-pleasing but most importantly these small things makes all the difference  -  to nature, to peoples's heart. 

Highly recommended for team party or get together. A brand certainly to look forward to. Wish they will spread their business soon outside Rajarhat and Salt Lake and will give tough competition to the likes of Aminia or Arsalan. My best wishes for them.

For a Biriyani lover (like me), itz hard to ignore a 4.5 rating restaurant that is famous for its biriyani in such a decent pricing. Ordered biriyani from this outlet few days ago. The outlet Newtown brunch located near the DLF Gate no. 1 & Sec V brunch located near the 201 Bus stop.

Now come to the review part -

Positive point -
1. Pricing and quantity - The pricing of each item is very much decent and the quantity they mentioned , is purely true.
2. Food - Probably one of the best biriyani, I have ever tasted. Three glass of complimentary Raita comes with it, which also tastes good.

Negative point -
1. Availability - Sahi Biriyani, which is their hot favourite item is sometimes becomes Out of stock due to high demand. So better book your biriyani by a simple phone call.
2. Delivery - Their Delivery radius is small unless you placed a bulk order.

We ordered -
Chicken Sahi Biriyani - The biriyani came in a clay pot which is enough for a good impression. The clay pot was well sealed. The rice was perfectly cooked and the oil portion was highly noticeable, It was lite in nature, 3 pieces of egg and 6 pieces of chicken were there. Chicken pieces were all tender and juicy in nature. The whole quantity is enough for 3 persons. The raita comes in a clay glass also tastes good. Highly recommended.

In conclusion, I will say Kabuliwala is one of the best Take away Biriyani corner in Kolkata. Forget about Arsalan and Aminia, try biriyani here and you will become fan of it. The price is too decent in terms of quantity and quality. No extra VAT was added, so really a blessing when you are tight on budget. They also served wooden plate, coupon voucher(Which can be redeemed in your next visit within a specific time). Overall a brilliant dining experience.

This seems very deceitful approach from such a nascent brand when they rebuff the earlier stated assurance of giving corporate discount on an order of more than 50 plates of biriyaani and now they are telling the same offers can be made if order is of more than 100 plates. This shift were made within a span of 3 days. This is not the way you should lure customers for bulk order then denying. Moreover the price has become exorbitantly higher.

Another Briyani chain that has been making its mark these days is Kabuliwala. 

The taste is definitely gonna soothe your taste buds and the packaging will make you feel special. 
Comes with a chaach and a hygiene packet, it is a totally new trend starting and sure is a good one.

P.s. - if you think of ordering order soon, they run out of orders quite fast. ;)

I ordered twice from Kabuliwala and was happy on both occasions. I won't say that the biryani was extraordinary but its quite good. I specially liked the way they deliver the food with eco friendly plates, Ghol, tissue etc which makes it real convenient if you are in office or some place other than home. Quantity was good. Sides are not that good and very ordinary.

Kabuliwala  is one of the best briyani available in places like Newtown where half of the resturants refuse to deliver.The quantity of Rozana Biriyani is more than enough for two people.Recently we tried their new dish mutton handi kabab , which is a bonless mutton dish with shredded pieces and a rich thick gravy.This was simply delicious .Their newly introduced chicken  bharta was also very mouth wateringly delicious.Me and my husband are truly fan of their food.

I have a very bad experience with Kabuliwala
I wanted to order a Sahi Biriyani and Mumtaj Tengri for home delivery for our guests. The person who took the order told me that there is no side dish available today. I asked him if they will be able to deliver or not as the.minimum order value for delivering at location is Rs. 1000.00. The gentleman asked me to wait and finally confirmed as the side dishes are not available they will deliver the order without delivery charges though the bill value is Rs. 600.00.
I informed my guest accordingly. After 10 min someone called me again and told me that I have to add any other side dish to make the bill value 1000 or pay the delivery charge.
When I told him that the person who took the order has confirmed me thatbthe food will be delivered, he just simply said that the person is new and "he" didn't receive the call. My order was finally cancelled and now I have to make an alternate arrangements.
I am very much disapponted with this sort of attitude.
My point is since they confirmed the order, they should have delivered the same and show some respect to their customer.

Some of my friends had decided to have biriyani in lunch today, and hence tried Kabuliwala biriyani for the 1st time. Rice was cooked very well. And liked the mutton piece too.. but too be frank, chicken piece looked a bit overcooked for me. They are providing butter milk with every pack of biriyani, for that I have added 0.5* here. And last but not the least, - food quantity is huge!

I would not express my views for or against any other dishes as I've never tried any but the biriyani is worth the appreciation.  
Absolutely recommended to everyone.

A complete package with the best taste. Hassle free delivery at the door step. Perfect combination but only sad part they don't serve for 1 people. We need a partner always to have there biriyani. :)

Great taste ... Great packaging... The biriyani tasted awesome and less oily. The ghol was too good. Delivery was bit slow. The quantity of murgh biriyani was way more than expected. The menu told that it would serve 2 but it is enough for 3 people and the chicken pieces were quite big.

I do not have much of a choice when it comes to home delivery as I have limited restuarants delivering to my place. However, I strongly recommend Kabuliwala to all as it not only delivers to my place in Sapoorjee but at the same time ensures that your dining experience is justified. Starting from its delicious food to the unique packaging of the food, everything impressed me to the core. Moreover, I must also talk about their generosity and customer service because they treated me with Tandoori Chicken which actually I ordered. Here when I say Treated, I actually mean it because during delivery they forgot to get my Tandoori which they got after some time n due to this mishap they proactively made it complimentary!! Now thats what I call an Awesome service!! Big thanks!!! Keep it up!!

Sinful Biriyani... The tagline is spot on... We Kolkatans love our Biriyani with the Aloo, the egg, and generous amounts of meat... And Kabuliwala caters to that Bengali emotion quite well... No wonder they are expanding so fast...
The Biriyani that comes in a clay handi is an absolute delight... The rice is soft and aromatic and the meat perfectly cooked... The Aloo is the killer here, just soft enough to melt in your mouth... The meat portions are generous as well... People with standard appetite would have immense trouble finishing off their Biriyani since the quantity is huge... I have tried the Kababs as well and they pretty much complement the Biriyani experience... 
Long live Kabuliwala... You have certainly given the big players in the Biriyani scene a run for their money...

Me and my friend ordered biryani after hearing so much hype about this chain.  We ordered by 7:30 and were said it will be delivered by 9. But upon calling them at 9:15 we learned they forgot about our order and promised to deliver in next 15mins. We received it by 10 which was super late. All we could say is you guys should have informed that delivery will be super late so that we could have thought of some alternative. Next coming to taste for me as well my friend it was tasteless. Neither I am in favor of super spicy food. But even finding salt was difficult for me in the biryani.  The only scoring point it gets is for packing and quantity( which I think is worthless if you don't fulfill criteria of  delivery on time and taste ). People liking minimal taste can give it a try. But for moderate  tastebuds like me and hyper tastebuds its a big no!

Was waiting for a long time to taste Kabuliwala Biriyani and the wait paid off. Now straight to food review.
Chicken Biriyani/ Rozana Murg Biriyan - The biriyani is very light in taste without the unwanted smells and oils. Some may like this, some may not depending on their taste bud but my family loved it. The rice quantity is sufficient for 3. The chicken pieces are well cooked and generous in size.
Murg Masala - 4 well cooked, soft and generous sized chicken with good amount of gravy. The masala in the gravy is very well cooked and blends well.
Firni - Definitely try this for all those who love it.
Packaging - Very well thought and some value addition done to give it an edge over other food delivery packets. The capsule inside is a surprise for everyone. You will really appreciate the details and thought gone in the packaging.
Add on - The Buttermilk comes free but tastes really good.
Lastly, I would appreciate the delivery person who took time and patience to explain us the contents and mostly importantly told us to shake the buttermilk well before drinking for better smell and taste. He could have just handed over the packets and left which he did not do.
I wish Kabuliwala also opens in other parts of the city soon so that more people enjoy and relish tasty oil free Biriyani with best packaging.

Today me n my roomie ordered a chicken briyani first of all we called them around 7.30 p.m. they said they will give the delivery at 9 p.m. which was too late according to the ordered placed time and when we rang up them around 9.15 p.m. they said they forgot about our order and promised to deliver in next 10 mins but we received our order around 10 p.m. which was super late and they were not acting professionally and the chicken briyani of 400 rupees was disaster in taste no salt feeling not at all good presentation too no briyani feeling no good pieces of chicken . It was srsly a bad experience in the matter of money time and taste.

A friend had recommended this place to me, and I am so glad I took her suggestions. They serve the biryani in clay pots( the handi that serves 3 can easily feed 4 people), and give glasses of butter milk too. They have a very innovative way of packing their tissues- they are compressed to look like circular tablets, and my family was highly amused by this, as well as the beautiful plates that they provide. The biryani was very light, but had a beautiful aroma. Needless to say, Will definitely order again!

I opted for this kabuliwala outlet for delivery service. Well this is one of best outlet to have biryani in Newtown if u want to get ur food delivered at home 😊

I ordered murgh biryani as I was craving for biryani from quite long.. Biryani tastes delicious.. Aroma of the biryani was so good.. I felt it can be little more spicy though I m not a big fan of spices .. The quantity of food is more than enough .. One get two full packets of biryani filled with two pieces of chicken 🍗, one egg 🍳 and 2 pieces of potatoes🥔 in each packet.. 

Really impressed with there packaging idea.. The give u free buttermilk in mud glass . 

Also they ll give u two plates, toothpick n coin tissue. 

Really happy with the service.. looking forward to have biryani again ..

We have ordered biriyani from this place to my work place as I heard a loooot about it, so had an expectation also but it didn't meet my expectation. The style of biriyani I like it was not like that. It was less oily and less masala. But the packaging was awesome bot the food. So basically I didn't enjoy the food but enjoyed the other thing like a plate, dry tissue and chanch with the biriyani.

Kabuliwala has became very much popular in all the offices of New Town area. We can see teams partying in office canteens with Biriyani in attractive packets from Kabuliwala. Couple of days earlier our team was also ordered veg, chicken and mutton biriyani and side dishes. Most of us did not like the chicken biriyani thought it had 2 pcs of chicken ;). The biriyani was flat in taste and very less spicy.It was felt like boiled and dry chicken pieces are kept in that. Only 2 of us liked the biriyani who ordered veg. The packing and other elements like plate,tissue and clay potted complementary drink was good though.

Had ordered food on a friday afternoon. Knowing there will be heavy rush, we placed the order before 12, and asked to deliver at 2. However we received the order at 3, that too after continuous phone calls. Reason provided by them was that their bike had an accident and the food has fallen on the road. Coming to the food, it was really good. Less oily and quantity was huge. Also, innovative way of packing. However, please order way before for timely delivery

By now, every one of Unitech/ Candor Infospace and other adjacent IT sector prevailed area must have tasted their Biriyani once.
The Biriyani comes in a clay handi with proportions of 3people. With 6mutton pieces and 3aloo 😋 , the Biriyani is too good to be true. 
The packaging is very unique. They give complementary drinks which taste like Chanch and plates along with the Biriyani.
It's a must try!

A lot of Restaurants are coming up with different flavors and techniques of preparing Biryani. Mughlai and Arab Cuisine is delicious, be it Vegetarian or Non Vegetarian !
 
Kabuliwalas' Biryani by far was the most satisfying experience in Kolkata. Sinful Biryani !

Ordered for Rozana Murg Biryani. 
Delivered well in time and they waived the delivery charges being Sunday.

Heavenly, beautiful blend of aroma and spices. 
The Chicken Biryani was a joy to eat with the right amount of spices cooked just so right, the Chicken pieces were so amazingly cooked absorbing the flavor of the spices and just so tender and juicy. 

Delectable Chicken. 

Unlike the many places in Kolkata, that overdo their Biryani by overpowering it with too much spices, Kabuliwala finds a perfect balance of flavor where the meat doesn't lose its importance. 
I have got my reservations at having Chicken Biryani for the fear of losing out on the meat and finding bones. I took my chances and they didn't let me down. 

The serving size is pretty decent and is more than enough for the number of person illustrated for. If you do not have a big appetite, one Biryani cans serve two.

The Firni also tasted marvelous. A must try, simply unpretentious.

Should mention, presentation is their USP.
Thoughtfully and decently packed in red coloured pouches with complimentary Butter Milk in earthen pots with hard plates, tablet napkin and toothpicks, a welcome gesture.
It's not only eye soothing, it’s a complete package, enough to ensure that you get the ordered meal to an experience.

One word – WOW !
Keep up the spirit team. Kudos to the team for the good service !

We ordered food several times from Kabuliwala Rajarhat outlet. Liked their mutton biriyani too much. It comes with butter milk as welcome drink. It's a must try dum biriyani.

Quantity: more than enough for two.
Quality: Very good, if you are a Kolkata biriyani lover, you must try this once.
Service: Promt.

Cons:
Somehow I am feeling that the quality is slightly degrading day by day. 
Maximum days they are unable to deliver if you order after 8.30/9 pm.

I ordered at my Unitech office Murg Biriyani. Coming to the packaging probably the best in Kolkata. You won't find a perfect home delivery like Kabuliwala. The presentation for home delivery was awesome. They serve plates not just ordinary thermocol but good quality hard plates with chaach for biriyani.

The biriyani was not heavy like others and it was light and good for health conscious. You can feel that oil used is of good quality and no dalda is used. But what I feel is that the flavour is somehow missing. Its good its light on stomach but the flavour and the rich taste of biriyani is somehow missing. Quantity wise its awesome and also also the piece of biriyani provided was of big sizes.

Delivery is quick! I would recommended it to IT persons around New Town to try during Team lunch or dinnner.

Very prompt delivery and reasonable prices. The veg biryani for 2 was packed thoughtfully. It was a pretty good Calcutta biryani; they got most things right. All the veggies and paneer were there as promised :) I didn't enjoy the dry fruits as much, quite unnecessary. The quantity was more than ample. The phirni was quite enjoyable as well. A reliable option for that stray weekday biryani craving.

Tried the Gosht Biriyani, Chicken Kosha & Firni. Great biriyani. More than adequate portion amounts. Great packaging. Delivery dealings could have been bit more professional, though... 8th Oct 2017: Pathetic delivery service. Delivered chicken biriyani instead of mutton biriyani & went away. Called up. No politeness of an apology. Never ever again. Typical non-professional impolite small-time business outlet.

Having heard a lot of Kabuliwala, finally I had the chance of tasting its Biriyani, the other day. And it happened to Mutton Biriyani. After a long time I relished some delicately made and properly spiced plate of biriyani. It had no such overwhelming synthetic flavor which almost makes me puke! The mutton pieces were perfectly cooked. 
It was light, fragrant and wonderfully tasty. Till now, best kolkata biriyani experience.

Coming to taste, it wasn't as i imagined, coming from Rajasthan and having a love for chilli it was not up to my par, but apart from that taste was good.
Still want to try their chicken dish

Ordered from this outlet for the first time and the delivery was prompt.The packing was wonderful and the clay pots are really cool when having food. Actually the quantity is impressive even 3 people can easily share it. The mutton was so soft and really big sized. The taste of biriyani was not similar like other mughal restaurant giants. The aroma was so good that water started coming from mouth. Less oily also a makes it wow and finally the firni is an add on. Definitely will visit soon.

Food was fine. So plain in taste, a bit too less spicy. You get a small cup of buttermilk.
3. Quantity 4.0
Unlike the other restaurants, they give two pieces of meat, one egg and one potato (this is for one) in one biryani. But you have to compromise on the amount of rice. Still, its a fair proportion.
4. Packaging- 4.0

It was great. The package was really good with some solid paper plates. The biryani comes in good foil bags. And yes, tablet napkins and toothpicks. I don't remember Aminia or Arsalan providing any of these.
5. Price - 4.0
In comparison with the big outlets here in Calcutta, they are giving so much for so less.

Don't wait, order today!

This food joint is rated at 4.4 so wanted to try out their biriyani. After reading all reviews we decided to order from kabuliwala. Overall packaging and their new concept of tissue was very nice. But when it comes to food the taste wasn't good according to the price they charge and the Mutton pieces were not properly cooked the biriyani had less oil less spices very light but it didn't taste good so no point making it so light. They make awesome firni just loved it. My 2star rating is for their neat and clean packaging and for their firni. ## disappointed and this food joint is highly rated it doesn't even deserve a 4star rating

I have not seen their joint - heard they only deliver! They sure deliver, and how! 

Kabuliwala is a perfect example of running a successful food joint around limitations and also creating great brand value! The biryani they serve come in many sizes (also customizable and available in travel packs). That's neat to begin with. The service is prompt and effective (the delivery boy came with an infectious smile on a busy weekday lunch hour and carried a swipe machine with him). How cool is that? They also provided pretty disposable bags, plates, spoons, and mini wet tissues.
The biryani was neatly packed and divided into single servings, each with 2 pieces of meat, a potato, an egg, and a side of burhani. It was fresh, aromatic and tasty. Highly, highly recommended!

Initial impression of this place was formed on positive second hand reviews from New town office goers, which got reinforced by a first hand experience in Feb 2017, when we ordered Mutton Biryani in the claypot along with the accompanying buttermilk for an office lunch.
Service was crisp, with the order taker clarifying at the beginning only on delivery time and payment mode. Taste was remarkable, with large chunky pieces of mutton, along with nicely roasted potatoes and booked eggs. Only caveat was orders outside New town carried a ₹100 delivery charge.
Subsequently, tried to order from my home location in sector 3 , Salt Lake City. The outlet put a second caveat, that orders to Salt Lake carried a ₹100 delivery charge along with minimum order value of ₹1000.
Given this is a delivery/ take away outlet, not having a robust delivery model is a serious drawback. The outlet needs to tie up with a delivery service like Zomato or Swiggy to better deliver across locations. A delivery charge is reasonable, but combined with a significantly high minimum order value, it forces people to look for alternative even when they are ready to pay a delivery charge.

If you are in new town/sector 5 area and you haven't tasted kabuliwala biryani, then you are definitely missing something. The packaging is definitely a benchmark and the entire bundle is nothing short of a bag of goodies for a foodie. You get to know the difference right from the point you give them a call and rest assured you will be warmly guided to the best value for money offering based on your need. The delivery guy has amazing etiquettes and your overall experience gets multiplied as soon as  you open your food pack...and you can't wait to relish your taste buds. 
PS: Those plated in the pic are also part of the package and yes its not thermocol or paper ...just order once and feel the difference

Kabuliwala Biriyani was Awesome. It was so tasty and succulent . The chicken was very soft . We placed order Murgh Biriyani for 3 people. But trust me, it can be served to five people easily. They have 6 pieces of chicken, 4-5 pieces of Aloo and 3 eggs  along with Butter Milk . Their packaging was superb.

Kabuliwala serves great biriyani and an awesome firni !!

We had placed an order for about 25 people from our office.
It included almost everything from their menu starting from shahi gosht biriyani to murg biriyani,Shahi subzi biriyani,rozana gosht biriyani,rozana veg biriyani and ofcourse kesar firni!!

Food preparation was very good with less oil and  less spice but good taste and  flavour.
And quantity is very satisfying.
Firni is probably the best i have tasted in the town so far.

 The packaging was superb with provision of nice beetle plates, butter milk in earthen glass, tissue coins , and toothpicks.

Altogether a very good experience and certainly i wl order more from this shop :)

For the first  time i ordered a murg biriymi  handi for my family of four . initially  i was  not sure of their quality as well as  quantity. When the deliveryar0 boy arrived  at pre fixed time, i was impressed by the packing of food.On opening the handi the sweet  aroma  of the  biriyani filled the room.The meat pieces  are really  good and tasty.I had devioured many types  of biriymi but this  Kabuliwallah is something  different and i suggest to try it out .you will definitely experience  something different  from other varieties. I look forward  to place repeat order in near future.

Hi ,
Just now we have finished our dinner with kabuliwala rozana chicken biriyani & bhuna ghost..this is our second time try after January ...but this time food quality is worst..just better than road side...biriyani rice has no taste , chicken pieces are not properly cooked , muttons are half cooked, Bhuna gosht is just like 'bhuna ghost', burani is like water , only firni is very good ...i will never buy this start up brand ever..

Bogus delivery communication. Ordered in my house in Newtown ,needed a biriyani , ordered it.person told it to make the order 1000 to avoid delivery charge. Accordingly ordered mutton to make bill 1100. Still charged 100 RS delivery charge. Called back the person and she was very rude and told that the free delivery offer is for 1500 only. Horrible communication. RS 100 is not a big deal but cheating is. Don't think will order again

Disappointing service, misleading front desk. I wanted to place an order for Shahi Gosht Biriyani. The lady who picked up my phone suggested to add one more dishes saying order above 1000 would come under free delivery. So I added the Bhuna mutton. The guy  called me and said the mutton dish not available,and suggested chicken instead. When Bill comes, it shows mutton, and delivery charge. Upon calling the lady was adamant and said that the delivery is free only above 1500. If it's true then, the front desk was lying, which is not acceptable  the food looks good though. Eateries let this can do much better if they get out of their cheap behavior.

Ordered Mutton, Chicken and Veg Biriyani to our office in sector 5. I had mutton biriyani. The packing is awesome, in handi they provide the biriyani. The provided plates are so good to see. Now coming to biriyani, it had 3 potatoes, 3 eggs and 6 pieces of mutton. The biryani was light yet flavorful. The mutton piece was also good and well cooked. All in all, it was yummy.

Excellent Biriyani after a long long time. When the ace biriyani makers in town are slowly falling, this one evolved of nowhere. Best part, no big promises, no long listing menu only good quality food. Light Biriyani, Professionalism, consistency and excellent packaging are some of the greatest features of Kabuliwala. If you are an office goer around SecV or Rajarhat, not trying this new one is a big miss.

Loved the Biryani and the most way it's delivered. Beautifully packed in neat handi's with bhurani in individual sand cups. 
The taste is a welcome change from Arsalan or Shiraz Biryani and what I loved most about it it's less greasy or oily and the quantity is more than sufficient. They say one mutton handi is for 3ppl but if ur a poor eater then 4ppl can easily share it. 
Am so happy and glad we tried this place!

Kabuliwala is becoming a hot topic among sec 5-newtown tech people and after having their food I can understand why. We ordered Shahi gosht biriyani-they give huge quantity and biriyani is less spicy but very tasty. As side dish there was Shahi gosht-it was yummy. Firni was also very good. Pocket pinch is on the moderate side.

Its awesome !! Truly ! I took 3 packs separately for 200 rs each pack. It was not given in Handi rather beautifully packed in zipper. The arika nut leave plates were charming and added to the taste. Each pack contained 2 chicken to the surprise other than 1 egg and 1 potato. 

Once you eat Kabuliwala biriyani you will forget all other biriyanis of any leading joint in kolkata. I can bet on this ! One pack was good enough for 2 . I wish they maintain their quality in long term.

Kabuliwala is located at Rajarhat, New Town.

This place is specialised in Biriyanis. This place offers only delivery system.

Ordered the Murg Biriyani, which was well presented. The taste of biriyani was awesome. Less oily and spicy with tender meat pieces , one boiled egg and potato. 

Pocket pinch is high but the biriyani is a must try out for.

Kabuliwala serves great biryani at what seems a pricey affair in the beginning but ends up giving amazing value for each penny spent. 

It's a delivery only joint serving a limited menu in Rajarhat and salt lake area. The menu is limited to varieties in biryani and phirni for those with sweetooth. Prices start from 450 and the team claims that the small portions serve a minimum of two people. 

But in my experience of a portion of shahi handi, the serving was huge. It could easily serve 4-5 people. The packaging was superb with provision of nice beetle plates, butter milk in earthen glass, tissue coins , toothpicks. Ultimately what matters is the taste of food which was simply amazing and I loved it to the core. Biryani was great and phirni was definitely one of the best I have ever had.

Overall an amazing experience.

Ordered ghost biriyani for two people as a casual friday lunch. Biriyani is too good for taste, very light. Quantity is sufficient for two people. But raita was not good at all. It was just plain water, the only below-average item in entire lunch. Hope they will improve the same, or will introduce pay per raita options. Special mention is firni, and everybody should try it. A good experience, and waiting for next time.

A place serving just biryanis and getting 4.5 is a big thing when we have places like Arsalsn and Aminia. This is a delivery joint which started with delivering to sector 5 areas....but after charging a nominal fee they agreed ro deliver in dum dum park and that too timely.
Now cominh to the food:
Biryani is light weight...not very oily or masaledaar. Also each biryani comes with 2 pieces of meat...be it chicken or mutton so that refuces the quantity of rice for which i deduct 0.5 else it would have been a perfect 5.
Biryani is served with butter milk in sn earthen pot so thats a wow.
Coming to the best part and thats the presentation. It could not have been better. Specially the wooden finish paper plates, tablet napkins to be dipped in water, perfect packaging in airctight packets, tooth picks etc.
JUST LOVED THE PACKAGING AND STAFF BEHAVIOUR. ONLY REQUEST IS TO INCREASE THE RICE PORTION IN ORDER TO MATCH WITH ARSALAN AND AMINIA SINCE PRICES ARE ALSO HIGH.

Had an awesome mutton biriyani from kabuliwala. I really liked their innovative packaging. The biriyani was sealed in a pouche. One plate of mutton biriyani consists of 2 pieces of perfectly cooked soft mutton, 1tasty  potato and 1 egg, accompained with butter milk, and a plate. One thing i really liked that they provide cute little towel tablets which are really innovative. Just pour some water and the tablets will become a small towel. I really wish the biriyani could be a little more spicy. Otherwise the biriyani was good.

Their Slogan says "Sinful Biriyani".... Having grown up in Kolkata with Biriyanis from Aminia, Nizam's, Shiraz, Arsalan, I was a bit sceptical about this new kid on the block. But when I got the deliveries for a House Party, I was first amazed by their packaging. We had ordered 7 Mutton Biriyanis which they packed into Handis & a Paper Pack. These were served with Butter Milk & Plates. We also ordered Bhuna Chicken & Firnis. Now coming to the taste, it is surely one of the best Biriyanis I've ever tasted. Light on oil & Rose Water smell, the rice & Mutton were perfectly cooked. The Firni also tasted Yummy. They also provide you with a small pack containing toothpick and a coin tissue, which when poured water upon opens up into a paper towel. What an innovation. Kudos to team Kabuliwala....

Got to know about Kabuliwala delivery from a friend.
Located near UNITECH Building gate 1,this place is only a delivery option restaurant.
The menu is limited to a few items but they know what they are selling and are good rather best at it.
Their menu is limited to biryani,chicken gravy and firni only.
Now coming to the food.we ordered 2 handi or Shahi Biryani and 2 chicken bhuna and firni.
I had taken delivery from almost all the major biryani giants of Kolkata but boss Kabuliwala is way better in presentation and class.
I would take a moment to appreciate the person who had the idea of selling biryani in a handi that too while delivering and the delivery items includes disposable plates , toothpicks and a awesome towel tablets which are initially a tablet and turn into a towel if you pour water in it.
Boss Dil Khush kar Dia presentation ne.
The biryani was light and quantity easy will fulfill belly of three .They too give a butter milk that too in a earthen glass and is a better option to the traditional raita with biryani.
The chicken bhuna was well cooked but please think of a better way to sent the gravy.
The firni was well balanced and inturn is one of the best I had after Indian restaurant.
Overall a 4.5, why were you Late to deliver today otherwise my review would have been a perfect 5.
Boss @arsalan and @aminia... They are young but if they surfice they might soon overtake you.
Advice to the management- please sent spoons and a better way to sent the bhuna next time. Keep up,will surely order next time.

Had always been a dadaboudi  biryani's fan.
Since the last few days was planning to have a plate of biryani from Kabuliwa.la
Now this is the best biryani in kolkata i can bet now. At first i thought this to be a bit expensive than any other outlet. But after recieving the delivery i can make it out why they would not charge that much. You can pay this much if you get this sort of quality.
They cost 750 rupees per handi which they say feeds 3 people but it actually feeds 4 people. It weighs 2kgs. It contains 3 egg,6 heavy pieces of mutton, and 3 aloo. 
They also provide you a disposable bay leaf plate and coin tissue , &  3 raita in earthen pots with each handi.
And it tastes heavenly.@
If u r in kolkata and u r a biryani lover like me,you should try this atleast once.

P.s no dining available ,only in hand delivery available and upto saltlake

To many of d bongs biriyani is not a food or dish , it's basically an emotion. Now the irony is, most of the food joint and restaurants including many big names of biriyani house, is not at all justifying this at all.

And a relief!!!!!! At last we got some one... Kabuliwala as they called it.

They are only available by home delivery. It they started there journey from the so called corporate sector food lovers stomach ( unitech / eco space area). Now they have spread their delivery to salt lake areas also. But only unitech area having delivery charge zero.

Now coming to the food:
__________________________
When you have only the home delivery option , generally you have nothing to tell in spite of food.

Okay hold on!!!!! Exception..

There presentation is the key factor here. It's not only eye catching , it's a complete package, enough to ensure that you get the dish hot.

Sahi ghost biriyani
____________________
3 pieces of ALU, 3 pieces of egg, 6 pieces of mutton in a clay pot, well covered by aluminium foil to server it hot.
With this 3 glass of Bhurani.
( Bhurani is basically a drink goes well with biriyani)
Along with 3 plates ( bio degradable plates)
Wet tissue capsules and tooth peak.

It's a complete package.

Now coming to the taste. : It's owssum. Well cooked mutton juicy pieces with soft grains of rice. No extra oil, very light weight biriyani. Superb.
Bhurani was not great but quite good.
Sufficient for 3 people.

Bhuna murg masala:
________________________

Very well cooked chicken pieces. It's tastes just owssum, going very well with biriyani. The gravy was that taste. 4 pieces of chicken.

Sufficient for 3 people.

It's a grand experience, to get such a classy biriyani.

All cost : 750+200 = 950.

To kabuliwala team :
______________________
 you guys are rocking. Just keep this quality and quantity. Many houses after having its name have degraded their quality.
You guys just superb. Cheers!!!!!!!!!!

Question to management
------------------------------------------
1. Is there any difference in taste between the sahi and rozana biriyani?
2. Can we see your outlet in near future?


To all:. Give it a try. U just can't miss it.....

Late night Biryani craving can be satisfied with this delivery only restaurant . We ordered Chicken Handi Biryani . In one handi biryani they give a food portion of rice with 3 pc of chicken and 3 boiled eggs. The taste of biryani was very good. They also provided plates and napkins which was well thought . 
I would surely again book biryani from here .

I had same trouble on 31st night when I went toll Unitech gate 1 to collect my order. But had to return empty handed after waiting for 35min. And whenever I was trying get to call it was either not reachable or was told by the operator that the order is on the way and I will be receiving in 5 min. And when I reached home at 9.30 pm I was informed that that person is waiting with my order this was 45 min when I left the place where I was supposed to our collection the order. 
I know that zomato is mainly for food. But felt that the service part also count when one go in for any order. Hence thought of sharing my experience. I will rate this resturant a 0 but since zomato doest not have 0 so had to opt for 1, for such a bad experience I had.

When I looked at their menu card and figured that each chicken Biryani costs more than what it would in a standard restaurant in Kolkata, I was pretty skeptical to order. But then, after reading the rave reviews and a little mental calculation later, I had a feeling this might just be worth the money. And I am glad I was proved right!

Unlike any delivery service, the packaging on these babies is perfect, A-class. The quality of packaging gave me more confidence on how the actual stuff stored inside might be like. Zip locked aluminium packets for the biryani, kulhad/bhand for the masala chaach, that neat plate that looked more organic than synthetic and last but not the least, the towel which I at first mistook for a mint mouth freshner. Now I know where all that restaurant like cost is going. Clearly, people are ready to pay if they get quality. Why doesn't every restaurant do this?

Coming to food, the biryani had ample amount of rice, just enough to fill a man's large tummy, 2 nicely done to perfection chicken pieces, one fillet and one leg piece, and a potato. I somehow got an extra potato which I enjoyed all the more. The biryani was not overpoweringly aromatic nor was it overtly oily. It has been about 3hrs since I had my lunch, I only felt sleepy for sometime, and no acidity at all. Hence a big thumbs up to the quality of the biryani.

0.5 taken away for the limited menu that offers only biryani, one salan and one dessert. Perhaps a limited menu is a sure shot route to great quality, but at least add a kabab  and soft drinks to make the ordering experience wholesome.

Delivery only restaurant .. Good name - Prompt Delivery - Only delays during peak times but they get to you by 45 mins ..

Coming down to their main preparation - The Murg Biriyani is very well cooked - A tad non spicy but it is a generic preparation to fit the need of people who would like to indulge in it everyday .. There were 2 well cooked tender pieces of Chicken .. One boiled egg and 1 boiled potato makes the overall dish enough for lunch or dinner .. 

They did not provide 'salan' with Biriyani but that is fine .. I do not understand why many restaurants do not provide Salan with Biriyani anymore .. Salan is a catalyst to the taste of Biriyani ..

Delivery was very professional .. Packaging was very good - Top notch .. 👍🏻

I would definitely try more items in their menu and then maybe I would make some edits to my rating and review ..

As of now this food joint can get a number of orders out of you .. ✔

One day suddenly in office canteen a group of folks have ordered some biriyani as office delivery and also we saw they were eating in nice plates. 
Out of curiosity we noted the name and ordered in a week time. 
I am a great biriyani lover . I taste biriyani in almost small and big restaurants in kol but i can guarantee kabuliwala serve you one of the tastiest biriyani in town. 
The packaging that they do while giving you the biriyani is another wow factor. 
Biriyani comes with two pieces of meat, egg and potato. The taste is superb with very less spice. 
They should start a restaurant which can easily do business more than any renowned biriyani shops. The price is reasonable too.

Ordered in our office to have lunch. The packaging and presentation of the food is excellent. We have ordered both mutton and chicken biryani for 2 and 3 people, but they packed it separately . Someone could find the biryani less salty and spicy. I also preferred little spicy which I think lacked in the biryani. The mutton/chicken pieces are  very good which comes with most favourite thing in Kolkata biryani 'The Potato' and with one boiled egg. The quantity was also very sufficient. The burhani given with that was not so good. But Firni was good. 
If you want to enjoy a hassle-free lunch/dinner with your friends or colleague, Kabuliwala is highly recommended. 

Food - 3.5

Well biryani was tasty enough to give it a try but that was not the best part. Best was Packaging, just mind blowing. Biryani, side dish and firni are the only options as of now, delivery only restaurant. Hopefully they will continue to serve like this after becoming more famous, which is not the case for most of the Kolkata based restaurants. Well try it at least once. I usually too lyadkhor to give review but this makes me to do so. :-)

I was introduced to Kabuliwala during an office gathering. The red packaging & the glass of complementary buttermilk impressed me initially but I was still skeptical about the taste. Then I carefully opened the packet & poured some rice & a big piece of potato on my plate. Trust me guys, the hot rice just melted in my mouth. It was light & non greasy, unlike the regular biriyani we find in other restaurants. And then I got more interested in exploring the thing further. The chicken pieces were super juicy & soft.

After that I became a loyal patron of Kabuliwala. Recently, I treated my colleagues with the sumptuous biriyani from Kabuliwala & I'm planning to celebrate my birthday with the same.

If you've ever read Tagore's Kabuliwala, you'll know why this biriyani outlet has been named after it. Yes, they both make you emotional in the end.

Love this place.  This is my second time ordering from kabuliwala and it never disappoints.  The service, packaging and the biryani very very nicely packed and good. It comes in a red ziplock bag written "sinfully good" so true!  the smell wow! Comes with 2 pieces of alu, chicken and one egg. The rice is long basmati rice.It is sufficient for 1 person.  They also give dahi in this small earthen pot which keeps it cool and spillproof (kudos to the delivery guy for delivering it nicely)  and a plastic plate. The prices are a tad high. They have offers going on most of the time. But the food is worth it.  Tip: order before the time stated because it gets over quickly.

I became a huge fan of their Biryani after the first experience, about 2 weeks back, hence I ordered from them for dinner. I ordered a Mutton Biryani along with a gosht curry, it was just as I expected it to be. Absolutely delicious;their biryani, as mentioned from my previous experience was very subtle and smooth in taste. The Mutton pieces were well sized and was very succulent. The portions of rice was spot on as 5 of us had eaten the meal properly without facing any kind of shortage. Overall, a great experience. Kudos to the management of Kabuliwala for giving us another great experience of food and memories.

Indulgence to the sinful Biryani is a must for all biryani lovers. We ordered Shahi Murg Biryani and Rozana Gosht Biryani to our office on 6th Jan.2017 The order delivered 15 mins late and that's not a big deal. The packaging is wonderful, eco friendly. The coconut tree plates give us extremely royal feeling along with the Ghol in earthen glass. We missed earthen pot because of heavy rushes on Fridays. Coming to the Biryani it was wonderfully delicious. It wasn't oily or spicy rather a healthy one. The taste was amazing. The added attraction was the tablet coin tissue that opens up on placing in water. The Ghol was very digestive.

It was flawless and praiseworthy except one problem. The presence of complementary salads or even in the menu would have been much better.

Great food  served well. Biriyanis were extremely nice, non oily and less on spices compared to the likes of Arsalan. On special request they arranged to serve Shahi Gosht Biriyani for Friday lunch that too in their Signature Clay Handi. Side dish lacked texture and gravy. Other wise taste wise was nice. Firni was so so.
Nice touch with the coin tissues but would like to request to include disposable spatula to serve biriyani from handi which consists of Three people.

The quality is very very good.  Specially the GOSHT  Biryani. Very less oil and its very lite. Though the Chicken veriant is  a bit, just a bit more rich. 
The quality of meat is superior and better than the rice. Less of fat and more of meat for the money. Ideal for mass orders. The delivery is fast. The Bhuna Murg masala is tasty but had they served them in container rather than sachets it would have saved some gravy. Over all experience is very very good and I highly recommend  his.  I wish they spread their delivery circle. Well done #kabuliwala keep it up.

This biriyani just made the top of my list. It's really a sin if you hadn't tried it yet.

We ordered biriyani for our team lunch at our office and Kabuliwala provided an impeccable service, starting from the on time delivery to the sinful taste of their biriyani. To be true it was an awesome experience - from opening their lovely packaging till having the last morsels of the brilliant food they provided.

I will put it out there for the guys who haven't tried it yet - do so immediately !! Also its nice that they think about the environment as well because their total packaging is eco friendly - kudos for that Kabuliwala.

Great food, lovely eco friendly packaging and low pocket pinch - what more can you ask for. Just have their biriyani and feel the awesomeness.

Looking forward to try their biriyani again soon.

Move over Arsalan, move over Aminia! Kabuliwala offers the tastiest biryani in Kolkata. It's light and less oily and the chicken pieces just melt in mouth. It's value for money and much more reasonable than other food chains (compared to the quantity they offer) 
Their packaging is interesting and delivery is quick. 
A refreshing addition to New Town! :)

This is definitely the best in Kolkata. Oudh comes close though it's oil levels are higher. Rest of the folks nowhere in horizon. Next time will be keen to taste the sides. Recently we had a dinner in Dum Pukht, Delhi. I would say this stuff is near about that space. Obviously DP one is very rich in fragrance and palette. But in anesthetics it is comparable. And the price difference between the two is obviously enormous...

I say this with biryani eating experience across the country in the best of places . From Kerala to kashmir...

The only-delivery joint gets it bang on in every department- taste, quantity and packaging. The Rosana Mutton Biryani comes with two soft, succulent Mutton pieces, a potato (not the oversized, hard one, but an eatable sized one that's easy to bite into!) and an egg. The flavourful rice is super light, and not oily. What I loved was that the biryani does not give you the heavy feeling in the stomach. We were also pleasantly surprised with the Burhani, the mint-yoghurt drink that comes included with the Biryani. Kabuliwala makes sure that you have no messy cleaning up to do, they provide sturdy plates, and even a packet of tissues!! 
If you are planning to host a house party in  Salt Lake, this is the place you should call! 
The only tiny minus point in a review of so many positives is that it needs to work on its delivery.

I tried the biriyani first time today. The taste was awesomely yummy and i loved it since i always like a biriyani which wont be much heavy. The biriyani is light with less spices and the leg piece in every packet adds up a cherry on the cake. The butter milk provided was nice too. They also give you wooden plates so that you can have the biriyani outdoors too. The last but not the least is the coin tissue which I loved playing with. :P Overall rating is 5 out of 5.

Enticed by the reviews I ordered a Veg Rozana biryani that came in good quantity and  good packaging(both very important or whatever). But the goodness ended there only. The biryani didn't even came close to tasting like a biryani, the dish could be best described as some duped version of veg Pulao! Although the quality of materials used looked nice(lots of dry fruits and paneer,less oil,blah blah. okay fine!) but I order food for taste more than any other aspect and with Kabuliwala I am hugely disappointed when it comes to taste. Sinful biryani, as they themselves say, literally! Veg walon zara sambhaal k

Was thinking of ordering biryani from this chain for quite some time, after seeing the good reviews. Finally had an opportunity today to enjoy the 'sinful' biryani. 
And it was definitely 'Foodilicious'! It did not come as a surprise that the biryani was superb, very well prepared indeed, light yet very tasty with 2 juicy chicken pieces, 1 egg and potato, because of the Zomato ratings and reviews.
The plates provided were good too with the raita type drink ending the nice lunch on a almost empty 30th Dec office cafeteria.
Overall, the quality of biryani was very good, and for a foodie like me, the quantity could have been a bit better :P Will surely order for more next time!

One request to the founder or manager of the chain - Please deliver in other parts of the city as well. I live in Kasba, Ruby Hospital Area, and would definitely like to order such good biryani more often.

Light, fragrant biriyani with a subtle flavor of ghee taking it to the next level. Gorgeous portions. Nice work with the complementary Burhani. And really innovative packaging, comes with everything, from plates to toothpicks, even hand towels. 

Delivery got a bit late because of Christmas rush but polite reception all the same and good, efficient service overall.

Kabuliwala delivers an experience. And it is the answer to everything that is wrong with "multi-cuisine" restaurants. It ONLY has biryani, gravy, and firni on its menu. They ran out of firni the day I ordered, but no complains considering the biryani and gravy were perrrrfect. 2 succulent large pieces of mutton in each portion with ample rice, succulent chicken in the gravy, and the chaas was amazing! They also send plates, toothpick, and water-expandable napkins. Biryani and gravy came neatly packed in foil zip pouches and the chaas in nice little mud glasses. Lovely experience.

We ordered lunch at our office in sector 5.
Rozana murg biriyani, bhuna murg, rozana veg biriyani.
I have to admit that this is one of the best biriyani ive ever had, both chicken and veg biriyani were awesome. The quantity of one biriyani is more than enough for two starving adults. The bhuna murg was also outstanding. Overall i would like to mention that the food was very light and the quality was very good. There whole concept of packaging was innovative. Firni was sold out so couldn't try it. Will suggest all to place the order atleast 1.5 hrs before your meal time coz they have huge rush.
Two suggestions from my side
1) please make thw order placing part seamless.
2) please make the chicken pieces in the biriyani a little more soft and tender.

Now they have stopped giving the discount so the bill was 1500. They accept payment by cash/card/sodexo

I had ordered thrice , once in office and twice in home ,everytime Chicken Biryani . Now coming to the Biryani it is really sinful . Two juicy tender pieces of Chicken accompanied by one Fine round Potato and one egg .The quality of rice is superb and I can bet U will not feel any trouble after galloping a good amount of rice , It is so light yet tasty . Now to pricing ,they are giving 20% off for now but if they keep the same price as it is,this is d next big food sensation in Kolkata like WOW momo .160 rs on AVG for a pack of Chicken Biryani and you are getting it at your doorstep and obvio Cashless :P

The phrase 'best biriyani in Kolkata' is often tossed around without much thought. While it's unfair to crown this as the best biriyani place in Kolkata without trying out the rest, Kabuliwala's gosht biriyani was definitely the best I had in recent times. The mutton pieces were generously big and they were succulent and soft. The rice was flavorful without being too oily. The delivery joint also pays close attention to detail as everything comes neatly packed in aluminum foil bags. The biriyani includes a glass of buttermilk and they pack in coin paper toils and toothpicks. Deducting 1 star because I didn't get the firni I ordered and they simply deducted the cost from the bill without informing me.

Ordered briyani and a chicken dish. The packaging was amazing. Had to add extra points just for that. Another good thing was about the delivery boy who refused to take tip. I have seen this happen only at barbecue nation. The food was good but not substantial. Chicken inside the briyani was quite dry and powdery instead of juicy and succulent. But then again I have found very few restaurants being able to pull up this trick.

New to the market, but impressive equally. Price- bearable, quality- lajawaab, service- brilliant, arrangement- mind blowing. In total a brilliant package by the new innovator. Bingo.👌😎
Only con- not suitable for a single person.
P.S- please come up with deliveries around south Kolkata.

This is my first review in Zomato. Actually I opened the zomato account just to write the review. And I am not a paid reviewer. This is my first order from Kabuliwala too.
I love biriyani. I have tried several different brands and types available in Kokata, Hyderabad and US(mainly NY, NJ and GA). I don't want to compare this with others, as I think each one is unique in its own style, but this will be definitely a memorable experience.
After hearing the name from one of my coworker today, I read several reviews about Kabuliwala here in Zomato and could not resist to taste the biriyani firsthand. I ordered 1 Shahi Ghost Biriyani and 1 Murg mashala. The amount they gave was good enough for 4 people. With 20% discount, the final amount was 760 which means less than 200 per head. Not a bad deal,considering the quality of the food. The biriyani is, as mentioned by others, not greasy and taste is really good. Meat peices or "Boti"s are tender and full of taste. Chicken curry was very tasty as well. Thanks for the complimentary burhanis, palm tree leave plates,coin towel and toothpicks. The packaging is no doubt excellent.
I can only wish for Kabuliwala to grow as a big brand by maintaining the quality and service. They should seriously start thinking to expand their coverage area and/or opening branches in south Kolkata. That will bring tough time ahead for the other so called big names. All the best for Kabuliwala.
Don't think much and just give an order. You can thank me later ;-)

This isn't biryani, this is an experience to cherish!
I'm not a biryani-aficianado but this biryani appealed to me much more than the over-hyped ones of Arsalan or Aminia. The mutton biryani was light and tasty and not soaking in oil unlike most places and it came with not one, but 2 pieces of juicy mutton and an egg! There was a drink- burhani- which tasted like a raita- only infinitely better and the chicken curry was heavenly. The only thing that prevented me from giving a perfect score was the fact that the chicken gravy had more oil than gravy so I hope the management looks into this asap. Extra brownie points due to the fact that the biryani comes with a zip pouch because the quantity is enormous and one can easily pack some for later. Also loved the concept of the coin towel..!
Undoubtedly looking forward to many more handis being delivered in the near future. Also, hoping that they soon start an outlet for seating/take-away.

I am overwhelmed by not only the taste but also the overall presentation...the packaging,the plates and the tissues..they brought innovation to almost every little detail that one can think of..we had ordered the special combo of biriyani which comes with burhani for 30 odd people...the chicken/mutton pieces were soft and succulent which is a huge plus..the burhani was actually damn amazing..and the chicken side dish too tasted good but it would have been better if it had a lil less oil..there was more oil than the gravy
Overall experience was good
Is highly recommended!

Definitely one of the best biryani I've had in Kolkata. Surely the best packing arrangement of food I've seen in Kolkata. This delivery only restaurant is an absolute delight. One plate of biryani is more than sufficient for two people, the quality is outstanding and the best thing is it's not as oily as compared to some of the mughlai restaurants and still tastes as good as them. Also had their bhuna murg masala which was an absolute delight for my taste buds.

Tried Shahi murg biriyani with office collegues.
Taste was awesome,Quantity was more than enough.
Raita served with biriyani was too good.
Package was also damn good.
Biriyani in Clay handi,plates,soap was served in our office as they don't have seating options available.
Price was not high at all, as compared to others.

Fantastic food.. Ordered Shahi gosht biryani, rozana murgh biryani and firnis.. All the dishes were finger licking. The gosht biryani had 6 big mutton pieces, 3 eggs and 2 potato.. The firnis were such fine stuff too. The packaging was innovative and the dishes were eco-friendly ones. The delivery boy goofed it up a little and we had to keep on calling them. But then the food was so  good, I think we can overlook that part. A big thumbs up.

Kabuliwala gave a free biryani treat at my office thanks for that first of all. Biryani is not oily like other so called famous biryani restaurants. The amount of oil dalda or animal fat used in biryani can be judged by the time taken to wash off your hand , Kabuliwala biryani is light and tastes way better than others. It is so not oily that you wont have a bad burp and its good to your stomach which makes me think that quality is Kabuliwala's prime focus and they are driven by it.

I was initially a bit sceptical about trying out a new brand (my tastes are quite traditional when it comes to Calcutta biryani), but Kabuliwala's leaflet looked rather enticing.

After a quick headcount, I gave them a call, only to be courteously guided through the ordering process - no complaints there. I ended up ordering a Shahi Gosht biryani and a Rozana Gosht biryani (ample food for 3+2 big-appetite servings), along with a full plate of Bhuna Murg Masala. The gentleman on the phone suggested that we tried their firni, so we ordered five of those as well.

The delivery was around 5 minutes late, but they had been nice enough to call and inform us about that. An interesting fact is that the delivery person politely refused the tip I was offering him; it's company policy, he said. He accepted payment by card (phew!) and was extremely courteous throughout the delivery process.

And then the package arrived. The word 'surprise' doesn't cover it - we were genuinely awestruck at the amount of goodies coming out of the delivery bag! The Shahi biryani came in an earthen handi (which my friend intends to use as decor later), while the Rozana was packaged in an elegant red bag. The overall look was very classy and the aroma was... oooh... pukka, quality Calcutta biryani.

That's not where it ends. The package also had a (complimentary!) traditional drink called Burhani (served in nice little clay jars), the firni bowls and a small yellow envelope with toothpicks and what looked like round bits of thermocol. Overleaf, the envelope had instructions for using the round tablets - when water is added, the tablets become tissues! We were so excited with this item that we actually used one of them BEFORE the meal!!

Just as we were about to bring out plates to serve ourselves, someone noticed that Kabuliwala had even taken care of that! This was a genuine surprise - they give complimentary areca leaf plates with the package! I have some experience with areca (betel nut or supari) trees, and this is a wonderful, biodegradable solution that Kabuliwala has come up with. In fact, they seem to have kept the eco-sustainable angle at the core of their packaging.

Finally, on to the food itself. They've seriously lived up to their promise - the biryani is full of flavour, yet not overwhelmingly so. I couldn't find any trace of attar, and the rice grains were light and long. I'm very picky/critical about my biryani, and this was exceptional stuff! The meat is genuinely the softest I've had in years, and is also loaded just right with flavours. And you get two pieces of meat (unlike every other place, at the price), which is brilliant. The Bhuna was lovely, too, and was a nice complement to the biryani. Succulent is indeed the correct word in this instance, as has been used in their literature.

While my friends loved the Burhani, I wasn't a huge fan - simply because I don't like that kind of taste anyway. But I'm the only one (of five) who didn't like it, so I'll discount that. It seemed to be an instant hit with the others, which is exceptional for a non-alcoholic drink.

Even the firni was just right - not too sweet, but just right. I could feel the individual nut pieces, which added to the texture.

At my age, I usually experience some acidity after a hearty meal like this, but not this time! I'm assuming the ingredients they've used are somehow better than what other joints use.

Overall, they've nailed it. To offer this quality, this volume and all these freebies at this price is exceptional. The taste is spot-on - this is EXACTLY what Calcutta biryani should be like. I hope they expand to the rest of the city soon, so more people can experience it. They have no idea what they're missing out on!

A good looking pamphlet lying on the footpath leading to DLF2 caught my attention one day 

But apart from the words Kabuliwala & Sinful Biryani couldn't gather anything in any way

Then after a few weeks, fortunately, I was offered a pamphlet

Aha..so pricey everything was but the description too looked great

In the middle of work kept postponing the task to check the reviews in Zomato

But finally when I happened to check it, the reaction was like 'O Ma go'

This was meant to be tried, to be tasted, to be experienced, something so new

And finally I dared to order Rozana Veg Biryani for which there was no review

When the sealed packets were opened, with the aroma flowed happiness

Huge quantity, delicious taste, the royal feel of oodles of ghee, how to express

The accompanying Kaju-Kishmish, Paneer, Peas, Potato filled the heart & stomach to the brim

Even though they forgot to give Burhani, the delight didn't dim

Never thought that a Veg Biryani would steal the heart like this

Three cheers to Kabuliwala, Super Success for you, we all wish
 :)

This is located somewhere in Rajarhaat and they only have Delivery option available. If you are looking to have biriyani for any get togethers / celebrations in office near Rajarhaat, this would be your best option going by my one time experience :)

They serve in handi's so two handi's will be sufficient for 5 - 6 peoples. We ordered Shahi Murg Biriyani only. The clay pots were not just any clay pots but Kabuliwala was carved into it. Also they served Raita in clay glasses and toothpicks and tissues. What I am trying to convey here is the packaging is excellent and I give kudos to the brain behind the same.

Now the most important thing - The food - Biriyani was served with two potatoes, 2 eggs and 6 pieces of chicken which were of standard sizes and the Biriyani is awesome - light and tastes good.

So keep it up guys and I am sure your orders are only going to increase.

Undoubtedly among the best biriyani in town, right there with Arsalan. The mutton was perfectly soft, and so was the potato. The Shahi Mutton Biriyani comes with 6 decent size pieces.

The packaging was what made it outstanding. The handi was of course expected. But the Zip Lock containers for the bhuna gosht and the rozana biriyani was really something I have never seen in even far classier places. And the disposable plates also added a nice touch.

Finally the service was punctual and the delivery person came with a card swipe machine, which is of great help during this period of cash crunch

One of the best option for biriyani lovers. They are operating from someplace around Rajarhat and only delivery option  is there. 
Ordered shahi murg and shahi gosht biriyani each divided into 4 packets. Still now everyone knows they does a superb packing. That's true!!! They will surely impress you with great packing and everything from plates to bag that they use are eco friendly. Kudos to them for that.
Now the most important part food.
Both the biriyanis are great. Perfect taste and aroma. No greasy feeling. Full marks. 3packets got 2 chunks of meat and one potato. My packet was the unluckiest one as they missed to put the potato in that one. 
Any ways if you are around their delivery radar do order from them. You wont be disappointed!!
Cheers!!!!

After getting positive feedback about this joint from people, last week we decided to give it a try for one of our colleague's bachelor treat !

And we proved no wrong ! Starting from the packaging (includes nicely packed individual biriyani portion, burhani in a clay glass, degradable plates, coin towels, toothpick), the taste, quantity, quality everything impressed us a lot !! 

We ordered rozana gosht biriyani, rozana murg biriyani and one chicken side dish.. quantity of one plate biriyani is huge and actually served two people very well. Chicken side dish was also very palatable. Only minus point I felt is few of the meat pieces were a bit chewy. Otherwise taste was great and it was less spicy.

Cost wise it's at per with other famous biriyani joints. We got the 20℅ discount as the inaugural offer.

Just we missed the claypot handi for the biriyani which they told is served for evening orders.. 

Overall the first experience with kabuliwala will surely make us go for it once more soon !

Suddenly came across a leaflet lying on my odc desk, probably given to me by any leaflet distributor but never paid any attention. As me n 2 of my colleagues were sitting idle on a lazy saturday afternoon we decided to order as they were giving 20% off. They had a centre near unitech.

They assured that they would deliver within 20 min n they did that. Best part was they carry a swipe machine, which was a saviour during this note crisis. The delivery boy was very polite.

Now coming to the packaging, i have never seen such packaging in my life. we ordered Shahi Murgh biriyani and 0.5 rozana murgh biriyani(prescribed by them). It was a large clay hundi covered with aluminium foil, 0.5 was in a sealed packet, fancy plates, chilled burhani as complement( which didn't spill at all), coin towel, toothpick, everything they provided. Coin towel was a good idea.

Coming to the food. It was just awesome,. Tender chicken pieces (all were large), soft aloo, nice quantity of rice all were great. We were 3 hungry male monsters and we had more than enough. 

This outlet will soon give a competition to outlets like arsalan, aminia which is popular in rajarhat area.Very Nice experience. Keep it up guys.

I am writing this review after our second order from Kabuliwala.

First time we got a leaflet from outside of the office and coincidentally we were planning for a team lunch. You can say 'luckily' we got that leaflet and without wasting any seconds, we decided to call them and gave an order for 14 members. It was delightful serve from them and we were amused with the decoration and the taste of the food. We ordered all kinds of biryanis, chicken, mutton and veg all are with excellent taste.... #Thanks for making our 1st team lunch memorable.

On the second time, I ordered for my family. I wanted to give my parents surprise and they really surprised with the delivered food items.

Kabuliwala is a delivery only place. We have ordered few days back and the service was excellent.

First, they were very kind to understand and tweak the order a bit as per my requirements. Also they have proactively given us a promotional offer which we did not know about. Then the delivery was within the promised time.

The packaging was very neat and it came with extra cups of burhani raita as well. They did some good branding here.

We have ordered egg biriyani. In terms of taste and quality of the food, they can compete with any of the established Biriyani houses in Kolkata.

They are a delivery only outlet, and most probably, they must be located very close to the Unitech facility as they were spot on in the time they promised for their delivery.

We were lucky to tread onto one of their delivery boys and managed the leaflet, when they had a 20% discount and we do not regret it and neither would anybody.

Starting off with the delivery. They server burhani in earthen pots, and even after travelling, they did not spill and the boy was extremely well mannered and patient.

To the packaging, they were unique and very different. They come in zip-lock packets, lined with aluminium, ensuring, that u can save the leftovers if u are full and want to eat them later. The serve plates, made out of fine bamboo, and that was an added bonus. They were spot on with the quantity that they mentioned, and it does weigh to that amount. For tissues, they provided us with tissue tablets, which was a new experience for us and definitely worth it. And to top it all, they provided us the food in bags, and not on plastic, giving the idea that they consider the Eco friendliness as well. That definitely needs some brownie points.

Coming to the food, they served us with ample amounts, enough to last 3 instead of two and that did make us full. The sizes of the chicken were huge and the choices were brilliant, as they did not have much bones in them. The biriyani was light, correct and exact amount of spices and oil and ghee, and it did not result in slippery hands.

We went for 2 portions each of the rozana murgh and gosht biriyani and they were absolutely outstanding. The rozana bhuna murgh and gosht masala, was also brilliantly cooked in ghee and spices and inspite of having a tad little bit of excess oil, it did taste amazing. the burhani, nothing spectacular, but was still nice to team up with the biriyani

They would have a monopoly and rule the rajarhat area if they continue to work like this and provide such quality. WOuld love to visit them, from where they operate and thank the chefs defintiely, if possible

Ordered for delivery twice from office since this  one do not have any seating arrangement and was it was quite a pleasant experience both the occasions. First of all, the price is extremely reasonable for the amount of food they provide. Even after that they are offering a 20% discount keeping both the quality & quantity at the same mark which is just amazing. The delivery on both days was within 30 mins as promised, the packaging unique as well as great. For the Shahi Biryani they provide in a clay pot (handi), a huge amount of rice along with 6pcs of chickens, 2 eggs and 2 potatoes. It can easily fill 3 people of any appetite ;-)Quality of the rice and generous amount of chickens made our lunch delightful. Surely one of the top in "Value for money" biriyanis in Kolkata. Packaging for the Rozana Biryani comes in 2 sealed pouches which makes it very easy to share between 2 people, also in case of leftovers you can just zip it and take home! A very innovative and customer friendly idea. Hats off!Finally comes the tissue papers (Best way to finish a meal). They provide 2 tissues punched like tablets :D Any one using them for the first time would be confused surely as this is a new one. Just put the tablets in water and it expands to a wet tissue ;-)Hoping to see (read: eat) more of Kabuliwala if they continue keeping the standard and quantity.

Last week we ordered biryani from kabuliwala. However for some reason they could not deliver. So, they called us and apologised for the fact and told us that they would serve our order to us as a compliment. We told them just to deliver the biryani on friday and on time and we would pay the bill, we do not need it as a complementary one. When they delivered they did not take a single rupee from us. We insisted a lot, but they did not take the money. We insisted the deliver to take some tip, again he did not accept it. This was a nice gesture from them. Now comes the main part. The packaging in particular was brilliantly done. Most of the items could be recycled. The food in particular was really nice. The rozana mutton biryani we ordered served 2 person. It contained 4 mutton pieces 2 potatoes and rice had perfect amount of spice. Quantity was perfect for two person, tasted brilliant. I would recommend Kabuliwala to everyone. Try them out , they won't disappoint you. Hi 5 from us. Good going guys. Carry on the good work.

This review is coming in late but better late then never.

So we had ordered 2 portions of rozana gosht biryani around 2:30 pm in the afternoon. The order reached right on time as promised. The packing was really impressive. One of its kind in Kolkata. The biryani was fresh and fragnant. Pieces of chicken were sizeable and really tasty. Brownie points for the burhani which was complimentary. Overall  the quality of food was really good and so was the ordering experience. Kudos to the Kabuliwala team and wish them all the best. Looking forward to ordering more. :)

Don't Bank on this as last resort!!!
Ordered today at 6 pm for delivery at 7 in my office..the lady who took the order confirmed mutton was available..7 pm came and gone and after 15 minutes I called again to be told that they can not fulfill the order as mutton is finished and the lady did not know so!!!
Now how come she is eligible to take order when she does not know the inventory condition and even so they waited for my call to tell me that!!
Lessons learnt - always keep plan b with this restaurant both for new town residents and people like me who have committed home to carry 'divine' Biriyani !!
With delivery only joints.. expected better professionalism ..
Please note I have not tasted and comment on the quality and I was offered chicken after 10 minutes of order cancellation but for me one day'ss wait is enough when arsalan/aminia is on the way with their jannat taste🙂@

Best part of the biryani is that very less oil and scent was used. The packing was excellent. They use reseal packs for biriyani and side dishes which keeps the food warm if you are taking in small portions.  Also it is really convenient in case any food in left over.  The surprising part was at the end where dry towels were given the shape of a tablet and it only unfold when soaked in water.

Okay, I ordered Rozana Murg Biryani few days back and just want to tell everyone, "I simply enjoyed it a loooooot". It was fun to have something extraordinary, I mean the packaging was super awesome. I have never seen packaging like this before which also includes toothpicks and Towel, Yes! the best part was the Towel. :D

Let's come to the food: 
It was super tasty and light. They don't use vegetable oil or something like that, I guess they use pure gawa ghee for the preparation because after you finish eating it doesn't feel sticky to your hands.

Quantity:
The quantity was huge. 1 Rozana Murg Biryani For two people - It's enough. 

Overall it's a 10/10 experience and good food.

This is a delivery only restaurant; so nothing about interiors and stuff. 

It took quite a while before I got the call from the delivery guy, asking me to receive the food. The packing was excellent. They use  reseal packs for biriyani and side dishes which is really convenient in case any food is left over. 

There was a complimentary drink to start with. It was basically a modified form of Ghondhoraaj Ghol and it tasted pretty good. Then coming to the main course. The biriyani was mindblowing. It was very sumptous and good in quantity which went very well with our hungry group. There were two pieces of juicy mutton in each plate which was absolutely amazing. We had also ordered for Bhuna Chicken Masala which was such a delight as well. The gravy was very rich yet not at all pungent and tasted absolutely fabulous. 

As I already mentioned, our hungry group was extremely satisfied with the food. Fingers crossed for the next order.

Rajarhat's only home delivering biriyani service. They do not have a flagship store. The outlet operates probably from a home and does only home delivery! The biriyani is light not greasy at all. Quantity and quality is excellent. The prices are perfect. The packaging needs a special mention. The food served is hot. The burhani is complimentary and tastes excellent. We had also opted for desserts, phirni, recommended!

Perfect in presentation , so beautifully thoughtful and creative , great customer service, right from the person taking the order , to the delivery before schedule, and with a smile. Packaging simply perfect (please don't change this as this will be your USP in a long time). As a first trial, I ordered for Rozanna Ghost biriyani and I wasn't disappointed. Mutton just melts in the mouth, not spicy at all but yes a little bit oily though( less compared to others). Quantity is enough for 3 easily. Great to order for a party in the office or at home ! Well done!

This was the first time, we ordered from Kubuliwala and must say the name is thoroughly  justified. The 'sinful' briyani was excellent in taste and suffice in quantity. No complaints there at all. Now comes the fun part, the whole package consists of two bamboo leaves plates, two complimentary chaanch , which were diligently prepared; apart from them, they gave a small envelope that consists of 2 toothpicks and 2 coin-tissue. Well, the coin tissues were completely a surprise - a coin that magically turns into a wipe with little touch of water. Well-planned and well managed service. We got our order in just 15 minutes which they promised to take about 25 minutes. Never got any order delivered before time, so that's added score in 'kabuliwalas' favor. No doubt, this is our favorite choice now for any gathering and team parties. 

Thanks Kabuliwala, you really fulfill wishes by your sinful red bags. :)

I am putting this review after my second order from Kabuliwala. Now, if I tell you that I am satisfied with their service, food quality & quantity and value for money; I would be lying. My feeling is something more than that. 

First thing first, The Food: They are recognized as a Biriyani joint that provides only delivery around New Town area. They tag themselves as ‘Sinful Biriyani’. How apt it is!! I can continue with the Sin of having their biriyani forever. Succulent pieces of Gosht (or Murg) pieces mixed with flavored biriyani rice will directly give you some kind of Royal feel. No doubt, their biriyani is lip-smacking. Their side dish of Bhuna Murg/Gosht is blissful too. They slow cook this items which gives them a flavorful aroma & perfect to take with their Biriyani. The rozana biriyani items (having 4 pieces of chicken/mutton & 2 pieces of Aloo) are enough to serve 2 hungry souls. For 6, you can order for a Shahi version of it (which contains 6 meat pieces, 2 Aloo & 2 eggs). A point of notion, they do not serve this Shahi version during lunch time. Now, with all of their Biriyani items comes a complimentary drink named ‘Burhani’. It’s a thicker & masaledaar version of Butter milk. This goes well with the Biriyani too. The prices are proper & you get total value for money for the food. Verdict: If you stay/ have office anywhere in Newtown; do try their Biriyani at least once. I am pretty much confident that, next time onwards, you may not opt for Arsalan or Aminia when you would think about ordering Biriyani.

Next is The Packaging: Without doubt, they are the clear winner here. I have seldom found a food joint who can be a competitor for them on this regard. The shahi version of the Biriyani comes in clay handi whereas the rozana ones in sealed aluminum foils. The Burhani comes in clay glasses. Each of the items are packed with perfection. Now, coming to the x-factor of packaging, they provide plates, toothpick & paper napkin. The plates are made of tough plastic like material but the texture gives you a feel of tree bark/leaves. The napkins come as tablets. You have to unwrap it for a proper use. I could simply say, packaging is their USP.

Finally, The service: The first time we placed the order, the service was prompt & on time. The second time they failed miserably. The delivery boy came 30 minutes late than the scheduled delivery time. We were furious with the Service. We complained over the phone for the same. They were attentive & apologetic for the bad service. Now, on our surprise, they offered the full meal as complementary. So, it was free of cost. We thought of never ordering from this joint again. But, the good behavior & showcase of goodwill will make us go back to the joint again & again. Thanks Kabuliwala. We are impressed on your response on receiving a complaint. Extra .5 points for the same.

On the whole, keeping all aspects in mind, I rate them the ‘Best Biriyani Joint in Newtown’ when it comes to delivering food. We really appreciate the effort & the good work. Keep it up.

P.S: After my 3rd order, I am deducting some points for super slow delivery. My 2nd & 3rd order reached 30 mins late. So, planning to order 30 mins before next time onwards, just to check if they reach on time.

Delivery - 9 on 10

Packaging - 10 on 10 (Impressive, Innovative)

Aroma - 10 on 10

Quantity - 10 on 10

Price - Very Reasonable

I ordered it for the 1st time after seeing the reviews, and i must say the food was awesome. The chicken pieces was exactly the way it should be  for Briyani. The aroma was well balanced, the rice was cooked finely with Chicken pieces. The Burhani was nicely prepared with curd and spices. Quantity was sufficient for two people. The two thing which i would like to suggest to  Kabuliwala is  to improve a little more is the  delivery time and the quality of rice used. Overall experience was impressive and i must say i would love to try Bhuna Murg Masala & Kesar Firni once and Murg Briyani again and again.

Redefining what " Home Delivery " Joints should be all about ...  

Service : Took about 45 minutes to deliver the food to my place . But the boy was very well mannered and quickly assembled the packages in a bag along with the bill . 
  
Packaging :  The reason why I  am making a special point about this is because " I've never seen packaging this beautiful " . They actually focused their attention on the one thing 99% of restaurants ignore . Beautiful Red sealed packets with a matte finish . Not only this , the boy even added plates in the carry bag !! The plates were made from some sort of a tree's bark . It was so beautiful and strong yet flexible . Last but not the least I spotted 2 white tablets in a small packet . Looked like  over sized peppermints but when i took it apart it was a couple of Napkins  :) Innovation was at it's peak . 

Food : A handful of unique Biriyanis , barely a one page menu !   Ordered the Rozana Murg Biriyani as they had run out of the other items ! Dussehra demand was too much i guess . After cutting open the packets , the Biriyani flowed over and it was very well made . Very aromatic  . If i were to rate just the food I would say it would come in my " top 3 Biriyanis " . The burhani didn't appeal to me quite that much , it was just ok .  There were 4 pieces of Chicken , 3 pieces of aloo alongside it. 

Cost for 2 : 300/- plus 

Final Conclusion : Extremely affordable ,  excellent packaging ,  ample quantity . I mean what else could one ask for !!  This is my preferred place from now on .  They may be new in the food delivery scene in New Town but it won't take them long to attain monopoly if they continue doing what they do . Just the packaging itself  will bring a wide smile to our face .

Will try and make my review short after trying biriyani everywhere else in Kolkata. Arsalan, Oudh, Zamzam, Great Indian resturant, etc. Here I go (From a hardcore Biriyani Freak) -

Delivery - 10 on 10
Packaging - 10 on 10 (Impressive, Innovative, Eco friendly)
Aroma - 10 on 10
Quantity - 10 on 10
Price - Very Reasonable
Quality - 10 on 10. So perfectly cooked, Mutton has the same reaction of a butter, Yes it simply melts. Pieces were full of flesh and not bones. Biriyani had the perfect blend of herbs and spices and to be honest I didn't have to use liquid hand wash to clean my hand it was so less oily. And the Taste of the biriyani is simply mesmerising.

Overall - 10 on 10 - KICKASS BIRIYANI ! Kudos to the management for perfectly getting almost everything right.

Kabuliwala is spot on!!

I ordered 2 murg rozanas, 1 murg bhuna masala, and 2 firnis. I got them delivered at work, so by the time i got home it was already more than a couple of hours later. I don't know if it's because of the packaging (awesome resealable packets), the food was all quite warm when I plated them. And the quantity is fantastic, we actually had plenty left over, and that's something in a foodie household like mine. 

The biryani tasted fabulous. It's tough to come by this dish in a lighter avatar while maintaining the taste, and Kabuliwala has certainly hit that elusive sweet spot. Low on oil, that hint of ghee and a perfect seasoning of spices. The balance in this dish is immaculate, all across aroma, look and taste. Oh, and did I mention the soft, super tasty pieces of chicken and aloo in the biryani?

The bhuna masala, to put it simply, is to die for. It's an explosion on your tastebuds. 

The firni was perfect for me, who isn't too fond of sweet dishes. Not too sweet and not bland either. The burhani was just fantastic. 

I must mention this, I felt kabuliwala is catering to all palates. Me and my parents have very different preferences, they dig spicy food and have a ginormous sweet tooth, and I generally prefer bland tastes. And all the dishes appealed to us equally. 

Yes, even to Sandy, my terminally ill furbaby. She has been refusing all food the last few days, and was all ravenous as soon as I opened the packets. Thanks guys!!!

Now to be fair, there is a single downside. The food arrived separately, and I felt the wait for the complimentary burhanis was a bit too long. Of course, I ordered during durga puja when kolkata streets are a nightmare, so the delay is understandable. But I felt it would have been better if I was kept updated that the delivery would be later than expected. 

But to be honest, the food was worth the wait, and some more.

I won't say that I'm CRAZYYY about biryani but being a foodie, I tend to judge every food that I have by its smell, texture, taste and, in some cases, by the quantity.
Kabuliwala has passed each of these tests with flying colors:
The aroma is great.
The texture & taste: WOW! BRILLIANT!
The quantity: Enough to fill a huge belly.
BONUS: It's super light and ranks zero on the grease scale.
And the packaging: SMART! It is one of the (if not THE) most classy food packaging that I've ever seen.
I've had the Rozana Murg biryani, and the seal pack is so SEEEEALLEDDD that the food remains fresh even after 3-4 hours. Shouldn't question the temperature of the food. Duh! Even the clay pot containing the Burhani was airtight.
The Kabuliwala guys have certainly invested time to picture the requirements while having biryani. The package comes with bio-degradable plates, coin tissues and toothpicks.

Well, long story short: I shall be happy to tyaag all other biryanis for Kabuliwala! Hope they can increase the circumference of their delivery zone.

So far the best Biryani i have tested in kolkata, even better than Arsalan!
It's light, so doesn't leave you feeling stuffed. Both the taste and the texture of every ingredient is awesome.
I highly recommend KABULIWALA!

The packaging alone earns 5/5.

Ordered 9 plates of Rozana Gosht Biryani for office lunch, to be eaten by 18 people. The delivery was on time. The parcels were divided into 18 portions, separately sealed in zip lock packages with inner aluminum lining, to keep the temperature intact, and each of the packets were marked for chicken and mutton. Buhrani were served in separate burnt clay pots sealed with aluminum foils. Bio degradable plates, wet tissue capsules, beautiful clay pots for serving the burhani. Everything was spot on.

Taste wise the biryani was great. Very light on the palette, no extra greasiness. Super fine long grains of rice, perfectly cooked pieces of mutton, and adequate in quantity. The burhani wasn't authentic, it did not taste like one and did not contain bundiyas, however it tasted nice and served as a palette cleanser.

Amazing experience. Shall definitely try again. Highly recommend.

Took delivery twice for office team lunch.
The best part is they serve in earthen matkas. And the biriani is quintessential of Kolkata Dum Biriani. Briskly made of fine basmati rice with blend of aroma and scipes. The biriani looks light too. Had both chicken and mutton side dishes from here. Donot exactly remember the names but tasted good. Try oit their phirni too. :)

A friend/colleague of mine decided to treat us with biryani as he is soon going to be a groom! And we couldn't be happier. My recent experience with non-bengali biryani in Pune (Yep! all other types of biryani are just non-bengali for me) had me longing to taste some authentic bengali biryani all the more.

I was apprehensive to try a new place after my recent bad experience, but my friend made the call and we went ahead with it. And this is Kolkata after all, what could go wrong. 

So the food came piping hot, hopped on a Royal Enfield! The first thing I notice when biryani arrives is the smell. And the smell of the biryani was just perfectly mesmerizing, which set the mood for the food. 

Let's talk about the portions. My friend had ordered 3 Rozana Gosht Biryani and 2 Rozana Murg Biryani for us 10 people. Each of us had 2 pieces of juicy Mutton/Chicken pieces, a perfectly cooked potato (Oh bengali biryani! I missed you) and a lot of long-grained rice prepared in ghee! Even the guys among us who eat more then the rest had more than enough to fill their tummy!

Now comes the preparation. The biryani rice was very light on the palate. It was so evident that no dalda had been used in the preparation. The mutton pieces were tender (I had mutton) and well-cooked and the potato was ready to melt in my mouth. The aroma was simply great!

Then there was the presentation! I read somewhere that food is not only about the taste, it's about presentation as well. And full marks to Kabuliwala for the neat presentation. The ereca leave plates from Borpeta (from my home state, yay!) looked great and held up pretty well. And just felt so classy. The resealable biryani packets, the neatly packed tablet napkins and toothpicks and the beautifully decorated foil-sealed 'bhar' containing the complimentary 'ghol' known as Burhani- all were added attractions with the food. I was actually excited enough to wash my ereca plate and carry it home to show it to my mum (amid a lot of laughter and leg-pulling from my colleagues, of course!)
I would have preferred the 'ghol' to be a little less spicy. But then I haven't really tasted many varieties of this drink, so not really qualified to judge.

So presentation, preparation and portion, all are a winner for me! I would soon be ordering for my entire family. I will have to order in office and carry it home as they don't deliver to my place, but I think the extra effort would be totally worth it.

P.S. Was too busy eating to actually take more snaps. Next time!

A rich preparation of long grained aromatic basmati rice, with tenderly cooked pieces of meat in exotic spices, a dish so complex and flavorful, it is the food of the Nawabs. Biriyani!! We've all come to love it. 

There are so many different variety of Biriyani, but I always come back to the good old Kolkata Biriyani. Kabuliwala showed up on my FB page and I decided I had to order in from here. Though they said they don't deliver in sector 2, as a special case they did and thank you so much for that. It was such a delight! 

I had ordered for Shahi Murg Biriyani and chicken Bhuna masala. Full marks on the packaging. The Biriyani came in a clay handi. The cool quotient just went up. Complimentary burhani. Also, plates. And mind you not the cheap plastic ones. Eco friendly plates. Additional marks for that. 
Beautifully cooked aromatic rice with tender pieces of delicious chicken. It was delectable. Also, loved the bhuna masala. Explosion of flavors. The quantity was pretty good. 

Impressed with the food, impressed with the packaging, impressed with the service. It was indeed a special birthday dinner. 

It's very rare I give a restaurant 5 out of 5, but Kabuliwala deserves no less. Keep up the good quality, and this restaurant will go places.

I am Bengali, and that means Kolkata biryani is, to me, the highest kind of food there is. Over time, I have moved from Royal to Aminia to Arsalan, and Arsalan is what I wanted first on my visit to Kolkata this time. I got treated to Kabuliwala instead. 
The sheer audacity of this fresh, brave attempt at Kolkata's favourite soul food reminded me why I can kill for biryani. At first I thought it was yet another attempt at reinventing the wheel, but one look at the packaging, and I knew I was going to be surprised. The Shahi Gosht biryani came in a decently big clay handi, and the Bhuna Gosht also came in a clay pot. The burhani was complimentary, and the firni came in standard packaging. What I found fascinating was, they also provided plates - not standard thermocol or paper - these were way classier-looking areca leaf plates - and I am not embarrassed to say this, I have never seen plates like this before. There was another little pouch with two cute coin tissue towels and toothpicks - clearly a sign that the people at Kabuliwala have given a fair thought to the entire experience of eating. No more bad plastic containers or leaky foil packaging wrapped in cheap plastic! This was a classy, and I believe, entirely recyclable packaging. 
The quantity was massive! MASSIVE! There were two or three pieces of mutton per serving, with a very soft potato cooked right till the centre. Quite unlike the Lazeez potato that so often has a hard centre. The mutton was cooked right through too - and every layer of meat had flavour. The rice was sublime - you could make out that their ingredients did not have cheap attar. What happens with biryani so often is, after the first few mouthfuls, you get a waxy coating on your tongue and the rice tends to become that way too. Not so with Kabuliwala's rice. It remained what we Bengalis call "jhorjhorey" right till the end. 
The Bhuna Gosht perfectly complimented the biryani. I will be honest, it looked a little daunting at first, and because I personally do not like my food very hot and fiery, I was a little iffy about trying it. But the curry turned out beautiful - it had a surprising burst of flavour without any heat, and I didn't have to reach out for water even once. The oil floating on top was just about what makes a good mutton bhuna - not over or under. I did not use any soap after I ate, and there was no oil residue on my fingers. That's a clear indication that what they are serving you has none of the dalda or overt oiliness that most places will have. 
The firni too was excellent. It was full of more dry fruits than in most places, and had a beautiful texture. I am not a fan of grainy firni, and this was a beautifully creamy, soft firni, served at the right temperature.  The burhani was great too, although I would prefer a little more flavour. 
I do have one minor complaint though. The food arrived after it was scheduled to, but it was worth the wait. The delivery boy apologised profusely, and I believe the management can sort this out over time. If they can, and if they begin to deliver all across town, Kabuliwala is poised to become the next big brand. I would gladly sacrifice Arsalan for this taste. Delicate, sublime, soft - I don't know how to describe the food, but this is really something you have to eat to believe. 
Biryani doesn't get better than this. Go try!

It was actually a blind date with Kabuliwala. No I am serious! All of a sudden, if someone comes to your town from far away Kabul, and starts talking about "Sinful" stuffs, you automatically get distracted from your daily office work, and start dreaming about the blind date the next day. Same happened to me as well, just heard yesterday afternoon,another new restaurant is in town, and was operational from yesterday only. Have you ever heard of biryani being sold in KiloGrams? Yes, this is the beginning of the story.

Ok, enough is enough. :-p Now coming to the real business, we ordered 1 Shahi Gosht Biryani at 1:15 pm, they promised they will deliver by 1:40 pm, but we changed our decision, ordered another Shahi Gosht Biryani, we thought they will not take the 2nd order, but as I already mentioned, it was a blind date, Kabuliwala was so generous that they brought back their delivery boy to the store and sent him with the updated order exactly at 2:15 pm, yes they are offering a commitment of 25 minutes delivery as well :) . Now the most awkward moment, when the delivery boy handed over the "Sinful" Biryani in our hand, trust me, it was two big handi containing 3.4 KiloGrams of Biryani.

Whole delivery package contains 2 biryani handi, 4 clay pots of Burhani, 4 Areca Leaf(Supari pata) Plates, 2 small packs of coin-towels and toothpicks. We were four people started opening the handi, by that time, we became the centre of attraction in our office cafeteria. We didn't pay much attention as we had a plate full of Biryani that too with 3 succulent pieces of mutton, 1 potato and 1 egg, and most importantly, the biryani was not heavy, but no sign of compromising the flavour. And, all this came at a cost of 780/- for 4(yes, they are now offering 40% discount), honestly, we were too full that even we skipped our evening snacks..!!

Burrrp!!!

Pathetic Experience !! Absolutely NOT recommended !!

I ordered for a Shahi Gosht Biryani from them from my office at Salt Lake Sector 5 today. At first they informed me that they don't deliver at Sector 5. The person informed me that they deliver upto Technopolis only. So I suggested that they send the food to Technopolis from where we will collect the food and placed the order accordingly. As per order they would have called us at 1:15 PM and we would have collected the order at the designated place at 1:45 PM. However at 1:10 PM, they called me to inform that they can't deliver the Order and will be cancelling the same !! Cancellation of Order at the last moment is highly unprofessional. They could have declined at the very beginning only. We almost missed lunch for the day. Please Avoid this place !!

We decided to order from this place impromptu after looking at the flyer distributed outside office (also by looking at the 40% discount thing) ! Not only was the food yummm.. so were the extra perks! so we ordered for 2 portions of Rozana Murg Biriyani (1.2kgs, serves 2) and half Bhuna Murg masala; Although the food came in 30 mins late (we understand since it was raining heavily), the lunch experience was awesome! The Biriyani was meticulously packed in re-sealable plastic packs in 4 packs- so the quantity in one of the packs was more than a plateful... the chicken was also superbly tasty.. But the best thing about this place, after the yummy food, was the awesome presentation. They sent us 4 paper plates (Eco- friendly stuff) pack in paper bags. There was a yogurt based pudina drink which came in " matir bhaars"  nicely foil packed, then lastly we discovered there were two tiny bags of toothpicks and coin towels- unpacking our "lunch experience" was simply comparable to unpacking Christmas/birthday gifts! And the tasty food was simply mind blowing! the total cost of the lunch was around 550 for 5, which is a jackpot win worthy deal! All in all- happy tummies delivered to you on hot wheels(read Royal Enfield!) by Kabuliwala!
