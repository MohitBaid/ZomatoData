Another old and average sweet shop in Barrackpore. Convenient location. Average quality but reasonable price. Have had different kinds of sweets from their shop over the years. Been there quite a few times during my school days.

Have been here a few times.bought rosogolla and sandesh rabri etc etc ,price is low compared to the other places nearby but the place is a bit unclean .so standing and eating is not an option for me.

Located near Barrackpore station. They sell a variety of sweets at reasonable price but the quality of sweets is average.
Quick service with nice staffs.
Caters the need of local people but for true sweetlovers try other brands like Balaram Radharaman Mallick , KC sweets, Mahasen, Putiraam etc

Bengal is famous for sweets. Sweet shops are located all over. But Barrackpore is certainly not the best place for sweets. All the shops have average quality sweets, nothing to rave about. Sweet lovers must visit  Radharaman Balaram Mallick , KC Das, Dwarik , Ganguram etc instead. Though at the time of need, local people have to come here.
This shop holds the same average tagmark . Sweets are average with reasonable price. Staffs are well behaved.

Near the barrackpore station. Decent place.Sondesh are awsome but i clearly doubt about the chop section. A visit in winter will not dissapoint you

Decent, that's exactly what I felt when I first visited this joint. 
Probably the best place buy sweets in this barackpore-palta-ichapore area.
