Tessa is the newest and only restaurant till now in the New Town's Action Area 3 area. This was a golden opportunity for them to cater to local gastronomists of the area but rather they tried to opt the way of monopoly, stale food and poor quality and pathetic customer service.
Their menu have fancy Chinese dishes which names are actually copy of few famous dishes from Mainland China but taste wise miles away. All dishes coming out of their kitchen taste same. In one of the cases, Rashmalai served to us was stale and the owner blamed it to his supplier rather taking any ownership.
The management has no knowledge of the hospitality or service industry and servers working there are not trained rather local villagers working part-time. Strictly avoid this establishment for the sake of your health.

As I can see, this place has got really extreme reviews  either ones or fours, still decided to give a try. I have been there twice. Both times it was average. 
Menu is basic Indian Chinese items. Preparation isn't bad either. 
What I have tried : chicken tai pai, manchow soup, naan, chicken kassa, chow mien and chilli chicken. I loved the soup most. 
Flavours are good but chicken tai pai was so hot today. It had a lot more chilli than required.I started tearing up literally but because it was tasty so I finished it. 
Waiters need to be more informed about items and tie up with online ordering sites. Because ordering can be a pain here. 
However it's one well maintained place and can improve. They need to lower the prices a little, looking at the location if they want people to drive all the way to end of the city. Also train the staff a little better, they are polite but need more exposure.

Good place near shapoorji to have food. However, I found the dishes somewhat over-priced as per the quantity and the quality of the food. We ordered mixed fried rice, the ingredients in it were very less.

We tried chicken chill black pepper, prawns and chicken fried noodles. Everything was very tasty. We loved it. Price is also very reasonable. The only thing it needs to improved is staff. They need to be trained in customer service... anyway we liked it would and  recommend others to try

I ordered for an Egg Black Pepper Rice which by taste was like or much spicier and hotter than Egg Schezwan Rice and by appearance on bill it was Egg Fried Rice! Now I really have to cook again for my son who can not have this spicy food.

The Chili Chicken was good though by quality and quantity.

Firstly the staff are not trained to handle customer queries about food. They stare at you like your an alien. Menu does not have a good variety unlike restaurants in tangra. Waste of money. Pull it act togather.  Otherwise u will be out of business soon.

I have tried there twice. Including one today only .. Dont ever go there.. Their cook doesn't know to cook Chinese though they serve Chinese only as for north indian generally they reply that it is not available... In noodles u will not find salt or will be overcooked.. Sugar u will found everywhere in every dish.. It seems that chef is not cooking Chinese instead they r putting the taste of Bengali food in every dish.. I have decided will never ever go there now onwards.. I went there today again even after first bad experience thinking might it was one odd case.. But no they r consistent in it.. Even after u brief them in beginning tht u dnt need sugar in anything they will make sure u get it in everything.. They replaced it when we objected but this time they had put extra chillies tht we had to leave our food midway.. They tried to offer us complimentary ice cream which we ddnt take.. All the best if still u want to try... Though u can try their starters which r gud.

Its a real good initiative to open a sober dining restaurant in the shapoorji complex as there are no such dinning places there. Visted with my friends yesterday as one of my friend stay there and insisted to try out the place. It had a good ambiance and cleanliness was there, food is good went for schezuan rice, chicken in hot garlic sauce, and chicken hakka noodles. It was overall a good meal. Price is reasonable. But my suggestion is to change the staff there. They don't understand things properly. Very poor understanding skills results in bad communication. As one time experience it was good i.e just for the food. But i would definitely not travel all the way from salt lake to shapoorji just to eat there again!

The only thing good and worth mentioning is the lighting. Owner is too busy engrossed in watching live cricket. Gently asked the waiter if we could have watched football or music. He refused. Anyways coming to food. I had ordered chicken dim sum and prawn zucchini hargow dumplings. Waited almost an hour inspite of no customers. The dumplings are miniscule in size and shape. Poor taste. Please refrain visiting the place.

I ordered mixed haaka noodles and a vergin mojito.As a noodles lover I expect more from Tessa .It's not mixed haaka noodles anyway ,the taste doesn't justice its price.over all noodles is kind of watery not so good , Actually bad bt the mocktail is good .For it's high pricing I am bit disappointed with its taste .Overall ambient is good and service is OK.

The order came on time. I ordered a chicken fried rice and one tangra style chilly chicken.  The food was not  good. Specially the fried rice. The vegetables were raw and were not at all fried and the chilly chicken was okay. Nothing spectacular.  Overall i was not satisfied with the food. It was way overpriced.

Located in New Town Plaza in the DLF complex this is the first restaurant to have opened in the complex.It is a small restaurant with a decent decor.The staff is cordial.I ordered an takeaway and the first thing that struck be about the food was that everything had pepper powder in it,even the chicken clear soup.Other than that the food quality was alright,the quantity can however be improved.If they can address these glitches I think it can be a decent place for a quite family dinner.

If you want to disappoint yourself and punch a hole in your wallet - welcome to the perfect place. The dim sums are in such minuscule form and shape that you would be able to recognize the fragments of your DNA without the help of a microscope. When you end up paying 500 bucks for dinner just for a single person you might not want to open your fridge looking for other options. But double check that statement. Make sure you have enough food in your repository before ordering. If you ask me about the taste, well I guarantee that you have had better than this. Trust my judgement, eschew ordering from this restaurant. Stay hungry, even if it's the last place on the planet earth offering food. Your guilt will haunt you.

Generally empty, hence you get all the attention of the staff, sometimes over doing it. 
Coming to the food, we ordered chicken manchow soup - the chicken strips were chewy, tangra style chilli chicken - good, chicken hakka noodles schezwan - would have preferred it dry, somehow it felt watery and chicken hakka noodles chilli garlic - again watery, spicy but not as good in taste. Overall food taste and quantity is OK.
The sitting area is not that big and occasional gusts of fry sauce and chilli aroma from the kitchen can cause a coughing fit for those who are sensitive to these smells.
Menu is pretty limited, not many options on the rice/ noodles and main course.

Mixed non-veg hakka noodles was without prawns and too bland. On asking what went wrong regarding the prawns, the only answer I got was "it was a mistake". Since mine was a home delivery I cud not even cancel the order. Will nvr order from this place again nor would recommend.
