Went with Avirup Dutta during the pujas.Its located at  quite calm environment and not quite famous.But, you've definitely gotta try their food.The decor is funky, interior is hygenic with beautiful music.Tried their crispy chicken hakka style,hakka noodles,chicken in oyster sauce,chicken stroganoff,grilled chicken breasts and their special pizza.Of all i must say that you should visit this place for ultimate thin crust pizza,Perfect price, perfect crust,loads of multiple toppings.Other dishes are some average others above average.All in all would go back there for the pizza.

Really sad as the staff is not even courteous enough to inform that the order is gonna take over an hour to come although it was three simple dishes. 
Secondly the food after it came which i would like to point out after an hour and a half the pasta sauce was watery like hell. And i m sitting here in the restaurant writing the review waiting over an hour and my other two dishes are still on its way..


Sad experience.. won't recommend anyone to come here

Got food home delivered from the cave a couple of times and wow! The food was amazing! Their philly steak sandwich was very wholesome 10 inch long full of chicken slices and yummy cheese and their non veg triple decker sandwich and cream of chicken soup with thyme was most delicious! The best I've had in a long while. All in all very satisfied with my food experience with the cave and look forward to try out more of their dishes.

It's absolutely not a cave so feel free to visit this nice cosy and calm place in the quiet lanes of new alipore.
They are giving 20%discounts till 31st October. So don't miss the chance to enjoy treats with your friends at a pocket friendly price.
We had coffee shake and Belgian chocolate shake... The chocolate shake was absolutely yum rich with chocolates.
Don't miss their teriyaki chicken... It's juicy flavours with the sesame seeds was just outstanding.
I didn't like the crust of the BBQ chicken pizza. It was like crunching biscuits.. However the topping was a delight.
Services are nice. I am looking forward to pay another visit and try out some of the other items on the menu. They do provide a nice variation.

Dear Zomato, they have a seating space. Six units of six seater sofas.

Had visited this place today evening and had ordered a black coffee for which they gave a dip, a hot and sour chicken soup which was average and garlic bread ( they did not have cheese garlic bread). Heard that it usually remains quite empty. Try once.

A calm and quiet place in New alipore, not that popular but serves some really good food, especially chicken lasagna, and crispy mushrooms and noodles. Icing on the cake was the brownie with vanilla ice cream, and happy birthday written on it, since they came to know that it was my birthday! Loved their gesture. A good place to hangout with friends! I'd recommend a visit to this place for sure :)

Was very much excited with the name of this outlet, and got an opportunity to explore the place with my family.
Was happy to see the decor of the place...it was good. But surprisingly the place was not at all crowded even it was Saturday night. Only 2 tables were occupied when we entered.
First experience... the AC was not cooling enough.
But no problem... we were happy to find a lot of variety in the menu.. but unfortunately whatever we were planning to eat..mostly were not available.
There was only one staff who was working as a steward, waiter and cashier as well, so the service was getting affected but we are not blaming the staff as he was trying his best.
The food was tasty, but definitely not that good as we were expecting. Very much disappointed with the Chicken Sizzler that I had ordered for myself. It was more like Fried Rice and Boneless Sweet Chilli Chicken served on a Sizzler hot plate.
Ordered for a Mexican Combo as well... but we were served with only typical fried rice and some kind of a spicy shredded chicken.
Very basic I must say.
But yes..... the cheese garlic breads and quasadillas were really good..
Visited this joint for the first time... but may not plan for a revisit...personal choice only 😋

American Cave is one of the best places in its location at Taratala.

The food is mouthwatering and the price is quite reasonable.One of the dishes we ordered was grilled Chicken, and the meat was so tender and well cooked that it really impressed me. The mocktails are quite refreshing!

Apart from food, the decor is adorable! The staffs are very courteous!

It's a small and cozy place with few tables but has a lot of delicious dishes in its bucket :)

If you want to try a new place away from a little hustle bustle, visit this restaurant at New Alipore. Spacious , with wooden finished interiors , this place has a vintage look. I personally felt the menu could have been little better with more variety of Western dishes and there are many competitors under this category. We ordered cappuccinos and non veg quesidillas​ which tasted good. The next order was Cajuan Sandwich, which surprisingly had the same chicken filling that was used in quesidillas. That kind of calls for a negative marking. 
Although you have a spacious interior but there is only a four seater high rise table chair outside. This can be improved. Surprisingly the cafe did not have high footfall, may be due to it's aloof location, but I'm sure if they put little more effort with everything, consumers will happily come in and recommend to others.

Went on a lazy afternoon.
Ordered Quasadillas, Lebanese Platter, Molten lava surprise and a Mango thick shake.

Quasadillas were the best part of my food experience here. Loads of chicken and tasty dips. Loved it.

Platter was a bit dry.

Molten lava cake did not have any molten part and was high on egg.

Disappointing - is all I can say about this one.

I ordered online after going through the reviews and suggestions of fellow reviewers and was very dissatisfied at the quality of food they served. 

The much famed Honey Glazed Chicken wings were slate and had the pungent smell of old and reused oil! The chicken was obviously cooked for a long time and refried in a hurry before serving - they were icy cold and hard inside but warm on the outside. The sauce with honey and garlic was good, but sadly good sauce can't salvage stale chicken! 

Next was the Quasadillas - The filling was tasty, but tje tortillas were no tortillas, but just plain parathas! They did put cheese to give it a better flavour, but the plain parathas, fried in oil didn't do justice to the Quasadillas. 

Big let down. Food maybe be good or bad, not slate or  raw food is just not acceptable.

It serves you with 8 pieces and with mayonise and sweet & sour dip. We ordered the basil noodles which was good too. The noodles were a lil undercooked. The schezwan tofu is a must try. I liked the overall presentation. Quantity is also fine. Also we wanted to try the Moroccan cigar rolls but unfortunately this was sold out.

This cafe is one of the cool places in behala-new alipore region to hangout with friends. Located just beside Bidya Bharati school in new alipore,it's very easy to locate. 
I went there with a friend of mine. The place was well lit,decorated with lamps hanging from the ceiling,there were simple yet unique wall decors like one  portion of the wall was decorated with colourful letter boxes. 
Now coming to the food we ordered.
1. Honey glazed chicken wings- Served 4 pieces coated in a sauce. They served the sauce separately too beside the dish. This was really tasty and all credit goes to the honey chilli sauce. A nice starter.
2. Mexicana Chicken Pizza- This was average. Its a thin crust pizza  consisting of bell peppers,onion and chicken.
3. Ferrero rocher shake - Ferrero rocher itself is something to die for and this shake will not disappoint you. Being a chocolate lover, I really liked it.
Though the prices are on a higher side as compared to the food it serves,overall it is a decent place to chill with your friends.

It was a fine sunny Sunday noon when I visited American Cave with a friend. The staff was very welcoming. The ambience, decor, the Kimchi salad and the shakes : everything went absolutely fine upto this far. We ordered for the main course and I chose a dish named " Carbonara ". It took me some time to realise that it had pork. No, that wouldn't have been an issue ,had they mentioned it to me. It is a matter of personal dislike.  I had asked the staff about how Carbonara would be. He never mentioned pork. Later, when my friend asked about why such mention wasn't there even in the Menu, the staff's behaviour suddenly changed. He very haughtily answered,  " Sir this is a classic dish . There's nothing to mention in here" . I understand about the dish being an Italian Classic , but not everyone holds such minute knowledge about food. It was a little awkward that not once did we get an apology . Thank Goodness for the dessert! The molten lava cake saved the day! Then again, I would think twice the next time I intend to visit here or suggest anyone else to go for American Cave.

Have become a regular place for dining out, as it is close to my location. Honestly speaking I love the hospitality. Even though mojito was not there in the menu they tried to make a perfect one on request. Adding to the hospitality is the decorative segment that is prioritized factor in an area like New Alipore. I have no complains for the food as I have tasted the Lebanese dishes, honey glazed chicken. Just a request please purchase better quality tortellas. Best of luck and keep coming up with more quality dishes.

I ordered the ceaser salad and honey glazed chicken.I liked both the items..
Although the menu card doesn't have much options considering the fact that it is a newly opened restaurant.I think they should have more options on the menu.
Otherwise a thumps up for all the other things.

Good food coupled with a good ambience makes it a perfect place to hangout with friends and family. The upper deck is beautifully decorated with lights.We ordered -
1) Mexican Hotpot & Cilantro Rice: Shredded chicken with capsicum, a little bit spicy ! Served with nachos and salsa. There was another dip , mayo sort of but little tangy, good to taste. Rice was okay okay type.

2)Chicken Exotica: a sizzler, chunks of chicken coated with red sauce/gravy! Served with rice.

What I missed the most : the veggies in a sizzler, that was missing. And the rice for both the dishes taste almost same.

But the waiter bhaiya ( i dnt know his name though) came forward n asked how was the food? Good to see that they are trying to communicate with customers and valuing their suggestions!

And the most annoying thing - they had 2 songs playing on a loop throughout.

Went here on a Monday afternoon for lunch. The place is colourful and quite big. We sat upstairs. Ordered 2 orange fizz and one pineapple fizz. They tasted like real juice. The Caesar salad was really good. The specialty there was a honey glazed wings. Highly recommended! The sauce accompanying it a delight as well. The nachos were a bit disappointing. Very less Salsa is given with it and the cheese on it was processed cheese so it didn't melt well. We opted for a Thai green curry and for the first time it had brinjal in it. But thankfully the chef came and told us they were experimenting and gave us another share which was perfect. So thank god for that. We tried the caramel custard and although they told us it was warm it tasted like scrambled eggs. No vanilla essence was used whatsoever so it was a very sad ending. But we did point those out to them and they said they would make the changes.

Went there with 3 of my friends for lunch. Located in New Alipur this restaurant just blown us away with the taste and the quantity. The honey glazed chicken wings is the best I ever had and highly recommended. Other dishes were equally good. The quantity was amazing and for the people with higher apatite. The service was good and the ambience was smart with USA flavours.

Not a very delightful experience. The Burgers offered are good, but all the sides need reviewing. The Onion Rings, Fries, Nachos etc. None of them are good. The Nachos seem like common bag of Nachos with Sour Cream, I'd rather have at home!

This place is 2 min walking distance towards the opposite road of Mint, Majherhat. Very easy to locate. This is actually a very well decorated cafe. The place is divided in 2 floors. The lower floor is decorated with lots of Hollywood celebrities photo frames and lots of ceiling lamps. And the upper floor is not that well decorated. The ambience is average. When you are talking about light foods, snacks then this is the place where you should visit. Honey chicken wings, the dish everyone should try here. The place is little costly but worth a visit.

Tucked into a corner in new alipore it located just opposite Mama Mia... Your search for classic American food ends here .. the quesadillas and burritos ends here ... value for money is not that much .. and the pizza here is not up to the mark .. the restaurant should more options in the vegetarian section though

Ambience  of this place is somewhat cosy and it gives you a refreshing  change in the otherwise  clichéd restaurants  in Kolkata.  
Delicacies  are served neatly and the taste is mouth watering. 
I had ordered two dishes namely "Lasagna" and  "Ceasar salad" and both of them were extremely  tasty. I am a big freak when it comes to salads and anyplace which serves good salad keeps my heart
Service is good and I told them to suggest my dish which came out to be pretty nice. 
It is a good place to  go with your friends  as it has a hep feeling. 
It is never too filled since big crowd is a turn down for people  who like to enjoy their meal in peace. 
You must definitely  give this place a visit.

In my hunt for some good steak in Kolkata, I came across this great nifty joint. I really liked the decor here (at-least it suited my taste). The food that I ordered was quite lean compared to what I usually order at a steak house. Although this is not a proper steak joint "I ENJOYED EVERY BIT OF".

I ordered a Grilled Tenderloin Steak Served Three Ways, Fettuccine Alfredo, Pineapple Fizz and Ferrero Rosher.

The steak ONE of the best I had till now. The meat melted away. I didn't want the veggies and the rice they serve so they gave me a complimentary plate of Fresh Garlic Bread. The mushroom gravy that they served was yummmmmm..

Fettuccine Alfredo was perfectly done with a great balance of flavors. It was so smooth and creamy.

Pineapple Fizz and Ferrero Rosher were really great. Tasted fresh and the rosher was really creamy.

Honestly it was not a very good experience...
An order of 2 Coffees were served one at a time... 
The second arrived almost by the time the 1st person could have finished his cup.
We found the staff sleeping in the cafe when we were allowed to walk up stairs.... a bit of an embarrassing situation both as client and the owners ..am sure...

Nice place for quick bites like pizza , pasta , sandwich etc. Service is fast and staff very courteous. We ordered a pizza and an orange shaker which tasted good. Price is reasonable. Interiors are average... floor above can be used for throwing a party for about 30 to 35 people. 
Can be visited if you are in new alipore and want to eat some good food .

What an experience it was!! It is one of the hidden gems!! Not so specious but very neat and clean well decorated restaurant. Staffs are very polite and well behaved. It is located at new alipore. Near by the bidyabharati girls high school. Opposite of the gilato ice cream parlour.
      It was durga puja sasthi. I went there with my friend for lunch. And thanx to my friend who suggested me to visit this place.At first We ordered nonveg ceaser salad which was average. Then we ordered honey glaced chicken. And I stole the show!!! The best dish of this puja indeed. Yumm and out of the world!! It is a must try item over there. Then  they suggested us the crumbed fried fish with chips. It was also really good in taste!! In desert we ordered fresh mango shake and orange sparkle. Both were good. Overall a really good experience it was.
     I would like to suggest the management to promote urself. A proper advertisement should be there around. That day no one else were there other than us. It is unfortunate. U deserve to have a que of people waiting outside ur entrance. Please focus on the promotion a bit

American cave is a recently opened cafe in New Alipore in the famous lane where a lot of other eateries are located. 

They have exquisite pastas, the Mac and cheese was just brilliant and creamy, a classic dish made the classic way.

What I must talk about now is their pork chops and chicken wings, if you visit here and you miss two of these dishes, it would be the biggest blunder on your part, the honey chilli glaze on both the meats is absolutely lip smacking, the meat itself is tender and well marinated. Makes for the best ones I've had in this city.

After reading the reviews my friends and I decided to visit this place in the so-called posh area of Alipur.
Located away from the noisy traffic but situated within a 5 minute auto-ride to Kalighat metro station.
We ordered Fried Calamari with Cajun dip for our starters and Grilled Chicken Breasts and Lasagne for our mains.
Everything tasted delicious.
The chicken was moist and juicy.
The pasta sheets were thing and soft and cooked beautifully 
The decor was equally good and welcoming.
Being first customers, we got complimentary Fresh Lime Soda.
The two reasons for not giving a full 5star rating is :-

1)  I would have liked the calamori to be fried a little more till they were golden brown in colour. Also I would have like the bread along with the lasagne to be crisp not soft.
2) Lastly, when I go to a resturant I would prefer that they have everything mentioned on the menu. Judging by the reviews, I wanted to try the Steak but was denied that opportunity.

Overall a big thumbs and a must visit to all the foodies out there, especially american food lovers..!!

Visited the place with 3 of my friends! The place is easy to find, just a minutes walk from the Majherhat bridge! We were received with warm greetings from the Staffs. We had ordered Fried Calamari rings for starters, and Grilled Chicken Breasts "Craupaudine", Lasagne Alla Forno for main course. The quantity they served was more than adequate. And they tasted awesome. Starting from the Calamari rings to the pasta! Loved every bit of the food they served. They even served us with Fresh Lime Soda as we were visiting the store for the first time. The behavior of the staffs were just awesome.
Now coming to the price, it was quite cheap if I take the quality and quantity in to account!
Overall had a wonderful experience. Looking forward to visiting again and recommending to others too.

It was one of my many visits to American Cave, as usual. A restaurant is always judged by the quality of food, the decor and ambience, and overall hospitality. The food over here as always is awesome:- Fettuccine Alfredo, Lasagne Alla Forno, Honey glazed chicken wings, Calamari Rings, Chk Quesadilas, Burritos, the Sandwiches, the omelettes, poached eggs and the all day breakfast to name a few. 
The ambience and decor is decent and pleasing to the eyes, which enhances the dinning experience.   
Last but certainly not the least, the behaviour of the staff is warming and fantastic. Kudos to all the members of American Cave and keep the good work going. A special mention of thanks to Mr. Praveen Roshan, for his warm behaviour, his attention to guests to make them feel special and his gorgeous hospitality. All you people just rock.........

It was the first of many visits(to come) to this place. Unfortunately it was unplanned so I couldn't really gobble down as much as I would have loved to. That said, what we did munch on was no less than sheer brilliant. This is a cozy little place with really spacious sitting arrangements and really well decorated. As the name suggests, it's gives you that american flavor as soon as you walk into this place. We ordered a plate of Chicken Quesadilas and a Banan-mango smoothie. The Chicken Quesadilas was good. I loved the texture of the cheese it had to offer. The Banana Mango smoothie was out of the ball park to say the least. 

Coming to the decoration, this place was no less than beautiful. I personally think New Alipore needs more good eateries like this. Please. The staff, were really polite and nice. I really can't wait to try out other dishes from their menu the next time I visit. I just wish this place had an alcohol licence. Then I wouldn't even need to leave New Alipore to get drunk,  Haha. 

All jokes apart, this place seriously deserves a lot more traffic than it's getting right now. Don't miss out on this people. I am sure you won't be disappointed.

A great food joint for continental lovers. So far they have limited menu but I guess they put up whatever they can serve well. They serve the shakes in cool jars and food in stylish plates which marked the package more interesting. I tried the ferrero rocher shake, tenderloin and tasted the chicken steak and all of them were like so so good. Looking forward to go again and taste the other foods . I would recommend this joint to everyone great food great ambience and very well mannered workers inside making the place nicer.

Well, a new addition to the food map of new alipore. Located nearby Vidya Bharati school. 
As the name suggests, this place specializes in good old american cuisines (everything bigger, meatier & tastier and loaded with yummilicious dressings). This newbie was in my list for a long time and finally I dropped in here last Sunday night.
Since the entrance and the courteous and warm welcome from the host, it was a terrific experience.
They had a comfy and simple yet elegant ambience with multifloor sitting arrangement with efficiently space utilized layout and aesthetically pleasant.
Their nature of offerings somewhat resembles with that of Chilie's and TGIF; whatever it be; but they did justice to everything.
We ordered a Chicken sashquatch burger and one tenderloin steak.
Our food was served within 15 minutes, I was literally drooling just by merely looking at the dishes.

Chicken sashquatch burger- It was GIGANTIC indeed, served with handmade potato fries( perfectly seasoned and crisp yet melted in the mouth) along with salad dipped in mayo dressing and a bowl of dip.

Tenderloin Steak- the steak was served with steamed rice( boiled with basil&clove, hence had a distinctive and mesmerizing aroma) sautéed veggies; the steak was perfectly well done upon black&white pepper sauce. It was damn succulent.
Trust me i'm drooling while typing this review!!

The manager( though I am not sure regarding his real identity) was very friendly and we had a nice chat. 
Finally we received 2 mocktails on the house( lucky!!😇😇😇). It was refreshing as well.

Honestly speaking having such a redefining and sumptuous  restaurant with world class hospitality in a residential locality is nothing less than a boon.

Went here to celebrate my birthday with my friends. It is situated near by Bidya Bharati School in New Alipore. The interior is impressive. Coming to the food, we ordered Veg Caesar Salad, Mushroom Strogonoff, Grilled Chicken Breasts "Craupaudine", Veg Fettuccine Alfredo Pasta and Molten Lava "Surprise". Must say the quantity of the food was very less, thus the foods seemed a little overpriced. The quality was good enough though. Special mention for the Molten Lava, that really is a must try. Also another thing to keep in mind is that for vegetarians there is a very limited number of options available. The staff was warm. Might visit again.

This was the 3rd time i visited American Cave and i must say that the quality of food keeps dropping. The only thing great about the place is the service. The staff are so polite and listen to us when we have a problem. The MANAGER on the other hand will be the reason for customers to never return. He does not listen to what the customer has to say, instead he just argues to make himself right and and pins the problem on the customer. During all three visits i have watched him argue with half a dozen people and yesterday was my turn. 

1. The  quantity of the pasta in comparison to the previous times had fairly decreased. Besides the pasta being al dente, it was not palatable. i was served pasta which was almost dry, basically the alfredo sauce was missing and just a few colored bell peppers thrown in.  On receiving it after they apologized, the pasta was mixed with a great amount of black pepper and chilli flakes.  Well, this was a first where my mouth was on fire eating Linguine Afredo.

2. The Burger was quiet average. Nothing to go back to.

A real discovery! And I'm so glad we stopped by. More like a den than a cave, the ambience, nevertheless, was inviting. Loved the decor especially the colorful post boxes, the B & W shots of the stars and the philosophy of the American Cave! Loved, too, the picnic tables concept! The music added to the general atmosphere. We were welcomed warmly by Amitabh, who took good care of us right through the meal. He was knowledgeable about the dishes and helped us in our choice of food. We ordered Grilled Chicken Breasts 'Craupaudine', Crumb-fried Fish & Chips for our main meal to be followed by Apple Pie with Ice Cream and Coffee - Cappuccino and Cafe Mocha. The food was served aesthetically, and obviously their philosophy was at work because the food was delicious. The fish was fried to perfection, the wedges were near perfect, the grilled chicken was beautifully cooked and the pepper sauce was as it should be---peppery and creamy. I was happy to see that they served the tartar sauce in a sauce bowl and not as a dollop on the plate....some thought obviously went into this! Once again I was impressed by the way the dessert was served. We had asked for one slice of apple pie to be shared. They cut the slice into 2 neat halves and served the ice cream on the side. The apple pie was superb and the ice cream was heaven (not the horrible commercial kind). We wanted the coffee along with the dessert and it was served just so. The  Cappuccino was the way it should be and the Mocha was really good. I always have a problem with Mocha because baristas often put in cold chocolate and what one is served is a lukewarm beverage. This was hot and the taste was just right. All in all, a SUPERB meal. (A tiny word of caution: Please check the spellings on the menu....a couple of them could do with a rewrite). 

Our compliments to the chef and thanks to Amitabh who made it a very pleasant lunch experience.My fervent plea - 1. Please maintain this standard. 2. Please, please do not localize the menu or the taste or anything about the food and service. And 3. Please do not Bollywood-ize your café.

Very average food.....the Vegetarian Burger was kind of a let down and lacked the crunch you expect in a burger.....most of the deserts were not available neither were the shakes.

Visited the restaurant for the first time with my collegue .... The warm welcome of the service personnel impressed me at the very onset of my gastronomic venture ... Ordered their Grilled Chicken Breast, Lasagna Ala Forno and Molten Lava Cake ... The Chicken dish was good enough, the assorted grilled veggies and the buttered rice perfectly supplementing the dish ... However the Lasagna dish was a real disappointment as the excessive cheese imparted an odour and acidic flavour too strong for comfort ... Rather the garlic breads served alongside provided some relief ... Nevertheless, followed the best of the lot ... The Molten Lava Cake ... It was absolutely delightful and really a perfect finish to the meal ... We were overwhelmed by the cordial reception of the staff and looking forward to revisit the place to try out the other delicacies on the card ...

Discovered this joint on da go. Was super hungry nd this place seemed lyk a saviour as there are hardly decent eatries in da neighbourhood. The service staffs greeted us with happy faces asking us how we were doing!! The menu was limited! Ordered thin crust mexican chicken pizza & super thick belgian choco shake!! Da service was prompt so thumps up to dat!! Now coming to food...pizza was soooo cheesy with fat chunks of chicken nd da shake was a delight!! Special mention must be made of the service staffs as they took our feedback time nd again. Over all experience was great nd definitely coming back to this place in future!!

American Cave - The new cave satiating tastebuds.
=====
Intro + Location:

This place is located very near to my area. It is located right next to Vidya Bharati School New Alipore or you can say diagonally opposite to Mamamia. We were a group of foodies who wanted to try out this particular joint. We took our seats and began ordering the food.

The ambiance of this place is quite nice with vibrant letter boxes to add on to this chic look of the cafe. They even had large sofa's for those of who want to relax all day and a banquet at the 1st floor which is being renovated. I really like the bell concept which they used for lights which is quite similar in buddha bites. Secondly, the brick wall is adding elegance to the decor.
=====
What we ordered: -

• Belgian Choco Shake and Ferrero Rocher Shake - I personally found these two to be tasting the same. I would suggest them to work on the taste and even a bit on presentation. It's a must for chocolate lovers. ✌✌

• Cafe Mocha - It was hot but somewhat lacked a bit on taste.

• Fresh Mango Shake - I found the shake to be yummy. It was thick and rich with mango wedge on top of jar to present. loved it. ✌✌

• Apple Lemonade - It was tangy as well as refreshing at the same time. If you have a thing for tangy palate, this is for you. It had apples cut in country style inside. ✌✌

Note - All of them were served in mason jars.

• Chicken Hawaiian Pineapple Salad – The salad was well presented on a carved out pineapple. However, the staff forgot to add on the chicken. The shredded chicken came as a presentation after the dish was presented. We topped up the chicken in the salad dressing and blended it before we took our bite. It was very well presented and it had good quantum of chicken, pineapple, lettuce, tomatoes etc. Tasted great and I would surely love to come back for this. ✌✌

• Honey Glaced Chicken wings served Polynesian style – Oh god. This was lovely. The wings were perfectly blended in honey with a little chilli to make it sweet and spicy at the same time. It is highly recommended as it did satiate my cravings and palate. ✌✌

• Sasquatch Chicken Burger – It was well presented with salad dressing on ice berg lettuce and was very filling. It had enormous amount of patty and quite some amount of fries. Taste seemed just average to me. The potato wedges were a bit soggy.

• Homemade blueberry pie – The vanilla ice cream dripped from the blueberry pie spoiling the presentation. It tasted average and I would not like to go back for this. The dough was thick but the blueberry tasted good.
=====
Pros:

• Ambiance is nice.

• Location is prime.

• Has a banquet hall on the 1st floor which is quite good for throwing birthday parties and more.

• Presentation as well as taste of few dishes are excellent.

• The steward is courteous.

Cons:

• The service needs to be improved. The person serving us spilled water on the table as he was not well trained and did not know that water should flow from the beak of the jar. Secondly, the issue was with chicken Hawaiian salad where salad was served without chicken. Such negligence should not happen in future.

• The dessert needs to be improved a lot.

• The presentation of the beverage was consistently the same and can be changed and modified.

Meal for two: 500-1200 approximate

American Cave is a brand new cafe with a great menu to offer. I visited this place on numerous occasions and like the food that they serve. 

Corn Veloute soup,  Caesar Salad(chicken),  honey glaced chicken wings,  jumbo prawns provencale,  ferrero rocher thick shake amd cafe melange are my picks from this cafe.

American Cave was an unplanned visit- simply an experimentation that didn't disappoint us. Our order comprised of the vegetarian quesadilla, the daily special- their signature apple pie served with vanilla ice cream and the pineapple fizz as beverage. 
The tortilla of the quesadilla was nothing like a tortilla but had more resemblance to our desi paratha, nevertheless, the filling made up for its fallback. The sour cream with extra lime juice was not a perfect accompaniment considering that I patronise sour cream way too much. 
The pineapple fizz was just perfect- like how it generally is. But I would appreciate some innovation on the same. 
The apple pie would have been perfect if only it was served warm- nothing beats the combination of a warm, fresh apple pie with a significant dash of cinnamon along with vanilla ice-cream. Also, it could have been served in a more appealing manner. 
The staff were courteous, the ambience was not their strongest point but there sure is plenty of scope! A good start, I reckon. 
Overall, the experience was good, but could have been better.

Coming to the food we had ordered iced tea, Caesar salad and Honey glazed chicken.
The tea was just the right sweet and very refreshing. The salad crisp and tasteful and the chicken was lip smacking good. We were pleasantly surprised by the food quality. Price is justified for the amount and quality they provide.

Overall a great experience and I will be definitely visiting the place again to try out other yums from the menu.

Went to this outlet, which is just beside Bidya Bharati school in New Alipore, on a weekday afternoon, for a quick bite in between work. The place is absolutely neat and clean and the staffs courteous and helpful.
Ordered for a chicken Hawaiian salad. It was pretty filling for a single person. The salad was served on a pineapple boat, with the vegetables tasting pretty fresh. The seasoning and dressing was perfect and the amount of chicken was adequate. Overall it was a good chicken salad.

The price however is a little on the expensive side, but they were offering some seasonal discount !! Can try out the dishes here, if you are fond of conti dishes.

Live next door so decided to explore the new place on the block... Like the decor - especially the wooden tables and the mailbox wall. Limited menu options for vegetarians like me but whatever we ordered was flavour full and good to eat. The agli alio was ok, pizza was good. The mushroom stronganoff had yummy mushrooms curry but the pilaf rice was sweet .. A mixing of strange flavours. The blueberry pie was yummy but was cold and personally would prefer vanilla to strawberry ice cream to accompany the same. Good portions though for all items.

Ordered a sasquatch chicken burger from home via a food delivery service. They packed the burger, the colslaw & the potato seperately along with a pouch of mustard sauce. The size of the burger was large & filled with chicken, cheese, onions, tomatoes & other spices & sauces. Tasted quite delicious. But price wise it is expensive.

Wanted to try out their food for a long time. Finally today Swiggy came to my rescue by delivering from American Cave to my home. 
This restaurant is actress Tonushree's first business venture.
Coming to the food , I ordered Cajun chicken sandwich, Crumbed fried fish and Chicken Hispanic Burritos. They came with a side of potato wedges and coleslaw salad and tartar dip. I was a little disappointed though because the menu said fries but instead i got wedges. The food is good, although maybe a little overpriced. Would love to visit the restaurant once soon.

Perhaps one of the best set up places to dine, in New Alipore, American Cave is a new restaurant opposite to the Vidya Bharati School, very close to CCD New Alipore. One of the most positive things about the place is the beautiful ambience. That said, let's come to food.
The menu has various such things that are a rarity in the entire Behala-New Alipore zone, such as Calamari (Buddha Bites Behala serves squid, I heard) or egg Benedict. But most of the time, these are unavailable, so it doesn't make a difference. The food otherwise is bland. We ordered the Honey Glazed Chicken Wings, the glaze tasted like cough syrup.

Went to this place few days back with friends with a pre planned lunch. I was very excited by the name and wanted to see how good the place could be. Located at New alipore better way to reach this place is to go Kolkata Mint just before Taratala and take a left. When stepped in the place gave some positive vibes from the door itself. Classy interiors and attractive decors certainly cheers up your mood. Sitting is been quite nice, with full sofa sitting and decent tables all around the place is not too big as you expect it to be. There’s quite fancy decors like the mailboxes which is to used in the near future for feedbacks as told to us by the Manager Mr. Praveen himself. There you get a LCD TV for your entertainment which plays some mind blowing English songs.

Decent look and feel of the diner can attract you but they are yet to come up to the level in terms of food. Had ordered Lasagna but it was completely runny (liquid) under the first cheese layer, so we had to report it to the waiter who however promptly replaced it with a new lasagna which was better but still not upto the mark. So I must say the staff was very courteous which is hard to find nowadays which puts some positive weight in favour of the place, but unless the food is upto the mark it will be hard to find customers..

Two of us went for dinner last night. For the first 10 minutes we were totally ignored by the staff. No one around to either welcome us in or even offer us water - the basic courtesy every restaurant offers. Finally when we asked for the menu, we were told all the menu cards were "in use". I mean, only 3 tables were occupied then so do you mean to say you only have 3 printed menu cards? The service was awful - extremely slow, and a very apathetic attitude by everyone except for the cashier/manager who did try his best but he really couldnt do much when the rest of the staff seemed least interested in serving us. We ordered grilled chicken breast with rice which came after 45 minutes, and eggs benedict which didnt come at all till we had both finished sharing the chicken in exasperation. Your manager was kind enough to offer us a dessert free of cost but thats poor consolation for a terrible evening. Incidentally, a family who entered after us were also seen complaining about the delay in service.
You have a great combination of an excellent location, as well as the concept of an American themed restaurant. But your staff sadly lack in training and attitude. All in all, a very disappointing experience

I was here last sunday for a pre-planned luncheon with some of the top food personalities of the city. I had had a word with Praveen Roshan, the Manager, and after speaking with him, my excitement about this place only grew. I walked in at around 1:30. The place looked pretty classy, with big sofas at the two corners, a section with some colourful letter boxes, and some very smart looking servers.

For a great food joint, only the ambiance doesn't matter, the factors which makes a restaurant great are their professionalism , etiquette, and the way they are handling customers.
I visited this restaurant  few days back. Ambiance- good , quality - good , service- needs lots of improvement.

They took lots of time to serve the fish and chips, just because they were busy handling few folks from some agency or so. We waited almost for 45 mins to receive the dish on our table.

Today it was much more unprofessional approach from their end, I ordered food from one of the delivery app, but I received the call saying they don't have fish and chips, so I can take grilled chicken breast which comes with rice and veggies. I opted for fries in place of rice or veggies, they clearly denied that they won't do it. Also they told me to cancel the order . This is difference they have with actual professional restaurant like Chillis or TGIF. They won't ever deny the customization upto some mark.

They need to improve a lot, else the rating will go lower day by day.

This was my 2nd visit and I see they have shortened the original menu. Anyway, we took 4 burgers the 1st time we went which was incidentally their opening day. So, we got a complimentary burger and a coke that day. The burgers were good enough. 
Today, we took chicken steak which came with rice and veggies, and a Mexican chicken pizza along with a mocktail and a cafe frappe. 
The steak was good but the pizza was nothing great. 
Would like to go often since its a stone's throw away from my place but this is no cheap place. So, 'occasional-visits' it is.

P.S. - Now maybe a good time to try this place since they are having all day 30% discount!

We ordered one Cafe Frappe, A Triple Decker Non Veg Sandwich and A Chicken Ceaser Salad on our first visit which was today (22.05.16). The Frappe, presented in a mason jar was good and comforting. The Sandwich platter was delicious and the coleslaw that came with it was very fresh and crunchy. The quantity of potato wedges however was too much for us and we couldn't finish them. This single platter is like a full meal for one person and is really filling. The Ceaser Salad was alright. The lettuce could have been fresher and the croutons, crunchier. 
The ambiance is funky, with pop music playing in the background and Hollywood wall art. 
The service and behaviour of the crew was pleasant and the manager visited our table for feedback as well. He mentioned that the first floor of this place is available for small get togethers for a maximum number of fifty people. They don't have home delivery yet but an option of take away can be availed. On a sunday evening, it was pretty  busy and all tables were full but two. I really wanted to try the Poached Eggs Benedict as I have this notion of judging restaurants on the basis of their Hollandaise sauce. But I was told it was for lunch only, even though there was no such mention on the menu about this. I am looking forward to going back for the Eggs Benedict soon.
The number of items on the menu is limited, which has both advantages and disadvantages but being a very new place I am sure they will soon develop their set menu according to demands. Our experience was overall a satisfactory one.

This is the new kid on the block. We were immensely surprised to see this less cafe and more like a restro-bar in the neighbourhood. Although it does not serve alcohol but the ambiance and decor will surely blow anyone's mind. The owners have a done pretty good job to give this cafe a great feel and the atmosphere makes one relax. The food was really good although I have to go there again and taste other items. But overall impression is good. Not to mention the courteous behaviour of the staff. Way to go.

American Cave brings to you a whole new café experience with posh decor and hearty amount of food.

Food Quality: 3/5
Food quantity: 5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Staff: 4/5
Service: 5/5

Location: American Cave is located at New Alipore lane, right opposite to Mamma Mia.

Food: food here is a bit on the expensive side but nevertheless it is really good. The quantity is more than enough. One dish would keep you full for one whole day.

*Chicken Quesadilla: Four tortillas with chicken pieces, mixed vegetables and lots of cheese. This is complemented with a white mayonnaise-like dip and tomato salsa. I'd recommend to share this dish with another person. Two quesadillas alone would leave no room inside your stomach. (3/5)

*Baked Whole Potato: potato with skin baked and served piping hot in a bowl with molten Parmesan and mixed vegetables like corn and carrot. This dish would definitely introduce your taste palette to unfamiliar and underdeveloped flavour understanding. The only downer I'd say was that this dish was a bit on the bland side. It needed a sort of kick of good seasoning. Besides this, everything was perfect. (3/5)

*Fettuccine Alfredo: fettuccine pasta served hot with creamy aflredo sauce. The sauce seemed to have been tossed in butter and cheese, which created the perfect harmony. Pasta was cooked to perfection. All this was served with two toasted breads and was topped with basil leaf. (4/5)

*Grilled Chicken Breasts *Crapaudine*: two succulent pieces of chicken breasts with a glaze served with steamed vegetables (corn, cauliflower, broccoli, carrot). This is accompanied by aromatic rice. Personally, I felt this dish was a bit bland. Pity because the presentation and everything else was splendid.

Management: American Cave should be visited because of its amazing decor alone. They have done a really good job with that. The staff is always seen with a nice welcoming smile on his face. Service takes a bit of time. But it should be taken into account that they opened just a week ago. Well lit. Spot on with their cleanliness. If you're in New Alipore, you might want to try this place out.
