Nice place to go with family and friends. Place is quite small with minimal decor but quite neat.
Pros:Good food and friendly service. Cheapest in Tangra in terms of both food and alcohol. 
Cons:Limited dishes and drinks in the menu.Minimal decor and furnishing.

The thing I like about Lee Garden is that, the people are very welcoming and friendly. 
We had ordered chilly chicken, prawn fried rice and prawn chips. They serve food in 3 sizes, small, medium and large. This helps you to decide according to the number of people you have along with you. 
The fried rice and chicken was good but not that fancy. Its a big place and not properly lighted. Prices were reasonable.

Nice place to go out with friends and the ambience was OKAY, not much crowded

In Soup we ordered Chicken Vegetable Soup which was decent. 

In starters we had Kung Pao Chicken (Recommended) which was pretty nice.

Ending with main course, we ordered Chilli Prawn Gravy with Prawn Rice Noodle, for which I could easily say that Chilli Prawn was not that Chilli and noodle was good enough to keep me going. 

Value for money 3.5/5 
Ambience 2/5
Quality of Food 3.5/ 5 

I was speaking with one of the guys from Lee Garden and they were very friendly and the overall all experience in Lee Garden was not that bad. I can say its definitely an awesome place to hang out with friends when in group.

A NO-GO FOR LADIES ...... YES LADIES & FAMILY PERSONS DON'T GO .........

.THIS PLACE IS PURELY .......... YES ...... PURELY ........ FOR STAGS 

 ( I feel sorry enough for female tippler gangs .... but can't help as the ambiance here is NOT SUITABLE for any female ) 

Why 3.5 / 5 then ????? ........... Let me explain .... if you're the kind which gives 4/5 to Tibetan delight or 4/5 to crystal-chimney ... ( both legendary restaurants , but having horrific location & Zero ambiance ) .... you'll get why i gave 3.5 / 5 to Lee-garden .  Also if you're the Kind who wished that there was a Bar which  served delicacies of tibetan-delight , Tung-nam , crystal-chimney or eau-chew , along with alcohol , you'll surely  get it by now . 

This is the stag version of Kim-ling ........................What ??? ??? ......... kim-ling has a stag section ....... so why go here ??? ..... 

simple ....... because you get the ALL the kim-ling starters at HALF the price .... & what's more ...... TASTE is BETTER than kim-ling ...... also Quantity is more than kim-ling .... 

 " Are you kidding me ??? " ................ the obvious question that comes to mind ......... & No I am not ..... please read the Whole review before drawing any conclusions .... 

LOCATION : lee eating house ( Aka Lee garden ) is located just opposite to Kim-ling ..... maybe 20 metres ahead of Kim-ling ...... 

The kitchen is run by the LEE family ........ & believe it or Not .......... their cooks .... are basically family people of the lee family itself .......... Not Bhutanese / tibetan or local people ..... unlike china-gardens , china-pearl or dan-sin-quin ( just beside golden joy & ming-garden ) 

What kind of people come here ?????? : 

1) Mainly Stag Groups who work in Vishwakarma building ( topsia ) or PS continental ( topsia again ) 

2) Or the Kind of people ( stag groups ) ...... who prefers China-garden / lee-garden over Beijing & Big-boss 

What's with the Kim-Ling connection ???? Any body who Visited BOTH kim-ling & lee-garden will only understand ....... the TASTE is EXACTLY the same ( as Kim-ling ) .... But HALF the price .... what's more ..... quantity is MORE in Lee-garden . 

Let me Do a comparison ....... Same Quantity .... Almost same taste 

Kim-Ling Lee-garden 

Garlic Prawn full plate rs 770 (medium) Garlic prawn Full plate rs 450

szechwan Prawn full plate rs 770 ( medium ) szechwan prawn Full plate rs 420 

& there are plenty more ........ I can Go ON & ON ....... 

 The point is ... If you're a Group of stags ( & STAGS ONLY ) ......... want a taste of Kim-ling starters .... at Half the price ( well... almost ) ......... head straight to Lee-garden ....... 

Coming To the MOST Important Part : ambiance , crowd , cost & my own personal experience 

1 ) Ambiance : Same as Namking , Flora , Chung . or At best China-Gardens 

2) Crowd : Stag groups from Vishwakarma building , local chinese ( all Stags ) & PS continental ( commercial buiding Nearby ) 

3 ) Cost : 

a ) Food : Cheap ( Considering Same Taste as Kim-ling ) 

b ) Alcohol : Reasonable & Economical ( not cheap ) .... 

e.g .... Rs 180 / LARGE PEG VAT-69 ( 60 ml peg ) ..... Rs 200 / large peg Teacher's ( 60 ml peg ) .... Rs 90 / Large Peg ...mcdowell's rum ( 60 ml peg ) & Rs 130 / Large peg Bacardi white rum ( 60 ml Peg ) .... just a few examples ........ cheaper than most yes ...... but then there are Hotwok , Evergreen & Ming-garden ..... which are cheaper ( in alcohol ) 

4 ) MY EXPERIENCE : Went there today for Lunch ...... Along with My Distant cousin ( who stays in PUNE but is Visting his Home in kolkata for 7 days ) 

 " What do you prefer ?? " ..... I ask 

 " Chinese " .... he says 

 " Ok .....Let's go to Flavours of china ( park street ) .... I suggest ... " great ambiance .... great food " 

" but everytime i come my folks & friends take me to Tung-fong , mainland-china or flavours-of-china " ..... " arr kichu nei ??? " he asks ....

" ok .... so what do you prefer more ?? good food or ambiance or anything else ?? " I ask ....

.

" just wanna sit & talk bro " ..... " catching up after 2 years " ..... " maybe a place which allows us to chat for 2-3 hours over a couple of beers maybe " 

" ei re !!! ... serechhe " ..... I say to myself ..... not even CCD allows 3 hours to sit ... ( & no alcohol/ beer in CCD either ) .... 

" china-town jaabi ??? " I ask ..... " kintu No ambiance ... average food & horrible location ( narrow lanes of China town ) " .... I quickly add a warning 

" jekhane hok .... just make sure that they don't Hurry us "........ " & BTW being used to restaurant ambiance of PUNE ( high-end ) ...... I don't think that Kolkata can impress me with Ambiance at-least ..... also I haven't been to Chinatown in 6 years .... sounds like a good idea "

 " Ambiance kintu is worse than it was 6 years ago " ......... I dutifuly warn again ..... 

" boddo bokish tui !! ..... dekha jaabe .... chol na ... just wanna chat ... bollam toh " .... comes the reply ....

And so we head towards chinatown ( once again !! ) 

we reach tangra around 1.15 pm ( afternoon ) today .... being a sunday I thought of going to big-boss or golden joy .... my  cousin however says " chol kim-ling jai ....... I still remember their prawn starters ... when dad used to take us "..... 

" kintu Kim-ling ey ki 3 ghonta boste debe ?? " I remark sceptically .....

" okies .... tahole tui bol .... kothay jawa jay " ?? he replies 

 " either Big-boss , kafulok , goldenjoy ( for ambiance ) ..... or ming-garden , hot-wok , shunli ( for 3 hours ) " ...... I reply 

" oigulu kothay ?? " ... my cousin asks 

" eito just 5 mins away ...... nearby " ..... I say ( by this time our taxi has already reached Kim-ling ) ...... 

" Again 5 mins ?? ..... no way !! ... I am getting down here only ... " my cousin replies ..... " ashe pashe kichhu nei ??? " ...... he looks around after getting down ..... " hey ...... how's that ??? " ...... as he points towards Lee-garden ( lee eating house ) .........

 " I donno ..... doesn't look good " .... as I check the entrance of LEE .... which has a Door ...... which more resembles like an Iron-gate of Soviet era mongolia ... ( those who watch discovery / natgeo .... documentary of mongolia , will understand ) .....

" I think we can have a quiet time here ...... don't worry if i don't like it .... we'll walk out ... & go to those places which you just mentioned " ...... Says my cousin ...... who almost drags me in there ...

I never felt more guilty in my life ...... meeting my cousin after 2 years ....... & that too in Lee garden ??? ... Maybe I should have kept shut & gone to kim-ling .... 

Anyways we enter ............. 

 

First Impression : just like STAG-section of Chung or Evergreen ..... Very ordinary ..... However 1 thing to be pointed out .......... the AC ( or ACs ) was running in Full blast ... immediately felt cool when we entered ..... 

' ahhh really cool in here ..... ' ... my cousin remarks ( probably tired by the journey from Elgin road to tangra ) ....

the decor here is minimal ( typical chinese atmosphere ..... a bit like what tibetan delight  used to be in 1990s .... but not now ) ....... only 7 tables ( yes 7 ) ..... dimly lit ..... probably can accommodate 35 people at a time ( maximum ) .... only 2 male waiters & a female ( middle aged ) cashier ........... that sums up Lee in a nutshell 

So we sat & looked up the menu ..... only 6 stags for company .... a group of 4 & a separate group of 2 ( just like us ) ...... 

& we order ........ Beers though available ...... mostly kingfisher , tuborg carlsberg ... No Bud ...... No heineken ....... my cousin then comes up with an idea .... " let's have rum .... Haven't had rum in ages ..... maybe not since college ..... atleast not old monk or cariba ( mcdowell's ) .... type ........moreover .... amar kono tara nei ..... as long as I reach home before 6.30 pm "

 " Rum !!! at 1.30 pm afternoon !!! .... ore loke pnecho bolbe " .... I say 

" chhar to .... In pune on a sunday afternoon .....if you go to any pub ..... you'll find people drinking rum .... captain morgan  , malibu , Mount-gay .......... yes maybe not old-monk or cariba .......... but rum nevertheless "

I relent.............. we order 3 Large Pegs ( 60 ml ) of Mcdowell's rum along with 2 bottles of cold-drinks ........ 

Turns out to Be a good idea ...... why ????

because after that SAT & CHATTED our hearts out for 1 hour ( yes 1 hour ) ..... before ordering Starters in food ..... & nobody bothered us or hurried us .... Yes nobody even tried too ..... 

After around an hour ... we ourselves felt a bit guilty .... & thought we should order something in food ......

we settle for 1/2 plate Garlic fish (dry ) ..... & 1/2 plate lemon chichen .....

The food arrives in 15 mins ( it seemed so atleast ) .... while we kept on chatting ..... 

the garlic Fish was yummm .............. half plate had 10 pieces ... Taste wise exactly , if not better , than kim-ling 

the lemon chicken was great too ....... had around 12 pieces in half plate ..... never had lemon chicken in Kim-ling ....... so won't compare 

we order another cold-drink to help us with the food ........

by the time we finish the starters ...... 2& 1/2 hours hours have passed.......yes it was 4 pm & we didn't even realize it !!!

Probably because NOBODY bothered us ..... & we were busy chatting anyways ....... 

we really wanted to try the main course ......... prawns specifically ........ but the starters were so overwhelming ( quantity wise ) ..... didn't have an inch left in the belly 

just to give you an example......... 1 starter is good enough for two people ( in Lee ) 

therefore 2 starters were good enough for 4 people ...

& We were only TWO !!! ... in short we were trying to have food which was enough for 4 guys .......... Now that takes some doing ......... regardless , whether one is drunk or not ........

we take another 30- mins to finish our drinks & pay the bill ...........

left around 4.30 ish ......

The bill as expected came to around Rs 820 ( all inclusive ) ......not exactly cheap ...... but we Spent THREE HOURS THERE !!! .....THREE HOURS ..... no joke !!! 

Where in kolkata can one spend 3 hours ... over just 3 pegs ??? ........ i don't know any ..... If YOU know , please inform me ASAP ..... 
So Why i gave 3.5 / 5 ???? ........... simple .... i could have given 3 easily ....
Cheap alcohol ??? ... NO !! 
ambiance ??? .. NO WAY !!! ........ YUMMY starters & the fact that they allow you to sit ( as long as you want ) .... made me give 3.5 

 when I consider the TASTE of food ( just try out if you don't believe me ) .... I am compelled to wonder .......... why do stags go to china-gardens or golden empire ..... just because it's near to beijing ??? ....... could be ....

For more " adventurous " ones .... try out Lee garden ( lee eating house ) ........once ............ KIm-ling QuaLity at HALF the price .......... ...

WHO SHOULD GO THEN ??? : STAG Groups who want to spend 3-4 hours ( minimum ) .... that too having budget of around Rs 500 / head ......... groups of 5 or more ............... the larger the group ........ lesser the cost ( per person ) ........................... those who cannot afford kim-ling .... golden joy ... big boss .... beijing .... but still wants to have SAME QUALITY of food ........... 

who should NOT go ??? : a ) ladies ( for lady tippler gangs i suggest hot wok ) 

                                                     b) groups having only 1 hour time ... ( e.g land up at tangra around 9 pm in evening ????? better stick to bigboss , goldenjoy ) 

                                                     c ) those who want Cheapest alcohol & nothing else ........ better go to Hot-wok or Evergreen 

                                                     D ) those who prefer crowded places ... better go to kim-limg or kafulok .......... this place you'll find 10 people max at any given time ...

 I'll Finish off with my usual bill summary ..... bill for TWO was 820 ...... here's the break up 

  3 ( 60 ml peg ) of Mcdowell's : 3 X 90 = 270 Rs

 3 large bottles of cold-drink : 3 X 30 = 90 Rs

 HALF plate ( 1/2 ) garlic fish (dry ) : = 190 Rs ( 10 pieces )

HALF plate (1/2 ) lemon chicken : =165 Rs ( 12 pieces ) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                                                           total bill = 715 Rs + VAT + service tax 

                                                                           = Rs 820 

Overall Verdict : NO LADIES please ( reasons i have stated many times in this review )

STAG-Gangs who frequent china-gardens or kim-ling ........ may try this place .... PROVIDED you have 4 ( FOUR ) hours in hand .......... otherwise not !!! 

P.S :  A couple of things need to be noted ........................ 

         

         A ) If you visit this place   ( if at all ) ........... make sure it's either for lunch or early evening adda  with fellow stags ..... 

Strictly between 1 pm ( afternoon )  to 5 pm ( early evening ) .......  

   Why ???? ....... because just beside Lee there is an  Liquor Off-counter ....... Donno about others ..... but I myself   avoid EVENINGS ( or late night dinners )   at restaurants / Bars ., having a liquor shop Just beside ..... even In Places like russel street ( Park street area )  had  a incident around 2011  puja time at Sam's Pub ( floriana ) , because of nearby scots ( legendary high-end liquor shop in park street area ) ... & when you  consider  that Park street is the safest place in Kolkata at Night ( even around  12 AM  midnight ) ... You should think twice before  going to ANY place , having Liquor shop , just beside , for late night Dinner .

B)  Since LEE Garden is located near kim-ling ,  there are only few  street lights in this area .... Anybody who visited  Kim-Ling  for dinner ( after 7 pm ) ... will be able to explain you better .... 

I have tried to cover All aspects, in this review .... including , who should go  and who SHOULD NOT .... make sure you read that part of the review , before making a choice .......

Cheers !!!

Oh it reminds me of old days. This was time of transition, when eating out started to change its meaning from hangouts-hangovers to dating. 
But buy then I was totally consumed by Chinatown, so I needed a hideout from my own gang inside Chinatown.

The family dining room of Lee eating house was the answer. One ANSWER to many questions good food, pocket friendly, and absolute privacy. As if no one in the town knows about this place, we lost track of time often there and in some occasions  service people lost track of our existence in there.
