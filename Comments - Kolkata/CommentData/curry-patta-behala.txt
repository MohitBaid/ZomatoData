Would never come back here after what and how they had served us, after my sister had some long hours of fasting due to some tests.

Got 2x Dosas, which was just average and the cost is, too much for what they gave. Slow service and then comes the worst part,

Their sink was not working, so they gave an empty bucket and a mug with water supply from another bucket for washing hands. It smelt worse than a dead mice. Who does this? Who runs this restaurant?

Don't come here guys!

Cozy ambience. Liked their previous decor. A thoroughly veg food place doesn't only have South Indian dishes, they serve pizzas, burgers and dal-puris too. But their tasty South Indian food is the main concern of mine though. üòÅ

Ordered through swiggy, plain dosa + masala dosa + uttapam... And a chutney as an add on... The chutney they sent both the add on and the usual one, was too cold.
Knock, knock. It is winter right here.
If you are doing deliveries. Do it properly. 
Ok, dosas were just so, so. If you are a behala folk, and ever had dosa from new united cafe, you will understand what I am talking about.
Also, can you improve on your packing?? 
I mean, if you are delivering plain dosa and masala separately... Then atleast, make sure that dosas dont get soggy or just stop delivering them. I mean how do you eat a soggy plain dosa.
May be your dosas are good when eaten at the restaurant, but deliveryüòëüòëüòë.

I have never been to such a beautiful South Indian food joint as this one. This place serves tasty and fresh. They also have a spread of ice-creams which are home-made. I just went with the one they recommended, it was delicious but pricey.
Food is affordable though.

Been there couple of times. This place is near to mp birla school and just beside solo ana bangali in behala James long. 
Small place but they managed it quite well. Very few staffs and I think 10 people at a time can seat there. 
I had their veg polao with raita and idli. Veg polao is too good. It's full of veggies and raita which was accompanied it also served it's purpose. Idli was ok. 
If you are in a tight budget and bore with united cafe behala then you can try this place.

Tried the dahi vada from Curry Patta, however as per taste it was OK. They could have make it more tastier. Haven't tried anything else but want to give it a try once specially the dosas.

Cozy interior , speedy service and polite waiters ...this south Indian eatery has it all. Situated opposite M.P.Birla high school ,it is easy to find and after a shopping spree at the brand factory on this Friday afternoon ,,I decided to hit this food joint .I ordered two hot coffees, a cheese chilli masala dosa ( I asked them to make it just cheese n chilly for the same price since I hate masala dosa) , a plain dosa and a sambar vada for takeway. The cheese chilli dosa came hardly with any cheese in it (very disappointing as I take my cheese very seriously) but the rest of the food was yummy. I recommend a visit, but not for a cheesy delicacy.

Ambience: Located just opposite the MP birla school beside the brand factory outlet on James long sarani in the behala chowrasta area, this restaurant is another new addition to the plethora of eateries that have popped up in the chowrasta region. Seating arrangement are well organised with no themes but a standard south indian restaurant offering comfortable seating and lighting throughout. 

Food: Food is pretty well cooked with the Mysore dosas having the extra cream and masala that it needs, and the idlis were soft and juicy. Dahivada is of enough quantity and serves as a good pallate cleanser. Though a bit oily but overall the food satisfies the hunger.

Service: Service is okayish with the waiters getting puzzled while handling the crowds. Probably that will improve with experience. Cash and card accepted. No extra taxes are levied. All the food prices are inclusive of all taxes. Parking available.

PS: Visit this place once at least if u r residing in the area.

Visited this South Indian restaurant a couple of times. Nice ambiance, but the place is too small. The price of the food is justified but its quality. Service could have been better. Its OK to try out, just for a change.

Visited the place at early evening, so there wasn't too much rush. Not sure about the peak hours. Ambience is good but they have tried to do lot of things in smaller place, felt slightly congested. 
Tried Idli and medu vada. It was okay, not so great. Should introduce more variety in dosa's though.

It's a small place with four tables but food and reception is good.Has very simple decoration and ground floor seating arrangement just few blocks from Brand factory.

We had Dhosa and Chana Batura where in the Chana could have been better otherwise a simple pocket friendly joint to soothe the South@ Indian taste buds.@

The place is 2 mins from MP Birla School; on the opposite side of the street. 
We were reluctant to go in, as it's a new place. But I'm so happy we did go in. The dahi vadas were soft and fresh. The ice-creams were delicious, the nolen guru ice cream had the right consistency and flavor.. 
The coconut ice cream could've been a little better. It was vanilla with frozen bits of coconut in them, needed a little more flavor. Still my sweet tooth was satisfied. 
Moreover, light on the pocket and good ambience.
