They are a mockery of a food joint just see their rice menu they have chicken POLOAU written very conveniently just under egg biryani. There is no chicken biryani there. Worst food and even worse menu designing. If you are awake late and you got to depend on a restaurant to have dinner. Don't ever order from here, you will end up throwing your money in the dustbin, better sleep not eating then ordering from such shitty food joints.

Location:A small joint near the 45petrol pump
Service and ambienc: something that u shall totally enjoy on entering is the good music that lifts ur mood  even the staffs are too welcoming and helpful.the place is mostly empty here as it's a newly poped up joint.
Food:went for a hangout with frnds when pockets were cold and we had no better option.we had
1.crispy Chilli baby corn(this was real crispy and perfectly made and a good quantity was served)
2.chkn lat Mai Pai(this was a bit like dry chilli chkn,chkn were surprising too soft inside with a crunchy covering perfectly sauteed with veggies and sauces)
3.dry chilli chkn(this was deinately good and a bit more hot)
4.lucknow biriyani (it complied green rice with 2pieces of chicken and this let our mood down totataly
5.chkn pulao(rice was spiced up red with bits of chkn which also was a total disaster)
6.chkn hakka noodle(this soothed the taste buds)
7.garlic chkn(well this one was too good be it the quantity or the taste)
8.garlic butter tandoori roti and cheese tandoori roti (both were perfectly soft and the size was totally satisfying)
9.chkn bharta(this was the best amongst all)
10.kadhai mutton(it's pieces were so we'll cooked and tender)
11.malai chkn(this also won the heart)
And guess the bill..it came around 1200
A must drop in place if u are real broken and still carve good mughlai food)

It was 9:05 pm in the clock when I posted this review. I ordered(first time) Chilly Chicken(Gravy), consists of 8 pieces, for my dinner. I ordered through zomato online order. It seems that they don't even know how to prepare this preparation. The pieces were like you have to use a magnifying glass to find them. It can better be said as Chilly Cornflour, for there was no trace of chicken in them. As you can see from the photo, they just provided it in a white container, without the name of their restaurant printed on the lid and look at their bill also , it is just a torned paper from a pad with no appropriate details. They should name this preparation of theirs as Cornflour balls with Bengali 'jhol' 

My humble request to all is not to buy anything, a single piece, from this restaurant as it will be a complete waste of money.

This restaurant should be immediately closed. The are serving people perhaps biryani of 2-3 days old, atleast our experience was like that. Yesterday we ordered mutton hyderabadi biryani and chicken biryani. The mutton pieces were foul smelling and their was no taste of biryani at all. They are simply looting people in daylight. So guys please avoid this restaurant. The roadside biryanis are far better than this.

Yesterday night I ordered one biriyani and one chicken pulao. But the irony is they don't understand the difference between the two. When I opened the parcel both biriyani and pulao were looking the same, taste was also same, only difference was biriyani was having a chicken piece and an egg. The chicken pieces in chicken pulao were so much shredded that anyone could hardly see them. Overall a pathetic experience, which not only ruined my Saturday night dinner but the mood also.

Punjabi chicken was horribly sweet and the dal fry was boiled dal that too lacks proper amount of salt and the quantity is poor. Nans were terrible too. You can't even tear it as it was rubbery.

Not worth reviewing, but this is more of a warning for those who do.

Ordered Hyderabadi Chicken Biriyani :  neither was it Hyderabadi, nor was it anything close to a chicken biriyani.It was Mughlai styled rice stuffed with half cooked chicken, with cheap rose water odor. The Chicken was so under cooked, that we had to stop eating literally because of the chewy nature.
Ordered Dal Dry : instead got a near fermenting dal with sour taste and stale rotis. The dal had started to smell, guessing it was cooked long back, heated ,cooled  and reheated, and then some more. Terrible.

If there was a food review audit, this place would be off the charts.

Probably the best food in Garia. I am a resident of Garia. Tried every restaurant but this is unique.
1) Not so popular hence very less crowded
2) Neat and clean nice ambience
3) Very few option in food. Less choice but all are great taste.
4) Must try Tandoori roti with butter and chicken handi masala or hydrabadi biriyani or Varanasi dum alu
5) Hand written bill. No tax. No vat. Only pay for food. Dart cheap.
6) Roti 15/piece. Chicken 145 for 6 piece. Biriyani 200 with two mutton pieces. Dum alu 90. Taste is awesome. We nearly tried to lick the handi for last drop of gravy. 
7) I asked for golap zamoon. They told me that won't be hot. Still I tried. But please try to provide the hot one.

Ordered through a food delivery app veg Fried rice, hot garlic chicken and fish fingers. Starting with the veg rice it was full of black pepper, hot garlic chicken was the worst, the gravy was rotten and was stinking with some pungent smell, chicken pieces was undercooked as can be observed through the photos it was white, they I think half fried it and dipped into some left over gravy, I couldn't eat rather had to throw away all the chicken and gravy coming to the fish fingers it was not bad to taste but the size and the shape doesn't resemble to fish fingers at all. They should work hard in order to improve their quality otherwise they might loose many customers..

Ordered again through zomato garlic naan and kadai paneer both tasted good...I would say their Indian dishes are far better than their Chinese dishes.

Apparently hyderabadi biryani isn't what they said it is. Late night craving turned to a forced feed when the order was delivered. Rice soaked and emanating smell of keora water added to the rice by the restaurant to desperately mimic biryani was futile. 2 bones of mutton was what accompanied a handful of rice in a tiny container with no potato. Not worth being called biryani for 200 bucks. Utterly disappointing experience.

To venture out this newly opened restaurant we stepped in. The decor was okay but the person (a young boy) taking order and serving was very much casual in approach. The sofa had food stains on them. Had to request to change the glass tumbler a couple of times as it contained some grease or stains in it.

We even thought of moving out but stayed back thinking it would be rude from our part.

Ordered Chicken Lawabdaar, Biryani and Tandoori roti for dinner. The chicken preparation was good with 6 medium sized pieces but the Biryani was very oily and wasn't good in taste. Tandoori roti was made with aata instead of maida which also wasn't up to the mark. Overall not satisfied at all.

Shall not recommend anyone to give it a try.
