Ordered for a home delivery tonight..

Chicken Steam Momos - They were average.. have had better
 
Mixed Hakkah Noodles- Even though, the quantity was very good, but too many sauses and much oil, seemed no better than a street vendor and didn't taste too good either.
 
Mixed Fried Rice- Same as the noodles, the quantity was good but lost in taste, was oily n i didn't like it.

Kung Pao Fish (Dry)- The dish had a burned smell n taste.

Kung Pao Chicken- The Gravy was not good, I don't know, but it just didn't taste good.

In a jist, the portion of rice and noodles is good in size but the sides are not. And I'm dissapointed with the taste n freshness of the food. Won't be my choice anymore.

Kinda fell in love with the light on the stomach and authentic Chinese flavour when I first ate from here. 
They serve generously and they do it right. 
Must order, since i am vegetarian- Veg noodles, chilli potato and the shumai. <3

This is my 3rd time i ordered from the fat panda. Must say the quality and taste of the food is very delicious. We ordered for yuk sung, fish ball soup, chilly prawn balls, mixed mei fun and mixed fried rice. Every food was well seasoned and must say quantity is alot as well. I must say they offer unique items which can be tasted abroad. I am sure to order next time very soon. Thanks to the fat panda for giving us the opportunity to taste these food in kolkata.

Had ordered fried chicken wantons, chicken Cantonese noodles, chicken sichuan noodles amd sweet and sour chicken. All of them lacked salt. The quality of the food did not match the price even though the quantity was a lot. May not order again.

It is the only place on kolkata to find authentic Asian cuisine from a chef who's family has a reputation for over 60 years.  They have pioneered some of the most delicious mouth watering hakka food the city has every tasted.
