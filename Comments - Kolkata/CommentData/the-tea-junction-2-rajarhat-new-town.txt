Opens early. If you reach CC 2 before 10 be assured to get some food from here. Too pricey though uet good and prompt service. There's  a place yo sit and have the food you ordered. Perfect in one word!!

The tea and coffee are so refreshing and tastes good. The snacks are also so good but the price range is a little bit high. But overall it is a good place to spend with friends.

Located at the ground floor of cc2 jus opposite the ccd outlet, one will find this place mostly crowded.. Have been to this place many times..seating area is not much.. Hardly few places to sit n they are mostly occupied.. Food quality is ok OK.. Pocket pinch is not much.. One shud give it a try at least be with friends or family on a fine evening..

Had a morning #MasalaTea & #JamCake today, ummm... ate many times the Masala Tea since the 'The Tea Junction' has come to exsitence but tried the hot yummy Jam Cake of it for the first time really its too good and so soothing which ultimately escalates none other than it's taste and fluffiness to be melt for while having itüòã
And have to mention here every other available food option is also great!üëç

Small place. No such seating available.Only 5-6 people can. So, definitely, its bad bcoz you can't have grilled sandwiches gulped while standing.¬† The tea and chicken sandwich was fine. Better outlets available.

I have been a tea aficionado forever which makes me visit several cafes and places serving teas. Not to forget those roadside tea-stalla too. Have had tea from 'Tea Junction' both at Kolkata and Siliguri. I remember enjoying my sip a lot. But, today I disappointedly writes this because the quality of tea has degraded exponentially. In the last 2 months, I have visited the tea junction at CC2, but all those times, it were a waste. The masala tea doesnt have any masala flavour at all and most importantly it doesnt taste like TEA at all!! Tea junction, people come to you with a happy heart to rejoice their cup of tea. Don't let us down..

The resort to place when you crave for hot tea after some shopping. But its tea is nothing to boast it. They serve ready made tea out of the flask, which is not you would like to. Common guy's give some importance to your main product.

Also disappointed with the lack of options available in tea section for a place which has tea as its USP. Also sandwiches are packed in plastic, don't know when it is packed.They just grilled a packed sandwich when ordered. Cheese corn sandwich I ordered had no cheese just mayo and mayo.

The thing I just love here is the ambiance, the open area seating in the middle of a mall is what I go for at tea junction.

Best part being ample seating space around to enjoy your Tea.

The Masala Tea they serve here is just phenomenal with nice flavour and rich aroma.

Give a try to their Apple Cake and Chinese Samosa.
I feel they definitely should have more appropriate varieties of Tea available in their menu.

Prices are like, these day you already know when 12 Rs cold drinks are sold for 50 to 60 Rs inside malls , then obviously you can spend that much accordingly here too

There was a time when I used to visit Tea Junction solely because of the Masala Tea which tasted daunting. The time I am talking about is 5 years back. Nowadays, The Tea Junction has definitely lost its charm and so did the Masala Tea.
I do not visit any outlets of it, but at times need to be there just because the one along with you wishes to. 

The advantage of this outlet is the sitting area which is small but enjoyable, but, if someone wanna use the opposite site for relaxing, the first thing to order comes from this outlet as its very accessible.

Located at ground floor of City Center - II, Rajarhat, this particular brand got famous due to its Masala Tea. With its original outlet at City Center - I, Salt Lake, where I had dropped in multiple times since its inception, this particular brand too keeps up to the reputation established by its predecessor. The ambiance here is absolutely nil with the rest of the items (mainly food items) being kinda overpriced. However, if you are around and craving for nice cup of tea, this is the place you should drop by to try their 'Masala Chai'..!

Really enjoy their masala tea..their samosas n their veg sandwiches (if left).. The small kiosk in pretty popular in our office circuit!
It of course hurts to pay so much for a small "Bhat" of tea but I suppose all's well that ends well!

**Location**
The outlet is located at city centre 2 Rajarhat just when you enter the mall.

**Ambiance**
The build of the tea junction outlet is really very nice and I quite an innovative one too. 
Truly amazing..

**Food**
The tea is their speciality of course but you get beverages too.. Though they are veg but still it is fresh and quality one...
I like their desserts too ... 

All in all I like this stall and specially the sitting arrangements.

From this outlet in the ground floor of City Centre 2 I drank their masala chai and ate the vegetable cutlet as far as I can remember. The masala tea of The Tea Junction is really a refreshing and relishing brew with a tinge of masala that leaves me satisfied every time I drink it. During winter a cup of the spiced tea often served in long earthenware cups keeps one warm from the chill and cold.

Location: City Centre 2.

The Tea Junction has managed to come a long way and hardly needs an introduction.
People find this place synonymous to decent tea and quick bites to compliment along at snacking hours.

‚Ä¢ The ambiance here?
There isn't any ambiance as such, just a kiosk near the stairs in the open area with its own seating arrangements.

‚Ä¢ The food & beverages here?
Average enough, but, nothing exceptional as such.
Happened to try the masala tea which was decent enough and the vegetable puff which was served straight from the microwave, was soggy and had a weird smell to it. 

‚Ä¢ Any recommendations?
Yes.
- Black Tea (Earl Grey).
- Masala Tea.
- Iced Lemon Tea.

* The recommendation list is subject to change on the basis of future visits.*

‚Ä¢ Usual rates?
The rates here (except the mineral water bottles which are charged above the MRP) are reasonable enough and one wouldn't feel a pinch. 

‚Ä¢ Service standards?
The not-so-polite staff served at a prompt speed.

‚Ä¢ Verdict?
An average place to energize yourself. One could opt for the better options available nearby, but for the tea, this place can always be considered.

Been trying their Masala chai on a number of visits whenever I come to City Center 2 Rajarhat as its on the ground floor beside afraa deli and ccd . They have a huge demand of hot steaming masala tea in mud tea cups also called bhaad which definetly makes the experience of drinking tea better .

There isn't any particular seating available however there is those big slabs made surrounding the outer part of the outlet as well as the front portion has some steps to sit on as you can get a whole view of the mall sitting and having a hangout session with your friends and sipping some nice tea . I have tried there sandwiches , chinese samosa,coffees, other snacking stuffs but I always tend to stick to the masala tea in all my orders that I have made in my visits.
The service of the place is quite quick too but I don't see a happy face serving food or tea over here as always they are in a rush to bill, collect slips and serve so that's like a fast movement of ordering here so nothing interesting there however its a great place for the big tea pots in the city as its something which u usually don't get to have at home as there is their special way of making tea which will make you want to visit this place again soon .

Smartly placed in a cozy center at City Centre 2 Rajarhat, it does what is says. Snack and drinks is what it serves. But its more known for the tea which are of various types. I found it just okay as it was overpriced for the quality. Not a tea lover anyway. A place to hang out. Simple.

Despite all the positive reviews, here i am with some not so good experience over there. And this review is not for the one and only time experience. It has been repetitive. I dont find the staffs to be bit interested in serving you. Be it morning, day,afternoon,evening,post evening the keep asking for changes and if you have gone their just for tea, u ll be paid no solid attention. Nextly, they often confuse the orders. Serve low quality food. Other outlets of tea junction are really way better than this one.

Small and open place. Cakes and sandwiches are good quality. But i think their beverages are a little expensive, and they should have their stools and sitting area a little organised. Overall nice joint to drop in for tea or coffee in between work.

I went for a morning show at Cc2 and this was the only shop open. The tea was good but I have had better tea than this one in small tea shops. I really loved the sandwitch, it was fresh and very tasty. An ideal place to have tea and relax in Cc2.

By far, my favorite Tea Junction outlet in town. Situated right beside the entry stairs to the City Center 2 mall, this one has good comfortable seating arrangements, wide open sky above and us perfect place for an adda session. The rates are similar to their other outlets and the service is as smooth. Nothing out of order here and everything looked fine to me.

We went to this place on a lazy sunday.Quite easily locatable in the centre of the mall.

We ordered the masala tea and black coffee.

Masala tea was quite good and whenever I happen to visit this place I opt for this item(and also the cheapest on the menu).The black coffee was made good,but this thing I dont like.

We already went to there City centre brunch several times, and recently visited this outlet, located inside the hang out area, in city centre, rajarhat. The servs very good masala tea. and my husband loves it. though 30 rs/- is little higher in respect of a cup of tea in kolkata, still you can give it a try. They also sells good quality cakes, pastries, brownies, puffs etc., which yo may like too.

FLIES. ....yes Friends Now this place is very very disgusting and full of flies. ....and you can see the dustbin beside you open and packed up with rubbish everywhere.  I think you don't want to share you foods and drinks with these flies of " the tea junction " . So CC2 tea junction 100 times thumbs down.

Located in city centre 2 in rajarhaat, this is a good place to have snacks overlooking the beautiful rajarhaat highway! Come here after sunset and it's a rather pretty sight. 
Tea Junction has many outlets and has definitely made a name for themselves for their "chai". The tea and the different variety of teas spoils you for choice. As for the other snacks like samosas they could definitely improve a little bit. I love their hot and juicy gulab jamuns! It's surely a treat for the taste buds but again their sandwiches needs some serious attention. Even the grilled sandwiches tastes bland and that's something very serious and should be looked into. It's a good place for some adda and good snacks, but as far as I am concerned I really think their range of snacks and especially their taste and can do with some major improvement.

Tea junction is one of my favourite place .. Their "desi and casual" look will surely attract you .. Their masala tea is simply outstanding .. my favourite is choco fudge brownie which is too too awesome .. their ambience is so good and on a gloomy day what else is going to be best .. all in one a Down to earth place .. ‚ù§

Chances are that their desi, casual look will attract and charm you. Tea Junction has carefully designed that down-to-earth, basic look and feel: simple orange-and-
brown colour theme, with ethnic moda seating on the ground floor. This tea bar has been around for some timebut it's only recently that their presence has been felt
and appreciated. After all, who can resist the charm of sipping chai from a totally rustic bhanrer cha (clay cups) and especially in a mall? There are snacks too. Their hot Kesariya Chai goes rather well with samosas.
The attraction remains the addas with like-minded friends over the bhanrer chai, a typical Kolkata experience.?‚òï

Tea Junction - Perfect point for a quick bite.
Tea Junction has got 2 joints in City Centre 2 itself, one at the ground floor near m3 and the other one is situated on the top floor at Hangout!.
I visited Tea Junction uncountable times so I will be able to tell you about all their dishes flawlessly.
They have got one quandary, most of their dishes are not available most of the times.
Menu
1. Chocolate Temptation - Delicious.
2. Cold Coffee - Quite Classic.
3. Chai Toast - Always Unavailable. Never got the opportunity to try it out.
4. Cookies - Good. You can have them with the tea or coffee.
5. Cutting Chai - Always Unavailable. Never got the opportunity to try it out.
6. Nimbu Chai - Bad. Not suggested.
7. Masala Tea - One of my favourite items from Tea Junction. Must try.
8. Hot Chocolate - You'll get it if you are lucky enough. Once I was and it was quite pleasant.
9. Black Tea - Nothing exceptional.
10. Regular Coffee - Average
11. Cafe Latte - Always Unavailable. Never got the opportunity to try it out.
12. Gold Cappuccino - Always Unavailable. Never got the opportunity to try it out.
13. Iced Lemon Tea - Good.
14. Samosa Indian - Good.
15. Samosa Chinese - Not that good.
16. Vegetable Patties - Quite good.
17. Vegetable Chop - Great taste.
18. Oreo Muffin -¬†Superb!
19. Jam Cake - Awesome!

I have examined these dishes again and again so I can't be wrong about this. I am not including the ones I am quite certain about.

Pros -
Cheap
Food
Quick service

Cons -
All dishes are not available.
So you need a quick bite and you are tight on your allowance? Perfect. Go to Tea Junction.

I like this CC2 outlet more than any other Tea Junction outlets & the credit goes to the sitting arrangement for sure...........The round stairs & the soothing environment over there are just perfect for 'Chai-Time Gup-Shup' with you friends.

Masala Tea is a pure bliss when you are tired of shopping ;)

Our experience with this place happened while one day we were terribly hungry when we came for a morning show at the Inox. No other food outlet was open at that time, and there was a person at this outlet who said though the outlet is not officially opened, he could provide us veg sandwiches. That was a huge relief back then. And afterwards we made it a custom to eat sandwiches here before catching a morning show. The corn & cheese and BBQ sandwich were delightful. The Tea here is quite good also. Now the outlet remains fully open during morning keeping in mind the demand of the movie goers.

A 'bhaar' of masala chai accompanied by some comfy seating, what else do you want on a gloomy cloudy day! We went by Zomato's menu card, but it seems that is a bit outdated now, the prices have gone up. Like, Cafe Latte is now 35/- and not 30/-, etc. Anyway, I think the masala tea was good, the Cafe Latte was okay as well. We also had Chinese samosa which had a rather hard crust, the inside stuffing was okay though, some nice out -of-the-box Indo-Chinese collaboration! But the worst part was the Cold Coffee which is not at all recommended, it really looks good and inviting, but leaves a very bad taste in your mouth and I could only take a few sips before throwing away the rest, it's too bitter for a cold coffee with a texture which is not smooth. But if you want to hangout with your loved ones and sit the way you like anywhere around the place with some cafe latte or tea, this is where you should be. But remember, the place remains heavily crowded during weekends and even you'll have to stand in queue in front of the cash counter, though we found the service is prompt enough and we got the food quite fast.

A pleasant cloudy weather demands for a hot drink along with some fried items. So did the same yesterday evening and took a one masala tea along with chinese samosa my friends opted for normal samosa. The stall was on a high demand as we had to wait for around 10 mins to get our tea and another serving of tea also made us wait . The tea was just getting disappeared from the stalls. The service and staff both were nice...Overall a nice experience...
