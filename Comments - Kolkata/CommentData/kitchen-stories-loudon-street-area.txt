Goodness! Heard so much about this place and I was so disappointed after visiting this place. Came here for some desserts after snacking at Workaholic since this place is located close. I have always thought of coming here attracted by the pretty decor from outside. The options were too limited. Took the Red Velvet Brownie. That was pathetic by taste. It looked extremely red. Seemed to have been dipped in blood. The frosting on top was worse. It tasted like some chunky cream as found in pastries from some local shop. And they have torn books from the middle and swung them on the wall as a part of the decor. Severely condemn this act as a symbol of tastelessness. Not at all recommended. Never going to visit again.

Petite and neat, the exact words to describe this small bakery. The bright yet soothing decor with books stitched to the wall just adds to the elegancy.
I would Like to associate this place with desserts mainly. From cheesecakes to birthday cakes, Red velvet jars to customized cookies they know how to get their sweets right.
As for savory I would take mention of the claypot rice and laska. The dips are one of a kind.
The pocket pinch might seem a bit high but it stores quite a treat for the vegetarians.

Visited this bakery during the weekend for the first time. Located on the ground floor of the buldg Meera Guest House beside big boss hotel - opposite to Rawdon Street cookie jar. Love their cozy interior with books stacked on the walls and amazing tiered wedding cakes decorated beside the entry door. I would recommend the dessert lovers who crave for sweet tooth to try out their baked alaska and browmie mousse - just simply out of the world, so so delicious. In terms of savories they only have the veg items. Rates are bit on the higher side, but its really worth it.

Found a good combo deal on the Little app and hence decided to check out this place with my friends today. The cafe looked very cute from inside and outside. It was decorated like a cute little bakery. Upon telling them about our deal they said that it's not valid anymore. Since we had already bought it they tried to accommodate us after some requesting. Our combo deal included veg Mexican rice, Mexican veg rolls(it looked like spring rolls) and caramel custard. The lack of seating area was very off putting for us and we had to eat the food by standing outside the cafe. Nevertheless,the food was nice and was a tiny bit of a saving grace for us. The rice along with the gravy and baby corn and broccoli tasted nice. The spring rolls were something different and were alright too. The caramel custard was very good and they had given ample caramel syrup to go with it. Overall, the experience was good,with a few glitches.

Hello. I was browsing the menu and checking out your photos. Went through the entire selection. I was looking for Burmese food and your tagline said you serve Burmese? Which of your dishes are Burmese?

Had been meaning to try this place for long. Ordered food via a food delivery service from here. This review is based on my delivery experience.

Order-

- Chilli garlic noodles with veg manchurian. It came neatly packed in a food grade container. The noodles tasted good with a dominant garlic flavor. The chilli came in from the red chilli's added in the noodles. The machurian was cooked well. It was soft and not chewy and tasted good.

- Salted Praline was a salted praline mousse tart. It was delicious! The salt flavor in between sweet mousse worked very well!

The prices are decent and I am definitely trying more stuff from here and in person!!

Couple of years ago, an idea of opening a bakery in this city, which also caters to customers looking for some fresh staples for their own kitchen, would have been hard to conceive. But since then, Kolkata has seen a turnaround of events with demand for such places increasing many folds. Such an out-of-the-box place is Kitchen Stories.

Located on Loudon Street, near La Martiniere School, beside Big Boss Hotel, this cute little joint is right there in one of the posh areas of Kolkata. Such a great location being a boon to business also is a challenge in camouflage, as catering to needs of high end customers requires maintaining quality service. So far so well, Kitchen Stories has done a good job keeping up and remaining true their name.

As the name signifies, the joint embodies elements of various stories related to both culinary and social aspects of the place. But then the ambience inside is nothing short of a fairy tale in itself. In complete contrast to the scurry of life outside, the vibe inside is very soothing. The interiors comprise of items apt for the décor of a place with such calmness and purity. A lot of thought process has been put into the décor which is clearly visible.

As said earlier, despite being a bakery, one can also find fresh staples which are required by chefs as well as homemakers, looking hone their cooking skills at home. Not only this, you’ll find Chinese and European cuisines here as well. Plus it is a pure vegetarian outlet.
