I went to this outlet yesterday, the decor was very attractive. It's newly opened so i found this place quie t clean and hiegenic... i went to pick up some sweets for my daughter and i packed some rasgulla's for her. When i came back home i found that the rasgulla's were very hard and they were falling apart already.
This happens usually when the sweets are not fresh.

My experience was not good, i did'nt try their snacks section yet. Not sure if i'll go back again.
