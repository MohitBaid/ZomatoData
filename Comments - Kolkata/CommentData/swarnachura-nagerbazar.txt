The food is really good. Nice service. Had a good time. Chicken items were a treat to eat. I would recommend everyone to have the food. All the best.

I don't know how this restaurant is rated so low. Located just opposite of New bharat sweets of babutala branch, this restaurant serves indian as well as chinese dishes.

Went here with my cousins few days ago for lunch and tried their chinese dishes. Well to be honest Swarnachura did not disapointed us. The ambience was comfortable with pretty spacious sitting arrangement and the staff was also very courteous.Â 
We ordered Crispy Fried chicken as a starter and chicken fried rice and barbecue chicken as the mains.The quantity was huge for every dishes. Crispy fried chicken tasted really delicious.Barbecue chicken though was a bit spicy still went well with the rice. Pocket pinch was very much affordable. Would definitely visit again.

The restaurant serves chinese and indian food. The ambience good. Both Chinese and Indian food's quality and taste is good here but the major drawback is their service and interaction.

This restaurant is very hard to find, as per its location. Just near Nager Bazaar market area, it can be found only if you walk with your eyes, viewing every nook and corner. With a ravenous stomach and vouching we can eat anything, entered this one with a hope to eat Chinese. We ordered Chili Baby Corn, Fried Rice and Schezwain Chicken. As good as it may sound, going by the huge quantity, we wished we never entered here. But beggars are not choosers! The Baby Corn was filled with red sauce, even the chicken. Just 2.0 will be enough to proclaim what I feel.

A nice pocket friendly restaurant for all. Quality and quantity is very good specially Chinese items. It is very close to Nager Bazar More. Very easy to locate. Must try.

a good place for a 'then and there' sort of plan.. very much pocket friendly.. service is bit slow but food quality and quantity makes up the slow service. Staffs are well behaved. Though the area is over crowded and the entrance does not give a well enough 'first impression' but the food has the chance to impress the foodie. the foodies can give it a try definitely. Seating is also available..

I dont know about the restaurant service when you happen to actually sit there and have your food.. but when it comes to ordering food online.. I suppose the quantity is too low.. like we were 3 ppl ordering a Veg thali.. that included rice, 2 seasonal curries, papad, chutney and dal.. and a paneer butter masala... rice was sufficient for 3 ppl. They packed it separately in three different containers. However they packed the dal and two curries separately in a small bowl for three people.. For us the quantity was low and the curries were too oily.. you could see the oil floating like river on the top.. nearly 1/3rd of a cup. Thankfully we order the paneer which was tasty enough and sufficed

Have been there for breakfast and was happy with the food and service...   Pocket friendly place where anyone can go anytime... For a resturant it is very small and is not very beautifully decorated but its nice

Ordered veg fried rice and chilli paneer. Was bowled over by the sizes of paneer (6pcs were there). 
Great value for money. The only turn off was too many peas in the fried rice. 

Will surely consider them when ordering with budgetary constraints.
