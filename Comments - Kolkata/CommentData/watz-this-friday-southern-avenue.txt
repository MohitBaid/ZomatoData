We went there last night.. nothing too special about the interiors or the ambience.. good service.. the food is really good here.. we ordered tomato soup which come with toasted croutons (namesake), soup was yummy, cheese garlic bread.. i found the bread too thin, mongolian noodles in Manchurian sauce, it was amazing, and the dal makhani with butter naan.. was the star of the evening..
Great food.. but a little overpriced..

The place quite empty for a Saturday evening is a surprise but it can all be related to the pricing factor when a comparison is to be made with other all veg restaurants.

Definitely the food assortment is unique and different and tasty but the price and the portion size do not quite go hand in hand

If one is a food freak a must go place to try out 

The con: I find the prices on the unjustified side

A hidden jewel I must say and one of the best Italian food I ever had in my life.

I would have love to give a perfect 5. I cut 0.5 just for an average interiors and presentation.

We ordered 3 items and it's difficult to say which one was better than the other.

1. Herenso Okono - spinach crepe with creamy pepper sauce. AWESOME

2. Veg Deluxe Pizza - just amazing

3. Risotto ala sun dried tomato - fantastic

Will definitely go in my next visit to Kolkata.

Nothing much to say about them.
The service wasn't up to the mark. Unfortunately when we entered they had work going on inside the cafe.
The food we ordered possibly not excellent choices; Pot Shots and Paneer Tikka on Malabari Parantha ..
The portions served were too less compared to the high price and the items tasted average.

All Veg boutique food joint beside Vivekananda Park - lively hygienic ambiance- extremely courteous and helping stewards - great assortment from conti-medi-panasian-Indian menus.

Price you may find more economic if you go in group and share the food.

They also offer Conti-Pan Asian dishes which are cooked as per Jain definition.

They have a separate room for small private parties for which you only pay for the consumables. 

Soon they are going to start live BBQ, keeping winter in mind.

Will definitely recommend others and will be on top of my wish list to visit soon...

P.S. 
And next time I must get a pack of frozen Momo from them. You may try as well. But it will be Veg if you take it from here.

They offer Non-Veg frozen momos in the name of 'Naughty Bites' at selected multiplexes & hypermarkets.

Watz This Friday is a small, quirky cafe located behind vivekananda park in southern avenue, if you know southern avenue it's not too difficult to find. It's a decent sized cafe with seating inside divided into two areas and one very small seating on the outside which would be perfect during winters.

Coming to food, they have tandoori momos which are pretty tasty, the pad Thai is amazing and the peanut flavour is great! 

But the most amazing part is the desserts, especially the heavenly mud, it is absolutely mind blowing! I've been to this place, just for the desserts and it's always been worth it. The blueberry cheesecake is pretty darn good too, but, one thing to note is that sometimes the heavenly mud is unavailable, so ask for one as soon as you're seated :P

Date of Visit : 17/09/2016

Location : Southern Avenue, beside Vivekananda Park. As I am not that familiar with roads in southern avenue, I used the help of google map. 

Ambiance : Average ambiance with a small seating capacity of around 20 people.

Service : From entering the restaurant to exiting, we were well taken care of. Staffs are polite, prompt and well trained.

Food & Description : It was the occasion of a birthday treat of a foodie friend of mine. With so many restaurants popping up now and then, its hard to decide the place where the food is good and we get empty table for a group of 10. But this place was empty when we reached and the food was great. Coming to food items –

Cheese Dumplings with Salsa Dip : Cheese Dumplings were crunchy from outside but melts in mouth. Salsa dip goes well with cheese dumplings.

Khau Suey – Fantastic Khau Suey. For khau suey, the essesntial thing is its coconut milk curry should be great. It was excellent here. Accompaniments like paneer, garlic, fried onions, nuts, olive oil etc added flavour to it. Highly recommended here.

Thai Green Curry with Steam Rice : Thai green curry was delicious. It has exotic vegetables and was apt spicy to my liking. It went well with Steam Rice. Steam Rice portion is high compare to Thai green curry.

Mangolian Rice : Stirfried veggies cooked in Manchurian Sauce along with rice was spicy and extremely tasty.

Veg Lasagne : It consisted of twin layers of pasta sheets filled with assorted veggies & spinach cheese mix and baked with lots of cheese. It was perfectly baked and tasted marvellous. Highly recommended here.

Overall it was a great experience. It was pleasant for find to a pure veg restaurant serving different cuisines. Excellent Food and prompt service is the highlight of my visit. Highly recommended.

Small and nice place to go have some khao suey as its nice here atleast from places we tried in kolkata. The hospitality is good too. You might just rush into a friend if you walk in here often. Over all the food is ok may be we walked in without thinking how it's exactly going to taste. Good going keep it up!

LOCATION:

Situated in a bylane adjoining Vivekananda Park where the the cricket training academies are located. The diner has a good frontage so you wont miss it especially with its painted windows.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

While the exterior of the diner was well made, the interiors somehow did not meet my expectations. It was neat, clean and fresh but lacked a wow factor. More accurately put, the interiors are decent but could have been so much more. Seating is comfortable and split between two sections. The front section is slightly larger and there is a room behind the front section which can house another 20 guests. The diner is strictly vegetarian with the extremely reliable formula of splitting it between Asian, Italian, Mexican and Comfort food.

WINE & DINE:

We called for Cheese Fondue, French Fries, Spinach Crepes and Steamed Momos for starters followed by Veg. Khawsuey and Thai Green Curry for mains.

The Cheese Fondue was comforting and good. The fondue itself was cheesy, well seasoned and not overtly thick in texture which is exactly how it should have been. It did not have a dash of wine but then I dont think most of us really appreciate that in our fondue here in Kolkata, so that was acceptable. It came with diced toasted bread, apples, boiled vegetables and crisps. I did not get the concept of giving lays crisps with the fondue as it was a mismatch. Baby potatoes would have been a better and more authetic option. But the rest of it was quite good.

French Fries were again good and I was happy to see that they did not serve the typical McCain's fries which most places do.

The Spinach Crepes were the pick of the lot with very nice Asian Sauce over the crepes which lifted the dish and added a great flavor to it. For me this dish came as a surprise as the flavors were quite authentic and the crepe itself was soft and melting in the mouth.

The Steamed Momos were honestly disappointing. They were quite typical and we were served 5 small dumplings for almost Rs. 200 which was far too expensive.

Khawsuey was average. I found the gravy itself lacking in flavor which the neat set of condiments served to us along with could not make up for.

Thai Green Curry was ok. It would help to make it a little richer with more coconut Milk. I found it to be lacking in density which diluted the flavor the the familiar aroma of a great Thai Curry.

Service was good and polite. The stewards greeted us with a smile and we enjoyed our meal in peace. 

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

Food  was a mixed bag between great, ok and not so good. Consistency in food would really help this place develop a good repeat value.

VERDICT:

Try the spinach crepes if you are around the area. They are worth the trip !

Been there more than 4-5times with friends & families...Very nice hangout joint for friends and families. Located in a very peaceful area near Southern Avenue Vivekanand park. Though tad a bit small but neatly managed.. Has parking outside for 4-5cars at the most and more than that you gotta be prepared for a bit of walk to the place.

It's a full vegetarian restaurant and they have a separate menu for JAIN food (food prepared without onion or garlic).

The dishes are well done and taste good as well..pizzas are thin crust and sizzlers are also very good.

Overall a very good place.

Totally disappointed with the veg sizzler home delivered to my sister in her birthday tonight . Had specifically even spoken to them that despite their review would like to try them out and ensure it's well made. Yet this just seems so disappointing at first sight and was an equal let down. Never ordering again ever. And to pay 450/- for this roadside looking dish. What a let down

Visiting this place was the outcome of a lazy Friday and the curiosity of trying out something new! 
And believe me this place is great! 
I went there with family for dinner. 
Located right along the boundaries of Vivekanada Park, this place has great interiors and very polite staff. I'm lucky to visit this place before it will be famous in coming months. 
We ordered cheese fondue, tandoori momo, veg sizzler and, to wash it down, a pitcher of Virgin mojito. 
The fondue dip was perfect in consistency with right amount of herbs for the flavour. The bread crumbs were crisp. Alongside came apples, some veggies and chips. 
Next came tandoori momos, a dish that is getting popular nowadays. The momo filling was nice and the kebab coating was not too over powering. The coriander sauce was also flavoursome. 
The veg sizzler had a Patty of mixed vegetables. And the rice was served separately unlike the usual which come on the  sizzling plate. Came with a garlic sauce which was nice too! 
The pitcher of Virgin Mojito was sufficient for 3 people. 
We were too full to order a dessert and so didn't order any. 
In a moment one of the waiter turned up and asked us to pick a chit from a fish bowl. And then there was  "Complimentary Dessert" written on it and in no time we were served a beautiful and savoury Brownie with chocolate sauce! 
We were so full yet the dessert just complimented the meal so well! 
This place is a must visit and I'm definitely going there again! 
I just wish they keep up with the quality!

Friday lunch at Watz This Friday- A cosy small place across Vivekananda Park which has great food! It's a delight for Vegetarians, and it has a pretty thick Jain menu too. So much of variety all at one place. So we tried a mocktail,  the Aglio olio pasta which was really really good, followed by the folded Calzone Pizza which was oozing with cheesy goodness. Also ordered the Chocolate Quicksand (photos attached) which was a treat for the eyes as much as the taste buds! Oh and since it was a friday I guess, we also got a chocolate brownie as a freebie xD
Would love to go back again and try more things!

I really like the food at this place. Though the place is slightly small and sometimes the service also gets little slow, but they never compromise on their food quality which matters the most (from what I have experienced over the time).

Slightly overpriced , but it covers up with the standard of their food quality.

Must try - Pan Tossed Momos.

We had so much that I cannot describe. We tried so many things that we were full till the last empty space in our stomachs. We had Cheesy nachos, Pot shots, Champinoes agillo, herb chilli potato sizzler, cheese fondu, choco quicksand.

Let me tell u everything was amazing and mind blowing. Simply delicious. Marvelous. The place is small like any other place in southern avenue but well made. People are also helpful. Service is also good. Entrance is also good. There is also some outdoor seating as well.

The only issue we had was with the air conditioners. Either they made the place too cool or they made the place too hot. The people there did not know how to put off the blower or put it up. Rest everything was fine. Even the seating was spacious. Food was amazing and simply a delight for our bellies.

A must try for any foodie in Kolkata. Highly recommended.

Located at an unassuming place, beside Vivekanada Park, it will take crossing some lanes and cutting corners to reach there. Though once you have reached, it’s a completely different story.
The name itself is so catchy, it never sounds as if this place can be a normal European styled café. You’ll find a quirky black board outside adorned with colourful palm prints, which can be an ideal spot for selfies. The gatekeeper extended us greetings as we entered which is a rare gesture at cafes.
I found the interiors to be glamorous with uncommon selection of furniture and bricked wall composition. The lighting is on the dimmer side. That can be brightened to encourage a more cheerful mood. The seating capacity is limited to a brisk 15-20 people. There is also a small room tucked away in the corner which can be booked for private parties.

Being a pure veg restaurant, it sounds as a haven for vegetarians. And it surely is. This place serves one of the best European & Italian cuisine in the city.
★    Calzone : This was so awesomely good. Definitely one of those top grade pizzas that you’ll rarely find in Kolkata. The presentation was so different. It’s a folded pizza stuffed with onion, bell pepper, American corn, olive and jalapenos and molten cheese oozes out with every bite.

★    The Primavera : The pasta primavera is a dish that consists of pasta and vegetables. The spaghetti had been cooked to perfection. This is the most uncommonly available pasta with generalised creamy cheese sauce and onion, bell pepper, babycorn, black olive, jalapeno and American corn as topping. The pasta was nice to say the least.

★    Cottage Cheese Sizzler : The sizzler platter consisted of fried cottage cheese patty, which were sort of paneer kebabs, sautéed vegetables, namely bell peppers, babycorns and capsicum, and spaghetti. The cheese patties were well cooked and the veggies were tasteful. The spaghetti was also satisfactory.

The service was smooth throughout. All the three main courses were brought to us on time without any delay. It’s a shame such a nice restaurant remains empty on evenings. The menu prices are inclusive of taxes. Would have given them more, but I am deducting 0.5 for excessive pricing.

Being a hard core non-veggie myself, would be difficult to get myself into a pure-veg restaurant. In Kolkata you don't get much of a pure vegetarian restaurant and that too serving Asian cuisine. This place is made well and the kind of menu they have is impressive and the quality of food here can change one's mind to get back again and again to this restaurant, which acts as a unique alternative option for all foodies based in Kolkata. Option of both outside as well as indoor seating. Good Choice Of Items and taste is also very nice.

I went there with my girlfriend on Valentine's Day and then again a few days later on a Friday (and I'm pretty sure, many more visits are on the cards :p)...

It would've been tricky to find the place had there not been signboards guiding us,so a thumbs up to that idea!!!..the ambiance is really nice..the service is excellent too...the staff are well behaved and always ready to attend to the customers

We had ordered Horenso okono on both occasions and it has pretty much become a favorite dish of ours...on the first occasion we had ordered a Veg Momo Pan Tossed and that was really tasty too...definitely one of the best momos i've ever had...the second time around we had ordered a Walnut Brownie with ice cream...we enjoyed every bite of it!!

on valentine's day, they brought me a bunch of chocolates and a rose to give to my girlfriend and i felt really touched at this gesture...again on the friday that we went the second time, they gave us a complementary dessert...

if you're looking for a nice quiet veggie friendly place to spend some time and have great food around Southern Avenue,this is the place to be...looking forward to future visits!!

A variety of options to choose from italian, mexican, chinese, continental. Separate jain menu is what caught my eye (since i am a jain).
Must try the assorted cheese breads and gourmet pizza.
Overall great ambience, well done interiors, and good service. Fun place to catch up with your friends and for family get togethers

The review begins with a shrill vegetarian alert!
Nice place. Sober ambiance. Standard food. Not being much of a veggy lover especially for these cuisines, I could not experiment much with the food and opt for varieties. I went for the basics! We had ordered a Pesto delight pizza, grilled foccacia sandwich, peach mohito and green apple lemonade. It was a good experience for a change! Pretty good food and courteous staff. Outdoor seating available, although not preferable, if you ask me!

Visited this place for a veggie treat. The cafe is very easy to reach. We ordered fried wantons,ravioli,lasagna and chocolate quicksand! The wantons were gr8,ravioli was okish but the lasagna definitely needs improvement. But the best thing was definitely the chocolate quicksand! White chocolate getting melted by thick chocolate sauce was something I had only seen on masterchef Australia so imagine my surprise when it happened right in front of my eyes! Not only the drama but the taste blew my mind away too. This cafe can be visited only to try out this dessert.

Visited here today. The place is located just beside Vivekananda park in Southern Avenue. The ambience is nice and the decor classy. Ordered fried wantons, lasagna, ravioli and chocolate quick sand. The wantons were really good. But the ravioli and the lasagna were not quite upto the mark. The ravioli was rather bland. And the lasagna was made with cottage cheese, making it rather mundane. A lasagna without mozzarella is anything but a lasagna. It just plainly lacked that cheesy enamour. But the chocolate quicksand was oh soooo good!! It was really one of the best desserts I have ever had!! Hats off for that dessert of paradise Mr. Chef.

I had visited the restaurant with my friends for the first time hoping to enjoy the evening. But we were in for a big disappointment. The service out there is PATHETIC. There were 4 people at the counter and no customers.But no one greeted us at the counter. We had to requests to turn on the AC and a glass of water. Anyway we had settled for beverage and snacks.We had not even finished eating when a waiter approched to clear the table and tripped a cup of tea and water.Forget apologising,he defended himself saying he was doing his job assuming we were through.We shifted to the next table without them offering any solution.This we found DISGUSTING. All of them seemed inexperienced in handling such a situation.There was no other customer inside at that point of time and still they couldn't manage.I  shall never go back for a second time or even recommend it to any of my friends and family. Extremely dissatisfied.

I was hungry while I was passing by this area and was almost headed towards my old favourite Cafe Coffee Day over there when a chance thought made me swerve the car to the right hand lane, and I came across this place. Thanks to Zomato, I have developed the habit of trying new places, so I went in. The gatekeeper bowed as I approached- something not expected in a cafe. There was sitting arrangement outside too, but I preferred to get in. The place was tastefully decorated with ample sitting arrangement. The staff even showed me a small room tucked away in the corner meant for holding kitty parties etc. The waterfall ( not working at present but at my request, the staff put it on to demonstrate) was quite impressive. Beautiful wall decoration , a television showing Animal Planet ( for a change, as all other cafe keep either the sports channel or the music channel open in silent mode, which often irritates me) and a fat menu book - that was what greeted me after I settled down.
It took me a long time to go through the entire book, such a long list of food. It is a vegetarian cafe serving food from various countries and there is a separate Jain section too. I got confused as to what to eat after having gone through the entire menu due to variety of choices. Then my eyes fell upon fell upon a strange item in the desert section - chocolate quicksand.
Curious, I ordered for it, together with virgin mojito as I was thirsty. The virgin mojito arrived first, in a well decorated glass and cheered me up with its refreshing taste. 
Chocolate quicksand arrived later. It was....no I shall not describe to you. Visit the cafe and try it there and I shall bet if you are a chocolate lover/ have a sweet tooth you will not return disappointed.
I fell in love with it and promised myself to visit it once again just to satiate my sweet tooth.
The staff were courteous, quick and very helpful. The price okay. The only problem that we may face is a parking problem when there is crowd, that's all.

Locationally this place is a bit "haat ke". Slighty away from the hustle and bustle of daily life, tucked cosily behind Vivekananda Park. The place serves only veg dishes but has a wide array of choices. The ambience is nice and homely. The veg fried rice and paneer preparation which was ordered were both excellent. Overall a fine dining experience.

Located just beside Vivekananda Park this quaint little place is a haven for veg food lovers. The name of the restaurant is quite catchy and interesting. It comes across as a pub or disc but actually it's a vegetarian restaurant which serves Italian,  American and European dishes.  
The interior is neat and the simplicity of the decor gives a serene touch to the place. The furniture and upholstery has been chosen with a lot of passion. We ordered for a veg pasta in white sauce and I must say it was amazing to taste. The penne pasta blended perfectly in the sauce which had toppings of bell pepper,  broccoli and other vegetables. The veg sizzler was equally tasty and if you are a non vegetarian like me you won't be missing the non vegetarian in you. Each item is unique and has its own style and authenticity. The service is awesome and the staff has good knowledge about the items being served from the menu. A nice place to hang around with friends and family over some mouth watering vegetarian food.

Well well well..A quaint and cosy little restaurant tucked next to the Vivekananda Park 'Watz this friday' was a bit of a mixed bag.Its a place with basic interiors and I had gone there looking for select dishes which very few restaurants serve.
I'm a fan of the Burmese 'Khao Swey' and the Vegetarian Khao Swey I had here is the best I have had in Kolkata.The broth was thick and it had loads of vegetables in it ranging from carrots to brocholli.Moreover the accompaniments served were very close to the authentic ones

The other dish I tried was the Mongolian barbecue (served with rice ) .The barbecue sauce was very sour and I just could not bring myself to like this dish.It was a big turn off after having some wonderful Khao Swey.
All this food was washed down with some Peach Lemonade and it was perfectly sweetened.

Well the staff is courteous and friendly.It was a pleasing lunch if not for the Mongolian dish.I believe the italian here is quality stuff and would like to try some in my future visits.

We went to this place at the recommendation of a friend. The first impression on entering the place was really not good. We were expecting a nice and cute little cafe or a snazzy and vibrant one. But the ambience was very ordinary and lifeless. We did think of moving somewhere else. But then we stayed and ordered some food. 

The service was fast and the food was really really good. We enjoyed it a lot. However the repeat value of the place for me is too low to the time the feel of the place is upgraded.

This was the place where we reached not knowing that these place serves only veg dishes... as because I only gone through the name and rating in zomato... when we reached there after going through the menu number of times we don't find any non veg dishes.... then I checked zomato and realised we are in the wrong place... but the deco and ambience stopped us to give a try to there dishes.... 1. Crispy chilli babycorn.... was good 2. Cheesy garlic bread... very good. 3. Cold coffee with ice cream... very good 4. Padh Thai.... it was awesome...just helped us to forget the absence of non veg dishes...  service was good..  pocket pinch was acceptable....

A small joint in terms of seating capacity but with decent decor and location. Not a cafe and not a restaurant from the look or the Menu but has got something for everyone. Service is pretty amazing though the pricing is not exactly amazing, a bit on the higher side. Drinks are to be avoided totally at the moment as they are bland and kind of flop. Food is the hero as it should be. Try the Fondue and experiment with whatever new terminology you see or ask them for the best dishes of the house. Sizzlers are yet to match the x-factor of the other dishes. Should atleast be tried once.

This place was pretty difficult to find. I had to walk around the VP area for quite sometime before I managed to find it.  The interiors are nicely done and its an ideal place to spend time catching up with friends. 
In my last visit, I tried the Cola float and the strawberry shake. They both tasted good. I also tried the Alfredo pasta.  The quantity was more than enough for two people and the pasta was really cheesy with just the right amount of mushrooms.  All in all, a good value for money .

This restaurant is located on the lane of my ex-tuition. I had come here once, so we just went in to pass time. This is a total vegetarian restaurant and even the food is not that good. We had order a cheese chilli toast, szechwan potato wedges, crispy chilli baby corn, strawberry shake and americano coffee. Starting from the appetizers to the beverages, food was average. The staffs didn't have any idea about their own menu. They were very slow and the music played created a very noisy ambience. I didn't like the place that much.

This place is a little difficult to locate if you don't know the area around vivekananda park, just located in a narrow lane beside the park and very near to the sabyasachi store, this one has quite a funky decor, it's rather small but the food served is decent and of good value and quality.
I am rather fond of vegetarian dishes and apart from govinda's or the haldiram which are purely vegetarian joints complete with chats and kachori, there are rarely any vegetarian cafes, the concept is rather interesting. I came across this restaurant quite unknowingly when my sister and I went to have puchkas around the corner. The best thing about them would be the staff, ever gracious and very friendly, they make you feel welcome. Since this was my first visit, I ordered a chilli cheese toast and french fries, because I am a little scared of experimenting with new places, but pleasantly this place did not disappoint at all. The seating area though small is nicely decorated with well lit lights, I would love to visit this restaurant again for sure.

It's a perfect place if you just want to hang out with some friends for an evening adda, since we were almost full because of all the puchkas we had, I didn't actually get to taste their desserts, but I WOULD surely come back for more.

They have a private section also If you want to have a small private party. Its USP is pure vegetarian menu with Jain options. Corn chowder soup is a must try along with the momos , khow suey and the grilled burger . I have tried almost all items on menu and I can vouch Every dish is just as tasty and well prepared as other.

This is a small place, difficult to locate for people not belonging to the locality, which made me think it was set up for locals only.
Maybe it's coincidence but when I visited, which was on a weekday evening, most of our choices from the menu weren't available. They did not have buns for the burgers!!
We ultimately asked the waiter what was available and had to choose from whatever he had to offer.
Food was decent but quantity was lower than expected, indicating low value for money at a place that is not set up at a prime location, nor looks classy enough.

A relatively new startup in the Kolkata cafe scene, WTF is a winner all the way. It's vegetarian offerings are varied, tasty and diverse. Multi cuisine in the true sense. Do look out for its Mongolian delicacy and you would truly marvel at the creation. The service and the ambiance does add to the overall positivity. Location could be a bit tricky but a true foodie would never be baulking at such adventures. Right behind the Vivekananda Park, do drop in for some exquisite veg affair. Lest I forget, they also serve some real fantastic mocktails and dessert.

*The location I'd give it 3.5/5 as for a person visiting first time it's slightly towards the inner part of the lane and not on the main road.
*As for the place and decor it's pleasant cozy and nice place to visit with your friends or family 5/5 for that.
The walls falling water background can be a picture u can keep as a suvinor.
*The food is pure veg,served hot and emits freshness from the smell to the taste.
Garlic bread spaghetti n sizzler were all unique n mouth watering 4.5/5
*Staff was neatly dressed & well mannered 4.5/5
*Pocket pinch for a meal for 2 costs appx 850- which is quite reasonable for a good resturant.4/5
Overall experience was very good 4/5 and it surely have a good repeat value

walked in on 31st night with my vegetarian best friends. a bit odd and deserted location, they dwell in. surprisingly even on a NYE , it was completely empty. That almost made us doubt the place. however we were not disappointed. we ordered pan fried momos. cheap and tasty. the sauce was yum. then we ordered for margarita pizza. even though dominos one is better but it was okay. needed ketchup sauce for taste which I would never need on a Dominos Margarita Pizza. Also please provide the real oregano. what they gave was just dull and bland. Then comes the noodles. chilli garlic noodles. tastes very good. but too much of capsicum. Then brownieeeee. Tasted the same. But whatever, a good end. Price were reasonable except for the drinks. Look and interiors were pretty.  Service was okay. but they should have the knowledge of giving fresh plates after every gravy meal. All in all,my hunger was served and I didnt regret going to all veg restaurant.

The place is nice. Cozy, neat and friendly. Its entirely veg so it wont attract customers to the extent it would have liked and it's a little difficult to locate initially. But that being said, the veg options don't disappoint at all. In fact, if serving such veg platter is their marketable forte, then this place has a lot of potential to be the ultimate destination for veg foodies in the city.

The noodle soup and mushroom soup are really good. The pizza is amazingly crisp and tasty. The star dish here is the khowsuey! It is different and even the presentation is appealing. I have tried quite a few things here and most do not disappoint.
There is just one complaint that the desserts are not that great. They could be improved a lot more.

Good Choice Of Items in menu and taste is also very nice.

Must try is Thai Curry and Cheese Sizzler

Pizzas were ok....and need improvement.

Desserts a Bit Expensive but blueberry is a must try.

would surely come back

Nice place to have a burp. The place is not easy to locate. Nicely decorated and a quite dining experience. The options are a plenty ranging from cheese balls to sizzlers along with mocktails. One can enjoy crispy chilli babycorns. I would however ask the chef to change the cottage cheese sizzler as its content of cottage cheese is a bit absurd and needs improvement. Sizzling brownie is an awesome option to dig into

Brilliant .... Called for home delivery... 
The Pizza was brilliant had barbecued paneer pizza a new good taste.

The momo was thin and really soft just the way it should be. But the sauce was not up to the mark. They should make the sauce more spicy.

The corn chowder was awesome.... 

All must try this place once.

Amazing cafe . It's one of those ubiquitous places which one would like to chillax . I can vouch for them as one of the best gourmet connoisseurs . A cozy little place which serves some of the best veg fusion delicacy . I had a panner wrapped stuff which was just awesome . 

Even the tea served were one of those authentic brews you may have in Kolkata

Great Experience for a Girls Day Out ! We had ordered for Primavera Pasta and Cottage Cheese Sizzler with Cheese Garlic Bread. The pasta was very good while the sizzler was a little too spicy! And since it was a Friday we got to pick up a card from the Magic Bowl which said 10% off! So it was a bonus for us :) Thoroughly enjoyed the Lunch !

Though I am a Non Vegetarian though I must admit it its one of the best cafe's I have visited. I didnt knew that vegetarian food tastes so good if prepared well.They offer a huge number of foods and beverages. They have an admixture of chinese, continental and mexican foods. The environment  is great, ambiance is superb. They have an outer section outside for smoking and another section for private parties or meeitngs. Service is prompt and good. Looking forward to more Wtf's in Kolkata. Must Visit.

It was an amazing vegetarian muticuisine  experience in Kolkata , I loved the chengis Grill and the barbecue sizzler with the aroma of cumin enhancing the flavours and I ended with the lovely heavenly mud for desserts. The unfulfilled desire was lack of more desserts, look forward to visiting them next time I am in kolkata.

Visited this place today with a friend. A small, comfortable place with a decent variety of cuisines is what you can expect from Watz This Friday. The colourful wall outside is pretty striking. We ordered for Risotto which was quite tempting. Not being too fond of rice, yet I enjoyed this dish. The quantity was good enough for two. The staff is courteous and makes an effort to be friendly which is not very commonly seen. 

PS - They delight the visitors on Fridays with a potluck kinda surprise. You pick out a chit and get whatever is written on it. Our chit read 'Complimentary Dessert'
And within few minutes we were served with Blueberry Cheesecake..
PPS - The cheesecake has room for improvement. 

Overall, it was a good experience. :) Hoping for more better options in terms of desserts and beverages coming soon..

I am not too fond of vegetarian eateries, but had a sudden craving for desserts while near this place and decided to enter. The decor is nice and warm and the sofas were pretty comfortable. 

We ordered a cheese fondue, a hazelnut parfait and a blueberry cheesecake. The fondue came with croutons, apple cubes and some sauteed vegetables. But what I did not like about it was that the fondue wasn't really molten cheese. It was more like the cheesy white sauce that is used in pastas. But yes, it was tasty and hence worth a try. 

Then came the chocolate hazelnut parfait. I did not like the presentation much, it tasted more like regular chocolate ice-cream, the crumble on top was soggy and the hazel nut flavour was hardly noticeable. 

Then came the blueberry cheesecake. Here too the edges were not neat. However, it tasted pretty good and the compote on top perfectly balanced the sweet cream cheese. But  the base could have been much better. 

The bill amount came to 750, so it's not particularly pocket friendly enough for the short-comings to be ignored.

Discovered this place from zomato the location is not very tricky but head you need to have a good idea about VP to get there
There are two areas to this place , you can sit outside or you can sit inside. 
I went there with my friends and we all were pretty hungry. 
We had ordered nachos , garlic bread with cheese and without cheese. Fresh lime soda , kiwi soda and coffee. 
Nachos were GREAT ! One of the best I've had. 
Garlic bread was also really good , and so were the beverages. 
Service was great ! 
This place really left me happy !! :D

I had visited on 27-07-2014. The table which was offered to us was marked reserved. Order for starters were placed. Starters were okay nothing great about any stuff. The owner approached us & asked was it over. We said we will place order for main course. She said it will take minimum of 45 minutes. Indirect way of saying to leave. Beside our table a family of 6 was seated in a table of four. They wanted to join the table but she said no as other customers were waiting as per her. Such behavior in hospitality industry is uncalled for.

Whatz this friday is located at the very place where it was The Tea Cafe...

Decor:: Its not as chic & elegant as its previous counter part ,Paintings adorn the wall ,with printed wallpapers,but they should jazz it up a bit more,with tables placed for big groups,family and couples as well.

Ambience:: I do like the ambiance, one specific feature I really liked was that they have 2 sections, One for non-smokers & for Smokers which is outside, not a large section is given to the latter but it does a fair bit of the work.

Staff:: Patience, Courteous & know how to communicate with their clientele 

Food:: We ordered Sweet lime soda, Cappuccinos, Mojito (non -alcoholic), Garlic breads with cheese & without cheese (both variations) , Nachos. The brew for the cappuccinos needs to be much stronger it was a tad bland on the taste buds, coming to the sweet lime & mojito ,the blend was right and even though nothing out of this world will surely won't be a let down. The nachos were really great, topped with good amount of cheese and a fair amount of the paste,it will entice your taste buds with the distinct spicy tinge for which its loved,top it up with dollops of white or red chilli sauce that's served along with it. Lastly the garlic breads, I really liked the quality as they were toasted to the right crispness and with a fair bit of butter and cheese but never going overboard with the amount.

All in all, a real nice place to chill along with your buddies or close ones...but I really would love to see them improve on the decor segment...

Love their unique variety of dishes! being a vegetarian, for starters, I began with 'Kampusing' which was spicy and appetising. But quantity left you wanting for some more. For the main course, ordered the Chengis Grill, Sphagetti Alio Oglio, Potato Gratin and Gourmet Pizza. I totally recommend the Chengis Grill and the Gourmet Pizza which were amazing and unlike the normal dishes.
For desserts, we had the yummilicious blueberry cheesecake and the heavenly mud- both were deliciously sinful! The mocktails could have been better- the mojito was drab and the lemon ice tea was just the usual.
overall, the experience was good- staff was extremely helpful and made good suggestions about what to order.

It's located in a very small lane near Vivekananda park. 
Its small place with alright ambiance. 
Food is average. 
We ordered garlic bread, it was bit too buttery.
Gourmet Pizza, it was too bit buttery and blend. The sauce was not at all having any taste, however was loaded with lot of vegetables.
Momo, the sauce was too blend.
Lasagna, too blend, it lacked sauciness and taste.

Price is above average.

Tucked away in a corner in the south Kolkata area, I visited this place for an evening with a couple of friends. The outside area had a party starting off, but we were accommodated in the inner section. The decor was simple, with the walls adorned with graphic wallpapers. However, to me, it seemed a bit morose.

The food: We ordered a thin crust gourmet pizza with extra mushrooms, coffee, and the chocolate mud dessert. The pizza was really good, though the base was not as crisp as we would have preferred. One of the few places that used good quality, juicy mushrooms, on their pizzas. Though I did feel that it was overpriced for the place at Rs 400+.

The coffee was decent. Did notice a CCD machine in the area, so no major points for it, save for the cinnamon brushing at the top and the nice cookies served alongwith.

The chocolate mud dessert was close to a thick mousse, but the flavours were bang on. Rich, dark-ish chocolate. Loved it.

The menu is decently extensive, along the lines of similar cafes like Chai Break, Tyre Patty etc. They do not serve hookahs, so the other two places score more on that front.

A decent place to visit for food if in that area. Might try it again sometime. Might not really go out of my way to visit it.

Visited WTF one Sunday with my sister. The reviews seemed promising. But something about this place failed to keep my expectations afloat. And that was the ambiance and service. Was it because it was a very quiet Sunday noon and we visited at 12. The place did not look ready although the opening time given here is 11 AM. The waiters were still wiping the cutlery dumped on a table. The TV had a horrible movie on, which they did not even change when we entered. Moving on to food -we tried their mocktails - pina colada tasted ok, while the blue wave is one of the most horrible drinks I have ever tasted. Noone told us whether the drinks were milk-based or not and we ended up with drinks which were not to our liking. The chilly babycorn was fine. The problem I had was with their Phad-Thai, after having it too many times at the best Thai places across Kolkata.I had too much oil and tasted just like it looked - very very flat! The Green curry with Rice was decent but if one is charging quite well for a veg green curry - what is the harm in putting in some decent veg items - mushrooms for example. It had the same old veges that none of us really care for ! In the end I was just screaming WTF and in true sense of the term!!

Restaurant: First all the interiors are good, well placed and well organized. Sitting is a major issue if you coming in a large, need to wait.

Food: Food is good and quantity is for 2-3 people. Pasta, lazania, risotto is tasty. Even the mud pie is good. Liked that very much.
Service: It's a little slow but you can wait for a while if it's crowded.

Now here comes the part you need to read and see.
Went there are two times. For the first time in my risotto, got a dead mosquito. Yuck. Tough they replaced it. Had ordered the potato sizzler, in that found a hair. Again yuck. First time experience bad.
At the 2nd visit. Again got a hair in the pasta. I just shouted on them. Plus they gave ny orders as I had told them. Specially told them to give without onions and tomatoes and yet they served it with onions. All mixed up. Bad bad.

I would have given 4.5 for this restaurant but after this experience, I suppose, I won't visit again.
Please do see to it.

Watz This Friday.
8th May,2014.
My first visit being on a Thursday :-D. A nice eatery located in a small lane behind Vivekananda park.
Early impressions - The name certainly doesn't give a clue about what to expect, but as one enters the outlet the neatly done up interiors speak volumes of themselves.
Food - I had gone with a friend, and had been craving for a while for a finely cooked pasta.
The Primavera (pasta) - the dish was good on quantity and the quality was just heavenly, I can very safely say it was one of the most amazing white sauce preparations I've ever had.
Tomato Basil Fried Rice - Wanting to have something a little different, I choose this Thai dish, and to my pleasure never has a rice with tomatoes tasted so good. I was again satisfied with the quantity offered.
Dessert HEAVENLY MUD - A chocolate mousse, was fresh and oozing with flavour just as the rest of my servings. This time however I wasn't satisfied with the quantity, maybe it was just my greed for chocolate :P.
Service - Not great and not too bad either. Room for improvement.
Price Bracket - Zomato is pretty accurate when it comes to pricing info. So 750-800 for two is just the pinch.
Final ratings (out of 10)
Location - 5.5
Ambiance - 7
Food - 9
Service - 5
Pricing - 6.
Suggestions - one should definitely visit the cafe which on a good day(such as mine) can serve food which just burst flavors.
However the owners should focus at making the staff more friendly and informative.

Alternatives - The southern Avenue area if full of eatery options, some being Kurry klub, casa toscana, funjabi tadka etc.
Thank you. :-) Eat well, cheers.

Not easy to find . Its a small lane behind the vivekanand park . I saw it on zomato with great ratings and reviews so decided to visit the place . Took me some time to find it. When I went in the place was totally desserted .  Interior is good and seating is quite comfortable.  I had ordered rissoto and cola float . As for the taste of food I wont say it was bad but I cant even say that it was delicious.  
Its a bit expensive but considering the quantity of food its acceptable.  They should have options for single serve too .

It was a late night visit to Watz This Friday,last sunday.We entered the ground floor restaurant at around 10.15 or so and found the place full.Fortunately for us we got a table(inside the room which is meant for parties.It was my brothers birthday and his friends and I ordered as much as we could ;) (we were 4 people in all).

LOCATION: Near southern avenue fillers,if you are familiar with southern avenue you shouldt have difficulties locating this place.However  the walk from our car parked out on the main road to the tiny lane where this place is located was a little quiet ,maybe coz it was 10 in the night.

AMBIENCE: Brilliantly done walls and good seating,there is also an open air seating which should be good when visited in winters. 

FOOD: The menu is comprised of choicest of offerings in italian,chinese,thai and contintental.
We ordered main course right away.
First up was the gourmet pizza which was good.I say good because well it tasted good however i have had better pizzas at other places,but nonetheless was nice.
Next we ordered spagetti in pesto sauce, and what an order it was!Brilliant!Lip smacking.Yes, it was a creamy pesto sauce and was cooked very well,no cream flavour dominated the palate, and i could taste the basil and olive oil.I would easily recommend this dish.
Finally, we ordered a herb chilli potato sizzler.It came in with a beautiful sizzle (music to my ears).Potato patty, spaggetti in spicy sauce and cheese balls.Everything on the dish was superb! 

We also ordered a virgin pina colada and a few soft drinks (our first choice was a mojito but our server said it wasnt available).But im glad i ordered the the pina colada!It was vey good,not too creamy and loaded with pinapple and coconut goodness.I also liked how they served the mocktail in a tall glass, with the top ring of the glass coated with coconut dust,meaning every sip if you take directly from the glass you could taste the coconut!Great idea.
Finally to end our food extravanganza we ordered the much recommended deserrt, The heavanly mud,And indeed, heavan it was.A superbly done chocolate mousse with flakes of chocolate!

Overall a very enjoyable experience!Will be back soon for more  :)

Good things first.. This place has AWESOME deserts which is a fresh n welcome change from d usual cupcakes! Also, the menu is quite different from what is usually available in other plcs in Kolkata. The food quality is quite maintained and yummy. The only thing this plc can improve on is the service which is sadly very slow. The staff is quite friendly though. Overall it remains one of my all time favourites. I'll suggest....do check it out :)



----- 11 Oct, 2013 -----

The food is good, the ambiance is nice and the service is good as well.  Even though its an attractive looking place from outside as well, its located in a place where it'll need to popularize itself coz not many ppl kno about it! overall.... i really enjoyed my lunch there, particularly the Rose sauce pasta. the spring rolls weren't that good! 
anyway, its a must try :)

A small and cozy restaurant cafe with a very smart getup. Three brick finish walls and a wallpaper done smartly makes the ambience very lively. Dimly lit but the taste just brightens up all the flavours in the first bite of whatever you choose to eat. Been here multiple times and have tasted almost all cuisines but Thai which I would do next. A very nice place to chill over good food and a cuppa to compliment.

We checked out this place today and guess what??? As the name suggests, on Fridays there is a special surprise waiting for guests. You get to pick a coupon from a bowl to get a free bakery or confectionary item. So for us, it was like icing on the cake. Loved the herbed potato sizzler along with pan fried momos in chilly garlic sauce. The heavenly mud pie was awesome too. Will be coming back to try the Thai and Italian delicacies.

So this is like very close to my house behind vivekananda park.... the place is made well and the kind of menu they have is impressive... i had just walked in and was not very hungry so i we called for a pizza....

First things first.... paying so much for a pizza i would rather visit Fire n ice or other better known places... secondly... the time it took for us to get our hands on the pizza was not worth it... the person taking the order... well he was talking properly but knowledge was lacking a little bit....

the pizza tasted good... not the best... but still pretty good... and they had used all the exotic items on it like sun dried tomatoes and olives and all... so that something worth a thumbs up...

next time i go i want to try the thai and the momos... but i have heard that i rather go to benjarong and pay the same amount with more style it is that exp in this place... which is a let down...

i expected it to be more on the lines of a back door place where you can go and chill but the prices dont allow that to you...

the food though is still pretty good but not the best for sure.... and the wait is something that just takes everything away....

I visited this restaurant after reading on to the reviews. I was very pleased with their service and the food both. I tried on the cheese fondue which was amazing and at par with the awesome cheeese fondue that we used to enjoy at jalapenos. I am glad I dont have to go so far for the cheese fondue and I can get it near my house. The phad thai was good too. I am definatley visiting this place again. Keep up the good work.

Cold food , the sizzler not a word can be written about it , pizza the bread and the paste is not okay , mexican rice no salt in rice .....they use the same to mato puree for the sizzler , pizza and mexican rice which was a bit khatta .....pocket oinch not cheap ...service : the management should know that the sizzler requires to be served not just given on the table ....review : 1/5 ...my idea avoid it till they improve ....

The food was very okay. The nachos we were given were simply cold doritos with cheese on it. The bean sauce we discovered after completing half the nachos on top. No guacomole, which is now a common feature of mexican cuisine. The red curry maggi was also served cold and tasted of green curry essentially. The garlic bread was nice. After these few starters, we decided to leave and indulge in street food at Vivekananda park.

I dont think I am coming back to this place.

This was my first time at WTF. The service was really good, and the food was commendable. The desserts lacked the lightness required in souffles, parfaits and cheesecakes as they are pure vegetarian, but overall, the experience was excellent. The ambience was nice as well. The manager there is extremely helpful, and aided us from the very beginning in getting us a table to choosing a variety of dishes.
Looking forward to going there again!

When Tea Cafe broke many hearts and closed down all of a sudden, some of us old faithfuls would drive past the place in hopes of a comeback. So I was in for a surprise when this Wednesday afternoon  we chanced upon an interloper, - "Watz this Friday" or WTF!  The exterior is modern and quite bright, a sharp contrast to the old facade.  The new owners knocked down the dividing wall between two rooms and as a result it is more spacious though it lacks character. Tables are set well and the tableware is spotless. Menu is extensive and priced intelligently. While leafing through the pages it finally hits you - WTF ! is  vegetarian only.  I would have appreciated this bit of vital information outside in the foyer in the pop up which mentioned the menu. Disappointing as it was , we ordered pan fried momo's and lasagna. The momo's were stuffed with corn and something which tasted suspiciously like soya bean granules but it was an interesting take on momo and I quite liked it. The lasagna was a disaster from the word go. The layers were not pronounced and the sauce was too runny. Even the flavors were all over the place and the big chunks of bell pepper did not help. But one out of two isn't that bad right? The service was prompt and efficient but we were also the only table occupied that afternoon. 
Its quite sad for the management that they chose this place to open shop as the tea cafe is just a tough act to follow but I do see this place being popular among young couples looking to grab a bite to eat along with coffee, and on a budget. And among the ones who are strictly vegetarian but would like to taste world cuisine but dont really care about the authenticity of taste. So well...hmm...

I heard about Watz This Friday from my friends (Shruti & Abhishek). Was not too keen to be there (the restaurant serves only vegetarian) being a strict non-vegetarian. It was just one of those days, where I was confused and did not know what to eat so ended up being there on my wife's insistence. Ambiance was good, decor just right, the place was appropriately lit. Staff was good, kept asking for feedback at regular intervals. Coming to the main bit. Food..menu what the place has to offer. You will get Continental, Asian, Mediterranean.

I will only write about what we tried. For starters we wanted to order Fried Pita with Hummus, unfortunately this was not available, I started ruing my decision for a moment and settled for Veg Spring Rolls and also ordered Tuscan Onion Soup (Almond broth with sauted tangy onion). For the main course we ordered Veg ragout with Mexican rice and Phad Thai.

The veg spring rolls reminded me of the Benjarong spring rolls. Veggies were wrapped in wonton sheets, crispy fried (but not oily) served with Thai Sweet Chilly Sauce. The presentation was good! Somehow missed the glass noodles in the spring rolls. Next up was the Tuscan Onion Soup, quite delicious and as described in the menu card pureed almond and sauted onions were present with the tang! Moving to the Veg ragout with Mexican Rice. This was just spot on, in terms of taste and texture of the ragout and Mexican rice (long grains of rice boiled to perfection, beautifully punctuated with crisp veggies and corn). Phad Thai too did not disappoint – in fact it  can give Thai Chefs some worry! I still had some room left, so took the opportunity to order Spaghetti Aglio e Olio, one of my all time favorites at any Italian Restaurant. I was not disappointed at all. Enjoyed every morsel. 
Being a sweet tooth, I was keen to order Turkish Delight for dessert, but was disappointed as it was available….
Overall a good experience, worth visiting more than once. Specially appreciate the Chef!

WTF- Watz This Friday

WTF is nice little all Vegetarian restaurant that has come up in place of Tree Cafe. Its on the side of Vivekananda Park opposite  to  the side which has Fillers. Its a nice restaurant which looks plain from outside but has good decor and food on the inside.

Decor - WTF is covered in the Red and Black colors. When you go further in there is separate part with 2 sets of tables, meant for large parties which want their privacy. This is where we sat and i felt that it was really comfortable and nice. Since the area was separated from the other part on the restaurant, we had a private server who was prompt and kind. But she did look nervous and confused at times. The service was good though.

Food - The food available here is a blend of cuisines from Chinese to Thai to Italian and all of it is good in my experience. The desserts are quite tasty and fresh. My food order was -
1. Gourmet Pizza - The pizza crust was nice and crisp and the flavors well balanced. You could taste the individual components of the pizza in every bite and the sauce did not overpower the toppings.
2. Phad Thai - The Flat noodles here were one of the best I have had. They had a nutty flavour and a tangy flavor to it which I really loved.
3. Cottage Cheese Sizzler - This was the star of the evening. The cheese just delectable and much better that your everyday cottage cheese. The Spaghetti went perfectly with the cheese and the potato wedges added a crunch to it, which i loved.
4. Chocolate Hazelnut Parfait - It was a chocolate mousse on a hazelnut base. Nice but nothing real special about it.
5. Blue Berry Cheesecake - The manager was present there in the restaurant that day and she had repeatedly asked us to try the cheesecake but I have no real fondness for cheesecake so turned down the offer repeatedly. Finally she got a promotional lucky drip where the reward was a Blueberry cheese cake s we ended up trying it. It was amazing. The cheesecake had good textures with the base easy to cut into and the blueberry jelly on top just delectable. I really loved the cheesecake and would go back just for it.

Opinion - A good restaurant with quality food. An all vegetarian fare which is a must visit for every vegetarian and non vegetarians alike, but beware the portions are not huge but just adequate.

Ok. So I’m just back from sampling Watz the Friday. I bite my words and take them back. One sour phone call but these guys surely know how to make it up. Whoever said the voice of the consumer is dead in this country. Surendra and Nilu played perfect hosts to a sudden lunch plan. Instead of ordering in we decided to hop across and experience the place. From outside it seems a nice place but for some odd reason the interiors didn’t appeal. Maybe I’m growing old and ‘all that jazz’. The service was impeccable and the food arrived in good time. The staff was courteous and always wore a smile. 

We sampled the chili cheese toast, fried rice and vegetables in hot and sour sauce. The meal ended with a chocolate hazelnut parfait. The food had a unique home style cook taste to it and was gentle on the stomach while the dessert portion was too much for the two of us. I had a lemon iced tea which was refreshing but I missed the lemon flavouring. 

All in all a good experience and would love to go back when we do not get such preferential treatment.



----- 31 Oct, 2013 -----

Without having been to the place I already have had a bad experience. Zomato says WTF delivers but when we call the Cafe they say they would start delivery within 10-15 days. I don't think lunch can wait that long.

All in all a total dhamaal cafe in the city and a total paisa wasool visit to this place.

So I stepped in...and it was one of the best food experienced I had.  Phad Thai was lip smacking...THE DESSERTS WERE TO DIE FOR!!! The HEAVENLY MUD is surely a must try.

Good job team WTF! Hope I have an even better experience the next time I'm in Kolkata!

The Thai green curry is also really good and Phad Thai! Padh Thai was the most tasty flat noodles I've ever tasted! 
I ended up licking my spoon:p 
Vegetables in hot garlic sauce(Chinese) was also yummy.. 
Was toooooo full to have the dessert so I'm gonna come back and first eat the dessert because the food is solo entoxicating that I will end up being full again!

This cafe has opened in the place of TEA CAFE.... which used to be a cafe i really liked ... So was disappointed so see it change into WTF.

Although I didn't like the name i though it was kind of wannabe , but the red and black windows and the signs were quite appealing so we decided to go in . and i am glad i did . 

The quirky wallpaper and the comfortable seating was quite nice. The staff warm and courteous. 

Although we didn't order much the minestrone and the garlic bread were quite  good. I don't know why the assam tea used has a Cafe Coffee Day label on it ..( quite a put off) 

this place is nice and i would love to come back .... Will miss the simplicity and coziness of tea cafe
