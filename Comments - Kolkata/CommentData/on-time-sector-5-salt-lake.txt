On Time ironically was not on time delivering my first order.yet, i rate u 4.0, because the food, that final clincher was very good.so, with a request to On Timers to be more.. well..on time, i review the rest of the experience. I had ordered the bengali thali n what a relief that it came foil packed and not in a hundred different containers as many restaurants tend to do.also had egg curry and mutton curry.the best part is finally to find a place where all the curries, egg, fish n mutton taste distinctly different, not the ubiquitous mashed gravy that most restaurants serve. Then there was the chicken club sandwich..again a gem, filling, with enough chicken chunks, cheesy too.the mutton could be a little more tender but the gravy was very flavorful.the katla fish was nearly 100 gms, but slightly undercooked.the gravy again distinctively good.the thali was adequately portioned and overall the pricing is just right..i wouldn't term it as budget, but not over the top either.here's to a better delivery experience the next time i order and i am sure that will be very soon

Today ordered a Chinese combo from them quality is good and quantity is optimal. Chilli chicken though lacked its oriental flavour but the baby fish Fry and noodles are great.
