Worms in their sweets. We got it as a gift from someone but I know for a fact that it would've been freshly bought from the store, although cannot comment whether it was freshly made. The worm was in only one piece out of many, but we had already eaten a third of the box by then and threw away the rest after the discovery. With the reputation of Om Ganpati, and just for any food place in general, there just is no excuse.

Situated on the first floor of 'Parampara'. The restaurantÂ is famous amongst its patrons. there is a great variety of cuisines on the menu card. The south indian, north indian, chineseÂ and multi cuisine are all competition to one other and it is really difficult to decide on what to order as everything is so enticing. The hot stuffed kulchas, the paneer dishes are a speciality of this outlet.

Situated just beneath the Ultimate The Green mark restraunt. Looks awesome at night with full lightning. It has two entrance one from front and one from all those coming directly from The Green Restraunt.

It serves all bakery stuffs like sweets, dry fruits and all breakfast items. Pricing is fair, food is good and quality is gr8

A big no no..!! Went with a lot of expectations knowing its by Om Ganpati caterers - let me tell you it was "naam bade darshan chote"
Ordered for chaat, dosa and a sizzler platter.
The kachori chaat had no freshness - the curd was sour too..!! 
Dosa was good crisp but the sambhar and chutney seemed stale.
The sizzler came in without any smoke(the sizzling effect from the hot plate)
The ambience was ok, lot of lights around a good sweet shop below.
I dont recommend..!!

Offering stiff competition to the sweet shops here in Kolkata , Namotsav serves good quality sweets and savouries. I tried their peda and the barfi. Both were very good and well balanced in taste.

Bought many things like piza dry kachori and corn puff all were pathetic to taste and the kachori was stale. I suggest a big no to this place.

Had breakfast at namotsav with whole family one fine sunday morning. We had ordered club kachori- sabzi and jalebi. Both were served hot n tasted delicious. Plain dosa was crispy with tasty chutney sambhar. Malai toast was good too. 
On previous occasions, we had eaten plenty of namkeen stuff from here like matar kachori, patties n i found all of them up to the mark. The sweets are delicious too.

One of the best place in salt lake to visit for vegetarian delicacies, chaats, sweets and savouries.

they have a variety of food and sweets.

What I can vouch for is the chaats, Indian breads, malai kofta, Indian sweets and savouries. Even their samosas are great. The place is within the budget of the common man.

I like there quality and quantity compare to bhikaram nd haldiram and other brands.

Food not good. Looks like food is made by made by a sweet maker(halwai) and not a cook. Service was rookie types., Not professional. I will not go again.

Surprisingly decent place for dosa, vada, et al. The rava dosa was quite satisfying and so were most other dishes (we sticked to the likes of crispy baby corn, chilly honey potato, etc.) Only one of the dishes (was it cheesy onion balls?) missed the mark. Small blip, otherwise yummy for the tummy.

Salt Lake gets it's own sweet shop that sits as a tough competition to the likes of our Haldirams and Bhikharam! The sweets are on display are excellent! Enough people to attend the customers. They have a mini take away counter with four items. They have their own breads. They have their gift items and packaging items. They even offer pastries and mousse. The prices are good. Recommended.

Location-Sector 1,Saltlake,Kolkata.

We visited this place after having lunch at "The green mark".It belongs to Kolkata' best caterers "Ganpati caterers".This place covers a huge space and is mainly known for its sweets.We were quite surprised with the variety they serve and the staff was also very well behaved.They let you taste each and everything before buying which is really appreciated.We really loved their "Gulab ladoo" and "Brownies".

Food-4/5
Service-4.5/5

Its been a long time since we went to this place.Hope its all same.ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

Went for breakfast. Very limited menu. Sabzi kachori was decent. The jalebi was crispy and A class. The idly too was good and i can say the same for upma which is generally pathetic at restaurants. Only grouse was the limited menu. Should visit once and I shall visit again.

Went there for dinner on Sunday alongwith friends. The place is nice but the tables are cramped for space. Soup descent, starters not good particularly the crispy chilly baby corn in which the corn tasted a bit tangy as if it was not fresh, main course items were not that good in taste and breads were just ok. After eating food there most of us had a bad stomach. Did not live up to our expectation as the people behind this restaurant are one of the well known caterers in Kolkata.

A newly opened sweet & confectionery shop opened behind City Centre 1. It belongs to the Kolkata's best Caterers 'Ganpati'. Due to this reason, I had a lot of expectations from this shop, so today I went to buy 5 trays of sweets. Well-crowded and everyone running around was the scene... I tried some Sandesh- it was tasty!!
They also have pastries which look tempting but taste coarse!! 
The worst thing about this place was the people. They don't listen to you properly, then make mistakes or does this deliberately if you do not keep a watch on them...one of my tray had broken/cracked cutlets in them...
The worst was the person who was billing the sweet orders- very very rude and have no courtesy of how to speak to your customers... Shouting at the top of his voice if you demand for something such as I tried to recalculate the amount of my bill....this guy started yelling at me that this is not the way work is done here!!! 

Besides this, they keep good variety of international chocolates and fruits....

But if this kind of behaviour is shown, it's better to go to more reputable brands who understands the value of each and every customer!!

I will not visit this place again!!!

Super place to drop in for some sweets and varied snacks , also wide options in mouth fresheners and dry fruits to choose from !!! 
Bakery items and chocolates are a must try here !!! 
Imported fruits also can be desired pick ups ... 
Extension at 1st floor is a restaurant as The Green Mark which is also a must mention 
Overall a complete one stop place !! 

Must must must visit!!!h

Heya they have a extended version now ... Selling chaats , paw bhaji & kulfis now its truely amazing as they say kolkata is known for street food but these people are selling the same with quality & taste .. Its a 5 for them
