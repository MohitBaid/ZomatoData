This place has amazing atmosphere.. The open air sitting area with white decors and proper music is bang on. 
Loved the place. 
Coming to food we ordered a blue lagoon and a meaty pizza. They charge 5% gst and 10% service charge additional to the cost printed in the menu. 
The blue lagoon was good.. The meaty pizza was tasty but it was smaller in size as compared to the price.

Located just beside the Diamond plaza mall. This place needs to improve with the quality of food they provide..Hookah is also pretty ordinary. Yes the place is nicely decorated but that's not the only criteria to match up with the other chill out spots.

Well been there for the first time and initially did'nt liked the ambience the lift was not working had to walk 4 floors and just as you enter you see a table messed up with hookah flavours and all( it is there hookah preparation place. So this is not somebody expects just at the entrance. The seating was quite comfortable and from there the ambience improved. Coming to food I ordered a Virgin Mojito, a sweet and sour Fresh Lime soda a vanilla hookah and Chicken Tikka kebabs. The service time was more than 20 mins for even the mocktails and hookah even though the place was not crowded. The mocktails were good, presentation of the Mojito was better hookah was smooth but could be more smoky and the chicken tikka kebabs were the best thing about the whole visit served with mayonnaise and green chutney it totally stood out.
These people need to work on the entrance ambience and the serving time.

Its located on the 4th and 5th floor of the Aminia building just adjacent to Diamond Plaza mall.The 5th floor is the rooftop cafe and opens aftr 4ish in the evening.The cafe ambience is pretty good and its spacious too.The staffs were very friendly and welcoming.We had crispy chilli chicken and bbq chicken wings and kungpao chicken platter. The dishes were quite good especially the kungpao chicken platter.The prices arent too high and its basically a good place to hang out.Diamond plaza doesnt have too many options when it comes to restaurants,so this place is definitely a good place to come visit!

Ambience is very good. Meat pizza was tasty but it was way too much less quantity for even one person. Cafe latte was good. Hot chocolate brownie was very bad. But somehow I like this cafe, maybe for the ambience. Kindly look into the pricing and food quantity.

NH Sky Lounge is the latest addition in the streets of Nagerbazar, located near Diamond Plaza Mall, at the 3rd and 4th floor of Aminia Building. Consisting of two dedicated floors, the place is quite spacious with the strength of holding quite a crowd along with a Roof Top seating on the top floor. Now what disappointed me is in spite of such amount of space at their hand they still didn't have a separate hookah and dining area, which is clearly odd.
Coming to the food section they have a range of things to choose from among Indian, Chinese and Continental. In the drinks we ordered Shirley Temple and Sky Lounge special mocktail. Now the SL special tasted pretty good but it was a simple go to thick chocolate shake so I didn't get the logic of a special fancy name behind. Shirley temple was an Orange based mocktail with grandine syrup. Now this one tasted real bad. I could literally feel it was entirely made of REAL Orange juice and nothing else. After being pretty much disappointed by the drinks, I wasn't expecting much in terms of food but their BBQ chicken wings surprised me. The wings were juicy, tossed in spicy bbq sauce with mayonese on top tasted real nice. In the main course the Kung Pao Bowl, which came with capsicum fried rice was decent, but @290 is overpriced in terms of both taste and quantity served. We ended the meal with walnut brownies with icecream as all the other dessert options were out of stock. The brownies were too dry and should have been served hot.
NH Sky Lounge was a decent experience. There is scope for improvement but also Diamond Plaza having a very limited eating option the place is quite a good change. Plus the rooftop and hookah are a bonus.

This new place is located above Aminia beside diamond plaza. Reached there around 4 for lunch. The place was empty then. It has both indoor and outdoor seating.. Chose the indoor one as we were not ready to give up the ac. We ordered lal maas, naan, paneer butter masala, chilli chicken and fried rice.. The food tasted quite nice and quantity was also ok. The decor was cool.

This restaurant is located just beside the Diamond plaza mall, 4th floor of Aminia outlet. Nice and cozy ambience, courteous staffs to cater to your needs:)
I did not get a chance to visit the rooftop arena. I would love to visit it once again
Ordered Hot Chocolate Brownie with Vanilla ice cream. A basic and popular dessert . Priced at 150 bucks, the quantity was a bit disappointing, especially the cute small bowl of vanilla ice cream didn't impress me  at all:(
I would love to give it another try for the sumptous main course delicacies. 
A good place to hang up with your hookah buddies ;)

Visited the place after durgapuja. Located beside diamond plaza, nagerbazar(4th & 5th floor, aminia building). It has rooftop sitting area so u can definitely enjoy a rooftop view while having your food. The interior is  also well decorated.
I ordered one  🍕 chicken pizza (There were less options for non vegetarian) and waited for 30 minutes to get it while others who ordered veg got their food by 10-15 minutes. The quantity of the food is not worth the price. But the quality was really good.
Overall it is a great place near nagerbazar to hang out. 

Ohh.. Forgot to mention..., there was a lucky draw and I won a 10% off coupon on my next bill. 
Visiting again soon. ☺️

Food Quality and Taste are good. But none others are acceptable. For example they will force you to buy mineral water for Rs.50 a litre by serving you a very poor quality regular water. I am not sure if they mix anything in the water they serve. The quantity they provide is also quite less as compared to the price. They charge 10% extra on top of GST (18%) which is named as Service Charge and the weird thing is that this charge will be reversed if you oppose to pay the same on top of GST. I would rather prefer you not to visit this place since you can have a lot more better options at this location (near diamond plaza).

Personally appreciated the chef for delicious pizza. The couch and raised chairs are comfortable and cozy.

Zomato-ed my way to this place which looked pretty nice and reviews were quite positive. This place to my surprise exceeded all my expectations.

Ambience was delightful, clean, well lit, well located, has a clean, very well maintained roof top too.

Service was impeccably good, they even offered us complimentary drinks to our delight. Food didn't come promptly but I don't mind that because what came next really took me by surprise.
Dry Chilly chicken, crispy Chilly potatoes, hookah and a platter called Desi Khaana. All of them tasted freakishly amazing. Chicken was so tender, well cooked and bits of crispy as well.
Crispy Chilly potatoes was unconventional yet far better than what I have had tasted before.

Desi khaana- Malai kofta, Chana Masala, Dal makhani, butter naan, Papad, achaar and salad.
Oh dear Lord, those were so goood I can go on praising.
So much and when you don't have to burn a  hole in your pocket, it becomes extremely good too. 


I really hope they maintain that level of service and taste. A second visit, upcoming.

This is a newly opened cafe cum restaurant near diamond plaza,nagerbazar.
During durga puja every other restaurant is flooded with people waiting for their turn to get a table. But as we were damn tired after pandal hopping we didn't had the courage to wait. So after trying for aminia,noodle odle and not getting a table we decided to try this new restaurant and i more than happy with my decision.
As soon as we entered the staff greeted us and we took a seat. The ambience was very calm and soothing. They also played some nice music for us so that we enjoy our time.
Interior of this place has a modern and chic element in it. Perfect for hangout with friends.
Coming to food we ordered pav bhaji fondue ,veg combo and kulcha.
Pav bhaji fondue came in no time.It was the first time i was having something like this.
It had crisp bread pieces smeared in butter and bhaji topped with lots of cheese.
This one is a keeper.
Coming to the veg combo it had veg pulao,dal makhani,kadai veg,paneer butter masala,kulcha,achar,papad,salad and gulab jamun.
All the dishes were so lip smackingly delicious.
My favourite being kulcha ,paneer butter masala and dal makhni..
Service was quick .

Pocket pinch was 720(including taxes)

The place deserves this rating just for its interiors. The food sucks big time and the place does not even have enough base to serve all people l. Had to wait 40 mins for the hukka. The waiters don’t know how to explain the items in the menu. If you are in this area prefer having food somewhere in diamond plaza but ignore this place.

Went there for birthday party. Fabulous view from rooftop with sports screening. Food is nicely served with sufficient quantity per plate. 

The location is attached to Shopping Mall. The chef personally suggested us 8 items tailor made for our group. The food in particular was delicious. Shisha was smooth and they have ample options of mocktails.

They have welcome offer going on and offering unbelievable experience at reasonable price. Overall, a nice cafe for hanging out with friends.

Fondue is must try. Kathi Roll is awesome.

Basically I giving 5 because there is no option to give more!! Food is just INSANEEE here!! This is one of the best, may be the best,continental food joint I have visitied in Kolkata! Ambience is too good and the staffs are very courteous! What more you can ask for a perfect dinner!

LOCATION

It's just beside Diamomd Plaza Mall, on top of Aminia building. Shouldn't be a problem to locate!

AMBIENCE

It has one covered and one roof top seating. We were in the covered one, the view is nice from 4th floor. Inside decor is very calm and nice.

FOOD

For me this is the most important part! I would forget about ambience and location if the food is great! We startes with Latte and coffee beans were really good. Then we had CHICKEN CEASER SALAD. This was really nice with crispy lettuce and proper dressing! Now is the time of main couse and it just blew us away!! CHICKEN SALTIMBOCCA was cheese, veggies and spinach wrapped in chicken brest and seems sauted till golden brown. It was served with MASHED POTATO, GRILLED VEGGIES and FRENCH FRY. The taste was out of the world. If you visit here, pleasee try this one. Next one was GRILLED CHICKEN SIZZLER and I dont know how a chicken can be so soft and insanely tasty. The chicken was super soft and wasn't falling apart. The texture, flavour was just awsome! This also came with same sides as previous one. I would request management to do away with French Fries.The food itself is sooo tasry that you don't that fry

SERVICE

The staffs here are very friendly. We went here to celebrate birthday and they gave us free MOCKTAILS!!

Overall a MUSTT visit place for the people who love continental. They have indian and chinese dishes too and I believe those would be equally great!!

The ambiance is superb, resembling the calcutta of 60/70s, as the name suggests. It is a perfect place to spend some quality time with friend/family if you like to have Indian cuisine. The service was excellent. The staffs are prompt and attentive to customers. The food is very good here. I have tried their chicken, dal makhani and garlic naan. Since it's located at Jossore road, 4th floor,near Diamond Plaza Mall. It is newly opened, must visit.................);

Great place to enjoy food . Nice ambience . Emerging as best restaurant in North Calcutta
Roof top cabanas are best place to chill with friends n family. Visited the place again. My kids loved pizza n garlic bread. The kathi roles were awesome. Over all great experience again.
Surely visit again

This Café is located just beside Diamond Plaza.
We tried hookah-Summer of 69 and Double Apple, both with milk base.

Ambience is okayish.
And and this place needs some really good music, please note that.

Located just beside Diamond Plaza, has a rooftop lounge and a restaurant. They have a junkyard themed style going on here. Some people may find that cute. The rooftop ambiance is quite nice. But the music was aweful...just a projector with MTV on.
We had the Non-veg Platter and the Cilantro Rice Bowl with Virgin Mojito. Food quality was average....nothing popped out as exceptional. Presentation was good though. I liked the Brownie with Ice cream. Quantity is adequate for one person.
Our bill was 1.5k with GST and tip.
Service was too slow.
Alcohol isn't available as of now...though they said they'll be opening the bar soon.
Also they are only accepting cash currently.

Cosy place with high rise chairs as well as couch.. &  they have rooftop Cabana too. Food is delicious &  they have live screening too. Music is subtle,  suitable for families,  groups or couples. 

Ambience is cool.

After Aqua Java Air Lake town this is the second Rooftop place in this area. Now let's start with the review.
This review is based on indoor seating. Due to rain we were not able access rooftop.
Ambience-
Since I visited on the second day of opening everything was tidy. They have both high chairs & sofa. Interior was nice. What really turned me off was the songs played on there small television. I guess they had just three songs which was played in loop. Inspite of reminder they didn't managed to find a solution.

Shisha-
I ordered Double Apple it was nice no choke with lot of smoke.

Food-
My order was Cheese Fondue and Loaded Nachos . Cheese fondue was good. It was creamy and cheesy & most importantly they serve good portion of bread.
Loaded Nachos was also good. Nachos was hand made I guess and it tasted really well. Chunky salsa was tangy and spicy I asked for an extra portion and they served me. The only thing which was missing was the cheese sauce.

Suggestion-
Please get some good track for music.

Verdict-
There are very few good cafe in this area And this place has a great potential to be one of them. I hope you maintain the food and shisha quality. Currently they are not serving alcohol . Best of luck and don't forget add new music track. Suchi Awasthi
