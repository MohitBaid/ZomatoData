This place’s decor is pretty amazing and nice. Loved it completely.
Tried fish and chips which tasted really well and fish was perfectly good.
A perfect place for a date.

Boutique Hotel Aauris, located at 4, Robinson St, has launched a deliciously unique festival called “3C – Chocolate, Cheese and Coffee” at its well-known patisserie, Scarlet. The three staple favourites of all foodies will find expression in an innovative dessert menu that Executive Chef Sujit Mondale has prepared keeping in mind today’s experimental audience ready to try new combinations.

Scarlet ShakeShack & Patisserie at Aauris is celebrating their 3C Festival! If you're wondering what the 3 Cs stand for, then it is- Cheese, Chocolate and Coffee! Isn't that tempting enough? If not then go through this collection of the wonderful mouth-watering cakes and pastries that we tried! 
1. Red velvet cheesecake
2. Dulce de leche caramel cheesecake (MUST TRY)
3. Cheesecake Brownie
4. Little black dress Chocolate cake (MUST TRY)
5. Intense trio choco mousse

Ambience: A very romantic set up with the perfect hues of red and grey. Very classy.

Horrible experience. The food is crazy expensive and tastes horrible. I ordered a simple ham and cheese sandwich and even that was so utterly disappointing. The ham was very low quality and so was the cheese.
The staff is so incompetent, it is shocking. We ordered a iced coffee (which tasted like coffee flavored water) and the waiter actually tasted the coffee in front of us to check for sugar.
It's just a cafe in a corner of a hotel lobby. So the ambiance isn't great either.
All in all, nothing about this place is worth it.

Whenever we think of some indulgent C word – what comes to our minds are chocolate, cheese and coffee. This trio is something that can bring any chocolate and coffee lover on their knees. I am an ardent caffeine lover. Coffee is something that’s an essential necessity in my day-to-day life. Also, there’s chocolate to add on. I believe that chocolate, cheese and coffee are instant mood uplifters and can put a smile on faces anytime! This is what the ongoing 3C Festival at Scarlet, Aauris, Kolkata is aimed at.

Went here by taking voucher from cleartrip, which had hookah.
But they said that they can't serve hookah inside the scarlet and we have to sit outside. And sitting outside in hot summer is not very exciting.
This is an bad experience for me.

Scarlet is the all day breakfast and dining place located inside Hotel Aauris at Robinson Street. We had come here for breakfast last Saturday. When we went and settled inside the place, some of their staffs came to us and said that this place is closed right now for renovation purposes and we have to go to Blu, another restaurant of Hotel Aauris and have food.  They also said that we can order from the Scarlet menu as well. So, after taking pictures of Scarlet and settling at Blu, we ordered a croissant egg sandwich as suggested by their staff. It was a freshly baked croissant containing scrambled egg with cheese. It was served beautifully garnished with oranges and I simply loved it. Taste was good. It's a 3.5 right now for me. Can rate further if I try other items from this place as well sometime later. That's it for now. Happy Dining! :)

They say to eat the breakfast like a King but the gender-biased I can have it like a queen only; by pampering myself with the favorites and apart from the first part of the phrase I don’t believe in the rest which says to have the lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper. I love breakfast perfect to start the day with positive vibes, and naturally, it is wise to not to follow my food routine. However, coming to the All-day Breakfast, I was recently being invited by Aauris for the All-day breakfast they have come up with at Scarlet. Aauris is a centrally located property (to be precise in the Park Street area) in Kolkata and I like the place for not only the location but the budgeted food cost as well. Those who read my blog (especially the dine experiences) are aware that how conscious I am with the food price along with the taste, quality, and ambiance. For me, a place with the proper combination of all these is a winner always. Naturally when I went there at Aauris, the first thing I checked the price as I was already happy with the open seating arrangement. Starting from INR 50 to max INR 400, I found it a good breakfast deal.

Just as the mornings are the most pure part of the day so is breakfast the most important meal both nutritionaly and psyhologicaly…so says the nutrition gurus. However, it is not everyday that you get to eat a breakfast that is delicious ,hearty and pretty all at once. Needless to say I was excited to be a part of the Bloggers meet at the new breakfast menu launch at Scarlet- The All Day Breakfast Place.

​Breakfast is one of the most neglected meals of the day. Most of us have to leave early for office or college or school and we finish off the first meal in almost a rush, without taking proper care. Some of us have a habit to wake up late and then we have a nibble and settle for lunch, which happens with me quite often. Thus a proper breakfast is always missed out by many of us. So, why not have a proper breakfast, and to be close, a proper European breakfast at Scarlet – The All Day Breakfast Place?

Scarlet located in Aauris Hotel is a beautiful spot. Recently they have launched an all day breakfast menu for which I came on a food tasting event organised by the property owner.
Each of the dishes they served looked so pretty, an Instagramer's delight. They tasted pretty too. Among the things we tried out Egg Benedict was the show stealer and tasted as brilliant as it looked.
Then the Egg in a hole which is a bread with eggs put in holes made on the bread. Another beautiful dish to have.
Farmer's Sandwich was another wonderful item to try here.
What I liked most about is their prices. Considering such a huge property they are serving dishes at much cheaper rate. Most of them are priced between 150-250 INR. The place is beautiful with an open area to dine beside the main restaurant. A perfect atmosphere to have your breakfast.

Take a look at their Beautiful dishes. You will like them a lot.

Aauris Hotel had been quite a good choice for mid-upper budget tourists in Central Kolkata and suprisingly, they've been quite good or rather consistent in their food segment also. The management have recently introduced an all-day breakfast menu for their Scarlet outlet, for which we were invited for the tasting event by the management. What I found out, the best part of the menu is the items are all nicely priced, rather I'd say they are value for money considering the portion size and the establishment. Most of them are priced within 100-200/- a portion and 1 dish can satisfy one hungry soul. From whatever we've tasted, egg benedict was the champion (looks-wise and taste-wise also) and is definitely recommended (slightly more hollandaise sauce wouldn't have hurt). The farmer's sandwich is basically cooked egg and chicken sausage slices put in a jumbo croissant and tasted nice. the surprise item was Eggs in a hole. It was a bread with dip holes filled with egg sunny sides up- a surprise, and sprinkled with some black peeper is pure bliss. Overall, definitely recommended. The oreo shake is huge. P.S, the menu is presented in tabs- check that out.

Scarlet is a pretty good place if you ask me. I recently checked into this place sometime around Christmas - everything there was decorated with red and green, which perfectly blended with the Christmassy spirit.
We had ordered Red Velvet Cake which tasted nothing but brilliant. I also remember ordering another cake. That didn't disappoint either.

ordered a fruit and a plum cake (order was taken previous day, they had almost 24 hrs for the baking) for xmas party.
Called them whether the cake was done or not, somone on the other side confidently told me, yes it is ready pls come. And within 10 mins i was there. But when i reached, they have already given the plum cake to someone else. And they were trying to put all the blame on me. And kept me waited for like 30 mins. When i got home, was so looking forward to the cake but to my surprise, the plum cake, it was hard on the side and not moist at all. I was so dissappointed with the cake!!! Mind you, its not cheap. 350 rps for a slice of rock. And the fruit cake was not at all good, it tastes yak, it was undercooked. Spent 175 bucks for it. Never going back again for sure!! this place is a pure scammer. Don't waste your time here.

Cake mixing ceremony always ushers unadulterated joy and all the happiness which is synonymous with Christmas. The warmth that you will find in any of the traditional cake mixing ceremonies will undoubtedly fill your heart with love and warmth for the people around you! This is surely a true occasion that enables you to overcome the imaginary barriers around and to rejuvenate the social side of you! Somehow I feel the occasion can truly be encapsulated in the quote by American essayist, Hamilton Wright Mabie who once said, “Blessed is the season which engages the whole world in a conspiracy of love!” There can probably be nothing as beautiful as these words. It truly teaches us to find excuses to dump hatred and to spread love and respect that knows no bound. Coming back to the topic of Cake Mixing, this is one such traditional excuse where you can break all barriers to spread love and happiness! It is believed that more the number of people involved in mixing the ingredients for the Christmas plum cake, the better and bountiful the year ahead is going to be. So whenever I get an invitation for Cake Mixing I make it a point not to miss it unless there is something really unavoidable. Because more the number of participants, the better it is in terms of happiness, positive vibes and laughter that enriches the aroma of the air around! When the process of mixing is carried out happily in a true team spirit, it brings in a moment of wish fulfillment.

Went there last night after seeing some really nice pictures of their rooftop bar. We were a group of four girls, and all excited to party. But sadly we were told that the Sky Bar was closed. As the Black lounge was stuffy and largely empty, we came out and decided to have some desserts at Scarlet. The pretty things on display, though not of wide variety, looked promising and were moderately priced. 

We ordered the Blueberry Pastry, a Chocolate Truffle Pastry and a Raspberry Cheesecake. The Blueberry Pastry was  very ordinary, while the chocolate one was very disappointing. The cake itself was dry and the ganache frosting couldn't save it. The Raspberry Cheesecake with its pretty pink swirls, tasted okay, but was a little too set for a cheesecake. Sadly, it was not soft enough and not up to the mark. 

However, the man waiting our table was very genial and always had a smile on his face, which was definitely a positive.

Scarlet at Auris is rising as the next best dessert destination in the city and there are 5 reasons why. Special moments or not, desserts play an integral role in making every one of these moments, sweet and memorable. Whether you are looking forward to enjoying a splendid birthday, or celebrate your everyday small achievements, there is seldom a chance that you go without gorging on something sweet and heavenly. It is particularly hard to say no to desserts when they are put in front of you in an avatar so alluring and gorgeous.

Located inside hotel "Auris", at Robinson Street, "Scarlet" happens to be a sudden whiff of refreshing air, for its beautiful decorations with classy colour theme, and a melifluous ambience. What adds upto the refreshment quotient of this place is the brilliant looking mocktails that tastes really delicious.

Accompanied with some sheesha, and cake, over some delicious mocktails, can make any food aficionado to drool for, and "Scarlet" is no exception to that.
And yes, they have a beautifully decorated open air lounge too for having sheesha!!

Well done Mr.
