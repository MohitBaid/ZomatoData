During my MBA Classes , I used to come here. The soups are great. Specifically the chicken mushroom and sweet corn soups. Do not try the Chopsuey as I did and was disappointed. The fried noodles they used in the chopsuey was not gullable.staffs are strange , no warmth in greeting you. Pretty average this place is.

On 14th May 2017 My Son Was In His Mother's House On Mother's Day To Celebrate With His Mom. After That He Reached Ballygunge Phari By Bus No. 218 And He Bought The Dinner From The Chinese Pavilion, Ballygunge. He Bought Sweet And Sour Prawn For Rs. 290/- And Veg Hakka Chowmein For Rs. 110/- Grand Total Rs. 400/- With Tax And Vat 14.5% Rs. 72/- So He Paid Rs. 472/- And Bought The Dinner Home To Palm Avenue Like A Good Delivery Boy. So That's My Son Aman. And We Enjoyed Our Dinner Together And We Also Shared It Together.

a place for good Chinese 

 I ate here twice but the last time I was a bit disappointed with the quality 

 there was a degradation in the quality of noodles 

hope that was an exception and I am going to serve better next time

Visited this place for Chowmine, and the experience wasn't very good. Chowmine tasted like some road side shop, Noodles quality was poor and not well cooked. The Chicken Chowmine hardly had more then 4-5 small pieces of chicken.
Not much recommend. And the price is fairly high.

Hi, this is my another trip to China. Visited “The Chinese Pavillion” located at the mouth of the ‘Bondel Road Lane’ Ballygunj Circular Road, yeah !! true that I’m not at all exaggerating. Let’s come to the food directly my sis and I love ‘Crispy Chili Babycorn fry’ and the best part of this restaurant is they served the starter within 10 minutes crisp babycorn fries, flavours of vinegar, garlic, spring onion and red chili sauce were beautifully merged and yet distinguished, even my Maa loved the fry, in many mediocre restaurants in Kolkata I have found this dish quietly messed up. Then we ordered Chowmein sans eggs, at first they did serve with egg but they were prompt enough to replace it. The side dish we ordered was ‘Quick Braised Manchurian Chicken’ this was gravy based Manchurian. I noticed one thing in this combination that they balanced the amount of Salt in these two items Chowmein-Quick Braised Manchurian Chicken. Few things what I didn’t like that the Menu Card mentions about the desserts & Fresh Lime Soda but they didn’t have that in Menu in real. That was highly disappointing after such a great food. We then half heartedly drank Pepsi *sigh*.  

The Pros of the restaurant are:

1.	The payment we made Rs. 687/- for three. 

2.	Great food.

3.	Wooden Furniture and the imperial feel.

The Cons of the restaurant are:

1.	Only one attendant.

2.	No desserts & Fresh Lime Soda as mentioned in the menu card.

3.	Little bit of attention is required towards cleanliness.

Now its upto you if you want to visit this place or not.

You are looking an aged restaurant located near Ballygunge Phari. Chinese Pavilion once had its goodwill in the area and was hard to miss. Coming to present, the restaurant has lost all its charms and runs empty most of the time. So, I had to visit the restaurant with a friend of mine one afternoon for our lunch after some tiring work. Thankfully, the restaurant was air-conditioned but they were not running until we had arrived. There was not a single customer and the servers and the manager were watching T.V. prior to our arrival.

Anyways, we took a seat and placed our order straightaway. We went for Chicken Hakka Noodles, Crispy Chili Babycorn and Hot Tossed Chicken in Green Chili and Garlic. We asked for Lamb Green Pepper Onion but sadly lamb items were not available so we went with its chicken counterpart. First came the starter, Crispy Chili Babycorn. It was crispy, but was overly peppered and the sauce they had used was tasteless. We thought that the situation might improve with the main course, but it was the same story. Chicken Hakka Noodles were too dry, not properly cooked, lacked veggies and tasted very bad. Hot Tossed Chicken in Green Chili and Garlic was no better, though the platter had 12 pieces of medium sized chicken but the taste of spices were non-existent, gravy was tasteless. Overall very bad food, even some roadside stalls would do a better job.

Pricing was cheap and quantity was sufficient, bonus for gravy items as they serve 12 pieces per platter. A bill for two would hover around ₹600-700. Serving time was good, starters got served within 7-10 minutes and the main course just after we finished the starters. Servers were nice and efficient, they helped us decide our menu. Billing was fast.

Ambiance was not very impressive. Interiors look too dull and lighting is poor, though overall dimly lit, certain sections were too dark. Furnishing is pretty old and looks very outdated. Plates and utensils are of cheap quality that one wouldn't expect from a restaurant like this. Air-conditioners were not efficient, or is it because they had only one of them turned on? There's also a television set which played movies in considerably loud volume, so not very quiet ambiance.

Overall, not a place I would recommend after my experience. I could have excused them for poor ambiance if the food had been any good.

Chinese Pavilion was once a stop for many people of the city for their Chinese dishes. The start was good but however they lost track. The lamb in hot garlic sauce, that I tasted once from this place, was so pathetic that I had to stop eating lamb for a long span. This place was never a gem and in today's time, there is no point in visiting this place as there far better options to have better food with in the same budget.

Excellent location with decent sitting space, but the quality of the food and behavior of the waiters completely spells the doom for this restaurant. The Noodles were tad dry and tasted worse than the roadside stalls one can stumble upon. The Chicken portions were even horrible, with absolutely no taste whatsoever. Hard and chewy, the entire saga was a sheer disaster. Never bothered to bump upon this place ever again!

I went there 2-3years back on Christmas evening. Still the place was almost empty. I remember liking the décor of the inside. But alas the food was a big turn off. I don't remember what I had ordered except Chicken in Schezwan sauce. We had to quite a while. The taste was disastrous. The rice was bland with absolutely no seasoning. The Chicken was chewy and taste like Chilli Chicken rather than Schezwan Chicken. They charge high considering the quality and quantity of food they serve.

Mostly empty with a very desolate feel to it , definitely does not exude any warmth. Food is reasonably good taste-wise. But a little unsure of the quality as it didn't taste fresh enough. Disappointing

This place is terribly under rated to the point I wonder why it's always empty despite its excellent location. The food is standard and good infact if you are trying to grab a quick lunch during your break get the non veg or veg set meal. A Chinese thali 😉, with a chicken side a small portion of a starter and noodles or rice. It's bang on budget too.

Well Chinese is a pretty popular cuisine in India and especially in Kolkata. There are innumerable restaurants that serve you Chinese. Wasn’t aware of this place, but as it was closer to my office, we went there for lunch with a couple of friends on their recommendation. Located in Ballygunge, it’s quite easy to spot this restaurant. 

Talking about the food, we ordered the pretty regular stuff like chilli chicken, hot garlic prawns, chicken fried rice and chilli garlic noodles. The quantity was decent enough. But the taste was not up to the mark. And the time it took to serve, you could take a nap and wake up.

With so many Chinese restaurants around, you wouldn’t want to go back to this place again which serves pretty ordinary food. I guess location of this restaurant is the only plus point but there is no dearth of good restaurants in Ballygunge.

Pros:

* Location

* Quite spacious

Cons:

* Pretty regular menu

* Quality of the food below par

* Service- Not good enough

The Chinese Pavilion - Got it delivered at the workplace.
=====
Intro + Location:

Chinese pavilion is located right opposite The Dhaba on the opposite foot. It is not at all difficult to locate as it's in the Ballygunge Phari itself.

I haven't been here but got a take away done from here while i was working at Gurusaday Road.
=====
What we ordered:

1) Egg Chicken Hakka Noodles - It was yummy and less on oil. Tasted good. 

2) Veg Manchurian - It was good but had more than required garlic. Nevertheless, the gravy was nice. 

3) My friend ordered veg schezuan hakka noodles for himself. I didn't get to try it though but heard good reviews about the same from him.
=====
Conclusion:

I personally found the food taste as well the quality to be decent enough. Might order again from here while i am in this area. I haven't dined in here so can't comment much on the ambiance. :)
=====
Unbiased review based on my eating experience.

Situated at Ballygunge Phari this chinese restaurant gives me the worst experience as I pay a visit here with my wife for lunch .
Ambiance :- very minimum...nothing specially to say 
Service :- very slow and non-cooperative.
Food:- We ordered Chili Garlic Noodles and Hot tossed chicken in green chili and garlic. Quality of both dishes were just pathetic. The noodles reminds me of roadside noodles and the chicken dish is just ordinary. Quantity wise noodles are less moderate and chicken dish has 12 pieces of chicken .
Cost :- For this two pathetic dishes they welcomed me with a bill of some more than Rs. 400. Total waste of money.
Surely not recommended....

The worst restaurant I have ever been to.
I ordered Singapore veg noodles and Chilly baby corn.
As I was about to take a bite I found a hair in the noodles. Called the staff and he said I am replacing it. I was bit irritated but I thought ok lets give it a try. The second bowl of noodles arrived at my table. I had 2 bites of the noodles and voila what I found an insect (bigger version of makhhi). Called the staff and asked him for the manager. We waited for 15 mins but he didn't call anybody. Then we went straight to the manager and she just said that she is cancelling these two items. She didn't even say sorry.
The waiter came with the bill and these two items were also included in the bill. We asked him to remove it from the bill then he went to the manager and the amount was deducted from the bill. I was so irritated that I didn't want to pay a single penny for the whole meal.
This is the worst restaurant I have even been to. Please avoid this place at any cost!!
PATHETIC FOOD!! PATHETIC SERVICE!! PATHETIC AMBIANCE!!
HATE THIS PLACE TO THE CORE!!

P.S. Sorry for the bad quality pictures. The phone's camera was not good enough.

Now food is good you get a good taste of chinese, dishes are well cooked and the noodles and rice good and taste yum.
However main course dishes not that great.
Some are spicy to much spicy.
Now rates are high dishes are slightly i feel are highly priced.
Service of attendents is average don't expect much.
Well if you have not tried it surely you can step in food is good.
If my comment or  review helps you do like it i will appreciate comments too.

The location of this place is very convenient and one cannot miss it whoever is crossing Ballygunge Phari.  The ambience was simple yet warm. The place is not huge but can accommodate quite a number of people. The food, quality and quantity wise was absolutely fine! I really liked the food. I loved the crispy chicken balls which was served with a hot n spicy sauce. The Singapore rice noodles are also worth the mention. The pan cooked chicken in white sauce was ordinary. Service was prompt! Overall a nice place for a quick chinese food without comparing it with the other chinese restaurants.

This is not the place to visit for an extraordinary dining experience. It is, however, perfect for a low-key, comfortable meal, with great, fuss-free food and a homely atmosphere.

This is easily my favourite chinese dine-in in town. That said, there are certain areas which need much improvement-
The service is pretty sluggish and most of the staff aren't very friendly. More often than not, a lot of dishes on the menu aren't available. Also, some items are completely different than what one can imagine from the menu. This is one place where it is imperative to know which dish to order- experimenting with new dishes doesn't usually end well.

That said, the good things, the things that make Chinese Pavilion my favourite restaurant-
The best Chicken Spring Roll I have ever had. Ever. I could have them every day, and not get bored. That's how amazing they are.
Then there's the classic Chicken Sweet Corn soup. No soup anywhere can come close to the comfort a single spoonful of this can give.
With these two tied for the top position, The Fried Prawn balls and the Lung Fung soup come a close second. To each, their own.
The main course section lacks much of the sparkle of the starters' section. The fish dishes are rather bad, the lamb is rarely available, but each of the chicken gravies taste distinctly different-and very good- even though they look nearly the same. Also, their Singapore Rice noodles is also a favorite, as the other types of noodles are somewhat too ordinary.
Pricing and quantities are both moderate.

On the whole, this may not be a star restaurant, this may not be mind-blowing, but if it's comforr-food you want, this is perfect.

In a nut-shell this is an ordinary restaurant with average overpriced food.They take longer time to serve food and the food they provide is just average.The staffs are also a bit ill-trained and they are bit lazy in providing you plates. tissue, fork spoons and on asking things you may not get an impressive attitude form them.Thee interior is just ok but may be due to lack of customers the staffs seems to enjoy watching television more rather than concentrating on customers.

Avoid. The food was horrible. Ambience poor.   Furniture dirty and filthy. Service poor. 
Food we had ordered didn't taste anything like food. Our group of 12 people spoiled our mood and durga puja evening-outing waiting there for an hour for a seat and the pathetic overall service.

Been here twice and on both occasions I was not pleased with the service or the quality of the food here. Firstly they take long to serve your order. Just to serve the soup they took 20 mins!!!! Secondly the ambiance is not the best considering the price they have. Food is not upto the mark either. Once should try "The Dhaba" located just on the opposite side of this place.

Gloomy interiors, but i kind of like the old world vibe. The food is average but overpriced compared to the quality and taste.

My little brother got a fish bone stuck in his tonsils while having a "boneless" garlic fish. 
Not a kind of place I would usually visit.
Though the location is really nice

An ordinary restaurant with average overpriced food. that is what it is. What ever we ordered, either they did not have the ingredients or they were short of supply. So after a lot of pick and choose, the attending staff asked us to take whatever they had at that moment. we settled for Prawn Balls instead of Golden Fried prawns, chicken dumplings instead of chicken wings and mixed fried rice along with chicken green curry and chicken in peanut sauce. The service is real slow and the staff is also insufficient. so that being said we were served with our first starter after half an hour of our order being placed. food nothing extraordinary, tending towards tasteless, the main course side dishes tasted similar. over and all quite disappointing experience. 
Decor was shabby and the food being that bad and overpriced, i would never like to visit such a place..

It is an overpriced restaurant. The food served is not bad but there is nothing extraordinary about this place. The staffs are not trained well and the overall look of the restaurant is not impressive. They have a habit of playing terrible C grade Bollywood movies while you are having your meal at very loud volume. Weird average place it is

I went there yesterday, it was not at all crowded. The behaviour of the people there is very good, the service being a bit on the slower side. The quantity they serve is more than sufficient, one regular fried rice is enough for two persons. The food is decent, nothing special about it. The ambience is good.

I have been to this place many times. The restaurant space is a bit on the lower side. The decor is medium. But....the food is surely good and will keep your taste buds tickling. Some of my favorites over here are Singapore rice noodles (non-veg for sure), fried chicken balls, golden fried prawns, spring rolls, stir-fried chicken with mushroom etc. They also offer a set-meal during lunch time which is quite cheap..but I'm yet to try that. Overall, a good dining experience, provided you focus only on the menu and its taste.

Well, the first thing that I want to say is that the ambience is great. i ordered lung fung soup with chicken and prawn , mushroom chicken, and mixed chowmein. the thing i dont like about the soup is that the fishy smell of the prawn is prominent while the vegetables are very fresh and crunchy. chowmein is mediocre and its like any other chow dish as you can get. not of any special point to mention. about the mushroom chicken the chicken is not fresh and its not soft at all. but the mushroom is very fresh! thus considering all the plus and minus its very ordinary but you will be disappointed if you go with high expectations!!!!!!!!!!

NOT GREAT FOOD @ THE CHINESE PAVILION!
1 out of 5

Chinese Pavilion is an ordinary looking restaurant that serves average food. The place serves both Chinese and Thai cuisines. The items can be a be a bit overpriced for the kind of food being served by the establishment. The place is ordinary with neat and clean furnishings. The staff could do with a little a bit of more training. Nevertheless the service is prompt and efficient at times; but most days waiting is the only thing that you will do at this restaurant. 
Food quality is okay but they do have a tendency to serve tasteless food. Their staples like rice, chicken, soups and noodles are average in taste and can even be bland at times. This is very apparent with their non spicy dishes; they can even border on bland and tasteless. Besides the inconsistency problem, the food quantity can also be a turn off. Even their prawn wafers can smell and taste awful at times. 

Nevertheless the food is fresh and healthy - I have never fallen sick after having eaten here! Some of their tasty soup options worth mentioning are chicken soup with dumpling, lung fung soup and hot and sour soup. You can even give their VERY limited lamb dishes (like lamb in hot garlic sauce and lamb in honey chilli sauce) a try. Some of their Thai dishes like the chicken in red and green curry, Thai chilli noodles and Thai chicken are nowhere close to being original Thai dishes but remove the Thai tag - and viola! They are edible. From the Chinese section, the chilli prawn and crispy chicken are not bad.

Over the years the food quality at The Chinese Pavilion has definitely declined to a great extent. The place can be an option for a quick bite rather than a family meal in case you are in a hurry. This is one place that you should visit without much expectation.

Honestly this one ia an average place with nothing great to offer. The Chinese cuisine is ok but definitely better than the Thai section. The items are a bit overpriced I feel. 
The ambience is ordinary but clean. The staff are inexperienced and need to polish their communication skills. The babycorn is nice and chicken in red curry to nice too. 
Overall my experience and the whole meal was quite average and ordinary. 
I don't think I will like to come here very often but maybe if it's food taste improves I'l consider coming here again. You can visit this one but don't go with very high expectations.

Well, this is an very ordinary and average restaurant. 
The Chilly Prawn is well done. The crispy chicken is delish too.
Prawn chips had an awful smell. The chilly baby corn was 'okay'.
Ambience is good and prices are affordable. Food quality is tasty but sometimes they serve tasteless dishes.
3 from me.

An average place to go have your food.

Pros: Quick service, quiet and peaceful surroundings, good quantity of food, reasonable pricing.
Cons: Taste wise food is not great, no facility for car-parking

The place can be tried out once, but trust me there are better places serving chinese cuisine.

Seen this place plenty of times since childhood from buses and taxis but went there yesterday for the very first time. On a first impression, it looks kind ofok. Seats are not too comfortable. One has to crain his neck for eating if he is sitting on those sofas. We ordered Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Chilli Chicken,Thai Chicken, Chicken and shredded vegetable with noodles, Mixed Fried Rice and Manchurian Fish.The soup was quite good. But what really disappointed me is the quality of preparation of rice. The rice was virtually sticking to the spoons everytime we tried to take it out. This is not expected of a Chinese dish. The Thai Chicken was ok. Chili Chicken and other things were ok too. except for the fact that the rice and noodles ought to be little more spicy. It was absolutely bland. One has to mix everything in good quantities to make it alright. The quantity was good. The service was quite ok to me.The pricing was also reasonable.

Final Verdict-- If u are looking for some "chalta hai" khana  then it is ok restaurant for u pricewise also. But if u are looking for a more authentic chinese dinner or lunch, then it should not be your 1st choice.  It  is more for a casual visit. I would come back hoping to see some improvements.

This place has been there sice I was a kid. They used to be extremely famous once since calcutta lacked chinese dine ins. However as new places came up this place lost its fame. Personally judging on recent visits, the food served by them are very average. Their soups, rice, noodles,chicken are very average to taste, at times even lack flavour! Especially the non spicy ones are pretty bland. Another drawback of this place is their quantity of food. The quantity of food is very less. And since tastewise too they are not upto the mark, I would say this place is not worth your time. However if you do drop in i should tell you that keeping all aside the quality of food is good. Food is fresh and healthy. :)

This place has ben around a while and is well located diagonally opposite the Dhaba at the Ballygunge Phari. Its good for a quick bite .... not great but good. Lung Fung Soup or Chicken Soop with Dumplings are a good option on a wintery day .... the staples like hakka noodles, fried rice and chiili chicken and garlic prawns are decent enough. I did not particularly enjoy the lamb and fish dishes. They also have a section of thai food but I have not tried it out so am not in a position to recommend it. The service is slow and if you want a fast meal you may not be too happy. Also the parking is a huge problem so unless you have a driver or are using public transport that is a minus.
