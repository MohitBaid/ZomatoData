Ah! Maggie a staple diet since we were kids is all I love about this place. It's cooked deliciously and served in right quantity. Just opposite to Allen Park right on the Park Street gives this an added locational advantage.

Back in Bangalore, Maggi was my savior and was included in my meals almost every passing day. So, one day while I was roaming near Allen Park, the sudden aroma of Maggi beckoned me and I happened to make a short stop to check it out. Ordered for a Cheese Maggi and it was like reminiscing the good old days. Absolutely sumptuous, and served in no time, it was a perfect value for money.

A small place but one of the best in park street area. If you have 100 rupees with you and you don't want to go back home empty stomach then hop into this place. Awesome sandwiches(do order the cheese grilled sandwich, its too cheesy ;).). Best maggi? Yes its the best and the pasta? Just yummmm. All within  100 bucks.

Maggi is super hit! Sandwhiches are good. And service is fast. Great place to grab some good snack on the go. The prices are also not very high.

I was astonished to see this eatery. These people believe it or not, are serving noodles at astronomical prices. And I don't mean chow mein, but plain simple maggi which they just cook and serve. And I was more surprised to find people actually lining up for it. This place is apparently appreciated by some and loved by many. I would cordially like to invite them over to my home, where my mother would feed it to them for free.   

A small slit between two shops serve as the establishment with a single cooking counter. The huge bummer is to stand and slurp the hot noodles as there are not even a single seat. But they do serve the broth in a foil container and plate, so that's one thing taken care of. The place is hygenic and service is fast although a bit crude. There are a few items such as Maggi with Shredded Cheese, which one may try out for fun. I liked the sandwiches which they serve at prices which are average. 

 I am a supporter of small business and love a novel idea. But I am finding it hard to digest the modus operandi. I guess this is a penny saver if one considers the immediate neighborhood of Park Street. If you don't have any other options left, head over for a snack.

Chakraborty Tip : I'd rather die famished with hunger, than eat a plate of maggi, top ramen or wai wai noodles at Rs. 30. It's a matter of principles.

This tiny place is tucked in a corner beside the Manyavar store in Park Street, opposite to Allen Park. When you walk past this place, the smell of hot maggi and cheese won't fail to tickle your nose. If you are hungry, roaming nearby and have almost nothing in your pocket, do not overlook this place. Their service is super fast. The prices are very low. Food is quite tasty and filling. Try out the veg cheese sandwich and the cheese maggi (they do put a lot of grated cheese) with a cup of tea or coffee. You can either stand and eat or just parcel the food.
