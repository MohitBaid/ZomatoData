It's located near my high school. So there was a time when I used to be a frequent customer of this shop. It's an average shop near kadamtala and their prices for items are fair enough. But there's no uniqueness like no special sweet. One may get the same items in other near shops as well or may get some items a bit cheaper than this shop.

After a long time I came to this place while getting back after hopping some pujas of Howrah, to bring some sweets for desert for Ashtami dinner at home.. this isn't very near to my place, I'd been there for a couple of times while I was a kid with my mom.. she used to take me to a Doctor had his dispensery nearby..
And suddenly the idea came to my mind to search it on Zomato.. and as I see.. no review yet..
So.... Â let me be the first..

well..
by look.. it is nothing but a small Sweet Shop.. but when it comes to the taste.. that's awesome..
All sweets are damn good.. I specially like the "Sita Bhog" the most.. a smooth taste with the flavor of Gawa Ghee.. something you can't forget..

but.. the prices are a bit more high. a few items costs me more than 100 bucks..
