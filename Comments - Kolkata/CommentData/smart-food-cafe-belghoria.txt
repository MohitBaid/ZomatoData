They don't have a seating arrangement but..the food they deliver is of great quality..the use minimum oil..which makes the food irresistible..they have some mouth watering items..and hardly will burn a hole..

Horrible experience.
 They don't even have the dishes that are mentioned on the menu and their behaviour is very bad.
They even don't deliver the food.

The chicken tandoori is absolutely fantastic and magnificent..!! The prices are also very much reasonable. considering the quality. One of the best food station of sodpur area, anyone passing by should take a break and check out the mouth watering delicacies they fabricate. üòçüòç

The location is wrong,it is at Sodepur,Ghola Bazar,You should update it in your Website,otherwise everybody will be misguided.It is showing at Belgharia,instead of showing at Sodepur.

It's near to my house. Have tried a lot of different items. The momos are excellent. The chole and tadka r good, chicken tandoori is really very spicy. To be very frank I had tears in my eyes it was that much spicy. The rolls r good in quantity and filling.

Near my house üè† great cafe.. Nicely cooking .. Pocket friendly menu., good hospitality.. For me this cafe is like a heaven... My every day order is egg chicken noodles üçú... Tandoori chicken is also mouth watering ... The most interesting is the menu, so many dishes, perfect place near PNB Ghola ... Just awesome, only thing is missing is ambience ... But that can be overlooked ...
