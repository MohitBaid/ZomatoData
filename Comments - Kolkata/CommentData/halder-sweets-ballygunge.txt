Good sweets... Compared to other unmentionable shops, it is of a higher standard... But in comparison to the "mistir dokan" scenes in kolkata and weighing against the Balarams and Gangurams... It still has some distance to cover.

One of the best Bengali Sweet shops in the area. Not much expensive. Each and every items are worth the price. Have been enjoying their sweets for more than a decade now. Simply the best in the area according to me.PS: In case you are planning to have singaras(samosas) on a Sunday evening, do hurry as stocks will run out soon as everyone in the neighbourhood wanrt to enjoy a snack on a Sunday evening.Â :p
