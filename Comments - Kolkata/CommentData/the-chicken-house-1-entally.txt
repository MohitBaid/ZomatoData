Located amidst the lanes of Entally this is a small newly formed street-food shop selling tasty chicken items. Nice, crispy and fresh chickens at an affordable price. Honestly speaking i would prefer this over kfc in terms of food and price. Seatings for around 6-8 people available. Homedelivery also available. Service is really good. The man on the cash counter is so humble. Tried hot crispy wings, hot crispy chest, chicken cheese burger. Surely a must visit place. üíØ

My friend took me to this food joint, never expected that I would walk out of this place with one single choice for future, that if I want to try fried versions of chicken items, it has to be The ChickenHouse. I loved the freshness of chicken, unlike the usual frozen stuff that we come across- it is fresh n juicy, crispy n yummy. I am in love with the chicken popcorn and was surprised with the quantity that they serve at that price. I loved the burger n the wings as well, and I will strongly recommend the pakoras... they taste different than the standard ones that we come across, it's so crispy n yummy!
I have planned the snacks for my kid's birthday from here, and I understand they have very interesting packages for such parties. The ChickenHouse has definite potential to give KFC a run for the money, double the satisfaction at less than half the price. why not? am definitely on for it! Hope they will start online delivery soon.

Me and my friend were hungry and so we stumbled upon this place located on the bylanes of Entally. The first thing I noticed upon entering is that the owner was a very nice and humble gentleman, who really made sure that the chicken served to us was fresh
Coming to the food
Chicken Burger - Can certainly give KFC a run for their money.
Chicken Pakoda - A medium sized piece of fried chicken , which was again cooked to perfection.
Overall, a heart warming experience...

Very good food. Loved the crispy wings and popcorn. Very good quantity for the popcorn and French fry,  my kids loved it a lot. Recommend visit with kids. They have seating arrangements too but that needs some more work.
