This place is the sister concern of its next door neighbour, Bhaijaan. It is a takeaway and also has a catering service facility. Cleanliness seems to be top priority in the eatery as well as during catering. The food, however, is of average taste. The noodles served here are the thickish egg noodles common in tangra chinese restaurants and taste good. The friedrice is a glorified pilaf though. In fact, pilaf tastes better. The chef recommends red devil chicken, but my advice is to stick to the chilli chicken,unless you are a fan of sweetish sesame flavoured chicken.
Though the catering staff was mostly pleasant, one of our guests complained that he was checked for taking extra helpings, which, I feel, was quite on the off side of professionalism in the field of catering.
