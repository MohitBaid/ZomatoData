The only appreciable thing about this place is it's location and the fact there are no other places which provides alchohol in the vicinity.The space inside is huge but has not been utilized in any way.The food is average and so is the service.There is no decor,crockery and cutlery used is sub standard and furniture is bad.

Visited the restaurant around 12:30 at night. Believe me it was almost jam packed. We ordered a butter chicken and butter naans. The naan was amazing, a bit sweet, soft and tasty. It really complimented the bit spicy butter chicken. Nice experience.

The place is nice for a highway stopover. The food tastes amazing. But the service takes a hit as the allocation and management of staff is not up to mark. The air conditioned area doesn't function properly and the space is too crunched to sit. They should try changing the furniture as its too old and uncomfortable. Otherwise for a highway stopover it's one of the best.

It's not that the food is bad, or the ambience unsavoury. But the service is so terribly screwed up that it ruins the entire mood. 
And God help you if you ever come here on a holiday. The waiting period is bad as it is (for us, it was close to two hours). Then you find a table and think that you'll finally get to eat. Surprise! The food will take another 45 minutes. Even the fresh lime soda took half an hour to arrive. If you're still hungry after all this time, good for you. 
By the way, the food is not worth the wait, in case you were wondering.

Visited on Christmas afternoon. Place was moderately crowded. Ample seating area. We sat in the outdoor seating area since the weather was so good. Had sarson saag and makke ki roti as well as pineapple raita, and food was good enough. The best part was that it wasn't very hard on the pocket. Service can be improved.

Awsome place to dine in. The open air seating arrangement is pretty cool. This place is always crowded. Yet, service is not bad. Coming to the food, none of the items dissapointed me. Be it the afghani chicken, or tandoori chicken, the moctails, naan, paneer, etc. Worth recommending is the rara mutton. Bit spicy, but very tasty.

This place is loved by all chicken tandoori lovers. They serve good veg food too. Recently enjoyed lovely makke di roti and sarso ka saag. They have quick service and different seating areas. I love the open area which has got some plants and tress which has tiny fairy lights around it .they keep small lantern over the table thats makes the place look very special. they have put up a big screen too to enjoy sports. Newly relaunched family section is also very brightly done. Very good option on the highway. Wish they keep the place tidy too.

The place has inside dinning area + outside garden area too. I love the food here too. It's cheap and it's delicious. It's authentic. 
I make sure to visit this place whenever I visit Kolkata

You have options for having inside ac and outside in the open lawn which is good. Now let's come to the food. It's good but not extra ordinary. But the food was fresh.

I along with my four friends stopped by Sher E Punjab, Sukantanagar on 22nd Oct to have a leisurely lunch with a beer or two. We were returning from Madhyamgram and checked in around 2.30 ‚Äì 3.00 PM. There was no rush and we got seated ourselves in the non AC open section of the restaurant. We had to change table as it smelt foul due to some drain around. All of us had been to this place umpteen number of times. Let me sum up the sequence of the lunch:

Ordering Beer and Fresh Lime: We asked for Kingfisher Ultra. But there were none except Carlsberg Strong. Surprising! Anyways, we ordered Carlsberg Strong and two Salted Fresh Lime for two of our teetotaller friends. We also ordered the lunch along with the beer but with a direction to serve it after the beer is over. The fresh lime was completely forgotten to be served. The person who took the order did not write it in the order. When we enquired after half an hour, it was served after an argument with the waiter. The waiter was blaming the person who took the order and blah blah.

Complimentary Starters: Beer was served. We had ordered Pindi Chana and Mixed Raita for our lunch but the waiter served it as per starter along with the Beer. We could not understand whether to laugh, cry or shout. The complimentary savouries were not served without being asked for. The regulatory ginger julienne and onion was also not served. On being given a shout, the ginger julienne was somehow arranged from the non veg kitchen but it had neither salt, chat masala or the compulsory lemon juice. We were getting fed up. On being given a shout again, some chilly/lemon along with some chat masala was given on the table. Mind it; there was no salt/peeper or chat masala on the table. We requested for some chutney and the waiter served us a very large bowl (say 500 ML) chutney. We were flabbergasted but kept our composure. We returned the chutney and asked him to bring a small helping in a small bowl.¬† ¬†

Lunch: We had ordered Tarka, Sahi Paneer, Chana Pindi, Navratan Korma, mixed raita along with Crisp tandoori roti. The Pindi Chana and raita was served as starters along with Beer: :) :) Let me describe the food one by one now:

‚Ä¢	Tarka: It was watery and the worst I had in recent memory.

‚Ä¢	Sahi Paneer : Nothing to remember and write about. It is a shame on an Authentic Punjabi Dhaba.

‚Ä¢	Chana Pindi: It was a starter as per the waiter but we had ordered for lunch. It was stone dry, tasteless as it did not have requisite salt and neither the lemon juice for the tanginess required.

‚Ä¢	Mixed raita: It was normal but was served along with beer as starter: :)
‚Ä¢	Navratan Korma: It seemed to be a tasteless concoction of few leftover vegetables. Completely shitty.

‚Ä¢	Crisp Tandoori Roti: We specifically ordered for Crisp Tandoori Roti but we were served soggy ones. When my friend complained to the waiter that he has been coming to Sher E Punjab for last 15 years but never experienced such a worse food and service till date. The waiter answered ‚ÄúI have been working here for last 12 years but have never seen you‚Äù. The waiter was very arrogant. On being asked to replace one of the rotis for a crisp one, he shouted back and refused to do so on the pretext as why have we taken the roti on our plates if it was not ok. Anyways, he relented and replaced one of the rotis after my friend turned very angry.

It was a forgettable lunch that left a bad taste in the mind as well as the tongue.¬†

My Rating:

Taste : 1/5
Service : 1/5

It is situated at Michel Nagar Very near from Post Office. This is a Very renounced Dhaba cum restaurant.
It is a open road dhaba at Joshore road. Many people come here with their families.
We ordered Chicken Tanduri, Rumali Roti, Chicken Hongkong. 
The taste of all food was very tasty and the atmosphere was awsam.
It is quite costly but need to improve their services and also needed food service skills.

Ordered Tandoori roti , chicken tandoori , chicken tikka butter masala and lassi . The Tandoori chicken was little over grilled but it was good & others were really tasty I personally recommend chicken tikka masala .
For drinks we opted for tuborg strong and carslberg strong . They didn't had any other not even a premium beer . Over all we had a quality time there üçª

This outlet of Sher-e-Punjab is located in Sukantanagar, near Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose International Airport. If you want to go out for a long drive and then have lunch/dinner somewhere, this is one of the ideal places to eat. The place is extremely spacious. It has both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements. We chose the AC (indoor) seating. We ordered Crispy Chicken, Tandoori Chicken, Tandoori Roti, Kasha Mangso, Mixed Raita and Kulfi. The food was excellent and both the quality and quantity was satisfying. The people there are courteous and polite. Definitely a recommended place for everyone.

This serves as one of my go to north indian joints if ever i am visiting the airport. 
The kabab's here are just very good. 
If ever i come down i dig down to their Reshmi kabab and malai kabab. 
The biriyani here is also delightfull, it will impress your taste buds to a good amount. 
Apart from these the kulcha is something that you can try. 
The chicken dishes from the main course are also very pleasing to have,specially Reshmi butter chicken and the handi chicken. These two preparations for me are the star performers here. 
Something that i would like to take up as a negative note from this place is the behaviour of the staff . They often are very inappropriate and bad with their behaviour. This joint has to work on this part on a swift basis. 
I definitely recommend this place if you really root for some good meat. 
This gets a 'Must try' tag from me.

I visited this place on Ashtami. It is very close to my house but it's weird that it was my first time visit. It was fully packed on the day we visited. We had to wait for 15-20mins to get a seat.

Coming to our order, the menu was very much limited because of the rush they had on Ashtami. So we ordered Chicken Kolapuri, Chicken Bharta and Chicken Butter Masala with tandoori roti. I did not like the taste of Chicken Kolapuri. It was not that good as compared to the other dishes. I personally liked the Bharta I surely recommend that. 

The service was pretty promt as the restaurant was fully packed but they still managed to deliver a good service. 
No pictures this time as I was tooo hungry to click pictures.

One of the worst experience if one is looking for good food. We had ordered for the basic mutton kosha and laccha Paratha. The taste was really bad. The mutton kosha was bland and lacked flavors. We had also ordered Tandoori Chicken which was also not up-to the mark. Definitely avoid the above items if you happen to be there but it's best to avoid the place altogether. Complete waste of time money and a mood spoiler üôÅ

Visited this place a month back. Located near Micheal Nagar Post Office. Though not nicely decorated but a moderate place to grab a sit and satisfy one's hunger. The staffs were courteous. We had
1. Navaratan Polao(105/-)
2. Tandoori Roti(17/- per piece)
3. Chicken Banjara (210/-)
4. Tutti Futti Bucket (160/-)
The dishes were delicious with the classic dhaba essence. The Navaratan polao was consisted of shredded cottage cheese and sweet corn and these two were adding nice flavours to it. The Chicken preparation was also tasty. Lastly the dessert "Tutti Futti" was stuffed with fresh fruits and two-in-one ice cream and was served in a cute little bucket. Shall visit again :)

I went to the esplanade branch before. But went there for the first time.

As it's Durga Pujo we decided to get some hard drinks.

So, we ordered two Beer , two Butter Nun and two Butter Chicken.

The staffs are extremely polite even the owner also. At the time of leaving the table I broke a glass by my bag as I didn't notice the glass there. And they were still wearing big smiles. And moreover, they served us food so property and with discipline.

I completely loved this joint.

A yumm dinner, in the middle of the night. Its very close to my house but, very weird it was my first time visit in so many years. We were dying of hunger so ordered half chicken tandoori, reshmi chicken butter masala, tandoori rotis and masala kulcha. I kinda fell for the tandoori, it was so tasty so spicy and well cooked. And the dhania chutney was to die for. Rotis were pretty good pretty basic. However reshmi masala stole the show. It was what you call "PERFECT ", chicken was so tender and literally falling apart. They serve it boneless. Gravy was amazing with all the cashew paste and spices well blended inside. Rich creamy taste it gave. I couldn't figure out why they separate the alcohol bill and ask to be paid by cash. Anyway so impressed with this place, will visit more!

Today i ordered chicken tandoori,masala kulcha, kashmiri aloo dum,green peas masala and kadai fish. Masala kulcha was good and soft tandoori chicken was also nice.what i liked most was kasmiri aloo dum..was a bit sweet to taste.kadai fish was ok..fish should have been more soft..but green peas masala was a disappointment.overall nice food and good behaviour. Recommend to have masala kulcha aloo dum and ckicken tandoori.

They have separate seating arrangements for family to enjoy their foods and drinks and they also have outdoor seating arrangements in the evening.

The interiors are average. The food is good nothing exceptional. The prices are reasonable.
They offer both chinese and indian delicacies on the menu.

In my last visit I ordered
‚óá Tandoori Roti (2)
‚óá Butter Naan (1)
‚óá Lachha Paratha (1)
‚óá Jeera Rice (1)
‚óáTawa Mutton (1)
‚óáGreen Salad
‚óáTuborg (650ml)

The bill was of 856 INR inclusive of taxes which is reasonable.
The tandoori rotis were not so good as it was a bit burnt. The quantity of jeera rice served was less.
The service is good.

Located just a kilometre away from airport. Three type of seatings are available - AC, Open air and Normal Non AC. You can dine in any of the place. You can have a good view of flights landing and take off. It have a live counter for food and specially separate live counters for non veg and veg. Food quality is good but not that much great. They will charge 18% GST where ever you dine in whether AC or Non AC. This is a controversial part as the restaurant needs to follow the govt. norms of 18% fo AC seating and 12% for Non AC seating.

An over hyped out of town restaurant in Kolkata. Prior to visiting this place, I have heard a lot about it. But my visit confirmed this to be a 'just another diner'. 

Plus points
1. Situated on the highway, and gives a good place for bachelor hangout.
2. Tandoori items are just great. Afghani Chicken is my all time favourite. 

Minus Points 
1. Its hype, which let's you down, because you tend to over expect 
2. Crowded and not tidy. They should work on improving the hygiene of this restaurant.

If you want authentic punjabi food, don't even bother to go anywhere else.... THE BEST PUNJABI GOOD IS HERE. Everything here is great. From the chicken to the mutton. From the laccha paratha to the tandoori

The place is huge with a lot of seating arrangement, Open air, Ac and Non-Ac. Appeared a bit shady at first glance. But we tucked ourselves in the AC section which had better crowd. Whenever visiting a dhaba like this, one has to keep aside the thoughts of cleanliness and ambience, for sure. The main USP must be the food, so was expecting the food to be very good, to overpower the drawback.
We ordered sweet corn soup and paneer tikka for starters. Both of them were good.
For main course we had, shahi paneer, dal makhani and alu do pyaza with masala kulcha and garlic naan. The food was decent and the service was prompt. One can visit, when near the airport and when the mind needs to relax away from the city life.

From outside you can not feel how big is this place... It have 2 AC seating area one for normal crowd n another for the family... Also they have a Non AC seating n open air seating arrangements too... Overall ambience is so so nothing extraordinary... But the service is promt... Bar is available here... We tried there mutton sheek kabab, mixed veg and butter nan... All were very tasty, but the mutton kabab deserves a special mention... Pocket pinch is on the higher side... Bit unhygienic place... But still worth a visit...

Located just beside the jessore road at michal nagar near madhyamgram.This joint has both indoor n outdoor setup.Ambience is good...staffs are well behaved and efficient.Tandoori chicken is a must try over there...I faced a bit challenge while tearing apart the tandoori rotis...but handi chicken n kolhapuri chicken were just amazing.Quality/taste wise i guess it's quite good but quantity they provide is a bit on lesser side...One can go and try out....food is good.

We sat in the open area which was so relaxing.
Pocket friendly eatery. Very well behaved staff.
What we ordered-
Palak paneer
Butter naan
Handi meat
Kashmiri pulao
Navratan pulao
Kulfi
Blue lagoon
Lassi, & drinks
Food was good, but quantity is less. So keep that in mind while ordering.
P.S- Girls.. Be cautious of the crowd around & keep you eyes & ears open.
Happy eating üòä

One of the most third class dine places. Staffs behaviours are much rude, table arrangements are too bad, food taste is not upto the mark & food quality, auugghh it's horrible. I don't know but should visit the kitchen to know how they maintain it. Because I believe the kitchen is much unhygenic. Me & my friends had dinner over there & then from the mid night three of us suffered by de-hydration, it such a ridiculous experience. And top of that, they serve alchohol but they don't have menu & take only cash, no wallet, no card as it is recognized by road side dhaba. It was the first time & it was the last time we went. Never ever will visit this place. Poor one.

Located at Michael Nagar, near Airport....One of the best place for friends and Office colleagues to gather and have chit chat. I went to this restaurant for the first time when I was a kid and still often visit here these days, whenever we plan to have a group party or small budget lunch/dinner (its been more than 20 years) and that proves the success of this restaurant, as they still managed to serve with same standard. Well not much sure about the Veg items, but in Non veg, their Kebabs and main course are quite good as compared to few other costly Dhabas in Kolkata. In starter, my all time favorite is there Chicken Tandoor dish, in maincourse, Handi Mutton, Mutton Rogan Josh, Chicken Kadhai, Chicken Kohlapuri, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, all are simply superb. One important thing is that they also serve Chinese foods, which might not be that extraordinary good, but surprisingly better than few small Chinese restaurants around the corners of Kolkata. It is quite spacious as it has two A.C, One Non A.C in house and Open space Seating arrangements and a Banquate Hall too. Overall a very favorite place of mine. Recommended to others who like to have good food at low cost.

And for mains, we ordered naan, hyderabadi chicken and chicken bharta. The food did not disappoint me because it tasted really good, staffs were courteous and the place was nice.

Very close to my house, this is a place where I hop in if i want some punjabi food. 
They serve alcohol, has two separate areas- an open air place and another air conditioned place for dining. 
They have amazing food. 
We had chicken bharta, butter masala and rumali roti. 
Each of them were well cooked and yummy. 
Easy on pocket too.

The food is not so bad. The service is ok. The best part of the place is the open air dining area and live screening of IPL matches there. There are also many options for the customers i.e they have both family with ac section and non-ac section separated from the open-air dining section where people normally sit relax and drinks alcohol. So almost all kind of people can visit this place.

This restaurant is situated on the highway near Michael Nagar. there's a lot of seating arrangement available open air, A/C. The staff is uncultured and not friendly, rude to be true, ambience sucks. Well we ordered a half tandoori chicken and Reshmi Kebab along with soft drinks. The Tandoori Chicken was too small to describe, might be the chicken was not fed properly to grow up big. The Tandoori Chicken was too spicy, the onions provided was all dry, guess last night's leftover. The Reshmi Kebab was a real pain, not marinated properly at all.the Chicken Pieces were too small. The onions provided was dry no lemon pieces provided. Also the green chutney provided was 3rd class. The Cold drink provided was not put in a glass. Water was not served till the end nor were we asked if we wanted a Mineral water. Too be true this people are earning a lot I guess and are not bothered about customer service. The bill was total of 398Rs and I had tendered a RS 500 note, had to wait for 10 mins to get back the change. Not a good place to visit with your partner.

Chicken/mutton Handi and chicken bharta- delicious as hell. Try with pulao or nan. 
Please do not go for fried rice with any Indian dish. Its a bad combo.
Try cool lassi at the end.

The last time I had been to this place was around 7-8 years back and was very regular around that time. I had some work in that area so decided to visit them for lunch and enjoy the food.
I WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH EVERYTHING AROUND THE PLACE. There is not a single space where I can say this was at least average. With this experience; I feel Zomato must include ratings of zero; -1,-2,-3,-4 and -5. I would give it a -5. Even the air conditioners were not functioning well. Just enough so that diners dont choke. Even the prices given to Zomato and the actual menu does not match. They menu at the outlet is far more by around 15-20%.
Firstly, the waiter came with a sour face after beckoning him about 4-5 times. He took the order. I ordered Chicken Reshmi Kabab and Paneer Tikka as starters. Both were nothing to write about. I had asked for a healthy portion of salads in these tandoor items; he made it a point to serve the salad as meagre as possible. 
I ordered egg curry and plain tarka fry. I had requested to make it spicy. He came twice to confirm the order. I dont know why. He ended up serving us Amritsari Tarka and that too it was horribly flat with a tinge of sweetness. I pointed it to the senior steward and he just nodded his head and disappeared. We did not see him after that. The egg tarka itself was also bad. Even during the meal we had to literally wait for the waiter to show his face to reorder the rotis. Thankfully he did turn up but after a long long time.¬† 
We somehow finished the food and asked for desserts. As expected; our choice was not available; in fact only two items of around 7-8 of them was available. 
As per the law prevailing; I declined to pay the service charge and informed them before the billing. They looked aghast at the idea but did agree after a bit of dilly dallying because I pointed out the law to them. I did tip the waiter but only due to ethicacy.
A few friends who have visited recently have also been dished out sub standard food and non existent service. I somehow decided to still try them and did surely make a big mistake !!!!! NEVER AGAIN !!!!

Jessore road adjacent, Sher e Punjab is one of the popular most dhaba and we had several family lunches here. Usually went with the egg tadka, butter naan, shahi panner and kashmiri pulao mostly followed by the lassi to end with.

It's a nice place if you are with fruends, the service is not very good but it's OK. The food is moderate at times the food is over cooked. I visit this place quite often and have to say the prices of items are reasonable. Afghani chicken is a very good option  for starters and chicken butter masala tastes good. Rest of the items are average nothing special. If they can work on service and guest handling it would be great.

The restaurant staff really need training. They are downright rude, uncaring and care two hoots if you don't like the food. Or maybe that's how the Management itself is.

We have been here several times before but the recent experience is clearly the worst.

The two rating is due to its previous history of being a good joint. As of now it deserves a minus five.

I don't know how did you make your interview but "this girl"(according to you) can't be so wrong Mr/Mrs M Bis.First of all that girl has a specific name so try to say that instead of "this girl" to give proper respect to anyone.
Two months ago I also went there for dinner with my family and we also had few terrible experiences in that restaurant.Sher-e-punjub is a big name in restaurant industry.We also had tried other outlets of sher-e-punjub but we never expected such behaviour from this restaurant.That time I didn't post anything but after Vijaya Das incident I think that I should post my experience also.
Two months ago at the night of vaifota my elder sister was giving a treat to us.So we decided to come here.We were 9 people including me.When we reached,there were no table available for 9 person but many tables for 4 person were available that time.So we asked one staff to arrange two tables together so that we can sit,but that staff roughly said that can't be arranged so we have to wait.Then the time was nearly 10pm.After that they made us wait for more than 1 hour and finally we got our table at 11:15pm.Then the staff inside said that maximum dishes were unavailable that time so we had to order food according to them.We all ordered roti and some side dishes but one of us only ordered rice.Roti and other side dishes came first and we started to eat.After that 20-30 min had past but still rice hadn't come yet.So we asked the staff and then he told us rice is not available anymore. That's mean if we didn't ask the staff then one of us had to sit with hunger for all the time.But still we didn't say anything.But that was not enough.After few minutes of that they switched off all the AC and fans and then we protest that and asked for the manager. I don't know was he manager or owner but he made us more shocked. Generally if customers are not happy with the service then manager try to satisfy them but in that case the manager's behaviour was very rude. He had his own ego and acted like we were blessed for getting dinner there. He never tried to satisfy us but he literally argued with us and clearly said us not to come here again.
We were very much disappointed by the behaviour of staffs and our night was so spoiled. Here Sher-e-punjub is a big brand but we never expected such behaviour from a outlet of Sher-e-punjub.

Rude , ill mannered and¬† not patient while taking orders 

If u want to have a great time and punjabi foods azad hind dhaba , honey da dhaba¬† is way better

Been here yesterday. Over-priced, less quantity. Staff makes me feel like a sarkari(govt) office. No one bothers about your order or suggestion. You have to eat whatever and whenever they serve.

Overpriced food as the taste is not so good. Plus the quantity of portions served is also too less. The staff members including the management team are also very lazy and inactive.

Was an incredible restaurant during my childhood. Of late they have become too commercialized with overpriced menu. The portions given for the price is pretty low considering the very average quality of food. Nowadays i would only go there for the cheap alcohol.

I have been to this place a couple of times, it used to be a patent for our family outings. The food was excellent, I specially liked their tandoori chicken, chicken dopyaza and the handi mutton.
As for ambiance, we used to prefer dining out in the open, it used to be a peaceful and serene experience.

Kolkatans are not unusual in their adulation of any restaurant coming out of Park street,or in their belief that taking a hike along Vip road would take them further away from gastronomic puritanism.Yet the penchant for places like Sher e Punjab(barasat) or dada boudi(barrackpore) remains¬† out of the ordinary .A long weekend drive to the suburbs usually isn‚Äôt complete without¬† a drop by in these two.
What, in the past, used to by taken as a byword for ‚Äòdelicious‚Äô ‚Äî an attribute naturally coexisting with merely the ability to be agreeable to the taste buds ‚Äî has today been legitimized as ‚Äòaesthetically and palatably pleasant‚Äô.Keeping that in mind,all the items we ordered-Egg noodles,Navratan pulao,shahi paneer and a mango mocktail failed to live upto their billing.The navratan pulao could be anaphylactic to a diabetic due to its disheartening sugar content,while shahi paneer and the mocktail closely resembles the¬† effort of a newbie homemaker who had to put her favourite star plus serial on hold.The egg noodle or chowmein would prove to be the saving grace of that¬† Sunday brunch.
However,what mostly contributed to this 1/5 rating is not their food but the service,which brings up a statutory warning from this reviewer.

Statutory warning-Ordering a parcel from Sher-e-punjab can be injurious to your wallet or your general state of mind ,or both.

We had the misfortune of ordering a dish of palak paneer as take away.It was meant for dinner,and what soon became apparent at home was that they had packed¬† a dish¬† of ‚Äúpaneerless palak‚Äù(image attached at the end of this review).While such mistakes might happen outside of free will in busy hours,the same thing happening on a Sunday noon,when the place bears the semblance of a despondent Marxist rally,requires both caution and close examination.However,there exists but a thin line between justness and vindication,and not to end up on the wrong side of that line,I mailed the restaurant on Sunday night itself,apprising them of the folly and giving them a chance to explain themselves.It has been five days,and there has been no communication from their side whatsoever.
This lack of regard for customer satisfaction seems inclement at best,delinquent at worst.

Sher-e-Punjab is associated with a lot of nostalgia for us Bengalis. This has remained the go-to place for long drives and lip smacking kababs. Their north Indian dishes are very popular and tasty. Must visit with family and friends. Its always bustling with people.

For a place like Barasat this one is very nice and i would recommend any passerby to visit there you wont be disappointed. As any restaurant in Barasat is not that frequently visited by people unless there is an occasion, so i would recommend you to choose ypur dishes wisely. Avoid mutton and opt for kebabs instead of curries.
ambience- average
food - average
staff- polite enough only during taking our orders . We were the only people during lunch last friday and I must say we got a lot of stares , which made the ladies a bit uncomfortable . I dont know the reason behind . The security guard stared till we all disappeared.

A dhaba cum restaurant type place. There food is tasty especially aloo do pyaza and there breads are also fresh and soft.
Coming on rates so its easily affordable but since the restaurant is on highway sometimes you will find cheap crowd which is kind of uncomfortable.
Staffs are also good but could be more humble.

Been to this place many times. There has been a gradual price hike along with detoriation of the quality of food.
The place has upgraded on its ambience. We went to the ac restuarant section which was empty. However the dhaba section was crowded and almost full.
The lighting needs to improve. Very dim and not really suited for a punjabi dhaba restuarant which is expected to be bright and colourfull. The decor was plain okayish with nothing special to mention about.
Service is slow. The waiters have a laid back attitude and you cant expect a prompt service in this ac section.
I would recommend you to go to the dhaba section( i think it is ac too, hygeinic and clean with proper searing arrangment) until it is absolutely neccesary to use the ac restuarant section.
Coming to the food, i have tried various items fron this place.
The navaratna pulao deserves a special mention. The butter naans or masala kulcha wont disappoint you.
The fish kababs are must in here. Nicely grilled and charred on the outside and flaky and tender on the inside, implying fresh fish is used.
The chicken malai kabab and afghani chicken are top pick in the kebab menu. Never tried mutton.
Next we tried fish butter masala. The same fish kababs are smeared in a rich buttery gravy. Tasted good. The green chutney provided as condiment is lipsmacking and truly complements the kebabs.
We always order for the chicken kolapuri, chicken hydrebadi and chicken bharta (shredded) as these are having boneless options. Nothing much to write about. Chicken kolapuri tastes slightly better.
The gravy dishes are not something to brag about. Fairly basic and smtyms overspiced.
The lime soda and kesar lassi is very good in taste. You can try them as your post meal digestive cum dessert. They also have a bar but never tried any drinks from here.
Never tried their chinese cuisine. Next, eager to try chicken lollipop, pomphret tandoori and chicken butter masala.
I felt prices are on the higher side compared to food.
I have gvn +0.5 for the kebabs, spclly the fish and chicken malai kabab.

I am visiting this place for the past 10 years now. I must confess that things have changed a lot here. They obviously do not provide the tasty and quality food they used to even 2 years back. Prices are normal though but a lot has to be taken care while preparing because half the time the tandoor items,kebab and friedrice remain half cooked and half boiled. 
But then,since this is a place where I have lots of memories I would like to visit again perhaps with an expectation of getting some mindblowing experience  in terms of food. :)

this is not our first visit to the place though. we have visited this place a couple of times earlier and we knew that the first thing we want to order was the afghani murgh. the meat was sinfully tender and flavourful. the aroma was enough to make us drool. next came butter naan. have to admit that i have eaten better versions of them at the same outlet earlier. naan was followed by rara gosht. the keema was good but the mutton was tough and chewy and it tasted like boiled mutton. not their best food on that day but i sm certainly going back for those awesome afghani murgh.

This is one of the oldest restaurants near airport . In my early childhood , dining out was synonymous to sher-e-punjab. However with time the synonyms and definitions have changed. This restaurant is mainly famous for north Indian cuisine. I like their chicken handi and naan. Good. But definitely not the best. Spacious. Service is okay.

Quality has deteriorated compared to the first time i visited here. Whatever we tried to order the waiter molded and fed us of his own choice. We order for masala kulcha and we got a stuff which tastes like aloo paratha instead. This place is famous for its lassi but it was over by 9pm only. The chicken bharta and chicken kashmiri was good and had true indian flavours.

It was Saptami, and finally i ticked off my bucket list with this place. ¬†It was crowded like anything but still we decided to give it a shot and after a solid 45 minutes, we found ourselves cramped in a corner. The menu card was served in a flash and the orders were taken in a jiffy.

We started off with two rounds of black dog gold reserve, and i must admit that the service was brilliant, even with such a crowd. We decided to go with the recommendations of the house and they served us with,

Afghani Chicken: Soft, tender and the spices had a blast inside our mouth, great appetizer to start off with
Chicken Reshmi Kebab: The traditional kebabs from the Lucknow house and you cant really review about it
Tandoori roti: The usual, we went for 2 pieces apiece
Tandoori Chicken in Butter Masala: This was a legendary hit, as at one side there was the charm of the smoke and grill and it essentially mixed with the molten butter. It still lingers on my mouth

Chicken Bharta: A visit to a dhaba is incomplete without a bharta, and this was no exception.
The extra brownie points for keeping up the quality even during the rush during the pujas

Enjoy your food while watching flights landing at Airport
Very Close to Airport,Sher E Punjab is a nice place to hang out with friends or go out dining with family. 
The place provides you with different sitting options
If You wanna have a dining with A.C. You have that & if you want to enjoy the fresh air you have that option too.
Nice parking place in front of the hotel
But make sure you have a private car or enough charge & net balance to call Ola or Uber 
Food is nice specially Chicken Afghani & Chicken Lollupop &-yes you do have the option to enjoy your chilled beer or whisky with it.

Knowing this place since childhood as the best food stop for long drives, automatically makes me crave to stop here during my last trip to the seas.But oh whatta disappointment!!! Really not worth the money and time.
Orders- Our good old fav' Doi Bhetki along with Doi Ilish,Tandoori Roti,Chicken Tandoori,Butter Chicken,Chilly Chicken,Noodles,Crispy baby corn.
Quality- None were appealing at all.Strangely found all of the dishes salty except the Chicken Tandoori.The Chicken Tandoori,for which this place is famous,lacks the flavour,aroma and of course the taste.When we enquired of whether the cook has been changed the waiter informed us of no change.The preparation of Doi Ilish with jeera(whole cumin seeds),instead of "shorshe" (ground mustard seeds' paste)compounded the setback.Except the "chai" we could not appreciate anything here.
Would not choose this dhaba next time. Instead would like to try the new joints around this place.The place could no longer hold back the heritage.It could have been the "cherry-on-the-cake" for the lovely weekend trip we had but alas!

I personally didn't like that. Takes almost 45 mins to serve ur food! Ordered mixed schezwan fried rice, chinese chopsuey, chicken reshmi kebabs, garlic chicken, tutty fruity bucket and their traditional lassi which was a delight!

Great food good service proper dhaba style! Only complaint I have is we asked for Dal Makhni and I was just like a Dhaba tarka! Unacceptable, to add to the worry they charged for some packing take away containers (we had a packing order also for a friend) and they charged for 2 boxes for packing  1 main course! That is totally not ethical guys anyways I know they don't care but this is for viewers to be careful and dbl chk their bills before paying at times they can be cheeky

Last night we have been here for a family dinner after 23 years. We used to be very regular here during 1991-93. Things have changed since then. Their service standard has gone horribly wrong. After we got our table, nobody bothered to place water tumblers for about 15 minutes, they didnt even turn the AC on. We, actually, had to ask the captain for both. Neither, anyone bothered to take our order

We ordered for Non-Veg Kebab Platter, Chicken Sizzler, Bhuna Gosht, Butter Nan & Mango Flamingo for Dinner and Chicken Bharta For A Take Away. Out of which chicken sizzler was by no mean a sizzler, it wasn't smoky, neither french fries were properly fried. Bhuna Gosht was "SOUR" in taste

Lots of improvements are required

Visited it around 9pm while returning from weekend holiday. Ordered haka noodles, reshmi kebabs, hot and sour chicken. The kebabs were awesome,juicy yet not breaking apart on plate. Somehow the noodles were not good. Contained quite low amount of chicken n use of soya sauce was extreme that made it bitter. Hot and sour chicken was good.

All the items were tasted sweet.. Don't know why !!! Waiters were not attentive. Even didn't get black pepper after asking 3-4 times. An utter disappointment. Will not go again.

Really bad food for the price these guys are charging, had Masala Kulcha, Reshmi butter masala chicken and kolhapuri chiken.
Masala Kulcha is basically nan stuffed with yesterdays leftovers.
Chicken RBM had too much kewra or some kind of artificial rich smell. could not have more than a peice.
Chiken kolhapuri was tomatoes, capsicum and chicken in tomato gravy, had no flavour except for tomatoes.
Even the mouth freshener they served was soggy.
They are in business coz they serve liquids.

We ordered for Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Bharta, Palak Paneer, Dal Makhani, Rara Mutton, Tandoori Plater, Rice, Roti. In drinks we had Heinekan Beer, Antiquity Whiskey, John Collins, Lime Cordial, Screw Driver, Smirnoff Vodka, White Mischief Vodka. For desserts we got Tutti Futti Bucket. Overall the food tasted good and the drinks were fine. Nice experience

It really feels like mordernised dhaba when you enter sher e punjab based on Jessore Road, nice to see that they have alloted separate space for friends and family.

I have visited 2 times, and the experience was nice.

Coming to food, first time I had my all time favourite, tawa fish mutton rara and butter naan.

I personally did not like the tawa fish, though it was not bad, however the muton rara was really awsome.

Second time I thought of having the Polao Dishes but regret to say the kashmiri polao was yet tasty but very low amount, very hard to fill for one person.

And then I had to order naan again, but the side dish kadhai mutton was really mouthwatering.

It was mouth watering. Coming to main course the chilli lamb was just awesome. Want to taste this again in our next visit. Service was ok. Overall experience was good except the service.

Visited this favourite joint of mine after a long hiatus of two decades since i shifted to the Southern part of the city. The only significant change which i noticed was the introduction of the AC dining section.The earlier indoor non-ac dining hall and the open dining area at the back remains unchanged.Thankfully the wonderful sight of flights landing at the airport just across the road is still unobstructed.¬†
Taste Wise, prices and quantity of food still remains unchanged.Perhaps we were lucky enough to order the right items.For starters ordered chilly fish and afghani chicken.Both were well made.The chicken pieces were soft and succulent and had the right proportion of burnt flavour in them.Fish item was just perfect - not too hot with an overwhelming presence of capsicum and green chillies.
In the main course we had butter naan,tadka dal,chicken bharta and mutton kadai. The mutton dish stole the show undoubtedly.Had four gigantic pieces-not too bony and the meat was boiled to perfection- a must in any mutton dish.The gravy was not too spicy and comprised of slices of onion and capsicum which added to the rustic flavour as is typical of any dhaba dish.The chicken bharta was equally well-made though some people might find it too sweet for their taste buds.The tadka dal was on expected lines.Nothing to add on that. The butter naan was soft and flaky and melt in your mouth types.Yummy indeed.
We had a couple of pegs and a bottle of strong beer to wash down our food :)
Prices are pocket friendly.Service of staff leaves much room for improvement.They need to be more attentive to address the needs of diners.Would treat it as a minor anomaly which can be easily rectified.
A must visit which doubles up as a long drive outing with the majestic view of flights landing at the airport.Cheers to that!!!
            
P.S.- For people who do not have their own transport - They can avail of services from app based cabs like Ola and Uber.I did and waiting time was cool 5 minutes only...BTW they also accept credit cards..

Only cons:
1. Low quality ambiance, low quality dining table and plates.
2. No separate AC family restaurant from bar.
2. Casual behaviour from waitors. Disobedience and ignorance.
3. Food quality is lowest. Got insect in chicken malai kebab. Stale babycorn starter.

We were 6 people. Ordered veg, chicken and mutton starters. First they gave 2 bisleri bottles and provided no glass. Then gave plates but no spoon. Then came babycorn starter but stale. Returned those, then they took away those along wid our plates. Now they gave non veg starter, but no sauce or chutney. Now we dont have plates too, to have chikn startr. Now chikn items were left to become cold until plates come, and not until we urged them. Then found an insect in one of the chikn malai kebab.
THATS IT !! No more consideration and we left.

Its located near Micheal Nagar after crossing Birati more, left side adjacent to Jessore Road. Taking personal car or cab is favourable, because after 8pm or 9pm you will not get anything. ¬†A proper Punjabi eating place with awesome food and having good amount of space. Sher-e-Punjab has a great range of north Indian foods and the taste keeps me overwhelmed everytime. It has several seating options both outdoor and indoor. Service is excellent. ¬†Everytime we booze there with chicken tandoori (must), Kolhapuri Chicken, Tandoori Roti, Butter nun, Dal Makhani, Mutton Roganjosh. The quality & quantity will never disappoint you.Must try restora if you want to booze with friends/ family dinner or if you are going a road trip through Jessore Road stretch..

The road has worsened over the years but it is still a place where "you can go for a long drive and eat here."¬†The space has expanded and is quite full during weekends.

located near the airport this place is always bustling..
The biggest problem is parking. When we reached the place the parking was full and the climb down was sharp and terrifying. The guard provided no assistance. We were a grp of 8 ppl and the moment we entered it was clear that finding abplace to sit would be difficult. There is an open area with a big screen and as the ipl final was going on it was choc-a-block. We finally accomodated ourselves in the ac dining area. It proved to be a misnomer as one of the ac s was not working thus it was humid inside.
We ordered tandoori roti, kadai chicken, dry chili chicken and bharta. The food was absolutely delicious splly the kadai chicken. There was also a bar and beer and breezer was also available.

Have been here today!! Had one of the worst dining experience ever had. We ordered for a tandoori platter,a handi chicken, butter nan and pineapple raita.
The food came in fast: the tandoori platter had assortment of chicken,fish,mutton. The fish tasted awful,the whole fish had a stinky smell and was actually raw. The mint chutney never had taste of any mint,i actually felt it was some kind of green paste with running water into it. It tasted like spinach paste and was lumpy and had water into it.There was actually three persons serving me,seen a first of a kind,one who took the order,one who served me and another who was attending me. 
Now into the main course: I don't know what chicken was served to me,I tasted first of its kind. There was 4 jumbo pieces of actually boiled chicken,put into a somewhat gravy with some onions,capcicum and tomatoes cubes. The tomatoes had eyes into it,even we don't use the same kind into the home. When asked to the waiter he said "this is our standard". The gravy tasted pathetic and we had to keep one piece of chicken as we couldn't eat boiled chicken.
The raita was more pathetic: it was just curd with few chunks of pineapple and sugar. We could have tasted the sugar in our mouth. Unable to grasp more I ordered for a butter roti, but I was served a plain roti which was half burnt and even we couldn't eat that. When we tried to speak to the manegar we were informed that they don't have any, and some casual dressed guy came to speak to us. We told them everything and he simply refused the accept all the same.

Now comes the most surprising part: it was a dry day,and we found that liquor was served into a table, and the big table was happily having those,when enquired,the waiter said that they brought it of their own, and hence having. How pity man? Hoe can u serve alcohol when the govt says it to be banned and dry. Rules must be same for everyone.

Now if the management is looking and listening, please pay attention to all these things,we drive all the way for 40kms not to have a pathetic service and standards of food as such,I couldn't add photos because my phone drained out. Give me one justified reason why we should visit you again when Kolkata itself have such nice dhabas and restaurants coming up with such fine foods and service?

It has been a place of our friend circle. we love this place a lot. Foods are soooo good. if you visit here and dont try the mix fried-rice then its your lose, that smoky flavor of the dish you wont get anywhere else, also try their mutton items, like kadai mutton, hundi mutton and mutton korma. If you expect delicacy with our drinks then you are in a wrong place, you will get the actual thing not delicacy.

It was a family outing after a long time. Decided to go for a dhaba feel rather than same old tried out restaurants. They have both non-AC and AC sections with a provision of outdoor seating. Watching flights take off while having food certainly adds an aura to this place. After researching a bit on Zomato itself, we got to know they cook awesome kebabs. So we started our venture with Mutton Seekh Kebab and Chicken Reshmi Kebab. To my surprise, they were far better than those posh restaurants at kolkata. Succulent and tender pieces just melted in our mouths. For the main course we ordered Masala Kulcha, Butter Naan, Kaali Dal, Tawa Chicken, Chicken Hyderabadi and Mutton Rhara. Tawa Chicken was in their 'Today's Special' list. All of the delicacies were one of the best I've ever tried. A real punjabi feel. The amount of spices in each dish was tailormade, even for the youngest member of our team. Amount of food was pretty good, and prices..... quite cheap (4000 AI with a moderate amount of liqour!!!). Hospitality was okay okay. Overall, a THUMBS UP!!

Yesterday I visited here after a gap of 6-7 years.
Lot of things have changed.
The sitting arrangement in the garden is no more, 2 AC Sections have been added
and most importantly the old atmosphere is missing.
¬†Ordered Chicken Tandoori, mutton seekh kabab, mutton handi and butter nun.
Serving was poor
Standard of serving is ordinary
Food has also become ordinary.
The old Sher-e -Punjab was lot better.

Located near the Airport on the roadside. So easy to locate !
Since I was in a hurry, I had to avail their take away facility. 
Liked the chicken preparation.
Kebabs were good too.

Overall, a nice place to gorge on ! :)

Located close to the airport, the ambience is simply wow!! Kababs, tandoori, naan, kulcha, biryani etc everything tastes so wonderful. If it comes to dhabas, this one surely will top the list. Been here twice, while going to and fro madhyamgram. Would love to visit the place again, in near future!

If you are a foodie and craving for dhaba food, this is the place to be. From appetizers to indian food to tandoor to chinese, all just taste yummy. Their Tandoori chicken & Afghani chicken are just superb. Their naans are one of the best available near and around Kolkata. They make sure that all their gravies don't taste the same, each has a unique taste. Despite being a dhaba primarily offering Indian & Tandoor, even their chinese dishes are very good. Also,  they have ample amount of space, courteous staff and on-time service available.

This Dhaba is located on jessore road on the opposite side of the airport. It is nearly impossible to miss while journeying. The food is mediocre compared to some other dhabas in Kolkata, but while traveling on NH 34 or 35, there are a very few other restaurants offeribg quality food. There is the AC section, non AC section, bar area, open area , a lot of space in fact ! 
Overall an average experience

Location - it is located at Jessor road left side joint towards madhayamgram.
Ambiance - great, can experience dhaba like environment, both open and close area is available.
Service - staff needs some training, they are well behaved no doubt but at the same time little bit slow while taking order and producing bill. So, for me service is not upto the mark.
Food - I am frequent visitor of this place and tasted almost everything. Some tasted heavenly and was upto the mark like tandoori items( chicken and Mutton) both. Mushroom, paneer, corn items was also great. Fish preparation was not upto the mark and I did not like that much.
Overall great dhaba experience, will go again.

Waiters are really cooperative. The outdoor seating arrangement is what I liked the most.Such an open and green place is great to soothe your mind. Best place to have beer. The alcohol prices here are pretty affordable. It's a Must visit.

One word review: Lajawab !!!
Went to this gem today for a friend's birthday treat. Went in to a spacious restaurant. It was almost full and we got a table in the family seating hall. Ordered Reshmi kebab for starter, tandoori rotis, butter nan, Mutton Amritsari , chicken rara, mixed raita, and lassi .
Reshmi kebab were succulent and perfectly cooked. The green chutney was perfect. Coming to the mains the rotis were amazing. Actual tandoori rotis .. The best I have had till now. Butter Nan were good but not much to talk about. Chicken Rara was fabulous with the right balance of spice. Finger licking good. Mutton Amritsari was comparatively milder to the taste... But the chicken and Mutton pieces were brilliantly cooked and the size of the pieces were amazing. The raita wasn't that good. Finished off with Lassi like a true Punjab üòÄ The total bill for four completely satiated souls was just 1386 INR .

it was a very cold and drowsy day when we visited the place, the ambiance was good and crowed we order for beers and tandoori chicken in stater which was very good but the only mistake I did was to order chicken lollipop ¬†which was actually not a chicken lollipop but a tandoori chicken lollipop very spicy also but somehow tasted good with lots of butter, then we have ordered for main course ¬†which was palak paneer and masala kulcha. the kulcha was very thik but filling was good and the palak paneer was tasting average. we end up our meal with gajar ka halwa which was the star of the show it was heavenly tasty .

This place has been the family get together spot since a long time. Earlier they used to have themed cabin at the back with a park but unfortunately now they have closed it. 
The service is always quick, you get your food within no time even in the rush hours. The waiters are courteous and as this is a dhaba you can't expect the well dressed waiters always ready to serve you. 
Coming to the food 
Afgani kebab - This dish was awesome. The chicken was soft and spicy with lots of flavour.
Chicken tikka kebab - As usual this dish is know to all. Spicy chicken pieces cooked in a tandoor. 
Chicken banjara - This dish really impressed me. Made with a onion based gravy with garlic and capcicum. The chicken were damn soft.
Butter naan - soft and warm. Tears like cotton and melts in your mouth. The smell of butter makes them more delicious.
Gajar ka halwa - Warm gajar ka halwa in winter season tastes like heaven. The taste was also good.
Screwdriver - never order a cocktail in a dhaba even if it is on the menu. They don't have good bartenders so the cocktail tasted very plain and with no taste at all. 
 Overall worth every penny you pay and will surely give you the experience you want. 
Best wishes 
Cheers !!

A very big joint with several seating options both outdoor and indoor. Very quickly food is served. Food is pretty average, nothing to specify particularly.
The butter naan is very soft and fluffy quite big is size.
Chicken tandoori was not good and over tandoored, burnt at most areas and lacks spice. Strangely they don't serve onion lemon and any kind of chutney with the tandoori. U have to separately order for salad.
Veg pulao is mainly peas pulao quantity is not sufficient for one person.
Chicken tikka masala was the only very tasty dish with 6 pieces of chicken tikka kababs.
Kadhai mutton is very low spicy bald tasting dish. Four pieces of mutton very soft though. But the gravy is not at all worth mentioning.
Anyway a good road side dhaba for going towards barasat side. Not very good tasting food like most north indian dhabas.

Ordered tandoori platter, karai chicken, chicken tandoor, which were the best i had till date. They have open air sitting, and closed ac sitting. Since, we chose the open air sitting, they didn't charged us any vat. Looking forward to visit them again. :)

Dal makhni lovers- your fav dal is only available on weekends here. The amritsari dal they give in stead is also yum. The kadhai paneer is tasty but very oily. Tava veggies are good and not oily. Also, kulcha is good, tandoori roti without butter is soft and beautifully light.

I went back to Sher e Punjab after may be 17..18 yrs. Back then it was a dhaba serving Punjabi food and drinks. That was cult of Michael nagar. What more could you ask then? Frequented by people who could enjoy a piece of open air dining. 

Over the years it has become bigger. Now to answer to a nostalgia went there for a visit. Food accordingly to me has gone through a change over the years to suit a bigger crowd palette.

We order a panner tikka and fish tandoori. The panner tikka was soft. The spice of the rub could have been been better. The cook of the betki skillets was on the money. The marinade was again toned down.  We ordered the makki ki roti and sarson ka saag. It was really true to the original of the food and it was fabulous! 

It was followed with dal makhani, panner bhurji and chicken do pyaza accompanied with roti and vegetable palav. 

Dal makhani was a let down. It lacked the creaminess and the flavour profile.

Panner Bhurji was OK. Not much you can go wrong with.

Chicken do Pyaza...the chicken was cooked well but the gravy lacked the richness of the gravy. It was a little watery.

Over all after a visit after so many years I think they are now trying to cater to a larger audience. As the food that I used to eat was more Punjabi than it is today.

This is one of my favourite hangout in Kolkata especially when I feel like having a booze party with my friends/colleagues. The most interesting fact about this place is that except in monsoon, you may choose to sit with your friends outside in the lawn under the sky and enjoy a can of beer or two along with the wonderful food that they prepare. Another interesting fact is that you'll get both bud & heineken here (which is too unlikely in various bars & in various parts of kolkataüòâ) & that too at a much reasonable rate.
Although it has been pretty long since the last time I came to visit this food joint, I still remember the lip-smacking tandoori chicken and the mouthwatering Chilli Lamb I had here with my brother and my better half. In fact I have always liked most of the food items that I had here. 
Also for those who are well acquainted with the Kolaghat Sher E Punjab, I must say that the food prepared here is equally tasty & toothsome like their Kolaghat counterpart. However, the prices here are comparatively higher & the quantity is also a bit lesser than their other counterpart in Kolaghat. 
Having said enough about the food, its time to review about the service now. Every time I came here I felt the waiters are a bit sluggish and ignorant while taking and delivering orders. So a minus 0.5 rating points for that. Otherwise would have rated as 4.5. Would love to visit again & again.

It has been a decade now that I was introduced to this lovely place. I really miss their garden setting type restaurant which is now closed. This dhaba has a great range of north Indian foods and the taste keeps me overwhelmed everytime. Drinks are reasonably priced. Their setting and location is very attracting as watching the aeroplanes land and fly in the open sky while enjoying the dinner near the NH34 makes one blissfull.

Visited this place on Christmas 2015. It was a mad rush given the holiday it was. Waited for 30mins before we could hijack a table for 8 of us! This was the first visit to this outlet. Ordered Tandoori and Chilly Fish as starters which were pretty good. The service was damn quick even in that busy hours. The ambience was decent with the flight  takeoffs just up in the sky. The kulcha was a bit let down but the sarson da saak and makki Di roti was quite good in taste. The outlet offers limited hard drink options atleast in terms of beer. The food quality was up to the mark. The price was reasonable and the service was pretty good. Would like to visit it again and write one more review. And this time want to visit in the morning because I am an avid plane spotter !

I have been going to this place from my childhood. Ended up here after i think a decade because my flight was late. While this place is now quite a lot bigger than before, it now feels a lot more rundown than before.

Being a Punjabi dhaba, i would expect it to serve some of the dishes one associates with a dhaba like Sarson ka saag and baingan ka bharta.. None of them were available. The waiters seem to be doing some sort of government job and were least bothered.

Now for the good part, their Afghani and tandoori chicken are one of the best in town. Ordered both and they were lovely. Most of what i have had were good if not great. Alcohol is decently priced too.

Overall, if they can improve the decor/cleanliness and get their staff to learn some etiquettes, this could easily regain its former glory. Oh and have a stocked menu and not one where parts of it are not available.

Would have given a 1.5 if it were not for the great food they served among what was available.

At the end of the airport ,toward madhyamgram ,left side adjacent to jessore road. Typically dhaba ambience. Open and close places both available. Ideal place for friends Hangout, hard drinks, and kebab.I think kebab quality is not so good.amount adequate. Not every items are available as per menu sply in case of cocktail, or other item.also good place for family Hangout. Attitude is not so professional, credit or debit card problem may arise as I hv experienced last night ,but one axis bank ATM very adjacent to d dhaba.enough parking place in front of d dhaba.

I stuck to kochuri - but then minus the aloo gravy subzi. Was too happy and helpful with the daal tadka - looked almost like kaali dal makhani types but trust me Tooo Good!! Add on lemons and green chilly - breakfast be soooo Good!

I have been here earlier, couple of years back, but this time really disappointed. only thing increased is the price, apart from that the quality, quantity and most of all the service have been degraded tragically. Being the only posh restaurants around, the management has taken customers for granted and stewards don't care, even to ask whether we want drinking water or not. I am not going to details of taste, its as bad as the restaurant turns out to be.

Sher-e-Punjab is what I would call a "used-to-be" dhaaba. It's far from the city on the Jessore Road. After a very long ride and rumbling tummies we got there. We were greeted by a very friendly parking guy. The place is very big, no show-shaa. I wasn't expecting much to tell you the truth.

We were pretty famished so we ordered sheekh kababs, chicken lollypop, reshmi kabab and fish tikka for starters with fresh lime soda. For mains we had chicken bharta and chicken tikka masala with garlic naan. This is where things get awesome! Loved all the starters but the chicken lollypop was the star! The chutney that was served was fresh and flavorful. The mains were really good too. But am not too impressed with the chicken tikka masala. The bharta was really tasty. The naan was just perfect. It was not that pungent garlicky sorta bread. It was light and fluffy and not chewy :)

Coming to service, the hosts were very quick and alert. We didn't have to wait long for our second round of naan. They weren't standing on our heads either. I didn't really expect this type of service and was pleasantly surprised. I guess we should have taken the cue from the parking guy :)

All in all it was a great experience. Yummy food and I can't wait to go again.

We were panch(5) at Panchami night here in sher-e-punjqb dhaba. It's at michael nagar, near to Madhyamgram.
Big plus point of this restaurant is it's space. It has arround 5 section for seating, among those 2 are AC. Stag entry is not allowed in AC dining :-). So make sure you have lady in your group to avail AC dining.
Now coming to food, Chicken tandoori is a must have thing here. We ordered dry chili chicken which was really nice too. Safe option is going for indian dishes which are really good in taste!
Price is pretty reasonable for alcohol. Food price seems a little bit pricy on menu card, BUT this price contains 14.5% VAT. So at the end price wise it's quite normal.

It's been years since I had been to Shere punjab so was a Lil confused but it's easy to b there with d gang I boarded. Chilled beer with chicken reshmi n tikka kebabs.... Awesome it was. Tiredness - it all went away. Main course was tandoori roti n kolhapuri chicken n chicken bharta. Fabulous experience again.
N lastly D sound of d flights which were taking off pushed me to d world of nostalgia. Again would visit as I once more will come to cherish d memories.

Visited here last night... Meal started well enough with a Half Tandoori Chicken..nice smoky flavor.. Butter naan and Kolhapuri Chicken were an entirely different story..Extremely hard naans which were impossible to tear...and there was nothing kolhapuri about the chicken..extremely bland with none of the heat that one associates with this dish..just pieces of chicken, diced onions,capsicum and tomatoes in a tomato based  gravy....very disappointed.

Little bit of disappointed with this restro.. ordered tengri kabab , egg rice , sweat and sour chicken fr myself. Totally disappointed with tengri kabab because chicken was not fairly cooked.. red blood was there in my kabab. I complained to the waiter bt he dumbo was standing facing towards the floor and was feeling sorry.. whts the use of that??? I am paying full amount for the food thn why not getting in return?? Frst and last visit over there. Wanna give zero rating.. will not suggest..

My experience was so pathetic with them, but we heard a lot about it..I had food from the kolaghat midnapur outlet which was awesome...garam gulab jamun, ice cream, kashmiri polao, sahi paneer was really yummm.but with this outlet had worst experience..first it was a rainy day and we had to leave for the station to take train...we ordered egg chowmin...and ordered lassi and cold drinks...they took a lot of time...after payment they said that they did mistake bcz that was mixed chow..again we had to wait..and ambience was not good, and added one that one person came to give flowers to the photos of GOD stood on our table where we sat...we left taht table and asking continuously to give our parcel....and the chowmin was worst I have ever had...

This place is located in Barasat Road near Madhyamgram. It is a little far but the travelling is worth it. 

The starters here were good. Paneer Tikka was superb, Baby corn were average, Chicken Reshmi Kabab was good as per my non veg eating friends. 

In the main course, daal makhaani and malaise kofta were amazing. Kadai paneer was not upto the mark. Kadai paneer could have been a lot better. 

Masala Kulcha here was the best I ever had. But it is too heavy. If you eat one whole Kulcha you wouldn't be able to enjoy anything else. 

Non veg food was also very nice as suggested by my friends. 

Schezwan Veg Fried Rice was the best ever rice which I had. You will enjoy each and every bite of it. 

Overall a very nice place. This place isn't too classy nor too cheap. 

A Rs.500 per person is expected to bill at this place.

Earlier this was just a space besides a petrol pump where you were served the choicest Chicken Curry and Tandoori Chicken on hastily laid tables and plastic chairs sometimes just besides the trucks themselves.It was popular by the name of Barasat Dhaba.It had a rustic charm and yes,they did not demand corkage on the bottle of alcohol you carried.Life was simpler then....

Now it's a swank,elaborate eatery and by no means of imagination does the remnants of the old Dhaba remain.But yes the Tandoori chicken is still kickass and we stick to our staple of chicken curry or chicken butter masala and there's no cause for disappointment.

A previously excellent restaurant turned into an ill maintained dhaba with bad tasting food. Having said so, the kebabs are still awesome and the prices are low. Yet there are a lot of places to have good kebabs, and if you want to have a long drive, there are dhabas elsewhere. Driving on Jessore Road is a nightmare anyways and this is not too far from the city.

The waiters won't hesitate to ask you for more tips by the way :-)

Some friends and I have been going to this place since it was just a small room, a couple of "khatias" outside and a table. This used to be the go to highway dhaba for the truck drivers to get their beer and chicken fix. As one of the best small roadside dhabas in the city, it drew crowds from near and far with it's kababs, tandooris, anda tadka, rumali / naan / tandoori roti, etc...and the promise of a chiiled beer with all that. It was great. But that was about 25 years ago. Now its entirely unrecognisable! Its a large place with a backyard garden with tasteful decorations and a three star menu that routinely caters to the large companies. The food is still very good. Just a lot more on offer and a fair bit dearer. But a place I would definitely recommend.

A nice pocket friendly place to eat out of the main city. Both open air as well as air conditioned dining spaces available. Yummy food and swift service. Tandoori chicken a must try. The open air gives the feeling of a dhaba. The ambience was little dull. Those planning to go should carry cash with them as there's no facility of card payments(there's an ATM outside the restaurant)

Very near to the Dum dum Airport and Michaelnagar post office, Sher-e-Punjab is one-stop for food lovers who are in that area.. i have been there once before. Went there again on last Sunday after a long drive.. It was around 11.30 pm when me n my friends took a table in the open air section of the restaurant.. The ambience is perfect for catching up with friends over a few drinks and starters. We ordered our beers, bacardi rum with orange juice, antiquity blue and fresh lime sodas along with few starters, like crispy chilly babycorn, chicken tandoori and chicken lollypop. Babycorn wasn't upto the mark, as it was overfried and black in colour..tastewise too it wasnt good. Tandoori was however, very nice n well grilled. Chicken Lollypop which they serve are different from.the ones we usually eat at other restaurants. It was dry n tasted like a spicier version of chicken tandoori.. When asked about it, the waiter politely told us thats how its made.. :/ Well, slightly dissapointed there. But we enjoyed our drinks n starters nevertheless. Next for the main course we ordered Tandoori rotis alongwith Tandoori Aloo Dum, a Chicken and a Mutton preparation as suggested by the waiter himself. They were all well cooked and tasted good..so no complaints there. It was pretty late and they were about to.close down so we didnt go for any desserts. Overall the experience was good. Parking space isn't a problem too. So would visit again soon.

Situated right in front of runway, this place might seem gloomy and uninteresting from outside, but this provides a perfect eg.of a road side dhaba in kolkata which is very difficult to find here. Starting with kadai chicken and butter chickn,it has a perfect mixture of spices required. The most positive point about this place is the quantity. Enuf for 3 in a dish. It also has a tasty range of dal makhni,paneer lababdar. If there exists a litle place after all these,should definitely try meethi lassi...

The place has a huge seating capacity and is located just along Jessore Road. This makes it very hard to miss. There is hardly anything to say about the decor. The service is prompt usually,but could take longer on days with greater footfall. They serve both Chinese and North Indian dishes. The kebabs taste overcooked and a bit too spicy. The gravy served with dishes like Chicken Kasha or Chicken Kolhapuri taste almost identical. They serve rotis and naans straight from the oven,though. Overall,it is an okay-wala place to have North Indian cuisine. But it possibly wouldn't be a good choice to order Chinese here.

A very average rated restaurant. Other than kababs i don't find any food really interesting. They somehow changed the food experience by changing their base test. I ordered masala  mushroom in which i found a few tiny pieces of mushroom like things, the chicken reshmi kabab was so sweet in test. I would give 2 for that horrible experience.

But I remembered that food was tasty, service was good and price is very much affordable. I liked the place.

Butter naan is the only thing that attracts me to this place. They serve one of the most fluffy, soft and perfectly baked naan. I had always been a naan lover and this place had put a pull stop on my hunt for perfect naan but then you would be disappointed by the taste of sabzi sometimes. They never maintain a constant standard for taste and quantity.

Shere Punjab is a North Indian restaurant cum bar located off the Kolkata airport runway on Barasat road. Lot of seating space with option of both sitting out in the open or in an air conditioned dining area. Ambience is just like a road side dhaba - ordinary and very noisy. View of planes landing and taking off can be breathtaking for few people. Full points to their food and service. I have been to this place few times and have been really impressed by their breads, dal and kebabs. Other veggie curries like paneer butter masala, mixed veg and aloo jeera were equally good. Breads are always served warm and crispy. Service is very quick and lots people to make sure you don't have to wait too long. Portions are good but a little less compared to other restaurants of the same category. Prices are very reasonable.

All points go to the food! The ambience is homely but a bit too noisy. The place could do with a facelift! But if food is what you want, and that too good food, this is the place you should go to! One of the nest north indian dhabas i have ever been to!

Well.. This place is replete with so many memories since my childhood. It used to be the BEST and might I add,only joint, for a quick bite and also a fulfilling lunch /dinner in this side of the jessore road area,past the airport. As I said, it used to be the best, it doesn't have that friendly ambience nor the prompt service anymore. Moreover the truck drivers and the late night bawdy crowd make it worse. Still the favourites like mutton sheek kebabs, tandoor items,nun etc have that old charm. I sincerely pray for the old sher-e-punjab. Alas, it won't come true.

A little far from the bustling town - tucked close to the airport - but worth a visit to experience the dhaba style open kitchen cooking atmosphere and savour the delicious North Indian food.

Try the tandoor items - chicken tandoori with mint chutney, fish fingers, curries and naan.

One the best places that serves Punjabi Cuisine. The Butter Chicken is prolific and is a must taste. The paneer items are good too and one has to love the tandoori chicken that you get here. Ambience is quite different as you have open seating. There is a separate section for families that is airconditioned too. One thing they can improve on is the service. Truly that sucks. Otherwise its bang for the buck.

Located near airport, Sher-e-Punjab is quite nice in terms of food quality and space. The place is huge and the service is prompt. Like all the other outlets, the prices are same and reasonable. From outside, one can't determine the size of this place but once inside, you'll see it's nicely setup. They serve drinks all tye time and the jitchen is visible to all so you can see what and hiw they are preparing. This is one of the best places for grabbing late night dinner. Overall, a nice place with good ambiance and great food at reasonable prices.

The place is not very hygienic and the food served are just ordinary quality when compared with restaurants in and around the place. 
If you are realy punjabi food fan like I am then am sorry to say you will be more than disappointed after a dinner date with this place. 
With age this place has gone from best to worst...!

On my recent visit,this place remained actually the same,with even tastier food..
Among the starters we ordered were fish fingers wih tartar sauce,chicken lollipop and tandoori chicken..from the main course were chicken bharta,butter nan,mixed fried rice,egg noodles and chilli chicken..
All the dishes were delicious to the power infinity..
A must try for everyone if looking for best north indian food..:) happy eating..

Sher-e-Punjab is one of the best dhaba in jessore road area.It is 20 minutes far away from my house.Sher-e-Punjab is located at Sukanta Nagar near Micheal Nagar post office,Jessore road.They have large seating arrangements.Some are indoor systems & others are outdoor systems.I've tasted here Tandoori Chicken as a starter.This is mouth watering.Then we ordered Chicken Bharta,Tandoori Rooti,Butter Nan,Masala Kulcha etc.Chicken Bharta was outstanding.Price is also reasonable.Service was little late.

Tell me a better place that offers open air seating place combined with good food & drinks ? so far none except this one ( if you have any please share,would surly visit). This joint is quite a spread in itself , the entrance has large number of chair table along side the bar. You cross it and then you come to the open air place under the sky,followed by the A.C part of the Restaurant. I suppose combined all it can easily accommodate more then 180-200 people at a time , yet on weekends evening you are left searching for a seat. The food is good,service over the weekends a bit slow but otherwise fast.They always serve you hot food from the oven.The tandoori chicken combined with drinks is best,if you are veg then opt for crispy chilly baby-corn.Opt for any tandoori item they make it good.The food is reasonably priced.The best part what i liked was the ambiance sitting right under the sky ,feeling the chill with good company of friends around you.Cheer to that!

An old joint frequently visited by people who stay this side of town when they are out for long drives. Spread over a huge area this is one of the oldest dhaba in town. At the entrance there is seating area which has this typical dhaba feel. You get everything from tandoori to sarson da saag to biryani.  Alcohol is also served here. The inside area has an air conditioned chamber where food and alcohol is served as well.  The prices have shot up over the last few years. The food quality remains the same though.  A nice place to hang around and eat after a long drive with friends and family

Open air dining is the best part of this ecstatic restaurant. Opting for drinks will also be a good choice once you are sitting out. The ambience inside is good. But it's crowded most of the days, considering its good reputation and quality serves. Grilled chicken is a special attraction and roti/tandoori should be preferable. Price is too reasonable and can be considered as a place for complete gala time, both with family and friends.

I never thought of writting about this one. Last year this restaurant completed 25 years. I am coming this restaurant for more than 20 years and this place is in walkable distance from my home and hence I cant count how many times I have been there. May be more than 300 times and I have seen the restaurant starting from a proper roadside dhaba changing to a popular well known multi cuisine restaurant.

I always loved the ambience as sitting with food one can enjoy refreshing air through the big windows and a fabulous view if the airport runway which is just beside the jessore road. There is no single menu I have not tried in their menu card but my all time favourite is tandoori chicken which I believe no place in Kolkata prepares better than this. Apart from that any tandoori or kebab item you can pick and I am sure you will not be disappointed. Mocktails or soups or sizzlers will not be available all the time and they wont be worthy to try. Tandoori roti which once I used to have Rs 2.50 per piece is now Rs 17 per piece and from there you can understand the upgradation of the cost. Chinese foods will be also good but don't expect the authentic taste. They will charge you a service charge of 4.5% on the total bill else all the food rates are inclusive of 14.5% vat.

I could have definitely recommend this restaurant without any hesitation coz cost wise and taste wise this will be undoubtedly one of the best leading restaurants. But last a couple years they have introduced the bar which is not segregated and hence who don't like drinking might feel a little shaky while you step in and moreover due to the same bar, you also might hesitate going with family as you never know if some drinkers will be sitting and drink and spoil the environment and ambience. And the most importantly due to the same bar the overall service and quality has been degraded a lot. And if you want to try this please avoid the festive times.

Sher-e-Punjab reminds me of my school days. This one's a pocket friendly place. One of the reasons i keep visiting this place is because of their chicken tandoori. You'll get quality food at reasonable price.
The bar here is also comparatively cheap.

The warmth of this place is nowhere to be found...
But leaving the nostalgia behind the standard of the place has fallen to a great extent...
From reluctant waiters not ready to act to food that is not served with care.
Ordering a simple tandoori chicken becomes a headache when you got to ask for onions pickles and even salt to accompany it.
The cuisines available here apart from north indian are not upto their standard.
As i feel sorry about the fact that we go to this place very less often now as the food and the ambience has worsened.

Although saw some couples there. Nice tandoori cuisine, good branded beers, separate smoking place. It's quite nice. You should try reshmi kebab there, it was yum. Although i'd suggest a better seating arrangement and the location is not that great. Other than that, nice place to hangout with friends. A positive 3 points from me.

I have been to this place last week to celebrate my birthday as suggested by my brother and uncle. Looked like kinda roadside dhaba to me. First impression was not that great but as we entered inside the joint, the place seems to be more than a Dhaba. Joint was experiencing mammoth crowd because of the Dussehra festival. Never mind, we waited for 2 mins or so and got a table for 8 of us. 6 adults and 2 kids.¬†

We sat for couple of minutes and got the menu to look at. We skimmed through the menu and ordered few items from the few. I never found the menu good enough to choose from. Might be they've customized for Dussehra celebration considering the foot fall.

Coming to the order, we have ordered for Reshmi Kebab and Tandoori chicken from starters, Chicken Biryani, Murgh Makhani, Chicken Bharta and Tandoori roti from the main course. We ordered in no time looking at the perennial crowd outside.¬†

Reshmi kebab was average, it could have been better - they would have marinated it little more. Blend and aroma was missing. Tandoori chicken was good but the quantity was not sufficient. We ordered for two full tandoori chicken but looks one and half to me.¬†

Murgh Makhani was something I enjoyed to the core and I will praise it more than once. On the other side, Chicken bharta disappointed me - Pretty ordinary taste.¬†

Tandoori roti was not properly prepared and in some I felt the rotis got burnt - extreme on both the side! That might be because of the rush they want to entertain...But from me - No Mercy - Please do NOT entertain that much crowd if you're unable to provide quality food. People are paying their hard earned money only to have good food time.¬†

Ambiance was average outside and more than average in AC section. Service is OK to me and billing process was truly slow - we've waited for more than 10 mins to get the bill.¬†

Overall, my tryst with Sher E Punjab is average. I am not sure if I will recommend this place. But, again, you can give it a try on a regular day and share your feedback. I would love to read your take!

Went there for dinner.. Ordered Veg foods. However, they are not like dhabas and especially punjabi dhaba. Ok to taste.. Snacks, however, were delicious.. Environment is ok-ok.. Sitting outside (in verandah) is good only if mosquito doesnt take off your entire attention.. Rest the place is ok to visit..

If you want to waste money on a highly over hyped cheap unhygenic place to eat... Please eat here. I admit during the Durga Puja, good food is an extinct species. So when the kebabs came half burnt, I did  not  complain. Then we asked for the chicken biryani which, the waiter informed us after a long  wait, was not available. Mutton biryani it is, we thought(thankfully available. We wish it was not). When the biryani came, this picture shows you the quantity of the food. That too, there are large chunks of potato in there. And the big football sized potato was so raw, we had to throw it. You charge 170 bucks for half a plate of staleish biryani? We ordered a chicken side dish out of necessity and a few rotis since we finished the biryani in 4spoons. Bad experience all together. Every single dish we tried was average to low standard. Definitely did not expect this from here.

Been to this place for like almost around 10 times and except for the first visit all the other ones were forced. Although the food served here is pretty good and the price is also quite fair but the main concern for me when I visit a place to eat is the ambiance and hygiene and this place failed me on both. The plates were not cleaned properly had stains. Had glimpses of the kitchen few times during my visit and you wont want to eat there if you saw the condition of the kitchen. For me given a choice I will never go there on my own as there are a lot of places serving the same quality of food and at the same price but with better ambiance and hygiene.

my childhood favourite punjabi dhaba/restaurant...¬†
starting off with the location well situated in the surburban part of airport with airplanes landingand taking off that can be seen through the window makes it a hell of an experience of cherishing a brilliant meal over there...
ambience well perfect combination of true punjabi dhaba with the management staff being punjabis always give heart whelming welcome whilst entering the sher -e-punjab

starting of with food well almost every indian cuisine tried there that including: tandoori chicken which is one my favourite everytime i visit here and not to mention they give personalised kabab platter with kababs of your choice which is just heavenly and undescribeable unless you indulge in it like a real foodie !!!

the gravy items like that of hyderabadi chicken chettinad,chicken bharta,chicken do pyaza.reshmi butter masala chicken /mutton dahiwala are the one to ¬†watch out for!! ¬†
roti/rice section i loved their kulchas everytime it was ordered ¬†also try out ¬†their keema nan for change in taste and if you are ¬†rice person jeera rice is apt for you with any gravies you decide to take..

the food is quite good there on my opinion¬†
the ambience adds some bits to it as the landing/take-off of airplanes from the airport can be seen with having a family lunch there and cozy atmosphere and clean fresh air during the summer time makes it great experience of food and some great family adda¬†
¬†the family bar inside the lawn of the dhaba a glass covered air conditioned sitting space inside of the the lawn is now a new addition to it but i prefered te open aired sitting arrangement than this one

Last Sunday we decided to have dinner at a place which offers great food at pocket-friendly price. So my wife and I decided for this place. Known for its great delicacies, we had high expectations. We decided to sit in the air conditioned restaurant ad it was continuously raining. A Sunday evening meant almost full capacity
 When we asked for available seats, the waiter asked to find on our own. We were lucky to locate one vacant table immediately. Thei menu card shown here is different from the actual menu card available in the restaurant. We ordered for chicken Afghani kabab. The plating was just ok. The food tasted good but served cold. For the main course we ordered dal makhni, murgh makhni and tandoori rotis. Dal was as bland as it could be. The chicken was undercooked. Rotis were burnt. A complete let down for these simple dishes.

Coming to the infrastructure, their washroom was in terrible state and entering it one experiences nightmare. We had to wait for 10,mins to get the bill. The only thing positive is the coat is slightly less. A horrible experience in a restaurant which once featured in the top restaurants in India.

As it was past midnight and getting late, I ordered simple menu ‚ÄòSteam Rice‚Äô, ‚ÄòFish Butter Masala‚Äô, ‚ÄòKadai Chichen‚Äô, ‚ÄòDahi Mutton‚Äô and ‚ÄòGreen Salad‚Äô. Each item was outstanding and delicious especially Fish Butter Masala & Dahi Mutton. Honestly it‚Äôs an ideal place for midnight meals if you are close to airport ‚Äì madhyamgram area.

Ordered a chicken tandoori, few beers, chicken Afghani, paneer butter masala and naan. 
All the food was very very tasty. And well cooked.
Overall a place worth visiting. Very much!

A suggestion : please make a place for "khaatiyas" in original Punjabi style.

After a long time, I had a very satisfying dinner. The drink is cheap. Food price is on a lower side. Pure value for money. We ordered;-

1. Chicken Tandoori- A pure WOW scoring 5/5. Its too good.

2. Murg Makhni- It had an exemplary tangy taste. I simply loved it like anything. 5/5.

3. Egg Tarka- Since it is a Dhaba, we ordered Egg dropped Tarka. It was also fine. Score- 4/5.

4. Tandoori Roti- It spoilt the entire food. Burnt pieces of bread as tight as a biscuit. Score- 1/5.

5. Lassi- Again another delight. Simply awesome. Score-5/5.

6. Value for money, as stated above is 5/5.

We were 4 of us, who had a full dinner with a 1 whisky, 1 cocktail n 2 freshlime sodas. Total bill- Rs 1100/-.

Our overall score goes 4.5/5. Its worth driving down from Lake Town to Jessore Road, Micheal Nagar for a satisfying dinner. Kudos to team Sher e Punjab.

On my way to puri (Orissa), I was extremely hungry , n was searching for a place to eat, when suddenly dis place came into view.Situated on NH6, this place is perfect to eat after a tiresome long drive.Its a "not so dhaba type" restaurant .. its divided into ac/non ac/ outside sitting areas ... The majority of the people who stop here are people going for¬†a long drive or returning from it .. We ordered 2 alu paranthas , 2 tandoori roti n 1 butter chicken .. I just had 1 parantha n was completely full for d day ... LOLIt was yummy .. n tasted like an aunthentic Punjabi parantha ..¬† according to my parents the tandoori roti n chicken were also delicious ... n also its a pocket friendly place ..If u r health conscious u may not like d dishes .. but 1c in a while u can definitely give it a try .. Vl definitely visit again :D

I have been in a long-term relationship with this place. Like really long! I remember during school days, 2-3 of our families compulsively had dinner at this place on Holi and Christmas every year. And now, surprisingly I have shifted quite close to this place, so it's like my ultimate end-of-a-night-out place or the perfect place to chill out with a friend. The staff is awesome and very very friendly to everyone. Weekends or holidays, it's a little tough finding a good place to sit and eat though it has huge accomodation facilities which is divided into three sections broadly-the A.C./NON A.C. sections and the outdoor section. You can see the food being cooked on one end if you opt to sit outside. The hustle-bustle actually gives you a great kick if you're bored of the sophisticated prim and proper high-end restaurants. Ask the waiters about the food you want to order, they'll happily give you suggestions or if very very busy, will come back to you after a while. The North Indian fare is really good! The way it should be: lip smacking and finger-licking good. I am not mentioning the stuff you should go have there because it's just not possible for me to mention all that I love! It's a place where you chill with family, with friends, with just about anybody. Even the chowkidaar bhaiya at the parking lot is friendly and wouldn't mind clicking a few photographs for you (umm yes i do that when I am with my buds). Go Sher-e-Punjab! Yay!
p.s. It's very pocket-friendly too. I love that part as well.

This is pretty near to my home so have been there many times....good for kebabs with drinks..ambience is ok...service is ok...not very good...
Place is pretty good for starters...be prepared to see huge rush and u need to wait a lot...
Additionally sometimes the place becomes full of drunkards so that's really bad. If you come with your family...best place is the air conditioned restaurants or the open air one.. bad thing is on a rush day... you will see someone standing at your back waiting for you to leave your seat... management should take care of this. This actually is very idiotic in nature.. else it is pretty good....

I guess more or less every Calcuttan has visited this outlet of Sher-e-Punjab over a long drive. My two recent visits have particularly been at dawn, at around 5:30 am and 7 am in the morning, respectively. We ended up here ravenous, tired, in dire need of food and washrooms. 
We ordered alu parathas, egg bhujji and tea to cool and calm ourselves down. They generally are pretty quick servers if not flooded with crowd. We had been lucky the first time but had to wait quite a bit on the second visit. But really, you exactly don't complain about a minimal waiting period when you know there will be hot, tasty food coming your way at that hour of the day. 
I love their alu parathas - thick and filled to the brim, sumptuous, crispy yet soft and served with a very tasty alu curry. Finishing one generally gets a little difficult for me given the size and thickness. The egg bhujia is definitely god sent. Someone who does not like eggs is bound to trip over the bhujia they make here, I bet. It tastes so perfect with a blend of spices, onion fries and chillies that my heart craves spoonfuls every time. The tea is served absolutely hot and made with thick milk. I am not sure if I would love it at any hour of the day but for the dawn. It makes sure you start (or end your day :p) on a good note. :)

I have been there plenty of time over the last few years . But on my last visit only a couple of days ago with a few of my friends we found a fly in the kebab chutney. No replacement of the dish and we had to pay for it too. The north Indian food is still okay but the standards have gone down a lot since the last tine I visited.

Shere Punjab (kolaghat)

yo yo...chak de phatte nap de killi.....that's the feeling you will get after having food at this place......

if great North Indian food is what you are looking for along with a pleasant drive...then jump in your car, tighten ur seat belts and play ur fav music to land up at this delicious yummy place

This place is around 70-75 Kms from Kolkata...we actually have been very late to discovered this place as we are not keen on going to Dhabas after our horrendous experiences at the various HYPED Dhabas in kolkata....viz Azad Hind, Jai Hind, Punjabi Dhaba, Balwant Singh, Uluberia Dhaba etc...which have exaggerated prices, poor food quality and rate low on overall experience...
Hence, we have always been skeptical as far as having North Indian food at these places were concerned...

However, Shere Punjab (kolaghat) proved to be an abberation.......we stopped here enroute to our visit to Mandarmoni...we thought of giving this place a try...the final one for the dhabas....and guess what...we are keen on pumping up the gas and going to this place the next weekend....

This place is located on the highway...it has four areas where you can have food.....the first place is where you can drink along with your food...second is having food on the Charpais laid outside right under the sky...third one is a covered area...fourth being the air conditioned one where they do not serve liquor...if you are interested in having liquor, then this place has all the options for you along with a pan shop with all that smoke to vent it out,,,,,,......

We were four people and sat in the air conditioned area,,,,so no liquor.... ;-)

Food Quality and Taste and VFM:

We ordered for green salad,  sweet lassis, chaach, shahi paneer, dal makhani, alu do piyaza and butter rotis....
The green salad was absolutely fresh and the veggies were of superb quality...we enjoyed it so much,,,that we actually ended up having three plates of green salad....@ Rs 40 each
Shahi paneer was simply delicious and ended us licking the entire dish,,,truly shahi @ Rs 115
Dal makhani had the perfect taste with makhan malai served on top of it...@ Rs 75
Aloo do piyaza had the right balance of spice and tasted well....@ Rs 115
Butter rotis were served hot and were soft @ Rs 13 each
Lassi and chaach were ok to taste,,,,and definitely not out of the world....

Overall cost for 4 worked out to around Rs 800/-

Ambience and Service time

Ambience is not what you ideally look for when to go to Dhabas....and definitely not what you look for when food is great...the staff is very courteous and the service is prompt and quite quick....for ex. We ordered for extra rotis and they were served hot in less than a few minutes.

Overall the experience was wonderful and would keep you smacking your lips and enticing your taste buds...

Would highly recommend this place...

Both the Sher-e-Punjab (Dhaba) outlets (Jessore Road, Kolaghat) have been reviewed here:

1. Location: Jessore Road.

This place gives you more like a Dhaba cum restaurant feel.
The place is divided into several sections.
Visited this place in a group of four and opted for the outdoor (open) seating.

Coming to the point,
This place serves good quality as well as great quantity of food.

Tandoori Roti
Was crisp and perfectly baked.

Dal Makhani
Was good to taste, served with a dollop of butter instead of cream.

Tawa Sabzi
Hero of the day.
Was really great to taste, it's more like stir fried veggies but with an Indian touch to it.

Masala Kulcha
Great filling.

All dishes were served together, but were hot.

Staff was semi-efficient, expected to be on toes considering this place to be a Dhaba.

Prices are pocket-friendly.¬†

Overall Good experience.

______________________________________________________________

2. Location: Kolaghat, NH6.

This place has been close to my heart and is one place which I keep visiting on n' off.
May it be while on long drives, Durga Puja, outskirt visits and the list goes on.
Have visited this place 'n' number of times.

And this place has never disappointed me.
May it be with the quality or quantity of food or service.
Small glitches keep taking place, that's what I can say coz the glitches aren't permanent whatsoever, they are looked upon by the management and corrected on notice.

Coming to the food,

Paneer Butter Masala
The cottage cheese cubes are tender and melt in the mouth, gravy is great.

Dal Makhani
A good compliment to the breads, have had better tastings.

Malai Kofta
Great to taste, the filling of the koftas is delicious.

Butter Naan
Soft and buttery. (y)
As expected.

Masala Kulcha
Is at times good and at times great.
Overall doesn't disappoint you to a great extent.

Garlic Naan
The garlic is in perfect balance.
The bread is soft and served brushed with little butter.

All dishes were hot when served.¬†

Staff is well-informed about their menu, and is efficient. On the toes.

Prices are pocket friendly.

Overall a great experience. :-)

Have been a visitor to this since I was a five year old. The name itself was enough in those days. Cut to twenty years later, I feel the same old charm missing. Feels like overpriced, when having a look at what is served. The point is, you can get better food at a better place, with better ambience and environment, at somewhat better price. Then it makes no sense going here. We surely visit here, but just for old times sake.

This used to be a favourite for me. Loved going there, more so in the times when roads were not so crowded, or at least construction had not blocked much of it. I recall they even had some rudimentary Thai cuisine at one time. Not sure if they still do that.

The fact that I never did like the table layout did put me off a bit, but the food served made up for it. I quite adored the mixed kabab platter. The mutton seekh kabab in particular was awesome. The tandoori chicken was well done too. I do not much remember how the gravy items were. Very edible I'm sure with nice rotis on offer.

It is set just the right distance from the highway. Far enough for it not to be noisy and a constant disturbance, and close enough for it to not be distant :)

I have not been ever since I found a fly in the kabab platter. It kind of put us off for a while. These days. we hardly go much that side of town. Must make a trip there soon :)

This place has definitely the feel of a typical punjabi food joint.
We ordered tandoori chicken which was good but not great.
The chicken tikka masala on the other hand was nice.
The staff service was not up to the mark.
A great restaurant to stop by if you are out on a roadtrip
Else...

Nice restaurant no doubt of course the make some awesome food specially tandoori dishes for sure. I'm going to this restaurant for a very long time. All I can say that they surely  deserve at least 4, but I'm giving 3.5 for they removed some dishes from the menu and the lamb wasn't so good but overall its a very good restaurant.

Being a keen enthusiast of North Indian food, I can assure you that Sher-e-Punjab is one of the best (well, at least for vegetarian food). The portions are quite sufficient and in all, this restaurant is economical. The Panir Butter Masala I ordered contained extremely fresh Panir and the Dal Makhani was also fantastic. The place will be crowded most of the time, especially so on weekends, but you can still expect reasonable service. Sher-e-Punjab is worth it.

One of those places of which you have heard and where you have been but for which you have not yet written a review. So, when my cousins and I popped into this place for an early lunch on our way back from an early morning outing, it struck me that this was one review that was long over due. For the handful of foodies who bother to read my reviews, my ScoreUp-ScoreDown approach must be familiar. In this case, we are entering a restaurant with a reputation but we are not really sure what to expect. So, let us start with an average expectation that is we start with rating of 3 and then we add (or deduct) points on five parameters - Ambience and Location, Menu Spread and Availability , Quality and Taste, Service, Value for Money. If the restaurant just meets our expectations then we dont add to the score (as we have already started with a Rating of 3). For exceeding expectations we add 0.5 and deduct 0.5 for failing to meet up. Lets start ...

Ambience and Location - You dont go to a dhaba for candle lit dinner - rather you expect some hustle bustle and "Highway on my Plate" kind of feel to go with your dhaba dining. This place has got that. It covers a LARGE area and can easily sit 200 at a time. There is the AC hall with about 50 seats and with just enough comfort to go with the dhaba theme. Location wise - again the location is perfect for a dhaba. After all, a Dhaba in up-market locations like Ballygunj and Kankurgachhi are not really dhabas in the strictest sense. Sher E Punjab, is on a highway, yet within an hour's drive from most parts of the city. There is ample parking and security is not an issue - you will find families dining late in spite of being located on the outskirts. So, definitely meets expectations on this count.

Menu Spread and Variety - The North Indian spread is quite extensive and over time I have noticed its not merely different names for the same food. Catering to demand means having a Chinese menu in Dhabas nowadays and SEP has toed the line. So you can have Tandoori Rotis with Fish Manchurian if you are quirky enough (or if you belong to the adventure lover category :) ). Enough spread to meet our expectations in the North Indian section but exceeds expectations with the Chinese bit - so a Plus 0.5.

Quality of Food and Taste - We ordered Chicken Tandoori for starters and  Dal Amritsari (a recipe of chana dal), Chicken Kadai, Mutton Amritsari with Tandoori Roti for mains and lassi to wash it down. The mains were really delicious - the chicken was well seasoned and spiced and the mutton was tender and blended well with the almond paste gravy. The meat was fresh but that is a given in a fast moving restaurant as this. The rotis were good when warm but they did the cardinal mistake of serving all the rotis in one go - in an air conditioned room , this meant that the second roti was stiff by the time we reached out for it. Chicken Tandoori was ok but not exceptional - a bit on the dryer side. The howler was the lassi - they served room temperature lassi to a group who has just walked in from the scorching April sun. The food was good enough for an "exceeds expectation" rating but the lassi and roti issue prompts me to stick to "meets expectations". 

Service - Good enough. We initially sat in the non AC section (God knows why), ordered and then shifted. The waiters took care of the change without any fuss. When we pointed out that the Lassi was not cold, they immediately provided ice. However, the restaurant does not provide finger bowls and the wash basins are few and not very well lit. For the type of cuisine, using one's hands to eat is a must and hence I see this a service drawback. So, bit below expectations on this count and hence a Minus 0.5.

VFM - excellent. 7 people having a full lunch with 3 non veg items and the bill came to around 2300 - that means less than Rs.350 per head. This is definitely a big 'pro' for SEP and a Plus 0.5 here.

So, with two Plus and one Minus, the score comes to 3.5 and this is in agreement with my subjective assessment as well.

The management people are very good and the waiters serve with great care..this place is not at all much costly yet provides great food..

I went to the Jessore road one with my family and it was a superb din-ine experience. the ambience is not something you can count on if you intend on visiting this place but the food and quick service is something that all of us appreciated. The place is a bit isolated with trucks ferrying on that route and it is advisable to go with family or in a big group, as it also serves alcohol and the crowd is mixed considering that the prices are unbeatable and the food is yum.

The food we ordered was tandoori chicken, chicken reshmi masala, butter naan, tadka dal, salad and papad. The tandoori chicken was extremely well made and almost to perfection and tasted great.It was worth the 14 km travel to this place and justified the price.We were served within ten minutes of ordering and the waiters also complied with small requests for more lime and chillies.

Overall a great place and excellent dhaba type food!!!

serving the best indian cuisines in kolkata.. while going through the highway it can be the best stop for any hardcore non-vegetarian. It has a very beautiful ambiance with the runway of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Airport running besides it and planes landing and taking off within a gap of few minutes. Everyone has tasted it's Indian and Chinese cuisine but it also serves very delicious Thai food. Recently they have stopped  serving Thai dishes but being also a regular customer i request them to start serving Thai again for people who like going to this very restaurant to dine-out with friends or family.

If you are cruising down the highway and go through Kolkghat, Sher-e-Punjab becomes your destination before your reach your actual destination. The restaurant is famous for north-Indian dhabha style food but serves almost anything from Chinese to continental to Bengali. But none of the dishes can stand in front of the north Indian food that comes out of this kitchen. The place has multiple sections, the non-ac real dhaba feel while you sit outside on a cot and enjoy your food, move in to the airconditioned section where you can relax on couch and enjoy your food or visit the restaurant through the main entrance near the parking area to enjoy food with premium liquor. This is only place in a very long highway stretch which serves imported premium liquor. You name it and they might have it, different flavors of absolute, R√©my Martin, Jack Daniels and truck load of other brands. But the liquor is not why people visit this place, it‚Äôs the dhabha which attracts the crowd.
You will see bikers on weekends riding their ultra-cool super bikes, imported sedans, groups, couples and family on a long drive and people going to Mandarmani, Digha and various other places. I‚Äôve visited the place more times than I can remember, but the last was on my recent impulsive weekend trip to Mandarmani. We stopped while going as well as while coming back from Mandarmani. We reached the dhabba at 4am in morning and agreed to eat outside on the cots as the weather was cool and good while my car parked right outside covered in dust and mud.

The menu is very humorous as you read through the items (e.g. Bakre k Nakhre ‚Äì Lamb dishes, Phool aur kaante ‚Äì Seafood), we ordered paneer tikka, chicken reshmi kebab and lassi. Both the starters were good and the plates were wiped clean. I am a sucker for good lassi as I spent good amount of my childhood in Ambala and Chandigarh. The lassi was ok for me, I like my lassi thick and covered in cream and dry fruits. Though I was not expecting all these jazz here but expected it to be thick and with right amount of sweetness but to my despair the lassi was very dilute and too sweet.

While we were eating two of my group mates asked the guy in reception and they borrowed   the hose pipe being used by the restaurant staff to clean the parking and they washed my car and we left with smiling faces and shining car.

On our return back from Mandarmani, I wanted to break free from the north indian food I‚Äôve been having lately and ordered Dragon Chicken. It was delicious, I couldn‚Äôt believe my tongue and pinched myself before taking another bite and then there was not stopping. The chicken was cooked to perfection, it was soft and juicy and melted in my mouth. The flavor was excellent and the veggies were bright and vibrant and not overcooked. The only complaint I have was with 4-5 good size pieces of staranise left in the finished dish. The flavor was excellent but this needs to be taken out before you serve the dish, you don‚Äôt want customer biting on these extremely flavorful spice and then pick them out of the mouth.

Will I visit again? Of course, this is my pit stop whenever I am crossing Kolaghat like many of you foodies out there.

Overall rating: 4

Service: 3.5

This place serves the typical Punjabi Dhaba food, in all its grandeur and tasty wholesomeness. The food is served hot and spicy and the service is prompt. The best dishes are Tandoori Chicken, Butter Chicken, tandoori Roti, Butter Naan, Daal Tadka and the thick Kaali daal. Good place to have a filling meal on Jessore Road near Airport.

Sher-e-Punjab : The name is itself a brand! Punjabi khana indeed! :D
I am a bengali but I love devouring north indian food. And She-e-punjab reminds me of the long drives I had with my folks, we would hault at the higway, get down here and eat to our heart's content.

I love their tandoori chicken, tandoori roti, butter chicken and tangri butter masala. Nothing beats a classic punjabi food hogging without a lassi. As smooth as silk, malai maar ke! :D
Kolkata does not have many north indian dhaba style restaurants, the ones that do among them, this is definitely on of the best! :)

North indian foodies : This is your beckon call !

Happy eating guys,
Cheers :)

There was a time we used to frequent this place and all cousins would meet at have family get togethers enjoying the dhaba atmosphere. Being punjabis we always missed the north Indian dhaba culture in kolkata and this place was just right . Back then it used to be very reasonable in fact dirt cheap . 

We would as kids love to see planes land and take off and click pictures . The dhaba fare especially the tandoori rotis and the dall were mind blowing . They used to make a brilliant tandoori chicken . But of late there are hygiene issues. although the food is still decent but not exceptional any more. Maybe because we have evolved as eaters. 

Haven't gone to this childhood favorite in a long time . Will do so soon .

This is a great place to drive to - unfortunately they have a new closing time which makes nightcrawlers unhappy. They used to stay open till 2.30-3.00 am. Although the food is standard Dhaba fare, I do have a partiality for their egg tadka and tandoori chicken and hot tandoori rotis straight off the flame. They also make a very good lassi and the service is quite fast. I also like the tangri butter masala which they make very well indeed. If you are in the Jessore road/airport region, this is definitely a good place to be.

I visited Sher-e-Punjab twice within last month the second time being today (Dasami, 14th October 2013) I was quite surprised to see that the service has gone below standards. They have a small menu card for occasions like Durga puja or Kali puja even from the limited menu you'll get very limited options of food and super poor hospitality management. had it been the case that today was my 1st visit I wouldn't have visited there twice. All-in-all the food was okay.

last night i visit sher-e-punjab dhaba with my relatives after 1 year.i had a tough time their.we sat on ac room for xpecting some better service.but surprised to see that all waiters are busy to watching cricket match on tv.after calling two times one of them responded and gave us menu card.now the second surprise waiting for us.menu card was missing,because of puja rush,1 sheet of laminate paper with 20-25 menu on them.i asked them for chicken lasuni kabab,but they told not available.we had to choose our food from that small menu card.we ordered ckicken reshmi kabab,afgani ckicken,mutton sheek kabab,fish tikka for us.after waiting 15-20 minutes they served us starter.and all are priced too high.and food quality is pathetic.they made price tagged average 200 per plate.quantity are less and quality are bad.all plates have dirt and stains on it.after that we ordered our main course butter chicken,chicken kolhapuri,kadai mutton,kashmiri polao and naan.afain waiting.when we asked waiter for delay,he arogently answered.kashmiri polao are served in a small plate too much less quantity.not even sufficient for one people.this bad service and quality pull down sher-e-punjab's reputation down.definetly i will not visit sher-e-punjab again.my suggestion to all of you avoid this resturent.

This is an institution quite famous for there north Indian cuisine and first timers will not be disappointed with its food and ambiance. The prices are on the higher side but quantity is more then adequate. I first visited this place on ‚ÄòBijoya Doshomi‚Äô with my parents and I must confess I am not one of those typical Pandal Hopper‚Äôs and would much rather stuff my face with food then to walk here and there aimlessly, yes I am lazy and Its too much work. There I said it. As I was saying, I could always convince my mom to join my cause and convince the rest to go to Sher e panjab if we are in that area. I made it a trend for the last couple of years to make people go to eateries rather then visiting Maa Durga in puja. I get a kick out of it. I generally get Tandori chicken or tengri kebab at first. Then Order Hyderabady Chicken and Kolapuri Chicken and both of them are different and very tasty.
There Kolapuri Chicken is my personal favorite with kulcha nun which might be a bit expensive. Each item is good for 3 people and I generally sit at the front seat beside cash register it brings back memories. Service is good enough. A suggestion: it is wise to pay tip before ordering and I am sure service will be better. In conclusion this place is quite old and established eatery and no one will be disappointed if you eat here with an open mind.

At one point I used to make it a point to drive out to Sher-e-Punjab at least one sunday a month with my group of friends. It was good reasonably priced food in an open air ambience where you could watch planes land and take-off and made for a great outing. When I went a while back I found it fairly crowded and not much of a family crowd sadly. The food however was quite decent .... we had kali dal tadka, tandoori chicken , reshmi kebab ,paneer butter masala and aloo dopiaza along with a variety of naans,kulcha and tandoori roti's. The traffic and the lack of a better quality of crowd are perhaps the reasons we don't visit as often as we did earlier. The food is slighty oily and heavy but tasty enough. We also frequent the Kolaghat Branch and of late I prefer this outlet to the Jessore Road one. Makes for a nice outing on a weekend but go by 12-30 or you may not get space once peak lunch hours hit on weekends and holidays.

On the outskirts of the Airport overlooking the runway on Jessore road this Dhaba was a hit in the yesteryears.One can see out of the huge windows of the Dhaba, the  landing & taking off of the aircrafts.
There are two wings , one as you enter is the non-ac wing followed by an open area attached to which is the ac-wing.
Initially they used to serve typical Punjabi dhaba style food which was later followed up with Chinese, Thai & Continental as well.The Kadai Chicken , Tandoori Chicken & Vegetable Jhal Frezi are some of the items which sell well & are  pretty well done.Lassi was a hit during the summers!
Of late I found that the quality of food as well as their service has deteriorated & the place is now not worth a visit with the family specially at night as it is unsafe.

I have been to two of the four locations of Sher-e-Punjab.
My favourite one is the Kolaghat one as I believe the quality of food here is better. 
Anytime if I am going to Digha/Mandarmani/Tajpur/Kanthi this is the place where be it a public transport or a private car you have to stop for an early breakfast or a late night snack.
The quality is pretty good if you know what to order. My order comprises of either of the two combinations between Alloo Paratha and Lassi/Juice or South Indian with a Tutty Fruity dessert. However it is advisable you wait till the waiters to bring you the lassi/tutty fruity as the man who makes it an old person seems one who is thoroughly bored with his job and the fact that he is so busy maybe, he will make it with so little effort and such haste that he literally shoves the frutis and all so you will feel disgusted to eat your food after that.
It has an outside seating in khatias or table chairs as well as an A.C section. The other foods are not bad but then I would prefer the snacks as on a long journey I don't like being stuffed.

This is one of the best dhaba in Kolkata. The price is cheap and the service is also decent. I have been there in 3 or 4 occasions. The food there is awesome. If you have not been there then I will suggest you to start with a tandoori platter. Then u can go for the main course with kulcha or nun ,dal makhni, palang panir and finally go for the mutton kadai which is just awesome. One piece of advice is that don't go there during any festival like durga puja. During the festival season the food and service deteriorate a lot and I deduct half a point for that. Another piece of advice is that if you have enough time you can go to the kolaghat branch of Sher-e-Punjab. It is the best of all the branches.

This review is for their outlet in Kolaghat.

In one line - Perfect Dhaba. 24x7 service. We were on a office tour and stopped by to have a quick bite. The time was around 2:00 A.M. and it was still running as normal. The service was a bit slow may be for the late hours.

We ordered:

Tandoori Roti - Average on taste and size and very crispy.

Keema Matar - Very good on taste and spicy. The amount served was enough for two and high on oil content.

Chicken Bharta - Again very good on taste and quantity was sufficient for two but lacked the punch of the KEEMA MATAR.

Superb value for money restaurant. Do visit this one. You won't regret it.

Food is good. Ambience is not at all for families especially if u going there late evening or night. And as it says on the site that it would cost 350 or two. Well that's If u only order one main dish and rotis. If u plan to have a good meal it would cost u way more than that.. And above all we went there when their was only three tables yet most of the other tables were unclean and not wiped. Roti crumbs all over the seats.... I would go back there only for the food...

This has been one of the oldest Dhabas I have been to and recently when returning from the airport we decided on dropping in at this Dhaba. The good thing about this eatery is the delectable Punjabi affair ,made the way one gets food at Dhabas in and around Delhi. The drawback is that even though some dishes have remained faithful to their origins , a lot of dishes have been added which essentially confuses the customers .  The restaurant is divided into two sections, one air-conditioned section and one non-air conditioned section.  The decor is neither rustic enough for an ethnic feel nor sophisticated so I would not personally recommend a sit down meal. There is a big bar in the non air conditioned section and unfortunately there are a lot of undesirable fellow customers lurking around , so it is better to go in a large group with elders. The lassi served here could be improved. It lacks the creaminess of the lassis served in the land of the five rivers but then again that quality can probably be attributed to the quality of milk one gets at a place.  The servers though polite tend to confuse you if you ask for their recommendation and thereby it is better to stick to the good old Punjabi dishes because they try and push the newly added items such as kolhapuri chicken etc but then again why would anyone want a dish from Maharashtra when one visits a Punjabi Dhaba. We ordered the butter chicken, kadai chicken, butter roti and butter nun. You need to enjoy the food in the safety of your own four walls if not for any other reason but due to the fact that this kind of food requires a certain messy enjoyment which is uncalled for at a public eatery. The butter chicken is deliciously buttery, oily with a full robust taste of garlic onion and tomato paste and is quite hot and the taste is as authentic as it is in any Dhaba of the land of its origin itself. The Kadai chicken is hot as well but with a caramelized flavour which is amazing. The butter nun is the standard affair and so is the butter roti. The missi roti is something I did taste for the first time and I can say that it does not compliment either the butter chicken or kadai chicken but goes very well on its own with some achar and dahi. Now the reason I say that it gives complete value for money is because no other eatery in and around Calcutta gives four massive pieces of chicken for Rs220. So if one is around the airport and has some time on their hands this place is a great place to indulge in some amazingly rich and delicious dishes.

I have been to both of the branches at kolkata - airport and at kolaghat. I have been to kolaghat a couple of times. Both are having a large area, specially the one near airport. There you even have an option to sit in the garden. Both of them have both AC and Non AC arrangements( the AC being a bit costly). For the kolaghat, food was good a few years back, but presently it's bad. You will get good Kesri tea, lassi, singara( samosa). But the tandoori - fish and chicken is bad and overpriced. The chicken butter masala and the chicken tandoori butter masala is good. You will have a variety of roti which is not bad like keema roti, butter nan, kulcha. Aloo ka paratha. Apart from the food you may love to go for a late night drive on NH6 (1.5hrs from kolkata). It's safe for the family.

This branch of Sher-e-Punjab is located at Jessore road. For those of you dont know where it is go straight from airport there is an right indicator in the main road only stating Jessore road take dat after around 15 mins drive you discover sher e Punjab. Other branches or franchises whatever you may call are at park street, kolaghat, near jimmy kitchen or 10 mins walking from mocha.
 I had been here for like 2 times. It is a restaurant which is vast and provides alcohol at cheaper rates. Takes only cash payment ( doing an illegal business or what? Never mind). It is a very large place Nd has a bar inside.  discussing the pros and cons

Pros
1) food is delicious 
2) serves alcohol at a very cheap rate
3) reasonably priced 
4) has both indoor and outdoor seating
5) can accommodate large amount of people 
6) service is moderate 

Cons: 
1) ill mannered staffs
2) no flexibility for adding a chair also
3) unhygienic 
4) no proper maintainence is taken to clean the chair
5) plates are not cleaned properly
6) chicken items are very good veg items are average 
7) not too great to travel so far and eat - not economical basically 
8) no card payments accepted (god knows why) 
9) despite having such a large area occupied no developments or innovative to renovate is taking place.

Disappointed. Highly .

I went to sher e punjab last friday. I have been there often before and I knew the food there was fabulous. But the service was pathetic. The waiters were too casual and their attitude was as if they are working in "just another dhaba".
We were a group of 8 and they did not have a table to accommodate us. What was pathetic was that they were not even allowing us to sit at an empty table to wait for our table. The table was dirty and laden with ample amount of dust. We told the waiter to clean the table but he bothered to clean just the sides. We ordered palang cream but they served us Palang Paneer instead. When we complained they just took out the paneers and the served us only the gravy claiming that was Palang Cream! One more irritating thing was the mosquitoes. We were sitting in the outdoor section where there was a lot of mosquitoes. 
Nevertheless the food was good. So I dont know if that was Sher e Punjab's general attitude towards the customers or was it because this particular  waiter who served us was disgruntled.

Sher-e-Punjab is one of the preferred options whenever we set out on a drive towards Rajarhat. Ambiance will score zero marks here as its very pedestrian. The food however scores well as the  Chola is just delicious and the Paneer Tikka and Paneer Butter Masala are also good.

There is a different flavour to the food here which is very distinct and you tend to like it. The breads disappoint big time. The starters are good. The non veg is also good. The mocktails are decent.

The service is average at this place. The prices are very reasonable which is a big plus. The overall experience is okay every time we visit the place. 
3 stars for Sher-e-Punjab.

Okay, whenever i visit any outskirts of Kolkata led by Kolaghat Highway i never miss to have a short meal here. Here, the food quality is awesomely delectable and scrumptious. CHicken Tikka and lasuni Kabab is very well done. Chicken Bharta with plain butter Naan is excellent. Prices are also quite reasonable. Chicken Lollipop is wow too. Ambience is normal, it is having both a non-a.c room and an a.c room.
I would rate 4.5 for KOLAGHAT DHABA.

If you love dhaba food this is it guys no need to look anywhere else. This one is situated in Kolaghat highway and cannot miss your sight. Awesome delicious food at very low price. The quantity they offer is unbelievably good. The outside might look shabby but do not get deceived by it because inside there is proper Air Conditioned sitting arrangement. The chicken tandoori, paratha, kali dal, chicken butter masala everything is made very well and you will fall in love with it. I promise you will go all the way this long distance just to have their food. 
In brief I am in love with this place and refuse to point out anything negative though there are some. I will rate it 4 and keep silent on its drawbacks.

There stands a restaurant on the Mumbai Road. The eatery is a big one named Sher-e-Punjab standing bang on the Highway. It is crowded every time we visit as people dine or have lunch there while they're either on the way or return from a trip. 

On entering the restaurant you will find a large spacious lawn where men sit for drinks. There is a family corner where families can enjoy Punjabi cuisine. Previously, only Punjabi cuisine was available but nowadays this restaurant has transformed into a multi-cuisine one serving all sorts of varieties ranging from Indian, Chinese and Moghlai. After the food is ordered you will get a welcome drink at no extra cost. People watch television while the children play in a shaded space. The excellent ambience inside the restaurant will relax you. The air-conditioned atmosphere would make you feel sleepy and but the welcome drink might energize your spirits. 

The food is served hot and fresh from starters to the main course. The children too will not have any problem because the food is less spicy and served hot. The lip-smacking tadka is something which you can enjoy here with thin-papery rotis. This is a very popular main course dish for any Punjabi meal. The Chinese food is also delicious. Since I have not got the chance to taste their Moghlai dishes so cannot comment about them. The service is prompt and people will be around to give proper service. There are about one hundred seats arranged in different ways to make the eating orderly and systematic. The delicious taste of Punjabi and Chinese food will make you feel like visiting the restaurant often. 

The only drawback of the restaurant is that they do not accept cards and have to pay cash. When the world believes in plastic money, Shere-Punjab with its excellent service should also change to accept cards along with cash.

If you are planning for a short break from the city yet find a place close to city, go to Sher- E- Punjab. Excellent place for a family reunion or a friend's get-together.

I was there couple of years back and visited it again last week. Let me first tell you the reasons of happiness and then talk about the disappointment. A hugely specious place to have a comfortable seating arrangement. If you are looking for 5 star treatment then definitely this is not the place to go. 

We ordered for Fish Tikka, Chicken Afgani as starter. Taste was awesome. Specially the Chicken Afgani. It was soft and very juicy. 

Our main dish had, Dal Makhani, Roti, Naan, Dahi Mutton and Chicken Hyderabadi. Dal and Rotis were really good. Chicken Hyderabadi was surprisingly not the typical hyderabadi one. But Dahi Mutton was disappointing. 

My biggest disappointment though something else. There was a board saying today's special as Makai d Roti and Sarson da Saak. But when I ordered they said it was not available. Truly speaking I went all the way to have Sarson da Saak and Makai Da Roti. Such a large dhaba not having the most authentic punjab delicacies is a disappointment. 

Overall, with the place I am satisfied and I don't mind going there again.

tasty but the quantity is not good compared to the price. they serve very late. it is situated at a very strategic position. the chicken tandoori should have been cooked better. the chicken bharta is good though. but i would definitely not agree with zomato that it costs 350 per head. i would say that it would cost you atleast around 500

THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST DHABA BETWEEN KOLKATA AND NADIA. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THE TANDOORI PLATTER. FOR THOSE TRAVELLING BY CAR FROM AIRPORT TO DURGAPORE, I SUGGEST YOU TAKE A SMALL DETOUR AND HAVE YOUR MEALS HERE AS THERE IS NO PROPER EATING PLACE TILL PANAGARH. FOR THOSE TRAVELLING TO KRISHNANAGAR, THIS STOP IS A MUST. VERY SPACIOUS AND VERY GOOD FOOD.

Awesome Punjabi food. For a person like me, who is a pure Punjabi at heart after spending 10 long years in Delhi, this place freshens up the memory off the famous 'Dilli la tandoori chicken'... Drinks are dirt cheap, and should try the Butter Chicken, it's awesome...

Small distance from my home. so i went here many times. Its perfect for drinks. Food quality is good. But Most important Punjabi foods are at its best. there are some open space where u can hangout with ur friends with drinks in your hand. Ambiance is nice. seating arrange can be better. U can smoke here. Staffs are well behaved. Prices are low compared to its foods and everything. worth a visit. I m sure u will come back again. Parking facility is very good and big space. Transport facility is not so good because it is in middle of two bus stopages. But overall experience is nice.

There was a time when this place used to be my favorite. But  after my last visit Im never going back there again. Well, I was there with my two friends. First, we ordered some drink & afgani chicken. The bombay mix came with a fly in it. And when we complained the management seem to be least interested. Dirty utensils,  dirty tables & careless service men to add on.  The most funniest part is, when we asked for another drink the service man confidently proclaimed that no girl can have drink without a male company so we had to leave. That was total bullshit!!

I often go to sher e punjab with my family.. punjabi food is awesome here. One should go there if you have a car, because coming back at night can be a problem. Indian chicken dishes are all good. have tandoori roti, it is always fresh and crisp.
