Average place but we had a great time there. We were a group of about a dozen schoolmates meeting after a long time, therfore nothing really mattered but all of us having a great adda. We had a few drinks accompanied by side dishes of all kinds -  chicken, fish, prawns and meat.... Some rice and noodles too... Food was ok but the service was good. The love music was a bit of a headache at times. Not so bad after all, overall.
