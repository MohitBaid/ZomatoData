Decent food at reasonable price. My personal favourite is the chicken 65, which is a great starter dish. The main course and side dish are average. Good service, though the space is slightly cramped. The biggest advantage is its prime location, the busy Jadavpur Thana intersection, which is accessible by bus from almost any part of Kolkata.

Satisfied my craving for food with a plate of mixed hakka chowmein and a chicken side dish yesterday. Average as a whole. The quantity of chowmein was good but the side dish was a complete waste of money. The chicken side dish costs 150 and serves only 6 small pieces of chicken. 
If you are dying for food and can't locate any better choice then you can opt for this place near Jadavpur PS else I'll personally recommend don't. It won't be pocket friendly for you.

On 25se Baishakh we (me & my g.f) went to this roadside restaurant, and were pretty much excited about it.  When we entrd the the a.c was off, and they didn't bother to turn it on, after 5 mins when other foodies arrive and requestd for the a.c then they turnd it on. We ordered the Chinese combo here which comprises of chicken drumstick, soup, chicken fried rice/noodles, chili chicken and ice cream. After placing the order, they took hardly 15mins to serve the dishes, for which we wwre happy. but here comes the point, first, they served, sorry they didin't served we ourselves served for us,it was the drumstick, the taste of which was good enough but too small, then we had the Dangerous SOUP, how can i describe the taste of the soup i really don't have words for it, it was 'WAAK', THE CHICKN PIECS IN THE SOUP WAS ALSO PARTIALLY BOILED. Then came the chickn noodles, the taste of which was below par, some roadside stalls makes it better than them, but the chilli chickn was average. Here comes the climax, AFTER HAVING these foods WE were waiting for the ice crm to be servd, but initially we found that they got BUSY with other customers, so we thought that ice crm might be not in the menu, but after coming home and seeing their menu IN ZOMATO. we found ice cream is mentioned in the menu, but they didin't gave that to us, for which we are really hurt. This roadside establshmnt also take v.a.t, So I want you foodies to get aware of this restaurant, it was one of  my biggest mistake in life, to visit such a NON SENSE RESTAURANT. Size of the restaurant is also very small, tables are attached closely making couples uncomfortable, WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. I suggest you foodies to opt for hanglas, hanglatherium, lokahar, as there almost all things are perfect.

This restaurant is no more in existence. The name has been changed to Rana Restaurant. Food quality is normal, not so much to say about. Restaurant interior is clean and tables are always available as there is no such crowd visiting this place all the time.

Never had a complete meal from here. Just tried the egg chicken roll once while crossing down the Jadavpur Police Station crossing. It was pretty average, nothing extraordinary. The chicken kebabs inside were a bit spicy and they used chillies inspite of me repeatedly reminding them of not using. Hence a 3 point for now.

this is possibly the most awful place that can be visited for food...food quality is not good..and most of all their service is poor. Their service depends on the value of the order...if they find it low...and if someone is alone at the restaurant they wont even bother to turn on the ac...even if the customer asks for it...this is my experience obviously..I don't know how many plates of food they want a single customer to eat for deserving a proper behavior and service

I went there for a quick bite and a place to sit. The space is small, and the tables are quite close set. It was stuffy and uncomfortable, and we had to ask them to crank up the AC; even after we made the request, it took them quite a while to handle the AC. The food was ordinary. The quantity was alright. The lassi was terrible - it tasted sharp and acidic, because the curd had turned sour. The service is average, too. Not planning to return to this place until I really Have to.
