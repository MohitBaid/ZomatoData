Apart from a very limited seating experience and the unavailability of some foods most of the time , this place serves great food. DO TRY THEIR FISH AND CHIPS , which might just be the best in Kolkata.

It's located besides IIHM sector 5, it is a quiet good place for Pocket friendly snack items and small dessert. I love to eat veg and chicken hotdogs,  veg and chicken croissants. They are so fresh and creamy. Only with catchup they taste awesome. I also like to try their brownies. 
So overall I can rate 4/5 to this outlet

This outlet is located just beside IIHM, Sector 5 and seeks the attention of the college students over there. This is not actually a substitute of Mio Amore but then yes, they serve fantastic food at very affordable prices! I tried out some of their amazing dishes.

1. Chicken Burger : The Chicken Patty was damn amazing and the burger bread was absolutely fresh. The taste was simply amazing, to be honest!

2. Chicken Pizza : Served hot, this pizza will not disappoint you with the numerous chicken toppings on it. It tastes great with seasonings and chilli flakes.

3. Chicken Patty : It was one of the best patty, I've ever had in my life. With it's unique taste, one will definitely become one's favourite!

4. Chicken HotDog : The bread being on the softer side, I'll give it extra brownie points for it. Besides, the chicken tossed in masala in between the HotDog was absolutely noteworthy.

I had two more items of Chicken and Cupcakes along with it. The former items were just fantastic with juicy chicken inside while the latter was damn delicious. The cupcakes looked cute and were fresh too. Loved it absolutely.

Extra points for the presentation of every item they serve. It's a small outlet and there is no ambience as such. There is a place where you can sit adjoined to the restaurant and eat the food.

The person who serves is very polite and service is fast too. If you're hungry and want a place for a good snack, this is the place you need to drop around if you're around Sector 5. Recommended.

Location : 4.5/5

Date: 25/5/2017.
Location: Sector V, Saltlake, near IIHM.
Ambience: It is a very small restaurant with a small room for the counter and ready to eat snacks like pastry and savory items. It has outdoor seating which is again very small. 
Service and staff: Service and staff were not very quick. But it was lunch time and the place was very crowded so I am over looking that fact.
Description: I went there with my friends after our exam. We ordered 2 plates of chicken momo and four plates of paratha with chicken curry. The momo was too oily. Even the red and green chilli sauces which were served with momo were oily. But I liked the paratha and the chicken curry. The chicken curry was really yummy..

Fried Chicken and Fish n chips are lip smacking. White sauce pasta n mixed sauce pasta are must try. Blue curacao is my favourite of the lot.

thought of giving 4.5 stars.. but could not help myself from giving it a 5 star rating. found this small restaurant in 2014, tried pasta there.. couldn't imagine that will cost me around only Rs.50. later joined a company in sector 5 in 2016 and suddenly found this restaurant again. went inside it.. still found same amount of pasta at same price. had to swallow Rs. 30 chicken croissant with cold drinks, yes that big it is.. with hefty amount of chicken cheese and mayonnaise. best place for the daily office goers in sector 5 to have lunch with best quality food at a very cheap price.. two thumbs up

Had visited here twice. One the first day i had chicken roll and second day i had veg pasta. 
First of all the rolls were average. The paratha of the roll was made of atta rather than maida. Hence it tested a little awkward. Although it is more hygienic. Also the sauce they provide is of good brand rather than of local made sauces. Hence you can say that the rolls are little pale in taste still less affective to our health. 
Now coming about the pasta they serve pastas in three different sauces. White sauce, red sauce and mixed sauce.

We had red and white sauced pasta. And i must say both of them were very tasty. 
The red sauced pasta was a bit spicy whereas the white sauced one had enough amount of cheese in it hence tasted very well. 
Love to visit here again...

Food is really good here. You get fresh baked breads here in your kulcha sandwich, or if you like a less spicy you can go for the submarines. They are creating new items in their menu every now and then. Now, they have live counter where you see your pastas made infront of you. If you are fish lover you should try their fish and chips, its only for 50 bucks! Fresh creamy basa along with big fat fries and perfect dip, its ultimate winner in their menu and on your palate too. White sauce pasta is recommended too. They give satisfying quantity at a very cheap price. If you are in sector v and in webel dont forget to stop by.

A pretty small cake and savoury outlet run by the IIHM in Sector 5, which has majority non veg and quite a few veg items. The place is generally crowded with tonnes of IIHM students eating out here and the outlet does not give a very good picture of itself when seen from outside. A few seating arrangements have been made outside and a momo centre set-up. The place is small but a decent range of items are available, with very few options for the veggies. I bought their vegetable patties and choco mousse cup. The mousse appeared beautiful with a cherry topping but was stale and tasted rotten, the cream was pathetic and I request the management to serve fresh stuff to customers. Coming to the patties, it was nice with very good vegetable content, tasted great when microwaved and perhaps the best patty in this area and this is the major reason for me not rating this place too low. Striking differences between the 2 items I bought from them!

Prices are pretty low and the patty cost me just 15 bucks, while the mousse costs 25. On top of that, they accept Sodexo meal vouchers which is an added benefit for me!

Service is nice and nothing much to comment about the ambience.

This is a part of IIHM. It has two sections (Ready made ones like Burgers, Sandwiches. Pastries, too ! And also Pasta, Momo on the other hand)
Like any other outlet, the ambience is okay. Since it attracts the college crowd and office people, it remains crowded mostly.
It has very few seating arrangements outside. 
Chicken Tikka Croissant is good. Whereas, the Chicken Pasta was not made properly. The pasta was not boiled properly. However, the white sauce was good to the taste buds.
Momo is satisfactory.

Overall, good for Student Hangouts and Pocket Friendly Joint. :)

This is my favourite cake shop in Calcutta. You have a good selection of burgers, pastries, tarts, biscuits, etc. The chocolate and the lemon tarts are delicious. My brother loves the black forest cake. The savoury collection includes veg and non-veg sandwiches, patties and quiches. All great in flavour and quality. 

I do recommend trying out both their sweet and savoury items!

I prefer the white sauce than the red sauce in my pasta but both are equally good. I have had better Momos in other places so no point for that. Oops. So if you work in Sector 5 give their pasta a try.

Went there couple of days. First I tried their Egg Chicken Roll. It was good. Not too much oil. Properly wrapped and served. Next day, I had Chicken Momo and Chicken Hotdog. Momo had very less Chicken and it came with Garlic and Green Chutney. The green chutney was stale. Chicken Hotdog was not with a usual sausage. It was more like a sandwich. And it was not fresh too. The only good thing about it is that they have kept reasonable prices.

Not much can be said about its ambience, as it's always full of students of IIHM chirping around to their hearts content :P .

It's definitely a place to hang out with friends and colleagues along with a quick bite of delicious food without a bite to the pocket.

A small eatery comparable to the stature of the likes of Mio Amore, Kathleen, Sugarr & Spice etc., Good Food is of much better grade and versatility, with terrific value for money. The ingredients are fresh and food is well prepared. The Subway, with chicken and mayonnaise plentiful, and the Chocolate Brownie are splendid suggestions.
Major cons include the limited choices at disposal and the boxy seating arrangements. Overall it's quite a good place for grabbing budget bites, and among the places in Sector V where I have more attendance than in college.

In evening they make chiken fries which can easily be compared with kfc. I have spend lots of my leisure time there during my office. If you are at sector 5. You can try once.

Tired of eating in monginis nd sugar & spice? Not really feeling like hopping into kfc or Mcd? Well,then this is the place you're looking for.

Location : Just adjacent to the IIHM building , a few mins walk from the Webel Bus-stop ,this is a small outlet for delicious bakery food.

Food : The outlet justifies its name and serves quality food consistently. They have a wide variety of chicken and veg patties, burgers, croissants and hot-dogs. I love their chicken hot-dog with mayonnaise. Very fresh and sumptuous amount of quantity will urge you to visit repeatedly.
I like the marble cakes and chocolate tarts , however , i have tasted better cupcakes elsewhere. They also serve cold drinks for very reasonable price.

It is an initative taken by IIHM. Unlike popular brands, the items here are somewhat different from the regular ones. They  have  an outdoor seating for about 12 people , very basic and good for a quick byte.

Overall,very pocket-friendly and a must visit  in sector 5.

Small counter and have plenty of option to choose from.

Basically,foods are prepared by Indismart students and that is really a good initiative.

Cost: Very pocket friendly.

 I tried chicken puff,chicken momo,fruit cake sliced.Chicken puff and fruit cake was really good but momos were a bit stiff.

Oil is really less in their snacks,so consuming them doesn't make you bother about the extra calories.

More or less ok types.

Reached this place hungry with no expectation, just did not want to have street food so this one seemed to be an appropriate option. The food rack seemed almost empty at every early evening but the price labels on the items made me a little doubtful about the quality. I made the minimum order possible, A chicken croissant; I was really surprised by the taste, quality, freshness, presentation everything were just perfect for this one, although I had to search for the chickens in the chicken croissant, but nevertheless it wasn't disappointing. I really became fond of the fresh bread. I  was delighted with the first serving and ordered one bread pudding, next, once again, no complaints. 
Come here to have a cheap healthy snack, with no additional charges for ketchups !

We went to Good Food during the lunch hours. We weren't that hungry considering the fact that we had already had a light lunch at office. The place was very small, a typical confectionery. The first thing that struck us there was the price. The prices of the different items were pretty pocket friendly. We ordered for Chicken Hot Dog, Nano Chicken Sandwich, Veg Burger, and Chicken Croissant. The quantity was beyond our expectation as the croissants and the burgers were huge!! The man out there is quite friendly too. One can take the food and sit outside and enjoy a quick heavy bite. So the next time you are unable to prepare your lunch for office in the morning, do hop in to this place.

I am a regular at this confectionery outlet. The sandwiches are freshly baked and soft. My favorite is the chicken croissant. It also serves fried chicken in the evening.

A very small outlet, good effort from students to build this up in Sector-5.
To be honest , when it first started, I remember the large sandwitches they would provide, had enough chicken and was so big, we used to take half of it. Patties and Brownies are good,
Chicken and fish fries are also very good , though fish fries are a bit overpriced.
You shall get a lot of chicken pieces in Pasta or patties.
But few items they really need to improve--> Roll, it does not taste good at all, as if you are chewing a rubber, definitely they have potential of providing better rolls than that. and the bread items and burgers' qualities need to improve a lot.
Try to avoid the breads they provide outside or tarts , mostly very hard.
And they have stared adding more cabbage instead of chicken in the sandwitches about which I wrote earlier, though I guess they have stopped preparing those now.

Good Food is a gem of a bakery in sector 5. It is tiny but always crowded, flocked by students and office goers alike, and thus one has to literally push and shove to get his/her voice heard and order placed. The first reason to consider this place over other bakeries would be the super reasonable price. I actually cannot recollect any other place selling a good standard gooey brownie for 22 rupees. The stuff I absolutely love to have from here - chicken fry, chicken puff and brownie. 
Even a year back the chicken fry was priced at 50 rupees for two pieces. Now I believe the prices have gone up and each piece is available for 40 bucks. But even then, for an insignificant amount of 40 rupees, having a huge piece of a lovely, spicy, crunchy chicken is unthinkable. It tastes so good that one can just gobble on it happily with simple tomato ketchup. The taste and smell borders more on the likes of a good chicken pakora. If I am not wrong, the fried chicken have to be pre-ordered if one wants a substantial amount for takeaway, and even otherwise, it simply goes off the rack by 12.30 p.m. max. I love the chicken puff they make because of its generous stuffing, and the patties is crispy yet compact, minimal flaky (which is awesome because I hate super flaky ones) and soft. One bite of the puff and the entire thing melts in the mouth. The brownie too is pretty good and standard for the price quoted. 
Yet there are many-a-orders that one should completely avoid at this place, for example, lemon tart. It was the most disgusting tart of my life. Simply put, do not experiment here, and one shall be happy ordering-reordering the items loved, gobbling them down with an ecstatic wallet in place.

A small outlet, it can be missed very easily. But not the next time, when you have had your food once from the place.

Though mainly a bakery & confectionery shop, it is an extension of the INDISMART Hotel. The prices are surprisingly reasonable, given the prices prevailing in the area (Rose Confectionery, Monginis, Sugar & Spice, Kathleen etc.).

The Veg Pasta I tried was soggy, mainly because, it was "precooked". But the vegetable puff was more than value for money.

Overall a nice small joint for small hunger pangs.
