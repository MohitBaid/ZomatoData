I had not visited the place personally... The prices as shown in the menu are high... As we have different cafe like CAFE 360 CLOUD 9, The price of the food are pocket friendly... The masala cold drink costs 120 it's too high...

The hookah is good but the staffs are very bad and not at all polite it's definitely not a place you are looking for food only good for hookah
