Good sentences, and well pronounced. If I live to be as old as Sybylla, I shall die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the Thai green curry.

A stone's throw away from Ballygunge Science College, located on the Ballygunge circular road, Winching can easily boast of cooking one of the most delicious Chinese food  that I have ever tasted. We had ordered one of the combo meals with chicken, and it was very good. The quantity was quite adequate for one person meal, and the packaging was also good. I would definitely order food from this place again.

Wokching is really a stones throw away from my place . A delivery , and resonable . Wanted my friend to have local chinese chowmien , Different from Gurgaon . We ordered a combo . the momos were filled with different vegs , and the noodles were sure enough Calcutta type . Watch out .. they have fancy names for many of thier dishes . We also opted for a stir fry veg starter. it did have exotic vegs that it promised ,Pak Chouy , brocally and loads of Mushrooms which i had to fish out . 
Delivery was late as it took more than an hour when we are located walking distance of a few houses . 
Quantity and quality was average , Would i order again yes , but this time would ask my jeeves to pick it up .

The place has no seatings.  So it was a takeaway.  
Pan Fried Momo- Delicious. It was very tasty and fitting. 
Chicken Chow- Very well tossed up with proper taste. Again good quantity.  
I have also tried the Lat me kai which was spicy and good with that. 

Service was good.  The only thing no is for the overpriced menu. Good quantity but comparatively little overpriced.
