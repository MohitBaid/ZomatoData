A small restaurant with amazing food quality and quantity. We tried their dry chilli chicken and mixed chow mein which was really good. The side dish exactly matched for boozing purpose! We tried hot chocolate brownie with ice cream which was served in a sizzler plate with good presentation skills but the chocolate was burnt though it had a very extreme combination of hot and cold. 
Overall an economical good place it booze along with good food.

Located Near Sector V Webel Bhavan, Hing Bar and Restaurant is a place for people who just wants to sit in a group and enjoy their drink. Though they claim to be a family restaurant cum bar, it is not at all a family restaurant. Food here is pretty average. We ordered so many dishes, none of them were one to remember. Very less space in between seats. Too few staffs to cater to a large weekend crowd. At least they have kept the prices reasonable or else it would have been a disaster. We ordered Bhuna Banjara, Butter Nan, Rumali Roti, Chicken 65, Crispy Chicken Fry, Crispy Fish Pepper Salt, Dak Bungalow, Lemon Coriander Garlic Fish, Paneer Kadhai, Reshmi Lababdar, Paneer Tikka. They had offer of some of the drinks, which were quiet reasonable too.

Ambiance: 2/5

Was searching for some pocket friendly place to deliver me food fast, and this place had got me covered. I had ordered Mutton Rezala from this place. The delivery was done right on time. But the Rezala had very thin gravy which was sweet and lacked flavour, the mutton pieces were tender and cooked nicely but were small and didn't have much meat on the pieces. All in all very average experience.

Went to this place in Sector 5 near the Eden's building of TCS. The decor might not be too good but the service definitely is. The servers take special care while serving food and drinks. Coming to the food, it was delicious. We started with the mixed kebab platter and the pan fried prawns. For main course we ordered masala kulcha, Kadhai sabji, Yellow Dal, Chicken Dak Bangla and Kolkata Kosha. Each and every dish was delectable especially the dal and the chicken. We had asked them to ensure that the mutton was soft so not only did they do that but also pulled out the bones so that we would not have any problem. I definitely recommend this place. I plan to visit soon again.5

Well, a special veg thali dine-in at a place more renowned for it’s liquor and hookah!

This one is a pretty simple hookah bar cum lounge tucked away inside the Sector 5 TCS, Lords building lane – a lane which is pretty devoid of good eateries. Since the IPL season was on, they did impart the IPL décor to attract more crowd.

Famous proverbs adore the walls and they have also put up a few TV sets to keep the guests entertained! However, you don’t really feel a café sort of ambience!

Seating arrangements are pretty modest – the conventional wooden ones – which is ok! I ordered a special veg thali, which indeed was special – sooooooooooooo ……… much of food!

The same was served in some 20-25 minutes and comprised:-

(i)	2 pcs tandoori roti (plain)

(ii)	Mixed vegetable 

(iii)	Palak paneer

(iv)	Navratan korma

(v)	Yellow dal fry

(vi)	1 pc papa

(vii)	Rice 

(viii)	Some salads

(ix)	1 pc gulab jamun

Some green chilly was served on request. Service, prices, food, etc – all are good – barring 1 item – the Navratan korma - was just toooooooooooooooo heavy – and caused so much discomfort to me once I was through with the meal. May be this item can be modified or replaced with something better!

The quantity served definitely deserves a special mention – I did have a difficult time completing everything! No reservations for the taste as well as food quality!

Overall, a superb experience – offset by the Navratan korma!

Context: I was staying in a shitty hotel. Ordered food as per the ratings.

Ordered: Pulao and Special veg thali.

The good: 
1. Delivered on time.
2. Pulao was good.

The bad:
1. There were three vegetables all were tasteless. Daal was a little too salty. 
2. Roti was too difficult to chew. Repercussions of food delivery may be.

The Ugly:
1. Rice had a hair.
2. Packing was abysmal. Maybe be all the masalas leaked, leaving the food tasteless. 

Conclusion: Never Again.

Not a very cheap place but cheaper than all the other bars / restaurants in Sector 5. 

A small place crammed with booths and tables. Too lit for a bar. Can improve on the ambience. 

Service: Fast  and efficient.

Since we visited in the evening, we ordered 3 starters which were filling enough for 3 of us.

What we ordered :

1. Chicken 65: Prepared in a totally Indian Tadka style, spicy and tangy with curry leaves. Surprisingly, yummy!

2. Drums of Heaven : Six pieces of chicken winglets tasting similar to the first dish.

3. Chicken Anarkali :  Basically, Chicken Tikka. Soft and tasty. 

Note: Prices not updated on the menu.

One of those places in sector 5 which has stood the test of time, despite stiff competition from the new players in the pub market... The fact that you still get cheap booze here is one of the main reasons why you have to wait in frustrating queues on the fridays... Nice place to hang out with office colleagues or friends... Serves pretty good food to go with the cheapish booze and quite prompt service despite the rush... Though don't let the 650 for two thing mislead you... The drinks prices have increased quite a lot... But they do have happy hour offers till 8PM so visit and order in bulk early to save a significant amount of money... And do try the Tikka Gulistan, the assorted kabab platter... This dish is an absolute winner...

An average restaurant with less costly bar that's all. 
Ambience and decor is very old and cheap. It's very dimly lighted so if you are not there for boozing it's off-putting. 
Foods are unexceptional. Loved their bahari tangri. Chinese items are also passable.
Drinks are comparatively low-priced but maximum time you wouldn't get your choice specially in case of beer.
Try it if other bars are full on Friday night. You wouldn't get a long waiting queue here.

They let us sit for hours after our meal while my friends drank and we chatted away to glory.

Can be best termed as a watering hole. Not recommended for dining experience. Drinks are average price.
Food is bad to average for starters we took mutton sikh kabab
Which was rubbery and tasteless.
Fish items are also not good.
Only saving grace was the fried rice and chilli chkn which were average.

This is one of my favorite after office hangouts. Just opposite TCS Eden, so mostly you'll find the usual IT crowd. The place doesn't seem like much, looks very dark and dank, but actually its not that bad. Seating capacity is limited, so wouldn't advise groups larger than 6. The decor is hip and funky, with all booze related metaphors.
Food is not the best out there but it goes well with the drinks. My fav dish here is Pankhari, 6 jumbo chicken wings cooked tandoori style.
This place doesn't aim to be anything higher than an usual IT watering hole, so don't expect anything more than that.

Hing bar is located just opposite the TCS building in sector 5 so it is quite easy to locate. It is a small bar with limited seating area. The place is quite dark and dimly lit. The place gives a lot of privacy as all the seats are quite far apart. The food is good but not the best in town and the options in the beer menu was quite less. The service is good and the  price is moderate as well. The place is a recommended for the people working nearby for a quick sip of beer. :)

We went to this place for an office party. Very dark dingy place, something like a tangra restaurant. Not sure what kind of feeling u get on normal days. Food was ok. Not much of an interior.

Have never visited this place. Rating only based on the few take away.

Among sides the Kumbh Matar and Ludhiana Sukhi Chicken were great. Love their pulaos (both chicken and prawn). Before they started the bar, the food used to be better. Afterwards they made everything spicier (I think to go well with the drinks). But still like the above preparations. Price is on the higher side though.

This restaurant is just opposite to our office and provides a low cost option to satisfy for palate when ever you want to dine outside and not go for the canteen /cafeteria ordeal. The food is surprisingly above average. Nothing fancy though but the staple Chinese is value for money .

I visited this place couple of years ago, it was OK. I visited them yesterday, they have become terrible. Not only the place is poorly maintained, but the food they serve is atrocious. Staff are somewhat courteous, but the menu and the food is terrible. I don't recollect having such terrible food in a decade. We ordered sausage with Barbeque sauce, what we received was Chicken fillet cooked in oil, turmeric, a lots of chilly powder and some very poorly prepared French fries which had been dipped in a red batter of some sort. The fries were terrible with semi rotten potatoes. Then came the real nightmare, Rara Mutton kebabs, I could not have more than one as it was boiled Mutton which had raw Mutton smell in it, dipped in chilly powder. The only palatable dish was the Spanish omelette, which again was over salted. It was a get together of friends after a long time, and needless to say, our meetup went for a toss, and we are trying to forget the experience. I highly recommend to avoid this place under any circumstances. A strict NO NO.

Another one in my disaster list. I hit this place on a Friday, as opium, bistro and on way bar was overly crowded.  It was pretty empty, and the reason was quite evident from my experience. I had to ask for water numerous times and after my pleas the waiter served one glass of water to 6 people. They forgot our order for starter, provided us with a spoon after a lot of request. We ordered chili shredded chicken and drums of heaven for starter. The shredded chicken was good while the drums of heaven was more likely made in hell as it was too hot to tolerate. For main course we ordered chilly chicken, kung pao chicken and mixed fried rice. The taste of each of these were average. I can not comment on the beer as it was as usual - "bitter".  The ambiance was shady and quite opposite to my taste. I have checked it out of my restro list for sure.

Bang opposite TCS Eden Building, this Bar cum restaurant is ur only option when the rest around the area runs on a waiting list. Though I wouldn't rate it based on that.
Hing as a office front bar is a quick nick for the office crowd. The seats are comfortable and most importantly not very open out, hence u have your own privacy. I enjoy the sofa seats especially, comfortable for four. The lights are just fine with spotlights dropping on the center of your table.
There are quite a lot of variety on the menu, but not as much at the counter. I found Malibu, Budweiser Magnum, Breezer variants missing, and more that my oblivious memory fails to recall. The food isn't the best in town, which I definitely expect them to raise the quality. Though it isn't bad too, it just satisfies your taste buds.
The services are good, haven't faced any challenges yet. Though a bit more generosity and modesty with premier attending would definitely raise the standards.
Overall, this is a nice place to hangout and I definitely get my privacy here.

It's shabby, it's dark, the service is slow - but Hing has a soul of its own. It doesn't have any of the 'classy' features of a sports bar, but if you chance upon a game of cricket, you'll be clapping along with strangers in no time. The signature dish is Pankhari (chicken wings) and the Tandoori, Tikka kebabs. A few of my friends and myself meet up here at times and we always have a good time - in the sense that we ignore the surroundings and just catch up on our lives along with a couple of drinks. Also, just stepping out of the door is a nice porch where a group can easily sit down and enjoy a smoke or two. Beware of the bird droppings though - it can get pretty nasty if you have a two-wheeler parked beneath the tree that stands outside the restaurant. 

Haven't tasted any other dish much but have never been disappointed with the kebabs - especially Pankhari.

And then after getting a table we waited another 15 minutes for the menu card.. The waiters were too lazy to take orders. Food quality and quantity both sucks.

Came here a few times. Food is good, however service is below average. The waiters are rude and the waiting time is very long. The place is very, very dimly lit and the sitting arrangement is very crowded.

The Indian food is just fine. Liked the keema pulav, chicken lababdar, chicken rezalla, bhuna mutton. The tandoori was fine but the rashmi kebab tasted bland. Loved the meatballs and drums of heaven. Barbeque chicken was good amongst Cantonese main course. The desserts were actually good. Enjoyed the sizzling brownie with ice cream, date pancake and darshan. Many of the items from the bar menu are often not available.

This place would have been so much better if the service could improve.

Hing is very easy to locate. Get down at Webel in Sector V and ask anybody for the TCS Lords building. Hing is located right opposite to the building.
Hing makes delicious food. Pankhri, a semi sizzled dish of juicy chicken wings and Cheesy Meat Balls are my favorite. The Spanish Chicken Omlette is a good munch on as well.
What will turn you off at Hing is the consistency of poor service. They probably have some sort of expertise on how to waste customers with horrible customer service.

Located just opposite of the TCS building in Sector V ring road area. So, it is very easy to locate. We checked in on a Friday & I would advice to avoid that as there is huge rush on Fridays. We had to wait for around 20 mins before we were given seats. With our drinks we ordered 2 plates of a chicken kebab combo platter that they serve @358. It was tasty enough & went well with the booze. But overall the price is slightly on the higher side. They do need to improve their service. We had to ask several times just to switch on a fan. Also, the management gives so much attention to the regular customers others are sure to feel ignored. This is definitely not a good business etiquette. Hope these things are taken care of ASAP!

Located just opposite to the TCS Eden Building in Salt Lake Sector 5 area, Hing was one of the most visited Bar cum restaurants when we used to work there. We were too lazy to walk a distance to other restaurants. It is small place and can accommodate 25 people eating at the same time. All the north Indian and Chinese dishes are very good. They offer corporate discounts on food sometimes. 

Food pricing is a bit on the higher side. The restaurant could do a bit more with lighting, as because its too dark and sometimes may appear shabby to some.

So if you are working Salt Lake Sector 5 area, you can give this a try.

Located just outside TCS main building at sector V, so its easy to locate. Firstly when you enter, its so dark that you will have a real hard time figuring out the wall, the seats, etc. Secondly the food is extremely priced. Thirdly the food tastes horrible and comes in small portions. Basically there is nothing good going on about this restaurant. Avoid if i can.

What's in a sports bar u say? Oh nothing much. Nothing much other than the fact that 100 other idiots like you cheer to every ball that Virat hits. While Hing is no sports bar, it was nothing short of it during the India vs West Indies semifinals. 
The game did not pan out the way we wanted but the restaurant did. Special offers on select drinks and awesome chicken pankhuri kababs are always appreciated. A good to hang out with the gang. The service men are really friendly and suggestive. And as always Bon appetite...

You can come here alone for a quick drink, or with friends , in both cases, you will be pleased.
Serving people are friendly.
I like the Dry Chilli Chicken, Pankhari(Chicken Wings).
Spacious area, not much waiting time.
Their sausages used to be 'not so good', but recently they have changed the prep. With french fries, sausages are awesome now.
Check out offers before ordering.

Only disappointment, they dont offer corporate discount yet. But everytime they assure me, its WIP.
Even if, the discounts dont come up,i feel happy coming back everytime.

I ordered Kashmiri Pulao with Lahori Kofta and Patalsahi Chicken Bharta. This combination is too good. Lahori Kofta is stuffed with minced paneer and dip in a thick gravy. Patalsahi Chicken Bharta is basically a chicken bharta mixed with egg bhurji.

Kung pao chicken, chicken 65 and chicken lollipop are some of the dishes I find good to have once. Apart from that chicken tikka kebab masala and masala kulcha are the go to dishes if you don't want to experiment much. Frankly speaking, you should not try experimenting with dishes in those places. Once ordered malai kofta, ended up regretting to eat that dish.
But nevertheless good place to have lunch of you just want to have some spicy foods to spice up your afternoon 😝

Such a place to drink n chill is there is sec - 5 is a great find... With offers on beer and someone treating you this gotta be the place.. The ambiance the music is good the alcohol price doesn't pinch you. But yesh for everything good you have to wait so on a Friday evening we had to wait too. But it didn't took more than 15 mints and we were on our respective seats... Food tasted really good, more I like the way it was served..

Overall YESHHHH I WILL VISIT YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN

This would be the single restaurant I have visited maximum number of times. Not because it serves awesome food. It is just opposite to my office. :P . Most of the office parties (birthdays and so on) end up being here.

They serve good quality food. Few items are: 
1. Five Spiced Chicken Drums
2. Chicken Bharta
3. Bhatinda Bhatti
4. Mixed Fried Rice

Interiors are good for a bar. Very dimly lit and with large LED TVs to give u the feel of a sports bar. Service is average. 
Tip: Go with some cash to get 10% discount on bill. Cheers!

Great value for money. The amount of food you get for the price is one of the main reasons to go. The quality of food is also good enough. The place isn't too big and is mostly very dimly lit. Service is good, but sometimes you have to call a waiter to clean up a messy table before you would want to take a seat.
Overall I give it a thumbs-up.

The place is good... Foods are good also,,, Just one suggestion for boozers, do not order kingfisher as they are providing some buy 2 get 1 free type of order. They will charge 300 per bottle. At least Kingfisher do not worth the money. Other wise you can spend some time over there in your busy schedule. Thank you.

I have been here a number of times, though this is the first time I am writing a review. I visited this today on 31st for lunch. They showed us an offer where if you order 3 Kingfishers, you pay for two of them and the third one was free. We ordered that as a beer on this rainy afternoon seemed to fit the mood. 
Each beer costs Rs. 300, do I doubt whether any one was free. I have never seen a Kingfisher worth Rs. 300.
We ordered Tikka Gulistan and Gilafi Sheekh Kebab. I have had better kebabs obviously in many places and this one did not seem anything special. One point worth mentioning in the Kebab platter was the Reshmi Kebab which was not soft at all. You really have to out some effort with your knife and fork to rip it apart.
In the main course, I tried a Chinese one, the mixed hakka Noodle. We had also ordered Butter Naan and a dish of Mutton. Again, this was average and nothing that you can drool about.
If you are looking for some quick food, you can definitely visit this place. 
If you are looking to give your taste buds a pleasure, this is definitely not the place.

The place is located in quite an accessible place in sector five and the ambience is moderate although it was extremely crowded the staffs were well trained to handle such pressure and orders were served in time and quality was ok although I found it a little dull at times mostly because of some people at the place didnt know how to act civilized.  Nevertheless i had my good.ol.buddies with me so it was all good.

Pankhuri all way.  Its nothing but sheer sin. Roasted chicken wings dripping in spicy marination. A watering hole for the IT ridden, Hing is a favourite for its young clientele. The drinks cheap. The food good. Do not expect stratospheric levels of gastro innovation, but the Pankhuri is simply mind blowing. Do visit the place on weekdays, for searching for a place to sit during weekends is an arduous task. At times impossible too. The crowd management is also dismal. All in all a nice place to hang out with pals without burning a hole in your pocket.

A word of caution to all the foodies: Please do not try out chinese at Hing. Do try out their mouth watering kebabs and indian dishes like nan,kulcha,murgh musallam etc.

Hing is this difficult-to-spot watering hole bang opposite Tata Consultancy Services Office (Eden Building) in Sector 5. It’s a ground floor bar cum restaurant, swarmed by displeased IT folks during weeknights, year round. People here will either be attending a team dinner and drinks funded by the manager, or on other weekdays, when he’s not around, bitch about him. So, as you would expect, it would get appallingly raucous at times. 

One of the natural setbacks this place has is the parking. No, am not saying that there’s not enough parking space outside. A very odd, peculiar problem of birds shitting all over your car is a normal scene here. And it’s not like a regular, couple of white spots. Trust me, it’s literally hundreds. Your car gets a whitewash in 2 hrs. flat. Hence, tip: Park it some 20-30 m away from the place on either sides,  and you are good to go. This place has a waiting area/smoking zone of around 10-12 seating capacity, so that you do not have to stand in the alley outside and can at least kill some time if the place is full.

The lighting inside is dim, well dim is an understatement. It’s almost dark in pockets with all the psychedelic Neon lighting décor attempt. . There are around 12-13 booths and it’s kind of crampy. There are a few TV screens which telecast matches/music channels and a music plays in the background, most of the times inaudible by all the talking going on. The place has a couple of ACs but given the cramped and warm setting, they have to supplement the floor with fans as well. There are graffiti, clever quirks, quotes, neon signs etc. all around. All the signs of a place screaming ‘Come, Drink, get sloshed!’. 

The staff understands you, but sometimes due to the cramped space, and mostly on busy nights, you might have to call them a couple of times , before you get to order.

The drinks are rightly priced, and most of the times, some or the other offer would be there, to promote a particular brand/company. Coming to the food, I think this place is really under-rated as far as food choices go. The menu is extensive and multicuisine and most of the items are really mouth-watering. 

The kebabs are great, so is the Bangkok Chicken Satay. The fish fingers are wonderful, while the Cheesy Meat balls are a show-stealer. Order anything from their non-veg starters, and you would not be disappointed.

Overall, this place is unpretentious; you get what you pay for, i.e. great food and drinks at a moderate price in a not-so-pretty setting in Sector 5, Salt lake. This place has huge areas of improvement, and with just some tweaking, this place could be one of the best places in Sector 5 to have some drinks with your friends.

Cheers!

3.  Various Drinks are available with discount.
4. Price is moderate.
5. Just opposite to TCS office, so mostly TCSers go there at lunch.
6. Alcohol lovers will have a lot of varieties.

Hing used to be the most preferable place for me and my colleagues during the office hours as this is located just opposite to our office premises. The food quality was good and price was reasonable. I liked the ambiance and  their serving so much even before 2/3 months back.
But now a days the food quality is no where similar. Price has been increased so much.  Also the poor serving makes me feel so horrible and disgusted that I decided not to go for Hing again in future. :(

Its been long that a eat-out has happened! Thus was the decision to grab a quick lunch here in office hours! They are ready to serve fast enough for you to have the lunch comfortably within the hour. We ordered North Indian and the food tasted quite good. You might feel that lights are on a bit lower side, but they have spots on every table and lots of extra cutlery as well in case you drop a few or don't want to mix. Overall the experience is quite pleasing!

Ambience: Good with TVs to keep you entertained.
Food: Tasted quite good. 
Service: Ready service, very fast.
Cost: Rs. 500 for two without drinks!

Visited on a Sunday afternoon...and we happened to be the only customer present at that time. We had a high expection from the different reviews we had heard and read from Zomato. But to our utter dissapointment, the starters and the noodle fared pretty average... Maybe because it was a Sunday, and as the office crowd was off, they served pretty carelessly.

Hing used to be good even an year back, but it's just unbearable and horrible these days. My colleagues had food poison after eating their food last month and I had a very bad experience as well.

They serve old fish which smells aweful and also try to tell you that these bhetkis always have such smell! They use old chickens and just toss them with a lot of sauce just to give it a juicy look. However, as you taste, you will get to know how bad it could be!

Do not try Hing even if you get an invitation there!

Hing is located just opposite TCS building in sector 5. The place is small bt the ambiance is good for hanging out with ur frnds.. the food is pretty good. We ordered a kebab platter where they served anarkali and banjara kebabs. The kebabs r decent, though not superlatively tasty..For main course we ordered nan, mutton keema and kadai chicken. The chicken was very good. Keema I have had better in other places. The best part is..this place is very cheap. Cost for 4 people:- 1300/- only.

This is really a good place if you like places with some nice hindi music along with big screens showing  football and cricket along with drinks and food.
The food quality is good along with taste and it gives one more reason to get happy as it is pocket-friendly.
The special taste of hing in their food items appears to me  interesting and unique.
The cons are it is quite congested place , slow service and less quantity of food otherwise it is a nice place to visit on lazy weekend. :)

The service was extremely poor.. Chopsuey is jus a synonym of Garbage.. Couldn't have more than two spoons. They didn't even serve water till we came to main course.. Had a really bad experience.

In Sector 5 just opposite to TCS main building is this place called HING with excellent interiors! There quirky interiors always impress me and the lighting conditions are perfect for an evening with friends over drinks n snacks...
I have been here quite a few times with friends n family. I must give the CONS first which you must know : chinese here is Pretty bad, snacks are okay but main courses suck big time. And in the weekends owing to the less crowd in sector 5 the quality drops drastically. So if you want to dine here, make sure it is a weekday n you enjoy Moghlai/Indian dishes. 
PROS: Why still a 4.0 rating , you must be wondering! It is owing to their EXCELLENT KEBABS! Banjara n Anarkali Kebabs are to die for! I always order the Tikka Gulistan which serves four kinds of kebabs and all of them lip smacking! FYI their Tandoori Roti is made out of Wheat not Flour. Their Naans be it  Keema or Lasuni, parathas n Romalis are great. Then comes their varied collection of Main dishes in awesome rich tasty gravies be it chicken/mutton/prawn/fish. Must try their Moongfali Musallam, Bhatinda bhatti and the likes. Simply will make you smile n lick your fingers. Their Fresh Lime sodas are good too.
For drink lovers they have good options of buy 1 get 1 or some rs. *** off which keeps changing. 
Desserts are good, i like their gulab jamun and gajar ka halwa.

Do Drop in at Hing---- their Kebabs are excellent !

Food is really good.I didn't try Bengali food here,so can not say about this.But Chinese, Some mughlai dishes specially kebabs are really tasty and finger licking.

Price is pocket friendly and they have plenty of option,you would not be disappointed.
Surely try their Gajar ka halua which is a bit sweet,but yummy. 

Never tried alcohol beverages here,so can't give feedback on this.

Overall,I loved this place and will suggest to have a bite here.

The waiters are also really nice n friendly with a smily face always. Drinks are available on package system with discounted price although ala-carte price is also reasonable.. Pankhuri (tandoori chicken wings) out there is my special fav with many other dishes to go along with.

Its an OK-OK restaurant during the day, a semi-sleazy bar after sun-down. You see the squalid side of the IT industry here - the stress, the despair, the tiredness, fringed with a thin line of hope, joy, and a spirit to celebrate the new-found post-globalization power to spend.That's the philosophical bit. Coming back to basics - the food here is just about average, but not as spicy/oily as you would expect. Liquor is cheap, with generous doses of 'sev bhaja' served alongside. The menu is about Indian and Chinese, and a bit of Thai (which I of course did not try). The interior is cramped up with sofas placed very close to each other with partitions! As a matter of fact, if you look closely enough, its like an extension of office cubicles.I ordered tandoori roti and yellow dal tadka - both were fresh and nice, the rotis were crisp and piping hot, the dal came with a small dash of butter. Then I ordered pan fried chilly fish - indianised, oily, saucy, with loads of onions - but not too bad to taste. Next came a corn palak (we ran out of dal and condiments). It was a little undercooked and very very green, but again not bad to taste.I had a cranberry breezer to wash all this down. It was chilled and nice, came in a nice looking flute glass.Pocket pinch is low, all of this for 650 bucks. Service is very, very good and incredibly fast! So if you happen to be in sector 5, and feel a little low, want to catch a quick drink, do visit.

This was my first visit to a bar. Honestly, I was not feeling very comfortable about visiting one, but my friends dragged me along for experience. And I must say, the experience was not at all scary. The ambience was very sober and warming. We had reached at around 9 at night and had to wait for a couple of minutes outside. We were like hungry crows in mood for some enjoyment considering it was the festive season at our college. Locating the place was a difficult one, though. It's not so on the road and a bit off-track.

Once inside, we saw a comfortable crowd there without any sort of indecency, which made me ease out. We ordered 2 pegs of White Mischief each along with Masala soda and Lime cordial, which reached us within minutes along with complementary crisp fries. That served as a good appetizer. Next we ordered the main dishes, the quantity of which was not up to the mark. The quality was quite satisfactory, though. The KEEMA POLAO was really delicious with pieces of minced meat all through the spicy rice. The JAMBALAYA rice was a bit out of the place, since it tasted more like Chinese rather than the North Indian dishes we had ordered. But by itself, it had pieces of shrimps and barbequed chicken, which were quite good to the taste buds. The side dishes comprised of Special HING CHICKEN which had a yellowish-white cashew paste gravy and of Bhatinda Bhatti which was a reddish gravy with kebabed pieces of chicken. The latter was tastier and more in line with the Keema Polao. The pieces of chicken were quite big and satisfactory in both the dishes.
The prices are quite reasonable and the waiters are also very friendly. So if you're a college student interested to visit a decent bar where you'd wanna hang out with friends, you'd definitely choose this. And considering it is situated in sector 5, a totally office area, it is very easy to find transport to return even at night....So, try it out ! Cheers ! :-)

I went there 2 yrs back and The 2 things i must mention is their really awesome food and the really courteous and attentive gentleman who served us.the decor was good.and i remember liking something going by name of achari murgh.look forward to returning there with family.

On my second visit we had lemon rice which we unfortunately did not know to be the south Indian version.so it ended up being out of sync with the rest of the items.apart from this we thoroughly enjoyed mushroom moti masala which had   malai filling within mushroom halves,the aam aada shorshe murgh and my alltime favourite anywhere canton bellpepper lemon chicken.lemon chicken as a preparation is so lightweight,easy on your health yet so delectable,I think I'm in love with it.:-p
No there is nothing mentionworthy about their decor and staff.
But I love their prices.:-))

The two primary reasons behind us being regular customers:
1. Very near to our workplace.
2. They accept Edenred coupons.

Food is decent. Specially the north Indian dishes are quite yummy. Options of varied quantities are available. I didn't like their biriyani much though.

Ambience is classy (I like the classic movie posters and catchy quotes all around) but a bit dimly illuminated. Keeping spoons and forks in transparent plastic pouches is a good idea.

Drinks are moderately priced with good variety.

Service is a tad slow but the waiters are very courteous. Also the rush is far less than the nearby legendary Opium.

Today i have visited this place with my colleagues. it may be initially a bit tough to locate, to keep it simple ask any one tcs main building(eden), just opposite of that. the inside ambience is quite ok, a bit cozy, space between the tables is very less. but i specially liked the quotes on the walls. the stuffs were very nice and helpful. and while coming to price, this place is very pocket friendly. for standard drinks and snacks, it costs arond 1800 for 4 peoples. but their service is on a slower side, which they should focus as an area of improvement.

now regarding food, we ordered chicken pankhadi and chicken bahari tangri with drinks. the foods were just awesome. rather i would recommend they should promote chicken pankhadi as their signature, must try dish. even the tangri preparation was also equally delicious. for drinks, i should say they have a good collection as the normal bars have. i am planning for another visit shortly to try other dishes. so, as a whole i would highly suggest this place to go and have quite good food in affordable price...

Hing is slowly becoming my favourite drinking joint in Salt Lake. I have visited the place four to five times and every visit has been a pleasant experience. I love the food here!!! The Chicken  Pankhuri Kabab is to die for. The 'chaknas'  are good too. I love the crispy pepper fried fish and chicken. Another must try is the Dakbangla Chicken... its awesome. Last night we tried Chicken Chopsuey and it was yummy. The best part which i liked is that they served the noodles and the gravy separately. I like eating hard noodles when having chopsuey so this is the best way to serve such a dish where i have the choice of taking the gravy as and when required. The service is prompt and the staff courteous. The pricing is also reasonable. So all in all Hing is a place to hang around if you want to spend time with friends over a drink and also savour some good food.

Slow service, pathetic food, dimly lit ambiance - that's what today's Hing is all about. Once upon a time, say 2 years back, this used to be one of my favs in Sector 5 area. Their gradual deterioration has literally shocked me. They have revamped the decor for worse, now the place looks more like a pub. The food quality has gone worse over a couple of months and most of the items are unavailable. Here's what we had:

Prawn starter (cant remember exact name) - very spicy
Mutton Seeskh kabab - dunno whether it was mutton or soyabean
Keema Polao - very dry
Chicken Polao - ok
Bhuna Banjara - mutton pieces were too stiff to digest
Fresh Lime Soda - good
Moroke Icecream - my personal fav
Fruit Cocktail with Icecream - fruits were not fresh

Dunno about others but I am not coming back anytime soon :(

Right infront of TCS and at the heart of the office area HIng suprises you with its prices and quality. Good seating and service for this not very well known place and its great lighting will impress you on entry itself. The menu is full fledge and the bar is very well stocked. The prices are great and the location is it unique selling point. Post work in sector 5 Hing is a good option, and maybe during work as well.

Hing is one of the less popular watering holes, located right in front of the TCS main building beside Webel Bhawan. Due to its off track location secluded from the main strip of Sector 5, this place is very popular within the TCS guys. Usually we head to Opium for a drink post office but one of my colleagues suggested that we should try out Hing.

Its not a very big place but the space is well utilized with around 10-12 tables which can accommodate approximately 40 pax. 
I personally like the ambiance which is dimly lit and quirky posters all around. There are 3 large LCD televisions very strategically positioned so that it is comfortably view-able from all angles. I must also mention the hygiene measures taken up by this restaurant.  All the spoons and forks are presented on the table neatly wrapped inside transparent cellophane pouches.

Food and drinks: Though I have heard from a couple of my colleagues that the food is decent, but I would say that it is below average. People come here to have a few drinks, enjoy sports on TV and leave. I would easily rate them 4 but I had to deduct .5 for obvious reasons. There are very few selective dishes which taste good here, while others just dont hit the spot. 
Alcohol pricing is reasonable and they have special packages for alcohol at discounted rates. Also there is a 10% discount on alcohol bills of Rs750+. 
Though Hing is not as famous as Opium, I have experienced a full house even on a Tuesday evening, may be because of the  IPL matches. 
I have tried quite a number of food items here. The Spanish omelette is  pretty good with decent stuffing of cheese and chicken but the mustard sauce is over used which overpowers the original flavour and tastes pretty much desi ! 
I have sampled their chicken hariyali kebab which is just average. On another occasion we tried out their Chinese fare. We ordered dry chili chicken, crispy chili babycorn for starters along with beers. I must say that the quality of peanuts served along with drinks is very impressive. Also the Chanachur mixture is good to taste. 
Sadly they use sliced pieces of chicken for chili chicken and the corn flour coating is 3 times that of the slice of the chicken and the coating is also very chewy. Total let down. Next up was the baby corn which was not magnificent but tasted okay with the drinks. We complained about the chili chicken being a disaster but their reply was that they use chicken slices instead of diced chicken pieces. Therefore we asked the waiter to suggest chinese chicken item which would have less of coating and more of chicken, preferably diced ones. The waiter suggested Hong Kong style Bar b q chicken along with chicken noodles (hakka) and chicken fried rice. 
Finally when the food arrived, the chicken preparation looked promising and indeed it was much better than the chili chicken. The rice was very very average however the noodles were just fine. Quantity of the main course was good enough and the 4 of us happily shared the dishes which very much filled our tummies after consuming the chilled beers. 
Service was quick and the waiters were very polite. 
As I mentioned drinks are priced well. Beers cost around Rs 150-Rs180. Premium whisky like signature/BP is priced around Rs 140. The discount offer as mentioned on the menu is a bit misleading. As per the menu card alcohol if billed over Rs750 , we would be offered a discount of 10%. But once our bill arrived, we were told that we will be offered a discount of 10% both on food and drinks provided we pay by cash, otherwise it will be only 5% on drinks. This was quite annoying however we dint complain as we were pretty happy with their service and drinks. My suggestion is that one should come here only for enjoying drinks as food is not impressive here. 
The toilet should be refurbished as well since it is dirty and smelly. Apart from all this Hing is a great place to hang out for a few drinks. Cost for two including drinks should be around Rs 1000

Hing.... A restaurant whose standards are going down the drain. Last day wr ordered -
1. Gravy chowmein (in some fancy name)
2. Mixed Fried Rice
3. Kung Pao Chicken.
Both the main dishes has ample chicken, prawn etc but largely lacked any taste. N the most horrible part was the Kung Pao Chicken tjhat tasted like some Indian Gravy Item cooked in cashew base. It seems their cook has changed and they are serving just anything under the sun.
The rule of inserting PIN No while swiping Debit Cards is applicable for around 1 year now, they are still using back dated Swiping Machines and expect their customers to walk up to the cash counter for inserting PIN. U being a Bank employee know it very well, against payment of a very nominal fee, the old machines can be replaced with cordless machines. But these people expect their customers to walk up to the cash counter.
This restaurant has deteriorated in all spheres and doesnt deserve anything more than 1.5, but 1 mark is added for the sake of good food they served till few months back. My previous review on this restaurant is also appended below to understand the difference. If the management of this restaurant cares about customer satisfaction, its high time they wake up from the hiberbation on else Hing shall be positioned as a bar and not a restaurant anymore.
...........................................................
We are regular with Hing since its inception. The Indian and Bengali dishes served here are really good. In spite of being a bar with young crowd, the ambience is really good and most importantly, the service is awesome.
Now let me put down the dishes we found best at this restaurant; -

1. Unani Murg- Hing Spl Chicken Tandoori that's marinated in some spl spices n herbs. When it is served, it sizzles. It one of the best adaptation of Chicken Tandoori that tickles my taste bud.

2. Aam Aada Shorshe Bhetki- You can call it their signature dish that offers a distinct flavor of "aam aada" a typical bengali spice. The flavor gels very well with Shorshe and I bet this delicacy shall make you visit Hing in regular intervals.

Dum Mutton Biryani- This is not availbale everyday but if you are lucky enough to get it, your day is made. On an oilier side, this Biryani has that authentic Kolkata style taste for which you shall die for

Only one -ve point for this restaurant is the price that is on a higher side.

Enjoy your Unani Murg, Dum Mutton Biryani and Aam Aada Shorshe Bhetki.

I have been haunting this place recently and am quite impressed with their menu. By way of suggestion I would like to say, since they have quite an elaborate menu, they should add some variants of fish apart from only bhetki, they might think of including biryani in the menu and some more dessert items. On the good side, I like that they have options of varying portions.

As far as taste is concerned of the food I have tasted so far the only disappointments were cheese naan: no one puts ketchup on naan!!! hing chicken: apart from the fact that I did not smell any asafetida in it even when it was mentioned among the ingredients, it tasted real bad with lots of turmeric. the other veg or non-veg items were delicious and the waiters were also well mannered. 

One major scope for improvement is the basic appearance of the place. Busted sofa seats and a dirty toilet degrades the place to any roadside restaurant near the station or something.

3.4? What have people been smoking?

I have only lived in Calcutta for less than two years, but eat out more often than I ought to. And while I may come across a more delightful restaurant (all things considered - with value-for-money right at the top) in the future, there is no doubt that Hing is my number one favourite place to eat in the city. Right now, if a distantly located friend were to pay me a visit, I know where I'd take them out for lunch!

The Baby Corn, any Paneer subzi, Cheese Naan. Lip-smacking. Every bit, every dish. Every dish I've had on four visits anyway. I have never had any of my non-vegetarian friends complain either. And if people were to start killing each other over food, the Chocolate Brownie here would be a major cause. The menu may be called a book - what else do you call one that is 26 pages long, really?

The ambiance - the blue lights, the lanterns, the writings in Bengali, et al - may not be described as anything short of splendid. If you wish to enjoy this view, make it a point to sit on the left side of the restaurant. The service is not top-notch (but certainly above average); some waiters may in fact speak (or at least respond to you) only in Bengali, but who cares when you have all of the aforementioned? I know I don't.

Went there yesterday, a usual Friday night, thought of getting some drinks. Must say, I was not expecting a lot out of this place, but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise! We had called to make reservations and the guy was very courteous and told us that he would give us a call as soon as he could get a table for us (which he did). We went inside and ordered us a couple of drinks. The waiters were quite polite as we took our time to order. The service is pretty quick. We had ordered reshmi kebab and tandoori chicken (which was served on a hot plate just like a sizzler!).  The food and alcohol is well priced (read cheap) and the ambiance is of a regular watering hole. Overall, I liked this place and would recommend it if you are looking for a place to hang out with friends in sector 5 after a long day of work!

Dont expect a fine dining experience here, but still you will be amazed to see a more-than-decent restaurant serving a wide variety of menu. Try the normal tikka or reshmi kebabs, its good. The alcohol pricing is good. A few months ago they started alcohol packages, wherein if you order 3 bottles of beer, or 3 pegs of whiskey, you get a decent discount. The interior is good and seating arrangement in couch is good. Check out the quotation pages in menu card, its awesome!

Pros:
Nice ambience, good background music.
Near to the IT complex.
Affordable price.
Caters to both north indain and Bengali cuisines.

Fridays are a bit crowdy,predominantly filled with techie and college crowd.
About food, we ordered naan, dal makhani, chicken makhani and chicken dakbanglo. The naan was soft, daal makhani was also good, the chicken makhani was so so, I really liked the chicken dakbanglo, the garnishing was really tempting. 
A perfect place for hanging out with friends.

This is a second office canteen for the TCS employees. Foodd is nothing exceptional but not bad either as compared to the price they are charging for it, but I would like to mention a special dish.. 5 SPICED CHICKEN DRUM available in 2, 4 or 6 pieces. its absolutely delicious. Its my favourite at HING. Other than this, one day I had I had ordered rice chow that is mei foon, but instead I got a mixture of rice and chow that was astonishing for me as I didn't expect that as I never received this in any other restaurant in kolkata. :P . It is good for a quick lunch or dinner while in office hours but other than that with somebody special, it's not such an exquisite place to visit to. The waiters here are quite good and the service is also quick and the bill amount is not so high as compared to the food that I had and thus it's a place where we can visit quite often to have a quick lunch dinner understand ac to cool off. I would like to mention specially that there are three televisions in this restaurant but none of them are in sync and the music is not in sync with either of these. Thus its a funny place to be in just for enjoyment.

visited this place today after watching a mvie at adlabs we were a group of 4. It was already 5p.m. and we were the only customers in there  so i cannot judge the service properly as they had ample tym to serve us. coming on the food we directly ordered main course paneer tikka in tomato based gravy,daal makhani,shahi malai kofta, masala kulcha,tanduri roti ,naan.
paneer was good bt the rest were average
bt spcl mention the kulchas were nt actually masala kulchas they just had mashed potatos and onion as stufing didnt liked it at all and the naan was very hard to chew. tandoori roti was best very soft.
bt the main surprise came when the bill arived. only 730. man its very reasonable.
