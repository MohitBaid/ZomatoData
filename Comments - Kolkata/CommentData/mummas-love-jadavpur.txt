Recently I ordered cupcakes and some salty for my house party. The cupcakes far better than what we get in the so called renowned cake shops in Kolkata....in respect of the price and taste and size as well.

Not only do you get yummy mouthwatering cakes and cookies but also for the health freaks their whole wheat muffins and multigrain products prove to be a blessing. These are both healthy and tasty. Light and fluffy you won't be able to distinguish the goodness of taste from the regular cakes, cookies and muffins.

Would suggest that you try out their chocolate ganache cakes or cupcakes. It is a sinful indulgence. A chocolate over load yet light and fluffy. For the health conscious their whole wheat breakfast muffins are a must try.

Their cakes are soft, lovely and moist. The fresh fruit cake are cup cakes are worth a try. The sunflower bread is my favourite in savories.
