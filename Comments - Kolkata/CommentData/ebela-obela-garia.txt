If there was negative I would have given that.
First , I waited for more than an hour to get the food
2nd, inspite of me specifying that they should get Rs 500/- change, they didn't. So that wasted 20 more minutes of my time. And the person who came to deliver the food, didn't have the decency to come up to my floor and personally hand me over the change. He sent it via my security guard.

3rd, when I finally sat down to eat my dinner at 11 pm, I see that there was a dead ant inside my polao.

Disappointed is an understatement. I'm shocked to see such service and such mediocre quality food being served. 

On seeing the review the restaurant sent the order again free of cost on feeling apologetic for the substandard quality food. 
However, I can't still give a good review because the chicken contained a strand of hair. My advice to the restaurant management is to improve the hygiene under which food is cooked and then send out food to people. 
Also, to refrain from lying blatantly about a customer.

First of all Huge congrats to team Ebala Obela & Suresh ! ! So good to see that they're doing really well !!

So, After all these months I've finally ordered lunch from here.
•Luchi Aloo Dum Combo - Luchi is different , Well prepared & the gravy is smooth , Almost closed to perfection.

•Dhakai Special Egg Korma - Well, this is a turn off for me , Couldn't finished the dish.

•Basanti Pulao & Chicken Kasha Combo - Another wonderful dish - Chicken Kasha is good & It's goes well with the basanti Pulao .

Chaler guro diye khirer patishapta - The flavour of kheer is not so strong & the layer should be little crispy, but it's not . The patishapta should be prepared differently for getting that actual taste .

Food is quite good , Packing is properly done - Delivery reached almost within the time , It's a 3.5 experience & .5 for the extraordinary effort . 
Cheers !

First time I had biriyani made of gobindo bhog rice and I was pleasantly surprised, that's how good it tasted. Only grouse here is that the chicken pieces were a bit reddish on the inside. Otherwise, it was excellent. You get two eggs with each plate of Dhakai special biriyani, another speciality. 

Saving the best for the last, was offered a plate full of patishappta for free. A nice touch from the Ebela Obela team.

My Order.
1 chicken steamed momo
1 paratha
1 mutton biryani with extra egg
1 chicken kasha

I dont know how they term this as Biryani.Please change the name of it to Onion Flavoured Pulao.I have had tasted Dhakai Traditional Biryani for quite a few times.My relatives stay there and i have visited them thrice,thus i know how traditional Dhaka style biryani tastes.The way Dhakai Biryani is made is almost called Kachchi Biryani.But the masala and the fragrance you people used,it seamed a pulao.To be specific,a flavoured steamed rice.Even the Potato didnt tasted well.I am really sorry to say,but the biryani that you guys delivered was not at all acceptable as a Biryani.My brother's birthday got ruined.
But wait.
The Chicken Kasha was fabulous though.Totally home made,standard chicken botis and such mindblowing gravy.The payesh that they sent as a complimentary was also great,kudos to you guys for such kind gestures.Momos were average.Paratha was also average.
Delivery experience was satisfactory and Smooth.
So in short,its a mixed experience and would like to order again for that "Homely Chicken Kasha".

Recently have ordered some lunch from here.
1. Basanti pulao and chicken kasha - the quantity of pulao was pretty decent but chicken was not that satisfactory consisted of two small pieces and a half potato piece. much oily.
2. Egg thali - Consisted of plain rice (pretty good amount), aloo bhaja (potato fry), dal (mung), vegetable of the day (cabbage), egg curry (2 eggs and a half potato), chutney (tomato and dates), rosh bora (2 pieces) accompanied by green chili and onion piece.
3. Nolen gurer payesh - 500ml. 
 The tastes of egg curry and chicken kasha was almost similar, not bad but contained plenty of oil. Other stuffs were simple and good.
The bill was pocket friendly and delivery was in time.

And last but not the least Dhakai Spl. Biryani was pathetic I'm sure they prepared the so called Spl. Biryani with Fried rice mixed with biryani masala, if you don't believe order once. Thumbs up for sending a complimentary sweet dish.

This restaurant should get totally bipolar reviews for two of it's most important parameter.
1. Food Quality is great. Ordered Chicken Kasha and paratha combo. The quantity was satisfactory. Food tasted really good.
2. Delivery is complete crap. Ordered through Zomato, which promised 60 mins delivery time earlier and they took 1 and half hour to deliver the food. The restaurant sent the delivery guy with no changes (not even 10, 5 rupees notes or coins), I had to go out to make changes of my Rs.50 note by myself, even though I ordered through cash on delivery. A complete irresponsible behavior from a restaurant which serves through "delivery only policy". Make it better, please. Would defo want to order again if delivery improves.

I ordered a very simple dish. Just a chicken biriyani. It took them 1 hour and 20 minutes to deliver the same. Anyway that was okay. The moment I saw the texture of the dish I felt disgusted. It seemed Biriyani in no way. And let's not talk about the taste. It tasted awful. Right away aweful. It tasted somewhat near to "muri ghonto" just replacing "maccher matha" with chicken. This is the worst Biriyani I ever had until now. And not to forget it was so much soaked in oil. This was my first order from this eatery,and I am thoroughly disappointed. I look forward never to order from here again.

Well, I consider myself lucky as one fine morning I discovered them in Zomato. Honestly didn't have much expectations from them, I thought yet another pop up restaurant. But when the food arrived.... I was like, awwww....what's this!! what a compact packaging! What a prompt delivery by the owner himself.
Honestly I thought food will be okayish type. But picture actually baki tha mere dost :)
they serve a very good quality of home cooked food, as they say, "ma kakimar haate ranna kora."
I ordered 2 veg thali, 1 dhakai chicken biryani. Veg thali was more than enough for 1 person. Every little item was so tasty, be it chutni, be it even paayesh!
Dhakai biryani was also another "must have" item from them, they use gobindobhog rice for biryani, taste was actually different from our well-known Kolkata Biryani. Cook is actually from Faridpur, Bangladesh.

It's a take away. Have you ever heard of a place giving more items in a thali than already in menu? Well, this place does. We ordered for 2 plates of Paratha with Chicken Thali and one Veg Thali. Price is damn cheap and hence were a little concerned about the quality of food but it was good. U can order lunch from here on everyday basis. They gave Kheer though it was not in the description of Veg Thali. Yummy! Good food. Happy Tummy. Good Packaging. Tastes exactly like home cooked. Yay!

1st impression very good behaviour. 
Food is exactly what you call a home made delicious food. Ordered veg thali, everything was very good in taste, quantity was more than enough , packaging was very neat.

One quick suggestion - the amount of oil in the curries could be lessened.

Loved the first service. Looking forward to more good  services. Maintain the same standard.

Highly recommended.

I ordered for two chicken biryani. It was delivered before time. The food was delivered by a young person whose behaviour was very good. I was impressed with the food quality. The biryani was prepared by govindabhog rice. The room was filled with aroma once the can is opened. The biryani was light and taste was beautiful and different. I shall tell the food lovers to taste this authentic Bangladeshi biryani once. Rating 5 out of 5

I ordered for a home delivery of veg thali, porotha with chicken and chicken biryani.

Veg thali:::
Bhaat- the amount is for two persons. Well cooked.
Begun bhaja- these were soft and tender, neither overfried or underfried.
Dal- lightly cooked. Good in taste.
Veg of the day- it was mixed veg. Not rich with masalas. Delicious.
Paneer- this was well cooked. Good for people who don't like rich food.
Chaatney- sweet chaatney. Well cooked.
Paayesh- chaaler payesh. Wonderfully made. Was delicious.
Over all the amount and quality is too much for the price. The meal could be ordered for regular meals.

Porotha and chicken kasa- the porothas were freshly cooked and served warm considering the home delivery. They were crispy outside and soft within. Three in numbers. The chicken kasa had three pieces of chicken. It was very well cooked. And was awesome.

Chicken biryani- it was light. It had a chicken leg, egg and potato. The rice was well cooked. And aroma was good and not the pungent smell wxhich is usually found in most of the biryanis served at the other eateries.

All these at 354/-.
Well it's pretty cheap. And the quantity and quality is very good.

Have ordered food from this restaurant this Sunday. Below are my experience;
Delivery time- They have delivered approx 10/12 minutes before seheduled delivery time.
Food quality- Food quality is really good like home cooked and testy. Though food was bit oily, the type of food I have ordered usualy comes with oil.
Food variety- I have ordered through Zomato, where I did not find too many options of food mostly on veg side. Would request this food outlet to provide more food option.
Cost- Food price is very reasonable.

They are a small joint located near Garia and they operate on the basis of home delivery only. 
I came to know about this place from a friend. 
I would definitely refer this to every person staying alone and struggling with their food options as maximum home delivery people serve you bad quality food. 

But food from Ebela Obela is clean and hygienically made. It even tastes good. I'm a non-bengali vegetarian who loves their Bengali food, which means that they do serve well. 

I'm a big fan of their Doi Potol, Pulao, Paneer, Moong Dal, Fuulkopi Posto, Tadka. 

It's affordable and delicious.
