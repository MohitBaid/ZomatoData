Quality of food is very good, environment of the restaurant is very peaceful,they will charge you extra 10% for using ac.It is just opposite of the Siddheswari Market. I have ordered chicken hariyali Kabab,Mix fried rice and Hongkong chicken,Masala Kulcha.Very reasonable price with well maintained quality.Best in Beleghata still now.

Good food. Great ambience . Easily visible from main road. The chicken tandoor and chicken lollipop is mouthwatering and the service is more or less fast. Hope that it will flourish and also it will improve itself. Sitting available. Cards are accepted along with cash.No paytm or any other mode of payment is accepted
