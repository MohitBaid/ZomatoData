The ambience, the decor is just beyond words. Just located in the road opposite of Quest mall, this place has a huge attraction for college students and most hookah lovers...The only difficulty being that it doesn‚Äôt serve non-vegetarian food which is really difficult for meat lovers...

This is the best "luxurious" restaurant in the ciry for Vegetarians or Vegans. It is a purely vegetarian restaurant and some of the dishes can be customised to Jain food too. It has the biggest variety of vegetarian delights from all parts of the world.
This place has a dining section as well as a lounge. The lounge is for luxury. We went to the restaurant.
What we ordered:
Cheese Stuffed Mushroom
Tofu and Mushroom in Hunan Sauce
And plain Naan
The pocket pinch for the first two dishes were around Rs. 300. The total bill for two was Rs. 800. The quantity was quite good. So was the taste. The cheese stuffed mushroom was so delicious that I feel like going back for it. The Nan was a bit hard, but okay. 
Staff was quite courteous. 
The ambience is very calm. The place is well decorated. Comfortable seating. 
A must try out for even non vegetarians because their vegetarian dishes are super yummy. It's located darn opposite to Quest Mall and is easy to locate. So do not miss this out if you are in the Park Circus area and are looking for some new kinda food, different from the same old Biryani.

I went there on 1st January with my wife, I have already heard a lot about this place so I went there. This is extremely a good place and hookah was fabulous, food quality is also perfect. Staff were well mannered and well behaved, service was also quick. So overall this is a good place to visit if you are a hookah lover.

The vallet parking is a good advantage to have on the busy road, which is opposite of Quest, with almost no parking place to find on rush days.
 The staff was very good and humble, they welcome you with warmth and provide service which is values worth. 
Having options for dining style is another advantage. Having games would be another advantage as one would like to spent more time with friends and family while waiting for food. 
The Food is amazing and upto the mark with Ganpati's ultimate kitchen. The hookah was really good and they offer a complimentary coal change...as well. 
Nice place to visit, will be visiting more often.

It is situated on the opposite foot of quest mall and was easy to find. Valet parking made life a lot easier. The decor was really good and one of the best in Kolkata. We ordered "Jai and Veeru" which tasted really nice. The mocktail was very good and refreshing. We also ordered a dal makhni and a tawa subz. Both were delicious. The breads were also good. The working staff were gentle and caring. The service was very fast. Overall it was a very good experience. But as we know there is always a room for improvement.The only thing I want them to improve is there quantity.

Visited this restaurant after time and to my surprise found it to be two floored with separate menus and dishes from first floor were not allowed on ground floor. The famous Khow suey , burger and alcohol is served on first floor whereas ground floor is fine dining.
We had ordered manchow soup, tom yam soup, mushroom soup, spring roll, paneer tikka, malai kofta, mix veg, kaali daal, cheese naan and garlic naan. Each item were tasty but quantity was surprisingly less.
I didn‚Äôt find restaurant in ground floor to be worth the long waiting queue.

I visited the place on 27th. The lounge is too beautiful for words. The place is well lit and it has a regal aura about it.
The menu is pure vegetarian. And a perfect place to hangout with your special one or your besties. The attendants are very cordial and they happily obliged when I asked one of them to take a picture of mine. We were seated in a beautiful swing. And everything about this place is picturesque.
Now coming to the menu. We had ordered Peri Peri fries, Mexican rolls and paprika pizza. They are actually very generous in their offerings and I was actually surprised as the quantity of fries was huge. HUGE. They don't come better than this. The Mexican rolls were also good. The cheese melted in our mouth. However, the pizza was slightly below the mark as the bread was thin and kinda felt like a biscuit. Hence, I am rating it 4.0 as there is a room for improvement.

Overall, an awesome place with awesome people managing it. All the best.

I had chosen this place for my birthday after listening a lot from people about the food that this place offers. But to my disappointment it was not that great as I had thought it to be. The dec√≥r and ambience is definitely one of the best. But the food is nothing extraordinary.
We had ordered
Kebabs- It was so soft that it kept breaking and we weren't able to eat it.
Cheese balls - This one was decent.
Kit Kat Shake - This was okay too.
Brownie Shake - This shake was yummy. Although the pastries given with both of these shakes were tasteless.
For the main course I had ordered.
Mix sauce pasta- This was not good at all.
Dal Makhani - It was lip smacking but the quantity could have been better.
Paneer butter masala - This was nice too.
Naan- It was like any other place.
However the staff was very helpful and courteous.

Mint hookah was good according to my friends (I don't know because I don't take hookah),but KitKat shake, black forest ice cream and chocolate and cream mousse all were good. We all love the place very much.

Noodles was good but paneer tikka and pizza was pathetic. Hookah was choking continously they tried to fix it but it didn't work out.

Ordered a cheese stuffed mushroom, which was okayish. The baked gulab jamun with the rose caviar was quite exquisite. However, your taste buds will not be satisfied with the little portion they serve. The decor is different but it hardly helps when the food doesn't match up to your expectations.

This restaurant cum lounge is located right opposite to quest mall. They serve pure vegetarian food. The interior decoration is amazing. I tried their mini meal(mere boss ka favorite), four cheese pizza and tunde kebab.. the mini meal was super yummy.. and so was the pizza.. but the kebab was way to salty. They are not good as starter. It was better if they served the kebabs with paratha as a main course item.

It was a long due "cousins-meet" since all of us are in different cities for work/studies. We wanted to try a new place and since none of us had been to Nawwarah and had heard good reviews about it, we decided to give it a try.
We went on a weekday, so there weren't many people.
The drinks were good.
For starters we ordered
-Corn Tulips was amazing
-Jay aur Veeru was a combination of paneer tikka and tandoori aloo was not all that great.

Then we ordered lasagne which was absolutely delicious.

The main course was usual-dal makhani and the sorts. However, the taste was good.

Overall, the quality and quantity of food is üëç.

A vegetarian fine dine and lounge, one of it's kind! Visited about a month back was amazed with the decor, each and every corner has the same vintage rhythm reflecting a rich choice of the owner.
Love the arrangements, me and my friends we sat on the lounge that's the second floor where they serve sheesha(guess what coal change is not chargeable) and they have vintage swings for seating. The flavors were really nice, we had mocktails that day which are sweet 16, atomic cat and a blueberry based mocktail along with carsar salad. Needless to say taste was perfect along with service, this kind of service is really appreciated also much needed in the city of joy. Loved my entire experience and definitely going back for more, though I'm a non vegetarian but food at nawwarah is above all discremenation.

Was wanting to visit this place since a long tym as I had heard grt things abt this place although I didn't find it as grt. The place is definitely beautiful, the jhula was an additional attraction as most of us love to sit and chill in d jhulas while we savour d food. Few things one might wanna know before they visit the place are - one has to pay cover charges of 300 per person which would b adjusted towards d Bill at d end. We were 3 ppl and our bill amounted to rs 700 so we had to order a dessert as d cover charges are not refundable. Another really bad offer I would say is the one on one offer. Since we were just 3 we ordered caramelised fries and a pizza. The fries were quite tasty but d quantity was so huge and on top of that we got two plates that it became impossible to think we could even take a bite of d pizza. Had to leave more than one plate of fries and that too could not b packed for take away as they don't allow it. Coming to d pizza we had ordered a four cheese pizza, it may b my mistake but I had expected basic veggies on d pizza but d pizza was literally just four cheese pizza with absolutely no veggies. Didn't taste good to me. We had ordered a chilli guava drink which was pretty good. D offer didn't allow us to order anything mch. In fact just d fries would have done it. At d end as we had no option but to order a dessert we ordered a milky way the presentation of which grt but again it didn't taste well. There were pieces of brownies and whipped cream, half a macron I would say and coconut crumbs. Taste could have been a lot better of this particular dessert. Overall I would say d place is overrated and they really need to work on their schemes since most ppl like us came in small groups and would not b able to try anything mch with such schemes

Now this my friends is what you call an absolutely unexpected treat from the starting to the ending‚Ä¶ I never expected a caterer to open a place which can serve food to this standard‚Ä¶ we sat in the hookah place on the second floor and I was surprised with the seating arrangement‚Ä¶ it s was not a packed seating but a laid back casual and relaxing seating where you can go and have a chat without the other table breathing down your neck‚Ä¶¬†
the best part of the whole thing is that they have valet parking... and the location that they are based on this kwas the best decision they could have taken
coming to the food‚Ä¶ every dish which we ordered was just amazing‚Ä¶ from the mushroom cappuccino to the starters of the kebab platter‚Ä¶ we were having a field day‚Ä¶ the service though slow is polite and courteous and the best part is that they know the menu and what they are serving‚Ä¶ that made it even a more memorable experience‚Ä¶ 

In the main course we had a dal and roti platter and a risotto‚Ä¶. Both of them were a class apart‚Ä¶ I was very skeptical of ordering 2 cuisines but could not resist myself and I was surprised that they have mastered both cuisines so well‚Ä¶

This place is a must visit for anyone looking to have a wonderful food experience and my respect for making me have such a great time‚Ä¶.

Nawwarah is definitely the best pure veg restaurant in Calcutta. After much planning, I gave this place a visit yesterday for lunch with my friends. The restaurant is divided into two sections. The family dining section looks classy and elegant while the lounge, which is mostly for hookah, looks vibrant and colourful. One must visit the lounge to see how beautiful the place is. 

| Drinks |

‚Ä¢ Caramel Milkshake - This was served on a wooden tray with a piece of cake and chocolate sauce. The shake was consistent and perfectly sweet. It was good in quantity. 

‚Ä¢ Virgin Mojito - The mojito was fizzy and very refreshing. It was a perfect accompaniment with the food. 

| Starters |

‚Ä¢ Corn Salt and Pepper - Corn was fried with bell peppers, spring onions and chillies. The corn was very crispy and well fried. 

‚Ä¢ Sauteed Mushroom - The mushrooms were juicy and succulent. They were slightly spicy, but were very pleasing to the taste buds. 

| Main Course |

‚Ä¢ Bell Pepper Ani Besar - This was a good preparation of bell peppers. The bell peppers were well cooked and tasted great. 

‚Ä¢ Shyam Savera Kofta - This is a curry of spinach and cottage cheese dumplings. It was sweet and went well with the breads. 

‚Ä¢ Dal Makhani - The dal was thick and creamy. It had a beautiful flavour. 

‚Ä¢ Special Bread Basket - The basket included different varieties of naan and parathas. I completely fell in love with the cheese naan. 

| Dessert |

‚Ä¢ Macaroon Platter - The plate looked very beautiful. It included macaroons of four flavours - Raspberry, Chocolate, Lime and Pistachio, all of which tasted wonderful.

Overall, I had an an amazing experience at Nawwarah. Being a non vegetarian, I enjoyed my lunch at this pure veg restaurant. Also, the service by Debashis and Soumen was excellent. I'm definitely coming back soon. üòç

Perfect place one of a kind i gues soo far in kolkata where you get the best taste of Indian food with the punch of hookah and a variety of amazing deserts and alchol* on weekends.
There is no comparison of the quality and taste of food here. Its mouth watering wanderlust.
The hookah here is perfect.
The service staffs are active and quick in response and very good in interacting.
The ambience is unique. 
But there is one flaws in the sitting area for a group having more people the tables become too short to fit in all the thngs you order but thats not much of a concern. 
Overall if you love food and you love hookah you can close your eyes and trust the place for it.

Shisha - As it known for the most amazing shisha experiences in the city.

Service - Special credits to the staffs especially Debashish and Soumen who made our experiences pretty worth it.

Decor is something just excellent. I never could have believed that Vegetarian food could be so delicious. It's an absolute treat to be here! A true nawab experience. It houses both lounge and restaurant.  
BEVERAGES:

Virgin Mojito: Its a great summer drink. The sweet taste accompanied by fragrance of Mint and addition of tangy lime makes for a really refreshing drink.

STARTERS:
Corn salt and pepper: Crispy corn Chilly pepper just wow in one word. I really like the taste of it. (Recommended)

Saut√©ed mushrooms: This is a really flavourful dish. The saut√©ed mushrooms tasted great. (Recommended)

MAINS:
Bell pepper ani besar
Baingan bharta (Recommended)
Dal makhni 
Nawwarah special bread basket: The basket consists of cheese nan, masala kulchas, roti and laccha parathas. 

DESSERTS 
Raspberry ice cream: Raspberry is my favourite flavour. The ice cream melted to a perfect flavour.

An awesome experience altogether. Excellent vegetarian food. Top-notch ambience. Friendly and courteous staff. 
A wonderful place to dine in. Highly Recommend :)

The arabic term ' Nawaarah ' means brilliant and the place actually lives up to its expectations... I visited this places with a group of friends and as soon as we set our foot inside we were totally in awe...such grand interiors...olden walls , chandelier, sea green velvety chairs made us feel no less than a kings palace..
Now coming to the food...
Strawberry milkshake (smooth frothy milk shake with a tiny cheesecake)and watermelon mojito as coolers..
Staters were great.. we ordered hot and spicy tofu( it imparted an amazing flavour and a must try) and bruschettas (crisp and rich)
For the main course we settled with some good Tehri pulao ( a brilliant rice tossed with vegetables and dry fruits and is highly recommended.) and kogta sham sabera ( delicate spinach based cottage cheese koftas in sweet aromatic white gravy ) and dum alu and a bread basket..
And though we had no place for desserts yet we tried the macaroon platter which was simply over the top..and when you are aware that the place has an amazing collection of @desserts you will definitely not want to leave without having them.. right????
Last but not the least.. on a special note I would like to personally thank Debashis and Soumen since their prompt service and good behaviour left a mark...

This place in the heart of Kolkata won my heart.
As you enter this place you‚Äôll be quite impressed with the modern yet traditional interiors.
Starting with the food
-Ordered for a strawberry milkshake. Very well presented and tasted better than it looked.
-Moving on with the starters ordered a bruschetta with watermelon mojito.
-Bruschetta had a really good filling of mushrooms and veggies.
-Watermelon mojito was a good try . Light yet so refreshing.
For main course :
Kofta shyam savera was really good to taste at.
Dum Aloo was one lip smacking dish.
Vegetable thehri pulao was the best pulao I‚Äôve tasted in recent time. The rice was soft and was well flavoured.
Raspberry/ Madagascar was just the perfect dessert.
With that caramel crunch it melted right in the mouth.

This place can be described in one single word :  MAJESTIC .

As soon as you enter the restaurant part you see beautiful chandeliers and decorated textured walls that add to the royal touch this place has . 

Coming to the reason we friends were there was FOOD obviously . We ordered a lot of food and the review might get too ling but I am helpless , because you know what ? I have to mention everything - Each item was fantastic . 

‚ö´Ô∏èCaramel Milkshake - Very Delicious and consistent . A perfect way to start things off .

‚ö´Ô∏èVirgin Mojito - Refreshing and the perfect cooler when you are combatting the heat outside . 

‚ö´Ô∏èCorn Salt N Pepper - This again was amazing . The perfect blend . 

‚ö´Ô∏èHot N Spicy Tofu - This was very spicy tasted so good . Loved the sauce in which they prepared this . 

‚ö´Ô∏è Bruschetta - The best I have ever had . You have to try this when you are at Nawwarah 

‚ö´Ô∏èKofta Shyam Savera - These Koftas made of unripened curd cheese in a red alluring thick tomato gravy was lipsmacking . Tasted amazing with the Cheese Naan . 

‚ö´Ô∏èDum Aloo - I don't prefer having Potato dishes in a restaurant . But they suggested this , so we tried this out . To my amazement , this turned out to be very good . Tasted best with Masala Kulcha . 

‚ö´Ô∏è Nawwarah Special Bread Basket - It consisted of all different breads . The Kulchas , Naan and Lachha Parathas were all very good . 

‚ö´Ô∏è Vegetable Tehri Pulao - This again was the best Pulao I have had . The essence itself was enough and then the taste was incredible . 

‚ö´Ô∏èMacaroon Platter - Lime , Strawberry , Chocolate Macaroons üòçüòçüòç . Can't get better . Most Recommended .  

After the heavy lunch we wanted to relax and smoke away a Hookah so we went to their Lounge area and had a Paan flavoured Hookah which again was great . 

Also not to forget , Debashish and Soumen were the two staffs that served us . Both of them were very prompt and attended us very well . Full points on service . 

Don't think . Visit Nawwarah .

Nawwarah is located opposite quest mall, which has both restaurant and lounge!!
The beautiful interiors and the envirmonet goes perfect with the mouth watering food..
I had tried caramel milkshake , virgin mojito , corn salt & pepper , sauteed mushroom , bell pepper ani besar , baingan bharta , dal makhni ,nawwarah special bread basket , raspberry and madagascar ice-cream.
I liked the caramel shake and madagascar ice cream the most..‚ù§Ô∏è
And for the first time tasted baingan bharta which was amazing. the bread basket is sufficent for around 10 people.
They even serve shisha ,which is an great experience for hookah lovers..
The management is will oraganised..special thanks to shoumon and debashish who were serving us and were very polite amd humble..

This is one of the classiest fine dine in pure vegetarian restaurants in the city presently. I was floored the moment i set foot in the restaurant. The decor, the furniture, the lightings, the way they have done up the walls, only tells you how much they have invested in building up the fancy, nawabi and royal structure that it is, and not just in terms of money but also in terms of thoughtfulness
Coming to the service bit, they have probably learnt the "book on hospitality" ( if there is any) by heart and play every card perfectly. The way they respond, the way they serve. Exceptional. However i was not surprised by this, because its a unit of Ganpati Caterers and they are known for their top notch service.
Coming to the food, the things we ordered..
1. Strawberry Milkshake- Chilled, flavourful, creamy and thick. Does one need anything else in a shake? Came with a beautiful small sponge cake.
2. Watermelon mojito- Chilled and refreshing. The lemon was overpowering the watermelon. It was a good drink to wash down the food nonetheless.
3. Hot and spicy tofu- Perfectly cooked and seasoned, had a little thai taste to it. They prpbably used lemongrass.
4. Bruschetta- It wasn an authentic bruschetta, but who needs authentic if the taste is good. Yes, it tasted really good.
5. Kofta sham savera- Unfortunately, this was my least favourite item from the entire spread. The kofta was very well made, but the gravy was overtly sweet.. I know koftas are supposed to be creamy and sweet but not this sweet. I request the management to take care of this particular dish.
6. Dum aloo- Spicy in a balanced way, perfect gravy and very different flavours than the usual aloo dum you get anywhere else.
7.Vegetable tehri pulao- Exotic is the word. It had roasted cashew nuts in it along with some vegetables and mild flavours.
The special nawarrah bread basket looked good, but i could only eat cheeese naan, and it was very good.
For desserts we had Raspberry Ice cream with cookie crumbles. The amazing combination of creamy and crunchy came in little bowls and had us craving for more. The same goes with madagascar.
The macaroon platter looked beautiful with assorted macaroons. For me, the lemon flavoured macaroons stood out with its unique tangy and sweet taste.
Overall, a highly recommended place, specially for vegetarians.
Special mentibon for the two superbly hospitable members of their crew, Debashish and Soumen. Keep it up guys! A big thumbs up!

The arabic term ' Nawaarah ' means brilliant and the place actually lives up to its expectations... I visited this places with a group of friends and as soon as we set our foot inside we were totally in awe...such grand interiors...olden walls , chandelier, sea green velvety chairs made us feel no less than a kings palace..
Now coming to the food...
Strawberry milkshake (smooth frothy milk shake with a tiny cheesecake)and watermelon mojito as coolers..
Staters were great.. we ordered hot and spicy tofu( it imparted an amazing flavour and a must try) and bruschettas (crisp and rich)
For the main course we settled with some good Tehri pulao ( a brilliant rice tossed with vegetables and dry fruits and is highly recommended.) and kogta sham sabera ( delicate spinach based cottage cheese koftas in sweet aromatic white gravy ) and dum alu and a bread basket..
And though we had no place for desserts yet we tried the macaroon platter which was simply over the top..and when you are aware that the place has an amazing collection of @desserts you will definitely not want to leave without having them.. right????
Last but not the least.. on a special note I would like to personally thank Debashis and Soumen since their prompt service and good behaviour left a mark...

This place in the heart of Kolkata won my heart.
As you enter this place you‚Äôll be quite impressed with the modern yet traditional interiors.
Starting with the food
-Ordered for a strawberry milkshake. Very well presented and tasted better than it looked.
-Moving on with the starters ordered a bruschetta with watermelon mojito.
-Bruschetta had a really good filling of mushrooms and veggies.
-Watermelon mojito was a good try . Light yet so refreshing.
For main course :
Kofta shyam savera was really good to taste at.
Dum Aloo was one lip smacking dish.
Vegetable thehri pulao was the best pulao I‚Äôve tasted in recent time. The rice was soft and was well flavoured.
Raspberry/ Madagascar was just the perfect dessert.
With that caramel crunch it melted right in the mouth.

This place can be described in one single word :  MAJESTIC .

As soon as you enter the restaurant part you see beautiful chandeliers and decorated textured walls that add to the royal touch this place has . 

Coming to the reason we friends were there was FOOD obviously . We ordered a lot of food and the review might get too ling but I am helpless , because you know what ? I have to mention everything - Each item was fantastic . 

‚ö´Ô∏èCaramel Milkshake - Very Delicious and consistent . A perfect way to start things off .

‚ö´Ô∏èVirgin Mojito - Refreshing and the perfect cooler when you are combatting the heat outside . 

‚ö´Ô∏èCorn Salt N Pepper - This again was amazing . The perfect blend . 

‚ö´Ô∏èHot N Spicy Tofu - This was very spicy tasted so good . Loved the sauce in which they prepared this . 

‚ö´Ô∏è Bruschetta - The best I have ever had . You have to try this when you are at Nawwarah 

‚ö´Ô∏èKofta Shyam Savera - These Koftas made of unripened curd cheese in a red alluring thick tomato gravy was lipsmacking . Tasted amazing with the Cheese Naan . 

‚ö´Ô∏èDum Aloo - I don't prefer having Potato dishes in a restaurant . But they suggested this , so we tried this out . To my amazement , this turned out to be very good . Tasted best with Masala Kulcha . 

‚ö´Ô∏è Nawwarah Special Bread Basket - It consisted of all different breads . The Kulchas , Naan and Lachha Parathas were all very good . 

‚ö´Ô∏è Vegetable Tehri Pulao - This again was the best Pulao I have had . The essence itself was enough and then the taste was incredible . 

‚ö´Ô∏èMacaroon Platter - Lime , Strawberry , Chocolate Macaroons üòçüòçüòç . Can't get better . Most Recommended .  

After the heavy lunch we wanted to relax and smoke away a Hookah so we went to their Lounge area and had a Paan flavoured Hookah which again was great . 

Also not to forget , Debashish and Soumen were the two staffs that served us . Both of them were very prompt and attended us very well . Full points on service . 

Don't think . Visit Nawwarah .

Nawwarah is located opposite quest mall, which has both restaurant and lounge!!
The beautiful interiors and the envirmonet goes perfect with the mouth watering food..
I had tried caramel milkshake , virgin mojito , corn salt & pepper , sauteed mushroom , bell pepper ani besar , baingan bharta , dal makhni ,nawwarah special bread basket , raspberry and madagascar ice-cream.
I liked the caramel shake and madagascar ice cream the most..‚ù§Ô∏è
And for the first time tasted baingan bharta which was amazing. the bread basket is sufficent for around 10 people.
They even serve shisha ,which is an great experience for hookah lovers..

Nawwarah Fine Dine & Lounge,perhaps the best veg restaurant in town.The thing which instantly attract you is the eye glittering ambience with sophisticated furnitures and decors.Nawwarah has two portion,one is the restaurant part another is the lounge with Hookah parlours.Let‚Äôs come to the food.Visited this place for lunch with friends,we have tried varieties  of foods from starters to main course and off course desserts.

SHAKES:

Caramel Milkshake: It‚Äôs wonderful and yummy, nicely presented.

STARTERS:

Corn Salt And Pepper: It‚Äôs delicious and flavorful.

Sauteed Mushroom: Best mushroom dish I ever have till date, amazingly tasty and divine.

DRINKS:

Virgin Mojito: As usual refreshing and energetic.

MAIN COURSE:

Bell Pepper Ani Besar: Excellent in taste, something different from the contemporary veg dishes, a recommended one of them.

Baingan Bharta: It‚Äôs excellent in taste and spicy too, another recommended for the bharta lovers, mouthwatering item.I am sure one will not get disappointed.

Dal Makhni: Makhni was enjoyable with the Rotis.

Nawwarah Special Bread Basket: The breads were pretty well,tried it with all of the main courses.

DESSERT:

Macaroon Platter: The platter was delightful with five flavors of macaroons, all were lipsmacking and yummy.

Some of us also tried the Hookah there, it‚Äôs a great experience.

The management is well organized in both portions, specially the two staffs Debasish and Soumen are efficient at their works.

What a luxurious lunch! Definitely worth a visit.

We went there for fine dine restaurant but due to unavailability of seats we decided to try out their cafe. Their cafe is specifically famous for shisha and that's how they have done the d√©cor too of the cafe. When you climb up the stairs the ambience is full of jaipuri shisha. When you enter the cafe, mirrors are all around, even on the ceiling which is pretty unique. The seating arrangement is quite spacious all along the walls with two seats in between, which in my opinion is pointless as no one would choose those. 

Coming to the food, we ordered nachos, cheese jalapeno poppers and green curry thai. Each of the three dishes were good in taste, especially the thai curry. They had kind of Indianised it by adding extra spices but hey! No complaints. It just added on to the taste. Their nachos were also presented in a different way with the beans mashed and as the base of the dish. If you are a fan of cheese, you will like poppers but only till the time they are hot. 

TL;DR - good food, quick service, must visit place.

Went in the evening, found a few tables occupied. Was immediately attended to and led to a table. Normally the steward pulls back the chair to allow the guest to ease into sitting, but here they did not care to do so. So the first impression wasn't very good, so a point deducted. However, the waiter was very prompt in service later, even keeping an eye out for my plate needed to be served from the main dish. 
I ordered a Ginger Peach Soda and Sesame Honey Chili Potato Fries. The soda came in a tall glass, was sweet with basil and strips of ginger, and was really good. The fries had the right mix of chillies and sweetness, was crunchy, and were a delight to have. The quantity of the fries was really a lot and value for money. 
Overall, a good experience and am surely visiting again to try the main courses.

We visited the restaurant and not the lounge section, and we're a bit disappointed with the menu ! The place is pretty but the food was a shocking average ! The shakes were good though , which got our hopes a little high only to be disappointed later with the food ! We also ordered the Milky way,( the only molecular dish in their menu) , since it was mentioned in a lot of reviews , and it was pretty disappointing , be it the taste or the theatrics ! The ambience is all the place has got really !

Seeing the reviews we were totally decided to try this one this time and finally we went there after we got reservation. But then we had a very different experience.

What we ordered did not come upto our expectations and moreover we were really disappointed after we found out that it is from the house of the Ganpati Sanjay Caterers.

Cheese Stuffed Mushroom and Thumbs Up were the only things we liked and really loved.

Amritsari Kulcha for our kid, Pasta Alfredo and Nasi Gorang were totally weird and not upto the eatable mark. Our kid could not finish even half of the Kulcha. Pasta and Nasi Gorang were sour and oily and for the first time in our dining life we had to leave food on the plate and on the table. It is not good manners but then one cannot be eating food which one can never even take down his or hers food pipe.

Upon trying to convey our non-satisfaction we were made to understand things and that we should have ordered that like this and this like that. Come on we know our food and we are not new diners. Seems staff there knows more than you do. Service is also not that great.

Well 2 points for decor, location, good seating and amazing Cheese Stuffed Mushroom.

What we suggest is one should try out only indian dishes here. Probably thats what they are best at.

I personally would never like to visit this place again as my dining choice.

Waited for a long time to visit this Place, atlast the day arrived. First of all at the entrance you will cherish the Moroccan Themed Decor and Interiors. The Place is cozy and nice. We were in the dining section of Nawwarah. 
Now lets talk about food. 
We ordered Tofu with peanut basil sauce and Jai aur Veeru 
It was upto the mark, the taste was just refreshing. 
In the Main Course we ordered Tawa Subz,  Dal makhani Amritsari Kulcha and Afghani Naan. Very few places in Kolkata offer Dal Makhani of this level the aroma was enough to make me fall for it. And all others were delicious as well. 
Was very happy with the service and food. Surely going to visit again soon. Good Work Nawwarah Keep it up.

The service here is at its brim,
I was offered a change of shisha from them, as they felt the experience was not satisfactory.
But trust me, it was really satisfactory for me.

Salute to such service
In an era where hardly any restaurant will change the food they serve.

Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

This huge cry is because I finally found a good enough vegetarian restaurant in Kolkata!! 
I am a vegetarian and I have no qualms about eating in any restaurant, even though it serves non veg. But those generally are not able to serve a mind blowing Vegetarian dish. Well, now my wait is over it seems.
Ambiance: Too good.  We went on Diwali as two of my friends HAD TO(üòõ) eat veg that day. Perfect ambiance for a Diwali dinner with friends. 

Soups: Wanted to try German Potato Soup, but unfortunately they were out of it. So ordered traditional CREAM OF TOMATO and CREAM OF MUSHROOM. Both were upto the standard of a good soup with the right thickness. Quite tasty and left us wanting for more. 

Starters: Ordered Chinese Bhel and Spring Rolls. Chinese Bhel was pretty decent with a tangy flavour. But it had fried noodles. So no complaints there. Spring rolls were quite average. Can be avoided here. 

Main Course: BELL PEPPER ANI BESAR and PIND DA CHANA with NAAN, PUDINA PARANTHA and AJWAIN PARANTHA. 

Besar sabzi, a Parsi delicacy was super. The vegetable dumpling in the curry was made of vegetables and seemed like besan was mixed with it. Bell pepper gravy complimented it just fine. Overall a must try!! 
Pind Da Chana was also quite unique in taste. Just that it is a very dry preparation without gravy so make sure we don't order it as a second item in main course if we are not ordering a Daal. Otherwise taste was traditional like it should be. 

AJWAIN PARANTHA was a problem because there was just too much ajwain on it which might be a problem to some. 

Dessert: Philadelphia Cheesecake. Good ol cheesecake with a scoop of ice cream served with it. Good taste. 

Overall a thumbs up to this place. Have to visit it again.

The food here is generally palatable but the service out here is pathetic. I was recently here with my boyfriend and the staff were acting pretty cocky. They were outrightly rude and had issues eyeing us get cozy. They summoned him only to express their disgust which , I , honestly find hard to digest. It's really outdated and appalling. I've been to uncountable restaurants and outlets and the experience out here left me a bitter aftertaste. I don't think I'm coming back or even recommending Nawwarah to anyone.

True to its name, Nawwarah does have a dazzling exterior. Owned by the famous caterer ganpati sanjay, Nawwarah houses both a lounge and a restaurant. Just as the roots of its name, the ambiance has borrowed heavily from arabic themes, having elaborate chandeliers and also exquisitely done chairs and even the tablewares. 
The food was strictly ok. When the starters were served we hd our hopes up, but the main course and the dessert were strictly ok. We also tried the famous milky way which was a live molecular dessert. But both the taste and the theatrics were disappointing. 
The service also was nothing to write about, the staff seemed new to serving in restaurants and on couple if instances they were dropping food on floor while serving.
The place is way too overhyped for what its dishing out.

Brilliant splendor. The interior is archetypical Moroccan, which is something exclusive in the city and I must say they have displayed it brilliantly. Charming chandelier and colourful mirrors clubbed with beautiful Mediterranean patterns make the ambiance very delightful. There are two three seater swings installed as a seating facility, which throws an extra dimension to the ambiance. 

The staff troupe is very professional, polite and quick with service. Also, given the capacity, there number of staff employed is high. 

The sheesha  ordered were mint apple and gum supari. Chillum  was very smooth and the sheesha lasted long. Flavour was perfect. 

The food I ordered were crispy chilli baby corn and steamed dimsums, neither of which failed to impress. I have had better dimsums honestly. However, the soup served with dimsums was lip smacking.  Another anomaly here is that the normal water served is flavoured with a twig of mint and a slice of lemon, in the bottle which further adds to the exotic experience. 

This place will not disappoint you. Good music and good ambiance, parallel with good sheesha and good food.

Situated opposite to Quest Mall, this place is a must visit.
There are two buildings.
On the left is the lounge and on the right is the dine-in area.

The USP of this place is it's interior decor and ambience.

Both lounge and dine-in area is truly like a nawab experience.

And fortunately the food served also is quite good.

My pick for the main course would be Malai Kofta.

Situated right across Quest mall, this Moroccan themed restaurant is beautifully done up.
They are a pure veg restaurant so bear that in mind when you get attracted like a moth to a flame, to try out this restaurant which is very inviting from the inside. They however are just as consistent in the inside as well :) with their rich decor. Although for some reason godfather's theme kept playing in the background.
Apart from the usual pizza, pasta, burger, salads in their menu, they have dishes which are different and not your run of the mill eateries. Their dessert is their highlight and employs molecular gastronomy, so you must try that for sure.The food is good. I just you go for a dish that sound different or unique to you.
They also have valet.

Not very often do I visit any pure veg restaurant and be so happy with it. 
Nawwarah was one such.
The ambience is beautiful, so much royal. The place is divided in the upper lounge and restaurant in the ground floor. 
Since we were a group of 10 we took the area in the lounge. 
Coming to the food, Nawwarah serves one of the best veg dishes there. We had:
1. Havmor  vegetable tawa pulao- 1. Decent pulao served with amazing aloo dum. 
2. Mere Boss ka favourite- 3. Seriously, our favourite too. The butter masala melts in the mouth. 
3. Delhi ke paneer korma te rajma chawal- 2. 
4. Paneer khurchan- 2.
5. Mumbaiyya sandwich- 1.
6. Pasta in white sauce- 1.

Each and every dish had been fab. And we almost licked off our plates. 
The prices too were quite decent, a 2750 for 10 of us.

The place is really good. Ambience is really pleasant. I must say the decor is 10/10. Food is mouth watering. And it's really pocket friendly. Staffs are friendly. We took Mexican French Fries, Panfried Momos and Kungfu Thali. The drinking water they serve at first tastes of Pudhina and Lemon. They also serves Hookah and Alcohol. You need to be 18+ and should carry an I-Card. You must visit here with a group of friends.

Went to this place on Nabami with one of my friend. starting with that i had to wait for 30mins for my turn since it was Puja time. 
Ordered for Popcorn Mojito , hazelnut Milkshake.
Try out their amazing milkshakes. They are heavenly. You will want for more of it surely until you finish with one. It's thick. Quantity is good . And served in cute glass bottle. 
Popcorn Mojito is the specialty of this place .try one. 
The new concept of Nitrogen fumes along with popcorn corns and Mojito syrup acted well .
Service was good.
Though the ambience is quite sparkling and more decorative.

Wow, it seems that Calcutta people are slowly accepting vegetarian items on the menu as 'food'! üòÖ Nawwarah seems to be on everybody's bookmarked places! We still remember how on a very popular YouTube video, a person said that when a vegetarian goes to eat with a group of non-vegetarians, the only veg item for him/her is the mouth freshener provided by the restaurant at the end of the meal. Haha!

At the entry of Nawwarah, we couldn't help laughing when one of the staff standing outside suggested- "Maam and Sir, before you enter, you must knoe already that this is a pure veg restaurant!"
Basically, what she wanted to say to all the Bengalis was- "don't say I didn't warn you". üòù

Coming to the main story, Nawwarah is a good place for vegetarians. The staff is warm and friendly, the interiors have been nicely done, the food is served piping hot.
We are just two people and are frugal eaters, we don't stuff ourselves with everything on the menu. Just the Gumcha shorba and au gratin+garlic bread was enough for us.
The shorba was not that bad, the au gratin with cheesy gooey vegetables like broccoli, bell peppers, sweet corn, peas etc. can be happily ordered for your fussy toddler. We always love food which is tasty as well as nutritious.

Overall, you won't be disappointed if you love your vegetables or if you are a sad vegetarian in this city flooded with non-vegetarians.
...........................................................................................
A special note for people who are still struggling with GST. The bill at Nawwarah comes with GST and service charge. We found a large group arguing at the payment desk about service charges. People constantly confuse SERVICE TAX with SERVICE CHARGE. You have to pay the tax but if you don't want to pay the service charge, nobody can force you to.
Pocket pinch-
INR 600 including taxes and service charge

A place where I can sit for hours and enjoy the most amazing sheesha and music. A pseudo vegetarian who is equally picky about food has found her own little paradise in their "smartass menu". Great ambiance. Mesmerizing live music. What can one ask? I've found my solace in here. Thank you Nawwarah for always being at your best. #teamnawwarah üôåüíï

I was made to sit on a wooden stool after waiting for over 1 hour and have food. The food table was below my knees.  And when I asked for a chair they said they cannot provide a maximum than two chairs, which my elderly parents had to use. 
The dal makhani served was burnt. The cook though said the same cannot be burnt. 
The waiters were not aware of food items availability or even what were the details therein. 
The eating table was so cramped that I was keeping food on an extra wooden stool. 
I was told food will be served in banquet area though any arrangements thereof was pathetic. 
I paid my bill via a Rs. 2000 note which had 2 digits written on it and they refused to accept the same as their banker (ICICI) has refused to accept, so know they are above RBI.
And at the end of all their manager Mr. Salman was highly rude and pessimistic when I gave him my reviews.

This is by far the best vegetarian restaurant I have visited in Kolkata because of the quality of food , ambience , spaciousness and range ! 
Honestly I had been craving to visit  this place for quite some time now and so few of my friends decided to try out this happening place just opposite Quest Mall in Ballygunge and we were awestuck by the decoration and the grandeur of this place .
‚úìWe started with -
Virgin Mojito ,
Aerated Shakes ,
 Watermelon Feta Salad , 
Jalapeno cheese poppers ,
Steamed dim sums and 
Nazza .
My absolute favorite were the strawberry and Hazelnut Shakes ! 
‚úìNext was cheese crostini ,
Corn Salad and pepper
Open sandwich
Mushroom Risotto
Kung-pao veg with Jasmine Rice 
Bolognese
Veg ratatouille .
My unquestioned favourites were open Sandwich loaded with Cheese ,Mushroom Risotto (must try) and watermelon feta salad ! 

In the deserts we had kesaria Basundi Kulfi and milky way .
P.s- You cannot afford to miss the shisha at this place .It is probably the most colourful and vibrant sisha I Had ever seen.
I will definitely recommend this place to all of you even if you are  not much of  a veg fan üòá

Nawwarah has been on my wish list since long. So finally I visited this place yesterday.

üè©Location: Very easy to locate, this place stands right opposite to Quest Mall.

üéáInteriors & D√©cor: Their interior is what attracted me the most. This place is done up in two sections, Fine Dinning & Lounge. We had our lunch in the fine dining area followed by Sheesha in the lounge. Vibrant and colorful, is what the lounge is with beautiful decoration in both the sections.

üçïFood: Nawwarah is a multi cuisine restaurant, serving a wide variety of vegetarian items.
Some of the many items which I tried are;

Beverageüçπ
I think they make the best shakes in town. It's really really commendable. I tried their Strawberry Shake which was literally heavenly. Others tried were KitKat Shake which I loved the most, next to strawberry, Hazelnut Shake and Oreo Shake. Each of them were accompanied with a piece of brownie. Great presentation, worth mentioning. Apart from shakes, I tasted their Virgin Mojito which was well up to the mark.

Starters and Main Course üçüüçîüçù
I tried Watermelon Feta Salad, Jalape√±os Cheese Poppers, Steamed Dimsums, Nazza, Cheese Crostini, Corn Salt and Pepper, Open Sandwich, Mushroom Risotto, Kung Pao Veg with Jasmine Rice, Bolognese. Veg Ratatouille.
Each item was quite good, some of them worth special mentioning were the Mushroom Risotto, Bolognese, Open Sandwich and Corn Salt and Pepper, these were my personal picks, which I simply loved the most.

Desertüç®
Kesariya Basundi Kulfi and Milky Way. The latter needs a special mention due to the way they make it live in front of you, the taste of course being as good as the way it is made.

Sheesha
Tried a couple of them, one being Blueberry and the other I don't remember. Decent, I would say.

üíÅGood hospitality. Courteous staff.
Overall, a nice place to visit. I do recommend! üòä

Nawwarah has been on my bucket list from a long time now. Finally got to visit the vibrant places that stands in Syed Amir Ali Avenue just opposite to Quest Mall.

The restaurant is in the ground floor.
Coming to the service,it's quite promt. It's a must visit for all the vegans. Starting from the shakes to the starters,main course and dessert everything was equally delicious.

Food: 
We tried the aerated shakes out of which the strawberry and hazelnut were the best.

From the starters,the steamed dimsums and jalape√±o poppers were delicious

From the main course,
The open sandwich
Nazza
Cheese crostini
Are a must try from this place.

From the dessert section.
One should also watch the making process of the milky way.

Nawwarah is situated opposite Quest,one of the most trending cafe in kolkata.
Even though they serve pure vegetarian food they do live up to your expectations.
The ambience is beautiful and the service is quick.
Must try:
Hazelnut shake and the strawberry shake.(best in kolkata.)
The nawwarah platter.
The amritsari chole and kulche.
Nazza.(combination of naan and pizza served with dal makhani.)
Jalapeno cheese poppers.
Steamed dimsums.

This place is situated just opposite to Quest Mall,Ballygaunge 
The amazing decor of the place is too eye peeping.Once you visit you will fall in love with this place!
Not only the food Nawwarah has got the Best suited crowd of the city because of the innovation that they produce with the food and the Quality that they maintain well even in good vegetarian courses!

I started off with some Hazelnut and Almond shake. It tastes amazing. You can feel this to be amazing in every drop of the shake! You can even try out the strawberry shakes. It will make you long for one more of it‚ù§

I had some jalapeno chicken poppers as my starters. It was amazing. For all the cheese lovers and jalapeno dipped ones please try these. One of the best cheese poppers i had in the town.

Ordered for some Steamed Dimsum. Good stuffing. Quantity is good. Dimsum was too soft i must say. Tastes good.

Next came the Nazza! Well what's it? Its Naan+Pizza=Nazza üòÅ look at the innovation. Amazing and popping! Tastes good. With coated cheese on top along with pizza toppings. Again for the cheese lovers one must go ‚ù§

Corn salt and pepper .yes it was innovative too. We basically have corn in normal basis. But have you try with some tangy taste along statuated with salt and pepper? Try out here! Tastes amazing. A must try out dish from this place!

Ordered for Kung pao veg with Jasmine rice. When you order this just have a look at the dish that they serve. How beautiful they place the rice in the middle along with the Kung pao veg along the side! Just enjoy the Beautiful smelted rice!

Next for me came the desert. Milky way. Just beautiful they present it in front of you will make you not eat it and save it for admiration.‚ù§ Amazing done with liquid Nitrogen Fumes.

The lovely decor. The pretty mirrors and photo frames over the wall. The pretty ambience.
Feel like a Nawab as the name justifies!
Service was good .staffs were good aware of the dishes.
For some amazing Shisha do visit this place as they also have allotments for such.

A must try for all the vegans out there. Do visit.
Go grab it all at once! :)

Location: Opposite Quest Mall on Syed Amir Ali Avenue.

Ambience and Decor- The ambience is great and the decor is amazing both for the restaurant and the lounge,the owner has done a great
job in creating such a unique decor which is not to be seen anywhere else in Kolkata.Really Impressive.

Food and Beverages:

I visited the place with a group of friends for lunch and we were not disappointed at all, we ordered:

Beverages:

Strawberry Shake: Hands down the best shake I have ever had,super smooth and thick.Lovely flavour served with a small brownie.Fell in love with it.Heavenly taste.

KitKat Shake: This too was very impressive and tasted amazing.

Food:


Starters:

Watermelon Feta Salad: Really fresh dices of watermelon topped with feta cheese,really loved the combination.

Jalapeno Cheese Poppers: These are one of the better cheese poppers I have eaten,really crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside,perfect flavours.

Veg DimSums: This was also decent but its soup was really great.

Cheese Crostini: Served with a generous amount of cheese,this dish was really filling and flavoursome at the same time.

Nazza: A unique combination of naan and pizza served with Dal Makhani,really loved the combo. Really tasty.

Main Course:

Bolognese: It was very flavourful served with 2 pieces of bread.Liked it.

Mushroom Risotto: This was the best part of the main course.I really liked how the flavours came out in this dish,Mushroom can never taste better.

Desserts:

Milky Way: Made right in front of our eyes with precision this is an amazing dessert consisting of macarons,brownie,chocolate sauce,ice cream and of course liquid nitrogen to make it eye dazzling.

Shisha: One of the best shisha I have had,super smooth.

Service:

The service is amazing,the items were served on time and the ones which took a little longer were totally worth the wait,the staff are courteous and helpful.

Situated opposite to quest mall, this place is the heaven for veg dishes and vegeterians.
We ordered some new dishes they introduced like
Strawberry Milkshake- A must must try. Best milkshake ever had
Kitkat Shake- really beautifully presented and tasted really good.

Watermelon Feta salad was something to look forward.
Jalepenos Cheese Poppers- One plate would not be enough because its just so amazing.
Steamed Dim Sums- Made to perfection.
Nazza- A mix of naan and pizza. Never thought it would taste good. Thankyou for proving me wrong.

All in all it was a very good experience and I am really really happy with the kind of service that I received from the restaurant.
You should also try the Shisha that they provide in the lounge. Also when you're going there have ample space in your phone because you're going to click so many pictures. The place and the ambience will knock your socks off. Cheers.

A decently decorated place just opposite Quest mall, although it was on my bucket list for long it was delayed deliberately due to it being Veg.
However last day after a tiring day in Hospital me and my friend hoped in.The decors were elegant and the swing by it adds a gracious touch.
It had three storeys with serving private party, cafe and restaurant.
We ordered Mezze platter , German potato soup, ,Cheese crostini ,Cheese fondue .
The cheese fondue was not at all to the mark with just two pieces of bread and some olives,jalepenos and nachos-was a total let down.
The mezze platter was okayish though it lacked some paneer items.
In the mocktails wr had Sex on tge beach - a total thumbs up..thank to the cranberry juice.
Among the dessert we had the plan to try the Milky way, but being too full we settled for the  Black and white chocolate mousse platter. It was 3layered with Chocolate filling topped with vanilla cream and vanilla crumbs which tasted good.
Overall it was a decent place to hang out with your veggie friends.

The Ganpati Franchise have done it again. This place is continuously trending amongst one of the foremost options for any foodie. Each floor of the magnanimous eatery is equipped with all-you-can-have options. Be it Indian, Chinese, Continental or even Hookah, they have modernized the experience of what is served in a plate. Needless to say there is no dish you would not like to try out. Full marks to the selection of the items and the execution by the chefs. We loved Nazza, Mere Boss ka favourite, Paneer Khurchan, Cheese stuffed Mushroom, Kasundi Paneer Tikka and Cheese Mushroom. Missing on yhe desserts section would be a crime. The ambience and the service is 10/10. Notice the extraordinary interior and lavish seating arrangements including a Jhula (swing) in the Lounge area on the first floor. A must visit place for every foodie.

Went to this place on a whim and was pleasantly surprised both with the food,the decor as well as the courteousness of the staffs.Its located just on the opposite foot of the quest mall,so its pretty easy to locate.Coming to the food,we ordered a brownie milkshake which came with a complementary slice of cheesecake and a dark and white chocolate mousse.This was very filling and was beautifully presented.The interiors of the lounge area is beyond words but alongside being elegant it had that soft touch of comfort as well.A place worth a visit multiple times!

I went to nawwarah with family and it was a big disappointment. There was some problem with their ac and they didnot inform us when we got there. Took our order and even after repeated request to make it cooler they didnot heed us. It was so hot that we were sweating and finally we had to leave the place. Very ungracious and were not sorry at all...... had heard a lot about the place and the owners seem to have a good name in catering....... So i think they should stick to that and leave the restaurant business

A great place for nice vegetarian food, shisha & drinks.
Tried something called Buttery Nipples there ( cocktail ) ,
One drink was enough to sort an entire Saturday night.
I drink to skies but this Irish cocktail was something out of the world.
The bill also is such a bargain ,
I know one of the managers there and was informed that the place is even 
expanding with an open air setup, absolutely can't wait for this beauty to rise up.

Marvellous job Team Nawwarah & Ganpati Sanjay ji.

A lot of reviews are going against this place but in my experience this place cannot be any better,Its perfect..üëç

Nawwarah is located bang opposite Quest mall. One of the best Vegetarian Dining Restaurant in kolkata at present and overall the place is great and has a nice ambience. The service is good and the staff is courteous.I couldn't have asked for a better service.. They were always there for the assistance..

P.s I dont know why people complain so much about the staff and the manager. I guess I got the best hospitality ‚ò∫

Interiors is something people go gaga about.When it comes to food the quantity is really good for two though I found the price little bit on the higher side.But if you are totally satisfied with food it won't pinch your pocket.We ordered for chilli garlic noodles and some paneer side dish and the Hazelnut shake with cheese cake bite was yumm.

I wouldn't mind going back to this place..Team Nawwarah Good Job !! üòä

Went for the first time with a friend. The interior is beautiful...very colourful and well lit. They offer good food with lovely presentation.
We ordered the-

Popcorn Mojito....give it a try...that's all I wanna say :P

Ginger and Peach Soda, this was yummy too but I liked the popcorn one more.

Nawwarah platter, which includes malai broccoli tikka (it tasted good, the broccoli still had its crunch), paneer tikka (very yummy, and on the spicier side) and tandoori aloo (it had a filling of crumbled paneer inside.....tasted really good too). Even the chutney served along with it were very nice.

Mezze platter, includes Zaater bread (thin crisp flatbread with za'atar spice mix sprinkled on top), Kurkure (some kind of fritter, maybe made of chickpea, crisp on the outside, slightly fluffy on the inside....it tasted good), cheese chizzling (again, this was yummy too...with American corn and cheese filling) and 3 dips (baba ganoush, Labna dip and hummus......all 3 were good).

Second visit-

Sweet 16: This is such a pretty drink....the name is perfect for this mocktail. tasted good too.

Caramel Moccachino: Good.

Four cheese pizza- The pizza was good.

Jalape√±o cheese popper: This was nice and yummy.

Pasta (macaroni with mushroom in alfredo sauce): it was very tasty. One of the best pasta I had outside recently.

A fine dining restaurant is also known by its wash room. The current wash room of the place was wet, messy and unclean. Overall hygiene in the restaurant is not good. We ordered the char grilled potato and the dahi kabab, the former was of an average taste, the latter though spicy was adequately tasty. Mixed vegetable was hot and tasty, The black dal needs improvement. It had no hint of ginger, had an overarching smell of butter. The height of the sofa is very low considering the current height of the table. Maybe you need to add cushions to the sofa to increase the height. Another point, please print some more menu cards. We were a large group and it is common for a couple of people to use one menu card. The waitress said that if I give you all the menu cards how will other guests order? Oh come on, a fine dining restaurant can print enough menu cards after all. 

Overall the food was tasty but the wow factor was missing. I was under the impression that this would be the best fine dining pure vegetarian restaurant in the city but I would say that you are among the good ones. There is a difference between customer satisfaction and customer delight. While you meet most parameters for customer satisfaction, you need to work on a few things to reach the level of customer delight. All the best, and hopefully the next time that I visit I would be able to say "WOW"

This place is a BIG NO NO
Thumbs up : Good location, the interiors are really good u will have a feeling that u in a standard place.  Dining is good but the lounge is where the main problem is. 

Thumbs down : The people working in this place are in real need of training of basic etiquettes and manners they really don't know how to talk to people. This is highly disappointing to see such a good place is having such people which really puts the owners money at stake. The second point is why are they having an entry fee ( can be redeemed inside) ?? It's not a Taj Mahal.  

I am not going to this place again for sure as bad food is still OK to tolerate but bad behavior is something which nobody can tolerate.

He's an arrogant person who doesn't know how to talk to his staff or treat their loyal customers. Such a good place doesn't deserve people like him. Such a big disgrace.Giving the lowest rating just because of his disrespectful behaviour!

This place has very nice food, the ambiance is good and service is perfect .
But I am rating this place low because of the behaviour of the Fmg Mannager. He seriously need to learn how to behave with his staff esp. in front of his customers and also how to treat his customers, specially the regular ones. He is such an arrogant man. We made their staff play some songs and everyone were enjoying when suddenly he comes there and started yelling at the staff like anything . And he was not even sorry . When we said that it's not their fault and atleast you should speak nicely, he started disrespecting us as well. Such a good place doesn't deserve people like him. I don't know how can someone hire a person like him. Giving the lowest rating just because of him.

This is one of the best trending place in Kolkata right now. The food and presentation is absolutely amazing, the dishes they prepare are delicious, specially mocktails and desserts. The only drawback is that its a pure vegetarian restaurant. You can have shisha in here at an extremely cozy interior. The ambiance is like heaven on earth. It so beautiful that you will feel like you have visited a palace in the middle of a city.¬†
A group of friends of us had a great time last week here. The Thirsty Barber ¬†& Pop Corn Mojito were very unique. ¬†Mint and Peach Pyramid and Virgin Mojito was quite freshening !¬†

Zucchini Roulate, Cheese balls, Cheesy Garlic mushroom and Italian Sizzler was in menu for us that day! We did not went for any main course though !¬†
But could not resist to order dessert. The Cheese Cake was super ! Masala Chai Ice Cream worthy enough to try for !¬†

It is an ideal location for romantic dates and cool party zone for friends as well. Haven't been to Nawwarah yet ? Visit now and as soon as possible. This place is going to blow your mind.

Its a Full Five star experience. Wish it had Non Veg Item ! So, I am going with 4.5 !!

One of the better places to be in town... Nawarrah has a menu fillled with lip-smacking delicacies. Every item, from the starters, the platter to the main course, has a rich taste and flavor(4 cheese pizza and the New Cheesecake being my favourite). The music collection of the place is superb. The staff are very attentive and friendly. Order delays are a ¬†rarity here. Talking about shisha, the collection of bases, the flavors is ¬†brilliant. The feeling of sitting in this place is Royal due to the ambience and it's setup. Definitely my favourite place as of now :)) The events in Nawarrah, especially the live music night, is not worth a miss. The owner is really friendly too ;)

If you are Vegetarian Nawwarah is for you and for Non-Vegetarians who want to change their choice of food for a day I will suggest you all to try Nawwarah for once and I am sure u gonna love the food and place alot.
Now coming to Food it was absolutely wonderful from preparation to presentation I personally love it so much. If anyone is planning to go Nawwarah I will suggest you try Popcorn Mojito and Safe sex on the beach it's a mocktail refreshing tastes in lounge side and the ambiance is so cool and colourful with soft music on the 1st floor, for Shisha lover they have 2nd floor for you with sounds of Cool Music (Music choice is very good) and Dinning area is in ground floor with royal touch to your status üòâ. They have lots of starter suggestion in the menu but I will suggest you try #Jai and Veeru it's is made by Paneer and baked Potatoes with some tangy chatni with it and yes must try Shanghai Spring Rolls and for the Main course you can try Bell Pepper Ani Besar with garlic naan Ahaan God,I can never believe that I my self can love veggies (I am pure non vegetarian) it's simply awesome and yummy taste , and don't forget to try there Signature Dessert Milky Way. Ghosh I just love each and every sec I spend in Nawwarah.

Food: serves a variety of food. We ordered a paneer kabab and hakka noodles+manchurian. Food was good, delicious. 
Points to improve: can improve on the  taste of food a little bit more, in my opinion.

Located exactly to Quest Mall - they have different areas (lounge, restaurant etc)
I went here on an afternoon with my cousin.
We 2 were really hungry and landing here was seriously the best part:)
Ganpati ka food is something that everyone will love to eat !
We tried the North Indian Platter - speechless ! The exact taste after so many days ! Just wow !
Can't comment on other cuisines.
But best for North Indian (in my list till date)
And yes, the ambience is also great üòé

Out of nowhere am I a vegeterian freak for some speciality dishes and when it came for the hunt at Nawwarah.. I decided to have a seek into the famous vegeterian treasure located just opposite to Quest Mall, Park Circus. Easily accessible from every part of Kolkata and close to the Seven Point Crossing at Park Circus, The Extraordinary Infrastructure will be quite eye catching as per the location. Divided into three segments, The First Building is a Shisha (Hookah) Bar while the Second Segment is an amazing dine-in interior with comfortable air-conditioning and background music that will automatically refresh up your exhaustness as well as the Third Segment comprising also of the dine in with a buffet in the first floor to it. Staffs were courteous enough to arrange a perfect table for our friends to sit together. The interior decorations were just awesome and one of the best till date. Though not a vegeterian freak but still I was keen to see their variety of items in the menu.
The Quite Humble Staffs brough the ordered items in no time one by one. First came in the Mocktails to suite up your appetite and energize your taste buds.
* The Thirsty Barber : A Perpetuated Nitrogen based evaporating gas based drink with the complex mixture of mint and orange flavour. Tasted quite innovative and refreshing.
* Mint and Peach Pyramid : An absoloute fruity peach flavoured ice crused mocktail with refreshing mint leaves to add up the taste.
* Virgin Mojito & Popcorn Mojito : Two of the differebt types of refreshing and one of the best in town mojitos with iced cubes, lime and popcorn in the other one adding innovative flavours at its best undoubtedly.
Next after tasting these lip smacking mocktail delights from their menu.. we looked forward for the main course food items including some starters. The food came in no time and the garnished depiction and the hypnotising aroma smelled brilliant.
* Crispy Cheese Ball : A perfect crisp cheese bursters served with hot and sweet manchurian sauce and few lettuce salad adding smooth flavour to it especially due to the cheese.
* Zucchini Roulate : An absoloute typical dish wrapped in brinjal covering with cheese filled stuff inside. The taste was moderate somewhat which I personally was not that satisfied.
In between the mid way came the famous Mumbai Cutting Tea which was somewhat awkward in between but tasted outstanding with a typical glass holder arranged for it.
Next was the Italian Sizzler decorated with Noodles and encroasted with pineapple layers and potato with cheesy corn fillings which blended an unique taste to it. The smoke from the sizzler was aromatic with a barbeque flavour. The last one was Cheesy Garlic Mushroom with Lavash Bread was a blend of vegeterian treasure with soft cuddlings of mushroom cooked with flavours of garlic and cheese diced with lavash bread.
Next in line were the deserts and the Shisha (Hookah) for which we shifted into the First Floor where our Desserts were served with Chef's Final Touch and Garnishing.
* Masala Chai Ice Cream : A Dessert Ice Cream which is flavoured normally with a backlash taste of tea flavour and tasted not satisfactory but okay types.
* Brownie Cheese Cake : A Soft Caramel based Pudding type Cake which is authentically dressed up with chocolate sauce and chocolate waffers with butter and cream on toppings which was the best dessert till now.
Concluding the part was the Orange flavoured and the Papaya-Mint flavoured Shisha (Hookah) that was a joy burster to the dinner at the end..!!
Satisfactorily I am happy with their service and I would personally recommended everyone to go and have tryout especially if you are a vegeterian freak or loves to taste everything in your life..!!

I will be very honest here. I am a carnivore and frown at the sound of vegetarian food and seldom drop into a place that serves a vegetarian spread. 

But a lot of my friends asked me to drop into Nawwarah and I finally made my visit this week. We ordered a few drinks a few appetizers and a ckuple of desserts and everything was way above what I perceived they would be. 

The beverages, right from the cutting chai to the popcorn mojito were down right impressive. I loved how each of the items were served and all that drama with the liquid nitrogen was well worth it. 

My best course though was dessert. Both the cheese cake and the chai icecream were spellboundingly beautiful. I can come back to Nawwarah again and again just for those beautifully composed deliciouness, they serve as desserts. 

It truly is an unmissable place to dine in.

For all the vegetarian food lovers and for those who need a change this is the best place to visit. Good ambiance with full of energy. There is a restaurant, cafetaria, and hookah space. Must try in drinks is popcorn mojito, desert - the signature dish " milky way" and main course is a yummy parsy dish name- bell pepper ani besar.

Nawwarah as the name suggests, its really brilliant and impressive too. The outlet is located just oppsite of the Quest Mall. The restaurant is owned by Ganpati, the most famous vegetarian caterer of the city.

First of all the decor of the outlet is just fabulous. It has three sections where the ground floor section is meant for only food items where sheesha won‚Äôt be served.

On the first floor and the second floor sheesha will be served along with food whereas they have a buffet option on the first floor. I will rate the decor of 4.5/5. The crowd was also good too, so i suggest as a good option for family dine in.

The drinks are good too. Never the less it's lil expensive but most of the things are worthy enough. I found the Pop Corn Mojito and The Thirsty Barber very innovative and its good too. It includes a very fine essence of mint in it. I would rate 4.5/5 for these two. Virgin Mojito and Peach pyramid was good enough. Loved the Masala Tea also (personal favourite).

In food I ordered Zucchini Roulate, Cheese balls, Cheesy Garlic mushroom and Italian Sizzler. I must say the quality was really upto the mark. Chessy Garlic Mushroom and Zucchini Roulate is a must try one over here.

In desert menu I liked the Brownie Cheese cake which is having a topping of oreo biscuit on it. Each bite is just melting like anything. The best item in the menu list. Tried the masala tea ice cream which I felt needs some moderation.

I loved the sheesha too. As I orderded for AK47 they came up with almost 4.5 feet tall hookah base with a fruit chillam and i must say it's a must try one. I will rate this sheesha 5/5. Other sheesha that i tried was blueberry with spring water which is good but not like the other one. So i will rate 4/5 for sheesha. Overall its a good dine in option and a must visit outlet for vegetarians specially.

Nawwarah is one of my regular spot. Their ambience is top notch and the food's great. Of the countless items I have tried here, I like their saut√© mushrooms & the nawwarah platter the most. 
They've recently launched a new dessert; the brownie cheesecake. I tried it on the very day it released and I wouldnt be exaggerating if I called it divine. Priced at around 600, its a must try. Their unplugged nights are great too. A pocket friendly & must visit place. 
However, the only con out here is that the music becomes tad bit overbearing to the ears.

I am such a person who is by birth strictly non-vegetarian ‚Äì Whenever I try any new restaurant‚Äôs food I make sure that it should and always be ‚ÄúNon- Veg‚Äù ‚Äì I call it ‚ÄúNROM‚Äù mode ‚Äì No Rice Only Mutton!!
Anyway, being a foodie and food reviewer, I go to different types of places which serve varieties types of cuisine. Yesterday was such a day when I tried such a place ‚Äì ‚ÄòNawwrah‚Äô
Located just opposite to the Quest mall in Syed Amir Ali avenue ‚Äì this is a strictly Veg/Began restaurant and when I came to know about this, I was quite disappointed that I will travel that much after office and that too for a Veg food? Lucky me, that I didn‚Äôt stick upon this thought for more than a minute!!
It was an event organized by Foodzpah group; we around a team of 12 people went over there around 6:45 PM ‚Äì The first step I put inside the place ‚Äì I was just blown away ‚Äì such a beautiful interior decoration with impeccable chandeliers hanging from the roof ‚Äì The walls are decorated with very stylish and innovative designer paints and mirrors ‚Äì Lights reflecting on them and a soothing classical instrumental music were creating a ‚ÄúMughal Darbar‚Äù kind of atmosphere. For my kind of people who are not that Pro in photography and rely mostly on mobileography , this place should be a winner ‚Äì coz wherever you place your phone and press the shutter, it would provide a picture like a professional image.
We made ourselves comfortable and after a few chit chats, the welcome drinks/appetizers were served. We had -
1. ‚ÄúThe thirsty Barber‚Äù ‚Äì An Orange based soft drink with nitrogen gas evaporating continuously with Pudina leaf topping
2. ‚ÄúMint and Peach pyramid‚Äù ‚Äì as the name says, a mocktail made with peach and mint shaped with crushed ice
3. ‚ÄúVirgin Mojito‚Äù ‚Äì As ususal
4. ‚ÄúPopcorn Mojito‚Äù ‚Äì Caramel flavor base mocktail with a few popcorn floating over the drink and in a round shape ice made pot
5. The famous ‚ÄúCutting chai‚Äù of Mumbai style
All the items were nice and very smooth ‚Äì I personally liked the number 1 and 4 mostly
This was followed by starters where we had Zucchini Roulate, Cheese balls and Cheesy garlic mushroom‚Äì The first one was a new thing to me ‚Äì I though really not sure about the ingredients but a very soft cream and probably prepared with Brinjal. The cheese balls were also very juicy and smooth served with spicy salsa sauce. The mushroom preparation was ok not that very good. After this, a Sizzler was served which was mostly potato and pineapple based and garnished with some noodles ‚Äì though I personally didn‚Äôt like the taste as the potatoes were not that soft and the taste was not that lipsmacking. Finally we had 2 varieties of icecreams and 2 flavours of hookah (Sheesha) ‚Äì The first ice cream was mostly pudding and chocolate based with the some oreos garnished over it. The second one was strawberry and butterscotch based ‚Äì overall good taste.
So everything above if summarized ‚Äì I can guarantee a very good time specially for the pure veggies/Began people out there. Special mention, again the awesome interior decoration and courtesy of the staffs.

This vegetarian restaurant/bristo is an amazing place to hang out with friends & family, located in Syed Amir Ali Avenue bang opposite to the Quest Mall. This three storey moroccan palace is segmented into restaurant & lounge. So for restaurant the entry is from right side & for the lounge its from left. The staircase is decorated with moroccan tiles & royal paintings. The brightly lit chandeliers, royal sofa & chairs are breathtaking! The lounges are decorated with jhulas where you can have hookah & feel royal! Coming to food this is the paradise for the vegetarians & vegans, we ordered some lipsmacking starters zucchini Roulate, Italian sizzler & cheese balls & it was cooked to perfection! The Italian sizzler was accompanied with a deep fried coated pineapple slice, spiced noodles, saucy paneer steak and skinned baked cheese potato the combination was just yumm! I also tried mint & peach pyramid & the thirsty barber, the drinks were perfectly mixed. As it is also a heaven for dessert lovers they really have great variety of pastries, cake & flavoured ice creams. Tried the brownie cheese cake topped with oreo bites, the yumminess is still alive in my mind. The staff's were courteous friendly & prompt. Overall experience is great, will visit again to try their Shisha & indian cuisine. Valet parking available.

Nawarrah_as the arabic name suggests, it is brilliant, dazzling and radiant! The morrocan decor, is a visual treat!! And this is a palace in its own way! The chandeliers, the matching upholstery, the beautifully arranged tiles, the chairs with the carvings seen in mughal buildings is magnificent! People should visit for the view itself! A lot of attention has been given to the details of each decoration, and it will be a paradise for selfie lovers! 
The place is divided into three zones, a family restaurant, a lounge, and a seperate area for desserts and shisha. 
It is one of the most happening places in town for vegetarians! 
Now in the mocktails we ordered, The thirsty barber, which was mind blowing! Had an awesome fresh vibe along with the visual treat with the liquid nitrogen! That was followed by The Mint and peach pyramid, Virgin mojito, both the drinks had perfect balance in the mint portion, and were refreshing! We ordered another interesting dish, called the popcorn mojito and this was quite unique. 
In the main course we ordered the cheese balls, which were really well made, zuchinni roulete another fancy looking dish which melted in my mouth! The cheesy garlic mushroom was well made too. Special mentiin to the italian sizzler, which was served with a deep fried pineapple crumb, and i just loved that! 
Then in the dessert we had masala chai ice cream, and finally the Pholadelphia Brownie Cheese Cake arrived! This tasted, just out of this world! The best cheesecake i ever had, made in front of our eyes by the chef himself.This is a must try. 
We also had the shisha, which was served in really cool ways! Like one in an AK47 shaped container! Must try i must say!
Go knock their doors, you will come out happier :)

Nawwarah is located bang opposite to Quest mall in Park Circus. To start with, you have valet to take care of your parking concern. The restaurant/bistro has got multi level segmentations dedicated to shisha, dining etc. It's a pure veg restaurant yet they have got a wide spectrum of cuisines on offer. I tried the italian sizzler served with a portion of noodles and zucchini roulate to accompany it. Both cooked to perfection. Left the place craving for more, gonna come back soon.

The house of royalty stands just opposite to the Quest mall, Ballygunj with two entrances (the right one leading to the eatery joint and the left one takes you to the hookah lounge) through an antique staircase.
Guess "stop and stare" is the theme of this place!
You just cannot skip any space without capturing the picturesque corners. It's lit!
The ground floor has a beautiful set up with a magnificent chandelier, sofalike seating arrangement and elegant backdrop.
Let me REMIND you this is a veg restaurant since you might forget the same while tasting the dishes. Each platter is so unique and different from each other.
Have never tasted such droolicious mojitos ever. They come in various flavours and shapes!

Popcorn mojito - It was fun. Salty with right amount of flavour and popcorns to decorate with.

The Thirsty Barber - I like the name. ;) A perfect example of cheercool drink. This one was sweet n salty, orange in colour and soothing of course!

Cheese balls - The platter looked so vivid accompanied with chilly sauce. Overloaded with cheese so they could never go wrong.

Zuchini roulade - that makes a great vegetarian centre stage dish. With a creamy filling of feta cheese and grilled red pepper this is great warm or cold.

Italian sizzler - Interesting thing about this platter is it includes fried pineapple (can you just imagine) and it tastes so good!! Filliand yummy too.

Well they surely serve the best dessert in town!

Philadelphia brownie cheese cake - wish it never ended!
Soft, creamy and super delicious cheese cake I've ever had in the recent times. Oreo played its role quite well. The final touch given by the chef made it look more adorable.
This one's a must try.üëç

This place located opposite to quest mall.  This place is one of the places which can manage crowd and food quality simultaneously.  I went on the night of Independence Day and the places was stuffed with people but still nawwarah managed to give us best quality and tasty food which was expected for kunal Gupta (owner)and his team . This place can be visited with people of all age group.  This place has the type of restraunt and desires off and one of the best lounge in kolkata.

The interiors and ambience is nice. Food is also good. BUT DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR CAR FOR VALET PARKING. My car was hit by something by the valet parking guy, (pretty sure it was him since there was no sign of it before) and I was not even informed by him. If someone does not know how to park, please don't give them your guest's vehicles.

The best thing about this place is the ambience. Very innovative and very different. Visited the lounge area of Nawwarah with Friends. 
Very friendly attendant - Gautam (I think so, not sure about the name)
Price-wise it is average. 
Food is good. Sheesha is great! 
Tried "The Milky Way" dessert. Turned out to be really nice :)
Lucknowi kebabs were yummilicious! 
Keep it up!!

My friend is obsessed with the place and certain dishes of theirs. Firstly he is a hardcore non-vegetarian and he loves the varieties they offer here. Today again he order mere boss ki favourite and Amritsari kulcha. As usual the food was up to great quality and finesse. The deserts are to die for.

As the name suggests, Nawwarah will give you a very antique vibe when you enter inside of it. Situated right opposite to Quest mall in mani square, it has two different doors for two different section of nawwarah. The first door on the right will take you to the dining room where you can eat your food peacefully. The second door on the left will take you to the lounge area where you can eat and smoke shisha at the same time. We obviously entered the second door. Be warned that this is a pure vegetarian restaurant/cafe, but to be more precise, its a jain restaurant/cafe but dont let that distract you from eating here, they make amazing food.

Upon entering, we were greeted warmly by the servers and we were escorted to the second floor, probably because it was pretty much empty at that point of time ( close to 10:30pm on sunday night ). Few tables were occupied and they were playing loud musics, which me and my friends completely dislike so some points gets deducted because of them. However, they were nice to reduce the volume when we requested for it.

Coming to the interior designing, it is brightly lit. The stairs have got lots of wall pictures hanging on them, and the feel is just absolutely pretty to watch and admire. The sofas are comfortable, so its a huge bonus point for anyone who wanna sit there and relax.

For food, we ordered for caesar salad, cheese balls, chocolate martini and Heineken for drinks, four cheese pizza and lastly, ended our food with Philadelphia cheesecake ( this one is the latest item but its not in their menu yet, so we were suggested this item by the servers ). Unfortunately, they do not have a wide range of alcohol and they have only one beer brand, i.e Heineken. The Philadelphia cheesecake is their latest invention, which is not yet mentioned the menu yet. Normally its just the cheesecake but now they renovated it with brownie and they applied the concept of nitrogen gas here. The cook brings chopped kitkal and mixes it with nitrogen in front of you. I absolutely loved the pizza and the cheeseballs a lot, the dessert was really good too. Martini was delicious. For shisha we ordered for a fruit chillam, which is mild in flavour. They dont choke at all so its pretty smoke. However, its a bit expensive. All that for rs3066 but it was worth it.

I suggest people who loves to eat, chill and smoke shisha to visit this place at least once. You wont be disappointed.

Worst experience ever!!!....we had ordered for lemon cilantro soup n tomato soup, mix sauce spagetti, corn florentine, jai n veeru paneer tikka.
Firstly we were served soup which was almost cold.After complaining they replaced the soup woth equally cold soup. Corn florentine was hot and tasty. Even after requesting to serve us hot food, we were served cold panner tikka and spagetti.At last we finally gave up and cancelled all our main course order and asked for bill. To our surprise they were just not guilty abt their service and we were immediatly provided wid the bill. Have never ever experienced such pathetic service.Had heard so much about this place and was eagerly waiting to visit here but tdays experience was very dissapointing.

WOW. Thats exactly what I said when I entered this beautiful place. :)

Yes NAWWARAH is a HEAVEN for all the vegetarians out there. Trust me on that coz I ended up Ordering JAIN FOOD. Yes my friend was in town and she wanted to have no-onion-garlic food.

AMBIANCE - I dont have words to describe.. They have done an incredible job with their interior. 5/5

FOOD - As I said we ended up ordering Jain food which turned out really good. We ordered CHOCOLATE MARTINI - didnt like the taste.. but very cute presentation .. SWEET 16 - I like the flavors of Orange-Minty-Ginger.. so I enjoyed it. Then ordered CHEESE VEGETABLE QUESADILLAS served with Sour Cream and PINEAPPLE SALSA - and we couldnt believe it was included in JAIN SPECIAL - SUPER YUMMY.. and that SALSA - was super yummy.. TOO GOOD..then we ordered one of the Mini Meals - PANEER KHURCHAN - Another pleasant surprise - It was real good considering there wasn't any onion-garlic in it.. Paneer was soft and loved the gravy.. Dal Makhni was so good. And to end this AMAZING MEAL we ordered MASALA CHAI ICE CREAM -- Umm the only thing that was a bit of disappointment.. the taste was really bland..!

SERVICE - VERY FRIENDLY and COURTEOUS..

POCKET FRIENDLY.

Please go and try out this amazing plade .. and I will definitely go try their PESTO PASTA ( Heard its really good) ;)

It surely lies among of one of our few favourites which serves GOOD food with Sheesha and booze.. 
The interiors have already been praised and they own it totally!!! 
I tried Nawarrah platter which had in store nice kebabs, roasted paneer and broccoli with onion salad and two different chutneys.. 
Along with Strawberry and Kiwi shake :- Mouth watery with perfect flavours..
Sheesha was just fine..

Place like Nawabi Mahel. You feel something is very Royal about the decoration, with chandeliers and table lamps and turqoise seating, and embellished walls. It is absolutely delightful and very elegant. Service is prompt and seemed good. Time taken us good.

Location is excellent and very easily accessible.

Food is a vegetarian's delight. A lot of options, which are exquisite. My top picks are Corn Tulips and the Risotto. Though I think the Risotto was a Little lightly flavored for my Indian palate.

¬†You have to visit nawarrah.

I visited this place with my siblings. I was instantly impressed with the decor and spacious interiors. Most of the caf√©s who serve hukka are dark and there is lot of smoke, but this place is lit up and designed in such a way that it will not bother the non smokers. Most of all I liked the painting on the ceiling. Its beautiful. Coming to food, we ordered amritsari kulcha and chole, Indian sizzler, quesadillas, cheese stuffed mushroom (from the dining section). The Indian food was delicious specifically the Dal makhani (must try). Quesadillas were not that great as I was expecting loads of cheese with dash of vegetables. But it turned out the other way round and far from the taste of an actual quesadilla served in the States. Service is good and quick. All in all its a must visit place. My second favorite cafe till now.

P. S. This place has nicer washrooms too!

Ordered 'Delhi ke paneer korma te rajma chawal' mini meal.. loved every bit of it..Also the quantity was perfect. And tried shisha of brainfreezer flavour. Also the hookah was nice and loved the music too. And liked the service too. An overall nice experience. Would love to visit again.

An amazing place to hang out with your friends and has great value for money. 
We went to the lounge section. 
I took a liking to this place as soon as I entered. I loved the decor. It has a very ethnic , royal and at the same time a vibrant feel . The swings used as chairs was a nice touch to this place. Colourful sofas and cushion for seating arrangements with mirrors all along the wall. Even the ceilings were colourful! 
Perfect for the young crowd. 
In terms of food, the ratio of quantity to price to quality of food is bang on. We ordered the Mezze platter for starters.  And the khao Suey and kung pao vegetables for main course . All the dishes were tasty. 
I really liked the music, but it was bit too loud for us. 
Overall our experience was great and I would definitely go back there to try out more food.

So, after a long wait, finally been to this place on Sunday.
I always wanted to visit this place because it is a vegetarian loungeüòÄ
Ordered Jalapeno Cheese poppers, Popcorn Mojito, Nawwarah platter and Paneer Khurchan.
Jalapeno Cheese Poppers was delicious.
Paneer khurchan was yummy.
I loved the Dal makhani. It was the best Dal Makhani that I have eaten till date.
Popcorn Mojito was served in a different manner. It was tasty.
I was only disappointed with the Nawwarah Platter. The Paneer tikka in it was extremely spicy and had less salt.
This place provides an excellent service. Beautiful decor! üòÄ
They also provided us with complementary vodka shots. But we all were non -alcoholic üòÄ
Loved Nawwarah.

When you think of having vegetarian food and you don't know where to go, you can close your eyes and drive off to Nawwarah. Located in Park Circus, just opposite the Qwest Mall, Kolkata, you will just get amazed to see this place as it is beautifully decorated. The service is pretty excellent and the food is excellent. Starting from the starters like ice-tea to paneer tikka to the main course of Sizzlers and other things, the food rocked it. Then comes the desserts. The desserts were extremely delicious and the mango cheese cake was just superb. :)

INTRODUCTION & LOCATION: I don't know whether "Ache Din" as promised by Government has arrived for you or not but quite surprisingly its a definite ache din for the vegans of Kolkata. Nawwarah a pure veg hub is here to serve you with some delightful dinning and eating experience. There have been hundreds of Veg Restaurants around the city of joy but it has been truly difficult to contain such huge expectations from the People of Kolkata towards the find of some exciting veg dishes. Location has something which is a true find for them, Opposite to the Quest Mall at the Syed Amir Ali avenue, Ballygunge.
AMBIANCE AND STAFF : Have you seen a palace? If no then Nawwarah is ready and built like a palace for you. From the main entrance things are really interesting. Actually there are two entrances 1. which goes to the Hukkah and lounge which is built in two floors 2. Another is the Fine Diner where you can have your Meal actually. The lounge part is really big and spacious with colorful walls and Jhumars and those comfortable sittings whereas the fine diner is truly fine and it gives u a luxurious feel of being eating at a King's Palace. Staffs are really fast and quick, smiling and always eyes on you on what you need.

FOOD AND DRINKS :

1. Masala Iced tea - I have tried Masala Iced tea in so many places but couldn't get better than this. This was absolute refreshing and a perfect thirst buster, Gosh! they are very limited on their drinks menu but they are bang on target. 8/10

2. Mushroom Burger : This place is versatile and knows what the current gen needs and requires. Mushrooms are surprisingly similar in taste and texture to meat when cooked, so they are the perfect ingredient for vegetarian veggie burgers! Mushroom is been favorite of many and it came in between the buns that dragged attention. And trust my words they are very good at making this burger. (RECOMMENDED) 9/10
                    

3. Green Thai Curry : I am not a Green that Curry guy for sure because the kind of experiences i had with those curries i had it gave me a Green Thai curry Phobea.¬† After having this Curry my concept for green curry has changed. From the presentation to the aroma of coconut in the Thai curry everything was just fabulous.

Nawarrah marked its presence with its glamourous interior and a solution for all the vegeterians in the city of joy.
As you enter the place I bet you will be mesmerized with its interiors. The vibrant ceilings, the artistic furniture, the beautiful pictures in the wall ,everything lifted up the mood.
Now talking about the food. Firstly, I would say it is the one of the best vegeterian fine dining places of Kolkata.
Tried a lot of stuffs in my visit:
# Masala Iced Tea
# Virgin Mohito
# Cheese Garlic Bread
# Mushroom Burger
# Green Thai Curry
# Shashlik
# Strawberry Galaxy
# Mango Cheese Cake

I loved their quality of food and the presentation. It allured me when it came to the table.
Spcial recommendations for few items:
# Cheese Garlic Bread : It was amazing, the best one I have ever had
# Mushroom Burger: The mushroom patty was delicious. The flavour was coming out well.
# Green Thai Curry: I am little fond of this particular dish. So a bit biased. But it was excellent.
# Mango Cheese Cake: A very balanced dessert. Not too sweet and tasted superb.

A must visit place for everyone in the city.
I bet it wont be your first and last time.

The house of Nawwarah, standing just opposite to quest, is gem in the new vegetarian places of Kolkata. 
Been to this place a couple of days ago and was stunned by the experience we had. 

Location : since it's just opposite to quest, you bet it's easily accessible. And you can never miss the gorgeous logo. 

Ambiance: 3 storay place, having the fine dine restaurant at the ground floor and lounge at he rest. When you enter the place the pleasing yet royal decor will take your heart away. It's really a breathtaking place. The staircase studded with amazing paintings. The lounge with trunks being used as tables, chairs with mosaic works and wooden jhoolas. Lovely!

Service : really courteous service, it's hard to find such well behaved staff these days. Though the foods came a lil late but they were worth a wait. 

Food: I will describe every item, individually. ..

Masala iced tea: one gem of a drink. A must try. Iced tea still having the kick of masala is worth many tries.

Virgin mojito: a must for me when I visit a place. This too didn't disappoint me

Paneer multani tikka : paneer with zingy mustard. This rustic tikka gives you a perfect Taste of the Punjabi and Rajasthani cuisine 

Cheesygarlic bread: a must must try. Fresh garlic bread with trough full of molten cheese served with dip. Mouth watering cheesy goodness 

Mushroom burger: if the fungi do not choke you, this is a must try. The patty was full of Umami, soft inside and crispy out side. Served with fries, spicy mayo and greens. .

Thai green curry: one of the best Thai dishes I had . The curry with all Thai flavours ( I am curious how they managed to replace shrimp paste ) , creamy coconut milk , veggies and a portion of sticky rice. Lovely. 

Mango cheesecake: Nawwarah and its desserts. This is a new addition to their menu. And it was perfect. I mean how can you go wrong with cheesecakes. 

This place has completely stolen my heart. Will definitely go back.

The three storied lounge cum family restaurant located bang opposite to Quest Mall is becoming the next go-to place for all vegetarian food lovers. Came here yesterday with a few friends of mine to have a chat over some good food and drinks. 
The first thing about Nawwarah that comes to your mind is the amazing ambience. Floral printed couches and swings in the lounge and the very gorgeous family dining area will surely catch your eyes. If you're a photomaniac, then be sure that Nawwarah provides you with lots of photo and selfie points all doted up with a Moroccan/Mediterranean decor.  
Next comes food. We had a lot of stuffs. They are - 
Drinks - 
Popcorn Mojito - This drink was a visual treat. Served on a base of liquid nitrogen, and topped with popcorn, the drink was very nice. Liked the taste of it. 
Masala Iced Tea - Tasted pretty good. Balance of the masala and the flavour of tea was perfect. 
Cold Coffee - Although this didn't look visually lucrative, nonetheless it tasted good. 
Cutting Chai - I was wondering why would my friends order this at a posh place like Nawwarah. I am not a tea person, so won't be able to judge it. It was good as they told me. 
Virgin Mojito - Tasted really good. There's nothing extraordinary that can be done with this drink. It was pretty good. 
Appetisers - 
Multani Paneer Tikka - Typical Indian kebabs made out of paneer. A bit spicy though, the chutneys were nice otherwise. 
Mushroom Burger - The patty made of saut√©ed mushrooms came with fries and mayo. The patty tasted good. 
Cheese Garlic Bread - This is the best thing I had that after. It was so gooey. The cheese inside the garlic bread shaped out like a boat was very delicious. 
I was in hurry, hence I had to leave without the main course and ordered desserts for myself directly. 
Desserts - 
Strawberry Galaxy - Presentation was brilliant. Tasted very good. 
Mango Cheesecake - Another brilliant dessert from the house of Nawwarah. Came with Vanilla Ice Cream, tasted even better. 
Mango Sunrice Delight - It looked beautiful. I am not a very big fan of payas although. It's almost the same thing only with the mango flavour. You can try if you love payas. 
Overall experience was nice. Service was prompt and courteous. Loved the place. Recommended to veggie people for sure. Happy Dining! :)

Was hearing a lot about this place from a long time, and finally managed to step in! 

The interiors were fabulous. The service was kind of slow. The food was good though.

The best part of the whole thing was the Cheese Garlic Bread, Cheese Fondue and the desserts, Mango Cheesecake and Strawberry Galaxy.

The Mushroom Burger was good too. Fries as the accompaniment was crispy and smelled good. 

Recommended.

The sheer size of this restaurant had intimidated me ever since its inception. But sadly I did not have an opportunity to visit this place until yesterday. So mr and my friends decided to check out what the hype was all about over a lunch meetup. 

Since we were all in no hurry, we decided to take our time and make the best out of this visit. 

Upon entering, I was blown away! Gosh, how can a place be so beautiful? Starting from the main door, to the stairs, each and every intricate thing is a piece of art. The colourful ambience immediately lifted my already high spirit. Sadly, since the place was quite full, I could not sit on their "jhula", but all the other seats were equally pleasing too. 

The humidity had made us all thirsty to the brim which we decided to battle by ordering a fair share of drinks. 

We started off by opting for the Masala Iced Tea which unlike certain places, did not taste bad at all. I loved it.

Now that we had satiated our thirst, we decided to order the starters. For starters we had :

‚óá Cheese Garlic Bread - Ah, it was by far the best garlic bread that I have ever tasted so far. The cheese simply oozed out and melted in my mouth. Love love love it.

‚óá Paneer Multani Tikka - The quantity of the dish was quite good and the paneer chunks were really big and soft. It came with two different dips. Taste-wise I would say it was average. But my veggie friend seemed to like it a lot.

‚óá Mushroom Burger - This was another stunner. It came with its own dip and french fries. Best veg burger till date.

 All of the above was accompanied by Cold Coffee which was decent.

Now for the Main Course, we decided to go for the following options :

‚óá Green Thai Curry - The curry came with steamed rice and was full of flavour.

‚óá Cheese Steak - The steak came with its tasty accompaniments and tingled all my taste buds perfectly.

‚óá Shashlik - Have tried out this dish at quite a few restaurants, but this one remains my favourite of the lot. The herbs and masala and the batter in which the paneer, potato and pineapple were coated was absolutely bomb.

To quench our thirst we also had the Virgin Mojito which was refreshing and pleasant.

Now the Desserts! We opted for three of their desserts :

‚óá Strawberry Galaxy - Firstly, the presentation was beautiful. It tasted really good. Tangy and Sweet. Loved it.

‚óá Sunrice Delight - It came with the most fresh looking mango I have EVER seen and most sweet too. It also had kheer with cream surrounding it and tasted really good.

‚óá Mango Cheesecake - This was my favourite out of the three. It has cheeseeeeee, duh!. The cheesecake came with mango toppings alongside vanilla icecream. The perfect summery dessert I would say.

To sum it up i would like to say that the visit was worth it and the service surprisingly great. The prices are on the higher side ofcourse, but its definitely worth a visit. I am definitely looking forward to another visit soon.

A vegetarian's paradise, Nawwarah is situated just opposite quest mall. A quintessential place with lip-smacking food. 
Visited this place with a bunch of friends. Though most of us are non-vegetarians, we did not miss chicken or fish even for a bit. The food was that good!
We began our food journey with 'Cutting Chai' which was good. 
Then we had Virgin Mojito, Masala Iced Tea and Cold Coffe. All the three were very refreshing and is perfect for summer. 
For starters we ordered Cheese Garlic Bread, Mushroom Burger and Paneer Multani Tikka. The garlic bread stole my heart it was so cheesy and so good even the mushroom burger was amazing. The paneer was good too. 
For the main course we ordered Cheese Fondue, Thai Green Curry, Cheese Steak and Shashlik. I loved each of the items especially the thai green curry. One of the best I have had till date. 
For the desserts we ordered Mango Sunrise Delight, Mango Cheesecake and Strawberry Galaxy. All the desserts had excellent presentation and tasted so good. 
I would recommended all the non-vegetarians to try the place out and I am sure they wouldn't miss chicken, fish or any other meat even for a bit üòÄ

Located right opposite the Quest mall,this place will blow your mind. Its a  three storeyed restaurant and lounge offering a wide range of pure vegetarian delicacies. Their ambience is by far the best I have seen in any fine dining restaurant. Huge chandeliers,beautiful swings,luxurious and comfortable couches,cute panda soft toys,mirrors : everything that you can ask for will definitely be here. Coming to the food , we had : 

1. Popcorn mojito : The flavour of popcorn in a mojito is totally unexpected. But it was so refreshingly amazing. 

2. Cutting chai : Tea served in small glasses. A quintessential beverage. 

3. Cheese garlic bread: This is definitely the best cheese garlic bread I EVER had. They did no misery with the amount of cheese and it melted in my mouth tickling every taste bud.

4. Paneer multani tikka : Huge cubes of paneer grilled in delicious spices. This was very filling. 

5. Cheese fondue : Warm gooey cheese fondue served with 5 different palate cleansers. It was so tasty. The quantity was great too. 

6. Thai green curry : This was my favourite main course of the day. Sticky rice served with a spicy green curry loaded with vegetables. We polished our plates off in no time. 

7. Strawberry galaxy : Ice cream, chocolate and few other things that I cant really name! But all of it tastes beautiful together. The presentation was great too.

8. Mango sunrice delight : A coconut based rice kheer,whipped cream and fresh ripe mango. This was the best mango dessert I ever had. 

The staff were very co-operating. The experience was truly amazing!

I have been here for like 4 times both in the lounge and dining area. Just love the food they serve.  Though I didn't like North Indian of the dining area but they have some amazing mini meals in the lounge and desserts.
So coming to the part I liked about Nawwarah is it's amazing decor. The lounge section is spacious and the staircase area has been beautifully decorated.  Though the dining area is little congested and cannot really accommodate a large group.
I specifically love Nazza in the starters and Kung Pao Meal in the mini meal section.  These two are my favorite dishes from this place and I make a point that my friends try that too. Mocktails are also nice.  I tried "dark chocolate milkshake",  "chocolate martini" and "safe sex on the beach".
Now what I don't like about this place that they don't take reservations . It is really difficult to choose a place specially for dinner without making a reservation. I tried Milky way this time twice and they have reduced it's quality to a very surprising level.  They have started giving only chocolate sauce and brownies.  Last time they provided with many other cream flavors like caramel, strawberry, etc. It was worthless for me to pay for milky way because it has literally nothing in it.  I loved it before so I ordered it again this time and it was a total waste of money. 
All over I do like this place a lot. But there are few things that they should try to improve to become the best place for food and ambience in Kolkata.

It's a jain restaurant. A pure veg restaurant. For a meat lover like me. I wasn't very keen on going there.
As my mother chose this place on her birthday had no other option to be honest.
A very nice interior for fine dining experience. Not very noisy. 
Coming to the food. Ordered veg lasagna, cheese naan and kadai paneer. 
Veg lasagna was great. So much cheese and perfctly baked. 
The cheese naans were too sweet like having 1 or 2 is fine if more than that it would be too sweet for your taste bud.  
Not a fan of indian dishes and especially with paneer but still the kadai paneer was very likable.

Discovered this place with my friends one fine day. Situated just opposite to Quest Mall & beside Domino's Beck Bagan. 
Being a pure non-vegetarian soul, I somehow loved this vegetarian outlet. It is a three stored building with pretty fancy interior. I looooooved the ambience. The day we visited this place, there was an acoustic night going on, making the ambience and our visit more pleasant. I'm pretty much satisfied with the taste of the food.  

We ordered:
Sheesha, Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Veg Pan Fried Dimsum, Chocolate Martini & two other mocktails. 

The staffs were friendly aswell. 

Kudos to team Nawwarah üëå

This place had been on my bucket list for quite some time and finally i had the chance to visit. I had set my expectations high for this place and i wasnt disappointed . Right from entering the place we were amazed. The minute details , decor, and the ambience were something we loved. As were going towards the lounge , we loved the side walls of the stairs and the seating hall with the sofa and mirrors on the wall were something we were in awe off.
Coming to the food, were a group of 10 , we ordered Mumbaiya sandwich , Paneer khurchan , Italian sphagetti , Mere boss ka favourite, Delhi ke paneer korna te rajma chawal and Havmor vegetable tawa pulao . Each of which was splendid and we enjoyed every bite to the zenith.
Mumbaiya sandwich - Beautifully served in a wooden pan with salad, chutney and a sweet small bucket of fries. The cabbage salad was fresh and crisp. The fries and chutney were pretty good. And the sandwich was very tasty , such a blended taste of the fillings.

Paneer khurchan - Paneer scrapped with onion and dal makhani with baby nan. Very tasty and quite filling .

Italian sphagetti - This sphagetti in white sauce was awesome . Served in a very presentable manner . The taste kept lingering in our mouth.

Mere boss ka favourite - This was the mini meal that i had ordered and no doubt it was the favourite ofvthe lot. Cheese nan was delicious . The paneer was so yummy and the gravy was relishing , aloo do pyaza was marvellous and we kept enjoying each bite we took.

Delhi ke paneer korma te rajma chawal - A filling meal with assorted rice , paneer korma was our favourite  and rajma was good too.

Havmor vegetable tawa pulao - This Ahmedabadi pulao was served with aloo dam and was equally tasty. The pulao was well assorted and each spoon would keep us wondering about the ingredients.

We had a lovely experience and i would suggest everyone to visit this place .

Very Extravagant ambiance. Very Nawab. You feel something is very Royal about the decoration, with chandeliers and table lamps and turqoise seating, and embellished walls. It is absolutely delightful and very elegant. Service is prompt and seemed good. Time taken us average.
Location is excellent and very easily accessible.
Food is a vegetarian's delight. A lot of options, which are exquisite. My top picks are Corn Tulips and the Risotto. Though I think the Risotto was a Little lightly flavored for my Indian palate. The Chocolate Martini way nice though just a facier Chocolate Shake.
In all, it is a must go to place on your list. You have to visit nawarrah.

This Place is located bang opposite Quest ! It is one the best vegetarian places I've been to! And it is so colourful and great! The ambience would definitely win everyone's heart!
We order chhole kulche and the Thai Bowl ! 
And the food was delicious and not very pricey
If you're a dessert lover this is probably the best place for you! They have a great variety of desserts but they are sort of over priced ! 
Over a great place with a super cool ambience and cute little Pandas üêº

This is one of the best cafes in the Ballygunge area, not only in terms of food but also in accordance with the decor and hospitality. Had visited this place with some friends a week back.
The mocktails here are quite different and unique. Both the taste and presentation are top notch. We tried Sweet 16, Atomic Cat, Safe Sex on The Beach and Virgin Mojito. All of them were pretty good.
Coming to the starters, Lakhowi Tunde Kebab, Saut√©ed Mushrooms and Steamed Dimsums stole the show.
The Four Cheese Pizza here is out of this world and definitely deserves a special mention.
The desserts are of another level altogether.
Mango Pannacotta and Black White Chocolate Mousse were my favourites. One should also try the Macaroon Platter.
Kulfi lovers should try the Kesariya Basundi Kulfi with Paan Ice Cream.

Being a meat lover, I am not at all fond of vegetarian food. But visiting this place has changed my opinions and I have somewhat fallen for vegetarian food.
Nawwarah is an authentic vegetarian restaurant bang opposite to Quest Mall. This restaurant has a dining area as well as a hookah lounge. It is very spacious with 3 floors. The first thing that will attract everyone is the ambience - the beautiful decor of this place is one of its kind. The colourful walls, decorated with mirrors and lights of different shapes and sizes. This place provides positive energy and will compel you to come back everytime. 
I went with a group of friends and we sat at the hookah lounge as we were keen on trying their hookah. The menu is uniquely designed and the food inclusions are innovative, the mocktails have unique and catchy names, the hookah menu is also experimental. They have different sections in their menu. We ordered -
1.Pancakes- The breakfast menu includes these pancakes which are served with chocolate and honey dips. The pancakes are soft and the dips compliment them really well.
2. Parathas- we had aloo paratha and cheese paratha which were stuffed with the perfect quantity of aloo cheese blended with Indian spices. They are served with dahi and pickles. 
3. Safe Sex on The Beach- this is a mocktail which is as unique as its name suggests. The sleak glass and the wine reddish coloured drink is presented in a classy manner and tastes heavenly.
4. Virgin Mojito - The typical virgin mojito mocktail is served in a very unique way in a glass pot with smoke coming out. This mocktail proves that they have put in a lot of effort to present each and every item in their menu.
5. Four cheese pizza - this is a thin crust pizza which is as cheesy as it could get. Tastes amazing and is served on a wooden tray.
6. Nawwarah platter- an assorted kebab platter which includes malai broccoli tikka, paneer tikka and tandoori aloo. Each and every bit of the dish tastes great. Perfectly cooked and a must order.
7. Steamed dimsum- Who can say no to dimsums? They aren't the usual steamed dimsums. Served with soup and spicy sauce. The dimsums are soft and juicy. 
8. Mumbaiya sandwich - these sandwiches are heavy and filling. The fillings include mashed aloo and vegetables with coriander and spices mixed in a perfect combination. 
9. Lucknowi tunde kebab- these are pan fried kebabs topped with green chutney. The kebabs are well cooked with crispy layer outside and soft and juicy inside. The chutney completes the dish.
10.Sauteed mushroom- This dish has mushrooms perfectly cooked and mixed with spices and served with a bread. The mushrooms taste heavenly and you won't mind repeating the dish.
11. Macaroon platter- Macaroons are love. Also, Nawwarah is famous for its  desserts. If you have their macaroon platter, it will surely take your breath away. They are soft and filled with strawberry sauce inside which melts in your mouth as you take a bite. The whitish chewy layer with the liquid will transform you to a different world.
12. Kesariya basundi kulfi with paan icecream and foam- two scoops of kulfi and foam makes it look as good as it tastes. The pan icecream has all the ingredients used to make a paan. The basundi kulfi is thick and delicious. The foam is an added bliss.
13. Mango pannacotta - this dessert is served in a cocktail glass with layers of thick mango and other fillings. It's filling and one can be shared by 2-3 people.
14. Black white chocolate mousse - a typical chocolate mousse can be turned to such a unique dessert can only be seen here. Served in a glass with layers of white and black chocolate and crushed choco crunches makes you taste heaven for a moment. 
Nawwarah being a vegetarian restaurant is surely to make its mark in the long run which it has already accomplished. The ambience is top notch. The 3 floored dining cum hookah lounge is spacious. The service is commendable and the staff are very cordial in their behaviour. The presentation of the dishes couldn't have been better, gets full marks certainly. Now, the main part, the dishes are delicious and as tasty as they could get. From the mocktails to the breakfast, to the starters and finally to the desserts menu, they have given equal attention in presenting the dishes as best as they could. The taste, presentation and quantity as well as quality is A++
The price is quite reasonable and affordable. Everything about this place is so positive that it will compel you to visit this restaurant again and again. Highly recommended!

One of the most vibrant and prettily decorated places I have ever been. 
Finally ticked it off with my friends. 
We chose the lounge area to chill. 
For drinks, we selected :- Popcorn mojito, Virgin mojito, Safe sex on the beach, Sweet sixteen and Atomic cat. 
I would recommend the popcorn mojito and sweet sixteen. 
We ordered cheese and aloo parathas , and pancakes which were served with chocolate and honey dip and fresh fruits. Both were perfection. 
From the starter menu, we settled for Mumbaiya sandwich, lakhowi kebabs, Mezze Platter, Nawwarah platter, Steamed dimsums, Sauteed Mushrooms with garlic bread and Four cheese pizza. 
I cannot complain a tinge about anything in the food because they were presented so well and tasted amazing. Loved their pizza and mushrooms .. And Meade platter was hit. 
For desserts, we tried to cover as much as possible by ordering for Mango Pannacotta , Dark and White chocolate mousse, Raspberry Macaroons, and the Kesari Basundi kulfi served along with paan kulfi and paan foam garnished with jalebi caviars. 
Mousse was my personal favourite. 

They also have a wide range of shisha to select from. 
A perfect ambience to chill and have fun.

Nawwarah, which means "newborn" in Arabic stands for brightness and radiance and this place does true justice to it's name both in terms of food and decor.

The restaurant is sectioned in two parts - the main
restaurant and the lounge for all those hokaah lovers! I have been to both.
The decor, especially in the lounge, literally had my mind blown the first time. It is bright, colourful and spacious - a friendly, playful ambiance that will surely give you strong positive vibes.
With the restaurant, on the other hand, gives you a more relaxing ambiance perfect for a royal lunch/dinner with family.

Talking about food in this all-vegetarian place, we had a number of starters with drinks and some among us decided to try the Shisha.

Drinks had:
Safe Sex On The Beach, Virgin Mojito, Atomic Cat, Popcorn Mojito and Sweet 16.
My personal pick would be the Atomic Cat which was an orange and lemon based drink and Popcorn Mojito. Even the Safe Sex On The Beach was a great mocktail for the cranberry lovers!

Starters had :
Nawwarah Platter - The platter consisted of three types of assorted kebabs. Paneer Tikka, Tandoori Stuffed Aloo and Malai Broccoli Tikka. Stuffed Aloo was my pick.
Mezze Platter - This one had Zaater Bread which was like papad naan, tikka kind of round roasted kebabs and fritter-like Cheese Chizzling which was stuffed with american corn and cheese. Yum!
Steamed Dim sum - Loved the soup that accompanied with it. So full of flavours!
Sauteed Mushroom - Served with Garlic Bread, this dish could've been better.
Four Cheese Pizza - Cheesy thin Crust Pizzas with an absolutely perfect base is what everyone wants. LOVED IT!

Now coming to best part of the lunch, the NAWWARAH DESSERTS!
Mango Panacotta - Top notch presentation for this one! It even tasted amazing but just not sure if this dessert can be called a panacotta. It had a smooth yogurt portion and mango topped with biscuit crumbs and caramel crystals. Sweetness was in perfect balance which leaves you wanting for more.
Black White Chocolate Mousse - Mentionable presentation again with distinctive layers of both white and dark chocolate mousse and topped with tiny brownie pieces which was, kind of, really hard. Not being a fan of white chocolates, I was enjoying the layer beneath. Such a heavenly dessert!
Kesariya Basundi Kulfi with Pan Ice Cream and Foam - Curse me for this but I'm not much in favour of Kulfis. Yes, you read that right! Presentation again, was very beautiful. Pan Ice Cream was good.
Macarons - Since it was a platter, I thought it would be a combination of assorted macarons but no, it was only three Raspberry Cream-filled Macarons.
It was good but I've had better raspberry macaroons elsewhere.

Undoubtedly, an amazing experience. Nawwarah is definitely on the rising in terms of popularity. Ambiance, vegetarian food, drinks and desserts - the management is surely doing a great job! Best wishes.

I have never really shared a friendly relation with vegetarian food, and then came nawwarah, and then came my change of opinion! Followed by happiness and gastronomic satisfaction. 

Located bang opposite to quest mall, this place leaves no scope for error or mismanagement when it comes to decor, hospitality, prompt service, courtesy and you are bound for a visual treat once you enter this place. There is a certain degree of grandeur which you are bound to feel once you take your seat and begin to get a feel of the place! I shall leave you to be the judge of that, let's go on to the main attraction of this place, the food! 

This place really knows how to pamper it's guests with their mocktails. The preparation and the presentation was top notch. The taste was unparalleled. We tried the safe sex on the beach - quirky name, even quirkier in taste, the sweet 16 - it felt like an emotion, the virjin mojito - the style quotient was overwhelming and the atomic cat.  Each and every mocktail was brilliantly prepared and is a must try definitely. 

We mainly decided to stick to the starters, which were more than sufficient to dissuade us for any main course orders!  Among the starters, the nawwarah platter and the mezze platter stood out according to me in terms of presentation, quality, quantity and satisfaction. The mumbaiya sandwich packed alot of punch, the steamed dimsums brought in some diversity amongst the starters, the lakhowi tunde kabab was a sheer delicacy and the four cheese pizza - i could actually point out the presence of four types of cheese, it was brilliant!  

If you're a desert person, this is one such place you cannot afford to miss! Keeping the taste aside, i was awestruck with the presentation and visual appeal of the dishes that we had ordered. The mango pannacotta was so refreshing, i literally craved for more! The black white chocolate mousse was a treat to have! The macaroon platter was a visual delight, i had it in one gulp so you can guess the taste and the kesariya basundi kulfi with pan ice cream and foam - this was my favourite out of the lot! 

We tried two items from their breakfast menu on their suggestion, namely, pancakes and paranthas. Both were brilliant!  

After my experience at nawwarah, my love for vegetarian food has reached new heights literally. This place is a must visit!  Oh not to forget, they serve hookah too and drinks on weekends!

For a hardcore carnivore like me visiting some vegetarian restaurant is a turn down at times. But what if the place is something amazing, colourful and vivid.
And one such place is 'Nawwarah'.

The location is so perfect, bang opposite of Quest mall, parkcircus. And the outlet is spread over a 3-storied building. If you want to visit the restaurant you need to enter through the right door and if you want to go to the lounge, upstairs you need to take the left door.

Nowadays few vegetarian fine dining restaurants are opening in the city which are serious in their business. And that's a good sign. The decor is super posh and it's one of the USP's of the place. The place reflect how much planning and tones of effort they have put in. From staircase to the sitting arrangements, it's fabulous.

We were served a set menu and mocktails came in first. Look-wise they are amazing and taste wise they were equally good.
1. Safe sex on beach ( of course the mocktail version of the original and the famous one)
2. Virgin mojito - always the classic
3. Sweet 16
4. Atomic cat
5.popcorn mojito

From the breakfast menu we had
1. Pancakes - gorgeous looking pancakes served with maple syrup and chocolate syrup.
2. Parathas served with yoghurt and pickles.

The food was a large spread. For starters we had..
1. Nawwarah Platter- the kebab platter was good with paneer tikka, stuffed mushrooms, tandoori stuffed aloo and broccoli. Definitely try this one.

2. Steamed dimsum- who don't like dimsum? It's everyones favourite.

3. Sauteed mushrooms.

4. Mumbaiya sandwich- the sandwich was nothing special. It was okaish.

5. Lucknowi tunde kebab

6. Four cheese pizza- it was heaven. Definitely look out for this one.

After a perfect starter and a set of mocktails we were almost full and skipped the main course. And went for the desserts. And there's always enough room left for desserts.

1. Mango pannacota - any mango lovers will go gaga for this one. Highly recommended.

2. Black and white chocolate mousse.

3. Macaroon platter.

4. Kesariya basundi kulfi with pan ice-cream and foam - this one was absolute delight.

Definitely had an awesome time out there. And would ask any vegan to visit this place. Even the carnivores do try.

Cheers team Nawwarah!

Veg Cuisine Does not get better than This.Conviniently located bang opposite Quest Mall its hard not to notice.The interiors will have you awestruck and we were lucky enough to visit both the lounge and the restaurant.

Virgin Mojito-served on a kettle filled with liquid no2.
Sweet 16-A sweet sutble drink with float like ice cream foam on top.
Atomic Cat - An orange fizzy drink.

Lakhowi Tunde Kebab
Steamed Dimsum-The sauce was really nice.
Mezze Platter-More like veg galawati kebab
Sauted Mushroom
Mumbaiya Sandwich-Must try.
Four Cheese Pizza-Liked it a lot.

Mango Pannacotta-More like Mango Mousse with ample mango pieces in it.
Black White Chocolate Mousse

Being a non-vegetarian, going to Vegetarian places is a big No-No in general, but with all the vegetarian places offering such delicious desserts, I really didn't want to miss out on the experience.

My review may be a bit incomplete since I only had mocktails and desserts, along with the Four Cheese Pizza (which infact was great!!).

Mocktails:
1. Safe Sex on the Beach : Yes, it's totally safe to have this and is quite a refreshing drink.
2. Sweet 16 : Good one, but the others were better since I found it to be too sweet.
3. Virgin Mojito : My all-time favourite drink! And the presentation was top notch!
4. Popcorn Mojito : Lovely flavour, topped with popcorns. Again, lovely presentation!
5. Atomic Cat : The taste wasn't as good as the name suggested, but worth a try.

Desserts:
1. Mango Pannacotta : I am not sure if they got the Pannacotta right, but this one tasted GREAT! One of my recommendations.
2. Black White Chocolate Mousse : The dark chocolate flavour hits hard, but the biscuit crumbs on top complement it beautifully.
3. Macroon Platter : Delicious raspberry macaroons! SHEER LOVE!
4. Kesariya Basundi Kulfi with Paan Ice cream and Foam : The decoration is sure to take your breath away! And it also tastes pretty good!

I don't take Shisha, but my friends who took it said that it was pretty amazing too.

But what blew me away completely was the superb decor of the place. It is bound to leave you awestruck, and you can get that feeling of royalty - whether you're sitting on the swings, relaxed on the sofa, walking down the stairs, or just staring at the beautiful interiors. And this has definitely influenced my high ratings.

So, overall predict : Do visit the place and even if you're a non-vegetarian, am sure you can pay a visit just for the desserts and they won't disappoint you!

Bengalis love their meat and fish and they accept everything which includes either meat or fish. But with the passing time we have also accepted vegetarian foods as well. Earlier there were no such as fine dine vegetarian restuarants but with gradual evolution, we treasured some of the best veg food joints in kolkata. Nawwarah is among those vegetarian restuatants which has not only excelled their food quality but with appearance as well. Being a hard core non-vegetarian i was a bit skeptical but they have proven me wrong completely by their service and food.

I visited this place for lunch with some of my friends. The place is opposite Quest Mall and you wont find it difficult to locate it. Before heading towards the food we had, let me give you a glimpse of the decor. It was a delight to watch the decor they had put up. Its a cafe cum restuarant so the left part is the cafe part and the right consist of a fine dine restuarant. The walls were decorated with mirrors and there were two swings which were a treat to the eyes.

Now coming to the food, well we had a plethora of foods. Lets start the journey without any delay.

From the breakfast portion, we had

Parathas: the parathas were served with yogurt and a spicy yet tangy anchar. I loved the parathas. They were simply yumm if you have it lonely or with the yogurt and aanchar.

Pancakes: these cute mini sized pancakes were served with syrup and chocolate sauce. The pancakes were smooth and soft and it just melts in your mouth. #Recommended

After these we had some mocktails and we had

Sweet16: this was based on orange with a hint of ginger. It was quite refreshing and had a soothing flavour.

Virgin Moijto: it was simple mocktail which was really refreshing and good.

Atomic cat: this was good too. The taste was really good.

Safe sex on the Beach: well i love anything which has cranberry and this mocktail was simply perfect. I loved it. A perfect mocktail after you arrive from a hot day.

In between these mocktails, we definately munched some lipsmacking starters which were simple mouth-watering

Nawwarah Platter: this platter consists of malai broccoli, paneer tikka and tandoori aloo. Each and every item were totally lipsmacking and among these my favourite was the tandoori aloo.

Lakhnowi tunde kebab: these were round sized kebabs which were spicy and with the green chutney it was simple good. Those who love spice in their food, this dish wont deceive them.

Steamed Dimsum: another dish which was beautiful. The dimsums were juicy and the dip was yumm.

Mezze Platter: you should try this one. It consists of bread, kurkure and cheese chizzling with three dips and each were one of a kind. You simply cannot miss this one.

Sauteed Mushroom: i like mushrooms but Nawwarah made it sure that i turn my likings into love. Well yes i loved their sauteed mushrooms. It was served with a bread. The combination is just something which is just beautiful. #Recommended

Mumbaiya Sandwich: the sandwiches were quite filling and was lovely.

Four Cheese Pizza: can anyone go wrong with four cheese pizza? I bet no. I loved it to its brim.

We were absolutely full by now but hey its Nawwarah and we cannot miss their popular and well known desserts they serve. How can we miss them. What we had i was totally bowled away by their desserts and i can live on those desserts my entire life

Mango Panncotta: if you are a mango lover you should try this. Mango at its best. It consists of mango cubes, pannacotta,crumb and mango gel. Pannacotta was smooth and light. The mango flavour was beautiful and was going at par with it. A beautiful combination. #Recommended

Black white chocolate mousse: when i had the first bite, i was transported to heaven directly. If you really wanna know how heaven feels like, try this and oh yes thank me later. #Recommended

Macaroon Platter: forget about every macaroons you have had so far because the macaroons served here are the best i had in town. They were soft and just melts in your mouth. #Recommended

Kesariya Basundi kulfi with pan ice cream: we had it lastly. Loved the pan ice cream and the kulfi. They were full of flavours. # Recommended

I loved this place and you wont be disappointed if you give a visit to this place. Should i come back? 100% yes without even the slightest hesitation.

A fine dine and lounge, located just opposite quest mall, an outlet by the Ganpati Caterers. Full marks for the ambiance, it makes you feel as if you are in a palace in Rajasthan.¬†
Coming to the food, i had a visit today itself and i had gone there to try the breakfast menu. The overall experience was good. Double layered cheese focaccia open sandwich is yummy, a must try. Momo's in a breakfast menu, an absolute delight for the momo lovers which was also tasty.
Who likes a paratha that's not tucked up with a lot of filling? Less of cheese in the Cheese Paratha and less paneer in the Paneer ones.
¬†No Kachori Sabzi! No Tea! No Coffee! Breakfast without tea or coffee, Really?¬†
¬†They have pancakes in their menu but it can't match the delight of having a Jalebi or Gulab Jamun especially for the morning meal.
They miss a lot of items in the breakfast menu and should add them asap.
Overall a nice experience. It's worth your time and money.

wow wow wow...... Finally visited this new trending resto. Loved the decor- very quirky and classy. Ordered:

Four Cheese Pizza- Couldn't see the 4 diff types of cheese as it's name was based on. Apparently, on being asked, the waiter said the cheese had been mixed up so it was not visible separately. Nevertheless, it was delicious.

Milky way- Absolutely loved the presentation and the concept. The brownies tasted ...

It has a unique and pleasant ambience. Full marks on the way it is designed. I ordered an Arrabbiata pasta which was a bit spicy but was good. Next thing on my table was Nazza which was basically dal makhani and baked naan topped with cheese that tasted great. Nachos & pizza where even nice. Definitely a place to revisit and full value for money.

I've been here on a weekday. The decor will blow your mind. It's extremely captivating. The food is nice. The service is a bit slow. We waited easily 20 minutes for our sheesha despite the place being half empty. It's a new place so I'm sure it will improve its service speed. The desserts here are innovative and beautifully presented. The chef playing the dessert in front of you is a very nice touch. All in all I wouldn't mind going back to this place every weekend.

Sorry Nawwarah... But if there would have been a lower rating available I would have given that... To start offni reached the place on Friday nyt @820pm and there were only 4 customer in waiting I was the 5th... They told me that wait time shall be 1.5hrs I thought of giving it a try... Waited waited and waited... Got thirsty asked for water and that too was so late that I waited waited and waited again for more 30mins then on telling them numerous times they reacted and thought of giving a glass of water... But mind it it's 940pm and still we haven't got a table yet...

After letting them know that it has been more than an hr for just accomodating 4 customers in a restaurant it describes that how slow the services would have been ... After too many agrument frustration they were finally able to give a 4 person sitting for 5 people.. 3 person sitting uncomfortably on sofa...

Coming to the food... It was very okayish types.. we didn't wanted to go for starters and there were no time for that... We ordered malai kofta, dal makhani and tava sabjz all were ok and not that great to be.. breads were also just okay...

In summary service was damn slow... Hospitality was not at all there in the staff no body knows what's happening and why... What to serve what not... How to serve .. etc.. hygeine no no no not their at all.. guys cleaning water on the ceiling and waiter carrying open mocktails beneath from there... Sorry Nawwarah I would never recommend anyone here anymore neither I would turn up.. worst experience ever had in any kind of restaurant...

Today was a total gala ,
Went for a private party during lunch and witnessed a superb arrangement for 30 of us ,
Super prompt service with great food and a dedicated area for us . 

Accompanied friends to do some hookah after the party and was absolutely taken aback by the brilliant concept of their desserts & AK 47 hookah.

Good change for Kolkata ,
Love the fact that they're trying new things and if not anything else , winning.

Love the place and promise to visit it multiple times this week itself , definitely a turn on this place ! Keep rocking team Nawwarah üôèüèª

One more pure veg family restaurant owned by well known Ganpati caterers... Dey have dinning area in the ground floor and lounge on the 1st n 2nd floor.. ¬†Ambiance is really good and will make u feel u have entered in a palace... Food is really tasty and delicious... Quantity of starter dishes is really good enough so make sure b4 u order starters.. Main course is also delicious but they need to add few sabji items in the menu... Black daal and paneer palak kofta is must try... They hav good variety of mocktails and rose blueberry drink one must order... Different varieties of desserts and spcly pan cakes with gulab jamun inside was really sumthin to try for... Overall wen cums to food full points.. Bt dey need to improve on service and fast delivery of order on the table.. Its not that spacious so one needs to go early or hav to wait for there turn so arrange ur timings accordingly... One more thing its a bit costly , will pinch approx 500 per person.... Dey should review the rates a bit... ¬†Must try once for a change....

So I visited this place after hearing about it's authentic Jain cuisine.
The warm lights welcomed us and the cutlery was neatly placed. 
The ambience had a nostalgic & ethnic touch to it. 
Old classics & instrumental music were being played and special bonus for playing Careless whispers!
Specialities:
Cheese Naan (one of the best in Kolkata)
Malai kofta
Paneer Dopiyaza

The Chinese bhel looked really impressive and filling!
'Jai Veeru' was the funky name of the starter & the paneer was utterly tender and juicy!
Generous stuffing of dry fruits and minced paneer in the potatoes gave us the real kick!
Sauce and chutney on the side were silky smooth and had the required zing to it!
*Approximately ‚Çπ 650-700 for 2!

Great place to chill out. The rates of food items and shisha is also very pocket - friendly. Always wanted to visit this place and rate it (genuinely) after so many controversies.Cheese parathas were awesome . The staff were also very friendly. They changed the hookah base once they found we are uncomfortable with it. Only complain is that when we visited we had to wait for 10 mins and then we asked for staff for menu. They themselves didn't provided it. But overall it was memorable experience and nawwarah made my day‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Nawwarah had been on my bucket list for a long time. Despite being near my house, I only managed to make my first visit about half a year after I first intended. Mostly this is because of the long queue they have even on weekdays which sort of delayed my visit. Anyway, coming to the main review, Nawwarah is an excellent example of fine dining experience. The staff is courteous and make good suggestions regarding the food. The service is also fast. Ambiance wise also, there's no room for complaints. 
Coming to the food, we went straight to the main course. We ordered a bread basket, black Dal, Bell pepper dumplings and paneer butter masala. Each item was amazing. The Black Dal and cheese Nan were exceptionally good, the latter of which is probably the best cheese Nan I've had in the city. They had also given complimentary papad too. One issue is that the portions of the dishes seemed slightly less, but nothing that can't be managed. 
Overall Nawwarah is worth your time and money, so check this place out.

It's situated just opposite to Quest Mall, Park circus..
Very noticeable from outside the mall..
The decor what I found is amongst the best in Calcutta..
It was always expected as Nawwarah is owned by The Ganpati Caterer..
It's has a dine in place for families..
And as well as a hookah lounge on all the three floors for hookah lover's..
The food here is Nice..
I won't say awesome but it's nice..
The ambiance is very pleasing..
And the staffs are very friendly..
I only had a single problem with the staff as I was accompanied by my friend and we were 2 in number so we were made to sit on the hanging chair and it was a bit uncomfortable on the hanging chair as I asked the waiter to bring our order on the couch as the couches were empty..
And he denied by saying that the couches are not for 2person..
As, I saw most of the couches were empty as it was not very crowded at that time..
I had that point as negative..
Otherwise, it was a good experience..

We went on a Sunday evening at around 8:15 PM and were told we have to wait for 1.5 hours for a table. 
We agreed and patiently stood in the waiting room. However, the waiting room had TERRIBLE air conditioning and it was literally cooler outside than inside the waiting area. We repeatedly complained about the hot and humid temperature inside the room but were told that nothing can be done. 
We asked for water but were not even given water to drink while we were waiting. 
After 1.5 hours, suddenly we notice a family who booked after us get a table while we were still waiting. We went and asked the woman who was managing the waitlist and also a man along with her who finally apologised to us after much argument from the woman. She shamelessly kept laughing while we were talking to her. 

Their lounge menu is different from the restaurant menu which is really unfair. The lounge menu is vast and varied while the restaurant menu is very basic. Both should be the same in terms of food. 

Went again in the hope of a better service. My friend was told stag entry isnt allowed from 1-8 pm. Bizarre rules inspite of him telling them that we were booking a table for four with girls coming. 
We were served several cubes of watermelon with a drop of feta cheese in the name of salad. Serious disappointment. 

There is a serious problem with the management of this place because their hospitality is very poor.

Its such a pretty place beautifully lit..!The service is quick and the staff is courteous

We ordered a lot of mocktails and the mezze and nawwarah platter.Then we ordered some mixed sauce pasta and pizzas.Overall i can say the food was decent.Not finger lickingly delicious but nice.

We also had some deserts like the cheese cake platter,macaroon platter and kesariya ice cream with paan ice cream and foam.I liked the paan ice cream the best!

Being a vegetarian I was really looking forward to dining at Nawwarah. Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. To begin with, we had the Manchow soup, paneer chilly dry and cheese stuffed mushroom. The soup and the paneer chilly was extremely well cooked, the cheese stuffed mushrooms are passable, very average. Then for main course we had dal makhani and tawa subz with masala kulcha, Lal Mirch paratha and ulta tawa paratha. The dal makhani was probably one of the best I've had in Kolkata till now, the tawa subz and the breads were also good. Finally, for dessert we had the Philadelphia Cheesecake platter which was probably the highlight of the meal for me. Beautifully presented and really tasty. Sorry, I only have one picture i.e. Of the cheesecake üòã

All in all, good food, good service, I will definitely go back to this place.

Visited this place opposite quest mall with my lovely friend for lunch was disappointed when they refused to take table booking saying they don't take booking though their online portal confirmed they took. Decor is nawabi style but service does no belong to that era. They had an leaking AC duct which was being wiped continually with guest sitting under it. We ordered Jai viru a tandoori platter which was no good .but then main course was of asparagus rissoto and lasagne which was ok. The only silver lining was the moctail a guava drink with a spicy twist. We did not try any Indian cusine so will keep that for later . Happy eating

The place is opposite quest. I went to the dine-in one. It's a place where one can come with family and enjoy. Its a pure veg restaurants. The food is okaish. Nothing extra ordinary. Service is slow and the waiters were polite and respectful but were inexperienced. American corn peppers was awesome. Starters are goood. The Italian was not upto the mark. Even the north Indian was okaish. But the bill made me happy. It's totally value for money. Overall a good experience.

Being a vegetarian, I was very excited to go to Nawwarah. I had heard so much about them. The reviews and the eye catching photos were so promising but I was really disappointed with the behavior of the staff. Especially the security guards, who are poorly trained. We dropped in at 7 , and wanted to dine in the restaurant (They have a lounge as well) and the security didn't even know if they were open or not and made us wait outside when it was raining. So that was a major put off for me. 
Coming to the food, I thought it was mediocre. Nothing too special. I loved the soup though! Hot manchow was really cooked to perfection. Others were about right, nothing worth mentioning. 
The management really needs to work on the staff. People would like to dine in a restaurant not only for the food, but for the complete experience. So, the food being good shouldn't be the only objective.

1stly We were asked to wait for an hour on a Wednesday evening, which went upto 1.30hrs. We still waited  just to see that someother group was accommodated before us and on complaining the manager said it was because of some communication gap. 
2nd The service is damn bad. Very slow. 
3rd we made very clear wat in the menu would be a jain one n what would be normal, but Alu jeera which was supposed to be a jain one.. had garlic in it, on asking they said the waiter dint write jain against it so its not their fault. 
4th a mojito was ordered and after more than 30min we asked them to cancel it but then they dint and got that immediately which could hav been atleast 15min back. 
5th the Taste was not at all good. Ganpati is not less than a big name and the kind of food quality they wer serving is not upto the mark. We hav had Ganpati food soo mny times but this is really not acceptable. please improve your service and food. 
The only thing we loved was the dessert. Lavishly presented and Lavishly eaten. 


Definitely not coming back again.

Located just opposite the Quest Mall.
Lovely decor, perfect ambience and well-behaved staff.
We ordered:
Tom kha soup,Crispy babycorn, Jai air veeru,kofta shyam savera, paneer butter masala, and Kashmiri pulao. Tasted good enough.
The mocktails we had were : Safe Sex on the beach (a treat to the taste buds) ,and a chocolate Martini which was great. The Spider's web was a disastrous choice though.
What you absolutely CANNOT miss here is the masala chai ice cream.
Highly recommended!

This place if for those who want to have a good view of the road around because clearly you will not be seated. All this after having waited for 3 hours. 
I dont understand when a restaurant cannot manage customer inflow, why don't they just apologise or even politely decline that they are overbooked. Keeping people on hold and not giving seat is intolerable. You must be discretional and decline the seat or provide a proper wait time. 


As said; I am not against this place because it is the place to be if you just want to kill time and judge frustration levels of people around you.

After hearing innumerable wonderful reviews from my friends and upon seeing that Nawwarah had so quickly become the go-to place for all the plans I had Nawarrah at the top of my priority list.

To begin with, the interiors of the place is majestic and breath taking . The ambiance from the very entrance was warm and greeting. This place has a restaurant on the ground floor and the above two floors is like a cafe where they serve shisha. The mirrors , the chandeliers, the prints on the velvet covers of the seats , the designs on the chairs , the swings, the entire aura of the place escapes you into a different world which is a perfect setting to chill with your friends on a weekday or even catch up between college/ work in the weekdays.

The shisha was great. We had the flavour kiwi mint . It's slightly different , rightfully as mentioned in the menu Nawarrah style.

The food was very delicious . I am not a fan of vegetarian food and it's mandatory for my staple diet to have non veg items but I had no regrets when I visited Nawarrah. The food served was hot and the fillings in our quesadilla was in good proportion. Both quality and quantity was rightfully balanced. The dessert platter looked not only breathtaking but also tasted heavenly. 

The mocktails were well mixed. I usually have complains that it's not well mixed and the different components of the mocktails sediment to form different layers . However, Nawarrah served it perfectly.

The staff was very friendly and the service was great. We never had to wait to ask for anything; someone was always by our table. They even changed the music channel for cricket at our request . 

One thing I would like to specifically point out is the cleanliness and the level of hygiene maintained in the place is remarkable . Usually restaurant/ cafe washrooms are treated as just a necessary burden and is not well kept . But Nawarrah's washroom is clean and the beautiful. 
( honestly didn't feel like using it for washroom purposes it was so beautiful)

I have no negatives about this place. I am just waiting to go to this place again. It is wonderful to see a person who is so young envisioned such a great idea which has turned out to be a beautiful reality. 
Nawwarah is not only a visual and culinary treat but it's hospitality at its best . A must visit (again and again).

This place is the next big thing but after my visit, i feel its all just hyped. The food has an average taste. Our sheesha choked us twice. They handed us the bill even before we asked or even planned to leave the table. And to top it all off,  the music was extremely loud that could give one a bad headache! We asked the staff to put the volume low and he said it cant be adjusted. You know, you go to a disco to dance, so you want loud music. You go to a lounge or cafe to sit and talk to friends. So adjustment of music volume is a must. My personal experience was scarred. We actually left in less than an hour just so i dont go crazy!

The intricate designing and the Moroccon aesthetic defines the nawwarah. Nawwarah is one of the places which is really pleasing to visitors. They have a wide variety of vegetarian options .Tried the vegetarian platter and fried potatoes. The paneer was really good , although didn't like the potatoes in the platter very much. The dessert options are also incredible.

The location of the restaurant is just perfect as it is exactly opposite to quest mall and so it is very convenient to get to the place for some good food after long hours of shopping. And just btw its a restaurant by the best caterers in town and so the quality n taste of the food is undoubtedly the best. üòä

1)The staff look so confused.They were just not interested in taking orders .3 times i had to ask them to take the order.
2)Mocktails were served after the starter that too after reminders
The stuffed mushroom is the probably the worst i ever had.
3)Thai rice n pesto pasta were ordered for main course.The curry that was served with thai rice was too thick..and the spaghetti in pesto sauce was equally disappointing that tasted only of cheese.

No one to even ask us for water & behaviour was very bad. Finally we left.

Went in with my family on a Saturday . We could find a table without much of hassle. Service is prompt and the staff is courteous and offers good suggestions while you take your time to order.  Ambience feels much pricier than the prices they charge you for the food . We had a Daal Makhani , Baigan Bharta , Kofta, Tossed Salad, Fries  and the assorted platter of Breads. Food is not heavy and midly spiced , overall worth the money and beyond. For dessert we had gone in for the Kasundi Kulfi, the only dampener of the meal for me , Tha way it's plated on a Paan Patta makes it difficult for you to scoop and is not appealing to the eye at all. 
Would recommend for sure !

This place has great hospitality and very courteous team. The ambience is in accordance to the theme of the restaurant.
The food needs some improvement (ordered the paneer kebab platter). The paneer was a bit chewy and should have a been a bit softer and more palatable.
The alcoholic beverages are on point and very innovative. I ordered the LIIT Suicide. It literally looked suicidal and considering the tower of alcohol that was served and it had a strong eye appeal and did give a definite new perspective to a mainstream LIIT. 
One thing that the restaurant really needs to improve on is the extremely unplanned and mismanaged valet service. I would have rather parked the car on my own in the next lane than avail the valet service. They parked the car at a distant location, hence, we had to wait for 25-30 minutes. 
Since, I'm taking into account the entire experience. The last encounter with regards to valet service takes away the points.
Otherwise, Nawwarah definitely deserves a visit!

So much hype. 

Waiting lines all the time. 

What a FAIL!

Let me put in this in points for you. 

At best the food was average. 

The hospitality was bad, we were not allowed to enter till I said three times that I have a friend waiting at a table. 

The decor, I'm sure was designed by 8 different people who never met each other. 

The desert, which should have been a saving grace was like eating clay. The macaroon "platter" had two horribly tasting macaroons and terrible food styling. Refer to the picture. 

We did laugh a lot at the restaurant and the experience. Watch out for the price tag still there on the chandelier!

It's a beautiful place. Lovely interiors and amazing furniture. Love the Turkish feel of the place. The food is very tasty and pretty pocket friendly too. We order a jai veeru(aloo and planner kebab platter), one veg, one daal, two naans, fresh lime and the total bill was 800 something. Pretty decent. What I dint like was that their kebabs dint look properly roasted. Paneer was like half done n the Aloo was fried. The main.course was damn nice though. The lounge is spacious where's the north Indian area is little congested type. Overall, a very nice experience!

Going to this restaurant wasn't voluntary since they serve only veg. But I was startled to see such grandeur at a restaurant in Kolkata who only serve vegans !! 

The restaurant is located exactly opposite to the Quest Mall and locating is easy. Parking is an issue and so they have valets. 

The ambience is lovely inside. The waiting area is also very comfortable. The staffs are very well behaved and professional. The menu is diverse and includes most clich√©d cuisines in it. The food is great. The mocktails are tall and absolutely value for money. The two mocktails I ordered tasted unique and different from each other. If you are looking for a shudhh shakahari fine dining restaurant with your family this is the place to be. 

Cheers!

An amazing place for vegetarian lovers. Situated opposite Quest Mall , Nawwarah is yet again an amazing restaurants from one of the famous caterers of Kolkata The Ganpatis. The place is devided in two, one is the lounge and the other one is fine dining. The interiors are amazing you get a royal feeling when you enter the place . Had orderd for a Spaghetti and dum biryani. Both tasted really very nice . Prices are ok and the service is also very good .

Nawwarah serves delectable vegetarian food. There are so many vegetarian outlets springing up here and there and Nawwarah has managed to draw huge crowds. The food here is simply wonderful and each of them tastes lovely. From mocktails, to the butter naan and paneer and finally dessert, everything tasted superb!
I found the service a bit sluggish initially because it was crowded. Nevertheless the food made up for it. All of this cost me approximately around Rs 800.
And you will simply adore the decor with a royal touch.
So I shall definitely recommend this place to all my fellow foodies out there.

Newly opened.Opposite to Quest mall on the main road.Its completely veg so restricted menu  for meat lovers. Tried out Nchos and Thin Crust Four Cheese Pizza which was quite tasty. The ambience and decor is upto the mark. The sitting arrangements is quite unique with couches in the corner, swings, chairs. Quite decorative and innovative. The service can be a little better. Or else nice place to enjoy with friends and click many selfies for the background.

Visited this place last week the food is excellent especially the cheese balls. Sheesha was equally good. The white chocolate raspberry dessert was awesome it had white chocolate raspberry velvet with black olive sauce chocolate caviar with raspberry ice cream‚ù§. The decor is superbly done and so is the service. All in all an amazing experience will love to visit here again.

So this place is just opposite Quest.Its divided into 2 parts.1 for sheesha and the other for dine-in.I like this concept.I went for the Dine-In and I loved the interior.The staff was very friendly.The food was delicious.I loved their Mix Sauce penne pasta n Babycorn.This place is a must try.Just one drawback that this place had a Unisex washroom and people had to wait outside.Otherwise the place is good.

A newbie that has grabbed enough attention in a short span for it's wonderful vegetarian delicacies. Nawwarah is the best place for friends and family gatherings. I have been there twice, once with my bestfriends and again with my family as well. My parents were a little skeptical at first as for bengalis a meal without fish or meat seems odd. But they were very delighted with the quality of the food. Everything was prepared perfectly. Totally visiting again.

Been to this place a couple of times. Their food is a bit heavy and the Jai-Veeru kebabs aren't that amazing. Though I like their dal makhani and lasagne. The dessert which is hyped and tasteless - the Milky Way is not to be tried ever.

Nawwarah has recently become the hub for college students and lot of other people for its low priced menu of food and Shisha (majorly). ¬†Located right opposite to Quest Mall, this place cannot go unnoticed. Bright windows, colourful decor, plushy velvet-ey couches and lots of Panda soft toys is what this place has to offer along with the food. Firstly, this place is too bright for the eyes but it gives a huge happy vibe when you enter and it sure doesn't fail to live up to its expectations. T
he quality, quantity and the presentation of their food is impeccable. For starters, we ordered the Paneer Multani Tikka and ended up re-ordering it because it was so delicious. And my vegetarian friends, being vegetarian of course ordered Crispy chilly Babycorn, becasue why not. You judge a restaurant best with the kind of CCBC they serve. Along with these we got the Peri Peri fries and Chole Kulche and a few mocktails. ¬†The food as i said was delicious and their service was good too. The shisha they serve is quite decent. Along with the plush decor, great music (a little to loud at times), great service and good food, Nawwarah is doing quite well.All in all, a good place to chill and enjoy if you are in that area. Cheers.

Hi so after the much talked abt Nawarrah we checked in for lunch one fine afternoon and were seated after an hour long wait. But the wait was totally worth it..It's beautifully decorated with Moroccan style decor and the famous lanterns..Coming to the food the mushroom soup aka gumcha shorba was disappointing..But the corn tulips made up fr that. It was very innovatively presented..the Indian main course were all very good especially the Indian breads were made to perfection...Lastly the dum biryani was very tasty and I still can't forget the flavours melting in my mouth. We were too full to try the dessert so I am surely visiting it for its molecular gastronomic desserts...

A great place to visit .The decor is really unique with innovative seating arrangements . Coming to the point , that is the food - they have 2 sections the Indian as well as Italian . I have been to both . Out of the 4-5 dishes i ordered in Italian the 2 two dishes that was a treat to my taste bud were - The Asparagus rissotto and the 4 cheese pizza . It's really cheesy . For people who are on a diet (BEWARE - haha!!) .
Coming to the Indian food the quantity according to the price is little less ! But coming to the choice of the dish and it's taste we ordered - Jai Veeru for starters,mushroom soup followed by the main course with dal makhani ,kofta (2 gravies) and a kadhai veg . For bread it was garlic bread and masala kulcha .
The mushroom soup was no close to the soup , was more like a shorba . All the side dishes were really good specially the dal makhani . In conclusion with no differences it's a balanced place with  both Indian and Italian cuisine . A new place , can work more on the  Indian section but overall a great start! üòÉ

To begin with I had not heard positive reviews about this place from friends, colleagues and acquaintances.. So when I had to come here with my sister I was a little skeptical about this place.. 
But you guys just turned my views around a 360¬∞ which I think is quite evident from the ratings. 
Right from the ambience, music,  food,  decor,  presentation and service - all was top notch and simply bang on.. 
I was all this while thinking that it's just an overhyped place coz of a full time catering name backing.  But I was simply proved wrong and am absolutely delighted with it. 
Special mention for the desserts. The milky way and the Philadelphia cheesecake simply blew my mind away. The only thing I did not like much was the nachos. I'm sure it can taste better. 
Special thanks to our server Mr.  Raju Debnath for rendering us with his services and making our dinner all the more better. 
Thank you for such an amazing evening. 
Keep up the good work and the good playlist.  :)

‚Äònawwarah‚Äô, which means newborn, the name is derived from the Arabic word.¬†
but if u notice a bit at the first page menu before you order u can see, ¬†they us to know the meaning of ¬†'nawwarah ' is - ¬†humble moroccan villa which is venture under under buzzing hospitality greetings you with ¬†a delicious feast of exquisite dishes.¬†

Where: Syed Amir Ali Avenue (opposite Quest mall)

Open: 11am to 11pm

The place is divided in two different sections, which is quite from the entrance itself, as it has two entrances, one leads to the lounge section upstairs and the other to the fine dining area at the ground fl. For me best thing was they got valley parking. <3 ¬† parking in this area is such a pain, but they has solution . ¬†
Every element inside the place on the ground floor speaks of opulence.A sparkling new three storyd building with dining and lounging facilities both but at their respective settings. right from the velvet-covered couches to the intricate detailing on the colourful ceiling and the cascading chandeliers.¬†
It is a pure vegetarian cafe cum restro. they even do serve liquor. (but not every day, maybe just becoz their licence still on hold) liquor price is very very low. food menu is also very pocket friendly. shisha quite decent.
¬†one complain i have regarding shisha is they burn the flavour on very next cole change. This is a bit disappointing ¬†for me. its a new cafe so i guess these small mistakes are quite negligible.
so come to the food point , am not at all a vegetarian person hence, trust me i loved their food. Am sure their kitchen is very very good. i tried nawwarah special food platter . which is sufficient for 3 person as ¬†a stater.
¬†
Nawwarah food platter : tandoori alo stuffed inside with raisins, nuts and chopped paneer with some sort of chat , dhaniya and jeera mixed masala, malai broccoli tikka , paneer tikka with 2 types of dipping. ¬†which actually taste heaven .¬†

Square driver: ¬†It is a cocktail ¬†with orange juice . was perfectly blended, and smooth
¬†
Masala veggi maggi : It was also perfect¬†

Cosmopolitan : It was cocktail too , and was just perfect .¬†
 
Philadelphia cheese cake platter : was very decorative and colourful. Taste great too. My friends and sister liked it so much but am personally not a sweet lover so cant say more . 

Shisha : Needed to improve a bit.

¬†Beautiful ambiance to its highly trained staffs, and each small things is crafted to impress you. I am sure this place is soon going to become  the hub for Vegans around the city. over all i just loved the place and will visit again and again . this place is worth to visit. everything at the same roof.¬†
(this review based on my own personal experience , after visiting ¬†6 to 7 times with my friends )

Absolutely lovely decor. This giant cafe cum restaurant cum lounge is surely a vegetarians paradise. What woos you at first sight is the amazing decor. From the ceiling to the chairs to the couches to the swings everything is a treat to the eyes. Vibrant and colourful. The second floor is the lounge which is the loudest. It plays the recent hits and makes you greats the great ambiance. The service is friendly and prompt. 
My friends found the hookah to be smooth. 
Whatever we ordered did not disappoint me. Plus its quite reasonable. So great hangout spots for the students.

Located in ballygunge area, opposite quest mall, it is a standalone property which has made its name in very little time with its lovely decor and great pricing. 
On entering you will be awestruck with wonderful interiors. 
They have a lounge section which is spacious and seating is comfortable but tables are a little too low. We ordered for a hookah some nibbles and 3 mocktails, the Shisha was decent have tried better ones at different places. Food was good with very little scope of improvement what really impressed me was their mocktails well made and beautifully presented. The only area of improvement is service and hookah, and I would definitely rate it at least 4.5.

The food takes a little time to arrive at your table, the taste is above average but not very great. The prices of the items are good. Not very expensive but much more is expected from such a brand name.

Most disgusting place ever. First they ask you to wait for 40 minutes and when you have waited for half an hour then they conveniently tell you that it was a mistake and it's going to take one and half hour. Why can't they be honest in the beginning. What's the point of making someone wait for this long and telling " we are sorry, the person at the front desk didn't know". Either start taking reservations and abide by that or don't lie to people on their faces. New restaurant in town and they surely know how to treat their customers well. Superb guys.

Nawwarah is located just opposite to Quest Mall. Being a hardcore non vegetarian it was very difficult to look for a vegetarian dine out. Meanwhile my friend suggested me this place and wanted to explore it. Today I dropped into Nawwarah with friends had I must say I was more than happy with the food and service along with the beautiful decor. We ordered mocktails which were quiet interesting n delicious and jeera rice paneer butter masala butter naan for main course which lived upto our expectation. This place is a must revisit.

It has two sections, a hookah bar and a restaurant. We went to the restaurant. The ambiance is nice, the place is beautifully decorated. The food is great. We had cream of mushroom soup, German potato soup and spring rolls for starters. For main course we had lasagna, pulao, paneer makhani and naan. Quantity was ok. They have a good dessert menu, from gulab jamun with rose panna cotta‚Äã to macaroons, everything is eggless. We were full but had the macaroon platter. They served only two macaroons in that though. We also had two drinks an orange mocktail and a cranberry mocktail. The orange one was more refreshing. The service was good as well. Overall it was a nice experience. Will definitely go back. :)

Wanted to visit this place for long. Finally went with a friend for dinner. First we went to the lounge section because was in the mood for shisha. There was a cover charge of ‚Çπ500 per person. But once we went in we changed our mind because the music was too loud and we moved to the restaurant area. Coming to the food, we ordered, paneer tikka and aloo tandoori for starters, green Thai curry for main course and Philadelphia cheesecake for dessert. Everything was very good especially the cheesecake. The decor is absolutely mesmerising. The place can improve slightly on service. But overall a great place. One suggestion, for the lounge the music should be softened keeping in mind the decor and the size of the lounge. Playing nice softened music would really go with the place.

I have never come across such a lively and colourful ambience in Kolkata before. I would rate 5/5 for their decor, floral cozy sofas, neon and vibrant lights, swings, chandelier, colourful mirrors, lamps in the entrance, also very intricately designed doors and stairs. All this is in the lounge which is in the 2nd floor. 
I would give them 5/5 for food presentation too. It's so beautifully garnished and looks very fancy and are tempting. You crave to order more such beautiful looking dishes. 
We ordered 1.Nazza which served very soft and authentic butter naan's with Dal Makhani. However I felt the quantity of Dal Makhani was not enough to complete the naan and a pickle would have been helpful. 
2.Mexican Rolls looked extremely stylistic and it was wrapped with lots of veggies served with salad and ketchup and they were perfectly filling to get you going for the day. 
3. What I did not like was the white choco raspberry dessert. It did not look that great neither it tasted any different. Maybe it was a wrong choice. Also I requested the staff to write "happy 2 years" in the dessert but by mistake they wrote "happy birthday 2 years" which made no sense. However one lady staff was really sweet to cover it up using a tissue. 
What's unique about Nawwarah is their trained staff members who wear t-shirts with the caption "You can count on me like 1,2,3.. and thus you know you can rely on them. 
But I have complain against their Valet parking since we had to wait for 15mins in the heat for our car to come. 
I hope to visit here soon with my family to the dining section in hope of the same services. :)

Finally visited this new trending resto. Loved the decor- very quirky and classy. Ordered:

Four Cheese Pizza- Couldn't see the 4 diff types of cheese as it's name was based on. Apparently, on being asked, the waiter said the cheese had been mixed up so it was not visible separately. Nevertheless, it was delicious. 

Nawabi kabab- Very ordinary. Expected something better. 

Milky way- This is mainly the reason I've given a rating of 4. The chef got an empty tray to the table and made everything infront of us. Absolutely loved the presentation and the concept. The brownies tasted like heaven. #recommended

Although the food was good, service was slow. Also, the water we were served(from a bottle kept at the table) was dirty.

The manager surely doesn't know how to handle his guest. Arrogance to its best. Did not know that you people are so happening that your management even does not have the time to talk with etiquettes to any of the guest that come here. A complete failure it terms of handling there guest. The waiting time can be for more than an hr and they might even turn you down anytime they want. They "believe " that they are one of the finest places in Kolkata but sadly they have mistaken that! A complete no- no for this place

It took me more than a month to coming up with the post and that is not because I was lethargic to write but to the things happened last month. However, the good thing is even after more than a month I still remember the cheesy pizza, Nazza and the Dal Makhni! You may wonder what is wrong with me; well nothing has happened to my memory but it is actually about my experience of sampling food at the vegetarian food joint Nawwarah.¬† I am often being accused by my friends I am partial towards my portion of non-vegetarian food but believe me I give equal attention to the vegetarian spread if that is good enough and after being in North India for around 7 years Daal Makhni is a weak point. I actually am critical about my portion of Daal Makhani and I found it really good at Nawwarah. Opposite to Quest Mall, it is easy to locate Nawwarah and valet parking is available there. Decorated beautifully with Mediterranean touch this place mast get some goodie points for the d√©cor. The blogger‚Äôs meet was planned at the lounge at 2nd¬†floor.

The decor is magnificent with colorful patterns that would remind you of Morocco. Spread out over 3 floors- ground floor- a family restaurant, first floor- buffet and second floor- a huge lounge with continuous sofa lining the wall, a couple of bean bags and a couple of awesome swings. Somehow it seemed like I had walked into a drawing room on the second floor as the match was on but the service was impeccable. We ordered the veg kebab platter which was really tasty and chilli potato fries that was decent. The highlight was the nawwarah special hookah which was shaped like a gun. The drinks are not on the menu but the staff can arrange it for you if you request them to.

Classy decor and sincere staff.

We ordered Babycorn and Jai and Veeru for starters. The paneer in jai and Veeru could have been better in taste.

We took a paneer delicacy for main course n tadka dal .. Sarso da saag and makkai ki roti with white butter and gur.. awesome taste. ¬†Perfect place to go for dinner with family.Mocktails was well presented. The drink taste was superb. i ¬†l ove this place.....

It's always a delight to come across a pure vegetarian restaurant. This place has ornate interiors with decent vegetarian food. However the place also has a set of confused staff who aren't very cooperative. The restaurant is supposed to open at 6pm for dinner but it wasn't open to guests even till 7.15

Interiors Amazing, Placements Congested.
Food fine. Steward Serving was below the belt, they don't know how to do a table before a meal, unprofessional way of serving, ill mannered lot of guys! Asked 2-3 times for tissues, extra spoons and forks but they were too Busy somewhere else. 
Restaurants are meant for Fine and Luxurious Dining but over here you will hear People shouting, NOISE of Utensils clinging, the mandatory Instrumental Music. People should be said not to shout when they are at restros, cafes are meant to be fun filled places!
This was the 1st visit to this Restro and certainly the last, NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ONES WHO WANT PEACEFUL DINNER. 
MOREOVER, we were given the table of 6 for the family of 8. How Amazing! 

Thumbs Down! No to this place! I WISH I COULD GIVE IT A RATING BELOW 1.0 BUT that's how they crack it. 

The sofa isn't meant for Dining Tables, as the standard height of a Chair/Sofa for a table of 30" from floor shouldn't be too low. At least not the ones, that are quite spongy !

I HOPE THE MANAGER LOOKS AFTER THE STAFF BEHAVIOR AND TRAINING AT TIMES IN ACCORDANCE TO MY REVIEW.

Being an hardcore non vegetarian,it's really hard to go out for a pure vegan restaurant. My friends kind of forced me into this one and i don't regret now.

This royally decorated colourful place is just at opposite of Quest Mall.

We ordered Pasta with Mixed Sauce and Asaparagus,Lucknowi Tundi Kebabs and a Nawwarah Platter with a mocktail Safe Sex on the Beah.

Each of the dish taste heavenly as well as the mocktail.

The decor will leave you without any words for few minutes when you enter the restaurant for the very first time!

The service and price were reasonably good. Hope to pay another visit very soon.

The ambiance of the place is one of a kind..and as far as sheesha is concerned,hands down the best..

Nothing great about this Restaurant. Service was below par. We asked for table napkin and the waiter said that it's not available since all napkins are being washed. Coming to the food, firstly we ordered tomato shorba and manchow soup. The manchow soup was good but tomato shorba had very little salt, so we had to get it changed. For the main course we ordered a basket of 5 Breads, in which one was Pudina Parantha, but when we got the basket we could not find any Pudina Parantha. Upon enquiring, the waiter said that the chef forgot to put Pudina in the Parantha, and its actually a Plain Lachcha Parantha. So overall a very poor experience.

Deserves a 5 rating. Ganpati's quality undoubtedly super. The think which one would like firstly is the interior. Then staff members are very attentive and friendly. Foodings was of top quality and taste, i tried platter, pizza, babycorn, etc. Chocolate shake was also yummm. Nawwarah sheesha was really special and normal sheesha too. Had a great time.

The first thing you notice is the decor. It's different from what you get in other cafes that serves hookah. 
There's this turn off about the place. They don't allow even 18 and above on the weekend after 3 p.m. one has to be 21 or above. Had to leave the place then.  But otherwise, have been here twice. 
Have had tried black forest ice cream, four cheese pizza, Caesar salad, safe sex on the beach mocktail, chilli guava mocktail and two different flavors of hookah. 
Ice cream and the drinks are a go-go. Very fine in taste and quantity as well. 
4 cheese pizza is nice with thin crust. Caesar salad is okay. Hookah is smooth. 
Staff is courteous, seems a bit moody though. Service is quick.

Finally visited Nawwarah, located just opp to Quest mall...its a nice restaurant which gives you two options...lounge and fine dine-in. I went for the lounge one. Ambience is nice, they also serve jain food. The four cheese pizza was amazing. I also tried paneer kurchan and laksa curry. Both were amazing. Do not miss the dessert "Milky way"...it is served live and tastes amazing. Overall, very good.

Lip Smacking Tasting Session @ Nawwarah, the first 'vegetarian only' lounge cum shisha bar of Kolkata ‚ò∫

"Nawwarah is an Arabic name for girls that means brilliant, dazzling, radiant."

The logo of Nawwarah looks Arabic in styling and a brilliant riot of radiant colors dazzle your mind, once you enter it's second floor based lounge area!

Situated bang opposite Quest Mall, Nawwarah is the latest culinary offering by the house of Ganpati Caterers (Sanjay), who have been extremely popular for their high end vegetarian catering and hospitality in Kolkata.

The ground floor of Nawwarah houses the sit and dine restaurant and the molecular dessert bar. First floor is part buffet and part lounge area. Second floor is completely occupied by lounge area cum shisha bar, which is established via two facing albeit separate rooms, each having a capacity of seating around 30 people. There is no lift. However, the stairway is adorned in class and style with assorted photographs depicting Middle Eastern lifestyle and culture, Moroccan style false doorways etc. Nawwarah covers a total area of around 4,500 sq feet.

Any interior designing that uses too many colors is prone to go haywire. But Nawwarah's lounge area will astonish you with it's amazing palette of both bright and pastel colors, be it the - couches, cushions, flooring, ceiling, window panes or swings. The eye appeasing harmony and easy connection that prevails between the afore mentioned colors and elements is something that you need to see to believe!

Nawwarah's lounge menu is divided into the following food categories - Beverages, Mocktails, Soup Bowls, Salads On Jar,  Nibbles & More, Starters & Kebabs Tandoor Se, Railway Canteen Food, Nawwarah Mini Meals, Something Italian and Desserts.

The food options presented for tasting comprised of -

Mocktails:

Since the tasting session took place only four days before the Valentine's Day, three usual and two Valentine's Day Special mocktails were presented for tasting.

I opted to taste one of the Valentine's Day Specials, called Rose Caviar.

- Rose Caviar: Hued in gradients of pale pink, it was a delicate looking mocktail, served in a medium sized glass, topped with thin apple slices, atop which two heart shaped pink-red jellies were placed. Also placed alongside, was a hollow hemisphere of lime rind, filled with rose caviars! Thick pink syrup and salt were pasted throughout the rim of the glass.

The concept was to pop in some caviars followed by few sips of the mocktail. 

Needless to say, that this molecular gastronomy infused mocktail was a show stealer in terms of presentation and an apt non alcoholic beverage to woo your Valentine. It tasted nice.

Nibbles & More:

- Nazza (Rs. 215/-): Served on a thin flat wooden tray with a holding handle, the dish consisted of around three mini sized crisp naans, divided in half, topped with cheese and baked with zaater powder. A small bucket of dal makhani was served as the accompaniment.

It was a fusion of desi naan and videsi pizza, which served as a great conversation starter till thr other dishes arrived. It tasted nice. The accompanying dal makhani was better. In fact, it was quite good.

- Open Sandwich (Rs. 175/-): In a similar wooden tray as mentioned above, two thick triangular open sandwiches were served with a side serving of french fries (in the mini bucket), cream and some decorative ketchup and salad.

The sandwich was topped with char grilled vegetables and topped with mozzarella cheese and some thick sauce. It was well baked and tasted very nice. The french fries also tasted nice and crisp.

- Arabian Falafel Rolls (Rs. 175/-): A small rectangular black tray came laden with a mega sized falafel roll, divided into two halves, along with some side salad and cheesey sour cream.

The halved rolls were stuffed with lettuce leaves, onion,  colored bell peppers and lots of hung curd. A generous quantity of sesameseeds were pasted at the visibly open ends of the rolls. There was no falafel present.

The rolls were relatively healthy in composition, tasty and quite filling.

Starters & Kebabs Tandoor Se:

- Nawwarah Platter (Rs. 275/-): The afore mentioned black tray came lined with three separate columns of the following kebabs - Multani Mushroom Tikka, Paneer Tikka and Stuffed Aloo. A bowl of green chutney, some salad and a slice of lime were also served alongside.

All three veg kebabs were spicy and well grilled. Mushroom Tikka was the best of the lot. It was juicy and bursted in the mouth with assorted flavors.

Nawwarah Mini Meals:

- Amritsari Chole Aur Bakery Kulcha (Rs. 225)/-: The afore mentioned wooden tray came laden with a white ceramic bowl of kabuli chana and a metallic strainer containing two masala kulchas. A side serving of roasted papad cone filled with kachumber salad was also placed alongside.

The chola was well cooked and semi spicy. The kulchas were stuffed with cauliflower and the likes and tandoor baked. The dish tasted expectantly good and filling. Papad and salad well complimented the main dish.

- Paneer Khurchan (Rs. 225/-): This dish consisted of three elements - a golden hued metallic wok filled with long slices of cottage cheese and colored bell peppers cooked in a spicy tomato onion gravy, a black metallic cup containing two butter naans, and a small bucket containing the usual side dish of dal makhani.

The paneer or cottage cheese preparation was quite good and the naans were soft and fluffy. The dish tasted excellent.

Something Italian:

- Four Cheese Pizza (Rs. 225/-): A thin crust pizza was served, topped with the following four types of cheese - mozzarella, parmesan, cheddar and processed.

All four types of cheese present, were of good quality. You could actually taste each one of them while chewing. It was by far the best Four Cheese Pizza that I have ever had till date!

- Asparagus Risotto (Rs. 225/-): A deep basin and wide rim black ceramic dish came filled with risotto hued in a beautiful green and topped at the centre with some julienned bell peppers. Two small pieces of cooked asparagus and a side serving of garlic bread was also placed on one side.

This cheese rich rice preparation was quite well cooked and tasted very nice. It was difficult to detect any dominant flavor of asparagus though.

Desserts:

- Masala Chai Ice Cream (Rs. 92/-): In a black ceramic bowl, a big scoop of masala chai flavored ice cream was served with some strawberry compote at the top centre and a syringe containing some red colored syrup, inserted into the body of the ice cream.

Once you eat a couple of bites of this ice cream, the aftertaste in your mouth will be, as if you have had a cup of masala tea! Though a hot cup of flavored tea is a welcoming beverage for many, but do we actually look forward to it's aftertaste? So, though this dessert well served it's intended purpose, but somehow I could not understand the sense of it all.

- Baked Gulab Jamun (Rs. 171/-): It was a beautiful fusion dessert presented with a lot of beautification. Gulab Jamuns were encased within a cupcake, which was further encased in a thin crust flaky pastry bowl! Other elements present on the square shaped black thin serving plate were - rose caviar, sea salt crumble, dried rose petals and small dollops of panna cotta. A side serving of extra creamy vanilla ice cream was also served alongside. 

The dessert looked fantastic and tasted excellent. It was the kind of dish that you wish to repeat upon every visit.

- Milky Way (Rs. 403/-): It was not just a dessert but a full fledged performance, performed by the artisan in the serving staff and involving the power of molecular gastronomy.

It started with the live drawings of different elements using differently colored creamy sauces on a thin rectangular black serving plate.

This was followed by arrangement of the following elements, atop and around the afore mentioned sauces - rose caviar, mixed berry chutney, raspberry sauce, caramel, olive caramel, choco fudge brownie and sea salt crumble.

Then, a bulbous and hollow chocolate ball with an open top was placed on the afore mentioned edible artistic design. The choco bowl was filled with morello cherry induced mascarpone cheese foam. 

Lastly, amidst a lot of fog and speculation, liquid nitrogen was poured into the choco bowl, which instantly converted it's insides into edible semi solid ice cream!

The dessert tasted nice, but who actually bothers about taste after watching so much drama?

Each of the two lounge areas are air conditioned, equipped with a mute TV and background music and provide assorted shishas. You may also find a couple of soft toys strewn around. The serving staff may look a little lost at times, but are otherwise courteous. Parking as such is difficult, but valet parking is available. 

In the recent years, Kolkata has seen the opening of 100% veg fusion and molecular gastronomy diners on a high street. Nawwarah has raised the bar by opening an all veg lounge cum shisha bar. No wonder, if soon enough the city will witness a 'vegetarian only' restaurant in a five star hotel! Let's wait and watch.

Located in a very 'easy to find' area. Nice decor and ambience. One of the best hookah I've ever had but one thing that disappointed me was the food. Yes, the food could have been better. 
'Willing to serve' and 'always smiling' staff.
P.s- A chocolate Martini is a must try for everyone.

Its a must visit if you are too happy or even too sad because the brightness will brighten you up in no time.The Colourful decor is too pretty. I love their Pandas on every sofa corners.üêº
Coming to the Shisha,its a 5/5.
Drinks don't come perfect on one go. Have to request them to alter the changes. Safe sex on the beach wasn't that great.
Food is 4/5 The chefs have the tendency to put less salt in all the dishes. It's unhealthy to add raw salt to the food but can't help it.
The desserts are quite different here,mostly served as a platter. I liked their tastes but the quantity is too less if you are with a group of people.
Overall its a lovely time spent there whenever I have paid a visit.üòÄ

A really colourful place....There is a riot of colours and the decor transports one into a royal household ( well almost). The ambience is too much in your face. But the staff though courteous are a little lost. All of them do not have much of an idea about the food preparations. The food ,at best can be said to be average. The starters were good . But the mains were disappointing. The mocktails too failed to impress. The popcorn Mojito was just popcorn dipped in the drink and became soggy after a while.Expected more from this place, so disappointed!!

Service: 4.5/5

Had heard a lot about Nawwarah, mostly good but the place was no where close in living upto my expectations. The interiors are really nice and the place is well decorated though a little cramped. The food was outright average. The paneer butter masala was below par. The deep fried mushrooms was a complete deal breaker(PS: I am a huge mushroom fan, so for me to not like a mushroom dish it has to be really bad). 
However giving credit where it is due, the waiters were pretty polite and courteous and the service was timely. Shyaam savera(kofta) was the only saving grace. If you do happen to visit this place,  do try the milky way desert (I couldn't try it but it looked quite tempting).

Food,  ambience,  service,  and most of all the swing treat calls for visiting nawwarah sometime soon.
BANG OPP.  QUEST MALL -  you can treat your taste buds right after a fulfilling shopping. I went on a Sunday with a group of friends and it was a really good.  Spaced out really well with dining and lounge set up the interiors is really cool.  The best part of it was the swing experience.  Talking about the service,  here too we were welcomed with a warm attendance of ronita.  Food was really nice and filling.  We had ordered cheese garlic bread and white sauce pasta coupled with a hookah (which wins brownie points) 
All in all its a cool,  good hangout place

Ambience: 
The decor is beautiful but there was a power issue when we were there and we had to change tables due to that. The music was light and comfortable. 

The table we next sat on was not a comfortable one. The seats were low and the table was too big for four people. Serving food was a problem throughout our time as the waitress could never reach the other end of the table. 

Food: The crispy chilly baby corn we ordered had stale onion in it. The soup wasn't served in a neat fashion. One side of the cup had soup dripping Highly unexpected from a fine dining restaurant like this one. The rest of the food was decent. We had ordered the typical dal makkhani, tawa subz and shyam savera.

Value for money is thik thak..

Never order desert in here.. It's just fancy in appearance.. With the least value for money...  All you can do is snapchat when they are making the desert..

It's definitely just an over hyped place. When you call them they say they don't take bookings even when the restaurant is empty.. the waiter is unprofessional and lacks basic hospitality skills also. When asked about specialities he behaves as if he has no idea.. takes 5 mins to understand what order we are giving and this is when restaurant is absolutely empty.

Food was very average and not hot also.  After main course the restaurant started filling up so the waiter became even more dis interested as if he is doing us a favor by serving us. We sat with soiled plates for 10 mins waiting for someone to clear and get us the finger bowl. After that we waited about 15 mins for the bill. 

All in all very un un professional not visiting again for sure.

The restaurant 
My mom and I tried this restaurant and had a really great time...to start with we were given a wait period of 45 mins but then we got a table in less than 15 minutes...after entering the place I really liked the ambience and the slow background music...the service was extremely quick and the waiters were polite...we had ordered tulip corn for starters, garlic naan and kadai panner for main course, chocolate Mohito (not sure with the name) for drink and Milky Way for dessert...we got our food really quick and everything was served with the ryt temperature and I found every dish (apart from the drink) really nice and well presented....the only place I had an issue was the car park...it took half an hour for the vale people to bring our car which did test my patience but with the great service and food I was ok with that üòÄ

8 of us After 2 hours of waiting (from 7.25 till 9.10pm) and a team of 11 surpassing us even though they were listed later, shouting at the reception person got us our seat. With children we didnt want to risk going and waiting at another restaurant on a sunday night. 

The ceiling had water leaking from AC duct, thankfully we were not seated under that, some other family were busy complaining.

The serving team seemed puzzled. After so much of waiting we also didnt care on the order of serving, which went in reverse.. dessert, pulao, chinese fried rice ( with PEAS..? ) , indian main course followed by starter. Unable to say if the food was nice or our waiting made it so.

To make up for such a mess.. the staff gracefully struck off the desert from our bill... hence the high rating.

If you decide to visit, the waiting time is long, thankfully there is a mall opposite ... have fun

The place was too shady and dull. We went there and they were hesitant and saying that their restaurant was full. The manager came and told us that 'aaj aapka yaha nahi hoga' they didn't even have basic etiquettes to address the customers and acted as if they were the only restaurant in the world.HIGHLY UNPROFESSIONAL AND UNCOURTEOUS.seems like new in the business

Been there yesterday. Nice ambience but staff should be better. The service needs improvement. Coming to the food had kasundi paneer,  crispy chilli baby corn and paneer and aloo platter. All were OK. The mock tails were just fine too but nothing great. Good place as far as value for money is concerned. But service needs betterment.

Nawwarah.......the name sounds royal. I have been to this place for my birthday party. We were 11 heads. We were given just the first table in the restaurant area. The waiter was totally novice.......very very slow to serve.Infact service was so so poor that it was getting hard to relish water also. Absolutely unorganised service......waiter didn't knew when to serve what???????After havin the drink or food nobody bothered to clear the table. One so called super energetic waiter was alloted to serve 11 people.......he was serving and he was only picking up the plates n glasses. It was a wonder for me to see ONE MAN SHOW. Our total party was in mess.......right from 6 years old to 60 years old person from our group didn't like the food.....service.....ambiance. Over loaded of people in the area as if sitting in the extremely well furnished road side area. Food quality was good but all food was served cold......dunno why but no single roti was even warm. Absolutely horrible experience. Despite informing no gesture showed for Birthday. The sofa was in L shape.......distance between sofa n table was so big n uncomfortable. No waiter was listening......chat masala was served aft we had paneer tikka.....For once thik hai we can manage with slow service but thanda khana kaise khaye.......i took my old parents to this restaurant being sanjay Ganpati  place-----the name is enough to define the place but to my utter disappointment they came home half eaten. Very very bad experience and not in a position to recommend anyone.

Such a great place to visit in Kolkata.
Ambience is simply awesome.. although the details of decoration is not simple...
Now food! Well I visited the restaurant & I am satisfied options over there...
 " Jai and veeru & pind da chana " these two preparations I loved the most.
And I can still feel the taste of the dessert "espresso toffee glacaze". Service is also prompt. All over my experience is excellent...

I had visited this place on Sunday afternoon.... Initially they told that it will take more than an hour and provided with a number to enquire about the status... but no one picked up...since we had heard a lot about it we decided to wait and after 1.5 hours we were given a table....the restaurant on the ground floor... they have given very fancy names but food is very normal... also service was very slow.... they need to improve on food taste, items and even service.... don't know if I will go again.... All the best!!!!!

Bad. Worse. Worst. These three words sequentially define the kind of experience that we had in that place. Made a big mistake by going there. Horrible service. Tasteless and bland food. Paneer is hard and rubbery. No flavour in the subzis. Rotis feel as if you are chewing raw flour. No taste no flavour. They make you wait 45 mins for a small order of dal, paneer and roti and even after that they leave you disappointed with their pathetic taste. Quantity is minimal. One portion of dal and subzi is only sufficient for two people at the most. 
Desserts are transferred openly from lounge area to the restaurant area through the streets. Absolutely disgusting ! 
Please dont make the mistake of going here ever. Waste of money. Pathetic experience.

Please dont waste your time and money at this restaurant. Horrible management by staff. They dont serve your food before 45 mins. Equally tasteless is their food. No salt in subzis. Rotis feel as if you are chewing hard rubber. All of the money has been spent on just decorations inside the restaurant instead of ensuring quality experience for the diners.
It would be better to have your food at a dhaba instead of this horrible so called ' restaurant'.

All that glitters is not gold.
Too much decor and the service exactly opposite.
Pretty from the outside and a waste from within.
Firstly, 40 mins delayed serving of food. That too, TASTELESS. No salt, nothing.
Garlic naan- didn't have the feeling of garlic.
Aloo do pyaaza- bland and the vegetables were raw.
They have two entrances adjacent doors, and they were carrying food through the road. What nonsense!
No sense of hygiene. A road side stall would probably be serving better quality food.
Highly disappointed.
Had too high expectations.. all gone in waste.

Service: 0.5/5. The staff didn't know how to serve the main course. They were awkward and clumsy. They did not provide the napkins and I had to ask for it.
Food: 2.5/5. Portions were really really REALLY SMALL. The mushroom soup was pathetic. Garlic naan was weird. Kofta was delicious. So was Nasi Gorang. The green chutney was unique. Apart from that everything else including tawa subzi,  panner butter masala was average.

The Moroccan themed lounge and restaurant mesmerized me with its stunning decor, from the moment I entered it. I headed straight up to the Lounge area, done up with bright colourful upholstery, candy coloured mirror frames and antique looking swing-seatings. The chandeliers above and the chests of drawers of carved wood, added a regal feel to the place.

I tried out a number of dishes from their menu, but I was really bowled over by their desserts. Of the three desserts that I had at Nawarrah, the Masala Chai Ice-Cream was the first. It looked nothing very fancy, and was a simple scoop on a crumb in a small bowl. But let this not fool you. The first mouthful came as the sweetest, creamiest and spiciest surprise that can ever be, and though I am not a big fan of ice-creams, this one totally made me fall in love with it.

Then came the Baked Gulab Jamun. It was a plated dessert, a rage around the world presently with the good ols gulab jamun baked inside a muffin, topped with rose caviars over a heap of sweet soil. The white chocolate trail connecting the muffin on one end to the quenelle of ice-cream placed on the other, was dotted with smatterings of custard and drops of meringue. This is one dessert I would recommend to anyone who loves different textures in a mouthful.

The third dessert was the Milky Way. The name instantly reminded of a a splendid dessert served at the Farzi Cafe, by the same name. Comprising of Raspberry Mousse Foam,  little bites of airy Meringue, a delightfully light Raspberry Ice Cream, White Chocolate garnishings, a salty soil crumble and several other flavour pops of pistachio, lemon and others, this one was a sheer delight to have. Not to mention, this one too looked beautiful. Plus it was assembled right at the table, which made it even more exciting.

I visited here last night... I just entered and fall in love with the ambiance of restaurant... i think it's enough to explain how much i am impressed by the ambiance...
Now the food part...
we were four people... firstly ordered two portions of soup... 1. Gumcha Shorba and 2. Lemon Cilantro... lemon cilantro was pretty fine but loved the gumcha shorba...
then ordered Jai aur veeru and cheese stuffed mushroom... both were two heros to me of the evening... then Pind the Chana, Butter Paneer Masala, Kofta Shyam Savera, Dal Makhni, vegetable tehri and kulchas... just perfect taste to taste buds...
now the desserts part.... 
Baked Gulab Jamun & white chocolate raspberry... queens of night... just awesome desserts...

AMAZING is the only word that comes to my mind.
A wonderful experience!!

To begin with the most important aspect,
The food was delicious. Not even a single complain I have regarding the food.
Presentation - Check ‚úî
Taste - Check ‚úî
Quantity - Check ‚úî
I specially recommend Penne Alfredo Pasta, Spaghetti Aglio Olio and Margherita Pizza !! I am quite confident that other dishes taste great as well!

The shisha was smooth, reasonable and again, no complaints.

The shakes were great! We ordered the chocolate shake and Vanilla Shake, both were great!

Other stuff that deserve a mention are :

The ambience - So colourful and vibrant. Couldn't take my eyes off the d√©cor. Got positive vibes throughout.

Good Music - Best of English and Hindi songs played throughout.

The staff - VERY HELPFUL. Even after reaching completely drenched, no one had a frown. Infact, we were helped in the best way to make ourselves comfortable (Brownie points for that). Very prompt service!!

Pocket pinch - extremely reasonable!
Enjoyed all of it without burning a hole in our pocket!
A group of 10 had a blast at an unimaginable price!

Shall be visiting again, soonest!
Thanks Nawwarah for the wonderful evening ! :)

Ok, the moment you enter the restaurant part of Nawwarah you see the whole array of blue green and bottle green colours bursting out of nowhere. The decor is too loud and unpleasing. 

The staff are undertrained, actually I didnt expect much from this place in anyway and was reluctant to go. Apparently their theme is moroccon but they serve Chinese and Indian. 

To come to the crux, the flavours are right in the food and have no complains against it, mainly because I just had the starters and left the place. There were two reasons to leave, Indian menu had limited options and had two veggies made of baingan which is rare in a fine dining restaurant. Secondly, this place attracts crowd like no other. Abysmal is all I can say and this was the reason why I left.

Had they been placed well and better trained staff and a more subtle getup, things could have probably been different. Though they have valet, wonder where they park, since the parking is no where in the vicinity. If you do give your car, you will probably have to wait for long once your are out(one way issue). Luckily I self-parked my car further off.

Since I am not a sheesha fan, I reserve my opinion about their lounge, I hope that's better and attracts the best crowd.

The first time I went there was 26 / 27th of December & it was not a very good experience but since then I think they have worked on magic,
I went there on the 7th March & I had a beautiful experience , I think the owners along with staff has worked immensely to give it a very mystical experience. The hookah was spot on with Nawwarah Special , mezze platter & nazza was delightful & mocktails were intense , I could rate them 10/5 .
The decor is a 100/10. 
It's very happy feel & I feel home now.
The service this time was fabulous & staff was very courteous , happy off to see improvement they have shown , wish team Nawwarah good luck with future!

Rubbish place with uncooperative staff. Even talking with owner made things more uncomfortable. Wanted to see party place so that to plan something in future,but was not allowed to see place surprisingly. On the contrary was told to check on zomato for picture. Physical seeing would not be possible. Nowhere ever heard this kind of "RULE"
Absolutely bizzare. This was on a Tuesday. Do not understand they are here for business or teach us rules at the cost of business. No explanation required. Stupid experience after long time...This was in lounge section. No idea about restaurant. This was my dad's experience.

Food - 4.8/5 ~ The quality is very good. Multiple options available.

Price - 5/5 ~ Given the service and food quality you receive the rate is very decent. Must admire the restaurant for keeping the service charge to a nominal 6%.

Location: 5/5 ~ Just opposite to quest mall. The place lacked good veg restaurants.

Overall a nice restaurant !!

Perfect place to go for dinner with family. Classy decor and sincere staff.
We ordered spring roll, Babycorn and Jai and Veeru for starters. Babycorn and spring roll were scrumptious. The paneer in jai and Veeru could have been better in taste.
We took a paneer delicacy for main course wuth tadka dal and one of each kind bread.
Paneer was a little hard to eat.
Ulta tawa paratha was made with utmost care :)
The staff was generous to answer all the questions about the food and also receptive to our problems. Thank you for the complementary lime soda at the end of the dinner.

Pathetic place....!!! No commitment...they dont have even a person to talk to. Further the manager is also unavailable at times of need. The staffs are also rude...they don't even have a courtesy to talk to customers. To every customer, they give a commitment of 1 hour waiting a@nd as usual it continues in the same. I would suggest everyone out here to boycott this restaurant. 
Full waste of time and ruthless behavior of the staff and owner are BIG Turnout....
Extremely and highly dissappointed with this restaurant.
The owner abuses and have no manners to deal with customers.

Ambiance- Great ambiance. Loved the decor. Huge space. The lounge didn't seem suffocating at all. Open spaces. Great job with the ambiance. Also, the music was good. 

Service- Courteous and polite stuff. They often can't hear you over the loud music but it's fine. :P

Food- We ordered the Nawwarah platter, Quesadillas, and the white chocolate raspberry dessert. The platter was okayish, they didn't have the mushroom item. The Quesadillas were yum and the dessert was great! It had good presentation as well. 
We also had the sheesha. Good flavour and what a base!  

The place is not very expensive either. All in all, a good visit. Pretty impressed by the place. Will definitely drop by again.

After a long time I had delicious vegetarian food. Situated opposite to Quest mall, it can be noticed easily. 
In starter I liked the name jai and veeru... :) Then in main course the Punjabi flavor was too good... Sarso da saag and makkai ki roti with white butter and gur.. awesome taste. 
Mocktails was well presented. The drink taste was superb.

Horrible horrible, beyond horrible!! Especially the service. First of all they have a major shortage of menu cards. For God's sake, why can't you print a few more? 
Anyway, we ordered the manchow soup, jai veeru and honey chilli potatoes for starters. The jai veeru was supposed to be a mix of paneer tikka and tandoori aloo. I haven't had worse paneer tikka. It was rubbery and tasteless. When we pointed it out to the staff, they offered to change it. When it came back, it was still as bad. Instead, of the the honey chilli potatoes they got babycorn. Again, they took it back and got our dish after 15 minutes. Still bad. Main course menu is very weird. They have tried to be different, but the result is a collection of useless dishes. Anyway the dal makhani, and mixed veg was good. Even the rotis were good. The mocktail were horrible, chocolate milkshake was just milk, guava delite was just tinned guava juice. And then, icing on the cake, when they got the bill, they had added a rice, which we never ordered, and they had billed us for 3 portions of dal instead of one. Horrible experience.

The main part is shisha that the serve is very good and specially the base. In all total NAWWARAH has some thing different from other. Kolkata is really gng to experience some things different. This place can be visited again and agian.

I was recently in Kolkata few days back and I wanted to take my mom out for lunch and I kept hearing about this place called Nawwarah every now and then on various social networking sites and it was a venture by a junior of mine from school and I was pretty excited to visit it so one fine day I went to this place and it was one of the most promising upcoming places in Kolkata by far with an infusion of an amazing ambience and amazing decor the place looked so beautiful and I am sure if one visits this place once they can't stop going there again and again like I went there twice when I visited Kolkata only for a week! The food and the desserts are to die for especially the starters which the lounge serves and the main course that the fine dine serves,The food was amazing. The molecular dessert bar was a cherry on the cake and the desserts were the best desserts that I had in a while now. More power to this place,Hoping to visit it real soon again.

Nawwarah is a beautiful collaboration of extravagant ambience, well bred hospitality and very well standardized food. The variety on the menu  is as impressive as the presentation . Not to forget , the desserts(made in a dedicated dessert bar)  are very innovative. The shisha served is very smooth and the staff are very cooperative. A must visit for all; family , friends , an official meet etc.

Well there's not much I can say about this place, it speaks for itself. Nawwarah thrives on customer satisfaction and with this aim in mind it happens to serve the best to its customers. From the food to the Shisha the quality is unparalleled and moreover, it is the homely environs of this place that keeps its customers coming back for more. The prices, the menu, the staff, they never fail to astonish you, they always have something in store for their customers. Nawwarah truly believes in the Sanskrit saying athithi devo bhava. I would like to conclude by saying that this is the change the City of Joy required.

Glorious grand place! While the d√©cor is heavily and wonderfully influenced by Moroccan and Turkish themes, the food is a mix of everything. I‚Äôd ideally like to talk about the food only but the ambience is so overpowering and obviously created with so much love, you just have to call it out. That is a lot of investment and a lot of passion for details. 2 thumbs up. We went to the shisha lounge, not the fine dine restaurant. The nawarah platter featured paneer tikka and aloo 2 ways, quite the traditional platter. Vegetarian tunde kebab is sacrilege to the average Kolkatan but I quite liked it, though a little too spicy and smoky. While the potato soup wasn‚Äôt bad, I was expecting it to be a cold soup. I didn‚Äôt fancy the popcorn mojito much either, the popcorn gets soggy of course and not very appealing. The asparagus risotto (prepared to perfection) and a super light banana smoothie were the highlights of the meal.

The whole idea here is to be well informed and order according to the specialty of this place. Ambience is interesting though. Seating can be upgraded a notch, as its difficult for the elderly to eat. 
The starters and the mocktails are interesting in presentation. Tatse wise its difficult to comment. The biggest let down is the main course which is truly pathetic to say the least. 
The idea is to go - order starters with mocktails later desserts and get out. You will give a 5.0 rating.

A 5 star rating simply does not justify the experience that Nawwarah has to offer, however I've tried to do my very best to describe my visit here through this post. You guys have set a benchmark in the hospitality and customer service industry and I wish you all the best!

Though this is a complete veg reataurant but its beauty failed to resist us from going there.
Not only the royal ambience,but the taste of the food made us fall for veg items.
We tried Paneer tikka as starter which was batter fried in mashed mushroom and tasted good.
We had two mini meals.
The nun came with butter paneer and dal makhani tasted amazing.
Also Delhi ka rajma chawal and paneer kurchan tasted too good.
I especially loved their paneer preparations and dal makhani.
And coming to the drink,safe sex on the beach is love.
The staffs are friendly and service is prompt.
Just one thing,the nuns of the mini meal was cold which was the only drawback whereas when we ordered butter nuns seperately it was hot and soft.

Visited this place with friends last week after seeing so many good reviews on Zomato. We had to wait for an hour to get a table. We were with a large group so didn't mind waiting.

However, the Food was below average. Chinese Starters were okay. Jai Veeru was tasteless and bland. Main course was Oily, greasy and tasteless. Roti's were served cold.

It claims to be a fine dining restaurant. It's definitely NOT.

Had a mixture of feelings when we came out of this place. The interiors is undoubtedly astounding. The place has many sections, all for different purposes. Somehow the place is more pompous, lacking substance. We tried the nawwarah special shisha, nawwarah kebab platter, cream of mushroom soup and khowsuey. Food was fair enough, some pieces of potato kebabs were undercooked, paneer tikka was nice n juicy. Shisha was good. We ordered for a live icecream, which they made from scratch, on our table itself, but wasn't appealing enough in terms of taste.

It is heaven for the vegetarians. The decor and ambience take you back to the Awadhi time of the Nawabs. Elegant and full of grandeur. 
The presentation, taste and service is of great quality too. The hospitality by the crew and managers is impeccable. 
Over all, it's a must visit for vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian for the unique experience and ambience.

I have been to this place twice,once downstairs in the family dining section and the food was okayish..I mean nothing out of the blues or any exception...today I decided to try their lounge and was simply taken aback by the attitude and behaviour of their manager salman..in the hospitality industry you don't argue needlessly with a client right?despite of seeing some negative reviews especially about the manager being rude,I chose to ignore them since we trust the caterers Ganpati..but unfortunately,you let us down big time..
I guess it high time people realise that hospitality is a lot more than just decor and food..it's also about how you deal with your clients..
I expect a brand like ganpati to take things seriously and not get carried away..
Thanks and regards

Nawwarah...Name that excited my taste buds. Entering the fine dining area..Ambience is beautiful..Truly royal...Now the test begins. Menu doesn't have too much variety. Ordered Jai veeru which is a combination of paneer tikka and tandoori aloo. It was relatively gud. Crispy baby corn was like any other restaurants.now the tragedy begins. Huge group enters the restaurant. Full service goes for a toss. Our main course arrives after almost 50 mins. Cheese naan had to be searched for cheese in it. Kashmiri pulao was decent. Popcorn mojito is a disaster and recommend not to be ordered. Well dessert was a welcome. Baked gulabjamun was nicely presented. Chocolate ice cream was a smooth delight . In all one can go for dessert there if they can improve the service.

New place in city just opposite to Quest Mall. Upon visit was welcomed with nice hospitality as the manager came asking for what kind of dinning you're looking for? And was suggested to visit their lounge area.
Full marks for their ambience and decor!
A female waitress helped us going through the menu and suggested food as we were 2 pax. She infact designed the meal for us giving 2 non-alcoholic beverages 2 starters and a mini meal.
We ordered shisha and bang they gave us AK47 look-like shisha with smooth flavors.
Good place!
Amazing food!
Awesome decor!
Friendly and helpful staff!

Would love to visit the dinning area next time!
PS: they give us a table at less waiting time.

Visited the restaurant last week,was totally amazed with the interior,superb decorations everywhere including the lounge. The hanging roof ofcourse is a pleasant add on. In mocktails SSOB is a must try ,goes very well with platters. The fine dining restaurant section is also a treat to the eye, it was already full when I reached in the evening,thank god I had an advance booking. Food quality is quite superb and totally classy,very tasty yet not heavy on stomach at all. I must confess they have a fantastic bunch of crew, a set of young,dynamic and ofcourse very well behaved.you can try any item from the menu and u certainly wont be disappointed for sure. In the end, the best part is the location which is right opposite to Quest mall and yes,they have valet parking too. Being a Bengali, I was also sceptical before visiting a VEG restaurant but Nawarrah certainly made me change my mind. Looking to visit again sometime soon.

So I went here with my friend on 24th Feb.

The ambiance of the lounge is so good. The decor too is outstanding. We took a hookah, had cold coffee and mushroom risotto. The hookah is good and the mushroom risotto was full of flavour. Cold coffee was very nicely made too. The best part is that the quantity is decent enough in such a pocket friendly pricing. Great job! Looking forward to visit the restaurant soon with family.

we visited this joint yesterday for dinner and was DISAPPOINTED with a capital D. Onchi dukaan, phiki pakwaan is apt. If royal , opulence and grand was the surrounding, tasteless, bland and insipid were the dishes. if the waiters and waitress were courteous and helpful, the helpings were simply avoidable. dal makhani did not even stand a chance to come in the top 100 dal makhanis which are served at other restaurants in kolkata, paneer makhani too was savourless... perhaps the assorted rotis were the only thing edible. to sum up our review ,even my ten year old son said" why did you bring me here". ¬†please dont rely on our review.. just try once for yourself.

This new place bang across Quest mall is a must visit in the city. The food, hospitality, ambiance everything has been taken care of from the minute of details. The quality and spread of the food choices is brilliant. I have visited this place twice, once the lounge and the second time the restaurant and I personally loved the NAWWARAH platter, khowsuey, amritsari chole kulche to name a few dishes from the lounge menu. Also, at the restaurant corn tulips, kofta Shyam savera, vegetable casserole were few lip smacking dishes. Not to forget I loved the mocktail, Atomic cat and to end with the Milky Way desert was the perfect treat to the meal. Beautiful Moroccan decor with such polite staff, I would highly recommend this place to the ones who haven't yet taken an opportunity to visit and surely go there sooner again.

Its a restaurant with an amazing ambience and service but when its a restaurant the food should be the utmost priority  and here is where it fails. The quantity of the food is less comparatively and the flavours are also too mild. The options for the vegetables in North indian section is limited.  We had orderd dal makhani and trust me i have‚Äã not had such bad experience regarding this classic dish earler! It tasted of milk powder,  and the flavour was really bad.  The restaurant is appealing but it is not a good option for people with taste preference.

We reached the place at 810. And got the table at 825 approx.Thy have waiting place also.
Starters: we ordered Jai and Veeru which serves 3 pcs of paneer tikka and 4 of tandoori aloo. Paneer was ok nt well marinated but aloo was good. Quantity was more than enough.
Main course : ordered gravy aloo and dal makhani.Both were equally good and quantity was also very good.
Coming to the Service: The staff were very humble who helped us decide the curry and their special mocktail....staff were very good.
Ended with complimentry pan .
Overrall had nice experience.A not at all overpriced restaurant .we liked it

The starters i called for was Nawwarah Platter & Paneer Multani ,
The quality was flawless , main course we had Khow Suey ,
Nazza , 4 cheese pizza ( mind blowing ) & jumbo burger .

Top quality everything and their service timing is 20-25 mins per order and me being into hospitality think that that is absolutely perfect given their quality , music & courteous staff.

Can't wait for them to start hookah & liquor ,
will be chilling every week there ! :)

I had an outstanding experience at Nawwarah. I had heard alot about this place and was very keen on visiting it. I reached the restaurant at 7:15 on a Sunday and found it already full. With a waiting time of one hour, my hunger and anxiety had reached‚Äã the ultimate height.
We ordered a platter that had a variety. It was good.
The main course was awesome. Nothing too extraordinary but quality and taste wise- it was really good.
The dessert - oh the good desserts- the MILKY WAY- it was the signature dish of NAWWARAH. Every dessert that was on the menu was special and attractive in its own way.
The menu didn't have a very vast variety but whatever it had was worth.
The ambience was superb.
The look was marvellous.
However, upon my next visits, I realised that the quality had decreased.
Coming to the lounge,
The ambience was even better here.
The hookah was excellent- Brain freezer.
Food was nothing different but they were really good to taste.
Amritsari chole and kulchhe were awesome.
Khow suey was an excellent‚Äã dish as well.
Safe sex on the beach was good.
The rest was just ok.
Service was excellent - a little slow but that was ok.
Overall very nice experience.

It is located exactly opposite to Quest mall. They have valet available. 
It has one area for Indian food.
To start with starters and soup, soups were fine, But not hot. However Paneer tikka were not cooked partially cooked. When we ordered the soup again, this time it was hot and much better. 
Main issue is the slow service. Main course is tasty but the slow service and staff were confused. Too many people waiting at too many tables. 
Curry and dal served after rotis are already cold. 
However, rotis were really good, and they were made of wheat and so they are healthy and light. 
They need to work on consistency of taste. 
They have this special dessert with nitrogen but it's again very small quantity. All the points I give here for the taste of dal and kulcha.

My first experience with Nawwarah was not that pleasant but today I just HAD to change my initial review. I went to Nawwarah today and I must say I was so darn impressed! The interiors hands down remains one of the most prettiest restaurant and I've always loved the politeness and efficiency of the staff. Today we ordered a lot of food but I'll tell you the best ones. You must order the Masala Ice Tea and the virgin mojito it's thoroughly refreshing and amazing to taste. The cold coffee was also great. The cheese garlic best is the most delicious of the lot that I had today! So cheesy and mouthwatering. The mushroom burger and the green Thai curry is also tasty. 
We ordered the mango cheesecake, mango sunrise delight and the strawberry galaxy. I'd suggest you definitely try out the cheesecake. So goood! 
And no words need to said about the beauty of the restaurant. BEAUTIFUL! üéâ

THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE NAWWARAH RESTAURANT ON THE GROUND FLOOR. (19/02/2017)

Nawwarah is located bang opposite to Quest Mall at Syed Amir Ali Avenue.
We went there with the hope of having some good snacks which we saw on Zomato before visiting the restaurant.

On reaching the restaurant, we were told to wait for 1 hr 15 mins. We reached around 8.35 PM and the guy who was allocating tables told us that it would take a minimum of 1 hr 15 mins to get a table. Although we were disappointed, we logged our number on the reservation book and then went to Quest Mall.

Say after 15 mins only, we received a call from the restaurant stating our table was ready. We immediately went to the restaurant. We were given a table which was for 5 people although we were just 3 of us.

After sitting, we were given ample time to decide our order and then we finally ordered. I will review the food along with the names of the Dish now.

CHINESE

Minestrone Verde Soup (3/5) - Tasted like Maggi Hot and Sour Soup with Diced Vegetables and Pasta Shavings. It was average.¬†

Chilli Garlic Hakka Noodles (4/5) - It was well prepared and tasted nice with a tinge of Chilli and Garlic. The Noodles were although dry so we had to order the folowing gravy alongside.

Vegetable Dumplings Manchurian (5/5) - Hands down, I would say this was the BEST MANCHURIAN I have ever had somewhere.

Now after having the above, we decided to have a bit of North Indian and Mocktails.. So we ordered the following..

NORTH INDIAN MAIN COURSE

Paneer Makhani (3/5) - A very average preparation of Paneer with very less quantity.

Dal Makhani (2.5/5) - Not Good. The Dal was like liquid and tasted below average. We had to add SALT in order to make it eatable.

Nawwarah Special Bread Basket (4.5/5) - The Bread Basket was something which won our heart. Had it not been the good bread basket, the whole main course experience would have gone to pieces. Coming towards it, the bread basket is an assorted platter of any 5 breads from the entire breads section. We ordered 2 Butter Naan, 1 Cheese Naan, 1 Amritsari Kulcha and 1 Paneer and Pyaaz Kulcha. All the breads were prepared very well and impressed us a lot. The whole Bread Basket costs just Rs.201 which is highly worth the money.

MOCKTAILS

Popcorn Mojito (4/5) - The drink was well prepared with Popcorns on top and a tinge of Caramel in it.

Safe sex on the beach (4/5) - This mcoktail was also well prepared with Cranberry Juice which tasted heavenly.

This was all which we had for food. Coming towards Ambiance, just one word comes to my mind and it is ROYAL. The whole seating space was designed in a very kingly manner with huge chairs and tables.

The restaurant is decently priced as of now. The whole order above costed us Rs.1700 with taxes.

Now comes the BEST PART OF OUR VISIT, the finger bowls which they gave had a new concept of tissue tablets with rose aroma which gave an overall nice feeling after wiping our hands. And the complimentary PAAN which was served at the last was so good that we actually asked for one extra to which the staff very happily agreed and gave us immediately.

Although the Snacks were not available in the RESTAURANT, I look forward to visit this place again in the Lounge Section where I would be certainly getting the snacks for which I actually planned my visit.

The RESTAURANT experience was also good but a lot of improvement is to be done in the North Indian Main Course Dishes!

A Royal enigmatic place, located just opposite to Quest Mall is a Morrocon themed Pure veg restaurant which has left no stones unturned while making its decor. It's rare interiors simply attracts your eyes and makes you feel like you are in a palace.
Coming to the food, we went for North Indian. Paneer butter Masala was nothing great, Tawa Subz is worth a try. Dal Makhani is also good. The Butter naan was thin and crispy. Masala Kulcha was also satisfying. The service is very good. And the ambience makes up for it when the food comes a bit late at your table. The waiters are courteous and also professional.
I liked the place and would definitely want to come again.
P.S - They serve a nice paan at the end of your meal to freshen up your taste buds.

Had a visit on 8th Feb with my di & jiju on their anniversary, though they had a waiting of minimum an hour,we were lucky enough to get a table quickly. The portions are a bit disappointing. The brand 'Ganpati' has truly maintained their standard in food quality. The dessert was the one that drew oir whole attention. Baked Gulab Jamun was a tart which was served with Ice Cream. This place is in our top restaurant list for any future functions.

This Valentine's my girl gave me a surprise by taking me to this new place. They had a special menu for the special day. The Sweet16 mocktail was a perfect one for the day & the presentation complimented the day. The best part was each table was dedicated to a couple only. This place truly made our day. Will look forward to visit it on a normal day.

Very bad and delayed service. No coordination between kitchen and waiters. If rotisserie come the accompaniment delayed. Souls and other dishes served cold. 
Manchurian too hard to cut. 
Only silver line was rhe decor.
 But one goes to restaurant for great food and service and that is absent.
Rather a surprise coming from the stable of Ganpat.
Better avoid..

The one of a kind cafe in Kolkata which is a mood changer, you go in tired & lazy but when you leave you are filled with an unexplaineable energy. The food, mocktails & dessert compliment the aura of the place. Even my health freak friends couldn't resist themselves from overeating.
The best part is that in such a posh area even it doesn't create a "Hole in the Wallet" as their bill read.
The owner attends guest personally as much as possible.
We were sitted in the lounge which has a prime focus on the continental dishes.The few drinks we tried out were Atomic Cat, Safe sex on the beach(a nice catchy name), Guava Delight is a must try for those who love spicy things.We had Four cheese pizza,Nazza & Nawwarah Platter. Four cheese pizza was a great combination of cheese on thin crust. Nazza was even a great dish even. It was a blend of naan,cheese & herbs which was accompanied by Dal Makkhani.
There desserts are great too coz they look too good & are ultra light to have.
Will definitely look forward to visit it again soon.

Firstly, I am a big time carnivore and frankly, it‚Äôs not a secret now and the second fact is Kolkata is a city of non-vegetarians. But, nowadays few vegetarian fine-dining restaurants are opening up in the city, which are serious in their business, and probably it‚Äôs a good sign. This time, the post is one one of the newbies in town- Nawwarah. The location is fantastic- it‚Äôs bang opposite of Quest Mall, Park circus and the outlet is spread over a whole 3-storied building. Parking is a bit of a problem, but valet parking is there, so nothing to worry about. The decor is super posh and it‚Äôs one of the USP‚Äôs of the place. Extreme care has been taken in designing the interior. From the staircase to the chairs, it‚Äôs fabulous. But, there is not lift and for an ageing elder customer, the ground floor sitting is suggested and advisable.

We were served a set menu and mocktails came in first. They were great looks-wise and taste-wise was also pretty decent. 3 variations were served. Safe sex on the beach (the mocktail version of the famous one), Atomic Cat and Guava Delight. Out of them, Guava delight was a bit spicy, but taste-wise it won hands down. Definitely recommended.

The food was a large spread. Now, something interesting came up first and the name is Nazza. Basically, what we understood is it‚Äôs Naan with cheese and herbs topping and given the looks of a pizza. Dal makhani (a pretty good one) was served as a complementary item along with it and frankly, I loved that. Paneer khurchan came next along with Baby Naan and Dal Makhani (again, loved that again) next and the dish made my evening- damn good. The Amritsari chhole kulcha was good, but somehow, the kulchas are most enjoyed in those rustic dhaba ambience, rather than this fine-dining outlet, but then I am opinionated- can‚Äôt help.

The Nawwarah kebab platter was served next along with the open sandwich. The kebab platter was good with stuffed mushroom, Paneer Tikka and tandoori stuffed aloo. The mushroom was best of the lot with just the perfect marination done. The open sandwich was nothing special frankly, but just okay-ish. Now, this outlet‚Äôs menu planner had (thankfully) understood something. Vegetarian menu can be designed without the mandatory paneer dish also. And, Arabic Falafel rolls came in next. They were cut in half, but still pretty huge in size.

We were almost full, but the next and final 2 main courses were not to be missed, especially for a cheese freak like me. IT was four cheese pizza (with actually 4 different types of cheese-mozarella, cheddar, parmesan and forgot the last one‚Äôs name- I was too busy to gobble actually). It was a tri-colored pizza, so great visually. And the final main course was Asparagus Risotto. Now, for a bong, a Risotto is a deadly combination- it gives a feel of rice and something we bongs love- cheese and lots of cheese. Now, whether there is asparagus of not (it was here in this case‚Ä¶), we love Risotto and this was no exception.

Firstly, we were full and secondly, I had to rush somewhere. So, couldn‚Äôt touch the desserts. But, I‚Äôve actually heard good thing about them and they‚Äôre a definite try on my next visit.

Overall, the place is enjoyable and a positive vibe comes from within. And finally, somebody had thought of using sufficient lighting for the interiors, and that‚Äôs definitely appreciated. Thanks Nawwarah for hosting us ‚Ä¶

Located bang opposite the Quest Mall and a couple of steps further from the famed sweet shop Mithai, Nawwarah ‚Äì Food Nawwarahwhich in Moroccan I reckon means bedazzling, is truly an experience in itself. Before the food appeared, I was most taken in and transported in a middle eastern setting with intricate and colourful awnings, lacquered chairs, brass encrusted swings, delicately carved mirrors and lush yet subdued carpeting. The premises boast of a restaurant and also a lounge with a free flowing seating arrangement. There are even stuffed toys strewn here and there in case the lil‚Äô one wants to hug one! The ornate and intricately carved chandelier is the piece-de-resistance in the lounge.
The food that we were served literally made me forget my woes of a vegetarian staple during my recent trip. We started off with mock tails and were served mock tails such as Safe Sex on The Beach, Atomic Cat and Guava Delight. Food NawwarahThe Safe Sex on The Beach was presented with a cherry on top and was rather sweet having cranberry juice. I personally felt it was a bit too sweet. The Atomic Cat had a punchline of ginger and orange juice and had a taste of Basil leaves. What got me going was the Guava Delight. Having a red dry chilli as a decoration this packed a nice kick when drunk. The taste of Guava is rather deceiving and then the shot of chilli hits you hard. Definitely recommended for the adventurous!
There were two special Valentines drink served. Valentine Special Mocktail With Rose Caviar was sweet with rose caviar crystals rolling off in the tongue. Soothing and the presentation of this drink looked like a million dollars and clinched the deal. The other drink was Sweet 16 which had a strawberry creamy foam on top and had orange juice as a base.
First what arrived was the Nanza‚Ä¶ lest you ask what is that, let me elucidate. It is a cross between a Nan and a pizza. The soft Nan portions having a cheesy topping and sprinkled with oregano and other herbs, when dipped in the Dal Makkhani, served in a small bucket, just tasted out of the world. It is a brilliant concept of having married our Nan and their pizza.
We then had the Nawwarah Platter. The Nawwarah Platter is the mixed grilled platter. This is the best vegetarian grilled platter that I have had honestly. The mushrooms were flavourful and tender, the potatoes stuffed and perfectly cooked. The Paneer left a lot to be desired for and to me tasted bland. However for the rest of the items, this is strongly recommended.
Food NawwarahThe Paneer Khurchan is one of the best I have eaten. This is a dish where vegetables cut julienne is tossed around with Paneer with a dash of tomato puree and tomato sauce, sprinkled with Kasoori Methi and garnished with Coriander leaves.
Another highlight of what we tried was the Amritsari Kulche. Chana cooked to perfection had onions served inside conical papads. Delightful to see as well as eat!
The Four Cheese Pizza is an absolute must-have in Nawwarah. A thin crust pizza with a topping of cheese only like Mozzarella and Cheddar! Absolute melt-in-your-mouth.
The Arabian Falafel Rolls were interesting, both to look at and to eat. The Hummus served along with the rolls was also good.
The Asparagus Risotto was an enviable green and is cheesy as expected with a side of Garlic Bread. We were also served Open Sandwich with a basket of French fries and sauce.
The Dessert section at Nawwarah is an absolute gastronomical delight. It caused foodgasm literally!
Masala Chai Ice Cream is unique and a must-try. The masala chai is given separately and needs to be infused in the ice cream for that kick!
The Baked Gulab Jamun is something I hadn‚Äôt come across before. The presentation looked like a painting and I was practically loathe to eat it up!

After quite a hectic day, I visited this restaurant . It was a bloggers meet and we were invited for a food tasting event. This newbie restaurant is very easy to find out as it is just opposite to the Quest Mall. 

When you get inside the restaurant, you will automatically feel very vibrant inside because of the colorful decor inside. When I was going upstairs to the Lounge, the first thing which caught my attention was beautiful photographs hung on the wall. It will lift up your cravings for wanderlust. 

Now coming to food

In the Mocktails section,  we have been served Safe sex on the beach, Atomic Cat, Guava Delight, Valentine special Mocktail with Rose Caviar and Sweet Sixteen.  Safe sex on beach was a mixture of  cranberry , peach nectar and grapefruit. At first, when I had it after Guava Deligh, it thought it as a bit mild. Later, when I had it with main food items, I find it quite good and refreshing.  

Atomic Cat is a mixture of Orange juice, basil, ginger syrup and mint. I find it okay but the presentation was very eye catching.  

Guava Delight was presented with a big red chili on the top of the glass. It was presently with a masala rim , so when I was having it, It was very different and refreshing. Its a must try for all. 

Sweet sixteen was presented with Strawberry foam on the top of it. I find it a nice drink. 

Valentine Special Mocktail with Rose Caviar was a nice drink, I got the real taste  of it after stirring it well, then I had it. 

Then we started having the main food. 

At first, we had Nazza. It is a mini sized crisped naan topped with cheese and baked with zaatar powder . I liked the taste as the cheese was perfect. It has been served with Daal with cream sprinkled on top of it. 

Nawwarrah Platter- This is a plate full of Multani Mushroom Kebabs, Paneer tikka and Tandoori stuffed Aaloo. I find the mushroom kebab the best among these three. Panner tikka could have been a bit more salty , according to me. It was served along with green chutney and salad. quantity is quite sufficient in this dish. 

Paneer Kurchan- It was a paneer dish with vegetables. I really liked the dish. 

Amritsari Kulche- the Masaladar chole with stuffed Kulche was perfect. I really liked the way they presented the Mukka Pyaaz inside papad. 

Open Sandwich- This sandwich was served with cheese on top , french fries and additional sauces. The taste was decent. 

Arabian Falafel Rolls- It was mind blowing and, I loved the taste of both hummus and salad. 

Four Cheese Pizza- It was a thin crush pizza served with four types of cheese on the top of it. It was truly awesome. 

Asparagus Risotto- This item has been served along with cheese, asparagus, garlic bread and other herbs. I liked it . 

Then we went to the dessert section.

Masala Chai Ice Cream- there is a saying that all is well that ends well. This goes appropriately with it. This item was a hidden gem. the texture of the ice cream was very proper and the taste of tea was coming through it. A special thumbs up for this. 

Baked Gulab Jamun- It was beautifully served along with Rose caviar and vanilla ice cream. I liked it. 

As I had rush to go back home, I could not try another dessert called Milky Bar. I have heard from my friends that it was mind blowing as well. The dessert section of this joint is truly awesome.

I could have given this joint 4.5 but, I would not repent for a second to give it 5 out of 5 because, I would love to come back here again and again. As a pure non- vegetarian food lover, I was so glad to try out the vegetarian dish in  this joint. The vibrant decor inside the lounge can be a perfect mood lifter. When you will go back home, you will be charged up. So a special thumbs up. 

Happy Eating, folks.
Thank you for this pictures

Every year during the Durga Pujas in Kolkata, there is this intense riot of colours and dazzle all over the city but for me the twin pandals of 66 palli and Badamtala have always stood out as being consistently being the most colourful ones. They not only do up their pandals but paint the neighbouring houses as well! Nawwarah (which stands for ‚Äòbrilliant‚Äô, ‚Äòdazzling‚Äô in Urdu) stands out in a similar way. As soon as you step in, there is this mesmerising brilliance of colours all over that cocoons you in the warmest of panda hugs.(You can quite literally hug one of the stuffed ones lying around!).

This is a beautifully well decorated place located right opposite of Quest Mall in Park Circus area.
We went there on Saraswati Puja and loved the ambience and services they provided to us.
The presentation of food was very good.The lounge is very well designed and is not like other typical hangouts.

We Ordered: Atomic Cat,Safe sex on the beach,Chocolate Martini,Four cheese pizza,Paneer multani tikka and Nachos.

Atomic cat was made with orange juice and mint leaves.It was decent but tasted a bit bitter.
Second was 'safe sex on the beach' which was made out of cranberry juice which was great.
Four cheese pizza, as the name suggests it has 4 types of cheese.Made perfectly with a thin crust.It was delicious.
Nachos was good and served with cream cheese and salsa dip.
At last we opted for Chocolate Martini.Though it was a mocktail but we it great as our desert.A big hollow chocolate Ball filled with vanilla ice cream and choco chips served in a cocktail glass.

Food presentation was very good but taste was even better.Staffs were really well behaved and co-operative.Prices are also reasonable as they don't charge any additional taxes. ¬†
This is a perfect place to hang out with friends,family and loved ones.

If anyone wants to have an awesome veg meal then please visit Nawwarah, you will really enjoy the taste.....
Highly Recommended

Nawwarah is one of the new restaurants to have opened in the city in 2016-17. I visited the place a week ago. Shisha and alcohol weren't available then, so I cannot comment on the quality of either. 

First off - the seating in the lounge area is a little uncomfortable. With such spacious interiors, the seating could have been much, much better. We ordered the nachos, garlic bread, quesadillas, khow suey and the burger and i can safely say the taste is nothing to complain about; in fact - it's on the better side of the scale so to speak. 

However, I think for a slightly higher pocket pinch, the portions are too small for groups of 4. I doubt it's a good feeling to have your food leaving you want for more (:/). 

Nawwarah has some fantastic mocktails and I think that's one of the highlights. Even the desserts are alright. 

For the price point, quantities need to be improved.

Its located right opposite quest mall. Quite a well-lit, clean place. Loved the ambience. Though cannot say the same about the food.

We were a group of 12 who went there to celebrate my birthday. After having read all the Fantastic reviews of this place n knowing that the "ganpati" tag is attached to it, i was quite excited n had booked a table in advance.
We sat in the fine dining area. We were given a seat bang near the exit door. So it was quite disturbing with all the guests continously coming n leaving üòï

The food was okay. Not bad. But definitely not great at all.
We had ordered jai veeru which was aalu n paneer tikka served with mint chutneu. It was good.
Had ordered manchow soup, tomato soup which were okay. Nothing great.
The bread basket was a big disaapointment. The naan was cold n hard.
The daal n paneer were again nothing to write home about.
Service is definitely slow. Its not exactly on the pricier side but not cheap either.

There were candle stands kept on the table but were unlit. What was the purpose of keeping them if you arent going to light it?

I may go here again to try the Lounge section. Never visiting the fine dining again.

One of the BEST place for Pure Veggies. It's really the King of all Veg restaurants.
Located in a Prime area is a big plus point.
Valet parking really surprised me.
Warm & courteous staff, well trained waiters who knows the menu well.
Excellent Royal like ambience.
Deliciously yummy food. All the items ordered were finger licking good. Had a proper 4 course dinner, but were still craving for more because of the amazing taste.
If you haven't been there, you are really missing the speciality restaurant.
Its a kind of restaurant which you will love going again & again.
I wish they always maintain the same quality of service.

Okkay this place was on my wishlist for the past two months!! After a failed attempt today I landed here finally!!  And trust me it wasn't  dissapointing..  The place was worth the wait.. The hype about this place is real too.. It's meant to be that way!!  The decor is exactly the way they show.. Even more happening!! 
It is very easy to locate, just opposite Quest!! The food tastes really good and the best that I had today was basil pesto macaroni!! A place worthy enough to be on one's mind and wishlist!! 
Enjoyed totally!!
Thank you :)

The best thing about this place cannot be put forward in just a few lines, although I'll try. I honestly went there seeing the ratings in zomato and, I was not be disappointed at all. The place, with its decor to its ambience, to its location, to its lighting, it's just a pleasure that kolkata is getting more such cafes. The food was good although the variety wasn't that great and so I rated 4.5, otherwise it's one of the most amazing places to visit. Be to with your friends, or with your better half, or with your family, or with your special person, it does truly amaze you every second of your stay.
Cheers to the whole team for putting up such a show!

It a pure veg restaurent located bang opposite Quest mall just beside Domino's. The decor was very attractive in Morrocon theme. The tables were bigger than what we usually see in other restaurents so there was no messing up and plenty of space to keep  the ordered food. We ordered soups and corn tulip for starters. Corn tulip was new concept presentation eise as well as taste wise. All soup were also good. Then we ordered panner, pindi chola and dal makhani for main course and also baingan ka bartha
 All were good but the gravy were little bit more sweet and the taste can be improved by making the gravy little less sweet. Then finally we ordered its signature dessert called Milky way. It was made live on our table with liquid nitrogen. It was a treat to out eys but unfortunately  not for our tase buds. Over all good ecperience and will recommend  others

One of the places with the worst services in Kolkata.

Mind blowing food, striking Moroccan interiors and impressive customer service makes this place a must visit. All the Jain foodies here can also rejoice as most dishes they told us, can be prepared to suit your preferences.

FOOD -
We ordered for corn tulips, masala papad and lemon coriander soup for starters. All were good and quantity was sufficient. For main course we opted for North Indian. If you are more than 4 people, it is recommended to order for the bread basket. We did the same as we were 6 of us. It is comparatively economical. Our breads were masala kulcha, butter roti, cheese naan, lachha paratha and pudina paratha. The breads were great in taste and were soft. Sabzis we ordered were paneer kofta, tadka and mixed veg. All were excellent in taste and quantity was also sufficient. For drinks we ordered Popcorn Mojito, Cranberry juice, Berry shake, Strawberry shake and Atomic cat. Atomic cat and cranberry juice were ok. Popcorn mojito was different and everyone liked it, including my dad.

SERVICE
Service was good. They were attentive to our requirements and had knowledge about the items on the menu.

On the 2nd floor they also have a cafe and lounge.

We had a pleasant lunch time and I'm looking forward to visit again to try the molecular dessert bar.

Nawwarah is a pure veg restaurant located just opposite to Quest mall. It offers lounge as well as restaurant service to the customers. I had no prior plans to visit this restaurant, so didn't know that the restaurant opens only after 7 pm .. Waited at the lounge area which was beautifully decorated in Moroccan theme.. The restaurant service began soon.. Honestly speaking , I'm not a big fan of veg food that's why I ended up ordering soup (Minestrone verde) and mushroom & vegetable lasagna. Soup tasted average. But the lasagna was GOOD! So,
Location: 5/5
Food: 4.5/5
Decor: 10/5 lol!!!
Ambience: 5/5
Service & Price: 5/5
It's definitely a must visit for veg food lovers :)

Had a nice time here a few weeks ago. Had Four Cheese Pizza, which was of very thin crust, but tasty...cud have been bigger in size for foodies like me! And the Caramel Mochachino and Safe Sex on the beach mocktails were very well made. Added to this was the serene ambience and nice, unique decoration of the place.

A great place to eat and enjoy earlier has lost its fortuity because of its horrible and arrogant management! We are reviewers and had initially praised a lot about this place. But, now, taking into account the recent responses by the management towards the reviews/feedback given by general public, along with the unprofessional and mocking behavior shown towards many a people by denying them entry for some uncalled for swagger.
'We would not recommend this place to any of our followers'.
Certainly not worth it!

Also, now we feel guilty of promoting a restaurant such as this!

Oh.my.goodness. Kolkata , your dessert heaven has arrived.  It's only right that your surroundings make you feel as happy as the dessert does, and this place delivers! We loved the Milky Way Dessert-- it was "out of this world" üòâ(see what I did there?) lol . The chef was so friendly and the staff was so excited and happy to serve . Kunal, one of the owners, sat down and explained the heart behind this little diamond, causing us to love it (and him) even more. If you want to have fun with friends , eat a tasty dessert, be welcomed by friendly staff, and feel good surrounded by bright and happy colors, look no further . I can't wait for our next night at Nawwarah. Thank you for bringing even more joy and happiness to this city with your presence . üòç

Marwari?? Gujrati?? Veggie?? Or even if u r not one of them, u will fall in love with this place. Managed by the reputed Ganpati Caterers, this place is a gem in d Park Circus crowd. Loved the ambience and loved the food. Pure Rajasthani shaan baan wali feeling. The staffs are a bit dumb but the experience of just being there with family or friends is appetizing.Try baigan bharta and mirch parantha. And Milky way was really that wayüòú. One of the best vegitarian rests in d city. Loved it.

Nawwarah means brilliant, dazzling and radiant and that is exactly what this place is full of! Without wasting time let me tell you about my experience:

Location - It couldn't have been located at a better place. It's right opposite to Quest Mall.
Ambience - Nothing like you've ever seen in Calcutta. The lounge area (where we were seated) is amazing! The seats are comfortable, the music is good and a special mention to all the carefully selected portraits that brought an ear-to-ear smile on my face while climbing the flight of stairs!
Service - They have a very well mannered and courteous staff who go out of their way to make your visit special and memorable! The service was quick and they were extremely accommodating! Kudos guys!
Food - We ordered Lucknowi Tunde Kebab and Paneer Khurchan (mini meal). The Paneer Khurchan is a must-try, both the Paneer and the Dal were to die for! Very yummy! The Kebab was okayish not as good as the mini meal! We had also ordered a mocktail (Guava Delight) and as expected it was brilliantly prepared!

All in all it was a wonderful experience, I had been meaning to visit this place for quite sometime but I had no idea that it would be this good! Thumbs-up and job well done guys! Keep up the good work! Thank you for a wonderful evening! üòá
(P. S. - I'll visit this place again very soon!)

Nawwarah, in Arabic means 'dazzling', the interiors really do justice to the name. Located just opposite Quest Mall, this Moroccan cafe is three storied.
Very royal ambience, completed with chandeliers. The seating arrangement is very comfortable and they even have beautiful vintage swings.
It feels like you are taken back in time.

Now coming to my order:
Lemon Ice Tea: Very refreshing.
Caramel Moccachino: Impeccableüëåüëå
Nachos: The presentation was amazing but taste was satisfactory.
Masala Chai Ice cream: Very good.
Black Forest Ice cream: Excellent.

The service is fast and staffs are courteous. Highly recommended.

Visited this place for a friend's birthday . The place is divided into a restaurant and a lounge. The restaurant however is comparatively smaller than the lounge  but still the interior of the restaurant is very spacious with comfortable seatings. The staff is very friendly and courteous.  We had ordered a nawwarah platter  which was absolutely delicious. Of course the quantity wasn't too much but sufficient for two. Coming to the desserts , chocolate martini is worth trying and there are a few live desserts like the milky way which is drool worthy !

Nawwarah is located just opposite of Quest Mall, Ballygunge. The interior is fabulous and unique. Well decorated. Comfortable sitting.
For starters we ordered Jai Veeru which was nyc n tasty and Crispy Chilly Baby corn which was good. Soups were decent. Main course was good but I liked yellow dal more. But they should increase their portion. According to me portion of food was less. And the best part of my lunch was my drink üçπ Chocolate Martiniüòä.

This place is just over the top and in your face right from the time you enter. The interior designer sure went overboard. As for food it had the most pathetic food, completely lost my appetite after tasting the first dish. We ordered the lentil salad and all I could taste in it was mustard , so pungent that it was difficult to eat even a bit . On telling the staff the lentil salad was replaced but it was no better . We also ordered the Thai platter in which they served kimchi, som tam salad and green curry with rice. For the kimchi the most rotten cabbage was used but the son tam and green curry was edible , not the best but not the worst either. The only plus is that the place is very light on the pocket and does not burn a hole.

When it comes to food..would rate that great too..marvellous presentation...
From day 1 to now hell lot of improvements and its a place which promises to keep improving..and it does too..
Desserts here are to die for...would really recommend this place atleast once to all..cause I'm sure if someone comes here once he will definitely come again...:)

One of the places where you wish if you can give a score of 6/5. On entering we saw two sections with separate entries a restaurant and another being lounge. The resturant is comparitavley small and was full, so we went to the lounge. The interiors is fabulous, unique from the ground floor to the lounge area, all is well thought of and built. Its neat and bright, brings positive vibes. Firstly we were served with water which was flavoured, basil and lemon flavoured to be specific, which was a refreshing surprise, didn't find this concept else where.

Ordered 2 mocktils, first a 'popcorn mojito', this is a must have here, never imagined a drink with popcorn in it. It was basically sweet lime + porcorn flavour. Second was 'safe sex on the beach' which was made out of cranberry juice which was decent. Wanted to try spider web(it has tobasco sause in the mocktail) but wasn't available. Even the caramel moccachino was cool (cold coffee and caramel)

Tried nawwrah platter, which was a kabab platter, mushrooms cannot be this great again. Even cheese maggie was made perfectly, noodles intentionly dry and cheese loaded, full to perfect.

Tried 2 pizza, four cheese pizza, as the name suggests it has 4 types of cheese, loved the goat cheese, seldom do I find it in Kolkata. The tandoor vegetable pizza was followed after it, it was even better, it was exactly what pizza would have been had it been invented in north India, full on Indian flavours. The pasta we ordered was flat but this would not overshadow the nice impression this place has set upon us. Will visit once again for the resturant and also for the lounge for sure.

Hm. Nawwarah!! Had a bad experience, with this one. This 1.0 is just for your decor, the rest is bad. Work on your service please. There was no taste in food taking starters,main course in count. Me being a lover of deserts, I didn't had the guts to even order one. 
I asked a service guy what is in this, he replied it is written in the menu nothing much to explain. I said ok,thanks!! 
Was bad and got worst with this reply.
For me 1st impression is your last one, which got just screwed up!

Fantastic place..The whole place makes you feels like you are in a Royal Rajasthani Fort..The place is Traditionally classy with a tinge of Modern Day Music..No complaints on food as the goodwill of Ganpati Caterer is enough to draw customers.. Finger licking yummylicious food..üëç However they should improve on their service..It needs to be a little fast..A must visit guys..Don't miss out...The milky way desert..It's worth every penny spent.

Exactly opposite Quest Mall, Ballygunge. The opulent ornamentation of the place is a treat to the eyes. From floral printed sofas to the astounding sheesha, everything stands class apart. Food: We order some tikka platter. The potatoes were finger lickin' good. The live presentation of Milky Way dessert was amazing. Surely visiting this place again.

Nawwarah is a venture by one of the most reputed caterers in Calcutta - Ganpati, located opposite Quest Mall at Ballygunge. It has a fine dine restaurant as well as a lounge. We went to the lounge on the 3rd floor but due to limited options, we decided to shift to the fine dine section.

Upon entering Nawwarah, if one decides to go the lounge, he will see walls decorated by beautiful photo frames near the staircase. The lounge is bound to catch everyone's eyes. It has traditional Rajasthan-styled Royal sofas and chairs and jhulas. The place is brightly lit up. Even the fine dine looks very royal and traditional. The ambience sure deserves a 4/5.

Coming to food, we ordered a Veg Au Gratin, a basket of assorted naans in which we had ordered for Cheese Naan, Masala Kulcha, Paneer and Pyaaz Kulcha and Afghani Naan. However, probably due to some miscommunication, we were not served Cheese Naan. We also ordered Daal Tadka and Butter Paneer Masala. Needless to say, each of the aforesaid items stood out. The Paneer Pyaaz Kulcha was the clear winner of the entire lot. The Veg Au Gratin was DELICIOUS with vegetables cooked to perfection.

In case of mocktails, we ordered a Safe Sex On the Beach which was basically a cranberry mojito and it sure deserves a 4/5, an Atomic Cat which I found average and would rate it 3/5 and a Chocolate Martini, which was the best part about the entire evening. It had a chocolate ball which had cold chocolaty liquid inside it and was surrounded by beautiful shards of white and pink and dark chocolate. It deserves a full 5/5.

For dessert, we decided to try their signature Milky Way. The chef made it right in front of us and the entire process was a delight to our eyes. The chef used Liquid Nitrogen to create the ice cream inside a chocolate ball, surrounded with various sauces and a colorful platter. The decoration seemed wonderful but when it comes to the taste, I would not rate the main ice cream inside the chocolate ball anything above 3.5/5.

Definitely looking forward to visiting Nawwarah again to enjoy more of its Indian food.

All is not lost and there are times where someone does step up to the mantle, making you believe that at least something which glitters is indeed gold just like the owner, Kunal Gupta at this magnificent place. 

Spawning out the average Calcuttan's pronounced hesitance to navigate through the city's grime and traffic to enjoy a decent meal, a slew of Moroccan project is taking the city by a storm. 

Nawwarah needs no introduction as the place talks about it all. While the place has been around since December'16 now, it was only last week that I got an opportunity to be wooed by the charms of this chic looking restaurant that promises and delivers food with a dynamic twist that will leave you hankering for more.

The service is mechanically perfect and is totally attentive without being intrusive. 

While a lot of their ravishing looking food has been splashed across social media, the ultra-fine job that the dessert bar does deserves a standing ovation. If you look at the bang you get for your buck, this is one of the best meals you can get in the city.

Overall, Nawwarah blends great food with extremely courteous service, a beautifully designed Moroccan ambiance, and a legacy that is characteristic to the fledgling days of India‚Äôs modish dining scene where the customer was indeed the king and bringing a great experience to the fore was considered more important than raking in the moolah!

As for whether I would recommend a visit to Nawwarah, I doubt that‚Äôs hardly a question anymore!

Heard a lot about this place but was disappointed on the first sight of the order that reached the table... Big things come in small packages but here costly things come in small packages.. The portion of food that you serve is so less... This was the first turn down for me... The pieces of paneer were so small in already a small portion.... They have called it a cafe but it's a fine dining restaurant and uniform of the service staff doesn't go well with the decor, new restaurant but uniforms were shabby.... Even the waiters didn't inform about the small portion so that we could order accordingly... Food was not that great considering the hype...

This is the most royal looking fine dine restaurant I have ever been to. The staffs were well behaved. Thay greeted us with a smile. Service was pretty fast. I think in mere 10 mins we got our starters on our tables.
#We ordered Jai & Veeru as starter which was awesome.
#atomic cat & Guava delight for Mocktails- couldn't have been better. It tasted great!
#shaam savera & daal makhaani- Loved it‚ù§
#nawwarah bread basket- consisted of any 5 breads of your choice- was greatly complementing the curry.
#dessert- we just said the staff to bring what best they have & yes they astonished us with that live dessert. It was heaven.
And yet atlast I want to thank Kunal Gupta, you took a lot of time to open this gem but You nailed it bro. Congratulations to youüòä

Look i want to say a few things,no disrespect to the foodie community in Kolkata,they give good and honest reviews but these restaurants behave completely different when you're on a testing trip and when a normal person shows up the food and service is completely different.

Coming to this place,its very close to my office,i had food from here twice.
1st time take out it was very avg,had some rice,begun varta,dal,panner tikka ,it was oky,then i saw the bill it was too much,and the quantity was not good. Saw the decor on Zomato,and wanter to come here to try some more.

So i came here, ordered some food,they took forever to serve even the 1st course,then more waiting for some dal, the quantity was again bad.
I saw some other tables calling for food as they were late too. I didn't get the time to review it last week,so when i opened the page today saw some other people complaing too.

It was not an good experience at all,1st of you guys are a veg resto then you have this kind of service. Wtf!

And to the other foodies reviewed it please visit normally one day and see how really they work.i have seen many restaurants like this,and many of them get shit reviews for that now.

Went to Nawwarah yesterday with my family.. The place is nice & food is decent. But rating may come down soon, if these things are not taken care off-

1. The service is very very slow. The waiters are confused and do not recognize the order when its bought from the kitchen

2. The food served to us was ABSOLUTELY COLD. Huge dissapointment comes when the food for which you have been waiting comes absolutely cold. 

3. The repeat order was for dal makhni, 1st one was totally thick and creamy and of right consistency. The repeat was thin & runny, as if they fell short of the dal and started mixing water in it, just how many puchkawalas do when they start running out of water

4. The staff is very very confused. They dont understand the order. They simply nod and then keep on running behind the head waiter who asks and confirms.

5. Have you seen any fine dining where you have to keep on asking for the onions & pickles and they still dont get it even when u have started eating your meals?

6. Overall expirence was pleasant, but they need to work on all these issues.

Located bang opposite Quest Mall.  Managed by Sanjay Ganpati, the famous caterer. 

The have restaurant on the ground floor,  cafe and lounge on above floors.  All are not yet operational. 
The decor is very soothing. Artwork and ancient artefacts adorn the place. 

Coming to the food part.  The food tasted very average.  The worst part is the quantity they give.  that's probably not complete even for a couple.  The service was good.

Starters

Built¬†on¬†Syed Amir Ali Avenue, across Quest Mall is our newly established¬† Moroccan restaurant-¬†Nawwarah.¬†In Arabic, this very word means ‚Äúdazzling‚Äù.¬†. Well, why would it not mean that? A sparkling new three storey building with¬†dining and lounging facilities both but at their respective settings. And if you are not the kind of person who likes to talk about ambiance a lot, we can certainly get into that later. Let us talk food first, shall we?

Nawwarah a much awaited place is finally open it's door to public. The moment I heard the news I take my couple of friends and do a walk in here. When we visited here lounge in it's final touch up but dine in area was completely ready to serve. So we tried some of their dishes, mocktails and a dessert.
Established in three floored building. Ground floor was dine in area and both first & second floor was lounge cum hookah bar. 
It was located in balligunje area in front of Quest mall.
Ambience was completely royal. Designed and decorated in rajasthani mansion style. There are classic Chandelier's. Royal looking tables and seats. Mansion style walls. Cousins with rajasthani touch. In second floor there is old rajasthani royal jhoola and lighting were also classy. Hospitality was very impressive friendly and well trained staff. They manage to take care of their customers very well. Service was in reasonable time and presentation was really nice.
Let's see what we tried starting with mocktails.
* Atomic Cat - Orange Mojito made with tanginess of oranges and lemons, refreshment of mint and basil leaves and bitterness of oranges zest and Ginger. Taste was amazing and well balanced.
* Save Sex on the Beach - Save because it was the virgin version didn't contain vodka. Traditional sex on the beach drink without alcohol but other ingredients are same. Made with perfectly measured quantities of peace, orange and cranberry juice. Build all ingredients in a highball glass filled with ice. Garnish with orange slice and cranberry.
* Guava Delight - This was my personal favorite drink. Made with the delicious combination of guava juice and dry chillies with hint of lemon juice and some chat masala. Taste was amazingly delicious little tangy, spicy and refreshing. Recommended.
* Popcorn Mojito - That's something unique we tried. Classic virgin mojito made with refreshment of mint leaves and tanginess of lemon juice with the twist of popcorns in it. We can feel the flavour of popcorns in every sip with the classic taste of Mojito. Served with popcorns in crystal bowl above the glass and garnished with mint leaves and lemon slice.
* Smashed Rosemary & Blueberry - We tried the virgin version but procedure of making was same. Gently muddle blueberries, rosemary leaves, and simple syrup in the bottom of a cocktail shaker. Add lemon juice and shake, covered, with ice vigorously for 10 seconds. Strain through a mesh strainer into a tall glass of fresh ice. Top with blueberries and Rosemary leaves.
* Chocolate Martini - Here comes the shows topper. Looks like a dessert but a beverages origin drink. Served in Martini glass garnished with three chocolates in sides white, strawberry and dark chocolate. Thick liquid cold coffee comes in a chocolate ball. Taste and looks both were amazing.
We tried some snacks with them also - 
* Jai & Veeru - We have tandoori aloo and Hariyali paneer in this. Roasted  potatoes were crispy, spicy and tastes amazing. spicy coriander chatni marinated grilled paneer was also impressive. Served with Coriander chatni and marinated onions. name of the dish was heavenly.
* Stuffed Mushroom - Crispy coated mushrooms stuffed with liquid cheese and hint of lemon essence. Crispy and so cheesy. Very delicious in taste served with mint mayo.
* Veg Spring Roll - spicy peeled vegetables coated in spring roll which was perfectly fried and very less oily tastes really good. Served with dry red chillies dip.
Before the main course we have a soup called    Minestrone Verde Soup reviewed below - 
* Minestrone¬†is a hearty Italian vegetable¬†soup¬†that can be stuffed with just about any veggies your heart desires! It goes green in thisminestrone verde, which is filled with the bright flavors of leeks, zucchini, peas, kale, and basil pesto. Heat frying pan and add oil along with onion, garlic and leeks and saute until soft. Add to a large pot along with the vegetable broth. Bring to a boil then add the pasta and lower to medium heat. Stir frequently so that pasta does not stick together. Saute the zucchini and fennel in a little more olive oil and when soft add to pot. When the pasta is almost done, add the peas, pesto and spinach. Let cook a few more minutes until spinach has wilted and pasta is cooked. Season with salt and pepper. Then it‚Äôs ready to serve.
In Main course we had - 
* Veg Au Gratin - A traditional continental delicacy served with warm and crisp breads, Vegetable Au Gratin features all your favourite veggies drowned in white sauce, topped generously with cheese, and baked till the cheese melts. Choose crisp, juicy, mildly flavoured veggies like carrots, peas and French beans for this baked dish, and avoid pungent or gooey ones like eggplant, onions and tomatoes.
* Kofta Saam Savera - Saam Savera was the typical name which you find in almost every dine in restaurant of rajasthan. Mainly used for spinach and cream vegetables. Finely chopped spinach koftas with creamy center cooked in spicy red gravy tastes heavenly delicious.
* Kali Dal - The Traditional north indian Dal makhani think, creamy and spicy. Very delicious in taste. Feels like cooked in home.
* Tawa Veg - Rajasthani style spicy mix Vegetables perfectly made and tastes really good.
* Bread's - in Bread's we tried naan which was good. Paratha which was also good and ulta tava paratha which was heavenly a must try.
* Kashmiri Pulao - lite spicy butter Pulao with cashew, raisin, apple and veggies. True kashmiri flavour tastes amazing.
At last we tried the shows topper dessert. Costly looking heavenly delicious pocket friendly priced dessert. * Milky Way -  White cardboard painted with green and pink coloured liquid creams then topped with macaroons, sponge cake, berries, three different sauces and whipped cream in chocolate ball and many sweet things all in liquid nitrogen. Rich, colourful and delicious. Highly recommended.
Before rapt up like to thank management team and staff for this wonderful experience. A must visit place. Personal favorite. Highly recommended to all.

Even though the restaurant logo has my name on it,
My son Kunal who is the MD wanted me to be a critic on this one.

Okay so, 
Kunal had worked immensely on the interiors and he has redefined Fine-Dine & Happy-Lounging interiors.
He knows the vibe of 'chilling' .
The food is top notch but the service needs some fixing which will be done within one month of place usage. He has a lot in his inventory in thoughts of presentation.

Wait for the blast,
He's a happy person who is very hungry to achieve a lot in his life with a lot of perfection.

I went to nawwarah twice the first experience I had was pretty good, but the second visit was rather disappointing. The ambiance is no doubt their plus point but their staff service  needs a lot of improvement.. other thing that disappoints is quantity.. not very sure if I will b willing to revisit. But do visit to check out their ambiance.

Exquisite ambience. Wonderful location just opposite Quest Mall. But, that's it. First of all, they should mention outside itself that it's a vegan restaurant. The options are too limited. The quantity is quite small. The taste is nothing extraordinary. All the marks only for the ambience and the polite staff.

"Nawwarah," the name has been going around the Kolkata circle from sometime around November. The name catches your attention, and makes you want to dig up some information. But these guys kept all the details uptight until the 25th of December, all we got to see was the Mughal era inspired logo!

Nawwarah stands for brilliance, and I am sure a lot has of blood and sweat has gone into setting up the magnificent palace. The restaurant is a first from the house of the famous Ganpati Caterers which adds to the pressure since they are quite famous in the market for their excellent food quality tag.

The place is divided into a restaurant section, a dessert portion and a lounge. We were received in the restaurant portion, the place reeks royalty in every nook and corner. It's almost like you have been transported to an era gone by. The dawaat halls that we see in the ruins today is what makes this royal destination. 

The wallpapers, the tiles lined along the walls, the chandeliers, the lamp shades, the chairs and the upholstery, the dining tables, the small lamps placed on the tables all live up to the Moroccan inspired set up. The music matches well with the decor. All kinds of possible mismatch that could possibly occur have been taken care of!

The food served is completely vegetarian. Nawwarah is a fine dining restaurant for the food lovers. The staff is well behaved and extremely well trained. They speak to you, take feedback and greet you with a smile.

¬†The mocktails tried were - Guava Delight, Atomic Cat, and Chocolate Martini.

¬†

The Chocolate Martini stood out. It is dessert but served as a mocktail. Two frozen chocolate balls and slided together and the center filled with coffee liquid. Tempered chocolate shards in chocolate and strawberry colors accompany the dessert. Served in a glass this one's a visual delight and a masterpiece! You break open the chocolate ball with your spoon and scoop out the liquid and gulp it down with the chocolate. 

Coming to the food, it was a wholesome lunch. Being a vegetarian joint, you might think what different or how different can the food be, it is the same old base, the same old preparation BUT brace yourself!!! The food is divine!

- Jai and Veeru: We all know the friendship of potato and paneer. They decided to dedicate the goodness in a plate and named them "best friends." The taste is excellent. Char grilled paneer and spiced potato served with pickled masala onions, green chutney and some green chillies. Never tasted better!!

- Veg Spring Roll: Best eaten the minute it is served on your table. The spring roll stuffing is not just greens but a perfect filling. The outer layer is thin and fried perfectly with no soaking oil. Served with a sweet chilli sauce, the best starter ever!

- Veg-Au-Gratin: Served in a "so called tiny" bowl but it is difficult for one person to finish it! The vegetables are so fresh and perfectly cooked. You take a bite and feel the crispness. The cheese is perfectly interspersed with the rich creaminess but the balance is well maintained.  You cannot get enough of this!

- Kali Daal: A part of the main course served inside an interesting bowl, the daal is cooked to perfection. Not too high on the cream or the ghee bit, tasted good with the kulcha or the naan or the paratha.

- Kofta Saam Savera: Another main course dish,  half cut paneer and spinach filled stuffed koftas served in a thick gravy. 
Paired best with naan, ulta tawa paratha and kulcha.

- Ulta Tawa Paratha: This is their specialty. The parathas are fried over overturned parathas. No dripping oil, but into sizeable portions. Can be paired easily with any mains.

- Milky way: However much I speak about this dessert, it is going to be less.  The place not just boasts of gastronomical molecular delight but showcases that as well. Brain child of the famous dessert chef, Sagar Nandi, this was a platter of cream, liquid nitrogen, solified ice, macaroons, sponge cakes and so on. You cannot help but fall in love with the dessert. Innovativeness and mesmerized talent is what makes up the live desserts!

The restaurant is conveniently located opposite to Quest Mall, they have valet parking as well. The lounge scores high on the famous swing, the floor design and the decor itself. This is an effort to give their patrons an opportunity to dine under such lavishness, one must take it up!

It's just horrible. Service is pathetic. They serve food on plates full of dust. The staff doest know the menu. V did not get a place in the fine dining Area which is ok so v went to 1st floor cafe, ambience is good but the sitting arrangements r so uncomfortable. V ordered quasidillas which were hardly edible. The main course was served n just after a few mins v realised that the plates were full of dust. 20 mins later they replaced the food which tasted pathetic. Then v ordered second round of breads which were followed 20 mins later with a complimentary cold dal. After I requested them to give me the bill. They don't even give finger bowls. Plz open 1 section n maintain a goodwill rather than opening 3. I would not like to rate this place. It was so disappointing. Service horrible. Food horrible. Bill has special food written instead of mentioning the item. Quantity is also very less. I'm sorry the ambience is good but no one can admire it wen the food n service is so pathetic.

Ok so we so visited this place expecting it to be awesome. But no. We had to go to first floor as we didn't reserve a table. That's okay. So now we order our food and most of the items are not available which they let us know after we ordered. Hmm okay. Waiting time is very annoying. Ordered 40 mins ago and then received my order. The food was quite bad. Wouldn't recommend it anyone. They were bringing the starters one by one. ü§ê

Nawwarah is situated right to the opposite of Quest Mall. This place is relatively new and I can bet they will mark their strong presence very soon. The interior and ambience is really beautiful and food is also pretty good. Loved this place.

"You cannot produce a baby in one month" and this quote rightly goes for this fine dining cum cafe and lounge.This place has faced consistent impede but once you enter this place all your cavil will be away.It literally stand upon on its name "Nawwarah" which means brilliant.In all aspects whether it be ambiance or service or food this place just rout out to find a place at the peak.

AMBIANCE-Nawwarah is sectionalized in to different sections.The ground floor is a dine-in area where,from the seating to the interiors has been been given a royal touch.On the above floor is the shack and lounge.This is the most quirky and detailed interiors i have seen in a lounge.Especially their royal swings,chandeliers and music playlist for each floors really steal the show.There is also a separate gastronomy-dessert parlour which is maintained by renowned chef Sagar Nandi and his live dessert making literally made us fight in order to consume it first.

FOOD-Being a pure vegetarian this place is a bliss for us.The variety with variation in dishes seems to satisfy our whim and fancies.We were here for a little tasting session and starting of with the mocktails(Special thanks to Salman Sheikh for presenting us such great mocktails)and preceding with starters,main course and dessert we had-

1:Guava Delight-This drink was prepared with a combination of guava and chillies and was extremely refreshing and that properly balanced tangy taste was commendable.

2:Chocolate Martini-This though looks like a desssert but is a mocktail and every element in it is edible.The presentation along with of top notch and tasted excellent.

3:Atomic Cat-This drink was a combination of ginger,orange,mint perfectly blended to give you a refreshig feel.

4:Jai and veeru-This starter comes with a combination of roasted potato and marinated paneer.The masala coating in potato and paneer was just fingerlicking.

5:Veg-Au-Gratin-This gratin was extremely good in taste.The veggies were properly boiled and the it was justp creamelicious.

6:Kofta Saam Savera-This main course dish comes with the thick,creamy gravy along with the dumplings of spinach and paneer.Tastes great when eaten with their ulta tawa parantha.

7:Ulta tawa parantha-Believe us that this was the best parantha we ever had and probably the 2nd best dish after their dessert.

8:Milky way:I wish i could upload its making video.It was an eye pleasing experience to see its live making.All the elements in it were made fresh and it seems like a plain canvas was painted.This was our favourite dessert and one of the best dishes we had.

We tried many more dishes at this place but these were the best we had.

Food-5/5
Service-4.5/5
Ambiance-5/5

Nawwarah is fine dining redefined. I expected a lot of things but once I entered the property my mind got blown. Firstly a big thank you to Foodzpah‚Äôs Shahbaaz Zaman for inviting me to this amazing lunch! ¬†Despite knowing this was a full veg property I did not have any apprehensions because I have had food from Ganpati‚Äôs caterer and I was prepared for the best. Located bang opposite the Quest Mall, Nawwarah stands tall. Kunal Gupta has singlehandedly taken this property to a new high.The interiors are so pretty and colourful that they will leave you awe struck.

The much awaited wait is over and Nawwarah which was in process has come to form. Nawwarah is Kunal Gupta‚Äôs masterpiece, who has worked very minutely to improve its every details. Take a look at Nawwarah. Standing opposite of Quest Mall, Nawwarah is a majestic Fine Dine restaurant and Lounge. Nawwarah was a young girl living in Middle East who died at very young age under some tragic circumstance, and the place is named after her. The idea behind Nawwarah was shaped from last six years, and its finally standing open.

Located bang opposite to Quest Mall, beside Domino's, this new place in town will mesmerize you with it's awesomely royal yet modern decor and ambiance.¬†

There are different floors, each designed beautifully, each having either lounge or ¬†dining set-up.¬†Even the walls by the stairs and the ceilings (with the beautiful chandeliers) too reflect a fine taste in art and will draw your attention for sure.

We were in a large group and tried a number of dishes. Listing down the best ones:

1. Stuffed Mushrooms: A mushroom and cheese delight presented beautifully and served with a unique dip that you are bound to like. A must order!

2. ¬†Jay and Veeru: Combination of Paneer Tikka with chilli coriander ¬†and the most delicious Tandoori aloo with aachari red pepper.

3. Veg Au Gratin: Spoon Licking Good! Quite heavy and filling.

4. Sham Savera : A delicious gravy, team it up with the Ulta Tawah Paratha. A heavenly combination!

5. Tawa Veg : You can customize this with your choice of gravy and vegetables. This dish is little spicy and goes well with Amritsari Kulcha, Butter Naan or Kashmiri Pulao.¬†

Service: Excellent!

Price: Reasonable.

Recommended!

Location : Bang opposie Quest mall, Beckbagan.

Finally the wait is over and the Vegeterian fine dine, Nawwarah, opens its doors in Kolkata. This place is truly¬†a masterpiece and it clearly reflects¬†the amount of hard work put in. I went there with few of my friends and was completely bowled over.

D√©cor & Ambience : Nawarrah is divided into 3 floors. If you want to go to the restaurant, take the right door. If you wanna go to the lounge upstairs, take the left door.

The restaurant : This place is AWESOME. From the furniture to the walls to the chandelier, everything gives a very royal feel to this place. Even the background music has a touch of royalty to it. This place is impeccably designed. From the expensive tiles on the walls to the¬†cutlery to¬†the marble table tops, every nook and corner of this restaurant is amazingly beautiful.

The lounge and the shack¬†: The first floor and second floor houses the lounge and the shack. This is the most elegant lounge you'll ever find. From the chic d√©cor to the quirky sofas to the much decorated swings, everything here screams Royal yet modern. Even the Royal music gives way to EDM on this floor. I was awestruck!

So, finally we settled down for lunch and the food was one of the best I've ever had.¬†Being a hard-core Non vegetarian, coming to love Nawwarah's food so much, I was surprised.

Mocktails : 

*Atomic Cat, Guava Delight, Popcorn Mojito, Smashed Rosemary & Blueberry and Chocolate Martini : Each one of the mocktails were unique in terms of presentation and taste. I loved each one of them. Hoever, I have to mention : The chocolate Martini was the best of the lot. IT had a huge chocolate ball (filled with liquid-y goodness) sitting at the centre, with pink,white and brown colored chocolate shards surrounding it. Delicious.

Food : 

* Jai and Veeru : This is basically a kebab platter of paneer and aloo. The green paneer kebab as well as the tandoori aloo tasted superb. The accompanying coriander dip was amazing!

*Stuffed mushrooms : This is was¬†soo good.

*Veg spring rolls : The spring rolls were nice and crispy, the filling was very tasty and the chili dip was lovely!

*Veg Au-gratin : THis dish was YUM! The cheese on top was lovely and gooey. The vegetables were exotic and cooked perfectly. Loved this dish.

*Koft saam savera : SO GOOD. Delictae moist koftas in a tangy gravy. I loved this dish.

* Kali dal : Lovely and creamy, this dal was bang on.

*Buttern naan, ulta tawa paratha : You have to try these breads to believe how good these are.

* Kashmiri pulao : Had lots of cashews, apples and other exotic ingredients in it and I liked it.

And Finally, the Dessert :

Milky Way : If zomato had the option of uploading videos, then I would've. This dessert is nothing but art, done by their pastry chef! He started¬†drawing ( read : putting different coloured ganache)¬†on a blank¬†canvas (read : platter) . Then he added broken up macaroons to it. Next he added green And black¬†olive and palm¬† sugar chutney sort of a thing. Next he put a hollow¬†chocolate ball , in which he sprayed in choux ban foam. He then poured in liquid Nitrogen inside the balls and the foam turned into ice cream. Then he broke the balls and voila the masterpiece was ready. There are¬† so so many techniques and elements involved in this dessert and he has perfected each one of those elements. This dessert sure bags a recommendation.

Service : Staff was extremely well-mannered, attentive and was doing their job the best way possible.

Doesn't matter if you're a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian, Nawwarah should be on the top of your wishlist if you're looking for a fine-dine restaurant in Kolkata.

I was lucky enough to get a special invitation along with group of foodies to have a lavish lunch.Let's start with the experience:

Location: Completely opp. Quest mall on the main road itself.

Ambiance: Nawwarah is divided into two sections Fine dining & lounge.I went at the fine dining and it feels grand. You feel you have stepped inside a Rajasthan mahal. It gives you a royal darbar kind of feeling. Everything is perfectly done starting from interior decoration,furnishings, as well as serving plates and bowls. They have spend huge and loads of planning has been done you will feel it. You won't feel a better fine dining experience at such price anywhere in Kolkata. Best fine dining restaurant I can say in Kolkata. Lounge is also beautifully decorated and is quite trendy and colourful. The place is perfect for every occasion.

Food: Sorry, to disappoint but they serve only vrg food. I am hardcore nonveg food lover and considered having veg food at a restaurant waste of money earlier. But, after dining here I can veg food tastes at par with non veg if well prepared. We started with list of welcome drinks which was offered to us. I loved Atomic cat , Smashed rosemary & blueberry the best. On starters Cheese stuffed mushroom was one of the item which mushroom lover will go crazy for. Also Jai & Veeru was equally good.On main course, kofta shyam savera was thick rich and super tasty. You should definitely try their ulta tawa parantha which was soft and crisp. Deserts were divine and one thing Everyone went crazy. Choux ban foam & macaroon platter is one thing you shouldn't miss whenever you visit.

Service: The service is of top quality and one thing which should be top notch to give you the fine dining experience. Their hospitality was one thing which will make you feel good.Loads of staffs are there to take care of you and the service was quick. Even the manager, chef and owner was kind enough to welcome us.

Conclusion: Kolkata's best fine dining veg restaurant.

Locatd exactly opposite to the Quest Mall, Nawwarah is a place where you feel kind of you are in Rajasthan. The ambience is just eye catching and having different sections. Staffs are good but they are not much considered about taking the reviews or being much more communicative. To talk about the dish the presentation and the requirements for each dish i.e. sauce was eye catching . Dishes which were served were amazing. Shakes were also too good. We tried a shake something named popcorn that was too good. Even ice tea was good. Overall it was a great experience will visit soon again

Located just opposite Quest Mall. Was waiting since months to visit the outlet by Ganpati Caterers. Ambience was superb had the feeling of Rajasthan resorts. Spacious. Divided into lounge area as well as proper dining. Staffs were polite. Service was slow, staffs were in a different world (ordered but not giving the proper items which we said, forgotten that one item was pending). Food quality was good, tasty. But the quantity was not even sufficient for one person, disappointed. We had ordered for Nawwarah special Shisha, Nachos, Caesar salad, Paneer Kurchan ( they gave a small butter naan in breads, which was very tiny), cheese garlic bread( firstly they forgot to add the cheese only), Nawwarah platter for kebabs, and mocktails such as chilli Guava and Spider web. They didn't had any menu for mocktails to give us. We went there in lunch time. Valet parking is available.
