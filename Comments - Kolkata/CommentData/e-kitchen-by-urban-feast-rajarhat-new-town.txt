The food was delivered on time and the chicken bharta was tasty but the quality of parathas could have been better. They were too oily and hard. Plus it would have been nice if there was some salad.

Had a good experience with the delivered egg fried rice and the bestseller Chilli chicken. A plate of each gladly serves two people. Best part was the chili chicken came in an exciting package and taste was equally good. Egg fried rice had enough egg content leaving no concern at all.  summing up, i enjoyed the episode and surely you will as well

One of the worst experiences I ever had. The order was placed and confirmed by the restaurant at 12:45pm but it wasnt delivered till 2:45pm. The phone nos were unresponsive and the only time I was able to get through, I was told that the order is still on its way. The distance between my place and the restaurant is just 5 km. So its just a lame excuse to make a family wait for lunch for 2 hours. DISGUSTING, NOT SURE HOW ZOMATO STILL HAS THEM IN THEIR LISTING.

To start off. The food was delivered after 1.5 hours, for a distance of 2 kilometers. Mentioned to make it less oily but was found floating in oil. The laccha paratha was good. The rui kaliya was very oily and was average in taste. Nothing extraordinary. Perhaps a bit over priced for the taste and service

Right now they have three outlets in Calcutta, 1st one is in the Theater road,. 2nd one is in sector 5 area and the 3rd one is in the Rajarhut New Town area inside Hidco Bhawan canteen section.
                                                                ...

Although the dal was really good, I didn't like the chicken that much but maybe it's because of my taste. I think there are scope for betterment . Also I would like to suggest if they can start thalis... Would be bang for buck.

I was being too lazy to write down this post and publish it. Then one fine evening when I was feeling too tired after the whole day work, someone pushed me from inside to put it down on paper. Sometimes there are so many words in your mind but still it‚Äôs so difficult to put them together and form a sensible sentence!

Urban feast is a young, passionate food processing & food tech company which focuses on the daily food problem of people living an Urbanized Lifestyle, thereby delivering diversified solutions for them in various modes of business. Founded by a young professional team headed by Mr. Sayantan Jana and backed with several years of experience from highly enriched professionals of the food & beverage industry.

Urban feast currently serving its customers with its two diversified brands namely

Urban feast: e-Kitchen & Urban feast WrapEx.

Nice downtown, slightly hidden location. Its actually located inside Hidco Bhavan Canteen complex. This cafeteria has a wide ranging menu and which can cater to a wide range of preferences considering the factor that there are many Indians who have come from different locations of India due to professional engagement. Variety would not certainly dictating their choice of food. The ambiance is ok and service is efficient without being overbearing and the kitchen and surroundings is clean and hygienic. Location is perfect being just off the Eco Space and there is adequate parking.

Open space, greeted warmly seated quickly. Prompt and friendly service. Lots of good options on the appetizers list. The dishes are delicious, texture of the ingredients was on point. The meat was sublime. Some of the best food I have ever eaten.

The Dishes We Had :

CHINESE FOOD

PAN FRIED CHILLI FISH - Batter fried fish tossed with red chilli sauce. Here's a dish that's perfect for a starter. Fresh, light and flavorful,  the spicy tangy flavour complements the fish beautifully.  Just love the surface! And the fish looks delicious. The picture is good, but the dish itself is even more incredible

Mix Hakka Noodles - Noodles tossed with Egg, Chicken & Prawn. Almost every one has a slight weakness over Chinese food. I am not any difference. Hakka noodles are something that can make even full grown adults feel like kids. Taste and flavour of this Noodles is totally unique. The dish has lots of vegetables, chicken, Prawn and also egg.

VEG FRIED RICE - Rice tossed with saut√©ed vegetables. Fried Rice is one of the most popular fried dishes in the world. This Veg Fried Rice includes lots of Vegetables and sauces giving it a unique tempting flavour and colour. The perfect long rice and rice is so aromatic you will love it so much..

THREE TREAT VEGETABLES - Vegetables  tossed with garlic  pepper sauce. Broccoli, baby corn and mushroom is a flavourful combination of fresh veggies and lemon grass. It is interesting to note that lemon grass, which is generally used as a garnish or flavouring agent, is used as a key ingredient in generous quantities in this recipe. The vibrant colours are retained to a large extent, making this dish a visual treat too.

KUNG PAO CHICKEN - Batter chicken tossed with less spicy red sauce & kaju nut. The classic dish in Sichuan cuisine is a spicy stir-fry dish made with chicken, peanuts (Kaju here) , vegetables, and chili peppers.  Spicy, sweet and incredibly delicious chicken. Made with a savory less spicy sauce here to keep it lighter.

CHINESE STIR FRY MUSHROOMS with Broccoli - Saute vegetables tossed with star anise & Worcestershire sauce. We all know the pleasures of good stir-fried dishes . There‚Äôs an ineffable taste about this dish that says ‚ÄúChinese,‚Äù and there are remarkable textures throughout. Good food with lovely light feeling !

INDIAN FOOD

BASANTI PULAO - Traditional Bengali yellow sweet pulao. Basanti, literally means a shade of yellow, it is the color of spring. The basanti pulao is slightly sweet in taste because of the use of sugar in it and so it goes well with very hot and spicy curries. This is my favourite type of Pulao.

KASHMIRI PULAO - Traditional Kasmiri  sweet pulao with dry fruits. Kashmiri Pulao has an unforgettable sweet taste, is aromatic,mild, colorful and this is what differentiates it from other pulaos and biriyanis.  I was awed by their presentation and taste that urged me to try it. Though I am not a great fan of kashmiri pulao , I loved it.

CHICKEN TIKKA LABABDAR - Tandoori chicken Tikka tossed with Indian red gravy. With an emphasis on refined yet creative Indian cuisine, the dish incorporates both traditional classic flavours. It offers you a lusciously juicy sauce at the same time.

MUTTON ROGAN JOSH - Mutton rogan josh is a robust spicy aromatic lamb curry of Persian origin which is an integral part of Kashmiri cuisine. Well what an outstanding dish never eaten anything with so much flavour it's like an explosive of taste in your mouth ! It is scrumptious delicacy from the Kashmiri cuisine distinguished by its thick, aromatic, flavourful red sauce and tender meat.

KADAI CHICKEN  - Chicken is cooked in a red gravy with whole spices . It‚Äôs a popular north Indian dish that‚Äôs made with a few freshly ground whole spices and is known for it‚Äôs incredible flavor. This dish was more of a drier curry where the spices really cling onto the chicken and I loved it. Use of fresh chicken resulted into best of flavors.

LACHHA PARATHA - Lachha Paratha is a popular paratha recipe made from Whole wheat flour. A multilayered shallow fried North Indian flat bread is an epitome of cooking art which tells us how we can make a finest preparation out of nothing. These flaky Parathas were perfect  in its own dimension. Once I started eating this paratha it melt in my mouth and felt that the layers are coming off one by another.

Well what can I say, the food and service exceeded all my expectations. 

¬†

Special thanks to:

‚óã ¬†Milli Norman , Public Relations Officer, Urban Feast ‚Äì For hosting us so nicely and extending the warm hospitality.

‚óã Team of E Kitchen ‚Äì It includes Chefs and Staffs who served us patiently and help us with the overall experience.

Dabbawallas in Kolkata @ E-Kitchen by Urban Feast, New Town..!

Mumbai has got its dabbawallas to deliver steamy food to the workplace for ages, why would Kolkata lag behind? The City of joy is slowly warming up to the idea.

You have it all ready and served hot, freshly prepared food delivered at your desks.It is on the lines of the smart city concept in which one could order by WhatsApp or a mobile application and they would deliver home-made food right at your step.

Food quality is awesome and the quantity is always sufficient for two. I just have one problem, while ordering via zomato why are you charging a service tax when you are charging a delivery charge already...? Home delivery is the only service I am availing so why should I pay an extra service charge when I am paying a delivery charge..?

I cannot rate this restaurant with home delivery service in the New Town area more than 3 stars. The food was very oily, practically swimming in oil. However the quantity was quite good. We ordered

Bengali Moong Daal: This was too oily for Daal, don't like it that much. 
Mixed veg: Again too oily and the vegetables were not fresh
Chicken Daak Bunglow: I had to spoon out the extra oil swimming on top before I could even see the chicken inside. This tasted nothing like bengali preparation, but was more like Chicken do piaza. 

Their packaging is very neat. However food quality needs to improve a lot!

I am a food lover but hate to try new restaurants.¬†
I Visited Techno India College today in Rajarhat . Sad to say that no eateries available there except street food. Heard a new restaurant has opened nearby. "Try karti hu" was my 1st reaction. I am so glad I took the chance and ordered a delivery of Cholar Dal and roti. I even got crispy Aloo bhaja with it :9
The food was yummy and reminded me of my Moms cooking back in asansol.
A must visit for all youngsters who miss their mom. <3
Would have given 5 stars but cholar dal had coconut :"(
Anyways , it was still very tasty.

The food quality was poor. And the rice and chicken was terrible. The chicken was burnt and the rice had a funny smell to it. I am never ordering from this place again.

Just ordered a Chicken briyani from here.
Overall experience....
1. They delivery was late
2. The food was cold and smelling, not fresh
3. The packing was pathetic

Its better to eat near road side than from here. The taste is very bad and its an random combination of materials....
Quite Pathetic

Ordered chanar dalna and roti on sunday afternoon.Usually restaurants give 1 hr estimate and deliver around 45 min mark.E kitchen gave an estimate  of 1 and 1/2 hrs.The food was delivered 2 hrs later exceeding their estimate and wasn't hot anymore.The food taste was OK(neither good nor bad).I don't know if this happened with me only or anybody else but if you are feeling super hungry then order at your risk from this restaurant.

I have to say I was impressed by the food quality. The hunnan chicken and Hakka noodles were very good. I also tried their schezwan fish, it was also pretty good. The service is really good, I liked it very much. Keep up the good work.

Well, this one seems like a pretty newbie in the micro city of Kolkata ‚Äì Rajarhat. And I am glad that they provide office delivery also.

Ordered their Veg Biryani along with a cold drink for doorstep delivery ‚Äì not too many outlets sell a Veg Biryani ‚Äì but they do! They did delay somewhat in delivering, but that can be ignored.

Coming to the food, it was parcelled in a rather lean plastic container, but the biryani looked nice through the transparent cover. However, the Biryani preparation did miss it‚Äôs mark by quite some distance ‚Äì specially, if there is too much of too huge pieces of carrot in it. There were some other veggies also which enriched the taste ‚Äì like phool gobhi, some potatoes, capsicum etc, but all the good work was neutralized due to overuse of carrots.

Some complimentary salads were also served ‚Äì we can‚Äôt ask for anymore in a product with a price tag of Rs. 80/-. Oil content could definitely have been regulated.

They do charge a few extra for packing and delivery, both of which are justified.

Since they are pretty new, several hiccups are anticipated ‚Äì no regrets. Hope they will address their shortcomings in a timely manner!
