My personal favorite.... Being a student of a college nearby, was a regular visitor... It's Puri and chana daal are all time in demand n if u go during lunch u vl also get aludum... Its samosa in d evening with lengcha or kala jaam or jolbhara or patti sapta or Gur sandesh spcly in winter r delicious n yummy... All d students of Kolkata had to visit college Street for something or the other n they must try here... It's food is light n not oily, well maintained, cleanliness is taken care of, one of the oldest shop n moreover pure vegetarian.. It vl hardly pinch you 40 to 50 with stomach full items... Every1 should definitely try here whenever possible...

Putiram, a gastronomic heritage at College Street, is standing tall and proud for decades, in the face of stiff competition from contemporary fast food/ sweetmeat shops. If you love Bengali-style fast-food or even have the slightest curiosity about how Bengali sweet and fried foods taste like, you need to visit Putiram to sample their unforgettable kachoris with chholar daal (lentils with spices and coconut) and feel a piece of heaven inside your mouth. 

The kachoris are small in size here, but the hing flavor is mesmerizing. These guys make a proper hing kachori in the bengali styled kachori segment in Calcutta. 

And the chholar daal is as usual mesmerizing.

An iconic eatery in kolkata. College street is almost synonymous with this place. Here you can have an awesome gastronomic experience in as much as rs-10/-, the minimum price for a "mishti". The radhaballavi with chholar dal combo is a must must try. I have tasted almost all the varieties of sweets available here. It is a must visit if you are in college street.

It's a sin if you haven't tasted their Mishti Doi for at least once while strolling through the lanes of College Street. The other sweet variants are good as well. Do not miss out the Nalen Gurer mishti on chilly winter days.

I was a student of city college of commerce I mean the just beside of Putiram sweet shop. So, I was almost regular visitor of that shop. Radhaballavi with cholar dal(chana dal), amazing. Jalbhara-talshash is awesome. Yesterday I went there for evening breakfast. As usual taste was great of radhaballavi. But size of that is bit small & bit oily.

Its a very small place and doesn't have the glamour of big restaurant. But trust me, its a legendary eatery in Kolkata. If you are in Kolkata but never tried the sweets and savouries of Putiram, you are seriously missing something. Do try their kachuri and chholar daal. Just out of the world. 4 pc kochuri with a bowl of chholar dal just for 28 bucks. Sweets are to definitely try for. Don't miss the samosa or the quintessential bengali Singara. They make it royal. With winter approaching, it contains the stuffing of cauliflower, peanuts and potato.

Putiram, one of the best sweet shop in Kolkata has created a lot of buzz and is quite popular to its customers. The kochuri , and Dal is a quintessential  thing to have and to add some variation they have alur dom...  Which is charged separately.... the stumptouous sweets which you can try after eating the kochuri are rosogolla, various types of sandesh, pantua , guti payesh etc etc . Located at Surya sen street, this outlet has sitting arrangement unlike the Sealdah outlet. So if you r tired after doing classes or roaming around the streets of College Street , then definitely Putiram's kochuri is the best to shred that tiredness. 

Well I believe the quality has degraded a bit and they are charging a bit extra but at times when you r hungry all these things don't matter except food. 

Have a good time. Happy eating folks.

This famous sweetmeatshop is located at suryasen street,near to collegestreet area!
We ordered kochuri alurdom....which costs 17rs..
They served 2pieces kochuri ,alur dom along with cholar daal!Everything was fine to taste! But 2pirces alurdom ,size wise wasn't enough! They were too small to declare it as sufficient!! But the quality was good!! The cholar dal was so-so but the kochuri was yum...and alurdom also! Will visit again!
A FIRM REQUEST TO THE MANAGEMENT... PLEASE DONT COMPROMISE THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY FOR THE SAKE OF REPUTATION!

Putiram opposite of college sqaure. Simply the best in town. There shouldn't be any doubt about that. A piece cost 7 rupees, and that is totally justifiably the filling of the Kochuri. After 8.30 or 9 am, you won't get any Jilabi. Singara is also famous of them.

Must visit place..

Want to try the best chonnar dal in Kolkata? Head to Putiram. Was craving for a good Bangla breakfast on my first day on Kolkata. A friend suggested Putiram and we landed there.Had scrumptious kochuris with chonnar dal and aloo.Since a Bengali breakfast is incomplete without mishti had the jholborra which was delicious. Packed  and brought back some ice cream sandesh and rosogulla which were really good.If you don't like hole in the wall places or want upscale restaurants  please avoid  cos this is a place where you go door food not ambience.

The first time that I was introduced to this fascinating sweet shop was way back in 1999. As a grad student of Presidency, this was our favorite place for a quick evening snacks or even lunch at times. Located in College Street area, near College Square, this happens to be a favorite joint for students of both Calcutta Medical College and Presidency University.

You really don't see people sitting and chatting here. They enter, place order, eat, pay and leave. Because this place is always over crowded. Sometimes it's difficult to even find a place to stand and eat on the pavement near the shop. One of the favorable factors aspect of this place is that they open very early. One can savor the delicious items even at 7am

Kachori and cholar (chana) dal are the showstoppers and must have items. All the namkeen items like radhaballabi and aloo torkari, singara are awesome. Their sweets are fab as well, specially the rosogolla and ice cream sandesh.

Ambience is just decent. 

Service is very prompt. And that's what keeps the momentum of this place going. 

Pricing is still moderate and affordable. The range of sweets for just ten rupees will leave one floored. Kachori is still priced at six rupees per piece. 

In a nutshell, my rating for the outlet is 

Ambience - 3.5
Food - 5 
Service - 4
Pricing - 5

Overall - 4.4

As I savor the Kachori, dal and Sandesh while writing the review, I would say this is a must visit place for anyone wanting to taste bengali sweets and namkeens or nontas,as we prefer to name them.

I have visited this place innumerable times and every time i have loved it a bit more than my previous visit.

Kochuri and aloor dum with cholar daal really touches your heart and soul. And the mishti. Well, what can i say about them!!!! Marvellous. 
(My recommendation: do have their rajbhog and ice cream sandesh)

Putiram opens as early as 6:30 a.m. in the morning. Make sure to add this to your list if you haven't already.

The Radhaballavi was served to us with a potato curry. Fabulous !! It was indeed one of the best radhaballavis we had eaten till date. Next coming to the RASMALAI, I felt there was nothing special about it.Very ordinary in taste. Still I would recommend this place for their Radhaballavis.

This is a typically quintessential old North Kolkata shop specialising in traditional sweets and savoury items. It is located near College Square and being so close to Cal University and colleges like Presidency as well as the College Street Boi para is a a favourite haunt of many frequenting these places. It is an old shop and retains its spirit, there is nothing much by way of ambience and there are just a couple of rickety wooden chairs and tables for seating inside. Most prefer to eat standing out on the pavement or takeaway. We had the kochuri with cholar dal and it was just too good. The kochuri was perfect...soft and tasty and the cholar dal, though a bit watery was sweet and tasty and perfectly complemented the kochuri. Together with these we also had lyancha and chanar jilepi. Both were excellent.They have many other sweets and inside the shop there was a poster about their icecream Sandesh...seems popular but we didn't try it....maybe on another visit.... Hopefully...for I don't really frequent this part of Kolkata!!

It's an antique sweet shop of kalkata.They have maintained the purity of the cuisine and so in these days of garnishing and use of artificial flavours they have been able to preserve the traditionality which takes us back to ancient calcutta.
We ordered radhaballavi with cholar dal,samosa,rabri,gulabjamun.and packed langcha, rosogolla,sandesh.
The radhaballavi here is very unique.coz it's made of gota moog dal but soft enough to melt in the mouth.
Dipped in choler dal the taste of radhaballavi is all pervading.
Samosa was good.bt size was small compared to price.
Rabri was just awesome. 
Gulabjamun was so juicy.
Rosogolla was just awesome and visit to Putiram is totally incomplete without this.
Langcha was so so.
Sandesh was ok. 

And last but not the list the warm hospitality of the owner/manager.

Another legendary sweet shop of college Street, Putiram never fails to satiate my craving for luchi and cholar dal. This was my second visit after 3 years and since I was in the area I figured I'd try them out again. Last time I came it was pretty crowded, this time ....not so much. I ordered their "luchi and cholar dal" which was light and good to eat. Following which I had their "ice cream sandesh" . Now I must say that I'm not a fan of sandesh but their ice cream sandesh is pretty nice and refreshing to eat if I might add. I never thought I'd say that a sandesh was refreshing .....but it's true for this one. The sandesh is very cold when it's served , not overly sweet and very very soft. Highly recommended place for a pit stop to satiate the hungry stomach when you're shopping for books in College Street .

Putiram has lived upto carrying its legacy of serving you the finest,and mouth watering kachuri of seven rupees each with an awesome dal. They serve you with their excellent alur torkari for an extra 6 bucks. The seating capacity is very very limited. So, takeaway is the best possible option here.

Today me and my friend came here around 3:30pm. One plate radhaballavi and two langcha we ordered. Both are good tasted. Radhaballavi came with chholar dal and if you order alur dom they will charge only 5rs extra. One plate contains four pcs of radhaballavi which more or less can fill your hungry stomach as a evening food.

This place is a quintessential north Kolkata eatery that offers a wide range of transitional Bengali Sweets. One must try luchi cholar dal with alur dom, these are served piping hot and the kachoris have a nice filling inside it. The cholar Dal has a homely taste. They also serve other savory items like dhokla, singara which are equally tasty and good. Finish of your savoury meal with jolbhora sounded.

Located in the Surya Sen Street beside College Street area, it is among the good sweet shops present in kolkata; Their mihidanas, laddos, darbesh, rasmalai,etc all are top notch. The khasta kachori(s) are evenly priced and of good quality. But what separates these mouth watering delicacies are their ICE CREAM SANDESH; Priced at Rs 10/20, these are simply WOW! Its taste is mix of "chana" and vanilla ice cream; There is indoor sitting too; Quality of sweets great. Keep up the good work !!!

If you intend to munch on some light snacks and indulge in some sweets, while you are on your hunt for books on college street,Putiram is definitely the place to visit. Its a small shop serving a variety of sweets and savour items as well. I would recommend you to try the radhballobi and the langa for sure. Its nice and light for your tummy as well as your pocket.

A very famous sweet shop in college street... easy to locate .....its near college square.......had rabri ,dhokla and rajbhog......all the items tasted good , there was nothing extraordinary in their taste....but it is a good place to satisfy ur sweet cravings..... coming to the interior nothing special like other sweet shops of north Kolkata there are few seats available for the customers to sit and have their food so when the shop gets bit crowded it becomes difficult to find any seat.......earliar had tried their kachori alur dom its very good.....

It is very old and famous shop at college street area. It is very favourite place for college student. I think hinger  kochuri and cholar dal is best of kolkata,moreover misti doi, gulab jamun, rabri is so tasty. But seating capacity is small.

Best kochuri in town and you should not miss out on their sweets either. 
Please be warned that they don't have seating area anymore. There are some tables where you can stand and eat.

Being a Presidencian, I have frequented this place. I love their Kochuris and Cholar dal. Although the Cholar Dal is slightly on the sweeter side, I like it. Also you can have Aloo dum along with Kochuris. The prices are absolutely reasonable and the sweets are also okay. If you visit College Street then after bargaining with the booksellers you can drop in here for a quick bite.

I've visited this place twice...this is one of the oldest and most famous sweet shops in Kolkata... I've tried the kachuri which is decent and a varieties of sweets like rashogolla,gulab jamun,kalakand,rashomalai and talsansh...well the rashomalai here is something I'd die for...the others are also really very good...though I don't like rashogolla much but the rashogolla here has a different taste which I like and the gulab jamun has a special kind of fillings in it...which is very tasty...They have a small seating area but clean and of course budget friendly.

I just love their kochuri! Since this place is located just beside the place where I go for tuition, I have been to this place innumerable times! Their kochuri with cholar daal is to die for. I can have it all the time without getting bored. You wont feel the oil on the kochuri and its so soft! It goes perfectly well with a sweeter cholar daal(many may not like cholar daal on the sweeter side, but I love it!). 
Their sweets are delicious too. All the items are always fresh.

P.S. Please do try the kochuri with cholar daal and not with alur dom. Its way better! Promise.

Located in College Street, this outlet is very famous due to the convenient location & it's been running so many years. 😊

Ambience - This Place has less seating arrangements, so it gets congested at times. It would surely give you a typical North Kolkata feeling. Generally, it is crowded mostly since people visit for breakfast. Or just having some lil stuffs. So you'll always find hustle and bustle there. 

Food - Had Puri and Daal along with aloo dum.. With Puri, the daal is complimentary but Aloo Dum is separately charged. Good to taste and doesn't burn your pocket.

Service - Quick. 

Overall, it's a must try since it's so famous for sweets and kachori. 😍

This place has a charm of it's own. This place is famous for their kachuri. I have eaten their kachuri along with dal and a few times with alu sabzi. Their kachuri is very well made.  It does feel too oily and the sabzi as well as dal are equally good. Even the langcha is very tasty.

I went to this place to try their famous kachoris and chholar dal. As expected the taste was delicious and mouth watering. The quantity is little less when you compare this with other places in Kolkata. They serve only two kachoris per plate which is actually less and also they should have to increase the quantity of the chholar dal. However, they can increase the price keeping an eye on the benchmark. I will recommend all the kachori lovers to try their kachoris.

For a hot summer noon , when you are hungry but don't  want to stuff yourself too much,  this place is an ideal  selection. Though  kochuri  is the boast of this place, it is available  only during the early hours of morning. Since we had to pick up alternatives we chose radhaballavi and dhokla and both were quite good.

I like both the kochuri-dal, and radhaballavi-alur dum. So do I like the varieties of nolen gur sandesh. But, for me the win-win is their rich and creamy yoghurt. Ambience is good.
P.S.- those who prefer fried sweets variety might like their lyangcha.

Final one on the College Street visit today, we had an elaborate layout of sweets starting from knacha golla to a couple of gurer sandesh. This city truly caters to my love for sweets. The sandesh was heavenly and I loved the fact it came in variety of shapes and sizes. Also, the pot shaped one had liquid gur filling. Very popular one in this area, I am glad that I finally got an opportunity to visit and that too during the right time of the year, when you get gurer mishti!! If possible, I would love to take a box for my friends back in Mumbai.

Each and every North Calcuttan is fond of this place. This is mainly famous for Kachuriand Cholar dal and ofcourse it is delcious. The demand is so high that Kachuri is available only till 9 am. Radhaballavi is also great. Coming to their sweets Ice Cream Sandesh is mouth watering. Nothing with their ambience just go for their food. Seating arrangement is good. Price is cheap.

Still they nurture the Calcutta tradition. An age old shop, of which I have heard from my early childhood. The radhaballavis and oh the kachuris. My 65+ father remember it as fondly as I do. The visit is special every time. 

After a very long gap, at least well after my graduation today I visited the shop for the first time. Brought home a bag of nostalgia. Loving every bit of it.

Medical college student and putiram is like Romio and Juliet. One is incomplete without the other. 
Be it the hot kachuris with dal or be it the smacky 'singara's, be it the wonderful gulab jamuns or be it the oh-so-solacing mishti doi...
This place is just good enough not to miss !! 
Putiram will be the name etched out in my college life forever.

This outlet of Putiram goes by the name "Putiram" and the other outlet by the name "Putiram Sweets" which is located on MG Road Amherst Street crossing. This is generally said to be a secondary outlet while the other the primary one.

While I will be penning down the review, you will find me comparing between the two and this is how I feel it can be best explained. And, since I am writing review for this restaurant at first, the review for the primary one might feel like being copied, which is not  true. I have typed the whole review, both of them, with my very own hands.

This outlet has a sitting area which is seen to be preoccupied most of the time, while the other outlet is devoid of such pleasure. I have had the honor of having food both seated as well as non-seated. I typically remember tasting singhara, sweets of many kinds and the puri-dal shown in the cover picture for the outlet.

When you opt to have the puri-dal, it is meant to be self served initially and then they serve you when required extra, but, there are times when you will be ignored of this hospitality at the time of heavy pressure of customers. This quick snack is tasty and the dal they serve is quiet well but not the best.

The singharas here are tasty but less than the other one; and same is the issue with the sweets. They taste good but the other outlet's sweet seems better. However, the hospitality from the staff of this outlet is way better than the other, thus gaining points more than the other.

A visit is recommended!

Famous for the sweet and amazing kachori and cholar dal.  
The kachori are very delicous, soft and crispy.  
A plate of kachori will be fitting and filling enough.

Located just opposite to College Square on Surya Sen Street, Putiram is perhaps one of the most famous sweet shop of Kolkata. The legendary breakfast of Putiram: kochuri with chholar daal is a criterion to judge if a person is truly a Kolkatian (a made up word to describe people of Kolkata). The kachuris are really amazing, and the cholar daal is mindblowing. The morning hours are really busy, especially the weekends. But I recommend everyone to just eschew the crowd factor and enjoy the brilliant breakfast at Putiram Sweets. Their Jol Bhora Sandesh are must try!!

Sweets stores are the lifeline of Kolkata. At every now and then walking in the streets we encounter them here and there. Putiram is one of the finest of all. Located in Surya Sen Street Putiram has the best quality sweets in this area. Each of their sweets are worth eating. Come and try their Lancha or Rosogolla you will fall in love with the place.
They also make good Kochuri all through the day.
Excellent place.

Authentic as it gets. Amazing radhaballavi which is just the perfect taste to the days start. Then the rosagullas are bloody brilliant. Then the sondesh is epic too. You cannot find another place that serves such epic food for such amazing prices. Each rosagulla is 6 bucks, a brown rosagulla (sorry I don't know what this is called) is ten bucks and each sondesh also at ten bucks. I wound up an amazing breakfast of 3 puris, 3 rosagullas and 2 pieces of sondesh for an amazing price of 66 bucks. One of the hidden gems and legendary places to visit. To hell with the much famed sweet shops, this is where you should be to live the authenticity.

কলকাতা ছেড়েছি বছর চারেকের ওপর হয়ে গেল। গতবছর গেছিলাম আবার, ঘুরতে ঘুরতে। দোকানটা বেসিক্যালি বদলায় নি একটুও। পরিবর্তনের রঙ লেগেছে অনেক আগেই, কিন্তু আমার আরো একটু কম বয়সের কলেজ স্ট্রিট আর সূর্য সেন স্ট্রিটের চেহারা প্রায় একই রকম আছে। এখনো সেখানে একই রকম ভাবে সন্ধ্যে নামে, আর রাধাবল্লভীগুলো একই রেটে গরম কড়া থেকে স্টিলের প্লেটে (এবং অচিরেই, পেটে) চালান যায়। দাম বেড়েছে, দশ থেকে পঁচিশ, আর পুঁটিরামের সাইনবোর্ডে নতুন রং ধরেছে, কিন্তু তার স্বাদে আর গন্ধে এখনো কোনো পরিবর্তন আসেনি। পুরোনো উত্তর কলকাতার রাস্তা দিয়ে যেতে গিয়ে যদি কখনো পেটে টান ধরে, দয়া করে একবার ঢুঁ মারবেন। "গ্রান্টি" দিচ্ছি, হতাশ হবেন না। ☺

This sweet shop is probably as old as the area itself, or so it seems. My father can well recount his days at the Presidency University, and how he and his friends would visit this place for an occasional rejuvenation. According to him, the taste of their Kachori and Chana Daal, or more popularly 'Kochuri ar Chholar Daal' haven't changed over the years. It has an absolutely unique and extremely delicious taste to it that makes you crave for more. The shop, as I said, looks old, and typical of the eateries around that place, accommodates people in long benches on either side of the table, all cluttered in as much space is available. However, the charm of the place and the cultural heritage it is a resemblance of will make you go back again and again. Also, try their sweets - especially the Roshogolla and Kalojam. They aren't the usual spongy ones that are available nowadays, but stay true to the original ones. Overall, drop in nearby just to be a part of the ancient food culture that it is a resemblance of.

পছন্দের মিষ্টির দোকানের মধ্যে একটি ছিল তবে আজকের সন্ধের পর আর বলতে পারছি না । সন্ধে বেলা কাজু বরফি আর একটি সন্দেশ খেলাম কোন তাই টাটকা নয় এবং স্বাদেও ভালো নয় ।এর আগেও একবার হয়েছিল ভেবেছিলাম একবার হতেই পারে এটা নিয়ে দু বার । তবে যে জিনিস টা এখন ভালো লাগে সেটা মিষ্টি দই । চোখ বুজে এখন সেরা দের মধ্যে একটি ।

Putiram is famous for its "kochuri and cholar dal". It's a small sweet shop selling sweets for many years. People know this shop as a mark of college Street. Sweets are the weakness of Bengalis so the same happens to me. I have a love for sweets. 'Rosogolla' ( say it like Bengali) is my favourite. Sweets here are tasty enough to make you feel good. Humble on your toung, gentle to your pocket.

Nostalgia... the feeling that crepes in me when I go down the lanes of north kolkata... And obviously, Putiram is among the memories of the good, old north! 
Well, as it's famous for the radhaballavi and cholar dal.. we ordered that... It was to be honest average.. dal was perfect though... I always like the sweet taste in dal...
Then, we had Sarbhaja and Darbesh... Darbesh was again average.. but the sarbhaja was great.. I could literally identify the layers!! 
To me, a good place to calm your hunger temporarily!!

Putiram sweets needs no introduction. Though we have tried their sweets numerous times, their radhaballavi and aloodum are very good and less oily as well. Their rabri, Gulab jamun and mihidana also tastes great. This heritage place have adopted quite well with the changing generation of customers, which is quite obvious from the huge footfall.

Been here on Deepavali morning for breakfast i.e. 30/10/16

The best thing is.. although this is a heritage sweet shop.. with old decors, but they have maintained cleanliness with wooden chairs n marble tables..
N the 2 nd best thing is customers have to self-help to take the food from the employees to their own tables.

I had kochuri n sabzi.
Unlike most other shops, the sabzi was thick n not with loads of thin gravy...
Price seemed to b on a bit higher side.

Putiram is one of the old school sweet shops in Kolkata that has found its place in the history of the city. The kachori and chholar dal is their USP with hot kachoris being brought in fresh from the flame every few minutes. The phrase "selling like hot kachoris" could have been defined here. The kachori is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and the chholar dal is absolutely heavenly-a little sweet, exactly like home. You can also take alur dam with the kachori at an additional price. The alur dam is also good, albeit slightly spicy. Their sweets are pretty good too, but you should go there simply for the kachori.

One of the vintage eating places in and around college street, Putiram is located on Surya Sen Street opposite College Square.

With my college being on College Street, I have tasted many of their items from time to time. Prices may be costly, but the taste justifies it. Their kachuri and cholar dal is awesome, with fresh hot kachuris coming in from time to time. Sweets are also of good quality.

There is also a seating arrangement inside with about 6 tables. Self service is applicable, that is, you have to pay and take foods from the counter to your seat. The environment inside is also good to take a short break from other works.

A must try for anyone visiting College Street.

A very old, nice bengali sweet shop with an array of sweets, soft rasogollas  and tasty radhaballavis - puris stuffed with pea and spices. It is a shop from my grandparents time. It is also a shop where non bengalis, especially from the north east, flock to eat sweets.

Then there is lovely sweet. Any Bengali tummy is not full without bangali misti and I serves great misti

One of the nostalgic places of Kolkata Putiram sweets won't let you down if you want to have some of the sweets or snacks. They offered radhaballavi which was less radhaballavi more plain Puri but it tasted good. (Though per pc cost 7/- is l'll bit more compared to the quality) I also tried their kaalojaam, aata sandesh, pink sandesh, Mishti doi etc. Price of sweet is just right. Seating arrangement is also available but they should improve the interior.

Located at surya Sen Street,just opposite to college square. Sweets are really tasty and very cheap. I find their sandesh to be tastier than rosh er misti. Their Darbesh is also very good.
Besides they serve yummy kachuri and cholar dal at Rs.20/- per plate( Four kachuris and cholar dal as much as you need).

I am a regular visitor to this place when I am around College Street and Calcutta University. The shop is historical and has rich heritage. 
The Kachuri and Dal ( 4 Kachuris and Dal) at ₹ 20 is very tasty. One should have it. The dal is specifically superb. 

The quality and the price of the sweets are very good and reasonable respectively. The Sandesh , Lengcha, sarbhaja , saree naroo are very good .

Putiram is the finest sweets store in College Street. They have excellent quality sweets and also a huge collection of sweets. Whenever I pass from there I try the Lancha they make, and it always brings water to my mouth. And the Kaju Borfi is another of my favourite.
Putiram also have a decent seating arrangement just behind the counter. But they don't serve to your table. You have to pay and pick up the food by your own.
They also masters in Kachuri, which is another very popular dish ordered by people.
Yes, do visit this place if you are a sweet lover, and still visit if are not, just because they produce really good sweets.

Fantastic Kachori and chollar Daal.
The chollar daal has the right amount of sweetness because of the coconut.
The Rasogolla and gulab jamun are also fantastic.
Place remains crowded most of the time but service is very fast and you don't have to pay extra for more chollar daal if you need.
The tables and benches give a nostalgic North Calcutta feel to it.

Replete with old Kolkata appeals and rustic small town sweet shop auras, this one can both titillate and repulse your taste buds. If you're a polished-indoors person, you might not fall for this place. But eat here once and you'll know what most of North Kolkata and other suburbia taste of. Yes you might complain of unhealthy oils cooking their kachoris or not-so-spick shelves bearing the array of sweets or maybe even not compliant servers. However the humble appearance and the interiors from another era don't fail to arouse our history-stricken nerves. It has undoubtedly served great pioneers of Kolkata yesteryears from all spheres. Even if you don't love the food, go for the old world feels!

Standing and eating on marble top tables with photos of Putiram Modak's shop from hundred year old Calcutta adorning the walls behind is quite another experience - of one soaked in history, and sheer transience of a food culture that's so rare these days. Make sure you soak it enough and dunk your food experience in it amply !

The crisp and fluffy kachoris were the best I had in a while, served with a more average teekha also sabji. I craved for the much famed radhaballobi and cholar dal which sadly it turns out is served post 10.30 am. 

Baba and I had also had rasogollas which are old school suji ones without spongy feeling, and ras malai - both of which were pretty decent.

One thing to inform all that "Seating  is  Available" at "Putiram"....there was wrong info in Zomato.

And also the Bengali style singara (not samosa). If you are around the College Street area do visit for the above two and then some sweets of  your choice.

Their sweets are just as good. Yes some of them are not up to the mark as others but most of them just set the standards for other sweet shops. Sandesh with mango jelly, strawberry sandesh, rajbhog, all these I am having right now and I am loving these very very much. I'll keep visiting this place :P

This happens to be my locality because its my mom's maiden house .So any kind of sweets that we bring in is from here. If it is Sunday,its must that the breakfast would be Putiram's radhaballavi.
The sweets r made in perfection and so is the Radhaballavi. The staffs are very well behaved. I recently had their rabdi and its like butter melting in your tongue.
Very reasonable priced n tastiest sweets are found here.

A bit on the sweeter side the Daal has a special aroma which can only describe after having it and after cherishing it! And yes, apart from the quintessential combo sweets are also there to pair with!

So many Sunday breakfasts have been eaten here or packed and taken home. I have been eating here since childhood, the owners know us very well and still gives us free ice cream on special occasions. :) Priced at Rs 5 per piece of Radhavalabhi with their chholar dal , one cannot stop at 4 pieces. The piping hot samosa with the sweet chutney is another must try. They have added dhokla in their menu recently and Rs 10  for 2 pieces is dirt cheap. The rosogullahs are soft and big in size and the best thing is they are sold out every day so nothing is repeated the next day and you get fresh food daily. It is a self service place.

Apart from the popular sweetmeat on offer the mishit doi from this place too is nice.

Decided to reward myself with some gastronomical incentives in the form of radhaballavi (dalpoori) and aloo sabjee infused with heeng, & kala jamuns (sweet meat, a close cousin of the gulab jamun which in Bengal is known by the name ladygenny a corruption of Lady Canning, the wife of the British viceroy, after whom it was named when first invented).

The place is dinghy. One had to go there to savor the nostalgia. The management however don't have happy faces (as if theirs are the only lives burdened with god known what!) The servers are swift but unwilling to be drawn into a conversation even when there's no rush.

 But a must amongst the heritage eateries.

This is one of Kolkata's heritage. From time immemorial college street hoppers have visited Putiram for their delicious kochuri,singara and misti. Their kochuris are light and comes with a bowl of chaolar dal. Most places is kolkata do not make it like this anymore. With the charm of old kolkata and the delectable food, Putiram will surely win your heart. Must try: kochuri, bonde,singara.

Kachuri and dal, that's what comes to my mind whenever I think or hear about this place. Really really delicious. Definitely not a place of visit for a figure conscious or people on strict diet. But in this ever decreasing calorie intake world, few of those who may have they privilege, visit around 5pm in the evening and start munching - bet you will luv it. 
Rosomalai and sor bhaja complement the kachuri. And if you are in for, then definitely take the 100gm misti dahi for a ride (not the best, but will do the trick) 
Happy munching 😉

P. S. Deducted ratings because of uncleanliness and their staff (bangla moshai's waiting to greet you)

This place in central Calcutta is very famous for its radhapallobi and cholar dal. Some might find it overrated though because there are quite a few places providing the same quality. If you are at college street do drop in. It is worth a visit.

The kochuri chholar dal you get here is second to none! I also love the shada mishti doi here. 
If you are college street regular, you got to have had something here at some point of time! One of the timeless mishtir dokans of this city. 
Their 'self service' feature perhaps adds another whiff of charm to this old Calcutta treasure cove that is Putiram.

Located in college street this place is not at all difficult to find. The place is not very big and has around 5 tables overall. One thing you must try here is the kochuri and dal. This is something i never miss out whenever i visit this place. the sweets are also pretty good,worth trying.

It's a very famous eatery in college Street area. Radhaballavi and chholar dal are the signature food here. Fresh and crisp radhaballavi with tasty lentil filling is served with chholar dal which is slightly watery, a bit sweetish and flavourful. The combination is delicious. 
Ambience is typical Bengali sweet shop. Service is self service. Price is pocket friendly.
They also have variety of sweets and their quality is okay.

I have a crush for sweets and this place just beside the college square pond would be my list of top five best sweet shops in Kolkata. I have been suggested about Putiraam from a sweet lover friend so I walked in one afternoon. And surprisingly I was blown away by the taste of the kachori/radhavallavi. It was solid, and had that pure authentic flavor (unlike the cheap street side puri fried in mixed oil). Also the channa dal served with it was very good and tasted like home. The gulab jamun and rashgolla were pretty big in size, hot and good. The sweetness is very high and intense. Those who prefer it less sweet may not like those. Another good item was the samosa.
It is basically a self service place and sitting area is small. So a good place for those looking for a quick bite, because during the rush hours you won't get much time to eat and chat. Also you have to pay first so keep your wallet ready while ordering.
I visit here every time I go to college street and I would recommend every one to visit if you are around.

'Putiram' the name itself suggests the heritage tag attached with it. If you are in Colg Street and you haven't their their kochuri and cholar dal then buddy, you've missed a huge thing in your life. Yes that's the aura of this place, the yummy kochuri and cholar dal will make you realize that even something simple like this can be so tastier than a burger or french fries.
Recently had their singara, dhokla and Misti doi. Almost all the items available here are really delicious.
Since I don't like sweets much so haven't tried any of them but people with a sweet tooth might consider having a rosogolla or pantua from here. I guess 'Putiram' won't disappoint you in the sweet section as well.

Located on the Surya Sen street, this place might not have the same grandeur as one kcdas or balaram Mullick, but is no less when it comes to what they serve.  From awesome Barris to gulab jamuns to jolbhora, all r worth a mention.  Nd kachori nd Chola r daal,  they r one of the best.  They also have a certain ice cream Sandesh which is also worth a try.  
P. S there is a good Lassi shop just outside the putiram, worth a try

Putiram is famous for it's radhaballavi and chhota dal from beginning. So before buying anything from here first try there radhaballavi. It's really tasty. You also try there samosa. And there sweets were also very delicious. One of the oldest sweet shop of kolkata and still serve delicious snacks. Must visit.

Located opposite to my college, Putiram is my favourite spot to catch a quick meal. Indeed, it is sweet shop, with an amazing array of delicious sweets, ranging from gojas that are almost savoury, melt in the mouth rosogollas and gorgeous gulab jamuns with just the slightest hint of rose that is neither too subtle nor too overpowering.

But my prime attraction is their selection of savoury items. The shingara (samosas) are always piping hot, with a delicious potato fillling (peeled to perfection, no potato skins in sight) and crisp casing, served with a tart and sweet chutney that is absolutely to die for.
Even better I think are the kochuris, always crisp and fresh, with a delicious lentil filling and served with a dal which, though on the watery side and sweet and full of flavour. Some days instead of the dal they serve a spicy potato "curry" which is just as good. Add just 4 rupees and you are ladled a generous portion of spicy "alur dom" which contrasts the sweet dal amazingly well and is literally finger licking good. And if that isn't enough, the refills of the dal are free.

Service is excellent, with fresh kochuris turning up at an amazing pace. You need to serve yourself here: place your order, take your food and find yourself a seat. The value for money here is excellent. In under 40 rupees you can have a filling meal that will last you for hours. An absolute must-visit for anyone visiting the college street area.

Ideal for having breakfasts. They have a self-service seating arrangement inside. The radhaballavis are quite good with moong dal filling and a sweet chholar dal accompanies it.
They also serve a variety of sweets. I've tried their kalojam( because I'm a huge fan of this particular mishti),sorbhaja and pantua and they all taste good.
Will definitely go back for more.

I used to have my physics tuition at Surya Sen street & walk my way back till the CENTRAL metro station. Putiram fell in between that walk. We seldom missed the chance of having kochuri and chholar daal there. Needless to say those were awesome. You can get various types of kochuri in the streets of Kolkata but putiram still attracts numerous people. The reason behind it will be evident to you once you visit the place.

The first meal I had in putiram was about decade and a half ago, it was all about the quiet efficiency of a well run establishment then as it is now. You don't expect personalised service ,unless you are a regular  here. Grab a seat next to a stranger, in this case it's most likely to be a hungry Calcutta University student,  after you place your order at the counter. The cholar dal and kochuri is served hot and there is always an option of seconds and thirds when it comes to the sweet -savoury dal that is a ghoti speciality . The kochuri isn't greasy and that's saying a lot when it comes to kochuris. Another stellar combination of Putiram is bonde and doi. It's a marriage made in Bengali heaven !

Went there after a book hunting stint, and got exactly what was recommended to me. Kachori and Dal.

It was actually pretty good, I would love to come back someday again.

I have been hearing good things about their sweets too, so I plan to try those out someday too.

There is saying in bengali which when transliterated means " a known priest doesn't need a rosary"... the same is for PUTIRAM. When it comes to kochuri .. its the name you stick upon over and over again... be it with aloor torkaari or cholar dal ... it gives you the best taste always. Neither too fried nor undone..just perfectly fried kochuri.People hailing from north kolkata swear by this. You will be spoilt with choices when it comes to shondesh and other sweets. Try it if you are visiting the city for the first time and want a true essence of old north "calcutta".

One of the ancient sweet shops of central calcutta, putiram embodies a benchmark for quality. Starting from norom paak (less sweet) to kora paak, they offer almost all types of standard sweets, one can think of. Their singara/samosa is legendary so is the kachori cholaar daal. Pretty much any sweet you want to try you can. Just don't go for the postmodern kinds like chocolate sandesh etc.

Their kachuri and radhaballavi will give you true north kolkata essence. Must try place for sweet lovers!!

The cholar daal & kachori is a must have.
However they don't have any seating arrangement. Though the tables are there, you have to stand and finish your food.

I will not say that 'cholar dal and radhaballavi is a must have'. Rather I would like to concentrate on mistis.
Rosogolla and kamalabhog; two neighbours in the misti family,claim to be the finest here. Along with sorer laddu and chomchom. Once I ordered potoler morobba but could not eat the whole.😜sandesh like,kalakand,keshar,rose:demands attraction of your eyes and stomach.
Go to putiram and have misti,because radhaballavi and dal has already been over tried.😒

Putiram was always been famous for it's kochuri. I tried the same. But what I found is not very impressive. Kochuri served with chollar daal. Kochuri was not hot enough and chollar daal was lost in the water. I tried Misti doi also. But it had a raw pottery small in it.  I disappointed.

Being too young to remember the Kolkata of old, I often find some sort of peace and understanding through eateries on College Street. Putiram is a joint located near the famous Paramount. Like other sweet shops, they serve incredibly savoury 'Kochuri and Dal', with sweets on the side and Mishti Doi to top it off.

At 20 Rupees a plate (4 Kochuris and dal), Putiram makes for a heavy meal on a small budget. They don't conjure up the greatest sweets I've had, but they make incredibly tasty dal. I'd come back here everyday if I visited college street enough.

Service is friendly, and fast. Basically what you'd expect from a sweet shop. An excellent idea for a post college meal!

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made. :)

I have heard a lot about this place. But it somehow lived below the expectations. I tried the kalojaam and korapak sandesh. 
I have heard that the rosogolla of this place is one of the kolkata's finest. But when I went there I was shocked to see many dead flies in the rosogolla container. A shop which is known for its rosogollas failed to impress me. I will never eat the rosogolla of this place. And in my opinion this shop cannot be one of the finest sweet shop in the city.

Putiram is a legendary name in North Kolkata specially for its kachoris. It is located in Surya sen street near College sqaure. I find the Kachoris good no doubt but i find the Chholar dal watery. I havent tried their sweets though but I have heard they serve good misti doi. Prices are reasonable

What more can I say of Putiram, as this has always been a personal favorite. Whenever I visit College Street, this is a must visit for me since my childhood days. Be it the Kochuri, or the Radhaballabi of Putiram and of course, the sweets, I love all of them. I was pretty excited to hear that we had Putiram included in our trail organised by the Calcutta times passions club.


We were served Kochuri and Cholar Dal, and a single bite of it made me say "yumm"! But yes, one thing that everyone noticed is that the consistency of the Dal is becoming thinner day by day, yet the taste remains excellent as always.

Always crowded, self-service facility is available. Tried Cholar daal-Kochuri many a times here, always yummy! Once I tried Malpoa, Dhokla here, they are good too! A milestone in College street food buffet :)

I don't know why some people compare Putiram with Ganguram & Ghosh & why this sweet shop is so famous for? For me Putiram doesn't even come close to them. This place is just located at College Square near Zeeshan.
Coming to the sweets & snacks : There sweets are none great to mentioned or to make the shop famous for. Very average or below average sweets just like the local sweet shops but Putiram just costs little more penny. They offer Kachuri & Singara too but unfortunately these things are worst, specially the curry they offer with kachuri having no taste from any portion of the mouth. Sweets like Sorbhaja & others are too small to enjoy. Snakes are meaningless for your bugs.
The good things are that you can have a sit over there to enjoy those tasteless shits and the shop is well maintained & neat & clean to count it as a hygienic place.
Conclusion : Don't go with the publicity you will end up disappointed. Very average or below average foods that you can expect from them.

Perfect place for Kochuri and Cholar dali. It is excellent! I also had their Dhokla and it isn't good at all. But then again, Dhokla isn't what makes Putiram famous - their kochuri and dal is.

Their ice cream sandesh is particularly good.

Their items are cheap and pocket friendly. They could expand a bit. There are just four tables inside which can accommodate approximately sixteen people so it's a bit difficult to get a seat if you go there during lunch hours.

I will definitely visit this place again and I recommend it to everyone around.

Putiram er mishti is just awesome in a word. I don't mind going to college street area for this sweet and kalika r chop. Both are splendid.

Location -- just at the starting of surya sen street. If u r going from college street. To the right. Mouchak is just beside.

Ambience -- a typical kolkata style mishti r dokaan with stacks of sweets showcased in the front. Inside wooden tables and chairs. People chatting and having their share of mishti and kachori.

Sweets -- putiram serves the best sorbhajaa according to me. Prices are really pocket friendly and u just can't have one sweet and go. I packed sorbhaja for my family. And trust me they were yum. The kachoris are simply mind blowing i have heard but i m yet to try them so can't review.

I m dying to go there once and try again.

Last week on a Sunday I visited this place alongwith my family after a shopping spree in College Street for some snacks. I was told by my aunt that this was one of the best places of North Calcutta and that it has served 3 generations of her family. This age old sweets and snacks shop is famous for their Kachori, Radhaballavi, n Chholar Deal, so without wasting any time we ordered that. Each plate consisted of 3 Radhaballavis which we're small in size alongwith a bowl of Chholar Dal. The Daal tasted excellent, little sweet as expected of a chholar dal and tasted perfect. We also ordered Mishti DoI which was milk white in color and tasted great. Khirer Laddoo, Lyancha, Chitrakoot we're few things we tried at the end and all tasted good. People with a sweet tooth will enjoy eating these over here for sure. There are around 3 to 4 tables, clean enough to sit and eat. Overall a satisfactory experience.

When i go there and sit down with Gorom Gorom kochuri and cholar dal.. its just Mmmmmmmmmmmmm... 

Been visiting the place since my childhood and i loved it everytime..

It is amazing to find so many young boys and girls having sweets and popular Bengali snacks from one of the oldest sweet shops in the city. This place is evergreen and almost all the sweets taste heavenly. It was almost like a daily affair for me to go there and have Dal-Kachuri along with Chomchom and Rasgulla during my university days. I miss those days badly. Whenever I find time to go to College Street, I visit Putiram as if paying homage to my Alma Mater. Despite it is being located on Surya Sen Street, Putiram and College Street are inseparable just like me and the dal-kachuri.

Another of many heritage eateries of kolkata , this place is around 130 years old. This place is serving cheap snacks and sweets to students of College Street for over a century. I love their signature dish "cholar dal and kachuri".  Have been here many times and had my fill of sweets. Love the place because of its food and heritage feel. A must visit place if you happen to come by College street.

Yet another sweet shop which counts to the oldest ones in Kolkata. The sweet shop is very well known in the locality and attracts huge crowd. While purchasing some books in College Street, came across this place for some quick takeaway.

I took some Dal Kachoris, Boondi and Rabri from there. The Kachoris were okay but the dal was very thin and runny enough to ruin the kachori experience. Boondi was good and Rabri was as expected nice. Taste of the sweets were nothing special, mostly similar to a typical Kolkata sweet shop.

Interiors were very old and decoration was minimal. Lighting was very dim inside the shop. There were a few tables, but mostly empty. Overall not a good place to sit and eat. Service is also fairly slow and took almost 15 minutes to settle everything.

Overall, nothing much to say. Just a good old Bengali sweet shop. However nothing special or no signature sweets as such.

I have been waiting for a long time to visit the famous 'Putiram'... A well known shop which sells authentic, traditional as well as new kinds of sweets. Being a student, I have to visit College Street a lot. But, I never got the time to visit this place. So, after a tardy day at College Street, we decided to visit it. 
        
    We ordered two ice cream sandesh first. It was white in color and cubical in shape. I had it in one go. It was delicious. You can literally feel the taste of ice cream in that frozen dessert. I loved it. The sorbhajas had a pecukiar shape, so I decided to order it. The shape was peculiar but the taste was mindblowing. I am so in love with Putiram. The ambience is so-so, There are tables and chairs inside the shop. I am definitely visiting this shop again.

Located in College Street, Putiram offers the best kochuris and dal of the place, that too at reasonable prices. It almost tastes like home-made ones too! Not much hard to locate, this place offers the best sweets, samosas, in College Street. In short, a tasty relief for the vegetarians. A must-visit.
Please note: For very extra serving of dal or alur dom (which normally is needed, given that the first serving is not much), there's an extra price, but then, that's cheap too.

Being from the south I don't get much chance of trying eateries of the north. So whenever I do go to north kol I always make if a point to try the oldies.
Had read nice reviews about this place. So me n my friend ordered radhabollovi n cholar daal. 4 pieces of radhabollovi and daal at just Rs 20. Tasty would be an ubderstatement. We tried the sorbhaja n malpoa too. Both were equally good. N having a sweet tooth I was craving for rosomalai but the person at the counter said sadly " nei didi. Sesh". Same thing for ice cream sandesh. I saw ppl trying singaras but I was not quite in the mood.

Ambiance is typical north-ish. Tables are made of marbles and although this place is quite old its very hygienic. And it's a place of self service which is a thumbs up. 

 Maybe next time I visit I'll get to try more of their legendary mishtis. Hope :-)

Putiram is one of the oldest sweet shop in college street, which still can boast of its signature preparations. It has one of the best Kachori and cholar daal ( Chanaa daal). The daal is on the sweeter side. This shop is also a traditional trademark like coffee house of Bengali's. Sweets are also praiseworthy. It is a self service eatery.

If you are in College Street, Kachori (Kochuri) and Chholar Dal (Chana Dal) is must a try. The taste of the Kochuri is quite different, and you will simply love it. I have tried Chholar Dal in several places, but the Dal they prepare simply beats all. The sweet taste and the flavour will make you forget everything for a moment. Kachoris and Chholar Dal makes a great combo!!

It is one of those oldest food corners of North Kolkata which still can boast of its signature preparations. Situated in the Boi-para of Kolkata... Putiram is an ideal place for an off-the-books 😉 lunch or quick snacks. It's mainly Famous for its Kachuri-Chholar dal-Aloor dom combo...although its Misti doi, Rosomalai, Golapjamun, Sorvaja are also praiseworthy. It's a self-service eatery. Prices are manageable although not as cheap as some other roadside sweet shops. I have been a regular here for last 3-4 years and still look forward to a visit to it whenever i am at College street..

Another one of college street's ancient wonders which has stood the test (taste) of time. This shop is on surya sen street off college square and it boasts of an enviously sweet fare. The sweets are all pretty good but you should try out the Mishti doi (It is one of West Bengal's finest) and be enthralled by the serene experience of it melting in your mouth and perfusing your entire mouth and your mind with its sweetness. The other thing to try out would be the radhaballabi and dal but you have to be here early and brave a crowd before you get your hands on a plate. 

    Happily indulge your sweet tooth! Njoi!

A few blocks away from my college Presidency, this place was and is a hit with the student community, for its tasty and pocket-friendly sweets and snacks. Loved their kochuri and sweets.

I am in love with their kochuri and dal. Same love for their mishti doi. Got introduced to this place by my uncle who used to haunt this place during his college days. I took my college mates to this place. Most of them also wanted to take to an eatery where their fathers and uncles used to come during their college days. And then we found out that it turned out to be putiram where each one of us wanted to take us to!!! I hope this explains the legacy of this place. 
You also get samosas, cold drinks, ice creams, assortment of sweets.

This place converted me from a mishti-hater to mishti-lover. Specially their doi. It is a small plate of delight. What more can I say about their kachuri and daal. It already is famous and rightly so. The kachuri and daal is a little over-priced, but it's worth the money. And the taste lingers long after. Nowhere in Kolkata would you find kachuri and daal of a similar taste. The aloo dum is delicious too.

The legendary Putiram and its famed radhaballavi- cholar daal. I'm sorry to say I was quite disappointed. The radhaballavi was nothing out of ordinary and the cholar daal was bland, tasteless and watery. The shorbhaja I ordered was just like any other shorbhaja. My friend ordered shingaras which were served with chutney. I found the chutney a little too sour.
Nothing to write about the service and ambiance, really. You have to pay first and get the food from the counter yourself. The ambiance is like any other sweetmeat shop. Honestly, I did not get what the hype is about. It's filled with nostalgia, yes, but that is not enough for me to come back for a second visit.

If anybody here, is finding luchi, alurdom, cholar dal,  then putiram will just make ur tummy khush... Bong sweets specilly doi rosogolla  and gulabjamun are specially suggested. This place is just located in d boi para of Kolkata and definitely worth visit for bong breakfast and bong brunch

Its been a long long time since I have been here, but then this is one of the first places I went to in Kolkata, it being a stones throw away from Presidency College. Though featuring in Mishti mukh (sweet shop) this place is famous for its Radhaballabi and Cholar daal (Kachori and Chana daal). These piping hot breads taste just awesome. The sweets are good here as well, but I just swoon over the radhaballabi, a must have. The shop's been there for ages, and you would never find it empty. A special mention to the owner, his ever smiling face adds to the reasons to be here. I hope he still heads the day to day work at the shop.

You cant complain of ambience of a place thats a heritage. So I wont get into it. Staff is helpful and sweet. Prices are really reasonable and food is good. For bongs like me this place holds a different meaning all together. Kachoris cholar daal and nolen gur er sondesh,rasgolla. jol bhora sandesh is another speciality. I have been to this place many times.

Putiram : The best Gurer Roshogolla I've ever had!
After a long walk till Central metro with AB, the two of us were famished, so we decided to start the day with Putiraam. The ever-recommended order of Radhaballavi was decided, along with Gurer Roshogolla and Gulab Jamun. The hot radhaballavi-dal was really light, and it was the first time AB actually started to gorge upon them. I loved them.
Gulab jamuns were hot, large and brilliant. Totally worth its price.

The best of the lot was the Gurer Roshogolla. They were heavenly - the best I've tasted. I would recommend it to anyone visiting Putiram.

The little wooden chairs and tables of this place, plus its rich history add to its charm.
If you are a Calcuttan, Putiram HAS TO BE a must-visit!

Why? Simply why? Just answer me why did I end up at this place? After all the reviews on zomato and of my friends, I had decided that the next time I am in college street, before starting the book-buying-and-bargaining business,I will visit Putiram. And there we were last friday. We thought of trying 2 kachoris each, but looking at the size, we ordered 3 each with the 'oh-so-nostalgic' chholar dal and gur er rosogolla. We went around 3:30 and found a place to sit easily. And coming to the food now. It was unexpectedly bad. Nothing extraordinary. Sorry kolkatan bongs! You like this place only out of sheer nostalgia and nothing else. There is a shop selling kochuri in park street, who if had opened a shop near putiram would hav been a reason for putiram's decrease in its 'loyal' customers. I could count the pieces of dal in the chholar dal, it was so watery and tasteless.At 10 a piece, I didnt find the rosogolla something extraordinary. All in all, I was utterly disappointed with this shop and I wonder what makes the kolkatans praise this place :/

Intro : Putiram is a legendary name in sweet shops . Liked the facade...snaps attached. Typical north Kolkata sweet shop  with sitting arrangements ...wooden chairs and tables ...its different!

Food : Had their famous Kochuri and aloor torkari - I do not usually have kochuri , singara ...but this was just very good , crispy yet not very oily , clearly superior quality oil was used ....the aloor torkari was also amazing . 4/5
Service : It was clearly mentioned with glow signs - SELF SERVICE ...
Overall 4/5

I went to college street to buy some books with my friend and ended up having sweets at this joint. It is beside college square. A small joint having a variety of traditional as well as new modification of sweet dishes. This is the first time i visit this years old renowned sweet shop. We had malpoa, dorbesh and dhokla. The smell of pure ghee and less sweetness of malpoa had a perfect balance in taste.  Dorbesh is also very tasty but its size is really very small. Sweet and sour chutni of dhokla and the fluffiness of it was nice and tasty too. Price is reasonable and pocket friendly. One visit is must for this traditional,year -old sweet maker. It is like a heritage for all bengalis.

One of the legends of sweets and desserts in the city that runs on its glory. Located right beside the College Square, this place attracts a lot of students and professors everyday. I'm fond of their Kochuri-Chholar Daal, Jilipi, Rosomalai and Mishti Doi. But frankly every time I have visited this place I wanted to tell them to improve their seating arrangement and that basin at the back of the restaurant sulking in a dark corner.

The interior is neat and clean. There are a few tables where people can sit and enjoy their food. They have a self service system which becomes a joke when the place is crowded and the people at the counters are busy with other customers. The prices are quite reasonable.

Location: Near Mouchak, College Street.

This place ranks amongst the legends of Kolkata which has been functioning for like ages. It's one of the heritage shops you would ever come across. 

The ambiance here isn't much to be described, a few tables and chairs as seating arrangements towards the interior of the shop along with an angular showcase to put up sweets in the front. Just that it suffers a bit of space constraint. 

I was introduced to this outlet by one of my close friends and yes, this has become a regular lunch halt while I am in this area for work affairs.
This place is famous for its hot non-oily and fluffy Kachoris which are served along with the Chana dal which is sweet and has the right consistency. The quality of the fooding has been maintained for ages and it still tastes the same but, sometimes does suffer a lapse (and due to the lapse, the Chana dal is watery at times, but, they surely are back on toes pretty soon). 
The sweets on offer also taste good. Gur Rossogulla was tried and it was a complete melt-in-the-mouth.

About the service, it's quick and about the staff, they are courteous and polite. 

Prices are pocket friendly and wouldn't burn a hole in your wallet. 

Overall has always been a good experience. :)
- Ain't stopping to visit this place any time sooner.

During a recent visit to College street,tried out this heritage establishment after a long time.Putiram is one of the oldest Bengali sweet shops of North kolkata.It is still an absolute hit among locals and college goers and to many a visit to College street is incomplete without Putiram and of course Paramount.

They offer mainly traditional Bengali sweets and snacks like singara and dal kochuri or radhaballavi.The kochuri was served hot and it was surprisingly less oily.The dal I did not like much.It was a bit too sweet for my liking and there was more water than there was the actual lentil.Among the sweets,I sampled their gurer rosogolla and rabri.The gurer rosogolla was absolutely brilliant.The rabri though was a bit disappointing.Something like rabri can never be too bad but it was like I have had far better rabri at many other places.

The interior is quite neat and clean.There are a few tables where one can comfortably sit and have their meals.It is a self service system that they have.The prices are quite reasonable.

Overall Putiram is a renowned sweet shop which I did not find exceptional,other than the gurer rosogolla.

Whenever  I am in college street during  the  evenings , I surely visit this place for their famous KOCHURI with DAAL and TOK DOI . The kochuri is soft and non oily . The daal is thick and smooth and I always ask for it the second time . The sweets are pretty decent. After so many years of its existence , Putiram still stands tall .

This place just beside college square along a row of streetside hotels. It might be old but is quite clean and simple . I had their radheballabis since their kochuri is not available in the afternoons. They were good but really small for my satisfaction. The dal was disappointing, it wasn't bad but it wasnt anything special.
The prices are cheap and quite normal. 
Their sweets are good . The jolbhora sondesh look so good and the Gulab jamuns . .yum! The sweet prices are very reasonable .

Yum Mouchak. everyone do visit Mouchak! Mouchak is surely a 4.5 according to me!

Putiram is heritage when it comes to College Street. This place is one of the oldest "North Kolkata" Sweet shop. It is a hit amongst the college goers and the working man returning from office. The place serves the best Shingara in the evening and also the radhapallabi is mouth watering. But my favorite is the Misti Doi (sweet yogurt) which is white in colour which is something you dont get everywhere in kolkata. So do try that and enjoy a sweet experience.

Great Sweets at inexpensive rates! Do try out the Gurer Rosogolla that comes for 10 rupees and tastes absolutely heavenly ! I also tried the Kalojaam which was very good.The swarbhaja tastes great ! The Rabri is awesome. Items like Jolbhora Sandesh are also of great quality . But my favourite and the most popular item during winter remains the hot gulab jamun , the soft ball of sweet heavenly goodness that might seem a tad too sweet for those not blessed with a sweet tooth ;) I once had three sweets back to back and the man at the counter went " Eki?! Eto mishti khachho keno?!" :D

This iconic "mishtir dokan"  is more famous for the nostalgia rather than its sweets..

Who am I to review a shop which my school Bengali books have immortalized in grammar lesson sentences like "Putiramer doi kheye bahri moja"! In fact I had come to know of Vien and Putiram through Bengali books and later felt privileged to have eaten there. Yes their Mishti Doi is very good as is their lovely repertoire of sweets. Do have Putiram sweets if you are around the are. Fact is Begnali sweets are so good and good shops are so abundant that I do not recommend going to any area to specifically try a sweet shop but if I didnt follow this principle, I would definitely recommend Putiram as one of those shops where you should go and try out the sweets!

I am a pure blood bong and I take my sweets pretty much seriously, so I cannot but help but love Putiram. Tucked into the busy thoroughfare named Shurjo Sen Street, a tad off College street, this is a heritage sweet shop, flagrantly reminiscent of the old world North Calcutta Charm. When I was at the University, doing my masters, we would flock here every afternoon for snacks and sweets. With our limited pocket money, this was our daily dose of happiness. I would run for the famous 'Darbesh' which sold out after 3 PM or so. My best friend Chirag - she ofcourse wanted the just-fried oil dripping Kochuris with Chholar dal. They make one of the best roshomalai in the city, and notun gurer roshogolla (Rasgulla made out of new jaggery - a winter delicacy). Also try their khirer naru, shor bhaja, and malai chom chom. Yummy! You can stand outside and eat, also sit inside if its not too crowded. The staff is friendly and food still quite affordable. In all, a priceless experience!

Bangalis hold their mishtis close to their hearts and closer to their mouths. But not just mishtis, we also take pride in our assortment of savouries, one of the prominent among them being kochuri - cholar daal. Being a South-Kolkatan, whenever I visit the northern part of the city, I make it a point to eat at at least 3 of the old- Calcutta signature joints. This is a rule that I take very seriously indeed. So last week when I happened to visit College Street, I entered this shop. Even in the sweltering heat of a typical Kolkata-may-afternoon, the shop was full of people. There is nothing, absolutely nothing fancy about this place - some plain rickety tables and chairs, and a few angry looking men. But somehow in this age of fusion food, the very ordinary unadulterated typical Bangali snacks and sweets give you an inexplicable satisfaction. And that's exactly what I felt with each bite of the shingara, kochuri-chholar daal and misti.

Nostalgic place for the people of Kolkata, mostly for the Calcutta University fellows... Part of the Golden Rectangle of Nostalgia at College street i.e Coffee House , Paramount, Putiram and Dilkhus. Start your Breakfast by ordering Kachauri served with Aalu bhujia sabzi (with Red chillies) / Cholar Daal (Chaana Dal)  or Samosas (uses the same Aalu sabzi as stuffing). End your breakfast with Mishti Doi (Sweet curd), Jilipi (Jaalebi) and Rasogolla's / Kalojaam's / Maalpua's.

their  luchi and cholar dal is a delicacy in itself...their cholar dal is different which u get in other places it tastes awesomee and when served hot  it is like a treat to ur taste buds...their jilipi ,rosomadhuri,misti doi are out of this world...they have a different flavour to their sweets and snacks...their khasta kochuri and singara are my favourites..among the fried sweets their swarbhaja,khirer chop,malpoa are juz awesomeeeeeeeeee...omg their delicious malpoa with the layer of oil ...aaaahhhh heavenlyyyy..

i dont find any cons here...i am a lover of their sweets and would indulge myself in these delicacies whenever i visit college street ...cause" putiram "the name speaks for itself...:D

A nostalgia, more than anything to refer for this place out here at College Street, the bookworms’ paradise. Putiram, Coffee house, Paramount and Dilkhusha make a quadruple gastronomy of heritage and culture of Bengali people. Putiram, here is a small outlet that sells Sweets, Singara and Kochuri with Daal at a very nominal cost. Although, the food could not be as tasty, hygienic and worthwhile to eat but for a ride of a heritage value, you can eat here, once a while.

Putiram's and Paramount were two must visits for us during our College days. We used to go to buy our books or just meet friends who studied in the area and looked for any excuse because it was a food pilgrimage we could afford in those perpetually broke college days ! The hot luchi's with the delicious Cholar Dal or Alu Dum were heavenly and the Nimke was a personal favorite along with the Khasta Kachori. The Singharas served up in the evenings are also quite good. Among the sweets on offer my picks are the Mishti Doi and Malpua's super yummy they are. However on a recent visit when I was sad to see that what was served was not as good .... the Singhara and Khasta Kachori were a bit oily tasty and the Alu Dum though nice lacked the punch of the earlier flavor. The Malpua was over but the Mishti Doi was excellent. Hygiene is not high on their priority so visit for the taste and sheer nostalgia.

I have heard tales about this place from my mother who hailed from North Kolkata and how she used to frequent Putiram for the cholar dal and kochuri or radhaballabi r aloor dum and the sar bhaja and chitrakut and malpoa. I had to try this place. So on the Saptami of 09 I tried out this place. The dal and kochuri and since there was no malpoa early in the morning I tried the jilapi. As Poorna di has pointed out aptly the dal was far to sweet to be a dal. I thought this must be an aberration. After almost a couple of months or so I returned. This time I had the kochuri and aloor dum. The kochuri was too oily for me but the aloor dum was good especially with the shukno lonka phoron. This time I also had both the malpoa and chitrakut none of which I really liked. The same year during Pujo I had breakfast there again. They had run out of dal and I could not believe people really bought that dal, so I had to settle with the aloor dum much to my delight. The kochuri was piping hot and so was the aloor dum. I really enjoyed that meal. I was again courageous enough to try out the jilapis. Stupid mistake. That day I returned home and finally told my mother with conviction that the Putiram she spoke so highly of has ceased to exist.

Putiram - One of the old jewels of kolkata ,which has now drastically lost its craze ... Being a regular visitor to the 'boi para' of the city , i have visited there many times and have tasted many of their dishes. Radhaballavi , kachori , alur dom are still the top picks.. Among the sweets , rosogolla, malpua, mishti doi are 'must try' here.. It has very little space for seating arrangement and is filled up all the times..  I found they sometimes serve not so fresh foods.. Anyway being a shop of old Kolkata and standing with heads up for years ,this remains one of the most crowded 'mistir dokan' in that area..

Review update:7th June 2014.
Had the kochuri and aloor dum in my recent visit.One plate had several small sized kochuris that had the traditional dal paste alongwith the flour.But somehow i did not quite like it. The aloo sabzi was also too salty for me. I being a true bong prefer the old-school fluffy kochuri with the watery,sweet cholar daal.It is pure bliss as far as i am concerned.But unfortunately it was not available that day.I also had a small serving of the mishti doi.The pearl white concoction served chilled was pure bliss on a hot ,sultry day.Cheers to that.


How do you review and do justice to a place that has perhaps been frequented by almost every mishti loving household of Kolkata since ages. Okay, the first sentence was an exaggeration alright but people who know this place would know what i am trying to convey. A visit to the "boi para" and satiating one's sweet tooth by paying a visit to Putiram is a ritual among most Bengalis. Items to die for - the mishti doi- pearl white in colour very  different from the lal doi of Nabadwip available in most local sweet shops.My fellow foodies have already sung paeans about it, so will not elaborate further.Other not to be missed items are the snack items like the khasta kochuri, radhaballavi with aloor dum , cholar daal and the singaara. Though i missed having the kochuri and radhaballavi as they are sold out within no time, i recently tried their singara. It was awesome with the typical pale yellow coloured aloo and phool kopi stuffing that had a typical sweet and jhaal taste.Another hot favourite item is their langcha and people who have the nonta items usually end their meal with the langcha. Though i  must say that the list of favourites has dwindled considerably over the years at Putiram. Thus cannot recommend/comment on any of the other sweets as i have not tried out those recently.Prices are extremely pocket friendly as is the norm in this part of the city. Misthti mookh hoye jak!!!
P.S.:Review Update: At last managed to sample the kochuri and cholar dal on another visit.It was awesome.Served piping hot straight from the kitchen, it was pure bliss. Kochuri was soft and flaky while the dal had the quintessential sweet taste.The langcha as usual was very good and so was the kalakand.

For all misti lovers this is an epic shop.
Putiram is very old and famous. I heard its name from my baba who used to bring misti doi from this place. 
I tried the snacks(nonta) like nimki,singara and khasta kochuri. The rosmalai and chanar cake were also superb! but the delicacy was the notun gurer rosogolla :P yummy!!

This is one of the historic sweet kings of Kolkata and a visit to College street took me there. The man over the counter took a liking to my inquisitiveness and started giving advice. The end result was -Rajbhog, sorer er misti, norom paker 2 sandesh, misti doi, gurer rosogolla and kora paak. All of them were very good. A humble request to the owners to advertise this place more. Worth a visit anytime.

This sweetshop retains a heritage position in the boi-para of Kolkata.The tid-bits may not make you drool,and may leave you feeling that the place is over-hyped;but for the people who have fond memories with the place, Putiram will always be cherished.
The  wooden furniture has remained mostly unchanged over the years,the menu too has stood the taste of time.This being just a simple place,one should not even think of ambience or trained service while entering Putiram.
The khasta kochuri (crispy,fresh) and singara remains my top picks.My friends,however always preferred the  radhaballavis with cholar dal, we used to love the rajbhog and malai chamchams and most importantly the mishti-doi which is more along the lines of omfed (the white mishti-doi from Orissa) and not the excessively sweet reddish variety found in most Kolkata shops.
While I wont say it is a must-visit place,if you are in the locality do check it out.

It's probably the most famous sweet shop in this particular area of Kolkata...And their most famous offering is the Mishti Doi -something the whole state is famous for. While most of the other city based sweetmeat shops sell plain sour curd which is white and sweetened curd which is reddish,this place sets the difference by providing sweetened curd which is pearl white in hue. I'm not saying this is an unique feature. but in the heart of the city its hard to come across in next door sweet shops. The various types of sandesh that are available are lovely. But on the downside, the sizes are really small. Much smaller than what you would get for the same/lower price at some other sweet shop in a different part of the city. They also provide kochuri and dal for those who prefer a quick bite. They supposedly also provide the quintessential Alur dom (traditional potato curry)...but although I've been here atleast fifty times , somehow I've always missed it no matter what time of the day. Strange indeed. Overall...this place is good. But there is a certain amount of hype involved as well. Except perhaps for the mishti doi.

Ok. I will tell you why I gave Putiram 3.5/5.

Kachori + Chholar Dal = 5.5 + 1.5 = 7.0
Aaloor Dom = 4.0
Hygeine = -1
Sitting arrangement = -1.5
Service = -5.0
------------------------------------
Overall = 3.5

The Kachori and Chholar Dal (and the Aaloor Dom) are the reasons I still carry myself to this place every time I venture into the abyss of College Street...!!!! Every time... I end up on one of those miserly chairs of Putiram, totally ignoring the parameters that fetched so much negative scoring above. 

Burp!!

Yet another important place in the lives of all people who have studied in college street area. 

Its a glum looking dingy, and dirty sweet shop ... but as i have said many times... good food can take us to some places really humble and simple. The radha ballavi ( poori stuffed with a dal stuffing)  is awesome with semi sweet chhola dal. For People who like the semi sweet, non spicy samosa ( singhara) it is bliss.... 4 pm... and there is a crowd to buy those singharas... 

one of the lesser known things from here are the KORA PAK sandesh .... and MALPUAS... the malpua is not dripping in sugar syrup... just the right amount of sweetness... and they sell fast.. 

Generations have grown on this sweet shop.... its a must try in a food walk through central calcutta

Putiram is another one of those food joints in College Street that has stood the taste of time....A shop that has seen at least seen two generations of my family enjoying its sweets... It seves that a typical "Kolkatar mistir dokan" serves and even has a tidy seating arrangement for you to sit down and enjoy your food.
I will just mention two things that I personally like among its offerings.. One is its kochuri served with dal..I really like that as the kochuri is nice and crunchy on the outside, not doughy and not too oily...
The other is my favorite here- the malpua...every time I enter this place I make it a point to have the malpuas...absolutely divinie...not too sweet that you wont be able to taste anything else but just the right amount to keep you interested..the sweetness flirts with you if you know what I mean..
Thumbs up.

I've always heard about this ancient shop from my elders, how they would visit their beloved boi para or go for a whole night pandal hopping spree and relish a plate of kochuri or radhaballavi from putiram while returning home from college square. Maybe it is true that they have lost their charm, taste or quality but according to me it is still a favourite place for many. The radhaballavis are small, fresh and tasty served with a bowl of not so thick daal. Even though the malpua was not so yummy (or accompanied with a thick syrup), but it was very light. Again, I was a bit disappointed to find the shor bhaja with a hard center, which tasted like raw solidified flour. The best sweet that I'd tasted was the darbesh. It was simply delicious and given the price (of only Rs. 5!), it is totally unbelievable! One bad thing was the staff's behaviour when we were placing our orders for the food. Their doi is quite good and so are most of the seets. 
Overall, this is a very good place to fill up your hungry stomach after you're done with your book shopping. Given, the very cheap prices, I don't think there's much to complain about what they have to offer :)

Maybe, at one point of time, this used to be a favorite haunt for all college street folk, but honestly, right now, I have nothing special to say about it.  The quality has gone down ......especially as far as the daal (with kochuri) is concerned. It's sad to say that this shop is now a No-Big-Deal issue to most of us who have colleges nearby. Somethmimes, an occasional bite here is still in vogue, but truly, the charm's been lost.

Once upon a time there was a girl who loved college street and Putiraam. She would take some time off from her book-bargaining and have a plate of kochuri with chholar daal, a side of Alur dom with it, and a sar bhaja to finish off. 

In a recent visit, she went back and tried the same routine. Although the kachuri and alur dom was good, her Bangaal soul was apalled by the massive increment in sweetness that was the dal. Ick, she thought, now this has become the thing to dip one's roshogolla in, not something acceptable with kochuri.

In vain she tried telling the people her woes. They just stared at her stoically. She came back home feeling betrayed by her true love. 

Now she sniffs as she writes this review, filled with her sorrowful tale of sweetness and kochuri.

Putiram is one of the oldest sweet shops in the city, and one of College Street's icone. Sadly, like its other fabled companion, the Indian Coffee House, quality has gone for a toss.

Putiram used to be famous for the daal served with kachuris or radhaballabis. This daal is now a sugary syrup that tastes terrible. The sweets have also become very small, and there doesn't seem to be good chhana, khoa or kheer being used. The sweets with syrup is them taste insipid.

The prices are still on the low side, but, as suggested for the Coffee House, if an increase leads to better quality, then it should definitely be done. The service is all right, and since it's not strictly a dine-in restaurant, decor and ambience are not the things to look for here.
