(This is probably one of the finest place to eat in Dum Dum)
Reasonable prices, good portions, friendly staffs and a casual atmosphere. It's worth the trip.
Recommends- schezwan fried rice, chicken do pyaza, chingri malai curry, kashmiri pulao
But their kulcha and murg kaali mirch was not up to the mark.

Check it out.. You'll be glad you did!

Visited this restaurant a day back or two. The welcome by the gaurd with folded hands, saying NAMASTE impressed me,even the ambiance was good. Had Mutton Dum Biriyani, Chicken Do Pyaza - Good and the prices does justice to the food.

on the occasion of my gf's birthday she ordered two murg dum biryani¬† and 2 tandoori roti through zomato. delivery boy came just within 15 minute and he was very polite and punctual. The packaging was adequate and quantity of food was enough for 3 adult. Test was good and not oily though I had better. But what I felt is tandoori roti was not up to the mark and little small in size and volume. overall happy with service, quantity and taste. will visit the restaurant self.

One of my school friends, who I met after a long 6years, introduced me to this place. As soon as I entered I fell in love with this place. They greeted us with folded hands(NAMASKAR). The ambiance z good. The seats on the first floor just beside the glass wall r really good. U can have a look to the flowing road below. Music played in low volume makes the environment more attractive! Staffs r very well mannered n helpful.
Now coming to the most important part-FOOD.
We went there for our evening snacks. We had Tandoori Chicken, Tom Yum Soup n green salad. Food was good in respect of both quantity n quality. I loved the decorations too. This is a multi cuisine restro. U ll get North Indian, Mughlai, south Indian n Chinese all under the same roof.
The overall experience was pleasing. Lastly  we got a promotional gift voucher of 10% off on our next visit within a month. Hope, I ll use this coupon soon!!!üòÅ

Best bread in past few years. Especially the  chicken keema kulcha. We also tried cheese olive naan and butter naan. They were equally good.

Apart from the bread we ordered Darao Pathik Bar Special Dakbunglow and Lahsuni Zaikedar Murg. Both were good. Dakbunglow had eggs, chicken and mutton 2 pieces each. The gravy was tasty yet lite for both item and garlic flavor was very appealing in the Lahsuni Zaikedar.

Service was really nice and good to see the staffs well groomed. Price was worthy and I'll surely give a visit with family.

The one thing  that  makes  this restaurant different  from others  is it's hospitality. The staff  are very  well  behaved.  Ambience  is also  great.  Regarding  price  and quantity  I would  definitely  say it's  value for money.  Though  the flavors were good but I found it to be little  oily. So overall  it was a great  experience  and I would definitely  recommend  this  place

Situated just a min walk away from Dumdum Railway and Metro station on the Dumdum Road.
A nice restaurant with a cozy and bright ambiance perfectly suited for family dinners.
The behavior of the staffs is very welcoming and heart-warming.
Now coming to the food, it's good and up to the mark. Quantity is very good. If you not a good eater, things like rice, 2 will be sufficient for 3.
Although, I think the price is slightly high.

The dishes they served were delicious in taste and quantity wise great. The only thing they need to improve is their serving time. They took almost 30min to serve us the starter.

Located just opposite St.Mary's School, this is perhaps one of the best restaurants in Dumdum. The staffs are so humble that the greet you the moment you enter till the time you leave the restaurant. Hospitality of the staffs in this restaurant is perhaps the best i have ever experienced till date. Coming to the food, ordered sesame hunan fried, kashmiri pulao and mutton rogan josh. The hunan fried was nice and cripsy, the pulao was good and the mutton was soft and juicy. The prices of the food does complete justice because of there quality and quantity of the foods. All the foods are highly recommended and would like to visit here soon.

We ordered Chef special Pan fried Egg wrap noodles which was spicy little bit and for side dish we chose chicken in Maple chili sauce which was less spicy. Both the dishes were yummy and very very tasty. I do recommend everyone to try their chef special Pan fried Egg wrap noodles. Also the price is moderate and it's totally value for money. 
Stuff behaviour is also very good and they all are active always and they take feedback from you also for serving better in future.

They make delicious Tandoori Chicken, the Chicken Tikka lababdar is good as well , though the last time we ordered the chicken was a bit dry. (And the chicken manchow soup we ordered was strangely devoid of chicken.) Chicken Hakka noodles and dry Chili Chicken is highly recommended. Price is reasonable. Quantity is good.

I have been here many times and loved it everytime.
Located on Dumdum road near Dumdum station, I can assure you it is the best family dining in the locality. The treat you with utmost care and hospitality. The food is almost perfect. The ambience is sweet. Their menu is also pocket friendly.

WHAT WE ORDERED :

Manchow soup, DPB special soup. 
Both of them were very delicious.

Crispy Chilly Babycorn
I loved this item of theirs. Its about the perfect of them I ever tasted. Aptly crispy and aptly spicy.

Prawn in Oyster sauce, Mutton roganjosh, Garlic chicken, Lamb.
Each and every item is unique and mouth watering.
The prawn was beautifully cooked and soft enough.
The chicken, lamb, mutton, everything inch perfect.
LAMB is a must-have .

Darshan. This is a dessert with honey fried noodlechips, served with ice cream. Though the ice cream was a little less, the dessert was almost as good as the mains. 

We also tried some mocktails, blue lagoon and cola. They were refreshing.

WHAT MAKES THEM SPECIAL

Mouth watering food, within pocket friendly limits and warm treatment of the staff.

The bill was rather low compared to other such lavish restaurants. Its definitely pocket friendly.


I would absolutely visit again and again.

This place is very close relatively from my home..have seen a lot of times but didn't visit.. on the occasion of vaifota visited this place... We reached around 2pm and it was quite vacant keeping in mind it was a bengali occasion..

Location:- 5mins walk from dumdum metro/railway station.. standing tall on the dumdum station road.. If you are coming from nagerbajar by auto u can see it on ur left right after GTR stoppage..

Ambience :- it's a two storeyed restaurant.. very nicely decorated.. The comfy seats.. The gorgeously decorated and lighted ceiling... and the glass window gives you a full  view of the outside.. A great place for a romantic date or a luxurious family dine in..

Food :- 1) Tandoori chicken :- A great preperation.. soft and succulent pieces of smoky Tandoori chicken.. It was delicious.. The green chutney accompanying it was really yummy..üòÄ (4/5)

2) Mixed Fried Rice:- light..loaded with fried egg.. chicken slices.. and prawns with veggies.. It was really light and tasty.. loved the dish..üòç (5/5)

3) schezwan chicken :- it was too spicy.. 8 to 10 pieces of chicken cubes floating in a very spicy and tangy schezwan gravy.. A perfect accompaniment with the above rice.. (5/5) 

4) garlic pepper chicken :- A little less spicy dish but it was really yummy.. Top top dish.. The gravy was perfect.. The spices were blended to perfection thus giving it a great aroma.. (10/5) 

5) butter Nan :- Soft and fluffy.. but the butter was a bit less what I felt.. 

Service :- the service was prompt.. The staffs were very polite and Courteous.. The best thing is that from  the gate to the seat everyone greets u.. kudos... keep up the good work..

They charge 18% GST. .
 Our total bill was 1750 (app) so a decent on ur pocket pinch also...

The restaurant is well located near to Dumdum Metro and Train station. One thing I found quite different is the greeting done by each and every staff of the restaurant starting from the door guard to the serving waiter while we entered and left the restaurant.

Food was good and the ambience was also OK.
We liked the fish starter - Garlic Pepper fish and main course was also tasty

Overall a nice food experience at Dumdum on Kali puja eve üòä

For those who prefer less oily biriyani, DPB is the obvious choice. Yesterday, Had ordered Murg Dum Biriyani and Mutton Dum Biriyani for lunch via Swiggy . Delivery was as usual prompt (that too on occasion of Chota Diwali) and packaging was perfect. Regarding quantity , it was bang on price (rather I would say it was more than sufficient for an adult).  Both the chicken  and Mutton piece were standard sized , juicy and nicely cooked. Moreover the potato piece was perfectly boiled and was really yummy which melted easily in mouth. Added to that, both the Biriyanis had less oil content which is easy for a normal human digestive system. After having terrible experiences at Aminia and Arsalan (as they cook Biriyani with Dalda and rich spices), Darao Pothik Bor's Biriyani is a blessing in disguise for guys like me    who prefer delicious food with less rich spices and less oil(ya!ya! no dalda üòÖ). Infact it is an art in itself to prepare biriyani keeping in mind about the health factor , which DPB had mastered well. So, giving 5 star rating and hoping that DPB will carry on the same good work in near future too. Kudos and God Bless! ‚ò∫üëåüëç

we had mutton biriyani, butter tandori rotis and kadhai paneer!
the biriyani tasted like a roadside stall's one, the biriyani rice was completely undercooked and mutton was hard!
the rotis weren't served hot, and were no where near to " butter tandori roti" ,
though kadhai paneer was yummy!
overall it was a very bad experience!

Food is not that good.
Its way too costly for the kind of food they make .
Waiting time is way too much.
Too overrated.
Decoration is too flashy.

This place is located quite close to Dum Dum metro station, just opposite the St. Mary's Orphanage & Day School.¬†
The decor and lighting were pretty good. The service is prompt and staff courteous.¬†
Coming to the food the drums of heaven and takrai chicken was bliss the latter being a bit spicy.¬†
The pan fried noodles tasted just as good along with kung pao chicken . The quantity is more than satisfactory .¬†
Being one of the newbies I would definitely recommend people to visit this place.

We did visit this place on the occasion of navami. The place is near nagerbazar dumdum. The upper floor is awesome with good decorations. Behavior of the staff was good. We waited for 20 mins just for the upper floor seat. Now we ordered fire chicken, butter nun, chicken duckbundlow and kashmiri polao. All food were awesome. The amount is good to have two person enough. Price is slight high dont know if that is due to puja.

We did not order mineral water though the bottle was there and we did not notice that and we have to pay for that.

Otherwise its good

Interestingly One of the Top Restaurant in Kolkata... been here thrice, this place has never disappointed me. Be it the taste of the food be it the ambience or the food menu itself. Tried Tom Yum fried rice, egg pancake fried rice, sliced fish with pockchoy and lemon butter, busy bee kebab.... believe me You'll never find these dishes with the same taste elsewhere. Don't hesitate yourself for the location this restaurant  is one of its kind.

Food is tasty and the quantity is wholesome but that's all restaurants are supposed to be known for,right?
What stands apart about this newbie in Dumdum is their behaviour,everyone starting from the person at the door to the last waiter has a smile on their face !
They know hospitality pretty well,must say.
Also worth mentioning,the quality and quantity of their dishes didn't deteriorate during the festive days.
Good one in the otherwise parched area...
DPB surely deserves a üëç

We have visited this place on 28th September during Durga Puja. We have to wait for around 40mins. Staff are little bit lazy but it doesn't bother me. Ambience of the restaurant is good. It has two floors. They also accept payment through cards. We had crispy chilli baby corn which was sweet and sour, Mutton Dum Biryani which was less oily good in taste and Dhaba murg which was good but not spicy as I want a spicy dish so it disappointed me.

The behaviour of the servants is very bad and Ac are not working. The food quality is medium. They only pay attention to their special guest not to the normal costumer,when their special guest ordered for an ice cream they served it,but when we asked for an ice cream they said that not available.there is very perciality.its a bad experience for me . and it took about 45 min for delivering food for three persons . I am only rating for the food quality . The infrastructure of the hotel is very bad.

Services are also good as the food makes too the table at a decent pace. But the thing that stood out above all was the staff. These people were one of the most courteous restaurant staff I have seen. If you are looking for a place to dine out with your family, this place has everything you're looking for. A must try!

Disgraceful.  When we were placing the order, the staffs told that no tandoor item (Whether it is tandoor chicken or kebabs or tandoor roti) was available. Even they have stopped making many items listed in the zomato menu during this puja festival. They were forcing to go for chinese dishes. Hugely disappointed. We took exit.

This is a food joint near Dumdum station, pretty easy to access. With decent decor, they have courteous staffs too. We took away Regular fried rice, Chicken in maple chili sauce and Hupak chicken. Every item is enough in quantity. Hupak chicken is less spicy but delicious. The gravy of Chicken in maple chili sauce is a bit sweet. I think you may like the sweetness; but not recommended for those who like spicy food. 

P.S - One of my friend suggested for Rara Mutton. I'll love to try that too.

Okay,so this is one of the newest food joints opened up in our dumdum locality. Ambience is quite attractive and their staffs are very humble.I visited this place on my birthday with my family.We ordered drumsticks,lime soda, masala thumbs up as starter which was very nice.In the main course,we ate two plates of biryani and one kashmiri pulao along with chicken side dishes. Kashmiri pulao was the best part in the main course.But the biryani was not up to the mark.We ordered some fried ice creams as our desert which was the best preparation I found. Overall the quality and quantity of food was very nice as compared to other restaurants in this area.

We ordered through swiggy,  so really can't comment on the appearance or ambience of the restaurant. Also we got our food after waiting for over an hour,  but the restaurant is not to be blamed for that because swiggy was experiencing some technical glitch.  
Coming to the food, takrai chicken was extremely spicy, so all the other flavors got masked, except for lemongrass. Mutton Rogan josh was its usual yummy self,  with nicely cooked chunks of mutton. We also ordered cheese olive naan and masala kulcha. I absolutely loved their cheese naan.  
I must mention,  their portion size is quite generous. Do keep that in mind while ordering.

I ordered through swiggy so can't comment on ambience nd staff courtesy but I can surely comment on quality of food nd packaging. I ordered veg pan- fried noodles which taste a normal Chinese gravy with noodles just added all the sauces.No flavours no spicyness which a Chinese food should have. Moreover packaging was worst. It was all messed up in the packet.

Went there after booking a table on zomato after confirming a window side table. The ambience and the view was wonderful. The staffs were very courteous. Proper hygiene was maintained.  Beijing cheese roll was out of the world. So was Leisun Zaika chicken with Olive cheese nun. The pan cake fried rice was also good and it was served just like a pan cake.The waiting time was also quick considering the rush. The dessert fried ice cream was only the drawback. Also got a 10% off voucher for the next time. Hope to visit again. Thank u DPB.

May be one of the best or may be the best restaurant in terms of ambience, hospitality and courteousness in that stretch of Dum Dum road. I wasn't in a mood for a heavy meal so only ordered soups, though later I learned they are better at Bengali dishes than anything else. Bengali songs of Manna De, Kishore Kumar are pleasing to the ears as you get to dab yourself with the scented wet towels they provide.
Coming to the food. I didn't quite like the Tom Yum soup, it's the first time I tried a Thai soup and it was a fail, but the manchow was OK. 
Cost is mediocre in terms of the type of restaurant it tries to identify itself as but it's on the upside if you compare it with neighbouring eateries. Nevertheless, I'm definitely visiting this place again, soon!

A breath of fresh air in my locality really which was starving for a good quality dine out restaurant. The food is quite affordable at the outset. The staff is really friendly and helpful. I went with my Dad to get breakfast one time - South Indian - had a great time. One cant really go wrong with Dosa too much but the real test is good chutney- which they did serve. I also went later with family once and their tandoori and mughai dishes were pretty great as well, less oily, not too spicy and to the point.

Stuffs are very much well behaved ( a bit extra). We ordered pan fried veg noodles, drums of heaven (one plate of each only),it was enough for three person. Drums of heaven made us much satisfied. noodles was so so. Overall experience was good.

Its a new joint a 6monthold. they r really in a ameaturish stage that can be feel n seen.
Firstly right from the moment u enter they will make sure where u can sit that too in a rude way.even the place is empty.
Secondly guys in kurta pajama know nothing about serving n clenliness i have seen them tossing left over to the ground while cleaning the table which will bring flies for sure n they r there.
Coming to food i have ordered mutton kassa which including the GST cost 410 a plate which have 4 pieces of really boney mutton "shocker" for sure thank almighty atleast flavours where there n then  jeera rice which is good in taste and good in quantity too.
And to my another  shock my bill was 572 exact n i  have given rs600 n what i got in return only 20rs.which is really unacceptable.
Now the only good part is the decor and the approach from the owner side but the application pricing is very bad. I hope the place make amends n get a good run best of luck.

A well-decorated restaurant which has a plenty of items on its menu card. Though I wanted to sit on the 1st floor but as some private party was going on there, so we had to accommodate ourselves in the ground section. Since we decided to go for some chinese items, we opted for a rice (I think it was Yang chow chicken fried rice) and kung pao chicken. Well to be honest I really liked both the items. Also not to forget, the gentleman who took our order suggested us to which rice would be compatible with which side dish. Thanks to him! Hope to visit it again in the future but in the first floor. üòä

This has to be hands' down the best restaurant in Dumdum at the moment. The name's too Bangali and strikes a chord instantly. Now for the review -
Location - Unless you are blind, there's no way you can miss this restaurant. It's 2-3 mins walking distance away from Dumdum station, just opposite the St. Mary's school compound. What's more, you don't have to go in any lane for this restaurant. 
Ambience - Very neatly done. Looks hygienic and well-maintained. Good decor.
Service and facilities - I have deducted 0.5 from the rating for the chairs. The chairs are straight-back chairs and it gets a tad difficult for someone like me who has a backache and needs to recline a little. In terms of service, bang on! They serve with a smile, they are open to feedback and they cater to you well.
Food - Here's comes the best part! This is a multicuisine that balances its dishes perfectly. The chinese dishes are as good as the biriyani. The quantity is a treat for the price and I would specifically recommend the Butter Garlic Fish. Delicious!

Located just by the very busy Dumdum Road, this restaurant is very easy to locate. So, one fine afternoon, a group of ravenous friends decided to give this place a shot. Once you enter, you cannot help but be a little taken aback, as you wouldn't usually expect a restaurant with such lovely decor like this in such a place.

Coming to the food, we went down the North Indian route and ordered a Tandoori Murg Makhan Masala and a Lehsuni Zaika Murg, along with some Peas Pulao and Masala Kulcha to mop it all up, and a salad on the side. ¬†Both the chicken dishes were lovely, but I preferred the makhan masala murg, which tasted like the familiar and ever-comforting butter chicken, just a little bit more. The masala kulcha was lovely, soft with adequate filling. The pulao, though heavy with the aroma of ghee, fell just a little short in terms of flavour.

The service was pretty quick and the food reached us within 15 minutes of ordering. The servers were extremely polite as well. The place also has great value-for-money, considering the quality and quantity, compared to most other places of this type. I will definitely go back to sample the oriental menu. Till then, keep up the good work!

Tried 1st time cheese olive nun and its soo good. Dal makhani and murg tikka lababdar also very tasty and yam. In Chinese, we ordered chicken fried rice and sweet n souur chicken n crispy chilly babycorn. Sweet n sour chicken is not up to the mark... coating was hard and chicken was less. 
Special mention is the service by the stuffs. They literally pampers us.. very friendly.

We ordered for firecracker chicken, veg friedrice and chicken pad thai. 
Out of all the 3 items the chicken was awesome, spicy and very tasty. 
The veg friedrice was ok tastewise and the quantity is huge, please keep that in mind while ordering. Same goes for the pad thai, huge quantity but i didnt like it too much. It needed more veggies. 
Considering the quantity its very pocket friendly. 
Will try out different items next time.

So far the food items are concerned most of the items are delicious and worth a try. Not to miss out items are DPB special soup, busy bee kebabs, chicken beizing rolls, crispy hunan chicken, peas polao, peshwari murg , biriyani etc. In fact all of their preparations are mouth watering. Chinese and thai preparations are also nice.

It's a multi cuisine restaurant so you can get various kind of food..... Well me and my friend when there are for having dinner and we ordered biriyani.... The speciality of the biriyani is they provide you a huge amount of biriyani with three or four pieces of mutton... They were really juicy and tasty.. but the problem was it was too costly... I mean 1 biriyani for 300 rupees!!!... You can try the other foods also... They serves really tasty Chinese foods... I vl say u must give it a try if u are near by

I ordered mixed Pan fried Noodles and kung pao chicken(home delivery).On receiving my order I found out there were 3 containers surprisingly.They packed a very small amount of so called fried noodles which was quite less as compared to the gravy provided in the 2nd container.The gravy tasted weird.The Kung pao chicken was good though..
Heavily disappointed with the noodles (both quality and quantity)
Restaurant people pls note 230 bucks plus tax is not a joke..highly overrated restaurant..
However after submitting this review the manager called me and talked courteously and arranged for a new dish the next day free of cost..really happy with the quick response from the management..
changed my rating thereby..thank you

Hearing great reviews from fellow foodies, I set out on a sultry afternoon after a tiring day to have my much awaited lunch. I was absolutely elated to find a multicuisine restro just opposite St. Mary's Day School.

On entering, started my series of horrible experiences. The air conditioner was just working in one section and I was not allowed to enter as I had gone alone. Although I saw vacant four seaters yet I was made to sit in some other section where the air conditioner took time to start afresh. On coaxing several times, out of pity and after much hesitance I was allowed in the AC section.

I was not allowed to choose the table I liked and was literally compelled by the staff to sit at a corner even though most of the tables were vacant.

Next came the part which turned me insane. I had asked them to suggest me a soup and a starter which had a balanced neutral flavour as I don't prefer spicy stuff due to my subtle palate, also I was too tired due to the heat. I ordered for a garlic mushroom chicken soup and a mountain chilli chicken presuming this would be like be tasty and light.

What came to me?
- A soup having similar taste to that of a manchow soup without the noodles and a lot of garlic infested.
- A huge plate having 8 pieces of diced chicken and thrice it's volumes were just chillies of humongous sizes and you can imagine how spicy it could be.
(P.S - I am drinking water ever since then)

Then of course the manager comes down to each table and asks for zomato rating, telling people we are at 4.2 and requesting people to shoot their points high so as to uplift their rating.

I am terrified by this horrendous experience in a so called "4.2" restaurant. It saddens me to think of the fact that people have stopped enjoying food and serving good food, all they are concerned about is the rating and a money making.

- From a disappointed foodie

Complete value for money.. ambience is nive,staffs are well behaved. Wish to visit again soon.

The decor is fantabulous and the food is fatafati. We started with mocktail. Tasted pineapple, mango, grape based mocktail and blue lagoon, exquisitely garnished. Chimney soup has real originality. Just imagine, a starter prepared with lotus roots. Mind blowing. Whole bhetki fry with sauce is really delicious. Golapjamun prepared in house with almond shreds melts in the mouth. We ended our journey with Paan ice cream of Baskin & Robins. I would have rated this joint 6 out of 5, if there was scope.

At premium location of DumDum metro station this restaurants surely catch ur eye. South Indian outlet is in ground floor and Indian Chinese dishes available in first floor ..The tables are arranged in a such a way that u can enjoy ur food with watching busy DumDum street. Interior lighting was good ..The staffs were well dressed in Punjabi and know manners. We entered in a scorchy afternoon of Saturday and just after seating they provided wet tissues which really needed‚Äã that moment. We ordered Kashmiri polao and waiter suggested us Dhaba murg spicy along with a fresh green salad. Kashmiri polao was really awesome in taste n assence; sweet n tangy with pineapples. I didn't like so much the murg recipe. Wish to go for next time..

Darao Pothik Bor is just opposite of St Mary's School. Near to Dum Dum station, maximum it is 7 mins walk.It is on the roadside so very convenient to locate.I don't think the variety of food that they are offering is anywhere close to any nearby restaurants.We started with DPB special soup and then we ordered Takrai Chicken & Thai Basil fish. Fish was not as expected,it was not upto the mark but like many of other reviewers have also mentioned Takrai Chicken was great. Soup was somewhat similar to chimney soup but I did not like the taste. Coming to the main course we had Egg Pan cake fried rice which tasted like heaven & then we ordered Goolo chicken & Hupak chicken along with Singapore Rice Noodles. I did not like the taste of Goolo chicken & Noodles,Hupak chicken was ok. They really need loads of improvement when it cones to noodles. Best part is they ask for feedback for every‚Äã food they serve,which is rare and place is quite pocket friendly as well. I would again visit this place and hope that it has improved.

A very beautiful family restaurant on the main road of dumdum at a less than 5 minutes walking distance from dumdum station. A beautiful royal feel like decor with one of the best hospitality. Food were really tasty. Like from starter popcorn chicken to the ending dessert all were just outstanding. As we were celebrating one of our friend's birthday there it was a great time we had. The thing w loved the most was their humbleness. Can't tell you about the price tag exactly as it was a birthday treat for us. But one thing for sure it will worth your every single penny. Very nice restaurant and will visit again very soon.

Ordered food last night. The delivery personnel took about 90 minutes to deliver it. The worst part is that the container weren't closed properly and all the gravy of the mutton roganjosh fell into the packet mixing with Biryani. We somehow managed to eat coz we're starving and that was the last resort. I don't have any more syllables to describe this disgust experience.

It's an unique restaurant situated at a very busy place near Dum Dum station. Food is good. We ordered Chicken Fried Rice with Maple Chicken. Also tried some North Indian Dishes i.e, Pulao and Mutton Rogan Josh alongwith one side dish of chicken. Don't remember the exact name of the chicken item but overall the experience was good. I liked the food and also the quantity is good. Food is tasty but the chinese fried rice could have been better and might have some parity with the price. Maple Chicken and Mutton Rogan Josh were delicious. Other dishes were good. My suggestion is mainly for the chinese item which it lacks the flavors of proper chinese so you should work on it. Ambience, service were excellent. Just it would be great if keep a parity of items with the price. It's bit on the higher side since this is just the beginning if you compare with Muticuisines likeBar B Q...

Food : Ouutstanding.
Staff: Outstanding.
Ambience & Decor: Outstanding.

What else needs to be mentioned.

You all can well understand the kind of place it is.

Dumdum came up with such a wonderful place.¬†

There's every aspect by which this place can be termed as a 5 STAR QUALITY place.

I am little possessive on the raw materials being used in the food and so prefer always the best rated places for eating out. I visited this place by going through the reviews and trust me, it was all above my expectations.

I am keen to make a move here again.

I instructed the staff to modify the ingredients being used in the dishes and to my astonishment, they were bang on perfection.

Cooked, served and tasted so well..

I am sure that I shall visit this place all over again & again & again..

Thanks DPB...For this wonderful place.

As per their recommendation, we went for Chinese preparation and trust me,, IT WAS HEAVEN !!

I think, this is one of the best chinese preparation which I ever had..

I had ordered murg biryani and chicken- do-pyaza.My order was served to me in a Jeffy. The quality and quantity of the meal was good.The chicken was cooked to perfection and the gravy did not have any extra oil in it ,which shows the expertize of the chiefs in the kitchen.You can visit this place, if you happen to be in Dum Dum and are looking for a place to hagout with family or friends.

I ordered on a home delivery... Thursday night around 9 pm...
Timing - Delivery time was excellent.. Though i dont live v far.. But even then it was pretty much on the mark...
Quantity - Very good...they mentioned.. Fried Rice was 1 for 2...and that was actually on the mark..
Cost - Appropriate... Not very high.. Based on the quantity it was very just...
Quality - I have eaten better... I ordered, Mixed Fried rice, Singapore Rice Noodles, and two Indian Chk Side dishes... Know its a bit weird.. But i like it.. The noodles was good.. But all food was ok taste wise.. Not overwhelming...
Over all - Jack of all typea of cusine master of none... But its a pretty good place to eat out... I will order again....

Visiting restaurant right now... Huge wait time for the food to come out... Service is rough here.. 
Place is like most other Multicuisine restaurant.. Sells from dosa to Birayani... Most food taste the same.. 
Decor is good..

First when we reached we were provided with wet tissue wipes. :-) second let's talk about the food ,the food was excellent we ordered the busy bee kabab which was just mind blowing !!! JUST WOW. We also ordered chicken dopaiyaza and butter which was equally good ! Last to mention about the service ,the staff where very humble and we got a warm greeting from the staff. One thing I should mention that the hygiene of the food is maintained quite well as they have a kitchen which has a transparent glass wall which showed that they prepare food under extreme hygiene conditions . just one thing to say to the staffs " Please do maintain this standard and I pray this restaurant reaches the top ! ":-)

The restaurant is lavishly furnished with wood and beautiful decorations. Also plays retro Bengali songs at the background. It costs about 750 for an average couple. Staffs are polite and play a big helping hand in menu selection giving a brief description of the recipes. It's a multi cuisine restaurant with a wide range of available food items. Overall a happy experience to dine there.

I love love love this new restaurant! Located at a very convenient position this is an excellent joint. The ambience is plesant and is well lit unlike other restaurants.
I had ordered takrai chicken, chicken sizzler, kashmiri pulao, spicy honey chicken and butter paneer masala.
 The takrai chicken was delicious and was very filling.
The sizzler was juicy and the quantity enough for two.
The pulao was light and fragrant with ample dry fruits.
The honey chicken was tangy and a pleasant surprise for most restaurants serve it a bit too sweet.
The paneer was creamy and tasty with around 15 pieces of paneer.
The servers are polite and helpful.
The home delivery service is also extremely quick.
The prices are though on a higher side but worth it.

Finally happy to have a good multicuisine restaurant at dum dum. Darao pothik bor is located just opposite to st mary's school. Not too big bt its spacious though..well decorated, good sitting arrangements and the thing i wud appreciate is the behaviour of the staffsüòä. They maintain a good hygiene..wen we sat down they provided us with wet wipes..
Coming to the food..its excellent.
Since it was a family get together so we were not sure about the quantity..but the staffs stated dat the quantity was enough for 2 adults..so we ordered mixed fridrice, sweet and sour chicken, kung pao chicken, takrai chicken and tom yum friedrice.
The quantity was huge..3 people can easily have a bowl of rice, and the side dishes too had about 12 to 14 pieces of chicken and the taste of each and every dish were too good..
I loved the reataurant and the service..wud love to visit again

Situated bang opposite to lords er goli, this is also a new kid on the block. It was so very needed in this area. A true gem.. Name is quite unique, attracting people for sure. 
Location :- prime location.. Just 3-4 minutes of walking from Dumdum junction towards Nagerbazar. Well lit and nicely done.. It will catch your attention for sure. 
Ambiance/Interior:- Interior is praiseworthy. The panel lighting, false ceiling, wooden chairs, pristine white cutleries, everything was a thumbs-up!! 
Service :- Amazing!!! Courteous, polite, attentive what not!! They even provide you facial wipes!! So minutely  they care for your well-being while you're there. 
Food :- It is the main part of any food review, so coming to the food, we ordered only starters. 
1)Takrai chicken(1 plate) @:- crisp fried shredded chicken, doused in red Chilly sauce, barbecue sauce and some other spices and herbs, bell-peppers, roasted cashews and spring onions.. Tasted amazing. It just tickled our taste bud.uplifted the mood. Perfect indo Chinese. A must try!! 
2)Murgh maalai kebab(1plate):- Six Boneless and well-marinated n well cooked, tender pieces of chicken, smeared in malaai.. Served with mint-dahi chutney, fresh salad and one roasted, rolled Papad. It seemed perfect after that spicy starter. 
3)Fresh lime soda(1) :- I asked for a mixed one, but what they provided was on a bit sweeter side. But it was refreshing. 
Pocket pinch was 560/-
Will visit for sure.

Visited this place with my family on Poila Boishakh (Bengali New Year), the place was full so had to wait for approx half an hour. Seating facilities for bigger groups (6 or more) is less. But the wait was really worthwhile.

Pros -
i. Above everything - Darao Pothik Bor has some really really courteous staff.
ii. The kitchen can be visible via a large glass window and it is really really clean, you can actually see where your food has come from.
iii. Quality of food was excellent, we ordered mutton biriyani (good), mixed noodles (excellent), laal maas (excellent) and kung pao prawn (excellent).

Cons -
None.

Verdict - People in north Kolkata must try this place atleast once, the taste of food is truly good and there is good variety of non-vegetarian dishes.

Will definitely visit again. My message to the management is - keep up the good work, all the best.

After a hectic schedule at emergency need my belly-full to my heart's content! But at Dumdum area,there is less copiousness of eatery! Now,here "Darao pothikbor" is like oasis.Foods r palatable & scrumptious.road-side ambience is good as well as the service.Badly needed this quality of a dining in this area.In one word -just transcendent...

Excellent service. Starters are delicious. And the sheer variety of quality dishes served is amazing considering most other multi cuisine restaurants fail to do that. Loved the Beijing Roll. Ended well with a scoop of cotton candy ice cream. Ambiance and decor is quite nice. Conveniently located on the main road. Must visit for all foodies of North Kolkata.

Ordered a Chinese Veg Combo Meal for lunch from Darao Pothik Bor few days ago. Honestly speaking it was one of the best meals I have had in recent times. The combo consisted of Veg Fried Rice, Veg Hakka Noodles, 6 pieces Chilly Paneer, 4 pieces Veg Manchurian, Kimchi Salad and Gulab Jamun. And all these for 100 bucks only. Its that cheap! The food was good, I just felt that the noodles were thick, rest...all thumbs up! All the items were delicious. Looking forward to trying more items from here.

This place is located near the dumdum metro station. If you are moving towards nagerbazar  from dumdum this place will be on your right. The first thing I noticed about this place is their kitchen through a glass wall. It is super clean. I was ordering to take away so I stood and watched as my food was being cooked. The staff  are very courteous and helpful. The food is definitely good and the best in the area. Very generous helpings. Prices are 10% more than the other nearby places but it is worth it. Deducted the 0.5 due to little lack of knowledge about the dish I had asked for. On the whole a very nice place where I would definitely go back.

Too Good Experience at DPB(Darao Pothik Bor). This is located near DumDum Metro & Railway station. Walkable distance.

Now What I prefer most is good hygiene that is damn good at this place.

Reasonable rates. Top Quality Food.Bit space constraint but still very well decorated.

Kitchen is very good, modern(see Pics). Staff is very well behaved.

I had Home delivery & take away every time.

What I had are as follows & their ratings

Mutton Biriyani- Good-3.5/5. Typical smell which r sold in street is not there.

Chicken Hariyali Kabab-4/5. Nice soft.

Irani Fish Tikka-4.8/5. Tender...was..too..good (Must try)...less spicy.

Char daal ka methi tadka-4.75/5....

Dhania Roti-4.5/5....soft...dhania..embedded.

Hara..Bhara..kabab-4.75/5....soft...veg form of chapali or galawati kabab...Tender...very good...must try for vegans. Mutton Rara is awesome and a must try !!!

South Indian-Dosa, Onion Uthapam-4.9/5....Best South Indian I had in Kolkata...Excellent chutneys.

(There is no tax added for South Indian dishes)

I felt this place is the best restaurant in DumDum.

Awesome ambience, Good quality food, well service. I went there twice and again and again I'd like to go there to taste the other dishes. This is located in Dumdum road near dumdum station so easy to locate this place. Inner decoration is so nice with slow music. When we entered and took seat, we were provided an wet tissue to fresh ourself up. And after having our meal they gave hot water with lemon. First time we ordered Crispy chilli baby corn, butter naan, Murg tikka lababdar, Chocolate ice cream and second time we ordered Hakka mix noodle, pan fried chilli chicken. All the dishes were too good in quantity and quality as well. I will recommend this restaurant to all my friends and relatives. This has become my one of the favourite restaurants.

This one is catching a lot of eyes and for all the good reasons. Dumdum is in sheer need of some good dining places and this one clearly fills up some gap. They offer a lot of dishes, I tried their Chinese as of now. The kung pao chicken was LOVELY. Can't blame their spices. Pretty generous with the amount though the prices could be a bit on the lower side since they have just started and the infrastructure being mere decent. Their veg fried rice was tasty too filled with a lot of corns. Will definitely try some more of their offerings pretty soon.

By far the best restaurant in this area. It was quite a good experience. Plush interiors, comfortable seating and warm ambiance adds to the glory of the place.

Staff is polite and courteous. Service was very efficient. The person serving us was always keeping a watch and was spontaneous to fill our glasses and clear out the dishes without being asked for. 

Coming to the most important part. Food is just great. We ordered fresh green asparagus soup and Coriander clear soup. Loved the taste.
Crispy Hunan chicken: Subtly spiced, perfect crispy from outside and cooked well from inside.
Szechuan rice: Even though it's meant to be spicy it wasn't too spicy to handle and maintaining all the flavours. 
Kung Pao chicken: This was an excellent dish. Crispy chicken tossed in a sauce which tastes sweet on the tongue first just to be awakened by the hit of spice later. Loved the addition of roasted cashews that's expected in Kung Pao chicken.

Had a lovely time!

Finally found a new place to try at. Located at a very nice place where travelling is extremely convenient. The menu card consists of some really uncommon yet mouth watering dishes. The behaviour of all the staffs is warming enough. The must try among the lot is the chimney soup and the chicken cheese Beijing roll. They serve huge quantities which even makes it pocket friendly and beneficial for a group of 4-5people. All-over the place is doing good and a must try for all the foodies out there. It won't disappoint you at all.

Located in the busy Dumdum area, the name always amused me whenever I passed by this restaurant. I was really impressed by the service, very prompt & polite; which sadly many establishments in our city just keep ignoring. I was ordering takeaway (so I didn't stay there for too long) but the first impressions left by the interiors were soothing. The food also tasted really good; we had ordered for Burnt Garlic Fried Rice & Sliced Fish In Chilli Mustard Sauce. The fish item tasted refreshingly different and not too pungent despite having mustard in it. The fried rice was good too though could be improved upon (in my opinion, my little son thought it was perfect). We are looking forward to dining there and trying out their Indian cuisine. Highly recommended based on first impressions.

The newest 2 storey multicuisine near Dum Dum station with glass walls. Ordered take away from there. One wok tossed fried rice one schezwan fried rice one chicken in black bean sauce one chili garlic prawn one darshaan and one raita. All of them tasted quite decent. Unless you really want to compare like darshaan was indianised with nimki tossed in honey and sesame etc. That too however tasted good. Staffs are uber courteous. You might really get confused with the VIP treatment and random call backs to ensure correct order and correct address along with 10% discounts and extra initiative to get soft drinks from nearby shop which they don't have in menu. Just few minutes later I received a watsap with a complete details of the order along with their discount board which was really surprising. However both the rices were same. They forgot to give the sch rice. After sometime they called up again for the feedback and when we informed them about the rice they became extremely apologetic. We mentioned it's fine we liked the rice however they said they will give feedback to the chef. After sometime the guy who took the order personaly arrived to apologize again and this time what surprised us even more was they gifted us with a container full of uber soft and huge sized hot gulam jamun to compensate their mistake which were extremely yummy. Even next day they called up to confirm if the quality and quantity was good. Overall it was an awesome experience to deal with them. Previously also we ordered crispy fried chicken and mixed noodles which were pretty acceptable in taste. However to lead the race they have to work on the taste quite a bit. With this dedication if they continue to focus on the taste.. am sure they will reach there quite soon. So it's a place from where u can order whenever you are feeling a lil hungry to order food from any nearby outlet. Or u have guests at home.

I visited this place with my parents on a Sunday evening. The place was a bit crowded but we were given a nice place beside the window.The attendants were very courteous and well mannered and they attended every now and then. We ordered Beijing roll and tandoor chicken for the starters, mixed Hakka noodles and fried rice, chicken in maple syrup, a fish preparation for main course and fried ice cream for dessert. The quantity of every item was more than enough for three persons and the taste was delicious. I've been to many places but this place has the best Chinese so far. The ambience and decoration of the Restuarant was also very nice. I would recommend to visit this place with family and friends.

I ordered takeout on new year's, they had cut down to some of their basic dishes because of high demands. So my review will probably not do justice to their food.
Even on a rush day, they maintained a decent quality of the food, the taste was pretty good. The kitchen is visible to the customers, they also maintain good hygene. The quantity was what caught my attention, what little they lack in quality, they more than make up for it in quantity. 3 decently hungry people could easily fill up on 2 rice or noodle dishes and 1 main course. We ordered the chicken in oyester sauce, a mixed fried rice and a mixed hakka noodle. As I said, I had to order from their basic menu. The fried rice was excellent and so was the chicken in Oyster sauce. They could try toning down on the spice game in the noodles though.
It is also worth mentioning that the service was pretty good.

Finally You Guys in Zomato, even I have suggested to add you guys here! And good to see that, And even better thing is that finally we got a "Really good restaurant" in this Dum Dum station to Nager bazar area zone. They have started like on before 2month of 2016 puja and I have visited very next day and then I went there many times even they offered some discount for us but alas! I can't even touch the door in Durga Puja time, it was that much full of people waiting for their turn to have some tastier stuff to make their tastebuds wake up. Comes to its review, Decor wise very upgraded and amazing restaurant with very good service, representative are very well behaved even I don't like use the word waiter for them,they are really really nice and always there to serve you, time to serve the food is little bit more but it just a starting trouble and you can wait for that much tastier food. Quality and quantity of the entire dishes they are serving at that time are very good. Among all I like their Ginger capsicum fried rice and chicken masala makkhan wala ( may be the name of this dish is little different and I don't noticed properly, actually whenever I have visited, they're always knew it that I am there for that dish because it's really delicious). So, finally my suggestion is to guys keep it up and keep your service same. I would like to visit again and again..

This is probably one of my only reviews where I have focused on food equal to the quality of service at a restaurant. I firmly believe that a restaurant should be defined by the food more than everything else combined. However, this place took me by surprise and that too a pleasant one. So let's get to the point-

1. Ambiance- Well decorated, clean, maybe a bit clustered
2. Menu- A wide range of offerings ranging from the usual Chinese and Indian to the lengths of sizzlers and so on. A lot to choose from, a good thing as far as I am concerned.
3. Management- I am specifically writing this as I felt this place is being very well managed and presented. From a noteworthy name to the beautifully designed menu, everything is right where it is supposed to be and surprised me in being so.
4. Food- We had the Indian dishes. They have given fancy names to the dishes, however they are usual dishes. We had the re-branded reshmi butter masala and tandoori roti along with a variety of kebabs. The kebabs were excellent, soft and tender, moist inside, a perfect blend of smokey flavour. The chicken was prepared nicely. The gravy was a bit rich, but the chicken tasted very fresh and was pretty soft. Allover, a good experience, better than most places. Oh and yes, quantity is sufficient for two.
5. Service- Now why is put this last is, this is one thing that you will notice and remember about this place. Simply outstanding. It can match the service of any premium fine dine restaurant in the city. I can say this from experience. I wont give much away, but they are super hospitable and will make you feel that you are spending money at the right place.

My take, worth spending once you consider the entire offering. Very good experience.

This place has a nice classy look.

I've visited four times so far. Food quality to staff behaviour...everything is very satisfactory. Such a classy eatery opening in Dumdum station area has made me much happy. Have tried their Phad Thai noodles, mein foon, chilli prawn..all were quite good. Prices may seem a little on the higher side, but the quantity served more than makes up for it. And they don't yet charge taxes, which is the best part. I hope they keep up with the expectations they have set in the coming days as well. üëçüëç

Ambience is great. Each and every staff well-behaved, professional and know how to give importance to customers. They don't keep you waiting for too long to enjoy their quality food. My husband ordered tandoori roti with butter, cheese nun and tandoor murg makhan masala. Yes the food was really yummy. Chicken is well-cooked, moist, tasty. They are good in quality as well as in quantity. Tandoori roti and nun they both tastes too good. I am fully satisfied with my 1st experience there and want to enjoy their food again and again.

Dumdum station area was in a serious scarcity of good restaurants before this "darao pathik bor" restaurant. It is a new restaurant near dumdum metro station,on dumdum station road. There is huge space inside. Comfortable seating arrangement. Staffs are very courteous. The best part of this place is that they serve a huge quantity which is sufficient for 3-4people at a cost of one plate. The quality is also very good. I have been to this place thrice. I would suggest to try Cantonese rice here. They make the best Cantonese rice that I have ever tasted. The burnt ginger and coriander rice is also unique and tasty.

It won't cost more than Rs.600/- for 3-4people for a wholesome lunch /dinner..

In many of my restaurant reviews which are located in Dumdum area, I have repeatedly mentioned that DumDum couldn't flourish in restaurant business because of the people resides here. But this place is totally an exeption. Located just on dumdum road with a big space covering 2 floors and around 100 people sitting arrangement, this place serves indian, chinese, south indian all types of cusine under one roof. The waitors are very courteous, the interior is also nice to look at. Speciality is the chicken tandoori and oak fish but you can order any other food of ur choice as you won't be disappointed. 
The price of all the items are quite high - 1 full plate tandoori would cost you 400 rupees around.
Being a new kidnin the town, they are not that professional in terms of customer dealings however, they are continuously trying to thrive upon.
Definitely worth a visit.

Busy bee kabab - in a word . Outstanding . Simply delicious.
Veg biryani - too good.for d first tym I have seen vegetables(a lot actually) in a biryani üòÇ.
Kashmiri pulao - average . Dey included a lot of fruits.so it has a unique taste.
Peshawari curry - good .. size of chicken was bigger Dan other restaurants

Only one con I have noticed dat deir service is pretty slow. u guys should look into dis matter . üòÉ
And yes budget..right .. dese 4 items cost 780 rs .the menu card price is inclusive of all taxes

First of all the name is ''Darao Pothik Bor'' as mentioned in their restuarant.
Secondly the behaviour of the staffs and management are quite polite n caring. The restuarant is clean and their services are worth describing good as well.
The menu available is including the taxes so the price though might look a bit high but one will feel the same pinch if it would had been less priced and then add-on the tax.
Coming to the food
We ordered crispy chilly baby corn, pan fried dry chicken, wok tossed mixed fried rice, hot garlic chicken, kashmiri polau and murg peshawari masala
The crispy baby corn were really crispy n good in taste and the pan fried chicken as well for the starters
The mixed rice n hot garlic chicken i felt a bit usual but above the average though
The murg peshawari masala was good
Worth the price and service and the ambience
Must try this one if you are at dum dum. 
Since it's a multicuisine people of every choice may get their choices.
The most good thing i felt about the restuarant is about their kitchen which isn't inside a hidden wall but only differentiated by glass wall bringing transperancy about the hygiene n quality of the food to their customers.
The quantity are ample for two for one bowl of rice.
