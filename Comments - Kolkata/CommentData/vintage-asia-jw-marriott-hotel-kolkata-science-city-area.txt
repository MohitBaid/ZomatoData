I liked everything about this place...The food, the ambience, the staff (special shoutout to our server Mr Dweep whose recommended sangria went quite well with our meal). Starting out with their awesome dimsums and roast chicken appetisers we moved on to burnt garlic rice and chicken for main course. Special mention for their caramelised braised pork which is a must try. We finished off with their homemade coconut icecream served with a slice of darsan which really was the icing to such a splendid meal. Will definitely visit again to try out their other offerings with Souvik Guha

From the ambience to the food, there is nothing I didn‚Äôt like about this place. Friendliest of the staff in particular to our server(Anirudh) made my birthday overwhelming and Asian food lip smacking even to ya vegetarians. Never before had some amazing dim sums and their chefs specials were equally great. If u r mood for some Thai or Chinese do visit this place. Thanks for making my bday a great obeüç∫

Vintage Asia offers a cosy and comfortable ambience to have a quality time with near and dear ones. The food here is delicious. We specially enjoyed the burnt garlic rice with thai prawn green curry. Subhadeep took great care of us. All the other staff were also very attentive.  Will visit again.

It's ridiculous...No body bothers to pick up the phone and if someone does they will just transfer the call to some other person and that person shall not pick up....If I could give negative rating I would do that....o haven't visited the place because staff just can't take reservations

We celebrated my sisters birthday here, being a member they had taken prior reservation and alas for 6 people we were alloted a small table. On requesting to shift us to a better table, we were very rudely pointed out that we had taken a reservation for 6 and only 5 of us had turned up. Thus began a sad experienced, one of the managers at the restaurant was unethical and rude, he spoke to us in way that you'd never imagine any in a star hotel to. We started our meal with chives and Chiu dumplings which was just so-so, the edamame and truffle dumplings was amazing. The spring rolls were different from what we get elsewhere and tasted pretty good. We called for an assorted mushroom appetiser which was simply bad,not well cooked at all. Our cocktails which was all on the bartenders recommendation were decent. The Silken tofu was the worst dish of the day, the fried rice with it was great though. The pad Thai was my favourite among all the dishes. The chicken satay we called for which probably I had the most expectation from was a disaster. The  tender coconut icecream Was excellent and the mango cream br√ªl√©e which just edible. My meal and the entire experience at vintage Asia could have been way better if people back there knew how to treat their guests. Special days don't come back every month and the experience did ruin her birthday.
Ps-their hygiene sense is really bad, the cutlery we use would be kept bare on the table and given back to you like with the next dish. They don't even use a plate to keep the cutlery they want you to re-use.

This is the first time I have experienced the food in Vintage Asia. When its come to Asian food we would always prefer authentic chinese food and when the thought process is to have chinese food then there is no other alternative of Vintage Asia.  I have visited so many chinese cuisine prior to it but this one has definitely some x factor. The ambience and the interior of JW will make u amazed. In addition to it the food quality and plenty of food items will definitely impress you. 
 The quantity of food is also pretty good. We have tried prawn, chicekn, singaporian rice,noodles, Thai curry, Great Asian Soup. Every items were out of the box and made us spellbound. 

As per the food quality financially it is an expensive cuisine. But the food worth money!
Go and rush all food lovers you will definitely feel good.

Staffs and host were extremely polite and co operative. We enjoyed the evening fullest.

Kudos to our host Subhadeep for the warm hospitality.
Cheers!

Myself and my wife decided to spend our 30th Marriage Anniversary evening in this Asian Restaurant at the Level 1 of the newly opened five star hotel Mariott at EM By Pass at Kolkata. It was really a wise decision and Subhadeep and his team at Vintage Asia made our special evening a memorable one. We pre booked our table through Zomato and Subhadeep greeted us at the entrance with a warm smile and guided us to our table. The restaurant has a good rich oriental decor. The interior arrangement gives a feel of space and privacy for each table , which makes this restaurant ideal as venue for special occasions. We were offered welcome complimentary drink. It was a nice preparation of lemon juice, litchi juice, lemon grass and egg white with pomegranate. It was really refreshing. Subhadeep guided us with our selection of menu. We chose Soft shell crab shallow fried , served with vegetable julien and tomato salsa deep. Crab was crispy and lightly coated with corn flour or like. Taste was perfect. For main course we selected Burnt Garlic Fried Rice with capcicum and Prawn in XO sauce. Fried rice was one the best I had in an oriental restaurant. Little sticky fried rice was heavenly and you can feel in your palate seperately the taste and flavour of burnt garlic, ginger and capcicum. Prawn was well cooked , succulent with slightly tangy dark gravy of XO sauce served with chinese mushrooms and french beans. It really went well with the fried rice. Jasmine tea was served by Subhadeep from a traditional copper kettle with a 18 inch long neck. To our pleasant surprise, Subhadeep and his team brought a dark chocolate cake on a plate with Happy Anniversary written on it with molten chocolate as a complimentary dessert. The cake was heavenly with rich dark chocolate that melts in our mouth with each bite. These personal touches from the team made the restaurant and our evening so special. Subhadeep helped us to click our photos to commemorate the evening. Thanks Subhadeep and entire Vintage Asia team for extending personal touches, which made us feel special. Great ambience, excellent cuisine and lastly extremely warm restaurant team. What else do you require?? I shall highly recommend all oriental cuisine lovers to come to this restaurant. One of the best place in Kolkata for sure.

Brilliant restaurant on the first floor lobby of JW Marriott hotel.
The service is immaculate. Professional staff who are up on their feet to serve the patrons. They serve a truly delectable menu. Be here for an authentic Thai/Chinese Fooding experience. Make sure you sip the Jasmine tea they serve with an elongated kettle. It is warm and soothing. 
We tried the mandatory Burnt Garlic fried rice alongwith stir fried Vegetables. The starters were the showstoppers. Broccoli corn dumplings, chicken dimsums, spring rolls and fried chicken. They all were absolutely superb to have. It set the tone for the evening. 
It was a great experience here. Reservations recommended.

Only taking points off because I have had better dimsum, not in Kolkata though.

Vintage asia at jw.. i was hoping for a jaw-dropping ambience with amazing food and service... It happened but in pieces.

Lets break it into 

Ambience - this was a let down.. from jw as well a theme resturant i was hoping for much better.. if u are on a candle light meal which they say... I would say give this a miss.. (3 of 5)

Service - the service was great ... Very courteous and friendly.  This is what is expected from a good starred hotels.. but the ushers who escorted us to the table where a tade down rude and didn't give us a table desired and free till we left. (4 of 5)

Food - the food was okish.. we ordered.. a yum yum soup which was good as well as the gelatin based momos but spring roll was a let down as well as the complementary sides on the table. But have a south east Asia touch to the food but it was indianised.... (4 of 5)

Overall a good place to me if u cherish an thai food... Else give this a miss

After a satisfactory but not so overwhelming dining experience at JW Kitchen earlier this year, for my sister's birthday dinner we checked into Marriott again, but this time for Vintage Asia - which has been creating quite a buzz in every Thai and Chinese lover's bookmark section for some time now.
The aura the place has is just right for a warm and oh-so-perfect weekend dinner. Dim lights, lovely music and super awesome hospitality! Subhadeep and Aniruddh were our hosts for the night and they literally took care of everything. In the drinks I loved my Vodka based cocktail, which had a cosmo feel to it but only stronger as they called it the blushing dragon. The bartender did a real good job with the Lemon Blueberry too, a chilled blueberry slush with the dash of coconut and lemon.
We started with the Pork Xiao Long Bao, juicy and succulent house special pork dimsums. It came with 3 pieces a plate and each gulp tasted like a million bucks. Clearly the best dish of the night. The deep fried chicken wings were lovely too, tossed in spicy barbeque sauce served with yellow sauce.
In the mains we went for their Chicken hot pot, accompanied by the classic wok tossed noodles suggested by the hosts. Honestly the hot pot style chicken undoubtedly did taste great, but nothing out of the box or worth longing over. The wok tossed noodles was just fine to go with the spicy diced chicken.
The dessert section was Steller, at per with the appetizers. The Tub Tim Krob was something I have never had before, an authentic thai dessert with the goodness of fruits and milk. Frozen waterchestnut coated with pomegranate jelly served in Coconut milk. Amazing job done! Being a sweet tooth and a fruit lover I would definitely recommend it to people who have a knack for trying out new desserts and it certainly won't disappoint. Their homemade tender Coconut icecream was lovely too. Both rich on flavour and taste.
Vintage Asia was a great experience. The prices are definitely on the higher side but the place is a clear thumbs up in terms of food, ambience and service.

I have been here before and owing to the quality of both, service and food, I decided to pitch this place for a family lunch. 
We were greeted by Subhadeep and went for his suggestions. Needless to say, his suggestions turned out gold. 
Try out their Pak Choi and Prawn Satay to begin. 
Go on to the Caramelized Pork Belly. It is the best pork you'll have, atleast in this city. 
From the desserts menu try out their Toffee Sesame Banana, Salted Caramel Ice cream. 

I guess some people owe me a chilled one after this.

It was a wonderful experience being here!
My daughter's 18th Birthday party.
My family enjoyed thoroughly.
Though we hadn't ordered the cake,we got one served in front of us when we were having our desserts.
Aniruddh Mukherjee was the one who had helped us throughout with our meal choices. His behaviour ,presentation and suggestions were splendid!!
Full points to him. üòäüòä
Will soon visit again!!

I have been here before and owing to the quality of both, service and food, I decided to pitch this place for a family lunch. 
We were greeted by Subhadeep and went for his suggestions. Needless to say, his suggestions turned out gold. 
Try out their Pak Choi and Prawn Satay to begin. 
Go on to the Caramelized Pork Belly. It is the best pork you'll have, atleast in this city. 
From the desserts menu try out their Toffee Sesame Banana, Salted Caramel Ice cream. 

I guess some people owe me a chilled one after this.

Starting from the quality of food to the hospitality of the staff, every bit of this experience was top notch. Visited this place with my parents on my Mom's birthday. They offered us a complimentary extra mocktail and an extra ice cream in addition to the food that we ordered. 
Mr. Subhodeep was extremely courteous and helped us make this a wonderful experience. They also served a complimentary chocolate cake on the occasion of my Mom's birthday. The ambience was classy and the food was delicious. Anything less than a 5 rating will be wrong to give.
Wish to visit this place again.

Visited Vintage Asia on Gandhi Jayanti with parents for lunch. Located in the Marriott Hotel near Science City, the interiors of the place were classy and serene. We were welcomed with some refreshing jasmine tea.
We started off with Chicken Shitake dimsum, some Fishcakes and Tom Yum soup. All the dishes were par excellence, specially the Tomyum soup with its well balanced flavours.
For the mains we had Thai Roasted Chicken, Prawn in Red Curry, Chicken Noodles and Jasmine Rice.
The delectable Prawn in Red Curry was a treat for the taste buds. We finished it off with Tender Coconut icecream and Tim Tob Krub. The later is a Thai dessert speciality and is a must-try.
The only regret is that we couldn't have any alcohol since it was a dry day :(
The staff were warm and prompt in their service specially Sudeep, who attended us that day and recommended some of the dishes.

This place is a must visit not only for food but also because of the hospitality that this place offers, I dont know much about others but Mr.Anirudh Mukherjee had been an amazing host! Food was undoubtedly good where each flavour was different! And dessert being the best ! But the cherry on the cake was the service which made it even more amazing! We were even served 3 cups of salted caramel ice-cream by Mr.mukherjee which was token of welcome from his side and for which we had not been charged!

I hope you find this feedback Mr.Mukherjee just to let you know that you have been really amazing at your job!

Had visited ‚ÄòVintage Asia‚Äô for dinner at JW Marriott's; a new Asian fine dining restaurant with my friends, one being a Vegan. Though we had many restrictions on ingredients like soya sauce, tofu, mushrooms, dairy products etc. the meal turned out to be truly discerning Chinese. 

The ambience is good, the tables were sufficiently set apart. The decor is good and the dim lighting makes for a good fine dining experience.

We look forward to our next visit to Vintage Asia.

The starter crispy prawn with wasabi sauce was awesome.But didn't like chicken in hotpot with chilly paste sauce as per recommendation from the service guy. Also wanted to have the chilli pork which wasn't available that day ,but was on the menu. Would want to see much more options on the menu .

I couldn't wait to put a review for Vintage Asia - Such a beautiful restaurant where you can spend your quality time while having your favourite delicacy. I loved the food and more than that I loved the courteous behaviour of the team - Special mention of Sudeep , Mavla and Feroz. They were extremely nice to us and caring .Kudos to this world class restaurant . Everytime I am in Kolkata, I will visit once atleast.

The most unique thing is the choice of cutlery and crockeries - I was blown. Really happy to see such detailing in making this restaurant. 

This place deserves the price they charge.

All the best to the entire team.

Astami n8...The day was my best friends 5th love anniversary day..It was a high time to celebrate in one of the precious place in the city...and for me celebration started with the food..the celebration became triple when we got a member like mr.subhodeep to help us through out...
There were so many items that we got confused hence subhadeep took that responsibility on his own...and trust me he justified our taste bud...

We had 1.orange mojito and 2.mixed fruits mojito.

Then as a starters we ordered- 1.chicken shiitake shumai,
2.deep fried chicken wings,
3.chicken bangkok grilled satay.... every thing was just awsm...
dn we had -1.BBQ chicken yongchow fried rice(recommended ,every time i took a bite of spoon full rice the satisfaction came out through a sound like "mmmmmmm"),
2.Hakka style chicken egg noodles nd
3.Chong qin style hot pot chicken bamboo shoot crispy chilly paste......
finally we had home made ice-cream(maccha ,tender coconut,sesame chocolate)..taste was lip smacking..

service was prompt..each and every food were suggested by mr.subhadeep(a staff of vintage asia)..kuddos to subhadeep...all are very friendly and cooperative..i am very much satisfied...

Ambience- perfect for candlelight dinner...and also very much comfortable..from out side to inside decoration was mind blowing..
Thank you jw marriott for ur warm hospitality...

Looking foreward to visit there very soon...

It is definitely a place if someone wants a combination of authentic Asian food and fine dinning experience . The ambience¬† is really nice and the staffs are really courteous and prompt at service.
However in may last visit during Durga Puja, the food was not that good that i have tried earlier, could have been better may be they messed up due to Puja Rush. I was wrong thinking that Marriott wont compromise with the taste of their food even though it is Puja time and irrespective of the rush. Well, i guess I Cleared my Doubts and thoughts this time :)

Went for ala carte in their chinese nd thai restaurant Vintage Asia. They welcomed us with a cup of jasmine flavoured tea which is good for the appetite. Ambience is top notch with enough space in between tables. Service wasnt an issue at all but the person serving us was a little oversmart kind of a guy. You dont get a huge choice in the menu but enough to make you happy. I dont remember the names but the prawn and pork with pineapple in the starters were the best. Maincourse had mixed fried rice, kung pao chicken nd hot pot chicken all of which had a sweet taste to it. Rice was like some sweet polau dish which was pretty disappointing. Both the chicken items were good but both of them were very sweet. This is the reason I gave them 4 oit of 5. Otherwise everything was perfect. Bill came around 10k. Will visit JW kitchen the next time.

Marriott offers you true 5star experience and the restaurant too serves the classic experience decorated with the Thai architecture fabricated with a rich ambiance. We went as part of a corporate client party and had the opportunity of tasting some cocktails at the bar. I tried mojito with white rum, as desired. Tried dimsums, some noodles , tofu, some Thai fish,etc. Since I was already done with some cocktails, wasn't much in that main course but the culinary was fine. Service was what you should expect. In all, was a fine dine for us.

Visited this place couple of days back. Its a must for food lovers. The interior is perfect with soothing illumination and great decor. The table arrangements, the cutleries, the ambiance; everything will give you that special feeling without making you uncomfortable at all. If any one wants to learn about professionalism in this industry, then please follow the staff here. ¬†
Food was awesome. The Tom Kha Soup is a must-- this is coming from some one who don't like soup at all. The Pork Xiao Long Bao was a unique experience. Its a pork dim sum with the soup inside the dim sum. The Pak Choi wrapped Chicken dim sum is equally good. It is actually cooked in the sauce. The wasabi mayo was a surprise for me. But the showstopper has to be the tenderloin in black pepper sauce. Its a must try for all beef lovers. You need to try it with steamed rice. For drinks, decided to stick to mortals and had the Tom Yum Siam. Its a Mocktail version of Tom Yum Soup. Sounds interesting?? trust me it is.¬†
After a long time came across a restaurant were I actually had a nice time. Suvadeep is the guy who served us and made some awesome recommendations. If you are being served by him then please do TAKE his advise. I guess he is also responsible for our experience as well.
Its a really must go for all fine dine lovers.
                    

Last but not the least since their kitchen was closing down and they were unable to serve any desert so they offered a complementary green tea ice-cream. Anyone going there looking for something quirky and refreshing, should ask for this one. The day ended with the traditional complementary jasmine tea from the restaurant.

Went there for the first time and loved the cozy atmosphere. The staff in there were extremely cordial and our table was taken care of by aniruddha. He was   wonderful in helping us choose our order and welcoming my 3 year old daughter who was in love with the complimentary nachoes he served. The chicken hakka noddles was simply mindblowing and the kung pao chicken was excellent. The bangkok styled chicken satay reminded me of Nasi goreng of Indonesia which I loved during our stay in Bali. The service provided by Aniruddha was simply excellent. Moreover, he arranged a birthday cake for the birthday girl for whom we actually went for dinner. We didnt inform about the birthday but Aniruddha overheard our conversation and arranged a surprise cake for her. His gesture was really appreciable. The food was good, the ambiance was great and the service was mind blowing. Surely visit another time soon.

Thankyou Vintage Asia, for making it a special evening for my parents. And a special mention to Mr. Shubhodeep, again for his excellent service and attention.

Went there for the first time and loved the cozy atmosphere. The staff in there were extremely cordial and our table was taken care of by aniruddha. He was   wonderful in helping us choose our order and welcoming my 3 year old daughter who was in love with the complimentary nachoes he served. The chicken hakka noddles was simply mindblowing and the kung pao chicken was excellent. The bangkok styled chicken satay reminded me of Nasi goreng of Indonesia which I loved during our stay in Bali. The service provided by Aniruddha was simply excellent. Moreover, he arranged a birthday cake for the birthday girl for whom we actually went for dinner. We didnt inform about the birthday but Aniruddha overheard our conversation and arranged a surprise cake for her. His gesture was really appreciable. The food was good, the ambiance was great and the service was mind blowing. Surely visit another time soon.

Simply one of the best Chinese Restaurants with authentic chinese flavours..been there for a late lunch. Started with the Jasmine tea. The hot pot chicken, the Kaum pau chicken & chicken fried wings along with the Chicken fried rice were simply outstanding. Portions were liberal and the taste...simply finger licking..

Overall a must visit if on the look out for authentic chinese cuisine.

It was just an awesome dinner I had last night 
The food was just delicious..
The starter was too much good and about main course we had mixed Chinese fried rice with lots of prawns chicken and scrambled eggs...we took Kung pao chicken which was something I can't forget the taste , is still on my mouth ...it's a mouthwatering experience...well thanks to JW vintage Asia and special thanks to ANIRUDDHA who looked after us so nicely and made our date successful..he was so pampering us with his behaviours and one best thing I experienced was mr Aniruddha was explaining all the dishes while he was serving it to us ...
One last thing I would like to share is I went with my better half ,it was her birthday..I some how managed to go to mr Aniruddha and ask him to offer her a birthday cake ..I was about to say it to mr Aniruddha about it he just said 'yeah cake?? Birthday or anniversary' I was like how do you know ?? That was nice of him , last we shared a bite with him too .. Thanks for all of the above..

After quite a few years, (in fact I am not sure if it actually was my first time!) I had such high quality Asian food. And thanks to Chef Abhishek (who took the initiative of preparing all the delectable foods for us), Aniruddha, Subhadip, Farhana and all the others who attended us on the 28th August night, the experience probably scaled the heights that it reached. The food definitely was great. But, the treatment that we received, was EXTRAORDINARY. Vintage Asia probably has been doing so well for this reason. A lot of restaurants offer superb delicacies. But not 1/8 of them make their guests feel so good. I have no words to express the quality of service and treatment that we received. It was a quiet dinner with my parents (on my dad's birthday), and the way everything took place during those 1.5 hours was utterly blissful. Thank you so much Vintage Asia. Please don't lose these people! They are your primary weapons to compete against the rest and the most valuable assets for a great future!

Firstly, the ambience of the place is what you'd expect from a five star hotel. The restaurant has a dark hues which adds to the feel of the place.
We tried a lot of dishes, but I'll only talk about the dishes which I loved. The Jasmine tea was actually nice and soothing. The fried prawn served with wasabi mayo is definitely to die for. It amazing! Next I'd suggest you try the barbecued chicken and the dim sums, it's easy on the tastebuds and tasty. The chicken satay was good but the taste can be improved. 
The virgin pina colada was a downer, not good but the virgin mojito was refreshing. 
For dessert, we had ice creams, there was a chocolate sesame one and a vanilla one, I'd suggest to go for the latter.
The service was really amazing! Really great staff.

Picked this one for a family dinner on my birthday. I was a bit wary of the cuisine, as I'm more of a continental food buff, while my mum's mostly vegetarian, but it turned out to be a rather pleasant surprise.

There seemed to be plenty of quality options, if one's tastes are not particularly meat oriented. It helped that the staff is knowledgable and courteous: we were served by Subhadip and Mavela, and I'm sure it's the service that'll get me to drop in there again, whenever I'm in town. 

The food was excellent. Starters ordered included chicken, prawn and asparagus water chestnut dumplings (which my mum seemed to really like - kudos). For the main course, we decided to go with chicken and fish- this time we were recommended a red snapper dish, which went down well. I have an especially sensitive nose for fishy smells, and was glad this one had few issues on that front. Along with the main course, we went for a bottle of wine, which complemented the food well. 
The desserts were pretty good, too: I enjoyed the br√ªl√©e. 

The night ended on a happy note, with them arranging for a cake for me. An evening well spent, and I'd definitely recommend this place strongly!

This place had been long overdue and finally visited last month. I must say the aesthetic of this place is amazing, the interior work , the lighting is all very pleasant and pleasing. The main attraction the perfect table set up along with warm service. The ambience is perfect. Now coming to the food we tried the Dimsums with Fried Prawns, the flavours & taste were clean and sharp. The Main course, Egg Noodles along with Sichuan Fried Chicken with mountain dried chillies was just perfect. Watching me cough a couple of times, a hot cocktail was offered to me by Dweep (had to remember his name for the most exceptional service I have got till date in any star category hotel) which helped me to get rid of my sore throat & enjoy the wonderful meal. Value for money, over all I would definitely recommend this place for the food, ambience & exceptional service.

Visited Vintage Asia last night this being my second visit to the restaurant. Excellent food, wonderful cocktails, fabulous ambience, fantastic service! Loved every bit of the dinner. The dimsums are excellent, and so are the crispy fried prawns with wasabi mayo. The favourite dessert will always be Tub tim krob, but also loved mango coconut cream brulee palm sugar caramel & sesame tuile. Overall loved the place and highly recommend it for asian food. Ipsita and Sudeep need special mention and thanks for being extremely helpful and taking care of us so well.

Vintage Asia serves amazing oriental cuisine I must say. The ambience is very elegant. The staff was very courteous especially Dweep who deserves a special mention. The food was wonderful, the Thai curry. I only took away the 0.5 rating because when  I had made a call to the property to make a reservation there wasn't anyone on the other side to receive my call. And it's not just once I had called.

Vintage Asia was our chosen place for my husband's birthday dinner. Marriott has become our second home, we love their Kitchen, Gold, and now this place. Being food bloggers, we are always on our toes in sampling food from various places. Vintage has been on my wishlist for quite some time now. Had pre-booked a table using the table booking app, and it worked wonderfully. In fact, we received calls, reminding us about the booking. The place was quite full by the time we reached. On being seated, we were presented with crackers, a sweet salad, and jasmine tea. The tea aides in digestion, and was quite fragrant.
On the food part, we had Aniruddha help us out. Opted for the Pok Choy Chicken Dimsums, and their famous Satay with the Peanut Sauce. The satay took some time to come, but was excellent. The dimsums - have become their fan!!! Such good taste, yet missed having more.
From the main course, we opted for their Pork Belly, and Burnt Garlic Fried Rice. The pork belly was just astounding!! There was a lot of meat, and sliced - very convenient to eat. However, the sweetness was too much for my liking. The rice was flavorful, and paired well with the meat.
We had opted for a beer with our meal. The cake was complimentary from their side, and it was good as always! The tender coconut ice-cream was also a gift from the restaurant, and we thoroughly enjoyed it.

First of all, a very big thanks to Dweep for his amazing service. People like you make me want to visit Marriott time and again. Your suggestions was spot on.

The ambience is really good. They offer candlelight dinner experience. There wasn't any music but that offered an opportunity to soak in the ambience. Dim lights. Wonderful ceiling. The list goes on and on.

First on offer was Jasmine Tea which was complimentary.

We ordered Pak Choice Dumpling. It was totally out of the world. Haven't come across anything like that before. 

Next we ordered Chicken Satay, Chicken Green Curry with Basmati Rice. Everything was top class. The Green Curry was right up there among the best available in Kolkata.

As I have already mentioned, service was prompt and courteous.

All in all, a fantastic experience. I would rate it higher than Pan Asian considering the price and the quality of food.

Chinese Dumplings and Chicken teriyaki with Long Island Ice Tea or Blue Dragon Cocktail is superb.
Kung Phao Chicken and the Chicken Satay ,as i took it for main course ,was truly delightful.
Also there is a Prawn starter that is delicious(i can hardly remember the name) 

Valet Service, Warm Welcome with a namaste and the security also adds to the esteem of J.W Marriott chain of Hotels and Restaurants.

Will come again soon...

One of the finest restaurants in Kolkata. A must visit for those @who love luxury and Asian food. We ordered all varieties of v0eg dumplings. They were amazing. The chilli potatoes were decent and the spring rolls were yummy. For the mains, we ordered Thai green curry, burnt garlic fried rice , padh Thai noodles and water chestnut with asparagus. For dessert the tender coconut ice cream and banana with caramel ice cream. The food was out of the world. Special thanks to Shubodeep and Anirudh for the great service and recommendations.

First about the bad experience. I called on Sunday (9th July) to make a reservation for Thursday (13th July) and I was told that the reservation has been made and they even took my name and contact number. But when I went on Thursday, they checked with both my name and contact number, but couldn't find any reservation, so I was quite irritated with the situation. They did get us seated but obviously this was a bad experience for me.

Now about the good experience. The food that we ordered were very tasty and delicious. The service was prompt and the staff were very courteous. I also liked the open kitchen plan.

I went to Vintage Asia last night with my colleagues. Nice ambience and pleasing decor. 
The started our meal with crispy potato, chicken sataye and fried prawn. It was really good. Especially the dips which come along the starters were awesome the wasabi mayo and the peanut dip. 
Well I was not sure about what to have for mains coarse, so I left the decision on to my server. He suggested the caramelized pork belly with burnt garlic rice, mix wok noodles with hot pot chicken and asparagus waterchestnut with burnt garlic rice for my one of my colleague who was vegetarian. 
 I just loved the burnt garlic sticky rice. It had an excellent aroma of burnt garlic. The pork belly was just exceptional. It looked like a piece of brownie topped with chocolate sauce. It tasted just awesome. It kind of melted in my mouth, and the burnt garlic rice just enhanced the flavour. The best pork belly I ever had till now.
  The noodles and hot pot chicken were equally good. We really enjoyed our.
A big cheers to vintage Asia and it's staff, especially raj for suggested such delicious dishes.. He took a good care of us throughout the evening. Gave us some excellent recommendations with the food
Will surely visit again.

Amazing place... be it food..service... ambience... everything is super classy and great. Surely one of the best Oriental restaurants in kolkata.
My college buddy Chef Guha being the head chef there, was an advantage, didnt have to go through the tedious job of selecting dishes from the menu... everything was pre selected. 
Starters included  Prawn dimdums, Pak choi wrapped chicken with lotus root, Chicken Satay, Crispy soft shell Crab with 7 spices salt. The pak choi and crabs are a Must Try.
Mains were Sichuan Fried chicken, Spiced Caramelized Pork belly, King prawns in X.O. Sauce accompanied by Chicken and egg noodles and sichuan flavoured spicy Fried rice. 
Each and every dish was supppper yumm delicious and must try...
Were too full to try any desserts.
Being my parents anniversary they got us a complimentary Chocolate cake... it was so sinfully tasty topped with Berry Macaroon, tempered choco shards and cute heart shaped white chocolates.

The Staff needs a special mention. Extremely courteous.. hospitable and helpful. Dweep, Subhodeep and Ipsita deserve special mention...kudos to their efforts. 

Planning for more revisits very soon.

Absolutely delicious food! Had the pleasure of dining here on my Parents' Marriage Anniversary. Couldn't be more impressed. Extremely courteous staff, eye-pleasing ambience and swift service.
We tried the Prawn dimsum, Pak Choi Wrapped Chicken with Lotus Root, Bangkok Chicken Satay, and Crispy Fried Soft-Shell Crab with Homemade 7 Spices Salt, for starters. Each and every dish was really delicious. My favourites were the Pak Choi Chicken and the Crab.
For main course, we had the Sichuan Fried Chicken, Spiced Caramelized Pork Belly, King Prawn in Xo Sauce, and, Chicken and Egg Noodles. The pork belly was a little too sweet, but it went really well with the noodles. The prawn was the best crustacean dish I'd ever tried! The chicken was a perfect light accompaniment with the other rich saucy dishes.

Since it was my parents' anniversary, they served us a chocolate cake, which was enough as a dessert for us. It was really delicious! It came with a berry flavoured Macaroon and Tempered Chocolate shards. Sinfully pleasing!

As a New Jersey native who is in love with Asian cuisine, I can rightfully say that this was the best Asian restaurant I have ever been to. Atmosphere is absolutely wonderful, being on the second floor of a 5-star hotel. Don't even get me started on the service at this fine establishment. The staff continuously make suggestions as to what sauces would go best with the dish you choose. Personally, I reccomend the "sweet chili paste" if you are looking for a nice hint of spice. The food is also wonderful. I found the broth of the Pork Xiao Long Bao to be slightly bland, but my waiter, Sudeep, suggested a blend of soy sauce and vinegar that perfectly complemented the dish. From the selection of items on the menu, to the top-notch service and customer care, I rate Vintage Asia in Kolkata an 11 out of 10. Overall an unforgettable experience.

Well, I am pretty excited to write about this awesome restaurant at JW Marriott Kolkata- Vintage Asia!! 

First of all, I should mention about the service here.. it's strikingly impressive! Thanks to Ipshita üëç who made my birthday evening on 6th July even more special with her warm and benevolent service throughout üòÉ She was very professional and did an outstanding job in helping us order the food! 

The ambience of this place is mesmerizing!! With perfect interior lighting and candlelight on each table, it immediately brightened me up. Interiors are quite interestingly designed which I felt was aesthetically very pleasant to the eyes. In short, I loved the decor of this place! 

Coming to the food, we ordered Tom Yum veg soup which was medium spicy and had all sorts of veggies and mushroom. To me it was quite flavorsome! 
As I did quite a bit research about this restaurant before, so I went for their  Pork belly dish which was caramelized and tasted little more sweeter than I expected. Nevertheless, it was mouth watering as the meat was properly cooked. Next we went for their Beef tenderloin dish and it was scrumptious! It was super soft and vegetables were mixed well. 
Ipshita suggested we take burnt garlic rice as it would go well with both the main courses and it really  did! 
We were so full after that we couldn't order any dessert, though I wanted to taste their tender coconut ice cream üç®. Never mind, I'll definitely visit this restaurant again to try their other dishes and desserts. 
After our meal, I was greeted with a yummy birthday cake by Ipshita üçÆ This was quite a surprise as I wasn't expecting this at all üòäüòä but thanks to the Vintage Asia chef team and Ipshita for making my bday a memorable one üëç‚úåüíúüòç

Excellent food and service! Ambience is perfect. I often complain about dim lighting at fine dining restaurants but that isn't the case here. The chives and chiu chow dumplings and the Papaya salad are a must have, so is their signature homemade coconut ice cream. Shoutout to Anirudh and Subhadeep who serve my table each time I'm here. They're extremely attentive yet never intrusive, and their suggestions from the menu never disappoint. Overall a great experience and you get every bang for your buck.

Just drop in today for lunch at Vintage Asia with my friend. The menu was a bit confusing as the had only one  menu for thai and Chinese. I wouldn't decide wat to order. But our server Raj guided us very well. He helped us with the menu. We order asparagus and waterchestnut dim sum as suggested by our server, which was really good. Their  homemade dips are die for. Jasmine tea was on the house and something I have never seen before. 
For the mains we order shimeji mushroom and wok fresh noodles, which was just excellent starting from the aroma taste and everything. Best place to look for authentic cantonese food.
It's was a good experience and great hospitality by our server.
Will surely be back..
Cheers to Vintage Asia team.

We were hosted by Dweep and Aniruddha. Their service was very good. They recommended us drinks and dishes which were not on the menu and they turned out to be very good. The wok tossed mushroom in particular was outstanding.

Probably the best ever food (and restaurant) in Kolkata.

We've dined at some of the best Asian restaurants across the world ‚Äì Los Angeles, London, Hong Kong, Singapore, Toronto, San Francisco, Dubai, and of course, Kolkata. And after a rather long hard look at our experience, Vintage Asia ranks right up there in the Top 5 in the world (and I mean Michelin star places, top gastropubs, and impossible to get into places like Zuma in Dubai included). Hands down. Because of the food. Awesome. And more so, the service, which was world standard, no, gold standard anywhere. And a bit of ambiance and the rest of it thrown in. Overall? Magic.

We booked a table for five for a special occasion ‚Äì my father in law's 75th birthday. And, in deed, Vintage Asia did make it special. We don't live in Kolkata, so this is an expat opinion...

The place/ambiance: The hotel is so Dubai, or let's say, Florida, or Sao Paulo, or anywhere. Glitzy, glam, typical JWM. (The JWM Marquis in Dubai is a lot less glam, and there's nothing wrong with that. And the JWM in Hong Kong is just right. The way a good flagship should be). JWM Kolkata seemed a bit over the top I would say... But I guess they're targeting a certain audience... 

The restaurant is quiet, sophisticated, almost understated, compared to the bright outside. So, yes, rather a welcoming place. Tables nicely set apart, a feeling of privacy, rather good.

We started with:
A couple of orders each of Har Gow and Chicken Shitake Shumai. We did want the Pak Choi wrapped chicken but were told the chef was advising against it for that night (didn't understand why, though?). Anyways, the Har Gow shrimp dumpling was simply fantastic. A tasty morsel of wonderfully flavored shrimp in a soft, translucent wrapper.

The Chicken Shumai (worldwide it is called Shiu Mai) was also very good. The soft and tender chicken with the melt in your mouth mushroom was amazing. Looking back over our dinner, perhaps, we should have had more dimsums‚Ä¶

The dim-sums come with four different dips or sauces ‚Äì each one different, each one memorable and amazingly tasty. We hung on to those for throughout our meal.

For mains we had:
Gai young ‚Äì roast chicken from northern Thailand. This was really nice tender bbq chicken dish, mildly spiced, with hints of basil, coriander and more. Gai Young ir originally thai street food, but here at Vintage Asia, they took it to another level.

Maps tofu: is tofu with young corn, celery, and flavored with peppercorn ‚Äì was OK, an energetic attempt at making tofu seem interesting. The tofu was set in a nice little curry of sorts, and made tangy, mildly spicy and quite delicious. Great dish for vegetarians.

The chilly prawn: cantonese butter milk prawn, with birds eye chili, and laced with the energy of curry leaf was outstanding. Large, luscious, lovely to look at, this was a seductive dish that stood apart and led the way. If you like prawns, do order this. This was recommended by Suvankar, and we appreciate his word on this.
We had our mains with Wok tossed noodles with carrots, beans, and spring onion. Ordinary sounding anywhere else. Nicely above the rest here. Lightly tossed, beautifully flavoured, the mix was perfect.
And the 'Burnt garlic spring onion' fried rice? Magic. Hard to describe, this fried rice was a perfect companion to the rest of the meal. The rice was done perfect, and the burnt garlic added a zing to it.

Finally ‚Äì the Pork belly - spiced, caramelised, with pineapple, crispy garlic. Dozens of people have praised the pork belly dish at Asia Vintage as the best they‚Äôve had, the best in all of India etc. This was our weakest link. It was too sweet, too clawing, too trying to please every one, and sadly, not 'trimmed' enough ‚Äì meaning, more fat, almost than meat. Don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äì the pork was cooked to a goodness that is rare, but it got killed by sugar, like a poor diabetes patient. We liked it, ¬†the quality of the cooking, the base spices, the texture was great. Except for the overdose of sugar. For us, for me, this was a bit of a let down, particularly, after I had read dozens of hugely positive reviews. But perhaps, having lived outside Calcutta for so many years, I have lost my rosogolla tooth.

And the tea, throughout the meal, is just a nice accompaniment, washing down the separate flavors, clearing the way for the next wonderful surprise.

The service was fantastic. I mean, really, fantastic. Aniruddha and Suvankar take a bow. You guys rocked, and Aniruddha, do come back for an encore round of cheers. The tea guy? Cool. Everyone else, including the people who welcome and usher you in, every one ‚Äì just fantastic. I‚Äôd go back there just to see that quality of smooth jazz-like service unfold before our eyes and transport us to a wonderful place yet again. If I would give a 5/5 for food, surely, Zomato, let‚Äôs do a 7/5 or like a 150% for service!

The restaurant team were kind enough to bring out a special cake for my father in law's 75th, and what was even more wonderful was that how guests from neighboring tables came over to wish him. Overall, it just made his day!

If you do imbibe, this food goes rather well with a very chilled beer. And they do have that handy.

Vintage Asia isn‚Äôt cheap at all. But worth every penny, cent or paisa. Or HK$. Their menu on Zomato, for example, has no prices, is poor on describing the food, but these are rather small niggles.¬†

Go there. If you live in Kolkata, it‚Äôs your chance to experience one of the best restaurants in the world without buying a ticket on Emirates. Three, no, four out of five of us said it was the best ever restaurant meal they've had in Kolakata. Ever. And these folks are rather well experienced at the top places anywhere.

If you are visiting, do try it. It‚Äôs world class food. The resentations are great, the atmosphere dignified, and If you just want to see for yourself how amazing food+fantastic service = absolute magic, grab a reservation now. And grab a first class experience at Vintage Asia. Like a good vintage of wine, Vintage Asia is a treasure in the city of joy.

Well, one word - disappointed. The service was really poor compared to other hotels, the service was really slow. Foodwise it was okay, not too great, some items were excellent though. The dimsum at the start was excellent, the couple of prawn items were also very nice. But, The fried prawn with wayasabi mayo, did not find the taste authentic, may be tailored to suit bengalis. Also, the red snapper was too hot. Also, the serving people Subhadeep and Aniruddha, they were instructing too much what to eat and what not, that really restricted our choice of foods (really hated this part, they should be their to help you out, but not to instruct). Not a great experience overall.

Well, one word - disappointed. The service was really poor compared to other hotels, the service was really slow. Foodwise it was okay, not too great, some items were excellent though. The dimsum at the start was excellent, the couple of prawn items were also very nice. But, The fried prawn with wayasabi mayo, did not find the taste authentic, may be tailored to suit bengalis. Also, the red snapper was too hot. Also, the serving people Subhadeep and Aniruddha, they were instructing too much what to eat and what not, that really restricted our choice of foods (really hated this part, they should be their to help you out, but not to instruct). Not a great experience overall.

Visited this restaurant last week to celebrate the receipt of my first paycheck. The grand ambience and feel of the place is very apt for a 5 star location. Though quite expensive, it is one of the finest restaurants serving authentic Asian cuisine. We started with Pak Choi Wrapped Chicken Dumplings and Crispy Fried Prawn with Wasabi Mayo. The prawns were amazing and the dumplings were plated nicely and had a taste very different from anything I have had before. For main course, we ordered Chong Qin Wrapped Red Snapper and Yong Chow bbq chicken fried rice. The snapper dish was delectable and went really went with the rice. To end with something sweet, we were asked to try their special homemade ice cream with tender coconut, which was lovely, with actual pieces of tender coconut.
Thumbs up for the service. Subhadeep was very helpful throughout and took pains to suggest the best dishes according to our tastes.

Vintage Asia restaurant at JW Marriott is the new addition to the Chinese and Thai cuisine scene in Kolkata.Located at the first floor, this new addition has a great decor with freshness written all over.While the veg choices are limited we had a great time thanks to their courteous staff who helped in choosing their best veg dishes and even preparing some out of the menu dishes to make our lunch a great gastronomy experience.
We had dumplings with asparagus,water chestnuts and mushrooms which were one of the best we have had yet, though the quantity was very limited.Then we had Green Papaya salad as another starter.For the main course Burnt garlic ginger rice accompanied by spicy vegetable with broccoli,water chestnuts and other veggies and Pad Thai noodles made for a great eat.The best part was their moctails with mild exotic flavors one being Tum Yum Siam having thai red chilli,galangal and lemongrass was really out of the world.
Overall a great experience with a pocketpinch of around 500 per item.

Visited this restaurant yesterday with my mom. The look of the restaurant as well as the ambiance is very pleasing. The seating arrangement is also very comfortable and spacious. Every table has its privacy even on a crowded Sunday evening.

We were given complimentary Jasmine tea,a fruit pickle and fried wantons with some dips to nibble on whilst waiting for our food (which were all delicious by the way).

Coming to the food,we ordered Tom yum soup,for main course we had Phad Thai and Gai Yang. I being a Thai food lover,Tom yum soup and Phad Thai is something I eat frequently and I have to say this was the best I ever had. The soup was packed with subtle yet very distinguishable flavors,every spoonful of it was an experience. The Phad Thai was delectable,I just couldn't get enough of the beautiful flavors that this dish offered. Gai yang was suggested to me at the restaurant as something that will complement Phad Thai and indeed it delivered. The roasted chicken was juicy,had a  smokey flavor to it and the accompanying tamarind sauce is just delish.
Every dish was enchanting.

We also ordered two mocktails,the lemon blueberry and the Tom Yum Siam,and they were absolutely lip smacking.

A big shout-out to Subhadeep and Aniruddha who took really good care of us there,especially Subhadeep who gave us recommendations on the food and drinks  and also a little background on them as well. He told us that their restaurant boasts of chefs brought from different parts of the world including a Michelin star chef. Plus he didn't charge us for the drinks,he picked it up as it was our first time visit there. I wanted to thank him and Aniruddha for the excellent experience we had yesterday and I hope they will keep it up :)
Overall I just loved this restaurant,can't wait to go back soon!

Probably the best Asian food experience in Kolkata at present. Loved the food, ambience, presentation and the warmth of the team. Every moment was truly enjoyable and an experience which will force me to come back soon.

The evening was made memorable, thanks to Dweep and Anirudh. They served us with such enthusiasm. They were excellent.

I was also quite surprised with the bill. Its extremely reasonable when compared to any other fine dining Asian restaurant in the city. Look forward to dine again soon.

Visited on 2.6.17 for dinner- We ordered Gai Yang, Kung Pao chicken, stir fried crispy bay of Bengal Bhetki for starters and mixed fried rice and chicken pot for main course.
Honestly their quantity is good and we were so full by the end of the meal that we didn't have any space left for dessert. But when we were paying for the food they gave us complimentary ice cream. They said it is house special. Initially we thought that they gave a scoop of vanilla ice cream but when I tasted it, it was something I didn't expect. It was tender coconut ice cream. And I immediately remembered that I did see it in the menu. Every time you put a small portion of ice cream in your mouth you are sure to find chunks of tender coconut. And the ice cream itself  is so creamy and refreshing too, somehow like a sorbet. This ice cream that we didnt pay for was probably the most unique thing i tasted.
The Gai Yang too was different, the chicken was soft and succulent. The way it  was served was different too. The smokiness added to the flavour. The kung Pao chicken and the fish was nothing special but well cooked. The rice was quite spicy and don't expect it to be a light fried rice that compliments spicy side dishes. The chicken in the pot was okayish.
I would have given full points but a slight lack in service made me deduct 0.5; we ordered two rounds of fresh lime soda and both times we had to remind them several times to Serve us our drinks before our meal ends. There wasn't much crowd either. The staff is otherwise very well behaved and polite.

We walked up to JW Marriott without a booking on a Sunday evening, and as expected, had a huge waiting list in front of us for the JW Kitchen. So we tried out Vintage Asia, and we had a marvellous time there!

We had Subhadeep looking after our table, and I'd really extend my heartiest gratitude to him for taking care of us so well and giving UA the right suggestions.

To start off with, just the right ambience for a family dinner as well as a romantic dine-out. We loved the Jasmine tea servings to start the meal.

We took the Crispy fried prawns, and the Chicken Satay for starters. We loved the mildly fried, sesame-coated goodness of the prawns dipped in the ingeniously crafted Wasabi Mayo, and the chicken was a classic home-run.

Choosing the Pork Belly in the mains was the best decision of our evening, and the chicken hot pot was a wholesome second choice.

To bring matters to an end, Subhadeep suggested the Alphonso cr√®me brule√©, which was a smash hit with us.

I'm sure we'll be returning here soon again for another lovely meal.

Good flavours on very good ingredients. The pork belly with pineapple and the morning glory were standouts. The service is also courteous and perhaps a little invasive, but that is expected of a new and enthusiastic establishment. 
The ambiance and vibe complement what will be a good meal. I would recommend this place for anyone who wants to spend about 2,000 rupees a head(drinks would raise this price level) on some well crafted Chinese and Thai food.

Not really a great restaurant. According to them, they specialize in thai and chinese. However after tasting the items, I did not find anything special. We had ordered for pork, prawn and chicken dimsums, fish cakes and 2-3 more items in the starters. However except for fish cake, there was nothing more thats worth mentioning. In the main course, we ordered lamb, cashew chicken along with items like egg chicken noodles and prawn fried rice. None of the items were well prepared except for the cashew chicken (which they gave some Chinese name). 
Decor was good. Service was ok. My entire rating goes for decor and service only.

On the coveted evening of Bengali new year we headed for witnessing newest fine dining experience by one of the global leaders in hospitality industry.
Getting the table was a breeze as was pre-booked. Restaurant was very busy so getting attention of servers was a challenge. The cutlery on table was unique on its own way.

We started the proceedings high with no spirit. Ordered a glass of Lemon Blueberry and Mint Basil Chayean. The drinks were refreshing and one can feel burst of taste for each and every ingredients in it. However the experience got marred with poor air-conditioning.

Without wasting much time we moved towards main course. Ask for the day was Prawn Fried Rice with XO sauce with Chong Qin style Hot Pot Chicken. The taste was great for both the dishes, a must try once you venture there.

Understanding our discomfort due to poor air-conditioning the server himself took the final call of Tender Coconut homemade Ice Cream on our behalf. Was on the house! A master stroke in an attempt to get the smile back on our face.

It will be needless to say that food was pricey but what amazed me the level of professionalism about servers and their relentless effort to ensure one leave premises with a grin on their face.

We went to enjoy a lazy sunday lunch today and really had a great time. We were served by Subhadeep and Aniruddha and they were very helpful with their suggestions and service. We ordered Chives Chiu Chow and Pak Choi Wrapped Chicken Dimsum, both of which were great. For our main course we opted for Wild Mushroom & Shimeji Mushroom, Chong Qin Style Hot Pot Chicken, Spiced Caramalised Pork Belly(although highly popularised, it did not tantalize our taste buds to the same extent as we found it to be slightly over sweet and salty), Wok Tossed Fresh Noodles & Prawn Fried Rice with XO Sauce. All the dishes were very nicely presented and the taste was highly flavour full. Wok Tossed Noodles was a revelation. Inspite of being too full with the main course, we couldn't help but order three deserts - the Mango Coconut Creme Brulee(this was excellent), Sesame Chocolate & Tender Coconut homemade icecream(this was also extremely good). We would definitely visit again perhaps for dinner as it was highly recommended by our delightful host Subhadeep.

It had long been in my wishlist and we finally decided to visit the place for a dinner on my birthday. The place is on the first floor of the JW Marriott and it offers an fine Asian dining experience amidst beautiful decor. 

The place is neatly done and the service is top notch. Staff behavior is extremely courteous and very warm.  Coming to the food we had ordered the crispy fried soft shell crab and spiced caramelized pork belly. The crab was tasty and spicy and managed to elevate the taste buds. The pork belly was hands down the best I have had in Kolkata and will surely make you crave for more. A must have if you are looking for the most amazing pork in the city. We had also ordered Tom yum Siam mock tail to go along. Given the highly courteous staff they have,  they offered us a complimentary drink and also some burnt garlic rice to have with the pork belly. A very nice and kind gesture from their part. 

We finished the meal with mango coconut cream brulee for desert which was also very rich and gave the perfect end to a beautiful meal. Prices are a little on the higher side. But given the fine dining it promises I am sure you will not complaint much. Overall a very nice experience. Will surely recommend.

We visited vintage asia on bengali new year's evening , which happens to be my birthday for dinner. The best thing about this restaurant is the service , the two guys Subhadeep and Aniruddha pampered us throughout our course of dining , from suggesting our orders to serving them and taking feedback about the food , these guys deserve a big applause for putting in their efforts.
We started with PAKCHOI WRAPPED CHICKEN DUMPLING and CHICKEN SATAY with complimentary servings of jasmine tea . Both tasted good enough , but what i liked more was the presentation of Satay on a portable mini grill and the steamed dumplings in a wooden box. The maincourse comprised KUNG PAO CHICKEN , a very spicy preparation , so faint hearted people need to convey their preferences before ordering this , along with CHICKEN PHAD THAI NOODLES , at this point i felt the food could have been more authentic , less oily , with stronger flavour of peanuts in the noodles. If critically rated the food scores a 4/5.
For drinks , my friend took a pint of beer and i opted for THE BEE AND THE MONK , now this concotion was something‚Äã i never tried before , the best mixture of vodka ,triple sec , honey and turmeric as far as i remember , a cocktail i would heartily recommend.

I was complimented with a birthday cake at the end of the meal and i was so touched ! Thank you for the entire experience , and making my special day even more memorable :)

Chinese food prepared with intricate care. Failing to reserve seats at JW kitchen on Bengali New Year, we made our reservation here and I haven't regretted my decision for once. We were guided and served by Dweep, who catered to all our needs and helped us to choose food which suited our palates. We were served a complimentary welcome drink by him. It was probably made with tangerine and lemon grass and the moment we took a sip we got confirmed that this place is a gem. We took two dimsums-one veg and one prawn. Each of them tasted heavenly! Then a customised veg fried rice was prepared for us according to our specifications accompaning a chicken hot pot with bamboo shoot. Both of them amazing and best of their kind. The mango coconut creme brulee was a nice though nothing too extraordinary. The portions are good enough for two people. I'll definitely visit again to try a few more of their dimsums.
Vintage Asia, thank you for the amazing evening I had spent!

Celebrated our anniversary on the 19th April at this place. We were altogether 13 of us and all were vegetarian. We ordered 2 varieties of dim sum and crispy potatoes for starters. They were too good especially the dimsums. For mocktails everybody has there own preferences and whoever did not liked there drinks , were been changed immediately. For main course we had burnt garlic rice which I should say is a must have, phad Thai noodles which was good but lacked peanuts and was a bit saucy than usual. The green curry and rice was also too good. Overall an awesome experience.

Visited this place with boyfriend for a weekend lunch last week. It was in my list of "places I have to visit for food very soon" list for long. So I was actually very eager about they experience. 
Ambience- The interior is simple and neat. There is ample sunlight coming in and this natural light brings a beautiful, fresh feel inside. There are long tables for family or friends group visiting the place. However you may choose a corner table if you want a peaceful time with your date. We took a table infront of the kitchen and I could see the glimpses of magic being created there. 
Stuffs- The stuffs are friendly, well-behaved and knows about the food. I strongly believe that a restaurant's reputation depends a lot on the stuffs and it will get a 5/5 for that. They will suggest the best dishes, tell you about it and make you feel at home all the time. 
Food- If you love oriental cuisine, you should visit this place at least once. You may not like this place if you are a fan of kolkata styled Chinese good with thick cornflour gravy. But you will get the true feel of oriental food here. It's fresh, it's natural, it's light and it tastes awesome.

For soup we went for the chicken wonton in superior broth. This is officially my favorite soup now. It's a clear soup with wontons, mushrooms and lot of fresh vegetables. The aroma is mind blowing. The fresh taste is because of the vegetables and mushroom. It is mild and will definitely boost your appetite.
 We chose two dimsum varieties- the prawn chive dimsum and pork bao dimsum. The steaming dimsums will surely give you foodgasms. The pork dimsums are soft and it's better if you have it in one go. The filling inside is soft and juicy and it may leak out if you bite into it. The prawn one is again completely different from anything I have had till date. The outer coating is green in colour and the stuffing is made of fresh and NOT OVERCOOKED prawn. If you are a prawn-lover (like me) you will go back there for this one.
For the main course we went for bbq chicken fried rice. It tastes like a simple fried rice with bbq-eked chicken. Nothing extraordinary about it. You can opt for this if you want to enjoy the flavors of the side dish. We ordered the caramelized pork belly with it and it was a love at first sight (and bite). The chunks of pork meat and fat looked succulent and actually melted in mouth. But as it is caramelized and cooked in pineapple juice it may become too sweet for you. Have it along with rice or noodles to balance out the sweetness.
We ordered lemon-blueberry for mock tails. It is actually refreshing and balances out the flavors well.
Lastly for desserts we opted for Tib tim krob. This is another great option if you want something other than the regular chocolate, cheese desserts. The pieces of water chestnut floating in the mild, not too sweet coconut cream looks heavenly, tastes heavenly and will not feel heavy after a  sumptuous meal. 

All over, the experience is amazing. However, the price is a little too much compared to the amount. But considering its 5 star status you cannot really complain. 
I will definitely visit this place again.

It is a perfect place to spend quality time with your friends and family over some quality food. The ambience is impressive and the staff were very well behaved and courteous. A special thanks to Subhadeep for recommending us such lovely dishes.

For starters we ordered Pak choi wrapped chicken. It was absolutely delicious. I couldn't resist ordering the fish cakes which turned out to be very generous in quantity. It tasted heavenly. We were pretty much full after having the starters so Subhadeep recommended us to go for the lamb chops for the main course. It was soft and scrumptious. We were offered a complimentary mocktail along with it.

For dessert we ordered the mango coconut creme brulee. The brulee made our night. It completely stole the show. However, I would like to thank the concerned people for serving a complimentary cake in the end as a thank you for choosing their restaurant for celebrating my birthday. It was a lovely experience and I'm looking forward to try more items.

The second best thing about the Vintage Asia restaurant at the J W Marriot Hotel is their decor.¬† Restrained with a quiet elegance and without the startling red which is almost mandatory in a South Asian Eatery.¬† There was enough space to display the Chinese antique tea pots and other artefacts. 

The best thing, of course, was the food.¬† One is so done with soya or lemon grass and MSG laden dishes which are offered at most Chinese or Thai restaruants that it was a relief to taste the natural flavours of the ingredients.¬† We had the wonton soup which were tiny golden dumplings swimming among bright green vegetables,¬† in a delicious broth with so many hidden layers of flavour, that each mouthfull was a discovery.¬† 

The dim sum was just that¬† ...what your heart desires,. ¬†¬† some with chopped lotus root, others with chicken or shrimps but all with sublety of taste.¬† The soft shell crabs, crisp on the outside and succulent inside was something not on offer in any similar outlet in this city, so if you are a fan of this delicious crustacean..then go get some st this place.

What impressed me most was the consistency of the fried rice.¬† It is not meant to be a pulao with each grain separate from the other.¬† ThIs rice is meant to be eaten with chopsticks and the Chef got it so right. It was just sticky enough to hold together and easy to pick up with the chopsticks.¬† Which is something I havent experienced in a Kolkata restaurant before. Bravo Chef.¬† 

But the pork belly was the winner ! the best I have eaten in my long and well fed life.¬† It had just the right amount of fat to render the flesh juicy and was packed weith flsavours of¬† star anise, sweet soy, schezwan pepper and other magical spices.¬† Each bite was an explosion of¬† surprising flavours that left you both bemused and satisfied. 
I take my topi off to Chef Tan and Chef Abhishek . for serving one of the best Asian meals I have had recently. ¬† ,

ITI MISRA.

I was there at Vintage Asia for my wife's birthday celebration dinner. Had an amazing experience with the food. The pork dimsum was amazing, very juicy and succulent. The chef's speciality preparation "gai Yang " was suggested to us and we do not regret our choice. The wok fried beef tenderloin and the Cantonese buttered milk prawn was great as a main course along with steam jasmine rice and wok tossed fresh noodles with carrot, beans as the side. Apart from the delicious food, the great hospitality and suggestions of Sudeep made our evening a great experience.. a beautiful cake was given from Jw Marriott's side.. it was indeed a great choice to celebrate an occasion at the vintage Asia.

Vintage Asia in JW Marriott is an amazing restaurant for authentic Chinese lovers. The ambience ,food and the service is really good. Subhadeep who was incharge of our table suggested‚Äã us the best starters and main course. 
In starters he suggested us
 1)Thai Glass noodles & bean sprouts spring rolls with sweet chilli sauce 
( The best thing about the spring rolls were it was not at all oily)
2) Wild mushroom and Shimeji mushroom tossed with Krapow and thai red chili
(The flavour of this dish is so good that it is worth coming back and having it the next time you visit this place)
In main course he suggested us
1)Burnt garlic,spring onion fried rice
2) Wok tossed fresh noodles with carrot, beans, spring onions and chilli flakes
(The noodles was a bit oily but was very tasty)
3) Green thai curry with chestnut, aspuragus and broccoli
( The main course was good and light to the stomach and not very heavy like other Chinese restaurants)
The food service is quick.

Visited Vintage Asia, an Oriental cuisine restaurant, at JW Marriot for a foodie meet and was definitely impressed by the ambiance and the food spread. This is a perfect place for a luxury dining experience, especially for Asian food lovers, with great decoration and hospitality.

Started the meal with Pork Xao Long Bao, a dumpling preparation that was perfectly stuffed with generous amount of  fillings and tasted fantastic. Also tried the Asparagus, Water chestnut Crystal Dumpling, which looked amazing to the eyes but did not impress my taste buds, although my fellow foodies seemed to have liked it.

¬†

For soup, I tried the Chicken Sichuan Hot & Sour ‚Äì it was spicy and tasty.

¬†

The appetizers included Chicken wings (tasted good), Crispy Fried Prawn (stole the show completely). Despite not being a fan of spring rolls, I tried out the Thai Glass Noodles & Bean Sprouts Spring Roll, which turned out to be a great starter in the menu 

The generous servings already made us full and we still had the main course and desserts to try out.

¬†
For the main course, I had the Sichuan Fried Chicken, Spiced Caramelized Pork Belly and Wok Tossed King Prawn in Xo Sauce. The chicken and prawn preparations were average. The pork preparation blew my mind and my taste buds too with its exceptional mix of spices, sauces and aroma.

¬†

The main course was paired well with the Burnt Garlic, Spring Onion Fried Rice and Hakka Style Chicken & Egg Noodles, but both the dishes tasted average independently.

¬†

For my sweet tooth, I picked the Mango Coconut Cr√®me Brulee, which was different but good to taste.

¬†

As a whole, Vintage Asia serves as the new address in the city for Asian cuisine. The price is very competitive when compared to other five stars.

¬†

Had an amazing experience here as the Chef personally came to our table to explain how the dishes had been prepared and gave us other insights about the Asian spread.

I have been waiting to visit a resto in the newly opened JW Marriott in my city. 5 star hotels bring with them new cuisines from round the world and gives you to opportunity to taste them and i am forever glad for that. 
Vintage Asia is the Oriental cuisine restaurant of JW andwe had a birthday to celebrate so this was the perfect opportunity.
Coming to the food. One word "DIVINE" 
Bangkok grilled satay chicken‚Äã - soft tender chicken on skewers with a peanut sauce. 
Thai fish cakes - fried fish in batter with sauce.
Crispy fried prawns - Star of the day. AWESOME dish and a must try. Tender prawn with wasabi mayo .... A match made in heaven.
Spiced caramel pork belly - this is the best pork i had in India and i have had pork belly all over the world. Star of the show 2. A MUST TRY 
Stir fried crispy bay of bengal betki - being a bong betki is love and this dish increased my love. 
Cantonese butter milk prawn - i had such creamy prawn after a long long time. And the buttermilk was just complimenting the prawn in everyway possible.
Wok tossed fresh noodles- awesome 
Prawn fried rice with XO sauce - double awesome.
Mango coconut creme brulee - DELICIOUS AND STUNNING. 
Going by my knowledge on Oriental cuisine i would have been lost without Subhodeep. Man if you are reading this u were the hero of the night, osonkho dhonnobad tomai for serving us so well & a huge cheers to the team who made my evening such a lovely experience. 
Way to go guys 
Cheers.

Excellent, authentic Asian food! Fantastic service, really great ambience, and good value for money. This place has all the reasons to be termed a must-visit. 

We tried the Crystal Dumplings, which were delicious. The sauces accompanied it wonderfully. 

The Thai green curry was exquisite. And so was the Pad Thai. The Thai food took me straight back to the wonderful restaurants of Bangkok. 

The mocktails were tasty as well.

I went here for dinner with my mom. First off, I must commend them on the decor. The place is done up exquisitely in red and wood tones, with an open kitchen and beautiful cutlery. We ordered a Sichuan fried chicken with peppercorns and mountain sun dried chilly, a crispy stir fried bhetki in Thai Saam Ros sauce and the burnt garlic fried rice (as recommended by fellow Zomato users). The chicken was delightfully crunchy and went especially well with chilli sauce. I loved the crispy chillies with it - even ate them on their own! The fish was tender and well coated in a mild yet piquant sauce. The rice was really unusual and probably one of the best fried rice dishes I've ever tried - I loved the flavour of burnt garlic! My mom loved the food too, especially the rice. Afterwards I took the toffee banana dessert with salted caramel ice-cream - I'm not fond of bananas, but I loved this version, in a crispy toffee caramel skin with sesame seeds on top! The ice-cream was great too. I have to commend the service too - I had taken a glass of wine but my mom hadn't ordered any drink, so our server gave her a complimentary mocktail. Overall, Vintage Asia is definitely worth every penny you'll spend. My new favourite Oriental restaurant in Kolkata!

It's The place for Chinese Food in Kolkata...... Its been years and Chinoserie has been the only Avenue for me for the best Chinese food in town but definitely Vintage Asia is the new Crowned King in my opinion.
Shubhadeep at Vintage Asia is ur guy. I dunno somehow he knows what u want and both my wife and me follow his recommendations blindly.The second time we went we didn't even look at the menu and had one of our best dining experiences.
The interiors are great...... The cutlery and even the jasmine tea kettle is one to click a snap with.
All in all a perfect place for a family gathering or even with friends.Prices are really reasonable considering its a 5 star.
Once again I wish there was one Shubhadeep in every restaurant  in the world. Cheers and keep up the great taste.

Been here today for dinner...great service and great food!
We went with all the suggestions of our server, Mr Shubhadeep.
We had chive dimsums and crispy fried potatoes for starters. Being a big dimsum/momo lover, I generally have a lot of expectations from the dimsums served at any place and this one definitely comes among the best ones (but yes I have had the best in Hyderabad, Tim Tai and China Bistro). Potatoes were fine.
Next we had burnt garlic rice and Thai green curry, both of which were really delicious with mild flavour. We also had mocktails, one strawberry based, which was standard and the other one a mix of blueberry and coconut cream, which was slightly weird yet enjoyable.
We did not intend to have desserts, but Mr Shubhadeep brought us an eggless chocolate cake as it was my birthday... it was a really sweet gesture.
Overall it was a good experience and I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys good Asian cuisine.

It was a special occasion, my daughter's 10th birthday. So we thought to celebrate over a lunch at vintage asia. We reserved our table previously. The first thing that one come across is the wonderful interior and a view of busy EM bypass. It's impressive. They welcome you with aromatic jasmine tea, some pickle and fried wanton. The pickle and the fried wonton need improvement they tasted below average.

We started with soups, Sichuan hot and sour soup and chicken wanton in superior broth. The hot and sour soup was average. The other one was good with fresh mushrooms. Along with the soups we also ordered pak choi wrapped chicken lotus root. Frankly speaking the dumplings looked far better than they tasted. 

For main course we ordered pad Thai which was a bit more sour to my tastebuds, something needed to balance the amount of tamarind in the pad Thai. We also ordered green curry(chicken) and steamed jasmine rice. The jasmine rice was perfectly cooked. And the green curry was the highlight of our lunch for many reasons. The green curry was perfect. I have had green curry in different parts of the world, and I can say without any doubt this one was really good and authentic in taste. But unfortunately I found something non edible in the portion of green curry that was served on my plate. Though the plates, cutleries as well as the entire bowl of the green curry and the steamed jasmine rice were replaced with freshly cooked one and the chef, manager all came to apologize, they didn't even charge a single rupee for our entire lunch. They apologized in all possible ways. We got a personal call from the executive chef. But still it makes me wonder how one should describe the experience. How you would have reacted? And when you come to a place like JW Marriott to celebrate a milestone in your life you obviously have very high expectations, but a blunder like this makes you question about the place. Personally I can understand this is a nightmare for people working in food and hospitality industry and it was just an incident that happened that day. Hopefully they will be more careful now on.

My rating of 3.5 is solely based on the food I tasted.

I am one of those crazy people in the taste of Thai food and yesterday I went to The Vintage Asia at JW Marriott -Kolkata.For my first feeling is the luxury restaurant, warm hospitality reception and food was perfect, serve with refinement portions and speedy service which always makes for a better dinner in everyday.If you are someone who wants to taste original Thai food.Before you order,I advise you to contact with Chef.Ninja.She is Thai expert in cooking and she can recommend Thai food that guarantees that you will be impressed by the original taste and beauty of dish.

A true luxury dining experience considering the decoration and the hospitality... coming to the food part, our experience was average... I mean after reading all this great reviews may be our expectation was too high, or we could not order properly. The taste is good, the dishes are well prepared. But what I felt was I had better food in some fine dine asian restaurants.¬†
¬†Pak choi dimsum: 4/5
Fried prawn : 3.5/ 5¬†
Mixed Chilly Garlic Noodles: 4/5
Bhetki in thai saam ros sauce : 4/5

I would like to start off by saying that this place deserves an applaud all together....just the look from the outside while entering you get to feel its exquisitely done ambience and mod lighting with all the chinese bits incorporated in its decoration here and there. Going to the food, I had visited this place for dinner with my family and my friend

Euphoric moment : Xiao long bao bursting in my mouth in an explosion of flavours. 
That being said this was my second visit to this gastronomic landmark . We choose to go to this place  for our Tibetan new year and I am glad we did. 
We had the 
silken tofu with edamame beans (tender , simple , fresh )
water-chestnut dumplings , (crunchy but average ) 
Soft shell singapore chilly crab ,  ( perfect combination of spices and a light batter on the crab not spicy with heat but a nice play on the tongue ) 
Xiao Long bao : the masterpiece. 
Main course : 
Pad thai : couldnt be better. 
Garlic fried rice : perfect balance of garlic. Didnt have the over whelming taste of garlic and the little burnt touch brought out the sweetness of the garlic. 
Pork Belly : lovely but honestly mom

A very nice place with contemporary decor for having asian food. JW, being new to kolkata, has kept the prices at levels which will ensure it gets repeat diners frequently. ¬†Apart from others, I would definitely recommend their soft shell crab, barbeque chicken and fried prawn. Sudeep, who is extremely courteous, helped us choose the dishes we wanted and is a person who one can look forward to.

Have visited this place a few weeks back for a luxury dining experience & it absolutely lived up to my expectations. Coming to the food, we had ordered for Pak Choi wrapped chicken dimsum & crispy fried prawn with wasabi mayo & for main course we had gone for Hakka style chicken & egg noodles & kung pao chicken. Each & every item was absolutely delicious & I ud recommend every dish. To add to it the Jasmine tea adds to it,it is refreshing. The staff were extremely courteous Nd polite & they helped in selecting the dishes that would best suite our taste preference. Considering a luxury dining restaurant it was extremely pocket friendly.

Staffs were very courteous and were pretty helpful. We had a three course meal. I loved the starters as well as main course, but my top favourite was the dessert. I would definitely love to visit again.

Tasted the Xiao Long Bao and Pork Belly among other things from the menu, and found Vintage Asia's version of both quite incredible. The chicken wonton soup I'd ordered was simple, flavourful, and perfect for my sore throat, while the hot and sour soup, with a kick from the Szechuan pepper was zesty and made me want to swap bowls with my friend who had ordered it. Also, I have a thing for silken tofu, and here, I found a version (reminded me faintly of Agedashi Tofu)a with some incredible fermented chilli and edamame which still haunts me. I haven't tasted better pork belly in Kolkata, to be honest, and the Xiao Long Bao were beautiful, although I would want a bit of chilli oil the next time I order a batch. Service was impeccable, and the drinks hit the right spot. In my main courses, went back for a vegetarian Mapo Tofu twice, and loved the simple yet gorgeous noodles.

A word to say first.. Awesome and Amazing Restaurant. Best oriental five star kitchen in town.
A warm welcome in the entrance of JW Marriott Kolkata ¬†gate with Namaste from security teams - A thumb up.
As a first timer in the JW Marriott Kolkata, it has an amazing lobby. I have been in many hotels in the world (Dubai, Jakarta, Hong Kong, Madrid, Germany, etc.). This hotel amazed me with the grandiose lobby and the chandelier art, big arrangement of flower.¬†
Vintage asia-The service team is very courteous, attentive to the service standard, friendly and attention to detail. The ambience of the restaurant is very warm with the asian deco in each corner of the restaurant.¬†

To the Food - A credit to the kitchen team of Vintage Asia. The cleanliness of open kitchen is number one. We have ordered 7 dishes for two of us.
As an appetizer: Chicken Wonton soup, deep fried prawn with wasabi sauce, Shimeji mushroom with Thai sweet basil, Chicken Satay.¬†
We had Prawn fried rice with XO Sauce, Black pepper beef and Chicken Kung Pao.¬†
The five star goes to: Shimeji mushroom with Thai Sweet Basil and Prawn fried rice with XO sauce.¬†
The food was tasting amazing.

A credit to Mrs. Ipshita Saha, she has done really good job on service and of course the upselling skills should be mentioned. She tried to up-sell a dessert to us even though we actually do not want to have it because we are full with the delicious meal. We followed her recommendation and took the selection of homemade ice cream - it just melted in our mouth. We do not eat much ice cream if it is not made in-house ¬†but this one was exceptional. The coconut ice cream is a must-try item.¬†

Thank you very much for the service. We will come back. Well-done.

What a luxury dinning experience at Vintage Asia - oriental restaurant of JW Mariott located at its first floor on the right side of the lobby. Amazing hospitality and ambience as well - steel colored theme reflects in the cutlery and its ambience all around.
Met their executive chef Tang from Malaysia, who came down and greeted me at the dinning area to check whether my palette met my expectation level or not. Thrilled with the hospitality of chef Tang and the Service Manager - Mr. Subhodeep - my food guide throughout the evening . I would like to extend my thanks to both of them - experienced Hawaii Thai cocktail tequila base sweet and sour in taste tossed with bell peppers and crush chillies (that is what i call a perfect blend and balanced taste - would recommend it as MUST to go to the drinks menu) prepared by Sudhodeep and yes of course the signature Thai dessert prepared by chef Tang as complimentary.
From the ala carte, Subhodip advised to go for pork dumplings as an appetizer and Prawn fried rice and chillli prawn as main course. Each of the items tasted so so fresh and delicious. The prawn rice was moist and tossed in burnt garlic - perfectly blended and my palette felt the taste for both. The chilli prawn was buttered in creamy gravy tossed with crispy basil leaves and coming to pork dim sum - just tasted heaven.
Last but not the least thanks to their food and beverage mgr - Sandeep for his warmth hospitality.
Will re-visit again.

I was planning to go to the JW Marriott from a Loong time. Finally last week went to this awesome hotel. Kolkata was missing the Marriott group and I am happy that this hotel giant has finally opened its doors in Kolkata. It is a very big property. I was amazed by its interiors. 

Coming to vintage Asia, it serves authentic Asian cuisine. They served us Jasmine tea as a welcome drink which they said is an asian must before the dinner. 

We tried the below mentioned food items and all were very good in taste and presentation..

Wok tossed mudroom and asparagus
Crispy potato, spring onions in fermented chilly paste 
Wild mushroom and shimeji mushrooms tossed with krapow and Thai red chillies
Asparagus water chestnuts crystal dumplings (only three)
Wok tossed fresh noodles

They have just received the liquor license hence there were not many cocktail options but the manager was friendly enough to get us whatever we wanted...

Overall a very good experience and am sure this place will give the other Asian restaurants of Kolkata a run for their money.

A must visit.... :)

I'm absolutely  in love with JW Marriott.  And Vintage Asia  is the icing on the cake.  Absolutely  love the outlet.  

Simply love the vintage Chinese tea room themed decor.  But taking vintage and blending it with class is what the decor is all about.  I find it very pleasing to the eyes.  

The tea service with the long spouts of the brass kettles adds to the charm.  

My first visit was a foodie meet and I'm going to say I was thoroughly  impressed with most of the dishes. The crystal dumplings were stunning.  The wings stood out well and so did the Mapo  Tofu.  I also loved the Sichuan chicken and the joy n sour soup.  

On the second visit,  I ordered a la carte and I liked it even more.  

The soft shell crabs were phenomenal .  No stench,  sweet meat served with a Smoky Tomato dip. Loved it.  The Pineapple mocktail was stunning too.  Loved the Kafir lime bitter note at the end. 

A special mention to the mushroom with basil.  I almost had tears of joy.  Kraprow like this is served only in Thailand .  

The Tub Thim klob  was stunning too.  I have a weakness for this dessert. Hats off!!! Not to forget the tender coconut  ice cream is lovely too.  

Keep making us happy.  I'll surely be back for more.  
Best oriental food in the city. 

Kudos!

The best part was that we go a free cake for my dad's birthday which was DELICIOUS! I could go on writing but don't wanna spoil other people's experience. Also, a special thanks to Suvankar who took very good care of us. After all, we loved it!!

It's already the talk of the town and I felt so glad to have experienced their service. 
Mr.Subhodeep, the service manager was an excellent food guide.
 We're thankful to him :)
Prompt service I must say.
Pineapple drink made by him was way too refreshing üëç
It was hard to resist the spread from Sontam, prawn XO, pork belly, kung pao chicken, fried prawns, Thai chicken curry
Chicken satay to desserts.
Sontam(the salad) was a good choice. The dish was as unique as it's name.
Cream brulee and tender coconut ice-cream deserves special mention among the dessertsüëå
Food and decor was class apart! 
Thumbs up for vintage Asiaüëç
Highly recommended!!!

Some places are restaurants ¬†and some are ¬†experiences, this one was the latter. Food coupled with service and decor make it a must try. Food in general in Marriotts across the world is quite renowned this was my first in this hotel group and I was not disappointed. The Tom Yum soup, the pak choi dim sums, ¬†the chicken wings, noodles, fried rice, and hot pot chicken was really a flavourful affair. The dessert i.e; coconut ice cream and Mango brulee with fresh strawberries was a delight, what I loved the most is that it's commitment to excellence was admirable by using the freshest of fruits and choicest of ingredients they really show that they go the extra mile.Even the quantity was perfect. Ambience is expected to be good in a 5 star, but for me what stood out was the service not only was it sharp and efficient it had a warmth to it which is lacking any many of it's contemporaries, even once out of jest I had said something rude about one of the staff but even after overhearing they kept that wonderful smile going, that was so nice. I would like to take the time to thank our server Mavela who made a conscious and well pulled off effort to make us feel comfortable, she also upped the ante by serving us with a complimentary birthday cake(which was incredibly light in texture). I am no food connoisseur and this is my 4th review on Zomato but I was really impressed.Instead of the fact that the lights I was under was making it tad too warm but otherwise no major faux pas. Thanks to the Vintage Asia team for making my 18th so wonderful. I will definitely visit again and so should you. Thanks for reading. Lots of love and stay blessed.

I happened to visit JW Marriott, where I decided to have oriental food which is my favourite Vintage Asia 
Here was a perfect suggestion from A Gentlemen working at this Property. The Food at Vintage Asia 
Was truly outstanding of all the Similar Food serving places I have been to in the past, the selection of food the decor the politeness of the staff and of course selection of cocktails were truly commendable 
I would just say the it was amazing experience 
Thank you JW Marriott Kolkata

The asian restaurant at J.W. Marriott , the place requires you to have a prior reservation.

Vintage asia gives you the feel of a modern asian restaurant than the usual decor you get in one of those chinese restaurant.

The condiment like crackers and kimchi looked stale and oily, needs to be looked upon by the hotel.
As for the food we ordered Chiu Chow Dumplings which was ok and the Water-chestnut Crystal Dumpling of which the flavor was good but the outer covering was thick , which in case needs to be thin. Also Ordered Wok tossed Mushroom and asparagus with garlic and lemon which was nice and something different.
And for the mains Crispy potato which was good and Crispy Taro ring dish was also something different and burnt garlic fried rice to go with the above mains.

The staff gave us complimentary Coconut ice-cream which was made in hotel by the chef and it was good and a must try.

Service was excellent , but the food quality and preparation can have improvements.¬†

Looking forward to try the Thai items in the menu.

I visited this place on a weekend with my friend. Since we didnt get a place in the bufffet area we planned to try out this place. Starting from the ambience, the hospitality and the food quality it was IMPECCABLE. Price is a little bit on a higher side because it is JWMarriot but after dining you wont feel the same way. 
I recommend this place to every foodie who loves chinese and thai food. CHEERS!

What an experience! Mind blowing! Firstly JW Marriott is way more ahead in taste of decor and food than ITC, Taj and The Park. Vintage Asia which has opened last December showcasing Asian, Chinese and Thai cuisine is on the first floor. We went there for dinner yesterday. I would like to thank Mr. Sandeep and Ms. Ipsita (forgive me if the name spelling is incorrect) for giving us this wonderful experience. I had booked a table for 3 and had asked Mr. Sandeep to arrange something for my mother as it was her birthday. He arranged for us a cake which was complementary. It was presented is a beautiful manner. My mother was pleasantly surprised. The cake was just melting in the mouth. Then as we are small eaters, we went to the main course. Ms. Ipsita guided us with the order. We ordered Hakka noodles with chicken, egg and prawn, Prawn fried rice with xo sauce (Chinese cuisine) and Massaman curry with meat (Thai cuisine) as the side dish. After this we were given Jasmine tea. Again complementary and it was really aromatic. Then came the main course, each and every item was delicious. The portion was enough for 3 people. Then we ordered the dessert. Again Ms Ipsita suggested us the item. Mango coconut creme brulee. Guys please don't shy away from this even if you don't like the smell of coconut. It was the best dessert I ever had. It was extremely delicious. One is enough for 3 people.
All these under 3k. Wow....!
Thank you Vintage Asia and JW Marriott for this wonderful dinner experience.

Went there on a date! First things first the place is extremely cosy and comfortable plus the decor is sober! Though the food disappointed me! The dimsum was really not up to my expectations and the kung pao chicken was too spicy though the fired rice was average but the basil punch drink was really refreshing! Over all the place is okayish!!

What a place!! Marriott deserves every bit of its fame and glory! Been to Vintage Asia yesterday with my special someone, and I must say it is a place you'll love . Perfect lighting, wonderful ambience and great food. Particularly want to thank Mr. Subhadeep for his lovely behaviour and great recommendations about the choice of dish. Dimsums were unique. Perfect place for chinese cuisine. Looking forward to visit Marriott soon again. Vintage Asia rocks!!!

My second visit to Kolkata' s Marriott and first visit to Vintage Asia, went with lot's of hope and expectations to celebrate Mom's birthday. Thankfully we were not at all disappointed, in fact we are happy with our experience.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Firstly, the ambience is awesome, well decorated with good lighting. The staffs were very friendly and well courteous specially Ms. Ipshita Saha, this young lady who had a warm smile always..
¬†¬† Coming to the food, it was yummy. We were welcomed with Jasmine tea followed with crackers and pickles. For starters we ordered Tom Yum Soup and two kinds of Dimsums (Pak Choi Wrapped Chicken and Prawn n Chive). For main course we had Prawn Fried Rice with XO sauce (must try), Hakka Chicken Noodles and Chong Quinn style Hot pot Chicken. Every dishes were delicious, we were ever complimented with 2 kinds of mocktails and a birthday cake for Mom.
¬†¬† Overall we had a wonderful experience, cant wait to visit soon. Thank you Vintage Asia and it's Team üòäPayal Choudhury

My first visit of course to this new restuarant at the JW Marriott. With high hopes we went to this Asian restuarant but was quite disappointed. 
The table first was full of stains. Surprising at the new place !! 
The qty of food served in started were quite less. Just 3 pcs in a portion of spring rolls. 
The mains was worse. Rice was soggy and tasteless. 
Asparagus with water chess nuts was the silver lining in the whole meal. 
Noodles was ok but just about. 
Service was worse of all. They were all so in a hurry to remove the plates and kind of indications that we should eat and leave. 

It is going to be long time to my next visit that - if ever !!!

JW Marriott opened its gates for the people of the city of Joy on around mid of December 16 & since then the deadly duo of Vintage Asia & JW Kitchen has been on my list. The positive word of mouth and nice reviews about the buffet on offer made JW Kitchen the prefered one on a Sunday evening. I along with my friend,who does not leave here,decided to plunge in a pool of delicacies & I even vouched to my friend that you will advocate for the place once you are done with dinner. To my utter disgrace the JW Kitchen was full & not accepting booking.Hence based on the staff's suggestion we moved to Vintage Asia. The place was beautifully decorated giving the typical feel of South East Asia. I was a little morrosed to start with but Mr Subhadip made my day. He took us through the menu & was ready to help. He even called for the Mixologist & based on his suggestion we ordered for mocktail named Passionate drink & a cocktail by the name of Hargow. For starters we had dimsums,one portion was Pak Choi wrapped chicken lotus root & other was Prawn & Chive.  They were good in terms of taste & quantity. The main course consisted of Hakka style Chicken & Egg noodles,Kung Pao chicken dry chilly cashewnut & Thai Red curry of Asparagus,Squash,Water Chestnut,thai sweet basil. The noodles were good & so was the poultry dish with decent slices of chicken & ample of cashew nuts for the taking. Thai Red curry typically stood out for me as it was apt in terms of spices,asparagus & other ingredients & had a refreshing taste. The dessert,Mango coconut creme Brulee was just over top & flattery words won't be enough to describe it.It was a pool of mango coconut creme, with a thick layer of palm sugar caramel covering it from the top. The taste enriches as you dig deep through the caramel chunk üòäüòã. To sum it up an awesome experience & dear fellow foodies do make it a point to come here & experience one of the best culinary treats that a metropolitan can offer üòä.

It was my first visit to JW MARRIOTT kolkata...... and it was surely a memorable one. I wanted something exclusive as it was our Marriage Anniversary...and this place delivered exactly what i wanted. The decor of the restaurant was subtle with a touch of red and black blended in complete harmony. The ambiance was just perfect as i do not enjoy a restaurant where the people shout at the top of their voices and make ruckus, and the attendants dance on your head.
I was glad to find Vintage Asia quite Vintage i must say.¬†
Let me first talk about the drinks ,,made by Sandeep (Manager).... well awesome is also a small word for it they were completely mind blowing...Takila Sunrise.... and a special drink which he made just for me with little tinge of lime..ginger..mint leaves...vodka and a pink syrup was just too good.
The suggestion of the starter and the main course was given by Suvodeep and i must say he designed it just d way we wanted. Chicken satay was juicy.....prawn fried rice with XO sauce is a must try.
Coming to the dessert part...... it was completely Waooo with Mango Creme Bulee. We also got a chocolate cake as complimentary which was too yummy and elevated my mood completely.
If you are looking for an exclusive place and do not mind to spend for the best, ¬†to have a good time...with good food and drinks.....with your very special one.....then this is exactly where you should be.

Adding to the great food and luxurious ambience is the quality of service. I would like to specially acknowledge the service provided by Mr. Subhadeep, for his recommendations, on-time service and not to forget, his manner of conduct. I would also thank him for the his gesture of serving us a complimentary cake for my birthday. It was delicious. I am going to be happy to revisit the place for reasons more than one.

Visited yesterday and had probably the best oriental cuisine in Kolkata. The ambience of the place was awesome and the server's Shubodeep and sirodeep made the best effort to make us comfortable and provide inputs on our order. The menu was not very extensive, but all the dishes we ordered were near perfect. The Kung Pao chicken, prawn say the dimsums in chi chu sauce are a must have. And the hand churned coconut ice-cream was a delight. Fairly placed the restaurant is set to give competition to other big names. Kudos to JW

All I can say is what I said to my wife while we were dining, "This is one place where you can order with your eyes closed, because whatever you ask for is bound to be incredible." The staff is delightfully friendly‚Äî with wonderful stories and anecdotes, especially our server Subhadeep‚Äîambience par excellence, and food pushing the boundaries of both taste and presentation. The tiny little touches make for a memorable experience, like the lovely cake they presented us at the end of our meal (pic attached) and how they took care of our daughter when she got hurt. Definitely going to come back again and again. :) P.S.: Do check out the infinity pool on the floor above. It's simply magical in the evenings.

I had my anniversary dinner here after unfortunate in getting reservation in JW Kitchen. Fortunately I will never regret this dinner as the food, ambiance and service were superb. Especially I must mention Dweep (probably misspelled his name). His service was awesome and at the end he gave us a drink (impression as he called it) that actually created a long lasting impression on us. Quality and taste of foods were awesome and also the presentation was feel good for the eyes. At the end I can say it made my night.

Upon visiting the JW Kitchen¬†(You may refer to this for the JW Kitchen offerings especially the Buffet), two times, in fact, I was planning for the Asian Fine dine, Vintage Asia that JW Marriot has opened a month back on December, 16. Now that I (read we, the foodie family) have exhausted almost the entire budget that is fixed for F&B the month of January and hardly available with a few thousand for the half of the month I have decided to visit the place next month. ¬†To be very frank for me, ¬†being a ¬†decent middle-class, opting for five stars more than once in 6 months of time is not something we are not used to until we have the present rates that are JW Marriott is coming up with. I was though a bit conscious with their individual restaurants as I was expecting not much moderate rate there until exploring the menu there at the Vintage Asia.
                                                                ...

I had visited Vintage Asia on the 19th of January 2017. What I didn't know before that day was that this day would be stored in my memory as one of the days where I had a quality experience apart from satisfying my taste buds. The restaurant is more than just lip - smacking and delicious food. A person named Subhodip who works in that restaurant guided us brilliantly and literally gave us directions to our main course. Vintage Asia has done a brilliant job and I am sure it will stand tall in my list of favourite restaurants. I wish them all the best. Good going Vintage Asia.

Vintage Asia, JW Marriott exceeded our expectations. I think this was by far my best experience. We were a little apprehensive as it was our first time but it was a truly amazing experience especially because of Subhadeep and his precise suggestions. Amongst all the delicious dishes the Crispy fried prawn in starters and the Kung Pao Chicken in the main course were my personal favourites. Saving the best for the last, do not leave the restaurant without having their home made ice cream! I would suggest, to make life easier just go to the restaurant and look for Subhadeep and you'll be sorted. Keep eating! ;)

Lovely place. Hit by chance for a dinner. Lovely ambience. If you reach early then maybe booking isnt required but it advisable to have a booking done. The choice of menu is limited but is nice. The Thai food we opted for was really nice. Subhadeep Dey, who helped us choose the menu and drinks is a lovely young gentleman whi tons of energy and a very big smile. Knows his F&B. Ambience is nice.

This was my first entry to the Vintage Asia, J W Marriott Kolkata and frankly, somehow, I am somewhat scared to enter the big hotels, especially their specialty outlets. Those who know me, you know that I‚Äôm quite comfortable with the street food, but in these joints, I get a little baffled ‚Äì what to do, how to behave, and with so many sophisticated people around, what would be the right thing to do‚Ä¶.. But, surprisingly the Vintage Asia gave a slightly different feeling from the moment I entered. It felt less formal and more like friendly ambiance and I actually liked that. And with friends around, who really cared ?

Okay, first things first. Vintage Asia is the specialty oriental restaurant headed by chef Sudip and Chef Tan. The decor is posh, yet sober giving it a warm feeling. But then again every biggie in this genre has that, so what‚Äôs the big deal- I asked myself. But as soon as we sat down, the tea ceremony started and I was coming to understand the difference. The difference was the famed Marriott service and it showed throughout the dining experience.

¬†
We were offered a specially curated menu at a packaged price for our large group but still the curious me wanted to see the menu card and as I found out, the a la carte dishes also are quite reasonably priced (considering its a prime property and the big portion sizes)- a big relief for me- ‚ÄúI can come otherwise also then and that too without selling one of my kidneys‚Äù- I uttered to myself.

I opted for the cocktail (Sinsen- tequila base with jaggery and herbs) but also tasted a sip from the mocktail (Tom YumSiam- lemongrass and galangal flavored) and both were refreshing. The service style of the cocktail was nothing less of a celebration and was worth a ‚Äúdekho‚Äù.

For starters, we were served four types of dimsum (all piping hot). For non-veg, there were prawn and pork Bao and for vegetarians, there were Asparagus and water chestnut crystal dumpling (looked just awesome- I had 2 of them) and Edameme and truffle dumplings. But, out of them, I‚Äôd suggest, if you order, go for the pork Bao and only that. All were good, but these pork ones were just heavenly. Pop one in your mouth, feel it explode with the juiciness and feel lost for a few moments- divine.

Soup came next and we were supposed to choose from hot and sour soup and wanton in superior broth. The superior broth consists of a rich clear meat broth with ginger. What I felt, the latter one is far far superior in taste. It‚Äôs not that the first one is bad (its equally good), but there has to be a winner and there‚Äôs no confusion here.

And the next dish was was something which is everybody‚Äôs eternal love. I am not qualified enough to comment on the authenticity quotient, but we all love to drop the fork-knife, hold them with out bare fingers, place them in between our teeth and behold, the soosh, wing-bones come out. We all love that. Here, it was properly cooked with the right amount of crunchiness and softness inside‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Personally I am not that much of a prawn lover, but fried prawn is a different story altogether. Loved them, but I liked it as it is- without the wasabi mayo. The Mapo tofu is not my personal favorite, but loved the crispiness of the veg¬†
Finally, after we are full, the main course started coming in and who are we lesser mortals to deny them ? The fried rice and noodles were okay-ish and nothing special, but I was surprised by the veg main course options. The veg thai red curry was so good that I actually had to order some steamed rice (just to add justice to the dish, don‚Äôt take me otherwise‚Ä¶..), but the showstopper was the tofu with sichuan peeper. Even a carnivore like me had to take 2 helpings- impressed. The crispy potato with chilly extract was a revelation.

And finally it was the time, for which we all (at least most of us) were waiting- the non-veg main course. I am coming to the pork belly later, but finally some upmarket oriental specialty restaurant MADE a good spicy fried chicken. It was fiery and brilliant, like seriously good- definitely noted for my next visit. The king prawn was good and is to be tried with steamed rice. It had the right amount of spicy and tangy quotient. And, finally the pork belly. Oh my phucking god- what a dish. Caramelized, tangy exterior and juicy, succulent inside- this dish is just the epitome of what a pork belly should be like. Let me be honest. Once I come back for the next time, I am going to have just the pork bao and the pork belly with pineapple. Seriously impressed.

Dessert was next. We were served creme bruilee and toffee banana with salted caramel ice-cream. Frankly, I don‚Äôt remember either of their tastes (except the ice cream). After you meet god, lesser mortals hardly matter and such was my case after having the pork belly. Secretly, I was actually craving for more.

Were we full ? Are you still asking ? Like really ?
 Pocket pinch ? For a couple, it should be around 2200/-, but then when did happiness come cheap ?

I have to admit I am a little partial to Asian Food though I love all kinds of food as those of you who read my blog will know. Vintage Asia at the JW Marriott , Kolkata was the venue for the New Year meet for my foodie group the Kolkata Food Fanatics. My mad crazy foodie family is now almost 3 years old and is very close to my heart I had wanted to do something a little special to kick off the year and I doubt it could have been more perfect. I had visited the venue to check out the place and fell in love with it because I loved the understated elegance of the place. The little touches like the burnished copper tea kettles used to pour the Jasmine Tea , the Blue and White pottery , the Wooden Tea Chests , the lovely rustic earthenware kettles all just added to the charm of the place. The Bar with its 24K Gold plated glasses for their Signature Cocktails, the cozy spaces created by the layout of the tables , the open kitchens where you get to see the Chef‚Äôs in action only added to its charm.

When seventeen very hungry Kolkata Food Fanatics descend upon the newest Asian specialty restaurant in Kolkata, what follows? Madness, mayhem, lots of pictures, lots of social media updates and of course, very good food!¬†What is this¬†restaurant that we all went to? Vintage Asia at J W Marriott Kolkata that¬†is just a month old. Opened last December,¬†Vintage Asia¬†showcases Asian, Chinese and Thai cuisine amalgamating traditional spices and flavors. It was my first time at the restaurant and I was simply blown away by the food. To know what I ate and what I loved, read on.

This is more of a Thai Place than a asian/ chinese place.

The place is very well done up, and what struck my eye the moment i entered was the Bar. Its very well done up. Its very different to other usual bars .
They have amazing crockery , glasses ¬†and cutlery .

For starters we ordered Tom Sam Salad and Crystal Dumpling both of which were excellent. For the mains ordered a VeG pad thai Noodles ¬†and even that was excellent.

Over all Amazing food and very good hospitality.

Icing on the cake is that its light on the pocket....... Not very expensive as other thai restaurants

So we visited JW Mariott ,Vintage Asia because we found the JW Kitchen to be full . We were a bit skeptic because of the sub 4 ratings. But then it did really surpass our expectations.
We ordered Prawn Dimsum along with Chicken wrapped in Pok Choy . Both of the items were extremely well made and heavenly in taste. Then we ordered Chicken and Egg Hakka Noodles, Prawn Fried Rice and Prawn Red Thai curry. The rice and the curry was really good. With the curry being just the right amount of spicy. 
I felt the noodles were pretty average , and the amount of chicken was pretty less. But what JW Kitchen missed in food was more than made up by its hospitality.
Special Mention to Dweep who was our server. He took care of my parents , suggesting us what to order and made the experience really great. He really knows what hospitality is all about and vintage asia is is really lucky to have him.

We had planned our Christmas Dinner with my Family in JW Marriott that is recently opened in Kolkata.. Serving Excellent, I always had a keen interest to visit their luxurious boutique hotel located just beside ITC Sonar Bangla Hotel in E M Bypass near Science City..!! The Ever Beautiful MAA Flyover can be seen segmented beside it for the ease of connectivity. Coming to the Detailed Description of this Amazing Hotel, The Way of Entry is a Grand Entry as Security Checking for the Cars is quite strict enough.. Next is you have enter through a Scanner Machine depositing all your Mobile, Wallet and Hand Luggage in a separate scanner machine and metal detector to have successfully passed the security check just like the Airport accessibility of Security Check.. Once you are done, you will enter the Engineering Masterpiece Wonder..!! No doubt about the Infrastructure because it cannot be compared with any of the best five star hotels in Kolkata. The Waiting Lounge , Enquiry Forum and the Hall for Functions were Outstanding and Masterpiece of a Class. Marriott proves why it is amongst the Best Hotels of Luxury in Kolkata. We had our Reservations in Vintage Asia a la carte. As we reached there.. There were amazing decorations of Christmas Trees, Santa Clauses and Resting Areas being lit up in a fantastic manner which was surely a eyespot to shoot photos. Entered the Vintage Asia with high expectations and was speechless about the Interior Decorations.. Lit up in Beautiful Soft Lights, The Soothing Light Music in the Background added versatility to the Ambience. Seats were ultra comfortable and we were given a huge table for our joint family as we were 12 members in our group..!! Anyway coming to the Food Joint.. There were two dedicated Menus of Desserts and Main. The Main Menu was itself a variety of different options in Asian Items that were enough to confuse you which one to choose. Honestly I am not an Asian Food Freak so got some suggestions from the polite Waitress itself who helped me to have a taste of the signature items in the Menu itself. We ordered Fresh Lime Soda, Pineapple Crush amongst the Drinks and in terms of Starters and Main Course, We ordered Chicken Wonton in Superior Broth Soup, Bangkok Grilled Satay (Chicken), Crispy Fried Prawns in Wasabi Mayo, Salt and Sichuan Pepper amongst the Starters, Steamed Jasmine Rice, Burnt Garlic and Spring Onion Fried Rice along with Hakka style Chicken and Egg Noodles.. For the Side Dish, we ordered Steamed Bay of Bengal Bhetki in Manao Sauce..!! The Food came a bit late though the Soup was served fast and hot..!! Exploring about the Taste Honestly, The Soup went down to my Expectation as it was not that good and amazing in terms of what was expected as per quality and price. Yes, The Quantity was very good but the Taste of it was not that delicious. Owing to the Instant Complain to the Waitress about the disappointing quality, She said to have served free samples for that price in another variant but we didn't carry on further in Soups and so discontinued it there.. Coming to the Starters and Main Course Joint, We were first served with the Grilled Satay and the Fried Prawns with the Barbeque type portable Ovens in our table and owing to it's class, it was fantastic surely.. These two Starters made my mood go high upto expectation about the Main Course as they showed their quality. The Chicken was garnished with Seaseme and the Prawns were too tender and crisp enough to melt in the tongue itself. With the effect of burnt oven smell in it.. It was ecstatic to have those amazing Asian Starters.. Withing no time came in the Main Course of Rice and Fish that we ordered. The Long grained Jasmine Rice tasted very good but the Burnt Garlic and Spring Onion Rice was the Best.. It was simply amazing.. Believe Me, The Quantity was overall okay but the Quality cannot be compared to any other.. It was a class apart. The Next came in the Noodles that were a craze for my family but got a taste of it which was quite good but not excellent..The Steamed Bhetki that was served at the last was the Showstopper amongst all the items.. It just melted in the mouth with perfectly cooked tender fillets wrapped up in a spicy mixture of sauces that was a blender to the tongue at the end of the menu..!! The Soda was a perfect finisher as well as an appetizer which made our Christmas Dinner quite an experience to share through my review..!! As we were leaving the place, I was called by the Chef and the Waitress to have give a Feedback on their Form and personally let them know how they can improve more..!! Well to my Expectation, You Guys did it but could have been the BEST, had that Soupy Experience would not have disappointed us in the beginning..!!
Anyway, I hope that this Review will help many others to have a keen look and share your experience through this World Class Boutique Hotel of Luxury that is surely One of the Best and the Pride for our City of Joy, Kolkata especially for the Food Lovers and Joint Ventures like us to visit such extraordinary places..!!

We visited the restaurant on the 7th of Jan, 2017 after joining the Club Marriot. Though our booking was for 9:30pm ... we had to wait an extra 20-25min to get a table. We got the table only after I followed up with one of the managers ... ¬†though the expectation of a 5* is that they would follow up with you. Anyways ... the restaurant is nicely appointed and the decors and ambience are excellent.¬†

Once seated, we were immediately attended to. For starters we, ordered the the Tom Yum Soup (Seafood) which was probably the best I have had in the city. We also ordered for Crispy Fried Prawns and Chicken Shumai. The prawns were covered with sesame seeds and come with a dip ... so - ¬†like us - if you don't like the sesame seeds, then you need to mention it. The chicken shumai was nice but the quantity is just 3 pcs. For main course we ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and Yong Chow Fried Rice. We had specifically mentioned for the chicken to be made only mildly spicy but the portion that came was quite spicy ... also as per the description there were no cashew nuts in it. But on complaining, they immediately changed it and the changed dish was very tasty ... it was as if a different chef has prepared it. The rice also tasted very nice.¬†

For desserts, we had their homemade chocolate ice-cream which was nice but again had sesame seeds in it ... I guess the chef there really loves sesame seeds!¬†

In conclusion, the service is quite good but the servers seem to be trying too hard ... so at times things looked forced and not natural. Also, the menu is a little restricted. All this could be because the restaurant is just about a month old. I cant help but compare the restaurant with Pan Asian of ITC and I must say the the ITC product is several notches higher in every department. However, it terms of pricing ... the rates are very reasonable and after the 30% discount for Club Marriott members ... the place can easily compete with ¬†the non-five-star standalone restaurants of the city in terms of affordability.¬†

Vintage Asia has got off to a good start and I wish the management all the best. We would certainly be coming here again.

The newest 5 star property in town & it's a Marriott... So was keen to experience it. Marriott does it extravagantly & so it has in Kolkata. But off course somewhat limited by business prospects in Kolkata. Coming to Vintage Asia, it has a very contemporary decor.. Unlike other oriental restaurants where you are bombarded with oriental theme everywhere. What I disliked about the decor was the placements of tables.. They are too close to each other for comfort in my opinion. But that was more than made up by the excellent food and wonderful hospitality of its staffs specially Subhadeep De. The food was delicious. We liked and would recommend Gai Yang for sure.. But icing on the cherry was the desserts... Tub Kim krob is a fantastic coconut cream based dessert & the Home made ice cream they serve you is the Coconut ice cream very popular in Thailand. Overall a very enjoyable experience. Loved it!

I went with my family to this restaurant on 30.12.2016. We were greeted with a lot of warmth by Avinash and his accomplished team. We ordered for the glass noodle spring roll and asparagus with water-chestnut crystal dumplings as starters. Though my parents don't mushrooms, but they still really enjoyed the starters. For main course we had wok tossed noodles, crispy potatoes in chilly paste and one custom made vegetable with asparagus. Chef Abhishek really made the food as per our liking. 
Overall experience was very enjoyable. Avinash also provided us a very generous helping of homemade coconut ice cream which was also yummm. Thank you Avinash and your team for taking such good care of us. We will come back soon .....üòÑ

When everyone is running to the J W Kitchen for their amazing buffet experience at such a steal deal, we were too cool to visit Vintage Asia, the Pan Asian restaurant of this unit at this point of time as J W Kitchen was completely booked. The experience was excellent, in a nutshell. It was a very special family dinner and we had a lovely time under the guidance of Mr. Subhadeep who attended us throughout.
Firstly, we were welcomed with the classic Chinese Jasmine Tea. Being not very fond of any kind of tea, I actually liked it as it was really flavourful.
Then we ordered some dimsums - Edamame and Truffle, Pork Xiao Long Bao, Chicken and Shiitake and Prawn and Chive dumplings. Each one of them were better than the other. But the best one was the veg Edamame and Truffle dumplings. It was like out of the world. Loved it to the fullest. Dimsums are a must have over here!
Main Course -
Thai Red Curry with Duck and Lychees - Not very fond of red curries, but going by the suggestion of Mr. Subhadeep didn't fail us. It's one of the best I have had till date. The flavour of lemongrass was very subtle and the curry was yummy. They used skinned duck meat, which was not preferred by many members in our group. I would suggest they should ask beforehand about this option - with or without skin.
Thai Red Curry with Prawns - Same as the earlier one. Nothing special. Tasted good.
Jasmine Rice - Flavoured with jasmine and sticky by texture, it was a fusion of Thai and Chinese cuisine. Went very well with the Thai Curries.
Phad Thai - Took the eggie version. Not at all recommended. Peanuts were not there, the sauce was really bland and the noodles were thin unlike the actual phad thai noodles and overloaded with sprouts.
Buttered Milk Prawns with Curry Leaves and Bird Eye Chilli - Tasted very good. Semi gravy by nature. Recommended totally.
Chicken Hakka Noodles (can't recall the exact name) - Tasted delicious. You should try this out if you don't want to risk pretty much with the dining experience.
Chicken Item with Shiitake Mushrooms and Bamboo Shoot (very long name, don't remember, not mentioned in Zomato menu) - This was the best dish of the main course that night. The gravy was excellent with perfect thickness and texture and the mushrooms created a fantastic experience altogether.
Desserts -
Tub Tim Krob - Classic Thai dessert with waterchestnut jellies soaked in Coconut milk. I am a huge fan of this dessert. I loved it but I guess that this would taste even better if they used the waterchestnut in original form, rather than making jellies out of it.
Coconut and Mango Cr√®me Brul√© - Presentation was excellent. Tasted more like a pudding not satisfying the conditions for a classic Cr√®me Brul√©, there was no dollop of cream on top, still the dessert tasted heavenly as an independent sweet treat. Would suggest them to change the name of this dessert.
Homemade Tender Coconut Ice Cream - Ah! This was lovely. The best one from the evening it was. Flavourful with bits of coconut and the seasame waffle it was served along with took the ice cream to another level.
Drinks -
Tom Yam Siam
Blueberry Lemonade
Asian Mary
Lemongrass and Mint
All the drinks were excellent but the last one was the best as it was really refreshing and also complimentary. Most of their mocktails have been inspired by the main course or desserts of the Asian cuisine. Presentation is excellent and unique. Recommended.
Overall experience was very good. Special mention must be made of the service and hospitality. Mr. Subhadeep and Manager Sandip attended us very well giving a very homely feeling. Ambience needs no description, it's just top notch, so is the d√©cor.
The glitch that affected us all that the use of tiger or jumbo prawns. They don't behead the prawns or de shell them. At a place like Marriott where everyone comes for fine dining, it's really difficult to behead the jumbo prawns and eat with fork and knife. This must be looked upon. Presence of pods and the black strip while eating on these arthropods can often be nauseating. I have communicated this to the concerned management in person while giving feedback. Hope they will resolve this problem soon. Prawns being a popular exotic dish has a high demand at an exotic place like Marriott. Things like this just cannot be ignored as they charge too high for a portion of this dish.
Portions are actually small compared to other five star standards but the food is delicious, worth remembering.
I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and foes looking forward to the management rectifies the few glitches they are making presently being a newbie in the city. Otherwise, it's just perfect! Happy Dining! :)

This is one of the restaurants of JW ¬†Marriott and serves authentic chinese and thai food. The seafood menu is worth trying. I liked the dimsum chicken and chive. The decor is elegant and ambiance is good.

Visited Marriott for my parents anniversary. Right from the reservation to the actual service, the staff at Marriott surpassed our expectations. We dined at Vintage Asia- the oriental restaurant at Marriott. From the soups (Tom Yum and Sichuen chicken soup) to main course (an impeccable Dry Red Prawn Thai Curry, a delicious Stir fried Pepper Beef coupled with a fragrant Jasmine Rice) upto the piece de resistance, which was a homemade tender coconut ice cream and a mango creme brulee with a crunchy tuille, the food was to die for. Special mention to Subhodeep, Avinash and Stella for being such hospitable attendants and making our dinner so enjoyable. Will definitely visit again for sure !!

Beware of this ghost lady who'd pretend to book your reservation by penning down your name and number but once you're there at the restaurant reception you'd find your name is not on the list, that nobody previously had answered your call and nobody booked your reservation. So you'd be left with two options - one, hunt down that ghost lady or two, hunt for another restaurant. Either would seem impossible in a rush hour but good luck with the second option, which we sorted successfully. But the ghost of Christmas is out there somewhere!

Recently visited this place, during recent trip to Kolkata and I must say, this is one of its kind of restaurant in Kolkata. Pan asian is my favourite cuisine and this place did justice to it. I tried the Beijing vegetable mushroom dumpling, Asparagus water chestnut crystal dumpling, Tomyum soup and it was absolutely amazing. Overall, it was a nice experience and I love J.W. Marriott Kolkata property. One of the best marriott hotels in India. Will visit again very soon.

It's really sad that a newly opened hotel gives such bad service. I have been trying to make a reservation for my 1st anniversary for the past three days. Every time I call they transfer us to the restaurant which doesn't respond. Inspite of telling the operator my problem no help or solution was provided. They yet again just transferred my call to the restaurant.
