This is the worst restaurant¬†I've ever been to.¬†

Ambience: It was ok until they turned on TV with some stupid game going on. Ruined my date.
Food Quality: I don't know why this place is still in operation. It was the worst food I've ever tasted in any restaurant. The food tasted horrible and even the lime soda was miserable.¬†
Service: Waiters are well-behaved but never go for their recommendation. He recommended us Fish Cheese Kebab and I almost puked at the smell of that thing.¬†
Recommendation: Please avoid this restaurant, its way better even if you opt egg roll from a roadside kiosk. I regret my decision of having a dinner at that place. They should change their tagline from "BEST QUALITY IS OUR MOTTO" to "WE SERVE SHIT".

The place is located at the middle of behala 14.no bus stand and behala thana, near the behala-rajabazar minibus stoppage. I visited this place during pujas, which was really nice. During pujas they prepared some special menus, which were brilliantly cooked. They provide good food at reasonable prices.

My brother brought takeaway after their visit to this restaurant. So I can't say about their ambience and service. This review would solely entail the taste of the food - Mixed Szechuan Fried Rice and Garlic Chicken(B/L).

Well, the taste was ordinary, suitable for run-of-the-mill hunger prangs and not for the times when your taste buds are craving some excitement. The food wasn't bad either, if I'm being honest. Ample quantity was present and it did satiate my hunger. I know that Szechuan is a bit on the spicier side but the abundance of dried chilli tucked throughout the rice did hike up the heat with a full throttle. Ironically, the garlic chicken contrasted the heat by being a tad sweeter than it's supposed to be. I guess, they even it out üòú. The chicken pieces, as found in any cheap Kolkata-Chinese restaurants, was with a thick coating and a bit stiff(it might be different when had in the restaurant, served hot right after a few quick whirls in the hot wok/kadai or whatever it is with the generic sauces prepped beforehand or so).

Apart from these snobbish criticisms, that arguably isn't warranted by this place since it's not trying to be something it is not, the food was satisfactory and served its purpose. Expectations were low and they were met.

I am really surprised to see their low rating. Have been here for quite a few times and personally the experience has been good. The decor is nice though nothing outstanding. Food items are mainly chinese and north indian dishes. Food quality is good and portion sizes are more than average. Prices are less considering quantity and quality. The only slack could be a bit delay in services. A good place for family outings nevertheless. Recommend a visit to others.

Been here two years back during durga puja. 
As it was saptami, after we toured in behala we were really hungry. 
We went to this place and we had to wait for 15-20minutes for a table. 
We had kebabs, roti and chicken butter masala.. The food was really good if compared to the other stalls which was providing worst quality food during the pujas. 
Overall bill for 3people were 650bucks.

We were 6 of us and had a sumptuous and traditional Bengali food .... I specially liked their idea of  eating with hand instead of using spoons and fork.... good work KASTURI keep it up üòçüòçüòä

A local restaurant with flavor of kolkatan Chinese....but yes the main purpose of the review is to let you know about the quality of the food served. Yesterday we have a chance to savour its mixed fried rice along with chicken chilly and prawn Kunfow. Now the quality of rice is very nice because generally small eateries like this use excessive oil in rice which in turn makes u buffle after few helpings.On contrary this restaurant used very less oil and it was light on every bite. Pieces of shrimps were in abundance double egg was sprinkled in quantity and chicken shreds were just wow......overall 4/5. Then came the chilly chicken well cooked succulent and juicy not very spicy, sweet n sour flavor was there and Prices were normally good. Prawn Kunfaw, though a bit overpriced but the quality was just above the same. Pieces were very tender and good the saucy portion was in little abundance will rate 3.5/5. Im rating overall  3.5 because of the price as compared to other restaurants. Rest is nice

Of course, it does not compete with the likes of Panna & Arsalan but on its own, it is a good enough place with good atmosphere. The staff & the owners are friendly and recommend good honest options. The Indian is better than the Chinese food here and has no dearth of options with moderate pricing.

Sonamati Restaurant is located in Behala near 14 No. Bus Stand. Going by the name it may seem that the restaurant offers some Village or Tribal ambience and foods but in reality its totally different. Sonamati has a nice big dining inside with some simple but decent decor offering a nice romantic ambience by its dim lightings.

Its multi cuisine but I got stuck with their Chinese only. Tried their Fried Rice, Chilli Chicken & Chicken Manchurian. All the foods came to table in little time, probably cause the restaurant stays empty most of the time. Coming to the food it seemed that all the foods were served directly from the refrigerator. I didn't understood how everything got that cold within little time. However food quality was very basic & somehow manageable. Chicken pieces were soft & gravy was lite spicy. Side dishes tasted good where rice tasted average. Quantity wise all the dishes were average.

With very basic food quality & little higher prices this one is not for foodies. But a simple dinner with family or loved once can be done over here.

Sonamati Restaurant is one of the old restaurants in Behala. Located between Behala Thana and 14no. this place is not that difficult to find. The place serves multi cuisine. The service is little slow. The staffs are friendly but not skilled. The ambience is not that good, the lights are too dim. The quality of food is okay but the price which they are taking is comparatively high. Have been to this place many a times as it is near to my place. Things have changed now and there are lot of restaurants which serves good food in less price.
A decent place, but there are many other options open for you.

Well I'm no food specialist, but I can share my today's experience of this restaurant.
1. Ambience was not mind blowing, but good enough.
2.service was good ( maybe because of me being the only customer at that time üòù)
3. Food quality: so so...neither too good, nor too bad (satisfies the price , I think)
4. Worst part : took ice cream.( well this was the biggest mistake according to me...3 scoop of ordinary vanilla ice cream for 60 Rs !!! That's a deal breaker.)  

Overall: tried today... Will definitely try a few more times before writing a trashy review.

One of the oldest restaurant in behala. This restuarent also provides catering service if desired by some one. This place offers an array of dishes from the Indian and Chinese cuisine and price is reasonable to say the least. But, their service and staff is a big let down.

In food I like the Golden fried prawn very much. These are fried nicely and has the right golden glow which is characteristic of the dish.

Other than that I prefer Szchewan chowmin and Chilly chicken in main course.
From the Indian options I prefer their chicken do piyaza coupled with butter naan that gives the right flavors.

Was my FAVORITE food joint during my college days. We used to visit this place very week and order their Sonamati Special noodles and Sprite chicken. The noodles costs only 100 bucks and had ample amount of noodles, egg, chicken, prawns in it and a poached egg on top of it! The sprite chicken was very very good in taste and in quantity as well. I had a soft corner in my heart for their blue lagoon. Missing those good old days.

THOUGH A WELL DECORATED RESTAURANT BUT LACKS PROFESSIONALISM HEAVILY.
THE MENU CARD ITSELF HAS HUGE NUMBER OF SPELLING MISTAKES.
SERVICEWARE IS ALSO BACKDATED.
FOOD AND SERVICE DOES NOT SATISFY EITHER.
HOPE FOR A BETTERMENT AND WISH TO VISIT AGAIN.

Nice place.
Quality and quantity is fine.
The ambience is average.
I had Veg Fried Rice and Thai Chicken.
I would say a decent place.
They don't take any tax.

Its a spacious restaurant serving both Chinese and north indian food. We have ordered a starter dish of fried chicken(cant remember the exact name)chicken fried rice, chicken Manchurian, butter nun, chicken butter masala. Chinese dishes were okay type. But the chicken butter masala was awful, worthless, we smelled coconut paste. Quantity is good. But the taste should be improved. Otherwise pocket friendly.

Want to have good food in behala?
DO NOT GO TO SONAMATI RESTAURANT.
cold food is their speciality. The flavours seldom corresponds with the item in the menu.
I even faintly remember one of my friends finding a cockroach in his fried rice. Truly Chinese delicasy! :D

There are hardly any flaws in this restaurant... From ambience inside the restaurant to it's take away everything is jst so perfect. I'm a regular visitors to the place. They also give a welcome drink and the quantity and quality is much more than what you pay for them!!!
Just as i say worth the money and yes you got to try the soups and the Chinese food!!!

had a pathetic dinner at Sonamati...i had to give a score and seems like i cnt go below 1....and even this score is only because of the location of the place...everything in this place right from food quality to service is pathetic...

you will feel great when you reach the place since its right on the main road opposite 14 no. bus stand stoppage in Behala...well lit entrance with LED...thats it...the ride to hit the bottom starts from there...you enter a under lit huge sitting area...where the decor is very very simple and average....i say so since so much could have been done....when you get so much space but alas the owner lacks interest and creativity it seems....then you get the boring same cafeteria style seating where the glass tops are extremey dirty, they are mopped with dirty clothes it seems as the stained water marks shows all over...immediately we were turned off...

the menu card again has a very average design...in a spiral binding with lots of options divided in chinese and indian cuisine...and under every category that you can think of...we ordered crispy fried chicken, butter garlic naan, chicken nazakat (recommended by the order taker) chicken biriyani and a mutton masala for parcel...also ordered a thumps up...

orders were served quickly, crispy fried chicken were thin strips of chicken fried is some batter, it tasted ok was certainly not crispy...qty was good, we were given bowls of tomato and chilli sauce which was very dirty too...

initially we were told that they are out of biriyani and then 5 mins later they said they can serve it...offcourse when it came and we at half a spoon, i can make out it was a jhatka biriyani or a quick 3 mins tossed biriyani with chicken and basmati rice, full of kewra water and oil....wat morons to serve such a thing....i complained and they shamelessly took the item away acting surprised when i said its a dupicate stuff :)) lolzzz....

the chicken nazakat was a similar sad dish...some old gravy, super dry with undercooked chicken tikkas and topped with fried onions....sweet and not spicy at all while it was supposed to be spicy as per the order taker...so either he knows shit about his menu or the chef goofed up...then came the huge butter garlic naan, looked very tempting but full of oil in the name of butter and may be one clove of garlic minced in a huge bread which means it lacked the distinct flavor of garlic...

3/4th way to our dinner, came the glass of thumps up after asking for it twice, seems like they were cooking it too in the kitchen...that ¬†to practically half empty restaurant during a peak time on a saturday...

finally when the bill came, they still charged for the authentic london biriyani and charged 20 bucks more for a mutton dish which i didnt ordered...they argued and removed the biriyani and i paid and told them that they are shameless to serve such bad bad food...the owner was in the counter and listened with an uninterested face....so even if he reads this review, he will care less.....its a restaurant where waiters talks to the kitchen staff shouting from the guest area and get responded in a same manner...so lots of things not working fine for this place and no wonder its hardly full given its location and potential...

may be they serve good chinese but you know what, i will never go back to taste that...they just lost a potential customer and hopefully with this review, lost some prospective ones too

This is a pocket bomb in behala serving North Indian n Chinese cuisine at low price.The place is very small but it makes up for the quality of food they serve there.I've tried the Chinese cuisine here..The dishes were crispy chicken,hot garlic chicken,gravy noodles n schezuan fried rice.All the items tasted very good.

Sonamati.. Located just opposite to behala 14no.bus stand.  Ambience is decent and when i visited,  they used to give welcome drinks which were mostly jal jeera.  Now coming to the food,  i always had indian dishes here.  So indian dishes you must try are paneer butter masala,  kashmiri alu dam and paratha.  Also you can try blue lagoon and masala coke.  Budget is ok but the food arives late.  Staffs are attentive. Would recomend for casual dine.

This place has detoriated over the time and both the quality and quantity has fallen drastically. Generally , renovation results in the betterment of a place but for this place it has worsen. The staffs took down my birthday details as well and said they will wish me but alas! no wish came from their side. Then why does they promise such things which they cant keep. The food is average and the seating arrangements are decent. But they should say what they can deliver and not say such things which are beyond their capacity.

Sonamati has never disappointed with the quantity and quality of food. Over years they have maintained it. Now they have shifted to much bigger space but I personally liked the earlier space better, it was way too cozy than the current one. They serve authentic Indian chinese. They need to make the restaurant floor a little more personal & decent and not let any and everyone walk in inside the restaurant, i mean the secondary staffs. 

The biggest grievance I have on them is their Biryani, or lack of it. I have looked for Biryani atleast 4-5 occassions, and everytime they say "ektu agey sesh hoye geche" / "it's over". Even at 8pm I didn't get it, which is not acceptable when you are running a reasonably popular restaurant in a place like Behala 14 No. They need to understand that Biryani is quite a popular dish and a favorite across all visitor, so need to keep it available even after 9.30pm.

Such a wastage of space and reputation of restaurants in and around behala.....Some of the waiters should be kicked out immediately if they don't want to ruin their reputation and the chef should taste all the food before it reaches the customer's table...Some r really nauseating...1.5 for location, a.c  and sitting place. .

Waiters r busy warching tv.. response is pathetic.... most of the time majority of items in the menu are not available...
You ask for biryani... and there is an unwanted suggestion that fried rice will be a better option... i mean whats the need to sugest a customer who want to eat mughlai to go for chineese...

The management needs to pull up their socks to avoid loosing the fan following

Well Looking forward to visit this restaurant very soon next Month.... Heard the food is very good so is the quantity.
.

Finally my visit to this place on January 1st ,2015.
It was my friends birthday and very unfortunate that i was sick. Thou after watching Movie "PK" we decided to visit this place. It was 6.30 pm so we chose to have something very light and just for a taste. As i expected the restaurant was quite fine lots of seats to be grabbed. It was decorated with balloons and ribbons with full A.c. Ambiance was a satisfactory but disappointed with the chair, very less space to get in and get out.. We got our seat instantly as it was quite empty. We took a Mix rice and Thai chicken. ¬†Mix rice was ok could have been better but the quantity was really good for for serving two people. Thai chicken was really good. Very Spicy and i can feel the chilly and sourness. It also included small prawn in the gravy. So finally my visit to this place was good but will visit again for having a good lunch someday. I give 7.5/10.

The restaurant is spacious and the decor is of good disposition.The menu is standard and the day‚Äôs specials included 11 dishes (both Indian and Chinese cuisines). Many had recommended us to try out the Sprite Chicken of Sonamati so we ordered it on the side of ‚ÄúSonamati Special Soup‚Äù. Their delivery was prompt with two bowls of hot and steaming soups right before us in just 10 minutes. In terms of presentation, we were really impressed. It looked like a bowl of Snow. Inside the innocent Snow White presentation, however, was an effusion of flavours that hits you unexpectedly and charms you equally. 

The chicken also arrived as soon as we finished our soup. It must be mentioned that our goal was to have a light supper but the soup was heavy and by the time we had the chicken we were full. Therefore, we gotta give a thumbs up to the guys for quantity. In terms of quality, the Soup was awesomelicious, however the chicken was more of a disappointment (may be because we had high expectations build on it in the first place). It was ordinary, like any other spring chicken, except more on the hotter side. The best part though, is the price chart. From college students to a big fat Indian family, Sonamati is for the classes as well as the masses.
