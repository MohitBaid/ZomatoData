I went here one day after college. We were a group of three people. We had noodles, chicken manchurian and fish tikka kababs. The quantity as well as the taste was good. The ambiance is pleasant.

Visited here today for a family dinner, they made us wait for an hour before managing an empty table! We had ordered mixed fried rice, smoked fish, hot garlic chicken and another chicken preparation whose name I don't exactly remember! The fried rice was just bland, filled with prawn, egg and almost non-existent chicken, didn't like it much! The smoked fish was expected to be dry but it came with gravy, nonetheless, delectable, the other chicken item tasted quite nice too, the hot garlic chicken, a bit spicy, was more or less alright, the quantity they gave was quite filling, the prices are inclusive of tax, had a moderate experience all together!

Bewn here a long time ago. Food was good but there are a lot of options to choose from in this particular area. So they have to improve their quality. Tried boti kebab, murg tufani masala and pulao. Food was ok nd the interior is well enough spacious for a family dinner!!

Mom got me a surprise by bringing Chicken Reshmi Kebab and Chicken biryani from this place. The kebabs were succulent and nice and came with the usual mint dip. The biryani was decent in quantity with an egg sliced into two pieces and a large piece of potato and chicken but the taste wasn't very appealing. It was a tad bit oily than I actually like so I found it quite okayish.

Went to this place today. It's situated in Lords More in the lane to the left of Shawarma Nation. Not much interior. It can be seen from the road itself (from golf green to lords more).  It's a small restaurant with a capacity of around 20 people.

We had ordered (chicken) drums of heaven, butter nan and mutton keema matar. Drums of heaven was kind of okay. It had a little bit more salt than necessary though. Butter nan was average. It wasn't soft enough and had no damn hint of butter. 1 nan is enough for a person with medium appetite. Mutton keema matar was the worst item. It was tasteless. Maybe the mutton wasn't fresh enough. Also, it had neither keema nor matar. Prices are tax inclusive. Our total bill was ‚Çπ620.

Ambience is extremely average. Waiters aren't well dressed and well versed with the dishes. You can't ask them for suggestion as they seem confused. At this price one can easily find many other standard restaurants (with proper ambience and food quality) to dine in. Service is slow. There are just 2 waiters. They were even taking time to fetch the bill. This place IS STRICTLY NOT recommended.
P.S- This is the lowest rating I have given in zomato till date!

This restaurant is situated near Lords more( a stoppage next to South city mall ).
The restaurant is located in a small lane. It is a small restaurant that can accomodate 25-30 people together. The space is a bit issue here and the interiors bore minimal decorations and dim lights.
They offer both North Indian and Chinese cuisines.

We went for North Indian cuisine. We have ordered for-

1) Special Mutton Biryani ( It contained 2pieces of mutton, one aloo and one egg. So, there was aloo that's yay and mutton pieces were full of fat that's strictly a no no. The rice of the Biryani was also not that good, I mean I have had better biryani before and the biryani rice felt a bit sticky. So, I was a bit dissapointed. )

2) Chicken reshmi kebab ( No complain about this one. This was cooked to perfection and the chicken pieces were good in proportion and meaty. Good one. Was served with salad and pudina chutney.)

3) Chicken tikka kebab (Served with salad and pudina chutney this kebabs were a bit on the spicy side but tasted really good. Infact we loved this one over reshmi kebabs. The chicken pieces were tender and well charred. I happen to like this one to every bits.)

Staffs were courteous. They asked us whether we enjoyed our meal and asked for any kind of feedback. So, that's kind of appreciated. Service is a bit slow. Had a good experience there. Will drop there someday to try their kebabs.

Today i had lunch here.
I was overwhelmed after seeing the ratings about its ambience and food quality.
Do not judge it by its capacity.near about 20 people can sit here at a time.But i like food quality and calm ambienece.
We ordered
1) 1 chicken biryani(with 1 egg,1 potato and 1 pc chicken)
2)1 chicken hakka noodles
3)Golden smoked chicken(12pcs)
Everthing was good enough.
I like their Biryani most.
Quantity was more than enough for two..
Golden smoked chicken was also good.
Servicing was very promt and staffs were really good.
Overall very good experience.

Walked along with a friend to try out this place after watching a movie at South City. This place is just near to the Lords more crossing. Ambiance is decent, not a very big place to be honest but can contain 20 people at one time. There is nothing much to speak about the interiors and looks about the place.¬†
We ordered Non Veg gravy noodles with chicken Manchurian. Noodles was very nice, the thick gravy made it a bit tough to eat but equally tasty on the other hand. Contained good amount of veggies and chicken. Chicken Manchurian was decent enough to make us happy. Overall both the dishes were very fine as per the rates are concerned. Service is good and prompt.

The Lords is located right at the four point crossing at Lords More beside Shawarma Nation. This restaurant serves great North Indian, Chinese as well as Thai food. Their Biryani is one of the best dishes and the kebabs taste heavenly. I have visited this restaurant only once after hearing reviews from friends and I surely want to keep coming back here time and again. 
The service is impressive, price is unexpectedly reasonable considering the location. The presentation of the food items are commendable. Though the dining area is quite ordinary but the food makes you forget about every other detail. They maintain good hygiene as well. It's easy to locate, hence I would suggest everyone to visit this place.

If you want a pocket friendly meal then definitely u should give it a try. They do charge vat & service tax.

This place isn't high on the decor, ambience and the looks. But it makes up for it with its food and prompt service.

It's located right on the Lords more on Prince Anwar Shah road and is quite easy to identify. 
I am posting this after almost 3 visits to this restaurant and the review will be on the overall experience. 

The service here is to the point and so is the food. I have had their biriyani and their Chinese dishes ; Drums of heaven, fried rice, prawn manchurian and chilli chicken. 

I understood that they are better with the Chinese dishes than the North Indian/ Mughlai dishes.

They serve a very good quantity of rice prawns and chicken . So a plate of fried rice, prawn manchurian and chilli chicken is sufficient for 2 people. And the cost would just amount to about Rs.800.

So, try it out. You will enjoy the food without making a hole in your pocket.

Went there a week ago. It's located exactly beside buddha bites. We ordered Singapore rice non veg, sanghai chicken, fresh lime soda sweet and thumbs up. Quantity was good bt quality wise too poor to eat. Prawns used in rice were not fresh at all, chicken was thickly coated by cornflower batter. So we had less chicken more cornflower and the lime was was not made by soda at all. It was lemon water. Suggesting not to visit.

Went there recently with friends. Situated at lord's more, the interior was nice. We ordered tandoori roti, chicken reshmi butter masala, chicken reshmi kabab, fried rice and schezwan chicken. The kabab was very soft. One plate rice can satisfy two people. The chicken was also good. Overall, a nice place.

Its a small joint with 6 - 7 tables, yet cozy and comfortable arrangement. Service is good, prompt, interactive to know ur choice and taste, smiling waiters. Food is simply awesome... we tried varieties of starters that evening and each one of them are unique and great taste. They can custom prepare the dish considering if u have kids with you (non spicy if u preffer). Low on budget. You can comfortably park ur car in by lanes.

Enough in quantity for a single person. 
It was well done and taste wise it was fine. 
Try once if you haven't tried it at all.

It was a place I frequently visited with school friends for lunch after a get together at recently opened south city mall.During that time it was difficult to have something in proper lunch from south city with our pocket money.So we gorged on junk foods from KFC,PHD during our adda sessions in food court and later come here for a budget lunch.We used to have only Indian dishes for lunch.Food was good..nothing extraordinary.But quantity used to be large.Tandoori chicken and kababs were really nice.Other things that we frequently ordered were chicken bharta,peas polao,naan etc.The ambience was ordinary and very low in lighting that time.

I did not like the kebabs. Will rate it 2/5.
Mixed Fried Rice was good - 3.5/5.

As the name suggests this place is located at lord's more beside shawarma nation, Buddha bites. Been here on one of my friends birthday treat. We ordered drums of heaven as starter, which was absolutely fingerlicking. As main dish we ordered one American, and one Chinese chopsuey, one was sufficient for two and as side dish we ordered golden chicken.
Ambience was overall okey. Service was prompt.

The Lords is a delightful little place tucked away in a little corner from Lords more. We chanced upon it in our search for a place to hold a farewell lunch for a colleague. It doesn't boast of much space inside but is quite cosy. They offer both Indian and Chinese cuisine and the food is delicious. The Drums of Heaven as starters were heavenly as was the kadhai chicken and mutton Kasa. The becti in butter garlic sauce was sumptuous as was the biriyani. The staff have a pleasing personality and served with a smile. All in all a good place to go for a treat and the prices are quite reasonable. Will be visiting again and again.

Today we ordered lunch from this outlet and the food was decent.

Below is what we ordered and the observations:

Chilly Chicken-We wanted it be extra spicy and it turned out well. The only thing which was a let down was the size of the chicken pieces which was way too small.

Veg Fried Rice-It had a decent portion size and was very well sufficient for more than 2 people (good enough for 2.5 people as we are small eaters). It also had sufficient amount of vegetables.

Garlic Prawn-It had decent sized prawn pieces and tasted fresh and good.

No comments about decor,ambience etc as the food was home delivered.

Price wise the total came to Rs.615/- including VAT which was ok.

Good food, pleasing flavors and acceptable pricing, these are all the things that work for The Lords.
The place has been around for almost a decade or more now and has not fallen back on serving quality food. It has been recognized for its Chinese and occasional Thai spreads. While the place also serves some very good North Indian food, I generally stick to the Chinese options.
My patent order, most of the times I am visiting or ordering in food are the mixed gravy noodles and the devil's chicken. The quality of the noodle itself is great. Smooth and thick, enters your mouth in one easy slurp. The gravy accompanying the noodle is equally great, the veggies are fresh and the proteins are abundant.

The devil's chicken is 12pscs of absolute bliss. The fact that they fry the chicken right before they add it to the sauce, makes so much difference. I will surely recommend this place to people, who are looking for a quick meal with family or friends, without wanting to blow their weekly budget up.

Lunch yesterday brought us here. It's a cramped place, yes, but the food is quite value for money, so nothing else matters. 
We had tandoori chicken, chicken reshmi kebab, chicken and mutton biriyani, mutton do piyaza, chicken tikka masala. The bill (which included added taxes) came to rupees 1515. Quite affordable for all the items ordered. 

Now, regarding the taste, the chicken dishes tasted nice, didn't enjoy the mutton much, although my friend loved it, so I suppose it's a matter of opinion. The kebabs were good, nothing spectacular, but good. The biriyani was quite ample in quantity, although the special mutton biriyani is extravagantly priced at 230 rupees. The biriyani comes with an egg and the customary potato. Overall, this place is quite satisfactory, particularly if you can get takeout and avoid the cramped up space and the steep staircase.

We often get food home delivered from this place when getting together at our place. I particularly like their smoked chicken (pieces of chicken cooked with spicy sauce and lemon leaf flavour). Their noodles and other dishes are good as well. However, biryani is not upto the mark and lesser in quantity compared to the price. On one occasion I had eaten inside the place and did not like the ambiance at all. Lighting is very low and space is extremely cramped. On many occasions I had opted for a takeaway as well. Their person in charge of security is very kind and offers me a chair to sit every time I do a takeaway.¬†

Food- 4/5

i have been visiting this place since my high school days way back in 2010. i must admit it is the best restaurant in south kolkata. they certainly have a standard quality well maintained almost for a decade. the price is a bit on the higher side but reasonable considering the quality and quantity of the food . i prefer their mutton biriyani over Arsalan. they will never disappoint you with the taste. ou can trust my recommendations.

STARTERS RECOMMENDED:¬†
smoked chicken ( my all time favourite and a must have ), smoked fish, honey pepper chicken, crispy chilli babycorn, Irani kebab is unique, chicken reshmi kebab and many more like hot and sour soup.

MAIN COURSE:
i am mad for their kashmiri pulao. mutton biriyani, mutton kasa, chicken reshmi, tikka and irani masala. chicken bharta, chicken tandoori butter masala.
fried rice, chilli chicken, garlic chicken, chicken choupsey. but honestly i dont like their paneer. fish begum bahar is an exquisite dish. ¬†
ACCOMPANIMENTS:
pineapple raita is a must with indian dishes.

but sometimes they do disappoint me with unavailable items. service is nice. i wish the place was a little more comfy.¬†

This was one of the first restaurants I tried at Lords more. They have a small but comfy sitting place on the first floor. I used to go regularly before they renovated the place but nowadays am not able to visit that frequently. 
The service is fast enough. The food is tasty, especially the chopsuey!

Their food has an unmistakable sense of consistency to it. You could order their food everyday and still get their excellent taste. Their prices very fair and the quantity is good as well.¬†

We opted for a take away option. Our order included a Kashmiri pulao, handi gosht, chicken fried rice and chicken in bbq sauce. The pulao was good and so was the gosht. The fried rice was pretty normal but there is lots of scope for improvement in chicken in BBQ sauce.

I went there on a Sunday evening but didn't find the place crowded like I expected. The restaurant is actually very conveniently located. Not on the main road, but just 10 metres inside.

For some reason, they had switched off their tandoor (pardon me if that's not the correct term to use), but the waiter was kind enough to turn it on again for one full tandoori chicken we ordered. The chicken tasted good, it was well cooked and juicy. Value for money.

One of my friends had crispy chili baby corn and I had some of it. It tasted good. Nothing very special about it. I've had better baby corn at other places.

The ambience is good and the staff is extremely courteous.¬†

Update : (Day 2) Tried out their Chicken Reshmi Kebab today. Nothing very special about it. Quite average. The Chicken Fried Rice and Chili Baby Corn were good. The baby corn was slightly crispy (just the way I like it), and it was enough for two people, but it was a bit low on gravy. The fried rice was not really enough for two people. Value for money though.

Day 3 : Tried out their Biriyani. They serve it to you with a big aloo, some fried onion on top (not a fan of this), and a boiled egg cut in half. All this is okay, but since they give you all this, the amount of rice they serve is very less. My friend and I shared two plates of Biriyani, I had one and one-fifth of the other, but I still wasn't full. The rice tasted good, but they should really increase the quantity.

Of all the restaurants I've had food from, this restaurant gave me the most unappetizing food, I'm sorry. The starters are okay-ish. the main course I just cant keep it down ever. Everytime I thought may be it was a mistake last time so lets try again..but nooo! It's really heart-breaking to say that I do not like the food at all!!

PS:
¬†I ordered daal makhani: which tasted like burnt oil,twice, after requesting to replace it.
and its a huge list....

Cute, cozy and value for money. Located exactly opposite to lake gardens mother dairy this power house comprises vast options to choose from. Located on the first floor, this is my second visit to this place after a 4 year gap. Prices haven't increased that much. Quantity and quality both gets thumbs up. My group of 7 people went for lunch and went out with full stomach within 2500 INR including beverages. Personally i liked the crispy chilly baby corn, pan fried noodles and chicken clear soup.

Large portions, tasty and inexpensive food is what you get at The Lords. Although the restaurant isn't that huge, but it surely has a lot of potential. Because they maintain the quality and the taste of whatever they serve. Be it Indian or Chinese. This restaurant satiates my cravings on a lazy weekend. :)

Situated near the Southcity mall its a great place to have lunch or dinner with family and friends. I have been here during the durga pujo and I was pleased that the Quality of the food was up to my expectations, good and fresh.

PROS:::::::::::::::::
>The place is nice tidy and clean.
>Both Chinese and Indian cuisine available and prepared well.
>Food Quality is good and it doesn't deteriorate during the festive seasons.
>The service is fast and precise.
>Ambiance is good .

CONS::::::::::::
>The special menu served during the festive seasons doesn't have much items . I was a little¬† disappointed. 
>NOW the most important part for college students like me. After the price of the item , there is 14% VAT (AND) 5.6% SERVICE TAX. So be prepared to come out with a full tummy and a lighter wallet. 
I had a chicken biriyani , chicken friedrice and schezwan chicken , and I was quite happy with the taste and quality.
Enjoy :)

This multicuisine restaurant is one of the many food outlets at Lords crossing which is fast becoming one of the prime food hubs of the city. Went to this place for the very first time yesterday and it did perform well above my expectations!! The restaurant is located on the first floor and is quite spacious and has a pleasant and cosy feel to it...seats are also comfortable.The mixed gravy noodles which I had ordered was delectable and quite delicious.It tasted well and was really enjoyable in terms of quality and should be definitely tried if someone happens to be at this place. The manchurian chicken ordered alongside was also decent enough. Overall a good place to be at and it offers a pleasant and delightful experience..but it could have been cheaper and prices are indeed a bit on the higher side.

I never realized that this restaurant exists. Today also we had no expectation before visiting. We ordered 'Roasted Chilly Lamb' for starters, and it stole the show! T'was damn tasty and had 12 pieces of lamb meat! Then we ordered 'mushroom onion mixed fried rice & kung pao chicken'. The rice was exceptional. It was light and deliciously prepared and the quantity was also very generous. Pocket pinch was moderate (720).
Overall experience is very good in terms of Chinese Cuisine but I guess their North Indian would be good too. Any case, I will visit pretty soon.

We had visited this joint about a month back, so, wouldn't know if there's been any deterioration in quality between then and now. This review is based on the experience we had then.

My advice to my fellow foodies would be to stick to the North Indian cuisine here. We tried their Kebabs and they were simply mouth watering. The Biryani was also standard - not inedible and neither wonderful.

Overall a pretty decent experience.

Located in the lords more, The Lords is a small cozy place and well decorated. Since this joint is close to place to my place so I've been to there few times and have ordered for home delivery as well. The food at The Lords is good, I love their Biriyani, it's not at all spicy, less oil and the way they cut the egg and the small size of onion they serves I just like it. Apart from Biriyani I'd recommend to try fish fingers and tandoori dishes, they're good in North Indian. The service is good and the price is also reasonable.

My office is al the Lords crossing of prince Anwar shah road.We are a office full of foodies.And by the Grace of God,the Lords crossing,with the neighbouring South City Mall and Tollygunge which also houses our very own cafe has become a food hub,a food lovers paradise.

The Lords is a comparitively older place and we use it mostly as a takeaway joint.But in a city obsessed with biryani from Shiraz,Aminia,Arsalan and Royal in that order,the Lords also serve a mean mutton biryani.And complimented with an equally good chicken chaap and mutton korma,we are used to lazy lunches at the earliest provocation for a celebration.Thank the Lord for that......

Located as the name suggests in the lord's crossing of Anwar Shah road it's a very comfy and decent family restaurant.. well don't expect it to be like a 5 star restaurant with glam interiors and stuff.. nevertheless its a very cozy little place if you're looking to spend not more than 500-600 bucks for 2.. the best thing about the place is its home delivery, always on time if you're staying nearby and also the takeaways.. dimly lit interiors make it a very soothing ambiance.. so if you're dropping by for a regular dinner/lunch with a reasonable pocket pinch then drop by here.. food is not the best of the lot or made by master chefs but if you look from the value for money aspect its very good.. try the kebabs and the north indian, chinese cuisines...

I visited this place for a couple of times, located in the prince Anwar shah road and as the name suggests at lords crossing. This a very cosy and simple place.. Ambience is not a thing to talk about here. It's simple but a humble place. Actually saying it's a Chinese restaurant and also North Indian. And I would recommend to try the smoke fish or smoke chicken. Even I will recommend you to try their fish fingers which are full with fish.If you try it once you will surely want another one. Fried rice or noddles are very regular and cooked with a very little amount of oil. You can order schezwan chicken or garlic chicken which is well cooked here. But service is very late. And should work on it. A pocket friendly

The food is brilliant. When I say brilliant don't expect chef's special showing up from the kitchen but nonetheless its more that decent.

The dining area is cozy and dimly lit which adds up to the overall experience.

One downside is the service. Not up to the mark.

Delicious Chinese as well as Mughlai food.Try out their koshe kosha gosht..its just amazing.The mutton is well cooked and so soft that it'll melt in your mouth.Even fish amritsari is very good.One can also try out the reshmi kebab.They spread some white creamy layer on top of it..Inall its a must visit place

I would rate this restaurant only on the Biriyani which is feel is a bit unique. Its a blend between the traditional Lucknowi style biriyani (the kind of biriyani that we Calcuttans are used to having available in most places) and the Hyderabadi spicy style and I seriously love the taste. If I'm not wrong till a few years back they used to give small button balls with the Biriyani rice, but the last time I had it was missing. Other items are quite standard (you cant really be below standard with the number of food joints around that place ). And yes, the chicken tandoori is also better than most others around that area.

Recently order chicken Lajwabab and butter naan. The chicken dish was pretty substantial and comprised of tandoori chicken pieces soaked in ¬†a fiery red rich gravy. It was pretty tasty but dripping in oil. Definitely not for the faint-hearted. Prices are reasonable though. The chicken dish and two butter naans came to Rs 330/-including taxes.Not bad i say.
This joint has been around for quite sometime now. Though it happens to be my neighbourhood joint, yet never quite managed to check it out. Recently availed of the¬†¬†home delivery facility. I had ordered butter naan, dal makhni, veg jhalfrezie and chicken reshmi butter masala. To my pleasant surprise the delivery person was at my doorstep within 20 minutes in spite of a heavy storm brewing outside. Kudos to that. Now coming on to the food. The dal makhni was a tad too spicy and oily, otherwise taste was fine. The veg jhalfrezie was okayish. The good aspect of the dish was that it had adequate mix of vegetables-carrot, beans, green peas, cauliflower, onion and cubes of paneer. No veggie was in excess, thus the taste of the dish was balanced. The chicken item floored me literally. It was perfect to say the least. Reshmi kebabs of chicken soaked in white cashew paste based gravy was yum indeed. The butter naans could have been flakier and softer though. All items mentioned above came with a bill of Rs 515/-. Give it a try. Not a bad bet at all.

I've been to this place "n" number of times since 2009. From south city if you are going towards sarovar, the next crossing after South city is the Lords stoppage. You have a steep staircase leading to the sitting area of the restaurant. The ambience is good. You don't get a view of the outside lanes as the windows are covered. The cool, calm and a bit dark room give you a great relief if it's summer. There is no apparent decoration and the washroom is too small.¬†

I've tried non veg Biriyanis, laccha parathas, butter nuns, chicken reshmi butter masala, chicken tikka, palak chicken, ¬†non veg hakka noodles, chicken chilly, chicken sweet and sour Food here is undoubtedly good but my favourites are as follows:
1) Laccha paratha2) Chicken reshmi butter masala (only if you like sugar in your dish)

This restaurant do not add any tax to your bill and the service is good. The pricing is pretty much okay. I'm a besotted Lords lover and thereby I suggest you to visit this place soon. :)

Great food, value for money.

We ordered chicken spicy fry for starters, and butter naan and murg makhan tikka for main course. The starter was very tasty, served at the perfect temperature. The naan is pretty big, so if you have a small appetite, beware. The quantity is more than enough for 2 people. Service was quick, and the ambience was okay too. Good place to go when you just want to gorge onto food.

Edit: on my second visit, I ordered honey pepper chicken, which tasted really good. Loved the sweet spicy flavou
r, the presentation could've been better though. For main course I had tandoori lazeezi handi, which I didn't really like. Maybe it's just me, or the sesame seeds gave it a bitter taste.

The tandoori chicken is good here. I ordered that on my subsequent visit.

Visited yestrrday for lunch. The lamb items are very good. Took a starter and a main course of lamb. Both were well prepared and really tasty. But also took chelo kebab and biriyani. The biriyani is average. The chelo kebab is really below average. Othetwise thai rice is good. The advantage is they serve such good quality in affordable price.

The restaurant was visited by me on one of the Durga Puja days to grab a meal and I am delighted by my total experience. The place is not huge but still it very well manages space such that one would not face any inconvenience. The staff are very helpful and friendly and helps you fit in the proper seat. Once again the ambiance is the best that is possible to juggle in the small place. The service they provide is up to the mark. Now about the food. My order included chicken biryani and roast chicken. Every bit of the food is awesome and unlike many places the chicken biryani came with an egg. The quantity is sufficient. Absolutely no reason to complain and loads of reason to appreciate the heavenly experience my taste buds had. The food came with a complementary salad. The salad comprises of finely chopped cucumber, onion rings and carrot dipped in an orange colored saucy mixture(which I know not what) but it tasted yummy. The best part: The place serves good food without much of a pocket pinch :-) !!So enjoy!!

We went to this place around 7pm and it was a moderate experience

----------------------------LOCATION-----------------------------
If you have been to shwarama nation on prince anwar shah road,its not hard to find,the place is just 2mins away,very close to South City Mall,5mins away on feet towards Rabindra Sarobar metro Station from South city mall..

----------------------------AMBIENCE----------------------------
This place is a bit small,hardly 6tables with couch,nothing fancy in decorations,small washroom and you wont have any privacy,not a good place for dinner with your loved ones..
In othee words if you have been to Golden Spoon on park street,its jusg the same..
-------------------QUANTITY N QUALITY-----------------
The quantity is a bit less i felt,1plate is not enough for 2,and it says on menu 12pieces if chicken in a single plate,but in reality the pieces are too small..
Quality is ok nothing too fancy and nothing so tasty also,felt like some ordinary street food corner,but i did like Burnt Garlic Fried Rice,it was really good... 

-----------------------------PRICING-------------------------------
Things We Ordered
1* Chili Garlic Noodles - 115
1* Mixed n Burnt Garlic Fried Rice - 130
1* Hot Garlic Chicken - 170
1* T.C. Chicken (sorry i dont remember the exact name) - 170
We were a group of 4,and we were half filled so it was ok,but you are startving you need more..
The total was - 585inr
+ Vat 14.5% - 85inr
+ service tax - 29inr
Total 699inr
The price is a but much considering the quanity n quality of the food along with ambience..

-------------------BEHAVIOR OF STAFFS------------------
The staffs were good n well behaved,no complains..but we did ask them to lower the ac,but i think they dint

--------------------------CONCLUSION------------------------
As i said earlier,this place is exactly the same like Golden Spoon on park street without the tax part..
Would i love to visit anytime soon??
I dont think so,there are more places to try out on prince anwar shah road and the taste of the food if this place doesnt hold me back..


-----------------------TO THE OWNERS--------------------
Hire a better Cook..
Street food corners provide more delicious food in half the price..

I have been to this place on a lazy Sunday afternoon. It is a cramped up mezzanine floor, with an incredibly misplaced washroom. My friend and i, both were sceptic about the food although for no definite reason. We ordered gravy chowmein and nan with chicken korma. The food was served quick, the waiters were well behaved and the experience was decent. What made my day was the gravy chowmein. Smooth, slippery, cylindrical, lengthy noodles, dipped in the right proportion of the flavourful gravy, with fresh carrots, bell pepper, cabbage and bok choy leaves resulted into an aromatic delight, and passed our expectations way beyond. I will be visiting this place for this culinary delight alone.

I was in the area with a couple of friends last Friday. We decided to have our lunch there. It's a nice but small place.
We decided to order Veg Fried Rice along with Paneer Kandahari and Shanghai Chicken. The service was really quick and the waiter who was serving us was good. He helped us with our selections when we let him know our preferences. i.e. neither too spicy nor too subtle.

The best thing about this restaurant is it's proximity to South City Mall. Also, the prices are extremely reasonable considering it's locale and the portions are sufficient. The food was well-cooked and tasted well.
One of my friends is really particular about how she has her paneer and loved the dish at first tasting. The Chicken dish was better than I expected. We could actually feel the blend of the spices popping in our taste buds. Succulent chicken pieces too.

I had a good experience. It's better than most other restaurants around the Lords' crossing area. Will definitely visit again.

It is a small cosy restaurant in the first floor.There is nothing much to mention about the ambience and decor.It is a small and simple and humble place.
The place offers mainly chinese and Indian dishes.We settled for nan and chicken bharta and chicken kadai.The quality of the food though not exceptional was quite decent.It actually quite exceeded our expectations.The quantity was good too.The service was quite swift and the prices were very moderate.
So overall we were quite satisfied. This is in fact the good part of small little known restaurants-you go in with very little expectations and sometimes you do end up being pleasantly surprised.
Overall this is a decent place which you can try if you happen to be passing by hungry.

Well, the best part about this place is the location which is very near the South City Mall. It's a small, personal type of a restaurant, though it has nothing special about it. 
I have been here twice, yet I don't have any memory of what I ate here(that should give you the clue, and yes I don't have amnesia or stuff like that :p ), except that it was stomach filling in a reasonable price. 
Go there only if you must.

This restaurant is located exactly at Lords crossing and very close to South city mall. It's a small and cosy restaurant on the first floor though the ambience is nothing to write about. The best thing at this restaurant is their north Indian selection on the menu. I loved their chicken tikka kebabs in particular, the chunks were quite soft and flavoursome. My friend enjoyed the chicken biryani a lot. They also have Chinese options though I can't say how good or bad those'll be. The service is pretty quick and you won't have to wait much for the food to arrive. However,there is nothing unique to this place that I would recommend, otherwise this place has impressed me.

I visited Lords restaurant only once.. It is right at the Lords crossing and very near the South City Mall.. The ambience is good and the restaurant is small but cosy in the first floor.. The waiters are friendly but not attentive and the food is good and cheap too..  We ordered Lords special noodles which was wrapped in an omlette. It was good.. The taste was really good and the side dish was chicken manchurian. The chicken manchurian was good but a bit oily.. But I was really dissapointed how inattentive the waiters were.. I ordered kesar pista ice cream but they ended up with butterscotch.. And when I told them they denied.. It was like I never ate butterscotch ice cream and kesar pista ice cream and I don't even know the difference.. Sigh!!!!! Alas I was in no mood to have a talk with them anymore as I was tired.. The overall experience was let down in the dessert department! But the food was good and pocket friendly too.. Do give a visit for the good food if you can dodge the inattentive waiters!

Well, this is really a very nice restaurant near South city Mall. Ambience is pretty good and staff are friendly. I mainly liked their north indian and chinese dishes, dint much like their thai dishes. Crispy chicken and red wine chicken is really vey well prepared and tasty. Quantity is appropriate for 2 to3 people and quality is fresh too. In north indian section fish hariyali and fish lajawab is really scrumptious. On my first visit I was not that impressed but after the second visit I did like their food taste.
I would rate 3.5 for Lords.

The Lord's - though there is a place up-stairs for a sit-down meal, we have always ordered for "Home-Delivery" - which is fast and efficient and normally takes about 30 to 40 minutes. Our favourites remain Tandoori Chicken, Fish Begum-bahar, Chicken Biriyani.

Nice food, good service chinese section is really good for its price but then...it should reduce the price a little bit since its price matches the likes of Hatari but quality,decor, location and its popularity is not even close

I stepped into lords with my girlfriend. It is an average restaurant. The ambiance is good. We ordered mutton biriyani and chicken korma. The price is cheap with respect to the quantity but it needs to upgrade the quality. If they upgrade the food quality, this is a quite good restaurant.
