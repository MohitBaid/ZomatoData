There is nooption for submitting reviews without star so I have to give atleast one star to submit my review.
I ordered food around 11 AM and at 1 PM they told me that I will be receiving the items within 1:30. But after that they just stopped receiving calls. Finally after waiting for another one hour I got the ordered item but without the water bottle and the mouth freshner. Even the biriyani didn't have egg and potato. 
Overall the experience was just pathetic. If you can't taje orders just inform and we can manage from some where else.

They make awesome biryani. Their special combo are worth the money. They deliver on time and the biriyani served was hot and delicious. Most of the joints don't include egg with biryani but they provide egg. I am very satisfied with taste and service. Looking forward to order again.
