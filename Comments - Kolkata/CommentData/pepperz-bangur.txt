This pocket friendly restaurant is located at bangur.
I ordered crispy chilli baby corn and cheese corn pizza via swiggy.
Tastes of the food items were good but if you're an ardent cheese lover then you need to consume the pizza at the restaurant only since the pizza gets hardened over time.
One more thing they serve only vegetarian foods only.

Ordered a cheese penne pasta and took it as a takeaway. On reaching home, found the pasta was still hard, cheese was not cheese but badly prepared white sauce and taste was just out of the world, that is you would not like to have it again, ever.

My all time favourite mayonnaise vada paw from this shop located in C Block of bangur.
For ‚Çπ30 you get value for money vada paw.
It will satisfy your hunger for evening cravings.

A pure vegetarian food joint, in bangur. Pepperz probably is one of the most famous food joints in the locality, a place which is mostly known by all locals of bangur-laketown-dumdum-kankurgachi-ultadanga collectively. It won't be wrong to say that one of the most ordered dish of the place is cheesy vada paw. Cheesy vada paw of pepperz is to die for, and one definitely wants to order a second one after eating. Signature garlic bread of the place is equally yummy and a must order suggestion from me, alongwith mixed sauce pasta. The service however is a bit lousy, and you have to go to remind them about your order.

After reading all reviews, I decided to give this place a visit...average sitting arrangements , casual staff..

Ordered cheesy vada paw and paneer tikka sandwich...the cheesy vada paw tasted good....but it had mayonnaise...not cheese !!

Really disappointed with the paneer tikka sandwich.....the thing which was served to us was neither paneer tikka nor sandwich!
It was served in a hotdog type bun...with a filling of paneer , raw capsicum, onions...tossed with mayonnaise!! It didn't match with the name of the dish!
When we questioned...the management responded that they serve paneer tikka sandwich in this style only!!

I suggest there's lot of scope for improvement for this place!

Its a small outlets at the Bangur Avenue towards the Vip road end. They have what every youngster looks for nowadays in the lights of Pasta, pizza, vada paws, shakes, smoothies and many more. It was a rainy day and i landed up here with cousins. We tried the vada paw and Cold Coffee with ice cream.
Both had a decent taste. They also have combo meals for the school and college kids in some very affordable prices.

The place is good for a quick bite. But only serves vegetarian food. That's the biggest problem. Although you can try Cheesy Pav Bhaji at just Rs. 30 and the ice-cream with brownie which costs around Rs. 80 is also good if you're eating there for the first time.

If u r a garlic bread lover then u cant miss this..
Signature garlic bread was the item we tried..
And it was just awesome..
Now PEPPERS have made a proper arrangement of sitting..
Apart from the garlic bread there are many attractions that you can check out like Italian Vada Paw, Mix Sauce Pasta, And other italian dishes..

They should manage a little on the delivery time..

Overall:
Food: 4
Crowd: 3
Service: 3.5
Pocket Pinch: 2.5

Ordered for home delivery through swiggy. Food was delivered before time. 
Ordered cheese vada pao, cheese sauce spaghetti and cheese garlic bread. 
Cheese vada pao was awesome. Very nicely made. The best vada pao I had in the Laketown Bangur area. 
Cheese sauce spaghetti was a total disappointment. Did not taste good at all. Was a little too salty. 
Cheese garlic bread was good. Soft bread and plenty of cheese. 
All the food items had lots of cheese which is great for me. 
About the packing, placing a tissue paper on the box before placing the food would help to prevent the breads and pao from becoming soggy due to the steam from the hot food. 
Overall I would have given a 4 if not for the cheese spaghetti for the meantime it will be a 3.5.

Spaghetti was third class. Useless dish. Will never recommed having spaghetti here to anyone. 100rs and they serve shit.

Signature garlic bread was average.
Chocolate shake saved us from slanging them. Lol.

You can visit here only for few selected items. Dont even dare to try other items otherwise god save you. 

Few items are vada pao , chocolate shake, cheesy garlic bread. You may or may not try pizza as well. Thats it.

We ordered one olive corn capsicum pizza, one pina colada and a combo of cheesey vada pav, 2 garlic bread and a cold coffee.. firstly I want to highlight that the vada pav is awesome and the cold coffee too.. Best part is every single item is full of cheese..
Food is really really yummy.. ‚ù§
But the place is not too much decorated and also small.

An absolute disastrous experience. Aweful Food. We ordered one Cheese Vada Pav & Spicy Vada Pav. To our utter dismay, we found the vada pav to be stale & utterly sour in taste. The taste of Mayo was not even close to what we call "Mayonnaise". We failed to discover ¬†the essence of Cheese on the Cheese Vada Pav & the spicy vada pav was equally horrible. Even my taste bud questioned my choice so much so that I had to throw the food away right in the dustbin.¬†
Such a wastage of Money.¬†

Okay, I got to know about this fast food corner from Swiggy. Pocket Friendly. A plate of two Vada Pavs come at 50 rupees only. And its yummy! But you might want to avoid the Chocolate Mousse. Its just thick chocolate sauce with no brownie or cake or anything in it. The burgers are good too. They also sell a wide range of maggis.
On my second order, I tried the Chilly Garlic Maggi and it was fine as well.

Please visit for the yummiest hot brownie with ice cream.  Its just mouth watering. The brownies are so creamy and so soft that it just melts in your mouth. The most popular here is the combo of two cheesy bada pav and a brownie with ice cream. The bada pav is so cheesy and tasty. Its too much pocket friendly and tasty. The only drawback is the space which is too much small and cozy.  Max to max 10-12 people can barely adjust in the sitting area. Otherwise its good for money. Recommended for the college students mostly.  Visit here to grab a quick tasty bite ‚ò∫

Have been visiting there since it's inception. It has become quite famous in bangur amongst the other food joints. It's a very small food station and take away was only available previously without any seating. But recently they have managed to make seating seating arrangement right opposite to their shop. The place is small but air conditioned and thats draaging more people.
Coming to the food, it's good and moderately priced as well. Cheesy vada pav is a must have . Garlic beads and brownie are also up to the mark.
This place is perfect to cut your exhaustion and hunger after you adda sessions at bangur/laketown without a pocket pinch. Keep growing!

Know these people from a long time, from their very first opening. Initially it was famous for bombay's vada paw but slowly including number of dishes like shakes, pizzas, garlic bread, pastas, etc, they have made a long menu. Everything is good about this cafe and the friendly behaviour of Vishal bhaiya is applicable. Many go there for his behaviour. I think they should expand themselves and make it more spacious and comfortable.

The weirder part of the eatery is that its separated into two sections, one where you order n the other where you eat, and they are on the opposite side of the lane. So yeah take turns, draw straws when you want to order more for no one's going to come asking if you want more. And be prepared that you would definitely want more! 
We had pasta, chili corn, pizza, pao bhaji sandwich and brownies, and we stopped only because we were stuffed. My personal favorite is the pizza, although the house specialty seems to be the pao sandwich. The brownie was a bit too sweet for my taste n for that i deduct points. Itidakimas!

Bangur is a place where you get mostly veg restaurants due to the population of Marwaris and Gujaratis in the area. My veg friend forced me to have something from this joint.
Ordered Corn Cheese Pizza and Paneer Tikka Sandwich , to be honest the Paneer Tikka Sanwich was not good but the Pizza was yummy. The place is very small and not much of an ambience to talk about.
Overall an average experience.

Bangur is a place where you get mostly veg restaurants due to the population of Marwaris and Gujaratis in the area. My veg friend forced me to have something from this joint.
Ordered Corn Cheese Pizza and Paneer Tikka Sandwich , to be honest the Paneer Tikka Sanwich was not good but the Pizza was yummy. The place is very small and not much of an ambience to talk about.
Overall an average experience.

Previously i had had food at their outlet, which i felt was pretty good and thus rated them 4/5. However today i had ordered for home delivery and i must say, it was a horrific experience.

Firstly, the order reached us about 1.5 hrs late despite several reminders and confirmations. I had decided to return the order but after having a word with the owner, the order was accepted at a discounted value. But all this was of no great advantage, as the food had already gone cold and mushy. It was a total waste of money.

So i would recommend never to go for their home delivery service and stick to their fresh outlet servings.

Pepperz is like a weekly hangout place for most of us residing in the Bangur - Lake Town area. This place has developed from a small stall selling vadaa pavs to a well maintained outlet having a dedicated sitting area. Some must haves in Pepperz include Cheesy Vadaa Pav, Signature Garlic Bread, Cheese Veg Sandwich, Veg Corn Cheese Sandwich, Mixed Sauce Pasta, Cold Coffee with Ice Cream and last but not the least, Brownie with Chocolate sauce and ice cream. This place is an ideal hangout for students. Thumbs up to the staff too!

Loacted in the main market area of bangur ths place is a best fit for people looking for some budgeted food. Famous for its chessy vada pao filled with loads of mayonese is a must try. Cheesy garlic bread nd pasta is good too..never tried any beverage except cold coffee whuch was just average. Worst sitting arrangement, son f u planning to go thr be prepared to stand on road side and eat. All over a good very pocket friendly place to eat some cheesy stuff.

I know the person whi opened this outlet in a small store when i was too young studying at aditya academy. I always came to hear about his struggles. But that struggle is not worth if it doesn't suceeds. Today when i sit and have the items fearlessly being a vegetarian. That's cause of this. Awesome food quality. Price is okayish. But at the end. Taste is all that matters. And yes it gives you what you need. Thanks for your service.

Located at the centre of the most populated part of Bangur Avenue area makes this place easily accessible to all of us. If you want to have an evening or occasional snack where vada paw is also a part, this is the place where you can drop by. It has various varieties to choose from.  Both take away and have it options are available.
Cheese vada paw and garlic bread are the two items that I'd recommend to my friends & zomatorians.. That's all!

Will love to hear back your views..

The only two things which are delicious and eatable are Chessy Vada Paw and Cheese Garlic Bread. On spot eating is just fine but for home delivery they are always late and the food becomes super cold, and in case its raining then it becomes super wet. The Mixed sauce pasta was below average both in terms of quality and quantity and it tasted just like sunfeast red sauce pasta and there was no sign of veggies in it. Whenever we try to order babycorn they themselves say that it is not tasty and thus do not take the order. So I wonder why have they still kept it on their menu.

The service is very quick and maximum five mins your order is placed until and unless the order is really huge. A dining space is also opened but I feel it should be air conditioned. Overall nice.

The stars are low because of little or no dining space. Plus due to some of the fooding items available.
The wai wai, garlic bread, mocktail, cheese balls and nachos are just wonderful. You will yearn for more.
Whereas on the other hand, the pasta needs to revamped completely. No taste at all.
Nevertheless a good place to hangout with friends and families.

What a bull shit. This outlet people first tell them to please learn how to make vada pav and then sell.
Horrible food filled with only mayonise instead of cheese and then they proud to call it Cheese vada pav.
I am a big foodie and had read good reviews for this shop as I was passing by so thought of giving it a try.
So ordered a cheese vada pav and a cheese garlic bread.
Already prepared garlic breads were served within just two minutes of order all full of mayonise and when the cheese vada pav came I was stunt to see an aloo tikki stuffed in between the buns and they say it to be vada pav.
I guess they need a revision on their food recipes.
Highly not recommended

Sadly the ratings just go till 5 not more than that otherwise I would have given it more than that it truly deserves it. There is just one problem that there is no place to sit and have food. Ignoring that THE CHEESY VADA PAV & THE SIGNATURE GARLIC BREAD is the yummiest. Your stomach will get full crave for more and more you can never satisfy your wish here, it keeps on increasing by every bite of vada pav. Its very very reasonable and the best place for students. Too pocket friendly. I just love it every time you think about the vada pav you'll have water in your mouth. Its very tasty.  Best thing is quality of food never decreases and Vishal bhaiya is also very friendly. üôåüôå

Honest review, this place is an overrated money sucking pit. They sell you veg food at prices higher than what you generally pay for non veg food. And the food quantity is not worth the the price either. If you are economical and value money for food and you have good rational thinking power, you will avoid this place just after looking at the pricing and the food being offered at that price. Even the people of Bangur don't like this place much. At least the sensible people don't. The only ones coming here are filthy rich marwaris in and around bangur looking to throw excess money at the food being offered. 40 INR for a vada paw is not something acceptable to a sensible economical person. This place is just another example of all that glitters is not gold. AVOID THIS PLACE if you want things worth the bucks you are shelling out. Although the food quality is at par but still a suggested miss.

Pepperz is one of those small little shops that simply has not got its due. I was told about this place by a colleague who knows I am a hardcore foodie and suggested I drop in since he was aware I was going to Bangur for some work. Its a tint unassuming shop that you have to look for as its slightly off the main road but its worth it. 

He recommended the Cheese Vada Pao and the Plain Vada Pao as well as the Garlic Bread and Cold Coffee. I ended up trying both the varieties of Vada Pao and loved them. The vada was great and sandwiched between the pao with cheese and mayo.... the plain one was also spot on .... if I have to rate this place just for the Vada Pao then I would give it a 4 but since I am yet to try the other stuff I will revise my present rating after  doing so.
 Great value for money as well.
The down side....its strictly a take-away no place to sit and grab a bite.

Location: Chaat Gali/Supermarket, Bangur. 

Located quite near to RelianceTech at Bangur, this place manages to serve some decent eatable food. 
It's more of a hit or miss.
There's no ambiance as such as it's a stand by the roadside n' eat/takeaway joint. 

About the food, tried the following: 

- Cheese Burger
Here the burger served was grilled.
The patty was crisp and the burger tasted decent.

- Cheese Garlic Bread
Okay, so I wish they could rename this as well to Cheese Bread, coz' there wasn't a slight hint of garlic in the whole lot of five pieces! All I could taste in it was overloaded cheese on top of a loaf with a funny spread in the middle of the cheese layer and loaf which was way too salty for everyone's palate along with me (including me). 

-The ketchup served along with it was one found in local roll shops round the corners of each locality.

The service was undoubtedly quick, but, to no use. The staff including the owner there were too ignorant to listen to customers having complaints and queries, but, were all ears to customers placing their order. 
-Reason for the quick service, what I could peep into their kitchen and see was pre-prepared breads (Garlic bread, Sandwiches etc) laid out in the open. You order, they grill/toast and serve. HEALTH HAZARD!
This is how this place runs its business.
With such nonchalant staff and ignorant owner at your party order, you'll just be spoiling your party. Sorry, we have loads of better options at our disposal.

A pocket friendly place in terms of price, but, definitely a pocket pinching place in terms of taste! 

Overall a miss for me.
- May be a bad day for me, would revisit to put a foot down on the quality.

Once on my way to teach in bangur, I was severely hungry. But as it was the month end, I could not afford to go to a proper restro to have food. And I was craving to have chicken. But bangur is the hub on vegetarian food. I do not even realise how bengalis in bangur even survive amidst all the veggie joints. However, on my way, I went inside the bylane beside sharma sweets and there I was. I landed into pepperz expecting to find some amount of chicken. But alas! Blame my luck or blame it on bangur. I did not have an option and I was running short of cash, I decided to stick onto pepperz owning to the menu they had. Quite easily available sandwiches and pastas were there and I decided to skip it. However since i was more on the hungry side. I decided to go for a sandwich which was filling. I went in for the corn cheese sandwich. And it tasted good. The vada pavs seemed good. What i ordered was the cheese masala vada pav which was terribly great and tasty. One must also Try the mocktails. Especially black currant, they are really good with it. Go on and enjoy a veg snack. And you will love it.

Went to peppers today at 2.30 pm to hv vada pav. The staff was preparing a green chutney. He had one big jar which looked like a plain salt but had few  chunks which looked like small pebbles of plain salt. Generally when salt is kept in a for more then 2 years it starts to form big chunks . I asked him if this jar of salt is very old. He replied its not salt , then I asked if its agino moto( just like salt, its gives taste but its harmful for human body, its a Chinese salt). I again asked what was the white chemical that he just poured in his grinder to make the green chutney. Instead of replying he kept quite. 

My query was not replied about that  white chemical which he has been using in the green chutney. I request all the user  pls refrain from eating their green chutney. Even during the day time they kept their breads open in the kitchen, all the breads were taken out from the packets and kept openly. I guess they were using old expired breads and didn't wanted people to see their manufacturing date of the packaging.

Pepperz a Vegan's place for Cheesy Vada Pav, Garlic Bread and Sandwiches . Seasoned hands preparing a properly cooked Garlic Bread , Vada pav for you . You will find ample ingredients used in the preparation of the dishes like butter cheese, mayonnaise, butter etc .The Cheesy(Vada pav)  and Cheesy garlic bread is a treat in itself.(Must try)

No sitting arrangements . Hang around or take away but must have the dishes when you are around Bangur. There is a sitting arrangement inside the food joint as well. I would recommend this place when you are extremely hungry passing by or should try visiting this place for a quick and healthy veggie snack.

Special thanks to the Proprietor "Vishal" who loves serving good food and maintains the quality.
