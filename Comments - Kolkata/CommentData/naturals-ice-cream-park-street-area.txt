I couldn't get enough of Naturals Ice Cream during the holiday season ‚ò∫‚ò∫!! Was waiting for this brand to arrive in Kolkata and needless to say I was impressed üòÅ. I have tried the Coffee walnut, Choco Walnut, Mango, Strawberry ice cream shake. All of them are very good, especially the fruit flavoured ones. You can literally taste bits and pieces of the fruit in the ice cream. I was curious to try the Gajar ka Halwa flavoured ice cream which they had for like a week in end December. Happy to inform you all that it indeed tasted like gajar ka Halwa, a totally frozen and sweet version of it üòÅ. Gonna keep coming back üòé

At Park street, its a humongous double-storeyed parlour solely designed to relish on ice creams! Naturals ice creams are very innovative and deals in a wide range of fruity flavours. The flavours are very unconventional and they let you try each flavour until you find the right one. The prices are pocket friendly for a rich dessert experience. Thats a bliss!
This was my first visit, after trying several flavours I zeroed in on:
‚è∫Kesar Pista (cup)
‚è∫Fig & Honey (cone)
Both were unconventional and good to taste, but that extra edge was missing in their flavours. The flavours were not filling my mouth immediately, and I had to rummage through the mildness of it. This is something that Naturals can improve. Looking forward to my next visit.

So finally natural's ice cream is here in park street. I have been drooling over the seasonal flavours because they are better than the regular ones. I have had Jackfruit and watermelon flavours. I am planning to have Chocolate and black grapes. The best part is they try new flavours each week and I am eagerly waiting to taste Gazar ka halua flavor.

One of the best ice cream parlours in town.
Here u can get the real flavour of fruits in each and every scoop.
The consistency of the ice creams are pretty much perfect even they dont add any artificial colours which is the best part.
They even serve milkshakes too.
The prices are quite reasonable.

This is an ice cream outlet located at Park Street. I love it for the beautiful ambience of the place. The walls are beautifully adorned with pastel hues and quotes. The ambience is so tranquil. The space is also huge. The ground floor seats many and also has a sofa section for large groups. It also has a first floor which has swings as seats. 
Coming to the food, they have so many flavours. A regular scoop costs just Rs. 65. We tried the Choco Cream, Almond, Coffee flavours and also the flavour of the month: Nalen Gur. The last one was a huge surprise: it tasted so different from the conventional taste of the jaggery. They also offer a huge number of seasonal flavours, with many rare fruity flavours like Avocado, Peach, Muskmelon etc.
The counter is on ground floor. You just have to buy your scoop and make yourself comfy anywhere. 
A really great ice cream player at Park Street.

Icecream and fruits go hand in hand , " Naturals" the mumbai based renowned ice cream brand guessed the market potential well before time and are the market leaders today. Kolkata is the new addition to there list of outlets , and have suceeded in tapping the footfalls .. flavours are good and so is the quality and taste . Choclate based flavours have scope for improvement. 

A must visit joint at our very own food-hub park street ...

What more can you expect from an ice-cream parlour! 60 bucks/scoop is not something one expects when you walk in to that place. The flavours are extremely rich and delicious. And the wide range gives you sweet confusion to deal with. It's a visit worth every penny. Highly recommended.

From young to old, Ice-Cream is something that is simply relished by everybody. Well the city does have some amazing ice cream parlours but this newest edition to the list has become a big hit and is literally winning hearts with a large variety of lipsmacking falvours of ice-creams!
Easy to locate...just a few minutes walk from barbeque nation. I love their fruity flavoued Ice-Creams mainly. Have tried most of them but I have special fondness for Watermelon & Tender-Coconut flavours. The place is quite easy on pocket as well.

I am already a big fan of Naturals. Infact whenever my classes get over earlier than the scheduled time, I simply rush off to this place for some refreshment!

I guess no need to say much about this ice cream parlour. They‚Äôve already rocked the rest of india and after a long wait the residents of Kolkata finally got the chance to enjoy ice cream the naturals way. Just waiting to enjoy fresh fruit ice creams once the season of fresh fruit starts. The perfect 5 from my side owing to the taste, the place, the price.

Located in the heart of Park Street, Naturals was on my bucket list since its opening. The place was amazing, it has a really fresh ambience. The upper floor is really cool. It can easily accommodate large groups. Service is really fast. We tried the grape one and choco almond one. The grape one was really tasty but the chocolate one was extra sweet. Its fresh ambience and variety of ice cream flavours will surely gonna turn your tiring day into a relaxed one. Go, pay a visit.

Hands down. The best ice cream joint in town. Loved the strawberry, tender coconut and mango flavours. I usually stick to chocolate when ever I go out to grab ice cream but this place got me hooked to their seasonal flavours and specials. The ice cream are so creamy and melts in the mouth at once and contains chunks of fruit which is the best part. The place is pocket friendly ad well.

Visited this joint and ordered the all time favourite tender coconut ice cream which was quite delicious and mouth watering and also sitafal , while I‚Äôm not at all a fan of veggies  but this sitafal gone me crazy . It was the best ice cream I ever had made from sitafal . Also ordered for a change the black grape ice cream , for a surprise , it was the most delicious  ice cream I ever had .

It's 7th time when I came here and day by day its becoming my favorite ice cream parlur

Looks and feel- So let's talk about the looks and feel it's a very good to roam with friends. The place looks so beautiful and standardized if there is a little crowd in the ground you may check out the the upper floor which is also really so good

Staffs- the staffs are really good and well in behavior even when its too crowded but still they will handle  your needs very properly!! 

Ice cream- apart from all those this is the most important for an ice cream parlur which is the signature of this area.  The ice cream they serves are one of the greatest ice cream i had in this city of joy i personally tried are  guava, Pappapineapple, mango, Chococream, roasted almond, all those are really great the size of their cone is great its ready to handle 2 scoops in one cone , i can assure you if you are an ice cream lover and you take any of those you must have to try that flavor again. Apart from all those Pappapineapple became my favorite. You may try this 
All the ice cream are are vegetation friendly and made of pure milk as long as I can taste not frozen desert (ice cream without mik )

Approx estimate - well that's Upto you for always but according my self this place is really cheap and budget friendly specifically for students or the young-adults.

But personally i would like to urge the authority to bring some more some  luxury class ice creams and bring some more outlets across the city of joy 
Thank you for serving us since 80's

This place deserves a whooping 5 point any day! 
Not only do they have a brilliant choice of flavours, those who are not allowed to have sweets can also consume as their ice creams have a very little amount of sugar, and whatever their sweetness is, it comes naturally from the fruit they use! This place is a must try! 

We had, 500ml packs
Tender Coconut(10/10): This is one of a kind! Bows to this flavour! The tiny chunks of coconut you get in every bite is worth a moment! The sweetness is satisfying and healthy. Don't go with the colour, they taste MARVELOUS!

Papaya and Pineapple(9/10): This was also brilliant! Not as good as the coconut but it's delicious. Those who hate papaya can also have this, as the taste is not so significant but the overall taste will keep you craving for naturals ice creams for the rest of your lives I swear! 

Roasted Almond- Yet to try, it's in my fridge. Will update

Much hyped about, does it live upto the hype? Yes, kind of. From the two scoops of Mango and Tender Coconut that we tried, we found both to pretty tasty. The decor was pretty nice as well. The staff were also pretty friendly. What I would love for them to do maybe is try an arrange a small washroom, not thst every ice cream parlour should come with one but it'd be pretty nice to have one in handy. That said, this place is definitely a must try for all the ice cream lovers out there. Untill your next meal, stsy hungry, stay foolish.

Finally got a chance to try the signature Naturals flavour: Sitaphal ‚ù§Ô∏è
The little bits of fruit pulp and the subtle sweetness of the ice-cream made it heavenly and worth the hype.
The other flavours we tried were:
Tender Coconut
Coffee Walnut
Both were equally exquisite. In fact before purchasing we tasted almost all flavours and it was really hard to choose. The waffle cones were fresh and crunchy too.
Coming to the outlet, the decor is worth mentioning but there was a serious lack of good seating arrangement when we had gone. So they might need to look into that.

If you are looking for natural flavours of ice cream this Ice cream parlour is where you should head towards. Unlike other ice cream parlours this place boasts of fresh fruits to prepare the delicious flavours.

The outlet is brightly lit and colourfully decorated with small benches to sit on. It has an enormous space to occupy a large crowd and an ongoing rush at the counter. The menu is displayed above the counter. There is a separate menu for seasonal fruit flavours and all year round flavours. The ice creams come in small cups, cones, waffle cones, double scoops and boxes. Ice cream shakes are also available. Prices are reasonable, starting from 65.

We tried the following ice creams:
‚Ä¢ Sitaphal: this flavour is the most iconic, traditional custard apple ice cream that one cannot afford to miss if they visit
‚Ä¢ Choco Almond: luscious with all favourite chocolate and almonds
‚Ä¢ Coffee Walnut: quintessential taste of coffee with a whisper of walnut in its taste
‚Ä¢ Mango: another mouthwatering delicacy
‚Ä¢ Black Grapes: looks like the usual black currant available in other brands, but tastes very authentic

Overall a gratifying experience. It definitely has a thriving prospect in the area alongside other popular ice cream brands, considering the unadulterated novelty. Rating it 4.5/5.

Naturals has been in the hype ever since it came to the city. The place is quite spacious, and is perhaps on the biggest ice cream parlours in the city. There is ample seating arrangement, both on the ground floor and the first floor. 

I opted for three flavours - strawberry in a waffle cone, tender coconut and sitaphal. Each flavour was amazing, specially the tender coconut which was super cremy with bits of coconut embedded in the ice cream. 

The pocket pinch is seriously low and one can chill here with a scoop of ice cream for quite some time. The size of the scoop was good as well. I'm visiting soon to try the other flavours and the shakes.

Visited Naturals today. We had ordered for Gajar ka halwa, Sitaphal, Black grapes. Sadly all the 3 flavours tasted nearly the same. There was nothing discerning about the ice creams. Infact as the child didnt have his black grapes ice cream and it melted we found that it was not even milky but watery. The sweetness was also very minimal. Overall didnt like the taste and really very average. üòî

Finally the long wait is over and the earnest wish of a dessert lover is fulfilled. Naturals is finally in Kolkata  What could be a better occasion to visit this place than Christmas evening. This is a big outlet compared to the one I have visited in Mumbai. The decor is pretty awesome and the wall beside the staircase is a perfect background for clicking photos for insta loving people. We took mango and watermelon ice-creams one scoop each which costs Rs. 130. Nothing can beat the taste of the mango icecream, it was just out of the world. My mango loving partner is surely going to come here every time he visits Park Street only to have this. Watermelon one was good but it faded away a bit in front of the mango one. Then we took strawberry and coffee walnut one scoop each. I am a coffee lover so I liked that one more while my partner was inclined towards the strawberry one. I am definitely going to come back here again and again.

All the flavours cost Rs. 65 for single scoop and if is to be served in cone, then it will cost Rs. 75.I haven't tried but heard that the Shitaphal flavoured ice-cream is also a hot cake of this place. This is situated just opposite Allen Park and serves the best Fruity based ice-cream in Kolkata. Please hit this place real soon and I am sure you all will be loving it.

This Mumbai based popular Ice Cream brand finally came to Kolkata. Many people were actually waiting for this brand to come & keeping that expectation they launched one of the biggest Ice Cream Parlour in Kolkata at Park Street location with a bang.

Within few weeks of opening they have already taken many hearts with their famous Sitaphal Ice Cream. I was little late to reach their and try their famous natural ice cream flavours.

This place is huge and divided into 2 floors for sittings. As I already told before it is one of the biggest Ice Cream Parlour in the city. It‚Äôs all about natural taste and that is what their interiors wants to say. Simple wooden small table and chairs matching the theme giving it a modern touch.

At that time I wasn‚Äôt in a mood to try Sitaphal, so the guy at counter told me about their another speciality of Ice Cream and that was just‚Ä¶

Gajar Ka Halwa on Cup @ Rs.65 (5/5) :
------------------------------------------------------
This ice cream looked like a delicious piece of dessert, just like original Gajar Ka Halwa froze and served. I must say it was extremely well balanced. Don't know it was natural or what but the flavour just blown my mind. It tasted heavenly good and just like real Gajar Ka Halwa melting in the mouth. This can‚Äôt be explained by words, it can only be felt by the tastebuds.

Choco Almond  on Waffle Cone @ Rs.75 (3/5) :
------------------------------------------------------
Although natural flavour of Cocoa and real Almond was enough pleasing but this flavour wasn‚Äôt even getting close to what Gajar Ka Halwa was. Still Gajar Ka Halwa is running on my mind. Once again very well balanced Ice Cream and fabulous for Chocolate lovers.

Pricing :
--------------------
After the new taxation system, where each & every restaurant all over India is taking 5% GST they are still taking 18% of GST saying that, they are franchise & they have some other government rules to follow. Now its another debate if we want to figure out who's making us fool, its govt. or they. Whatsoever our bill was Rs.140 in total fro 2 scoops of their delicious Ice Cream. I would've given them 5 stars if they haven't played this small tactic.

Final Words :
--------------------
The place is a real competitor of Baskin Robbins, Quality Walls, Pabrai‚Äôs, N2, Mama Mia and pure pleasure for an Ice Cream lover.

This place is located right in Park Street, not very difficult to locate. The ambience is pretty amazing and comfortable. They have a variety of ice creams available most of them based on the fruit flavours. I have been here twice and tried the Sitafal, choco almond, chocobite. You cannot get a better idea cream at this affordable rates in a place like Park Street. Definitely a place to be visited.

The legendary ice-cream brand from Mumbai has finally made its way to Kolkata. Established by Mr. R.S Kamath in Juhu, Mumbai in 1984, Naturals has been a brand loved across generations alike. And why not? Their ice-creams are produced by combining fresh ingredients including seasonal fruits, milk and sugar without any added preservatives or artificial flavors. This one has been on my wishlist for the longest time. So, while on a visit to Camac Street, I just couldn‚Äôt resist dropping into their newly opened outlet!üò∏

Located opposite Allen Park near the Park Street crossing, the ice-cream joint is easy to spot for any passerby for its bright green logo. The seating area is spread across two floors, with the service counter on the ground floor and a cozy little space on the floor above. The interior is well lit, walls done in bubblegum blue and pink, adorned with photo frames encouraging anyone walking in to indulge in sampling more than a flavor or two before zeroing in on one. Or two. Or even three!üòª

Naturals has a variety of natural fruit flavors and quite popular for their Sitaphal and Tender Coconut, to mention a few. Deviating from their signatures, I went on to have "Papaya-Pineapple" and "Black Grapes" and must say they were indeed delightful. While both were infused with fresh chunks of fruits in every morsel, the papaya-pineapple not as sweet as I had assumed, the black grapes¬† tasted more like a coconut ice-cream filled in with chunks of grapes. What I liked was the use of milk and the right temperature control produced a brilliant thick and creamy texture that is truely unique to say the least!

Staff manning the place are friendly and quick with their service. Price wise it is almost similar to that of Pabrai's. This is also the only place I know that pack their ice-creams in¬†dry ice so that they can be carried over long distances. And after this delightful experience, am eagerly waiting to try flavors like Sitaphal, Peach-apricot and Kala jamun! üòªüòª

Was not aware that Naturals came to Kolkata and it was my first visit in this outlet. No different from other cities, this outlet would offer you the best ice cream by far in town. Tried their famous Sitaphal flavour which made them renowned and got bowled over again. My friend tried Black grapes which was again proved to be a hit from their Seasonal collections.

I can only LOL at the 4.9 rating :) I mean it all in good humour. Being from Bangalore, I've enjoyed Naturals icecreams for a few years ago. Super thrilled to see them finally open in Kolkata. Every single flavour is top notch and their waffle cone is the best I've had. Everyone will have a different favourite but my recommendations (if you're after unique) are jackfruit and sitaphal.

I visited this Ice cream parlor on my friends request. And I am thankful to him that he took me. I am simply awestruck with this place. I took only one ice cream scoop with coffee walnut flavor and it was mind-blowing. It was creamy, full of flavor and also full of walnuts. There was chunks of walnuts in every bite. I am again planning to there to taste other flavors.

The ambience and stuff was good. They let us taste at least 5 different flavors before going for an order.

Naturals.. And the name justifies, the flavours are delightful. We were confused with which flavours to opt for but they resolved it by allowing us to taste before order. We tasted a lot of variety and found tender coconut and sitaphal to be the best :) Undoubtedly one can go for either of these two flavours. They even had seasonal flavours like gajar ka halwa which was good to taste as well. 
I personally liked Sitaphal more, it even had pulp beads which enhanced the taste. A thumbs up to the venture and will definitely go for another visit to explore more flavours. The staff were also courteous and helpful. And the ambience was just the perfect ice cream parlour one, with pretty decors and walls.
Thank you :)

Having tried Naturals at other cities it was time to experience it at home town. They have set up a quite big ice cream parlor with seating arrangements on two floors. Famous for there natural fruits and food like flavoured ice creams, it was certainly not disappointing. We tried there malai, gajar halwa and kaju kismis flavours. The malai wasn't that good but we were blown by the gajar ka halwa flavor it felt like actually having gajar ka halwa. Highly recommended! The kaju kisimis was also good. Unfortunately they didn't have Dab flavored ice cream which was a slight disappointment. They let you taste before choosing ur icy sin !

Naturals in kolkata is like a boon to icecream lovers. Though the icecream from the mumbai brand was available in local shops but a standalone parlour selling the favourites is a great deal. Since it's opening the store remains packed throughout. The place is 2 storeyed and spacious. I am a sucker for its anjeer and tender coconut flavour. Recently i tried the black grapes one and it's good too.

When I was in Bangalore, I was a regular at Naturals, and was overjoyed to hear that it was coming to Kolkata. This place has added a dimension to the ice cream scene in Kolkata and has become an instant hit. I have no comments about any flavour in particular, because I liked each and every flavour. Regardless of my last statement, nothing can beat the tender coconut. I was a bit disappointed to find out that the special Friday flavour doesn't reach here on time.

I tasted Chocobite, Coffee Walnut, Papaya pineapple, Watermelon, Choco almond and their famous Sitaphal. I loved them all but the fruit flavours are my favorite. 
The ambience is nice and vibrant. It shall surely lift up your mood if you are having a not so good day. :)

I have been to this place quite a number of times in Hyderabad and I thoroughly enjoyed having their ice creams but a review at this Kolkata outlet was just necessary because of a number of reasons:

1. Being a bit partial,I love Kolkata and Naturals opening at my place, was a definite place to be visited and reviewed on.

2. I just loved the ambience and decor of this place. Non of the other outlets I have been to are so spacious decorative ones.
Nice white background with white furnitures and pastel paintings,quirky quotes.

3. The biggest advantage NO QUEUE over here guys...that's the only problem in Naturals Hyderabad.

4.Last but not the least I am super fan of their ice creams...no matter in which state it is...but overall they have some awesome flavoured natural icecreams especially the tender coconut one which is as fresh as a real one. Then my next favourite being Sitafal...I love the sitafal icecream out here than the raw fruit itself.

Kudos to the NATURALS Team...super love üòòüòò

One of the few ice cream parlours in Kolkata that is absolutely amazing. Just like its branches in Pune and Mumbai, its serves various fruit flavoured icecreams which are like no other. The tender coconut is probably the best of the lot. The watermelon, chikoo and jackfruit too are exceptional. Great place.

Somewhere I feel happy and proud stating this review. I was looking for ice creams and became extremely happy seeing Naturals ice cream being located very near to my new office..Before going inside i was buying pulse pakoras which is a local favourite from a teen guy . When i was about to leave his stall he said 'mere liye bhi ek layenge?" Which means can you get one for me? And I could not refuse him thus I bought one for him too and trust me that happiness on his face was priceless.. 

Now coming to the ice cream. I tried the choco almond he took watermelon flavor. I loved the ice cream I took for myself.¬† Guys keep up the good work. I  am gonna visit more number of times to try different flavors¬† !

Their ambience and the variety of ice creams they provide, especially fruit based ones just makes you crave for more. Tender Coconut ice cream is highly recommended. We actually visited there with the intension of having Tender Coconut ice cream after the feedback we got and to our delight, it lived up to all our expectations.

Naturals ice creams are just wow. A tiny two storey cute ice cream parlor beside Allen Park. It has a very clean pretty environment and ambience along with the courteous staffs. Have tasted tender coconut, sitafal,Choco almond,Choco bite and coffee walnut flavours.
Choco almond- Took 4 scoops of this. Each scoop had lots and lots of almonds in it. It was great.

Coffee walnut- This one had a coffee flavour as the name suggested and plenty of walnutsüòç.

Sitafal- Actually had the taste of sitafal in it. This was good too.

Tender Coconut- According to me this one is the best. You can actually feel the taste of coconut. I found this one to be the best from the rest of the flavours. Though I am a chocolate lover but still I would say tender coconut had the best flavour.

The best thing about naturals ice cream is that it will make you feel that you are actually having the fruit with the ice cream, the ice creams are that Natural.

Price is ‚Çπ65 per scoop. Happy eating üòä

Natural's icecream is a treat to taste buds! Natural's icecream are so natural that you feel you are eating raw fruit only with a blend of cream and toppings. Mango and tender coconut are must try and avoid eating chocolate here because it's ordinary.
This Parlour can be easily located on the Park Street Road and It's two storeyed with a very pretty ambience. :)

After a bad meal , we went for desserts and were not disappointed. The place looks and feels very nice, with artworks all over the walls and the designed staircase.

Truely living up to their name, they make all their ice cream with natural ingredients.¬†
Try the sitafal and the almond chocolate one as well. Great place for a little treat.

This place is one the most talked about, popular and high-rated ice-cream parlour in kolkata. And indeed it's worth all the buzz. Because this place has not only your common and regular flavours of ice-cream but new flavours which are amazing and fun to tryüòÄ. Their ambience is really good with a quirky and fun yet soothing decor, and some good music. They have a second floor too for sitting with your ice-cream in privacy and having a relaxing timeüòÅ.

Choco bite was amazingüòçüòç and its will satisfy all the chocoholics over there. Choco almond was amazingüëåüòç. And the watermelon flavour was very refreshingüòçüòÄ.

The iconic brand Naturals has finally opened its door for Kolkatans. Having my weekend class in Park street it really is hard to not drop by often. Quirky decor greets you while you enter. The colour scheme is quite soothing to ones eye. Although I am not a fan of fruity flavoured ice creams but they surely can convert anyone. :-)
Must visit for everyone who loves ice-cream.

Finally Naturals is here in Kolkata!
Had my first experience with this place although I heard so much about how amazing their ice-creams are finally had the chance to taste them!
Location - Near Barbeque Nation in Park Street.

This place looks super cute from inside. Surely the cutest decor. Everything from the lights to the walls to the show pieces everything just perfect!

I opted for Sitaphal, Mango and Roasted Almond flavours. They tasted DELICIOUS!

The best part about this place is that their prices are super affordable. Nowadays ice-creams are very expensive at most of the ice-cream parlours but with Naturals its different!

Naturals is finally here in Kolkata and anybody can hardly keep calm! This ice cream chain revolutionizes your idea of ice cream. Loads of fresh, exotic fruits blended into thick creamy ice cream is something that can never be missed. Their litchee, chickoo, sitaphal and tender coconut ice creams are absolutely unique to the chain and ones you should definitely try. They serve one huge variety of fresh ice creams and if you're confused, they'll offer you a spoonful to try and decide! The waffle cones they serve the ice cream in is also so very good, it's wiser to choose the cones for an meagre ten rupees extra than the plastic cups. 
The space is huge and has a small and cozy upper floor. It's growing to be an increasingly popular hang out zone because of the beautiful ambience. And honestly, lush ice creams and cozy sitting, one can hardly ask for anything else!

Had my first experience with this brand when it opened an outlet in my city. Had high hopes because of the repo it has created for itself and I can truly say that it surely fulfilled my experience, more than the flavor the purity of the fruit in every bite is what excites me. 
Tried a papaya pinapple ice cream and its surely more tasty then it sounds, loved the combination.
Also tried 2 all time favorites of this place, a chikoo scoop and a shitafal flavor, loved the shitafal one. 
The interiors deserve a special mention, not often do you see such a big outlet for an ice cream brand. Kudos to the team, will keep visiting the brand more often.

I generally do not give 5/5, but this place is just mind blowing..I've been there to Mumbai Naturals and had a heartbreak when I didn't find it in my city..But all my sorrow has turned into joy when I've seen the same in my city.

As my office is situated in Park Street, I usually go to this place very often. 

and I love Tender Coconut so I ordered that only.

but the best thing is the decor...it'ssuperbly decorated with diecast cars and some tags.

If you don't have visited yet, please go and grab your ice cream.

Haven‚Äôt visited this newbie in town yet? It‚Äôs high time you taste the best ice cream in Kolkata. Flavours are so natural as their name. Quality is exceptionally good. Try tender coconut, roasted almond and malai. All these tasted awesome. Looking forward to visit again.

It's never too cold for ice-cream and that's exactly how the love story of kolkata began with NATURALS.

Naturals opened it's doors for the calcuttans from 1st November,kinda winter time,right?
But ice-cream nowadays is way more than just "heat escapade" as the level of experimentation with flavours and genres of ice cream by various brands, has given rise to diversification of taste and NATURALS is one of such success story,the reason behind which is nothing but AUTHENTICITY.

The place looks bright and vibrant and the fact that it's in park street gives it that extra bit of edge üòâ

White walls accompanied by photo frames and wall hangings,but the best of the lot are those toys(cars & gramophone) and craftwork,allowed to sit in the wall boxes.

The name "Naturals" itself suggest it's characteristic feature being use of natural ingredients to give the ice-creams an authentic flavour.

Each & every flavour is perfectly creamy,whereas the balanced sweetness  gives edge to the natural ingredient,be it the mango,coconut, or chickoo to glorify it's flavour amd rejuvenate your tastebuds.

Personal Favourite : 

‚úìTENDER COCONUT
‚úìMalai Ice-cream with MANGO pieces

Park Street,loved ones,ice cream and a lot of gossip - what more can you ask for when in the city of joy.

From Mumbai,with Love. <3@

So it‚Äôs finally here in Kolkata and they do live upto their standards. The flavours are fresh and light and the ambience airy and bright. We tried the Sitaphal, tender coconut and choco almond flavour in cones. The first two were exceptionally good. Small bits of coconut and sitaphal in your mouthful of ice cream makes the taste even better. The choco almond was a little bitter and nothing great. The staff was a bit rude though that‚Äôs maybe because I have an ugly face fyi. But yes I will definitely go back to Naturals for more.

I'm in love with this place. I'm fond of ice cream very very much. I heard a lot about this place, talk of the town. So yesterday, finally I visited. First the ambience is cool and decor is awesome. The upstairs decor is amazing. The interiors attract the customers the most. Coming back to ice cream I had Tender Coconut & Choco bite in cups and choco almond in cone. All tastes yummilicious.. mouth watering.. and the staff.. they're too friendly and polite. This place made my weekend. Will visit again.

BEST icecream ever. Period. This place was on top of my wishlist ever since they opened in Kolkata and boy oh boy it didn't disappoint!
Ambience- much much better than what you'd expect from an icecream parlour. Its fun and its cool.
Order- coffee walnut icecream in waffle cone, tender coconut icecream and the sitaphal icecream shake.
Food- each flavour was top notch and actually justified its name. The tender coconut had generous pieces of the fruit all over. Quantity wise, the size of the scoops are bigger than any other restaurant and I really appreciate that! The waffle cone was crisp and the walnuts provided a nice crunch to the coffee icecream. But the sitaphal icecream shake was my favourite. It had a shake like consistency with a big dollop of icecream in the middle. Loved it!
Pocket pinch- 300 including tax.
Overall- highly highly recommended!

I have tasted Naturals in Delhi and was bowled over by the freshness and the truly natural variety of the offerings. Their USP is definitely use of real natural ingredients...and that too at a surprisingly affordable price. The experience was similar at this Park St outlet....We tried Anjeer, coffee - walnut and Choco - almond....freshness and flavor redefined....awesome and best dessert option for all who flock to Park Street area....

Location- Heart of the city- Park street, opp. St. Xaviers college
Ambience- Bright, sober, simple, perfect for icecream parlour.
Flavours- A lot of options are available, they allow you to taste different flavours before you select one. Choco cream, kesar pista are my favourites there.
Choco almond, coconut and coffee flavours are not so good.
Price- just 65rs. for a cup or cone. Worth it.

The chocolate ice creams were a bit of a let down for me, however, the fruit flavoured ice creams were top notch! Can't wait to try the watermelon and mango. Highly recommended!

Had heard so much about Naturals Ice Cream, dropped by and I wasn't disappointed. The ice cream here is different if not unique. The ambiance is excellent, it is spacious, vibrant and has simple but beautiful decor. There are two floors so seating is comfortable.
What we ordered:- Sitaphal, Orange&Apricot(this was the new flavour which they have introduced), Jackfruit, Coffee Walnut. 
Had taken a scoop of each. All the above four flavours had real pieces of fruit which stole the show. But the best one was the coffee Walnut. 
Will surely come back for more. Highly recommended!

The city of sweets, got a new destination.. yes not really a misti but yes it's the ice cream corner. The renowned brand "Natural" is here. Yes, we have already a few known super ice cream brand serves fruit ice cream. But yes this is Natural after all, so was in the wish list from the day I came to know about its opening.

Location:
____________

In the park Street , just on the opposite foot of Allen's Park.

Decoration:
______________

There are very few ice cream parlour in town, which offer quite a big sitting arrangement. And this one will be among tops. Wall decoration and shades of light is just superb. Loved it.

Ice cream:
___________

‚úì Tender coconut : very nice. But not the best I had.
‚úì Jackfruit: superb one.
‚úì Sitafal : excellent.
‚úì chiku : another superb one.

We took the cup scoop. It cost 65 per scoop of cup with tax.

Now there is lots of options. And they serve the shakes also.

Experience is superb. It can not be better than start the winter season with the ice cream :D

And if you yet to visit, don't wait...... Go..... :)

Sitaphal was okayish but I loved tender coconut the most..! üòã

The place was very crowded nd I loved the seating arrangements,well I might sound a bit idiotic but it reminded me of my school days where we used to gossip nd shout sitting in d same bench with other bunch of idiots just like me ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

Naturals is now in Calcutta! This single sentence is enough to cheer any sweettooth up in seconds. I still remember the taste of hands down their best flavour, Tender Coconut which I had years ago in Delhi. So when I finally checked into Naturals park Street last night I just had to go directly for that. In spite of being an almost full and busy evening the men behind the counter were pretty fast at their job. Me and my friends went for double scoops of Tender Coconut, Mango, Choco almond and Choco cream. One great thing about Naturals Ice cream is how authentic and rich their flavours are, it's almost like you are having the fruit itself. Mouthwatering stuff. Priced about 130 bucks for two scoops of any flavour Naturals is every Ice cream lover's paradise. No wonder they have already reached almost a 5 star rating within a month. I vouch!
P.S. Don't forget to grab their 500g tubs at 275 only.

If you are a coffee lover then go for coffee walnut. It's delicious. The rich flavour of coffee fills your mouth perfectly. Chocolate almond flavour is also very tasty.
Very nice place to hang out with friends and family. Will definitely go there again.

If you are in park street then it should be a sin not to grab something from this place ! Located pretty close to Allen park , this place is the new hype among the young people of kolkata ! Bright lighting , cosy sitting , fancy decor , posh look , well behaved stuff , everything is perfect. So we ordered mango , sitaphal , tender coconut , malai. All were simply amazing. But the best was the sitaphal according to me. Rich in organic flavours , the ice creams melts in the mouth as soon as you consume them. And the best part they charge only Rs. 65 for each scoop in a cup which is inclusive of tax. I can't wait to visit again.

Well this place is like my third home. I end up here for atleast 3 days in a week. Wasn't a ice cream freak but this place has kinda changed my entire notion.
Stationed at park street this joint serves varities of ice-cream flavoured and nurtured from dry fruits to seasonal fruits. 
The beauty of this place lies in its authenticity. Almost every thing that comes out of process gives out a pure delight.
Well i have ended up trying maximum of the ice creams from here. The ones i just can't afford to miss out on are : Coffee Walnut, Roasted Almond, Kaju kismis, Tender coconut, kesar pista and Malai. 
Literally these are the one of a kind here the best i have had till date. 
This joint is silently taking this particular seen of the city of joy to a whole new level producing the actual indentity of ice cream in a very different and amazing way.
The pocket pinch is very moderate.
If you got a bunch who can spare some stories over ice cream you should be headed to this joint.

As the name suggests, the outlet offers a number of natural and unconventional ice cream flavours. 
One must definitely look out for the seasonal flavours. 
We had ordered Coffee Walnut and Anjeer. Both the scoops were delicious and kept us wanting for more.

Have tried the mango, sitaphal and tender coconut flavours and it's hard to choose a favourite. The ambience is laid back and the place is tastefully done in white. The artwork on the walls is cool too. Amazing ice cream at a price that won't burn a hole in your pocket. What else do you need in life? If you haven't been there yet go now!

Single best ice cream parlour in the city right now. Swanky, clean, has a minimalistic posh look, yet the single scoops start from just 65 a cup. The quality of the ice cream is on par with that from Pabrai's.

The servers are polite, fast & adept. By the time you have paid your bill, the cups are ready. We had the Muskmelon & Sitaphal variety, a scoop each. Both very very nice, but a special mention for the Sitaphal one. It was sublime.

I have a few questions for the Naturals people whom I've seen frequenting the zomato review pages. One) This was my second scoop of Naturals. I had a scoop of Tender Coconut at Vasco, Goa. That seemed a bit superior than the ones I had in Kolkata. Two) Since the price is tax inclusive, would you guys be decreasing the price when the GST rates come down?

ANew in town, this place is enjoying its newly-arrived status to the fullest. It‚Äôs quite big and spacious as compared to its outlets in Bangalore and the inside looks beautiful. For a very long time pabrai‚Äôs was the market leader in fruit based ice creams in Kolkata, but now they have stiff competition. Having tried most of their flavours, my favourite ones are sitaphal, tender coconut and malai. I‚Äôve recently tried the coffee and walnut one and the walnut failed me. It just felt like walnut pieces have been forcibly added to it. The coffee flavour however was very predominant and on point. Chocolate bites ice cream however wasn‚Äôt that great. You get better chocolate ice cream elsewhere. Their tubs are reasonable priced, so one can take home the happiness too. Loved the first floor of this outlet. Hope to see more of you Naturals.

It was a bad day for me and I desperately needed something to lift my mood... And Naturals Ice Cream came to my rescue! First I took a scoop of the tender coconut ice cream and immediately understood that it has soared the popularity chart not without reason. I could feel the tender coconut flesh inside my mouth. It was heavenly!
Setting aside all my worries that had bogged me down through out the that I took a closer look at the menu and this time my heart voted for a scoop of watermelon ice cream in a waffle cone. While the ice cream was good, I regretted opting for a waffle cone. The cone was yummy, but I felt the cup gave me more liberty to have my ice cream. Since I had just taken one scoop, it sank inside the gone, giving me very less opportunity to swirl.
Soon I was done with it.... But my heart was waiting for more! So, next I ordered for Sitaphal Shake. This time too, like the tender coconut ice cream, I could feel the Sitaphal pieces inside my mouth.¬†
With all my worries washed down, I decided to walk for at least 2 KM from the shop to ensure I don't start worrying about weight gain! ;o)

You took my heart away. Heard about you a lot, now that you have come to Kolkata, you literally took my heart in single visit. After finishing one cup you will definitely tend to order another. Go for there fruits based ice-cream, those are naturals speciality. They have both cone & cup option. We went for cup and ordered tender coconut (their speciality) and malai. Both were too good that as soon as we finished we ordered for another two which were kesar pista and coffee walnut. Among the four I found that kesar pista didn't match the level of rest three, kind of regretted my decision. But never mind, heard that sitaphal one also taste too good, next time this will be at top of my order list.

I finally experienced this ice-cream brand that maintained its high standards and impressed me in every possible way.
Starting with the ambience, can a ice-cream parlour be any better? I guess not. The first floor has a train compartment like theme, they have made an extra effort by showing old Kolkata pics. The ground floor is ideal for family outing as well as dates.
We took the ‚ô°Roasted Almonds scoop and ‚ô°Muskmelon Scoop.
It's amazing how natural their ice cream is. The taste is subtle and so pleasing. They take tax inclusive prices.
The service is extremely efficient. By the time I pay my bill, the other guy is ready with the order.
Of course, would like to visit there again.

'Naturals Ice Cream' is the newest buzz in the city and  the buzz is justified. Located bang opposite to Allen Park near Park Street Crossing, Naturals has been serving mouth watering ice-creams of differentband unique flavours.

After a sumptuous lunch at "Golden Dragon' we decided to satisfy our dessert cravings here. After a brief walk, we landed up here. The ice-cream parlour is huge with provsion for seating in two floors. Thr ambience waa cozy and nice,perfect for a date.

We orderd one scoop of 'Sitafal' first. From the very first bite we were impressed with the taste of it. It was filled with sitafal and the taste of the ice- cream was accentuated by the presence of natural ingredient in the ice-cream.

Next we ordered 'Roasted Almond'. It was delectable. I havr never seen so much almond in one scoop of  ice-cream. It was a magical experience.

Finnally,we went for 'Coffee Walnut' with their homemade waffle cone. Foodgasmic is the only word to expres the melange of sinful coffee almond flavour and delectable waffle cone. We loved it.

The staff was well-behaved and amaiable in nature. We will definitely visit again.

After trying out their Marine Drive, Mumbai outlet, I fell in love with Naturals Ice Cream. I'm glad they are finally in Calcutta. 
I visited their calcutta outlet last week with a friend. Its a funky and spacious place; very bright and happening. 
We ordered 1scoop each of the following flavours on fresh cone (300 Rs in total): 
1. Watermelon
2. Muskmelon
3. Choco Almond
4. Papaya Pineapple

Apart from this, I have also tried the malai, coconut and apricot flavours. 

All the flavours are amazing with generous chunks of fruits. What more could anyone ask for? Freshest ice creams at the lowest prices!
My absolute favourite!

What can I say about this place! Amazingly tasty ice cream. You have to have it to know it. Had one scoop each of the tender coconut, choco almond and coffee walnut. Each flavor was a complete blast! Have to try the rest of it soon. Also it was cheap too, compared to so many other ice cream parlors.

Ice cream THIS delicious!!! We visited it few hours ago and m drooling over the taste till now!!!
The location is just opposite to The Allen Park at Park Street adjacent to the Maanyavar showroom.
This is the first time I visited an ice cream parlor THIS huge and the decor is very tastefully done!The decor and the sprawling area simply won my heart.
Coming to what we ordered-
Sitaphal ice cream- This was our first encounter with this fruit and that also inside an ice cream!The taste was so delicious that we thought of ordering a repeat but the menu looked so tempting we ordered

Coffee and Walnut ice cream- I mean it's quite evident from the name itself that this combination was simply Blockbuster!!!!loads of walnuts gloriously hidden in the coffeelicious cream!!!just droolworthy ‚ù§Ô∏ènext we ordered

Roasted Walnut ice cream- Yet again we were sweeped off the floor with this ice cream loaded with  roasted crunchy almonds. Flavour full and totally yummylicious!

Loved all the three!!!The prices are too pocket friendly and inclusive of taxes.Big thumbs up guys!
HappyEating!

After a very hectic weekday morning, we stepped inside for a breather and immediately we were enthusiastically greeted by the staff. After going through the flavours on offer, we decided on a chocolate almond icecream and another anjeer one. The chocolate almond icecream was just the right amount of sweet with the crunch of almonds that never ran out. The anjeer one had a beautiful caramel aftertaste and again they weren't stingy with the anjeers. The mouthfeel was very creamy and not crumbly like you sometimes find. I felt that the price was quite reasonable as well. Overall I would definitely go back to try out all the other flavours and revisit our favourites again and again. A big thumbs up from me!

I have been literally waiting for this since 2010. The first tender coconut and the absolute love for natural flavoured ice creams. 
It's at an off location in park Street where parking may be a problem for most, but for Naturals, you'll never mind that walk. 
The staff are extremely gentle and sober and the enthusiasm with which they entertain the customers is a treat in itself. 
The quality and taste aren't describable. You have to be in the place with your cup or cone to know that. 
For any ice cream lover, anywhere, go to Naturals if desserts are your soft spot.

When u name your brand naturals you look to live up to the name if you are to rule...and they have done just that...The shop with interiors which brighten your mood and complement the exotic, familiar natural flavours that you've tasted your whole life...but with the addition of a heavenly,creamy,fresh ice cream that couldn't be better than it already is...and with the  pricing just right which makes you reach up to your pocket for that extra bit of money for another scoop,a different flavour, trust me when i tell you this is the place you wanna take your whole family....cause according to me they have the best flavours...and when you couple it with ice cream the excitement comes naturally.

Tender coconut alwAys reminds me of my mother‚Äôs home made coconut ice cream. Sitaphal is also good but none can beat tender coconut.

3 steps to brighten up a bad day:
1- Take a nice evening stroll down Park Street.
2- Step into the spacious new outlet of Naturals, which welcomes you in with a soothing colour palette, fuss-free decor & friendly, efficient service.
3- Treat yourself to fresh, creamy, mildly sweet, delicately flavoured, super delicious ice-cream that's actually quite reasonably priced.

If that doesn't make you feel good, nothing will!

This place stays true to it's name. The ice creams are made from fresh fruits. There are no artificially added flavours. It has an ample space to sit. Around 30 people can be seated here at once. Just opposite this outlet is a parking space, so it is not a hassle for customers with self driven cars.

The Sitaphal (Sharifa) had a rich creamy taste of Sitaphal. There were chunks of custard apple in it. It was not very sweet, just the right proportion of sweetness.

Choco Almond had the flavour of roasted almond and dark chocolate. It is sweet but has a tinge of bitterness to it which enhances the flavour of the chocolate and roasted almond.

Kesar Pista had strands of saffron and pieces pistachio. It tastes like our Indian Kulfi.

On a whole it was a very good experience to taste ice cream of fresh fruits.

I need to share a small story before I get down to the main review. I was 11 when I had first visited this ice cream parlor at Koregaon Park, Pune  along with my Mom n paternal aunt and uncle ( I was enjoying my holidays with my aunt n uncle). The taste of the ice creams had  amazed me! After 6 years I re visited Pune and made sure to make it up to Naturals! The same amazing taste ! "I wish Naturals opens a branch in Kolkata soon" , and that awesome feeling when the wish comes true!  This branch at Park street is at a stone's throw distance from my college and I have had my first visit  there!! We were a group of 9 , all of us had ordered for different flavors. They have a lot of options including the seasonal fruit ice creams which are not always available like lychee, blueberry and so on. I had ordered for two-chikkoo and tender coconut. Wonderful they were  with fragments of the fruit infused with the cream! My friends had ordered for watermelon , coffee, muskmelon, Jalebi, out of which I loved Jalebi the most. Pocket pinch is not too high, taxes are included.
Ambience was too beautiful. Its a must visit ! Highly recommended

People were madly waiting for the natural ice cream. And finally it is arrived in Kolkata also. People are insanely visiting this place. Like them I also tried out this place. As I went with my bunch of friends so I got to tried so many flavours.
The flavours I tried were :
Malai
Tender coconut (favourite one)
Mango
Choco almond
Watermelon
Choco cream
And sitafal (but other seasonal flavours were not available)
That was really disappointing because I wanted to try their seasonal flavours and those were not available on that day. Most of the flavours were out of stock. The prices are really cheap. I like most most of the flavours. But my complain is that their a ice creams are not that smooth or thick.
Except that I like the ice creams,they were really smooth and it had the flavours.

Naturals was the much awaited ice-cream parlour. It is spacious and the decor is simple but different.
It has a wide variety of new flavours. 
We ordered sitafaal, chiku, and tender coconut. 
All 3 were superb. Prices are pocket friendly and they are inclusive of all taxes. 
This place is worth visiting again!

This evening, I was in the mood for something sweet. Luckily, I spotted a new icecream outlet while passing by Park Street. So, an hour later I dropped in with Maa. I had read about Naturals in the newspaper, so I was inquisitive about it as we walked in.
The great thing about the staff in there is that they patiently offer samples of the flavours you want to try out. I was amazed to see the range of flavours - coconut, mango, peach, strawberry, sitaphal, litchi, jackfruit, guava, anjeer, muskmelon, watermelon and so many others - all natural extracts of fruits and nuts. Even their display screen runs the video of processing taking place in their units.
We finally opted for a Coffee Walnut and a Sitaphal - I must mention here that Sitaphal is a very popular flavour and a must-try.
The parlour is very spacious with two levels, the upper level being more comfy and less crowded. The interiors are very chic and the design elements are in keeping with the theme of the brand. The most interesting installation is the innumerable hand structures on the wall by the stairs, which is a tribute to the manual workers who have toiled to make this icecream brand as unique as it stands today. A high factor is also the hygiene, which is well maintained.
Needless to say, the icecreams were amazing - the bittersweet flavour of Coffee Walnut, and the surprising delicate taste of Sitaphal. But don't try to mix more than one flavour on the palate if you've ordered a couple of them beacuse the unique flavours contrast each other. Also, because real and fresh fruits are used, some flavours are seasonal in availability, but you'll still not be in dearth of choice. Also, the price seemed reasonable to me.

So Naturals is worth a visit, on the street of so many eateries, for an enjoyable treat.

Being a loyal customer to this chain of ice-cream joint in Pune and Mumbai, I had to have my share here in Kolkata as soon as it opened its door.
‚óè Location: Opposite to Allen Park in Park
Street; just beside the Manyavar Showroom.
‚óè Ambience: Divided into 2 floors. Has sitting arrangements. can accomodate 20-30 people roughly. well lit. squeaky clean. Simple yet modern decor.
‚óè Ice-cream : Good that they still have such a pocket-friendly menu. All icecreams cost 55 bucks plus 18% gst (cost of 2 is 130/-).
My absolute favorites are:
Tender coconut,
Watermelon,
Anjeer,
Coffee walnut,
Roasted almond,
Lychee (seasonal).

The best part about Naturals is that it actually uses natural ingredients for making their icecreams and no artificial flavourings are used. And it add pulps & bites of the particular fruit or nut into the icecream which makes it stand out in the game.

New addition in the heart of the city 'Park Street'; all the way from Mumbai, Naturals is in our town bringing loads of exciting flavours. Decorated in  soothing colours in white based with quirky wall hangings. Prices are cheap comparatively. 

We tried two flavours; one is tender coconut, which was suggested by them only and it really tasted too good which made by my taste buds dance to its tune. Another flavour was Coffee Walnut, the taste of coffee was strong with small pieces of walnut, this too pleased my taste buds.

Best of luck Team Naturals Ice Cream. Looking forward to visit again and try some more flavours.

Naturals, welcome to the city of joy! Ice-cream lovers have got something to really cheer about in this town. Its really awesome to get so many varieties at such reasonable price tags. We tried out three flavors in cups - Mango, Sitaphal and Tender coconut. Unfortunately the strawberry was not available.¬† Personally I loved the mango and sitaphal ! They are really toothsome.. I would highly recommend Sitaphal as well as coconut since you literally get to taste the pulp of the fruits!

Natural's ice cream is the latest addition to the family of ice cream parlours in the city of kolkata. Originally run & managed from Mumbai, it is a welcome addition to the ice cream lovers who prefer to have a taste of natural fruit/ingredient flavours in their ice creams. Strategically located in the heart of park street just opposite of Barbeque nation. The ice cream parlour has sittings spread over 2 floors. Beautifully decorated with a feel of vibrancy would surely lift your mood even before having their delightful ice creams. They have self service counters just like KFC.

My friend & I tasted the following flavours:-

1. Tender Coconut - I took this flavour on a cup. A generous serve of single scoop would be enough to mesmerize your tastebuds. The coconut ice cream exactly tasted exactly like original coconut just in the form of ice cream with no hint of artificial flavours. The shards of coconut gave a good texture to the ice cream. Very subtle yet delightful. Certainly a crowd pleaser. Highly Recommended.

2. Sitaphal - One of their speciality flavours. My friend opted for this one on a cone(Mind you they charge extra Rs 10 for cones). Originally they had mistakenly gave us the coconut instead of sitaphal but upon our grievance they kindly changed the it. The sitaphal was absolutely outstanding & certainly lives up to its reputation. Very light on taste but delectable. Again a highly recommended flavour.

3. Coffee Walnut - We also gave a try to this flavour urging for more. This was rather a strong one in terms of flavour compared to the previous two. The hint of strong raw coffee was felt thoroughly with every spoonful & the presence of walnut certainly gave a good balance with the coffee taste. Enjoyed to the fullest.

In short we were delighted with the experience. All the ice creams cost Rs 55+GST without cone. Would absolutely visit again to try more of their delightful flavours!!

It's not been even a week since it opened and already people are going gaga over it.

I with my bestie visited the parlor yesterday, and well, we too went crazy.¬†

There are so many "natural" flavors available that it makes you go through a dilemma of what to order and what not.¬†

While we were deciding which flavors to get, we saw people complaining about why there are so and so flavors not available, and the guy standing at the counter, very patiently explained that they are seasonal flavors and those said fruits are not available in this season. This itself explains, how much they believe in using everything Natural.

So, yes though the menu consists of a lot of flavors, not all are available. Therefore it is better to check with them beforehand what flavors are present, before making your decision.

The staff is really hospitable and they have this smile plastered on their face, that make your experience even more delectable.

Also, I loved the decor of the place, how the ground floor has a modern touch to it, while the upstairs is made like an old memory lane with all those vintage Calcutta pictures.

We tasted the Tender Coconut ice cream along with the common Choco Almond and both were delicious.

Hopefully, we will visit again soon, and taste the other recommended ones.

Malai -sweet and light. Incredibly smooth. 

Tender coconut - fell in love with it. There are bits in it. 

Coffee walnut - light and smooth taste of coffee with crushed walnuts in it. 

The price - a single scoop of any flavour costs 65 INR. 

You have got to visit this place at all costs.

It's delicious & natural and finally in Kolkata. The reason Naturals is a hit is because they contain no artificial flavours, no preservatives, only fresh fruit pulp or dry fruits. Finally an end to pleading friends and family coming from Mumbai to get a pack of Natural Ice Cream.¬†

The icecream had no icy bits. It was creamy, lush, subtly flavoured and had quality ingredients. I love most of their flavours, especially the real fruit ones. But on my visit I decided to settle for a Coffee walnut waffle cone ice-cream and a Malai ice cream. And like they say, buying ice-cream is synonymous to buying happiness. There are no better words to describe the taste of the ice-creams here. It's truly magical and pure bliss. Also loved the crunchy waffle cone.

The staff was courteous and sweet, and let us taste quite a few flavours before we could make up our mind. Only the billing process seems to be a little slow as there is only one billing counter, which I feel should be increase in order to manage the crowd at rush hours more effectively. Though the seating arrangement is very impressive and looks very posh. 

Coming to the price, it's just Rs. 65 for a scoop which unbelievable because the amount of fruits or nuts in one scoop would cost much more in the market.
They also do special packaging for people who stay far away by packing the icecream in dry ice packs. 

If you haven‚Äôt tried them yet definitely come here and indulge in made-from-scratch icecream. Totally and definitely recommended, in fact add it to your bucket list. üòÉ

Amazing... mind blowing
Me and my friends checked this out and tried out a lot of flAvours like tender coconut, chickoo, coffee walnut, watermelon , jalebi and sitafal. All of them were wonderful. Full points to decor and service.
They should improve their billing system btw. Plus there is no added tax ( lifts your mood more) and very easy to locate ( on the opp foot of allen park in park street)

One of the best ice creams I've had till date. 
The name says it. It's natural. I have tried their coffee walnut and mango. 
Both were very, very good. There were big walnut pieces. The mango flavor was strong. 
The service is quick and the staff are really nice and helpful.

Bit disappointed with the taste when I compare with the outlets which are there in Hyderabad. Though they are apart of same franchise but the taste differ.
Hope they amend this as soon as possible.
Because Naturals is one of my favorite ice cream outlet.

A place for Ice-cream lovers!! Such a Natural way to relish the never unending temptation of ice-cream with varied flavors. It took time to come in Kolkata but this famous ice cream store located in most major metro cities is finally here and they have set up shop in the heart of the Park Street. The problems is the parking and the counter is too small to cater the huge crowd.

I choose three which was wrongly chosen sitaphal,malai & Tender Coconut.

I was bit confused with the taste as all three were resembling each other but I found Tender Coconut is one of the best, the seasonal flavors they do are refreshing but depend of availability on seasons, quality of waffle cone is too good.

Not heavy on pocket the prices are reasonable and the ambiance is good don‚Äôt miss this place if you have sweet tooth.

Finally after 2 attempts we managed to have the ‚ÄúNaturals‚Äù on Diwali Day. The Ice Cream served is no where near to the Ice Cream served in Mumbai. 

We tried the Coconut Flavours. Out of 3 scoops not a bit of Coconut Piece came in any of the scoops and it was very watery. The Mango Flavours also did not have the taste of Mango as it tastes.

On the other hand the Staff was also not very courteous and they were even not giving the whole scoop for which we pointed out.

Now everyone is going only for the Brand but they will have to really improve if they want to sustain. Wholesum Quantity and Tatseful Ice Cream is available at a competitive price in Kolkata

I still remember drooling over Naturals ice cream quite a few years back when I visited Mumbai... I remember missing the fresh and rejuvenating taste of out of the box flavours in my home town... I remember wishing there was a Naturals outlet in my city... And hey hey hey!!! It took Naturals quite a bit of time but it's finally here and to add the cherry on the cake, it's located at a minimal distance of 500 metres from my college...
On my first visit, I could try only two flavours,
Watermelon-- I almost felt a burst of freshness in my mouth at the first bite itself. It clearly reminds u of the fresh, watery and juicy texture of our favourite old fruit and the taste is simply on the spot perfect...
Tender coconut-- One of my favourite flavours of ice cream of course, and Naturals did do utter justice to it... But the sad part was that the scoop started melting right away of its being served which is sumthing that I don't expect from a good ice cream...This was strange because the watermelon scoop remained frozen intact throughout unlike the coconut one...
Otherwise, the pocket pinch is more than reasonable... It's perfect to say the least and the staff are good too... Last but not the least, the parlour is decorated to exute the utmost level of cuteness and it is obviously a nice place for a hangout...
Will definitely frequent this spot to try more amazing flavours...
..........................................................................................
On my second visit, I tried a horde of new flavours launched in the Friday Funday deal.
Muskmelon-- Brilliant balance of sweet and sour is what defines this ice cream... The freshness exuted from the fruit is perfectly matched with the creaminess of the ice cream...A mild and funky flavour worth trying.
Persian delight-- A combination of Mid-eastern flavours which constitute dates, a hint of gulkand, a variety of nuts crushed finely. The crunchy texture of this flavour went particularly well after the mildness of the muskmelon.
Shrikand-- This is hands down, my favourite flavour yet with the taste of aromatic cardamom and saffron looming in the background... This is most recommended at Naturals if u ask me!!
Papaya Pineapple-- This flavour will definitely leave u cursing ur luck when u have gulped all of it down... This brilliant blend of the summer fruits is heightened by the addition of tiny bits of freshly chopped papayas and pineapples in the ice cream itself. A must must try without a doubt.
I just changed my rating of this gem of a parlour from a 4 to a 5... And that's simply because for now, Naturals has blown me away with their innovation and I can't wait to try all the flavours that are on the list as soon as I can...üòä
..........................................................................................
Third time already... Almost feels like this place is becoming my second home in park street after Xavier's. The flavours tried this time go as--
Coffee-- Everything a coffee lover expects from a coffee flavoured ice cream... Not too overpowering, yet embodying the bitterly intoxicating taste of coffee. However I somehow would have enjoyed it a tad bit more I believe if a sprinkle of coffee powder would have been added to heighten the taste to another degree.
Sitaphal-- The heart of a kulfi lover yearns for this flavour inveterately and Naturals did utter justice to this flavour without a doubt...
Anjeer-- This goes down as the best flavour yet that I have tried at Naturals... Figs couldn't have been embodied in a better way...the little seeds being the best part of the show mixed with raisins which took the flavour to an "out of the world" degree... Beautiful and perfect are the only words that I can use with conviction!
Coming back soon, goes without sayingüòÖ

Was quite crowded on a Saturday evening. 
Most of The seasonable ice creams were not available except for Sitaphal and jackfruit which was quite a disappointment. 
The classic flavours were okay. 
The seating area is nice.

It took Naturals a while to come to Kolkata but this famous ice cream store located in most major metro cities is finally here and they have set up shop in the heart of the busy Park Street. It is very easy to spot being just across the road from Allen Park and right at the lane which connects two of the most popular streets of central Kolkata.¬†When I have been to Naturals in New delhi it was always the small take away ice cream place. However I was pleasantly surprised at how chic and hip this outlet is. Lots of space, well lit and very well decorated, it is soon to become a fan favorite place to hang out among youngsters and college goers.¬†Naturals is known for its affordability so it was no surprise here that a big scoop of ice cream will only set you back Rs 65 with an additional Rs 10 charge for a cone. You can also avail larger servings, fancy versions with dry ice and family packs. They also sell milkshakes. Another plus point I would like to mention is that you can have sample the ice cream flavor before ordering a big scoop of it. Service is alright and you might have to wait a while if it is a busy day but that is hardly a bother.¬†Let us talk about the ice cream now, which is definitely the star of the show here.¬†We ordered Mango, Roasted Almond, Choco Almond and Coffee Walnut Flavors, all in cones. The serving was generous and the waffle cone perfectly crisp.¬†Mango flavor ice cream is always a classic, however I have to add that the one I was served was one of the most refreshing ice creams I have had. All of the other flavors were indulgent and the Roasted Almond Ice cream was the star of the show this day. Everything else was delicious too.¬†I really cannot wait to go back and try out more flavors. Gotta try them all!!

I've been there thrice in the past week and tried sitaphal, mango, chikoo, choco almond and choco bite. All the flavours are really well reproduced and overall the place is pretty good. I personally think, that the flavours don't pop out as much because they serve it so cold. Once it starts melting a little, you start getting the flavours.

There wasn't anything special about the ice cream but the flavours - the variety and authenticity of. That's what made all the difference. Once you taste the ice cream, you'll know they stay true to their word - milk, sugar and fruit. The proof will come once the ice cream starts to melt. You'll feel it melting away into sweet fruity milk. Tried a custom fusion of watermelon and jackfruit along with sitafal and anjeer. Both were good. Jackfruit and watermelon were really refreshing flavours.

The wait is finally over....could relive my Mumbai days...their ice creams are the perfect combination of great VFM quotient and Quality consistency...a heartfelt thanks to the Kamath family for finally listening to our longing for their divine ice-creams....and now let's hope they have more outlets in Kolkata as that would be of great convenience.

I was waiting to check it out as it is a walk from my office and my friends who are/were in Mumbai had raved about it upon asking after this outlet was opened in Kolkata.

Visited it with a colleague today. It's spacious with two levels and the walls are nicely decorated with illustrated stories of the genesis and journey of the 1984 brand. This surely helps create a connect of the brand with the customers as they stand in the queue for payment first.

We ordered the much acclaimed Sitaphal ice cream and loved it enough to go for another round. Like all its fruit flavours, it had real fruit and we found it in every spoon. We devoured the morsels of the fruit and the natural flavour of the pulp mixed with the ice cream. A minor blemish was that it had got a little melted.

I took Coffee Walnut next and my colleague took Jackfruit (as that was the only seasonal flavour available other than Sitaphal). I loved this one too! It felt like having an ice cream strongly infused with cold coffee. The bits of walnut added to the experience. It's an ideal dessert post dinner. As it is located on Park Street and open from noon till midnight, it's easy for diners to walk in for the dessert round after lunch/ dinner in one of the restaurants on the road.

The Jackfruit flavour was much appreciated by my colleague and described as "full of pulp". I just had a spoon of it and liked it.

The price is flat Rs 65 for a single scoop of any flavour (served in paper cup) and a cone costs Rs 10 extra. I found it reasonable given the quality. Service is slow but. Be prepared to stand in the sole queue for some time before you place order.

I will be waiting to go back to explore more flavours. It is a welcome addition to this foodie city.

Ice creams are lovely, service is not. The wait in queue seems eternal. Billing process is too slow. It would be great if billing is organised. Only one person is allocated for billing. I hope more counters get opened so that the process is eased. At peak time, this would be difficult to handle.

It was a pre Diwali evening, me and my friend were strolling around Parkstreet when we were stopped by a new Ice cream parlor. I am one of those who was unaware about the brand. Seeing a new ice cream joint I was dazzled up and decided to stepped in. As I opened the door a flury of sweet smell tempted my taste buds. A¬† board at the counter had the entire overview of flavours that are available in the joint which fascinates me even more that, first time in Kolkata an ice cream parlor is offering a plathora of indigenous fruity flavours. I took a couple of minutes to decide which one to try first and then decided to go for chickoo and anjeer. The best part was they are offering small spoon of sample to taste before placing orders. By the time of billing and collecting orders I was watching¬† the video on their LCD of extracting flavours from the original fruits and the transforming into ice cream. After collecting our orders me and my friend decided to go upstairs as the ground floor was too noisy.¬†

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†The staircase is the real eye catcher in the joint. The wall beside the staircase is decorated by a few hundreds of hand motifs and it is dedicated to the workers who has been the backbone of the brand since 1984. The other side of wall is decorated with quirky Colors, painting and show pieces which will give u a feeling of funky ice cream parlor. Now comes to the upstairs, it was given a feeling of tram ride as the interior is inspired by the interior of Kolkata trams. A couple of black and white pictures of bus, trams, crowd to hold up the essence of kolkata. The seating arrangements is overall cosy and comfortable. A perfect place to hang out with friends.

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Now comes to the vital point, flavours. The Chickoo flavour was amazing and was worth a try,¬† but the anjeer was a little disappointing, the consistency was on little thinner side and the texture was granulated one can feel the presence of the seeds of anjeer. Later we decided to order 2 more flavours this time on cones. We ordered double scoops of papaya and double scoop of choco almond. The papaya was outstanding. On the contrary, I found chocolate almond very ordinary in taste. The cones were as normal as other ice cream shops provide, in terms of taste.¬†

¬† ¬† ¬†Overall the experience was good and I am still cherishing the tastes and I will definitely visit again to taste other flavours which, I couldn't that day.

Finally its here! It took quite sometime to come to Calcutta but how.So for people like me who have experienced Naturals from Mumbai,Bangalore,New Delhi and few other cities know this place as a take away ice cream joint,a good one at it though. But I was surprised by fancy their first parlor is here in Calcutta.Located in the heart of Park Street which makes its very easy to spot. Very spacious,well laid out,and refreshing interior.The service was quick and spot on. I was visiting with a friend of mine and we ordered sitaphal and mango scoops.We both were accustomed to Naturals,hence the idea of having pulpy ice cream was not new.The ice cream was good as usual.Another thing to note is that temperature inside the parlor is well maintained to make sure the ice cream doesn't melt easily,which is always good.For people trying it for the first time,do try the Tender Coconut, Chiku, Anjeer too.Finding parking is a pain though.Waiting for a few more joints.

I was waiting for naturals ice cream to open an outlet in kolkata since a long time. It is located at Park Street , the busiest street. It's huge and cutely decorated with wall hangings. Tried their sitaphal ice cream which was lip smacking good. The problems I faced were - parking and the counter is too small to cater the huge crowd. The staffs are under trained and it was chaotic near the counter.

Love their tender coconut, walnut coffee, strawberry and sitaphal

Located opposite Allen Park in Park Street and adjacent to Manyavar showroom, this outlet was in my wishlist since i came to know that they are opening outlet here. Amazing ice cream, Original flavours and Excellent service. Tried Chiku, Anjeer, Sitaphal and Chocolate Almond amongst flavours. Each and every item is mouth watering. Apart from that we had watermelon ice cream shake which was also good.

Waiting to visit again and try other flavours !!!!
