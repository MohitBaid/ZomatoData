This is the central perk for friends. One can spend  quality time and with his or her friends. Why not is located in the prime location of Golpark near to Kotak Mahinda bank. The ambience is mind blowing, with neon coloured studio lightings and innovative arrangements it's exclusive and entertaining. In the starter we ordered roasted chili pork and that has rejuvenated my love for pork once again. The staff and service truly deserves a strong appreciation.My personal recommendation for everyone would be to try the special Horlicks shake, it's worth enjoying.

Found this place on Zomato and saw the reviews. It had a whopping 4.9 rating of 5. Just had to visit this place. Seems not less than a club when you get there but is actually a lounge. The food is out of this world. Absolutely marvellous. But as a regular foodie and restaurant hopper I might add a few suggestions to make more improvements. 
Firstly, it needs a hell lot of time for your order to arrive. We waited at least 45 minutes for our order to hit the table. They need to take care of it for better customer service.
Secondly, the choice of songs and the lightings are very discontinuous. The mood sets in and fades away very quickly. They need to take care of that as well.

Overall it was a good experience and the total bill also felt very nice on the pocket 😉 ...me and

Visited this place on Christmas eve with a friend, ever since in love with the place. The place is highly recommended because of it's ambience. The background score and the neon lights make the place one of the coolest in town! Though the non-veg hakka noodles and kum pao chicken were satisfactory, the crunchy fried chicken was extremely juicy and crunchy at the same time. The quantity was more than sufficient for two. The staff was courteous and the service was prompt. It was overall a pocket friendly experience.

One of the best restaurants I have been to. First of all, their hospitality is outstanding. They greet you with such a warm welcome that it can uplift any bad mood.😉 The dishes we ordered were pork chops and chicken steak amongst which the pork chops were really the winner. And last but not the least is their ambience . The soulful music, the soothing decor , all are perfect for a pleasant dine and hangout. I m eager to visit this place again.

We went to this dine out near Golpark after reading great reviews on Zomato. The food was great.Quantity was also very good. We ordered kitkat shake, Horlicks shake and virgin mojito. Out of these best was virgin mojito. For starters we had bacon wrapped prawn, patthar ke gosht and chilli pork.All three were lip smacking. Pork was absolutely fat free and tasted like mutton. Main course comprised of four dishes chello kabab,pork chop, chicken steak and mutton cannelloni. Mutton cannelloni was excellent followed by chicken steak pork chop and chello kabab. We were too full try different types of desserts,so we shared a sizzling brownie with ice cream. From starters to dessert everything was amazing.Very courteous staff and prompt service. We did enjoy the neon lights as well..

Fairly new outlet with huge space and wonderfully decorated. The ground floor being family restaurant and the first floor is the lounge area. Although just hookah is available and no booze is a downside but the food they have are just marvellously brilliant. The first floor has a interiors to make you go WOW. It has three types of ambience just by adjusting the lights. One being normal another being disco lights flashing and the last being neon glow. The neon theme is epic. The whole ceiling lights up. The posters , menu everything starts to glow. Packed up with great music playing in the background this place is a strict go to place with your friends. Food we ordered were hot and sour soup and lemon coriander soup. The lemon coriander soup tasted awesome but the other one was little pale and blunt. Each time the staff asked us after our meal if it was ok or not. On saying that it wasn't up to the mark compared to the lemon coriander soup they asked us if we would want to change the dish. Since we had plans for a big main course we declined the offer. The service is a bit slow but the food is worth the wait. The best commendable service a place can offer. They didn't even bill us for the soup that we didn't like. A great thumbs up to the guys at Why Not. We ordered roasted pork, one of their many specialities. And it was total value for money. 3 of us had tough time finishing it. It was so heavy we decided to skip main course and went in for coolers and ice cream. Horlicks shake, green apple mojit and Oreo shake. Horlicks shake is pure Bliss. As weird as it sounds it just as tasty as you can imagine. Oreo shake was great and mojito was good. The presentation of the fried ice cream with burning alcohol stole our heart. Food we can get in many other restaurants but the service that we got is indeed appreciable. I wish them all the luck in near future and I shall soon be visiting again. .

An amazing place to visit with a group of friends. We I have visited with my school friends and it's a hit. The decor is very good. Specially the neon lights are something which will awe you for sure. The staff was very cooperative and cordial. We had the the jumbo mixed grill platter and non veg tandoor platter. Both are really good. The coolers they serve are amazing. Above all they play good music from come studio and MTV unplugged which is sure to rewind you. A must visit place. 
N.B. wear light color dress to glow under neon lights.

I made a visit to this place on a weekday, which is why the place was deserted and that is exactly how I like it. I went there for lunch and discovered that it  also serves hookah. Not very fond of it though, but the food  was what I was looking forward to. 
We were two people. A friend of mine had accompanied me.
We ordered 1)a non-veg lasagne- Full of cheese and well baked, exactly how it's supposed to be. 
2) Chicken steak- it was a plate full of perfectly boiled veggies, mashed potato and a good slab of chicken. The taste was different. A little spicy and smoked. I liked it. 
3) Sizzling brownie with icecream- perfect dessert. However i wish there was more icecream along with the brownie. 
The staff were welcoming and helpful. Good music. A thumbs up! 😀

Located in golpark in the lane of tantuja isnt hard to locate.The ambience is one of the best i experienced till date. The 1st floor ambience is nicer than ground floor with electrifying lighting system and music.Continental is a speciality of this restarurant.We ordered 1 lasagna 1 tetrazzini 1 stroganof for 5 people. The items were delocious but the quantity were little for 5 people.The staffs suggested that 1 lasagna will be adequete for 2 people but the quantity is much less. I strongly feel that the pocket pinch mentioned in zomato should be edited to 1000 for two approx instead of 600 for two .

This quaint little place is quite easy to locate. Just get down at Golpark and take the lane that's beside Tantuja, walk down a few steps and before you know, you will have reached Why Not.

Once inside, ask to be seated in the lounge upstairs. The decor is tasteful. Miniature posters adorn the wall along with small musical instruments. Once they turn off the normal lights and turn on the fluorescent lights, it's simply magical. You need to see it to know it.

Now, the food. We had ordered the following:
Salt and pepper chicken - Small chunks of chicken and veggies cooked in a spicy sauce. The quantity was enough for two people.
Fresh Lime Sodas - freshly squeezed lime sodas; cool and refreshing.
Baked Fish - extremely well cooked bhetki fish with loads and loads of cheese. The fish was really tender and had a rich, creamy texture. The dish is not spicy (well, it's not supposed to be), so if you're looking for something to tingle your senses, probably not the best choice.
Pork Chops - pork ribs cooked in a spicy sauce and given with a side of veggies, mashed potatoes and an omelette. This dish was tasty. If it weren't for the ample quantity, I would've ordered another. (Yeah, I'm a glutton. Judge me please.)

To sum up, we were really satisfied. For the money they charge, they provide more than enough food. The quality is good too. The staff is extremely courteous as well. However, they could stand to speed up the delivery a little bit. We actually had to wait for some time, even when there was practically no rush. I would definitely recommend this place for its chic vibe and delicious dishes.
(Ask for sheesha. It's not there on the menu.)

Checking out reviews and with the dreams of Pork Chops... Landed in this restaurant on 31st Dec'17 eve. Ordered for a Kitkat shake at first.. and obviously Pork Chops. The shake was very yummy.. with every sip could feel the kitkat crackles. Just loved it. The Pork chop looked extremely delicious. Was served with boiled veggies, mashed potatoes and brown sauce..with a fried egg on top. The pork chop was cooked to perfection but the taste was spoiled with the salted brown sauce. I was provided with steak knife which very few Kolkata restaurant provides. The server didn't come down even once to ask, how the food tastes?, I was waiting for the same. As I was in a bit hurry, hence just separated the sauce as much I could and had it with boiled veggies and mashed potatoes. Secondly I would like to mention, when thick shakes are served that has Oreo or Kitkat, one must provide a Parfait spoon along. Thirdly.. the decor of the restaurant is good, but doesn't suits a restaurant which serves Continental food, rather it's bit of a cafe style. The couch was much lower compared to the table, which doesn't makes it comfortable for the diner who is having stakes. Overall will say a good restaurant, with a bit more effort can do much better.

I was dying to eat continental, and a friend of mine picked this one out for us to have lunch. This is a fairly new place in the Golpark area, so we were a bit skeptical about how it will be. But the moment we stepped into the first floor of the restaurant, all the skepticism washed away. We were rather taken a back by the ambiance and the decór and of course the music. Pretty chic, I'd say. What we had:

🔸 Watermelon Mojito : We started our meal with this, and was totally refreshing and set the mood for the rest.
🔸Gondhoraj Fish : For starter we're about to order something (I don't even remember the name anymore :P) when our waiter almost insisted us to order this. I'm so glad he did! Nothing else could have made my new year more special. The fish was soft, flavourful, even the dip was perrfect. You need to have this to know what it is!
🔸 Chicken Stroganoff : Well, main course didn't turn us down. This was delicious as well. But they only serve the classic Stroganoff ie, pairing chicken with rice.
🔸 Sizzling Brownie with Ice-cream : This was basically a brownie on a sizzler topped with two scoop of ice cream, chocolate and vanilla, and loaded with cashew nuts and chocolate sauce. As one can rightly guess, nothing can go wrong with such a dessert. :P the combination of warmth of the brownie, with ice cream and crunchy cashews was heavenly. And I'm not even exaggerating!

Last but not the least, the stuff here are super friendly and the place is totally pocket friendly. :D
Oh and, they also have a different hookah options.

Yesterday we had a sumptuous dinner at Why Not where not only the food but everyone working there were courtious. The service was good. The owner was acting like a true host not only with us, but also with everyone dinning out there. We liked the personal touch that he put in while serving. A sure recommended place to go with your friends and family. Moreover not a very expensive place compared with the quality of food. We are yet to explore first floor of the restaurant where we heard they perform live music.

The place is discoverable, the lighting is decent and the atmosphere is subtle. Though the staff was initially appeared confused, the person who waited our table was very good.

We ordered cream of mushroom soup, non-veg Lasagna, prawn cocktail, tetrazzini non-veg and a few drinks.
The soup was a 4/5, non-veg Lasagna was 5/5. Tetrazzini-4/5.
The prawn cocktail was not upto the mark. It had a strong taste of vinegar and the punch of the sauce was intense which rendered the prawns as mere chunks to bite on. This was not really what I expected.

In the drinks the Horlicks shake was AWESOME!! It was worth the try but it is a heavy drink. The watermelon mojito was a disappointment. I did not like it much.

Overall the experience was good. Total worth giving a try. For that extra cheeses and lovely bread, this is the to-go place!!

This is a new hangout place in golpark.They have 2 floors.They serve food as well as hookah.I visited on 1st Jan 2018 with three of my friends and it was not crowded at all.Intially we wanted to order Mutton Canolini  but it was not available and I found a bit surprise that the staff was also not aware of it.When were about to place the order the staff informed us.We then ordered Fish Florentine,Greek Salad,Chicken Steak and Caramel Pudding.The Chicken steak ,Fish Flotentine and Caramel Pudding were very good.Greek Salad was good but not at par with the other three.
The staff was humble and cordial but they have to be more on their toes.The staff was a bit slow plus they should be aware which items are available on the menu and which are not. They should inform the customers before hand about the availability of food.This saves time .The manager or the owner was going to each and every table and cordially asking about the food.This is a commendable gesture.
In all the experience was good but not great .Otherwise it is a good place to hangout with friends.

Service: Staffs are very courteous and promt
Food : I tried grilled fish which is just too too good with its flavorful taste and the chelo kebab which is a must say that it is giving competition to peter cat's one so keep it up guys and lastly the Horlick's drink which I ordered as I heard about the same being superb in its taste has not impressed me so much or may be I have had too many in my childhood days 😜
One thing that I really liked it that it has separate sections to accommodate the family having elderly people and another section for crazy youngsters so kudos for that and the best is you have good food which welcomes everyone so why not wishing "Why Not" team good luck 😊

Strolling along the streets of Gariahat, we decided to try one of the restaurants nearby.. Searching on google and zomato, we decided upon Why Not! 
It’s kind of confusing for someone visiting the first time, they have a restaurant downstairs and a lounge cum hookah parlor upstairs (the stairs are in the back) 
The ambiance is relatively good, especially if you are intending to try out the hookah (we didn’t) otherwise if you’re just going for dinner then ask to be seated downstairs itself since we did face a problem with the lights because they switched on uv lights in the midst of our dinner making it quite difficult to see what we were eating.. We sat upstairs in the lounge and decor-wise we liked it.. There’s pictures of all the famous singers placed on the wall along with real musical instruments and for music there is a huge screen tv which plays songs from Coke Studio. 
Coming to the food.. ohhh it was utterly delicious! In fact we plan to visit there again while we are still in the city.. We definitely recommend to visit this place for the food.. The presentation of the food and drinks is also very appealing. The chef is very talented no doubt. 

As recommended by the waiter we tried a drink called “Beautiful Parrot” which had a base of kiwi crush and was topped with soda and the glass was rimmed with salt which gave an extra yummy edge to the drink.. 

We ordered the “Mixed Noodles” which as the name says had a mix of assorted vegetables as well as prawns, chicken, pork,eggs. It was tasty and quite filling. An absolute value for money.

Then we ordered the “Pork Chop” which is a Why Not speciality. This was served with a fried egg, a side of mashed potatoes topped with a cherry tomato and lightly sautéed vegetables (mushrooms,broccoli,zucchini,peppers,carrots,green beans). The chop was cooked to perfection and the meat was tender and delicious. This was definitely a try-again dish and we both loved it. 

Why Not has a little plastic cart rickshaw which they fill with chlormints and give you at the end of the meal and we loved the idea of that too.. We hadn’t seen it before and we felt it was unique and cute.

Ambience, staff, music system, food, lighting all are great is nothing less than rating 5.
However the music taste requires a lot of improvement, I would request the management to upgrade the music taste and music library.
Comming down to food the quality is great and quantity is sumptous and in comparison to these pricing seems quite reasonable.
We tried:-
Chicken Greek Salad
Chicken Grilled Sandwich
Chicken Pizza
Chickem penne white sauce Pasta
Cucumber Cooler
Coffee(**special mention amazing coffee)
Overall a wonderful experience!!✌🏻👍🏻

This place is for those people who loves muzzzzik very much... At first we ordered a kitkat shake and a cold coffee with ice-cream along with meatball pizza... The taste of the pizza was really good and the spices in it were bursting specifically inside the mouth... The shake and the coffee were good at taste..
The best part was when we ordered for the chelo kebab... The chciken was very tender and juicy..and it contains a creamy texture that makes you to crave for more of it... The sheek kebab was normal in taste like any other place... Bt very good...
All over the experience was great.. will visit this place again...

This restaurant is an absolute gem on the heart of Kolkata. It is only 5months that they have begun their journey...Being an ardent foodie myself,the ratings of zomato attracted me to this place.
Very easy to locate,this is placed on the road leading to South city college. Starting with the decor,I simply loved it. The neon lights and the soothing music add to the lovely ambiance of the place. The staffs are so cordial and hospitable that it added another feather to their goodwill. 
Now coming to the most important thing,that is food...we ordered Pathhar ka gosht served as a starter which was really tasty... Then we went for chicken ala Kiev, fish Florentine,chicken lasagne and chelo kabab...honestly speaking none of the dishes disappoint me at all. All were excellently presented and tasted. Finally we went for @brownie with ice cream...oh how yummy it was....and the best part is after eating so much the bill was absolutely pocket pinch... I have become a huge fan of this place and would surely give multiple visits. I wish I had the option of giving them 6 out of 5...a must try for the continental lovers...

The decor was suuuperb!!! And the lighting plus neon lights were the cherry on top of a cake.. !! Staff is friendly and courteous.. Ordered Fresh lime Soda, Cosmopolitan and Virgin Mojito.. All the three drinks were great.. For starters we ordered chicken cilantro.. It was delicious.. For the mains we ordered non veg lasagna, fish Florentine and chicken steak.. The lasagna was probably one of the best lasagnas in town.. Fish Florentine was absolutely amazing .. Generous amount of fish.. And the chicken steak was great too.. Veggies were nicely seasoned.. And the sauce was yummy.. Loved this place slot.. Great ambience, great service and great food..

This place is for those people who loves muzzzzik very much... At first we ordered a kitkat shake and a cold coffee with ice-cream along with meatball pizza... The taste of the pizza was really good and the spices in it were bursting specifically inside the mouth... The shake and the coffee were good at taste..
The best part was when we ordered for the chelo kebab... The chciken was very tender and juicy..and it contains a creamy texture that makes you to crave for more of it... The sheek kebab was normal in taste like any other place... Bt very good...
All over the experience was great.. will visit this place again...

Ambience: 5 
They pay very close attention to details as far the ambience is concerned. The main USP is the lounge lighting, specially when they turn the neon lights. Music, decorations and seating arrangements are great as well.

Service: 4.5
Staff members are very well mannered, honest and courteous. However I think they are a bit understaffed   during peak hours.

Food: 4.5
Yet to try out everything but it offers good variety. WhyNot specialities are good. Watermelon mojito is worth mentioning under Coolers. The food preparations and presentations are more or less perfect.

Value for money: 4
Provided the locality and ambience, the pricing is appropriate. Prices may seem a bit high as they are inclusive of taxes. Still for a first time visitor, I felt the pricing for the speciality items were somewhat ok. Yet to try out the Chinese and Kabab items.


Overall it is very difficult to give a detailed review in one visit. But for me it was a very pleasant and different experience. Looking forward to more visits.

Do you want to visit a place which is luxurious yet pocket friendly where great food is presented by courteous staff members and ambience includes great music, cozy seating arrangements, funky decorations and Neon Lights! "WHY NOT?"
Yes after seeing the ratings in zomato we decided to visit this place and the evening turned out to be special. This place is located beside south city college, golpark and not difficult to find. Being a foodie am not really attracted to the ambience but the warmth and the homelike cosiness with cool collection of music will surely melt your hearts. Also neon lights was a bonus and real fun. Now coming to the food we were determined to try out their specialities and ordered "bacon wrap chicken" "chelo kebab" "pork chops" & "chicken steak". Each dish if eaten whole is enough for one person and the taste really justifies the high rating of this place. The meat was tender, juicy and really melts in your mouth. We also enjoyed the food because it felt like we were relaxing in our home. Hats off to the team for putting up such a place. I am definite if they keep up their good work this place will be the no.1 hangout spot in Kolkata!

You will have absolutely no difficulties in locating this place as it replaced what was previously kafe bindass. Comprising of two floors, the first floor is where you should head to. The first floor gives you great vibes with its oh-so-cool lighting and music. However the sitting arrangements could have been cozier. Their service is pretty mention worthy, they maintain a level of cleanliness and won't keep you waiting. We had ordered chelo kebab and thai red chicken curry with rice. The quantity was enormous and totally worth the money and both the dishes were scrumptious. I loved this place and would definitely recommend it to you guys.

Why not is one of the latest additions among the gems of eateries at South kolkata.
‘Why not’is the second venture of the owner, Mr. Sandip who is a producer. The menu card is curated with his favourites from across the world. Though the place is just around 4 months old, it has won several hearts for it’s great food and sheesha ,beside awesome vibes, nice ambience and good music. 
Famous bands and musicians are often found to perform live. 

Considering the rush the kolkata eateries face on a typical saturday night, we called a day earlier for making reservations. The courteous voice responded that we can drop as per our convenience and choose to be seated at the casual ground floor restaurant or the 1st floor lounges.

Location: ‘Why not’ can accommodate around 90 guests at a time. It is located at Gariahat, opposite Golpark Ramakrishna mission, on the lane that runs beside Tantuja. It is Easy to locate from outside.

Ambience: The ground floor is simple with minimalist decor and spacious tables.
We reached at around 8.40pm and opted to be seated at the 1st floor lounge. 
The lounge area has been done tastefully. We loved almost everything about the decor, from lighting to the guitar to the Beatles to the Kishore kumar photo. Not to miss the ceiling with musical notes scribbled all over. MTV unplugged was getting played on the TV. The UV light setting deserves a special mention, when Everything changes its colour and hues become mysterious.

Food: The place offers an array of Tandoori, continental and thai food. And not to mention the place is a non-vegetarian gourmets’ delight. We opted a number of dishes from the menu cards .

Starters

# Patthar ke gosht: 
Presentation: nice and simple . Around six Mutton Tikkas are presented with salad.

Taste: tender mutton patty cooked with right seasoning. Hits the right chords. The meat is neither to minced as in Shammi kebab nor too coarse. I liked the texture.

#Roasted chilly pork:
Presentation : chunks of pork sautéed in soya sauce with bell pepper and onions. Simple and clean.
Taste: a few of us are not pork lovers, but we loved this dish. The bell peppers, the onions and the soy complemented the pork nicely.

#Golden fried fish:
Presentation: fillets of kolkata bhetki fried till golden and served with honey chilli dip.
Taste: Bengalis love their fish. And we absolutely loved this dish. The six fries disappeared in no time. 
We would love to see some more dips, may be a few hot and tangy ones too. 

Coolers
#Virgin mojito, watermelon mojito: 
Presentation : we loved the mason jars !
Taste : Virgin mojito is good . Though some of us liked the plain virgin mojito more, I liked the watermelon mojito as well. Tad different from the regular plain mojito.

Main course
#Chelo kebab
Presentation : the classic Iranian delicacy is Kolkata favourite since long. ‘Why not’ recreated the magic. Served with a sunny sided up egg on a bed of buttered rice. The sheekh kebabs, chicken kebabs and caramelised onions and tomatoes make the perfect accompaniments.
Taste: the flavourful mutton Sheekhs delighted us. The chicken kebabs were nice, rightly seasoned and cooked just right.

#Mutton cannelloni 
Presentation : the Italian pasta dish that impressed us most . Cannelloni pasta stuffed with mutton stuffing in napoleata sauce, topped with generous amount of cheese and toasted garlic breads.
Taste: the dish is mind blowing. Succulent pieces of mutton cooked in tangy sauce with the pasta sheets and cheese tasted heavenly. This dish is highly recommended for mutton lovers.

#Grilled chicken florida
Presentation: chunks of grilled chicken in barbecue sauce served with sautéed vegetables and mashed potato.
Taste: the chicken was not chewy, much to our liking . The veggies were properly done not semi cooked like many eateries. Mashed potatoes could have been better.

#Grilled fish with lemon creper sauce
Presentation: a huge chunk of bhetki filled in super tangy lemon sauce with mushrooms. Served with sautéed veggies and mashed potato as sides.
Taste: the handsome chunk of fish was done perfectly. The not-so-fishlovers did not like the smell though. The sauce was a tad too sour. The veggies were nicely done. 

Desserts
#Whynot special fried ice cream
Presentation: Two scoops of fried ice cream , flambéed in front of us. Sadly, due to the AC or novice hands , the flambé did not happen as it should be. Anyways we broke on the dessert soon.
Taste: It’s something unique, and to be frank I haven’t tasted anything of this sort. Coconut ice cream, coated in a batter that did not get fully softened , I liked that . Drizzled with chocolate sauce enhanced the flavours.

#Sizzling brownie with ice cream
Presentation: Very nice. Brownie served on hot skilled with 2 scoops of ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce.
Taste: the brownie is not the best. Rather dry and caky. Moist , fudgy feeling of a good brownie was missing. Though it tasted good with the ice cream. Can be better.

Service: very courteous staff. The management proactively interacts with guests regarding food, ambience and convenience. Personal touch while being served obviously makes the guest feel special. 

The place stands out among the throng of eateries for its laid back, relaxed ambience, great music, and obviously good food.
Portion of Each of the items is huge and can easily be shared among 2-3 person of medium appetite.
I feel the size and price of the dishes can be further optimised, so guests can opt and taste more dishes.
More options of sides can be provided.
Scope of improvement is there, as per desserts menu is concerned. 
We hope our connoisseur owners must have many more favourite desserts for us to explore in near future :)

A great hangout place with a very little pinch in the pocket. Dishes are awesome ..enough for 2 persons for a single plate . Staffs are very polite . And the music is great.
There are 2 floors . Prefer the upper floor. Which has an awesome decoration with funky lights. A must try restro.
Horlicks cooler - a must try item and also their signature cooler. Varieties of mojitos are also available. 
Cost for 2 -1000/- aprx excluding hookah.
Hookah costs 400/- with variety of flavours and unlimited coal changes.

Located on the right hand of the south city college near golpark this is a newly opened joint n a must for all food n music lovers.
Ambience: Electrifying neon lights with led shoots. Well decorated with music themes n good choice of mixed music. Just need a dance floor to get you started.
Food: Menu is not vast but good enough to satisfy your taste buds.
We tried Patthar ke ghost- melt in your mouth mutton prep. Gondhoraj fish - good size 6 pc fish with too good dhonepata bata. Pork chop - a decent 6 inch pork chop just perfectly cooked in a perfect sauce with mash potato n blanched veges.
Drinks: This place does not serve alocohol but drinks like watermelon mojito , cucumber mojito n their speciality why not horlicks is great to substitute.
All in all a must visit to uplift your mood.

Another hidden gem and at a fantastic location. 
Reach Golpark crossing. Take the 1st left lane (Tantuja lane) after crossing Mouchak towards Anjali Jewellers. The restaurant will be on your left as you walk in. 

The ambience, staff and the food - par excellence !

Horlicks Shake - whosoever thought you'd be talked into this drink without your mom being around ? :) Absolutely awesome!

Patthar Kebab tasted just right. Soft succulent mutton, a bit like Galauti kebab but in an unique spicy blend. Very nice and markedly different to the typical Kebabs that we are so used to.

Golden fried prawns - distinctly different from the China town cousins. 

The Chello Kebab was nice. A break from the traditional Park Street cuisine as the rice was not Basmati and not as buttery. But the sheekh kebab and the malai kebab were both very tasty. The barbequed onions and tomatoes added flavour and promise to the dish. Nice experience overall

Time for dessert - fried ice cream. Not the honey noodle with a dollop of ice cream as most restaurants pass off as fried ice cream. Crunchy coconut shell with soft vanilla ice cream inside... glazed in a bed of chocolate sauce. Mmmmm ....

Pocket pinch and portion size ? 
Portion size definitely good. Prices slightly on the higher side, but you pay for the experience rather than the real food at a great restaurant, isn't it ? 

Overall - great experience and the family loved it.
Deb was fantastic guiding us with the menu. Ask for him - smart sweet and extremely well behaved boy who adds to the feel good about the place.

Would be back soon...

This place is amazing.
We ordered a crunchy fried chicken, which was delicious. There were 6 pieces of chicken that was juicy and the crunchy at the same time. One of the best fried chicken I've had in Kolkata! We also had a grilled chicken pizza. It was a thin crust pizza loaded with grilled chicken and cheese. Loved it ♥
The quantity of the food was satisfactory too. :)
The ambience too is worth mentioning! The music playing, the decor, the lights (they have neon lights that make the place look even cooler😍)!! Perfect place to just laze around for hours over some hookah and great food!
Will surely visit again!

Why Not is located in Golpark inside an alley between the alleys of Mitra Cafe and Cafe Coffee Day. The place is quite large and can accommodate a good amount of people. We were a group of nine people and the staff were quite courteous to help us adjust with the seating. Why Not have a special neon lighting effect which was fantastic and enjoyable initially but becomes quite boring with time. We ordered Crispy Chilli Babycorn for starters and Chicken Steak, Chelo Kebab, Veg Lasagna and Grilled Fish for main course, thus deciding to have a continental main dish. The Chelo Kebab which is actually one of their best made delicacies as recommended by the waiter was well made. The Chelo Kebab was also one of the small number of dishes which was priced reasonably. I loved the Grilled Fish as well. Most of their food items are a tad overpriced especially the Chinese ones. The place has a nice playlist with most of the songs belonging to Coke Studio which I thoroughly enjoyed. But the music was well loud which makes it quite difficult to have a good old chat with near and dear ones. So I will recommend people who are meeting after a long time and have lots to talk about to give this place a miss since it will involve you speaking at the top of your lungs which makes me question the authorities, "Why not lower the volume as well as the prices of some of the items since most of them are very much overpriced?"
Hence, the place will leave a glaring hole in your pocket and is worth visiting once but not twice.

I suddenly came across this restaurant and being a foodie at once decided to try it out. It was Saptami morning and we were there exactly at 12noon. It was completely empty. We were seated at the ground floor. The order was
1. Grilled Fish: It was served with a lemon sauce, boiled veggies and mashed potato. One can even have rice instead of mashed potato. It was tasty especially the lemon sauce had a very distinct flavour. 
2. Chelo Kebab: This needs no description. I'm a fan of Peter Cat's Chelo Kebab and was sceptical in trying this one. But I really loved it. The kebab was succulent and the rice was just perfect with the egg on top. 
3. Virgin Mojito: Good one.
4. Watermelon Mojito: This was also good.

The food, ambiance, service everything was absolutely brilliant in this place!
Horlicks never tasted this good before until I tasted Why Not's signature Horlicks Shake. Watermelon Mojito was light and very refreshing!
From starters I would definitely go for the Golden Fried Prawns over anything. However, Gondhoraaj Fish and Gin Chicken Olivita was also very good.
One portion of Chelo Kebab for main course was very filling for two.
Lastly, for desserts we had the Fried Ice Cream & Why Not Special Sizzling Brownie. Both of them tasted amazing!
This place serves one of the best food and has truly won my heart!

What a mindblowing place!! Truly a hidden gem in the Golpark area..located in the Tantuja lane, why not is a must visit place in Kolkata for its food. The first floor ambience is great with Uv lights installed and a laid back ambience. Very nice place to hang out. Must try are patthar ka gosht, pesto chicken, chicken lasagne and pork chops. Chelo kebab was good too. Why not special fried icecream was yummy. We were too full to try more desserts. Quantity is quite huge so 2 people can easily share.  Service was impleccable..very friendly. Had a wonderful time with friends here. Will return soon to try the Standing pomfret.

Reach Golpark More, take the Kotak Mahindra lane and you will get Why Not to your left.

The place is divided into 2 floors, a narrow staircase leading to the upper floor which will impress you with the seating arrangements, lights and a fabulous playlist!

The must orders - 

Why Not Special Horlicks Shake
Cucumber Delight
Patthar ke Gosht
Gondhoraj Fish
Golden Fried Prawn
Chelo Kebab

Service is great. Price is a bit on the higher side. 

Recommended!

Electrifying ambience, amazing and visually attractive decor, youthful atmosphere, trendy music, tremendous hospitality and a humble host cum owner is how would define this gem of a place! 
Located in golpark, this place is at a stones throw from South City college, hence locating this place would not be much of a problem. 

The ambience of this place is terrific, and at the first sight you are bound to get a positive vibe! The music elevates your experience and you would definitely be compelled to put on your dancing shoes. They have arrangements for live music too! 
Now coming to the food, i was extremely pleased and impressed with the quality, quantity and presentation of each and every dish! The prices are reasonably, sometimes slightly on the higher side depending on the dish but once you start ordering, the price factor gets elimated on account of what this place has to offer! 

-- The why not Horlicks shake is one of their specialities and this is something you should definitely try. 

- the watermelon mojito packs a solid punch and i would highly recommend it. It was very refreshing and reenergizing.

- for the health conscious folks, the cucumber delight should be your ideal pick.
-- the patthar ke gosht was extremely sumptuous and delectable. 
-- the gin chicken olivita was extremely well prepared and it came in generous proportion. 

- the gondhoraj fish tasted fine too with hardly any faults. 
-- the golden fried prawns scored well in terms of presentation and taste. 
-- the chelo kebab was quite a classic and i really Loved it. This place definitely sets a high standard for their chelo. 
- --the payala or the Spanish pulao is something which i would suggest everyone to try. A large proportion of spiced rice with crabs, prawns, pork, chicken is quite the dream combination one can bargain for and one portion is more than enough for 3-4 people.
-- the why not special sizzling brownie is a speciality you cannot miss. A desert lovers ideal dish! 

To sum up, this place is should definitely be your go to option if you are planning to have some great time with your friends!

Why Not, one of the live music restaurants in the Kolkata city lives up-to it's reputation. The ambiance, service , food and everything is great over here. Located in Golpark, Gariahat Road, Gariahat, Kolkata, it's relatively difficult to find unless you ask someone. 

Spacious and comfortable seating. Pleasing music and a great place to catch up. The non veg had more variety and looked appetizing.  A great dance place or date place with stunning food.

DRINKS :

1) Why Not Special Horlicks Shake
2) Watermelon Mojito
3) Cucumber Delight

FOOD :

1) Gin Chicken Olivita
2) Gondhoraj Fish
3) Golden Fried Prawn
4) Chelo Kebab
5) Standing Pomfret
6) Payala (Spanish Pulao)

Payala (Spanish Pulao) :
A near perfect spanish pulao with a bed of prawns kings. It initially tasted a bit bland but after spicing it up, it tasted somewhat good. It was extremely good. * Highly Recommended* 

Gin Chicken Olivita : 
The chicken kebabs here are to die for. They are spicy and tasty. With such an amazing taste, you'll end up wanting more.

Standing Promfret :
Which was so fresh and yummy I finally got a place which serves both my favorite fish in a awesome combination.

And yeah don't forget "Why Not Special Horlicks Shake" and "Why Not Special Sizzling Brownie" <3

DESSERTS :

1) Fried Ice Cream
2) Why Not Special Sizzling Brownie

The staff was very friendly. Kudos to the guy who makes the music playlist here. All in all was a great experience.

The time spent here was an amazing one. Had moderate expectations but at the end it turned out to be an amazing evening.
Stationed at Golpark this joint serves amazing set of dishes which surely can give your taste buds a roller coaster ride while you are here.
The dishes we had were just so good and worth mentioning.
So my favourites you include: Gondhoraj Fish, Golden Fried Prawn, Patthar Ke Gosht, fried ice cream and sizzling brownie.
Every item here was just pitch perfect.
Presentation was just top notch.
The food here is worth having. My star performer here would be the Gondhoraj fish which was probably the best dish that i had this month.
Pretty awesome place serving lip smacking delecasies . Each penny you spend here is worth its usage.
If you got a bunch ready to place their penny over some good food and pretty amazing ambience and decor you gotta hit this place . Hookah is also served here which adds to the list.
This place definetly gets a 'Must visit' tag from me.

If you want a fun-filled time with great music and awesome ambiance, this is the place.. Located near south city college, this is an easy place to find. The interior is done nicely with mini replicas of musical instruments and posters and has a sporty vibe. You're welcomed with a warm smile. What made me like the place first was the hospitality and warmth. Then the food.
Coming to the food, we had Patthar ke gosht, Gin chicken olivita and Gondhoraj fish for starters. You CANNOT miss the Patthar ke gosht if you're here.. Its one of the best mutton starters I've had.
For the main course we took Chelo kebab, Jumbo pork chop and Payala (a Spanish preparation, like pulao which was highly recommended by the staff). Both the pork chop and Chelo kebab were good. Pork chop had a great sauce and the chelo kebab was buttery and soft. Payala was what overwhelmed us. It came in a plate-ful and is a rice preparation which had prawn, sausages, chicken and more. It 
can easily be shared by 3 people.
In drinks, we started with the Why Not special Horlicks shake. This is the best horlicks I've had and it will remind you of your childhood days. We also tried the Cucumber delight and Watermelon mojito. Watermelon mojito was another must try.
Lastly we finished off our dinner party with Fried icecream and Why Not special sizzling brownie. The brownie looked and tasted amazing, so did the icecream.
Overall we had a fabulous time at this cafe and I'll highly recommend it. Only thing is, at first the prices may overwhelm you but the quantity and quality of food will more than make up for it.

"Swag se karenge sab ka swagat" -that is what you get to feel once you check into this place!
An amazing place, which is one of my favourites now, is just 3.5months old. Miss it at your own risk!
There's lot to say about the ambiance starting from their neon lights arrangements to the musical setting and the artificial turf walls and what not.
You just can't get enough of this place I swear!

Drinks
~~~~
🔽Well coming to the food, we started off our Thursday dinner delight with their most special Horlicks shake. Interesting isn't it? Never knew even a health drink can get in the shape of delicacy.
🔽 Watermelon mojito was the most charming one. We just couldn't stick to one order. This good looking drink with a hint of mint is equally good to taste trust me.

Starters
~~~~~
⏬Patthar k gosht is all about minced mutton chops garnished beautifully with a capsicum candle (picture given) on a white plate. It's YUM! A must order dish this is.👍

⏫Gondhoraj fish kebabs melts in your mouth and plays with your tastebuds like anything. Greenish Beauty, in short, with a slight hint of gondhoraj lebu. Can you just miss it??

⏬Golden fried prawns are simply mind boggling. Don't worry about the fried part, as it's not too oily. Perfectly sauteed dish this is.❤

Mains
~~~~
✔Chelo kebab, the stunner won our hearts instantly. Quantity was great I must say. Buttered rice with a poach and non veg kebabs was LAJAWAB! Enough for two too.

📛Here comes the most interesting dish of the day named PAYALA. It's another name is Spanish polao and contains almost everything under the sun on a single plate.
@Yes you read that right.😉 
One stop solution for pork aka chicken aka lobster lovers. Huge quantity and superb quality.
P.S. one should have the polao with it's garlic dip. Delicious is an understatement actually.
🍧 Brownie with ice cream had a strong chocolate flavour and a very chewy texture. Loved every bit of it!! Wish the brown beauty never ended.
Special THANKS to the host and owner of the place for being the excellent food guide to us :)
Highly recommended👍👍

Infact each and every dish is good. Just don't expect the mocktails to be good enough, that's really disappointing. It's located in the lane just opposite of golpark Ramkrishna mission.

I don't know about the food rating here. But we really liked this place. The decor was great. Although a bit too dark for having food but great none the less. The staff were very polite. Place has a great music collection. Coming to the food we ordered pork chops and chello kebab. The portions are huge of this place. Coming to the actual food, the pork chops were great, it was cooked perfectly had a very distinct flavor nothing i had anywhere else. And the chello kebab was also good, expect the malai kebab which wasn't upto my liking and to my surprise the shekh kebab was delicious. I would love to visit this place again.

Let me first talk about the ambience. It is one of the most well decorated restaurants that I have ever seen. Different musical instruments, variety of lights and the grass carpet makes it look really good. 
They serve continental food, which is my personal favourite. We ordered bacon wrapped chicken for the starters and white sauce pasta, spaghetti and bacon cheeserella for the main course. Every item was delicious. The pasta was filled with cheese. Bacon cheeserella was a unique preparation. It had rice at its base, which was covered with a thick layer of cheese and fried bacons. I would like to visit this place more.

Had heard about this resturant from a colleague and am happy that I took the advice. We tried their broccoli cheese soup which was one of the best soups I ever had. For starters we took bacon wrapped chicken, chilli mushroom and the crispiest french fries. Main course was pork chops, veg tetrazzini and prawn green curry and rice. I would recommend all to try the tetrazzini with its exotic veggies. Pork chop simply melts in your mouth. Their mocktails are the best in town please try their cucumber delight. They have a special mocktail which brings out childhood memory of horlicks, do try. I can't end this review without mentioning the friendly and helpful staff. Very well behaved and could make out that they do serve with care. I wish the team of Why not all the best.

This truly is a hidden gem. Tucked away in the bylanes of golpark, it is bang opposite of south city college.
It consists of 2 floors, if you visit this place always take the stairs to the upper floor. The upper floor more or less is like a sports lounge. It has green carpeting and various different types of lighting. Even though we visited in the afternoon but they happily showed us the different lighting conditions. Make sure to wear white if you want to see the magic. There were 2 huge led TVs that played coke studio all the time. The waiter said they had a tie up with coke studio. Overall the ambience was just awesum.

Coming to the service, everyone was quite courteous and service was prompt.

Now finally to the food. First of all they serve hookah only and no alcohol. The items that we ordered:

Paathar ka gosht: It is a rare kebab dish. You won't find it everywhere and honestly this is the 1st time I encountered this dish. 6 soft succulent pieces of mutton slow cooked on stone with a variety of spices. The mutton was softened and melts in your mouth. The spices were balanced just perfectly and not overpowering like in many other mutton kebabs. Overall a fantastic dish and a must try at this place.

Bacon wrapped chicken: People who like bacon will love this dish others who do not might not like this. Honestly I like my bacon crispy ,which was not in this case. Other than that the dish was nice. It has 6 pieces in all.

Pesto chicken: The highlight of our lunch. This dish simply blew our minds. Pesto chicken trumps all chicken kebabs I have tasted in my lifetime hands down. 6 boneless pieces of chicken grilled with pesto and mayo. Just order this dish.

Chicken tetrazzini: chunks of chicken cooked with spaghetti with cheese and white sauce. The quantity was sufficient for 2. It was a nice dish and tasted pretty good. But it can't compete with likes they serve in Mocambo and other continental places in park street.

Chicken lasagna: I personally felt this dish slightly lacking in quantity. Tastewise it was good and all my friends loved it. Again I must say it was good dish but I have tasted better lasagnas at other places.

Mixed grill platter: It had huge number of items from prawns,chicken hot dogs , chicken salami , pork salami, potatoes, mutton ribs , pork ribs and others. Most of it was good except the hot dogs which lacked flavor. Order this dish if you are a group of 4 or more.

A must visit place. They have live music in the evening.
P.S- The waiter said they are making some changes in the menu and they will upload the menu soon.
The charged a mandatory service charge of 200.

Visited this place in early July. It's a new place. 
I don't remember the name of the dishes properly (sorry) but we had ordered some chequered chicken, meatball pizza......green parrot and Shirley temple (latter two being mocktails).

Chequered chicken: it was really yum. Chicken pieces were moist and soft.

Meatball pizza: the meatballs were good but the pizza sauce was on the sweeter side (which I personally don't prefer)....so overall it was nice.

Green parrot was nice too. Shirley temple was just okayish.

Went there for navami dinner. 
Realised it was a hookah bar after we enter. 
We thought we would have to compromise on the food. 
But they proved us wrong. Starting from beverages to  hookah flavour. From welcoming staffs to great ambience , this place is a must visit. 
Oh god I can't get over the pork chops. We actually cried after it was over. Maybe that is true love.

I came to know of the existence of Why Not from t2 to which I am addicted. After going through some of the reviews on zomato, I, along with four other foodies, decided to give it a try and landed there for lunch on Saturday, 23rd September. The nearest landmark is South City College and people should have no problem in locating it.

The first thing that impressed us on entering was the ambience. We were ushered to a corner table on the ground floor near a giant HD LED TV playing Hindi hits. The depth of the images was amazing and it would be a good idea to go there when a cricket/football match is on. The seats were very comfortable. There is a cosy hookah lounge on the first floor where live music will be provided (at no extra cost) on Friday and Saturday evenings immediately after the Pujas.

Now we come to the food. We were advised by the staff to try their special Horlicks Shake and, after some hesitation, some of us  took the plunge. The taste reminded me of the Horlicks of my school days but I found it most refreshing. However, two of us tried their mocktails and were most impressed. They also serve prawn cocktails which I intend to try on my next visit.

For starters we had Patthar ka Gosht with mint sauce and the mutton seemed to melt in my mouth. This item is highly recommended for those who have no problem with red meat.

For the main course we decided to try continental and opted for chicken lasagne. This, too, was of the highest class and the portions large and extremely filling.

We rounded off with cream caramel pudding and sizzling brownie with vanilla ice cream. The brownie sizzler was quite tasty but I personally prefer brownies at room temperature.

But any review of Why Not would be incomplete if I did not refer to the impeccable service. The owner, Sandip,  and the staff treated us like royalty and offered several valuable suggestions which helped us in choosing the above-mentioned items.

...first & foremost, check the menu out!!!! Let me know if you do not die!!!!

& in case, you survive the death, have the PORK CHOP!!!!

Even if you are a big eater, the quantity served in the other dishes is enough to serve 2 people...

Just go....

খাদ্য প্রেমিকদের জন্য এক্কেবারে ideal জায়গা...
This was THE EXPERIENCE every foodie wants to have. A cozy environment, uniquely designed tables, clean and well decorated. The staffs had an everlasting smile on their faces and were extremely polite and caring. 
The 'GREEN PARROT' startled the taste buds and quenched my thirst. It was amazing. A great recommendation from one of the staffs.
The 'CHICKEN STROGANOFF' followed. It was yummy and juicy.
Tried my favourite dish 'CHILLI FISH' with a plate of 'MIXED FRIEDRICE'.... My taste buds hadn't been so happy before. The friedrice had a pinch of greatness mixed in its taste and thus needed a special mention.
Really wanted to try the desserts, but I was so full, it was beyond my capacity... 'মন চায়, পেট নাহি চায়' এর মতো অবস্থা... তবে আসছেবার অবশ্যই চেখে দেখবো...
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

This relatively new restaurant cum lounge has come up at Gariahat just beside the South City college. The place is quite large being spread across two floors. The lounge is situated on the second floor and in terms of decor and ambiance the place really lived up to my expectations. Ambiance is wonderful and so is the food along with the hookah that was served. Lots of variety is available and pricing is also reasonable. Staff were courteous but the only thing which did not go down well with me was that the place charges compulsory service charge on the bill, which should be done away with. Overall a wonderful place to cheer up your moods and spirits!!

Amazing! Superb! Definitely a class in itself when it comes to the food and the ambience of Why Not. I can say for sure that once you pay a visit here you will have a purpose in mind every time you step in again. Delicious Food, Hookah and mesmerizing music is not the only attraction.. There is something about this place that will stay with you in your mind and will ensure you walk in again blind folded. Just brilliant. Cheers!

It was yesterday's rainy noon and we were passing through Golpark when we decided to shelter ourselves in a newly churned out joint called Why Not. The place is about 3 and a half months old and is located in the lane that goes inside from the Kotak Mahindra Bank Branch, Golpark. Locationally advantageous with trendy and upbeat interiors, this place seems to have set a firm footing in the Kolkata Pub/Joint scene.
Coming to the decor, by the set up of it, you are sure to question yourself why isn't there booze yet?! Off course, they are planning for it which according to them would be soon available. The ground floor seems more of a Restro Bar, while the 1st floor completely makes you feel you are in a Sports Bar.
We dropped in there for a lunch (ironically), and so we ordered for a Kiwi mocktail (don't remember the name), Paththar ke Gosht in starters, Chicken Lasagna (mains) and Sizzling Brownie for dessert. Below are the item-wise reviews :
1. Kiwi mocktail - Brilliant ! Kiwi juice and triple sec coagulation added a unique flavour to it. Highly recommended.2. Paththar ke Gosht - This kebab was in my wishlist for long and I could only try it yesterday. Soft and tender boneless mutton flattened over stone rack or "Paththar" as they call it, is surely going to make you go gaga over it. A must try from my side.3. Chicken Lasagna - One of the best lasagnas I have ever had in Kolkata till date. The Parmesan and Mozarella was distinctly spread over the entire lasagna bed. The garlic bread was nice and complimented very well. My only suggestion - use a Lasagna dish to serve the same instead of a normal Continental round bottom dish.4. Sizzling Brownie - A yet another brilliantly decorated dish ! The in-house brownie sizzling over a hot plate with vanilla ice-cream and chocolate sauce topped over it will make you drool over. However, the brownie bed seemed a bit burnt and hence the cashew nuts lying on the bed was inedible. I would suggest the Chef to look over this issue.
Last but not the least, the service of the place spoke for itself. Mr. Sandeep, who took our order, was a gem of a person and his suggestions and knowledge of the menu was commendable. 0.5 points extra for his service. Chef Atanu who is head of the Tandoor department, also visited us and spoke at length about our likings. Paththar ke Gosht is something for which he will always be remembered for and we would like to explore his kitty further. All in all, though the pocket pinch was slightly more, but with this kind of service and quality, it is a matter of time when this outlet picks up the momentum and hits full house more often than ever. Till then, cheers to the team !

Best ambience in Kolkata... Best food in town.. Be it Indian, Chinese or Continentals... Mouth watering food, authentic recipe & mindblowing hospitality. What more could one ask for?  I can write an essey on Why Not!  But, more than the article, the place is to be experienced firsthand. That's where the contentment lies... In short,a must place to be in Kolkata.

Being a Zomato user from the beginning I didn't wrote a single review for any restaurant but this is something special. The quality of food and service received from this particular place has made me to come out my extreme laziness and write a review.
Why not is located near south city college and very easy to locate. The place is well decorated and the ambience is extraordinary specially the 1st floor which has uv lights installed. Now coming back to the main thing the show stopper the food. We had ordered pork chops, mutton cannelloni, standing pomfret, cheli kebab. The portions served was good for 2 people. Among all the items orders the best was the pork chops and the standing pomfret also deserves special mention. The quality and quantity was so good that it cannot be described by words or my words will not do justice for the amazing dishes served to us. So I would recommend my fellow foodie friends to visit this place. PS. Do try their caramel custard and fried ice cream.@

Food- We have oredered Mexican cheese balls (8 pieces 220 rupees) as starter, Veg. Lasagna (280 rupees) and Chicken Lasagna (350 rupees) with one Virgin Mary (150 rupees), Carribean fruit punch (170 rupees) and Sherley's temple (150 rupees). The Mexican cheese balls are  amazing and had melted in mouth and the accompanying sauce was adding the right punch of spice and freshness of juicy tomatoes, onions and herbs. The Virgin Mary and Carribean fruit punch (photo 2) was great. The Veg. Lasagna (photo 1) is the spicier one when compared to the chicken version of the same dish, and great in taste, It is a great combination of the continental and indian spices with the right amount of cheese. But the white sauce is absent. The chicken Lasagna is all about cheese and white sauce and this continental dish is at its best served here with two garlic bread slices. The quantity is adequate and we are full when left the place. But on first observation of the served dish we thought it to be of less in quantity though we were wrong in that assumption and that is proved.
Attire- The full music atmosphere is surreal and cossy. The place is great for a relaxed dining and cool adda with friends. Its a great enjoyment. The first floor dining area is heaven for music lovers.
Service- The service of all the working members are polite, honest and to the point.

Situated in Golpark, this place is easy to find - in the same lane as Tantuja.

i was searching for a new place to treat my JR on her birthday, when i stumbled on this place at zomato. Since it is very near to my hospital, i took her there on her birthday. I was so impressed, that i visited again within a span of 1 week to this very place.

1st time we had ordered, chelo kabab and lasagne. Lasagne tastes amazing while chelo kabab was good.
2nd time, we ordered fusilli pasta in wine sauce and smoked chicken pizza. Both were good but i liked the pizza more.
Both times we ordered fried ice cream for dessert. It tastes good, but if you don't like alcohol then you may not like it.

The decor is elegant, the ambiance is nice, staff is courteous, pocket pinch is reasonable. Planning to visit again.

Recently came to know about this lounge cum hookah bar through Zomato.

Few mins walking distance from Tantuja or Golpark Bus Stand I can say. I went to this place with two other friends of mine.

At first we were planning to sit in the ground floor itself but we were guided by one of the Staffs in the lounge area which is on the upstairs.

Once I entered... the ambience was the thing which made me go wowwwwww just wow 👌 staffs were very friendly and service was prompt as well. One will get a homely feeling in this place. Music... Lights... Everything was superb. Neon lights in the lounge area is such an innovative thing which looks so cool. One will just fall in love with it's ambience... Seating arrangements were all about cozy sofas for both the floors.

Now coming to the food...
We ordered veg sweet Corn soup, garlic bread and kitkat shake.

Soup was great
Kitkat shake was refreshing
Garlic bread tasted good as well.
Quantity was not bad.
Quality was good too.

Later on we asked for paan based hookah... It was an awesome one.

Pocket pinch is not too high not too inexpensive as well.

This new lounge cum hookah bar is Highly Recommendable if you love hookah.

After we got our food... Staffs were so courteous that personally they asked us wthether we liked the food and ambience... Was Happy to see their smiling faces.

I would surely love to visit this place again and again to try out other food items from this place.

Why Not is a must visit for everyone atleast once all I can say. Why Not!!!!!

P. S. : Do wear white cloth and see the magic if the neon light remains on (in the lounge area) 😛

This lounge cum hookah bar is situated in Golpark area in d lane of Tantuja show room. We were cordially welcomed by the lovely courteous staffs of this restro. The main trp is the ambience. We initially sat on the ground floor but later were taken to the 1st floor - the most happening place. The decor, the lightings, music, design everything were perfect. The owner herself were present all the time and was looking after everything. It gave us a homely feel.
Now coming to the food- we had fresh lime soda as cooler with pan fried fish and crunchy chicken. The chicken were juicy soft with crispy batter and the fish preparation was also tasty. 8 pieces of fish tossed in a red sauce with onion and capsicum.
In mains we had chicken lasagna and chello kabab. The lasgana was the best of all. So yummy cheesy and juicy with full of meats-a meat lovers delicacy. The chello kabab was also good. The buttered rice was perfect but the chicken kebabs were a bit less cooked but tasted nice. The price were inclusive of taxes and were decent. So this is a highly recommended place for all specially the teens.

If it's your birthday you should definitely go to this place. Nothing can be better than cutting a freshly baked cake while trying to blow out magic candles with the happy birthday song playing in the background. A big thank you to the 'Why Not' team for making my birthday memorable.

Yesterday I was really hungry and we decided to give this place a visit. This place hasn't got much ratings on zomato. But as I said in my earlier review I don't trust zomato ratings anymore and yes to be honest don't trust zomato ratings. Because you don't know what surprises you'll get visiting high rated joints and low rated joints. And thus it happened. My fiancé found out about this place a long time ago. And we're planning to give this place a visit. And it happened it yesterday and I was proven right. Ratings don't matter here on zomato.

Location : Golpark more. Tantuja saree shop that alley go straight and you'll find this huge outlet there. 3 minutes walking distance. Very easy to locate.

Interiors : The interior is pretty much greenish. And well decorated. Guitars hanging from the wall. Music going on. Live music are also done bere. Tgis is a newly open3d joint so don't expect much as very few people kniw about this joint so mostly remains empty.

Food: There was lot to offer to offer in thwir menu card but most if the items were not available only continental and Tandoor. As they're newly opened they don't offer much because people don't show up. Not their fault.
I wanted have hookah but they didn't had any hookah menu so they send forward a hookah specialist who gave us a lot of suggestions I ended up ordering Grape Mint flavour with Ice based.

The hookah was simply outstanding.

The flavour was there with ample amount which barely any hookah outlet serves with ice based made me feel seventh heaven.

I loved it I don't know why they were treating us very nicely mostly of the joints don't treat so nicely

Mainly because it's newly opened and they want to attract people and I mean they should its a beautiful joint and they serve really good food and hoolah. The coolers are good too. Definitely a must visit.

Now coming to the coolers

Oreo Shake : Oreo shake was hand made by one if the servers and it tasted heavenly. The ample amount of chocolate and other stuff made it feel like this is bliss.

We saw beef steak on their menu card and was really happy. But sadly they didn't have it. So,

We ordered according to their suggestions

Bacon wrapped Prawn : Bacon wrapped prawn was simply amazing it's a must try when you visit this place. The juicy prawn and the bacon wrapped around it with the ample amount of delicious ingredients won over my heart. We just loved it.

Adrak Ka Mutton : We ordered this according to their suggestion was also mind blowing from the house if Tandoor. It was simply great. The tandoor mutton had every thing to offer. And we're really happy. It was delicious. Juicy mutton. I mean just go and try you'll know.

Plus the way they presented the food was really awesome.

Lastly we ordered

Coffee : The coffee was great too everything in proportion.

The bill came in along with cholomint. The cholomint was served in a small plastic bike which was cute.

Everything is oerfect about this place. Go and give this place a trt and make it the most happening place in South Kolkata.

Happy Eating.

Cheers!

Well, this is my secind venture to this place and after a long debate with my buddy I again decided to give this place a visit.

Again this place did not disappoint me. They welcomed us well and they recognised us the moment we entered. We were again seating on the same place like the other day. Nitin the hookah guy was again at my hookah service. This guy came from Goa after 1.5 years and makes very good stuff. Go to this place and ask for Nitin he will be at your service.

We ordered for Virgin Mary and Sweet Lime Soda

Chicken Malai Kebab

Chicken Lasagna

Grilled Fish

Awesome just awesome

Wear a neon clothes before going to this place

Cheers!

Newly opened cafe / lounge in Golpark. Sandy da has done an amazing job with the ambience and interiors. The food is lip smacking. The chelo kebabs and the malai kebab are to die for.
Their finger food is a great mix to start off with.
What's more - they have live gigs on Friday nights ! Add to that karaoke evenings starting soon this month.

After eating here, the only thought that comes to my mind is 'God bless the management of this restaurant'. The food is excellent and this is one of those few places in Calcutta where the customer is treated as God....something other places should learn to imbibe. The person who served my drink asked me 'Sir, can you please taste the mojito and tell me if its ok'. The same was asked to my wife. I really appreciate such gestures as it reflects class and professionalism of the staff.
So folks, come out of the folklore of park street restaurants, discard the cockroach infested upholsteries and arrogant staff of peter cat and mocambo, say goodbye to prehistoric menu and tasteless foods of those restaurants,  and try these new places. WHY NOT??

Great ambience meets even better food. You get the city's best pork chops out here, the meat is so soft the knife will cut through it as if cutting through butter. The bacon in bacon wrapped prawns is not all fat but has just the right amount of meat. Also you'll know the place means business when you find body splash and hair gel in the rest room for the occassional need.
