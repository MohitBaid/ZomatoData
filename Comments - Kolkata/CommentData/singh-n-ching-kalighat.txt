so maybe the singh part maybe good of this place but the ching part is definitely not... we called for a full fledged dinner to be delivered through Zomato… I have to say that the packing and everything looked very impressive… and I was really looking forward to a good experience… alas it was not to be… the chow and rice were bland and we had to “fix it up”… the disappointing part is that the sides and gravy were tasting as they had used ready to eat packets which are available in and around town… real let down and not tasty… so as said maybe the singh part is something to think about as I have not tried it but the ching is not…

So far I have tried their Chicken Pulao, Singh's Bling and Murg Bhuna Masala. Home delivery was well within time. Their chicken pulao is highly recommended as that is something am yet to have in any other restaurant. The chicken piece in pulao has some kind of keema stuffing. Rest 2 side dishes too were extremely good and tasty.

Ordered the veg Chinese combo with haka noodles 
It has
Crispy chilli babycorn
Schezwan potato
Veg manchurian
Hakka noodles 
Kimchi
They give the combo with separate mini bottles for  chilli sauce, soya sauce and vinegar.
The combo is pretty inexpensive compared to the other combos in other places, it taste's delicious as well and it is more than enough for one person. 
It is filling, tastes delicious and is value for every penny.

I've been ordering lunch from many a places but with disappointment. Browsing swiggy, I found you. With a little hesitation i booked a non veg chinese combo. I am hooked at first bite. The quality and quantity of the food is just beyond words. Every single dish is prepared with excellence and love. Thanks for being there..


Update 15-11-2017

Ordering almost everyday from this place , and the quality and quantity has remained unchanged. Hats off to you guys. Keep it up.

A delivery joint in South Calcutta that undoubtedly offers a great quality of food! This food joint is highly recommended as we went on tasting every dish one after another. The wide array of dishes are penned down below-

Singh-Di-Jodi- perfect tender pieces of mutton Shami kabab that brings a huge smile on every one's face.
Fish ajwaini tikka- Perfect yoghurt marinated fish with a strong flavour of ajwain or carom seeds.
Oh My Gosht- perfect tender mutton pieces in a delicious north indian curry.
Chilli garlic prawn - strong garlic flavour that completely smothered the prawn pieces.
In addition, Orange glazed prawn was quite noteworthy.
Fish N wine tasted on point with the right tinge of wine in it.
Now let's turn on to the staple dishes.
Ching's special chicken rice is at a great taste with some secret spices enhancing its flavour.
Burnt garlic fried rice with an exact delactable garlic taste was one of my favorites.
Last but not the least was Chilly Garlic Chicken Noodles that soothed our soul and stomach.
To end with, I thank Tanmay Basak for inviting us and Cristia Rozario for hosting us.

Just discovered this delivery joint near Kalighat and ordered a Dal Makhanwali and Jeera Rice to try out the place. The delivery took about 40-45 minutes near Tollygunge and charged Rs 25 extra since the order amount was below Rs 400. 

Both the food are given in good quantity and are extremely delicious! The prices are decent, and I am really satisfied with the food. Looking forward to try their non-veg items soon! Anyone living near this place should try it out at least once, it is highly recommended!

When North India meets China..!! Yes.. As the name suggests you will get both North Indian Dishes as well as Chinese dishes. This is basically a delivery joint and trust me havnt expected that quality food. My goodness it’s more than what I expected. A delivery joint having immense numbers of dishes in the list. Commendable…!!

It has two menu ie., Singh Special and Ching Special.

First i come to the Singh Special (North Indian dishes). 

We had Garlic Naan, Kulcha, Dal Makhanwali, Fish Ajwain Tikka, Singh di jodi and O my Gosht..!!

Kulcha, Naan and Dal was nice.

Fish Ajwain Tikka – where you will get the taste of ajwain or carom seeds, its basically fish being tandoored after being marinated with ajwain, yogurt and other ingredients. The flavor of ajwain is strong enough.

Singh di Jodi – It is a nice thing on the menu as it is mutton seekh kebab having a layer of chicken, making it a dual combination. Really nice and a recommended one. Very soft and the taste was perfect.

O my Gosht – Oooo really a recommended one. Mutton being cooked with mutton keema.. Perfect in taste.. Rich flavours.. Spicy.. Thumbs up to this recipe.

Secondly i come to the Ching Special (Chinese). 

We had Burnt Garlic Fried Rice, Chilli Garlic Noodles Chicken, Ching Special Chicken Rice, Fish n Wine, Chicken Trump Card, Orange Glazed Prawns and Chilli Garlic Prawns.

Let me start with my favorite Prawn items.

Chilli Garlic Prawns- Prawn quality is good enough. Spicy and the taste of garlic is perfect. Good one. Taste is upto the mark.

Orange Glazed Prawns- Another recommended one. Very nice. Awesome in taste. The flavor of orange is strong over here. Really loved this one. Perfect.

Chicken Trump Card- Boneless chicken being cooked with chinese flavor sauce with garlic. It is fried and a dry one. Good in taste.

Fish n Wine- A new thing that tried. Didn’t disappointed me. Nice in taste and can feel the essence of wine.

Rice and noodles are good enough.

The first time that I have tasted food from a delivery joint did not disappoint me, rather it had been so so wonderful from me. Singh n Ching's delivery joint offers varied Chinese and Indian dishes and I could not have asked for more. All the dishes left me awestruck. All of them were equally delicious and mouthwatering.
▪Among the Indian dishes were Garlic Naan, Kulcha, Kasturi Kabab Masala, Singh di Jodi, Fish Ajwain Tikka, Dal Makhani and O My Gosht!. The Garlic Naan and Kulcha were exquisite. The Dal Makhani had a rich flavour and a strong scent. Fish Ajwain tikka had just the right amount of ajwain to make it special and O my Gosht is something I do not have words for. It was the best!
▪Coming to the Chinese dishes we had Burnt Garlic Fried Rice, Ching's special chicken Rice, Chilli Garlic Chicken noodles, Fish n Wine, Chicken Trump Card, Chilli Garlic Prawns and Orange Glazed prawns. Both the Fish trump card and Orange Glazed prawns were my favourite and the best part is they were a lovely combination or sweet and spicy. Fish n Wine was totally a new thing for me and it did justice to my taste buds and the other dishes too.

All in all, this is the best delivery joint and it has not failed to satisfy my crazy taste buds and my intense love for food! All hail Singh N Ching!

I must accept that Singh n Ching is one of the best delivery joints, I have tasted. Serving both, chinese and north indian, delicacies from both the cuisines are extremely flavoursome and temptimg.

We discovered this place by accident about a year back and have been hooked ever since. This is a Delivery only joint  in Kolkata and is one amongst hundreds in the city. But it is one of the best in terms of taste and service. Another good thing about them is that they customize their orders as per the customers requirements. Another important info is that they serve you in the breaks. 12 Noon to 4 PM, 6 PM to 10:30 PM. Kindly confirm in the phone number though. Please order for food that satisfies your soul! Its one of the few Food joint which can boast of excellent service along with mouth watering dishes. What I totally love about this joint is the variety of food it serves. And each dish has an amazing taste, be it Garlic Nan, Gosht, Lasooni Kabab or Fish from Chinese Menu !

P.S their delivery time can be sometimes be a little more.

We received the delivery on time as per our requirement.  The food was good enough and fresh. They were packed in a very net and clean manner. Quantity wise also it was sufficient. I highly recommend the place to others.

The name Singh N Ching makes it evident that it is a place where you can get both Indian(mainly North Indian) and Chinese dishes. I have ordered their combo meals quite a few times and have found them  to be tasty and value for money. The quantity is sufficient for one person and the packaging is done very well. I personally find their Fried Rice to be better than the noodles. Few people may find their food a little spicy. Overall a good place to order food. 
Food: 3.5/5
Packaging: 4/5

Ordered Mutton do piaza from Singh N Ching, Kalighat. Delivery took around 1 hour. Here is the review 

 They describe the dish as: Mutton in lots of onions, mixed with onions in lots of Mutton. Really, the quantity was good & the amount of onion they put in that dish surprised me, was more than enough. 
       
 I didn't like the dish that much. Thought I love Mutton, it seemed an average one to me. I will rate it as 3/5.

Expected a good dinner, had an average one.

It was one of those hot n humid afternoon when mum wasn't in a mood to cook! So we decided to order some food. Craving for some good Chinese food, I was scrolling through the Chinese combos and found Singh n Ching!
This was one place I wanted to try for quite some time. Their combos looked delicious and I went ahead with the Chinese Veg Combo and placed the order through one of the food delivery apps.

The Chinese Veg Combo included the following-
An option of Fried Rice/Hakka Noodles,
Veg Manchurian,
Crispy fried Babycorn,
Potato in hot Garlic sauce,
some Kimchi Salad, and
a Chinese kit consisting of soy sauce, chilli-vinegar, and green chilli sauce.

The food arrived within the time stated and was packaged very nicely. The whole thing looked of premium quality. It was hot, totally fresh and the aroma filled the room. The food not just looked good but all the items had a great taste to it and was cooked to perfection. We had opted for the Hakka Noodles and it was very well prepared. The food was not too overly spiced, which is generally the case at many outlets across the city.

After having a good experience the first time, next up, I'll be trying out their Indian Combos, which looks equally scrumptious.
One that I would definitely recommend​, and a place you guys should definitely not miss out onn, for when you are ordering food. Because, where else can you get this premium food quality at a nominal price of 150/-.
Note-They don't charge any extra VAT or other taxes as well

Ordered a ching combo meal, to our surprise it was perfectly wrapped so that the food remains hot. 
Taste of 'baby corn' was good,
'fried rice' was also good in taste
'manchurian' tasted too good
'chilly potatoes' were okayish
Salad was missing.
Rest, overall the food was in appropriate quantity and tasted good 👍

We ordered for Dal Makhani, Paneer Lajawab, chilli cheese naan, Masala Kulchla and Garlic coriander rice. Everything was just perfect and impressive except the dal makhani which was decent. But totally loved this place. It is worth every penny spent.

Where to start with this place,I have been ordering their food for over a year now,living alone it's sometimes hard to have good food when you're feeling lazy and don't want to either cook something or go out. 
This place has been a lifesaver for a glutton like me, everything on the menu I've tried until now is delicious.
The tandoori chicken is always moist and seasoned well,Aalu Nawabi,which is tandoori potatoes stuffed with a dry fruit mixture,is a personal favourite and a delight. Their Kheema Rice,Veg Hakka Noodles,Kung Pao Chicken,Tangri Kebab,Salt and Pepper Mushrooms all have been delights to have.
However,this one time I ordered a chicken salad from there they gave me orange slices in the salad when the menu said they'd have avocado. That is the only disappointing dish I can remember.

The food is packed very nicely and is always warm when it arrives,the person who takes the order on the phone is also well-spoken and has always patient when I fumble awkwardly in deciding what I'd like to order. 

The prices they charge for the food are reasonable and the quantity for most dishes is enough for two people. They didn't have a credit card machine the last time I asked them,but they said they'd be getting it soon. 

Great food. Highly recommended.

After reading all the reviews on Zomato I decided to go for the combo meal. Since they do not deliver in my area, I had to opt for take away. 
The food was packed in such a presentable manner and it was piping hot. I loved the noodles in the non-veg (Chinese) combo meal! Coming to the non-veg (Indian) combo meal the roti and the dal was very tasty. 
It is pocket friendly and the food is sumptuous and the taste is quiet good. Would love to order from here again. Recommended!! 😂😂

I've been noticing this place for quite some time on Zomato now. And last Monday I couldn't control my happiness as I received food from Singh n Ching.

Within 45mins the amazing food arrived and my heart melted at the aroma.

Instead of beating around the bush, let me just come to the food directly.

Starters :

• I was in the mood for some soup and luckily they had sent me their special soup known as Cornilicious. The portion was amazing and it had a generous amount of chicken and corn kernels. Tasted quite good.

• Fish Trump Card - this was a Chinese starter which I simply LOVED!!!!! Honestly, I was not expecting a restaurant named Singh n Ching to serve such amazing Chinese. Okay I might sound biased but whatever! There 8 large pieces of fish which were soft and juicy. It was cooked in a tangy sauce which a lemony aftertaste. Oh how I loved this dish!

• Chicken Lasooni Kebab - I received a north special kebab dish and this was what it was - lasooni kebab. The portion again was no doubt amazing. 6 chunks of chicken, soft and succulent. However this dish sort of disappointed me. The flavour of garlic was a bit too overpowering. I just hope they balance it out the next time.

Mains :

The main course simple and authentic. It consisted of Butter Naan and Murgh Makhani. Oh man..I'm drooling already. The naan had an overwhelming amount of butter which gladdened my heart and it wasn't tough at all. It was thin and soft - the perfect kind of naan. Now the Murgh Makhani tasted out of this world. The gravy was rich and sinful and was full of tender shredded chicken. The portion was wow again. It took me and my mom 2 meals to finish it off fully. The naan tasted heavenly with the Makhani. I'm so craving it right now as I pen this review right now. This combination can never go wrong and I'm recommending it!

The delivery time is short. They deliver you exactly at the time they promise. Very commendable.
The packing of the food items were also praiseworthy. For extra precaution, they film wrap each of the plastic containers. Really happy with the service.

I'm very satisfied with Singh n Ching and I'm definitely ordering food from here! Remember, I gotta try out the Chinese main course?
All my love to Team Singh n Ching.

After reading such amazing reviews about this place finally ordered 

We ordered chilli garlic noodles and veg Hakka chow, and both were average and bland. The chilli garlic noodle didn't have any chilli

For vegetables we ordered a tsing hoi potato which was to die for, the veg manchurian was also average
Overall very average experience!!! 

Was expecting much much better food!!!! Will try again

Biggest downside is that they done deliver in central Avenue area

I never use to rate a delivery joint so high... as I feel they always remains short in ambience n deco... so need to judge them only on their food n delivery system... but this place stands out...
I ordered for...
◆ Singh di jodi ◆ Palak corn ◆ Cheese chilli naan 
From their Singh section...
And...
◆ Ching's special chicken noodles ◆ Hell's gate...
From their Ching section...
Believe me guys... each and every dishes were just insane... also I like their packaging... and last but not the least... 
Pocket pinch was quite friendly...
P.S: The dishes I ordered from the Ching section are strictly for spicy people only... you can give it a try if you have a brave heart...

This is the 2nd time we have ordered from Singh n Ching and result, its again a SIXER. Absolutely bang on. The Chinese dish was 10/10 and now today we ordered 3 naan, 2 masala kulcha, 2 cheese chili naan, crispy chili baby corn, methi matter malai , paneer makhani, malai kofta, vej diwani handi. we ordered for 6 person and its absolutely very much sufficient. we ordered for office lunch . All the items are delivered HOT. The preparations are much light than arsalan or alibaba categories.  The prices are very much pocket friendly and the quantities are just at par  with the price. This time we have deliberately ordered for  Vegeterian Dishes and we are happy that it is 10/10 from all the sections like price, qty, taste, packaging, delivery. Its a must try.

And the vegetarian food,too,the amount was a little less of the curry (that was paneer) we ordered. And except that,the taste was good. We would definitely like to visit the place,for trying out other different items available. :)

First of all if you have seen the movie related to the name you would already know how this restaurant would be like . 
Okay..so..I ordered food with home delivery and after having it I was in a confusion that wether I had too much of salt in my food before this or I did not because I felt that they FORGOT TO PUT SALT . Apart that I would be sarcastic if I said that the food was good . 
And for the people ordering even after reading my review GOOD LUCK to you ! And ya..have a backup plan ready ..
I have to mention this point ( im being sarcastic ) the packing was asif this food is to be sealed and protected from some virus or stuff . It will take you time to figure out how to start opening your packed food .

I used to think this to be a delivery only restaurant but actually there is no such restaurant named as Singh N Ching, there is a restaurant in kali temple road named as new novelty dhaba and Singh N ching is the name of the delivery section of that dhaba, little confusing, so if anyone tries to find it by name then he won't find it for sure. Better to order via calling them directly or via swiggy/zomato.  I opted for a take away. Food they serve are excellent. Ordered masala kulchas, chicken anarkali kabab, fish ajwaini tikka, fish the trump card and oh my gosht. Though all the items were good special mention goes to fish the trump card-its like pan fried chili fish but with added flavour of kaffir lime which makes it more aromatic, flavourful and it has little more tanginess & sweetness to it which makes it lip-smacking, a must try here. From the description of oh my gosht I thought it to be boneless mutton boti in keema gravy but actually it turned out to be boned mutton with very little meat in it so didn't like that much but the keema gravy was delightful. In ajwaini fish tikka the quality of fish used was very good but lack of salt has made it little bland. Apart from these 2-3 shortcomings other things were great, packaging was good, they don't add extra VAT and service tax so it will be pocket friendly. I got some discount also as it was their anniversary day. Overall we had a good experience and love to try other items in near future...

Ordered in for the first time from this one on a Monday afternoon. Went with the chef's recommendation and got Singh di Shaan and Murgh Makhani. The service was excellent. Got it delivered by half an hour. The packaging was rather intriguing and it was nice to see the little white round boxes they used to pack the achar, pudina chutney and salad. 
The Murgh Makhani was abundantly creamy and had well minced pieces of chicken,nicely cooked. I thought a little more salt would have made it perfect. The quantity was overwhelming too. Singh di Shaan is nothing but Chicken Tikka cooked in spicy yoghurt. The pieces were soft, succulent and juicy. Loved the taste. 
The price seemed to be a bit on the higher side compared to it's alternatives but it was worth it. A good experience :) Will try out the other dishes soon.

Sorry, but this is not a review but a question to the authorities of 'Singh n Ching'.
Just looking at the menu and the beautiful pictures of the food that people have shared I cannot wait to order food for my entire family from here. But, everything depends on their answer to this question of mine:
My aunt is a Vaishnavite and thus a 'pure' vegetarian (no onion, garlic, spring onion etc.)
We have certain take-away places where they DO offer to cook her food without adding those things. Would you guys do the same if asked to? It would be great if you could. 
P S - The rating is completely based on what I read and saw about your place from zomato...

If you are looking for home delivery of great Chinese food then Singh n Ching comes to our rescue. I have already tried their Cornillicious chicken soup, Chicken spring roll, Konjee crispy Chicken, Chicken fried rice, Chicken Hakka noodles, Chilli chicken and more. Each dish has excellent taste. The way they pack their food and send it along with individual sauces is great. So you can easily carry it home without the tension of the gravy spilling out. If you have any queries feel free to call them because they are very polite and patient in answering your queries. I have only tried their Chinese and aim at tasting their Indian very soon. Thumbs up and keep up the great service......

My stars predicted I would be surprised, what a fantastic surprise I got, courtesy@ Singh N Ching. I ordered - chicken polau, mildly scented basmati but the zing was in the yummy tandoori chicken which had a interesting inner pocket full of titbits of chicken. Next was Murgh Makhani which had a distinct kasuri methi flavour but the shredded Tandoori chicken with spices and butter and ring of cream had a cosy and tantalising affair with my taste buds. Murg Lasooni kebab was a soft succulent chicken that added warmth to the cold night. Dal Makhani and tandoori roti- my all time favorite on chilly nights were the next sprightly guest on my platter and they were Amazing... Guys you people are Rocking with piping hot and tasty food with carefully packed accompaniments. Thanks for such a wonderful Meal

Got some food home from here. To Begin with, the packing was amazing. Everything was still hot and fresh when the food reached home. On opening the package, the delicious smell of food was all that savoured around our house. And at last the taste was brilliant too. The dal makhani was superb and the kofta melted in our mouth.

1 word for the food - Amazing! Happened to order just 2 dishes in the first order and it was so good that i placed another order immediately! The best was dahi dhamaka..but the chicken starters were equally good..i m assuming that since the starters have been so good the main course will be delicious too!

​Home delivery services are quite trending these days. And why not? Infact who wouldn’t prefer to sit in the comfort of their homes and enjoy the delicious food being delivered at their doorsteps, without the headache of traveling to the restaurant and having it ! But with such a huge advantage there comes numerous disadvantages with these delivery services like long delivery time, the food turning cold on reaching, less variety in the delivery menu, high delivery charges, inefficient packing and so on ! But in recent times, the most popular home delivery service, Singh n Ching, near Kalighat had caught my attention. There aren’t one or two, but there are several reasons why Singh n Ching has proved to be better than most of the home delivery units operating in the city, thereby surpassing all the shortcomings as mentioned earlier. Let’s get into the details on my experience with this place.

I ordered a plate of tandoori chicken(full) from them yesterday since my brother and I had a craving for it in this enjoyably cold weather.The total bill came around INR 320 plus a delivery charge of 25 bucks.I had INR 75 in my zomato wallet and hence for me the final bill was 270.
Delivery took a lot of time but the wait was worth it.It was one of the best tandoori chicken I've ever tasted.Chicken was soft,juicy with perfect amount of char on the outside and the smoky flavour was within too.The spicy rub on the chicken was perfect too.Green chutney without which having tandoor items is incomplete was perfect too.It seemed like they didn't use artificial colouring agent.It tasted of yogurt and herbs. I'll surely order a lot more times from Singh N Ching. Till now my rating is for the tandoori chicken only.

Ordered a veg Indian combo and a veg Chinese combo meal from Singh n Ching today. The packaging was amazing and sturdy. The person who took the order and the delivery person were both extremely polite and courteous.
The Indian combo had pindi chana (never had such amazing preparation anywhere before), dal makhani, mixed veg, 3 chapatis, peas pulao, gulab jamun and salad. The Chinese combo comprised of Hakka noodles, crispy chilli babycorn, kung pao potato, Devils choice and kimchi. The food was beyond delicious, not oily at all and enough for 3 people. 
The quality as well as the quantity of the food is worth mentioning. Also, the place doesn't burn a hole in your pocket and the 2 combos cost me Rs. 270 which is just perfect for those who are looking for a few different options while dining but don't want to spend a fortune.
Looking forward to trying out more amazing dishes from here and keep up the good work all you people at Singh n Ching.

Yesterday night was the first time I ordered from this place, I had very high expectations as I read the reviews before and made up my mind to try this place. But I was utterly disappointed with the quality of food which was delivered to me Via swiggy and thus my poor rating is for that experience I had yesterday night.
I ordered Dal Makhani , butter Naan and a Paneer Manpasand dish, though paneer was good the NAAN was served half cooked and literally I could feel that in every bite and the Dal didn't had Salt to taste, I was expecting a much higher quality Dal after going through reviews. Overall this place disappointed me .

I first of all take this opportunity to thank Rajat Dhingra and Hardeep Singh Dhingra for giving an opportunity to taste some amazing dishes.
They are a home delivery outlet located in kalighat and delivers within 5kms and even take party orders. As the name suggest they specialise in both north Indian and Chinese cuisine.
I had the Pudina paratha and Masala Kulcha . Both were nicely made and was perfect with the achaar so neatly packed in a small container.
Now let's come to the "Murg Lasooni Kabaabs", I have only one word to describe "Amazing"....!!Next the sabz maloni is a perfect blend of diced vegetables in a creamy gravy infused with corn kernels
The deal makkhanwali is a rich buttery daal, a perfect accomplish to tandoori roti..
The "Oh my Ghosth" is the dish with a difference. It's mutton pieces in a rich gravy of minced meat, something that i have never tasted before.
I will recommend this place, if you are planning a nice at home dinner, without the hassle of cooking.

The meal was an absolute delight. True value for money, well packed, quantity enough for one person.
I must add that they are very polite with their customers. I requested them to deliver it by 12:30 pm and they kept their promise. I am looking forward to try their Indian menu as well.

This is a takeaway only joint. A colleague recommended the place, praising their "thalis" There are vegetarian and non-vegetarian options for both Indian and Chinese. I personally ordered the Chinese non-vegetarian thali. The portions are generous with a considerate helping of noodles or rice, as well as two non-vegetarian side dishes and a vegetarian starter. My starter was crispy fried baby-corn, which was crispy, spicy and quite tasty. Of the sides, one is a chicken dish and the other is fish. The sauces are typical dhaba Chinese fare, hardly authentic but heavily spiced, with competing sweet and sour flavours. 2 pieces of meat and fish each, and both were surprisingly succulent. 
The food arrived piping hot in a plastic grooved tray which eliminated the hassle of serving. The packaging was secure and ensured nothing had slopped over - opening it up was not easy though. Keep a knife handy. 
At Rs 160 for the Chinese non-vegetarian platter and about 200 for the Mutton platter, this is certainly not a cheap option, or one that I can indulge in every day. However, it's good enough for a Friday special, or for those days when you feel like indulging, but not too much. For what it is, it's good.

Had an awesome #Friday lunch at office! Yesterday a colleague (and a fellow foodie) told me about this new takeaway-cum-delivery joint called 'Singh N Ching'. On checking Zomato, I found out they have 2 menus - 'Special' (combo meals) and 'Food' (individual dishes). Going by my colleague's recommendation, I ordered a mutton thali. The portion sizes, she had told me, were generous. I also ordered an alu paratha on the side. Two of my colleagues ordered Chinese non-veg thali, with one going for rice as the staple, the other noodles.

When I called to place the order, it was received by someone very polite and courteous. He told me I would need to wait 50 minutes for delivery. This was fine with us.

True to his word, the food was delivered on time by someone equally courteous and polite. It might seem like am harping on politeness but it does feel good to see someone delivering food with a big smile. :) The packaging (am really sorry I don't have a picture of that) will definitely earn brownie points with foodies since it is perfect to a T, keeps the food warm, and doesn't mess up the different gravies.

Now I will come to the food. The alu paratha just melted in my mouth, it was so soft! It's definitely one of the best alu parathas I have tasted in a long, long time! The non-veg thali had a generous amount of pulao, 3 phulkas/butter rotis, dal makhani, mutton kasha, alu ki sabzi, salad and a sweet.

The pulao was light and fluffy. You can eat it even without any accompaniment. The makhani was creamy and had a dollop of cream on top, just the way I like it. The salad was fresh, the alu sabzi was just the sort to go with the rotis. The mutton, I felt, was a bit undercooked, and fell quite short of expectations. However, the rest of the food was so good that I am really willing to give Singh & Ching another try.

My colleagues had ordered Chinese thali, which turned out to be equally delish. The chicken was succulent, the Chinese salad crunchy, and the noodles were soft and not too thin. In fact, the noodles were so good that I regretted not ordering them this time. Well, never mind, now I know what to order the next time! :D

The first order was from their Chinese Cuisine, it was alright but not great according to this avid Chinese lover :) Their service and hygienic way of delivering food is a delight to watch and shows that they do care about their customers and pursue to deliver with style!

Every single item is mouthsmacking apart from the sweet ! Their behavior towards their customers is worth noticing.

Singh N Ching.. the name itself is very interesting. Heard about it from my cousin as it is his friend's enterprise. We have ordered both Indian and Chinese food from here couple of times and it's always delivered piping hot and extremely delicious. Their starter dahi dhamaka is a favourite. Both their Indian and Chinese food is extremely tasty! A must try!

This is new food joint near Kalighat Temple. The place is not visible from outside, most probably,  its a part of the Dhaba located left on entering the Kali Temple road. 
The delivery timing was spot on, and there packing was superb. Thumbs up to the packing... never seen such compact packing. The food was piping hot.
We ordered..

Veg Pulao
Chicken Pulao
Dahi Dhamaka
Dal Makhanwali
Murgh Makhani
Garlic Naan

Garlic Naan, Veg Pulao & Dal Makhanwali was as usual. No spl mention.
 
Chicken Pulao was good. The chicken piece (probably Drumstick, boneless), was stuffed with minced meat.

Dahi Dhamaka, I ordered this reading few good reviews on this preparation. somehow we didn't like it, may be due to high expectation and being meat lovers.

Last one is the Murgh Makhani, which really stand out. As informed by the person taking order, it is made with Chicken Tandoori (Whole), in a rich red gravy. The serving was good and sufficient for 4/5  people. I think they use food color in this preparation, which can/should be avoided. 

I would like to try their Combos, which are served only in Lunch :-(

Ordered Indian and Chinese Thali multiple times, their service is quite satisfactory and good.  It takes nearly an 45 -  60 minutes to deliver and the quality and quantity of food is really recommendable. Chow Mein and Baby corn are the best amongst other items they provide in Chinese Thali. Baby corn is just amazing and one of the best we had till date.  In Indian Thali, Rice is terrific.

This is what will happen when you order a plate of Tangri Kabab - Your face will light up with joy like a pinball machine when you bite into the delectable surprise taking refuge in the folds of tender meaty layers. In all probability, you'll have strong visions of it for a very long time to come! ....Lust at first bite, love at last!

Singh N Ching is a new kid on the block! Located in Kalighat, they provide a lot of food options in Indian and Chinese. One hungry frantic search on zomato, i discovered this place.

The veg Chinese meal was very filling and tasted really good! It included noodles/rice, chilli potato in Manchurian gravy with cashews, veg stir fried which was garlicy and tasty, a kimchi salad and a side of really tasty crispy babycorn.
The portion was very very good and I was overall pretty content with my meal.
The Indian combo is also good, with paneer, veggies, dal,rice, roti and sweet!

The best part is that they deliver it to your doorstep and food is extremely hygenic and packed neatly!

Definitely trying it again!!

Good food, piping hot, delivered to your home..what more can you ask for when you do not want to go out for lunch. The people involved with Singh N Ching are doing a great job. The menu is diverse and though I haven't tried the Indian fare, given the name, I will believe that they will make quite compelling Indian dishes. I ordered for two non-veg Chinese combo meal. The pricing was spot on; 189 with a 400 mL bottle of a soft drink. The ordering went on smoothly; the person assisting me was polite and courteous. I offered to go and collect the food myself, but they offered to deliver it to my place even though my house is almost 2 km away from the kitchen. 
The packaging was impeccable. Rarely have I seen good being packed so nicely. The tray had cut outs for each and every item of the platter and there was no spilling of the gravy from one compartment to another. The combo lunch came in a giant proportion.  Lightly fragrant fried rice with generous amounts of chicken; the chilli paneer starter was absolutely delightful. The paneer pieces were thinly coated and lightly fried and the gravy was spicy; the way most people prefer it. The chilli chicken gravy was delightful; so was the Szechwan fish. The fish was light and flaky. The kimchi salad was good. The accompanying sauces were packed in nice little containers.
I wish the owners good luck for this great endeavour. I will try out the Indian dishes soon and I'm hopefully that they will be equally good. 
Just a tiny bit of advice to the owners, the food was definitely good, but please ask about the spice quotient from the customers. I Cnt have extremely spicy food and though it was delicious, it was a bit too spicy for me.

Ordered dinner from Singh n Ching yesterday and the food arrived hot within 45 minutes. The presentation was excellent. We ordered Purina Paneer Tikka, Alu Nawabi, Dal Makhani and breads. The kebabs were very well prepared and excellently seasoned and delicious. The Dal was also tasty. Waiting to try the Ching cuisine now 😊. Highly recommended!!!!

Had ordered the food from this joint on a Saturday. The food arrived nearly after 1 hour of ordering. But was happy to see the packaging which was very nicely done and surprisingly the food was also warm. We had ordered Pudina Paneer Tikka, Veg Jhaal Frezi, Daal Makhani and an assortment of breads. The food was delicious and we had no complaints. The dal Makhani was particularly superb. The prices are reasonable too. Loved the food and will surely order again and recommend others to do so too .

Very pleasant delivery experience to start with - almost on time without phone calls for directions.  The food that we had was definitely average + with the Jhinga La La (prawn entree) being the best.  The Chicken pulao is innovative.  Portions and prices are reasonable too - it was quite evident that a lot of thought and effort has gone into making the customer experience a joyful one from start to finish.

Feedback : AMAZING! 

Quantity was hugeeee! It's enough for two people. Taste wise each item was delicious. In fact the veg side dish was so tasty that it took me some time to realise that it's veg !! Ha ha. The chicken side dish was great and the dal was typical dhaba style . Love the kind of effort that went into packaging ! Like each Roti was separately folded and wrapped with foil paper! I'm definitely going to be a regular at singh n Ching now !

Excellent no doubt ! I am more of an Indian food person and I must say their Indian food is awesome. The hara kebab is a must try amongst all other starters !
I had recently ordered their Chinese combo meals for an office event for almost 60 people (Veg and Non Veg). As the saying goes - The first impression is the last impression, the packing was brilliant. Every minute detail was taken care off. All I had to do was hand over the food tray.
The quality as well as quantity was top notch. I can't believe that service and food of this good a standard is even available for the price. Keep it up Mr Singh and Ching. Look forward to many more such experiences. All the best !! Sorry this review was long overdue!

To be honest we ordered from this one place for 3 nights continuously. Initially it was an experiment but loved every single item. I am a little biased towards the Indian. Best part is for house parties they are so convenient. They label all the breads in the foil saw this for the first time. The person who takes the order is so patient and helpful.

No doubt the food is good but whats impressing is the fact that you guys have given importance to all the finer details. Looking at the packaging and the way it is delivered one can be sure that its coming from a hygienic kitchen. Coming to the food, when you order Punjabi food and the dal is delicious half the job is done. Your dal is at par with the best in town. Kumbh ka mela was something new and brilliant. The food was also delivered piping hot. Good job.

Going through all the positive reviews on zomato I ordered indian food last night from SNC.First of all the person who took my order was extremely courteous and very helpful guiding me how the food which i ordered would taste. 
My order was a portion of kya cheese hai which was just awesome. For the main course i had ordered panner manpasand which was excellent too. Just a note is that this paneer is not for the spicy food loving people cause this is on the sweeter side but this message was conveyed to me when i was ordering the food. And to go with the panner was a garlic nan which was again excellent. 
Special mention to the packing which keeps the food hot, the quantity, the excellent food quality and also the small accompaniments which came with the food like the green chutney. Salad and small onions.
Very very happy with SNC and will order soon and guys you all are doing a great job. Please keep it up.

Stumbled across this place on Zomato and i must say it impressed me from the word GO...Tried their veg & non veg north Indian fare options and they have thankfully given a new lease of life to the dying north Indian food scenario in Kolkata....I'm yet to try their Chinese options and I hope it is equally competent... They have done their homework when it comes to quality food packaging as its of primary importance when one is functioning as a takeaway cum home delivery outlet,let's not forget dis is wat d client comes across on receiving d food....now coming to the food,I could not fault with anything as they do seem to have put a lot of thought behind it,I can't go into personal favourites coz dat would be unfair to a lot of fare on offer which was not tried by me.I dint need to think twice before rating them with a 5 star rating coz they come across as an extremely promising unit which should serve d foodies cause for a long time...Thumbs Up...Keep it up!!!

Two starters like stuffed mushroom and dahi ke kebab were out of the world. the best part the food was delivered in time and was super hot.....

Looking forward to have the CHING portion soon as SINGH JI ne already AAG laga di hai...ALL the best

Hello,
Looking for a new place to order from suggestion popped up on my screen “SINGH n CHING”, the variety of menu really captured my attention and left me curious.
As my husband and me have different food preferences, it worked well for us. His loyalty for Indian food and mine for Chinese always makes us order food from two different places eventually.
My first glance of the menu got me super excited, huge selection of vegetarian dishes was exhilarating. We ended up ordering for 3-course Vegetarian meal for each.
We started with Lemon coriander and Man chow Soup, both the soups were full of aroma and packed with flavors.
For starrers we had ordered Dahi Dhamaka and Konjee Crispy Shitake Mushroom. Dahi dhamaka name speaks for itself, it was the best dhamaka with smooth texture and smoky after taste from the tandoor. I know what is my new favorite starter for my guests and myself. Excellent quality and quantity of the mushrooms used for the konjee crispy mushroom, very generous.
Then came coming to the last course of course, one portion Dal makhani  it was just how it is supposed to be, Paneer Manpasand the richness of the gravy was very heavenly and last but not the least Veg-Pan fired noodles, the gravy was perfect comfort food for a winter evening.
 
Thank you Singh n Ching for surprising us with such a delightful experience. With time and experience I m sure in future you will be able to overcome minor glitches.

The best Lemon Coriander Soup in town!
Had called for couple of Chinese soups and starters, and I must say, it was as appetizing as it was wholesome. Have also tried the Dahi ke Kebab or Dahi Dhamaka, and indeed that is so true to its name. One of the best Indian starters I have had in a long while.
Looking forward to try a lot more dishes from Singh n Ching, especially the Chinese and Indian mains.
Great job done!

Great packaging, reasonably priced and hot food delivered on time. Had ordered Indian and compared to other home delivery options the quality of food and delivery time were impeccable. Must have's - 'Dahi Dhamaka & Kofta-e-khaas' for the vegetarians. Waiting to try the Chinese soon!!

The food was very well delivered and on time. The Hakka Noodles and Veg-Manchurian is a must order. I was very impressed with their packaging - there were cute miniature bottles for different Chinese sauces.
Well done Singh N Ching!
I'm sure the Indian Cuisine will be as good :)

First time, and I had ordered for Paneer Tikka, Dahi Dhamaka & Crispy Chilli Babycorn, and very honestly it was really difficult to chose which was better among the three.
The food quality is absolutely amazing. Not kidding, quality of starters was way better than any North Indian restaurants in our town. If you are really looking for authentic tandoori flavours, this is it. 
I received my order within 30 minutes, quantity per portion is also quite good.

By looking at their quality standards of these three dishes I can confidently say that their entire spread in the menu would be equally delicious.

Great Job team Singh n Ching.

PS - 'dahi dhamaka' is actually a DHAMAKA.

Ordered chicken tandoori which had a lovely taste. The singh di jodi, which is a wonderful concept of chicken wrapped with Mutton having an awesome taste. Last but not the least is the fish trump card which had a lovely lemon flavour that added an extra taste to it. All in all it has given the taste buds an excellent gateway to fusion food. Eagerly waiting to order some more mouthwatering delicacies.
