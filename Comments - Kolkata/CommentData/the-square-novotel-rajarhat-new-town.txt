We were in this place for Sunday brunch
Sometime back. Selection of food spread mesmerising, but I feel it's bit expensive compared to many other places. Cocktails can be definitely better we found no value for money exactly service was perfect. Even though it was busy the waiter took care of us well.

Went for a corporate team lunch buffet. A big Christmas tree aptly decorated hogged our attention. The dining place is spacious. One complaint is the sofas are pretty uncomfortable in terms of their height. Even for an average height person, it is more comfortable having food with plate in your hand. Now coming to the food; was impressed overall. For starters we had limited options not considering the continental food like cold salads. There were 2 items; paneer and chicken and they were ok. For salad lovers, there were a wide variety of salads including that of buffalo and shrimp. For main course, I found fish pulau to my liking; the fish pieces were pretty big. Then there was mutton rogan josh which was also good, chicken in Chinese style (with beans sauce) and veg most probably in Chinese or South East Asian style. In veg there was Kashmiri pulau, paneer, baingan bharta, aloo and spinach, karela. I tasted only paneer and baingan bharta; did not like very much. Of course they were serving breads also. Finally coming to desserts. I found it to be the most attention grabbing part of the entire meal. Firstly the variety of desserts took me by surprise. There were 10 to 12 varieties - bread and butter pudding, ice cream, profiteroles, Rabri, orange sandesh, coffee custard and so on. My favourites chocolate with plum and strawberries in a glass, rabri. Good news for people who avoid sweets. There were sugar free desserts also. Overall I would say a satisfying lunch and a lot can be credited to those desserts - one would be really spoilt for choices. Oh I almost forgot! There were spaghetti,gratin and other Italian dishes too.

The WORST BUFFET of New Town is herre. All stale non-vej dishes akways.  Even the basic chicken dishes are not up to the mark. Being in Biriyani famous Kolkata, they make the most PATHETIC BIRIYANI. 

Pls dont waste your money here.

The interior resonates a fine dining ambience but that's about it. Neither the menu helps you indulge with fine dining, not the staff. The menu is extremely confined with a very few choice if Continental dishes. The staff is inadiquately equipped with the knowledge of the dishes and hence it would be futile in wanting a recommendation from them. The way they describe food is very very rustic. One surely doesn't expect to dine on 'butter chicken' in Novotel...unless, you would want a dish to be called as it is minus all the unwanted descriptions.

The food sucked. The chicken was fibrous, the salad was not fresh and on top of that, when complained to the staff, even though they did try compensating with complimentary dessert, the dessert sucked too. From an esteemed place such as this, it is highly disappointing to be met with such an experience. The hospitality of the staff was undeniably good, but that is not the only thing for which one would choose dining in an expensive place such as this.  Had high expectations but the entire experience sucked. Wouldn't recommend going there to anyone.

Went for the bday treat of my friend Indranil saha. It was Friday night and the place was fairly crowded. We opted for dinner buffet and thank God we chose buffet because it was just amazing. Compared to all the star hotels in kolkata I would rate Novotel buffet the best among all. A huge spread of dishes starting from salads to main course and dessert. Among all the dishes I mostly liked the chicken sausage salad, chicken in Singapore style, mushroom, chicken liver nd corn lasgna and chicken pizza. Special mention for the huge dessert section which was mouth watering. All these for a price of 1299+ was really worth it. I am a accor plus member so I got a 40% discount on total bill. We were 4 adults and 1 child and 1 infant. They did not charge for the child which was also a nice gesture. Service was top notch as u expect from a star hotel and ambience was nothing to complain about. Will visit again to try their breakfast and their lunch options. Highly recommended.

I went for buffet for my office party. Ambience is excellent,
but food quality and variety is average. The paneer in the starters were as hard as rock, so much so that the fork was not able to penetrate it :D The noodles were sticking to each other. Other than these, the non veg section was relatively better. & The best section was the dessert, with a large variety of mousses, pastries and sweets available. Personally, my favorite was the mixed fruit crumble! :)

I'll be reviewing this place only on the taste & quality of the food which it serves.

The brand NOVOTEL comes with a huge responsibility and a great position in the hospitality industry, but the quality of food which they serve is totally not acceptable.

Starters: Fish Finger & Chicken Reshmi Kebab
Main course: Lacha paratha, Dal makhani, Mutton Biriyani, Chicken chaap, Pulao, Chingri Macher Malai Curry & Macher Paturi
Desert: Gurer sandesh

All the above mentioned platters where home delivered, and I was invited to the house for the meal, therefore I wont be able to give you any figures regarding the depth of the hole it has burned in ones pocket. 

The starters were quite good, but the main course lagged in taste and not at all satisfying. The Chingri Macher Malai Curry & Macher paturi were a disaster. There was no aroma of mustard in the Macher paturi and the fish tasted dull & the shrimps were very small and were very chewy (probably because the shrimps must have been kept in a refrigerator for too long). The other dishes were still eatable.
The quality of the food must be improved to maintain the reputation of such a big hotel. 

As I haven't visited this restaurant, I wont be able to give you any approximation about the budget for a proper meal here. (will add the approximation whenever I visit it).

A lot more is expected from a brand of such an immense stature!

I went to The square on a normal Saturday with friends to have lunch. Decoration wise the place is beautiful. The way of presentation of food item and the decorations of the places where really nice.
Now, to food, so we took buffet. They had Continental, Chinese and north Indian all covered in their buffet. People has huge option what they want to have. Starter options are lesser than main course but whatever they had really tastes good. All kind of fruits where also present.

In desert also we had a good number of options. Six types of ice cream. All together, I loved it.

Location: Rajarhat Novotel, opposite Central Mall.

This is perhaps one of the best luxury dining place I have been to. Classy, soothing decor and a great ambiance!!I was there on Ashtami 2017 and have never seen a buffet with such variety!

It had bengali cuisine, Barbeque, chinese, tandoori, continental, variety of salads and desserts.

The mangsher pulao was the showstopper for me, the chinese mandarin fish too was great, so were the salads, the noodles and the chicken cutlets, fish salads.

Coming to the desserts, all sweets were exquisite, rosogolla being the best!!The choco fudge cake was the wow thing for me!Perhaps the only addition I would like would be a welcome drink!Price seems to be okay given the spread and taste!!

The level to which The Square has let me down is unfathomable. The decor, the ambience, the service; everything is great except for one integral part i.e the food which forms the crux of any restaurant. 
I tried their buffet menu, it was limited & the food was found to be cold. A limited buffet menu can also do wonders if their food tastes nice however this wasnt found here. They have very little non veg options for main course & just two starters. The only saving grace was the dessert (albeit nothing extra ordinary) & the chicken tikka kebab. 
On the next visit to Novotel, I’d recommend anyone to visit the other restaurants & definitely not The Square even if you’re extremely famished.

LOCATION: It is situated in the ground floor of novotel Kolkata hotel & residencies near the main arterial road in Rajarhat.
AMBIENCE: The decors are done up in the shades of red, black & beige. The entire setting oozes a very leisurely laid back vibe.
SERVICE: They need to improve as it was too slow.
MENU: The buffet menu had cold cut salads ; indian dishes, pastas & various desserts.
FOOD: The food was cold & bland according to me. The salads were ho hum apart from the paneer shashilik which was good. Among the mains the adraki gosht & the paneer masala is recommendable. The desert section was impressive with the creamy softness of the blue berry pana cotta & the crunchy yet softness of the doughnut pudding.

Last Sunday I went to The Square-Novotel. I am sorry to say but It didn't stand up to my
expectation. Ambiance was good. They arranged a magic show and a guy had been singing through the whole time but I didn't find the food quite impressive. They surely had wide variety on food items but I found them very average. The only food item that i really liked was the cheese omelette. Hospitality was good though.

Breakfast was amazing and had a good spread. On the 5 days stay the menu was repeated and no changes which became repetitive at the end of the week.
Dinner spread was very average and nothing variety to offer.
The service and attitude of the waiters was exceptional.
The live counter needs a separate mention and the Chef was doing a pretty good job in serving hot dosa, Omellete , Uthapam etc.

Elaborated French food, not to mention amazingly tasty and perfectly matching with my Indian appetite and my evening was set a few days back at Square. Novotel, Kolkata has recently been celebrated the French Food Festival to celebrate the French National Day in Kolkata and they are having the spread available for a week at Square starting from 14 July, 17. I was invited there at Novotel, Kolkata on 15th July for the wine and dine. Novotel, being part of the extended Accor Hotels, which is a French Multinational hotel chain, celebrates the French Festivals with zeal. The Executive Sous Chef, Neelabh Sahay, shared several details during the meal I was enjoying with my blogger friends.

If there is something extraordinary @The Square in Novotel Hotel & Residences,Kolkata it is the guest managers who serves the guests above average in the industry and if something is pulling The Square down is the carelessness with which management has thrown away Senior Sous Chefs and a band of lesser trained Chefs producing average food.

We came in little late and ended almost at noon on Sunday, one of the most relaxing ambience...
Service is very prompt and to top it, staff n servers are courteous... I experienced that they went out of their way to provide delightful experience to their guests...
Would definitely rate a thumbs up compared to the other newer 5 star hotels in Kolkata...
And it doesn't pinch the pocket.
The only inconvenience is the reach out to Novotel as the road is under construction, currently.

Novotel’s offer for Mother’s day was as tempting as their brunch spread – “Mom’s eat free!”. As expected, brunch on a Sunday for a bunch of lazy Bongs eventually turned out to be a lunch, as we walked into the “The Square” at Novotel which was almost packed at 1’o clock.

I visited The Square with my family yesterday on bengali new year. I had a reservation and when we went there they asked first whether we are going to pay by cash or card and the payment was to be made beforehand. So before we sat on our table we made the full payment for our lunch. The buffet spread was average and the quality of food substandard. The two Fish that I had was not fresh at all and somewhat unpalatable. The service was extremely poor. We were to be served aam porar shorbot as welcome drink but we had to ask for it twice, before it finally arrived when we were starting the main course. The dessert was a little better. But the final shock was that around 3.10 pm a lady host came and said that the buffet will close within 10 minutes to hurry up even though it is a 24 hrs restaurant according to zomato. We were there for around 50 minutes. This is the worst experience i have had anywhere. And I don't think they are anywhere near a star category because the other    5 stars that I have been to their food and services are exemplary.

On 15th April, 2017 i.e. the Bengali New Years Day being enticed by ads of Novotel, I booked for Bengali New Years Buffet lunch for myself & my wife. 
After having lunch, we felt a huge let down in terms of quality. The spreads though had great names were anything but authentic Bengali cuisine. The tastes definitely were mostly not even close enough to what you expect of a Bengali cuisine. The fishes served were frozen ones & very deep fried though while booking we were assured of fresh fishes being served. The fishes served, Tangra & Pabda were sea products & not sweet water, which is the basic of Bengali recipe. The shrimps served as part of Malaikari were too frozen ones & not properly cooked. Malaikari is made out of prawns & not shrimps as prepared by Novotel.The tastes were definitely not what it was spelt out to be. Surely & certainly we expected a much better fare from Novotel. 
There were other small issues like spoons were not available at the desert counter, which itself was placed 10 to 12 mtrs away from the main counters. 
In short Novotel really needs a huge upgradation in terms of Chef standard, at least for Bengali cuisine as well as layouts.

Went for the bengali food festival and I must say, although the buffet price was 1700 all Inc. , the spread was huge. You possibly have everything there with the exception of Hilsa fish.
But none were that good. Every item was average to below par. The topse fry was hardly fried . The malaikari was bland so was the rezala. Only the chicken was full of flavour and taste. The rating would have been much lower if it weren't for the awesome desert section that it has. Great selection of bengali and western deserts. 
Average affair in all.

Took their suite for a day, after a over nights flight from pune, I woke up late and ordered lunch.  They brought in Bengali fish curry and rice, after eating a couple of spoons, I see this long hair on my plate!!  Turns out they had complaints of stones being found in food as well (as per their fnb manager)
Although they replaced the lunch (same dish) I had lost the appetite for food. All I wanted to do was to brush my teeth and leave the hotel. Checking out right now,  as I type this.

This was our first booking at The Square, Novotel, through Dineout App, though the initial booking conformation was delayed, even had to make several phone calls to the customer care, the dining experience at The Square, Novotel was amazing, hotel staffs were nice, friendly and well mannered, specially Saheb Das Thakur who took care of all our orders. Parsi food festival was one of a kind experience, items were distinct, tasted yum and had unique and authentic Parsi touch and flavours in them. Just enjoyed the food. Overall great dining experience. Looking forward for the next visit soon.

A good ambience, you feel good sitting there. The staff are courteous and helpful, they also let you be and do not hurry you up. We didn't have much there, just soup and salad. Both of which were just about ok. Nothing wrong but nothing to remember either. But the pocket punch was a lot!!! ( Something to remember!!) But I guess it's to be expected in this kind of place.. Moreover if you are going there you are prepared to shell out more! ( So shouldn't crib!!)

Ambiance is very good in valentine's day.Food quality is outstanding. I had a wonderful dine out here. Music by Nikhil is out of the world and I love that.

But few concerns I would like to share.
 I got my vehicle key misplaced in valet parking which is not at all acceptable in such a prestigious hotel.
 I felt ,lack in table service which  is an obvious expectation from any star rated hotel.

Few days back my whole team visited to Novotel. It was a farewell celebration for one of a summer intern who came to work in our lab. We have purchased coupon from near buy. Then we opted lunch buffet for a week day plan. The buffet was spreaded with many items ..specially in desert. Initially we took the starters. Paneer, fish and chicken tikka was available on that day. Paneer tastes better than other two here. I have ordered one chicken thin crust pizza. The pizza was crispy and good as per my requirements. Then we went for main course with chicken and fish and mutton. The mutton was horrible. Here also fish tastes better than others.  Above all I like their Salam with noodles and biryani. When I went to the desert section the options are good with Indian and English. But all total the food was not up to the mark with quality. I have had better buffet than this one.

The lunch buffet doesn't seem to be at par with other five stars like taj and Oberoi or even jw Marriott. Dessert section was just horrible. Normally five stars have the best dessert spreads but Novotel kolkata's desert section was very very sad. Been to Novotel
London and Thailand but they have far better  standard. Even the waiters were very unprofessional. Normally on my bday I always visit taj Bengal but this time I tried Novotel and it was a big disaster . Never going back to Novotel Kolkata.

Well I gave a suprise lunch to my girlfriend on 14th Feb... and trust me people we just loved it. The ambience .. the food ... were just awesome. We had tandoori chicken / chicken biriyani and Nalli Korma ... well all of them were too good. Perviously I had biriyani in one of the 5 star hotels @ Kolkata but the one I had yesterday @ Sqaure was much much better and tasty and looking forward to have it again.
The behavior of the staffs were too good. The waitress who served was also very helpful.  The dining area was beautifully decorated for valentine day purpose and the ambience was awesome. Have already planned to visit it again next month... looking forward to it.

Thumpsup for the buffet menu, I must say this was the best buffet restaurant I had tried till date, innumerable no. Of tasty salads (prawn cheese salad was my favorite), so tasty starter (sp. Veg one... I forgot the name), again innumerable no. Of veg and non veg items. I liked all the dishes but disappointed with prawn malai and another dish with coconut( their dishes with coconut should be avoided I guess 😉). The desserts were amazing. Ambience thumpsup. Service thumpsup

A wide range of different cuisines, starting from mouth watering appetizers to flavourous Bengali foods to prodigious range of deserts, was available at this place. Overall I liked this place very much and looking forward for another visit soon.

Took advantage of the food festival offer on dine out and headed to their coffee shop for lunch today. Opted for their buffet as was famished. The service was impeccable. My kudos to the service staff, personally Tuhin for helping out with the reservation. The spread was good in terms of the the quantity. The few dishes that stood out was the Thai fish curry,    Tenderloin, Lebanese section, Veg Soup and the ice cream station with nice yummy caramel sauce. The keema biryani was a disappointment, more like pulao with keema mixed with it. The south Indian prawn Main course was ok but it had shrimps and not prawns. Apart from this the taste was ok not exceptional in the spread.

For an impromptu plan we had a real good deal given that it was a weekend and the Republic Day schemes made it that much more awesome. 

The spread is like any hotel. Decent. What is nice is the staff and the courteous, friendly attitude. Which was not bad at all and that is where this place scores.
The best were the freshly squeezed juice spread - not canned. Fresh. Which was really cool.

A great ambience to start with. Went on a special day for a family lunch. Sitting arrangements are okayish but the staff is really courteous. Hospitality at its best. The theme of the day was british indian cuisine due to republic day. Starters were two vegetarian and two non vegetarian dish. The vegetable cutlet didn't taste good though. Liked the chicken cutlet. Coming to the main course- i would specially mention four dishes- coconut rice with bengali prawn curry, colonial chicken, beef roast. Somewhere i liked the vegetarian thai yellow currry too. On desserts the gajar halwa tart was fab. Kalajamun could have been cooked better. Plum cake too turned out to be awesome. Butter bread pudding as well as the tricolored Panna cotta rurned out to be awesome. But i don't know why they are charging service charges on the bill inspite of govt regulations. Otherwise a fine dine.

Stopped over at the square for a club sandwich. It took 20mins.

What came was a very tasty sandwich along with French fries. Only it was a plate of food I could get at a normal cafe. The sandwich was made of normal daily bread not the sandwich bread hence the portion was really small.

Started the New Year by having a brunch at The Square. The buffet spread was big, but nothing to grab eye balls. I started with normal cold cuts with bread, followed by Salads. The main course offerings were limited though. I loved the continental spreads better like roasted lamb in teriyaki sauce, fish roulade, grilled cottage cheese, babaganoush, etc. 
The dessert counter was pretty decent enough. I opted for Malpua with Rabdi, hazelnut cake, fresh fruits.... Can come back many times..

Coming to the food - the spread was mind-boggling - and each and every item was delicious. I tasted quite a number of new things - and loved all of them.

I will definitely look to return here - and once again thank you guys for the wonderful evening

Yesterday visited The Square  Novotel, one of the best 24hr restaurant in Kolkata. Ambience and location are good. It was Chrismas Dinner, bit costly,  but worth as it included drinks and a range of starters. Being vegetarian, I found limited options for me, but non vegetarians were spoiled for choice (Fish, beef, mutton and all preparations on earth).  However,  I was rescued by Mr. Parichay and Mr. Saheb who attended me and provided all sorts of veg preparations including Dumplings, panner kadhai and pulav to mention. Finally, I wolf down all sorts of cakes, rasmalai and sandesh.  I am extremely happy with the service provided.
 I must say its even at 12 midnight everyone  was on their toes (had bad experience at many 5stars at night). I would advice to reserve table before to avoid disappointment.
I would strongly recommend the Square.

Went in for the special Christmas dinner buffet. Extensive salad bar and dessert spread. There weren't too many options for the mains and the food pretty average.  Being a chocoholic, the dessert menu did disappoint. There were barely any chocolate items and not even chocolate ice cream! The biggest let down was the crepe. Crepes warmed in an orange juice reduction served with chocolate sauce isn't something I'd ever have again! I hope they taste stuff before it comes out of the kitchen. A big thumbs up to the prompt service. Our servers Malay and Sriparna were exceptionally courteous.

Celebrated mom's 50th birthday at The Square Novotel. The staff helped provide a customized decor to make the occasion special. Walking into the restaurant was like stepping into grandeur. Massively built sitting area makes you feel dwarf. We had opted for the buffet so it meant truckloads of incoming food. The starters were a heavy affair. Starting with cream of chicken soup, we had chicken tikka, skewer fish, masala paneer and of course beers. Sadly the only available beer that time was Kingfisher and nothing else. Shocker for a 5 star. The starters were amazing, absolutely loved the chicken and paneer, but the star dish was the fish. Tender and juicy and done in amritsari style, brilliant it was. Since we were a family of 6, there was a lot of variety in our mains. Surveying the buffet i was amazed at the variety of national and international food with some real exotic ingredients. I started with the cold salad section and tried the marinated squids with bean and cherry tomato. For mains my plate had egg rice with andhra fish curry, chicken and thyme jus, and Florentine fish. Every item on the plate was good, though lacked seasoning and could do with more salt. Desserts again was an affair to remember and we tried almost everything from their scores of variety. From ice cream to cheese cake, gajar ka halwa, pudding and what not. Thats the only time we lose control seeing all the sweet delicacies. Overall had an amazing evening and an experience to remember.

This review is based on the buffet breakfast at The square , the lobby level cafe cum restaurant adjacent to the pool at Novotel Kolkata. Talking about the ambience , the place is a huge one with high ceilings and well spaced tables and couches making the seating very comfortable.  The breakfast spread was huge , i so loved the gobi ka paratha with dum aloo , upma , potato wedges , grilled vegetables, aloo bonda and the english options had french toast , scrambled eggs , baked beans , grilled sausages , poached fish , porridge , cold cuts salami , fish roulade , smoked salmon and eggs made to order , number of options in bakery from croissants to danishes to donuts , yogurt , museli , and huge options for shakes and juices. i personally did not like any of the fish stuffs cause all of them were smelling raw. Apart from that , the rest were wonderful specially the indian sections. the staff and service was excellent as expected from five star properties. Adding some pastries could have made it even better!

So I was here last night with my siblings for the dinner buffet-I entered the coffee shop at around 8.30 when it was nearly empty with only about 3-4 covers occupied....very nicely done up interiors.I approached one of the servers and and asked for a table for 4 adults and 2 kids-I asked for a table closer to the buffet considering the fact that Im 9 months pregnant-but I wasn't given any table nearby ,instead was given a table almost at the entrance....stating that the rest were all reserved ,which I'm certain was not the case.Secondly ,the service quality ,specially the alertness and the attentiveness of the service staff is atrocious-pardon me but they have the attention span of a gnat.In an empty restaurant(I ,myself being an f&b person and in the service industry for almost 10 years) ,I had to call for and repeat the same instructions to 3-4 different servers.There were live pasta & pizza stations , which I was told would be served on the table,it took over half an hour to arrive after 2-3 reminders to different servers.And honestly we all had lost our appetite by then....and I was already regretting my decision to dine here whereas my siblings wanted to go to Hyatt.A simple paper towel took them over 15 minutes to give.Thirdly coming to the quality of food-the rating that I have given is for the starters ,pizza and the desserts and the spread that was laid out.The main courses were very mediocre in taste ,the major let down was the pasta(I had ordered for penne alfredo) ,I just dont have words to express my disappointment over the inability to prepare alfredo.              While leaving after dinner I did speak to Pritam ,the manager ,about the service standard .....which really really needs to be revamped ,it is in a real sorry state.       P.S. Pritam ,thanks for atleast hearing out my feedback ,really appreciate it

The Square, the coffee shop of Novotel at Rajarhat is a bright and cheerful place, gleaming with natural light with glass, steel, granite dominating the accent and making it a very modern looking place. The restaurant is almost seamlessly connected with the hotel's vast lobby giving it a very expansive, atrium like feel. It's also a huge place and there are enough good corners to sit and enjoy the good views all around.

We tried the buffet breakfast here and have no complaints about the range of items available. The usual fare of Breads and other bakery items, south indian, north indian, eggs cooked to order, a bit of oriental, some healthy options like sprouts and vegetable juices etc. etc. are all there. We tried some of the items like a plain dosa and the museli and they tasted okay. There was a small section with special bengali items and we hope that during the festive season, they will serve more of local delicacies.
 

Verdict- While we liked what we had, it wasn't enough to get really impressed. They need to introduce some differentiated items and build up an equity for certain types of cuisine. The service is functional but doesn't match the warmth and efficiency of some of the older star hotels of Kolkata. The huge size of the place also makes it very impersonal. However, there is immense scope for this restaurant to do quite well in Kolkata in the times to come.

Located inside novotel which stands tall in New town,Rajarhat.We went for the dinner buffet.The buffet spread is huge.

They had 2 hot appetisers and 5 cold ones in the non veg section including fish,chicken,beef,lamb and shrimp.There were a lot of veg options too.There  were a lot of options in the lebanese section including baba ganoush,hummus and a variety of pita breads.

There was a live pasta section which we couldnt try because we were too full.Half a pizza was served which was delicious.But when we asked them to serve another one,a somewhat weird and less tasty pizza was served.

In the mains in the veg section, they had steamed rice,paneer,dal,makai palak etc and an amazing cheese crepe that tasted out of the world.The non veg section had hakka noodles,some chinese prawn dish(outstanding),malabari jheenga rice,beef stew,some green chicken and shahi gosht.

For dessert,they had lots of varieties of pastries,dark chocolate pudding,3 varieties of ice creams with a number of condiments,a few bengali mishtis and fruits.

The appetisers stood out.The mains were okayish other than the prawns which were sensational.The service is  a bit on the downside.It will the take waiters ages to get to your table after you have asked them to come.Other than that,the experience was good.

P.S.I was clicking pictures for zomato since I had seen a lot of reviews of this place with photos.But after a while,I was asked not to click any more photos,the reason being unknown.

A splendid Sunday morning weather ending in an ordinary brunch at Novotel. As we enteted the Square, we waited to be seated and as our wait extended to irritation, we decided to seat ourselves. The extravagance of the brunch is limited to the vast spread, completely missing out on the point of taste. None of the dishes were worth a second try. The kebabs as starters were not marinated, fish used was Basa camouflaged as Bhetki. The Malaysian laksa was decent and the salmon cold cut was fresh. The spice levels in all preparations were highly quantified, including the dumplings. Desserts were varied but nothing delectable.
Staff attitude is nice but professionalism is ordinary.
All in all, just not worth the cheque.

Decided to go for a lunch at this place..though it was my 3rd visit.. We walked in n found the AC is not working... Though ambience is simply the best among all the 5 stars of Kolkata, service -fine,but food not quite upto the mark..we ordered the same buffet menu as earlier but there was a hell and heaven difference from then and now.We started off with cold salads n soup which was very ordinary... 2 veg n 2 non veg starters were available with some mint chutney which all were forgettable... Mint chutney was neither tasty nor properly prepared.... Pastas and pizza was available on live counters -thin crust pizza was pathetic... Pizza base seemed like a roti-as it was under baked ... Could not find much toppings other than tomato purie....

Moving to main course, less variety was on offer! I was grossly dissappointed with tasteless foods... Shaag gosht preparation was awfully disgusting.. the only eatables I found is the chicken biriyani with some good fish preparation... Total of 7 veg and 7 non veg appeared which killed my expectations.... A fruit salad and chaat counter was also set up which neither of us visited..

Moving on to desserts gulab jamun n pastries was fresh -but low on taste... Mostly all appeared to be mediocre.

I somehow feel chefs were more concerned about the calorie count of the food instead of the food quality ...

Service as usual is nice but somewhat slow...
Price - again a pinch of 945 seems quite a hefty affair. Nevertheless, my experience was below expectations.

Went multiple times on a corporate buffet. They have a awesome range of sea food and starters. The main course are mouth watering. It has also got a wide range of dessert. Just thumps up!!

Ever been on a highway roadtrip on NH2? The same famed road that connects Kolkata with Delhi! Driving on that dark deserted highway, felt hunger overtaking your senses? Then maybe ahead in the distance, you saw a shimmering light? Is it a miracle or a mirage?
Thankfully that light belonged to some dimly-lit inn no one ever heard about! However the extremely delicious food tasted heavenly & brought tears in your eyes?*fast forward now*

Sitting in your office cubicle, (frustrated with the excel sheets & never ending presentations) wondering how to re-live that exact moment?
Well I got to relive the same moments thanks to ‘NH2 on Plate’ , a 3 day celebration of foods curated from the choicest delicacies of the cities that lie on, you guessed it right the erstwhile National Highway 2.

Gastronomical Rendezvous at The Square, Novotel to celebrate NH2 Festival..!

If traveling was free, I would have surely been a Nomad. If eating out was healthy, I would have never turned my way towards the Gyms. But then, life is not a bunch of roses. It has its own complexities, something which we cannot just neglect. What it does give us, is the endless joy while cruising through the sea, or chugging across the railway lines, or speeding across the highway. And with this unimaginable happiness, comes the pleasure to eat and tickle our hungry bones! Traveling and Eating are something which goes hand-in-hand, and one simply cannot leave one out, while opting for the other. Novotel, a premier brand of hotels, tried to recreate a similar replica or travel and happiness combined together, and usher in the nostalgic moments, by organizing a NH2 (National Highway-2) Food Festival, at its Rajarhat Branch in Kolkata.

Standing at a larger than life property, with its grandiose structure and posh ambiance, it mostly gives a look of catering to the business and corporate class, but at the same time, gives the commoners, a chance to experience the suave and ecstasy of enjoying a classy day out, or a relaxing weekend, at a very nominal compensation. The main gate leads to the big hotel, which in turn commences with the reception desk. It is only when, you enter the main hotel, you realize, how gigantic and humongous, the place actually is. Skipping the descriptions, Novotel had invited a couple of bloggers, to be a part of this historic saga, and enjoy the pleasantries of the differed and vast cuisine across the multiple states, through which National Highway-2, carves its way. 

The spread was huge, and there is absolutely no adjective I can use to describe the entire setup. As such a major lifeline of this country, a trip across this busy highway is never complete without munching on the roadside restaurants and dhabas to gorge into the quintessential dishes and the regional specialities available across that state. Covering 6 major states, viz. Delhi, Harayana, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, one could find the very traditional and popular Litti-Chokha to the very likes of Bajre ki Khichdi, Rajma Chawal, Kadhi Pakodi, Kachhri Ki Subzi & Butter Chicken. If your heart tickles for some homely Bengali food, for dishes like Aloo Posto , Kosha Mangsho, Bekti Paturi and Rosogolla were ready to savor your tastebuds.,

I was completely astonished and taken aback, upon stumbling against a snack counter preparing the very liked 'Maggi' complimented by a soul-seeking spread of mouthwatering deserts. Speak about salads, lassi, beer and the main course, it was a lavish affair altogether and promised me to take to a wonderland! The basic affair for us, began with some chilled Lassi, Nimu Paani, and Chaa(n)s. For the alcoholic buffs, beers and breezers were available to quench your thirst. Moving on to the food portion, it started with Kolkata Style Mutton Biryani. The sides accompanying the rice preparation were Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Durbari Jhinga, Anda Dal Tadka, Fish Tikka Masala, Keema Qurda Kaleji, Aloo Bhujia, Bhindi Masala, Gobi Adraki, Paneer Aur Kala Chanaa Bhurji, and Lasooni Palak. Those wanting to try a Vegetarian Option for Rice, there was a Vegetarian Pulao named Subz Tehri.

The deserts included the likes of Fresh Fruits, Cachumber Salads, Dahi Khira, Moong Dal Kosambari, Rasogolla, Laddoo, 2 in 1 Sandesh, Bread Butter Pudding, Plum Frangipane Flan, Cream Cheese Almond Crumble, Black Forest Gateaux, Citrus Chocolate Crema, Orange Mousse (Sugar Free), some other kinds and types of salads, and last but not the least, 3 varieties of Ice Creams. Words does not do justice to describe this one mammoth of a spread, and the huge initiative, taken by this hotel to collaborate and bring together the popular delicacies spread across all the abovementioned states. The culinary affair was indeed something which has not been seen before, and thus made its mark into all of our minds. The tiny huts across the roads, the white stripes against the black-pitch highway, this was a trip of lifetime for the foodlovers, only to crave to repeat the journey very soon in the near future.

Food Tasting at ‘NH2 on Plate’ Food festival, at The Square, Novotel

The Square at Novotel always surprises me with its amazing out of the box food ideas, dishes and delicacies, this time it is all set to tickle the (somewhat not-so-celebrated) “desi taste buds” of all its patrons. The ‘NH2 on Plate’ Food Festival at The Square has brought back all the Highway dhaba style delicacies available across a huge stretch of National Highway 2 (NH2) starting from Delhi to Faridabad to Kanpur to Aurangabad to Jharkhand to Kolkata! So, it promises to present a huge spectrum of cuisines of all these places and the ultimate tadka of roadside dhabas and the local sweet shops! I attend loads of Food Festivals to be honest, but I have rarely come across such an innovatively planned food-themed journey, which they call ‘NH2 on Plate’! I must admit I was more than happy to cover this ultimate gastronomical extravaganza which can’t really be missed! Like we know, Novotel with its headquarters in France (and with more than 400 hotels and resorts worldwide) has started its operations in Kolkata couple of years back and has already made its mark in the city of joy! With its grandiose interiors and larger than life structure it surely presents a best-in-class ambiance where you can relax, converse, loosen up and stay… to create memories! The suave interiors and spaced out super-comfortable seating arrangements will surely mesmerize your senses and let you enjoy your food with your loved ones. So here we again come back to the food, the NH2 food festival which we were discussing about! The thing which impressed me was the innovative presentation of the handis and dhaba style containers placed at the Dinner Buffet counter, the large food containers were placed on the either side of the temporarily constructed huge model of a highway with toy car models on it. The pitch black smooth highway looks amazing and quite fitting for this occasion. It has also got typical yellow and white milestones made out of thermocol bearing names of various cities and towns which are there along this stretch of NH2. Though I would have loved if this concept was further improved a bit, thus placing the related dishes of a particular region beside the milestone of that place. But anyway the sight was splendid, and that raw appeal of those lips smacking dishes in the handis was irresistible enough to get started!

Decided to go for a lunch at this place..though it was my 3rd visit.. We walked in n found the AC is not working... Though ambience is simply the best among all the 5 stars of Kolkata, service -fine,but food not quite upto the mark..we ordered the same buffet menu as earlier but there was a hell and heaven difference from then and now.We started off with cold salads n soup which was very ordinary... 2 veg n 2 non veg starters were available with some mint chutney which all were forgettable... Mint chutney was neither tasty nor properly prepared.... Pastas and pizza was available on live counters -thin crust pizza was pathetic... Pizza base seemed like a roti-as it was under baked ... Could not find much toppings other than tomato purie....

Moving to main course, less variety was on offer! I was grossly dissappointed with tasteless foods... Shaag gosht preparation was awfully disgusting.. the only eatables I found is the chicken biriyani with some good fish preparation... Total of 7 veg and 7 non veg appeared which killed my expectations.... A fruit salad and chaat counter was also set up which neither of us visited..

Tried out the lunch buffet on " Poila Boisak' day. The entree's ware indeed elaborate, as suggested by the manager while booking over the phone. The dining area was very big, with tables spread out.  The linen and silvers were spotless and the warmth extended by the floor staff was nice, with some personal attention.

Coming to the FOOD: there was numerous items in main course and in desserts and well displayed over a large area. HOWEVER there was NO SUPERSTARS. My favorite prawn/lobster was there in a very minimalistic way ie: salad and prawn biriany which did not satisfy me. 

Desserts presentation was superb however the taste was nothing to leave a mark .

I went to this place to celebrate my last day as a 22 years old girl! This place looks huge and spacious. You can go with your gang of friends and occupy  a large table.Or, you can go with your date and occupy a quiet corner with lovely window by the side.
As we had a plan of watching movie afterwards, we opted for the buffet menu. And, trust me the spread is HUGE!!!!!You can never have it all at once!  There are Indian, Oriental and Continental dishes to choose from.
Both starters and main course have a huge variety to choose from. But I loved the dessert section the most (the bread pudding was not up to the mark, rest all was fine).
But, I did not like one thing about the buffet at all. Most of the starters and a few main dish were cold, I mean too cold. We do not expect this kind of thing from a place like this.
We had ordered two cocktails which took quiet some time to get served. Probably because the buffet was on, but again such things should not happen as people can also opt for a la carte  at the same time.
The waiters were polite and helpful. But I think they need to manage the buffet well. The way the starters and main dishes are arranged, it becomes a little haphazard.
Overall, I loved the place. But could not be completely satisfied. Their emnu is unique undoubtedly, but I expected better service after spending such a huge amount.
I will definitely try the a la carte menu in this place and know the place better. :)

We went here for our anniversary dinner and had a truly delightful experience. The manager Tanveer and his entire team overwhelmed us with their hospitality. We were really touched by their warmth and courtesy.

We went for the buffet and found most items to be delicious. In particular, we enjoyed the small hors d'oeuvre plates which were varied and flavorful. There was also a good selection of dips and breads, including an excellent onion focaccia. The staff took such good care of us that we were almost full by the time it was time for the items on the main course :-) Amongst these the biriyani was light and flavorful, the Malabar prawn was taste-bud tingling, but would have liked the pork with apple bits to be a little less sweet. The dessert selection was also wonderful - with everything from local Bengali sweets, chocolate mousse/cakes and a subtlely flavored mango-mint gel custard. 

Overall we really enjoyed the dinner and would like to thank The Square for making our day a special one!

Went and had a breakfast buffet here. The food is great and there is plenty to try. Everything that is made tastes good and that is a mixture between Continental and Indian food. The seasoning and spices hit the spot on all the dishes. The waffles here were something that was fun. There are a lot of stuff to drink, like milkshakes and fresh juices. Definitely a must visit.

The place is also wheelchair accessible.

If you have been to The Square at Novotel Kolkata Hotel & Residences, you will know that they have one of the best buffets in town with a  huge vegetarian and non-vegetarian spread. Well, their a la carte menu has also been very impressive but now, with the addition of new dishes, they have taken it a notch higher. I was invited by the management for a tasting of the new menu and I was very impressed!

Nice place- coming to the food . We ordered for tandoori roti and naan.  The Black Dal was awesome- not too oily but with the perfect pinch of spices . 
The alu jeera - simple yet tasteful . The prawn tikka was spicy but soft and tasty . I did not like the Murgh tikka too much but overall good food . The most interesting dish was the shorba.

Our team decided to go for a buffet lunch at this place – also, to benefit with the corporate discount of 20% (lol). We walked in @ 12:30 pm and found that the place was almost empty – but customers started flowing in slowly and gradually. Ambience – simply the best amongst all the 5-stars of Kolkata, service – fine but food, not quite upto the mark. We started off with broccoli soup – which was pretty ordinary on taste – and disappointingly, not warm also. These were served to us on table along with soup breads, butter, roasted papads, aloo papads and soup sticks. 2 veg and 2 non veg starters were available, which were served with mint chutney. Paneer tikka and some aloo cutlet (sort of) starters were served – both quite forgettable! Mint chutney, also, was neither tasty, nor properly prepared – I could feel uncrushed pieces of uncrushed coriander/ mint in my mouth. I also ordered their fresh lime soda – which was fine – but ice content making up most of the drink – which gave me a feeling that I was robbed when I bought this drink for 300 bucks! My friend went for a mango drink, which was good, but definitely not great. 

Pastas and pizzas were available on order – mixed sauce pasta was pathetic and I did not have more than a spoonful of it. Pizza toppings were fine – onion, cheese, olives etc, but the pizza base seemed more of a roti – as it was grossly under baked. 

Moving to main course, a decent variety spread was on offer – the non veg ones outnumbering the veg ones. Narkel Chana dal with steam rice was there which was just ok. Cauliflower tarkari was quite a mess. However, matar paneer in yellow gravy was the pick of their mains – and I finished my whole meal based on that only. Tandoori roti, masala kulcha, garlic naan, regular naans etc were on offer – pick of these being the garlic naan – superbly crunchy – perhaps, the best I ever had. Naan with matar paneer, combined with fresh curd, papads and lachcha onion seemed quite a nice combination. A fruit salad counter was also set up – which neither of us visited – it offered some watermelons, papaya etc. I was grossly disappointed to see that the vegetarians only had the option of steamed rice – the other option for rice being non veg biryani. Chaas was on offer, which was tasty. 

Moving on to desserts, chocolate pastry was fresh – but low on taste. Again, their chocolate mousse was just another mediocre. What made my day was the self-made sundaes using the chocolate, strawberry and vanilla scoops topped with dry fruits, chocolate fudge, raspberry sauce, some dry fruits and choco chips. Their desserts were pretty much in demand and were getting depleted at the same rate as they were being replenished. 

I somehow get a feeling that more stress is being placed on non veg items at this place as compared to the veg ones. Also, I strongly believe that chefs are more concerned about the calorie count of the food instead of the taste (which is somewhat justified)!

Service, as usual, is nice – but was somewhat slow that day (which is ok for me). Prices – again, a pinch of Rs. 1400 + Taxes seems quite a hefty affair. Nevertheless, my experience was way below expectations – especially after having visited their recently launched, The Studio – Pan Asian Gallery.

Went there for a team dinner. Food quality , specially biriyani is mind blowing. We opted for buffet. And also desert section is so eye treaty and tempting and definitely tastes awesome. They have a prawn starter ( forgot the name) which is a must must try. But main course had a weird variety. Overall it was a nice experience.

One of the better restaurants with a good choice of menu.We had buffet here and the selection was good.The service was great and it almost felt like we have ordered Ala-Carte as we got whatever we wanted delivered at our table.

The food is good nothing special to brag about.

The decor is not that great if you want to have a romantic dinner and since its a business hotel you will have many office parties/get together.

This is located near my office so went for lunch with a friend of mine. This is the first time that I visited Novotel just for lunch as earlier i have had their food when I stayed at their hotel both in India and abroad. As obvious expectation was a bit high.

They have done OK.
Though nothing extravagant but the place has a simple yet quite elegant with long designer curtains and plush chairs and nicely decorated tables.

As it was Nobo Borsho week, so the restaurant was decked up with same theme.

Now coming to the food, we didnt opt for Buffet but stick to my usual Ala Carte,

Kasundi Murgh Tikka - The dish was nicely cooked and tasted good.
Thai Green Curry & Steamed Rice - They serve Steamed Plain Rice along with Thai Green Curry - you have two options - Chicken & Sea Food. I opted for Sea Food - They give bhetki, oysters, prawn. This is spicy and tastes too good.

Will try their buffet menu on my next visit.
            

2nd Visit - A La Carte

Duck Confit - a preparation of the whole duck. Good one.
Nasi Goreng - Indonesian Dish. Rice topped with Sunny Side up Egg and a sauce which is too good.

Tried the lunch buffet and it was a mix of amazing spread but taste wise it was disappointing. The spread brings a smile on your face but it slowly starts to fade away. Service is not something that can be judged in detail when you go for the buffet. However it was not bad and the ambience is fine. Would conclude by saying that there are multiple options in the locality and this can be missed.

Excellent buffets! .. Enjoyed all my lunches and dinner and loved the varieties every time. Very versatile and there was nothing I could point a finger at. Normally buffets at such hotels feel very processed, but this restaurant is worth going to specifically for the buffets.

Went for buffet .The continental & mediterranean dishes were good but the indian dishes were bland
Probably toned down to cater to the westerners taste buds.

But boy oh boy the desert section was a total joy both in terms of presentation , variety and taste .

We had a discount coupon without that 1500/- for the buffer doesn't have much sense.

The Square is located in the posh Novotel hotel at Rajarhat, Kolkata. Restaurants at 5 star hotels generally turn out to be full of glitz and glamour but their food often lack a soul; such is not the case with the Square

The service is outstanding, highly personalised and prompt. Mr. Saheb, one of the staff members is highly polite and always ready with a list of off menu recommendations on every visit 

I would especially recommend the continental dishes on the menu, The Coq Au Vin caught me by surprise; the chicken was cooked to perfection. The Chicken/Mushroom Caesar salad is also delectable. Grilled Prawns in Butter Garlic sauce was lip-smacking

The basic Indian fare isn't that great, avoid the Aloo Parathas and the Dosas; I won't judge The Square much for its Indian fare because seldom have I seen five star restaurants cook a paratha or dosa well

The ambience overall is extremely pleasant and welcoming, you would feel like making another visit provided you are ready for an expensive and exotic meal

Even the complimentary Baguette and Focaccia bread rolls are extremely tasty and act as perfect appetisers 

All in all I would highly recommend The Square to fellow food lovers

Cheers!

Decent place that is open till wee hours - so you can swing by when hunger pangs strike you. 

I usually go there - and then can only afford the soups and salads. Given the generous serving of bread basket - enough to keep the cravings at bay!

I've had such a bad incident regarding the services. I went for lunch to your coffee shop . My car was with your valet . When I called for it I saw your security gaurd roughing up my car in the worst possible way . How  the hell is a security gaurd driving my car and why don't you have a proper valet. Any damage that has bein done to my car has to be held by the hotel. Kindly look in to this before I press further charges on the individuals and the company alike . Incident has taken place today at 3 15 pm with my red eon

We went there for the Sunday brunch. The restaurant is spread over a huge area and the keywords are elegance and class. The high all glass walls create an illusion of expansiveness. The starters served numbered four. But nothing prepared us for the absolutely splendid spread that was to follow. The variety offered in terms of salads and desserts would impress even the most discerning gourmet. And yes the main course was wonderful and not to mention the variety. I liked the Mexican chicken roast, there was a potato preparation and a dish with mushrooms and corn which I relished. Oh yes there is a chat corner, a fruits section, live quesadilla section among others. There is plenty to choose from whether you be a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian. And then there are the desserts. The diversity will leave you wondering which ones to leave out. Though personally speaking I did not enjoy some desserts, though others were quite good. Since we are Accor members I cannot detail the expenses as Accor members can avail discounted prices. The service is good. The staff is courteous and polite, though I wish they would serve the starters on your plate and not simply at your table.

We were planning to have a team lunch from our office last week, and since Novotel was one of the nearby locations, we went there for the Lunch Buffet last Friday. The dining area was airy and spacious and the seats super-comfortable. We had an area reserved for us and it was a very nice cozy corner. The NorthEast United team from ISL was also lunching a few tables away from us and they were an added attraction.

For the starters, we were served Murgh Tikka Kababs and Fish Tandoori on the table, and I got some Cream of Courgette soup from the Buffet counter. All of them were excellent. The Murgh Tikka and the Fish Tandoori were soft and succulent. The soup was creamy with an earthy flavor.

After the soups, I moved to the Salads section. The Chicken and Mayo, and the Buffalo Tenderloin salad were the best, as also, the Cauliflower and Grilled Veggies salad. The Squid and Shrimp salads had a smell to it, and were not liked by most in our group.

The main course was an average fare, at best. I started off with Pasta and Grilled chicken, both of which were quite bland. I moved to the Indian fare then, and had Naan, Mirch Salan, Keema Muttar, and Malabar Fish Curry. The salan was very good, creamy and tangy at the same time. The Keema Muttar and the Malabar Fish curry were passably good.

I didn't have any dessert after that and finished with a cup of coffee. But, as you can understand, a lot of my colleagues and I were quite disappointed by the lunch. The quality and variety was so average for this huge price, that to most of us, it seemed very little value for money.

There were lots of options in the buffet to choose from.
The ambience, sitting arrangements were properly set to give a classy looks.
The taste of the food were awesome. I loved the kababs and desserts the most.
It is a perfect place to dine in with family.

Its the 24/7 coffee shop of Novotel. Neat place, chique décor, well appointed staff and an elaborate yet well designed menu. I was there at around 5 pm for a high tea with my colleagues. We ordered a Classic Ceasers salad, a few soups, aalu parathas, spaghetti bolognaise and a fruit platter.  Every dish was very well made. I loved the Ceasers salad. They have great lunch and dinner buffet spreads and offers with/ without alcohol as well.

I went there last night with my aunts and cousins for dinner. The Square is spread comfortably over a wide area and has a breathtakingly wonderful ambiance. The staff is extremely well mannered and patiently guided us through the menu. The service was quick and smooth. The Kasundi Murgh Tikka was soft and tasted good. The Kacchhi Haldi ki Macchli didn't sound very inviting but they insisted that it was their specialty and they delivered on it. It was juicy, amazing and a must try. Same goes for the Tandoori Prawn which was equally succulent and flavorful. The Naan and Masala Kulcha were well prepared and perfectly complemented the rest of the dishes. The Dal Makhanwala was rich, creamy and delicious. The Tawa Vegetables was just fine. The Kosha Mangsho, although nothing extraordinary, was cooked to perfection and tasted delicious. The Maachher kalia was a huge flop though and can easily be given a miss. (There was another chicken dish which tasted good but its name escapes my mind.) I also tried the Pad Thai Noodles and honestly it looked disgusting till it was served on to our plates. It tasted even better, very delicious and once again a must try! For dessert I had a tiramisu and to serve this they took a very long time. But it was delicious and a perfect ending to a perfect evening. They took a long while in preparing the bill but the time spent there was very enjoyable and I would love to go there again.

Don't judge me but this was my first visit to this place.

Now that that's out of the way, let me start by saying that I'll divide this review into three sections. 1) Service 2)Ambience 3)Food 

The service was one of the best services from any eatery, if not the best, that I have ever been to. From the moment we walked in till the moment we left we were made to feel like we had won some kind of a exclusive dinner for two or something. The staff was amazingly polite, friendly and yet in a very good way, informal. The satisfaction of my taste buds apparently was their sole priority.

2) The ambiance undoubtedly was as good as the service. We got nice cozy seats and I ate my way into fatso-land. :D

3) The star attraction there is the food and you won't really be disappointed with that.

Well.. Novotel.. It was a good tym spent with you on my birthday.  It has a delightful ambiance along with good quality and quantity of food. Regarding hospitality it was a mixed experience of mine wich i ld lyk to clarify here expectng a better experience wen i visit next tym.  Firstly.. It has a all day dining menu amongst wich the tandoor items wasn't available. Thou u hv mentioned seprtly insyd befre the start of tandoor items that its nt available frm 3pm till 7pm still i ld lyk to draw ur attention  fr the rest as even though u hv kept platters seprtly..but wen i wantd to order one of the waitress said its not available. I am sory to say she was pretty arrogant and aggressive wen i tried to make her undrstand the fact that wen its written n the menu it shouldhv been there since its not a roadside restro or a dhaba. I mean U cant deny the fact that its a drwback in ur menu wich u should correct asap. Anyhow thanks to the guy who served us rest of the tym with his very polite bhvr nd smart attitude unlike the other, turning it into a good experience finally.  Lastly i ld lyk to suggest u, to club some extra add on events lyk playing a guitar or a song or a photograph wen people are choosing you fr the purpose of celebrating their special dez. So u should also put efforts to mk it more special fr them. C u soon !! :)

Grand is an understatement for this beautifully designed hotel Novotel, as well as the rightly named restaurant inside it-The Square.
I visited this place for a Buffet Lunch one afternoon and was bowled over by its grandeur. A huge seating area and beautifully decorated.
The hotel has its origins in France, so the food also gave the feel of a French Connection. A delicious serving of tasty continental food with a few Indian dishes thrown in was sumptous.
2 varieties of starters, 10 varieties of salads, Soup of the day, 3 Indian and 2 Continental Main courses in both Veg and Non-veg options with a Live counter for Pasta, Pizzas was on display. I specially liked the Chicken item, though i dont remember the name.
A huge display of 12 varieties of dessert is what mesmerised me.
The only disappointment was the drink that was offered. I was expecting some kind of a Mocktail from the menu, but they had only one drink of the day, that too a Buttermilk. This left me a little disappointed.
Every foodie must visit this place for a feast of a life-time.

The name itself gives you butterflies deep inside your stomach. I had been to this place for my birthday. A surprise from a friend. The decor is undoubtedly attractive and presence of serenity all over. It was a buffet dinner with lot of varieties. However, I think the menus could had been better. The mocktail could had tasted better. The taste of the food is nothing great compared to the brand name, yet the food were healthy. I felt they paid homage to all kind of vegetable gardend...variety of salads available. No compromise on hospitality and  beautiful ambience. 

Trying this place is never a bad idea. I rate it good but not excellent.

Have been here a couple of times. The ambiance, the food, the hospitality you get will make you come back for this place more than once. 
For the price you pay, you get excellent variety of Continental, Asian and North Indian  food. I loved the pineapple and bacon cube, pinned using a toothpick. Rarely do you get to eat to such an interesting bacon preparation. One thing I noticed both times, they have excellent variety of exotic salads in their spread. The dessert spread too is great!

Wanted to try the lunch buffet for long so went for it on a Friday :) We had a reservation so we're guided to our seats as soon as we reached. Nothing better than being greeted with a warm smile. We were served cream of chicken soup which just edible. Then a fish starter which again tasted decent. Only one starter for the buffet was a let down. We headed for the salad section. I loved their minced chicken and fish pokchoy salad along with aubergine pesto salad. The buffet spread was pretty decent. My favourite picks would be the sarson began,keema matar, thai green curry. The biryani,paneer do pyaza and gratin was also nice. The options for breads were not enough. And now the desserts were bliss... They had 13 types atleast and I loved everything apart from the cranberry custard and some jelly... Overall I would certainly go back ad the buffet is reasonably priced compared the other star hotels and the service is top notch.

* About Novotel- Novotel is a mid-scale hotel brand within the Accor group, typically slotting between the Mercure and Pullman brands. Novotel has close to 400 hotels and resorts in 60 countries.
This a 5-star hotel is the perfect home base when exploring Kolkata. A Rejuvenation space around the outdoor pool with a fully equipped 24 hour Fitness Centre, a Spa & Salon and a Pool Bar. La femme Rooms for Single Lady Travellers, the kid's pool & play zone, the Web corner & the WIFI and the longest breakfast and many more.

* Location- From Newtown Narkelbagan bus stop,take a straight ride. Its before the bridge near Hometown.From airport,by bus or cab, a straight ride of 20 or 30 mins. 
Elaborately, Novotel Located on the main road connecting Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport and the growing IT and commercial hub of Kolkata, the hotel is close to many tourist attractions. A few of them are Nicco Park (8 km approx.), Science City (12 km approx.) and Indian Museum (17 km approx.)Main Rail Station: 21 km approx. 
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport: 11 km approx.

* Ambience- A classy look, nothing too heavy on eyes...adequate space with proper lighting. Suits for a romantic dinner as well as professional meetings.
* Decoration- I liked the decor. They have maintained the modern minimal approach towards it. Loved the look of bar. There was a collection of abstract paintings on display for sale which added to its charm.
* People- Staff was courteous and well behaved. Not overly poking which I liked.
* Service- It was as it should be, I would say.

* Food- I can't remember all the items I have tasted. But I tried- fish in saffron sauce,mutton curry,chilli oyster, chicken meen moilee, chicken/mutton biryani, steamed rice, marinated lamb, squid with red cabbage, Grilled chicken with bell pepper, Roasted beef with marinated potato, mustard exotic sharbat, roasted carrot with broccoli, marinated pumpkin with beans.
The buffet started with clean prawn soup and green bean soup.I disliked the taste of both and moved on to starter section. Point to be noted on starters was that they were put big bucket of ice cubes I.e. served cold. So if you like them hot, it might not be a good start. As for me, I am fine with it as long as they taste good.
I must say I was expecting one roasted item in starters, maybe the affect of last BBQ Nation visit :D.
Moving to main course,Veg main course items were no surprise. Non veg items were good. Although I have had a lot better tasting biryani than here.
Dessert was most enjoyed (the best part I can say ) section by me and my friends.

Well I went to Novotel Kolkata for a shoot few weeks back. I happened to have my lunch at The Square, which is there coffee shop. I must say, the buffet food was just awesome. From the salads to the delicious main course to the sinful desserts, I didnt miss any of them. 
But the most important thing that will always bring me here is the warmth in the staff for their customers. I know Amitava from his previous hotel. And as expected he has done the magic here also. Sriparna, who was serving us was very good and efficient. Kudos to the GM for selecting such dedicated and smiling staffs. CHEERS!!!!

I have been to a few 'The Square' restaurants of Novotel. The one in Kolkata is just about average. Tried out a lunch buffet on a weekday. The variety was not exactly impressive (the number of items were plenty, but the items you look out for was missing). Found the buffet to be a little unidimensional and lop-sided towards Indian cuisine. The non-veg main course were a saving grace. Tried the mutton roganjosh with steamed rice and that was just about it. Even the dessert section fails to live up to the expectation that a person has from the city itself.

The ambience was good, nothing exotic. The staff were very cordial though.

3stars because of their hospitality and I am well known of Novotel for this. The food was not that great, as we ate Non vegetarian and got quite a lot of things customised though on buffet, preferably the Pasta and the Pizza were not upto the mark. Also most importantly if you ca,not serve draught beer, please don't mention in your menu.

I went there with my colleague for an office party. We had purchased Groupon Coupons for the dinner which cost us Rs1299 (Including all taxes). So here is a detailed revies of how was the whole experience and if it was worth it.

Ambience – Well , The Square is the dining part of the 5star hotel Novotel , so it is expected to have a wonderful ambience and it did live up to the expectation. The beautiful interior with long golden curtains, comfortable seating arrangements and brass separators was very soothing. Again it is very spacious so one can easily move around while selecting food without bumping into other guests.

Hospitality – Extra points for this one. Such friendly, ever-smiling, always-helping and courteous staffs really takes any place to a higher level.

Food – The buffet spread is, in one word, LAVISH. There were live pizza and pasta counters (though I was unable to taste them as I was full). The salad counter had 6 non veg varieties and 6 veg varieties and nimboo paani. I tasted all the non veg salads and found the “lamb and babycorn salad” and “Fish and beetroot” salad the best of the lot. The rest were quite average. The starters were served on our table. This service was bit slow as it was freshly prepared on demand but their taste made us forget this demand. There were 2 veg starters and 2 non veg starters. The fish tikka, aloo tikka and chicken tikka were mouth watering. There were around 12-13 items in the main course segment. I tasted only the chicken biriyani, veg noodle, five spices chicken fried rice, mutton jhol and grilled fish in lemon sauce. All of them tasted good but special mention should be made of the mutton jhol. The mutton was soft and of very high quality, it tasted heavenly. Now, coming to the dessert section, the star of the evening. 8 western dessert, pudding, gulab jamun , firni and 3 different flavors of icecream. I took a bite of each of the item and all of them were excellent. The firni was too sweet, but the brioche pudding and the freshly prepared cake gave us heavenly pleasure.

Overall a wonderful experience.

Been there to attend corporate meetings. One must appreciate their promptness in filling up buffet trays, hospitality and decor. Salads are good. Starters are brilliant. Though only a few items in main course but those are very tasty and unique. Dessert is great. You can also have a variety of flavoured tea bags there to help yourself with tea.

The only restaurant this magnificent hotel has is definitely one of the best around. The Square as I have heard is the largest restaurant in Calcutta now, in the present largest hotel of Calcutta, by capacity. The seating arrangements are a delight. They have A la carte and buffet as well. Price range, without a doubt, is on a higher side here. But I would say it's worth it. The food that we had included soup - a delight, flavorsome..it leaves you craving for more; chicken and prawn starters - excellent; tandoori chicken dish - another excellent choice by us; fish preparation - simple but gives you a very special feel; breads - kulcha and lachcha paratha were at its best except that I got a burnt half of lachcha..never mind!; biriyani - just so you know I find Royal's biriyani one of the best in the city and somehow this biriyani reminded me of the very same taste; desserts were without a doubt beautiful and great. A nice dining experience. A must visit restaurant for every food and fine dining enthusiast.

Novotel, is one of the best places to be in Calcutta - dining in Square has become a habit. People serving here are awesome, and the desserts are to die for. If you are in search of the perfect Rissotto - your quest is over my dear friend ! Novotel Square, is not just 24/7 cafe in a 5 star hotel, its food, its service are beyond comparison! Being a regular night outer, and looking for great food in the city at 2 am in the night i have found the right place where i can dine without having a hole in my pocket. Staff is friendly, chairs are comfortable, and the food is just awesome, who can complain when you have all that and more, in the wee hours of night! Love you guys and hope Novotel is as much a superhit, in Kolkata as much as it is elsewhere!

I had heard mixed reviews about this place but after my recent lunch experience, I could say it's a lovely place to dine with great food and superb hospitality.

The restuarant is huge and hence very spacious. The decor is basic yet elegant . The staff are extremely warm, polite and try their best to improve your experience.

Tried the lunch buffet which is pretty reasonably priced at 1000 plus taxes. Coming to food, salads on buffet tasted average so I got a customised salad tossed in balsamic vinegratte which was lovely. There are assorted cheese available. Pita bread, hummus and baba ganoush tasted good. I ordered a clear soup which was superb. The main course spread is pretty wide and loved it. Tried the baked zucchini and spaghetti alio olio wherein the latter was very well made. The Indian main course was pretty good too especially the paneer makhani and naan. Tried some garlic tossed rice with veggies in garlic black bean sauce which were nice.

I personally feel a lot of great buffets disappoint with their desserts but this place did not. I loved their mango gateaux and it was definitely one of the best I have had in the city. Apart from this, loved the black forest, mud cake. However did not quite like their red velvet pastry.

The spread is big enough but items are not in line with general taste buds is what I felt. However they make up for it by personalised service and doing everything they can to give you a great dining experience.

It is a huge hotel with huge space. We got the chance to try the sunday brunch buffet of The Square. Good many mixed options they have of continental, chinese and indian in the brunch. Food and service both were fantastic. Simply good and not even heavier on the stomach. I loved their chinese, pasta, pizzas and all of the north indian dishes. What I also loved of theirs was the egg salad. I still want more. Simply marvelous. All was fresh, delicious and nice.

The spread of starters and also the desserts was good enough. You simply can't have enough of them. There were so many of them. We kept on eating and still so much was left to try. Good menu I must say. I would highly recommend it and would surely give it a must try.
                    

17.12.17 - Happen to be here again as we were very hungry and were nearby so for us The Square was the best option to kill our hunger.

As always it was a great buffet. Only thing is we reached in the last minutes of the end of buffet. Still we were greeted well and served even more well.

I have already mentioned the great buffet these people have and the wide spread of food and cuisines and dishes they serve. 

Special thanx to Ananya who even in such a crowd managed to get a seat for us and for her we did not have to wait even for 2 minutes.

Another very special thanx to SHAFIQUR for serving us whatever we wanted. We really made him run much. He fulfilled all our demands. He served till the last minute of his duty and this is really note-worthy. Thanx once again.

All in all The Square at Novotel, Kolkata serves one of the best buffets in the town. It is a must visit and a very high recommendation from my end.

Me, my best-half and my lil princess went there for dinner and loved the place. The ambience was the best. Food was healthy but not the typical Kolkatan taste what we look for Probashi Bongs.FOod taste would have been much better considering the name of the restora .You can opt for buffet or a la carte. The buffet was a multi cuisine spread. The waiters there were excellent. The attention they gave to our daughter was beyond expectation and that was the main factor which made me so happy. They serve few of the dishes also and very quickly . I m not a dessert person , yet could not stop picking few from a huge range and must say everything tasted like heaven. Apart from the food, they have a kids zone too.Definitely recommended to visit .

I was in square the place is really done tastefully. I was there casually so just wanted to have coffee. I asked for the menu and they said they do not have. So I just asked for a strong cold coffee without cream and icecream. The first time coffee came was tempting and strong. But was at room temperature. The second and third time it was a below normal coffee but cold . Then they say according to them it is fine, and without icecream they could not have done better. So I had to tell them I can do a better job. Then they said they are doing it again and again they could not do. They said that's their standard. So the standard is low. 😡

A new five star hotel on the avenue. Expectations were high and I hence was very particular in my requirements........

I couldnt have asked for more. The main highlight was the attitude of the staffs to help me and assist me what I wanted. 

Anyways ordered for a Salmon main course which was very well done by the Chef. I was informed that since the food was taking time, so someone senior (may be the manager) offered me a chef special salad (which was very good)...
The Chef came and asked for the feedback along with that senior only....
Very Impressed with the Service Culture....KUDOS!!!!
I would love to come here with my family soon....

The Square-undoubtedly a place to visit for foodie like me. I was amazed to see the buffet spread there. The ambience is very nice & pleasant. It's a very nice place to visit with your family. I visited Novotel on my mom's birthday, arranged everything from before,it's was a great time family time and their assistance was commendable and to be honest without their assistance I wouldn't have made it possible. The credit goes to Mr.Amitava Chandra and his staff. That was a grand surprise for my mom and made her feel at cloud9. Not only that,Mr.chandra said, "there was surprise waiting for all of you and then he got a nice cake for all of us." That was again a big surprise from them and for me as well. We were so happy with the hospitality and there caring nature which make us feel like home. Not only in Kolkata, I've also visited The Square- Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad  and Delhi, I feel same the home like experience everywhere. Being belong from a hospitality industry, I can rather say they always try to do something or the other out of the box. I do love to visit this place very frequently for its buffet spread n the behaviour of the staff. And I believe Novotel nowadays becoming the best place to visit again and again. Thank you Novotel.

We went to this brand new property for a dinner with my family. The Square was there All Day Dining and I was a little perplexed before entering the restaurant. But once I entered I was amazed to see the grandeur of the restaurant. We went for the buffet as was suggested by one the managers. The buffet was very nice with a good variety and on top of it I was told by the manager that if we wanted something which was not there in the menu, could be made for us. The food was excellent and the chefs took care to make my pasta and pizza(part of the buffet arrangement). 
            But the highlight was the staffs who took great care of us and asked whether we were enjoying our food or not. Everyone was very humble. I shared my number with them as they wanted to keep me informed regarding food promotions. 
       I would highly recommend this outlet to everyone as they know how to take care of one's needs and very humbly

Well not everybody's cup of tea. The Square screams of "Class". If you don't have the eye for it, you would just hate this place. Had Salmon Pave and a simple white sauce pasta. Very continental, amazing and i loved it. Study of chocolate didn't much live up to the expectations of  being the only chocolate desert, but nevertheless had a nice quiet dinner there. Give it a go if you don't have a constrained pocket. 4 out of 5 for me.

Not recommended at all.. Though decorating and garnishing was done pretty well..  I don't know why i didn't liked the continental dishes as well with respect to taste..

Novotel has a reputation not just in india but also abroad. I have stayed in the one located in Leeds and Barcelona. Abroad it is considered to be a mid range airport  hotel with good customer service and facilities. Their buffets too are good and top notch. The fact that it opened here in Kolkata was nice and i had my eye on it for quiet some time. 

The hotel, the ambiance is superb, huge and professionally maintained with care. The restaurant "The Square" is done very well. It has outdoor seating overlooking the pool but food is not served there. Just beverages and desserts. The staffs are very informative and courteous.

Now coming to the menu and food. I was disappointed as they had very limited options on their menu and after 3pm tandoor  items are not available. So from their limited items we went for the New Town thin crust pizza. It was yum and well done having a crunch but   the chicken on the pizza was very little. I would any day go to pizza hut and have a filling meal that come here and empty my pocket. 

The place is a let down when it comes to their  a-la-carte menu and is heftily priced. A bottle of aquafina is 120 and himalaya is 150, steeper than Taj. But considering 
 its international fame i knew the place would be expensive but the fact that it lacks options is disappointing. Had the food been good and ful filling i wouldnt mind spending. 

The staff told us their buffet is a must try as it has 12 to 13 dishes and a widespread of desserts ranging at 1599 plus tax without alcohol and 1799+ with alcohol. So those out there who want a fine dine experience can come here and try their buffet.

Overall ambiance wise satisfied but food wise not upto mark.

There was quite a hype about Novotel, so we decided to visit for Lunch on a saturday and we were really disappointed. First of all, front office staff stares at you but does not bother to greet you coz you are not staying with them. As soon as we entered their restaurant we were greeted by their hostess. Then our waitress came informing us that she would be serving us this afternoon. Service without doubt is good but food is a disaster. I am myself a hotelier and can say you really need to work on your food. standards. We started with soup, cream of zucchini which was good. Then came starters, rajma kebab. I have never eaten anything worse ever, so dry, tasteless and no chutney. Service staff was courteous enough to serve Paneer Tikka since we did not like Rajma tikki. However we could taste raw masalas in paneer and it was dry. My zeal of telling them that this was also not good had gone. Salads were good. Maincourse i have no words. Poor selection of dishes. Paneer in hot and sweet gravy and they expect us to eat it with Indian bread. Dry Palak panner was good, but mushrooms were bad. I think their Indian chefs have never tasted a good zafrani pulao because what they served was far away from authentic zafrani pulao. Guys keep it simple but authentic. We finally moved to desserts. They had a nice spread in desserts which was good. However they served Phrini with no bowls. I asked for a bowl from one service staff, but he never came back, two service staff were chatting in front of me however both stared at me but did not bother to ask if i needed anything. A very average experience. I had expected a lot more from you Novotel.

A new property in the rajarhat-newtown area, Novotel impressed me at the first sight. The main road side of the hotel looks grand and sophisticated. Even the entrance feels huge. It was a dinner date with my partner. The Square is in the ground floor and the seating is wide spread. We were led to our table by the oh-so-courteous manager. We got a coupon for unlimited beverages/food for two as a part of their publicity programme and we went to avail that. So really NO IDEA about the price. 
Now coming to the food:
There were 2 types of soup. Tomato basil and a prawn something. The tomato basil soup tasted good. The prawn one tasted exactly like 'Chingri Malaikar' as if it was the dish mixed with water and blended. Hehe! Nevertheless good enough. Then arrived our starters. One was with cottage cheese and the other was chicken reshmi kebab i guess. The pudina dip saved the paneer one literally. The chicken starter was okay. Next i tried the assortments of salads. This part of the meal satisfied me the most. There were salads of chicken, buffalo and pokchoy, pork and tuna. The buffalo and pokchoy was a bit hard to cut through since it was a cold salad and buffalo meat tends to get tougher to cut into when cold. The tuna was hard to find in the salad but when eaten as a whole, it was yum. The pork salad was good with walnuts in it as well. The chicken sausage salad with horse raddish was good too. The best was a pickled chicken salad. Delicious! There were other salads too and one egg salad also. From the vegetarian section, i tried the dahi vada and as usual it was awesome! After the salads i moved on to the main course. I tried everything from the non-vegetarian section. The was a roasted chicken which tasted bland. There was diced buffalo meat which was okay. The baked/fried fish was good. I liked it. I loved the butter chicken. The mutton biriyani wasnt too fancy but the mutton was tender. There was an item whose name i cant remember. It was a spicy curry. So i took a very tiny helping. Bland again! Okay i didnt try the sarson fish. Instead i tried the paneer and that was good. I had the penne pasta in white sauce from the live counter. I fell in love with it. Generous amount of chicken and cheese. Drooling!
The dessert section was the hugest i have seen in any buffet. Ample number of mousses. Two kinds of ice cream. Array of toppings and many more. I tried blueberry mousse, chocolate mousse, some pastries etc. And i was full. End of dinner. For beverage they served us pepsi and water in cute small bottles.
The staff was extremely helpful and courteous. The ambience was serene. Perfect for a romantic date. I would suggest you visit it atleast once. Cheerie!

The ambience is just great and quite royal. Got fantastic service. Soham spoiled us. Getting this type of service at a place which is so new and away from city and also at around midnight is just fabulous. They cooked Thai green curry, noodles and some side dishes ( sorry don't remember). Don't have all the famous single malts but would soon have. Further the lady out there could be little more cheerful. Might be she is sent to Sampan of same group in Mumbai and share some cheer from the lady out there. ????

The newly opened 5 star restaurant at New Town came to my wish list since it was opened few months back. Grand architecture and wide spread area of Novotel will amaze you for sure. Everything was spic and span. Special mention to their General Manager Mr. Jai Kishan and Sales Director Mr. Debashis Brahma for hosting our corporate team lunch buffet.In non-veg starters we were served Fish Darshani and Chicken Reshmi Tikka which were excellent. Soup was bland. Few mocktails were unique and nicely presented. My favorite was Guava with mint. Special mention for the thin crust pizzas and pastas. White sauce pasta was too creamy and just melt inside mouth. Amazing taste and fresh quality.
Main course had around 12 to 14 dishes including veg and non-veg. Honestly I didn't find it much appealing taste wise but the spread selection was good. I will suggest Novotel management to look into this as a scope of improvement.
Desserts were sinful and will tempt you like anything. Too hard to resist.Staff were extremely decent and courteous. They don't have word NO in their dictionary and will do anything to increase satisfaction level. Such customer service not very common in this part of the world hence this restaurant has huge potential to be one of the top notch specialty dining in the town just need to smoothen those rough edges.
Lunch buffet will be INR 999+ and dinner buffet INR 1500+. Such competitive pricing for a luxury hotel is a steal and would highly recommend to everyone.

Novotel hotel is another feather in the bouquet of luxury hotels in Kolkata. Apart from Kolkata, other Indian cities that can boast of a Novotel property are  -  New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Pune, Goa, Vishakapatnam, Bengaluru and Chennai. Worldwide, Novotel is a chain of over 450 hotels and resorts! Of all the other Kolkata luxury hotels, this one has the most spacious and stylish portico.

‘The Square’ is one of the five eating oulets/restaurants located in the hotel. It serves mainly Asian and European cuisine and it is the most spacious of all the Kolkata based restaurants. The straight lined floor area and furniture, French windows, ample natural light, granite flooring etc. very much remind you of ‘Waterside Café’ at ‘Hyatt Regency’!

‘The Square’ is a 100 plus seater restaurant with seating clusters of 4 and 8. Seating arrangements exist in the form of chairs, sofas, and also the combination of both. When combined with sofa, the chairs become circular in shape and enjoy the matching upholstery. Tables are rectangular. Décor is straight lined, modern day, wooden, metallic  and minimal. Hue is red and earthy shades.  Few potted plants are also present. A big metallic installation is placed at the onset of the restaurant. And the other end consists of the buffet area. A beautiful collection of decorative butterflies adorn the horizontal wall structure therein. Décor quality is good. But much better exists in some other local luxury hotels.

We visited this place during this year’s Durga Puja and were advised by the staff to opt for the lavish buffet, which looked tempting and had enough vegetarian options. We started with dal shorba, a collection of cold salads, dahi vada and hot snacks, like – aloo chop and kathi roll. We followed this by an assortment of curries/vegetables, like – paneer butter masala, aloo korma, lau, palak shager chorchori, Bengal style baingan, rice, dals, Indian breads and pizza. Lastly, we went for coffee and an assortment of local and European desserts. Hot snacks, Indian breads and pizza were prepared fresh and served on the table. Both taste and presentation were good. Palak shager chorchori was unexpectedly tasty.

Staff was apt, warm and courteous, but needs much better training and confidence to befit such a renowned world class hotel. However, the restaurant has a relaxed atmosphere.

Since we visited during Puja time, the buffet menu was elaborate and consisted of many dishes of the local cuisine.

Pocket pinch is on the higher side.

Timing: 24 hours

They say there are no free lunches in the world! So though I ate for free at the Novotel, and it was a dinner not lunch, I really cannot term it as 'free'. I earned my dinner you may say, I was here for the annual felicitation dinner which was hosted for people who had worked really well throughout the year! Now that is besides the point really. 

The remarkable thing is the ambience of the hotel which is truly close to world-class! You would not imagine it to be so good from the inside, if you were to go by the location or accessibility, on the outside.
And coming to the food - well, 5-stars really do not bring out their best fare to a hungry group of corporates, but Novotel made a try that is worth a mention. The cucumber infused mohito/lime soda was quite innovative. The kebabs were succulent and tasty. The main course was a buffet spread of 10-12 items - very mainstream-taste and quality wise just about OK - the dessert was however pretty damn nice - decent tiramisu, outstanding chocolate mud cake, ice cream, jalebis with a very very delectable dose of rabri. Need I say more! 

Could not take pictures with the crowd around me, but surely worth a try this place!
They say free food tastes better! I say earned food tastes the best! Cheers!

Atrocious is an understatement.

Wanted to check the new destination in town so went for dinner.The ambience was nice & bright wish they had put in some extra effort on the F&B They still do not have a Bar hence ordered for a Red Bull & New Zealand Lamb Chops. In spite of featuring in the menu, it was not available & as per the managers suggestions ordered for the Indian Lamb Chop. The meat was stiff & smelly. The smashed potato was so much salty , The only good thing was the boiled vegetable sautéed in butter. To get over the awful experience , ordered for a 2nd round of Red Bull which was not available, The only good thing about the place was the service. 
A sincere suggestion to the management to look into the matter.

Went with my wife, in laws and my 2 year old. The baby chair was conspicuously not given on request made couple of times and on hardened enquiry understood the PO has been given. So much for a hotel which boasts of kid zone and is having it right at the entrance.  On choosing al carte as the choice for the evening, was insisted for buffet and even offered 20% discount which when rejected was said aka carte takes min 25in to serve. Are you ready to wait. By this time I was determined to go for ala cart and the wait for the food began. The soup was good and gondhoraj paneer tikka was amazing. However the confusion on setting the plate was a little out of the place. Moving into the main course, we're amazed at the quantity served. Shocking to see our favourite dishes in bowls and blue cheese naan served in small baskets. My mood went a little bad when saw the rice served in a bowl and stashed. Holy cow, who on earth serves rice on a dinner table as if it is tiffin box.  The food quality good but awfully short of service level and the standard dinner protocol manners which I think is a training issue. Ala carte gave a different impression. May be buffet would have been different.

Hello there,

We(my wife, my 5 year old daughter and I) went for a buffet breakfast. I just loved the ambience. The food quality was pretty good, the spread was enough(if not more than enough for some people), the staff was friendly and they were keeping an eye on us. The breakfast buffet for two of us was a little less than Rs. 2,200/- including tax. 
I must thank the chef/chefs for the quality of food. My favourite were the bacon strips on the crispy toast and the salmon preparation. Dessert section was also well spread. Looking forward to more visits. 
Cheers!!

Again visited on 17/10/2015: This time for buffet lunch. Almost Rs. 3,600/- for two adults and one child. It was complimentary for the child.
Food as usual awesome. Good spread; quality Novotel standard; service was very very good; ambience perfect. This joint is my favourite. Thank you #teamNovotelKolkata
