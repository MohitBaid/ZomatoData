It's a pretty good place for late night dinner since it is open 24x7. Talking about the food, the Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce was not so good and tasty but on the other hand, the chicken Malai Kebab and the Ch.Manchow Soup was really tasty. Everyone must try the Ch.Malai Kebab it was really very tasty, something cheesy was melting at each bite. The service was a little bit poor because of Durga Puja rush but I heard that they provide a good service on the non-occasion days.

Nice place to dine with family and friends especially if you are a night owl. Affordable price. Good ambience and good array of cuisine to choose your platter from. The waiter and staff there in are extremely cooperative and welcoming. 
For quality eating at the late hours The Palm of Pan Asia is a must go. 
P. S.  They have free WiFi and that is good for instagrammers and fb people.

Sometimes for our night outs we need a place to sit and eat other than Jai hind which is the normal place to goâ€¦ Pan asia is another place right next to Jai Hind Dhaba serving multiple cuisines and styles. This is like an upper market Jai Hind Dhabaâ€¦. The interiors are OK and the tables and chairs are solidâ€¦

In all the times I have been here we ordered the continental food once but realized that sticking to the basics of North India is best for Pan asiaâ€¦

One thing to noteâ€¦ the waiters donâ€™t give a damn about youâ€¦ you come sit go or whatever.. it hardly makes a difference to themâ€¦ second point of notingâ€¦ get ready to waitâ€¦ on a normal Friday Saturday night this place is a little fullâ€¦ in that scenario a person should be ready to wait for like 30 or 40 Minsâ€¦ third thing to note is that if you order different cuisines then the food will come at different timesâ€¦ this is a general practiceâ€¦.

Now coming to the foodâ€¦ as I mentioned their continental is nothing great to talk about and I would not advise it anyway to anyoneâ€¦ I have tried their soups and they taste pretty goodâ€¦ not as good as an oriental place but then it is manageable if someone is in the moodâ€¦ 

Now itâ€™s the North Indian that takes their real creamâ€¦ this is their forte and this is what is really good to eat in Pan Asiaâ€¦ from the daal to the paneer to the veggiesâ€¦ the food is very good and heavyâ€¦. The taste is spot on and it does not have that dalda dalda feel to it which is the biggest differenceâ€¦

A special mentioned to their veg biryani as my family and friends definitely call for the same every time we do land up hereâ€¦

Nice atmosphere. The dinning space is however not that spacious. Nevertheless, the food was delicious. The crispy chilli baby corn was worth the try.

After a long time, I can clearly recommend a restaurant which serves really quality and good food. 24 x 7 open and hospitable staff. Valet parking available which is very useful. 

Must have - Dal Makhani and the Malai Chicken Kebab. 

However, the washroom should be upgraded and more clean.

A good place to go if can't decide between Continental, Indian and Chinese. Although Chinese dishes are not that great compared to the Continental and Indian preparations but it tastes alright. Continental and Indian are equally good. My absolute favorite is the Chicken Spaghetti Aroma. The dish is a complete meal itself, delicious and filling. A perfect dish if you are in the mood for Continental, specially Italian. Staffs are friendly and the pricing is just okay in my opinion. Overall a good restaurant for Continental and Indian food.

Average, in a good way. The restaurant is mainly for the guests staying at the hotel. But you can munch your way in late nights, too. The prices are reasonable, like any average restaurant and the food is good, especially continental.

This place is best for continental food as I have tried only that. 
Loved the baked fish with mexican rice and chicken steak.
This is open 24 hours which makes it more accessible at night after office .

customer relationship management is good enough.. we got a lot of feedback calls and complimentary replacement orders as well.. the food was good this time.. if they can maintain this kind of CRM activity.. and assure good quality.. it might become one of its kind in south east Asian food.. try Darshaan (desert)..!!

I went to Pan Asia on Thursday for dinner. Their Thai green curry tastes more like mint chutney with vegetables. I think they have fired the entire staff as their restaurant is empty most of the times. I had to go to the cashier to fetch my bill. To top it all there was this fat lady ( most probably the owner ) sitting in the dining area and showing her public speaking skills and letting everyone know what her problems in life are..! No wonder this place is so trashy. Eat nothing but don't visit this awfully pathetic place.

Now people like us get hungry and need food 24 hours a day...that's no rocket science to crack. But you cannot always go to a five star to binge with your cravings. Pan asia came as a bounty bfor such situations. Have dined here numerous times...latest being Eid. Was introduced to this place by my Bestie Mriganka and boy did mesmerise me or what.Â 
Food to look out for:
1) Dal Makhani: Ohh My Godddd!!!This velvet concoction of lentils butter and sprinkles of heaven is like a must have. Not trying it will be considered a sin.
2) Rara Gosht...Tender piecesof mutton cooked in minced mutton gravy with the right amount of spices is a flood gates of Falvours.
3) Grilled Fish In Lemo Butter Sauce
4) Veg Lasagne
Â What i like most is they prepare all types of cuisine but dont get carried away. Missing is alchohol...coz with good food you need good booze. But that is for those who like their peg or two for me....its a make shift paradise.

Warning: Dont try their Fresh Lime sodas because they just always end up making it wrong.

Pan Asia Restaurant - Open 24 Hours. Party All Night den drop in here or Jai hind nearby. 
==============================================================================
Location: 

Its been quite sometime i have visited this place. It is situated right beside jai hind Dhaba, Sarat Bose Road and serves 24 hours at hotel rates? Can you beat that? I remember i had partied at Plush and at around 2:30 somewhat.. i came here to eat food. This hotel looks quite good and as i entered inside with couple of my friends, i gave my order. The service was quite slow but worth the wait. 
==============================================================================
Food Ordered:

1) Dal Makhani - It was awesome. Hot and mouth melting. 
2) Chicken Butter Masala - This was quite lovely. With perfect cream and no extra additions. 
3) Tandoori Roti - It was good too.
==============================================================================
Summary:
Food quality 4/5
Food quantity 3.5/5
Taste 4/5
Hygiene 4/5
Service 3/5
Value for money 3.5/5
==============================================================================
Conclusion:

The prices are bit on the higher side but place serving you all night at a little higher prices are well acceptable. Nice place to dine in with friends or family. :) It has got enough space to accommodate a lot of people. :)

I had visited this place 2 months back for a quick bite and coffee.It is located in the pan asia international hotel located close to jai hind.Though i had a heard a lot about the chinese here, we werent hungry so we ordered snacks and coffee. The decor reminds you of the 1990s royalty:) 
We found the place empty baaring one table where a family was enjoying evening snacks. 
Our order was a bruschetta and 2 hot coffees.The cutlery here caught my attention. and i could help but notice the good quality. 
Whatever we tried was good. 
So on the basis of that i found the place nice.The service too was a delight. 
I shall visit this place soon to sample the chinese it is famous for :)
