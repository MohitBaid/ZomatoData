The food was good with good ambience. The biriyani was tasty and the moctails were also good. Overall a nice restaurant if you have a low budget.

While surfing through Zomato starving as hell one evening, this restaurant with a very reasonable price caught our sight. And it didn't fail to amaze us! The decor was decent and the staffs were very well mannered. We ordered "Chicken Biryani", "Chicken Kadai", "Garlic Naan". While eating Chicken Biryani we couldn't differentiate Arfa's biriyani from any other renowned Mughlai restaurants like Aminia, Arsalaan. It tasted soooo good üòã. Coming to the chicken kadai it was a bit spicy but was delicious indeed. The garlic naan was thick & spicy with all sorts of masalas. I'll prefer to order only one garlic naan for two adults! All the prices in menu were inclusive of taxes. A pocket friendly restaurant I would like to visit again :')

This restaurant located at bentick street caught our attention as it was a hot summer afternoon and we were starving and dehydrating at the same time. Our only focus was to get a good eatery where we can sit comfortably and savour the lunch. So decided to check this out and we headed to the first floor. We were pleased to find comfortable couches and pleasant temperature, optimum lighted and decently decorated. 

Menu features popular Bengali and Indian kebab and gravy dishes. Without checking at the entire menu we quickly placed our order for Chicken Reshmi butter masala and Butter Naan to go along with. Must say, we found service a bit slow like water and server coming to you to take order. It was obvious that they are managing with very few staff. 
Service was quick and food was served at right temperature. Bread was warm and soft. Chicken pieces were Tender and juicy but the gravy was too thick and lacked the flavour 
Overall a good experience. Check this joint out once just in case you are at this part of the city and looking for a decent ambience wise eatry.

Though I had never tried Bengali food but I had tried various Indian dishes.All mouth watering with lots of spices.The best part is that the quantity is quite more comapred to similar restaurant but service is slow as there is a shortage in number of waiters.Rest is good

going by the looks, it seems that the restaurant has recently opened at bentink street. the decor is decent. as it hasn't gained popularity¬†yet, the place was kinda empty. the ambience was nice. we ordered a half tandoori chicken as starter and 4 tandoori rotis and a half tengari butter masala. the tandoori was good. though it could be cooked more softly and slowly. the pieces in tengari chicken butter masala was huge and tasted good too. the rotis¬†were a little burnt but that was okay. the two points i would like to highlight is ¬† 1. our bill was 325 total ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†2. they don't levy taxes. all the rates are inclusive of tax. ¬†the service was good and quick. a fantastic food experience (may be because we were starving) very much within budget.my suggestion is if you are in the strand road or dalhousie¬†area, try this joint once. it should worth it.
