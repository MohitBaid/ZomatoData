Food doesn't mean just serving edible vegetables. Kolkata is a city which is undergoing food evolution and this kind of set up is not upto the mark. Kindly improve .

They make some chicken dish. I don't remember the name. It's chicken pieces wrapped in eggs and then dipped in gravy. Still remember the taste!!

So it happened, that I was near the swimming pool area and was very hungry so visited this place. It was during the evening time and we ordered snacks items. The service was very slow. They didn't even have any drinks on the menu other than regular cold drinks. The taste of the food was also just okay. Didn't have a very good experience.

Not up to the mark. Crispy chicken was flavoursome but qay too saggy. Dal makhani had a stale smell. And ginger chicken was undercooked. Okay for one visit.

Food is affordable and good. However, their delivery service is not at all upto the mark. They usually take at least half an hour extra to deliver food. On one of my orders, I couldn't even contact the restaurant. They didn't pick up.

Went out in search of a restaurant and randomly entered here...  Ambience is ok types..  The table clothes need to be better and cleaner..  A big downside is the service time..  They take a lot of time to serve even the popular dishes like noodles and chilli chicken..  What i liked is the food..  We ordered mixed gravy noodles and dry chilly chicken..  Tasted good..  Even if the service is really slow, the staff behaviour was pleasant...

Get ready to wait at least an hour after you order your food, even it is a harmless bottle of cold drinks. Food not bad, okay. Can do better. As for the payment, they would inform you that they accept cards. But each and every time the bill is presented and you hand over your card the swipe machine does not work. How ironic and eerie.

Location is the only plus point I could find about this place, but when you are near Swimming pool area is Salt Lake, you have plenty of good places to go to. 

The ambiance isn't great. The service ranks even lower. The quality of food is equally bad. No taste, no flavor. Very very ordinary food. Surprisingly enough, the prices are on the higher side.

Yesterday 15th Aug'16 I went to this Joint. It is a horrible experience to my family. Food Quality is so bad beyond your imagination . I had ordered Chilli Chicken. But they had served rotten chicken with unbearable odor. But price is almost equal to elite restaurant. The Service is so bad beyond any imagination. A single waiter is working & owner is shuttling to kitchen now & then with dual role. I had waited almost 30 mins for a plate of Fish finger. The Quantity of Food is so small that my a plate pan fried noodle price of Rs.225 is not sufficient. How this type of Food Joint is continuing in Posh Area of Salt Lake?

We ordered chicken patiwala, Tandoori chicken, Vetki tandoori, mutton kasha, mixed fried rice and butter naan. 
Vetki tandoori was something a fish lover must try...it's too tasty. Chicken patiwala is a tasty preparation too..the chicken thick white gravy preparation was served inside the wrap of omelette. Tandoori chicken was good but could have been more better. Mutton kasha was good,moderate spicy. Butter nan's were served hot n soft. It's a pocket friendly yet a good restaurant.

And this is how you exactly go down the meter-scale! Memories with Silvery Chimney goes down way back, when this started as a small outlet situated inside of a garage with a few chairs placed outside to cater to dine-in! It was much later, that a new and improved version called New Silver Chimney came up and gradually closed down the former.

I had visited here a couple of times, the last being quite sometime back! The quality of the food here is such that you would definitely regret coming here. The ambiance is horrible, the drinks are a mess, the food are pathetic! In short, the restaurant is just not worth it! You wouldn't like the noodles nor would you like any side dish. Most of them are cold and smelly! 

I wouldn't have had bothered to rate here at all, but the only reason I am giving 1.0, more than the fact that Zomato allows a minimum of 1, is due to the memories associated with Silver Chimney!

The place has a horrible service and management. We were not served water anytime throughout we were there and our glasses remained empty. The wait for food was very long and frustrating. The waiters lacked training and courtesy; even lethargic at times.

The food was poor as well and lacked appropriate salt and spices. The quantity was sufficient though. The soup was nice. We had Lung Fung soup, Crispy Chilly Fish, Chicken Wings with Hot chips but Hot Chips was missing. Very distasteful experience.

In kolkata, there are few known places where I have not ordered Chinese delicacies but this place served really different type of food. Price is a bit high but quantity is accurate, not to forget the prepartion. Around the vicinity, I would really consider going here for the taste.

Smelly plates,dirty spoons,empty water glasses and to top them all,we were served fish and were forced to believe that it was chicken.afterwards a waiter changed it after 15mins of begging.ya BEGGING.we ordered for noodles and were served rice.AC was not working so fan was put up with the paper napkins playing hide and seek everywhere in the air.food was stale.manager was ill behaved.lastly the bill.they added two extra items in the bill as free gifts which we didnt order,WHOA two new dishes,who ate them dunno.it was in the bill.on being told thay made a new bill where food total was Rs 350 less than the previous one but VAT was the same.shame on them.pls close this restaurant down.creepy shameful performance.a -5.0/5 rating.

This place is my school days restaurant. Awesome food and hospitality is good. Little bit clumsy. Try chicken Patiala and masala kulcha. Reasonable price.

For those who don't wanna go all through the sequence of horrid events, the list of horrid events are there at the end of the review, for the whole nightmare please read on:

This was during the last day of Durga Puja 2015, the greatest festival of the Bengalis. Me and my family had chosen this restaurant over others' as we had our Pujo dinners in this restaurant in the past years, and had a nostalgia attached to it.
Let's get down to business and share the harrowing experience we had. We were allotted a table, and were instantly welcomed by a <<<<'baby cockroach'>>>> peeping from beside a piece of cutlery on the table!! Whoa!!! What the hell?!?? Did the food inspectors didn't come here? Do they even exist in this part of the world?

After our request to change the plates and cutleries to the waiters (they didn't had the basic training/common sense to change those themselves!) for a number of times, they allotted us a new and a smaller table (we were 8 persons). They had <<<<'left those plates and cutleries'>>>> there on the previous for other guests to use!! Is this the way to treat unsuspecting guests??? Don't the restaurant people know from what shit (in its literal sense) do these cockroaches travel?

Coming to the newly allotted table, we had to <<<< 'literally beg'>>>> for water. Our glasses had filled up with round one of water with help of multiple iteration of requesting the waiters to fill up un-filled or half-filled glasses of water!!

With half the appetite vanishing in thin air (the cute baby little cockroach is majorly responsible for it!!) and majorly because of our tummies gurgling with hunger at 9:30 P.M, we were handed over the menu. Wait, we were handed over the <<<<'F-E-S-T-I-V-A-L M-E-N-U'>>>>. The choices were less and the prices were quite a few times over the normal limit. This <<<>>>, so we were fooled and <<<<'felt somehow cheated'>>>>. We could have gotten far far better restaurant at this price range!!!

Now that our appetite had reached record all time low we ordered our dinner with apprehension. We had ordered Chinese and North Indian (veg.) dishes. After some waiting for some standard time, the dishes arrived. Fingers crossed. They were <<<<'served by the waiters themselves'>>>> (hope it's a good omen!!).

One of the standard things served complimentary with North Indian foods are Onions (all other North Indian restaurants serve them as compliments), but <<<<'they were missing from our table'>>>>. We had requested them to bring the same. Almost instantaneously the waiter came up with a container with onion and pickle. To our utter disgust and disbelief, there were <<<<'food items sticking onto the onions'>>>> that came!!! They were <<<<'previously served to other guests'>>>. THIS IS NOW DISGUSTING!!!!!! I mean, what kind of person can do this?? Now we are having doubts about all the foods that we were served. We were <<<<'not also offered water during the course of our meal'>>>>. We had to ask repeatedly for the glasses to be topped up!!

After having as much little food we could just to satiate our hunger, we paid the bill and got out of this ordeal.

So, in a nutshell the horrid experiences were:
1.  Cockroach crawling over table in the restaurant.
2.  Contaminated cutlery and utensils not removed from table and kept there to be used by other upcoming guests.
3.  Heavily overpriced 'festival menu' that was not advertised on Zomato (same is attached herewith), that we had discovered after visiting the restaurant.
4.  Very poor service like topping up of water glasses during meal, and before start of meal.
5. Complimentary thing like onions missing with North Indian dishes.
6. Served previously used onions during meal.

Hope Zomato had a system of providing negative rating. I would have given -5.0 for this shame of an eatery called 'New Silver Chimney'.

Thanks for reading!!!

Dinner on 7th October 2015
Ambience 7/10
I expected a bit more for the food, with the ambience and outer looks. Decent ambience.

Service 7/10
Service was ok, but the staff were kind of dead without smiles.

Food quality 6/10
Starters were good (Cream of Tomato soup and Crispy Chilly Baby Corn) which came soon. Main course came very late, which was a disappointment. Almost all items were sweet in nature. I guess its the Bengali style.

Quantity 8/10
Quantity is more than enough for a single dish I would say. We were 5 and ordered 2 rice(Basmathi and Kashmiri), 1 Nan,3 Curries(Dal,Paneer Butter and Potal); still food remained behind.

I would say, for casual dinner, this is a choice. But with expectations and taste buds, better try somewhere else. I still couldn't believe that it was the authentic food from Bengal!

One of my oldest memories of silver chimney is that i visited the restauranT first in the yr 2002(more than a decade ago) at bf block....food was awesome then, but i dont know whether it is maintaining the same standards or detoriated in its quality.
Frankly speaking , due to emergence of various eat out joint in and around salt lake, perhaps the restora has lost its popularity a bit.
Ambience wise it is ok, also the price is ok.
Today, my memories is cherising the food i used to ate when i was in my school days.
Specially i remember the burnt pepper chicken , sweet corn chicken soup and crispy chilli baby corn.

An utterly disappointing joint. The service was tolerable at best. The food, a mix of good and horrible. The order i placed...
Crispy mushroom- this was good.
Schezwan fish- the gravy was nice but the fish a little smelly.
Lat meh kai chicken- an 'ok' version.
Chilli garlic rice- the shocker.
I was served regular mixed fried rice, which wasn't very tasty either. Upon confronting the person with who i placed the order, he excused himself to go find out only to come back and say "ma'am this is chilli garlic". I was stunned by their utter denial to accept their mistake. When the bill arrived, it had mixed fried rice printed on it.
 This was a rather unique experience to say the least.

They simply doesn't desereved to be called a multi cuisine restaurant. It's my 7th time at this place and i am sharing my utter dissatisfaction.
When you order something you will get your food minimum twenty to thirty minutes later even when there is no rush.
Secondly u won't have the freedom to order anything you feel like because half of them written in the menu is not available. You neee to eat according to the available food.
They charge a lot for their food compared to other better restaurants than them in the city.
And last but not the least they make disastrous continental dishes. Will never try their continental even for free.
If u still wanna try then try your luck ;)

This is one of those places in Salt Lake, that has its own charm and identity. Silver Chimney is located at the popular hangout place named Swimming Pool. The ambiance is of great standards and the service is quite impressive. You can have delicious food at a very reasonable prices at Silver Chimney.

I would love to visit sometime soon..
***************
My last visit was not that great and I was utterly disappointed with the drastic dip in their standards. It's not the place it used to be and now, I would have to think a million times before I decide for a visit.

I ordered through foodpanda and was promised a delivery time of 45 minutes. But they took 2 hrs to deliver to a location 5 mins away. Totally unprofessional. Had to call in like 10 times to ask the status of the parcel. Pathetic Service really. To top it, the food was not hot, no addons, and no real taste that could have justified a 2hr long wait. To top it all with misguidance and misinformation on every call made. On the whole, ordinary food, bad packaging,pathetic delivery but real high cost. Stay away if u dnt wana sleep hungry or curse yourself the whole night.

It was really not a great experience at Silver Chimney.  I was asked to try 'Chicken Punjabi' as it was supposed to be good. It was not good. Simple as that! People should pay some respect to chicken preparations when they add the word 'Punjabi' to it. Drinks are a huge disappointment here.

Service of this restaurant may make you lose your nerves. They make you wait for long, very long for the food to arrive at your table (yeah, the one you ordered half an hour ago). Plus, they never accept cards. Don't believe what's written at the restaurant's door. They never accept the cards. Moreover, they won't inform you that they would accept cash only. They will make you run to the ATM even if it's raining. I have been there. May be they feel some kind of pleasure by doing that. I believe if I am paying them my hard-earned money, I deserve a decent service. A good service always make up a little (just little) for the worst food.

Warning: Don't go to Silver Chimney if you are throwing some party. It will ruin your mood.

We were great fan of silver chimney... but our last dinner experience was so bad, that would never suggest anyone to dine here.. the service was good.. but the food quality has been degraded a lot. We ordered chicken kosha and chicken bharta. Both were not good in taste and also chicken was not cooked properly. Masala kulcha was not at all eatable. So, please don't try this place till they change their cook.

The quality of food is not bad at new silver chimney, but the service was a huge let down. The fried chicken was well cooked and tossed in a very tasty sauce. We were suggested to have the patiala chicken which turned out to be quite spicy. The Hyderabadi chicken went well with the butter naan, and the green mango smoothie was a disaster. But what was disappointing was the long time they took to serve the food. And over that someone walked right across the seating area with a pot of dhuno and the entire place was just filled up with smoke. The fan made it even worse and all this resulted in a very bad eating experience. For the food its only at par, but the hospitality was poor.

Don't expect too much from them. if you are looking for a different dish, then this is not the right place. Each and every time when i ordered huan fish' as mentioned on their menu. they go and send some much experienced guy, who comes and tells us, sorry sir this is not available right now and this happened with me 4-5 times. so, silver chimney is not good at all. yes it is good for very common food like biriyani, friedrice chillychicken etc. i guess you get my point.

Good location, good variety, good pricing, what is not to like in this restaurant near swimming pool? It has been also there for ages, only changed the address once. the indian options are very tasty. chicken tikka, kadai chicken, butter naan - they make it really good. the chinese is also too good. specially staples like chilli chicken and chicken hakka noodles. complete value for money. when we crave for fooding out without spending a thousand bucks, this place becomes obvious choice. The bengali options are not a hit though. Overall this is not in a high position in my list but i do not mind going back to this place as the food is good.

Had visited the place during the pujas with a few of my friends.
As most of the places around the area were severely crowded, we decided to have our lunch at Silver chimney, which has a bigger space as compared to the others and hence, was relatively less crowded.
Ambience is nice, simple like any typical restaurant, but not eye catching. So lets get down with the food.We ordered Chicken Reshmi Kebab,Tandoori roti,Chicken tikka butter masala and Kadai chicken.
Food arrived in 20mins.
The kebabs were good, though i have tasted better in other famed restaurants. The Chicken tikka butter masala was quite tasty and so were the tandoori rotis which were soft.The Kadai Chicken wasnt too good.. Since it lacked gravy we could not have it with our tandooris. A mediocre dish in my opinion.Finally the bill. We were charged a whooping amount of Rs1320 for the dishes. The price of the dishes were a lot higher than that shown here. Half a plate of  kadai chicken cost us around 330 bucks exclusive of tax!That was certainly overpriced for the food that we got.

Ambience is a very important factor in a restaurant. Honestly! It adds more taste to the food that you are paying for. I hated 'it' in here. 
Food was good but we got wallet f***ed in here . Tax and vat rates are unnecessarily high . I bet we can get better food at cheaper rates somewhere else . This was my first and last visit here. I m disappointed.

This place is among those in my list of restaurants where I wouldn't mind going again but would not be among my first choices when I plan to go out for dinner.
The first thing that I like about the place is its location.  This place is very nicely located and is not very difficult to find. The ambience is ok but can be much better. The hospitality is good and the food is great. However one of the things that bugged me is the time they usually take. I've been here twice and had ordered very commonly ordered dishes such as naan, a rice preparation, a paneer preparation and a chicken preparation, non of which normally take as long as they took to serve them. However the food tastes great and leaves little to complain about. Another thing that I've found to be a concern about the place is the mode of payment. This place accepts cards, as mentioned on the door, but they often find some difficulty with their machines and later ask for cash. On my first visit they had returned my credit card saying that they can't accept card payment due to some technical difficulties. I was lucky enough to be carrying some cash with me. On my second visit once again they said the same thing. This is something that has happened not only with me but quite a few of my friends who have been their. So I would highly recommend people to always keep some cash in hand before you visit this place.

The location of this place is good, service and ambience is soso. they take a quite long time to serve food. most pathetic part is maximum time they don't accept debit/credit cards though it is mentioned in door that they accept. 
Regarding food the chinese is better. norrmal preparations are fine. they have some offbit preparation like chilli wine or red cooked or sanghai fish/ chicken which are really good. also should try lat me kai chicken n pilu kabab. the quality of soup is also good.

Recently ordered food from "New Silver Chimney" for a colleague's farewell party. We made a takeaway order the previous evening as they told it would be easier for them to prepare the food for lunch.We ordered starters as Chicken Tikka, Chicken Irani kebab and the Bengali Dish "Bhetki Paturi". 

The Paturi was Awful with high salt and mustard content , and eventually it was all like gravy/juicy instad of being dry .It was a complete waste of money to order 4 plates of "Bhetki Paturi". We had to dump it in the dustbin as it was not eatable at all.I would recommend them to stop serving Bengali food. Its an absolute shame to prepare the famous bhetki paturi like this .However the North Indian starter are somewhat eatable.

Ordered Chicken Punjabi and Chicken bharta with Masala Kulcha in the main course, Chicken Punjabi was good and bharta wa just okay.I suggest the owners/proprietors to kindly maintain the food standard/quality as you are located in a prime location of food joints.I am not going to New Silver Chimney anymore.

I had visited this place earlier many years back and I had found the food to be good, especially the chilli chicken. Then a few months later I again visited this place with my parents and there was this smell that was lingering about that made us leave the restaurant. A couple of years later I was invited to this place by a friend for his birthday treat ( the place had been revamped and relocated to the opposite end of the street if i remember correctly) and the treat turned out to be good enough. Cannot say the decor turned me on or anything but I think it was just alright at that point. Of course it has been a few eyars sicne and I am not certain if the present decore or food quality has improved but then you can try this place if you are in the swimming pool are and are in the mood for experimentation.

It was my friend's birthday and we decided to eat out. The fact that most restaurants around this place were closed made us land into Silver Chimney.
When we entered, the inside looked decent like any other local restaurant in your para. We sat and made the order. 
Mixed Fried Rice, Red Curry Chicken and Manchurian Chicken. The order arrived quite late, almost after 15 mins.
We started digging in, and we were surprised to see the taste of the rice so bad. It was bland and lacked flavour and taste. The shreds of chicken were slightly raw and undercooked. The Manchurian Chicken was okayish, nothing spectacular about it. But the Red Curry Chicken was yum. But the quantity was less. In fact, very less. The Red Curry gravy was tasty, it had a sharp flavour and went well with the rice. 

But what shocked us was the bill. It came to around 2.2k for 6 people, and that by standard of food they serve is hugely over priced. Hence, don't visit this place even if you don't find another place, eat at home. Its worth it.

We ordered, Hyderabadi chicken, garlic naan and pan fried fish fillets, and availed the take away service.

1. Garlic naan: Tasted average , maybe because we took it home.

2. Hyderabadi chicken: Once again, a very average preparation. Overpriced. Not even properly cooked. 

3. Pan fried fish fillets: The worst of the lot, tasted so raw, and half cooked. I have never tasted something so bad coming out of the kitchen of a restaurant that looks  and feels decent. Never order this one.

Had it been a full blown only take away, id have rated it 5 for the food is delicuous! Yummy to the power of infinity. My favourite is their Irani kebab which is huge in size and has a blast of flavours. It melts in your mouth. Infact all their kebabs melt in your mouth. People dont know about it too much, but their kebabs are the best in Salt Lake. Juicy and soft. Their Hyderabadi chicken is brilliant as well, essentially a fancier take on the good old bharta. Their food reminds you od the nineties when good food meant richness. Yes, their foods rich, definitely not dieter friendly but definitely palate friendly. I havnt tried their thai or chinese options coz i can truly never get enough of thier Indian recipies. But their chef seems promising.

However their only downside is the decor. Its tacky. A bit run down. Service is decent, though. But when ur hungry, who cares? Value for money, Silver Chimney is a place is surely recommed any foodie.

It might  shock most Zomato foodies and fans to see my rating on this restaurant as a four on five, but let me tell you one thing, good food can come from anywhere... even from the most unexpected places on earth ! And there are certain restaurants like this where some of the dishes make your evening ! 
My general feeling about this restaurant in salt lake was not very good, but as i gathered the courage to discover this place, i realized that this place does serve good food. They introduced me to Chicken Pan fried noodles. Although now you might come across this dish in many oriental restaurants but the way these guys make it is nothing compared to the best in the city. Their Chicken or Mixed pan fried noodles is terrific! and one portion is perfect for one hearty meal. In case you are the hunter for quantity, then let me mention that this restaurant serves king size quantity.It is a bit on the expensive side for it's ambiance and decor. Perhaps the reason why people are not aware of this place is because of it's poor marketing which now i am contributing to with the help of Zomato. It is very easy to talk about restaurants that have already occupied a space in our heart and memory.. but as foodies and writers on Zomato, we should also try our bit to promote such small restaurants in these corners. Hope you like this food for thought ! 

Let me know soon ! And many thanks to all my Followers and the new ones too. I hope you like what i write, feel free to leave me a msg on my hotmail id. ( anamika91@hotmail.co.uk) 

till then , 
Keep eating ! :)

I've been here a few times, although my last visit was a few years back.  From my experience back then,  I'd say that the food is pretty decent. ...the service couldn't be complained about either. It's not too overpriced either, but I suppose Salt Lake does have better options than this place at the same price range.

This restaurant located in Swimming pool are of salt lake has good ambiance. The location is good and there the interior space is large and can accommodate a medium group. The menu and food is nothing exceptional. It is just normal menu and the food is good but nothing which can leave a mark on your mind. This restaurant is good for casual dining with standard food.

The restaurant, located in the swimming pool area of salt lake, firstly, buys itself an advantage due to the location as the area is a foodie's hub.

Silver Chimney has a decent staff, who are courteous and helpful. But, the service is a bit delayed.

The ambience is fine, too.

The food is good, quality and quantity wise, but tastes average, nothing great.

I feel the desserts are priced too much.

Good for small and casual eat-outs.

Several Restaurants, Several Cuisines.... People often get confused what to choose and what not to!!
No doubt that sometimes we too become choosy about various outlets inside & outside Kolkata but yesterday was the best choice I and my friends made which I want to share amongst all.

Friends, it's none other than Silver Chimney located at BF 97, Sector 1, Salt Lake, Kolkata. The nearest landmark to it is the Swimming Pool. After hovering around the same restaurants in Salt Lake I and my two friends decided to check this one. It's a well known restaurant with 5 more outlets in Kolkata. Silver Chimney, Salt Lake met our expectations very well. The ambiance inside the restaurant was cosy and comfortable for a small hangout or party with friends and family. It's centrally air conditioned and has a huge space to accommodate 50 or more.

Usually, every time before placing our order we sit with our mobile to calculate the expense but surprisingly as we opened the menu card offered by the waiter we were shocked. Guess what?? The prices were affordable and we did not have to think much about our pockets...
Some of us were addicted to Chinese and some to Indian so we mixed and matched our orders.
Starters like Chicken Drums of Heaven and Baby Corn Masala with Chicken Coriander Soup was awesome.

Then we ordered for the main course:Butter Naan,Kadai Paneer,Mixed Fried Rice and Lemon Chicken. The special Attraction in our menu was Pineapple Raita which we never tasted in any restaurants. The quality and quantity of the food were both acceptable, and less spicy which was fair enough. The only drawback was that the food ordered came very late. It took 30 mins approximately for the food to be served on our table which made us really hungry. Nevertheless, we were happy. Try it soon with your friends and family - Home Delivery is also available even if you cannot make time from your hectic schedule to visit it personally.

One of those where you can just drop by to have your lunch/dinner. The food and service is decent enough. Tried out the Bhetki Tandoori, in which they serve you amedium size whole bhetki fish baked in tandoor, tasted good.

Zomato is both, an inspiration and a guide to me. It guides me to the right hut in the city and inspires me at the same time to help other people by contributing my opinion.

Yesterday, I went to this place in Swimming Pool area of Salt Lake and visited the "Silvery Chimney" out there. With a nice welcome we seated ourselves at a table which was just beside an aquarium. So understandably lots of our chat revolved around underwater, fishes and of course 'Finding Nemo'. We ordered for a 'Chicken coriander soup' which tasted more like 'Dhaniya Chicken'. So, we repented and thought of ordering the conventional stuffs next time. The good thing was the 'Salt and Pepper Prawn'. It tasted extremely good. And the best thing was the dessert. As I am partial towards chocolaty stuff, we ordered for a 'fruit chocolate' which turned out to be a brilliant selection in the end. 

Overall a happy experience and will go with the saying 'All is well which ends well'.

I went to Silver Chimney some days back with a friend. We were looking for a place for dinner. Of all the places in the locality, we decided to go for Silver Chimney, because it looked nice from the outside. Let's have a try, I said.
As we entered, we were impressed with the the interiors. Nice ambiance with gloomy lightning for the entire hall but enough for each table. Each table was decorated with all table amenities. The staff was courteous but needed more professionalism. They should inform beforehand if the food is going to be delayed for more than 10 minutes, not when asked.
We ordered Mixed Manchow soup and Satay Chicken first. The soup arrived early- delicious and hot. But satay chicken took around 20 minutes to arrive. We were famished by the time it arrived. Better late than never. The long wait paid finally. It was the best satay chicken I ever tasted. Scrumptious, lovely looking and juicy. Then we ordered Kashmiri Pulao and Chicken Do Piaza. Pulao was not upto my mark. There were much much amounts of raisins and cashews. The Do Piaza was good but not great.
To me the value for money is a bit down considering the overall taste, unavailability of many dishes and slow service. Otherwise it's good place for the hungry bucks.
