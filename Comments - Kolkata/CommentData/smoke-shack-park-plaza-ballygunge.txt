This rating of 3 is solely because of the ambience..the pricing is exorbitant in this restaurant. Will not recommend this place if you want your money's worth. The service is really slow and the staff is not competent enough to handle high volume at the peak hours.. we were quite disappointed.

I wanted to visit Smoke Shack, since a long, long time having heard praises of its services, ambience and food, so finally when I had the chance, I was absolutely exhilarated.    
The ambience was ethereal on a winter evening. The cold breezes from the pool, added to the chill. The bar was well stocked and hospitality top notch. 
Our orders wear chicken teriyaki, which was cooked in the sizzler format and tasted heavenly. It was so sumptuous in quantity, that 2 of us couldn't finish it. The waiter took complete care of us and kept checking our necessities. The chicken Teriyaki was priced at 795+taxes. 
We also ordered flavored Smirnoff.

Visited this on the Christmas eve and had a very bad experience. We ordered jumbo prawns yakitori & Kolkata mutton biriyani. The most disappointing factor here is the food which is pathetic. There is nothing extraordinary about the ambience either its a simple sky lounge with bad music (dj). The staffs are not trained and they do not have proper knowledge about the dishes available there. We were shown a barbeque counter but when we enquired the staffs about the dishes there, the staffs were not able to share any info. We ordered biriyani and was not given a spoon rather was given a knife & a fork to eat that. The food items are extremely overpriced along with being distasteful. Also we were not given a proper table & chair to dine and felt really uncomfortable. We kept on insisting for several times to shift us to a better seat as many tables were empty but they did nothing about it and forced us to sit in an uncomfortable place. And while paying the bills the staffs charged me 2000 rs twice instead of charging just the extra amount. This 2000 was refunded to me after i questioned but such mistakes are unacceptable. Dont know whether charging 2000 extra was a mistake or purposely done but not expected from such 5 star hotels where a mere 60rs can of coke is charged Rs 350.

‚Ä¢Italian Smooch and Watermelon Mojito ~ the only things that was good.. 4/5
‚Ä¢Smoooke Shake Kebab Platter(non - veg) ~ Didn't like it at all.. 2/5
‚Ä¢Jumbo Prawn Yakitori ~ to be ture it was YAAK, worst I ever had.. 1/5
‚Ä¢Mutton Briyani ~ this was eatable but lacked flavours 3/5

Overall this place is not even worth a penny, cost of the food is sky rocking..
Only positive side of this place is the ambience, It is a roof top Restaurant so if you want to have some beer and glace the city you can give it a try or else not recommended..

Elaborately spread across the huge terrace, its a wonderful sky lounge in Kolkata. Perfect for a cozy evening, gossip, fun and experiencing the hugeness of the star studded sky.¬† We had ordered a good amount of food and loved the starters more than the main course. The serenity and panache of sky lounges appeal to me and I recommend it for people like me.

Visited a couple of times, but always thought something or the other is always missing from here. That is food! Yes, food is always missing. They dont have much options with food at this place. A couple of kebab platters, pasta and biryani. I wasn't very pleased with these scanty options for food.
Something I really liked about this place was that my friend happened to drop his glass of drink and the glass broke on falling. The place did not even charge for the glass breakage, and also did not charge for the drink that fell also. They simply replaced that drink. I mean it was full new glass of the drink, it fell and glass also broke. But they replaced it with a fresh one. I really appreciated this.
Although I must quote this to the readers of this review. Upon entering, we were asked if we were "Alcoholics" and I swear I shit you not, these were the exact words. "Good evening sir, I hope all of you are alcoholics as on the occasion of friendship day we are serving a complimentary round of shots." I mean really, of all the vocabulary problems he could have, he had to use the word "Alcoholic".Anyway, if the food variety would have been more, the review points would be higher. Thanks.

The seating arrangements and the open roof atmosphere are the one of the main reasons you should atleast visit this place once atleast.I did mention once cause of it's price.I don't think the price should be that hefty from my overall experience.But the wind blowing as you have your food(for which you do have to wait a bit) or when you dip your feet in the attached pool will make you feel the happiest.

The sundowner party was so perfectly organised by mr. Sudipto and mr. Shashwat. They are so friendly, cordial and cooperative...
The view is beautiful, the pool compliments the area and looks magestic at night. 
Dj and music... too good. 
Food awesome..
The kids had best of both.. even in this summer month of June, they had set up the place so well that kids were not feeling hot outside and were very comfortable. 
There was an AC room with music where the dj was playing, but the ambience outside was so beautiful and pleasant that everyone preferred being out. 
Great experience

This place is beautiful but very costly and not having much options for food. We decided to order lebanese mezze platter and crunchy chicken wings for starter. The platter was bland but the wings were awesome. For drinks we had ordered shirley temple, italian smooch and virgin blue lagoon and all of them were pretty good. Then for the main course we ordered grilled fish steak (which was not cooked that well and had the overpowering fishy smell) and chicken teriyaki (quite delicious). In the meanwhile they understood we were there to celebrate my birthday so they offered to bring a cake for us though it was a slice and that too of chocolate (I am that rare specie who hates chocolate :p ) the gesture was sweet. The dessert options are very limited (just 2) and we ordered both basbousa and new york cheesecake and honestly we didn't like either of them. I had wanted to visit this place for quite some time, so i was a bit disappointed but the rooftop is gorgeously decorated and the service is quite good.

You really need to tell your DJ to bring the volume down. They are screwing up our Sundays and wkends by playing the worst kind of music that can be heard through gariahat and beyond.

Pls don't make us have to call the police every time.

Plus I enjoy going to your hotel when the music is not drilling a hole in my ear. I especially enjoy the Asian food floor the best. It is calmer, peaceful and the food is great. As is the service. I usually recommend your rooms to my friends visiting from other cities. But the bar upstairs has been disappointing almost every time. I don't understand why you don't serve a simple beer post 11pm, yet you insist on serving expensive shots and such, and then throw people out once you get them drunk. This is not responsible alcohol serving protocol especially if there are women guests involved.

An earnest request to please turn your volume down on a regular basis. You do not have the right to shake the entire area with this terrible noise, that too all day sometimes.

Thanks to all the employees present there who gave us undivided attention.. Not just the ambience, but the food, the cocktails, the enviornment and most importantly the hospitality we received was beyond our expectations...

Went for my parents anniversary to smoke shack. Food and ambience was excellent, considering its a full smoking area. View is beautiful although it's a little to dark for my liking. We ordered the baked potatoes and chicken kababs for appetizers. The baked potatoes were spicy and tangy but the kababs were a bit dry. For dinner we all had different items ranging from spaghetti bolognaise to jamaican pork chops. Every single item was excellent in taste and quantity was more than what one person could eat.

Kudos to the bartender.. we started safe with a known one..long island ice tea which was amazing. Then we went for pinacolada and tequila sunrise. After which we asked them to serve their best cocktail and they gave us over n out and marnowshka. In food the choice is very limited. We ordered grilled fish steak. Over all it was a great experience and next time we go there we would ask them for the sitting arrangement facing the pool..

Food here is lip smacking good...
I was here on a date on our 6 months anniversary.
The ambience is really romantic. We ordered some dishes which eventually turned out to be really good. We went for Penne Pastas - one tossed in Alfredo and the other in classic Bolognaise. We went a sizzler... Some "Pan Seared Fresh River fish" ... I can't recall the complete name. One chicken teriyaki topped it all. On drinks she ordered a Virgin Mojito and me a Martini. The experience was splendid.
Would definitely come back.
A bit high priced... But for such food... We could spare some... Affordable at least!v

The cheesecake was super tasty, took me about a minute to finish itüç∞ The manager and the staff both were very friendly and nice.

Been there on Valentine's day. The food was awful and they were selling bits and pieces of food in the name of platter. The service was delayed, overpriced and had to wait for ages to get an order placed. Will think twice before going again

I went their to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. The place is really beautiful. It is really very romantic. Best place for a romantic dinner date with your special one. The food was good as well. Loved the Murg biryani, murg malai kabab, and afgani macchi and the mix grill sizzler. We tried different types of mocktails. Among all we liked Italian smooch and Orange virgin mojito the most. The cheesecake was super tasty, took me about a minute to finish itüç∞ The manager and the staff both were very friendly and nice. I used to go their before for parties but now I feel it's the best place for a romantic dinner. Would love to go again. Thanks smoke shack for making my special ones birthday so special‚ù§Ô∏è

The Ambiance is nice. Though nothing exceptional. However the location is pretty good as it is quite accessible, being near Pantaloons Gariahat. However one of the things that bothered me was the lack of varieties in the menu. There were hardly 15-20 items on the menu and that too all was included with the same category. Now coming on to the fooe, i ordered the Jamaican Pork Steak and The Kebab Platter. The Kebab platter was super super expensive considering what was served and the taste failed to impress me or my friend. However, the Pork Steak was good. Only the layer of fat was too much. Almost 1.5 inch thivk and 4-5inch long. The meat was seasoned well, but could've been a little more tender. Even though this is a rooftop restaurant, the view was far from being spectacular.

We had gone here on Valentine's day evening.
The place was beautifully decorated with balloons and candle lights and the pool beside was the icing to the cake.

The ambience was perfect except the music and the sluggish service.
There was a seperate v day menu and a couple entry charge of 2500/- had to be paid.
Of this,for 500/- we got two welcome drink & chocolate box.
Both the mocktail and cocktails tasted good but came in small shot glasses.
The rest 2000/- was redeemable on food.
We had the bbq platter which had fish,lamb,chicken and sausages.
The biryani platter had sufficient amount of biryani for two.
For dessert we had two beautiful strawberry and chocolate cheese cakes.The desserts tasted heavenly.
The biryani was overpriced but absolutely not worth it.
Lastly,we took a Virgin Pinacolada mocktail seperately.
The mocktail was love.
We got a cute chocolate box as promised.
It is certainly a beautiful date place but improvement of food quality is required.üòä

Being generous here by rating my experience with 1 star. You literally sell "fresh air" and charge a packet for it too because your food is inedible and your service is appalling! Your team were not even able to articulate what you had on offer. Very misleading marketing signs. If you bag up "fresh air" on that roof top and sell it to your guests, l think you'd do better commercially; as your attempt with serving decent food is a big flop! Shockingly horrific to say the least.

Iam totally disappointed with this hotel became a member and paid Rs 7500/- which was wasted .Food is overly priced and very limited menu .I came along with my family for dinner .We were 6.of us and were offered 50% discount on the billing for being a member but the menu was horrible and limited and after discount we paid 6300/- which was a shocking amount as there was only 2 non veg items  .its better you go to marriott and pay 1200 inclusive tax and have an array of dishes and desserts.My recommendation dont become a member and waste your hard earned money.

Well, ambiance is awesome and it's definitely the best rooftop food joint in the city as far as decor is concerned. Quality of food is also good, although slightly overpriced. I regret to say this, ¬†but service is absolutely horrible. Firstly,I reserved a table a long time before my visit but was given a middle seat despite asking for a corner seat during reservation. Secondly, no one served us properly. We had to ask for tissues more than thrice. Besides, had to wait for the bill for more than 15 minutes. The staff didn't even have the minimum courtesy to provide us a glass of water. This my most horrible staff experience ever. I believe courtesy of the staff is an essential factor that makes a place even better. So, I'll request the management to make a note of this and henceforth treat your guests with respect. And as far as food is concerned, we tried the non veg kebab platter and quality was good and tasty as well.

I am sorry to say that the service offered by this place is abysmal. The waiter mentioned that they take orders till 11.30 and we ordered 3 dishes at 11. We patiently waited for the order till 11.45, however to our surprise instead of getting the order the waiter came to our table with the bill. On inquiring about our order the waiter mentioned that he never took our order.This despite the order being confirmed the second time. This leads to to conclusions either the staff was stoned or the place sucks. In light of what happened with us I would like to believe both and I recommend you all to skip this place if at all you are thinking to visit it. Believe me it will be a big mistake and a waste of your time as you would have to come back without satiating your hunger. The waiter also mentioned that there is a party tomorrow and they would be closing down early and we felt as if that was an ultimatum. And if you tried to reason with them, you'll be in for a treat. The waiter offered us that we come day after tomorrow to have the same dishes. Hats off to the service. 

Still, we offered to pay by card and were told that they do not have the card machine on that floor. On being escorted to the ground floor we weren't surprised to find that their card machine wasn't working. 

Coming to this place was the biggest mistake and the deepest regret of my life

I have always wanted to go for a rooftop restaurant. Hence on my first marriage anniversary, my wife and I decided to plan a rooftop evening. This was the easiest option because of the location - Park plaza, behind Gariahat pantaloons.
On entering we were totally surprised by the look and feel. There was brightly lit swimming pool on one side and seating arrangements on the other. The atmosphere was very pleasant with music being played in the background at a decently low volume. 
The server Rahul treated us well with exceptional hospitality. He also had to maintain other tables but still managed to cater to everyone's needs. 
Food was good- we had nonveg platter and chicken pasta in white sauce. The mocktails were also decent.
Was a really pleasing visit and looking for many such visits.

But what is the point of such ambience if the sheesha smoke is hardly enjoyable cause of the wind and if the menu items lacks variety and is super costly ?

Only visit this place if I'm in a mood for a couple of drinks in such an ambience.

If you are looking for a romantic dinner date under the sky with the oppoortunity to enjoy the cool natural breeze along with a beautiful view of blue cooloured swimming pool then it's a perfect place situated at the 7th floor of park plaza hotel. 
The best part of the place is its ambience and the feel of the roof top from where you can have a beautiful view of the city of joy Kolkata.
We ordered sizzler which was not up to the mark. Portion was too less and tast was also not satisfactory apart from being high priced. Further their system was down so we had to wait also for our bill. As the lights are dim we had to use flash light of mobile to read the food menu.
My rating is based on the ambience and it's location and not for the food.

It's really grand and beautiful if you keep in mind the locality,  the ambience and the surroundings. 

However my first encounter with the place was during the Durga Pujas and as is the case with most places during the pujas, the standard of food had fallen drastically throughout the evening.  

The service was really good and my rating is basically based on the service and ambience.  Food wasn't upto the mark.  Will surely visit once again to get the best experience of this beautiful place.

A perfect setting in the middle of urban concrete that will help you relax and enjoy your evenings with friends and family. Smoke Shack, the new roof-top barbecue restaurant in the Park Plaza creates another dimension of eating out in the city. The setting of a terrace with live barbecue counters, an infinity pool and pleasurable music is a combination very few can resist. Add to that a full-fledged bar and internationally flavoured menu: Stuffed Sweet Peppers, Barbecued Corns, Barbecued Baked Potatoes, Pork Chops, Chicken Teriyaki, Tenderloin Steak, Salmon and Smoke Shack Kebab Platter, Tandoori Pomfret, Sarson Mahi Tikka, Tandoori Chicken from the Indian tandoor. This is surely going to make a wonderful winter choice!

Hidden behind the bylanes of Pantaloons Ballygunge, stands this gorgeous and beautiful Park Plaza Hotel.

Very recently, team #panchphoron was invited over a Cocktail and Sizzler Pairing session.

One of the hidden gem in the Gariahat area (beside the Pantaloons lane) located on the roof top of the hotel -Park Plaza. The lane to the hotel is quiet narrow, but it is an ultimate destination to go for a date. Ambience is too romantic. In terms of food, love the kebab platter that comes with all sorts of kebabs starting from chicken, fish. A perfect place to relax on a weekend eve. Pocket pinch is a bit high, but its worth visiting this place.

The greatest point in its favour is that it's a rooftop place, one of the few in the town. So ideal for a date. However the food is just about average, and so are the cocktails (highly diluted).

A sizzler is a dish which announces itself before arriving on your table. A good sizzler must first get the attention of your ears with a whizzing sound coming towards you as the kitchen door opens and closes behind the server. The aroma follows next which instantly makes your mouth water with the anticipation of what you are about to see .It looks irresistibly tempting, with impeccable presentation and finally comes the taste, where the meat is cooked to perfection, the vegetables are charred just right and the flavors are simply on point, making you want to polish off an entire sizzler by yourself. If this is your definition of the perfect sizzler, then you must visit Smoke Shack at the Park Plaza Ballygunj, Kolkata where chef Jayanta Banerjee is cooking up a storm for the ongoing Sizzler festival.
                                                                ...

A place with extremely beautiful ambience with open air rooftop view will surely blow you mind.Smoke Shack a open air restaurant which can only be described by these words ‚Äúabsolutely incredible‚Äù.i was mesmerized while i reached this place,located seventh floor of the Park Plaza,Ballygunge.this place has a lovely swimming pool,where you can rest yourself over an hookah or with drinks.not only that it is quite spacious,easily handle a huge crowd.a lovely bar section which was decorated with lovely lights.a perfect place for party over hookah,glass of cocktail or mocktail along with lovely lip-smacking foods.coming to the interior part it was classy as well as maintained very well.the best part was lovely music playing in the background.this is a perfect place for relaxing yourself or pass your quality time with your loved ones and with your friends.recently i was invited there by the management over a food tasting session with my fellow foodie friends.they organished a sizzler festival with cocktail where they introduced varities of veg and non-veg sizzlers along with different types of cocktails.we started our food tasting session with a glass of Virgin mojito which tastes really good and refreshing.

Went to this place on an auspicious occasion, my wife's birthday... got a very warm welcome, a poolside sitting arrangement....we were dumbstruck with the ambience,had a few drinks, food and smoke...thanks to our host srabani who arranged a luvely cake and candle to make the event more special, cocktails were excellent, food was very good, especially lamb and the kebab platter, fish could have been a little better...but above all I am awesomely satisfied to see that old sparkling smile on my wife's face which went amiss in our busy life schedule for quite sumtime... we have decided to visit this place more often to rejuvenate ourselves.. thanks smoke shack for gifting us a perfect evening!!!!

This is a hidden gem. For those that have been to New York where I live, the Shack evokes memories of cool views like the Standard rooftop with the vibes of 235 5th Ave bar. TriBeCa meets midtown. The drinks are standard but served with a lot of care by the bartenders who are quick to engage in conversation as well. Food is also awesome especially the grilled tandoori items. Finally and the reason I will remain a fan after having to rooftops in more than twenty cities around the world - outstanding and soulful service. Especially by the GM Sudipto and Shraboni. So go do yourself a favor and soak in joy in the city of joy...

I went this place last saturaday, though we made a table reservation but there was space available. The best part is the ambience, there are very less open restaurant ls in kolkata, tgis really feels the gap. It offers peaceful, enjoyable, romatic atmosphere. Now comes to food,they only offer drinks and starters however i found very less options available, they need to add few kore items in their menu. Excellent staff.

This place omg its like perfect. Pure example of perfection!!.
Food to drinks to ambience with decor, screening. . Pool side sitting arrangement, their staffs, presentation all for 10/10. Its all fab, you can't point on anything except going crazy and having a perfect date at a perfect place.. . 

This resturant is on the 7th floor of very famous hotel park plaza. Which is very easy to locate.

Full outdoor sitting as it a terrace based restaurant only. With perfect lightning, this place is so so famous for its crazy summer pool parties. They have a nice pool on the rooftop side, which gives this restaurant a different charm and suitable theme. 

When it comes to enjoy live sports screening then even its best, as i was there during 2016 ipl. It was like a privilege watching match their and having delicious food and drinks along.

With the drinks we have ordered for lebanese mezze platter, which was with hummus, pita bread, salad and two dips. Everything we ordered was tasty and perfect.
I enjoyed it to the fullest. Looking forward to visit again!!. Recommended!!!.. .. ..

After seeing Zomato's rating, we decided to visit this place. But I was highly disappointed by the service they offered. The waitress which was attending us, forgot to give us glass of water & menu card.  The food we ordered was not at all worth for the money. Plus they have limited items in the menu.

Smoke Shack is a great combination of night-life clubbed with beautiful ambiance and music but with pathetic service.

Location. Easy to locate. Right on top of Hotel Park Plaza.¬†
Ambiance. Electrifying. Though definitely not for summers or monsoons.¬†
Crowd. Gen Y

Food. Overtly disappointed. We had asked for hookah and the manager said that the person who prepares it was absent today, so there would be none. Disgusting. Shockingly, after around 30 minutes, we found that there was another couple who came in after us and were having a hookah. When asked, the manager said that the guy has now come and so ..... this is pathetic.
Also, we asked for pasta in white sauce. The guy never even asked if it was gonna be a veg or a non-veg one and served us one loaded with vegetables of the world.¬†
The Long Island Iced Tea was good but they had cheese-lings for munchies. When asked, the guy said that his stock of peanuts were over ... WOW !!!
And here is the best part. While leaving and boarding the lift, the manager came running and intruded us to inquire if we had paid the bill .... LOL ..

Value for Money. Absolutely not. If you consider the ambiance, it is. But apart from that, the service takes down everything. You've hired a bunch of unprofessional clowns to run this place. And with good joints coming up in Kolkata, you guys are just going down the drain. It's really just a smoky shack.

This is located just near the Gariahat Pantaloons, and about 10-15 minutes walk from Mukti World Ballygunge. So, the location is quite accessible.
This place redefines ambiance for me! One of the best places to be, if you want a soothing atmosphere with good privacy. It's basically a rooftop set up, and the tables and the decor around are quite good. The seats are pretty huge for small person like me, but that's just me. This place was just beautiful. 
We ordered pastas with mixed sauce, virgin mojito, and some nachos. The food was not really the best, and I have tasted much better mojitos at other places, but I'll surely visit this place for just one thing - AMBIANCE. That alone would let me give 4 stars for the place!

One of the most beautiful eateries in the city. The ambience, the food, the staff all are top notch. The perfect time to visit would be a breezy afternoon. Located on the 7th floor of park plaza near ballygunge this roof top offers the ultimate value for money. Alchohol and seesha are also availaible. You can also take a dip in the pool even. Not too pricey. Meal for two would be around 1.5k-2k.

This must be the first restaurant that I started to rate without even having my meal there. That itself must tell you what a bad idea it will be to have meal over there. Anyways, I have edited my feedback after having my meal there. 

Well, what's got my goat? I made several attempts (6 to be precise) to contact this restaurant, having purchase Groupon deal. It is easy to get through to the Park Plaza reception and then you ask them to connect to Smoke Shack. That's an ordeal. The reception tried 4 times in my case within a space of 1.5 hrs and in each case, she could not get me to speak with Smoke Shack staff. In her frustration, she gave me restaurant's managers direct mobile number, i tried that too, 2 times, the phone rang through but the manager did not pick up. I again contacted the reception, the lady took my name and number and told me that she will have somebody from Smoke Shack contact me in 5 minutes. For next 1 hour, no contacts made. After another call and 10 minutes later, I was contacted - a sigh of relief.

Anyways, since we had a good deal on Groupon and my family wanted to have Sizzlers, so we tried our luck and went in to the restaurant. The place was well done up, a beautiful setting for roof top. Seats are well laid out and a perfect setting for a lovely evening with friends as well as for romantic evening. May not be a great idea for family, as children are not allowed. We ordered two Veg Sizzlers and 1 non-Veg Sizzler for 4 adults. The quantity was so less that we were left hungry and actually went over to another cafe in Southern Avenue to finish our dinner. The taste was just about ok.

As I said, when the communication was a challenge the service would be pathetic. A few examples of that:

1) We ordered mocktails first and then ordered Sizzlers. Normally we expect the Mocktails to come before or with the Sizzlers. The mocktails arrived after we had finished our meals.

2. The time gap between arrival of veg Sizzlers and non- veg Sizzlers (literally timed on my Watch) was exactly 14 minutes. We had two options, either to finish Veg Sizzlers and let my son (who wanted the non-veg) watch us eat while he starved Or wait for his Sizzler to arrive. Like Good parents, we waited for Non-Veg Sizzler to arrive. Now, with 14 minutes in between, you can imagine what became of our Sizzlers!

3. As I had arrived, I said I wanted to speak with the restaurant manager. I was promptly told that he will be informed. The entire stay at Smoke Shack was around 1 hour. After we finished everything, I reminded the attendant that I am yet to meet the manager. He looked at me incredulously, as if he was expecting either I would forget or forgive after receiving incredible food and service. Anyways, reluctantly the manager came in, apologized for everything, thankfully.

God help the patrons.

Located on the 7th floor of the Park Plaza hotel. This is a lovely spot to organise private parties and events. I visited this place for the event Algorythm. The event was entertaining till 8 in the evening after which the dj got pretty boring the crowd started leaving.
The staff here is not friendly and causes a lot of fuss over petty issues. The prices of this place are high above the charts, which is justified since it is situated in Park Plaza.
Overall : A pretty awesome place for organisers and a pocket pincher for party people.
Complaint : The staff there is pretty dumb and conventional, they need an update to their job approach.

Smoke Shack is coming up as the ultimate romantic destination in Kolkata.. In a city devoid of classy open-air restaurants in a fine-dining setup, this place is indeed brings a fresh air.. The only other place which comes to my mind and can match to the aesthetic extravaganza is Blue and Beyond.. But this place do score with the fact that they provide a charming seating arrangement beside a pool and the entire South Kolkata skyline coupled with the lovely breeze makes it unparalleled..
Coming to the location, it is situated on top floor of Park Plaza Hotel, situated in the alley next to Gariahat Pantaloons.. What amazes me is the fact this place transports you to a different realm, far away from the hustles and bustles of the busy gariahat road beneath.. the beautiful decor, the couple couches, the candle-lights in the tables add to the romantic mood, making this place all more classy..If possible do visit this place during the dusk to catch a glimpse of the setting sun in the backdrop.. They also screen live matches during the EURO Cup adding to the delight.. Service is definitely the talking point, exceptional hospitality and supreme professionalism of the staffs will not let you a single scope to complain.. Based on the suggestions of the server, we ordered:
Murgh ke Sholay: Interesting name for a Chicken Tikka preparation.. loved the spicy marination and the right amount of charred meats.. spicy, tangy and literally fell apart with a strike of your fork..
Grilled Fish Steak: Well done steak in a lemon-buttery sauce accompanied with mashed potatoes and sauted veggies.. portion was sufficient for a twin-sharing and the presentation was just a treat for the eyes.. loved the fact that they used fresh Bekti fish and not the usual Basa.. even the presence of dijon mustard added a twist..
Fresh Lime Soda: Honestly you don't expect anything unique or out of the world from a glass of simple, naive fresh lime soda.. bt given the prices they charge, it was way over the top..
Malt Iced Tea: A variance of the Long Island Iced Tea, and the day's special..ordered on the server's recommendation.. The twist was supposed to be in the fact that they blend absinthe instead of the usual cola.. felt nothing extraordinary in taste.. gives almost similar kick the classical LIIT, not that long actually, adding to it charged 200/- more than a classical LIIT..
Overall, this place is all about the refined experience and reserved solely for the special occasions.. Remember whatever you consume it will burn a bigger hole in your purse.. Our total cheque for the 4 items was Rs.3225/- (all incl.)..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 3/5
Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5

Smoke Shack is coming up as the ultimate romantic destination in Kolkata.. In a city devoid of classy open-air restaurants in a fine-dining setup, this place is indeed brings a fresh air.. The only other place which comes to my mind and can match to the aesthetic extravaganza is Blue and Beyond.. But this place do score with the fact that they provide a charming seating arrangement beside a pool and the entire South Kolkata skyline coupled with the lovely breeze makes it unparalleled..
Coming to the location, it is situated on top floor of Park Plaza Hotel, situated in the alley next to Gariahat Pantaloons.. What amazes me is the fact this place transports you to a different realm, far away from the hustles and bustles of the busy gariahat road beneath.. the beautiful decor, the couple couches, the candle-lights in the tables add to the romantic mood, making this place all more classy..If possible do visit this place during the dusk to catch a glimpse of the setting sun in the backdrop.. They also screen live matches during the EURO Cup adding to the delight.. Service is definitely the talking point, exceptional hospitality and supreme professionalism of the staffs will not let you a single scope to complain.. Based on the suggestions of the server, we ordered:
Murgh ke Sholay: Interesting name for a Chicken Tikka preparation.. loved the spicy marination and the right amount of charred meats.. spicy, tangy and literally fell apart with a strike of your fork..
Grilled Fish Steak: Well done steak in a lemon-buttery sauce accompanied with mashed potatoes and sauted veggies.. portion was sufficient for a twin-sharing and the presentation was just a treat for the eyes.. loved the fact that they used fresh Bekti fish and not the usual Basa.. even the presence of dijon mustard added a twist..
Fresh Lime Soda: Honestly you don't expect anything unique or out of the world from a glass of simple, naive fresh lime soda.. bt given the prices they charge, it was way over the top..
Malt Iced Tea: A variance of the Long Island Iced Tea, and the day's special..ordered on the server's recommendation.. The twist was supposed to be in the fact that they blend absinthe instead of the usual cola.. felt nothing extraordinary in taste.. gives almost similar kick the classical LIIT, not that long actually, adding to it charged 200/- more than a classical LIIT..
Overall, this place is all about the refined experience and reserved solely for the special occasions.. Remember whatever you consume it will burn a bigger hole in your purse.. Our total cheque for the 4 items was Rs.3225/- (all incl.)..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 3/5
Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5

Can be a little difficult to locate if you are not familiar with the locality. The approach road is a little disappointing. However, once you enter the place, you will realise that it was all worth the effort. Open air, pool side with dim lights - this place scores 100% on ambience. The options in the menu were limited and not everything listed in the menu was available. This is the only thing that could have been better. Service was excellent. On a rainy day, they will make you sit indoors and that section is not as exciting and interesting as the outdoor seating. Pricing is little on the higher side but worth the ambience and the service. Definitely worth a visit!

Smoke-Shack is a lounge bar on the 7th. floor of the hotel Park Plaza. This hotel is located in the road which goes beside the Gariahat Pantaloons showroom. When you get out of the lift on the 7th. floor you are transported to another world. You forget that you are in the busy Gariahat area. The blue waters of the swimming pool there beckons you invitingly to escape the heat. It's almost like an infinity pool. The evening skyline with the buildings are a breathtaking sight. The bar area too looks great with the elevated light. They also have a separate dance floor section with a DJ where you can indulge your fancy for shaking a leg with frnds. Since it is a lounge bar they concentrate on drinks and snacks food items.( Good). For a full fledged dinner you have to go to one of their other restaurants. But they do have a few items which are filling and also biryani ( which was enough for dinner) They also have pastas( which too are filling). A wonderful place to go unwind and relax with frnds.

Location: The nearest land mark to Smoke Shack would be Gariahat Pantaloons. It is located on the seventh floor of Park Plaza hotel.

Setting: Smoke Shack is a rooftop restaurant cum lounge. It comes with a large swimming pool with a view of the city and a small jacuzzi. Neatly maintained and is very spacious. Smoke Shack is entirely booked, mostly on weekends for events and private parties. The dance floor is absolutely huge. The food here is spot on.

Management: the staff are not too welcoming or warm unless you are a known figure. There is obviously a bit of crowd profiling. The bouncers make an issue with entries and guest lists. But I would have to say that Smoke Shack is one of the best party scenes that is happening in Kolkata right now, and it deserves a 4.5!

What is the first word¬†that comes to your mind when you hear the word Shack? I bet 80% of you will say Goa. Right? And then if you are not from Goa, you will go on to say how you miss the shacks, the food, the drinks, the beach, the sunrise, sunset and the ambience. Well, if you are in Kolkata, you can enjoy a near similar shack experience (minus the sea and sand of course) at Smoke Shack, the rooftop bar at Hotel Park Plaza.

The ambience of this place is just breathtaking once the sun sets!
I love the dim lit tables and the pool by the side. 
Service is a bit slow, but worth the wait. 
It's a place to go to after a long day of work or with your guy/girl for a date.

It was a terrible as well as pathetic experience for us at Smoke Shack during the recent sundowner party on Saturday evening. The ambience is superb, no doubt about that. The pool is also very nice, though it was restricted on that day. Music was ok. The most disgusting part was availability of drinks. The staff was not much responsive and lacked the basic courtesy. We were told by the bartender that breezers were available for ladies. We had to buy coupon of 1000/- and after going back to the counter, we were told only VAT 69 and smrinoff vodka were available. Why is that?? Why lie to your customers? We did not want to spoil our mood, so we coped up with the drinks. The worst part is that, a 100/- coupon was finally remaining with us and went to the return that and what we heard? NO REFUND! so 100 bucks for a piece of paper (bcoz nothing else was available for 100 bucks, pretty obviously). ¬†Ok, not visiting this place ever again.

Located on the 7th floor of Smoke Shack, this rooftop restaurant has a breathtaking ambience. Plush seats, colorfully lit surroundings, live dj combined with great food and killer cocktails and hookah...makes it the perfect venue for a dreamy dinner. We were given an IPL special cocktail menu from which we ordered Kolkata Classic and Punjabian Di Shaan, both well mixed and tasted superb. Our dinner was an extravagant spread of non-vegetarian tandoor platter, chicken teriyaki, jamaican pork chops, lamb cutlet with rosemary and lemon. And I have to say the pork chops and the lamb cutlet simply tantalised our taste buds!! The pork meat was well cooked and soft and had properly soaked up the sauce, so it was dry and fibrous on the inside( which you find in most restaurants). The lamb chops had a rich filling and just melted in our mouths!! The chicken teriyaki was a sizzler and marinated and grilled with the right amount of spices and vegetables. However, a restaurant like this with only two dessert options and also one of them not available at the time- a big thumbs down for that!! Other than that, it's truly something else spending a lavish evening here with closed ones under a moonlight sky sipping cocktails and forgetting the banality of everyday life!!

This place is all about hookah,,, drinks nd a well-spread menu,,, not to mention the fabulous view... There‚Äôs nothing we love more than a good barbecue dinner on a winter evening,,, nd this rooftop diner understands that perfectly.... Spread across a massive 8,000 sq ft,,, the eatery features a central backlit bar counter nd a giant screen to sit back nd enjoy a match.... The multicuisine menu has a wide selection of Lebanese, Italian nd North-West Frontier dishes, nd my top picks include the¬†Char Grilled Mountain Herbed Salmon,¬†Gilafi Seekh Kebab nd¬†Barbeque Chicken Salad.... Wash down all the food with a tangy cocktail of Brazil‚Äôs favourite Cachaca mixed with Spicy Guava, Mango nd Melon among others......

Went on a quite Wednesday evening to watch IPL screening. Excellent rooftop place for a drink. A lot more spacious than blue and beyond and hence gives premium feel. Food is a bit on the expensive side. People dancing Salsa on wednesday made it even better. Nice comfortable seating and a small swimming pool add to the charm.

It is a place where you can sit and have a lovely time with your loved ones. ¬†I did the same. I went with my fianc√© and we spent a wonderful time together. Though the time got interrupted by sudden rainfall. Still we enjoyed a lot. As per ambiance is concerned it is perfect. Open bar and poolside are the most eye catching factor which added flavor to the place. The place is expensive.
Over there we met a lady name M/s. Sarbani, she is a team member of that place. We just loved her greetings and friendly nature throughout. Overall it was good.

I went to smoke shack on a weekday (Wednesday) with 3 of my friends. The place was beautiful and the open air section factor made it even better. The pool side place was sublime with neon blue lights. We ordered some alchohol, a sheesha, starters and main course.
Although the food tasted good, the options were extremely limited. Whatever we wanted to order (from the menu) wasn't available. All they had was 3-4 veg and non veg starters from which we had to choose. In the main course they had only pastas and biryanis (two completely different cuisines). Plus the service was too slow and the staffs were not much responsive.
Overall, considering the place is moderately highly priced, the experience was fine but not great.

I tried a salad and a glass of coke. Salad was good. What I liked about this place is, it is on the roof top with dim lights in evening, good music and cool breeze. It has a rooftop swimming pool which I found beautiful as I was passing by it. I liked the ambience and the service. Cheers.

The ambience will literally take your breath away. The Kolkata skyline  the open air ambience, the pools the bar counter right in the centre... Ideal for a romantic date. Visited this place for an after dinner drinks party and my entire family had a blast.Absolutely courteous and polite service and the way the staff took care of my clan with a smiling face speaks volumes about their hospitality.Special mention must be made of Mr.Rajat who whipped up some amazing concoctions which gave us a real high. Do ask him for his bourbon ice tea or if you're feeling daring go for the flaming suicide flambe.. Which is absolutely amazing..apart from this the other shots were out of the world and was appreciated by one and all.On behalf of my entire family I would like to thank the entire team for giving us such a memorable night which we'll cherish forever. 
P.S. Didn't have anything to eat as such cause we were already full after dinner. So keeping 1 point in reserve till I get a taste of their food.Keep on the good work guys.

Four of us were there last evening. My two points for the spaciousness of it but that's about all. The design of the bar, in one word, is simply unimaginative ‚Äî it has so much potential to stand out from the rest but alas! The ambience could have been much better too with the right kind of music and with better use of lighting. There are so many little things that could be improved on with a little thinking and by applying some common sense ‚Äî for example providing column/outdoor gas heaters for the customers in winter season, getting rid of some of the furniture which do not look modern or not in sync with the existing modern furniture, there is a swimming pool but I didn't notice any precautionary signs around it for the guests neither there is proper lighting around the pool after dark; it's an accident just waiting to happen!

The bar pricing is atrocious. We had 19 small (30 ml) pegs of Indian whiskey and apparently 11 small pegs of black dog whiskey (highly suss because none of us were counting) with some finger foods i.e. 2-3 plates of chicken and fish. They handed us a bill of Rs. 14,888 (inclusive of all taxes). So if I deduct the average price of the food then a 30 ml peg of (not so fancy) whiskey costs around Rs 461 ‚Äî my personal opinion is that they will go out of business in a couple of years if they didn't do anything about the pricing and stopped being competitive but I've come here for a holiday from a different world so I might well be wrong - you be the judge!

TL;DR - A very good place to spend a romantic evening or just some quality time with friends. Ambience is excellent and so are the drinks and hookah. Food is expensive, and also not that great.

So I went there yesterday night to spend a nice evening on recommendation of a friend, and the place didn't disappoint!
The ambience of the place is just fantastic! A beautifully lit roof top with properly spaced seatings....you can choose to dine on chairs, recliner chairs and bar! Candles lit on tables and the good music playing just set the mood for a spectacular evening! 5/5 for ambience!

The service also was really good. The staff was kind and courteous, not intrusive and helped out with the menus as well. Drinks and food didn't take too little or too long to come. Perhaps it being a weekday night and hence less crowd may have improved the service, but I really loved it! I'd give 5/5 for service as well.

Food was the disappointing part. I found it too expensive for the quality and quantity served. We were just two, and we had ordered just two dishes - Cheese Chilly Nachos and Murg ke Shole - and both were disappointing. 2.5/5 for food. I really hope they improve of the food side to improve the overall customer satisfaction.

I'm looking forward to visiting it again on a weekend the next time. Overall it is a great place! Although it is one of those slightly-heavy-on-the-pocket places, it is worth it! Do try it out! :-)

if you want a perfect combination of - Rooftop + Outdoor seating + Romantic ambience + Privacy --> this is the place !!

Great place for a date, with cozy/comfy seating arrangements. Hookah is an added bonus.

The food is good too. Service is good, without being intrusive. (Again, from the perspective of having a romantic evening)

A bit on the higher side in terms of pocket pinch, but then again we are talking about an in-house place within a star hotel.

Best time to go --> Wintry Evenings !!

It has also got a swimming pool which makes the place even better.Food here is also decent enough..hookahs are what for which I come to this place most of the time. Hookahs are good but a bit pricey also.Overally a very good place to hang out with friends and close ones.

Staff is not attentive. We even had to wait long for a glass of water.
Nothing much to eat in the menu. 
Over priced too.
Bhune Paneer ki boti which is basically paneer tikka was not grilled properly and the paneer didn't soak any flavour. Fried Smoked Cheese Rolls were good .
If you want to spend a lot of time on a rooftop you should try this place.

Smoke shack is a nice place in the ballygaunge area. Rooftop restaurant and pool Beside. They were showcasing ISL match by projector and decent crowd was there. 
Took beers with shisha. Both were pretty good. Ambience was nice and  service was as expected. The only problem with this restaurant is the food menu is limited. Could have added some pizzas or pastas which goes very well with smoke shacks. Price was over the top. That a deterring fact for the restaurant. 
Overall a good experience and deserves a one time visit.

For a long time Smoke Shack ambience attracted me and finally i made it there with my gang of friends! It's a rooftop seating on the 7th floor of Park Plaza building. The very concept of rooftop and a swimming pool and jacuzzi attached to it are no doubt the main cravings of the visitors :) Of course it's not much of a filling place but if you go there for the ambience then it's sure to impress you! We sat over Hookahs(Mint and Pan flavour) and their Do Rookhe Khumbh dish, and the food was definitely extraordinary in taste but the place is too overpriced! They also have a wide projector for live screening and surely the lounge has got a feel good factor overall :)

Kolkata does not have too many rooftop hangouts and apart from Blue and Beyond and Afraa, Smoke Shack is perhaps the only place which gives you a lovely 7th floor open terrace, beautifully done with dim lights and comfortable seating and teamed with a giant screen and nice music. The guys were cordial and although the place is known for kebabs, I decided to try their continental by ordering a grilled fish steak and barbequed potatoes. I was enjoying my fish with sauted veggies until a couple of big fish bones landed into my mouth making the entire eating experience bitter. I am an ardent fish lover and equally paranoid about fish bones. I have never had such a horrendous experience before and had to leave my food right there. Although the barbequed potatoes weren't bad, my overall experience has been quite marred.

I hate writing bad reviews.....
I fell in love with this place instantly however it failed to impress beyond a point , thereby proving yet again that , all that glitters ain't Gold.....
Great location (a rooftop) lovely ambiance, as you can see in the pictures but the food was a far cry from being good... what made matters worse was the hefty bill that one ended up paying. ..... Avoidable .

Water melon mojito 6/10
Orange mojito 7/10
Cheesy Nachos 5/10
Chicken Teriyaki grill 5/10
Grilled fish (with bones) 4/10

Yes you read it right, the fish fillets had fine bones in them and I nearly ended up choking myself.... to which the server replied , I have never seen this happen before..... when asked for some bread , he gave us a raw garlic bread heated in a microwave ..... to add insult to injury. Fine dinning went down the drain... oops I nearly forgot , the asparagus was served without proper cleaning....
I had a horrible experience.
Now comes the crunch. I would like the management to take note of my review and work towards making things better.... I too run a restaurant and I know it's very difficult to make everyone happy all the time.... I'd like to give this place another chance but at the moment I am at a distant planet from that.

Service 6/10
Tried to make things better by offering a 10% discount &;the bread... I almost forgot.
Park Plaza ... wake up....

Met the F&B manager , Mr. Anukam Tiwari,  who doubles up as the Deputy Manager of the Hotel. He was very open to suggestions and went around most humbly and honestly about enquiring about my bad experience at Smoke Shack.  I'll love to vist the place again.... maybe tonight maybe on my next visit.... I am sure they will only improve from here on...
I wish them luck.

They have a nice atmosphere with pool on the side with shiny ball lamps, open views 
They even have a small inner hall for private parties , although it cannot hold a lot of people
Food is a big complaint with the hotel in general
Since I have also stayed here I can say that
Rooms are decent but food is not

A moony romantic place - Park Plaza's (just behind pantaloons) rooftop that plays soft music, so you can keep the conversations going. Can get slightly uncomfortable on sultry days, so choose this place preferably during winters. Portions are small and the food amazing - and hence it vanishes off the plate faster than you can imagine.

A lot written and a lot said. Now let me just go straight to the business end. Had an informal get together with the senior management team from my work place. Dhiren Tiwary, Pudhpendu Kayal along with my ex colleague Chef Amitabh ensured a wonderful evening for us. 

The food, yes it has definitely room for improvement. Some of the dishes like the chilli chicken, well doesn't belong in an outlet like this. The penne carbonara was sublime and exactly how I like it.

The drinks, well Pushpendu ensured that he kept us interested with innovative cocktails.

All in all, good team running the show. The destination should also become a foodie's destination.

The prices at this place is sky high. They've been accommodated in park plaza hotel's rooftop. Awesome ambience. Awesome pool. Awesome decor. But on the other hand food and service is not that great. It is highly expected from a place which charges gigantic sums for a meal. The staff is semi - courteous. I gave the extra .5 fr the ambience.

The worst lounge restaurant I have been 

The ambience is good but other than that there is nothing that is good 

I tried some cottage cheese steak ,to my worst nightmare they have green chillies in the cottage cheese steak 

Then they replaced with some glazed pesto vegetable again to my nightmare there no touch of pesto as the name suggest instead it was with grilled with soya sauce 

The worst food ever served 

On any suggestion they respond that the taste is indianised .ohh my gosh even i am Indian 

Pathetic place for decent food !!!

I understand u people hav opend up in park plaza hotel situated at ballygunge. Doesnt mean rates need to shoot sky high without deserving the same. Ambience is good but only by the pool side kindof seating. Othrrwise its normal tabl chairs on a terrace wch is pretty boring. On ocassions the pool side is seperately chargbl as well wch is the biggest turn off. Food isnt that grt. Hookah being good, it is okok ryt nw.

You have to give this place 5 stars simply for its fantabulous ambience. Food is on the constlier side but that is worth the place.
We had mocktails, pork chops and special pan flavoured hooka. All were better than the best (at least as per my experience). Highly recommend to all.

I have been a guest at this particular Park Plaza thrice and once I decided to rather visit their restaurants than order room service. Located at Ballygunge besides the Pantaloons, this is one of the more reputed chains in the world but here in Kolkata their location is a bit tacky since you discover it only by entering the narrow side lane.
Coming to the restaurant, this is located on its top floor which is quite high. The ambiance is fantastic since you get to see the skyline of Ballygunge from here. A late evening visit to this place will leave you spellbound. The tables are laid out perfectly and the staff is more than cordial to the guests. Shame it was a dry day since I couldn't have any drinks for myself there.
I had ordered a Baby Bhetki and it was fabulous, if not pocket friendly. The mocktails they had were equally good. It was a good experience and I savored every moment spent.
When in Kolkata, I would love to give this place a visit!

The place is nicely decorated with awesome food. Got a nice reception by the manager. Waiters are very good in communication and helped us to choose the best we can have there. It was my wife's birthday, they provided us with a complementary cake. To add on to that the pool side open air view is just cherry on top of a beautifully build cake. I would like to visit again to this place.

NOTE: THIS REVIEW ONLY FOR THIS SPECIFIC OUTLET AND FULLY ON MY OWN EXPERIENCE. 

location : Ballygunge, just 2 mint 4m pantaloons. Beside rajbari complex
Parking: available
Stuff: 3.5/5
Cleanness : 3.6/5
Food quality : 4/5
Food availability : veg n nonveg both
Hukkha : available

I personally love open and rooftop restaurants, awsome view 4m roof, lil expensive, trust me worth it, just for its location and ambience , may u get bettr food, n quantity to any other place but u wont get such environment. Tempting pool, n awsm music will make you dance for sure!
Do visit tht place, wen evr u get free..

This is one place that one will like to visit time again and is the only place in kolkata apart from a five star hotel that offers you outdoor seating with drinks on a rooftop.The ambience can be said is one of a kind as well is the service out here.Regarding the food all that can be said is that it is really very good.The tendoloin steak is really something to look out for here.The other dishes are really unique and altogether it makes an unforgettable visit here.

Smoke Shack...
One of the coolest lounge in Kolkata...
People these days are more attracted towards the ambience of the place.Everyone is in search of a place where you can chill out with your friends with hookah and cool breeze and a pool side atmosphere...
I am personally a big fan of a place which is open 
and is in roof top..There are very few such places in kolkata which are open,one of my personal favourite is smoke shack ..i was bowled out by the atmoshphere of smoke shack when i first visited this place It is located in the 7th floor of the Park plaza hotel in Garcha Road near Pantaloons Gariahat..
The seating arrangements of this place is too good..they have couches and they have beds and the best part is they have a small pool which looks damn sexy and give an amazing view where one can chill and have a great time with their friends...The place has a big projector screen for watching cricket matches...

The weather during the evening and in winters is superb.One feel really relaxed because of the lovely ambience...

The food out here is not that great but the lovely ambience makes up for everything...

So if you are looking for a place where you wanna chill out with your friends and sit comfortably and have an amazing tym visit SMOKE SHACK..
Its AWESOMEüòÉüòÑüòÄ

I decided to visit this place purely because of its open air outdoor setting. My wife and I were here nice and early. I must say that the ambiance was how I thought it would be much to our delight. Minimal lighting with a small dip pool right next to our table.  The problem with the place is the Food. We had ordered for a lobster among other items. While kababs were okayish, the lobster was not worth it. Which kind of spoilt the evening for us a bit. Go there for the Ambiance and avoid the lobster for sure.

One of the great Rooftop experience is your Smoke Shack. The DJ was good and his collection of songs got us grooving every single number. Rain was the cherry on top of this experience. It just made the evening more fun as we hit the dance floor inside. Food and drinks are nothing that set this place apart. The staff were very courteous and as the dance floor flooded with people coming in due to rain they responded very elegantly to all the orders and setting up the place for customers

The moment you step in, Ah! Beauty..
It's a roof top dining and bar. You have these romantic lit tables. Comfortable and elite it is with very good service. Food was nice and subtle and music was an add on. Drinks were fine.
The only problem was the table, too small to accommodate your main course. Else it will surely insist me to be coming back to it !

The food is also good...but yes a wee bit expensive .The decor of the place is very plush,with a swanky infinity swimming pool to brighten up things. The staff is very well behaved and coordinating. All in all I had a very nice experience and would definitely suggest everyone to try out this place...m sure u will have a great time.

Well..to start of with, this is one of its kind in Calcutta... A great ambience on the roof top of Park Plaza.. One can get a lovely view of the city... Also there is a pool which is actually pleasant n soothing for your eyes!!! And if you r looking out for some space to shake ur boots, then there's a separate lounge where DJ is busy spinning tracks!! The only downside of this place is the Price... Its a bit on the higher side.. But the service n ambience one would get, its worth paying every single penny...

If only the prices could be dialled down a little and service made a little more efficient, Smoke Shack could be the best place in the town for a relaxed rooftop candle lit dinner. Its on the seventh floor of Park Plaza, behind Gariahat Pantaloons and next to Mirch Masala. On a breezy night, the place is irresistible. Very spacious and stylish, you feel like sitting there for hours with a chilled beer. An irony, because orders take hours to be delivered. Hookah is expensive but good. Tried the Brain Freezer with Red Bull base. Veg options are limited but you get all the liquor in the menu, not all of which might be available at all times. Super thumbs up for the ambience. For special occasions only.

Smoke shack, is the roof top lounge/bar situated at Park Plaza ( behind gariahat pantaloons). Amazing ambience by the pool and with lights just perfect to set your mood right. To add to that you have Ftv on aided by a projector.
This place is for hookah lovers! The bar menu is exhaustive. We ordered a non veg platter.To be fair it wasnt that great compared to the price.Quantity was sufficient though but the choice of kebabs did not leave a good impression! Its the ambience that would draw you to this place.
Lil heavy on the pocket but a place you can definitely visit after a long hectic day at work. My brownie points will be for hookah and probably cocktails!

"Sit back, relax and enjoy" that's the theme here. Nothing can beat the beauty of an open sky! Add to that a very commendable BAR menu and a trained bartender. One of the few places that serve cheese platter. what else do you want. Food is good especially the paprika flavoured prawn, lamb shanks, bekti in lemon butter sauce. There is a kebab platter which is good value for money. However if you are hungry and in look out for a gala dinner, probably this is not your place. These People really know the wine and also how to serve em. Every visit of mine, I find this place extremely rejuvenating, as if I have visited a spa.

One word. Disheartening. If you are a person who checked it out on zomato and then went ahead to have some steak or smoked salmon (since the name is very suggestive), then the experience would be same as going to watch Aamir Khan's Mangal Pandey in theatres. The food menu is as small as a regular flight boarding pass. Not exaggerating folks! The only thing good is the ambience. The roof top setting and pool by the side looks dapper. My order was nacho, which wasn't crunchy and had cheese and coriander leaves spread randomly over them. Why? How can some one screw something as basic as nachos? All in all, if all you look forward to is hookah, dim or no light to do whatever fancies you and excellent view, then Smoke Shack may qualify as your destination. Anyway, can't complain. :)

If you are a foodie, please stay as far away from this place as possible.First of zomato needs to change its listing from European to hookah or bar. I checked the ratings n menu n turned up here only to ve absolutely dissapointed. Granted that the ambiance is really nice but its food menu is just 1 page n drinks menu another 1 page. Thats it. That is all the option you get. We ordered 2 long Island iced tea and nachos.  The drink was ok but the nachos!!! Omg how difficult can it be to nail nachos. It was terrible. I felt like I was having mad angle with less salt. And the bill was skyhigh. 2 drinks n nachos cost us more than 3k! We had to scurry away as soon as possible.

Beautiful ambience on the roof top with great decor and seatings. But this does not run a place. Extremely unprofessional service.

Calcutta skyline is not even a shade close to  the great cities of the world. The glass enclosed architectural marvels that we see in Dubai or even Mumbai have not made its mark here. The largely middle class dominated city is forced, by economic constraints perhaps, to ignore the ravages of nature on its buildings. The multistoried creations rise, as if vieing for attention, riding on the backs and supporting on the shoulders of the older, dwarfer dwellings. So, when I heard that this Place advertised the open bar as it's usp,  it was with a bit apprehension that I chose to visit the Place. My apprehensions however seemed unnecessary for I soon fell into a sort of calm as I sat there, under the open starlit Kolkata sky and admiring the mystical effect that semi darkness seemed to have provided to the surroundings around. The open space is excellent for an adda session replete with drinks and smoke. My only apprehension would be the absence of air conditioning during those hot sultry evenings of Kolkata when even the slightest wisp of breeze plays truant. 
I really loved the place, not only for its ambience but also for its food- the chicken teppanyaki preparation being really lip-smacking. 
The service needs a bit of improvement, the food seems to get inordinately delayed in being served. But then one shouldn't mind that too much; the place is meant for those "hurried" souls who wish to let nature take over and soothe those frayed nerves.

Beautiful ambience on the roof top with great decor and seatings. But this does not run a place. Extremely unprofessional service. The food was YUM...but the service was "we dont bother whether u come to us again or not". Potential of this place is huge..if proper Administration and Management review is done.

Calcutta skyline is not even a shade close to  the great cities of the world. The glass enclosed architectural marvels that we see in Dubai or even Mumbai have not made its mark here. The largely middle class dominated city is forced, by economic constraints perhaps, to ignore the ravages of nature on its buildings. The multistoried creations rise, as if vieing for attention, riding on the backs and supporting on the shoulders of the older, dwarfer dwellings. So, when I heard that this Place advertised the open bar as it's usp,  it was with a bit apprehension that I chose to visit the Place. My apprehensions however seemed unnecessary for I soon fell into a sort of calm as I sat there, under the open starlit Kolkata sky and admiring the mystical effect that semi darkness seemed to have provided to the surroundings around. The open space is excellent for an adda session replete with drinks and smoke. My only apprehension would be the absence of air conditioning during those hot sultry evenings of Kolkata when even the slightest wisp of breeze plays truant. 
I really loved the place, not only for its ambience but also for its food- the chicken teppanyaki preparation being really lip-smacking. 
The service needs a bit of improvement, the food seems to get inordinately delayed in being served. But then one shouldn't mind that too much; the place is meant for those "hurried" souls who wish to let nature take over and soothe those frayed nerves.

Firstly, although officially Smoke Shack is supposedly open from 3pm on weekends, the waiters deny the fact and claim that the chef will come later and so they can only serve after 4.30. Well, then don't open your doors before you're ready!
 Secondly, we ordered the Veg platter knowing that it was the one good veg option. we were handed a plate which had all the kebabs as mentioned, but our server knew nothing about the daal and roti, and was sure, that that was all that the dish contained. Later when we asked him to confirm, he sent a senior waiter who said "well yes if you want it we can serve the accompaniments to you..and anyway people dont want to have daal in the evening so we dont serve it"
Really? Never heard of north indian for dinner?

This is absolutely ridiculous as the waiters are supposed to offer and properly tell the customer what the dish includes. Luckily I had read reviews on zomato to know that we were being fooled, or else I would have ended up paying Rs. 750 for a couple of kebabs that were not even tasty.
Third, the tables don't have napkins which is again extremely silly. 
Fourth, Ambience is good but its not enough to make up for simple things that every place needs, especially ones like Smoke Shack, which look awesome but our actually not.

The atmosphere at this place is the only thing why I am giving it a 3.0. On the downside, it is definitely not worth the whopping price listings on the menu.
I mean, a certain chunk of Afraa is similar to this place and still isn't ¬†as expensive.

I didn't quite go here with any expectations but except for the visual delight, this place had nothing much to offer. The hookah was blandish and choked quite a few times. The beer was the only good thing about the place (but, well, unless they are brewing it, I am not giving any points to them).

I did like the place for once. Something new and different. But after the initial infatuation, it was kind of a let down.

Wonderful ambience, located in the heart of the city, terrace bar, pool facing tables, what more does one want? For those who like to puff while eating and drinking there's hookah too. I was glad that the tables were far enough to spare me from the smoke of hookahs! The manager of the place was very kind as he suggested brandy toddy for me since I was suffering from throat ache and cough. It was expensive at 1200 Rs without any real alcohol or anything but it worked wonders on my throat. Contained cloves, cinnamon, basil leaves and other spices which I couldn't really recognise! It was made with the best cognac they had in the bar, which may have been the factor for high price maybe. Had a decent crowd and was a chilled out place to hang out. I would say it's a nice place for a date or girls night out. For those who are looking for more than just a drink or bite can hop in to the spa which is also located on the terrace itself and offers some great massages!

To begin with.. This place wasn't planned. In fact I was avoiding going to this place from quite a while. As I thought it must be a shabby hookah Parlour.. And I landed here with my friends.. And I don't regret it..:)
It was a rooftop place.. Quite spacious..with a lighted pool.. Which is damn sexy.. The bar at the center is also nice.. Liked it..
I liked the seating though it was all wet due to rain. We were given fresh cushions.. Loved the ambience..
Coming to the main part the food and drinks.. The platter was quite good.. Pasta well cooked.. With good flavors not the regular ones u get at every lounge.. Music is soft enough for u to have a gala time with ur friends.. I liked the service too.. Though a little overpriced.. A well prepared hookah.. So great for hookah lovers.. A next visit for sure.:) have fun:)

One of the coolest place to visit in Kolkata for evening outing with friends & family. The ambience is just perfect with the pool by the side, dj playing the music & the laser light setting cosmic to the eyes. The place offers above average sheesha & food. Hookah flavours are missing. Staff out here are friendly.
The place is overpriced with the quality they offer.

A good place when it opened up, but now the service has gone down . Food menu does not have much options and limited to few things , tried the veg platter which was good but due to the lacking service was not able to enjoy , a good place to go for hukka.
 
Drinks are expensive and everything is highly priced . But ok for hotel standards.

the service is really bad , they need to get more waiters and more hukka's for the tables there.

Finding a waiter takes 15 min and then order takes 30-35 mins to get .

Wait time on hukka is more than 40 mins after order.

Hopefully they improve the service there.

One of my favorite rooftop lounges in South Calcutta- this place is uber cool with a chic decor and amazing ambiance. It has a swimming pool at one corner which makes the place even more attractive. Music is extremely nice and the surroundings just can't get better if you are in a mood to spend some alone-time with your beloved. Also it is going to be equally good if u want to catch up with your friends over hookah.. Hookah is good, although they don't provide a coal-change, which means you would need to order a fresh one as soon as the coal is over. I have been to this place a lot of times and have always ordered  this Smoke Shack Non-Veg Kebab platter with has almost all varieties of meat, starting from Chicken Mutton Prawn..the platter is served alongwith one portion of Dal Makhani and Naan. As accompaniments me and my friends had also opted for Virgin Mohito and Orange Coolers. Although the place is slightly on the expensive side, you wouldn't really mind it much as at the end of it you would love the whole experience. :)

Good food . . Spaghetti is nice . Hookah is good . Bit over priced though . 
But the only problem with this place is its staff .. They are damn slow . U just have to wait for 10-15 mins to find the waiter . 
Food option isn't that great .
They need to add more varieties . 

So if u want good ambience do visit this place with no high expectations in terms of food and service .

Smoke Shack is the rooftop lounge of hotel park plaza and boasts an amazing ambiance, view and comfort but at some premium.

Located in the Garcha lane just beside Pantaloons Gariahat, Park Plaza is a 5 star property and this is their open air lounge. The place also has its own pool and the seating area is huge with seats very well spaced out. The chairs and the large sofas are very comfortable. Overall it is the best open air lounge for me after The Bridge in Hotel Floatel. The music isn't that good and could be much more better. The staff are warm and polite but the service time is a bit high. Moreso the dim lighting and spaciousness on the roof makes it tough to get to a waiter at times. The food is pricey but decent though i love this place for its feel rather than food. 

Overall a great place to be if the weather outside is nice and inspite of few deficiencies n high prices, the ambiance gets to you and brings you back.  Would love it further if open full night instead of midnight!!

Hookah here is also excellent. You can easily chill here with friends for a long time. The poolside ambience looks excellent !! 
Always Happy to go to this place !!

Smokeshack is a lovely open air(roof) lounge in hotel park plaza.The hotel is situated in a narrow lane in ballygunge.On my first visit there i was bowled over by the interiors,so posh and classy. We sat near the pool which seems to be the star attraction of the place.It was christmas eve and a very food deprived santa was offering us toffees.It all went well till we ordered. We basically had gone to chill and have sheesha so we ordered one( brain freezer i think,dont remember clearly).The hookah was smooth and good with great flavour (but paying 700 for that didnt seem worth it ) .We ordered 5 mojitos(cocktails) .They tasted amazing, i can still feel its taste lingering in my mouth.What a delight it was(but again over priced at 650 each :/)Next we ordered griddled polenta with corn and green salsa which was terrible like an amatuer would have made it.We didnt complete that dish.bleh.
So basically what we did that night was click many pictures (utilising the pleasant ambience ;) ) and have a few cocktails with shisha and later what disappointed was the bill.A whopping 4800 if i remember clearly.

oh and i should not forget,the pathetic service added to our misery.We called our server 30 times from across ourr table and he wasnt interested. No tips followed ofcourse ;) 


There is a serious need to improve their food and service.I mean it !

So this place is top of the parkplaza hotel. The best time to visit would be evening, right after the sun set. The ambience is great with a wide angle view of the city and the swimming pool lights adding to the overall cool factor.

The hookah was decent but food and drinks are simply too costly for the average pocket.

Horrible food and even horrible service. Don't forget to take a torch to read read the menu . Ordered the grill and waiter did not bother to ask for the way I wanted it .bread is served as an afterthought and there is nothing served as a side with anything.... No veggies , mash nothing! Priced the same as west view at ITC sonar but not a not a patch on it.the waiters all shabbily dressed. I guess the place is just meant for drinks where you don't bother about the prices ( imagine reading the menu by a dim candlelight ) especially if you are a little inebriated !

I will start with the best, a big thumbs up for the ambience, the sheesha was also nicely prepared. We went in around 7 and the place was not at all filled .. it was a surprise to see an almost empty place on a sunday evening . The staff was helpfull till there were only few people. But around 8.30 the place was almost full and the need of extra staffing was definitely felt.  We tried the kumb kabab and the paneer tikka both were average.  The sheehsa combination was nicely prepared.

To add there was a very big screen, so this can be good place during the ipl. Epl. 
Overall not a very great experience keeping in mind the brand "park plaza". 
The place needs a lot of improvements in terms of the menu and also the staffing. The food and the service did not complement the price charged.

If I had to rate it solely on the ambience, then I would probably give it an 11 on ten. It's the perfect place this side of town to enjoy your drink on a terrace with a nice little poolside, super view and a soft breeze. But service is a bit tardy and could improve. And perhaps they should serve main course as well to make it total value for money.

The ambience of this place is surely the best that Calcutta has seen till date..winters and open air is the perfect match to have a great time..the only negetive point about this place is that food isn't that great and the quantity is too less even for a serving of two people (we ordered a mezze platter in which there were six tiny pieces of bread)..its expensive and surely not worth the money in case of spending it on food.)

Smoke shack is on a 5 star hotel near gariahat. You goto a 5* expecting a minimum level of service. 
Unfortunately smoke shack was not even close to any of those standards. 
Waiters were shabbily dressed. No one was around to take orders and the food was served cold. Our request for water was fulfilled in 25 mins which maybe some kind of a recors
When we tried to give feedback, a polite formality was presented to us. There was no empathy and sense of purpose. 
Calcuttans - if u r looking for other open aor  alternatives, stick to aqua ...

I will start with the best, a big thumbs up for the ambience, the sheesha was also nicely prepared. We went in around 7 and the place was not at all filled .. it was a surprise to see an almost empty place on a sunday evening . The staff was helpfull till there were only few people. But around 8.30 the place was almost full and the need of extra staffing was definitely felt.  We tried the kumb kabab and the paneer tikka both were average.  The sheehsa combination was nicely prepared.

To add there was a very big screen, so this can be good place during the ipl. Epl. 
Overall not a very great experience keeping in mind the brand "park plaza". 
The place needs a lot of improvements in terms of the menu and also the staffing. The food and the service did not complement the price charged.

Pathetic...totally pathetic.
   
I went there with my friends on New Year Eve @ 2000/head cover charges. The DJ, music and the music system was so bad. People hated the music and the dance floor was totally empty till 11.30. Even on repeated request by the whole crowd, the DJ refused to change the music. 

There was nothing to eat. Literally nothing to eat in vegeterian. There were 4 items in total. We tried all of them and hated it. The waiting time was at least 1 hour. Food and drinks were so so expensive. When selling tickets I was told Rs. 2000 could be redeemable but over there we were told only  Rs. 1600 could be redeemable, 400 were taxes.  I have been to parties all over the world. Been almost everywhere in Kolkata as well, but this time Smoke Shack was the worse arrangements I've seen in my life. The waiters, the managers, the chefs, the pickup boys...nobody knew what was going on.  Utter rubbish. 

You all could'nt get worse.  You just spoilt it.

We were 4 of us. Total waste of my 8000 bucks. I would have rather spent more and gone to a decent place. The least the management could do is refund back my money.

Piyush.

Terribly disappointing; especially since we went expecting so much.  Waited twenty odd minutes for someone to take our order.  Finally chased a waiter down who refused to believe we had waited so long, saying we were there only for five minutes.  It is off putting to be second guessed like that in a hotel which is otherwise known for its hospitality.  Got the menus after 30 minutes, and the waiter disappeared again for another fifteen, which is when we got fed up and left.  What made it worse that there was literally no rush, and there were servers standing around but refusing to make eye contact to take the order.

For a place with such a lovely ambience this was really terrible service.  Totally unexpected.  Would recommend staying away from a place that doesn't seem to have the basics of service down.

Great Decor and ambiance. Lovely rooftop eatery. But below average food and poor service. No pro activeness from the waiters. Not enough food items in the menu.

The Smoke Shack has out door seating and is a great place to spend your weekend .... I have honestly only stopped by for a quick drink to catch up with a friend but I loved the general ambiance. Though I am a music lover at times I felt the music gets a bit monotonous and also its way too loud . A little modulation would not hurt and will also attract a larger cross-section of guests. Surprisingly the service here was the least attentive of all the restaurants that I have patronized at Park Plaza and for something as simple as ice one had to make numerous requests. Hope this will be corrected by the management because the potential of this place is brilliant and it has simply no competition in terms of ambiance in this part of Kolkata. Now that the cooler months are here I look forward to dropping by and sampling the Grill Menu. Hope the management has had time to iron out the kinks and sort them out.

Smooke Shack is an open terrace lounge bar place of sorts where apparently shisha is quite popular.

We just went for drinks and light tid bits. 

Cocktail was perfect no complains, the food - we ordered a veg platter - was definitely on the weaker side.

Though these kind of places food is not popular per se, but with the nice ambience and good service if they can improvise the food menu and the food itself this place can do much better.

Rates are on the higher side which is expected considering its in a hotel(3/4 star?)

Platter was around 600, cocktail at around 500. 

But can be a good place to catch up with some one special or with your friends!

The Place was awesome... Five of us  went there on Diwali night to celebrate one of our friends spinster's party. We loved the ambiance... The trans music was really soothing. We spent 3-4 hours and the best part was the pool-side. It was really rejuvenating. The drinks, food, hookah everything was good. We had a cake cutting ceremony. The staff helped us serving the cake with a candle, which made the "to be bride" too happy about the serving. It was really a great experience for us with our first visit to smoke shack.

decent place to be.. the best thing about the place is the ambience .. nice setup and decent meal experience... what the management needs to understand is that in today's food and lounge business we don't want to see servers in a blue shirt and white round cap. when u have setup such a nice place give your servers a smart getup.. let them have the shirt, remove the cap and let them dress smart. would definitely visit again, love the pool setup where one can knee dip in the pool while sipping a drink.. will visit again

Good ambience...nice music but is that enough??? No one comes to take orders...by chance someone is spotted ...when asked to come to take orders..will definitely give an expression that he is doing a favour by taking orders !!! Whats worse is the disappearance for more than 45 mins!! and when finally order comes..its below average!! Why would we go and pay double the amount for a below average service and extremely pathetic food and very disappointing cocktail????
Please employ better bartenders!

I went to smoke shack with the thought that I would get some good hookah with a drink. As I walk in there was no staff to greet the guest. There was no table occupied but still the approach of the staff was not good. The staff did not let me sit along with my friends. He asked me to order as I was standing and then said that there is no hookah as the man is absent. 
This is least expected from a staff member of Park Plaza. 
Gives me second thoughts on whether I would ever go back there
For me 1.5 stars is also alot but the ambiance won the star.

One of the few places I've enjoyed in Kolkata. Ambience is perfect, and so was the food. Just one dampener the music was too loud, n will not help if you want to sit n talk. All in all, quite a good place.

Apart for this the recent introduction of lovely imported wines and beers has made a lot of difference.

Best place in town

Bad attitude of staff. 

Works on reservations, so don't think to enter when you feel like. 

Been there at 6, only 2 people and no staff. No reserved board but no seats were empty as per manager.

Amidst the chaos of the megacity, exists Smoooke Shack a part of Park Plaza, Ballygunge. It is one the most romantic destination in the entire city, albeit also being one of the most expensive ones.

Smoooke Shack is an open-air, tranquil lounge. There are a variety of alcohol & hookah options to set the mood & relax on weekend, before you restart a hectic week.But, to be very honest, this place scores hugely on ambience. This is probably the only place in Kolkata with such an amazing view and such tranquility around it. You can just sit and while the hours away,without any care in the world. 

Yes, its expensive, but an experience in itself. If that special someone in your life is sick and bored with all the usual places you take him/her, go on a date to Smoooke Shack. It will be completely worth it. 

My orders were - 4 Kamikaze Shots & 2 large JD billed at Rs. 5800/- (Inc of all taxes esp 27% alcohol tax)
