Being a sweet lover, I never miss the chance to taste the sweets of different shops.So I also have tried some of their sweets..they are pretty good..just try once their misti doi.Its one of the best in the town..I also tried their bonde and pantua & love the smell of the desi ghee inside the sweets..a big üëç for their quality of sweets.

An old small sweet shop located at Hatibagan, which keeps a variety of sweets.

Service is good with well behaved staffs. 

Tried Misti Doi & Sorvaja. Both were pretty decent and fresh.

Pocket pinch is economical.

Caters well to the need of local people , with sweets having  decent size with reasonable price.

An old shop selling good sweets. Tried a few here. Each were very good to try. Loved their Rosogolla and Kalojam. Both were very good.
Prices are decent enough.

Kalash sweets is an old sweet shop located at Hatibagan.

Ambience is ok with quick service & well behaved staffs.

Tried their Misti doi and Pantua, both were decent at cheap price. They have a tough competition with other famous nearby sweet brands but they have maintained their quality quite well.

Overall nice.

Kalash sweets manage to do well especially in an area with such a stiff competition with such big names around the area. Kalash manages to provide quality food at a reasonable price compared to other stores in the¬†area which makes it so popular among locals.
The place is subtle and small as in you could pass by it without even noticing. It has a hookah parlour which it tries to focus more on whereas they should think about this shop given its popularity in the area.
P.S.- This is the store where I buy sweets for my home as they are quite cheap and good in quality.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Try and not be late as many good sweets tend to get over early in the evening.

Located near Dominos, tried the Mishti Doi and Roshogolla. Small and old place, but the pricing here is really cheap. Gets you numerous variety of sweets to look out for. Well behaved staff and fast service, try this place if you are around!
