Such a humble little place for your Chinese craving. Located in golf green it's a good place for some fried wantons and crispy fried chilly fish and manchow soup. Not a very fancy go to place but who cares foods good and cheap enough for complete satisfaction. Must visit .

this small restaurant is tucked inside Bikramgarh, Jadavpur. As this place is very close to my home, I preferred to go to this joint to pack our dinner. We opted for pan fried fish , mixed rice noodles, black bean chicken and chicken sweet corn soup. Best thing about this joint is that both the quality and the quantity are satisfactorily sufficient without burning a hole in your pocket. I would love to come back here.

Location of these restaurant is very tricky. It is situated just beside golf green. Follow google map.... Comming to the food, ordered cantonese veg noodles and chinese chicken sizzler. Both the dishes were good. Ambience is also ok.

A small place for Chinese food lovers . Very reasonable pricing and taste wise food is really good. They have just start up and it shows in their serving and order taking ways. The staff is very helpful and polite and has nice behavior. only drawback is car parking has to be done a bit far from the place which is in a narrow lane  and the staff should improve their way of serving things .This is just a suggestion which would help them to improve. Hope they keep their great tasty food and reasonable pricing for long time so that they get more foot fall. All the best @GoChinese

Heard about this restro from a Foodies group in social platform and went there out of curiosity... And what I found is quite interesting.. The place is not very big but alright for couples, college goers and also, friend groups..
Let's come to actual point.. The food.. The most essential part of a restaurant! We had Chicken Spring Rolls as starter and Go Chinese Special Chicken Noodles and Black Pepper Chicken as main course!
Spring rolls were small yet crispy and tasty!
Pepper Chicken was also good.. But the showstopper was certainly the Noodles! It tasted so great that I gulped it within no time!! Tasty, smooth and exquisite!!
The only thing we missed was the dessert which was not available at that time! Would recommend everyone for a quick bite as well as dinner!

Google maps will definitely act as a saviour while locating this place, tucked inside the lanes of Bikramgarh Bazaar. This joint serves Chinese at its best be it the quality or the quantity, and, that too without burning a hole in the pocket! This cozy little joint can house a maximum of 20 people at a time.
Dined in yesterday and was more than impressed.

Had opted for a Go Chinese Special Veg Hakka Chowmein, Honey Chicken and Veg Spring Roll. The Veg Spring Roll was the best dish we had yesterday. The Chowmein was a bit too oily but it tasted good with the Honey Chicken (10 pieces).

They do take quite sometime in bringing the food from the kitchen to the table, but then, it is worthy of that wait! The staff is very friendly.

This place will be frequented by me for sure, way too happy with this place.

A small joint near bikramgarh bazar, this place is sure to win your hearts. You get good food at a reasonable price. Ambience is good,though you will not find much crowd in here. I have tried a wide variety of dishes. Momo remains my favourite. Other dishes that I like are chicken lollipop, crispy chicken, fried rice, chilli chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and noodles. Another favourite of mine is the honey noodles with ice cream. Quantity is quite good. The best part is that there is no extra tax. Overall, this place is strongly recommended. :)

The place has a comfy feeling to it...  The decor is soothing. But finding the place can be a bit difficult. We circled around Bikramgarh for a long time. Coming to the food, they are really tasty and flavourful. We ordered Crispy Chicken, Chicken lollipop for starter, Chilli Garlic Noodles, kungpao chicken for mains and crispy fried noodles with Ice cream for dessert. Crispy Chicken was absolutely delicious. The noodles were well cooked and had enough chicken and egg in it. Kungpao chicken was so so. But my favourite is the dessert. The crispy fried noodles were hot and sweet and the icecream was tipped with almonds. The combination of hot and cold was delightful. And we had all these in just 490 bucks.

Had been there for the second time. An authentic Chinese restaurant in the lanes of bikramgarh area. Absolutely pocket friendly with their delicious Chinese dishes. I love their go Chinese special fried rice and obviously the sizzler. Good ambience and quality service. Only bad is we have to wait a long for the food to arrive.

Its a very small restaurant very near my house and so i visited it wth a friend to try out the food. We went there around 9 and the owner informed us that they would be taking around 30-35 minutes to serve the food. Likewise we got the food at 9:50 or so and it did seem like a pretty long wait. The decor is nice with a big aquarium at one end of the room. We had ordered red and green bell pepper chicken which was indeed very tasty. The two kinds of noodles we ordered: Cantonese chowmein and hongkong style panfried noodles were good in taste but i felt that both lacked a bit of proper seasoning. None of their desert options were available. 

The food was good but there is definitely room for improvement and the prices are reasonable, rather low compared to contemporary restaurants.

Lovely food with authentic Chinese taste. Friendly staff and pleasing service are  the reasons I wish to visit again soon. Interiors are pretty average and so is the ambience. They do play some decent music in the background. Price is very reasonable and hence a instant hit among youths like us.

Lovely food and lovely people behind the wok !!!

I have tased there Chicken sizzler.. which is like out of this world!! Not too spicy not bland.. a perfect mix of flavours and the Smoky aroma just makes it RIGHT!! 

The Chicken Kung Pow is a pleasant surprise with a perfectly balanced flavor..
The Fish ball soup will Make you go crazy coz of the very fact that is so simple but tastes extraordinary!! Think am exaggerating? Take a dig you'll know what am talking​ about.

The Caramel custord is the perfect finish to a lovely dinner. Both in taste and texture..

What I like the most of all is GOOD PROTIONS and NO BATTER just MEAT!!  That In itself is a great Bonous 😋😋😋😋

it's a recently opened restaurant as i typed this review but don't let that underestimate the food they have there. we've tried their chicken fried rice and the sichuan (i guess this is similar to schezwan) chicken fried rice, green and red pepper chicken and steam momo (juicy)  - trust me, their foods are some of the best we've tried  recently and the blending of their cooking in each recipes (especially the sichuan rice, which comes in great amount) are really carefully mixed  well and absolutely tastes good and oh, their sauce - wow ! since the place is not far from our apartment, we will definitely keep ordering their foods. reasonable and cheap prices too (compared to all their counterparts around).just adding that the waiters are really nice,responsive and alive there as well.

Ordered Chicken Meat Ball Soup, Crispy Baby Corn and Garlic Chives Dumpling. So I had this soup first and which was okay but the Chicken dumpling in it were very much tender and juicy. Now for the Baby corn they asked me about how spicy I would like and for me normal spicy was perfect and this was the best among which I've ordered. The Garlic Chive dumplings were nice too, the size were well justified according to the price, filled with enough chicken and chives.. A well decorated place with some nice people to serve.
