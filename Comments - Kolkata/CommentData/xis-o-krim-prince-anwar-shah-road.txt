Although the space is small but they serve one of the best roll ice creams of town. We had the Nutella rocher roll ice cream. It was too good to explain. Had a great time there.

Located on Prince Anwar Shah road beside Baskin and Robbins, this small ice cream parlour clearly didn't meet my expectations.
With fried ice cream rolls becoming a sensation in town and with multiple outlets springing up everywhere, xis o krim seriously needs to up their game. Their ice-creams are not up to the mark.

It's a very small outlet with barely two or three seats and hardly any space to even stand. So in case of queue (which i hardly think there will be) you might have to stand outside. And with one person catering to the orders, it takes time to serve.

The ice creams are very ordinary.
With a below average experience, this place according to my personal opinion is not recommended.

Good but not best!
Since I have already tried icecream rolls in icy fusion.
The person who was making it was confused with the temperature and was switching it On and Off,again and again. So the end product was too hard. Flavour wise it was perfect!
The shop is located in a very good location.

Located beside Buskin and Robbins ice cream parlor..it's situated on lords(price Anwar Shah).it's a live icecream parlor.small place and about 4-5 sitting arrangement...Though we are chocolate icecream lovers so,we ordered one chocolate crunches and one Dark chocolate..looks same but taste is different.. Dark chocolate nothing just like chocolate icecream with Hershey's syrup and some crunches just for decorations. The chocolate crunches taste like chocolate icecream mixed with some crunchy dusty nut..just superb..

I had a very high expectation from this live ice cream centre..but was highly disappointed. The tastes of the ice creams are not so great. Though they look really yum in pictures. Took 4 kinds of ice creams- caramel cheesecake, caramel crunch, brownie baby and Oreo overloaded. Only the brownie baby was good.. the others were not good at all.

I went there in a chilly eve as winter is already here.. I ordered Dark chocolate and I was literally amazed by the preparation of the entire thing because they made the whole thing live there.. I loved it
The only disappointing thing was that the place is too small..they only have 3 stools and 1bench like for 2..

Ice cream rolls are always a temptation if you've a sweet tooth; So this place was in my bucket list since a long time now. Finally I got a chance to visit a live ice-cream parlour serving some real delicacies other than the norm. 
The place is easily accessible and a must visit. Though they'll take a while to serve your order but it's worth the wait. We ordered a nutella rosher and butterscotch which were heavenly and pocket pinch.

I've been looking for a place that serves ice-cream rolls especially because Instagram was driving me crazy. It was not long before I hunted this place down and it left me delighted. Being a person that always have some space left for desserts after a full-heart meal, I gorged on two rolls: the chocolate crunch with white chocolate bits and the cream-cheese ice rolls. The making was so exquisite that left me in awe. It's a bit pricey considering ice-cream, but if you like to taste something out of the box, this is definitely worth a try.

To soothe our tingling taste buds, there is no lack of ice-cream parlours in Kolkata nowadays. Xis o Krim is definitely among the best ones and these ice cream rolls are something I like having every now and then.

They just opened the store and started cleaning and setting up, when I entered around 1:30. But the attendant did not make me wait for long. He started making my Oreo Strawberry flavoured ice-cream almost right away. This process is something I like observing. He used real Oreo and some strawberry jam for the ice-cream and the topping as well. In the meantime I also took some glances at the decoration, seating, counter etc. Although the kiosk is very small but everything was neat and crisp. The ice-cream tasted good and the cost was frugal.

This is a small place beside the Baskin Robin's near Lord's bekary. Though it was a small place but the tastes were humongous!
The store can hardly accommodate 5-6 people at a time. But the decor was quite nice. Staff was quite attentive and service was prompt.
Now coming to their ice creams- top notch! They tasted quite unique and yummy! I and my friends tried Choco Crunch, Dark Chocolate and Nutella Rocher Love. First two were delicious but the last one was simply heavenly! It was like firework in my mouth!
I would definitely suggest this place to people and would love to visit this place again! üëå

Amazing joint for dessert lovers! The making of ice cream rolls are quite amazing to watch. Due to the small room and less space, they don't have sufficient workers as per the crowd and orders. That's why you have to wait a bit for your chosen dessert. But the wait is definitely worth it. The flavours are really tasty and the quantity is also perfect for your sweet tooth cravings. The best part is it remains open till 1:30 am! So, after a long tiring day if you don't get much time to cater your sweet taste buds, don't worry, they're open after midnight! Perfect value for money dessert shop for sweet tooths. I've been here for a lot of times, definitely I'll visit more.

Over hyped shop. Tastes are not that good. And the shopkeeper is not much professional. 
Initially ordered for choco crunch and cheese cake. Then the person in the billing counter suggested to try kiwi. Changed choco crunch to kiwi. Didn't like it.
There was a order from swiggy for 3 ice cream... And my order was the 4th one. I had to wait 1hr 10mins to get a ice cream and the taste was also not worth waiting... 
They were busy talking over phone and I heard them discussing that they missed some ingredients.
And the worst part is the placement of the insect killer (just above where you sit). One insect fell inside my ice cream. And the ice Cream was waste.

Located near the Balaram Mullick outlet on Prince Anwar Shah Road, Xis o Krim is a cozy little ice cream place which serves rolled ice cream. They make it right in front of you and the process is quite entertaining to behold. Coming to the food- I have tried the Caramel Crunch, Dark Chocolate, Big Bubblegum and Nutella Rosher Love flavours. The first two were amazing. We had the other two on Asthami evening. From the taste, we could tell that they were running out of ingredients as the milk was watered down. So, overall an okayish experience, but looking forward to trying more flavours.

I've had ice cream rolls at frollz and this was beyond imagination amazing. 
Open till 2/4 in the morning, this is definitely the place anybody in south Calcutta would want to go to for any kind of ice cream cravings. Not just for the amazing naturally made ice creams they offer, but the absolutely fantastic behaviour of the the staff. 
Keep up the work.

This tiny icecream parlor truly does justice to our taste buds and to our health with it's range of fruity icecreams, which are prepared from actual fruits and minimum synthetic flavors. This is huge plus point in my opinion. I had the Kiwi icecream which I saw they prepped from a whole kiwi fruit. As I always look for healthy options when it comes to choosing what to eat, this place definitely stands out from the rest. A Big Thumbs Up from me and more people should try out from their awesome ranges of flavors.

For, the first time I experienced "Live Ice Cream Rolls". 
This place was on my demand list since. And guess what? It was all worth the patience and wait. ^_^ 
It was such a amazing experience. 

We ordered, Caramel Crunch And Oreo Reload Rolls. Which were breathtaking. The roll makers are very cooperative and friendly. 

The only thing, I will suggest is - the price is a bit expensive than the quantity they produced. They should increase their rolls or decrease their price. 

But, overall I loved the first experience. :)

This relatively new ice cream parlour has come up at Lords Bakery More near the Balaram Radhamallick sweet shop. It has got seating arrangements for around 3-4 people and there is a lot of variety on the menu. The ice creams are all hand made on being ordered so it takes around 10 minutes to be served on being ordered. All the ice creams here are served as rolls wrapped and placed in a cup. Quality of the ice creams is good and pricing is also reasonable. Overall a great addition to the already vast and excellent food hub that the place has turned into!!

Located beside Baskin and Robbin's franchisee outlet at Prince Anwar Shah. This live ice-cream parlour is similar to the concept based outlet Chillz. However their limited flavours blends really well in to your olfactory lobes as well as rostral part of one's brain providing distinct odour of each ingredient and authentic flavour for the same. The service was prompt ,they were gracious enough to allow a time lapse video of the live process. Interior is decorated on the principle of small but beautiful theme. The 3 D wall art is worth mentioning. Overall a candid experience. A must recommended place for small and cost effective ice cream dates. Ordered Oreo and strawberry.

Seeing your ice cream being frozen on spot is amazing. Now you don't just see it only on Instagram but also in Kolkata. Ice cream rolls are totally wonderful. This ice cream centre is situated at a great location very near to Lord's More on the Prince Anwar Shah road. The staff is pretty fast and expert in rolling the frozen cream. The taste is awesome . And they top it with white choco chips, choco syrup , oreos and other stuff according to your choice of flavour. It's probably not like digging into a bucket of H√§agen-Dazs, but its a different kind of experience. It's pretty affordable with the prices within 200. There is not much place to sit, then again it's not crowded with loads if people. This ice cream parlour is totally worth a visit!

P.S. I had the chocolate crunches. It was wonderful. There was an abundance of chocolate chips make it actually crunchy and the texture of the ice cream was amazing too.

Much ado, in vain. The ice cream rolls are much hyped over social media, wanted to try it out myself. I must say a 40 rupees cornetto would have satisfied much more. The nutella rocher whatever. It had only one rocher and "diluted" nutella again diluted to create the rolls. 3 drops of chocolqte syrup and they call it their creation. Nowhere near to their competitors. Waste of 190 bucks.

You get to choose your ice cream roll flavor from a wide variety of flavors. I was really curious to know how Strawberry and Oreo is gonna click when put together. So I ordered that. And guess what? It did blend perfectly. Yes, I loved the ice cream and I'd totally recommend it. Though the rolls melt very fast, it is always a delight to watch the way they present it.

We visited this outlet on Independence Day. The shop is small but cozy. The servicemen were well behaved. The shop is easy to locate. It's just beside Balaram Mullick sweet shop.

We ordered 

Black Current - It was nice, tangy flavoured and was garnished with colourful sprinkles.

Nutella Rosher - It was made with a Ferro Rosher and we could feel the flavour. It was garnished with chocolate sauce and White chocolate chips.

Oreo & Strawberry - It was rich in taste, made with chocolate flavoured oreos. It was garnished with the Oreo biscuits itself.

The total bill was Rs440, they don't include tax. 3 ice cream rolls were enough for 4 people. The only disappointment was that the shakes were not available, also we couldn't get other flavours like Thandai.

Overall the experience was quite good. Would like to visit here again.

To the extreme south of the city, this is one of the famous rolled/live ice cream shops. Having been here a couple of times, I don't mind ordering my usual favourites, the dark chocolate ice cream and the butterscotch one. Strawberry ice cream failed to impress me as much. What I like is they oblige to your requests of pouring chocolate spice or caramel sauce before rolling the ice cream. The Service is thus worthy of mention!

What is summertime without Ice cream!? So, decided to try Nutella Rocher Love and Brownie Baby Ice cream rolls from their Xis Krim Special menu. Absolutely loved the flavour of Nutella Rocher Love topped with vanilla chips. There were no redundant toppings. However, didn't like the latter topped with brownies, vanilla chips and chocolate wafer sticks much. This Ice cream parlour can accommodate up to 5 people. Definitely gonna pay a visit soon.

We visited this outlet on Independence Day. The shop is small but cozy. The servicemen were well behaved. The shop is easy to locate. It's just beside Balaram Mullick sweet shop.

We ordered 

Black Current - It was nice, tangy flavoured and was garnished with colourful sprinkles.

Nutella Rosher - It was made with a Ferro Rosher and we could feel the flavour. It was garnished with chocolate sauce and White chocolate chips.

Oreo & Strawberry - It was rich in taste, made with chocolate flavoured oreos. It was garnished with the Oreo biscuits itself.

The total bill was Rs440, they don't include tax. 3 ice cream rolls were enough for 4 people. The only disappointment was that the shakes were not available, also we couldn't get other flavours like Thandai.

Overall the experience was quite good. Would like to visit here again.

To the extreme south of the city, this is one of the famous rolled/live ice cream shops. Having been here a couple of times, I don't mind ordering my usual favourites, the dark chocolate ice cream and the butterscotch one. Strawberry ice cream failed to impress me as much. What I like is they oblige to your requests of pouring chocolate spice or caramel sauce before rolling the ice cream. The Service is thus worthy of mention!

What is summertime without Ice cream!? So, decided to try Nutella Rocher Love and Brownie Baby Ice cream rolls from their Xis Krim Special menu. Absolutely loved the flavour of Nutella Rocher Love topped with vanilla chips. There were no redundant toppings. However, didn't like the latter topped with brownies, vanilla chips and chocolate wafer sticks much. This Ice cream parlour can accommodate up to 5 people. Definitely gonna pay a visit soon.

An innovative start must say. Such ice creams were not new to me as i have had tasted them while i visited singapore and thailand. But getting such thing exactly the same in taste was really unexpected.
A place that the ice cream lovers should visit.
They offer a variety of menu. But many items were not available that was much dissapointing to note. Only two people are there to serve you so it will take time to serve your order and the service time is a bit too much. The venture is much too small accomodating only 8 people at a time and having chairs only fr 5 people to sit. For such draw backs i only gave 4 points instead giving 5 points.
The quality and taste is indeed great.
Quite pocket friendly.
Prices inculsive taxes are mentioned in menu.
Both cash ana cards accepeted.
Yup one suggestion..
I tried litchi in fruit , dont try that istead try dark choclate  or their special  menu.
And yuup the choco strawberry  is a mention it was great in taste.
Orea and mango also need a spcl mention.
Overall it worth my 2nd visit dere...for sure to try on more flavours 
And try the ice creams once.

It is a small cozy place with a variety of delicious options to choose from. I had the nutella rocher icecream roll which was topped with chocolate sauce and white chocolate chips and chocolate waffers. The description suggests how superbly amazing it tasted! Give this place a visit it's definitely worth it!

This city has never failed to surprise me with innovative new concepts. The concept is quite fun to watch..... The journey from milk to rolled ice-cream. For someone who is calorie concious & yet love ice-cream, you wouldn't feel guilty coz u know it's just ice baked & rolled flavoured milk.... N 'hey' they do use fresh fruits for flavouring as well. The taste is decent & flavour choice is a personal preference. Yet one should try it just for it's concept :) 

4.5 coz they can design the place to look more pretty & relevant to the concept. It's hygienic but just randomly decorated.

So,starting with the location this place is easy to find and locate .1 stop from lords more to Anwar shah just besides basking and robbins . 
Decoration is cool but space was very small . 
Many varieties of ice cream flavours from which you can choose . 
Pocket friendly .. 
Taste is superb ..

Food quality, quantity, decoration - 5/5 
the natural flavoured icecreams are extremely good and refreshing! they make icecreams instantly in front of you and serve. Very innovative.

The City Of Joy has came up with a new concept of ice cream which is fried rolled ice cream. Select the flavours you want and they will prepare your ice cream right in front of you. Well this concept came directly from Thailand. Xis O Krim has came up with this concept and has won hearts of people. My friend and i went there to try out some of their delicacies. A very small outlet with hardly 3-4 persons to accomodate. We had Nutella Rosher Love and Brownie Baby. Loved the former- it was rich and smooth. You get the sweetness from the nutella flavour and then the nuttiness from the ferrero rocher. Coming to the Brownie Baby, well it was good but not as good as the Nutella Rosher one. Will definately recommend the nutella one.

I mean it's ice cream; who doesn't love that? More than the flavours, the whole "making your ice-cream right in front of you" concept of the place has made rate the place a coveted 4 points. The way they "chop" the milk to a frozen, delectable piece of perfection, will definitely excite the child in you. If I must, then I would recommend the Chocolate Nutella, Black Currant and Berry Strawberry flavours that they have (but you really shouldn't bother with this, as all the classic flavours taste delicious).

Located near Lords More, this place has been giving a quite a good competition to Baskin Robbins. Ice cream rolls has been trending a lot recently and this place has been the talk of the town for its pocket friendly Ice-creams and also been appreciated for the parlour timings. It's a rescue for all those midnight ice cream cravings we all go through. The making of the ice cream live, is truly quite a sight. Though I didn't have much time in hand so couldn't explore much flavours. I tried the Bubblegum ice cream and flavours were perfect. The presentation was quite good, but can be improved a little more I'd say. Also the store can be a little more decorated. Overall good place and definitely worth a visit.

CHOCOLATE CRUNCHES.... thats what we've ordered.just beside balaram mullick's sweet shop nd baskin robbins ice cream parlour you will see this outlet on prince anwarshah rd near lords bakery.post lunch dessert is what i was craving for and zomato showed me this outlet nearby(we were at lake gardens). By seeing the pictures i wanted to knw how they can make ice cream rolls.this interest of mine made me come to this outlet. Innovative idea,something for which im ready to pay.its tasty since its ice cream.but they literally make this ice cream on a cold plate from chocolate liquid cream/milk in front of you.tastes yumm....but they need to start another frozen plate as time required to make it is a lil more since one plate n one person only making it..they should arrange for a bigger place coz its a tiny place can accomodate 4-5 people at max..parking is a prob coz on the main road...rest its worth trying!!

TBH, I didn't like it. There has been an increase in the number of ice cream parlours that have sprung up recently in this city of sweet-lovers of Rosogolla and Sandesh. Till very recently, Calcuttans were dependent on those little shops of Kwality Walls Swirl or the nostalgic scoops of the ghats near Prinsep and such. But they have also embraced the new parlours that have been coming up recently and devoured in their menu. I had been to a couple of those. But Xis o Krim, which happen to be located near the Balaram Mullick Sweet shop, my all-time fav and many of Kolkata's as well I am sure, was a complete disappointment. First of all, I found the ice creams dry n wry. Maybe its 'coz of the make of it. The making process is a bit interesting though I have seen Nitrogen-processed ice creams be made earlier. Another disappointment besides the taste was the pocket-pinch. These parlours are costly compared to the Swirls or the scoops where u get quality as well.

Cosy little place for dessert and ice-cream lovers just beside the Baskin Robins outlet(the owner is brave if you know what I mean). The flavors were very interesting and we settled for dark chocolate and chocolate crunches. And to advice you, the flavors were lots more than the menu in zomato. The place is quite small. Only 3-4 people can fit inside at a time. But then again the making of the rolls in front of you is very interesting to see.

Just 1 thing i would like to recommend to d owner who was very generous n friendly to all his customers..is that...pls add the images of the ice creams and a brief description about the flavours in d menu card,making it easy n eye soothing for d customers to choose n order the flavor of their choice

a neat nice live ice cream counter that stays open till late on the anwar shah road,  boasts quite a few variety and flavours..... the shop itself is pretty tiny and gets a little cramped up and hence the service is a little slow so if you are about to visit,  please have some time in your hand.... the staff is actually very friendly and courteous and they informed us that they will bring more counters to serve faster than what it is now.... honestly i am not too overwhelmed with the live ice_cream concept after having it in 3-4 outlets.... it just adds a bit to the craftsmanship but nothing to the food in itself.... but wit more and more such outlets opening and staying on till late,  it gives a zing to the nightlife in this city..... this place is surely recommended.....

With my instafeed flooded with Ice-cream roll videos and photographs, I found myself today at Xis O Krim. It wasn't planned, I was passing by and thought I should give it a try. The weather craved for it, not me.The flavours hit me like alien words, but then I decided to play it safe (there is nothing unsafe when it comes to ice-cream though) and ordered Chocolate Crunches.¬†
Felt like a 6-year old when I literally saw the cream transform into the gelato form and then it was curled up in rolls and I was amazed.¬†

The CHOCOLATE CRUNCHES is made with chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate sticks, more chocolate, chocolate chips and modesty, genuity and care. The cup was loaded proportionately and I found it worth the price (entertainment + ice-cream). I wish the owner all the best for this venture and pray for its expansion in recent times. Will be ticking off more flavours very soon.

Very innovative, interesting place. First time experience in Kolkata. Live ice cream rolls made infront of eyes, on a cold turnstile and exciting toppings added too.
Liquid flavoured scraped into ice cream rolls.
Was an innovative experience. Taste is although like any other ice cream but the flavours are newer like bubble gum, nutella, ferrero rocher.

Place is small, less sitting tho. Hidden gem or so.

I've been wanting to check out this for the longest time, but didn't get the opportunity to. So last night, much past midnight my friends and I were craving ice cream. We called them up and asked, cause there was no home delivery mentioned in Zomato site, just in case.  Voila..they did. 
Ordered Litchi, Dark Chocolate and Brownie icecream. 
The litchi ice cream was perfect with fresh bits of litchi. 
Dark Chocolate was dark and chococjips on top. 
My favourite one was brownie- it perfectly matched the sweetess. 

Minimum order was 300. Our bill came to 440.
The ice cream was delivered frozen for most parts.. We are located 10 mins from the shop.

What I recommend - Litchi and Brownie. 

Value For money - who can argue when midnight icecream cravings are satisfied. 
Will I order again - YES.

This place is located next to Baskin Robbin's ice cream shop & it's a stone based ice cream parlour. They have a separate section for chocolate ice creams so for all the chocolate lovers out there, you'll enjoy having the varieties. I had dark chocolate ice cream and tastes good, they added white chocolate chips, Hershey's‚Äã syrup and sprinkled it with colourful chunks, do ask them to customise it for yourself.

This place has been open for quite a while now but got enlisted on Zomato a few days back. I have been one of their first customers and on liking their products, I have kept coming back along with my friends, family and cousins.
Live Ice Cream Rolls are now a cool thing to do. We all have been fantasising about trying them on watching the Bangkok Street Ice Cream Rolls and finally Kolkata has gotta try them, not only at this outlet but many other brands at a time. Xis O Krim is one of them but they are exclusive because till date, they have been concentrating on one outlet only and not the multiple ones. 
The making of the ice creams are a thing to check out here. Tastewise, they are not very different from premium quality ice creams available in Kolkata, but here you pay for the experience of witnessing to make ice creams and not only the tub you're gorging on. 
I prefer their fruity flavours to chocolatey ones because you get to devour the pulpy bits in the ice cream as they scrape it off the rolls.
Recommended flavours to try -
Strawberry 
Green Apple
Litchi (only summers)
Butter Crunch
Nutella 
They have a variety of toppings and sauces that you can ask for accompaniment to your ice cream and that makes it even good. I love coming back here again and again. Cheers to Xis O Krim. Recommended. Totally! Happy Dining! :)

Nice slices of ice cream, swiftly made in front of the customer, rolled into 4 or 5 small cylinders,  only natural products are used and no added flavours, what else do u need for a dessert?? Nice place if u want to try some real ice cream with real flavours.

I have visited this place thrice and I am always glad whenever someone puts quality ingredients and not just concentrate on quantity.  Kolkata's image of quantity over quality is slowly changing and joints like these contribute to that!
Also the prices at which they offer are very reasonable! My pick here would be bubble gum and nutella Ferrero rocher love!
Keep up the good work!

The outlet might be a little small but the treats are simply marvellous. It is truly fun to watch them prepare the ice cream roll and since all the ingredients are fresh it is extra tasty. Service is good as well

My first ice cream roll in the city, pretty decent. Tried a Dark Chocolate variant and a Nutella Rocher, a little small for comfortable sit & dine. Taste is kind of okayish for the price they charge, but nothing too special. 

A 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è overall.

Small and cozy outfit near Lords More , this place is getting more popular everyday. With Live Icecream counter , this place has a unique concept which is unlike the other Ice cream outlets in Kolkata. Had a Pan Fried Dark Chocolate and it was simply awesome. Though i feel the items are a tad over priced and the place surely needs an expansion to accomodate more people, this place is a must visit given the unique kind of gelato it provides you.

Xis o Krim - Lovely ice cream must say.
=====
Location & Intro:

It is located right next to Bullaram and Radharam Mullick when going towards South City.

It serves lipsmacking ice creams at decent price. The concept is of making ice cream rolls and serving it on top with toppings. Watching how the ice cream is made is worth a show.¬†
=====
What we had:

Both of us ordered for one bubble gum ice cream. The Ice Cream was great to taste especially when marsh mellows where thrown on top of it. Loved it.
=====
Pros:

‚óã Great Ice Cream.
‚óã Moderately priced.¬†
‚óã Staffs are humble.

Cons:
‚óã Quite small when it comes to space.¬†
=====
Ice Cream for two: My ice cream costed me around 120 bucks. It would be approx 200-250 for two if each of you want to fill your stomach with ice cream. The prices are subject to change due to macro economic factors such as inflation, etc.
=====
Summary:

Presentation 4.2/5
Taste 4.2/5
Quality 4.2/5
Quantity 4.2/5
Service 4.2/5
Hospitality 4.1/5
Ambiance 4/5
VFM ¬†4/5
=====
Conclusion:
Would love to visit it again in the near future. Lovely ice creams at not very pocket pinching price.¬†
=====
Unbiased review based on my visiting experience.

I have been eyeing this place for some time. And have been wanting to try it for ages. Tried the peanut butter and caramel. Both tasted yummy, and the nicest part was that they were not overtly sweet. They texture was spot on, and it was fun seeing it being made in front of your eyes. I just wish they gave more rolls like they give abroad. 4 rolls vanish so soon!!!!!

New icecream parlor in town!!! Yeah!!!! 
Well, i was very excited to try out the divine fried rolls of ice cream ever since this shop came up... 
Absolutely loved the new idea and the fried ice creams are definitely going to satisfy ur major ice cream cravings..
This ice cream parlor is located near lord's more and next to baskin robbins..

The interior was pretty, eye catching with jars of cookies and candies in front(making ur mouth water) as u enter.. 
We ordered
1) CARAMEL PAN FRIED ICECREAM AND ONE
2) BROWNIE BABY  ICE CREAM..

Firstly it was fun to see the man skillfully making ur ice cream in the pan and as it was served it was extremely delicious.. 
The nutty caramel chucks added more taste to the caramel ice cream and it was extremely tasty...

The brownie one was better though.. chunky brownie pieces with chocolate sauce made this ice cream a must have...
They also have free wifi..
Overall, had a good experience and would surely recommend this place to the dessert lovers.

This place is an absolute must visit for ice cream lovers . The spectacular flavours that they come up with every week is simply mind boggling and makes you keep coming back to try out the new flavours -all innovative and interesting . This thing is live so you are salivating whilst enjoying the process with intrigue and delight as these wonderful delights get created in front of ur eyes . It's pocket friendly and you can customise it any way you want . They are very generous with toppings and don't charge you extra !! My personal favourite is the nuttela ferrero Rocher . An actual Ferrero Rocher and a healthy dalop of Nutella  is given in it and not some artificial flavour !!  It's simply mouth watering , delicious and a visual treat as well . The strawberry is my second favourite - all the more extra special as it's made from fresh strawberry pulp !! A total 5 on 5 all round experience !!

Introducing this new ice cream to Kolkata from the streets of Thailand, this ice cream parlour works wonders. The new fried ice cream rolls are a must have. All the flavours are lovely and worth tasting. The owner of this parlour himself sits at the counter and is friendly as well as helpfull to his customers. Lovely service and appropriate rates. The ice cream will take some tine to be served as there is only one man and only one ice-cream frying pan.

Well today all of a sudden I checked in the shop and ordered for my self a chocolate Brownie for myself and then you won't believe as I took the first taste was like something very different and delicious you can't stop asking the boy for another one. So I did I had ordered for a mango blast which again was a Zara hatke from the normal once you have at other joints. So now I have decided to taste once every flavor and you my friends wait for me to give you my review of which one is the best. We even can go groupie for my next visit. So why wait and miss the opportunity to beat the summer with one of xis Krim. ÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ@

170 bucks for something thats so not satisfying. Heard and read about the furore about the ice cream rolls. Was dying to try them. Got a chance at this place and found it to be so substandard... Cursing ownself for this...

This one is a funky icecream parlour where you have the privilege of witnessing icecream getting cooked in front of your eyes! Pan fried or shall I say pan frozen?
Rolls of frozen icecream showered with goodies served in a cup or a takeaway container...This is really good..Taste is also good.

An amazing place to satisfy your ice cream cravings!Their way of presenting the icecream is pretty innovative and it tastes yummm..Firstly they put all the ingredients required for the chosen icecream flavour by you into the icecream,handblend it and then beat it into a thin sheet and eventually roll it and then the icecream gets served.W e had nutella rocher love and chocolate fruit and nut.nutella rocher love is highly recommended.One thing i can definitely say is their icecream can definitely give many big icecream brands a good run for their money.

Happening n interesting ice cream parlour that stands for LIVE ice cream rolls! Yummy concept üëå
The place is too small hence the seating area isn't enough for a good chat session over those delicious rolls!
A variety of rolls are available in this parlour!
We had tried out their BUTTERSCOTCH flavour & DARK CHOCOLATE flavour.
Liked the latter part more! Chocolate after all!
Butterscotch was okay type. Nothing special.
Staff took great care in preparing the rolls though.

Now this place has surely grabbed a lot of eyes by the amazing and unique thing you get here. Marble slab ice creams or ice cream rolls are a pretty common and well known form of this cold dessert around the world but wasn't something that the Kolkatans had tried yet.

Kis-o-crim brought this amazing concept into the city and they've surely had a great response since their opening. With a variety of flavors that includes luxury fruits, chocolate, caramel and all that, this place surely serves the greater purpose of providing a great ice cream.

So if you're an ice cream lover, you'll love this. But if you're not, you should try this place too. Watching the whole thing being created makes the crave for it overflow.

A first of its kind in the city. Only ice creams rolls of different flavours are available. The ice cream is made from scratch on a frozen surface and then turned into a sundae. We had the dark chocolate which was delicious and the butter crunch butter scotch which was also good but could have had a better flavour. The place is located right beside Baskin Robbins of Prince Anwar Shah Road.
