Situated very close to RDB Boulevard,this small joint is ideal for office goers who look for quick tummy filling bites,and not compromise on the oil intake.Visited this place a couple of times.Absolutely in love with Lebanese Chicken Wrap,Chicken Calzone and Grilled Panini bread with Pesto Chicken.The prices are very reasonable.

Very close to my office. So went their with my friends. We tried Lebanese wrap, Mexican wrap which cost 40-45 but tasted good. I loved their sandesh cake. Chocolate mousse and chocolate pyramid was also good. We got complementary fruit cake there which was really nice in taste.

Winter time is the Cake & Pastry time. You will hardly find any person, who doesn't love to have cake! The best part about the cake is, you will get plenty of option over a single thing and everybody loves it. So when a cake lover like me, find some new cake & pastry store, it becomes hard to resist to visit the store.

The shop have multiple outlet across the city and this brunch located in Saltlake Sec V near RDB cinemas just opp to FBB. Now a hard things to find it out. Visit this outlet during the Puja time with bunch of my cakelover friends.

The items we tried were -

1. Pujo Themed Edible Topper Addition Pastry - Chocolate cake with little puja special design on top, which includes - Sankha, Dhaak etc.

2. Sandesh Cake Roll - Vanilla flavoured cake with multiple layers of cream in between it. The Upper part was coated with Sandesh flavour and raisins on the top.

3. Blueberry Crumble Pie - Tart shaped desserts with full blueberry jam filling at inside. Have a bite and the jam literally burst out in your mouth.

4. Rainbow Mousse - Multi coloured mousse with multiple layer in between.

5. Mishti Doi Mousse - Cream mousse is very common things but keeping that mousse touch with bengali tradition is really something worthy trying. The mousse was stuffed fully with sweet card and  rose petals on top..Nice eye catching item.

6. Banana Blossom Puff - Baked and crunchy puff with 'mocha' (Banana flower) flavour from inside. Love it.

7. Prawn Vol-N-Vault - Another baked item with Prawn filling. Get little bit of surprised by such kind of infusion, but it was worthy trying.

8.  Blueberry Cheese Sandwich - Sandwich with full cheese filling from inside and blueberry jelly on top. Nicely crafted and good in taste.

9. Triple Chocolate Cake Sandwich - The ultimate desire for all chocolate lovers. Chocolate bread with full tight fillings of chocolate. Devine for any chococake lover.

In conclusion I will say the store offers you some great infusion about cake, which you generally will not get from ordinary cake shop. Price tags are little bit towards higher side but the items are worthy trying.

I stumbled upon this bakery on a food-delivery app while craving for something sweet after dinner.

Ordered for an eggless addiction pastry and an eggless black forest pastry.

The eggless black forest pastry(2.5/5) didn't taste nice at all.The sponge cake wasn't fluffy,the cream was stiff,the cherries were too tart and there wasn't enough frosting to make it melt-in-the-mouth.Also it didn't taste quite as fresh.

The eggless addiction pastry (4/5) on the other hand was a complete winner,a chocoholic's dream-come-true.Really decadent and delicious.

At an average price of 55 rupees per pastry,I was expecting a little more.

A hit and a miss, mixed feelings for this one.

Tried the Sandesh Cake and the Cheese Puff. The cake was absolutely awesome. What I liked was that the Sandesh flavor was not overpowering and the cake had the creaminess and texture to stand on it's own. Cheese Puff was pretty good too.

A small bakery in the heart of sector V. Cake and Bake is run by Payel Sil, and she is quite a wizard in the kitchen. I tried the following :

1. Chocolate Truffle and Jamdrop Cookies : I loved these cookies. They were crisp, tasteful and quite frankly awesome ( Yes, the Barney Stinson kinda awesome) .

2. Chocolate Muffin : This is how I look my muffins; not too many flavours , subtle with a hint of chocolate.

3. Fudge Brownie : Soft, buttery and sweet. Loved it.

4. Jam Coconut Swiss Roll : While I'm not a coconut person when it comes to desserts these were quite delicious.

5. Chocolate Truffle Boat : I saved the best one for the last. This is a definite must try. It's dense, it's creamy, it's sweet - Heaven !! 

Loved everything about the place. :)

Have been to this fledgling bakery and I must say that the taste of grub here is very refined. The one in the photograph I attached is absolutely heaven. I can't recall the names (sort of cake sandwiches-caramel & chocolate), but the caramel one is a treat for those who want to relish something sweet but not sugary. It is perfectly balanced.

Cake and Bake is a small space indeed but the tastes they promote will fill your heart.

I would only expect that while ensuring good taste, the presentation is also looked into which is certainly not bad but can be dramatically improved.

Will visit again next time I am in Kolkata.

If you’re on a diet then we suggest you look away now – there is some serious temptation ahead. A new dessert shop opened up in Sec V near RDB that is serving cakes, cookies, pastries and various baked items. The independent business has been set up by Mrs. Payel Sil. “I started my cake Joutney a long ago by doing some homemade cakes – just for friends and family. From there the temptation of  serving Quality Cakes and bakery Items to public had grown up and this business is just the little footstep towards it” – Mrs. Payel Sil (Owner)
