Yum Yum Food Corner is near to Bank of India crossing. This place is less decent looking place with average quality dishes. I have visited here for Chowmine and Rolls and both were average. Nothing much likeable that will call you back here again.
Prices are okay.

Yum Yum Food Corner is located very near to my place. Visited here one or two time long before. Surprised to see it on Zomato.
I have tried their Rolls, their Chowmine nothing here is Yummy, had a bitter experience I must say. Noodles here are same as some roadside seller. Thin Noodles served with very less Chicken and a lot of poor salad above and also low quality sauce.
Same was the experience with the roll. Very very average quality. Oily and the Paratha was thin and inside was full of onions, cucumber, and tomato and chilli sauce.
I decided not to visit here again after I had the Chowmine here.

Yum Yum, as the name might suggest, isn't yummy in any definition. A small eating joint with minimal seating capacity fails to attract the masses. Been in operation for more than a year, the customer base didn't catch up, but, I would say it rather declined.
They serve various food items ranging from rolls to momos, and nothing quiet tastes right. The parathas aren't edible to be very honest. Momos lack great deal of everything. Putting up a shop and designing with glazy tiles doesn't make it successful. Even roadside vendors around the area, which aren't even listed on Zomato, serves way better food than it. I am hopelessly disappointed.
