This was a place back in my childhood days i would visit and have biryani and rolls and i loved it back then because thats the only place i would eat outside in those days, but now when i go back when i have developed some better taste buds then i somewhat kind of find it okay. But price wise i would say say it is still not bad. Do try tandoori and biryani here which is worth th price

It's one  of those shanties in tiljala area that caters to the  otherwise option less people living around kustia more.The food is sometimes worse than you can make at home.They offer chinese food,which are less food than they are chinese.I tried their egg chicken fried rice,chilli chicken,chicken pakora,etc,and trust me,you don't want to order from them as long as you haven't run out of all other options. Also,if you order home delivery,check the bill against their menu card.They tend to mess it up badly.

I stay near suruchi. When ever at night I want to eat something spicy I go for suruchi. I like chicken so I tried all chicken preparations but all tested the same.

While not something extraordinary, this has been my go-to place for evening snacks for almost 10 years now. I make it a point to eat from here every time I visit Kolkata. It does help that this place is a stone's throwaway from my parents' place. The quality has been consistent over the years and as I mentioned earlier, although nothing extraordinary, this place has always satiated my evening hunger pangs.  I would recommend the rolls, chops and their Chinese items. Light on the pocket and absolutely fine with me as far as taste is concerned. I've had far worse rolls and chops and cutlets for four times the price back in Delhi/Noida. Wish there was something like this back home.
