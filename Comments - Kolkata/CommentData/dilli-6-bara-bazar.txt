If small joints should enjoy popularity then let this be the epitome of it.. had to have their afghani chicken after it got featured in t2 during the month of ramzaan.. had it the next day they got featured.. snd needless to say how sinfully great it was

A very small food joint serving very good quality food. Apart from the festive season the place generally remains scarcely populated. Very pocket-friendly please. Please do visit if you are a real food lover.

Dilli 6 is a small joint at Zakaria street, which becomes fully operational during Ramdan days. In regular days it's empty, a few customers and you may miss it. But during Ramdan it turns a powerful production house of chicken fry, chicken kebab, biriyani, afgani chicken and many more. 

So it's not your regular food joint, but they serve real good food stuffs during festive days.

Its opposite nakhoda masjhid. I went there today it was really crowded. Girls and boys be careful when you walk around that place. Its ramzaan month so lots of people went there to eat and celebrate. We tried chicken malai kabab. Its was AWESOME. The flavours were bombarding in my mouth. 1 plate costs 180/- for 6 piece. But you wont get any seat there as its packed all the time. Will go there again.
