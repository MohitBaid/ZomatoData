One of the best Street Food joint in South Kolkata. Hakka Noodles are delicious, and Gravy Noodles as well. No seating facility, apart from that, the food served is quite amazing. Mini Hut comes as a Quick Bite joint, with cheaper rates but decent food. Try sometimes if you want to have a Street Food taste.

I had ordered mixed chowmein and chilli chicken for take-out; both the items were below average, to say the least. I concluded it was a total waste of money, and wondered how they have been doing business for all these years.....I suppose their prime location could be the sole reason.

Well, on my way back from school, I visited this place. Have been passing by this shops for the last 2 years, but during off-timings . It was 6.10 p.m. when I was passing-by and I ordered 1 Chicken F. Rice and 1 Chicken Spring Roll, got it packed. Quantity is not okay as per the price because for more or less the same price, we get a box full on the other footpath of RashBehari Avenue side a few yards away. It was Chicken F.Rice but to my surprise there was no Chicken at all, hardly found 2-3 thin strips. The rice was tasteless as well, and the looks weren't good either. The Chicken Spring roll's covering was not well cooked on the inside and on the outside, it was very wobbly. If its a spring roll, I expect it to be a bit crunchy, when they fry it just before serving. The Chicken inside was under-cooked and chewy with a bit of onions and other stuffing. I got the smell of raw chicken from the inner part. Will try out their other dishes someday if I pass-by during the opening hours. It was not filling either, together.

I love this place very much. I went with my friend and ordered "mix gravy noodles" with " dry chili chicken".I went many times there and had the food. The food was very good. This is very pocket friendly. Seating arrangement is not there but still I would love to go again and have the food.

The price of the food is very pocket friendly .
Quality and quantity both are very good .
I went with my parents there we ordered 3 plate chicken hakka noodles and 1 plate mix gravy noodles and two plate chilli chicken.
It tastes awesome.

This is a street food outlet at Deshapriyo Park . Ambience wise there is not much to talk about though quite a few had lined up to have food there. We  ordered for mixed chow which included  egg & chicken which were in good proportions. But the chow itself was not very good . It was very dry & tasteless . They also have moglai paratha , roll etc. but I haven't tried them so can not comment on them .

The only suggestion would be not trying anything else from here apart from their hakka noodles or the fried rice.
The other stuffs like the fish kabiraji, cutlet were too bad.. dry, bland.
The outlet looks equally shabby, but considering its a roaside joint, I'll ignore that.. 
Not happy as such.

A small street side stall and if you dont mind tasting some superb but affordable Chinese give this place a try. I have tried their mixed noodles both hakka and gravy style and loved it. The only negative thing is, no sitting area, just a couple of plastic stools on the pavement. But dont let that stop you from trying out their Chinese. Kolkata boasts of some amazing street foods and this place is surely one of them

Chowmin chilli chicken is te staple there ...along with kabiraji and roll...certainly not the best street food joint in the area but still I love the food there...it takes me back to days when my grand mother used to buy me chowmin from.there and how we enjoyed it thoroughly.... If u ever pass by try it out...it would make you sad atleast..

Well I'm going to be honest. This street joint serves pretty good street food. Well, it's a street joint for a reason right? I'm not even going into the ambience or hygiene quotient or anything, but this place will provide you with sumptuous meals if you're looking for it.
Staying very close to this place I've ordered food on the go from here more than fifty times I'm sure. 
I stick to basics - Egg Hakka chow or mixed fried rice. They've never botched it up and the quantity is good too. And I can totally vouch for the quality. Good quality stuff, never caused any trouble.
So on the whole a very ordinary place which can satiate your chow craze at just 30 bucks.

I think the 1/1.5/2 ratings need to be revised.
People should not be expecting Park Street Restaurants level noodles in this street joint (for as low as 30 bucks).
I live in this area; I have been noticing this place while crossing the area. As evident; the low prices attracted me.
So I have had their chicken hakka noodles; boneless chilli chicken and sweet and sour chicken. My friend tried the gravy noodles.

As for the hakka noodles; it is like any other street stall (like the ones near AC Market or Allen Park). The quantity was sufficient for one person.
I read many complaints about their chicken. Fortunately; my experience, both the times, werent too bad!!

My friend didn't like the gravy in the gravy noodles though!!

The place is good for those times when you dont wanna spend much; yet wanna have some cheap and street-y chinese :)

Mini Box is a live example of degradation. 
The 1 rating is also not appropriate and I doubt why Mini Box is featured in Zomato.
Serving a chicken noodle with few shredded pieces of chicken as toppings and a half boiled noodle with improper salt is absolutely baseless. 
There are other street shops which makes a better food.

Mini box prepared a decent chilli chicken and a chowmein at one time.Now a little foodie investigation revealed a change of hand by the owner some years back and disaster struck.This eateries location commands a daily clientele football immune to Zomato ratings.And they can afford to offer the apologies of stuff they call chicken and prawn and the rest.

Location: Diagonally opposite Tamarind Restaurant.

This joint has been here for a long time serving street-style chowmein and rolls. Being a lover of of street-style preparations, dropped by to give this place a try. The place has a seating (plastic stools) for five to six heads on the pavement itself.
Wasn't quite in a mood to have a roll, called for a plate of Chowmein (Hakka style) which was served in a couple of minutes.

- Chowmein (Hakka Noodles)
The noodles was perfectly boiled and tossed with fresh veggies only i.e lacked adequate salt and had no seasoning in it. Tasted completely bland.
Tried adding soy sauce, chilli in vinegar and chilli sauce (kept in containers) in proportionate balance to make it edible enough. But, alas... failed.

Prices were pretty cheap and definitely in tune to the quality served.

Overall a disastrous experience.
- People can give this place a miss.
- I wonder what makes this place flocking with people. Definitely cannot be the Chinese preparation; is it the rolls? Yet to try them out, comment due.

Mini box is a saviour.... Whn u feel ur pockets are almost empty bt ur tummy needs to be pampered a bit with an average quality food, this is a place to be. 
This place was highly popular for their food during ninties as far as i have seen in my childhood, flocks of people hobbling around specially office hours or evening. 
People giving bad reviews must keep in mind that this place has served Kolkatans with Chinese food when the concept of restaurant was only limited to having biriyani nd chicken chaap. Now we have a lot of cuisines to choose over with innumerable food joints with good quality food. But it is really sad that mini box instead of upgrading for the sake of competition they r still serving the same quality of food as wat they served before. 
Anywz cming towards food..... I visited this place quiet often earlier... The price is very pocket friendly but the quality fits just right in according to the price. The gravy chowmein is simply shit.. I never had such a disgusting dish ever.. Though the Hakka nd boneless chicken r quiet edible. The rice they serve is of poor quality nd the preparations r even poorer. Well u can have rolls just like any other street food joint, they r ok. The side dishes tastes almost the same whether its chilly or Manchurian or hot garlic. 
If u r planning to have food frm here.. Pls stick to Hakka chow nd chillicken boneless dry. Pls Don't Experiment. 
I gave 2.5 bcoz once I loved this place bt now I don't even feelhave anything frm here.

how probably can someone serve such horrible food for so long? do they never taste their own food? 
ok.... tried their chicken chow during pujo.... another mistake. we were dumbfounded at their callousness.!!! you call that chicken??? or some drizzzzzzling of threads on a bland bundle of chowmein??? ??
simply horrifying experience. not at all recommended if u love your money and sympathise your taste buds.

I've been a fan of MiniBox. U cannot actually call it as a resturant. Its a food joint. If u dont have any headache about appearance, then its worth a shot. I dont think you will get chinese food at such  UNBELIEVELY cheap rates anywhere inKolkata.. My favourite item here is  the Gravy noodles, which is I think the most tastiest gravy noodle I have tasted. Quality is above average and the food is fresh. Quantity is good (as long as u consider the rates).  The biggest disadvantage is that there ia almost no seats and the tools provided as quite weak compared to people with higher BMI.

The problem with mini box is that they do not have seating options and the rickety stools kept on the footpath often fail under the weight of people,uhhh,let's just say above the ideal BMI.
You pack the food home and often the pink flimsy rope they use to tie their boxes leach colour which gets soaked through the paper boxes onto the food. 
Used to eat here after tuition on days when my pocket used to be emptier than a Monday Morning Multiplex Show. Glad that those days are over. Period.

The food here tastes horrible. It's basically a street side shop, but since they have a proper setup they charge more. 
The noodles are basically boiled first, then the fry up whatever type you want - egg, chicken, etc. and finally they top it off with a pre made gravy. I gotta tell you that they make the gravy when they open up the shop and keep serving the same thing over and over again.
Same goes with the side dishes. Do not have food from here if you are the least concerned about your health.

I literally once found a COCKROACH in the noodles. A freaking cockroach!!!

Why doesn't Zomato have a negative rating :(

Quite surprised to see Mini Box on Zomato very frankly! This place is not really a restaurant and you can sit on the stools they provide on the footpath smelling the aroma of drains and the DKS washroom...errmm. Its best to pack your food. A plate of boneless chilli chicken and chicken chowmein (gravy) will come for under Rs 100. Now that's quite unimaginable isn't it! They also make rolls but I am not too fond of them.

Its located  right at the sarat bose road/rashbehari avenue junction....deshapriya park to be precise, mostly frequented by students. They are open from 1PM and most of their stuff get exhausted by 9PM. If you are passing by, don't care much about hygiene, love to sit by the pavement and hog your heart out, and want some really cheap chinese food....this is the place to be.

Mini Box...is not a proper restaurant but their food quality is good. It is located beside DKS,after some shops. Half of the time it remains crowded and timing is from 11:30 to almost 9:00 pm.  The chicken rolls are very scrumptious here followed by chicken snacks. Staffs are always busy with cooking and that outlet is really mini like a box. This place is half od the time filled with college student and office workers. Pricing is really very reasonable but i disliked their fish finger. No special ambiance but according to me its dirty. I rarely visit there and sometimes take away too. Whenever i pass through there i keep on seeing the crowd of mini box and i would suggest you to visit there if you are not picky cause you may also not like their food quality....Overall had a satisfactory experience. I will rate 2/5 for them
