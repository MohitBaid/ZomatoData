This small roadside joint is a good for takeaway and specializes in chinese items. Prices is pretty cheap and food quality though was a certain recommendation in the past, has certainly gone down a bit as of now. try their mixed friend rice and chilli chicken whoch are their strong points. But customisation according to your tastes is the key here as they tend to add strong spices in the cooking.

Rolls are one of the most sold items in any place.. this place has one of the best chicken rolls with barbequed chicken nd caramalized onions(no sauces).. their fish finger will make you come again.. momos are very fulfilling and tasty.. prices are fairly reasonable.. Chinese chicken and vej items are nice.. Indian items are ok..

Small joint for takeaways and outdoor sitting is available. They serve both Indian dishes and Chinese dishes. I have tried almost everything from this food joint. My personal favorite is non veg tarka with roomali roti and crispy chickens..
I would like to request the management team to check with the rolls,as the parantha becomes chewy after 5 mins..
Thanks .

Located on the CIT Road this eatery offers you chinese and some indian delicacies. Mainly a take away joint with a few seating arrangements, this place is really what value for money stands for. Portions are good and taste is fine as well.

The place is right next to my home, and if you don't want to cook, the place is best, as it is so affordable.
The best thing I like about this place is they serve you food, just cooked and hot.
The place is quite crowded in evening.
I am in love with the Manchurian here, you get a good amount and amazing taste for just Rs 40.
You can have your dinner or lunch here in just 50-60 Rs.

Price- great. The price is great for when you get a quick craving but you do not want to spend much.
Quality- good enough for the price.
Service time- quite fast.
Must try- Rolls, parathas, rumali roti, chilly chicken, garlic chicken, kebabs.
Mostly a take away place.

As the saying goes, do not judge a book by its cover... Similarly, do not judge a restaurant by its shabby exteriors or glossy interiors... Just stick to the food... It is priced at almost nothing and just delicious... And the quantities are insane for the price... Try their gravy noodles, hakka noodles, mixed fried rice and you won't repent... And the rolls they serve are outstanding... Try their double egg roll, double chicken double egg roll and you would come back for more... Mostly a takeaway joint, do not expect too much and you won't be disappointed...

very small place hardly 4 to 5 people can eat at a time, and the quality of food is not so good, when you have no where to go then only come here, and please don't ever taste the moglai, It is the worst kind of moglai, i could not even recognise it as a moglai. Roll and chowmin is average though.

It's a small fast food centre near my house. I go there very frequently to have some evening snacks. Whether it's a chicken roll or chicken momo or mixed fried rice they are of great taste and of good quantity. I like to have their chicken chowmin with gravy if I am very hungry. The price is fairly reasonable. But,the sitting arrangements are very less.
It's a great place to have snacks for the people living near beliaghata...

This is one place you must not visit unless you are about to collapse with hunger and every other place around are closed or will never open or something. The momos are dry, the sauce is pathetic, the chow is tough and chewy, the rolls are only half decent and don't get me started on the lachha parathas. Have been unlucky enough to have eaten here quite a few times due to its close proximity to my college, but I'd advise you to stay off it.

Mainly during the pujas, it's a must for me and my friends to try the low priced rolls available here and I haven't suffered any kind of stomach so I won't doubt the hygiene thought the place looks a bit dirty :P. I often buy rumali-roti from here and it's not that bad. Affordability is the main plus point of this place. :)

Okay, if you are really hungry around CIT more, in beliaghata, and if both drumstick and dinner house are closed on that day and if "amantran"- the evening street cafe is also not opened by that time, you may try greasy, oily, interesting Tripti. Noodle was previously okay for sometime, but with the change in their kitchen and "CHEF" (the so called "mistri"), now it simply sucks. Paratha and tarka are okay but with too much red pepper, which I simply dislike. The only thing I found good here now a days are their rumali roti. Anyway, one of the 5 famous joints around CIT more.

Pros :
- Hygienic
- Clean
- Food pricing is justified and within reach
- Food quality and quantity is worth the price
- An array of items on the menu to choose from
- Service is good

Cons :
- The place is way too small
- Gets overcrowded easily
- Quality of sauces served as condiments with the food is bad (I would recommend to avoid the sauces)
- The place looks hazardous, with a gas cylinder right beside the stove, where rumali rotis are made there
- Small booths are present on both side in the inside of the restaurant to place your plate on and eat. Not very comfortable
- Non-AC considering the price that you're paying there for your food
- Ambience is very bad

Conclusion :
Food quality and quantity is worth the price. Only suitable for take-away. Not a place to sit and dine

Many claim this place makes good momos. However, on the three separate occasions I have had the momos here, they were pathetic, and the sauce served with it was a joke... way too sweet and a mix of some chilli and tomato sauce at best.. Not a place i would recommend at all.
