Predominantly all the restaurants and eat-out places at bangur are pure vegeterian as this place is an unofficial territory of marwaris. Bonfire is no exception. If u take the entry from jessore road, its around 5 minutes walk and located on the road at your left hand side.
We were searching for a cheap yet tasty snacks place this afternoon to have some sandwitches and cold coffee a d this was a bang on hit on to that. We ordered for one aloo tikki cheese burger, one cold coffee and a blueberry squash. All the items were very nice, standard in quantity and quality.
The place doesn't have much sitting space, few tools are available and being a non-ac open space, a lot of flies were inside. I think they should put at least a fly catcher machine.
Swiggy supported, card payment not accepted but you can use paytm.

A regular cafe with decent food quality and taste at budgeted prices.
Try the veg pizza, bonfire special pasta and slicy vada pao. I think its better than pepperz in many aspects but needs more improvement to survive in long run.

Ordered from Bonfire today. Not at all satisfied. I had ordered for a Bonfire Special Pizza, Bonfire Special Pasta and a Paneer Tikki Burger. The burger and pizza were lame. The pasta was still okay, but nothing close to "good" or delicious. Nothing but waste of money. Quantity is sufficient, but nothing close to quality food.

Most disgusting food in the whole Bangur area. In a place where there are so many food joint how can these people even think of serving food to their customer like this.  Pepper is just in any case far better than any other joint.  Had ordered a vada pao n cheese garlic bread it was stale and horrible to taste will not visit foe the second time nor will recommend to anyone

Tried 'bonfire' located in bangur avenue on 03/03/2017 after a meeting at a nearby place. It a small outlet serving a good varieties of food n drinks at a reasonable price.
Tried Italian Vada Paw. It was Vada Paw with Italian twist by adding cheese and mayonnaise. Taste was good but felt the traditional Vada Paw is always great. Service was quick.
Overall average place.Will not go only for trying this place. May go for quick snacks in this place.

Staffs are nice and polite.  Service is good.  We had pasta,  pizza and garlic bread.  Pasta and garlic were awesome in taste but pizza was average.  Ambience is mesmerizing and items are perfectly priced.  Value for money :)
