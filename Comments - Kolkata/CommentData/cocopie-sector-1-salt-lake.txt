The entire experience I had with cocopie right from order to delivery was really great.The owner Shalini needs a special mention.She made the entire process so smooth.I just whatsapp-ed her my requirements and she suggested me a design accordingly.I picked up the cake from her house as the delivery was only restricted to salt lake.The cake was not only one of the prettiest cake I have seen but it was also the best eggless cake I ever had.The design was a delight to look at and exactly as promised.I would highly recommend Cocopie for anyone looking for delicious customised cake.

Cocopie has worked fabulously for me and is my go-to place when I think of designer cakes. It has made all my special ocassions all the more special. The designs are wonderful and the taste is to die for. Try the Chocolate Truffle for sure. There are cakes that look good and then there are the ones that taste good. Cocopie gives you both together. I am pretty choosy with designs and Shalini always makes sure I get the best to my hearts content. Can't think of any other place but this when it comes to making special people feel a little more special.

Ordering cakes from Cocopie has become a routine for me for any occasion, and Shalini has always been so cooperative even at a short notice. We simply love the cakes she bakes and each one has her signature personal touch. More power to you m'lady!

One of the best bakeries in town. I came across Cocopie through a friend's Instagram post and I liked that cake so much that I had to order that cake and I think that was a very good decision I made. Shalini's cakes are too good! Plus the whole process becomes so hassle free, she notes down every little detail and it's all so perfect. I would recommend everyone to try Cocopie.

Cocopie has given me the most memorable birthdays! Or any other occasion for that matter. Cakes are baked to perfection inside and decorated with absolute finesse on the outside. One can understand the amount of heart and soul that has gone into creating the perfect cake for the occasion. Designs are perfect just as you imagined it would be. Cakes are smooth and soft. Buttercream frosting is yum! Cookies are also a must try. Cannot wait to order more. The baker is brilliant.

This is a home bakery, located very close to Bon Appetit in Sector 1, Salt Lake. You can contact the owner via WhatsApp, and order beautiful, custom designed cakes. All the designs are very unique. You can even choose the flavours and frosting according to your liking. The owner is just the sweetest person who'll guide you through the entire process. You'll be spoilt for choices. I ordered four cupcakes each of which had a different theme. And I swear they were the yummiest cupcakes I've ever had! Two of them were chocolate flavoured with chocolate ganache frosting. The other two were were cream fills with whipped cream frosting. Each of them had custom fondant art done on them. And I simply adore the pretty box they came in! It's a pity this place doesn't get more coverage in Zomato.

After browsing through the profiles of several bakery shops in zomato, I came across the cakes of Cocopie. The designs on the cakes were really beautiful and neat. So, I decided to order a 1lb 3 layered ( Vanilla, Butterscotch & Chocolate ) Fondant cake for my Mother's birthday and I was not disappointed! It was very pleasant experience right from placing the order to having the cake. Coming to the cake, it was really delicious and everyone loved it. Highly Recommended!

নানান বিচিত্র ধরনের কেকের অফুরন্ত সম্ভার । এবং খেতেও যথেষ্ট ভালো । বিশেষ করে চকলেট গুলো । তাছাড়া ব্যক্তিগত ভাবে আমি স্ত্রবেরির ভক্ত । ফলে সেটাও ভালই লেগেছে ।

Guys, if you want to taste heaven then this is it. It's there in your town. This little bakery will treat you to the most sinful of desserts- cakes, donuts, cupcakes, cinnabons, shortbreads- you name it and it's there, that too they come in a multitude of flavors, designs, fondants. You don't know what you are missing unless you treat yourself to one of these pleasures. Go grab your share of joy and let your tastebuds decide for yourself! Hats off to the owner of Cocopie Shalini, the warmest and quite a creative entrepreneur! Love Cocopie <3

Today only I had visited in the rotary club exhibition. I just loved their biscuit chocolate. Most of their items were good as in corn salad, schwarma, pasta. They also keep sugar free bakery items. All items were supadelicious, yummy. Owner was making and serving, very courteous.

I shall never forget the wide array of muffins, cupcakes, cakes, pancakes and waffles that you've served me. It's incredible how you make and bake a piece of paradise into a box. I'll keep coming back for more.

If there is something better than cupcakes it has to be cupcakes that you can order online and have it delivered to your doorstep. I placed an order knowing that the minimum buffer time for an order is 1 day. But it was a kind of a cupcake emergency and I needed it to be delivered within 2 hours. I knew it was a long shot but Shalini who is the master behind the start-up, co-operated very politely and had my order ready and delivered to the intended address. Since I was out of town she also arranged for me to have the bill amount wired to her account. I was told that cupcakes tasted phenomenal and was very attractively presented in a transparent cupcake box. Brilliant quality, prompt service and affordable prices, this really is the recipe for success. All the best.
