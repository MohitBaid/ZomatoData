Located beside the Beliaghata main road,this is a very pocket friendly budget biriyani joint.
This is a takeaway counter. No seating available. The taste is average...

Though this Biryani joint quite popular among locals & students....but I didn't found anything special. To me it's just a another biryani shop. Don't expect any quality here.

Nice biriyani..only home delivery...the chicken piece is quite good but the quality of rice is a bit low...still the overall taste is good..perfect for some quick biriyani cravings

Pocket friendly yet good quality biryani. I mean this is like a good takw away joint for Biryani from 24 to 31st of the month...if you know wht I mean.
