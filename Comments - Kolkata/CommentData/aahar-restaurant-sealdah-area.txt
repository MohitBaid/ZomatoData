There isn't much good and clean restaurant for Bengali meal in Sealdah area. I only found this one located near to Sealdah North gate meeting those criteria.

Very old Kolkata style cabin that stays cozy in lunch time beside of having sittings on two sides on two floors. Servers are quick and lots of bengali dishes options they serve from veg to non veg.

I took simple Rice, Dal, Alu Vaja & Katla Fish Curry. Dal was thick that tasted good with rice. Potato was crispy fried to brownish colour. Fish piece was very good and gravy of it tasted really good too.

All this food costs me Rs. 160 that was bit expensive for this simple fish rice lunch. But quality of the food was enough satisfactory.

One of the few good hotels in Sealdah restaurent. Very congested typical hotel feel. Food quality is good but little on the higher side. Once, I have found a dead cockroachnin my vegetables. Though they have chaged the plate but its gives you an idea about the hygiene there. Overall nediocre.

Once tried this place out of tremendous hunger but then realised it would have been better to remain hungry than to eat from this place. We ordered one plate chicken biryani. It tasted just ridiculous. Very bad experience. Unhygienic place. Never recommend anyone to visit.

Food - Typical bengali home made food. Aahar is best for truely bengali ordinary home made food, like machh bhat dal shobji. And thats what i love about this eatery.

Ambience - roadside small hotel. Its near railway station so expect various kind of people.

Service - stuffs are friendly but very busy poeple. Good service, but order takes a little time.

Price - justified with the quality and quantity.

Food, as in for us in general, got so many dimensions. But, when you look at the non-so privileged masses, the food for them is the way to curb hunger and thus seem to prefer the Bengali cuisine of rice, dal vegetables and a something of non vegetarian dish. This is the sole reason this restaurant is still making a hefty income.

Aahar restaurant is a hot spot for dwellers availing the train services for their daily commute and work. Being located on MG Road just at the tip of the flyover, it carries on businesses at rampant pace. The flying customers are the main source of income for this eatery who prefers food solely in form of rice, dal and few other ingredients - nothing more. This is the sole eatery around the near are serving Bengali cuisines and thus get chooses forming a mild monopoly.

The quality of food, like most of the eateries around have had gradually decreased in quality but the prices increased following the trend. The place has a shabby kind of look and one shouldn't expect much from it. The staff and their quality are moderate. The food it serves tries to resemble the type one typical Bengali family gets at it's residence.

I would not recommend this.

Actually nothing to write about this place.... Nothing special.... I went there to have my lunch.... opted for regular Bengali food.... Can't say the food was bad, but nothing special to mention about the food.... I haven't had their Chinese food items.... so, no comments about that.... but according to my experience, the place is nothing but a regular 'Maach-Vaater Hotel'....

While on the way to Sealdah station you can spot the building. The outlet is big and easily to locate. The restaurant is more or less clean. The crowd is something you'll have to adjust to. Tried their rice and chicken only. Prices are good. The food was served since it was cooked and ready!

Whenever I am near sealdah area...I visit this resturant. I don't like too much oily food with lots of spices...like the other restaurants serve. So here I always find the foods like home cooked.

Located in a crowded place near Sealdah station , a pocket friendly place to get homely food. It's a haven for daily passengers.
Its small restaurant, seating arrangements are there though tables were not cleaned properly.
Bengali dishes are fine esp the fish items with rice , dal, Kashmiri alu dum and other veg dishes.

Quality was ok.   Ambience was fine.   Prices were decent.
            
visited this place with my two foodie friends saumik kar and rajdeep bhattacharjee..

Aahar is one of the very famous restaurant for having Bengali foods. And its popularity is spread to all the corners of West Bengal due to its prime location at Sealdha.
Located at the end of Sealdha Flyover this place serves fantastic Bengali food.Try any dish of Fish or Veg dish you will be left with wow.
The restaurant is clean and hygienic and they serve food within 5-10 minutes of your oder.
Rice quality is good and they also keep a good collection of Fishes and Veg items.
If you are looking to have Bengali food at Sealdha do visit this place.
But the Chines dishes that they prepare isn't good at all. I had Chines one and it was a bitter experience. So please avoid Chines
Recommend for Bengali food only.

This eatery brings back quite some memories. Whenever I find myself near sealdah area, I visit this place. It is somewhat of a guilty pleasure of mine.

This place has absolutely nothing fancy about it. Plain food, that tastes like home cooked food( reason why I love this place so much), cheap price, always busy. This place has a great vibe to it that you  find only in 'North Kolkata' . 
Their Chicken and fish dishes are the best. If you ever find yourself visiting this eatery, try their tangra Mach and iilish Mach. You'll be blown away. 
It has been quite sometime since I last visited. But I'm planning to revisit real soon.

It's much better to call this place a pice hotel rather than a restaurant. The regular meals available here are pretty decent at a very good price. Fish meals of different varieties, egg meal, chicken meal are the best selling ones. And oh! How I love the Aamer Chutney over here. It's delicious.

This is not a restaurant, a simple Vater(rice) hotel, always busy and the ambience is very ordinary. But they serve some good Bengali dishes, particularly fish. Simple curry of tyangra fish taste like home cooked food. Vetki paturi is good, even better than that of some over priced popular Bengali restuarant. Chitol machher peti is tasty, though it's too oily. Apart from these they have wide range of  other fish preparation.
They also serves north Indian and Chinese but those are below average quality.
Now hygiene. We usually become conscious about food hygiene and safety when we eat in this type of hotel where the ill maintained kitchen places are open to our vision but in case of a nicely decorated restaurant assurance of food safety is taken as granted. Real fact is not like that. If we take a look of the kitchen place then in many cases it will be found unhygienic in nicely decorated restaurant also. Still I should say that hygiene is not guaranteed here.
In conclusion, for some good fish preparation one can try this place at least once.

A good place to have bengali food....place is clean and food tastes good but there are some cons in the list also...there is no car parking available even in near by area and this place is really costly (they charge 75 rupees for bhat dal alubhaja & posto)....can't comment on their chicken and mutton dishes as never tried those but their fish dishes and veg ones are good enough to satisfy the taste buds...

Well first of all I think this place dont deserve such a low overall rating.This is a place where I have been eating for 7 years. If you want to taste varieties of fish in good taste quality and quantity in a reasonable price then go for it.I wont tell they they serve good chicken dish but this is forgiveable for a semi-restaurant like this one.The try to serve almost all kind of food commonly found in a multi cuisine  restaurant.
This was once a very busy place.Now with days the crowd has decreased.Some of the items has lost its quality but others rose in their place.Overall a neet and good lunch or dining destination in the area.

This is clean, cozy, hygienic place within a budget of the aam-admi. We went at the end of the lunch rush. For that, alu bhaja, veggies were absent along with the plate but all variants of fish and meat were there. Ordered pomphret and tyangra fish. Both of them were made in a complete homely way. Rich in taste but not a punishment to the tummy. Easy to slurp like a bengali way. Never believed in having good bengali food outside home. First experience but a good one to remember.

This Bengali restaurant is the worst that I have come across. It is worse than Maa Kaali restaurant in Paltan Bazaar, Guwahati. The food is very much ordinary. All the items on the menu are overpriced. The whole restaurant is very very dirty and unhygenic. The waiters are very stubborn and run into disputes with each other as well as customers. The owner himself eats in a different restaurant (which shows that even he himself is not confident about the food and its taste). The food is served on broken plates, and over everything, food served is tasteless stale in quality and negligible in quantity. People should stay away from this place.  Restaurants like this pose a threat to the real "ghoroa bangali ranna" serving restaurants. I rate it only because I have to. This place isn't even deserving of a single star.

Its one of the busiest restaurant in Sealdah area. They offer bengali food from Fish and rice (macher jhol bhat) to chicken and mutton preparations. Its always busy and the ambiance is not so good. A bit too dirty compared to others. Its generally filled in by mediocre people who work in that area. Some college students also come here for their lunch. Price is not that much. Service is very prompt. There is a rumor that old food is served but My experience is not that bad here. You can drop by if you wish.

Its all about hustle n bustle n decent bengali food in no time .. Its not a place where u want to indulge urself .. Its a place for a quick bengali meal .. And all varieties of fishes.. If Macher jhol bhaat is all dat u want forgetting about all the niceties dat a gourmet craves for then this is ur place .. 
Food is served instantaneously in a table cramped up for space .. But quality is good n well looked after.. Waiters r v busy but they do tend to ur needs.. 
Price is steep ... I will say a bit too much coz they only look into d food aspect .. Nothing less nothing more .. No attention to how it shud b served n all .. So prices shud hav been more aimed for a regular goer... Pocket pinch for a typical non veg Bengali meal will b around 250-300..
Food quality n taste i wud agn stress dat is decent enuf ..

I will do this with a score up approach i.e. we start with a presumed rating of 0.5, add "0.5 for likes" and "1.0 for super likes" and deduct 0.5 for "super dislikes". No deduction for just "dislikes" as we are starting with a low rating of "0.5" i.e. we are expecting to dislike.

Ambience - First things first - this is not a restaurant. This is a eatery. A standard central Kolkata shop space with a mezzanine floor built in. Crowded, no exclusive tables, no air conditioning, shared tables. It is definitely not the place to take your wife for a romantic dinner or your parents on their anniversary :-) . This is the place where you take co-foodies who thrive on Bong cuisine and can go to the end of the world for a good taste of the same.  Parking is a big hassle - take a cab pls (minus 0.5)

Service - not trained but the 2 main waiters on the ground floor and the helpers (with water, salads etc) do a decent job. Waiting time is next to nil. The main waiters are good with suggestions and cheerful. On the whole likeable. (Add 0.5)

Menu - widest variety of fish possible. None of the more famous Bong cuisine restaurants would be able to match the variety. Rohu, bhetki (curry and paturi), prawn, lobsters, hilsa, chitol, aar, tengra, pabda - you name it, they have it. Chicken and mutton for the meat lovers. The mezzanine also serves biriyani and chaap, just in case. Steamed rice with daal, mixed veg torkaris, dhoka, posto and "jhuri alu bhaja (shredded potato crisp fried) - pretty much sums up the meal. Chutney at the end. No desserts though. The variety is a super like. (add 1.0)

Quality and taste - the rice grains are fine and white. The vegetables are delicious but a bit spicy maybe. The daal and accompaniments are ok. I have tasted four main course dishes here - bhetki paturi, aar jhol (light gravy seasoned with cumin seeds), lobster malaikari and chicken curry. The fish preparations are out of this world. The spice is kept just right and brings out the taste and flavour of the particular fish. The pieces are super large - be it fish or chicken. If you can brave the heat - this is a must experience for any foodie in Kolkata. Super like (add 1.0 for the taste and but I will add another 0.5  for the quality to do justice).

Price - Prices are higher than what you would expect from outside. However, once you have the food, the price seems more than reasonable. Rice, dal, one veg and humongous piece of bhetki fillet in paturi for 175 bucks is a good deal. It is not cheap but definitely VFM. Add 0.5

The rating build up is 3.5 now. 

If I directly compare this place to "Kasturi" on Marquis street, Aahar will be 0.5 ahead on food but minus 1 on ambience, service etc. Kasturi can be fairly rated as 4 and hence 3.5 seems fair for this place.
