Pathetic service ! 
Had to wait half n hour for hookah and approx 48 minutes just for a garlic bread. 

Not worth at all they have degraded their services.

Fully horrible experience. I went to this place with much expectations but I was totally disappointed with kind of service and the food they served. Also the quality of DJ is so poor that people are sleeping. Totally passed ðŸ“´

Bakstage  was one of our favorite hang out space , often visit there with my friends and have even suggested acquainted people to visit the place .But I was so amazed by the behavior of a staff there on 11 Oct that which pushed me to draft a note to get this highlighted as it lead to a very bad experience .On 11oct was there with 6 of my friends , as it was a Sunday so every other individuals were on the dance floor so we thought of doing the same .So when 3 of us started grooving with the music an attendant asked us not to dance as we were male stag's . We were speechless as it was so humiliating and seemed  as if we were misbehaving on the floor . We seek for a clarification as we could see others grooving around might be as a couple or female stag's but didn't receive any justification .So we requested to meet up the Manager but were informed  nobody was available there to give us a clarification .This experience has completely changed my thought process for Bakstage .
