It is said that looks are deceptive - it really is . The dilapidated shop , badly kept interiors will repel you from entering this place but if you conjure up the courage to enter this place then some quality food items will greet you .Visit this place whenever I am at Beltala & feel like having some Kachouri . The Kachouri with dal is simply mouthwatering & quite heavy too . Their famous Rasmundir Payes is also very good . No sitting arrangement is available . Despite all good things about it's food the place definitely needs some renovation .

An old fashioned sweet & snack house on Sarat Bose Road which opted not to change it's ambiance and decor for the reasons better known to them. Surprisingly, the taste of their snacks and sweets have not changed at all. This place delivers one of the best Rosogollas (not of sponge technology thankfully) available in the city and probably the best during the winters, when they make it with jaggery. Kalaakand and Rosomundir payesh are delicious, if eaten fresh. Misti doi is below par. The signature dish though is the Koraishutir (Green Peas) Kachuri which is amazingly tasty and available throughout the day. Cleanliness and storing processes need a lot of improvement, which again aren't the priority of the Management sadly.

Located near Landsdowne Market... Small sweet n few snacks item shop. I tasted their ' Bonde ' 'sita bhog' which tastes not extra ordinary but above average. 
Their veg chop and khasta kachori are average. 
Their kachori (puri) and dal tastes good one should surely try a plate of this in the morning if u pass by this place. 
Pocket pinch is cheap.

As a part of the iconic places to visit I made my sojourn here a couple of days back on an evening having a slight nip in the air.

Since this is my first visit can't compare the earlier standards but am told the place has deteriorated. The place is gloomy and reminds me of another world where time seems to have frozen.

We went for the fun kopir singara. Nothing to honk home about since I have had better stuff elsewhere. The quantity of fulkopi was abysmally low!

The motor shutir kochuri was another disaster which we found ourselves in. Everything was served piping hot though.

The only saving grace was rosomundir payesh - lip smackingly delicious.

A must one time visit of you want to tick off the heritage places in your wish list....

Welcome to Mrityunjoy Ghosh and sons. Ironically, here, most of the sweets are rubbish (except maybe their rasomundir payesh), but the kachori (and radhaballavi at later part of the morning) and phulkopir singhara (in winter) is something to die for. You should have some time in hand. Because, due to some strange reason, they never keep their kachoris ready and always do so whenever you place the order. Wait for 5 minutes and those steaming hot kachoris with a dollop of sweet dal will be handed over to you. Don't wait, pounce on it and tear it in half, dip it in the dal- put it in your mouth. I know its hot but bear with it and feel the orgasm. Whoever says what, don't make the mistake of ordering the aloo sabzi with it and go for the dal. Sheer heaven. The shop is slightly dirty, but who the hell cares ?????

This place used to be good, really good with it's kachoris & singaras but now the standard has gone down so much. The staff isn't well behaved, the quality of the sweets is woeful, the kachoris aren't that good either anymore, they used to serve chana dal earlier which used to be really good but now it's not available anytime. Disappointed.

বাইরে থেকে দেখে যদি কিছু ভেবে থাকেন তবে বলব যে শতকরা নব্বই শতাংশ ভুল ভবেছেন কারন দেখন এর সাথে চাখন এর কনও মিল নেই বললেই চলে । যারা একবার এই কচুরি দিয়ে সকালের টিফিন টা সেরেছেন তারা নিঃসন্দেহে আর  একবার হলেও আসবেন । বিভিন্ন রকম লোভনীয় মিষ্টি মজুত আছে । কচুরি রসগোল্লা দিয়ে টিফিন সারতে পারলে ঘণ্টা দুয়েক নিশ্চিন্ত । এক কথায় কম দামে ভালো খাবারে পেট ভরানোর জন্য একদম আদর্শ জায়গা ।

Located near Landsdowne Market, this is a nice place to find yourself some good variety of sweets. The Kochuri and Roshogolla always seems to be in high demand here. Not to forget some of the excellent array of sweets these guys serve. Do not expect excellent ambiance, because you wouldn't find it here.

The place to go for a taste of Bengali sweets and salty snacks which have only vegetables in this side of Calcutta! 
(apart from the much more expensive, and just not as tasty, Balaram Mullick which is not too far away)
Or the classic moira shop. This shop is one of the better kept secrets in Calcutta.

Although they have some of the worst presentation or marketing of food, and absolutely no pretentious customer-facing counter, going the opposite way to the extent that you might be confused where is the customer sales point at the shop!

(not unlike the probably much older sweet shops in North Central Calcutta near Hedua where one has the likes  of Nakur Nandy, Girish Ch, etc one after the other on that road. Which have all now somewhat improved their presentation style with better lighting, flooring and appearance of cleanliness etc unlike this place. Probably what kept me from risking a rare 5.0 rating for me at this place. )

However,  everything from the singara (samosa) to the radhapallabi, from the malpua to the shorbhaja, everything at this shop tastes  of  a certain authenticity.

First try to stick to the salty savouries like radhapallabi, singara, kochuri though before attempting the very limited range of sweets available here.

Strongly recommend as a must taste for food enthusiasts in this city.

The ambience and the decor of the place gives a wrong impression about the place until one has tasted its CHENA PAESS and GUR Rasogolla. One of the few places in Kolkata where one can get NOLEN GURER CHENA PAESS all though out the year.

The place is very near the Maddox square. It is a very old and small sweet shop. But you can get the best kachauris over here. This is the best place to have some kachauris and rasgulla as breakfast or a little snack.

A rundown sweet shop on sarat Bose road. This shop has been here ever since I can remember and while it is not the cleanest, nor the best it has a few specialities. Its kochuris made in the evening with dal are worth dying for. And its chum chum are something whose tastes never leave your mouth. The ambience is really nice and while the shop could be much cleaner and more hygienic, this is one shop you should visit if you want a taste of old Calcutta.

Really rundown sweet shop.... Will never have sweets from here unless forced or someone pays me well..... But they make an extraordinary sweet called rosho mundir payesh... I can have this anytime... It's an all time favourite and I will venture to say perhaps one of the best things available in south Calcutta with regard to sweets

It is not up to the standard there are many shops who will give you a better quality mishti ( Mithai ). Location is on the Lansdowne Road opposite to Lansdowne Market. Parking of a car is a bit problem.

Will be put off by the outlet which looks 100 yrs old but it is the inside which is real gold. Ordered Chum Chum in bulk, and it was one of the best i have ever tasted. Have equally good Sandesh and other sweets. It also serves Poori sabzi type breakfast which very cheap. Samosas were not great but good considering high bengali standards. This one is must for visitors to Calcuta.

A very old Bengali sweet shop in Sarat Bose Road near Lansdowne market this place has successfully maintained a decent standard over many years.It is quite near my place and I have had almost all of their items since childhood.
It is famous for its radhaballavis.The radhaballavis served with either aloo dum or daal is brilliant especially when hot.They are a tad oily but I guess you would expect that from a small place as this.The chanar payesh here is another excellent item.
But the main attraction of this place lies during winter months when they prepare the fulkopir singara or the samosas with cauliflower and the koraishutir kochuri.They are unique and very very well made.Do give this place a  try during an early winter evening.Its quite worth it.
The prices are quite decent although they have gone up a notch of late.The appearence and cleanliness of the place though leaves a lot to be desired.But still they do offer an old world charm and it is still a place I quite like nonetheless.

Mrityunjoy Ghosh & Sons is located on Sarat Bose Road near Lansdowne Market. On noticing this sweet shop you will probably not like to step in. It's housed in an old building and the owner prefers the old world charm. So you will notice high ceilings and very old display cases. Do not be turned off or misled by all this as the food served from here will make you come back a second time.

The shop is famous for its Radhaballavi with Alur dom or daal. The best time to visit the shop is around 4:30pm when the radhaballavi is fried and served right out of the frying pan. You can choose either the aloor torkari (dry potato curry) or the daal with which the serve the radhaballavi. It's heavenly. Another product which is made only in winters is the fulkopir shingara (cabbage samosa). I have not had had the luck with them as they run out of stocks by the time I manage to reach their shop after work. 

What many people are not aware of is their Roshomundir Payesh. This is nothing but but payesh cooked with gur and has small balls of rosogolla in it. It is simply heavenly. I think the price is 400 bucks a kilo now but it's still worth it. This sweet is served at my house whenever there is a party. Some other popular picks are the mihidana, bonde and the gojas.

This tiny outlet at the corner of Sarat Bose Road and Palit Street had carved a name for itself, for its savouries, especially samosas. Apart from standard offerings like kochuri, radhaballabi etc, I recall the samosas being particularly tasty. It seems to have lost its sheen because on my last visit, the samosas were about pedestrian, with hardly any signs of the pedigree it was known for. Their other sweets etc are strictly okay.

Kolkata is indeed slowly losing places that made the archetypal Bangali Shingara (with phoolkopi in the winter months if you please) well.

Over the last few years this place has been losing its sheen very consistently. And that is very unfortunate because Mrityunjay used to serve some really amazing stuff. Their radha bollobi and aloor dom r still pretty nice. The cholar daal is no more that good and is a bit watered down these days. The khastar kachori is too oily. The biggest disappointment is the phulkopir shingara. This is served just as winter sets in. It was a delicacy a few years back. The last winter I went and bought two shingaras at once. Probably I was over confident that they were still as good as they used to be. I was rather disappointed that evening. Occasionally, though I still go back for the radha bollobi and aloor dum. 
If you are hungry and want to grab a bit without paying much and happen to be in the Lansdowne/ Bhawanipur area you may consider stepping in but don't have much expectations.
