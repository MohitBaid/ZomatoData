Located on the right side of the entry of Chowrasta Bazar - a take away joint, Visited couple of times to grab biriyani and chilli chicken. The quality of biryani rice is just okish and rates are pocket friendly. Service is very slow.

This place is a roadside take away joint which provides you some good quality food at reasonable prices. I tried their Egg roll which was great in taste. The paratha was thick and tasty. Everything was good about it. So a 3.5 for it.

Located in Chowrasta bazar, there's nothing special about this place. Good for a quick bite and service is quick. Their chicken curry should be tried and biriyani should be avoided.

This place is located right at the entrance to the Chowrasta Bazar, from Diamond Harbour Road, at the Chowrasta Bus Stop. Firstly I am quite surprised that this road side food stall (its not even a proper restaurant), got a mention on Zomato. I come by this place every day yet I have only tried their food once, since the place does not look quite hygienic. A lot of people have an evening snack at this place and they prepare everything from Biriyanis to Chinese fried rice and chowmins. They have a lot of options to try from. There isn't a proper place to sit so one might have to stand and eat.

I had their Aloo Biriyani, which at that time cost me around â‚¹45/- so it was pretty cheap. The quality was alright and nothing special as you would expect from such a place. The quantity was quite good for the price but the Biriyani was slightly oily. 

I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you are passing by and want a quick snack at a really cheap price. Even though they have recently repainted the place it still looks unhygienic. There are Sugar & Spice and Mio Amore right around this place so you should safely go there and avoid this place unless you absolutely want to have Chowmin or Biriyani.

We have been trying this place recently due to close proximity from home. It is a take away place.  Definitely recommend the Biryani- it is awesome. For long, we have been fan of Haji but finally there is someone in behala to rival haji's biryani. Unfortunately in the menu card over here, biryani is not reflected. Anyone who prefers to take away biryani for comfort eating at home should try this.It is really good and at a reasonable price - chicken @90 and mutton @ 100.
