The most pocket friendly bar & restaurant in it's locality, with some delicious starters and few great main course in offer. Tangri kebabs and Chicken lollipop are the best among the starters, and the Thai green fried rice is a fresh new recipe that will definitely appeal to rice lovers. Apart from it, a nice place to visit with friends and have a drink and chill out.

This place is Kalikapur is pretty big. There food quality is good and so is the service. For starters we tried the chilli babycorn and mushroom which was really spicy and lip-smacking. A must try for anyone who is up for spicy dishes , plus good to go with booze. For main course we tried Shanghai Chicken and Chicken Friedrice. The rice was okay..but I was a tad bit disappointed with the chicken as it had cashew nuts in it, which is a big no no for me. 
Overall, my experience here was good. Hope to go soon and try the other dishes.

I Went To This Place Spice Of Joy, Kalikapur For The 12th Time On 12.12.2017 To Celebrate Yuvraj Singh's 36th Birthday And To Celebrate New Zealand's Test Match Victory Over West Indies 2-0. That Day I Ordered 1 Sammi Kabab Roll And 1 Mixed Fried Rice. Both Were Awesome And Delicious As Well. Thank you Spice Of Joy For Making My Day Awesome.

I always went to this place whenever I have some work in south kolkata. One of the cheapest bar in south kolkata and best place for hangout with friends or family. Chicken Tandoori and chicken reshmi kebab are my favorite dishes.

Dissapointment to another level.
I dont understand why zomota timing doesnt match resturant timing. The staff are so horrible. Behaviour is so bad that food automatically taste horrible. Definitely not a family place neither a place to have a decent dinner.. anyway goodluck to people heading towards this place..

Really like this place a lot. Visited this place several times. They provide good food & alcohol at reasonable price. The quantity of the food is enough for two. Ambience is nice.  Will surely recommend it.

Went on last Friday(Navami of Durga puja) at 12:30am. We were six heads(2 families). Very luckily got a table within 15 minutes which is quite unlikely on a puja night. Hence we were a little sceptical about the quality of food and service. To my surprise the experience was quite nice. We were there till 2:30am. In comparison to many other restaurants who compromise on quality and quantity of the food, these people have served it well and so was the drink, however ambience was quite average. I would say, do not go with a very high expectations like speciality restaurants. This is more like an average restaurant with standard food and drink at reasonable price.

Affordable place with an okay kind if ambience and quality food, you won't find anything out of the ordinary though which would be worth mwntuoning separately. The service has been found to be good as well. The location of this place makes it better as there would be no other place offering booze with quality food between Kalikapur to Jadavpur PS.

I do not know why this place has got such a poor rating, but I've got some good stuff to say about this place.
Since I've visited their dine-in only once(ambience is quite good), I shall only talk about their takeaway.
Their takeaway is so so good,really fast with a whole range of options to choose from. I have had so many things from here- rolls,kebabs,rotis,Chinese dishes but the ones I'm going to specially talk about are-
Tandoori chicken and chicken bharta. We order these two dishes very frequently and taste is superb.
Once again, really commendable takeaway service.

One of the most affordable Restaurant cum Bar in south Kolkata... If you want to have a drink at 10% cheaper rates than usual Bars, then this is your place... I visit the place quite often... Their Kadhai chicken dish, fish finger, kebabs, Biryanis could be very good choices... Chinese dishes are Mediocre.. overall a pocket friendly Restaurant cum Bar with quality food to offer...

This is for the take away counter located below the restaurant. They serve pretty nice fast food. Their kebabs are awesome. The fishfrys momos chili chicken and friedrice is also tasty. But you cant expect good quality fish from them but the price makes up totally for it! Their rolls are not too tasty but the mughalai paratha an absolute winner!! The locals thrive on this place for their daily supply of tasty fast food at cheap prices.

Place is fine when pocket is really tight. Was a common place among the teenagers once upon a time. Do try the Thai chicken. Needs to start thinking about the ambience. Also the area where you seat out with your family needs development as well.

After one type of quitting from Bangalore and coming back to kolkata, with tremendous bad health condition i was not ready to go any where...My bff Kaushick took me to this outlet for some changes..we reached there at 8:30pm, ofcourse it was opened..we went to the first floor,and ordered some hard drinks,unfortunately nothing were there,only tuborg!! i am not very fond of Tuborg...whatever...we ordered two starter dishes..dry chilli chicken & chicken reshmi kabab...we were gossiping a lot as we met after a long day..reshmi kabab became cold,they again made it hot and served,nice attitude of service men.

In a main course we ordered one fried rice and one hot garlic chicken...it was already 11:00 pm...quantity and quality both were very good..we completed our dinner and left @ 11:30 pm..till that time the ambience of this bar cum restaurant was nice...we enjoyed the dinner very much with a bucket full of gossip of last 5 months..

i will definitely revisit this outlet.

The easy on pocket joint of south Kolkata is a great watering hole. Contrary to the prices, the food is not cheap at all and can give some good places a run for their money! Overall, good place for a quiet drink. Must try Fish Finger and pan fried chilly chicken.

It is located on the Naskar Para stoppage of the EM Bypass Jadavpur thana connector. The place looks shabby from the outset with a side entrance which leads you to the three floors of the restaurant through the small staircase. One floor serves hookahs and mainly attracts young crowd. The rest of the floors are typical tipplers paradise with one dedicated family section on the right corner of the staircase. I had heard mediocre reviews about the place was bit sceptical initially but some of the dishes I had ordered were good and upkeeping with expectations. The drinks are decently priced and so is the food. We had ordered for Crispy chilly baby corn & crispy chicken as starters. The baby corn was not that crispy but tasted good tossed in sauce and wrapped in seasum seeds. Crispy chicken had 8 chunks of chicken batter fried & was decent. My friend had ordered for a boiled peas masala which is a must try. The fresh lime soda was good enough to add to the party. I was in a hurry had to parcel the dinner. I saw Egg Tarka on the menu of a restaurant after long and instantly ordered it. The dish was good with decent amount of fried egg chunks & the tarka dal was apt as far as spices were concerned. The paneer butter masala was average and had  7-8 pieces of paper cooked in an yellowish gravy. This item could have been much better at least they could improve on the size of the paneer slices. The tandoori rotis were nicely crafted & foil wrapped preventing air passage & weren't unnecessarily burnt towards their back side. The peas polau was best of the lot & ha9d huge quantities of peas & rice. An average joint that promises to do good business with lack of competition around. If you are looking for a quick round of drinks accompanied by tasty food & can do away with the ambience,then Spice of Joy is surely what the doctor ordered for.

One of the worst restaurant I have ever visited. Awful food. Disgusting staffs. You have to buy mineral water,theres no scene of regular water,which is illegal now a days. Even the movie halls provide you with free water,but this restaurant doesn't. They gave us food which we didn't order and when we complained they said we have to pay for it also. Awful experience.

Do not come with very high expectations but this place is definitely a great place to hang out for a group of old friends.

Getting an alcohol place near kalikapur is not easy so spice of joy is stealing the show for the last few hears. The first floor is mostly for family but you can get your drinks here or the floor above. 

Service could be a little slow but this place is within your budget and the staff is sweet

The name suggest Spice doesn't mean their foods are spicy. Their food is really good at low price. The shop is located the opposite of The Howrah Bridge Restaurant the EM Bypass Connector that connects from Jadavpur PS. 
I order and tasted Biryani and Chicken Chow from this shop and the taste was really good. The quality is also good and even the quantity they serve at this price is much more than other shops. 
It's a great shop must taste some food from this place.

Did not live up to my expectations. The Fried Rice is good, Chowmein was decent. But the starter and the side dishes was average to say the least. Chicken 65 made with curry leaves!! I am sorry but I found it hard to explain to myself. The Chilli Chicken was made of dried red chilli flakes....not the conventional green chillies we are so used to seeing in a plate of signature Chilli Chicken. For me it was more of a Schezwan chicken than the former. Chicken in oyster sauce was again different but somewhere close to the one that we are so used to having. I guess what they have tried is to vary their dishes a lot and have managed to mess it all up. 
Quantity was good. Food was served on time.
They definitely need to improve on the taste factor. One thing that is very important is that it best not to deviate too much from the tried and tested.....experiments do not always yield favourable results. Under these circumstances I just cannot rate them better.

Okay...should have done this earlier but I guess we tend to ignore the ones closest to us....I thought for a while as to should I rate this place as much....then I felt the need to do it hence the rating....I mostly hung by the take away counter but the bar cum restaurant upstairs is not to be ignored....I have been there thrice....ambience in terms of decor is pretty basic....but the service is good n prompt....I have taken a special liking to one of the dishes which has been pretty recurring on my list....pepper chicken dry....its too damn good...the liquor section is pretty decent i must insist....you wouldn't feel over charged....they have some pretty good cocktails to offer (n im a cocktail lover)....decently priced , good food n drinks n cordial service management....I guess that's what is making this one of the busiest restaurant in this area.....good job done
