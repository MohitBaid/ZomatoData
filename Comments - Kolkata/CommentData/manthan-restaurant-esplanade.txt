Very poor service and ambience.. staffs are not polite. Food quality is good but as far as the value is concerned i expected far more from this restaurant. Not recommended at all

Located right beside The Lalit Great Eastern near Chandni Chowk Metro Station, its has 3 outlets. 2 side by side and one on the 1st floor. Simply decorated and well spacious. Been here 3 times mainly in attraction of the low cost booze. We had our office party here bcoz of the Controlled budget. The service is a bit slow and at times the young lads are confused. Their behaviour though were very courteious. Food is good. They have an open terrace for smoking, which is a nice delight for people who like to smoke. Overall its an OK place for people with limited budgets.

Ambience:3.5/5
Service:3/5
Quantity:3.5/5
Quality:3.5/5
Value For Money:3/5

Overall:3.5/5

It is very rare that an experience is so bad that it forces me to give such poor ratings. My father spoke highly of the place and got some food packed for me. Since I was not in mood for heavy stuff, ordered a plain takeaway from here. 

The yellow dal had no smell of nicely cooked dal and smokiness. The dal had no tarka? Very very sad! 
The mix vegetables had no taste. Absolutely none! I was wondering if I was having boiled veggies.
Only the kulcha was decent which wins a point from me. 

Prices are not reasonable considering what they served was not food as far as I know food!

A definite place to avoid!

It's a nice place with a decent decor. Situated near the metro station. The chicken pepper fry is a must have. Very nice service. Ambience is pretty good.

The Manthan Restaurant at Waterloo street is just opposite to the Lalit. An ambience which attracts office goers and families alike. Their service is very good and menu offers you variety of dishes. Very decently priced which is easy on the pockets for everyone. Its a regular place for me to hangout.

Manthan Restaurant, located in Waterloo Street is an eatery which serves delicious North Indian and Chinese cuisines. 
The dishes are reasonably priced and is pocket friendly for customers. 
The kebabs are mouth-watering and the breads are soft, fluffy and on point. 
All in all, this place is a must visit.
