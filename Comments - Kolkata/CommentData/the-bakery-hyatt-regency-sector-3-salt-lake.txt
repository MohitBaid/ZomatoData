Had gone to meet a friend at Hyatt and we sat here for some light bites. Took a chicken puff/pattice and a cheese cake. While the puff was okay nothing out of the world the cheesecake was a disappointment. The base had gotten soggy as it was kept in fridge for so long maybe. One would expect better tasting items from a 5 star bakery.

Cute and COZY little bakery which in spite of being a part of the hotel, has it's own PERSONALITY. Far better than the HYPED Waterside Cafe.   I had Tea and Fresh Fruit gateau. Overall a GOOD experience.

This is by far one of the best bakeries for a 5 star joing like Hyatt.
All the gateaux are amazing. The strawberry trifle is just very smooth and delicious with rich flavours. Try the chocolate crossiant too!

A fitting bakery for a 5 star joint!!! Excellent options, excellent variety and spot on taste. The variety showcased was commendable. They have order in cakes to quick half pound cakes. The displayed menu included options like blueberry cheesecake, caramel pudding, red velvet cheesecake, berry cake, waffles, chocolate eclairs, and the list is endless!!

No matter how disappointing the "Waterside Cafe" is, in the same premise of Hyatt Regency, there is a bakery segment named "The Bakery", which is just mindblowing to be honest, and capable to compete with any leading bakeries in town like "Delice"(Novotel), Cremecup etc. 

In fact, this bakery segment of the property deserves a standing ovation for the heart melting offerings they have, which just melts in your mouth and let your taste buds dance in rhythm divine. 

An amazing concoction of taste and texture constitutes the USP of their offerings, prepared from superfine ingredients, which is not only a delight to your palate, but also an experience that anyone would love to cherish for life as a prized possession.

Cheers!! :-)

After some disappointing experience in Waterside Cafe the only thing that was good and was worth talking was the Cake from The Bakery. The Birthday cake was ordered for one of my friend from here. 
Delicate and Delicious is the word to explain it. No need to write further about it. Good Job

Very good bakery options available at Hyatt Regency's bakery-and-dessert parlor. The luxury star hotel's close to my house too. I have a soft spot for the tiramisu; their oven-fresh eggless muffin, fruit danish and Mississipi Mud Pie, and from savories and puffs the vegetable puff count among some other favorites. A bit expensive, but overall The Bakery is a good choice for those who love bakes, cakes, breads and dessert.

Date of Visit: Visiting since 2002, i.e. since its inception. Last visited in Mar 2016.

Located beneath the lobby, and at the onset of the ‘Waterside Café’, ‘The Bakery’ is more of a well decorated selling counter, showcasing an array of authentic and well designed desserts, breads, and other savories.

Their menu consists of both veg and non veg options in – gateaux, pastries, puffs etc., and only veg options in single origin truffle! Alongside, they keep on introducing myriad wares, as per the ongoing season, festival and trend.

Over a period of time, we have tried, most of their wares, and have liked most of them, specially their fruit cakes, choco mud cakes and chocolate wraps. The portions are always large, and the presentations are mostly straight lined, sans any frill.

Recently we tried - madagascar coffee and kahlua truffle, pretzel and a heart shaped cookie. The truffle was topped with some coffee rich sauce and walnuts. It was moist and tasted very nice. The portion was more than sufficient for one person. The other two items were good as well. The food was parcelled and consumed at home.

This bakery holds a special place in our hearts, as during their first year of operation, they baked us a customized billiards table shaped cake! The then head chef, personally met us, noted down our specifications, and baked us a beautiful birthday cake. The design implications were beyond our expectation, and of course, it tasted very nice.

Been to the bakery couple of times now.
They have good variety and most of the product are pretty nice.
I specially loved the Tiramisu!!! however it can't be compared to the Tiramisu we get at Grand Hyatt Mumbai but its the closest to the perfect tiramisu!!
Point to remember is that most of the products gets sold by late afternoon. Its better to book your order in advance in case your coming to pick it up.

Love the bakery stall or small shop in Hyatt.
Thou I have visited and had there deserts many times but few days back I was really craving for something sweet. 
#sweettooth 
The thing I was desperately craving for was croissants.....Yes..#CROISSANT in the evening. As it's basically a breakfast dish but I was luring for it in the night time. Hard to get croissant at that time. So, not loosing hope I got a parcel from Hyatt bakery from my cousin having chocolate croissant and chocolate pastry.
Croissant was hell yummy...just delicious and mouth-watering!!
Really enjoyed..!!
Thumbs up.

The best bakery in Kolkata - my favourite being the Opera slice which has a combinational taste somewhere between tiramisu and chocolate fudge .
Also , a treat would the Black forest Slice - with the correct amont of cream and cherries :) the seasonal desserts go hand in hand - awesome , the fresh fruit mousse , the perfectly baked brownies and the small assorted chocolates :) 
Can come here again and again .... 
Also , to mention very friendly and helpful staff

One of the better bakeries of the city . I don't go here often but on my birthday , its either taj's truffle or tiramisu gateaux from Hyatt ! The tiramisu is to die for .. Light and fluffy and simply delicious . 

The blueberry cheesecake is good too but the muffins are not what i like . Love the danish pastries and the croissants . They make a good apple pie as well . Try their pumpernickel bread and the rye bread both are delicious .

The Bakery at the Hyatt Regency churns out pretty good stuff. I often drop by if I am in the area and I have not been disappointed so far by the quality of the items available. I am partial in particular to their Pretzel ( this is the only place I know of in Kolkata that makes Pretzels and if any one else on this forum knows of any other place please do let me know ) , the Croissant and their Crusty Bread. Their Fruit Danish and Cointreau Orange Truffle are also delightful. However at times if you drop by later in the evening they have run out of some items so suggest you go a bit early if you have anything specific in mind. Else call ahead as they are obliging enough to reserve stuff on the phone if your a regular and hold it for you. Worth a try if you like your breads.

Probably among the finest bakeries in the city. The Bakery at the Hyatt offers you some of the most sumptuous stuff you'll find in the city. Tastefully decorated, drop in and try out their Wheat, Multigrain and Rye Bread. They also make customized cakes to suit every occasion.
