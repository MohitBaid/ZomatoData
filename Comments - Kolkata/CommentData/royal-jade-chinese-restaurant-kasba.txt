Had dinner a bit long time ago. Had drumsticks, chicken hakka chow and chilly chicken. Taste was good. A bit like chine town. Service was good but a bit on slower side.

Got delivery from this place. I had ordered ricr noodles, a starter in chicken and fish. Chilli fish it was and it tasted good along with rice noodles. The price is on the average side.

This was a real bummer! We went during Durga Puja, so there was only a truncated menu. Moreover, the mixed hakka chowmein that we ordered was horrendous…not only did it lack adequate amount of veggies, chicken pieces and prawns, even the noodles were of so poor a quality that both my dining partner and I suffered from indigestion the next day :( Little-known eateries serve better fare; so I'm sorry to say that Royal Jade proved to be less than plebian. The accompanying Hot Garlic Fish was neither hot nor had any aroma of garlic. The only saving grace was the starter: Tender Chicken. I’ve to add here that it’s a misnomer…not tender, but actually crispy fried chicken breast pieces. Nonetheless it’s the only reason why I’m giving one point…the other one is for the interiors, since it is spacious and aptly decorated with a Chinese theme. 

My dining partner had been here earlier; the food was not this abysmal on that occasion. It seems the management hardly bothers about quality control during the festive season, secure in the knowledge that people would dine-out anyway.

One of my favourites. Set at a convenient location at the rashbehari connector it's a must visit for the Kolkata Chinese food lovers. I adore their chilly pepper chicken they serve with a green dip,their drums of heaven and velvet chicken are close contender to top the favourite list. The Hakka noodles they serve are great along with schezwan chicken and Manchurian fish.

It's our go-to place for Chinese food. Been eating here since 2009. The quality is as good as it was when we first went there. The quantity is always more than you expect it to be. Their delivery is always on/before time. The owners are very polite and courteous.

Highly recommend their mixed stewed noodles (for people who like a non spicy palette), salt and pepper prawns, tender chicken.

Visited this joint located near the Acropolis on the left while going towards Ruby for take away during weekend. Food quality is good with tangra type flavour. Prices are bit high. Ordered seafood soup, pan fried mixed chowmein, thai fish as side dish and chilli fish as starter. The starter and the main course tasted good, however soup was bit blunt in taste and looked not so tempting.. The joint remains closed daily from 4 pm to 6pm.

Hello...we went there on 26th Feb'17. In starter we ordered tender chicken..which was good and tender indeed. The chilli pepper fried fish was too spicy..also fish is not bhetki..but basha it seems..even we found bones..the pan fried momo was a let down...first of all it was only fried and not pan fried..also fillings of onion with little chicken. In main course..the dragon chicken was good and jade special mixed fried rice was average. The chilli garlic prawns were big in size and good. In dessert..the royal jade special sundae was good but chocolate sundae was average. Ambience good, staff courteous but service not so prompt. Prices are on the higher side compared to the quality. Overall not value for money.

I walked in to have a quick lunch at Royal Jade and was happy to see a set meal combo offer. I took my chances and ordered the set meal and Boy, was i pleasantly surprised. The set meal consisted of 1 serving of veg fried rice/ veg hakka noodles, one full NV soup- i got Hot n sour, 1 servibg of a starter-i got fried chicken and 1 serving of NV chicken gravy- i got manchurian and a strange collection of cut salad. All this for Rs. 199/- plus taxes, roughly about Rs. 240/-. This can easily be shared by two light eaters and the taste of all the dishes, especially the soup was above par. This is a traditional and quite authentic Chinese joint and would go back to try their other  dishes. Very happy with this discovery

We took a nearby coupn of 499 for non veg 4 course meal,the mean included soup,starter,sidedish and main course and dessert.The soup we ordered was our favourite chiken sweet corn soup which was served in a decent quantity,taste was yum,loved the starter which was pepper chiken,the chiken was juicy and tender,I never have a good luck with rice and to be perfect, the fried rice was ordinary,the main course too was just OK, Not a posh restaurant, but a decent one,ambience lacks cosiness.Pocket pinch on relief.

The décor is ordinary, but given that the locality is not much posh, it does nicely. The food is again good but nothing extraordinary. I think this is a good place to have Chinese if you are passing by which is how we discovered this restaurant. It is a residential hotel, with the Chinese owners living on the top floor of the same building as the hotel. I recommend:
#Steamed momos
#Pork dishes (since the pork pieces were nice unlike many places of Calcutta)

This restaurant was within a five-minute walking distance from my house. I regularly went past it but for some weird complexity of my deranged brain, I never stepped inside of it. I was such a fool. This place is an amazing Chinese restaurant. Period. 
I often have this complaint about a Chinese restaurant that their gravy always tastes the same no matter the dish. It seems that it is only a matter of one herb here in one dish and another herb there in another dish. That's the only difference. Not here. Every dish you try offers something new and that on an affordable price range. 

The first time I went there, I ordered a Dragon chicken and a Jade special Hakka chow. I was thoroughly impressed with the chicken preparation. I hadn't experienced such a unique taste in a long time and I totally cherished it. The noodles were equally good. I found the food so good that I ordered their Kung Pao Chicken as a takeaway and relished that at home (The Kung Pao was fantastic, but you could find similar stuff at different places too). 

The ambience of the place is quite good but I'd still suggest a takeaway. The service is very nice and the servers are very friendly. This place is not at all expensive and that, my friend, is a big brownie point.

Last year I ordered a couple of parcels and I was happy with the food. That made me think bigger about this joint this year. We had a annual family get together this week and I wanted to have an arrangement in a way so that we don't have to take the overhead of serving, in other word we wanted portions to be divided and parcelled. The conversation started with the lady coordinator (apologies for not remembering her name) and the deal got a fair shape for 32 heads of us with a considerable amount of discount with it. I have not dined in there but have seen the place - quite good ambience. On the delivery day they were just on time without any delay. Perfectly parcelled as committed alongwith spoons, forks and tissues. Very standard quality with good taste and sufficient quantiy made it an excellent experience. Would recommend this restaurant over many other recently hyped names for a nice experience with moderate budget.

The restaurant with its perfect Chinese decor and ambience will give u warm welcome. The hospitality n service of the waiters will pamper u. Now coming to the most important part of the story, we had the following:
Tangy drums of heaven- the fried chicken drumsticks tossed in a tangy soy based sauce with julian cut ginger, garlic n spring onion. Tastes truly finger licking!
Mixed fried rice- the rice was too much oily! When taste matters, the oily fried rice made it blunt and the diced chicken was rubbery. Prawn n eggs were ok but overall the taste was totally blunt.
Kung Pao Chicken- dark soy gravy (though very little) yet another blunt chicken item. There were many small pieces of chicken but the Kung Pao Chicken didn't taste like what it should at all!

Overall, the starter instigated an expectation of authentic Chinese experience but it ended up with blunt tasted dishes.

It was a dear friend's birthday and post celebrations, we headed to have a light dinner. Little did we know that some disaster is waiting. It was the birthday boy's suggestion and Kasba area is quite convenient for us.

The decor is of a absolute fine dining restaurant that we are familiar to. The staffs were over-friendly and the manager helped us to get a picture perfect moment too.

Once food arrived we were delighted. The birthday boy had told us about his prior good experiences too. But once we tasted it, food was very-very salty. When we complained, the manager said he can replace the plates but we were running short of time. 

Though I tried Mixed noodles and Munchurian Chicken only, the overall experience have been horrendous for me to recall.

A big NO from my end.

This is a new place near ruby , after acropolis. Went there for dinner with a friend. We ordered a chicken wanton soup which was really good , there were 4 wantons in it , really soft and delicious. For main course we ordered singapore fried rice which was not that great .... not like the ones we are used to having and with that we had thai chicken which was again really good. This place has a good ambience. Worth a try :)

Amazing family chinese restaurant with friendly staff who is certainly going to delight you & serving tangra type Chinese food, probably the only one in the kasba- Ruby hospital stretch. Have been visiting this restaurant since the time it opened. Must try the special fried rice, mandarin chicken, golden fried chicken to name a few and dont forget to check out their special items. 

Incase you want to try something authentic Chinese, do not hesitate to check with them. They have some authentic Chinese dishes like steam chicken, pakchoi, etc.The best thing about this place is they keep on adding new items. Although I have shifted to dubai now, but never miss a chance visiting this restaurant while I visit Kolkata. Way to go team Royal Jade !!!!

This restaurant really surprised me. I went there with my wife as it is near to Cinepolis. Some of the earlier reviews I read were less than perfect so I went in with mixed feeling.

But I was absolutely proven wrong.  The cuisines were delicious , the waiters were very hospitable and friendly. We  even chatted with the owner who came herself to meet us. The waiters checked on us every 10 minutes and suggested cuisines etc.

Before that day I used to hate momos but the momos prepared by the restaurant were so soft and delicious that they won me over.

We ordered chicken corn soup, chicken noodles , chicken manchurian and momos and were satisfied with each dish.

Anyone visiting cinepolis must really check this restaurant out for great chinese food.

A dinner with family, that builds some expectation from the place of dine. The seating is not bad, the decor is nice. The waiters are just hospitable.
Food here is good, wouldn't wanna go to Chinatown to have the same food. Not comparing the starters, but the main courses are nice here. It does have a slight tinge of the Chinese essence into it. More to come soon.

Hi, I am a frequent diner at  Royal Jade. The food is awesome. Each dish, has a taste of its own, reminds you of the old Tangra, real authentic, Chinese food. Real value for money.  The personal touch of the owners, add more flavour, to the food. A must try restaurant, if you are a lover of Chinese Cuisine. Service is great. Ambiance, very Chinese.  Highly recommended. You wont regret it. Thanx, Royal Jade team. See you soon, again.  CHEERS!!!

Probably the only decent Chinese restaurant in the locality, its a relief for Chinese cuisine lovers in Kasba. Went there with a huge group (30 approx) with office and had a huge variety of dishes. 
The veg clear soup was quite a delight, noodles and fried rice was regular, nothing great. Manchurian and diced potato was very good. 
At a reasonable cost, this place is worth a visit.

I have visited this place several times just for the beautiful 'tender chicken'(7 pieces) and barbecued chicken they offer which does not feature in the menu uploaded over here. Just ask the cordial and smiling staffs over there. They are heavenly.

In the veg section the most delicious is the fried baby corn and the mushroom in sauce (dry). 

They offer nicely decorated ice-creams but the nuts sprinkled on ice-creams are a bit old.
            
The ambiance is cosy and suitable both for official lunch and family dinner.

Royal Jade is located less than 4 kms from our home and takes us less than 10 mins to reach by car. Our family eats there at least once a month and we have been doing it for last more than seven years. I must say that not once have we been disappointed all these years on any aspect, be it the taste of food or the staff courtesy. We would generally choose from chicken hot & sour soup, chilly garlic pepper chicken, salt & pepper prawn, chicken steamed momo, tender chicken, chicken hakka noodles, chicken fried rice, Thai garlic prawn etc. and each dish has continued to be mouth watering. At times we would try something different as well. Close to home, no overcrowding, nice simple ambience, tasty food, courteous staff, just about priced right, parking is easily available ... cannot ask for more for a lunch or dinner out with family.

The decor of the place is good. It's quite spacious. 
The staffs are very well behaved. 
Coming to food... The quality and quantity both are good... We had dragon chicken and another side dish which was suggested by the waiter and mixed friend rice. All the dishes were tasty and we were satisfied.

A lovely restaurant with a view of the Bypass - kasba connector, Royal Jade is a good place to enjoy a quiet meal. The best part for me was the view, especially because I went on a rainy afternoon. The food was quite good, but I cannot say it was remarkable. But it was definitely reasonable. A great experience altogether, without burning a hole in the pocket.

Located on the main road(beside Azad hind dhaba) just a few meters away from Acropolis Mall. I used to come here when I was a kid, but the day the staff misbehaved with me, I stopped coming here. Food is very average and somewhat authentic Chinese which wont suit the majority of our taste buds. 
Also, if u like eating with chopsticks do ask for the same.

Visited this place quite a lot of times in past few years and sadly I'll have to say that the food quality has definitely decreased by large margin EVEN THOUGH the prices have shot up. 
Medium sized prawns have been replaced by smaller ones for the same amount. 
Chilli chicken tastes sweet( dine in on 7/5/16). Sad.
But there are few dishes which are just amazing. Veg Cantonese (gravy) chowmein. Mixed Fried Rice. Chilli garlic pepper prawn/chicken. Their green chilli sauce. Wow!

As far as the service and ambience is concerned, both are decently good.
The service is fast, which is very very important :P . And you get free parking space! 
Long thing short, do visit it if you want to, who knows they may surprised you!

I have always found the same to be very very filling and the taste extremely nice.,the five spice chicken doesnot feature on their regular menu and must be asked for separately. It is a dish meant for more than one person

The soup was so shitty that I wanted to ask for money back. The noodles/fried rice comes in a good quantity and taste wise okaish. The price vs quality/quantity is just above the margin.

A below average joint. Street side Chinese is tastier. Having said that let me justify my arguent. The menu: I had ordered for an egg fried rice (oily and grimy), chilly chicken (how can anyone in Kolkata go wrong with this one?) and drums of heaven (decent).

The price : why would I order below average food for a price which is nearly at par with the latest joint called chowman near patuli which served excellent quality food that included prawns. A day earlier an egg fried rice, chilly chicken and prawns (which is much more expensive) from chowman cost me 700 odd bucks yet today's meal from royal got me royally disappointed for 600 bucks (comparable).

The packaging: just look at my pic to understand the perverse nature of paper packaging, yes you heard it right, paper. Even street side vendors have moved to smarter packaging. To top it, the management had the gall to charge me for the container (check the pic for my bill)

The verdict: venture out at your own risk. Don't say I didn't warn you!

UPDATE: around a fortnight back visited the place and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their food... - much better when compared to home-delivered stuff... We had ordered for a Thai chicken soup which was surprisingly refreshing, a prawn noodles that was replete with prawns and was delicious... The golden fried prawns were crunchy, the only problem was the batter had turmeric added to it for colour which wasn't required...the chicken dish which I can't seem to recall was to our taste...a good place to visit but horrible for home-deliveries

Located just beside Azadhind and after thr bylane of DPS school, royal jade is the only authentic Chinese Restaurant u cam find in the Kasba connector.
The ground floor manages the delivery service while the first floor is the Restaurant and the 2nd floor manages banquets.The Restaurant is of ample space with a large seating arrangement.
We ordered Baby corn chciken soup,chicken wanton,mixed fried rice,chicken manchurian and mixed gravy noodles.
The wanton I felt were just crispy with mo sideon as is normally served.
Other foods were quite good.However they dont use pork which underdefined the use if word MIXED in the fried rice.
On the prices,they were actually in the steeper side.
Nevertheless a good chinese hangout place

Yesterdays lunch was at Royal Jade courtesy of my good Fren giving us a treat. For the first I experienced having Authentic Chinese good which you get only on special order. We had fish ball soup, steamed chicken,fish sui mai, prawn gold coin,steamed fish with chicken ham and imported mushroom,( which was amazing) and different . The veg dish were not bad too. We had Buddha's delight, wrapped Chinese cabbage and fung Pao Baby corn. These dishes were something very different and the cook (a Chinese lady) cooked it to excellence. Very less oil were used and  all food looked v healthy. Lastly the fish custard pudding was the icing. It looked and tasted fantastic. Will definitely go back again and recommend others to do so but an advice to get these exotic food,one must order before hand.

It's the only authentic Chinese restaurants you will find on the Rasbehari Bypass Connector. Food taste is really good as well the served quantity. I have never left this place with a grim face. Should try out the momos, Stir Fry dishes. If you're in a big group try to boost the big round table. It comes with a turntable for easier access to the food. Love this place.

Yesterdays lunch was at Royal Jade courtesy of my good Fren giving us a treat. For the first I experienced having Authentic Chinese good which you get only on special order. We had fish ball soup, steamed chicken,fish sui mai, prawn gold coin,steamed fish with chicken ham and imported mushroom,( which was amazing) and different . The veg dish were not bad too. We had Buddha's delight, wrapped Chinese cabbage and fung Pao Baby corn. These dishes were something very different and the cook (a Chinese lady) cooked it to excellence. Very less oil were used and  all food looked v healthy. Lastly the fish custard pudding was the icing. It looked and tasted fantastic. Will definitely go back again and recommend others to do so but an advice to get these exotic food,one must order before hand.

Just satisfactory. Average ambience. Quality of food is not that high although it is tasty. Would never like to go their again. Their chicken momos are decent. Fried rice and noodles are not awesome but are decent albeit their prices are high!

Average food that has been priced too high is what marks Royal Jade. The location is quite convenient to reach but the ambience isn't great.
Not sure what made them set such high prices for the mediocre food they serve.
There are other better places for chinese food in the same locality.

The food here is expensive but the quantity is sufficient for 3 people (mainly the side dishes) and a main dish of rice or noodles can suffice 2 hungry souls. Things I have tried from here include crispy chilli Babycorn, chilli chicken, mixed meifoon, hakka noodles, chilli fish, hot garlic fish, thai paneer. All are very nice.

After a hectic football tournament, the team was overly exhausted and hungry. You know how they say that you can eat anything, good or bad, if you're really hungry. Well that was not the case. I'm pretty sure I would've loved their food even if I was not hungry. We obviously opted for something within our budget, but we really enjoyed whatever we had. Food is really good. Price is fairly reasonable but the quantity is too much, very satisfying. A full plate of Chilli Chicken offers 14 pieces. Who would miss it? If you're looking for good Chinese food, this is where you can/should go.

Being a foodie myself I left the choice of food to the owner chef Mr LIAO to try something very authentically Chinese.I had a sumptuous spread of SingaPorean Chicken with rice noodles.......and it was awesome.Reasonably priced and a good quantity is enough to feed your appetite...The sauces they use are homemade and the kitchen is taken care by Mrs Liao herself.

Located at an easily commutable place, just beside the e.m bypass,royal jade has quality chinese food. The restaurant is spacious with a typical chinese colour backdrop of red and white.Food quantity is also fairly good. Must try is their mix hakka chow and chilli garlic chicken. The only thumbs down is the droopy hospitality.

Ambient average. Tried spring chicken (half) and fried pepper fish(half). Taste average. Price is too high compare to quantity and quality. For example, the chicken have only 4 small pieces with bundle of green chilli. I give 1 because no value for money. I did not try other dishes, it may worth?

This is a delayed review being submitted for Royal Jade. We've been here about 3-4 times till now and it's been a good experience each time.

Their 'must try' dishes are Chicken Momo, Golden Fried Prawns, Crispy Fried Chicken. Every time we've been there, these have been our staple and we've not been disappointed even once.

The waiters are friendly and helpful and recommend you dishes that are suitable to your palate.

Overall a good and satisfying experience every time we've been there.

I'd returned from a tiring train journey the other night, to hear that the family had ordered in dinner from Royal Jade, the 'local' Chinese restaurant. It's been around for a good while, but somehow, the oddity of the location (neither at a comfortable walking distance, nor at a reasonable bus distance from Ruby Hospital) prevented us from going over and eating/ordering food, despite positive reviews from foodie friends.

Friday night turned out to be a decent surprise, though, in terms of food. We ordered in four plates of Veg Hakka noodles and two plates of fried rice, Garlic Prawns, Chicken in Oyster Sauce and Garlic Mushrooms. A pretty basic dinner, considering that it is the end of the month and the budget was tight. All of this cost us something around Rs. 1400/-, not bad considering the quantity, which fed five of us till the brim, and then there were some leftovers for the following day.

The noodles were well fried, and the standard 'Indian Chinese' flavours were well-blended with lightly sauteed vegetables. Unfortunately, they were on the oily side of things, and left a visible oil patch on the dinner plate after I'd finished. The fried rice, unlike many other kinds of fried rice from other restaurants, tasted beautiful. A perfect blend of light soya sauce, with a hint of ginger and garlic, just the way rice should be flavoured, lightly, leaving a nice aftertaste on your tongue if you eat it as a standalone dish, and yet does not overwhelm if you are to mix it with a differently-flavoured gravy.

The prawns were fresh, but the sea-smell was stuck to it like glue, and weren't masked by the gravy, which had scant garlic and more cornflour/cornstarch. 

The heroes of the night were the Chicken in Oyster Sauce, and the Mushrooms. 

Chicken in Oyster Sauce is a whitish gravy, with slices of chicken and vegetables. The chicken was perfect: fresh, soft, and thinly sliced, thin enough to absorb the gravy and yet feel like pieces of meat in your mouth. The vegetables were perfectly sliced, and cooked to perfection. The gravy was perfect: not thick, and yet not runny, so that it mixed well with the noodles and rice, and yet did not lose any of its subtle flavours.

The Mushroom was the best surprise of the night: it didn't try to pretend to be a non-veg dish, and yet absorbed all of the flavours as well as chicken/fish. The mushrooms were quartered and coated in batter, and the gravy was, again, of a perfect consistency.. full of the flavour of garlic and yet not overwhelmingly so. I loved the chopped pieces of spring onion in the gravy, a welcome addition to the overall flavour of the dish.All in all, I did like the quality of food, and am looking forward to ordering in again, just in case I can't make it to the restaurant. :)

Had a nice lunch on the occassion of rakhi at this Chinese restaurant... Had been here around four years back when an old friend gave me a birthday treat.. We first ordered chicken wantons which were crispy and fresh. Fresh lime soda was also quite palatable. For main course we ordered veg.rice noodles and mandarin fish...Didn't like the rice noodles much..i felt It was a little undercooked.the mandarin fish was just wow, one of the best I ever had. The service was really swift and the waiters were polite and courteous..I just wish I could see some more smiling faces!! Ambience was quite good although could be a little innovative.. All in all a decent place to have food...

The fried rice I had was the best I've had in a long time complimented with the delicious chilli chicken made it an amazing experience. Your taste buds will fall in love with the food here specially if you are a fan of Chinese cuisines like me.

I have visited this place quite a lot of times. It's still very underrated as not a lot of people know about it, but I think it's one of the best Chinese eateries in the city in terms of ambience, decor and quality of food. The ground floor takes care of the home delivery service. And the first floor houses the restaurant. They have large tapestries arranged in the form of curtains, and Chinese lanterns which give the feel of authencity. A great percentage of the staff is of Chinese nationality. And if you visit towards the late evening, you find that the place is frequented by a lot of jolly Chinese families residing in the city. 
The food is decently priced Chinese cuisine, but very suited to our tastes, It's hygienic and the proportions are generous enough. From Starters, I would suggest their Prawn Tempuras and Wantons, and also their Chiily Garlic Fish. I love their Garlic Prawns. Their Singapore Noodles and Singapore Mei Foon are worth trying. For dessert, you can try their Tutti Frutti, All in all, this is a place that all Chinese cuisine lovers must  visit once and try for themselves.

Horribly uncourteous waiters and abominably oily food. The momo that they served was easily a day old and yet they argued about their freshness. I had ordered a Thai soup and was instead served a lemon coriander soup. Despite their mistake, they refused to change it.

I have eaten here several times, but this i by far unacceptable. Don't want to come back here again after this.

1. The waiters do not serve in a tray. They just get food in bowls and put it on table.
2. Captains ways tend to order outside menu. Then how do we understand the price. Generally eaters do not enquire abt the price. Whatever the captain sugeested to me was all outside menu then whats the use of a menu card?

After reading the review in The Telegraph, went to this
restaurant on Rajdanga Main Road along with my wife on the 1st of
April 20015. Bill number 5, Table number 10.

 

Quaint little place. No one to receive and direct. The
doorman directed us to the 1st floor. Liked the presence of the
elevator, especially when 50+ people have knee pain and advised not to use
stairs.

 

Food ordered:

Fresh lime soda

Packaged drinking water (though the bill reads Mineral
water)

Starters:

Half Salt & Pepper prawns

Fried Chicken Wantons

Mains:

Mixed Meifoon

Thai Garlic prawns

Fresh Lime soda was bad. Very diluted.

Salt & Pepper prawns were very ordinary especially the
batter was too thick and the aromats were very less.

Wantons were nice but expected a little more filling.

Meifoon were very nice and the quantity was good.

The prawns were nowhere near the Thai garlic prawns that I
know of but good.

 

Service staff needs a bit more training but it is the perennial
problem of the Hospitality Industry, you increase sophistication, the costs go
up. 

2 tables joined later, were very noisy and spoilt the fun.
Does money rule these days in Kolkata? People do not care about etiquettes?
Whether in a restaurant, driving or talking over the phone? I want to claim my
city back. This is not the Kolkata I knew and can die for.

I like what Mr. Victor Bannerjee wrote sometime back. Style
and Culture vanished after 60s. I am feeling it and this is the observation
everywhere in Kolkata especially after spending so many years outside Calcutta.


Disturbing learning: A gentleman came and sat behind us and
ordered a Combo Lunch meal. To our utter dismay, he insisted on getting Chat
Masala and did not stop till the waiter got it for him. Do we have Chat Masala
with Chinese food these days? I was not aware.

 

Pocket pinch INR 1345 with taxes plus TIPS for both of us. I
think it is on the higher side considering the overall experience.

Would recommend this restaurant, which is good compared to
many in that bracket. Keep it up. Shall visit again.

Royal Jade adds royal taste to its chinese food. This place is just a walk away from my house and yet i managed to skip it everytime. After having their food i have to say they beat Tangras famous beijing 's food. Totally amazing.

The place has ground and first floor. The first floor has the dine in facility while the ground has the parcel facility. I thought the system was really well maintained because in a lot of fancy restaurants you dont get to see dine in and parcel facilities being managed separately. Due to their system even service was ensured promptly. The  staff was this chinese guy, very sweet, agile and courteous. 

I had ordered their mixed fried rice and trust me till date i think this is the best fried rice i had.

Next i was referred a thai chicken which is not on the menu but you can go and enquire for it at the desk. It was just amazingly done. It had a little tangy flavour, nothing over the top. There was  a good blend and balance in their food. 

Price was quite steep but again they have the option for full or half plate. Usually a full place consists of 16 pieces of whatever you are ordering.

Overall good food.

Quite an average restaurant serving pretty much the regular chinese stuff available across Kolkata. We had momos, drum sticks, salt and chilli prawns alongwith some hakka noodles and five spice chicken. 

While the quantity served is good, the quality could have been better. It tries to give an authentic chinese feel in its decor but the food is left wanting on several counts. The service at the restaurant is quick and courteous and the restaurant has a good enough parking space which is rather good given that it is difficult to park on the road. 

All in all, you may visit if you absolutely have to. Otherwise, give it a miss! 

P.S.: I can't seem to update my rating but if I could I'd give it a 2.

All in all, you may visit if you absolutely have to. Otherwise, give it a miss! 

P.S.: I can't seem to update my rating but if I could I'd give it a 2.

It's a lovely Chinese restaurant with lovely ambience and food. The food is lip smackingly amazing .
But the down point is the price. A bit overpriced though. It can be reduced a bit to fit our pockets well. Especially with rising service taxes. The service is also very slow.

POOR EXPERIENCE

I have been there yesterday. 

1) Food is very very Average. I ordered JADE SPECIAL HAKKA NOODLES - but it reminds me the taste of street Chinese food-stall.
2) Service is very much dump. 
        (a) They are very poor in suggestion. 
        (b) They only concentrate of their own work, they don't care - even damn about guest comfort. 
        (c) When I asked for feedback form or else manager's number, they responded that, restaurant have no manager/owner. Like, they dont care about the feedback of guest.
3) Appearance of restaurant is good.

Overall, I'll not plan again to pay visit there. And, I will NOT RECOMMEND to go.

That is the worst place I have ever been to. The food being the worst Chinese I have ever eaten. Food is secondary if you can take your mind of the flies around you biting all the time. I worry that they can't some disease carrying mosquitoes as they come from d open drain n dumping area rite next to d restaurant. The bites I Recieved are still swollen after more than 12 hrs. I think the food board should review the place

have just been here a couple of times. The place looks pretty good and tries to give an authentic Chinese feel. However the food is the same old Indianised Chinese.
Most things are pretty tasty and cheap. Quantity is really good.
Don't worry about the seemingly expensive prices for any dish, the price given is generally the price for 16 pieces( not the conventional 8) of chicken or fish etc.
Should check it out if you like eating outside and don't mind experimenting with new places.

I'm a regular at this restaurant and i've enjoyed most of the items i've tasted. The key to having good Chinese  is to order sensibly, the winner in this restaurant is the mixed fried rice with burnt garlic as garnish, it adds to the flavour and also the visual aspect of the dish. Any chicken main course item like Singapore chicken would go well with the rice. The restaurant is very generous when it comes to their portion sizes, 12 pieces of momo in one plate, what more could you ask for? The momos could give competition to the good tibetan restaurants in Kolkata so its a win win situation for the guest. Overall good food, okay ambience but a great experience .

Had been contemplating visiting this place for a long time and finally did last week on the recommendation of a friend. We ordered noodle soup which was good. Next we ordered the crispy chilli mushroom. Was highly disappointed with this. It was a plate of fried mushroom with a lot of green chillies thrown in. Like there were literally twenty pieces of green chillies that you could see on the plate. For the main course we decided to skip a vegetable dish and just ordered for noodles and rice. The egg fried rice was really very good. We had placed an order for chilli garlic noodles but the waiter informed us that that again would be filled with green chillies. So we skipped the chilli part and just ordered for garlic noodles. They were okay. Nothing great. 
Overall the food was very average. The good thing about this place is the quantity of the food they give and the reasonable prices.

I found this restaurant via Zomato at today afternoon, I live near at Rajdanga but never heard of it. So here is my reveiw.

Ordered chicken fried rice and initially thought for hot garlic chicken but waiter told me to try Dragon Chicken.
First of all I must say Fried rice tastes awesome to me, secondly dragon chicken was not spicy at all, I imagined that I will throw some fire like dragons after having it. quantity was 16 pcs for 320 RS.

Ambiance: very good
Serving Time: Fast
Food: So good and VFM

This is a nondescript place and I am not a great fan of the decor but the food makes up for it. The chicken sweet corn soup and the chicken hot and sour soup are good. Call it a quirk but I love to order a bowl of each, mix them and the resulting taste I find heavenly. The main course favorites include fish in plum sauce, chicken in hot garlic sauce and chicken five spice ( this is a very individualistic dish and most people either love it or hate it, I happen to love it). The mixed fried rice is also decent.  The deserts section is not at all large and is limited basically to ice-cream, but I like a dollop of chocolate ice-cream.

Overall not a bad place, not too expensive, service could be better, decor could be better, may not be a fine dining experience but its definitely a decent dining experience.

Would "nondescript" be too harsh a term? Well, at the risk of sounding harsh and unpleasant (though oozing with positivity and fondness), one has to say that this is one of those restaurants that goes about it's business without any pomp or gaudery, and does it remarkably well.

I don't think too many people in South Kolkata know about the restaurant and it's vast repertoire of authentic Chinese fare. Tracing it out isn't a big deal as it stands right across the Kasba main road above Azad Hind Dhaba. I recently trudged in with friends here and had a whale of a time beside the big glass panes on a deliciously rainy evening. There's nothing more you can possibly ask for when you have good company and good food.

Speaking of food, you wouldn't earn any points for discerning that this place specializes in Chinese as that's pretty much evident from it's name. It does a pretty good job with it's brand of Chinese staples, as everything we had that evening were delightfully good. Though the Chicken fried wantons were a wee- bit too oily& the chicken drumsticks a tad too dry for our own liking, we weren't in the mood to whine about it. The main course that we ordered (that had a mixed fried rice and a prawn side dish) satiated us completely& we squared it off with a wonderful Butter- scotch ice cream that had an arresting, lovely presentation. 

The interiors are pretty much in sync with regular upper- middle class standards and you seemingly wouldn't have an issue with the staff or the ambiance (which indirectly implies that there's no reason for you to not barge in on an evening and have a whale of a time with your near and dear ones...).

Did you get the drift? I bet you have!

Decor is very good. But food is not that good(according to me).
The chicken pieces are extremely small. The gravy is very runny. It is more of "mangsho'r jhol" rather than thick gravy.

The menu provided here(the same menu is handed to you in the restaurant) is incomplete. Theh have many more items which are not listed here.

We had Sichhuan mixed hakka noodles. It was spicy and worth the price. With it we had half Singapore Chicken. It was mildly spicy.
Then we had Drums of Heaven(10pcs, tossed in sauce). The sauce is extremely sweet. It completely destroyed the taste. Worst dish I ever ordered. And the pieces were tiny to say the least.

The waiters are very eager to suggest the unlisted items since they are much more costlier. 

The points are for the decor and the noodles only.

I have been visiting Royal Jade for quite a while now. It is one of the best chinese restaurants in Kasba. The decor is pretty nice with shades of red and authentic chinese fans which is impressive. We have both taken take-aways and dined in here.
The staff are courteous and helpful. The service is pretty fast!
Things we generally order and which are recommendable are :-
1) Sweet corn soup :- The soup is thick, with just enough amount of corn and chicken. Really good! :)

2) Chicken manchow soup : It is good..

3) Spring chicken : I find it just perfect and tasty! This goes great with soups!

4) Chicken American Chopsuey : I am a big fan of American Chopsueys and without any doubt I can say that this place serves one the best choupsueys of Kolkata! Do not miss on this if you are here! :D

5) Chicken Hakka Chow : Though a tad bit oily its always a pleasure to your taste buds. It's nice.

6) Mixed Fried Rice : This place really makes delicious mixed fried rice (not Indianised) and it's difficult to find such a perfect dish in Kolkata! :)

7) Chilli Chicken : Bongs have a weakness for chilli chicken, so we always have to have this in our list when we order something from a chinese restaurant. Chilli chicken tastes like chilli chicken, nothing to be very excited about.

8) Hunan Fish : This is really good. I like it :)

9) Chilli Garlic Chicken : Nice!

10) Mixed Meifun : It is actually rice noodles which tastes amazing but is a bit dry. Combine it with any kind of chinese gravy and it goes great!

11) 7 spice mixed chinese chicken - I have tried this but I did not find it very impressive or something. The dish consists of a fried chicken with skin which have been marinated with the 7 chinese spices and then dipped in a sauce which is most probably made of brown sugar, soy sauce and balsamic vinegar. It is not bad but somehow It did not match up to my expectations. As it was recommended by them and was termed as a speciality of Royal Jade, I really had high expectations. But anyhow, it did not impress me much. The first bites were quite tasty but then the taste started to fade away. Its good for a first time try. :)

When they first opened this outlet, they used to serve Mustard chilli chicken as thejr speciality but sadly they don't serve it anymore. It used to be delicious!

Pocket pinch for 2 would be around 700.
RECOMMENDED.
Happy Eating! :D

This being my first review in Zomato, I didn't want to start with giving a poor rating to a food joint. But Royal Jade compulsively needs a rating like this - I wish they make some changes to their system. 

Firstly, let's talk about the ambiance. Yes, they are decorated inside as other reviewers mentioned. But when we entered the restaurant (it was around 1pm), it was hot and humid inside. AC was switched off. When we mentioned this to the waiters, they switched on the fan (which ran with a bazooka noise). AC was also started, but it took its own time to make the room feel comfortable - by the time we were almost done with our lunch. Uncomfortable, but decorated ambiance doesn't give any good feeling.

Talking about food, the quality was not at all up to the mark. We had taken Drums of Heaven as starter which was ok. But the main course was not at all acceptable quality with that kind of price tag. Prices are high, quality is low. I would also like to mention about quantity. For the kind of price tag, the quantity is on the lower side. Expecting the owners to be a little more generous when serving, as the customers also need to feel that the price paid is justified. Hope the owners take a note and improve themselves. Thanks!

Note: The waiters always seem to insist on taking Singapore Chicken in main course, but it is not mentioned in their menu. If it is your delicacy, it will be very nice if you put it in the menu as it feels odd to ask for the price of an item after it is suggested verbally.

Royal Jade is one of the nearest restaurant from my house but still i had gone there very rare mostly on occasions.The Decoration was authentic with shades of red and surroundings is also very pleasant.Quality of the food is very good so i would like to recommend u to have chicken pepper salt,crispy chicken with baby corn and prawn in oyster sauce etc.Seating arrangement is very good compared to some other restaurants but the only thing which kept it down was the quantity of the food which is not sufficient enough to fulfill more than one person.So in my opinion i would like u to visit this place which is located near EM bypass near azad hind dhaba.

Royal jade is very near to my house, so has been a regular visitor there. The place is decorated quite impressively in brilliant shades of red, coming to food I must say this is the best Chinese restaurant in Kasba. Just one suggestion I would like to provide--just avoid the ice-creams there--they will charge you heavily for the worthless things they use to decorate the desserts.
Soups are good and I guess you wont be disappointed by any dishes, though they compromise a bit on quantity.

Located very conveniently right by the EM bypass, near ruby hospital, Royal jade is decorated quite impressively in brilliant shades of red as most Chinese restaurants are, but certainly classier. We took the corner most table for two with a view of the main road. Seating was comfortable, ambiance quite nice and calm. It is certainly the kind of restaurant where you would like to take your family for dinner. Of all the times I've been there, I've never found it overtly crowded which is quite good actually. Coming to the food, we took prawns for starters, which were tasty and  crispy, but lesser in quantity compared to the price they charged. We tried the chilli garlic fish and it was good. The chinese chop suey was definitely a hit with us. It was prepared extremely well. In all, good food but a tad less on quantity. Would like to suggest to the chef/owner, please be a bit generous with the proportions, one plate should ideally serve two.

We were really hungry on a sultry summer evening and were looking for a place that serves good chinese cuisine and so my friend suggested Royal Jade. The ambiance is kinda okay, pretty clean. We ordered Mixed Gravy noodles, Mixed fried rice and Thai Garlic chicken. pretty neat, no? The food was quite tasty, and the quantity was generous. We had quite a sumptuous dinner and decided to try Royal Jade Sundae for dessert. overall,quite satisfactory experience. Will definitely revisit. Only complain could be the cost.

Being located about 7 min away from my place, Royal Jade had been a constant dining destination for me in my growing up years . visited the restaurant about 3 months but was completely disappointed with the food quality, though the quantity seemed the same. These guys need to buck up, cause there are plenty of other promising food joints mushrooming on the EM bypass.

Being new to the city, my wife and myself went looking for restaurants to try the food , we happened to come across Royal Jade. It’s a family restaurant run by a Chinese family. We’ve enjoyed the food tremendously. We wanted to eat food which is not too spicy, so the waiter recommended for us to try their Prawn Tempura, Sweet Corn Soup, Mixed Hakka Noodles and Tangy Chicken. The food was delicious. We have asked whether they could cook up some green leafy vegetables for us and the Chef even rustle up a dish of healthy greens for us. We got to chatting with the owners, they are really friendly people. They do special orders too, if one phone ahead of time and order food which is not in the menus. We were lucky enough to try out their Pao or as we called it Buns with meat fillings. It’s so light and tasty. We will definitely be coming back for more food in Royal Jade and ordering their Pao!

The food in Royal Jade is simply sumptuous. I’ve eaten there many times and will be going back again and again. The price is just right and meals for 2 can easily fill ones stomach and with left over too. I love their Foong Pao Baby Corn, it’s crispy and coated with sweet and sour sauce with a hint of sesame seeds. Then one should order their Royal Jade Chicken, it’s spicy and cooked with assorted vegetables and black bean sauce. It’s simply delicious and different from other dishes. The Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Rice Noodles are cooked perfectly. One should ask for their Five Spice Chicken. The taste will linger in your memory for days. Then there is Moon Wanton, it’s Fried wanton covered in Gravy and veggies. It’s one of my all time favourite. Although alcohol is not served, since it catered to mostly family, so the vibe of the atmosphere is relaxing! I Will recommend Royal Jade to all my friends and relatives and even acquaintances too to try the food at Royal Jade.

I had read about Royal Jade on the newspaper , so i went there to have the food and what they said were absolutely true , the food was too good i strongly recommend the hakka chilli chicken which explodes with flavour in your mouth , the crispy tender chicken was extremely juicy , succulent and soft , the fried Tempura prawn were cooked perfectly and the kung pau baby corn is really good and crispy , the momo's and noodles and chicken fried rice were also spectacular and for dessert the megans special was too good .

It started off well, the starters chicken drums of heaven and pepper garlic fish were quite good.... Then everything went slowly downhill.... The royal jade special soup lacked salt and there was nothing really special about it.. The main course were disaster... Singaporean meifoon was oily, the special fried rice was over laden with ajinamotto, the Thai chicken and Manchurian fish were so so.. Then came the real shock.. The dry honey chicken was just chicken pakora over which honey was poured.... The ice-cream was good though, but I suppose you can rarely go wrong with ice-cream.... Overall nothing to lure us back to the place.....

We are a very regular customer at Royal Jade but was let down by the quality of food on Saturday, 28th Dec 2013.  We had ordered 5 full dishes of Dried chilli prawn, 5 full dishes of honey chicken ,some  chicken and mixed fried rice and also a plate of veg fried rice. The total bill, along with the taxes , was around Rs. 5900 and it was a take away order for a party at home. The food was ready and was collected by my brother in the afternoon around 2 p.m. Although the rest of the food was okay, the honey chicken was a disaster. The chicken pieces were stiff and the gravy absolutely tasteless and watery. It was a rather a honeyless honey chicken so to say.  The entire portion of honey chicken was a wastage. We lost our face in front of the guest, let alone the amount of money spent on the item.  

I would request the owner Mr. Michael to kindly look into the matter so that such a thing does not happen in future as we would not like to exclude s a good chinese joint from our regular visits. We have been always served well by them but one such disaster leaves a bitter taste in the mouth.

The food here is very good, lives up to the Chinese persona. The ambience is very well suited to the name, with typical Chinese lights and decorations, feels good to the eye. But the prices are a bit on the higher side.

SHOCKING, APPALING – STRICTLY AVOID !!

Ordered for a dinner party in the evening, wanted to make sure food was delivered on time, so had placed the order at 2 PM in the afternoon for delivery at 8 PM. Despite the order time at 8 PM nothing was delivered till 10 PM ! 

Further to that shocking customer service and complete dishonesty, where they kept on lying that the delivery boy is on his way since 8 PM, when asked the delivery person he confessed that he had left only 5 minutes before

Then comes the food ! horrible, oily, cold and probably cooked the day before. The “tempura prawn” was a grease ball, the “Manchow Soup” was as bad as stale daal from night before, and the only thing special about “Jade special chicken” was its name – the rest was worse than a street side restaurant. 

Be extremely careful about the prices as well, firstly when you try and place the order they always say prices has changed slightly, and then they never say that VAT is not included !

Overall shocking experience, bad food, disgusting customer service – PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COSTS !

We visited this establishment on a Sunday late evening with a group of 7 adults. Table was provided immediately. We asked for window side table but the waiters were reluctant to provide the same though it was available and there was no queue outside. Without any argument we accepted the table offered by them. Ordered soups, pan-fried mixed noodles, chicken garlic fried rice, hunan fish, Singaporean chicken and tutti fruity desert. The chicken side dish was the best. Hunan fish was bit on sour side but had annoying fishy smell could be avoided if marinated properly. Mixed noodle has excessive amount of vegetables compared to very less proportion of non-veg stuff and noodle. Desert which was served as tutti fruity was not tutti fruity at all. Overall food quantity was excellent but needs improvement the way they have been prepared. Ambiance was fine for family crowd. Price is ok. Deserts can be easily avoided. Waiters were the biggest let down. They badly needs training on how to attend guests. They just want their guests to leave as soon as possible without letting guests properly enjoying the food. I would recommend to foodie lovers to hit China town area where they will have better Chinese cuisine.

Think of Chinese in Kasba, Think Royal Jade. 
Me and my wife were thinking of having Chinese, the normal destination for us is mostly china town. This time around we thought checking Zomato and find something very close by as it was a weekday and was late as well around 10PM. I knew about the restaurant being there but was apprehensive about the price and quality of food. After checking the reviews of the restaurant we thought of giving it a try. The  try turned out to be a good experience.
Though the restaurant was empty being at the odd location and the time that we chose to go there, but one can make out that even on a day with full capacity it will never look cramped as it is quite spacious.
The order placed was hot and sweet chicken soup , chilli garlic pepper chicken, chicken Szechuan fried rice with ginger chicken.  First the quantity pretty good for two second the quality as good as the ones that you get at china town. The taste as it should be. The staff were polite and courteous, the place was kept neat and clean. In all a restaurant that has come up keeping the future in mind as the skyline near Ruby is set to change in a couple of years which will need good restaurants like these.

Many times i have been there. Nice decor.. A nice environment. And the food is very nice. First time I had chicken sweet corn soup along with chicken chow and garlic chicken. The amount of food is good enough that two people can share. It's nice to take the food in front of a glass window. I must appreciate the management for maintaining everything very nicely.  And after that I suggest and took many friends out there. And wish to see there again.

Royal Jade is a Chinese restaurant located in Kasba just next to Azad Hind Dhaba. It is a good addition to the existing Chinese restaurants in the area apart from China Bite, Red Bamboo Shoot etc.

Food is really good and there is a lot of professionalism in their preparation. Prawn and Fish items are available however no Lamb or Crab items are to be found in the menu. Chicken with Mushroom and Babycorn and Chicken in Oyster Sauce should be given a try.

The pricing is on the higher side however considering the taste and quantity, it's very descent. The quantity for a dine-in is slightly more than home delivery orders. Overall quantity is very sufficient specially for the gravy items e.g. - Chicken with Mushroom and Babycorn which is sufficient for four.

The restaurant has enough sitting space and is somewhat nicely decorated. There is some space for car parking outside as there is no footpath on the road as such. The service for dine-in needs improvement, home delivery time for nearby places is however acceptable.

So, overall a recommended place for some authentic Chinese dine. Also it is best to use their takeaway service which is super-fast.

Update 23/12/2014: Had to go with Royal Jade for dinner after watching a late night film, they were well open at 10:30PM and service was quite efficient. We tried out Hakka Noodles, Fried Rice as usual and Singapore Chilli Chicken and Chicken in Oyster Sauce alongside. Singapore Chilli Chicken was tangy and spicy dry chilli chicken and was very tasty. Chicken in Oyster Sauce was equally good and didn't disappoint. The dine-in quantities were very good and service was fast.

The mix oriental spicy noodles and the prawn fried rice were well prepared. Chicken Manchurian and Chilli Chicken Dry are equally good. Cool ambiance, food is also scrumptious and quantity is well. Price is reasonable.  It is a very good place to spend time with friends or family and i would suggest a visit.

I have visited this place just once with a few people and had a proper meal. The interiors are probably a bit too overdone for me and it would have been better had they actually got more seating in the ground floor and that would have made the seating all over less cramped. Coming to the food, I think the quality is decent, but the prices are high considering the quality and quantity. We were a group of four and as far as I remember we ended up paying 2500 without alcohol for a proper three course meal. The Hot Garlic Fish is very well made and worth a try. Overall, cramped, overpriced, so a 3 for Royal Jade.

The dishes are comparable to Tyangra( chinatown) restaurants. Nice and cosy, friendly staff, good food, overall a nice place to visit with friends and family. Once again, the ONLY good restaurant in Ruby Hospital area.

ROYAL JADE BECKONS!

Royal jade is another address for all things Chinese in Kasba. Besides the food, the other reasons that make having food here a pleasure are the oriental decor, the spacious sitting arrangement, and certain  tables that come equipped with a 360 degree rotating smaller disk.   The menu is extensive, exhaustive and well written. 

 The starters to be had from here are the highly popular Drums of Heaven and the Tempura Fried Prawns. The prawns are thinly coated with the tempura batter and are fried to perfection; the prawns themselves are big and juicy.  You can never go wrong with them. For the main course, place your order for their Chicken Hot and Sour Soup. This soup is recommended for those who like their soup really hot. Ideally one should have their Chicken Sweet Corn Soup along with the famed Five Spice Chicken. The chicken simply tastes divine. The chicken always turns out great because it has been very well coated with the spice mix. Again the spices do not overpower your senses. Once you develop a liking for such a dish you would want to have it every time that you dine here. Other irresistible chicken dishes from their extensive menu are Chilli Chicken (dry), Honey Chicken and Hunan Chicken. Another brilliant dish worth mentioning here is their Chilli Prawn. The prawns are well turned out and still retain their juice. Sometimes this dish is too fiery for my stomach, but the prawn portions are always plentiful. Have these meat dishes with their Chicken Oriental Spicy Chow. True to its name it is very hot and spicy.  But if you prefer Mei foon or rice noodles to rice or chow then check out their Chicken Singapore Mei Foon. The prices for such a quality and quantity of food are affordable. The service is quick and efficient.

Have been there once and home delivered thrice almost...A very cool ambience,food is also scrumptious and quantity is well. I had chicken momos which were really nice,Mixed fried rice which was tasty and Chilly Chicken Dry which was another tasty dish. It is 20 or 30 seconds from Gitanjali Stadium,I think so and staffs are also well-mannered. Prices are also moderate.They serve food fast but they specify when they take time to prepare any food. At night after 9:00 pm the place becomes crowded and at morning after 12:30 pm.  It is a very good place to spend time with friends or family and i would suggest all you guys to visit here. Overall experience was satisfactory. I would rate 3 stars for it.

This place is just 10 min walk from Ruby on the Kasba connector. This is one of the best places in the kasba, By pass area to have Chinese. The 'Clear Soup' is very delicious here and so are the appetizers. We had 'Tempura fried prawn', which was just too good. The ambience is nice but gets quite busy after 9. The staff is very helpful and will suggest you good dishes. The mix oriental spicy noodles and the prawn fried rice were well prepared. We had a really nice time. Overall, a nice place to hang out with friends and family.

Reasonably good quality food.. standard Ind0-Chinese or rather Kolkata chinese fare  but the couple of times I have had it , never been disappointed. Maybe I haven't had their authentic dishes yet.. Not tried their entire range yet since I am an occassional visitor to the city. I do think they fill an important gap in this part of town. Glad to find restaurant dishing out consistently good fare. Also appeciated the friendliness and hospiatlity of the owners and staff while I wa swiating for my takeway. All in all a good experience and would recommend it to folks in this part of city

After a long delay, despite getting many recommendations from friends ,took my own sweet time to visit this new Chinese Eatery called the Royal Jade.The ambiance of Royal Jade is decent which is set on the second floor with the first floor being a take away or a waiting area.
Now lets get to the point, The Food. I was served by a young guy called Albert,who was very helpful in letting me choose the best items or rather the more authentic Chinese items from the menu.They also have a special menu, whrere they have specific items which are not there in the regular menu,so ask for it.

I started my meal (we were two) with some Fresh Lime Soda and Apple Soda and the Prawn Tempura (Batter Coated Prawns). The prawns were fresh, the batter was thin very thin and very crisp, it's the thin and super crisp outer coating and the fairly big juicy prawns inside made the dish taste so good. Ask for their green chili sauce when having the Prawn Tempura. Next in the Main Course we ordered for a Jade Special Fried Rice and Five Spice Chicken. The fried rice had all the ingredients  to make it oh so good. It really had that old Chinese flavor which we miss in so many restaurants now a days. As they don't serve Pork here if the rice had some pork belly it would have been heaven. Next in line was the Five Spice Chicken. This dish was awesome. The meat quality or the over all quality of all the ingredients were of very good quality. The Chicken meat was soft and juicy in the inside with a crispy outer coating which remained crispy despite being the gravy till we finished our dinner.It was awesome and a must order if you visit this place.To finish off the great dinner we ordered the traditional Chinese sweet dish  Darsaan. My wife absolutely loved the Darsaan, but I would say it was a bit too sweet for my taste and I would have like them to serve a bit more of the Vanilla Ice Cream with it. The cherries were a disappointment as they were not real! 

Over all the food was great, the service was very good too. Now two things I would like them to look in to, The Air Conditioner and the parking problem and a little more training to the waiters( I'm not saying or meaning by any chance that they are impolite or bad) so that they can be compared to the very best. And YES I would be a REGULAR now!
