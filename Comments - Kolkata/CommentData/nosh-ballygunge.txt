Ordering Desserts are very common in all cafes. Here we came yesterday for the very first time, wanted to order A brownie with vanilla where vanilla was not there so they refused to take ths order so as goes with dark chocolate fantasy! Hookah was okay! Pizza was good in taste! Planned to have dessrt which literally turned me up into a bad mood! Should improve it.

Nice and small. One can go with friends for hookah. Mexican hot pot is amazing, you can also get your hands over some board games with your friends and relive your childhood memories üòÅ

A rather small place with shabby interiors, more popular for shisha than its food.
The food is pretty palatable if not extraordinary. I loved the Chinese platter, the fried babycorn was absolutely to my taste.
The nachos were crispy and made for a good munch.
The brownie shake was chocolatey and absolutely amazing, would definitely recommend it.
The hot chocolate though was a bit disappointing.

Main things - this is a veg caf√©. Do NOT go for hookah because it's horrible here. The food is not at all great. Service is kinda okay. If i were you, i would rather go somewhere else.

Nosh was recommended by my husband as he normally go there to play. We went there to have Mexican pocket which is now our fav dish at Nosh. One thing I would ask them to change or rather renovate their interior.
Thanks!!

This place is not at all reasonable according to the ambience. The worst part is that they still take service charge from their guests which is now illegal in India and also a punishable offence

It's a small, cosy cafe located right at the starting of the dover road. Visited it on a friday with few friends the place was good but had no attractive interiors which otherwise would have got them a few points more. The food was okay. We ordered tarka maggi and 4 topping pizza. Pizza was edible and tarka maggi was yum. Overall the place requires improvement.

Location: if you're coming from Ballygunj, take the dover lane and it's right at the beginning of the lane. 
It's a two-floored hookah parlour with a FIFA playing set up in the ground floor. 
The place is nice and the food is decent. It's a little overpriced.

Loaction : Go straight from Panditia Hazra Road Crossing Towards Circular road.  Its at the end.  

The place is little shaddy compartively. Ground and 1st floor. 1st floor is basically bigger. 
The place is cheap but the food is not very good.  Still the place is all right to hangout with.  
Service is not very attentive but are friendly.  
Not a fine Visit and not a impressing Visit.

Edit :- 

Very bad experience:- 

Pizza was really bad ... supposedly thin crust ... but actually almost burnt ... hardly any toppings 
Service is v poor . Took ages to get the order .
There was no water served .  After waiting for 10 mins , when asked for water - simply got a 500 ml mineral water ( of course chargeable &  without any glasses / without asking for the regular water option ) 

For god sake - charge a service charge only if you can deliver even an avge service ... I get very irritated when there is a service charge anyway... in this case !!! Shocking ... how can they  expect( force)  the customer to pay a tip despite having such extremely abysmal standards of service .. 


Never going back again

A nice cozy place. It was almost empty when we visited the place last Thursday, perhaps since it was a weekday.

We ordered for a Mexican Platter, Shisha, Aglio Olio and mixed dimsums.

I liked the dimsums and pasta. Mexican Platter could have been better.

Shisha was okay, not amazing.

Overall a good experience.

As one of the happening places in Kolkata, Nosh is edging towards shady side. Granted it could be coz I went on a weekday, or that my expectations were high, yet still, the place didn't quite deliver. 
The ambience was just OK, food wise, certain things clicked, others felt they could've been better. 
We had ordered the Mexican platter/hookah/mocktail combo, mix Dimsum, and Agli Olio. The fries and nachos in the platter were amazing, the chop, not quite there. I felt like there were only 2 varietes of Dimsums(more were promised), but that could be as they tasted the same. The Dimsums weren't bad, but could be skipped. The ice tea was terrible, but the mohito was good. As for the pasta, I liked it, my friends, not so. 
This was my second time in Nosh, and previously they had a host of board games, which is reduced to a stack of Uno cards. 
Overall, Nosh has a lot going for it, but it can do better. Bring back some more games so that people enjoy more. And bring some variation in the Dimsum.

Walked in, decor looked nice, but the place is TINY - downstairs there's one small room, and upstairs it's bigger, but still quite small. Everybody having hookah, the smell of which I DON'T like, but anyway. VH1 on the TV, which was cool (Wiz Khalifa was on, which wasn't!). Menu card was torn. The AC dripped a drop of water onto my hand.

OK, let me get to the meat of the matter. I had a card from my gym giving me 2 free cups of coffee there - they tried their HARDEST to wriggle out of this. They said "First time, coffee free, and 10% discount, but next time, you only get 30% *discount*, no free coffee". Had to shout at them, then they relented. THEN, when I got the coffee, they said "Sir, you have to order something" and smiled. I had to be loud: "WHY do I have to order something?", and then they relented. I have enough stresses and strains in my life, I'd thought for *fifteen minutes*, I'd relax and have a bloody *cup of coffee* without adding to it! 

...When relaxing back on the sofa, it's normal tendency to pick up the menu and take a look at it - y'know what, after I had the coffee in my hand, if the food on the menu looked good, and the price was reasonable (I *did* take a look - since I don't eat out much, I can't compare, and I wasn't interested in pastas and Chinese (and for some reason, there was *MAGGI*!!! - who goes to a hookah bar to have Maggi??!!), but "cheese balls" looked interesting - is 205/- a good price? Seems on the high side to me...?), I WOULD HAVE COME BACK some day - after THIS, I *NEVER* will. Management - you need to FIX YOUR SHIT, do you get me?

Well, excepting of course, there's still the 2nd cup on my card, which I hope I now get. Oh, and btw the place is VEG!! :( (just, it has to be said - the coffee, the first cup was very good! :) )

Been there once with a friend who lives their only at ballygunge circular road and likes this cafe a lot so he took me ther.

Even i fond it very easy to locate as it is on the main road only.
I fond it so simply decorated with white brick walls, black sofas and colourful pillows on it, and red and blue lights, low hospitality.

We ordered for penne pasta in white pasta which was tempting, we finished it up in minutes as because of the taste and our hunger strokeüôà it was cheesy and so perfectly cooked. Then i had hot chocolate which i fond with more of water and less of choclate. Though it was not a very good experience. Will think to visit again.

Why do we go to a Cafe ??? Catching up with friends, Adda with school buddies, celebrating birthdays etc etc.... In all these we need good place, vibrant ambience, lip-smacking food and above all comfort to rejoice our special moments.
Nosh :- Is the place that gives us all. Outstanding experince !!!! It was friday evening, all of a sudden me and my friends ¬†planned to meet up and we landed up at Nosh. They possess some killing innovative skills in food innovation ( Mai ka Lal Nashos and Family Garlic Bread). The best thing is the extra effort they put up towards understanding the taste and preferences of a guest. Keep it Up Nosh !!! Next visit will be soon.....

Located at the mouth of Dover Road, Nosh is another of the hookah bar cum lounges that have mushroomed up in South Kolkata. Spread over two storeys, Nosh is an attractive place to hang out with friends. Not had the hookah here , but the Nachos and French Fries are delicious although overpriced. The lighting is dim , which I personally like. One suggestion : Guys, kindly improve the ventilation system. Too much smoke clogs the air, even for a hookah bar. Otherwise , a very likeable place :)

Been 4 years since i'm going here, believe me customer loyalty is really appreciated here. You just need to ask for new and innovative flavours and shibhu or suman would get right on it :D... Music is something that always keeps me hooked even when my friends bore me to death. Be it finger foods, service or specially hookah, top notch. 100% reccomendation. 
P. S- The pizzas, pasta and the mexican hot pot, totally worth a try!! :D

Impressive atmosphere, depressive seesha and finger foods. Ambience is well arrayed and established with a small chilling area on entrance and proper seating arrangements are done upstairs. 
Lack of customer communication with the staff.
We ordered a Chinese platter and a mixed sauce pasta which really sucked at our papilla.
The seesha was not proper as well.

I am writing a review just because they make a good hookah. I went their twice and realised its cheap and worth the money one can spend over here. Well, in a nutshell it's a good place which plays good music,nice hookah a decent pizza and offers a game of Fifa. I would have loved if they served non veg like many other places. In Kolkata you need to put chicken on the menu to make it work.

I hv visited this place yesterday and it was good to be back there after long time but in a new ambience.. nice hookah and very nice add ons.. especially the nachos and wai wai bhel accompanied with bhel.. & the best part i and one of my friend requested to play some love soft songs..so that we could use the centre area to dance and move.. over all a very good place to go with friends..

Firstly talking about the ambience the place is pretty good with FIFA to play on the ground floor. However the hookah was quite pathetic and on top of everything there was a person constantly poking us to order some food. We weren't much hungry and so decided to order something later on after settling for a cold coffee initially. But much to our surprise after a minute or two one other person came to inform us that if we don't order something we will be charged 300 bucks per person for playing FIFA. This is utterly ridiculous on their part.

‚úî Nice place for gaming and chilling out
‚úî Make sure you are hungry enough to satisfy their pockets or there are chances you might be kicked out.

A weekday afternoon to chill with a friend! We settled down on the ground floor as it was less crowded. Called for a teen pan rose hookah which was good. An iced tea which was decent and an orange soda which was okay. They should innovate on their drinks! We called for a four topping pizza.. The base was soft and it tasted just okay. What I hated the most was when we were sitting down we were asked all of a sudden to sit upstairs because they forgot it was booked and the guest had arrived. Unprofessional place :(

Ambiance was okay.. Too much of light.. Choice of food was limited.. We ordered pasta.. At first it had no taste.. We asked for replacement then it was much better than first one. Wai wai was good.. Sandwich was not at all up to the mark... Service was slow... Staff seemed inactive.. Everytym for everything we need to call..

Saturday evening to chill with friends i ended up at nosh. The place is located just a lane before st. Lawrence school on circular road.

This place i guess has seen the maximum number of name changes for a cafe. Currently named nosh it is yet another hookah cafe in a city full of them. Nothing makes it stand out as such but its not a place which u should desperately avoid.

The hookah that we ordered was decent. 

We ordered for the veg au gratin which we really liked. It was almost as good as it gets only if they added a few chunks of pineapple. Then we ordered for the garlic bread on pizza bread. It was really not upto the mark. It should have been a little more crunchy with a bit more of flavour and seasoning.

The pricing is on the lower side as with 2 hookah and the food our bill was only 1000 bucks.

All in all it was a good experience but they certainly have room for improvement.

Nosh is a very cosy place to hang out. Great ambience. Playstation available. Must try out the cheese fondue here. It's made in place of revv up.  Must visit.

3 of us went to Nosh with good expectations for its rating on Zomato is not bad. The gaming area is comfortable and the experience was quite enjoyable. 
I was badly let down by the quality of food here. We ordered Hot chocolate and Virgin Mojito. The latter was okay and didn't disappoint but the hot chocolate was a disaster. Then we ordered a Cheese Risotto. The rice was so course that I felt like throwing up after having two spoons of it. The flavouring was average. I asked it to be changed so that I be given another preparation but they said that that is how they make it. If you're only going for packaged drinks and gaming this place is good. But please don't try the items I have just mentioned. 
Verdict: Never visiting it again.

Located in ballygunge circular, a really nice hangout place. Has really good food which will delight your taste buds. The hookah is even good. Really good staff and the value for money is okay.

So revvv up underwent a fancy make-over! Yes, it is now called Nosh and the interiors have bettered!

Visited this place on 20.06.2015 for an adda session with my friends. While, the interiors have changed the layout is pretty much the same. The small gaming zone on the ground floor and the hookah area on first floor.

The sofa was pretty comfy and we sat down for a hookah session. The hookah
¬†( orange rasna ) was good and smooth. We also ordered their mai ke lal nachos and honestly, I didnt quite liked it! The sauce was just a packed mayo dip! Nothing tasty!¬†
The pizza we ordered was a 4 topping pizza with bell peppers, olives, jalapenos and babycorn. It was crisp and the chef had treated it well. A good balance of flavour between the sauce, cheese and toppings.¬†
We also ordered for a fresh lime which was good ( no art there)¬†

The service was pretty good and that's a big plus!¬†
Overall a good hookah joint.¬†

Last evening we were here,located near St.Lawrence school, this joint offers a wide range of Mexican,Italian and Chinese cuisine.We had mixed sauce pasta for starters which was perfectly flavoured but came in poor quantity.Crispy chili babycorn was excellent and most importantly it lived by the adjective "Crispy".Pizza was a bit tender and slightly undercooked whereas the Mexican lazania was an eye-and-tongue pleaser and is strongly recommended.
The most disappointing part of the evening was the poor service as we were left there,sitting,for about 45 minutes,waiting for the food to arrive.Although the person in-charge was courteous enough to apologise and promised proper service the next time.

Nosh, is an adda for hookah lovers primarily college going students. 
The cafe boasts of a gaming station which play station lovers can enjoy along with their food and chit chat session which works on a first come first serve basis. 
Previously known as Revv Up, Nosh has a great vaierty of shisha on their menu with a variety of mild and strong flavours and an array of bases to choose from and their hookah is definitely one of the best you could get in Kolkata. Other than that nosh serves decent pizzas and pastas ( can't comment on the rest since I haven't tried it myself ). 
The mocktails, however, are rather disappointing and are very simple and ordinary ( Try going for the milk based mocktails since they're way better than the soda based ones that are pretty much tasteless ).
The staff is friendly and will try their best to help you out with your order. 
They serve 3-4 kinds of combos at all times and make sure when you're there you ask them for their combos since they involve a great deal of saving. 
With good lighting and the typical young crowd at a cafe, the place is pretty lively and can be visited if you're looking at hookah or shisha as an integral part of your outing.

Completely redesigned revv up and we have nosh on dover road right beside st.lawrence school. Since i was a regular here i had to come see the new place. The interiors were great. The staff as always was amazing. Coming to the food, i loved the mixed sauce pasta and the chili baby corn. :) thumbs up!

Another new cafe in the city ! How could I miss it ? I guess its just been a few days since Nosh opened,and the foodie that I am,just cudnt resist paying them a visit.
Nosh opened in the place where "Revv Up Cafe " was previously,they just changed the interiors slightly- white walls,with colorful seating,there is a casual yet cool feel to the place with no extra frills.

Now talking about the food,we ordered the Mai ka laal Nachos,Peach Ice tea and Mexican Lasagnia.
Firstly,the nachos were of good quality.Even the Cheese plus salsa dip (even had corn in it) was fresh and tasted amazing with the nachos.But the big let down was the quantity.Also the server told us that the nachos would be baked with cheese,and there was barely any cheese on it !
Moving on to the drink,it was refreshing and not too sweet.
I must say that the best out of the three was the Mexican Lasagnia. It was baked very well with ample cheese.Underneath the cheese ,the mexican elements in it were beans,kidney beans,and all the stuffing you would find in Tacos.I absolutely loved it ! A great twist to the original lasagne.

The service was average.In the end I've decided to go for a 3.5- mainly owing to the Mexican Lasagnia.

I did not spend much time in there as I was hungry (which I always am) and in a hurry. The food tasted good. I had chicken with the basil sauce. The food was amazing. Service was prompt and waiters were very courteous.
The calmness and the ambiance looked like this could turnout to be a good hangout in the near future.
