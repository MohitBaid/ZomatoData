This small outlet holds a special place in my heart, as I used to stay there in that area since my childhood up to my middle school days. I used to frequently eat from here, i remember buying lassi, dosa and chhola bhatura from here a numerous times.

After so many years, my friend and I visited this food outlet again just to revive the old memories and trust me, the food still tastes the same. However, i personally did not enjoy the service that i had received today.

It was a Monday afternoon and the outlet was just getting busy from all the office hour rush. The owner of the outlet was irritated with the workers and due to that, he talked to us in a very rude way, saying "what do you want?" and "go order to the counter". I was really offended by this and the overall situation was really high as he was scolding literally everyone in the outlet, both workers and customers.

The food tastes good though but the owner should change his behavior towards the customers and the employees. I only gave 3.0 as rating because of my love for the food, i would have given more but unfortunately 3.0 will suffice for now.

Nice good place for healthy working lunches, especially of the dosa-idli kind. The pulao chhole I have eaten quite often and it's very tasty. The lassi is a must try too. And good place for working professionals with not enough money to spend on healthy deli lunches, especially of the 'shudh' vegetarian kind.
