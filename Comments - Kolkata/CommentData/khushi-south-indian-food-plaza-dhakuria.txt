The quality of the food has improved recently and they also do home delivery nowadays. The Dosas are good and crisp - that augurs well for me since I prefer my Dosas crisp. The Idlis are nice and soft and pretty much authentic.

In the flip side, however, the potato filling in the Dosa is on the sweeter side as is the Sambar. 

Overall a decent experience.

Located in Dhakuria bus stand, this is a very small outlet which makes very good quality south Indian dishes. I have tried their masala dosa, onion uttappam , tomato uttappam, mixed utappam, sambar vada, idly, dahi vada. All tastes wonderful. The owner of this shop is a nice person and he is sincere at his work. It is definitely a good option for takeaways, I have always opted for takeaways and home-delivery from here. If your house is near Dhakuria, you must have their food. They won't let you down. I
