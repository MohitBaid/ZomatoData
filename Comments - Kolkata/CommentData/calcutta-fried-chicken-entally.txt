This was a home delivery. The food reached on time. The packaging could have been improved a bit but it was spill proof nevertheless! I ordered for Chicken Burger and French Fries. The burger tasted good but I expected a lettuce leaf as shown in their catalogue but it was not there. The french fries were crispy and golden brown but a were too salty. There were two packets of complementary tomato sauce so that balanced the high salt. Since the cost is pocket friendly hence it can be a good option for a quick evening snack!

DOES NOT EVEN DESERVE ANY RATINGS....Unluckily purchased 4 pieces of fried chicken from 1/N CHATU BABU LANE on 11th September 2017 at 6;45 pm . Sad to state that while eating I saw blood oozing out from each of the four pieces. Immediately returned the same to the shop where it was purchased from. Though the shopkeeper tried his best to defend by saying that it was marination and then later accepted the mistake . This was my first experience with CFC !!!!!!!!! Your products are hopeless, worthless, and they cheat customersÂ 
Will never recommend this product to anyone and will never buy it again even by mistake...
