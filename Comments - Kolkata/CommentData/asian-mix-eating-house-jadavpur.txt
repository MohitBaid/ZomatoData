It is a nice quaint place located in the lanes of sulekha. If you are coming from Jadavpur after crossing the petrol pump turn the first right and you will see this one standing on the left. 
The place is tastefully decorated with quirky posters that will surely appeal to the youngsters. Other that that, the decor is simplistic and nice. There are 4-5 tables in all. 2 three-seaters and 2-3 two-seaters. The chairs are not super comfortable but manageable. 
We ordered Chilli Garlic Chicken fried rice, Singapore chicken noodles and chilli devil pork. It took roughly 15-20Mins to serve us. The food was piping hot, just what we needed in this cool winter. 
             Coming to the taste, the Chilli Garlic Fried rice was very delicious. There were lot of minced garlic in it with long strips of chicken. I found the shape of the Chicken pieces unusual. But they were plenty in quantity. Even the quantity of the rice was huge though at a glance, the dish seemed sparse because of the peculiar shape of the dishes we were served in. The Singapore Chicken Noodles was good too. In addition to chicken, it had Sliced mushrooms, bell pepper. My sister even suspected baby corn in it though I doubt her observation. The turmeric used in the noodles was a bit much. But in terms of taste, it was flawless. The Chilli Devil Pork was a winner between me and my sister. The spicy taste of the chillis accompanied with the tanginess of the bell peppers enhanced the flavour of the dish. The pork itself was very good. The fat to meat ratio was great though the slices could be thicker. Nevertheless we thoroughly enjoyed the Pork. 
Even though they are a more or less new kid in block, they are serving quality food. And maybe only one in the area to serve pork at such an affordable price.

Jadavpur is the new hub of economical eateries & is sure a good proposition due to the presence of so many students around. Asian mix eating house offers variety of items including pork items which is a welcome addition to the many more options around. 

So far i have tried the following items:-

1. Chicken lung fung soup - This was not your typical lung fung soup in terms of presentation. It was more close to normal chicken momo soup. The quantity & taste was lovely with generous amounts of chicken bits. 

2. Chicken momos - There were 6 thinly sized momos. The stuffing was decent. However the momo soup was horrendous since there was no salt in the soup.

3. Chilli garlic chicken rice - Spicy rice preparation with loads of garlic,chicken & other chopped veggies. The dish is high of spice factor, so be careful while ordering but tastewise it really stood out in my opinion. The hint of garlic with chilli schezwan rice certainly went well together. Recommended!!

4. Schezwan fish dry - 6pcs of soft basa wok tossed in chopped onions & capsicum. The basa were fresh & the whole dish had loads of flavours. Recommended

The prices are on the lower side. Also they dont charge any GST on home deliveries

Yesterday was the third time I had ordered momos from them. All three times via Swiggy delivery. Second time I received only momos without any sauce ...momo lovers know how disastrous it is to have momos with bottled sauces....that red chunky chutney is ' The' sauce for pahari momo lovers please excuse but the cheese n variants in momos make them foreign dumplings. Now coming to this joint. ..I called via zomato and spoke to the owner mentioning my previous experience. ..he apologized and said he would give me extra sauce and make sure the broth is given. Really appreciate that. Their momo as per quality taste and quantity is perfect to the T not the onion layered Bengali momo category. Excellent nepali momos with super hot sauce and chicken broth ...that too 6 pieces  for 60rs all inclusive. A big big üëç....I will try their phyalley and other dishes in the future. .as far as momo goes I've closed on them as my first choice considering its absolutely wallet friendly and desirable as per genuine momo taste. Foodies go for it !!

Ordered food through swiggy, so not able to locate this eatery correctly. We ordered Chicken fried rice and Chef's special tangy chicken. The fried rice was really beautiful, properly fried and tossed. The chicken dish was also good. 8 pieces of chicken tossed in a sweet and sour sauce. Price was very much pocket friendly. Next time will visit this place.
