Amazing cakes, mouth watering. Especially their Nutty Brownie one. We had it for two birthdays and going to order more for the upcoming ones. It is full of nuts and chocolates, nothing artificial!! Just loved it!

An awesome place to get delicious home-made cakes. The pictures indeed reflect the real product. I ordered a Nutella fudge cake and it oozed with Nutella. The menu gives a wide range of cakes to choose from and that is what makes this place Â superior to store brought cakes.
