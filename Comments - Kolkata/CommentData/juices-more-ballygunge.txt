Last week, it was an auspicious occasion of the anniversary of my grandparents and we all wished to celebrate the same at Food Court of Quest Mall.

Being in a group of twenty something, we all ordered from different outlets and tried all kinds of crusine. It was real fun.

However, all orders didn't have soft drinks provided and that is the reason for me trying to order from this place. My cousin too was with me for order execution and she wished to have some smoothie.

I went forward and handed over the food court card to the guy meant to take our order and asked for two large Coke, scanning the menu for my cousin's smoothie. However, he immediately informed me that large aerated drinks aren't available here. I pointed at the menu and he said that it isn't available in a rude way possible.

Dejected and surprised at this behaviour, I didn't feel like ordered anything despite feeling bad for my cousin. I simply asked him for the food court card and he said, "Yes. Take it. Take it nah" in a loud, rude and inappropriate gesture with look of disgust in his face. I failed to understand what wrong I did for me to experience that kind of 'hospitality' from him. However, I left without creating a scene as because all my family members would have been involved which would not cream along with the occasion.

A big disappointment from an outlet in the Food Court of Quest Mall. It was a surprisingly awful experience.

This place in the food court of the Quest Mall. The menu is limited, and not very innovative. Even then the drinks taste good. The cold coffee with ice cream, was good to taste and refreshing. The mango milkshake was not so great, have tasted better. Could visit once.

Situated on the 4th floor of quest mall ( food court ), i ordered one orange punch and trust me, this is one of the most delightful juices i have ever tasted in my whole life. It tastes so good, made of orange juice and yogurt, it is perfect to beat the summer heat. Prices can be a bit expensive, rs150 for one but trust me, after you have a sip of it, it is totally worth it!

This is located at the food court of Quest Mall, which serves a variety of juices, smoothies and beverages.

Ambience is nice and hygienic .

Service is prompt.

Me and my friend tried Fresh lime soda and mango smoothie. Both were enjoyable, refreshing  & delicious but still nothing extraordinary.

Pocket pinch is bit high.
