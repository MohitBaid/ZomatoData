I have ordered from this place so many times that even the delivery boy knows my house by my name. But yesterday I ordered a pizza which arrived 15mins after the estimated time and was really cold. It was bound to be so because the pizza came in a thin plastic bag on a bike, that too in a cold winter night.
Really disappointed as a regular customer of Friend's Pizza.

Bestest ever ЁЯШНЁЯШНЁЯШНЁЯШНЁЯШНЁЯШНЁЯШНЁЯШН i will never go back to dominos for sure ЁЯдЧЁЯдЧ. This is chicken magherita with extra toppings mushrooms and cheese burst. Medium sized pizza but it's bigger than usual. It's so big that 2 people cannot complete it easily. There is so much cheese that chicken and mushrooms are not visible; cayse they r dipped into the cheese. Worth the money. Unlimited chilli flakes n oregano r there. Clean restaurant. Overall 10 on 5 
Cheese burst is better than extra cheese though

The food was really delicious..the bread of the pizza especially.  The mayo salad was okay..
The cons are that they served too late and the interior is not satisfactory. They were playing some stupid Bollywood music of which we r not accustomed. The overall experience is not satisfactory.

Actually this is like chicken served on a paratha coz the crust is super thin, not worth the money.

Ordered Chicken Platter which I didn't find to be worth the money, neither was the quality good. Rather Exotic Veg pizza tastes good and can be tried !

Cozy ambience,friendly staff and good pizza.

The regular 8' pizza would appear bigger to you than you have seen in dominoes or pizza hut. 
Prices have increased over time,but I still find the place reasonable.


Remember to ask if the pizza dough is freshly prepared each time you visit.

I wanted to give negative ratings but can't. Worst pizza I have ever tasted. So much of oil in pizaa. They don't properly bake it. Pizza base is very bad. Less toppings. Too much expensive comparing to the foods qualities & quantities. Totally waste of money.

One of my favorite places in Howrah if we opt for eating out. I keep referring this place to my friends. It's positioned at a walkable distance from Mandirtala. A cool atmosphere, free wifi (this is becoming a trend for cafes) and live match screening on TV makes it a place you wanna go to chill out. However, they need to work on improving the decor though. 

Now, coming to the food, the pizzas they serve is pocket friendly. The crust is fresh & puffy. The volume of cheese is on a lower side (might think of opt for a Cheese Burst option next time). However, for me; the show-stopper here is the Pasta they serve. The taste is so drooling that you might not want to leave the leftover sauce once you are done. This item can give some famous restros in Kolkata serving pasta a good run for their money. The white sauce pasta is passionately recommended here. In pizza, we tried some varieties and amongst them Mexican Chicken is the one which was very soothing to our palate. 

Finally, we would love to visit here time & againt.  Wish to try the remaining varieties of pizzas & their other continental specialities.

Ordered the "Greek Chicken Salad". First it came up without the chicken which was then replaced with the chicken version. To my surprise, there was absolutely no seasoning in the salad. No salt. No pepper. It was just a bowl of vegetables not even properly tossed in olive oil. Even the shreds of chicken had no seasoning. I complained about the poor quality of this dish for which I paid about 160 bucks (including taxes) and there wasn't even a proper response.┬а
The other dishes I tried were the baked pasta and the chicken platter (no pizzas this time). Sadly even they were pretty average in taste - nothing to remember. I would not recommend anything other than the pizzas from here.

Ordered online from this place. Service was slow, took longer than an hour to deliver. I had ordered french fries and pasta, the fries were not even salty and due to the late delivery, they went soft and cold. The pasta was not good at all either. Overpriced for the quality of food.

Tucked away in a small lane in South Howrah, this establishment is a really Great find and a Very Good Deal for money. With a good variety of Pizzas and a greater selection of Pasta, Steak, Sandwiches and Burgers, one could  easily say this is one of the better places to eat in Howrah.

Visited this place just off mandirtala after a friend suggested me, probably the best pasta in howrah, do try the pasta with white sauce, a very cosy ambience. If you love pizza it has a number of good pizzas on offer. On the other hand it does not have restroom facility and the ambience can be better. Food wise its pretty good particularly the items with the white sauce. Its italian and cheesy. It could also do with better cutlery.

I have tried their Chicken mayo salad, Pasta, Chicken classic pizza.
The price they charge for the pizza can be hardly justified in matters of taste. It has almost no cheesy feel. Only the size is a little big.
The salad is good. Otherwise, in the location it is situated it is very pricey and the ambience is quite below the average bar.

This restaurant delivers online, a big relief as not much outlets delivers online orders in Howrah area. 

Pizzas are pretty much good as per regular Indian palette. The only thing I don't like in their pizzas is the base.. It seems as I am eating a burger, it should be a little crunchy from the base. 

A value for money pizzas, definitely once go for them rather than branded pizza makers...

I've had pizzas at Pizza hut and Dominos pizza and then there's Friend's pizza. By far the best pizza experience I've ever had. Finding the place could be a bit of work but it's totally worth itЁЯШБ. The service is great, the staff were friendly and the place is lovely. It may take some time for the food to be delivered to the table but I guess that's to be expected for a good pizza. The prices are reasonable and comparatively much lower to some popular franchises. Will be visiting this place again soon.

Very good quality pizza in affordable price range. I would say it's better than Domino's in taste and quality segment . Seating arrangements are okay okay. I have not tried other things apart from pizzas so commenting on that would be inappropriate. I tried two three types all are very delicious. Keep it up Frends' Pizza team.

I have ordered many times from this place and was never bothered to write a review. But this time the service was exceptionally poor. 
1.Pizza delivered cold. Taste is just bland. 
2.Burgers were disgusting. Ingredients of the burger were held with coffee sipper. 
3. Pasta with meatballs . Just tasteless..meatball seemed to be a refrigerated one. Pasta was tasteless. Sauce was practically invisible 
Service- packaging is disgustingly below standard. No seasonings served with pizza.

A much needed pizza joint in my locality. Almost tried every dish on the menu. Their pizzas never disappoint me. The chicken wings are a must try. Although they need to up their pasta game, other items are good enough for the price. Great place for hangouts. Staffs are friendly too. All in all Friend's pizza does a justice to it's name.

Did not even deserve 1 star probably the worst pizza and burger  had in my life. All red marks 

Way costlier for the quality of food. 
Oily and spoiled vegetables used for making
Super poor packaging

Please don't ever eat in here

Ordered a Double Chicken Pizza and Chicken Wings on 31st December. Expected a delay in delivery due to the festive rush. However, delivery was before time and the Zomato online ordering experience was hassle free.

Coming to the food part, we ordered extra cheese and extra toppings but the Pizza didn't seem to have anything extra and was a regular one. Nevertheless, it tasted good.

The Chicken wings were disappointing. They were far from what we generally have and tasted disgusting. The sauce was really bad too.

Not very happy.

Situated in Mandirtala, this place is quite good for hangouts with your friends, classmates or colleagues. Pizza being the major food item served here, you can also try burgers, pastas and other items. The cost of these items is quite reasonable. Home delivery facility also available. If you wanna relax with your buddies and have a nice outing, go give a try to this place.. тШ║

Located near Mandirtala Bus Stop. Takes around 2 mins from there. The ambience is not that good. It's an old place that is renovated for the dining purpose. Nevertheless, the AC was not working. Besides, the staff were busy within themselves. We had to approach on our own so as to place our order. The pasta turned out to be damn tasty. Though a bit costly considering the amount, it was relatively good.
We had also ordered pizza along with it. Sadly due to a powercut the pizza was half baked inside the oven and they failed to serve us. This restaurant doesn't even have generator service. We had to stay in darkness inside the place and had to gulp our pasta in that situation. Not even a single candle or any sort of light or anything was provided by them which turned out to be very disappointing. As per what we had, I'm rating this place.
They seriously need to work on their staff as well as they need to look into how to tackle serious situations like powercuts.

Hoping to visit this place again. Needs a hell lot of improvement.

P.S. - the bread seems soggy, kindly try to fix that.

If you don't compare friends pizza with Dominos or Pizza Hut is definitely recommendable pizza shop.

Very cheap compared to other pizza Giants. 
 pizza is fairly eatable. They provide home delivery via Zomato order so a good option for managing your guest with the hot Pizza. 

So the bottom line is its an option of course not the choice.

Went there yesterday.. The ambience is good... Things ordered by us was Reg French Fries which was really delicious..  I am an avid lover of french fries and it was one of the best french fries i have ever had.. It was served with a mayo dip..
Then came the chicken pasta in cheese sauce... It was good too but a tad bit sweet.. Had ample amount of chicken,  broccoli, mushroom, zucchini..  It was quite flavoursome.. 
Then came the 8" chicken tikka lover pizza... It was a thorough disappointment.. Though it had everything, reasonable amount of chicken,  capsicum and chese, still something was definitely wrong with the taste.. 

Would like to visit again to taste other preparations but i think next time would refrain nyself from ordering a pizza...

This was my third visit to this small yet decorated eatery. The restaurant endows a homely ambience and the perfect music with a high-speed WiFi adds to that. Now, for the main part, food is average. Compared to the price, the quality can improve. Last time we had ordered for veg pasta with white sauce which was good, but the barbecued chicken did not match any standards. Tried their pizzas before, comparably far better than the sides. Anyway, there's a lot of scope for improvement for this joint. Best wishes for the future.

Going by the reputation of having non-branded franchise of Italian/American eatery in Howrah being rare, this outlet surely drew many eyes after its opening.
We went for a large 14" American cheese lover pizza and another 8" small chicken tikka pizza.
Both had generous amount of chicken pieces with huge amount of cheese filling and fine Juliennes of veggies like zucchini and capsicum and baby corn.
Both the pizzas were equally tasty and quite delectable with apt combination of veggie and chicken preparations.
I'll surely come back here for more. 
Highly Recommended!

After hearing about this place from my friends and reading the reviews on zomato, I thought I must pay a visit. So i went there last Friday with a friend, and this is how my experience was..
The restaurant is in a very old building's(as it seemed)  ground floor. It's well decorated with the TV and AC and all the pictures of old Kolkata and a review board. Overall the ambience was actually nice. 
Now comes the service and food. The place was almost deserted at the time we went, there were only two more people, but still the waiters were pretty late to come and attend us  as because they were very busy watching TV in another room while we were waiting. At last when they came they served us water which was not cold in a summer evening like that, the TV was not switched on and they didn't even bother to do so. Coming to the food, there were wide range of foods ,but as we didn't have much time so we decided to settle for only veg pasta in white sauce ,French fries and latte. It took almost 15 minutes or even more for our food to come but after having the first bite we understood it was worth the wait. We loved the taste of pasta, simple and elegant. The French fries were also good and the mayonese was an awesome add on. When these were served they said that latte would take some time, but it was not served till the end. When we inquired , they said the machine was not working which was a huge disappointment.
Nonetheless, our experience was good and time was well spent.

Ordered from this place a couple of weeks ago. The pizza and garlic bread was pathetic. The pizza was smelly, like yeasty bread. Base wasn't made properly. It lacked freshness by a big margin. Garlic bread was soggy and not well cooked too. The pizza sauce used wasn't very nice as well. The cheese tasted old and sour. Overall, poor experience. Only the french fries were good.

A very cozy & colorful pizza joint with vibrant interior.Somehow i get lot of similarities with dominos in terms of products selection & name. Though slapping & stretching of dough requires fine tuning in order to improve product appearance. Pricing is high considering the product quality but in sync with portioning.Love the way they serve pasta both red & white with lot of fresh veggies & meat.Pizzas are very soft & cheese proportion is decent.Worth a try. Bon apetit.

At the same time I like to say that other stuffs like Chicken wings & Chicken kalamaki are not up to the mark. Specially Chicken wings are too spicy & Chicken quality is bit stiff. Apart from the food, ambience is awesome, all the cafe members are soft spoken, delivery time is up to the mark & prices are pocket friendly ЁЯШЙ

Ordered a chicken burger at home one of these evenings. The delivery was fast. The burger was hot but lacked flavor. Large chunks of sliced cucumber, roughly cut onions - not something which you look forward to in an ideal burger. The patty wasn't fresh and I could make it, though the taste was not that bad. There wasn't enough lettuce and they overloaded the inside with mayonnaise, which sadly couldn't make up for the obvious flaws. For 50bucks, this burger is a good deal but definitely not for 130. You need to up your game guys!

A minute or two from mandirtala. This place serves one of the best pizzas in town. They have 2 varieties: Cheese burst and normal. We ordered for pasta in white sauce and soo cheesy chicken lovers.
The pasta had a good quality but only if it had more sauce, it would have been wonderful.
The pizza was amazing. With the crust filled with cheese and loads of toppings.
After having them me and my brother where filled to the brim.
This place has good staff and free wifi! A place where i would love to hang out with my buddies.
Bought home a chicken royal pizza which was the same toppings pizza as soo cheesy except the cheese burst. That was also good. All over, it was a great experience!

Friend's Pizza has great pizzas, pastas, and chicken wings. They also have a pretty decent chicken platter. I did not enjoy their spaghetti with meatballs, nor was their kalamaki well-prepared (the meat was probably underdone). As far as service and ambiance is concerned, there are no complaints. They also have a pretty quick home delivery service.┬а
It's a pretty great place for Continental food considering the limited options Shibpur offers.

Finally I ordered from Friends Pizza. Was waiting to taste the pizza from this place. Hence we finally made the order. I must say that it didn't disappoint us. We offered Classic Veggie Lover, Classic Pizza and Italian Veggie. All were soft and with loads of cheese. Pizza was freshly baked and the topping was sufficient for the price. So it's value for money. Delivery was just on time.
Cherry on the top was using a zomato referral which gave 100 bucks of discount. Tummy aur Mummy dono happy..dinner se chhutti. ;)


One disappointment, oregano was not in the package.

I had visited this place along with my wife yesterday evening. Ambience was good. Music being aired was nice and soothing. D├йcor was standard. We enjoyed the Chicken pizza and fish and chips. The quality of the fish and chips was quite good. Above all food was wholesome and tasty. Wishing the outlet all the best in its future endeavors...

Considering where it's located , I would say it's certainly one of the best eateries in the Shibpur Mandirtala area. It would be unfair to compare it to the high end eateries in central Kolkata. This is happens to be in one of the busiest localities in Howrah. They are just a few blocks from my home. With no other decent alternative for ordering online nearby, Friends Pizza is quite good. They are quite generous about the toppings. Have ordered thrice by now and never disappointed.

Situated close to my college, it serves great food at affordable prices. Their Chicken Wings are to die for! I strongly recommend them. As the name of the place suggests, pizzas can't be far behind! I have tried their Italian Chicken Lover, Salami Chicken Lover and American Chicken Lover pizzas and I loved the Italian one! Pastas are really good too.

One of my personal favourites,this place has been picking its pace fast. You'll get great pizza at less than half the price of what the big brands nick from us. Plus, newer tit-bits keep getting added to the menu every now and then. There's nothing fancy about the set up or the ambience, though one can have a quiet time here. And if you're planning on getting some pizza delivered, this is the place for you. The So Cheesy Chicken Lover is an absolute favourite!

Ordered pizza!!  Classic chicken 8 inches and 18 inch classic veg
Pizzas were a delight.
Now if you compare them to fire and ice that would be unfair.
It's cheap its tasty 
The chickens are but hard on the teeth cheese is not as much as you expect
Elsewise it is tasty.
I loved them.

Edit (30.01.2017):
I am delighted to retract my previous edit of comments on this restaurant's food quality; They are back on track :) I am glad that they listen to & incorporate customer reviews.
Happy munching!

                Edit (30.10.2016):
The restaurant is slowly loosing its charm. I guess that's what happens when local restaurants try to profit more and use less good materials for food which got them into craving position in the first place.
Last night I ordered a Tikka Chicken Lover Pizza. The food arrived on time mentioned but was stale, not warm at all. and the funny thing is the distance between their restaurant and my home is mere 3 minutes walk (if they prefer walking).
Also the quality of cheese used now is not good at all. I do NOT have vomiting tendency, but the delivered pizza gave me a feel to vomit (quite literally speaking).
Before this, I had ordered pasta, pizza etc with a pepsi 1.5 weeks back, surprisingly they did not provide the pepsi. On complaining to zomato about it, zomato provided me with a 50 Rs. coupon against the cost of the pepsi. But this was not expected from a restaurant.
Even the recent ordering rating from other customers have gone downhill.
I surely will visit again, when they return to be more customer-focussed and people's ordering rating is improved. Thanks!

Original Review (11.3.2016):
Well, after nearly 2 years, yesterday, I enjoyed a warm 'adda' at Friend's Pizza with some of my best childhood-buddies; accompanying us were a finger licking Royal Chicken Lover and a Mexican Veggie. Put in simple words, the flavors were delightful, especially we liked the bread to topping condensation and nearly-no-crust authenticity. Though the cheeze seemed not adequate in Royal Chicken Lover (compared to the Mexican Veggie), and considering that they need some extra hands to wait at the tables, I would say we were content with the overall ambiance of the place, quality of the food, and moderate prices.
I guess the food tasted much better with you buddies- Saymanti and Debojyoti :)

I would definitely recommend this place. Note: They provide home delivery too, which's an added advantage ;)

Visited this Place today with College besties.
The ambience is pretty much minimalistic with almost zero decor. It's actually inside a house so the layout is pretty much like a house. But what this Gem lags in decor makes it up in food.
Some great quality pizzas are served here. Soft, succulent, cheesy but not heavy, generously applied toppings, perfectly baked: it's one of the best pizzas I'd ever had. The presentation is authentic as you'll find in an Italian pizzeria. But another drawback is it's location. Tucked away in a small Lane, we had the services of our local friend to guide us. But not at all,a convenient location for a location. 
Overall, I'd consider it a hidden Gem in the narrow bylanes of Howrah.

They do stand up to their name,a good place to hang out with friends and have delicious but pocket friendly pizza..1st of it's kind in the locality.
The pizzas are totally Value For Money and the ambience was a bit retro-modern mixture..
Now for the "not so good" part.The things they experimented with,came out unexpectedly incomplete.The chicken burger was nowhere on par with the pizza they serve,same goes for the side dishes.The cold coffe was an absolute failure.
Definitely visit there for pizzas along with their great hospitality but chose your side (dishes) carefully.

Delivery was quick, approximately within 30 mins ( not far from my house). Packing of the food was good. The pasta was okayish. Meanwhile, the Pizza was tasty, they didn't skimp at all on the toppings and it tasted quite good! Will definitely order again.

I visited Shibpur - the locality where this outlet is situated - on the Christmas and new year break after around 3 years. I┬аdiscovered "Friend's Pizza" on the way to Mandirtola.┬аLike other non-residential people at Shibpur, I had doubt about the quality of product. Eventually I asked my friends and got┬аsome positive feedback about this restaurant.┬аI asked my wife to join with me and to test our taste-buds here. I remembered we visited this place on new year eve.
The serving boy was very helpful and welcomed us heartily. When we walked in the restaurant, we found the place cozy and nice.┬аSeating arrangement was nice but I doubt at rush, they would not be able to arrange seating for all. Compared to other┬аbig pizza outlets such as "Dominos" or "Pizza Hut" in India, this outlet is not that big enough to accommodate all guests at rush hour. 
Anyway, we ordered "Royal Chicken Lover" pizza. Base of the pizza - the bread - was well baked and had some crunchy feeling in our taste-bud. Toppings and cheese were enough to force our mind to leave positive remark.┬аThe pizzas were superb in taste. Price for pizza was also reasonable. 
Next time when┬аwe will visit Shibpur, we are decided to taste pizzas as well as some pastas here. I shared positive┬аreview about this restaurant┬аwithin my friend circle. 
I will suggest my online - who is looking now for online review - and local friends to try out here. No doubt that this outlet can compete with other big names in pizza industry. I will certainly visit this restaurant next time and also encourage others to do so.

Pizza is made really nice here and it can give the nearest pizza outlets a run for money (since dominos delivery services are not available here yet).  And hence the rating! 
We got a take away pack for a 12 inch ROYAL CHICKEN PIZZA and it was baked well with good amount of chicken,  cheese,  black olives,  jalapenos and tomatoes.  The packageing was done safely and hence i assume home delivery is an easy option. 
Next the CHICKEN PASTA IN WHITE SAUCE was served in the most minute quantity i ever got from any joint.  The chicken pieces are pretty big cubes to serve as an add on in the pasta, no choice of the type of pasta,  directly penne was served.. and such a small portion. Not worth! 
The HOT CHOCOLATE now  was a glass of complan. Avoid. 
And now the decor of the place... it could have been converted in a lil parisian bistro with heigh ceilings,  checkered flooring, some chandeliers,  bronze mirrors and showpieces,  beige walls and white iron chairs etc..  but what it has is green walls with red flooring,  orange plastic chairs with check printed table cloth super wrapped with a sheet of plastic..  complete mismatching and utterly dissappointing interiors.
I wish they add more items to the menu other than pizzas and upgrade the interiors with a better taste.

A new pizza parlour is introduced into our locality named "friends' pizza". Well decorated and calm environment make your evening great. Worth of money. Their food is cheap and tasty. After returning from office one day i have decided to visit their parlour. I ordered double chicken lover overloaded with extra cheese and chicken. So yummy.. crunchy outside and soft juicy from inside. But what i don't appreciate is that their location. It is very difficult to locate if any person does not belong to Shibpur. I wish them luck. If they maintain it and surprised us with such a delicious and quality food then their journey would be more smooth.

I was browsing through the zomato when I have stumbled upon this place Friends' Pizza at Mandirtala. It was like getting a entrance in treasure island ....,;-) 
I have ordered in from here twice back to back on last Wednesday and Thursday. Their home delivery service is prompt and proper. They have delivered within 40mins....and Pizza was still hot!!
I have ordered one Royal Veggie lovers 12" pizza the first day and a 8" So Cheesy Veggie lovers pizza and a large French fries the next day. Both pizzas were awesome. Pizza crust was not thin but it was  not hard or chewy....it was soft but crisp, loaded with lots of toppings  and generous amount of cheese. It tasted delicious. Also it's cheap in comparison Pizza Hut or Dominos.....so it's in short awesome.

This newly set place at the heart of the bustling mandirtala bus stop is quickly gaining the reputation of a cool hangout place with continental dishes. Tried out their pizza(their cheese lover pizza is really good)  and grilled chicken last week and can be rated as quite acceptable as a new joint. The attendees were very friendly though pasta was not available at that time,as their pasta making machine was not working. we had a nice time with friends and relatives. Would like to visit again. RECOMMENDED.
