Its awful. Shouldn't recommend this place for sure! There are way better road side biriyani shops nearby Andul Road, just a few metres away!

Have there biryani many times while returning from my previous office... taste was ok... nothing to mention about deco, staffs and service... since it's just a road side shop... it's one of the pocket friendly options in the locality...
