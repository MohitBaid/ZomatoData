Okay so I've been visiting this place ever since it opened. Initially on my first visit we tried the fried chicken wantons, for main course we ordered mixed hakka noodles along with Manchurian chicken. For a first time customer I was bowled over by the food.
On the visits that followed I familiarised with the menu they offered. Here's a few things you can order here : the chicken momos both steamed and fried. The veg fried rice is lovely filled with seasonal vegetables such as cauliflower you even get some exotic vegetables such as zucchini in the rice along with baby corn, corn kernels and mushrooms.

They did a commendable job when we wanted to throw a birthday party for a friend. Since we're regulars to this restaurant they made sure to win all our hearts. They decorated the entrance with balloon gate, the seating area was decorated with bunches of balloons and a happy birthday ribbon. They made the cake cutting special by switching on the rice lights.
For the birthday we had decided a set menu which included Mongolian chicken, chicken steamed momos, crispy chilli baby corn and crispy chilli mushroom. For main course we had ordered veg noodles and veg fried rice along with Hong Kong chicken and schezwan chicken. The pocket pinch came up to about Rs. 1200 which fed 7 hungry mouths. We literally devoured every thing.
Everything here tastes fantastic especially the Mongolian chicken this makes your taste buds flutter in a frenzy with its rich flavour. Another all time favourite would be fish ball soup.
Shout out to the management for such a commendable job. P.S : They did not charge us an extra penny for the decorations.

I would urge everyone to take a trip to this hidden gem near Philips More on C.I.T Road.
