Quite a popular joint in the area... Basically it's a local fast food joint... Where you can't expect any ambience, decor or first class service... But one can't expect bit clean n clear environment... Which is also not available... Pretty unhygienic place... I tried their egg chicken roll... They don't use sauces in the rolls... Tasted decent... Served quickly... Most important thing is... It's very very pocket friendly...

Mosala Club is an eatery located at Kalighat.

Ambience is ok , service is bit slow , staffs were nice.

Tried egg chicken roll and chicken momo.
Chicken momo was decent but chicken roll was ok, not that good .

Overall an average experience.

রাস্তা দিয়ে যেতে যেতে পেট কে শান্ত করতে হলে আসা যেতে পারে তবে বসে খাবার জায়গা থাকলে ভালো হত  । চিকেন রোল খেয়েছিলাম ভালই লেগেছিল । তবে আরও অনেক দিকে নজর দিতে হবে বলে মনে হয়েছে ।

Roadside takeaway located near the Gurudwara - one of the oldest eatery in the area. Their specialties are mainly chinese and rolls. Had chicken roll - the taste is average. Service is too slow.

Ok but nothing great. However, considering its strategic location (Kalighat Sitala Mandir; right at the exit of the heavyweight pujas like Badamtala et al and numerous tuition centres nearby), this place is doing a steady business for last ten years or so. 
It's basically a fast food joint with a few stools.

It's a roadside food joint opposite gurdwara.I tried their chicken steamed momo last winter.Momos were big in size with sides of spicy sauce and hot broth.It was the perfect comfort food for a chilly evening.It made me feel quite warm.
I also tried their chicken roll once which wasn't that good.Maybe I'll drop by this winter too for a plate hot steamed momos.

Apparently a roadside food joint, do not expect much from this place. Tried Chicken Noodles here, which was okay, but nothing exceptional. The positive thing here was that, the service was quick enough.

Walking empty-stomach through rashbehari avenue, I and my friend were searching for a place to a have some snacks. As we passed by this, my friend suggested me to have rolls from here. I was hesitant but as she was reluctant to move any more without having anything, I decided to settle our hunger with rolls. But unfortunately the chicken roll was very bad. It was very oily and full of onions. Hardly any chicken piece reached my mouth and i left disappointed!

Just a roadside eating joint with no sitting arrangements. You have to take away the food or stand and eat there. The chicken chowmein was really good to my surprise as I didn't expect too high from a place like this. But yes, it's good. Really good. Happy Dining! :)

I first had the taste of Masala Club when I was working under as an apprentice under my Senior, whose home was near to this place. One client had brought him chicken pakora from there, and I just loved it. Since then, I went there several times and even now I go there to take parcel of chicken pakora, prawn gold coin etc. The food is hygienic, and the staff though busy aren't rude. A very popular joint in that area.

I have been to this place several times & had also taken home deliveries. Although being a small joint, Mosala Club serves one of the best Chinese food I had. The quality & quantity parameter of this place is just Awesome.
