They charge you 18% still it has reduced to 5%..and when asked the waiter about it,he told us to consult to the authority of the hotel for it.

Horrible food with a terrible service... The ambience was so so... We were allocated a place with the cash counter in our backdrop... Nevertheless a restaurant must be known for its food... To begin with, we ordered chicken lolly pop which was mediocre in taste... For the main course we ordered fried rice... The rice that was served to us was stale as no sooner did the man serve it,we could get the rotten smell from it... On complaining the manager or whoever he was, he started justifying the cause... His excuse was the rice wasn't stale but was made of refined oil and that we were misinterpreting it as if we eat out of kerosene oil... After much humdrum the food was changed...The thing that came next was not at all good in taste... Going to that restaurant was the biggest mistake to say the least

After the sindur khela at Bagbazar on Bijaya Dashami, we visited there for the lunch. As we were only two, we had ordered Veg Fried Rice with Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. The rice was very fresh, the gravy of the side dish is also very tasty. But the chicken was somehow frozen. Need to improve it. 
The price is little high. But the ambience was very good.

Worst place I have visit ever! 
I have visited the place twice..and ordered for chicken lolipop, Veg noodles and garlic chicken!
Lolipos- Not even properly cooked. There was raw meat and blood inside the pieces of chicken! And when we asked them for replace that item, they ended up with this dish after we had our main course (Almost after 1 hr)! 
I mean no point of having starters after main course. Right?
Okay ! Now coming to the main course...
Veg noodles was just so so and garlic chicken without garlic and with garam masalas like star annies!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Chinese dish and star annies- What a combination !! üëèüëè
Pieces of chicken are so hard And lack of salt of salt in every dish!
Overall very very low quality food. 
And the best part of the restaurant is that 
if you order for chinese they will serve you north indian first and then chinese! üòë
Staffs are so careless inefficient. They don't serve you food and unmentionable part was that they were least bothered about all these!

The place is near shyambazar 5 point crossing and it's in between cloth market.Hardly visible if u walk on the footpaths.Only visible when you walk on the other side of the road n meet an accident.Had Hakka noodles ,chicken in B.B.Q sauce and crispy baby corn.I didn't like the food,the baby corn sauce tasted like medicine and the chicken was dry inside noodle was okayish. üòêüòêThe ambience is not at all good,waiters looks way too confused.I would suggest you to go there if you are hungry af or else no.

Went this year during saraswati puja... the place is really not near to my expectation. Its near by shyambazar five point crossing.  I had chinese cuisines there. Chilly paneer, chilly chicken, hakka chicken noodles, masala cold drinks. But food iz not that good as it costs.. another prob iz the ambience. The staffs r not that good full of hollow attitude. Better you can handle that... the time they are taking to provide food also not up to the mark. All over bttr only to go if no other choice in that area.

It's okay for a restaurant to not have breathtaking interiors and an ambience worth mentioning, but if that compromises with the hygiene of the place, then that surely counts as a huge turn-off. The menu is pocket-friendly, and the quality of food is average. Overall, the place isn't quite worth recommending.

Went there for some office treat on a hot afternoon of April. The AC was not working, even though the place was previously booked. The food was ordered yet it took around  25 mins to reach our table. The people were clumsy, toppled down a glass full of water and took almost 5 minutes to clean it. Very disappointing. The food was not that good either.

This was my second visit to this restaurant, and on both occasions I couldn't complain about the taste and quantity of the food they serve. Don't know why this one has such a low rating. North Indian gravy items and curries are their specialty, apart from Chinese, which is also served here. Most of the dishes are tagged at a range of Rs.150-250, although butter naan seemed quite costly at Rs.45 per piece, which again wasn't sufficient for one person. My favourites were Chicken lababdar, Chicken do-pyaza and Paneer malai kofta.
Interiors were dimly lit, service becomes slow and clumsy whenever there's a rush..! They need to improve on these grounds... seriously!

One of those restaurants which have really long menus, but almost all the items are unavailable. Servers are ill-trained. They will go back to the kitchen every time to confirm if a dish is available or not, most of the time returning with a no. 

The location of the restaurant is the only positive, also looks good from outside. But once in you will understand that it's a badly maintained property. 

Food is also not up to the mark. 

In all even if you are around it is best to avoid this place. There are to many better places around.

Fluctuating experience for d 1st time in my foodie life!!!
One incident happened...positive
2nd one....negative
3rd positive.... 4th negative  n so on.

D positive thing was d beautiful decor of this 3 floored food joint. very clean,all over d restaurant is decorated with many mocktail displays,tables r very comfortable n decorating.

D negative thing was normal crispy chicken(only 10-12 were in d plate)was overpriced, we were dumbfounded wirh their quantity. Orders were misplaced; we ordered chicken with bar bQ sauce,they gave schezwan chicken n very spicy.

D positive comes there after. Chicken bharta was very very tasty,we liked it so n so much. butter n plain tandoori roti were tasty,no complain.

Then again I counted negativity. 1st floor was small n there a birthday party was going on,u couldn't concentrate on ur partner even. It was really unprofessional n embarrassing, they should make a separate room for reserved parties only.

Then again I found positivity. Service boys were very cordial n helpful n service was very fast n prompt.

So...mixed reaction,hesitated rating. Though I didn't taste Chinese here,but I ve found Indian cuisine is really good.

Worst restaurant ever!! Frst of all we ordered chicken gravy noodles which they didn't serve. They served a totally different food, I.e. Chicken biriyani. The biriyani  they served is horrible in taste. The Interior decoration is very nice bt the main thing which they r trying to b known for is the worst. It really TWISTED my TONGUE. I am sure dat am not going to check in this restaurant further in my life.

Its is an ok kind of restaurant. Interior is well decorated..good service. There is nothing great about the food and includes VAT. We ordered crispy chilli baby corn..to our disappointment both  the quality and quantity of the food is low. But since shyambazaar area has a dearth of restaurants, its a good option.

As the name says, it actually brought a 'Twist' in the 'Tongue'. Initially, it served brilliant food, but with time, it has degraded like anything. Be it in terms of quality and quantity.

The place was ok. Food was not that great. We had tandoor items...paneer do pyaza and chicken do pyaza..the paneer dish didn't have any taste. It had some boiled paneer with gravy. That's it! All over a disappointing experience!

Tongue twister is a small restaurant but it serves decent food..didn't much experiment with the food though..we went for safe options like crispy babycorn n pepper chicken for starters,n had butter naan n chicken reshmi butter masala for main course. The pocket pinch is not much n if you manage to get a seat the food is enjoyable.

Just close to the Five Point Crossing of Shyambazar on first floor is Tongue Twister. Its mainly a Chinese restaurant with a small and comfortable occupation of area. ¬† ¬† 
I and a friend arrived here quite late for lunch(actually that was almost tea time) and were very hungry. We ordered for Schezwan Fried Rice and Hot Garlic Chicken. The food arrived quickly and was found to be tasty. And ultimately the bill was pocket-friendly.
The staffs were friendly and the ambiance was welcoming. Can be recommended for quick visit.

Went to tongue twister a few times. They are mainly chinese cusine resturant. The food is ok. The resturant waiters may not be all friendly. We faced some good waiters and a bad waiter. The food here doesn't take much time to come after order has been placed.  Not something special that needs to be mentioned but then again they do not charge you a huge amount and so I am quite satisfied with the pricing and the food. Just avoid going there during festive season as the quality of food decreases quite a lot. Other than all these this is a good resturant located in shyambazar that provides you good chinese food.

I've been there like 3 times, n out of that, the experience was good only once. Something or the other was always off. Be it the freshness off the biriyani, or the cooked onions, it was never quite pleasant like one would have liked. Although price is alright, quantity is ample, but poor food quality is always a deal breaker.

The first thing that attracts us when we walk inside a restaurant is the ambience..undoubtedly it was spotless and up to the mark. But the thing that matters the most is the food served... This was the first time i went to that restaurant and there was really nothing which would disappoint me..starting from the pricing..which is quite pocket friendly..to the quantity and the quality of food which is also quite good. But I would like to talk about one particular dish..the Chicken in bbq sauce that i ordered..it tasted a lot sweeter than i had anticipated..other than that the tastes of the other dishes which i had ordered such as the Garlic chicken,the mixed fried rice were all good... The restuarant is worth visiting another time...easily accessible from shyambazar metro station..this place can be very rightly regarded as one of the best in chinese cuisine in and around the area..

Situated right at the shyambazar crossing towards bidhan sarani,this restaurant started with much hype and used to serve delicious food at the beginning, however their quality and quantity have deteriorated heavily in the last few years.
The ambiance and decor are nice and simple,craftily done,with various spices displayed beneath the glass top of the table, you also get a view of the 5point crossing, however they fail miserable when it comes to the ultimate parameter,i.e. food. Firstly most of the items are not available almost all the times, secondly their waiters seemed to be out of place without proper knowledge of the dishes they prepare.
Last time we ordered:
Barbeque Prawn: It tasted overly sweet,prawns were too much crispy and sticky
Salt n Pepper Chicken: A bit better, but the chicken cubes were too much fried to get the flavour
Chicken Lababdar: It actually taste better, based on a creamy tomato sauce,blends well with tandoori roti
Fish Amritsari Masala: Horrible!!in one word, instead of preparing it with bhetki or basa they actually made it with rohu fish..and it tasted horribly bad..
Overall the pocket pinch is not much, probably around 1200/- for four of us..but that too can't justify the lack of professionalism and the poor quality of food..
Food: 1/5
Pricing: 2.5/5
Service: 1/5
Ambiance-3/5

Have been visiting Tongue Twister since it first came into being, a few years back. At that time, it was the only good restaurant at Shyambazar, which served innovative cuisine. Have tried some really nice dishes including Wine flavoured rice, Roasted lamb in red wine sauce and Chicken in oyster sauce. Very pocket-friendly restaurant with a pleasant ambience. Somehow, I miss the seats facing the window which used to give a pretty good view of Shyambazar crossing. Lovely decor, a massive aquarium and friendly staff make it a decent hang-out zone. However, it is not a very spacious place, and mostly gets crowded in peak hours.

A friend treated me for her birthday there. It was probably a year ago and the menu has changed since. However, the ambiance is not bad. It has big glass windows and an aquarium, so you can sit around and watch the fishes for a long time (which I did). The food was okay, just as good as you expect from these tiny eateries. We ordered fried rice, chicken tikka and chilly mushroom. The portion size was pretty reasonable too. However, the chilly mushroom (can't find it on the menu anymore) was really good, extra 0.5 for that. Would be sad if it turns out that they discontinued it.

However, coming to the restaurant. 
The service was a bit slow but the waiter was courteous and guided us about the order. 
The ambiance is just fine but was a bit more congested. 
And yes, the bill was tooo good for the pocket. Have planned to visit it more often. ?

most ridiculous restaurant i have ever visited..
we ordered mixed fried rice first but they said they dont have prawns, all prawns related items out. okay, then we ordered chicken ¬†szechuan fried rice and egg fried rice with szechuan chicken and bar-b-que chicken, both were listed under starters.. anyways, they brought that after little delay, everything except szechuan chicken fried rice were disastar, their szechuan chicken was the worst chinese dish i ever had. my favourite chiese dish was szechuan chicken but i will be petrified next time ordering it. the quantity is average and the prices were little lower than the better chinese restauarants, but this place just awful. not a single dish deserves praise after the visit i just sad that i waste 300 rupees for nothing. just awful!!!!

...the service was in total disarray...the food I had was:
1. Chicken lollipop: Over cooked and the chicken was dry
2. Mixed Chowmin : Under Cooked
3. Shejwan Chicken : It Tasted something like Achari Chicken
The best part of my dinner there is a glass of sparkling water served in an under washed glass...WHICH STILL CONTAINED THE LIP PRINT of the PREVIOUS CUSTOMER who drank from it....

Towards hatibagan near shyambazar more,  stands the tall and bold tongue twister. Now this is interesting,  because shyambazar more hardly has great restros . On a first look you feel, the tongue will get twisted with the appealing decor it has. The beautiful decor will steal half of the score. Coloured mocktail wine bottles, coloured lights, light music will really steal your heart away. Rightly someone has said, you should not judge a book by its cover. Firstly, half of the things on the menu aren't available.  They dont have lamb, the don't have basil rice, nothing continental or oriental is available. They only lay stress on the tandoor section and so they prepare it real well. This attitude disappoints those who want to try beyond indian dishes. Secondlt, the staffs look lost , they do not know what next to do. They do not keep an account of what's available. So we ordered in for a full tandoori chicken, which was good. But definitely I have tasted  better tandoori chicken in life. Then we order for a chicken mushroom soup. Mushroom wasnt available.  So chicken sweet corn is the only leftout. The chicken sweet corn was however awesome in taste. Then we were full.  So we decided on a mocktail.  Mocktail wasnt available.  Now plan 2 we ordered for an ice cream.  The ice cream with chocolate sauce and nuts  amazing it was , except for the fake cherry they used as a topping. But amazing did it taste. Then we had to wait 15 minutes for the cheque. Finally left deciding never to go back to the restro until they improve the multifaceted problems.

I had visited this place a few days back with a friend of mine who claimed that this used to be a pretty decent value for money place.But our experience this time around was pretty average.
The place is located conveniently very near to Shyambazar five point crossing.The entrance though is small and can be missed with the amount of hawkers in and around the area.
Though there is mainly Chinese and Indian cuisine on offer,the menu is quite extensive.Having heard that the Chinese fare is better and also since we did not have much time,we ordered a simple Mixed Fried Rice,Chilli Chicken and Garlic Chicken.Even such a simple order took quite a while in arriving.There was nothing much to complain about the food but there was nothing much to be too impressed about either.In short they were all just about okay.The quantity was pretty good.
The interior is simple.The service is slow.The prices are reasonable.Overall,I do not know how this place used to be,but we on our visit found it to be just about okay.

Situated in the first floor on a very busy shyambazar crossing, we visited them long back in 2011 wen they were very new in the business, with time this resto has lived up to all our expectations. visited a week back, there is still shortage of place, bt the taste remained unchanged !! the menu available here was really unusual.. we ordered for chicken dumpling soup, steamed chicken momo, crispy prawn in honey chilli, tongue twister chickn special, chicken in thai red curry, Burnt ginger flavoured rice, Nasikorean rice, tooti frooti and Mango Tango. the rates were really cheap and the cooking was excellent. if you are a large group of people comin togeda.. avoid this shack !!! they wont be able to accommodate you all :p

Service is very very slow, if u dont have sufficient time plz dont make the mistake of going there. The ambience is not at all praise worthy. Food is of very average quality. Dont think any body will like to visit it for 2nd time

Food was awsum but now qulaity has degraded. The food you can say is ok. After the puja a lot of food items are closed.( As on Nov 2013)

I was quite impressed on my new visit on 17th January 2014. They trying to organise their resturants by giving quality and tasty food which had degraded in last couple of few month when i have visited couple of times. They have added a lot of items in their menu card. The sevice is quite qood. The food is hiting our taste buds in a positive way. They are taking comments on food, services and also is their anything they can do for better result. 

I ordered Chicken clear soup, peas rice, prawn malai curry(6pcs) and for the desert ice cream.... For this I am rating them high after this visit.

When it started,the ambiance was very good with wonderful decor, mouthwatering food but as days passed it became total disaster...... no care for the decor. sometime looks like a fast food centre and the food quality has deteriorated a lot..........
worst experience......

Except the importance of area, there is nothing at Tongue Twister. Food quality is not up to the mark as per price. Quantity is quite low. Music plays very loudly, which sometimes very unbearable. Decor is not so soothing. Place is quite small & arrangements are not good.

Finally can say that, this restaurant is not the worth of money...

The location is the best thing about it, though they need to decorate the entrance a bit, cause its place you can easily miss in all the chaos of hawkers on the streets. The setting is quite good, the way they carved out a beautiful restaurant in such a small space. The food & price is average.

Mainly chinese foods but u can find indian foods also. Chinese dishes are ok. but indian foods are not upto the mark. Some thai dishes is also ok. Well decorated but its too small. Service is very poor. Its take minimum 20-15mints for serve. U will not satisfied by the staffs. I think Rahamania is better for Biriyani. And Gajab and bagicha is better for chinese. Just 2mints from shyambazar 5pnt crossing. Prices are affordable but the dishes are not good..!! Ambiance is ok. Overall Average.

Tongue Twister is definitely first of its kind in an area like shyambazar. I personally had Thai Food which was undoubtedly nice..Service was also good. Ambience is more or less okay.. One problem is that the space is a bit small..Also you have a good deal of variety under one roof.

The only positive thing about this restaurant is its location, located at 5 points crossing of shyambazar ,everything else is on the negative side.. management is poor,they give table which is meant for six to 2-3 people so even if almost 50% chairs are empty still you have to wait in queue for long time..  we waited for 30 mins  at reception and then went up and saw atleast 15 seats were empty..  waiter took long time to take order.. though menu card shows plenty of items but almost 60% of those were unavailable. waiters tried to push items of their choice,reluctant to give what we ordered.. there was no bathroom at the floor, everybody have to go all the way up to 3rd floor to wash their hands. after giving order they took 35 mins to serve.. food was pathetic.. hakka noodles were hard & dry & tasteless, kulcha was small in size, tongue twister chicken was very poor, half boiled chicken mixed in spinach paste, pathetic in taste.. there were shortage of manpower,1 waiter serving 3-4 tables so after calling them they were taking long time to come.. if u want to eat good food and not in a mood of time wasting then avoid this place.. i wont go there ever..

The only place where you can find lamb in this area. The food is not mind-blowing, but is definitely satisfying. The Hakka Noodles and the lamb dishes, especially the roast lamb, is worth a try. The menu is extensive, and there are some innovative dishes for those who love to experiment. it is not what you would call 'sophisticated' cuisine, but it is value-for-money, and is worth a visit. It is the best you can find in this area, especially if you are looking for Chinese cuisine. The Mughlai cuisine remains questionable. I would personally prefer Rahmania for biriyani and kebabs, which is a stone's throw from this restaurant. The ambience of Tongue Twister is nice and the decor is not bad as well.

Very good restaurant with lots of choices in menu.....Interior is very pleasant with soft instrumental music all round. Although they take much time for serving the food but after such wait the food what they serve and the taste will definitely melt your heart. I went there several times and tried several items but mostly I like their yummy and mouthwatering Singapore Noodles, Bhetki kebabs , mutton dishes and off-course the biryani... recommended to keep time in hand and go there to fill your taste buds with soft & low music soothing your ears and eyes on your dear one...
