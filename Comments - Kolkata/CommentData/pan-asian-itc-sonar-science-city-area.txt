Great food at reasonable prices for a luxury place is the high point of this restaurant...the starters were excellent especially the chilli pork...in the main course we loved the pad thai and the boys enjoyed the fried chicken with its separate sauce...their specialty dessert with the icecream and coconut jelly was beyond comparison and the warm mud pie was also welcoming

Visit went well to Pan Asian restautant. We tasted their Thai food. It was good but not spicy at all. The Thais do add some heat to their dishes! Service was good too, but there were no condiments on the table or offered. We had to ask a couple of times and then they ran out of pepper shakers! Highlight was the cake they served as we went for my mother's birthday and it was very sweet of them and the cake was very sweet too. Too much. An egg less chocolate mousse cake.

Amazing experience. Starters recommended are water chestnut and crystal dumplings . Pad Thai noodles is well made ! Jasmine creme brûlée and mud pie can’t be missed too! All their exotic sautéed veg are well done :)

Had lunch yesterday at an old favourite [not reviewed yet by me] at Pan Asia, Sonar. We had Tom Kha Gai Chicken Soup [with delectable coconut milk and lemon grass], Bhekti Teriyaki, Pork Char Bao, Lamb Konjee, Wok Fried Veg Noodles and Chocolate Mud Pie – all items to die for.
However, the eldest, the most knowledgeable epicure I know, tho not a reviewer, pronounced all A1 except the fish [not the sauce] which she said was a little dry. It was a bit, only because the fish came from the fridge for cooking, and not straight from the pond without refrigeration. This I felt was setting the bar too high, as every high class hotel is dependent on a fridge for supplies of its extensive ingredients, and cannot aspire to the extreme freshness of limited ingredients home cooking. We had a little dispute which the chef came to know about, because we were seated next to the open kitchen area and he was quite distraught, tho I personally kept saying it was the best of the best. Definitely 5 stars in my opinion.

First time visited Pan Asian at the ITC Sonar. Fabulous food. We had the Sunday Oriental buffer consisting of Japanese ,Chinese, and Korean.  Needless to say the quality of food is unparalleled, right from the crab sushi to the Mongolian chow to the lamb and the duck as well. 

Starters like the Prawn and chicken satays we're absolute winners! Mocktails were nothin to talk home about..The Italian smooch was decent. The ambience wasnt really up there. The loud live band was quite an ear sore. It was too loud for an afternoon lunch. Maybe ITC needs to look into this.

*Restaurant Week India* has started from 4th October, 2017 and will continue till 15th. You can discover and enjoy the signature dishes in some of the finest restaurants of the city. The restaurants are offering a well curated 3 course menu including an appetizer, a main course with a staple and a dessert for INR 900 (Plus 18% GST, and INR 62 reservation fee) per diner in Kolkata.

This year, 5 restaurants in Kolkata are participating in the event including ITC Sonar and The Park among the Five Stars.

You can book the table for 4 person max and the best option is to go in a group of 4 so that you can order pretty much the whole selection from the menu.

This was my 8th restaurant visit in RWI and second time in Pan Asian.

We ordered 4 Appetizers - Salt and pepper chicken, Crispy konjee lamb, Wok fried chili prawn and Fish Takrai. All the dishes were tasty, well suited for the Indian palate. The ingredients were fresh and the assorted veggies retained their texture.

The appetizers were followed by 4 main dishes - Xwan Thou Wu Chong Xhau Chi. - Su Xhai (Stir fry chicken with garlic and sprig onions), Kaeng Kiew Warn (Chicken green curry of coconut milk and Thai herbs), Shredded Lamb in Chili Black Bean Sauce and Fish in Hunan Style along with Vegetable fried rice, Vegetable braised noodles and Chili-Garlic noodles.

All main dishes were well balanced and palatable except the noodles seemed a bit too dry. Portion sizes were enough for one person.

For desserts we ordered - Jasmine Tea Crème Brulee with Vanilla Ice Cream, Pan Asian Darsaan, Assorted Cut Fruits with Vanilla Ice Cream and Date-Pan Cake. All were ok, nothing to mention specially as such.

Chilled Indian Chenin Blanc paired well with most of the dishes we ordered (~150 ml / INR 800 per glass).

Service was pretty good, as expected from a Five star restaurant. Our server, Gaurav, was attentive and helped us choose the right dishes.

Once a wrong dish was served in our table, but that didn't cause an issue because they changed it as soon as we pointed that out.

The food taste of Pan Asian improved significantly since my last visit in 2015. I would recommend it, if you are looking for a fine dining Asian restaurant which serves dished well suited for the Kolkata-Chinese taste-buds.

Food Taste - 4/5
Service - 4/5
Price/Value for Money - 3.5/5
Ambiance & Décor - 4/5
****************
OVERALL - 4/5

[What the Ratings Mean - One is Poor, two is Satisfactory/Acceptable. Three is Good/Average, four being Excellent and five Extraordinary.]

Went on a Saturday for its famous Teppanyaki. A multi course meal (you'd lose count) coupled with a green tea to remember. 
Food - 9/10 - everything freshly prepared right in front of us. We could choose the kind of sauce, we wanted our dishes to be prepared in. Absolute treat! 
Service - 10/10 - everything that you want from a 5 star, and a bit more. The chef kept us entertained between dishes, with some of his tricks. Overall engagement was great. 
Special mention for the mango based dessert. You must try it.

We celebrated our anniversary here along with our parents. The age of the hotel shows in the deteriorating decor of the restaurant as we found ac water leaking on us from the ceiling. However the food is simply awesome. The service can be a bit slow but they more than make up with their knowledge of their menu. Surely ask the waiter to suggest your food - you will not regret. We enjoyed a lot. It is on the more expensive side as you would imagine for a 5-star property so deducting one star for the old and ailing infrastructure.

Planning on Chinese! Look no further! The pricing is bit on the higher end, but there are days when you deserve to be pampered. Do ask Mr. Gourabh to make your meal memorable! 
Do look for fish or chicken takrai, for the lemongrass pinch! The pad Thai noodles is a must try for the Thai food lovers! It's the whole package of good service, good food and ITC, which makes you want to come again and again :)

Well this restaurant is amongst the outskirts of the main hotel building. We visited this place on the occasion of my birthday and came to know that this place is superb blend of all flavours of East Asia, perhaps the best in Kolkata. You need not have to hunt for restaurants with multiple Asian cuisines if you dine here since they serve authentic Chinese Thai Mongolian Japanese Korean and Indonesian. The servers were very skilled and prompt. They also served us a cake in a beautifully decorated cake trolley which we felt monarchy. Shall definitely try their teppanyaki live grill next time. A MUST VISIT in Kolkata...

Pan Asian was one of the many restaurants that I wanted to try out since a long time. Due to restaurant week , we were able to got there. We ordered for crispy tahoo, crsipy broccoli, vegetables in Thai herbs and the sushi as starters. One thing that I did not like was the serving portion. It was too small , enough for one person. However , the dishes tasted good. Crispy tahoo was basically fried tofu tossed in a Thai dressing with fried sweet basil leaves giving a fresh aroma and flavour to the dish. The vegetables in Thai herbs tasted similar. Crispy broccoli has a very thin layer of batter surrounding it and it was tossed in a sweet chilli sauce. It was lovely. The sushi that they served us were small , with planets of galangal and wasabi and two slices of pickled radish. One of them had avocado, one had celery and the California roll had carrot , cheese, avocado and celery in it. The sushi was wonderful. 
Coming to the main course we ordered for chilli garlic noodles , garlic fried rice, steamed rice, Thai green curry, vegetables in miso gravy and stir fried greens in white garlic sauce. The chilli garlic noodles were not good , they tasted very average for the quality of a hotel and were cold. The garlic fried rice was very well cooked. I must say , the Thai green curry was the best I've had here. It had the dominance of coconut and Thai herbs , the aroma of the kaffir lime leaves. Stir fried greens were also amazing , with a garlicky broth. The vegetables in miso also tasted unique , and there was definitely the creaminess of the coconut and the saltiness of the miso. 
For dessert we had the mango pudding , the chocolate mud pie and the coconut ice cream with coconut jelly. The desserts were phenomenal , specially the mud pie since it's my favourite here at ITC. The mango pudding was served with vanilla ice cream and the pudding was soft and proper in sweetness. The coconut ice cream was absolutely wonderful. The coconut jelly added a new texture to the dish. 
All in all we had a good experience. However there were a few things that disappointed us. First of all , the presentations of food. It didn't look like we had come to eat at a hotel. The minor details like cleaning the sides of the plate , making sure the food is not too oily , the basic garnishing and making the food look presentable was missing. 
The waiter was alert and helpful. He suggested what we must try and also happened to serve us an extra serving of the mango pudding so that we wouldn't have to share. That was very generous of him. But we had high expectations from a restaurant of a great hotel which serves such good food in the other restaurants it has. 
The ambience of the place is beautiful with good lighting. They have a live kitchen too.

I went here to dine out on my bday celebrations and overall we were only two of us. The place is cosy and nice ambience but the marker to the entry is quite narrow and unexpected. It took some time to get to here after asking reception. Secondly the food choices are quite diversified and centered arround asian cuisines, we definitely were not in a mood to taste anything non spicy so went with some spicy choice and there wht the bellied expectation was drolled over. The drinks were good.

But the worst part of our dine out in Pan Asian and as well as at ITC sonar was that i felt i was in the era of Malaria Mosquitos. That's something that was way very bad experience at such a exclusive dining place.

Celebrated our anniversary there and I must say it made our day special. This restaurant is actually outside of the main building of ITC sonar. It has a gorgeous decor and ambience mostly in black. 
They have a large options in their menu and we're almost lost deciding the items.The attendant was very friendly and helpful and suggested us a good combination of dishes.We were moved by the hospitality of the staffs there. Finally we decided to order chicken teriyaki in starter, mixed chow and double roasted pork in main course.
The chicken teriyaki and chow was awesome. no complaints but the roasted pork was not up to the mark. 
They have a quite decent options in cocktail also. we ordered long island iced tea which was perfect.
And last but not the least they served a beautiful chocolate mousse cake on the house. I was really flattered to receive that.
Now coming to the bads. We didn't expect mosquitoes in a five star restaurant. Two staffs came with the mosquito killing bat upon complaining but that hardly helped. Otherwise the whole experience was good and worth the money.

Pan Asian is one of those places which I hit to taste their Teppanyaki and Sushi. In winter, they tend to have a hotpot promotion going on, which i often avail, and mind you, the hotpot is quite a large meal, so sharing is a good idea. I also like their soups and the shredded lamb, which is very addictive.

The staff was very attentive and their recommendations were spot on.The ambience of the place is soothing too.We had the chicken indonesian satay which was pretty authentic, the satsuma age which was like fish mince dumplings Japanese style. These turned out to be my favourite out of everything we ordered. The wok fry chicken noodles were nice and the golden fried prawns lat mai kai style were delicious..All in all we would be making another trip..

Dining is Pan Asian is an experience and what better way to celebrate our first anniversary than to dine at one of the best. Please note that I would not discuss value for money here, coz if you are in a 5 star you better be ready to shell out some moolah. Have said that the prices are not that exorbitant also as are some in the NCR 5 stars. The decor , the hospitality are excellent. Chilli garlic prawn and the prawn dimsums were the best I have had in a while. The soups , fried rice basil chicken were prettymuch as expected. A special mention for thier hospitality specially , Soumen Dey who was quite courteous.

Next time I would like to try their teppenyaki, but I do not know the rates.

Pan Asian has become a particular favourite with my family especially since their palate can not meander too far away from Chinese and Asian food at best. Yet the visit a week back, especially with my sister visiting from outside, turned out to be an unqualified disaster with all of us leaving disgruntled at the end. 

It is the server who basically defines the experience in a restaurant over and above the food and we were unfortunately paired up with one who seemingly did not care enough and seemed curt in his dealings. Being on point is still okay in my book, but mixing up orders which happened with my sister and blaming it then on her is not. 

Coming to the food, their fried rice was delightful as always but surprisingly the Fish Takrai had a distinct smell. To be fair, when this was pointed out, we were offered another freshly done one. The braised noodles left a lot to be desired while the pork chops could have certainly been better. 

It could very well be that the lack of warmth which is usually synonymous with Pan Asian, could be the reason that we critiqued the food even more than we usually do. 

However the bitter experience might mean that we would need to find a new Asian place now to satisfy our cravings. Even though it might have been a one-off, it will be difficult to douse the sour taste that was left after this recent visit.

I meet Executive Chef Jerry Bernasol a few hours
 ago and found him at the open grill preparing Japanese veg delights for a group of people who have already set high expectations on his Tepanyaki.

Though the open grill under the Executive Chef just not defines the mood of Pan Asian and the romanticism that it stands for, on the contrary, Jerry does make lot of differrence here.Spinach pancakes are a talk of the town.

One must try either Veg or non Veg Tepanyaki with Chef Jerry Bernasol , and the same can be truly a  memory for any family dinners like me.

Chef Jerry is expert at crafting the dish as per your palate right in front of you on the live grill ànd this is what Tepanyaki is all about.

If you are at Pan Asian, Thai garlic prawn called Kung Kratium is a must try.Peiking Duck of Sunday Brunch with live music is simply amazing.

It is always a good idea to drop in here with family and friends for a Sunday Buffet spread of veg and non veg. Unlimited pour of top brands of white spirits at 2750/++ only.

The restaurant belongs to one of the top hotel in Kolkata, no doubt the ambience is stunning with decorative items and fantastic architecture. Most importantly unlike some other restaurants it has proper and balanced lights to make things look brighter and prominent. Music was very much soothing and nice collections. Food- sone of those dishes I have ordered are quiet amazing and yummy but I must say they lack in absolute high standard services. They seemed like quiet casual and took a while to perform a request even though had some handful of guests. It wasn't  busy  at all compared to other restaurants so they cannot give an excuse of perfoming a task at the speed of a crawling insect.

One of the most luxurious places that comes in my list.....Have been to many luxurious Hotels and Restoras...but Pan Asian is something different and satisfies me good enough.Awesome Ambience with excellent service including the quality of the cuisines.Every person should visit atleast once to feel the vibe and spend a royal evening with family or friends.......Would give a 5 star rating to Pan Asian - ITC Sonar Kolkata......

This spacious restaurant with modern decor is the Asian specialty restaurant at ITC Sonar and is actually located outside the main hotel premises. They offer a wide range of Asian delicacies, probably more so than any other Asian restaurant in Kolkata. When I go to such places I try to sample as many of the exotic dishes as possible, dishes which are not usually available at other run of the mill places. I tried their sushi, the roast duck, pork in Teriyaki sauce, Japanese style salmon, Thai rice noodles etc. Most of the dishes were good. But when you are paying such prices, you expect something more than that. You expect things to be uniformly great. Which they were clearly not. Nevertheless this is a decent place to try out some exotic Asian food on special occasions. I hope to try out their teppanyaki some day.

Being a big fan of Asian cuisine I couldn't think of anything better than this in the heart of the city. ITC is famous for its food and quality and this restaurant offers what it claims. Starting with the ambience it's pretty classy with a touch of orientalism. Service is good and staffs are humble, professional and courteous as expected from a 5 star hotel. We preferred to have a la carte and tried Japanese, Chinese and Korean specialty. We had crispy diced duck and tempura fried prawns for starter, salmon and rice for main course and darsan for dessert and all the dishes were brilliantly made. It's a wonderful restaurant and so far in my opinion(considering the places I have been for Asian cuisine) serves the best Asian.

Lovely restaurant. A great place to dine in, with a wide range of food from various cusines. We tried the Japanese and the Chinese at the same time. I didn't like the Sushi to be honest. The raw fish is not my type. The other items were very good. We had salmon in asparagus, chicken in white sauce, prawn fried rice and sweet n sour chicken. The desserts was the best. I had a mango with vanilla ice cream and that tasted heavenly.

One of the best Asian Cuisine I had in my life. It drastically changed my view on Asian Cuisine and and availability of authentic Asian Food in Kolkata. I had Beef in Teriyaki Style, Salmon, Sushi with Eel, Golden Fried Prawn in Rice Flour and a very rare Riesling Wine from Germany.  Food Quality, Freshness, Ambiance is on the top.

This place is genuinely splendid, be it service, food quality, decorations, ambience isnt much to brag about though...ambience was on the good side....but nothing exquisite or too overtly attractive...

Coming to the food: they have an extremely good buffet. The starters and salads were in sync to my tastebuds.....the main course is something to look forward to, since its more than just plain chinese... which I enjoyed alot. All items are fresh and hot. Then the dessert...this section was equally a champion when it came to soufflé, cheesecakes, tarts, crème caramel, cakes, ice cream, there was one thing that i really wanted to try more...but couldnt because I was already full ...that would be their chocolate cake or brownie that was richly stirred and submerged in thick chocolate sauce ...as an ice cream topping. I loved that.

The staffs' services and behaviours definitely fetch this establishment their name and star. Very friendly and helpful. Had a really good experience. Would definitely revisit.

I did..and completely satisfied with their food to  service . It's bit expensive apart from other classy restaurants...but for a special night hope u won't think for expenses. Cost for 2 person is 2000 INR. With drinks.

Have been to ITC Patel, Mumbai a couple of times and the food and service everytime was exceptional. So naturally had high expectations from this place. But to shock the service was very poor, the servers looked completely disinterested. Not what one would expect from the likes of ITC. Had to call the servers again and again even for a glass of water. The food was just about okay, nothing great at all; was seriously very dissatisfied.

Next up, the billing, where they revised VAT and Service Tax, which is okay. However to my utter shock they levied something called at WBST at 27℅ rate. I asked the billing desk for an explanation to which they said it's in their system so they can't do anything about it. This is highly unfair and unprofessional. This may actually be illegal because other than VAT and Service Tax, there is nothing called as sales tax anymore.

Overall a terrible experience at ITC Kolkata, will never come back for sure.

Well went here a long time back , near about 3 years back with my fiance. 
I would not complain about the ambiance as it has to live up to its five star standards.!!

The food was okay, cant put it the category of gourmet cuisine !!!! .. Well in these kind of place you pay for the ambiance and brand ..so food tends to get overshadowed..

There was just one tiny problem .. a mosquito in my cocktail .. After pointing it out , I thought atleast they would replace the drink .. but alaas all I got was an apology ..

Anyhow did not matter much as I was too engrossed in my love life.. Could not let a mosquito ruin the date for me :D

And hence a 1.5/5  for you ITC ( In your face !! )

Cheers

We came here to celebrate my brother's birthday. We were a group of 14 and had made the booking and decided the menu beforehand. The staff is very polite and helpful. Since it has asian cuisine, about which I have little idea, the staff explicitly explained us about the different dishes and recommend us the best as well. The ambience is undoubtedly  amazing. Also since it was my brother's birthday, we also got a complimentary cake and a table decoration. 
Now the food, was very good. I am not a big fan of asian food , but the best asian food tht I have had is here. Overall this is a very good place for celebrating any ocassion.
The only thing I wish to improve, will be the time taken to bring the order. It really takes a long time.

Went there for my bday celebration and my experience in a word is SPLENDID! From ambience to food everything was AWESOME.We ordered 1 starter, 1main course and 1 side dish and couldn't finish the side dish completely.The quantity served was more for 2 persons.The taste of the food was simply too delicious!The staffs were very much well behaved and prompt in their service. While we were booking they asked whether there were any special occasion or not and at the end of our dinner we actually know the reason for this.They gave me a huge surprise! They arranged for a cake and decorated it with candles and asked me to cut it.The cake was very soft and creamy and the taste was too much delicious.It was totally made of cream which makes it unique and the size was also pretty good. Now coming to the ambience it was very sophisticated and soothing. The price of the dishes were a bit on the expensive side but at a fine dining restaurant and that too in ITC it's not unnatural accordingly. I am too glad to celebrate one of my special day of the year there and will wish to celebrate some more other special occasions of my life also.

This place is great for your special Days. We went for our anniversary , and the service is good. The complementary cake was mind blowing.

Ambience is just great, and interiors are just elegant. 

Food is good, but not the best in town. And you don't expect this place to be pocket friendly.

On weeknights, it will cost you 4000 for two , If you are non alcoholic.

ITC hotels are known for their food, and Pan Aisan is no different. The only deterring factor is perhaps the pocket pinch which keeps us from frequenting the place. We generally settle for the set menu called FUJI which is priced at Rs.3000 per person plus taxes. However, the spread is more than enough to satiate your hunger and taste buds. The set includes Miso soup, salmon and asparagus in chef's special sauce, a lovely fried rice, sushi platter, a selection of chicken or pork loins and also a choice of dessert. The best part of it is that the chef custom makes the items as per your taste (spice level etc). There is also an ala carte menu. The restaurant also offers a commendable wine selection.

The Asian cuisine at the ITC Sonar , as soon as you enter you see the tepenyaki station in front of you , where the chef  cooks the food in front of you. They have set menu for the tepenyaki. 
They also offer the a la carte , which has variety of options.
I went with the a la carte menu and ordered 
The crispy fried lotus stems for starters which goes well the hot garlic sauce , veg sho long boa dimsums which was also nice and maki sushi veg which was good.
For the mains ordered the jasmine rice veg with veg basil miso which was good and a must try.
Sadly they didn't have any sake to go with the meal.

The service was fast and the staff was helpful. And they have a good selection wine.

Going agian soon for the tepenyaki.

Per head cost was Rs. 2500.

Food quality was best and the interior inside was mind blowing. Although we had a luxury and great dine with our family I personally feel the services could have been slightly better. When you are at a 5 start rated hotel you definitely don't expect each and every time to ask the waiter for water. But nonetheless, no complaints on the food which was ordered.
Be it the seafood soup or the lemonade with Ginger Ale it was great. the starters and the main course comprised of chicken, duck, lamb, pork. We had them all till the last bite. Was over-stuffed by the end and thus couldn't accommodate the dessert.

Yummy ! Stuffed ! Over eaten! But still not content ! Came out of the restaurant feeling some what like this.. I've been here a few times before but never tried the Sunday brunch.. It's incredible. Amazing lay out of assorted sushi.. Extremely wide spread of starters brought to your table by the wonderfully warm staff. Dim sums et al.. I could honestly not reach the main course since I enjoyed the starters too much.. The desserts were Gorgeous too. I would recommend the place for any day any meal. But the Sunday brunch is the best I've had as far as this cuisine goes.. They also arranged a big big butterscotch cake to wish us for our special occasion but since it was too big, they immediately got us a small chocolate ganache/mousse/cheesecake cake!! Even though I'm not a chocolate lover, I LOVED the cake ! Wooohooo kinda feeling.

The best asian restaurant in the city. Their Tepenyaki is one of the best I have had through my travels around the world.  A special mention to their salmon in Teriyaki sauce which has been mind blowing for quite sometime now. You would then probably ask why a 4/5?. That's because I feel their ala carte is weaker than their Tepenyaki. Sometime the food we have ordered has been special and sometimes its been just good (never average though !!). I also feel that the restaurant is in need of some renovation. The furniture is worn out. One does expect it to be pricey, but then the food must be outstanding as well outside their Tepenyaki option. A great place for asian fine dining though with a lot of repeat value due to an innovative menu.

Now this review is certainly long overdue. We visited this place for my sister’s anniversary dinner. The menu came in parts and was a little confusing and the service was painstakingly slow. But while we were waiting for our food to arrive, we could see the Japanese chef juggling his knives, eggs and coins and catching them in his pocket and hat, and yes, rustling up drool-worthy dishes while doing all that.
                                                                ...

I have always been of the opinion that the ITC group of hotels has the best "hotel" food. Pan Asian will offer you your standard 5-star hotel asian menu. However, what really makes it special is the Tepanyaki meal. This a multi-course experience where all the food is prepared live in front of you. The seafood is usually fresh and the sauces are addictive, the teriyaki salmon is perhaps the best I have had (and I've eaten a lot of teriyaki salmon all over the world). The japanese fired rice and miso soup to end is a perfect exclamation mark on a great meal. Yes, this meal is very expensive - the perfect celebration meal in my opinion. This is where I go when I'm craving something grand and at the same time comforting.

Been there for buffet lunch. Did not find that outstanding feeling of the spreads as the name suggests,  at times some counters looked so deserted. I think the charges were for ambience spread and brand rather than the menu.

We had a delectable meal including a specially made duck in hoysin sauce which was particularly memorable.  The rest of the food was above average, par for the course in any good 5 star eatery.

Frankly disappointed.

This is my favourite ,well ,Pan Asian restaurant in Kolkata and I have spent innumerable evenings and some afternoons dining and lunching here.

Some of those moments are etched in memory because of the sheer gastronomic delight they provided.

Today when we went in with a hearty appetite,incidentally the first time with a desire to critically review for Zomato,the place fell short.Tragic.

The start wasn't bad.We had a large platter of sashimi covering Tuna,Salmon,Crab etc and it was super.So was the Sushi platter with its variety of Sushi and maki rolls.The wasabi and soya were perfect and we looked forward to the next in line...

It was dim sums next and we had a crabmeat dumpling and pork and prawn dim sum.The crab was overpowering in smell and the pork wasn't anything to write home about.The apt word might be ' dull '.

The mains were jasmine teppanyaki fried rice,tenderloin with brocolli,lobsters in sweet chilli sauce.Well , all of these items were ordinary,neither justifying the high price nor the fact that they were being prepared by star chefs at Pan Asian.

I think the Pan Asian is afflicted by the disease of taking their success for granted.Sad,considering the loyalty they commanded after years of good work.

Wonderful experience every time.   Live Teppanyaki (the Japanese art of cooking food on an iron griddle)  must be tried.  One of its kind in Kolkata. The Pepper sauce and basil miso sauce are to die for. Food that you will not get anywhere else in Kolkata.  The menu for Teppanyaki is almost fixed , so no hassle of choosing what to order.  Just sit back and watch the adept chef cook in style and serve you elegantly. You would love it.  Must try it out.  Bon appetite !!!

Favorite restaurant in Calcutta! Absolute must for an elevated Asian experience. The signature dessert, coconut ice cream with jelly served in an actual coconut, is a must. If you're out for a special date, go for the teppanyaki experience. Worth the moolah! Love the high ceilings and yet simplicity in food prep.

Okay, the best thing which happened on my 25th birthday was the wonderful extravagant dining experience at Pan asian.. with neat black decor and perfectly lit charming ambience.. impeccable hospitality.. and mind boggling good food.. it truly deserves a 5 on 5!!
The staff led us to our pre booked table and guided us through their menu encompassing a wide range of asian cuisines. We ordered a plate of open faced steamed dimsum CHICKEN CHAR SHIU MAI and it was amazingly delicate and flavousome. For mains, we chose Thai.. PHAD THAI NOODLES which was heavenly and must try here.. the Chicken side dish GONG BAO JI RAO.. suggested by the staff himself was tangy and peppery and made an awesome combination with light and subtly tasting noodles . The portion sizes were good for two and we were too full for desserts.
What came last, was the beautifully decorated chocolate mousse cake and I was so touched.
Thank you, Pan Asian.. The experience was truly grand and worth every penny I spent there.

Absolutely wonderful! Has the best sushi in town. Also loved the Korean hotpot and the dessert of mango pudding with green tea ice cream was delectable. It was a memorable meal for both the wonderful food and the incredibly heavy bill thereafter. But the food and the great service totally made up for it. Hope to visit again as soon as I have a lot of money! Only suggestion would be to look into the music, as it makes up a large part of the ambience. Some light jazz would make it perfect rather than the ad jingle like tune playing over and over.

Amazing experience. Was there to celebrate Anniversary. I have been to ITC SONAR couple of times earlier. But, this time it was with Near and Dear ones. Spell bound ambiance along side delicate architecture of ITC. Sense of proper lighting actually creates the mood and it can't be better than this in KOLKATA at least. Even a simple dish like Dimsum brings different flavor. Very enriching experience from all the stuffs around. Each and every gesture shown by the team actually complementing the food they were serving. 2 hours stay over their with family was worth remembering.

When the four of us survived heat stroke and a failed attempt to be volunteers at petfed..we decided to just cross the road and enter ITC to have dum pukht biryani. To our dismay the place opens only from 7 p.m. So what next? We had to use Shruti's discount coupons or whatever they call them and hence we decided to enter Pan Asian. ... I gave this place a chance to have my first sushi and boy it did not fail me! You have to order the sushi platter there. After a sumptuous sushi treat we moved on to our next treat. Hotpot!..Unending conversations, planning for a small trip etc. Etc. continued while the hotpot simmered away to perfection! An ideal Saturday afternoon to remember :)

Overall, a wonderful experience. We left with big satisfactory smiles on our faces.

If and when someone asks me THE FOODIE QUESTION, I always reply with: Pan Asian was where I had my life's best meal till date... Absolutely spellbinding ambiance, first-class service, and some really really good food to begin with... I was speechless at the grandeur and the level of sophistication of the spread, and of course, ITC Sonar Bangla itself... 

Rating-wise, Ambiance: 10/10, Food: 9.999/10(just because there's no limit to perfection), Service: 10/10, Pricing: 9/10(see,I'm not that rich, but the actual pricing is quite reasonable considering the sheer Awesomeness of the Pan Asian Phenomenon... So if you can save 1600 bucks for a BBQNation, add 500-600 more and come here; trust me, it's worth it)... 

Some awesome dishes: for the Appetizers we had Crab Thukpa with Scones baked with a Thai twist... For the Mains, I, especially, liked the honey-glazed duck shards, with a Cantonese jus and a Mei-Foon platter... And for desserts, we had Orange&Basil chutney... 

Salivating already?!?!?!... Well grab your credit card and go!!!... It truly is a lifetime experience...

Classy and delicious … describe my experience at PAN ASIAN ITC SONAR . The suave interiors , the live counters with the chef belting out magic and food alike and the aroma around are all sure to please you in more than one way ! Their SASHIMI PLATTER is something you cannot miss and so is their PEKING DUCK . I was a little disappointed when we were served SALMON SUSHI instead of the SUSHI PLATTER that we had ordered but they totally made it up with the taste and that little surprise at the end as it was our anniversary . Prices are pretty steep but then you cannot really complain. Overall my experience with Panasian was subtle yet mindblowing  just like their Asian flavours !

My idea of a romantic date was limited to poolside/rooftop dining till i visited this place to celebrate my girl friend's birthday yesterday.

Initially i was a bit sceptical about the cuisine as i was trying Japanese for the first time.We took "FUJI" - a 5 course meal including sushi,salmon,rice,chicken,soup,desserts.Didn't like sushi a lot,learnt it grows over you with time, but simply loved the dishes that followed, instantly, in no time! The main USP of this place is the live counter where our friendly master-chef Jerry interacted with us, showed us lots of his culinary and gymnastic skills with his kitchen-ware. He simply delighted us by making a heart with an egg yolk on the kitchen slab, arranged the fried rice in shape of a heart and wrote Happy Birthday with salt to make the day even special. 

There's a wine shop offering exquisite champagne & wine from across the globe.The ambience is classy.

    The staff is very warm and courteous.They complimented us with a beautiful birthday cake to our surprise. In short, we were completely bowled over! So either you wanna taste authentic japanese/chinese/korean dishes or you wanna celebrate your special day, "PAN ASIAN" deserves a visit! Highly recommended. Do check out my uploaded pics for details.

A great feeling when u get to see a fountain while walking towards Pan Asian. The inside ambience refreshes your mind with live music by great musicians. Top class hospitality and food is amazing. Don't forget to try out the special sparkling white wine from France and grey goose vodka and another type of cocktail(i am forgetting the name). The bar attender will get you the best drinks. A place to be surely visited. But make sure you are not restricted to just chicken or mutton if you want a proper lunch or dinner. People with a taste of variety would love to be here. The live music and the inside ambience is worth mentioning yet another time.

Party, romantic date, light and subtle dinner after a tiring day of work? Looking for a place that's gonna satisfy every condition? Well, Pan Asian it is! 

The restaurant's got it all. From fab to taste to glamour...everything! This is the place I always visit to look for a subtle and simple yet extremely delicious pan Asian delicacies. It's not so expensive either, compared to other ITC Sonar's restaurants or even Taj Bengal's chinoiserie, so it's gonna favour the pockets for you too! 

There's a dish named Honey Braised Roast Duck with Orange Extract ( not too sure whether it's the correct name or not, had this long back). All I can say about this dish is that packing a punch is its regular job! No person who loves duck will ever turn away from this. A must try! 

The ambience is very calm and quaint. The cutlery used is quite good and has a very posh attire towards itself. The staff are friendly too. 

So, overall, this place is the perfect place if you're looking for delicious pan Asian delicacies and also not spending heaps of money into it. Recommend to all Asian foodies. GO FILL YOURSELF UP!

I visited Pan Asian at ITC Sonar today, the 11th of August. We went there on the basis of your review which highly lauded the food and the price mentioned on your website also seemed very reasonable.

It was mentioned on Zomato that the price was approximately 2000 INR for two people, inclusive of appetizer, main course, side dish and dessert.

However, as a group of 12, we were highly shocked and surprised to find a bill for almost 36,000 INR, 3 times the price we had expected to pay on the basis of your review. This did not even include drinks for everyone as mentioned.

On what basis are you mentioning such rates on your website? It would have been fine if there was a 1000 rupee difference between the rate mentioned and what we paid. However, 3 times the price is a bit too much.

We went on the basis of your recommendation and I am sad to say that we were very disappointed.

Top notch service, in a classy but relaxed ambience is the hall mark of an ITC branded restaurant. Authenticity guaranteed. there are many reviews which cover the food in detail. however, I see many friends complaining about the high prices. 

Well quality is never cheap. Allow me to suggest their set menus. Just had one. Non veg starter, soup, Noodles, rice, main dish (2 and both non veg) with a veg side dish. Desserts, all for Rs.1350 + tax. Great value.

The interactive kitchens feature, Chinese & Thai stir and Wok Fry; here one can sample the Mandarin style eggplant with black mushroom in Hoisin sauce or the Siamese style hot basil chicken with garlic and fresh red chillies or the Red snapper with back pepper, Thai style. This kitchen also features the Shinjiang Roaster credited to China’s Shinjiang province, famed for its bar-be-cue meats prepared in a charcoal fire oven, similar to the Indian tandoor. 

This cooking style spread to other parts of China, over centuries, each province eventually evolving its own signature variation. Chefs Liang and Guo Zheng recreates some of these specialties from their homeland in the Shinjiang Roaster like the Bar-be-cue spare ribs, the crispy chicken Cantonese style or the Gua Tai.

This was my first ever Sunday Brunch at ITC Pan Asia. I took the Champagne + Alcohol buffet, where you have unlimited access to champagne and alcohol listed in the menu.
The buffet started with starters, served to you by the waiters. For starters they had Chicken and fish fries with the sweet puree and prawn in yakotari sauce, and chicken dimpsums. There were varieties of salads; Chicken Salad, Sea food Salad, Vegetable salads, etc. There was a preparation of minced lamb, prawn in spicy thai curry, fish in butter sauce, chow, fried rice. Then comes sushi. This was my first experience of having sushi, and I loved it !! I had few varieties of sushi, the names were not mentioned, but the varieties included Fish Sushi, Chicken Sushi, Crab Sushi and Prawn Sushi. The desserts were mouth-watering! They had Black Forest cake, Dark Chocolate Cake, Chocolate Mousse, Mango Caramelized Custard, Mud Pie and Chocolate Rum ball.
The over all experience was good. But I found it pretty overpriced. Hence I would rate ITC Pan Asian not more than 4. I wish I could give a bit more, like 4.2/4.3, but there is no provision for it.

Location: ITC Sonar Bangla. 

This place is known for the authentic oriental food it serves. 
The ambiance out here is soothing and is top notch. 
It's been quite a few years since I visited this place, had tried the Thai cuisine out here and yes it was the best I have had until now. 
If the wallet check isn't under consideration then this is a place to be. 

The staff interaction was definitely commendable, after all ITC. 

A costly affair it definitely is. 

Had been a great experience. :-)

Had my first taste of Japanese food here with a friend who loved sushi. We ultimately ended up taking the entire meal which offered us hot sake and a chef, Jerry, who cooked for us as and what we wanted through the entire 5 course meal. He kept on helpfully suggesting what to eat and ultimately I had one of the best food experience I had ever had. Seeing what you eat being cooked I from of you was a treat in itself. We had some hibachi grill stuff, tapanyaki and more Japanese stuff which I don't even remember now. It did cost a lot(6k per head) but the experience was worth it

One of the best oriental restaurants in town. The place is really classy with a great ambience. Oriental food is their fortè and they definitely live up to your expectations. I've tried the Thai and Chinese there. 

The spread is really good for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Everything is great from the appetisers, to the dim sums, to the main course. The glass noodles in a soy based sauce(made to order) was especially good as many places tend to over cook the glass noodles and all you get is a mush. 

The live cooking counters are also a really good option, although we haven't tried it. I am also keen on trying the Japanese cuisine out there as I've heard a lot of praise about their Sushi's.

It is a must go at least once.

The Mongolian soups and meats are unique--very  different in flavour and texture.The Shusis are as original as can be and tastw fresh and yummy.The Tofu was out of mind out of sight---who needs prawn and duck after that .....but we did ,and just as well.Everyone tried something different and there was dead silence throughout--except the sound of finger licking !!!
This place is hard to beat.Great ambience ,personalised service--suggest sit at the counter rather than tables.
Needed a gallon of Green tea to help  and wow after a while we were hungry again.

I have been regular here averaging about once in a month since it's inception. Food and service had been an experience until today. I write this now seated there. A baby cockroach popped out on the table to greet us. They took over 20 minutes to serve our soup with 6 chefs working in their open kitchen. Chicken Hot and Sour Soup did not taste it's usual self so they were prompt to replace it. Unfortunately, the second serving was no better. The so called Wasabi Prawns should have been renamed as Wasabi Shrimps that was over fried and the sauce was too dry and very little is quantity than its generous serving. However, the sauce had its trademark slight noseburn feeling which was a relief. Prawn fried rice had a strand of hair and was taken back as we were tired of food being replaced. There were houseflies and some mosquito that also bothered us. My chopstick packet had only 1 chopstick. Anyways, we are not visiting this restaurant again,

This is one of the only Fine Dining Teppanyaki Options in the city.
The food is great but the service lacks the required levels at times.

The ala carte is average.

This place is LEGENDARY. If you dont mind shelling out around Rupees 1500-2000 per person (without alcohol) ,this is THE place to go to.

When I say that this place has the best Thai food I have ever had,I am not exaggerating. I tried the Thai Green Curry and the Orange Curry with steamed rice. Trust me,each and every herb put into the dish could be tasted individually. It is when I ate here,that I realized the difference between an apparently thai dish we get at other places,and the authentic taste which is supposed to be. The individual herbs blend together to form a taste which I must say is orgasmic ! :p 
The crispy broccoli starter was no less. Crisp as a newly printed note,it displayed the experience of the chef,who I must say is extremely talented.
The desserts are well.... desserts. That too ,from a place which knows how to impress its clients. Try any of them,and you'll know why this place is THE place.

The ambience. Well,if you're paying a fortune ,you do expect something extraordinary. And this place will not disappoint you. The stylish centre table,the designer walls,the interiors,all give a very polished feel. It is to be seen to be believed. The crockery is unique and the staff is one of the best I have seen around. 

What an experience. Lavish,exquisite and satisfying. Thats all you need to feel when you're leaving a place.
I cant wait to go back.

Pan Asian along with Chinoiserie in my opinion are the two best oriental restaurants in town. The sushi is very Japanese and the customized Moroccan grill is a must try. The Sunday brunch offers a really wide choice with a huge variety of ingredients to be cooked live in front of you. Cuisine ranges from Vietnamese to Singaporean to Chinese to Japanese. If you are having sushi try and order the sake although availability is an issue occasionally. Overall a very good selection of wines and cocktails with an oriental twist.

The only thing stopping me from giving this place full marks is the pricing. But if money is not an issue an if you're up for a "hat ke" dining experience then this is the place to be. Chefs can prepare food at the live counter in front of you. Would recommend the 7 course meal for special occasions. My favourite dish is the sushi rolls. Also they have a nice collection of wines. Cheers!

Great ambiance. Good service. Japansese food at their Tepeniyaki grill is something you cannot miss. This is probably the only place in Kolkata which provides such a service. The experience of the extravagant 5-course meal is an absolute delight.

When I think of a sunday brunch- THIS is the one place I will always think of. Went on a lazy sunday and had their brunch buffet. The spread was exceptional. The variety of Sushi was vast and there was enough even for a vegetarian like me. The liquor available was really good and the service was flawless. The decor of this place is very interesting with tall walls and high ceiling. I remember the paad thai was mouth watering and one of the best I've had in the city. A must try.

This place is a class act !!! Absolutely fantastic ambience, service and food that is spot on with flavours that linger on for a long time to follow. The options both for vegetarian and non-vegetarians was great and the flavours were equally superb. Their dumplings and dimsums are absolutely fabulous. What was the surprise package for me was the vegetarian sushi which was shockingly tasty ( keeping in mind that I don't like sushi or veg food much). The Thai food especially the Paad Thai we ordered was excellent as well. Don't miss the delicate flavour of their coconut ice-cream for dessert. Looking forward to trying out the Sunday Brunch soon as that comes highly recommended.

Great service & ambience! Food is brilliant. Infact if you take only food into consideration it stands alongside Mainland China. Except that there is huge difference in price! Service is soo good, immense hospitality. Last month I had gone for dinner with my family (dad's treat) & we were given this so called huge jar of which contained all sorts of sweets surrounded with lichees. Amazing experience :D

Very stylish. Great ambiance. Good staff, slow many times. Some concepts are very unique for the city. Tepeniyaki (unsure of the spelling) - live Asian cooking with seatings around. Very delicious with great flavours. I have had Hibachi grills in other countries, but nothing could beat the flavours here. Plus point is it's equally great for the pure veggie types. I would highly recommend their Tepeniyaki option. 
They have great Thai and Mangolian food, too. Also, if you really want to enjoy this restaurant, go for their Sunday brunches (includes unlimited cocktails, beers, champagne, and white spirits). 
I would have given a perfect score, however, in the last 5 visits, their service team has goofed up 3 times. They have been slow at times, forgetful in other times. We expect consistency and precision in the service team from such a restaurant.

I went to Pan Asia few days back for a dinner. The place has good ambiance and comfortable seating. It also has a wine cellar. The food was decent though quantity was less.

Pros- Good ambiance, ideal for a romantic dinner, decent food quality
Cons- Price, service not prompt, waiters too occupied, generated a wrong bill of 8k, which i got corrected to 5k for 2 people.

Utterly PAn Asian in ITC Sonar is my most favourite restaurant out there. The huge waterfall out there is super cool and the restaurant itself is exclusive. Staffs are well-mannered,,,its must cause its ITC after all. Ambiance is something sumptuous. Food quality is mind-blowing and one of the best place where chinese dishes are simply delicious. The momos are too good and other cuisines are superb too. A bar is available there......pricing is really costly cause it belongs to the ITC Sonar.......You will feel womething else when you go in,,something special actually and sitting arrangement is just wow!! The food will just simply melt in your mouth and     the chicken pieces are very soft.There is not much items for vegetarians so sorry for the veggies.I would undoubtedly suggest you to visit there...And, i would rate 4.5 for PAN ASIAN.

One of my favourites...simply love it. In one word it can be described as 'Grand'. You get awesome chinese and the ambience is just wow. The place gives you an awesome feeling and the food just melts in your mouth. No doubt it is very expensive but honestly the place is worth it. Do go there and have a gala time...

Pan Asian.. Located in The ITC Sonar is one of the better chinese, thai and indonesian food joints in town. As soon as you enter the place your are taken back, what an ambiance to sit and dine if you are willing to spend a handsome amount. But you will never regret your visit as the place will surpass all your expectations. The coconut ice cream they serve is TOO good. And do try their Chinese it is very nice but there are very less options for Vegetarians. And, It is pricey, of course!
Three stars from me :)

The best place in town for authentic oriental cuisine. Well it's absolutely fine spending  an enormous amount at this place, simply worth it. Every time I come here , still feel, there is much to cover again. I like the sushi and the Korean over here. Mongolian too is great. Being a Sheraton Plus member , it helps you to visit more and more.

i had an interesting experience. they refused to parcel a portion of my order that was remaining on the serving plate (not on the dinner plate) untouched citing some ridiculous hygiene issues.please note, i was dining a la carte. when i requested for evidence of this rule they couldnt show me anything. also, when i asked the manager why wasn't i informed of this policy before starting my dinner he didnt have an answer. there was absolutely no consideration for the fact that i am paying for a very expensive dish which i have only consumed ~30% and its my choice whether i want the remaining parceled or not. i have eaten across a range of fine dining resturants globally but have never encountered such behaviour. resturants which have this policy are obligated to inform clients beforehand. its a shame that even brands like itc take customer preferences for granted in india. i will never return to this place.

One of the best chinese joints in town. Yes, it is expensive but what else do you expect from a restaurant located in a five star hotel? It has high prices but it also serves high quality food. Everything my family and me have had there has been very good and the flavours are perfectly balanced.People will suggest other restaurants only because they are cheaper!! I have had chinese and other asian cuisines in other restaurants as well, but other than Chinoiserie nothing else comes close to the quality served here. If you can afford then you must try it.

P.S. - Try the duck and the dumplings, they are awesome!!!
