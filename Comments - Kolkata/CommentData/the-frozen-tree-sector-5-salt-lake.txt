Went there just out of curiosity and since it’s a new place they are giving an offer of buy 2 get 1 free so ordered for 2 
The taste was not something Great it’s ok for trying only thing good about their Lollies is that it had real fruits

Another dessert option is added to sector 5 food street menu. This time it's popsicle. We tried watermelon lemongrass one and we loved it. It tasted perfect as fruit pulps is used it. Surely gonna come back and taste the other flavours soon.
