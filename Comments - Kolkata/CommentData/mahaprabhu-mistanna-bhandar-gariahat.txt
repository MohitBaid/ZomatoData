Located near the Singhi Parlk at the corner of Dover Road - one of the oldest sweet shop in the area. Love their chomchom and the sweets dipped in sugar syrup.

Rasmalai and lassis are an absolute bliss here. I love the samosas too. My dad loved the vadas here. We used to come here often while coming back from school as it was located nearby. Decent mishti place in Gariahat area.

Location: Â just at the corner where the famous Singhi park Durga Puja takes place.
I used to eat here a lot during my school days. 

I like their lassi, dahi vada, rasmalai and dosas!

The outlet has been catering to the sweet tooth of many in South Kolkata for more than a decade. The regular mishti was always a good buy- chomchom and the various sandesh varieties. Their experiments with kheer however is worth mentioning. Rolled in aam sotto or mixed with gur, or mango it should be part of your mishti box. While they have done well with their mishti and introduced a wide spread snacks menu consisting of the papdi chats and Rajkachori , I would still recommend their kheer and sandesh mishti varieties. My personal favourite is the sandesh wrapped in aam sotto or aam papad. It's delicious.

The shop is situated near the site of Singhi Park Durga Puja. The sweets they offer are very good if not best. My favourites - jol bhora sandesh, rajbhog. They also make namkeens like samosas during the evening hours. Overall a good experience.

This outlet is one of the oldest of Mahaprabhu Sweets, good ambiance and spacious. Tried their rasomalai, langcha and singara. Poor pricing with average taste...

Once a renowned shop now has very little to talk about. Have tried Rasmalai, Langcha, veg chop and few other sweets on three different occasions.. Langcha turned out to be stale. Rasmalai was like mini rasgulla dipped in sweet milk. Veg chop was okay. Better try Shri Hari sweets in the vicinity, opp to Jhon Miller Showroom.

Mahaprabhu Mistanna Bhandar WAS a typical sweetmeat shop only a few decades ago. Now it is not only a sweet shop, it is a vegetarian snacks centre as well. You can sit here and gorge to your heart's content. There is no parallel of sweets, they are certainly one of their kinds. Of the veg snacks, Chinese and Indian both are available. Also juice and ice cream. I have often taken food from there. Staff ok. A nice place overall, and pocket friendly too.
