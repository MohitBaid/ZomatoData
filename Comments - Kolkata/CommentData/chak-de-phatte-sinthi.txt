visited this place today...nice interior, enough space, serves quality food, in a word, aptly named 'chak de phatte'. we ordered  a mashroom starter, butter and garlic nun along with a side dish of tikka lababdar jabardust. the last one is truly ' jabardust' in taste.   serving bowls are also noteworthy...will love to visit again.

Nice joint to hang out. The cozy first floor with attractive decoration is the show stopper. The location of the joint is alongside with a petrol pump which leaves enough parking space which is quite rare in North Calcutta. The price range is moderate and the staffs are very cordial. The Punjabi authentic joint has quite a lot of variety in starters and main  courses.

This has to be a foodie's paradise!

Pretty nice decor with quirky captions related to Bollywood. Amazing food. Prices won't burn a hole in your pocket. Staff is quite polite and helpful in selection, if you are a first timer and confused what to order. Mr. Dutta, the owner is very courteous towards all the diners. Even one of the starters was on the house! We received discount coupons too. 

Keep Gajar ka Halwa in your must-try list.

Would pay another visit soon, to try their continental cuisine.

The food that we ordered was really tasty. We ordered only Vegetarian food and I can say that the food was worth the price. It was just like home food. Also, the home delivery was fast and the food was warm

Excellent on everything with quality staff and ambience. Delicious and mouth-watering food with almost everything in the menu options to choose from. Want something exclusive ? That can be ordered through Chef's corridor. Ample parking facilities available while you can dine in till 2:00 am. Just fabulous ! If you are around North Calcutta, you wouldn't want to miss out on this one on B.T Road.

Ambience ✅✅✅
Staff Courtesy ✅✅✅✅✅
Food ✅✅✅✅ ( The Gajar ka Halwa was heaven and was on the House 😛)
Servicing ✅✅✅ ( Needs an improvement)  
We were 8 peoples and we ordered 
1. Paneer Chaddar pe Chaddar ( A New and Innovative dish.) 
2. Non Veg Platter ( We expected much still it was great 🙂🙂)
3. Masala Kulcha / Naan
4. Kadai Paneer 
5. Dal Makhani 
6. Chicken Shahi Korma ( It was Great) 🙂🙂.
The bill was around  rs. 2010 for 8 people which is good.. 
I'll recommend this place for hangouts and parties.

Food first. We went for lunch and ordered garlic naan, butter naan, chicken bharta and chicken shahi korma. Food was good, not too oily, not too spicy, served warm, tasted well. I am a little dissatisfied by the quantity, though, especially about the side dishes within the given price range.
Service, not too bad. Waiters are neither overtly friendly nor insolent, so I guess that's okay. However, the food could have been served a little faster; I think I noticed just one cook in an almost deserted restaurant.
Lastly, ambiance. The insides are well decorated, seats comfortable, light and space adequate. They also have an area upstairs where private parties and 'get-together's can be organised. However, it's location being inside a petrol pump, it is not very appealing since people do not want to wait at petrol pumps, I guess? 
Overall, it's not bad. One little glitch that occurred was that when the bill came, the printed price of each of the side dishes was Rs. 10 extra than that mentioned on the menu card. On inquiring, we were told that the higher price was provided by the system and they couldn't do anything about it.
