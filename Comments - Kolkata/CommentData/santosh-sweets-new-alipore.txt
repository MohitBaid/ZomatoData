Very average shop, but mostly stale sweets, brought sweets for family out of compulsion, found out they were stale and bad. Requested them to return after finding out, they were not ok with it. My suggestion avoid.

A very average Bengali usual sweet shop located just opposite to the Hindustan Sweets outlet at Alipur. They have a decent variety in sweets offerings and the authentic Bengali taste is distinctively prominent from their items. Go for the usual sweet options they are decent enough for a sufficing sweet cravings.

as it is just opposite to hindustan sweets , mostly i do not prefer to enter here because of the dominance of the former . but its good that it still has its existance in presence of hindustan sweets. may be the only reason is the price which is cheaper that that of the former . the quality is good .

Situated just opposite the Hindustan Sweets, this place is another destination for good sweets, paneer, samosas and Radhaballavis in New Alipur. 

Quality of sweets is very good. A thumbs up and definitely worth visiting this place.

Have been visiting this outlet since I was in kindergarten. It is located just opposite to "Hindustan sweets" of new alipore. This sweet shop is quite spacious in size and offers a decent variety of sweets and other snacks. Though it doesn't have that much of hype and popularity among the masses like its direct competitor "Hindustan sweets" does but it has earned an unique place in he heart of its visitors. Their offerings mostly comprises of traditional Bengali sweets like- chamcham, malai chop, gopal bhog, kalakaand, ata sandesh, khirkadam, kaju barfi, lyangcha, pantua, chanar jalebi, gulabjamun, talsash, sankha sandesh, kachagolla, rasgulla, rajbhog, kusum sandesh, gulab Patti, chocolate sandesh, Misti doi(sweet yogurt), rabri, rasmalai etc; each and every variety offered by them are intact with unaltered quality and carries its authentic flavors. The one of the biggest plus point about this sweet shop is the prices listed of their products, I can undoubtedly say they offer one of the best sweets in cheapest prices as compared to other outlets in new alipore and its nearby vicinity. You can still get "gujiyas" at Rs1 each in this place( any item available at 1 bucks in this era is surprising itself), a variety of mouth watering sandfish and other sweets are still available over here within the price range of 5-7 bucks each. Speciality sweets like "jalbhora talsash", "gur kalash", "choco chamcham" etc; are priced at 10bucks. Even though the prices are marked more than reasonably over here but the quality of their offerings are completely uncompromised. Their savories like radhaballavi, kachori, samosa, nimki etc; are damn succumbing and the prices are as usual cheap as anything; a piece of kachori and samosas are marked at 5 bucks each. Above all that, the every friendly behavior of the owners standing over the counter, always makes your visit satisfying and homely. Overall "Santosh Sweets" will always be regarded as a shop which without getting involved into any kind of fuss and all, is continuously offering variety of quality sweets and savories considering the common people and middle class sections of the society.
