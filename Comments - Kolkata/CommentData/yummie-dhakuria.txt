I had egg chowmein and chicken Manchurian! It was average in taste. Quantity was enough for one person! Chicken pieces were quite good. Could have been better.

Literally next my house. Food is average. Hope they will improve the taste a bit otherwise it's a good value for money.
Will order soon again.
