The luxury chocolate boutique has amped up the dessert scene of Kolkata altogether. I had tried the signature Black Forest Revisited which is a 64% dark chocolate with a hint of sour cherry confit balanced with elegant Madagascar vanilla bean crême. The glazed beauty melts in the mouth and touches the soul. The sour cherry on the top balances the bitterness as well as the sweetness of vanilla wonderfully. 
The other was a 84% signature dark chocolate petit cake with fleur de sel. 
The dessert looks heavenly and the creamy texture that you get to explore when you dig in is to die for. This is one of the best that I’ve tried. It has a hint of bitterness though but those who are fond of dark chocolate wouldn’t be a problem at all. If you’re a milk chocolate fan this might not be a wise choice. But I personally am a cocoa loyalist so that’s a bonus for me.

I have been a Fabelle aficionado ever since it opened in Calcutta. It’s our version of Godiva or a Pierre Hermé. Zomato can track the amount of restaurants I’ve been to but I rarely write any feedback because it’s such a personal experience. I have always experienced amazing service and some of their old staff recognise me too. Today, I wanted to pick up reasonable boxes of 5 pieces each of their Elements chocolates to gift to bank staff for Diwali and predictably the sales woman’s expression changed as soon as she realised I wasn’t going to make a big bill today. Even before checking the stock she said I don’t think we have a box of 5. I asked her to check with the kitchen and she very half heartedly “dialled” a number and within 10 seconds confirmed that the boxes of 5 weren’t available. She pushed me to go for the box of 10 or the Gianduja but I had a fixed budget and I settled on the As You Like It cups which even before I could open my mouth to say that I wanted to customise it on the iPad she said the chef can prepare the chef special of all the flavours. I did not want to waste my time on arguing so I told her please keep the 3 boxes ready I’ll take a round of the hotel and come back to collect it. Her face lost all colour as if she’d seen a ghost because she insisted I pay first as if I was going to run away with the boxes without paying for them. I have never been asked to pay beforehand at a 5 star hotel before.  I paid using my card but wasn’t given a bill but the hotel can check the time stamp for INR 1500 at 3:21 pm. I came back from my stroll and was informed by another staff member that I would have to wait for half an hour. After some time had passed, a male colleague of theirs, came out with my boxes in a Nutmeg bag which is their pastry shop’s bag. When I asked if all customers were given Fabelle chocolates in Nutmeg’s packets, his female colleague said that the Fabelle packets were out of stock. After I got into my car I checked the boxes and they were wet. I get that gourmet chocolate is temperature controlled but it’s basic courtesy to wipe it down before handing it. Then I opened the box to see chocolate shavings on the sides of the cups as if someone had just not bothered to make the box presentable. I was in a rush and did not take a picture. I cleaned the sides with tissue paper and wiped the boxes before driving off to the bank. So whether ITC believes this incident or not, I would like to state in simple terms that I’m not a Kangana Ranaut or that TCS female from Delhi who ruined Mocambo’s reputation desperate in need for attention. I love ITC food especially Peshawari and Fabelle and I’m the last person to complain . I used to have the annual membership for years before i stopped renewing it because more hotels cropped up and I prefer Marriott Novotel and Westin anyway. 
I would have given 5 stars because the boutique is that good. But the hospitality is negligible hence the 4 stars.

The Chocolates that you find here are sinnfully tempting and I  literally slipped into a foodcoma or rather Chocolatecoma. There are different chocolates , based on the cocoa content and as I love the chocolate with high density of cocoa, I loved the one called Ghana.
The Ganache are out of the world, totally melt in your mouth chocolate cubes.
Chocolates as you know can be the best gifts. I fell in love with" Elements", these are pralines inspired by the five natural elements.
This Diwali they have introduced Diwali hampers, which can be available in different varieties of Hampers.. There are six different bouquets to choose from, namely 
Elegant , Grande, Royale, Prisma, Signature, Regalia
Price Range : ₹2400-₹25,100

What is adventersome, shy, dark, sultry and beautiful when it is placed on your palate? Don't stress your minds which would have already surrendered to the sinful taste and aroma of the choicest cocos by now. Imported from the exotic locations of Italy, Equador, Ghana are some of the finest chocolates handcrafted to perfection and made available to you at the Fabelle Exquisite Chocolates boutique at the ITC Hotels. With Diwali knocking at your doorstep what better way to share some love with your loved ones than gifting them a box of 'Fabelle'. These gift hampers are made available in a variety of 6 different bouquets to choose from. Starting from the Elegant, Grande, Royale, Prisma, Signature it finally goes up to Regalia. Yes you will be spoit for choice once you visit the fabelle boutique. My personal recommendation would have to be the Elements which are pralines inspired from the mystical elements of Nature. Simply put, it is a Paradise for all you chocolate lovers and incase you can't control your cravings just pay them a visit before Diwali for a memorable experience. After all as the proverb goes "Sabar the fal humesha meetha hota hai " I would rather put it as Sabar ka fal humesha fabelle hota hai".

Wish you all a Happy and Safe Diwali in advance !!!!

It was an amazing experience. We ordered the Ghana milk chocolate mousse with caramel and banana créme,Black forest revisited, Vanilla cremeux bar with Saint-domingue chocolate mousse, Eclair Venezuela, white chocolate cheesecake jars, s'mores milk and the 84% signature dark chocolate Petit cake with fleur de sel. 
The dark chocolate desserts have the perfect balance so I liked it.  Amazing services too.

After dinner I planned to goto Fabelle for a cup of hot chocolate, I tried spiced hot chocolate and it was amazing though it can be shared as the cup is huge. I also bought box of elements chocolates , the chocolates are also very amazing. I highly recommend to all the chocolates lovers .

This place was in my wishlist ever since the place had opened its doors to public a year ago. So before leaving Kolkata in August, I made it a point that I have to visit Fabelle! So did I! 
Since the very beginning of the visit, everything will catch your eye. But what will pain you most is the super chilly temperature inside the chocolate boutique. The management can't help it because to preserve such exquisite cacao beans, such low temperatures are necessary. Do not complain. Think about the staffs who have to stay in that temperature all throughout the day and they keep on serving you with a constant warm smile on their face. That's something you should bare a few minutes for! 
We were being attended by Nupur. Her hospitality is something that must be mentioned. She was very warm and on knowing that we are feeling cold, she made arrangements for us to sit outside in the lawns of ITC Sonar. Loved her hospitality. 
We had taken quite a few things - 
S'mores Chocolate Milk - I am a diehard fan of s'mores and milk chocolate. When the two magical things combine, heaven is created on earth. This was a fantabulous milk chocolate drink I have had in a while.
Black Forest Revisited - Last year, when all my blogger friends were posting pictures of this beauty, since then they ignited the craving of gorging on this lovely piece within me. And how could I just not have it? Lovely, beautiful, ethereal - these are the words that describe this magnificent dessert perfectly. The sour cherry confit took all my attention and while writing about this after a month later, I feel all nostalgic again! 
As You Like It - These are customised milk chocolate cups that Fabelle has in store for you. You can choose a cup, a filling and a topping and be a master chocolatier for yourself. We had taken a milk chocolate cup with white créme filling and cacao nibs as topping. It tasted brilliant. We got some of these packed for home as well! 
Experience at Fabelle was like a dream. I am definitely going to come back here again and again, whenever I get the chance to visit Kolkata. Pocket pinchwise, it's definitely on a much higher side. Look at the brand! It's ITC after all. I would say, refrain from splurging for a while, save some and spend it here. I promise you won't regret. That's what we did! Loved the whole experience here at Fabelle! Recommended to visit. Happy Dining! :)

Fabelle has come up with some of the finest luxury chocolates in the city. Exquisite and lip-smacking in taste, Fabelle's offerings are a visual as well as gourmet treats. A beautifully decked chocolate boutique, it even has comfy seats for guests to lounge and enjoy their coffee over conversations.
Recently tried their customisable milk chocolate and single chocolate cup creations in a box of six different srumptous flavours, and they turned out rich, creamy, chocolatey, and luxuriously melt-in-the-mouth fantastic.
For totally state-of-the-art luxury chef's creations of exclusive chocolates, Fabelle at ITC Sonar is a must visit.

Visited this chocolate boutique yesterday, the ambience is nice and the service is good and quick.
So  i tried the 84% signature chocolate petit cake and warm chocolate tian.
The 84% signature chocolate cake is made of pure dark chocolate and has a bitter taste, which tastes good but the taste is very constant which is the bad part.
The warm chocolate tian on the other has a sour taste because of the lime chocolate drizzle and is served hazlenut icecream.

What a gem of a place this is! It's a paradise for all chocolate lovers!
Being a chocoholic this place had always been on my list and I decided to visit this wonderful place on my Birthday!

We ordered chocolate flower, smores chocolate milk, melting moments and a box containing assortment of 10 pralines. When visiting this place you must order chocolate flower, it's a piece of art and these guys are the Picasso of it! Smores drink had a couple of marshmallows in it and was served with a couple of chocolate cookies, which tasted absolutely yum!
Melting moments was again a fantastic creation by these guys and the box containg assortment of 10 pralines deserves special mention too! The box contains 5×2 different kinds of chocolates namely air, water, wood, fire and earth!

Miss. Sutradhar looked after us very well, no negative marks for the service.
Definitely visiting this place again in the near future!

AMAZING is the word for this dessert heaven.. Me n my hubby were @ITC Sonar for 2 days and i saw this place which was very attarctive n delicious looking.. U can actually see their chocolate art making.. Being a dessert lover myself i cudnt control myself and ordered 3 wonderful masterpiece which was delicious to the core....

1. Ghana Milk Chocolate Mosse with Caramel and Banana Créme:- tasty... Mild chocolate with banana creme was soo nice.. Flavour of banana was not overpowering.. U can taste caramel-chocolate-banana all of it.. Thats really perfection.

2. White Chocolate Cheesecake Jars:- looked soo PERFECT... The chocolate disc on the top was super thin, and cracking that with a spoon was fun... It had a perfect snap sound.. Cheesecake was super silky smooth and little drops of fruits were really adding to the flavour.. Cheese had zest of orange nd lime which was so mild n not tangy.. And the cake base was not regular biscuity, but it had a bit texture to it, nuts made it more fun to eat with creamy cheese..

3. 84% Signature Dark Chocolate Petit Cake with Fleur de sel:- WOW... it looked soo delicious.. Taste was divine.. Pure chocolate and nothing else.. So if u r a hardcore chocolate lover u must try this... And if not, then u better stay away from it coz its pretty strong and a little bitter, and thats how real chocolate tastes.. I loved it..

Ladies and gentlemen, I am happy to announce that we now finally have "Made in India" chocolates which can hold its own against the well known luxury chocolate brands from the west. A labour of love of ITC top brass, it took ten long years of trial and error to perfect this brand. Now the fruits of that labour can be savoured at the newly opened chocolate boutique inside ITC Sonar. Whether it is the imaginatively named and designed pralines filled with exotic ingredients or the melt in the mouth creamy ganache, the varieties that I tried all tasted excellent and there are a lot more left to try. They have dark chocolate bars made from single origin beans sourced from various countries as well as some fabulous looking chocolate desserts which can be best enjoyed sitting in the shop itself. Hope to be back there soon.

Very nice ambience. The chocolate tart dessert was very tasty.. the presentation was amazing.. the madagaskar frappe was not at all to my liking.. while taking the order, we were not explained that it contains coconut sorbet.. we left the entire glass as it is.. expected a lil better hospitality from ITC, however the lady incharge was very polite.. so no complaints as such but par above excellence feeling was missing which I usually get at dum pukht as coz the frappe was a complete disappointment.. just to highlight that it was not to my liking. As the coffee and coconut flavour didn't go well with me.. i am not saying that it was a bad drink in general..if the attendant could explain the dish or drink a lil more in details then if would have been much better and would have ordered something else.. overall a nice experience

The "Lotus flower" chocolate by Chef Rangoli was delicious and equally good looking dessert...The latest visit to Fabelle was on the occasion of my 1st wedding anniversary... Thanks to Mr. Rahul Mishra for being sooo helpful and cooperative.. A truly humble and great guy..!!! Kudos to the Fabelle team for the unique experience....

This is by far the best gourmet chocolate store in Kolkata. I was seduced by the look of it when I was sitting in the Eden Pavilion for a lunch. I gave it a try for desserts and I was not even a bit disappointed. Since then I have come here 2,3 times. My favorites are Sao Tome and Madagascar from their single origin Cacaos section. They taste truly brilliant. I am not a fan of milk chocolates and pralines, so didn't  taste them. If you are here you need to taste one of their personalised  chocolate cups. They have finally brought in the luxury of proper smooth melting gourmet chocolates to the city.

They were great!!!

They have dark chocolate bars made from single origin beans sourced from various countries as well as some fabulous looking chocolate desserts which can be best enjoyed sitting in the shop itself. Hope to be back there soon.

Very nice ambience. The chocolate tart dessert was very tasty.. the presentation was amazing.. the madagaskar frappe was not at all to my liking.. while taking the order, we were not explained that it contains coconut sorbet.. we left the entire glass as it is.. expected a lil better hospitality from ITC, however the lady incharge was very polite.. so no complaints as such but par above excellence feeling was missing which I usually get at dum pukht as coz the frappe was a complete disappointment.. just to highlight that it was not to my liking. As the coffee and coconut flavour didn't go well with me.. i am not saying that it was a bad drink in general..if the attendant could explain the dish or drink a lil more in details then if would have been much better and would have ordered something else.. overall a nice experience

A one of a kind chocolate boutique.... I am in love with " Ganache " ... A frequent visitor to this place coz of the irresistable chocolates and Minty Dark As you like it Cups.... The "Lotus flower" chocolate by Chef Rangoli was delicious and equally good looking dessert...The latest visit to Fabelle was on the occasion of my 1st wedding anniversary... Thanks to Mr. Rahul Mishra for being sooo helpful and cooperative.. A truly humble and great guy..!!! Kudos to the Fabelle team for the unique experience....

This is by far the best gourmet chocolate store in Kolkata. I was seduced by the look of it when I was sitting in the Eden Pavilion for a lunch. I gave it a try for desserts and I was not even a bit disappointed. Since then I have come here 2,3 times. My favorites are Sao Tome and Madagascar from their single origin Cacaos section. They taste truly brilliant. I am not a fan of milk chocolates and pralines, so didn't  taste them. If you are here you need to taste one of their personalised  chocolate cups. They have finally brought in the luxury of proper smooth melting gourmet chocolates to the city.

They were great!!!

Ended up going here on Valentine's Day and was to some extent disappointed by the poor management. Despite a confirmed table booking, I had to wait for almost 30 minutes to get a table. However having said that, I loved the fact that the chefs come down to your table to interact with you and brief you about their specialities. We ordered two desserts both of which were really tasty though it was so chocolaty that one couldn't finish the entire thing! 

The desserts look way too good and there is top notch presentation skills although the variety could be slightly worked upon!

What an amazing 5 star experience... - chocolates in luxury at its best. ITC Sonar finally launched their own brand of chocolates in Kolkata last year July'2016. The ambience and decor added the chocolaty theme touch to every corner of the boutique. Tried the black forest chocolate - the layers simply melted in my mouth. In one word just outstanding... Would recommend chocolate lovers to visit this boutique.

Extremely great place for chocolate lovers The rating would have been 5/5 but the overall process subtracted the 2.5 points. In today's busy world we cannot afford to call and wait for 3-4 hours just to place the order. A online placement order page/app would have been great to take the experience to the next level.

Chocolate - great
Service - eh

I normally like Fabelle, having first tasted it in Bangalore. I was so excited that ITC Sonar had it as well. Food-wise, the place is fantastic. Chocolate melts in your hands, literally. But they don't have any samples at this place, seriously? How can you be a chocolate place and not offer samples? It's not like I don't buy chocolates, my credit card can prove how frequently I visit. So even if the chocolate would make you feel sweet and happy, the service would for sure leave you bitter and mad.

All their focus is on branding and visual appeal. Had they spent equal amount of time on quality of ingredients and preparation, this place would not have been such a let down. 
Of course, its going to burn a hole in your pocket, but that would have been okay if the place was worth it. FABELLE definitely is not worth it.

If you were in search of authenticity for gourmet chocolates, best in class and from all over the 
world, Fabelle is ITC Sonar's first of its kind launch and an answer for the Conossuier.

You can enjoy chocolates and unwind with a cup of coffee which you shall never find anywhere in the city. 

Surprise is all over, cocoa from Ghana in Africa to the South American blend, you name it and they have it.

With Soma Chattoraj as Executive Head Chef,Sagarika Choudhary, Nupur,Priya,Suprabhat and Rangoli are all there to add to an exciting rendezvous.

Visited this place after dinner on a weekday for desserts.
Had the 84% signature dark chocolate petit cake and the classic hot cocoa . Sadly , both of these were much below our expectations. The classic hot cocoa was not anywhere near a good hot cocoa . Lacking the goodness of a perfect hot chocolate .
Plus the dark chocolate cake was hard and not giving the flavours of dark chocolate perfectly. 
I was disappointed with Fabelle during this visit.  
The staff seemed to be confused and did not have an idea about what they were serving . And they couldn't get the order perfected despite of complain . Fabelle should try perfecting its desserts and live up to its name.

Caution: If you're fond of chocolates and are trying to watch your weight do not step into this place. :D I thought I had my daily calorie count in control till I got here and I don't regret it one bit.

It's a small little alcove inside the ITC Sonar, looks as opulent as the rest of the place. No surprises here!

These are the things I ate and a small review of each.
1. The vanilla cremeux bar: The chocolate is somewhat dark, the vanilla flavor is mild and delicate and the overall feel is rich and smooth. 4/5

2. The chocolate flower: A delight to watch. That's what stood out even more than the taste. There are little bits of fruit in this one so if you're not one for fruity flavors this may not be your thing. 4.5/5

3. The Ghana chocolate mousse. This one gave me an instant foodgasm. Actually multiple foodgasms :) since I couldn't stop at one and ordered another on the spot. The banana, caramel and the extra smooth milk chocolate left me begging for more(the theatrics are really worth it for this one :D) 50000/5

It's a tad bit pricy but well worth it. Throw caution to the wind, vow to run an extra 5k on the treadmill tomorrow and go visit this place. :)

For a chocolate boutique, that's the first of its kind in Kolkata , it takes an enormous amount of energy, a good palate and extremely lovely flavours to bring out the best from only one ingredient- chocolate. What I received as a Diwali gift was a box of chocolates representing the different elements there are- earth, air, fire , water and wood. 
The chocolate that represented earth was covered in chocolate rocks with cocoa dust and revealed a dark chocolate mousse inside. The mousse was rich and smooth , while the outer cover of the chocolate rocks was hard like candy and was sweet. It perfectly symbolised earth or rocks, which make up the earth. 
The personification of air was done by an elongated chocolate which had a dark chocolate outer shell with a lighter-than-air mousse of milk chocolate inside. It was very delectable. 
The third chocolate represented water. And I have to say it's the most unique chocolate I have ever had. The shape of the chocolate was like that of a whirlpool, giving the indication that it is going to create a storm of flavours in your mouth. There was definitive liquid inside, which I later realised was acacia nectar, something I have never tasted before in my life. It's a thick colourless liquid with an unusual sweet taste , which also cuts down your throat as you have it. It had salt in it too. This one was my favourite. 
The wood chocolate looked like a piece of bark and boasted of cinnamon and coffee- the perfect combination inside with a dark chocolate covering. 
The last and final one represented fire and was the prettiest to look at. There was , in the middle, candied mango with ancho chilli sprinkled on top of it showcasing the colours of fire. Inside was a white chocolate mousse. Like fire, it did add a fiery taste to chocolate and created confusion in the mouth -in a good way though. 
Fabelle has completely renewed or rather, heightened the chocolate tasting experience. As they use superior quality ingredients and are a part of a big hotel, the chocolates come at an elevated price. But the chocolates are worth trying out here.

For the first time I had a visit at a chocolate parlour in Kolkata and the experience was magnificent. I am a fan of dark chocolates so ordered chocolate flower and 85% dark chocolate brulee . The flower was a chocolate mousse with raspberry confit in the middle . The best part was the artistry of the opening of the flower. The brulee was very good too . They blowtorched the upper layer and it formed a thin crust which went pretty nice with the wine soaked berries .

Luxury Chocolates at its best! ITC chain where they offer fine chocolates and a dessert bar.
The menu is quite vast and you'd probably get confused as what to order but their service is pretty good and they help you select according to your preference.

-Ghana Chocolate Mousse : really good. 

-Vanilla Cremeux : the best I had there. The Vanilla subtly cut the heaviness of the chocolate and the glaze was amazing.

Can't wait to be back there

Amazing for those chocolate lovers, who suddenly get weird chocolate cravings and don't mind experimenting. We tired the chocolate machiato cup and the chocolate flower. Flower literally unfolds at your table when u pour hot milk, and it gets you all excited. However the machiato cup taste better, it was totally out of the world. Amazing, how they can manage to have so many flavours at one time in such a small piece. But, the best thing about this place is the service. Especially the girl who is in charge. Unfortunately, I don't remember her name, but she was just so great. She described each concoction with so much passion, it made us wanna try out everything. A big big thumbs up!!

To a chocolate lover this would be the waiting room before heaven. I only wish their beverage selection had more non-chocolate varieties to offset the sweetness of their offerings - espresso and individual french-press coffees would go well with their menu.

If you are a regular reader of my blog, follow me on social media and see the pictures that I post, you will know how much I love chocolate. After I started writing about food, I’ve become more open towards experimenting with other flavors but there was a time when I would not even touch an ice cream or dessert if it did not have chocolate in it. One thing that I’ve always wanted in my city is a place where I can go and get good quality luxury chocolates, the kind of stuff that you get abroad. It took a long time to come but finally my wish has been granted. After a successful launch in Bengaluru at ITC Gardenia, ITC has introduced Kolkata to an inimitable chocolate experience with the launch of Fabelle Chocolates at an exclusive Fabelle Chocolate Boutique at ITC Sonar, Kolkata.

Fabelle has brought in the first ever luxury chocolate boutiques in the City of Joy, and the best part is not the handcrafted chocolates, but the surprisingly affordable prices. The varieties broadly include "The Elements", "The Ganache" and the Customisable Chocolate cups beside their wide choices of desserts. The Elements are interesting with each of them containing ingredients that are absolutely unconventional. The "Fire" element contains "Ancho Chilly" that gives the chocolate a spicy tinge without compromising on the flavor. My favorite has to be the Dark Chocolate Ganache which is a melt-in-the-mouth experience and is sure to take you to heaven.

They have one of the best chocolates of Calcutta.I had taken a box of assorted chocolates for my father and they were very kind to let me taste their ganache while I waited for my order. And it was to die for. It just melts in your mouth. I couldn't stop closing my eyes. The dark chocolate is not bitter at all and in fact I liked the dark one more than the milk chocolate. 

Okay now about what I took along , was a box of assorted chocolates which was crazy. They were 12 pieces of heaven. We enjoyed each and every piece to the core. 
I am definitely coming back very soon. It's a must try for all the chocolate lovers. 😀

You don't just taste chocolates but you feel them. Chocolates are more than just everyone's favourite. It's something which helps you express every bit of your emotion and I am glad ITC came up with this venture of Fabelle. The efforts of the team behind it have paid off as they have come up with some of the best chocolates Indians can be proud of. They have finally carved a niche for themselves in the exclusive luxury chocolates chain. The chocolates just don't sound and cost luxury but provide you a luxury of its own when you put those pieces in your mouth and relish them. The experience is one of a kind and I would recommend all of you,all those eagerly waiting for a review of this place, to come here for an exclusive experience. The box of assortment pralines look luxury as much as they taste luxury. Fabelle not only gives you a food experience but something which you are going to remember and talk about for a very,very long time.

And Fabelle – the ultimate luxury chocolate brand from ITC is aimed at bringing just that. Chocolates are warm and comforting, and that can never change. But it becomes even better when doused in generous amounts of luscious luxury! On a Sunday evening, when I was invited to the Chocolate Boutique at ITC Sonar, I thought oh, okay so I will be eating a lot of chocolates. But what I actually experienced was much more than just that.

As we glided through Boxed Chocolates, Chocolate Desserts, and Cocoa Beverages, the latter two created live at the Fabelle Chocolate Boutique by Master Chocolatiers, we were transported to a  different world altogether.

Before I write this review I must state that I'm not a. huge dessert or a huge chocolate  person,  but yes I do like hand crafted chocolates and am pretty off mass produced bars.  

First,  thank God someone opened a boutique  for good chocolate  in the city,  high time.  Didn't taste too much but the elements  box is to die for. 


The elements selection  come in five different  flavors... Wind,  water,  wood,  fire,  earth 
My picks (top to bottom) 
1. Fire 
Perfectly  tempered choc encases a warm mango and Ancho chillies.  The tickle in the throat is really spectacular.  Totally loved it.  Top pic with respect to flavor layering 
2. Wood. 
Riot of textures.  And the cinnamon and coffee notes are perfect for someone like me who does not like dessert too much.  I feel the crunch in this one stole the show 
3. Water. 
Mass pleaser, the acacia nectar contrasting with French sea salt is a combination  that will win your heart.  The bite releases the inner filling and it just transports you to bliss. 

I do recommend  the ganache chocolate  too,  surprisingly I liked the milk ganache much more than the dark one as the contrast of the silky ganache to the bitter cocoa was lovely..  

Can't wait to go again a d have some more...  

Kudos!!!

First,  thank God someone opened a boutique  for good chocolate  in the city,  high time.  Didn't taste too much but the elements  box is to die for. 


The elements selection  come in five different  flavors... Wind,  water,  wood,  fire,  earth 
My picks (top to bottom) 
1. Fire 
Perfectly  tempered choc encases a warm mango and Ancho chillies.  The tickle in the throat is really spectacular.  Totally loved it.  Top pic with respect to flavor layering 
2. Wood. 
Riot of textures.  And the cinnamon and coffee notes are perfect for someone like me who does not like dessert too much.  I feel the crunch in this one stole the show 
3. Water. 
Mass pleaser, the acacia nectar contrasting with French sea salt is a combination  that will win your heart.  The bite releases the inner filling and it just transports you to bliss. 

I do recommend  the ganache chocolate  too,  surprisingly I liked the milk ganache much more than the dark one as the contrast of the silky ganache to the bitter cocoa was lovely..  

Can't wait to go again a d have some more...  

Kudos!!!

After being recommended by selective few, went to try the served deserts and chocolate, and came to understand why its so impressive and addictive,, even though did not get a chance to try most of things by i surely have developed fondness for the 'minty dark' being served there. This place has created its attention among the chocolate lovers of kolkata.. And leaves you with a craving for more.... Well cant say about others but i surely would make frequent visits there.... Well pocket pinches but greatness doesn't come cheap.

If you love chocolate as much as I do then trust me Fabelle will become your little bit of heaven in Kolkata. A lot of people like chocolate but for me chocolate is not just something I eat and enjoy but something I feel. Good chocolate speaks to me and it has been a true friend, cheered me up when I am down , celebrated happy moments and successes , helped me express my emotions of love, friendship , gratitude or apology to people I care about. We don’t really realize how much a part of our lives chocolate has become but we use it as a bribe, a peace offering or just because we feel like having some.

I am quite sure you would understand my blissful glee when ITC Sonar and Calcutta Instagrammers were kind enough to invite me for the #KolkataWelcomesFabelle launch at the beautiful ITC Sonar. The excitement of all the invitees was palpable (like I said most people love Chocolate) and we were taken through an exciting and informative presentation by Team Fabelle. 

They shared with us that this brand has been lovingly conceptualized and worked on for ten long years before they felt that they had met the exacting standards their mandate demanded. Fabelle offers us a range of exquisite chocolate creations such as Elements - intricately crafted pralines inspired by the elements of nature, Ganache - velvety soft cubes of exotic cocoas delicately churned with butter & fresh cream and As You Like It – personalized chocolate cup creations offering myriad possibilities of fillings and toppings. In addition, the Chocolate Boutiques will provide a range of exquisitely crafted Fabelle desserts and cocoa beverages, created live by the Fabelle Master Chocolatiers. 

We were then divided into two groups and taken in turns to the tastefully elegant Fabelle Boutique located just opposite the Coffee Shop in the Hotel. The understated opulence perfectly matched what their stunning Chocolates represent.

I have to confess I was in chocolate heaven…. all around me like prized jewels were stunningly displayed chocolates. I could not wait to get my hands on these little beauties and I think Chef Ruby one of their highly trained and expert Chocolatiers realized my plight and the tastings began. We started with the Ganache (Creamy Milk and Rich Dark) and they were exquisite …. so beautifully made that all I needed to do was pop it in my mouth and it just melted into this decadent, fantastically flavored chocolate puddle and left me stunned. I simply could not believe that I was eating Chocolate that was made in India.

 After a while of savoring the Ganache and taking some pictures I went ahead and tried a sample from their Faballe Element collection. These are inspired by the five elements Earth, Air, Water, Wood and Fire. I choose Water because I loved the sound of it …..  Dark Chocolate Mousse dripping with Acacia Nectar and French Sea Salt in a Dark Chocolate Shell. Just writing about it makes me want to go back for more, fantastic balance of flavors and loved the synchronization of flavors of the Acacia Nectar and French Sea Salt. An absolute winner it was and I will go back soon and try all the other Elements. 

A few bloggers volunteered to try their hand at the As You Like It collection where they stepped into the open-kitchen section of the Chocolate Boutique and created their own chocolates using various combinations of fillings and toppings. It was great fun and it sure brings out the kid in all of us. Then came the Fabelleogram which was a software that measured our brainwaves after we had tasted these stunning chocolates. I was the first to volunteer and I was set up in front of the computer with some kind of device fitted on my head and made my very own Fabellogram. It was a unique experience and they gave us a framed copy as a memento of our very first Fabelle experience.

But wait there is more we were escorted back and the Master Chocolatiers displayed some fantastic and I mean out of this world Desserts and Beverages for us to sample. They looked divine and tasted heavenly and I know when I want to make a gloomy day brighter or celebrate something special this is where I will be heading. We had a Dark Chocolate Petite Cake with Fleur de Sel and that was gorgeous and the one I liked best but others like Black Forest Revisited were no less delicious and will be available at the Boutique. They also made us try a few beverages both hot and cold which I did not sample as I was too full but will certainly go back for as soon as possible. 

Fabelle is undoubtedly and unhesitatingly the best chocolate available in the country and is a head and shoulders above anything else in the market at present. Its absolutely international class and that truly excites me. It made me feel very proud that we now have a home grown brand that can stand tall beside all the international giants.

India’s first Luxury Chocolate Boutique took a long time coming, but when it finally arrived, it did so in a Grand Fashion, with oodles of pomp & panache!. It most certainly isn’t easy to make the Country’s best chocolates. These handcrafted delicacies have taken decades of research and trials, are made using 7 of the most exotic cocoas produced in Africa and Latin America with 26 ingredients.@
