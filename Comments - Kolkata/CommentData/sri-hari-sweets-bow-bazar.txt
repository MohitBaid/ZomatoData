Pretty good sweets available here. The Laddoos were my pick from this shop, they were really great. Even tried their rosogolla, didn't impress me much, it was pretty average. The service was pretty good all round, keep up the good work.

I used to be a regular customer of this store. Everytime i passed from here I used to buy atleast one or two sweets. The Lencha and laddu used to be my favorite.
One of the best place here in Bowbazar at affordable rate selling a variety of sweets. You will get almost everything here sweets, tok doi and they sell good quality panner too.

Whenever I pass by the area , I always buy misti items from this shop. Affordable price , good quality. Today I went for Misti Doi , Tok Doi , Rosogolla and Cake Sandesh , each and every item was very good in taste.
