This eatery is situated near Pallysree auto stand. I have ordered from here quite a few times. The egg roll is very nice and less oily unlike those in other places. The covering is quite crispy. Their chicken steam momo@â‚¹60 is a must try. The pieces are huge, 6 in number. They provide a soup with it which is quite fine too. It's more than enough for 1 person. Yet to try the other dishes. Will give the full review soon.

Don't judge this place by its outlook. The food is yummy and also at a reasonable cost. One can also choose from a variety of options. Definitely serves the purpose of street food.

Great place, Lovely food, recommended: garlic chicken, chicken/mutton rolls, fried rice, a good appetite and a happy mood!! Location is good. Road side food stall, so don't expect much, but it's still great.

Very poor quality food, poor quality of service. It's dirty, unhealthy. A place where you would never want to eat once you go there. And if you take away, then the utterly poor food will make you wish that you don't have to eat again.

The rating is only for the food they serve.
Something I love to eat here is their pan fried momo's. Juicy tender and there's a bit of the stuffing in every bite. Apart from momo's they also prepare decent Chinese dishes. 
Would recomond people to opt for a home delivery, cause there is no fine in facility some chairs scattered on the footpath.

I like their momos which are quite big with decent meat portion @60 bucks only.  The rolls are also good and edible to say so the least.I personally didn't like their chinese and north indian mains .Won't comment on the biryani because I haven't had it.

It's at Pallyshree more, beside the auto stand connecting Pallyshree wid jadavpur.
It's a fast food joint. Mainly take away. Whenever we don't cook we order home delivery from here. No dinning arrangement. Nly few chairs spread aimlessly.
The rolls, momos, noodles r good here. But oily. Don't expect that much health here as I said fast food place.
The Chinese side dishes r good(chicken)
If u r hungry in this area u can trust dem to fillup ur appetite without any health issue.

Quality is good. Can be better. Mainly takeaway, dine-in is a joke. :v
They make good momos, lachha parathas and chicken sides.
Overall - not bad.
