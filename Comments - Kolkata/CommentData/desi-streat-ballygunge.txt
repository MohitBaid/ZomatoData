Not the most consistent in taste. Loved the papei chat, dahi vada not so great. Portions are generous. 
Delivery service is reasonable. And the most time saving in the food court.

For chaat-lovers it is not quite the best place to eat those tongue tickling, mouth watering, spicy treats. It is quite okay for a quick, quiet lip smacking sampling of roadside offerings in a more hygienic setting.

Although a bit expensive but quality of food is good. South indian items are just average, but chaats are very good. My personal favourite is palak papdi chaat. Dahi bada and tikia chaat is also good....

This is the perfect choice to offer my taste buds with some South Indian Rava Onion Dosa and the chatpata, yummy and massive Raj Kachori. Amidst shopping spree at The Quest, Desi Streat would be a good choice to curb hunger pangs.

We ordered the Papri Bhalla Chat from Desi streat and were pretty impressed by the presentation as well as the taste. The various chutneys that were used to prepare this was a real blast of flavours inside. A must try at this food joint as you would just crave for more. It indeed was an awesome chat.. üòçüòçüòç

Located inside food court of Quest mall...Had d Kolkata chat Phuchka.. 10 pieces for INR 95 + GST... Phuchka, Aloo mix and Pudina water were provided separately. Phuchka was tasty but it can never beat the flavor of Ekdalia's phuchka for me. Overall a good, one-time try.

As the name suggests, this place promises some the most delicious treats from the streets of India. I tried their Raj Kachori, which was impressive. Usually, I avoid Raj Kachori because of all the curd. But thankfully, these guys did a good job, creating a good balance of tastes, and cutting the tartness to the right level. I also had a Masala Rava Dosa. Considering that it offers street food, this dosa was quite good in comparison to the regular dosas we get. It was crisp and filling, and the sambhar and chutney were quite tasty!

This place specialises in¬†Chats¬†and¬†South Indian¬† cuisine. Chat is something which we all love to have and the¬†Raj¬†KachoriChat¬†was really impressive. The kachori was huge in size. It was stuffed with a mixture of potato mash and peas. It was garnished with curd, sweet chutney, bhujia and coriander leaves. I actually fell in love with the chat. It was sweet, tangy and very filling.

Another dish which I had here was the Rava Onion Dosa. The dosa was perfectly crispy. The onions were well fried. It was served with a bowl of sambar, white coconut chutney and red chutney. I loved having the dosa with the sambar.

'Desi Streat' is surely the paradise for chaat lovers in the city of joy! They present the chaats, tikkis and all other related street eats in the comfort of the mall food court in a hygienic environment. Recently I was there for a food trail at the QCourt and got the opportunity to taste two of their signature dishes - Raj Kachori and Rava Onion Dosa. Yes, they serve some tasty South Indian food as well. 

Truly speaking, I just loved the Raj Kachori as it had a huge kachori filled in with diced pieces of boiled potatoes, peas, sprouts and chopped onion, tomatoes and loads of cilantro, yogurt, sev, tangy tamarind chutneys and chaat masalas sprinkled on top. All in all, it was one of the finest chaats I have had in a long time sitting here in my city. And by the way, this Raj Kachori can easily be shared by three hungry souls. Coming to the Rava Onion Dosa, frankly speaking I have had better versions of this dish in the city though I must say what I got here at Desi Streat was filling and can easily be lived with. The Rava onion Dosa was served with bowls of sambar, white coconut and orange chutneys. The Dosa was tad too oily but it tasted pretty nice with the chutneys and sambar.

Overall I would suggest this place for their amazing chaats. The prices are reasonable and service is pretty prompt. Do give them a visit if you are at the Quest mall food court.

Cheers!

We love all kinds of food but there will always be a soft corner for the streets and it's amazing food. But what if you get the new avtar of street eats in a comfort eating ambience ? I know many might just not agree but hey it ain't that bad if you upgrade yourself in terms of hygiene and proper surroundings. So saying that at first all this chats and all is very common all over the country but if you get the same kind or almost close to the Delhi special street eats here in Kolkata ,you would surely feel nice about it. The place i am talking about is Desi Streat which makes signature street eats and as i was invited by First Idea Pr ,i was lucky enough to try the Raj Kachori Chat which looked supremely good and tasted absolutely on point. It was crispy and soft too inside which had a great combination. The fillings were so nicely garnished with different chutneys and add ons that simply was enjoyable to the fullest. 
Okay apart from that there are many other chats but they also have a South eating choice too.Now for that the Onion Rava Dosa was the one that was the choice of eat.I was not very much convinced about its preparation. Seemed pretty simple and kind of tasteless if eaten without the sambhar and chutneys. So its like a different view for both but yes they have a lot of things to eat from so do try out the specials and definitely you will get a difference of eating than regular times.

Pls do not never eat here, my wife and 1.5 year old  son ate idli, potentially the safest food anywhere, my son never had Sambhar. Both of them have food poisoning since even after returning to Mumbai. My son is having excruciating pains cries throughout and is awake for most of the night last 2 days. I am requesting an FDA inspection, hope this place shuts down before more people get infected. No apology ever can compensate for my son crying through the night.

I have been to Quest Mall for celebrating my grandparents' anniversary and ordered stuffs from many outlets sharing all the dishes. Queerly enough, none actually wanted chaats and I being the younger lot, did not comment much. However, I was asked to buy aerated drinks and that is when I approached this place.

Being a part of the Food Court, one cannot comment much on the ambiance as they all tend to follow a similar set of patterns. However, the service needs to have a mention and this is what I am doing.

Standing there for a minute, no one batted an eye so as to ask the potential customer what he wants. I broke the ice, asking him to take the card. He, then acting as if noticed, took the card and asked for the order.

I, smiling at him, ordered for two large Coke along with extra glasses. He swiped the card and handed my order in lightning speed which was a boon.

I have had not tried their dishes and hence I am rating here solely based on the order experience.

Delhi Aloo Tikki Chaat @ Desi Streat - Food Court of Quest Mall, Kolkata ‚ò∫

Delhi style Aloo Tikkis are not easily available on Kolkata streets, nor are they easily traceable in the restaurant menus. Even when they are available, mostly they are not up to the mark. 

Normally, we end up having them at the hi-tea counters of marriages and other social dos (generally of marwari and punjabi communities), or at our home kitchens. 

During one of my recent visits to Quest Mall's food court, I was pleasantly surprised when  a well made dish of Aloo Tikki was presented upon ordering.

Two big and crisp Aloo Tikkis were served on a white egg shaped melamine plate with a small circular bowl shaped partition at one end. The Aloo Tikkis were topped with thick yoghurt, tamarind chutney, spices, sev and coriander leaves. They were also infused with chopped vegetables, like - carrot and beans, which really did not contribute to any additional taste. But in totality, the Chaat was well made and tasted nice.

The portion served was big and more than enough for one person.

It needs mentioning, that the empty attached bowl looked quite funny. Filling this bowl with some complimentary food item would have appeared nice.

Menu Price: Rs. 125/-

Awesome taste !! HAPPINESS ALERT FOR CHAAT LOVERS !! I have eaten chats in many restaurants and food courts here in kolkata (not talking about street side cart food) but this one was exceptional in this class. I ordered bhalla papdi chaat, raj kachori and dahi puchka chaat. Everything was so perfect in it, taste of curd, chutney and everything. Adequate proportion of food.  Mouth watering presentation, nicely garnished. If you are in quest mall, you must try it once.

When it come to Street Food 'Indian chats' nothing can beat Raj Kachori Chaat, Dahi Puchka and Papai Bhalla Chaat. In spree of Chaat we went to Desi Street a outlet in Quest Mall. Ambience was chilling as it was food court but the Chaat was too overloaded. Now people will ask me what's 'too overloaded' it means to jumbled up as Dahi was necessary in every chat but in few they put less and few they put more then necessary which ruined the taste. They should use every ingredient in equal equation for the best taste.

I've heard this place is good for Chaat, and I should have stuck to it. I ended up having Pav Bhaji from here...and it was awful! Nothing bad in itself, it just wasn't what Pav Bhaji is supposed to be. Look and aroma was good! But I hope they improve on its taste as well, and soon. I had to add a lot of chopped onion and squeezed lemon to make it taste okay-ish. Also, for its price the Pav Bhaji was totally not worth it.
Hope to have a better experience next time with another dish.

I have been to this place in food court a lot of times but this will be my first time writing a review. I have always been a fan of dosa and this place has a variety of dosas available. My favourite one is cheese masala dosa which i even had it today. They served two types of chutney. One is green and one is red. The sambar can be refilled a lot of times. It is huge in quantity and personally, I cannot finish eating it myself. Really reasonable price. It just costed me rs209 and will definitely eat here again.

This joint are ones one need it badly after that full on shopping. Another kiosk in the food court of very famous quest mall on 4th floor.

Quest mall offers a big food court then any other shopping malls in Kolkata, with proper sitting arrangement and variety with a wide range of traditional food, including chats and all with south indian delicacies. 

So after my shopping,  just reached this place. I had their dahi vada which was soft and full of dahi with special chutneys sour and sweet. Their moong ka chilla was also tempting, as it was accurately cooked and well served, what i didn't enjoyed much was the service. They were quiet slow. As i satisfied myself with the coke first.
One who likes traditional indian delicacies should surely visit and try their food.. . . Its pocket friendly even. As you can easily visit this place whenever you are there in quest mall.üòä

A decent place to try South Indian cuisines and Chaats at the food court of Quest Mall. Ordered for a Masala Dosa. The Dosa was quite crispy and crunch, stuffed with a tasty filling of potatoes. The mixture tasted decent, but felt, it lacked a bit of spices. The Sambhar was quite tasty, and was one of the best Sambhars', i have had. The service was pretty fast, and hence we did not have to wait longer!

Desi snacks joint in food court of quest mall. Serves south indian cuisine, chats, traditional desi snacks and beverages. Ambitious was really amazing. Hospitality was good. Staff was friendly and helpful. Service was quick and presentation was really nice. In this visit we ordered dosa platter which was three 7'' pizzas in our choice filling with sambhar and chatni. Dosa's were perfectly cooked and very tasty in taste. Sambhar was true taste of rasam very delicious and perfectly made. Chatni was also good. We also ordered raj kachori which was fully filled with sweet dahi, moth, aloo, vada, bhujiya, chana, pomegranate etc. It was true desi. Perfectly made and very very delicious. It was an fantastic experience here with true taste of indian snacks. Personal favorite. Must visit place. Highly recommended to all.

I tried this place out once with my friend. She wanted me to try the Raj Kachori. I must say it was quite nice. It tasted fresh and really pleasing. But slowly, I found it too sweet and could not eat anymore. But that's because I am not really fond of chaat. I am sure all the chaat lovers would enjoy this dish. I do recommend this place to all for a quick bite when at Quest. Happy Dining!

Didn't like it much though the service is quick and efficient and the staff is good too. We had ordered papri bhalla chaat where the papri were less and it was too heavy on the curd, making it a watery ride.

Forget fine dining restaurants, some of our best food experiences come from street food.  Desi Street brings back that feeling and that excitement with its big range of street food items.

Location: it is situated at the food court of Quest Mall, beside Masala Kitchen.

Food: their food is pretty good. One of those places you should be visiting if you're at Quest food court. This place does justice to its food. Plus, there's an  amazing variety that they provide with their dosa segment.
Masala Dosa: amazingly made. It is complemented with sambar, chutney and a tangy anchar. Potato filling evenly made distributed. Better than your usual dosas. 

Idli: light, fluffy delights complemented with your usual sambar, chutney and a tangy anchar.

Dosa Platter: their Dosa Platter comes with three dosa with your choice of filling. Economical than buying three dosas individually.

Management: their service is prompt. And the staff there are courteous and friendly.

I had visited the place just when Quest Mall had opened, and there were only 2-3 counters in food court of Quest Mall. The experience here was the best I had at any food courts I have visited in India. Build your own Dosa is what we had chosen, we got a delicious Dosa with toppings of our choice. They don't give you the Tax surprise over and above the mentioned price which according to me is very positive.

The outlet at quest that makes every chatokra person want to try the chaat section here. Palak ke chatpati chaat and delhi aloo tikki chaat being soo amazing in taste, you don't want to miss on them. The classic Delhi aloo tikki chaat stands on its expectations. Dont go by the name when u read palak on the menu, its not one of those green veggies u try to ignore at the dining. üòú Its surprisingly tasty and apart from the fact its palak leaves FRIED with besan. I am guessing its a more healthier and crunchier option than the regular papri chats. Service- quick and polite.
Quality & Quantity- worth it

One of the good joints in quest food court . Dosa's are comparatively priced more than other places.  usually a plain dosa is for 70, here its 110. But the quality is really good. The sambar and the white chutney are made to perfection. So the price does not sting. Service is fast. They usually get the food ready in not more than 7/8 mins

Location : 4th Floor, Food Court, Quest Mall.

It‚Äôs easy to find this counter with Desi Street written in colorful flashy lights. The outlet provides all famous Indian street foods like chaats and paani puri available athwart the country under a single stall. However, it specializes in south Indian cuisines like dosas and uttapam.

The following constituted our order :-

1) Raj Kachori Chaat: It was the best Rajkachori I have had after a long time. The stuffing was in authentic Indian style. The quantity was also enough to suffice for 2 souls.
2) Dosa Platter: Contains 3 dosas with your choice of toppings. We had ordered Cheese, Onion and Jalapeno topped dosas, all of which were very scrumptious.

No doubt the food is good. Economical option at a not-so-economical place.

This ones located right at the centre of the quest mall food court, flanked by two other restaurants this one is easy to spot! With their white counters and colourful lights! 
I have only tried their South Indian delicacies, from time to time and loved it. Their dosa platter is rather interesting where they serve three mini size dosas with the choice of toppings from cheese/tomato/onion etc, the Sambar and the chutneys served along with the dosas are good to taste and goes well the crispy hot dosa which they serve. I have tried their cheese masala dosa too, they give the right amount of cheese which doesn't overwhelm and take away from the authentic flavours of the dosa. There's a live dosa counter and you can see a chef preparing the dosa from the scratch, their idlis and uttapams are also equally good. I personally love their onion uttampams, and especially for lunch or dinner it's rather filling. As far as South Indian food is concerned the options inside the quest mall are rather limited and this place is pretty good at it. The only problem is with the service but I guess uttapams take a little bit of time because the batter is thick and it has to be fried in the tawa properly but the end result is delicious and hence I don't have any complains. Their prices are moderately reasonable, they also have a chaat section where they have a wide range starting from Raj kachoris to puchka but I have never tried them except for this one time when I cousin had ordered some puchka but I didn't find either the tamarind water or the potato stuffing anything special.In case you visit this place just stick to South Indian food, they are actually good!

The outlet seems interesting but there's nothing so special about it.
The raj kachori is good and dosa's garlic chutney is awesome!
People who love chaat shall try it out.

Tried out the desi cuisine from here.....Delhi Aloo Tikki Chaat.....and the food was not as appealing as it seemed to be. Firstly, I must say that they kept us waiting for over 15 min where we were supposed to wait for only 6 min!!! The Chaat was not at all worth the cost....the aloo tikki got a little burnt as a result it tasted a bit bitter....didn't enjoy the food much as it appeared to be.

So here's what I'm wondering- why would anyone want to pay this much for chaat? Is it the air conditioning? 

We tried the Raj Kachori and mixed chaat and paapri chaat. The food was good, but i dont reckon i will eat there again . New Market Street chaat is better. When it comes to chaat you need to be able to tell the vendor that u need a little extra curd or a little less chutney...

My experience was just okay.

This place does not fail to satisfy me and everytime I visit it, it gets better. I love the dosa- rava and plain, onion, masala dosa and the dips and sambar are perfect. The sambar is not watery and has the right taste of tamarind and spice and goes perfectly with the dosa. The chats are delicious and the quantity is quite good for one person and cannot be consumed. Well-made , tasty food and good service from the staff. I love this place and anytime is dosa time. I would recommend it to all of you who love Indian snacks and would not mind paying the price for quality.

Just try their Palak Chaat. Its just amazing. We ordered Raj Kachori and Palak Chaat. Both were equally good. But why waste so much for street food at a mall's food court hain na? Just give Palak Chaat a try. That one is unique. Baki sab you'll get anywhere :)

Do you wonder why you would pay more for your regular aloo tiki chaat and bhelpuri? You're right! Don't. If you crave the street food that they claim to serve, go out on the streets. Much much better value for your money at vivekananda park for the same stuff provided you don't mind them not using gloves while dishing up your chaat

The first thing one notices is that the staffs are extremely unorganized and that there's a big crowd around this place always. 
After standing and calling out the attendants a few times, our ordered were finally taken. 
We ordered for an onion uttapam and Palak patta chaat from this particular joint.

After waiting for a good 15 minutes my mum went and had to stand and get the stuffs ready bcz of the crowd which kept on increasing and further confusing the staffs. Anyway, coming to the food. 
The palak patta chaat was strictly okay. The batter of the palak was too thick and not according to my like. 
Coming to the uttapam, it lacked salt. However, the accompanying sambhar and chutneys tasted good. Unlike other food courts, these people also serve the red chutney along with the usual coconut one which is impressive!

So my mom pushed me to get some stuffs from spencer quest and after loads of home shopping was really tired. and headed straight to the food court to satisfy my taste buds as well as my stomach in kolkata heat.. So directly ordered raj kachori taking the climate into account and it didn't leave me disappointing even for a minute.. It was crispy with proper flavours and perfect amount of sweet and spice .. Will b eager to try out other dishes well...

DESI STREET 
I got a chance to visit Desi Street. If you are fond of chaat pakoras and you want it in the comfort of all malls where you can sit and eat, you should try this place.
=============================================================================================================
Intro

Desi Street is located at Quest mall, ballygunge. It‚Äôs actually a counter in the malls food court. There are a variety of chats to choose from. The counter was quite crowded when i visited there so it took a while for me to order.
=============================================================================================================

Food 

Moong Chilla: The chilla preparation was quite different. It actually looked like a dosa when they served me, but the taste was really good. The green chutney and the red garlic chutney complimented the chilla well. However, I found it to be on oily side.

Raj kachori: It tasted very good. It has the right amount of spices and curd to compliment the kachori, overall there is no complain about raj kachori. It tasted pretty good.
=============================================================================================================

Pros:

a)	Good Food.
b)	Decent Pricing 
c)	Raj Kachori was excellent 
d)	Presentation of chilla was different 

Cons :

a)	Service was slow 
b)	The chilla was oily 
=============================================================================================================
Conclusion: 

Overall, Desi Street is worth giving a try if you want to try some street side type food.

This is the nth time I am giving a place 3.5, but you know, 3.5 is such a safe rating. Good enough! It aptly states the emotion that you liked the food, yet wasn't blown off your feet or something! 
This place serves all sorts of street food in a hygienic way. And the place has some nice South Indian food too. I have been here twice and on the first occasion we had ordered the dosa platter. For 150 rs they gave us 3 dosas (smaller than the regular ones we have) with 3 different filings. The first one was the usual potato filling that they give, the second one was onion and the third was cheese. The cheese and the normal tasted quite well, the sambar was good, but the onion dosa was disappointing. They just gave minced onions inside a plain dosa. 
On our second visit we had Mysore masala dosa and Raj Kachodi Chaat. While I'd have given the place a 3 rating based on the first visit, the second visit turned out to be better. The Mysore Masala Dosa was tasty, especially the crust. And the chaat too was well made, and we really enjoyed our food this time. 
Nothing great, but good enough!

Desi Street serves up vegetarian street fast food as the name suggests. I personally love Chilla"s ( I call them my vegetarian omelette ;-)  ) and once I read my friend and fellow foodie Rahul's review I was waiting to try it out. And yes it was a generous sized Chilla that was really tasty and I enjoyed it .... plan to return to have it soon !  My friend tried the Pani Puri ( Puchka as we call it ) and said it was so-so. However if you want to eat street food in relatively hygienic conditions then this is a good place to stop by for a bite on occasion.

This is a vegetarian outlet in the Food Court of the mall and they serve chaats and south Indian food, First time i went i had the chilla and that was HUGE ! and tasty too.... served with two chutneys and total value for money . On the next visit I had the Idli and the Ragi Dosa ( Yes, you heard me right ) Being on a health spree i am quite in love with ragi as a flour and I was shocked to see it in dosa form . 

The ragi dosa was thin crisp and absolutely oil free. I loved both the chutneys they served the coconut chutney was fresh and light and the tomato chutney had lovely flavor . One of the better sambhars I have had, the pepper and the tamarind both came out so well. 


The idlis I packed and forgot about them and believe me they were soft even after 5 hours. KUDOS ! 

Loved the food and next time I am sure to have the Palak Chat and the Ragi Idlis .

Walked in with my daughter and wife one Tuesday afternoon. Seating ourselves in the food court, we decided to order.

I wanted a tikia chhola, and decided to try these people. The counter was clean. People were well mannered. I asked for tikia chhola and was billed 90 (the ragra patis showed up as 125 on the board). And sure enough they had billed for just the aloo tikia. Made them bill for the balance and requested for chhola instead of ragda (ghoogni).

It was served in a nice clean and large platter. I was a tad shocked to see the person preparing it with bare hands. Not acceptable in a situation like this. The item itself was nothing much to write home about. I have of course had far better tikias. The chhole was banal. And all this for Rs 125 makes it rather disappointing. 

I hope others have had a better experience.
