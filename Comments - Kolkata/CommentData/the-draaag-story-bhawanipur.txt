First of all location is pretty convenient as it is nearby metro station. Secondly the hookah that they serve is absolutely fantastic and long lasting and exactly as per ur need. Thirdly the ambiance is nice for hanging out casually or for a party purpose even! Lastly the staffs are very helpful and generous! It is a must try outlet for every hookah lover :)

Excellent outlet, A class service by the staffs. Satisfactory food! It's spacious and will make you comfortable, loud music are the best part. Great for birthday parties and groups.
However, not that much privacy one will get if they are going with their girlfriends. :-P

New place with comfortable sitting arrangements and easily located near The Banana Leaf restaurant. Hookah was very good with dense smoke and nice flavours. Special family garlic bread was yummy. Attendants were very attentive and interactive. There is also snooker for you and your group. Must visit place. We also got to know about their ladies special day and live music shows.
