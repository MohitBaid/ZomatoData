Visited Fancy snack bar for lunch and ordered Chole Bature.. And much to my horror found a small cockroach stuck to my bhatura which was actually fried with it... Horrific sight. Attached the pix below.

Must have Dosa dishes over here, one of the best.
Seating arrangement upstairs and standing downstairs. Syrup & Ice creams items are also good.

In terms of location, near fancy market. I had been to this place a couple of times, the last one was the shortest visit to grab a bottle of thumsup after some shopping in Khddirpore.Â 

It has 2 areas, the ground floor where you can stand and have your food on the tables, there is not seating area as such. On the first floor you have 3 tables where you can be seated and enjoy your food. Its a very small and cramped up space upstairs. Don't expect any great ambiance or anything.

I only had the grilled sandwich and idli. Grilled sandwich was still OK, Idli was bad.

When I go to fancy market or kidderpore I will definitely visit this place for having a syrup or cold drinks, but couple of times I had their cheese dhosa and plain dosa, staffs are little arrogant but quiet efficient and fast.

Fancy market at kidderpore is been always crowded with people. Since its a huge market place this place is very old at this place and attracting all the passing by customers. Its generally a cafe type but they still they deal in with complete food items too. Ambaince is decent with stand and eat. Place is nice and clean. Staffs are very attentive and polite as well.
We had the lunch before so just we took ice cream and double Expresso.
It was machine made expresso but was truly tasty. The foam on the above with chocolate powder on the above. The coffee was good in quantity and worth the money.
A second visit is surely due here for tasting all the other food stuffs.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

The taste of their garlic bread with cheese is just out of this world, and their dosas and pastas are good too. The taste part is very nice. But, the problem lies in the cleanliness, big rats all around the place and torn seats. Also, home delivery takes a lot of time.

This is a small joint near the '5 star market' or the 'fancy market' which serves south indian & few other items like pizza, sandwiches, shakes etc. There is not much of an interior and the food is average while south indian being it's personal best.
