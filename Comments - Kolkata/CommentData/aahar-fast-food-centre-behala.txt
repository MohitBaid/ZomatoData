This food joint is situated in between the Sakherbazar James long Connector. Had tried their many items such as rolls,noodles and combos. The food quality is good and are pocket friendly too.

Not the very best but the chow and rice combos are good and chicken tikka kabab roll is a must try..Garlic chicken is thik-thak but butter chicken is sweet in taste and is awful

Though this restaurant is located in Sakherbazaar just adjacent to the Rickshaw Stand this is the first time that I have actually eaten something from here.

This was a take away order so I will only talk about the food. 
We ordered Laccha Paratha and Lemon Chicken and this is the first time I tried Lemon Chicken. The chicken was good and rightly cooked but you have to have a special liking for lemon to like the gravy after you have consumed some of it (they must have done it right but I am not having lemon chicken again :P)

I have heard they serve good biriyani..will look forward to try it....

Low cost, average quality, good taste and most importantly, consistent.
If you are on a budget, look no further.
The dine in option is not recommended, unless you prefer just anything better than standing and eating your roll on the road.
Chicken bharta and jeera rice other than the rolls, are about above average.

A standard pllace for rolls, chicken kabab roll is pretty good. Ahar can be considered for a good quality fast food take-away amidst the busy lane of sakherbajar.
