A pure veg restaurant is a treat for veg families like ours! Been visiting this place regularly with family for many years now and it never disappoints. The ambience is very welcoming and decor is quite "Indian". Elderly family members feel as comfortable as youngsters do. The food is tasty, though slightly on the expensive side. Still, a must visit if you are looking to have a great time with family over meals.

To day I visited Haveli restaurant for Dinner and ordered for Sizzler and Ministroni and Tomato soup .The soup and Sizzler was a hopeless preparations. It was cold and of no taste.I suggest not to visit this restaurant as it's sheer wastage of money and mood.

This is a pure veg joint. There is a bar too in the same building called Bronze. The bar is reasonable but the food menu is a bit expensive. But the quality is excellent and so is the ambience

Overpriced vegetarian ka adda.. Not a feasible option for a satisfactory dinner. The food is strictly good.. The ambience is similar to that of a awadhi nawab grand court.. But pardon me the taste. You are not supposed to pay a havoc for something so ordinary.

Atrocious food at fine-dining prices. They served gutte ki pullav with curry leaves and without raita; served missi roti without ghee or butter. Service is pathetic. However, the ambience is okay, but old! Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

They are neither chilled. Warmer than room temperature I believe.

Quality falling day by day.

No dressing on the starter.

A nice and soothing place to dine in with your friends and family .
I went there with my family . Menu have loads of choices for vegetarians  . We ordered hot n sour soup dat completely taste like Manchurian sous. People going out to restaurant are seeing for a dishes they not eat or get in their kitchen but according to me they hav loads of dishes which is like home dishes there were loads of potatoes related dishes for instance . The plates n bowls arranged before should be arranged in a manner that they don't giv a feeling of being dirty to the diners, the shape of bowl should be changed as it is very difficult for some to eat from .
While food is served hot and order doesn't take too long to be on ur table . Ambience is wonderful . Staffs are well behaved and attentive . Over all a nice place bt could be better.

Expensive but not premium

This place does not leave to give u feeling of rajasthan palace where everything is served on silver like plates.. But when it comes to food, I dint find it value for money. Quantity was very less as per its price and talks of service, it took them at least 15 mins to bring a single roti.. taste of food is ok to good but was not very hot which spoiled d mood..

A good restro needs good service and good taste apart from its ambience.

I was ready to give a good 4 rating but that became 3.5 when they said tomato soup is not available, then we ordered food whish was ok as expected, then after a while we were informed dal which we ordered is not available, rating was 3 by this time. Then we were served wrong order in breads we ordered with this and slow service final rating was 2.5.

Have heard a lot about this place so thought to give it a try. Best place for vegetarian and can avail many options from their menu. 
Ambiance is nice with rajasthani touch, well decorated and dim light. 
Food quality and quantity is very good and can satisfy one hungry soul no matter if vegetarian or non vegetarian. 
I ordered missi roti, paneer sikh kabab, corn palak and ice cream, all was awesome.
Service is fast and waiters were very prompt whatever you ask. 
Look forward to visit again.

It is a tremendously expensive restaurant serving mediocre food. Ordered food via swiggy, ordered veg malai kofta, rajasthani alu and missi roti. 2 small pieces of veg kofta @ rs 240, 4 small pieces of potato @ rs 270, one missi roti @ rs 80. packaging was good but the food items present inside the attractive package were not good at all. If someone has too much money to spend on bad food then they can visit it, otherwise avoid it , there are many other good veg restaurants serving better food at cheaper cost.

It is the nearest restaurant to my home and yet today was only the first time that i tried it with lots of expectations but ended totally disappointed...

We went for the Vegetable sizzler (with the notion that it is a 'veg special' restaurant) and mocktails (blue lagoon and the sizzling strawberry)...the mocktails tasted pretty ordinary...the sizzler consisted of tomato and capsicum cutlets, sphagetti and rice (both almost negligible) and 2-3 pieces of withered french fries..so it was monotonous veg cutlet all over and the sauce used really did not go down well with us so much so that we were feeling pukey at the end...initially it looked and tasted good as it was really served sizzling hot .but we were left regretting about visiting this place in the end...ambience is ok..seating area good enough but no where near the best in the city..staffs really need better grooming..poor service overall and slow as well..very very disappointed...i wont recommend this restaurant atleast for non veg people....prices are on the moderately higher side..

My first visit to this pure vegetarian restaurant was on my birthday way back in 2011. And till date I have fond remembrance of their food. Situated on the 2nd Floor of 2CK, The Saltee Hotel, Salt Lake in Calcutta this joint would never let you down. 

The food here can be termed as the best Vegetarian food you can ever think of. It is light, easy on stomach and delicious at par to any fine dining restaurant. The ambiance is artistic and very beautiful; the service is also very good so is the lavish menu.  It can be touted as a perfect family dining station.

I asked if there is any discount on any card, they said HDFC and ICICI. I offered ICICI and then they revered there is no discount on ICICI now. Later I came to know that there is discount on AXIS bank card too , which I never told at restaurant.  I will not recommend this place just on basis on ambiance.

Peas pulao and everything was superb. Food was hot , fresh.  Cooked really well , as werr the only customer sitting the service was extraordinary.

May be bcoz of bad reviews many ppl are avoiding place but believe me food was really reallly really gud but yes its too expensive. It costs me around 2900 & tht was my treat and guess wht i forgot my wallet so my mom paid the bill.😁 And she immediately took it back frm me as soon as i reached home. Hahahaha.

Ill-mannered staff !!

Yesterday (i.e. 19-Oct-16)I have been to this restaurant with my better half for dining on the occasion of Karwa Chauth and have requested for a corner table instead of the table being offered at the gate with a lot of noice at the next table because of being occupied by a group of boys.

Given the noice and to enjoy the meal at peace I painstakingly requested the manager on duty 'Mr. Rana Pratap Singh (as informed by him) to offer me the table at the corner (2 of which were completely empty out of 6 empty tables) but he very blatantly turned down the request. Given his rude and lackadaisical attitude I choose to go to a different restaurant still he was unmoved and instead of being curtious being in a hospitality industry he very arrogantly opened the doors for us to walk-off.

A restaurant is generally known for its food and more for it hospitality. 

But my yesterday's experience will never bring me back to this restaurant EVER!!

A suggestion of the restaurant management to hire people which matches industry restaurant (hospitality) instead of like Mr. RANA PRATAP SINGH who carried such arrogance. Sincere need to training and grooming.

Thanks & Regards

One of the worst dine in experiences in Kolkata..We went on Navami night with whole family and it was a decision to regret.At first the AC was nt working bt still we managed as the weather was Gud outside.The waiters and managers were nt there to attend.After requesting fr 2-3 times we were served water.Although the restaurant was nt crowded,the service was pathetic as thy brought starters and main course together..
We repeatedly told that the Chinese dish we ordered should be without mushroom bt all in vain.We had a quarrel with the management and thy didn't look apologetic.We walked out of the restaurant in disgust..Very rarely come across such places in Kolkata where people just love food and eating to the core.

We visited this place last sunday, we easily got table. We order north indian food, gatte ki sabzi, malai kofta, klcha, naan and gratin. Starting with the food, gratin was up to the mark, quality was good. Hlin food gatte ki sabji was not upto the mark, it was jut cooked into paneer gravy, being a authentic rajasthani food restaurant, i expected good taste, however it was not upto the mark. Rest malai kofta and breads were good. In terms of ambience and staff the place is good.

I visited Haveli a couple of times and it has been my favorite folding destination initially, but I feel after paying a couple of visit that too in recent times I have found the quality of food is kinda deteriorating!
On my last visit we ordered
Crispy chilly babycorn : Which was not crispy at all though was chilly babycorn
Paneer tikka masala : Which was well cooked a little spicy but was nice 
Sabj jhalfarezi : Which was to my surprise tasted simply awesome when I had ordered it in my previous visit (for first time) but this time it tasted tasteless, and wasn't upto the mark at all!
Gatte ki sabji : I was unsatisfied with Gatta, because being from Rajsthan I really know how Gatta actually tastes, which is for sure not what they had served! Very disappointed with gatte ki sabji!
Daal-e-Haveli was really good and worth a try.
Breads were good and had no complaints specially Naan was perfect!
Jeera rice was okay!
I just wonder how this place get good reviews where management is lame!
They don't listen at all! 

Decor was nice, staff is good, management is joke, and Pocket pinch is high!
Fly Kouzina is much much better option if we intend to pay such price for food!

Probably one of the best vegetarian restaurant in Kolkata. Everything that I had seemed to hold on to its very original taste ( as per the taste I am used to or aware of). Many people complaint of slow service, but anything that tastes good takes time good amount of cooking time. However, if you are in a hurry then this not the place you should drop into. To get the real feel of the quality of food, be ready to spend around an hour.

Located near No. 9 tank Petrol Pump, this is a vegetarian restaurant. Even though it is very close to my place, I came to know about this place when a friend of mine was all in praises about the food. So decided to drop in. Ordered misi roti, paneer makhanwala and dal makhni. Oh well, the misi roti was more like Papad. It was just bad. Paneer was just ok. Nothing great. 
Food - Disappointed 
Service is slow. 
Ambience - Decent 
Price - A bit too pricey

The menu was strawberry milk shake, spring roll, tomato soup, paneer seekh kebab,dahi vada, peas pulao, masala kulcha, butter naan, peas kachori, dal makhani, stuffed potato, paneer butter masala, paneer cutlet, masala papad. All items were very well prepared. Just loved their kulcha and paneer butter masala. In desert there was their signature dish rabri. It was just awesome. Must try. Tried their vanilla ice cream with chocolate cake kind of semi-brownie but didn't like much. Staffs are extremely good.In one line a very good veg restaurant.

One of the best places to have veg. Loved the dal makhani and other veg items. The ambience is nice and the service is pretty good. Must visit for veg lovers. The price is a bit high.

The interiors are made up in the typical 19th century Indian Haveli of the British Sahib's or the Rai Bahadur's .Calm Quiet and nostalgic.
It really has very earthy feel and warmth to it.
Staff is prompt and Professional.
We ordered Dahi Jeera Kebab and Navratan Korma with Naan and Tandoori Roti.
It was Heavenly!
I can say for a fact that I Haven't eaten a Naan so tasty (you can eat it plain. without the main course or any other dish).
Navratan Korma was rich with flavours and very good.
(Though I was a tad disappointed at the quantity)
Had a late lunch and the two dishes were sufficient.
Will try out the other dishes at the next opportunity.
PS ;It is a pure Vegetarian restaurant.

Visited Haveli recently with one of my colleague. First thing they are serving great north indian veg food, so if non vegitarian wants to try it for change,  they will savour the food served here. Ambience is very nice. They have put carved wooden planks on the walls and paintings, that adds to the very traditional feel to it. Service staff is very attentive and takes care of every customer personally. Food is served in time and at right temperature. All in all a very good experieance.

This rating is just for food.
Starters included Crispy Chilly Babycorn, Vegetable Spring Roll and Gratin.
Main course consisted of Pindi Chana, Methi Matar Malai, Paneer Makkanwala, Dal-e-Haveli, Butter Naan, Masala Kulcha, Lachha Paratha, Pineapple Raita and Papad.
Except Papad, everything was up to the mark!

If you need a pure vegetarian resturant in salt Lake... Hamelin is an option. It's one of the oldest pure veg restaurants in the city, popular among many in salt Lake.

Location- Right on the main road, conveniently located.
Ambience- brightly done up, pretty good.
Food:- 
Cream of tomato soup- perfect :)
Dal haveli- pretty decent but tad oily.
 Methi lacha paratha- just like it should be.
Methi malai matar- really nice creamy and yummy.
Paneer bharta- I loved this the most... Very well done.
 I feel they should increase their options for dessert.

I have been to this place twice with a friend who is vegetarian. It's a pure veg restaurant located just beside the HP petrol pump near tank no 9.

The decor and ambience is complimenting the name Haveli.. Really liked the decorations and the look n feel...

They make North Indian dishes really good... I remember the paneer tandoori was really yum and also try their mushroom dishes as well .
Even the crispy chilli babycorn and fried rice were quite tasty. I give credit to make veg dishes so yummy. It's a perfect multi cuisine option available here.

All in all a good experience. Veg people and drop in with family or friends in this complete family restaurant.

Had heard alot about this place and had been eager to try it for quite sometime. Finally we (the whole family) came here to celebrate a cousin's bday by giving our taste buds something to cheer about in this so hyped restaurant only to be disappointed to the core. All the expectations started going down the drain with every bite and every dish that was served. The manager added some more spice to the experience - it was like jale pe namak dalna. The manager had only one reply for everything- yahan ka yahi system hai, I can't do anything more. The taste and the quality of the food was pathetic and to top it up the behaviour of the people made it taste even worse. I am forced to give it a 1 rating coz there is no option of a negative rating here. I would not visit this place even if it's the last restaurant left in the city.

Quite unexpectedly, I had lunch yesterday from this fully veg restaurant as there was no other good quality restaurant in vicinity of CK block area. Scanning through the menu, I chose veg sizzler for my natural inclination towards it(the non-veg one of course!)at any place I go. The sizzler was good, though more variant in veg balls was expected. Also true to its name,this restaurant seemed to be in place for many years. The wooden architecture looked classy and waiters looked courteous. Overall it a place only for vegetarians and you will get wide variety of items there. For non vegetarians like me,well it's best to avoid such places.

My review is solely based on my dine-in experience which I had many many years back. Don't ask me when, I do not remember the year. All I remember, I was in school then, which should be round about 11-12 years back atleast. That was a time when I was crazy after Dhosas. One of my popular hangouts was a Dhosa shop which was operating at City Center-I, Salt Lake right where Aircel is functioning right now. One day, out of sheer curiosity, I happened to land up here to try their Dhosas, something which were they famous for those days. 

The place isn't far away from my home. I took an auto, got down at 9 No. Island. The restaurant is located right beside the petrol pump. I happened to walk in and make myself comfortable. Ordered for their Special Dhosa (Was called something like that, as far as I remember). The Dhosa was served in a short time. It was crisp, heavy, and full of flavors. Apart from the regular masala filling, it had some sort of special filling as well, which I do not remember. Besides, a lots of cashews and raising were also present which created a sweet and sour flavor when combined with the delightful Sambhar. 

The pricing was very reasonable and it was probably rated as Rs. 80 or Rs. 90/- as far as my memory goes. Down the years, they seem to have shifted from a Dhosa-centric menu to proper Vegetarian meals which keeps me away from here. Hopefully, I would find time and motivation to land up here soon and have an updated experience.

A lazy Sunday wonderful Indian breakfast, never knew the restaurant opens so early. Interior is very much dated and lacks maintenance. 
Had simple South Indian breakfast started with Idli and Vada. Continued with Masala Dosa and ended with piping hot coffee.
Food quality was decent is not extraordinary. Service is fast but in effort to make it faster made it clumsy.
Will recommend for quick stop over in case of any early morning trip.

Hunting for a vegan restaurant in Sector 2....a one time visit restaurant. The name Haveli suggests its appearance. A passerby will surely get caught by its outlook. Its interiors are also catchy however reception doesn't matches its standard.

Service is quite slow n food is also fine can't say good coz it suffers some lacking like some oily food stuffs, dal makhni not fresh etc etc etc...

However after eating all this ur experience will be good enough after a sip of famous soda wala outside the restaurant😉.

But this restaurant is only one time visit onlyy.

It was a very bad experience on 20.02.16 at Haveli Restaurant in salt lake city where the food was almost C Grade even the service also. The restaurant was so chilled that all the customers were shivering but the restaurant persons were not at all listening. Further no water in wash room. Above all.. The kind of dishes they were serving was horrible... I had to find potatoes in alu dum, paneer in panner lababdar, etc. They were serving normal water instead of warm water in finger bowl. When I complained about this, the floor controller said sorry instead of asking the waiter. Overall the service was also poor. 
Nobody should go to Hotel Haveli in salt lake. It's my view. Because we pay for good food and service and the quality there is lower than a roadside restaurant. We go there to enjoy but these people spoil the moment.

AVOID SPOILING YOUR EVENINGS BY GOING TO HAVELI RESTAURANT AT SALT LAKE.

But I must say when I visited them that was 2 days after Durgapuja. They were not able to serve good food. They served a pulao where the rices were not even boiled properly. 
So avoid to go there in occations. They are good in ordinary days.

Went there for lunch especially for the Chinese sizzler recommended to us. However,  was disappointed as soon as I set sights on the dish. It looked very dry and was served without rice/noodles which I am accustomed to with sizzlers. After I had some the sizzler really felt very dry and you couldn't eat it without gulping down drink along with it.

The service was notably poor, the waiter argued when we complained about the food. The ambience and setting isn't great as well.

You may give it a miss.

Visited this place after more than 10 years and noticed that food taste has gone down as compared to the past. We ordered Masala Dosa, Idly, Sambhar vada, Aloo Paratha, Poha, tea and juices for our family breakfast. Dosa was nice but had low masala content. Idly was well steamed, soft and fluffy- simply outstanding. Vada was also nice, however, very small in size. It is worth mentioning that their sambhar and chutney were very tasty. Aloo paratha was served with curd and pickle but was just a mediocre one. However, Poha was very nice - very tasty with decent vegetable content. Tea served was somewhat bitter due to use of excess tea leaves. Also, they do not serve fresh fruit juices and we had to settle for Real fruit juices!
Service is very nice and the staff tried to satisfy all our demands.
 Ambiance is quite boring. Management has tried to give the place a Rajwada touch but without much success. The furniture looks a bit tad and this place call for immediate renovation. They could consider playing some soft numbers in the background so that dine in customers do not feel bored. Prices are somewhat on a higher side.
Nevertheless, overall, it was a nice experience.

Cheers!

When you are hunting for a vegetarian place to dine out with your go green vegan pals you see Haveli and step right in. However given by the looks of this place the reception does not match up to its standards ...utterly butterly disappointing but since options are few you have no choice but to sit and eat in silence...yes food below expected standards as per price...a never go again zone for me....i would rather settle for our good old street side dosawala when on a veg day ☺

I wonder how this place got good reviews. This place is so poorly managed. Staffs r ill- mannered n rude. Taste is OK just like any other restaurants in city but price is not normal. They have premium price but quantity is extremely poor one of worst in city n taste doesn't match the price. Quality of food was not good either. Service is slow too. I feel this place good for nothing especially when we have a lot of good option available on the city. Haveli= high price+ v poor quantity+ poor quality of food+ v slow service+rude staff

As the name suggests, its really a Havelli for veg food.
We tried veg sizzler and that was soooo awesome. Also, panch mela daal and missi roti, with paneer.
We have been there trice, and every time the service is so good.
Overall, it is very good restaurant for vegetarian food.

We had been to Haveli last weekend. We started with Veg Hot and Sour soup and Mix Kebab platter. The Kebab platter was nothing but vegetables mashed and mixed with besan. The raw besan smell was coming out of the Kebab making it more worse. No taste at all. half eaten and half left away. Coming to main course, we ordered Dum Biryani, Chinese Sizzler, Dal Lasooni and some tamanchey item was there. All of these were ridiculous with no taste. The masala ingredients in tamanchey item was again raw with no taste. Sizzler was normal with nothing special. Biryani was not good at all. Its unnecesarily expensive. Given the price of food we can easily get better food many places. The dinner was completely spoilt. No one enjoyed.. Regarding the environment, we didi no feel anything special. AC not working properly.

The only thing we liked was Masala Papad and Thumbs Up (probably because they did not have to cook it). I would suggest - If you love your money and love good food better try Kaidi (if you are a vegeterian) or any other place. But not this one..

We were here to celebrate a personal anniversary and wanted to have all veg food. We got in at 9 pm for dinner, the place wasn't occupied much. The ambience was good,  with Rajasthan theme and services was fast.  We ordered soup and Chinese for starters, soup was just okay, but surprisingly paneer chilli tested very authentic. Coming to main course,  they had a decent list of Indian curry,rajasthani special and Chinese too. The food was equally tempting and tasty. Glad chose haveli for tonight

First time ordering through the Zomato app in Kolkata. The place we decided to go for (Haveli) was already a compromise as we (a group of meat lovers) needed a  pure veg restaurant due to Chhath. Anyways, the most interesting part of the evening was probably the message I received after placing the order - 'Haveli has declined your order as the restaurant is too busy. Please call them @ XYZ.' Or maybe the best part was the state of the restaurant when we turned up there - completely empty. The worst part was definitely the attitude of the staff when we complained about the message seeing as how they were quite literally twiddling their thumbs at the time - no one was ready to take any responsibility. I was told that they had no idea what had happened. Ultimately we placed the order (which was necessary as it is the only  pure veg restaurant of note in the area). The experience was a disappointing and disgusting one. Just as a side note - the food was tasty, but after the horror of ordering, it was more of a side show. 

One more thing that I think should be added - the order was for a complete family, a bill of over 3700 bucks.

Ordered food on Dashami Night. Food was tasty  but the quantity they delivered for the rice was too less. Same goes for the size of naan & Kulcha. However the side dishes were in proper quantity. I had asked the person taking the order if the same will be adeqate . He suggested an additional side dish but did not mention any thing about naan or rice. It really feels bad when the food ordered for your loved ones are not adequate.
Also price seems to be on the higher side.

I went with Groupon Voucher to Haveli on 17th OCt 2015@1:30 PM but my experience was too bad.. I had to wait for nearly 1 hour for the first item to come to my table. I repeatedly informed waiters and manager but they didn't take any look for my wishes, I was in bit hurry but all in vain..My advice is don't go there with vouchers..

Haveli was like amongst a very few veg restra which used to offer mouth watering food.. Unfortunately, their quality has deteriorated a bit not that it's not worth visiting but d level has surely gone down compared to the level which it had earlier..
Coming to the Menu... They have Chinese & North Indian
Chinese - Noodles and baby corn are good to eat but nothing wow element in it
Tried Sizzler as well... Which was even average..
North Indian- breads weren't that good.. Dal was fine n chana was even good
Service n ambience is worth praising... Interiors even looks good

Haveli..
Haveli located in a very convienient location in saltlake near tank no.9 is a pure veg restaurant..As the name says HAVELI the decor and ambience is just in a rajsthani theme
Its a family restaurant and serves one of the best north indian food in the city..
Whenever we feel like having an amazing north indian we consider haveli as one of the options..
Being a family restaurant we keep going their with our family members and everytime we get to the taste the same amazing quality if food..They are mainiating the quality and taste consequently and thats the best part of this restaurant...
Starting from Tomato soup,Panner tika in starters Some of our favourites in this eatery is daal makhani,paneer butter masala,mix vegetable...
Our all time favourite are their sizzlers..
Their masala kulcha in breads are the best of the kulchas one can ever have always same crispy and really soft ..

Overall an amazing pure veg restaurant ...

Haveli is unassumingly located amongst the meandering bylanes of Salt Lake. This all veg restaurant came highly recommended and I'm happy to say that I was very very satisfied with my meal there. Their blossom drinks are light and super refreshing. I loved the pineapple one while the orange, as most fresh orange drinks end up, had a bitter tinge. The au gratin, authenticity aside, is just a delicious dish. The burnt cheese on top blew my socks off :) The sizzlers here are huge and heavy. The veg sizzler was good stuff. For a sizzler neutral person, I'd be happy to order this one again. The Chinese sizzler had been dealt a heavy hand with the spices but was nicely done otherwise. Surprisingly and disappointingly, there is not much by way of desserts but the rabri was pretty darn good as well ! 

Mind you, this is an expensive place but hey, I am sure to return.

I tried aloo parantha with curd and achar, coffee and baked bean on a toast. Lemme tell you the baked bean on a toast was an amazing treat. The best I ever had. It was so good that I couldn't resist myself and gave a complimentary note to the chef. Must try.

Being a vegetarian, visited this place quite often! I have seen this place DETERIORATE. Though the ambience has a nice Rajasthani feel to it but the food has just degraded. The paneer tikka here was one of the bests the city had seen. But the quality of food and the cutlery in which it is served are a big let down.

Hi..yesterday we went to haveli for the dinner. When we entered the restaurant, the ambience was good and the atmosphere was pleasant. After some time most of the people had left as it was around 10 pm. And then suddenly we start feeling hot (literally sweating) and realised that the AC was not operating. After repeated complaining they told that one of the AC plant is not working, while when the restaurant was full, it was working. The food was also very spicy so overall we had a bad experience having very spicy food in a hot environment.

We went to Haveli for lunch. It is located just behind my office. Went there for the first time because we are not very fond of all-veg restaurants. But it is a very good restaurant for the veg lovers.  

The entrance is very narrow and hard to be spotted. But after entering through the large fort-like gate, you will be surprised to see the elaborated sitting area, fully decorated with Rajasthani elements. From Jharoka to bandhni dupatta to beautiful rajasthani paintings, motif of jafri-works and plenty of space. 

The stuff were attentive, prompt and always ready to serve. Ambiance was very peaceful but a little embarrassing too. Because they don't play any music and when you talk you feel like everyone hears. 

Food was nice, they served in a short while after ordering (I'll consider it a plus point for people in 
hurry). We ordered Crispy chilly baby corn, Mix tandoori platter, Kashmiri pulao, Mix veg butter masala and fruit punch (mock-tail). 

Crispy chilly baby-corn and kashmiri pulao was very good. Tandoori platter contains tandoori aloo, tandoori gobi, tandoori paneer and Hara-vara tikka. Tandoori aloo and tandoori gobi was amazing and the rest was OK but Mix veg butter masala was a bit spicy and rich. The fruit punch was nice and without ice, which  was very appreciable. 

The price is on a higher side though if you are looking for a good restaurant having authentic rajasthani veg dishes, surely can give it a try. And I'll try some Chinese dishes (yes, also available) next time I come here.

Located adjacent to the patrol pump at Sector 2, Haveli is an all vegetarian restaurant serving Indian and Chinese cuisines. The interior would be the first thing to catch your eyes as it certainly defines it's name and looks more or less like sort of a royal dining hall.

The food is well prepared and the options are nice. I liked the prompt service and didn't ming shedding the cash cause it's justifiable for the place in terms of all the aspects combined.

Although I'm a hard core non-vegetarian, I'd still like to visit the place from time to time. A place focused on it's cuisines always tend to serve something better than the others.

Loved the interiors and the cleanliness with which the hotel is maintained. Food was tasty. I had a Baby Corn Manchurian Chilly (ask for extra spicy. Worth it. ?) and Mongolian sizzler. Manchurian tasted the best. 

Highly recommended!! GO FOR IT.

Did not have a great experience when had dinner few days ago. Ordered sizzler to start off but it was not up to the mark, poor taste too and most importantly did not had sizzling sound.
Ordered starters (Chinese) which were still good. But again was let down by main course. Not hot and fresh Breads along with ordinary dal and so so sides did not help the cause.
And all this at a very high price made it sure this will be only visit. Avoid if possible

On one of those slow days when I had did not have any appetite for Non-Veg I visited this place, the ambiance will rock you, its great the interior is great, then then again the price on the menu will also rock you at the same time. 
Anyways, this place has a good variety of dishes, the staff is good and the serving does not take a lot of time. 
Honestly, the food is average, a few dishes are mind blowing but some of them which i ordered had a bitter taste, i did not order Karela so i was wondering what went wrong, may be too much of Methi.
Overall this place is a good getaway on days when you feel lazy.

Have to go back as there was no reservation so best starters (ANITA)  have multi dishes as starters pannier ones are totally cool .. Vegetable subz biriyani  veg was too good , palak pannier , chilli pannier was too good too.. Also chilli pannier .... Oh soups cream of tomato & mancho are filling... Totally VERY VERY good place for veggies... Forgot to mention u will also get Jain food without garlic & ginger

Have been visiting this restaurant for years now. Good ambience, cordial staff, Good food. Rates are fair too. Simply great for a pure vegetarian restaurant. If you Want to have a simple casual dinner with family and have a good time you should go here and if you are residing in saltlake and are a pure vegetarian, its a Win win! :D 
Oh well, you can always indulge for some Kulfi n Paan outside the restaurant :')

Too costly, but not worthwhile, don't go for this veggies, unless u r ready to excessively spend money without satisfaction. Even if u go, don't go for rice items, they are extremely extravagant

OMG!!! That was my reaction when the bill came at this restaurant. Being a complete foodie and a non vegetarian i really had my heart in my mouth when i looked at the bill. I do not propagate on spending so much on vegetarian food as i feel the foodie in me feels cheated :p Jokes apart this is a theme restaurant which has a good ambiance and very cordial staff who makes you feel comfortable. The Mango panna was good. Then we ordered yellow daal, paneer item, dum aloo Pulao and rotis. The food was good but nothing to go helluva about.

I visited this place twice. First time the food was really great. Specially the  vegetable corn kebabs. Main course was also good. 
I was quite happy with the ambience but the service was not good.
The next time i went there,  food was a total disappointment. We had ordered Chinese sizzlers which was tasting good but then the waiter recommended Veg. Sizzler  and honestly it tasted worst. The gatte ki sabji to be eaten with garlic naan  was recommeneded by the waiters as their specilaity, but i found it a total disaster as it was too dry and even when we were three people we could not finish even half of that sabji. The mushroom  masala had a lot of spices which was making it taste terrible.
Overall it is a good place for vegetarians . The decors and interiors are amazing along with the kebabs.
Worth trying once!!

I have eaten only once here and this review is based on that ancient memory:

There are a few reasons why I have never come back: 

1.) PURE VEG 
2.) Very costly (Im talking ten years earlier here)
3.) Excessive amount of salt n the food, esp the daal.

So, me and my parents never bothered to return and eat here again. Decor IS GREAT but! I guess if I am in the mood I will try it again. First impressions may be wrong in some cases.

Food at Haveli is good. The service and the etiquette of quite a few of the waiters need a good grooming. The food ordered was kulcha, roti, sabz harabhara and veg zhal frezi. The food was ordered at 09:36p.m. and served at 10:12p.m. so you can well calculate the waiting time. After serving the waiter while serving water poured drops of water in sabz harabhara. On asking for the manager the response of the waiter was just too casual. And the dress up of the waiters was like sitting in the park thing.
Overall the food is good but services suck big time.

Visited the restaurant on two occasions. 
The ambience is traditional, as the name suggests, and it's beautiful. 
Coming to the staff and food. The staff is certainly not the most courteous of all. The service is horribly poor. Our order was taken by a person, who supposedly went to have his dinner after taking the order, without informing another waiter. After a long wait, when I went onto ask another waiter, he in reply asked me, " have you placed the order?".
Disappointed. 
All the above happened on my 2nd visit, the first time food was good but the 2nd tym food was also terrible. 

Conclusion: Good for a family dinner on a weekday, but weekends, I doubt!:(

Valet available, pure vegetarian, bar on a different floor

Every thing was good in the restaurant. The only reason I have rated 1.5 is due to the air-condition. All of us were sweating profusely. On complaining the manager says " Sir, Aap Logon Ko Garmi Jyada Lagti Hai". The manager here doesn't deserve to working here. Very indecent and unprofessional approach.

One of the better places in Kolkata to have pure veg food. (Y)

Edit: It was the 6th or the 7th time I visited this place today and the food wasn't upto the mark. Also please check the bill. We were about to be overcharged by about Rs.200. Same incident took place a couple of days back as well. I'm assuming its not deliberate and the management should be more careful henceforth!

Nope.. not worth it. The prices are high compared to the quality and quantity.. 
The service is not on par with the level they try to be..  the temp. Inside was very warm and sweaty... after repetitively asking the waiter we had no response. Two tables beside us decided to leave for the same reason. The silverware and the waitering service is not satisfactory. The waiters are unaware of the menu. All in all an unsatisfactory experience . I am not going there again. Would choose buzz,the gateway hotel Which is near my place any day above that.

Visted the hotel today and ordered fried rice and mancurian the service was pathetic.on getting the food the food was salt less. On request they told will replace your order but never did that and bought the same food again. When I asked the manager he Told that some time in home also this happens and we adjust this by adding salt on it. Thanks for the argument sir. But when people pay you 5 times more than a general restaurant they expect the same from you. Never the less they took the whole amount from me. Thank god it was only Rs 454. Think twice before visiting this hotel.

-------------
FOOD 
1) Tomato Shorba - was served hot and tasted good .
2) Crispy chilly babycorn - It was really good and the presentation was also done well.

4) Panner Chatpata - Tasted good and the panner was cooked well. 
5) Dal-E-Haveli - It tasted really good and was served hot . 
6) Tandoor roti and Butter Naan - the roti was served cold and didn't have the crisp , naan was fine .

This seems to be my day to write about Vegetarian Restaurants ... this is a place I have visited fairly regularly over the years since a very close friends parents were vegetarian birthdays and anniversary's would be celebrated here regularly. At times they tend to be a bit generous on the spice and oil content so its better to give them a heads upon that front with your order. For starters the Dahi Jeera Kebab and Paneer Seekh Kebab are quite nice. Its better to stick to the basics so if we are eating Indian the Paneer Kulcha , Dal -e Haveli , Paneer Bharta or Paneer Tikka Masala are good options. From the Chinese Section Schezwan Fried Rice , Veg Hakka Noodles , Chilly Potato or Paneer and Veg Manchurian are decent enough. We usually end our meal with a Gundi Paan from the Paanwala who sits outside.

There are quite a few families in Kolkata who prefer going to pure vegetarian restaurants. Alongside, they also expect the provision of few dishes, that contain no onion and garlic. Haveli is catering to this specific requirement from quite some time. And thus, it has its own share of loyalists. Also, it provides some specific Rajasthani dishes.

We have been to this outlet at long gaps and our dining experience has been rather inconsistent. During the recent visit, we ordered Paneer Pasanda, which was well cooked, and Masala Mushroom, which was very spicy and oily. The taste of mushroom was totally lost in the preparation! Breads were Ok. 

It is a 52 seater restaurant with woodwork interior on the lines of that of a ‘Haveli’ (as per its name). Décor is decent and so is the hospitality. There is enough space around. So, car parking is not a problem as well.

This restaurant serves pure vegetarian food & has a restricted multicuisine menu to offer.While entering you are greeted by a doorman dressed in  an attactive attire &  you feel you are entering the Haveli through its big & ornamental wooden door!The interior gives you a feeling in sync with its name.The courses in the menu is very well termed & appealing.I found the place pretty good & I must say that the items I tried were really good & tasty!Normally I am a strict non-vegetarian & avoid spending money on vegetarin food, but on this rare occasion that I felt like trying out the place, it wasn't disappointing at all! I ordered for Bharwan Aloo ,Tomato Shorba & followed it up with Veg Jhal Frezi , Butter Nan , Kadhi & Jeera Rice.I avoided sweets as I decided to finish off with the Kulfi which sells just next to the Petrol Pump , adjacent to the Restaurant!
The food was really nice but the price a little on the higher side.On the whole it was a pleasant experience.

P.S:There is a shop outside this restaurant which sells awesome pan & aa well as  Masala Drink (soda with chatmasala & something else) which is great!

One of the few places in Salt Lake which has decent North Indian/Rajasthani food. While purists may disagree, I quite enjoyed the food served here simply because there is a lack of good eateries in Salt Lake.

This is a place for Pure Vegetarians only. 

My typical favorites would be Mangodi, Gatte ki Sabzi, Various Nans. Generally well made but on the blander side.

Service is a bit slow but staff is very polite. Dinner for two usually costs around 1000/-

PS: Stick to Rajasthani cuisine.

We visited Haveli for lunch today and was kind of disappointed with the ambience. It was crowded and there was too much noise and chatters. Maybe weekdays should be avoided and left for the kitty party ladies! Now coming to the food.. The menu is extensive. We ordered dal makhni which was more  on the side of a dal tadka it totally lacked the creaminess of a good dal makhni. The paneer makhanwala and methi matar malai were ok but the portions less compared to the prices.

My first experience at Haveli was bad, as the food was nothing less than burnt and a disaster. Over the years, however, they had dramatically improved themselves and I actually had begun enjoying the Indian meals, be it in the restaurant or in its buffets. 

However, not very recently, the sense of dejà vu again creeped back when they served ridiculously spicy rice from its Chinese menu and the other vegetables reeked of oil and spice. They seriously need to retrain their chefs and cooks to provide GOOD customized food; despite repeated reminders that we wanted our orders to be less spicy, they apparently didn't give a damn and served us their usual bowl of tear-jerking masaledaar food.

One advice: Just lower down your oil and spice consumption, and you'll be back to the position you deserve!

This is one of the oldest restaurants in salt lake. The food is good, ambiance is okay, service decent. One area where it scores is that it is a pure veg restaurant in salt lake, hence is always crowded. However i think it is a little overpriced compared to the menu and ambiance. However for vegetarian people who avoid onion and garlic this is a good choice.

As far as vegetarian places go (for me, it's a rare occasion indeed if it's a pure veg restaurant I'm trying out), Haveli will not disappoint.
Once again, a Salt Lake eatery, so that's convenience right there for me.
There are two segments, and the ground floor segment is better by far, especially for proper meals. The menu pictures here are NOT of the ground floor segment, which is somewhat pricier than the one shown.
The food quality is good indeed. Few places serving vegetarian have had this much of an impact on me. The veg sizzler is a must-have, and I remember having loved their "gatta pulao" too. 
The ambience is charming, with a typical Rajasthani feel in the air, and the waiters are extremely polite (although the service had been a little slow). 
A good experience, and one I'll certainly be repeating on another rare occasion I feel like having veg.

Having experienced this more than once, so wanted to share it. Food quality is very poor. We had again taken parcels of Veg Biriyani on 27/07/12 but the stuff was extremely Oily, and over and above it, the Biriyani tasted to have sand as you chew it. Wonder what is the sense of their hygiene as if whatever they will serve us we have to take it. Strictly a no-no for us.
