Nice bar with glass windows gives a rooftop feeling. Prompt service.
Pricing is reasonable overall a nice place if someone wants to spend some time over a couple of drinks.

We visited this place yesterday. We were two couple. Before I visited i checked the price online in zomato. Later on I found that price isn't same infact they said Carlsberg strong costs 235/- wherein we were charged 290/-each bottle and 310/-each for Carlsberg premium. My question is why the menu card uploaded in zomato shows wrong price. It's a big inconvenience for people who follow this

visited on nabami and was seated at their banquet with zero decoration and ambience.... the songs played were of low grade like a durga puja bhasan.... the place was virtually empty... cutleries were dirty which were replaced on request.... food arrived which was too salty.... but otherwise ok in taste.... pretty forgettable experience overall....

Went to the bar. Right on top floor,a small decorated with bar sitting arrangement. Has got a smoking room.. Has a view right out the window. Loved it for casual drinking. Unfortunately only one variety of beer, Tuborg.

This area lacks a decent restro bar and Szafran makes up for it. The bar section is good with a good view of extended Kolkata through the glass windows. Service is slow, but then again most of the folks who come here, mainly look forward to spending some time over a couple of drinks and snacks. An added advantage is the fairly economical prices. Food is decent... you will be disappointed if you keep big expectations. It is fairly standard, nothing much to harp about.

The place is near the Avishikta more. Went there last night,it was our first visit there. The place is good,we ordered some drinks,veg panfried noodles-it was full with vegetables, tasted really good,but the quantity was not that much,and hot garlic chicken,it was good,but didn't have that garlic flavour, it had lots of capsicums,quite good. But two main problems were-the service was very slow, and there were two many mosquitoes, they were drinking us more than what we were drinking and eating there,hihi,I have never seen a air-conditioned place with that much mosquitoes.

Good place.
Bar on top offers a great view. Food is served in the bar.
Food took a long time to come and I had to rush to the bar counter for ice and peanuts whenever we needed a top-up. The bar just had a bartender and no waiters. 
One can smoke just out of the bar near the service elevator through which food is brought by waiters from the kitchen which is down below.
Food was ok, not anything special,
But we had a great time.

This place is one of the most visited places mainly due to the bar. There is seriously a lack of good bar cum restaurant on Prince Anwar Shah connector. They have a family restaurant on the second floor which is available only during the evening time. There is a lift which can take you up to the second floor and then you have to take the stairs to reach the roof top bar. The place is small but nicely decorated and clean. 
Coming to the food, the starters are not bad. One of my favorite is barbecue fish. Coming w
to the main course, their Chinese items are not worth mentioning. We ordered mixed gravy chow and chilly chicken which tasted very ordinary. Same goes with their north Indian dishes though I liked their mutton roganjosh. 
But their continental dishes are mind blowing. From fish florentine to chicken steak, they prepare it like a pro. I am absolutely mesmerized. I am going to stick to their oriental menu from now on. 
Best of luck.

That is so not upto the mark. I have visited so many places but the service is the worst over here. Would advice to avoid this place.

Heard about this place from one of my friends, who loved the food out here. So decided to try it out. Located in Kalikapur, you won't have any trouble finding this place. Went there for lunch, it was actually pretty late, around 3pm. And the restaurant was almost empty. The tables were all blocked as they had kept the dirty cutlery etc. Somehow we got a table. And what a horrific experience I had. Rats were moving around. All over the plates etc. I was totally disgusted. Never going back there ever again. It's a shame if such is the standard followed in restaurants.

I had seen this place ..quite a few times on the way to bypass..only once did I stop by as of now...we went to the top floor which is the bar section and it has large glass windows all over ..so you can get a view of partial Kolkata quite well from there...This particular bar section has a sports bar kind look as they have a TV where we were watching the ongoing cricket match..
The ambiance,staff and food is really good..
The best part about them which we liked is they had HAPPY HOURS even at 8 o clock at night..which is rare in Kolkata where most happy hours last till 7...
We had mostly been there to grab a drink so we just ordered cheese balls and fish florentine...the fish florentine was tooo good..
The price was also absolutely okay..
Will be visiting sometime soon again...

I have been there at least thrice in order to take parcel. The restaurant is not situated in the ground floor, so whenever I approach the place, the security guard asks me where I would like to go. Actually from him I came to know that there is a separate bar unit on the rooftop which I have never visited. On my clarifying I wanted to go to the plain restaurant, he would politely usher me to the lift and would accompany me and help me get down to the required floor. This is something I enjoy and appreciate.
The restaurant is ok in terms of ambience and the staff attentive. I mainly choose Chinese dishes and till date had no scope for complaint.

I never really heard about it before, until come September when I stopped my car on my way back home. I was looking for a nice and cozy place with good food for a reception party. Most marriage halls were booked and hotels nearby was not enough for my guest list of around 140. I met Bikas babu first at the Banquet (the plush hall of Szafran at the ground floor). I liked it readily since it is almost a brand new facility and a perfect fit for 150 guest. Fully air conditioned with 8 nos, 1.5 ton brand new split a.c. for an area of around 4500 sq ft, can take out your sweat in minutes. Booking was smooth with a mere token of 5000 INR only. You can bring your own florist or they can refer their own, you have the flexibility to deal deal with him separately. I took it from their reference and he did a fantastic job at a very competitive rate. Ultimately we had our party over there on 6th December 2015. In the mean time I met Amit Acharya, the proprietor, down to earth yet smart and cordial young man. We opted for Gold Buffet menu and it was an instant hit. The menu is really enough. You cannot taste it all from starter to desert if you are not really starving. Bikas babu the chief Chef has got magic in his hands. The food is more than delicious. The fish fry with tartar sauce is the best fry I ever had, the fish was fresh and sweet, Chicken salad, mutton kasha was perfect. The food was not oily or spicy yet a delicacy. Staffs were cordial and cooperative. I would recommend Szafran to all foodies and party people. Value for money restaurant

Everything else is wrong about the place but the food can cause multiple orgasms.
--

Szafran is an ill-maintained restaurant with shabby interiors and furniture. We were greeted with loud Hindi music of the 50s on Sony Mix on the LCD on the screen. The waiters couldn't have been more obviously suggestive of their disapproval of our presence which contributed, along with other customers, in them working on Diwali. The TV remote was allegedly missing, service was slow, tables not cleared properly and there were no responses to questions asked. There's a 'rooftop' bar on the floor above with no rooftop, where there was no service because alcohol was over for the day.

Not much more could go wrong. But it was Diwali and the watch showed 11.30pm. There wasn't any other option in Kalikapur so we decided to play along like other customers, eat and leave.

Little did we know that we were in for a big surprise! Mushroom, chicken and roti: best food that we had had in a long time. Just the right mix of spices, juicy mushroom and chicken legs simply amazed us. If only the place can renovate and can retain the GOD LEVEL chef, Szafran can be killing it big time!

Rating: 5 for the food. -1.5 for everything else.

Yesterday I thought to take my family for a Sunday Dinner and we chose this restaurant.  We ordered Butter Nan,  Chicken Bharta and Mutton Keema.  I didn't enjoy the food much because the Keema had small bones,  the Nan didn't taste like Nan but it was more like punjaabi butter roti.  They also serve alcohol.  The quality of food is OK.  But the price is on the higher side as per quality and quantity.

This place is near my house and I been here and ordered from here quite a few times. Only writing a review now because the quality has deteriorated  over time.

We ordered naan, Reshmi chicken, veg makhanwala, noodles and Manchurian. The noodles and Manchurian was just about okay. The naan was baaad. The so-rubbery-you-can't-tear-takes-ages-to-chew-rather-not-eat kind of bad. So we were 6 of us and had loads of left over naan that we threw away. The veg makhanwala, once one of our favs coz of the buttery vegetables; didn't taste of anything but oil. The chicken was okay. 

Szafran was always an average restaurant.  Only eat there when you have no other option and would really really really not like to cook.

'Out of the World' is the expression to describe the experience I had here. My experiments  with food have often taken me to weird and the weirdest of places. But this one was on a different scale.
It's got a rooftop bar which isn't open-air. Its enclosed! But that's just one of the most remarkable ideas they have come up with. Food was OK. But we didnot have the luck of tasting much as the waiter was excellent in his customer handling behaviour. We were chatting when suddenly he came and pointed at the salt that was littered on the table. We said we had no idea, we hadn't touched the salt container. He picked it up and discovered it was leaked. He yelled at us for being so ignorant and damaging property. We felt ashamed for being the kind of jerks that we were, spilling salt on tables. I was almost on the verge of scolding myself but the waiter did that for me. We left. We will never have the luck of experiencing the sheer pleasure of dining there with the added feature of an insulting waiter.

Visited Szafran with Family...ambiance nice but service was pathetic they took more than 45 min after starters to serve the main course. Waiters were not rude but at the same time never smiled. The menu is updated in Zomato website. Gravy Chowmein is called Soft Noodles and that tasted good as well. However the soup (Chicken Sweet Corn Soup) we ordered, was too less in quantity, felt cheated but quality was nice.
Well one thing I would like to point out that you have to pay 19% taxes (14.5% VAT+4.94% S.T) over & above the printed menu price and can rightfully get a refund on the taxes since its no where mentioned on the menu card that "Taxes extra, etc." 
Dear Friends, Please Note that this is Illegal!!! The Restaurant /Establishment has to display on the menu or in a prominent place that the their advertised prices are exclusive of all taxes or simply "Taxes extra". Incase it is not mentioned, the customer can rightfully claim refund (I have several times done this & got refund across restaurants in India) & if the restaurant refuses to refund....you can simply present the receipt/bill along with a printout of the menu from Zomato to the consumers forum (Jago Grahak Jago) and claim refund+Compensation.
Please note that some restaurants who do not publish "Taxes extra" cannot charge you extra & it should be considered that the price is all inclusive.

I gave my marriage anniversary party in Szafran banquet on 6th dec 2014. The ambiance was very nice, it was spacious and could accommodate 90- 130 people easily. we have chosen one of their menus and trust me they provided plenty of dishes in starters, main course and dessert. All my guests were too happy with the taste and quality of food  and ambiance. They also have plenty of parking space. Staff were good. The only feedback I want to give about them is their washroom. Washroom was too small and it should have been spotless clean and also it would be better if they remove some furniture from the banquet hall which looks little odd. Rather they should enlarge the toilet which is too small. But the taste and quality of food was simply awesome, serving was done is very nice way. I recommend it.

It was during one family gathering that I had gone to this tiny little place located beside Avishikta Apartments, Kalikapur only to discover horrible food, terrible ambience and horrendous service.
We were a group of 9 and the restaurant being so tiny, it had no seating arrangement for us; so obviously we were separated in two groups. I sat in the table of 5 for almost 15 minutes till a waiter had come to receive our orders. None of the passer by staff had offered water till we had to ask for it. 
Anyhow, we moved on to ordering the food which we had hoped to be good. We ordered Crispy Chilli Baby corn and Chicken Reshmi Kebabs for starters. The baby corn was pretty NON-crispy but the kebab was tender and tasty.
Next we ordered, Chicken Fried Rice and Garlic Chicken. I must say, the rice was just too oily even though it was served in adequate quantity. The garlic chicken was tender but the gravy was too watery. It felt as if friend chicken was dipped in a dilute tomato-garlic sauce and chopped garlic was added on top to live up to the name! The chicken pieces were tender though. 
Also, every time before digging into the (bland) food, we had to wait for around 20-25 mins. 
The experience was pretty horrible for it's price. 
The place deserves a 0 rating any day!

Had once been here long back when the place had recently opened, food and service used to be great then. But in one of my recent visits to this place did observe that the quality of service has degraded and the food is not really up to  the mark.
Would say the place is ok for a few drinks and some finger food.
Not in my recommended list any more.

i have been there with friends quite a few times. locating it is easy - you cross the petrol pump while going towards avishikta crossing, and it's on your left. parking is in front of the restaurant on the main road itself.

i generally visited this restaurant to have nice 'adda' with my friends over a couple of drinks. food is ok, nothing great, nor something is wrong. between kababs and chinese starters, i found the chinese items better in terms of taste. crispy chilli lamb, salt and pepper fish, bbq chicken etc was ok, amount was decent. tried a couple of kebabs but chicken was a bit hard, not spicy as well. bar was stocked well, price was not too high.

staff here is helpful, well behaved, but delays service. interior decor is bright and not interesting.

If you're a student and expensive bars are not your forte, this is the perfect place to go. Decent ambience and cheap alcohol with a yet respectable and safe crowd makes this a very desirable place to grab a beer and hang out with your friends. I'd recommend this place.

Awful place with aweful food. Service is fine..but since the place and food is terrible its not justified to visit it. Plus its overpriced for no rhyme or reason.

Went there on 22-03-2014 and enjoyed the food. We ordered tandoori chicken, chilcken reshmi kebab, nun, kashmiri pulao, chicken butter masala abd schezwan lamb. All the food were tasty although they served little late. The price is reasonable and I recommend this restaurant as a good choice to eat over weekend.

I am a regular visitor to this restaurant for last 2 years. Food used to be tasted better earlier. The quality and quantity is degrading. Although, overall a value for money restaurant.

Just 4 days back I went to Szafran to dine with my wife. We ordered a chicken steak and a chicken tetrazzini. The steak had mushrooms in it. We liked the taste and enjoyed the dinner. But later that night I got sick. I spent the next two days in bed because of stomach infection caused by the mushroom. On the third day I had to be hospitalized. Few hours back I came back home after my treatment and then I decided to report this here. Honestly speaking the food was tasty. But after this experience I will never go back there and I will make sure everyone I know never visit the place. How can they serve such mushrooms???!! Mushroom infection is extremely dangerous and deadly too. My suggestion would be - avoid this place. Thanks

Moderate quality food with extremely ill mannered staff.

I could notice random staff in red uniform signaling at me. I even complained to the person-who-looked-like-manager and he took no action.

We were kept waiting for almost an hour before the starters were brought to our tables. With the starter they informed that biriyani could not be served because we were too early and the time was 2:25 pm
The food was okay but the staff behavior is extremely bad.

Avoid. I wish there was a 0 rating

We enjoyed the grilled lemon fish and shahi tukda very much. Both items here were really made well.

My friend who lives in Kalikapur frequently orders takeout from here.

I stay withing 100 meters of this restaurant since its inception. I have visited this restaurant more than 10 times, from the time it had menu card printed on an A4 sheet to the time it got its menu card binded and menus segmented under categories such as indian,continental, oriental..bla..bla...I have seen the restaurant deteriorate from a good to a below average restaurant. Its worth for money has gone down from 4/5 to 1.
Service - below average.
Food - You wont be able to differentiate between butter nun and papad.
Ambience - does not make any sense when the above pointers go incorrect.
Value for money - average.

I personally love the Chicken Biriyani. At 135+tax, the amount is a bit on the lower scale, but the taste weighs the balance. The Egg-Chicken Roll is quite big for one. The restaurant and the roof-top bar has a nice ambiance. Due to its location, people prefer take-away more than a dine-in.

I took the home delivery. The Tandoori Malai Prawn was real tasty with the smoked flavor, although the size of the prawns were not big. The Murg Szafran was also very good and had all leg pieces which I personally like. Prices are high for the Tandoori Malai Prawn considering the size of the prawns. Overall I am happy with the taste and service.

Really Good food....although the price point is bit on a higher side. Chicken exotica was a nice surprise....assorted kebabs with rice(pulao type).....Kashmiri pulao was also good although meetha atar was a bit on higher side(can bland your taste buds depending upon your taste buds). Crispy Chilli baby corn was ok on the whole. Overall Satisfactory experience. Definitely has a repeat order potential.

Food is Good. But the service is not so good. Ambiance is ok. If you are looking for good food with a moderate price then you can definitely try it.
