Great place for burgers and some munchies on the side. It's a takeaway joint or order in via swiggy.  But it's worth it.  No fuss burgers and good sausages :)

Located deep inside one of the bylanes off the RB Connector at Kasba, this joint isn't one where you should go for a dining experience. Ordering in from here is the safest option. 
What I ordered : Grilled Chicken Burger 
The burger was good at its price, but nothing special to make one take notice. Average , at best.

Burnt and unpalatable. It was so  bad that it was beyond my imagination.i will never opt for it. There was no cheese the Patty was all burnt with no salt.

Ordered for a bacon bob. Found the burger to be very oily. The patty was dripping with oil. . The bun was soft. The French fries were overdone and tasted very bitter. Overall, a very average burger. My quest for the perfect burger in Calcutta seems never ending!

This is love personified. 
Such amazing burgers!! Glad to eat something other than just fried chicken between burger buns!! 

The meat patties are cooked perfectly.  Medium rare!! 
And the spread is so vast!!  Great variety and delicious potato wedges!! 
Just wish you guys were open more often :( 

Great work!!

Zomato says the place opens at 2 PM. Visited today at 3 in the afternoon and found the place closed. We travelled all the way from Saltlake and were very disappointed! It's very unprofessional on their part. They should've changed their timings if that's the case. Even tried calling the number listed twice, no one attended. 

P.S. This is not a food review.

I have had a few of their burgers. I had started with a cheesy slim that I had ordered online and it had arrived within an hour. The quantity and quality both were very satisfying. The patty and quite big and juicy. And the potato wedges and dips just complimented it perfectly. Then I visited the small joint once during September and tried their bacon Bob which as good. But then the next time I went there and ordered a cheesy slim again, apparently there was so sign of cheese. So it was basically a slim Jim but I had paid for cheesy slim, that is 50 bucks extra. And as I had it taken away I really did not have anything to do about it.

Quality and quantity has deteriorated a lot. Not expected from a running fast food counter. Also hospitality is not up to the mark as it was before.

Very nice preparations. All homemade. The dips are nice...also, the patty is sweet!!!!
I went to have pork, but settled with chicken, given they didn't have pork at the moment. Will go again!

If you're nearby you can try once . Place is really bad. But burgers are not that bad . I had grilled chicken burger.  It was good . I don't know why Google shows this place in the top when it comes to burger !! I was expecting a lot better . Anyways , it was good .

The place has no physical outlet and only deliver from kasba. The grilled chicken burger is good and taste better with the sauce and the potato wedges. It is a little overpriced. The problem is thar they have very awkward operating hours.

I had been looking for an affordable place that sells burgers like these and I found one! They took over 2 hours to deliver and that is what cheesed me off. Although it may be nothing as close to the ones from chilli's, then of course it is comparatively cheaper. I must say, that I loved the burger I took which was the oozy suzy.. although the appearance wasn't very appealing, the patty was moist, juicy and filled with delicious cheese that continued oozing out, not to mention that it was massive and so heavy..I wouldn't recommend this for someone who has a small appetite, the regular 1/4 is just right, I could barely finish my 1/2 pound.Although the bacon wasn't fried to a crisp it was thick and wasn't very well cooked. My friend went for the bacon bob burger and she didn't really seem to like it because she said she preferred it more compressed but I loved the patty! We also ordered the morning Joe..which wasn't very well thought of..it was sad because it was a very bad mix of combinations..baked beans,sausages that felt like they were bought from kalmans, a bit of bacon, a patty, a fried egg and 0 cheese on the top..was really disappointed by this and expected better. It tasted rather strange. Also I loved the dip! Which I think was the Californian blush it went amazing with the fries even thought they weren't particularly crispy.

Well this is one such tiny place that you should not go and try to find it. Rather order it on phone. Because they have no board in place or any big name plate. It is like a small shop they have made into a small joint.

Now the main stuff the burger I tried was beef burger with fries and it was totally worth it.

This place is a little far away from the main road in kasba. And frankly if you are a person who loves to visit in classic restaurants then you will not like this joint as the outlook is pretty average. But as they say "looks can be deceptive" this joint is the classic example of the adage. 
The chicken/ham burger which i had yesterday in this joint has left me craving for more. I have tasted burger before in some really well known places and have never liked it and so I had come to a conclusion that maybe i am not a burger person. But last evening's burger from burger you has changed my perception. The bread was fresh , the chicken and bacon were juicy. It was so well prepared that you can actually distinguish their distinct tastes. 
So if you are a person who wants to have a good burger in KOLKATA order a burger from Burger You. You wont be disappointed..

This burger outlet does not serve places very far from its location , but if you can travel or stay close to Kasba Thana, this place is a must try. The shop is inside the narrow lane beside Kasba Thana. The actual shop is very tiny, but the burgers they make are huge! The beef burgers here are served with  French Fries and Mayo , with a juicy beef patty that will surely blow your mind. The Texan burger they serve had deep fried onion rings that could taste a tad too oily for those of you who prefer to avoid more-than-just-crispy objects. The burger however , tasted amazing, and is worth every bite. The prices here are justified , given that they serve some of the most delicious burgers in the city, that too minus taxes ! If you're into burgers , you just can't miss this place .

Rating it 5 stars because of the beef burgers but would like to say that the vegetable burger was stuffed with cabbage and onions and couldn't really digest it. Could have used different veggies like carrots, cauliflower, peas and potatoes as well to enhance the taste. And also, please separate the fries individually in packets and not add them together in one packet.

Aside from the above, the beef burgers were sizeable, delicious and worth it. But please take the feedback for the veg burger and improve the product. Thanks.

I have tasted different burgers few times in last 2 years from this place. However, one incident put me off - I ordered burgers for home delivery. The delivery took a while - I ordered 3 burgers. Unfortunately, the one I ordered for my kid, had an aluminum string in it! Fortunately, my wife saw it and avoided a possible issue later on. I called them to notify about it - but the response was lukewarm 'Oh sorry'!

I would stay away from a place where food is not done right, however amazing the taste might be.

Recomendations for outlet: 
Use Sesame seed burger buns
Use Iceberg lettuce
Make the mayo spicier, it tastes bland and sweet

I think they serve the best burger in town going by their prices. I have had their grilled chicken Burger multiple times and found it the best. The other chicken burgers are good too. What's absolutely worthy of adding on to your palate is the side sauce that they provide you. Lip smacking. Finger licking.

Wanted to try this outlet for a long time due to all the reviews and also it is located in the area of my residence.

Finally,did so on 13th April 2017 and ordered for 3 consecutive days.Beloware my day wise observations:

13th April-Ordered for a Grilled Chicken Burger and they accepted the order though it was 6 minutes past thier closing time.They took more than 45 minutes to deliver and the burger was cold when it arrived.It came along with fries which was barely warm and had turned soggy.The burger was just about okayish in taste with cheese,grilled onions and we had also requested bacon with it.

14th April-Ordered 2 different burgers,that is Thai Me On and Morning Joe.

Thai Me On-It was bland in taste though I requested it not to be spicy but it didn't have any flavour.It also had an over fried egg.

Morning Joe-It seemed to be a breakfast burger with baked beans,bacon,cheese,fried egg,Fries and Chicken.They had run out of bacon so they provided extra chicken.However,the burger was not enjoyable as it had turned soggy due to the baked beans.

Again,both the burgers had arrived cold.Also there was a disparity in the price that was mentioned in the menu and was actually charged.Upon enquiry,the delivery person said that the prices have been revised.

15th April-Went for the repeat order of Grilled Chicken Burger which tasted just about the same.

I wouldn't recommend anyone to try the above.

Grilled chicken burger: 170/- juicy tender. Wholesome. The chicken had that smoky aroma in it. It was big enough to fill one.

Morning Joe 220/- this is almost a platter. The beacons were juicy and crispy at the ends. The egg the French fries fill you up. The beef patty was well cooked and very delicious.

I would appreciate if they open up an outlet with good amount of seating arrangement.

A proper burger lover in the city will already be knowing about the reputation of this place . Being tagged as the place with the best burger in town and also putting its name in the hidden gems list , this establishment has already garnered quite some healthy attention. It was on my list for a long time but being a delivery only outlet i somehow never quite managed to experience their offering . But , recently when me and my office colleagues decided to indulge in a burger party we thought of ordering from this joint . And, after we had their burgers we have come to a conclusion that yes their burgers are different and something that needs to be tried but it may not everyone's "cup of tea " or not every burger can be a good idea to order .

° Delivery & Service ( 3 / 5 ) :-  Okay , so if you are someone from it sector and you are ordering to be delivered in salt lake ( sector 5 ) , you need to order atleast 9 to 10 burgers which is quite legit considering the outlet being located at Kasba . But , what displeased me was the fact that the menu in Zomato is old and the variety of burger offering was very very less . In chicken they had only the grilled ND no BBQ or Thai me on . In pork they did not have the pulled pork which was my actual intention to order . They estimated that the delivery time will be an hour and 10 minutes which ultimately went to an hour and 30 minutes for 9 burgers that we ordered . The packaging was quite good where the burgers were wrapped in aluminum foils and the fries and sauces were provided separately .

------------------------------------------

° Burgers :- Now let's get straight to the point where we examine their burgers .

1. Grilled chicken burger ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- I personally didn't have this item but I just grabbed a bite and it was good but not certainly the best burger I have had . Some people who are not quite the proper burger lovers were claiming that a zinger burger was way better , although I don't agree to them but I felt it was not better than the burger I had in " that food truck " in sector 5 . The party was nice and the added sheets of chicken provided a good texture to it . Went well with the fries and dip and is a good try .

2. Veg burger ( 1 / 5 ) :- Our biggest mistake . Although I was sceptical before ordering , my fear was proven right as the burger was a disaster . The main issue with the burger was the inedible patty . In the menu it is written that mixed veg and potato is mixed to make a delicious patty but trust me there was absolutely nothing delicious about it . My veg friends were in a soup as to how they will finish it . Most of them deserted the party and just ate the bread . When I tasted the patty from them I felt that it was indeed inedible . I request the owner to revisit the   preparation and improve the burger . 

3. The texan ( beef burger ) ( 4 / 5 ) :- And being a burger lover i didn't go for chicken and veg and went for the biggie . And my choice did full justice to me . It was a proper burger in exact words .And this time the patty was absolutely spot on . Although the onion rings which actually increased the size of the burger was not good at all . Because the onions were too thin cut to be inside a fried ring . And moreover the rings were slightly burnt which made it quite difficult to consume.  But barring the rings , the patty was delicious . It was a huge patty and only a true beef lover can consume it fully . I am not a huge lover of dip sauce so it hardly mattered to me but the sauce was nice and could go nicely with the burger . The fries which were provided separately were good too . Overall , this is the best burger I have had for a while and since it's a beef patty this is close to the original burger you can have in this town . Highly recommended .

-------------------------------------

° Verdict :- I believe still a long way to prove themselves to be a hidden gem but still their beef burger is something that should be tried by everyone who crave for a good burger and also a lover of beef . They certainly need to work on the variety of burgers served and if they want to truly earn the title of serving the best burger in town they have to make their other burgers better . But , for now it is their beef burger that truly is a crown of their glory .

° Verdict :- I believe still a long way to prove themselves to be a hidden gem but still their beef burger is something that should be tried by everyone who crave for a good burger and also a lover of beef . They certainly need to work on the variety of burgers served and if they want to truly earn the title of serving the best burger in town they have to make their other burgers better . But , for now it is their beef burger that truly is a crown of their glory .

They claim, they have the best burgers in town. Well, i agree! Tried the cheesey slim jim beef & their signature oozey soozey burgers. Amazing burgers, hopefully they'll try to make the patties more juicy. Otherwise great. The wedges and dip that come along are also up to the mark.

Burger You is a small joint located in Kasba. However, I ordered through Swiggy. Tried out the Grilled chicken burger. So delicious! The potato wedges were an added plus - absolutely yummy. However, I received only one packet of that delicious mayo which was too little - left me asking for more 😕

But all in all, Burger you was great! Will absolutely order again 💕

A very small insignificant joint near Picnic Garden. Finding it is a pain, so it's best to follow Google Maps or call them for directions. Coming to the food, they have an amazing menu. So it's tough to decide. We went with the grilled chicken burger with extra bacon. It was the most succulent, juicy, crispy and tasty burger I've ever tasted! Mustard, caramelized onions, a grilled piece of chicken, mayo, cheese and crispy bacon with a side of crispy potato wedges with a mayo dip. One burger cut into halves was enough for two of us for an evening snack. They don't charge taxes and they accept PayTM. Only request to the owners, make its presence felt a little more!

Burger You is a small Burger joint in Kasba and frankly I have never ever been to the eatery myself. But my love for burgers, their mind blowing creations and the proximity to my place all persuades me to order from Burger You. I end up eating from this place at least twice every month. All their burgers come with some potatoes wedges (expect them to be soggy) and a California Blush Dip(it’s thick, it’s creamy, it’s delicious). Expect yourself to be so filled that you may have to skip the next meal.
                                                                ...

Burger You is my cure for untimely munchies. Located near my residence, they serve fresh and filling burgers. The price is justified.
I absolutely love the French fries that come alongside.
The non-vegetarian burgers are very tasty. The best part is, you can add on as many patty, cheese and fried eggs as you want.
(At extra cost of course, but still!)

This place takes a while to deliver. 
The burgers were pretty decent. 
The quinella was okay, too much pork fat.
The Texan burger was far superior. A nice big fat juicy burger. 
One minor problem with the burger was that all the juice made the bun a little soggy.
Other than that it was great.

Like fools we went around looking for the restaurant and ultimately lost hope when we found our car trapped in a shady, narrow lane! Well, all because there is no restaurant! They just deliver the stuff to you! However , the burgers are pretty good! We found the beef a little hard and raw-ish but the chicken patty was tender and juicy ! The dip along with the potato wedges are gorgeous and the entire platter will be enough to fill one's tummy for quite some time! In short, Filling, pocket friendly and yumm!

An amazing place to ease your burger cravings. 
Got home their Thai Me On burger. A solid portion of chicken patty and the poached egg makes it look huge infact. Tastes equally great. 
Plus, it is really very filling. 
It comes with fries and a mayo dip as well. 
Prices totally within budget.

This review is based on the zomato delivery experience yesterday from Burger you .

Delivery was late by 40 minutes . I had to wait outside my office closes for half an hour just to get a burger that i craved for one and half hour ago! Not expected from zomato delivery .

Talking about the TEXAN BEEF BURGER with extra fries and one mayo dip( out of the two that was supposed to come) had a huge minced beef patty , with onion rings and grilled onions , the burger itself was voluminously gigantic , but not worth an experience as the bread and fries became soggy by that time.the potato wedges were over fried and had a burnt flavour which isn't something i prefer. I wish i had it directly from the shop for getting a real value for money.

So, I ordered 2 burgers from this joint... which arrived 1 hr 50 min later (strike 1)
The food was cold ... had reheat to eat (strike 2)
This joint used to make really good fries... nowadays they make soggy unseasoned ones and moreover the quantity has reduced drastically
(Strike 3)
This joint was good at one point of time but apart from their consistent sloppy deliveries... their only weapon-quality has deteriorated as well. So Burger You... I don't know about others but you've lost 1 loyal customer today. 
Kolkata has other places with good burgers now.
P.S. I've come to realise that many of their reviews ( the Good ones) are fake reviews. .. You can make it out.

When we reached near d jahajbari ,we called up at their food station, and they actually picked us up from d road,such a nice gesture.
After reaching there, we ordered 2 morning Joe Burgers with extra bacon add ons.they asked us to wait for 15min .within 15 min they packed two burgers with French fries on sides and mayonnaise dips.when I took d first bite, flavours of meat and eggs and baked beans literally exploded inside my mouth.never tasted such heavenly Burger.d bun was soft ,moist , d patty (we chose beef patty)was heavy,well cooked ,juicy and moist with crisp bacons, fried sunny sideups (eggs),baked beans and cheese.its something that every meat lover desires.d Burger itself is so fulfilling that it's tough for u to finish it in one go and it's so delicious that u can't stop eating.after we finished eating, I had a talk with d man behind this awesome food creation and thanked him personally for making d burger so awesome . definitely worth multiple visits.really a hidden gem in Kolkata's food map.

This place has been in my wishlist for a long time..like real long time.
Finally got the chance of ordering from here and did. Ordered for morning joe chicken, grilled chicken burger and a texan burger.
They delivered the package within time, which was being eagerly anticipated.
Now i am a regular burger hogger, be it from macdonalds, kfc , the joint, chillis or rubys grill.
But for me Burger you till date has been the best. Its a street food burger, the one that they show in eat street of USA. Its lyk a on your face thing!
I had anticipated it to be good but not this good.
Coming to the burgers, i was blown away by the texan. A nicely charred quarter pound beef patty with crispy batter fried onion rings, the inhouse bbq sauce and caramalised onions. It was bliss, with explosion of flavors in ur mouth. The beef patty is a tad bit dry because it is minced meat but the rich bbq sauce kept it moist and it tasted great. Must try
The buns were soft and fresh. Good burger buns.
The Grilled chicken was another good thing. I loved the grilled patty with cheese. Nicely smoked. Loved the succulent taste of the chicken patty. Refreshing to say the least.
Next the morning joe packed in a punch. With beef, pork and chicken option, i chose chicken. It comes with baked beans, a fried egg on top, bacon pieces and then the usual quarter pound patty. It is solid protien and is one of the tastiest burger of the entire lot. All the ingredients go well with each other. Must try.
The sides of mayo and potato wedges were good. The mayo complements the well fried but soggy potatao wedges. The wedges were in good portion(although i craved more) and i would like them to be fresh and a bit more crispy.
Now the pricing is moderate i feel. No taxes charged. And it is something that can be savored. Really good for the prices.
Looking forward to try more.

All delightfully delicious and the perfect meat to bun to condiment ratio, though the burgers can be heavy. The fries used to be really good, however recently quality has gone down since.

This place is a real gem for burger lovers. It's pretty hard to find but they do home deliveries even at pretty long distances. It's not much of a restaurant. It's a garage turned into a kitchen by four odd guys, who look freshly out of college wanting to start a business of their own, and their efforts are very appreciable.
Now cut to the food. Given the small kitchen and new start their food is surprisingly great. The beef they serve is good quality and the bacon is good as well. Their buegers are one of the best you'll find in the city. It's not hard on your wallet either. The pricing is pretty average. The food is great.
Overall I'd say that if you are a burger lover and want a pocket friendly place to eat at. This is your place.
Cheers.

First of all, this place is really hard to find, Google maps might just be your only hope here. Anyways upon reaching the place, it will take you quite some time for actually accepting the fact this garage turned kitchen actually dishes out some of the best burgers Kolkata has to offer.
Pro tip :Bring a car, pack up burgers and have it in your car
Now about the burgers. Really good amount of meat portions. We took the #BaconBob and another pork Burger ( Quinella). French fries/potato wedges were complementary along with a generous mayo dip. The Bacon Bob was really good, lots and lots of meat and bacon strips. I really wanted to have their Pulled Pork burger, but it wasn't available then.

Ordered a Pull Pork burger for home delivery. It was delivered within 20 minutes, was nicely packed and was still hot.
Now, 1 burger is enough to make you full. I just had the fries because I do not have pork. Sadly, the fries were burnt. My friend had the whole thing and she loved it. The filling was mouth watering.
Price: Okay.

If you have ever felt off while having a standard burger in those standard outlets scattered around the town, then mate, you need to discover a new place for burgers. Unequivocally, that place is Burger You.

First things first, finding this place is HARD. There are lanes and by-lanes and possibly by-by-lanes, you get the idea. However, once you find it, all that hard work pays off in an instant.

 I ordered The Texan and a BBQ Chicken Burger. Both the burgers were fabulous with soft buns and tender patties. What more, the burgers are huge. Gulping one gives you immense satisfaction, both literally and figuratively. 

This place is without a doubt the best burger joint in Kolkata. If you haven't tried them yet, don't waste any more time in visiting their heavenly burgers. Seriously.

Burger You. I was interested from the moment I heard the name, add that with the rave reviews on zomato and this became a must try on my list. The only downside for me was the location. It's in the middle of somewhere in kasba and is more like a take away/delivery joint and I prefer sit-ins. Anyway so finally got the chance to have burgers from burger you recently. Location is quite far from the main road. Call the restaurant and the staff will happily tell you how to get there. The wait time was 10 minutes approx. The ambience, there is none. Best take away your food or have it delivered. Coming to the food, we ordered grilled chicken burgers with fries and dips. The burgers were huge and a generous portion of grilled chicken cooked well makes everything better. The fries and dips were also good. I would definitely recommend it if you like burgers and wanna try something other than the regular burger joints. One thing I would change is the location and the get up of the restaurant but I'm sure they'll get there with time. 👍

Ordered from here for the first time today after hearing such good things about the place. Tried the Morning Joe in the All Day Breakfast option. It is basically a burger with a quarter pound patty (chicken/beef/pork) with baked beans, bacon and fried egg, served with fries on the side. The burgur was huge in size and tastes really good !! The fries however were not your typical French fries, looked a little over-fried but tasted good nonetheless. For 220 bucks, it's a great deal :)

My review of Burger You: 
I ordered the grilled chicken burger. Delivery time took 70 minutes even though I stay right near Ruby Hospital. And as for the food, the ratings are as follows.
The Burger: 5/5 Definitely the best grilled chicken burger I have had in my life
The fries: 1/5 Too oily
As for the service, it was good on that day, but Burger You has a real bad habit of sometimes cancelling your online orders due to various reasons like unavailability of food items or due to the fact that there is no one to deliver the food.

Burger you is a small outlet and is pretty cheap. So, in case you have had burgers in Dunkin Donuts or Burger King, don't expect these burgers to look or taste like them. But that can be compromised as food here is super affordable and it is worth the price. Delivery was quite fast but that might be because it's near my place. They should really work on the packaging. The burgers were pretty big with huge chunks of chicken/meat inside. I didn't order the side dishes though. The dips were quite good but I didn't like the potato wedges. I wanted fries but as they were not available here, I finally settled for the wedges but they were soggy and saturated with oil. This place definitely serves good burgers and I shall order again for a quick snack break. But if you are looking for "ah-ma-zinnggg" burgers, this is not the place.

Burger you is manned by a single young man named Mark who's passion for cooking and entrepreneurship is remarkable.

It's been 2 months since he had to leave the place from where Burger you used to operate. So, he shifted everything to his own garage and is dishing out excellent burgers from that small kitchen!

I went to his garage, sat down, tasted 2 burgers and came home a happy man.

Burgers ordered :

• The Texan : Loved it. Humongous in size and flavour. This burger had caramelized onions, gherkins, crispy fried onion rings, 1/4 pound beef patty and mustard. He just puts in salt and pepper in his patty, but the taste is phenomenal! I haven't had such juicy and tasty beef patty ever. Loved this burger!

• The morning Joe : This one was again mind blowing! This one had caramelized onions, gherkins, a fried egg, grilled bacon and 1/4  pound beef patty. This burger was again very tender, juicy and most Importantly freshly prepared in front of me. You hardly get good beef in Kolkata, because maximum places : They serve buff in the name of beef.

Also, each burger was served with a side of fried and mayo. Yes, the fries might seem a little bit too dark but they taste awesome. Doesn't taste like burnt fries at all. 

These burgers are not among the prettiest burgers ever, but certainly are two of the best burgers I've ever eaten. Highly recommended!

Amazing burgers. They are full of meat. Even the fries taste heavenly. It is a frequent takeaway for my friends and me. It would be nice if they open a dine-in.

I can bet those who rated this shop 5 stars.. are either for promotional purpose.. or had previously eaten only at kfc or mcdonalds.. i have eaten burgers from nearly all restaurants which serve american cuisine.. and trust me you don't want this one.. i ordered the bob burger.. it took 1 hour 10 minutes and a few phone calls to deliver them my order.. well that didnt matter. Coz i was in no hurry. But what did matter was the quality of the burger.. FIRST i noticed the fries.. wimpy, no crunch.. literally no seasoning.. and ofcourse dark because.. it is made with nasty old oil.. this my friend causes huge health problems.. now the main thing.. Burger.. huge.. you can relate its size to mc maharaja.. but ofcourse it doesnt have that many flavors.. cold grilled onions.. 50 % of the burger is bread.. not soft, flavored one.. but crumby dry.. coming to the cheese.. its not a savory, liquidy.. but cold and rubbery.. more like in a plasma state.. try the blue cheese.. instead of the cheddar.. damn.. i hate cheddar, more if wrongly utilized.. now the patty.. its clearly processed and overcooked.. which clearly stole the moisture, making it dry and crumby.. it didnt taste bad, but this burger clearly needs a sauce and and pickles.. in the reviews people told this is the best one in the menu.. i will not even dare to try the other ones.. the only good thing was the mayo.. everything else.. bad.. if you are ordering from zomato., i will strongly suggest Bikers cafe instead of this one.. check their menu, burgers costs like 50-60 more but you do get salad as extra as well as mayo and fries.. they are day and night better than this one. And it is likely that they will deliver it.. other alternative is subway.. i will never try this again.. thank you

UPDATE
2ND TRY

This is my second time with this joint. This time, i tried the pork with extra bacons... The patty itself was a lot better. But everything else remains a dis- appointment. They even did not give enough mayo this time. But overall, the experience was a little bit better, but far away from ideal for the amount of money they charge. For a comparison I did a review of another joint namely " Bikers cafe" do watch it and try it.

Burger You does not compromise with quantity. And i can proudly say the same about quality. Love Bacon Bob, Oozy Soozy and grilled chicken burger. And just for 50 more bucks you get two huge chunks of their delicious bacon. Simply love the place

This place is located just near jahaj bari. It is best to get the food delivered.
Coming to the fodd we only ordered the texan. And it did impress me. The burger patty was humongous. It was juicy and tasted fantastic along with the fried onions and dip. However the fries were a big let down and they should look into it. I wish they added cheese as default instead of add ons. I cannot wait to try the other items.

I was hungry AF
Thanks to swiggy team I got the food delivered within 30 minutes.
I ordered Slim Jim Burger with fried eggs.
Meat was great just perfect
Fried egg was salty that's the only negative thing but doesn't matter when you're hungry.
Fries could have been little crispier.
Overall good experience.

I can't wait till they open a dine-in! This is a place pretty hard to locate, but the burgers are worth it. I tried their Grilled Chicken Burger. Beautiful grilled onions and chicken filets with enough sauce in the burger. There is nothing I would change in that burger. The burger was a stunning 10/10.
However, situated in a garage, the joint could afford to rearrange the place and make it look a little more welcoming, keeping in mind their newly gained popularity.
And I was not given their special mayo dip with my potato wedges. I was given ketchup. That was a huge letdown! That's where they missed my perfect 5.0 score. I look forward to trying more burgers and increasing the rating soon! 

This is an edit : I went back there a couple of weeks ago. I asked them specifically if they had given the mayo dip and if not, whether they could. They first said they were out of it, but in a moment asked me to wait a minute and came back with my much wanted mayo dip! So kudos on customer satisfaction! Now all I want is for them to start the dine-in, that's it.

Today i went to Burger You..without gps it can't be located.it has no banner...nothing.it almost looks like a garage. After discovering the place we went in. The kitchen is hiding by a curtain which is also used for wiping hands. The kitchen was so unhygienic. Coming to food. We ordered one grilled chicken burger and one barbeque chicken burger. But the boy said he can provide us only grilled chicken burger as it was their opening time. After 15 mins he gave us two burgers...one is huge and the other one is normal. French fries are over fried. The chicken was not grilled at all.it was shallow fried. I never ate such dry burger before. It was made of only fried onions, chicken and one layer of cheese slice. Such a pathetic experience.

Finally! Was eagerly waiting to gorge on those burger beauties this place makes! We ordered our meals through Zomato and was served a little more than an hour's time! We ordered for Chicken Grilled Burgers and The Texan beef burgers!
The Chicken Grilled Burger was a wholesome delight with chunks of grilled chicken and onions made to perfection but what stole the show was the Texan burger! With that huggeeeee beef patty ( we ordered with extra bacon) combined with crunchy onion rings in between soft burger breads, boyyy! it is definitely the food of ' Man vs Food'! ;-)
Thanks guys for reminding us what burgers actually taste like - for way too long we have eaten bullshit in the name of burgers served by some famous food chains in the city!
My only concern are the french fries which come alongside the burgers. A little less oily maybe eh?

It's been quite some time since we had been planning to order from Burger You, but never really found a chance until today. We ordered for a Chicken Grilled Burger and The Texan Beef Burger. Gariahat crossing was settled on as the pickup location and the food was delivered after around 50 minutes (against the 35 minutes promised by the owners). 

With a bottle of cold drink in hand, we settled down to gorge on the burgers. The buns had lost their firmness due to the moisture collected inside the foil wrapping, which resulted in the overall impression being a bit sloppy. The fries were not perfectly done as well. The perfect bunch of French fries are those which are double fried to a crispy golden yellow outer crust and thoroughly cooked and moist inside. But the ones they served were almost charred and soggy. However, they tasted fine with the spicy mayo dip. 
The cons being listed, now let me explain how good the burgers were. 
My grilled chicken burger had several chunks of the grilled chicken breast with bits of grilled onion mixed with spices, a slice of cheese and some mayo. The strong flavors of the herbs and mustard had overshadowed the effect of cheese and even though the filling felt a bit dry, the taste was pretty good. 
His beef Texan was the winner, hands down. There was a HUGE succulent beef patty inside, dripping with juices and BBQ sauce. The crispy fried onion rings further accentuated it's flavor. 
I loved how they mindfully pick the ingredients so as to bring out the best in each of them. 

Overall, this is an awesome place to order burgers from. The menu is quite extensive when compared to other burger places in the city and their prices being so reasonable is like an extra cherry on the cake! :)

I have never had such burgers ever in my life! A place to die for.. Have a Bacon Bob Burger and you will understand why I say so. My only suggestion would be that they reduce their minimum order to may be 200 or 250 so that Burger fanatics like us can order every other day and have our favourite burgers rather than having to add extra cheese or may be additional unnecessary stuff (Updated Sep 2016 - they have responded and have reduced the bar - thank you so much)! But.. The bottom line is - they are the best burgers in the town!

Well.. heard a lot about this place.. According to some they serve the best burger in town.. bt i must say i was totally disappointed. I ordered the grilled chicken burger. First of all it was delivered 2hrs aftr placing the order. They called me up n sd that chicken was not available so my food wl b delivered late. I was still ok with it. Bt whn the food came the first thing i noticed is that it was cold. The cheese was not melted. There are two pros viz, the burger bun which was fresh n hence soft.. and the amount of chicken which was decent at that price level. The cons are, the taste.. very sweet for me.. they used an ordinary mayo mixed with tomato sauce which made the burger evn more sweeter. The caramelised onion mixed with mustard is a cool idea bt the choice of mustard was wrong, it was very pungent n hence giving the burger a funny smell which is clearly not appetizing at all. The french fries were horrible, greasy, n some of them were even burnt. The dip , which is the same mayo used in the burger was too sweet. Overall, the burger was below average. Though i haven't tried their other burgers (which i doubt i will ) i am totally giving a big thumbs down to Burger You.

I am not a burger fan. I see little novelty in being able to cram a patty between two large buns of bread and add mayo and other sauces to make it a greasy layering. And I have had the (un)fortunate deal of getting to taste a whole different types of burgers - ones with cucumber, ones with tomato, ones with very very deep fried patty, ones with funny looking sauces - so much so that I started hating this staple food of the west.

But things changed with Burger You.

The high ratings on Zomato forced me out of my 'hibur(ger)nation' and I went the Burger You way one weekend. After much deliberation, I mustered the courage to go for their cheese burger with quarter pound patty, a chicken grilled and mushroom burger. The gentleman who took down the order was really upfront, he told me that they aren't serving pork now since there is an issue with the meat quality. I also wished to try their Icarus (Chicken Wings) but my luck had devised other plans. So that gets in to the bucket list. But these burgers came nicely packed in foils, with fries and their special mayo. The cheese burger was huge, so succulent and juicy that you cannot help but praise the meat. The chicken grilled was good too. It is perhaps with the mushroom ones where I would say my experience dented slightly since the patty was a lot of potatoes and very little mushroom. But overall, this is undoubtedly the best burger experience that I have had in this city. Ahead of many multinational food chains. To the guys putting up this show - three cheers and will wait for the day when you open a burger and beer place for all fatso food lovers...:-)

PS: Oh yes. Another request. Can you please bring back the Thai Chicken burger. I do not know how people from this city which loves everything 'jhaal' (hot) could let you drop this from the menu because of a lack of response.

I heard about this place many months before and was quite eager to try their burgers. Finally the day came and i have to say this , they make THE BEST BURGERS!!!! I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and it tasted heavenly. It had 2 big pieces of grilled chicken placed on caramelized onions and was topped with a good amount of cheese and mayo. Along with the burger they also give some fries and mayo dip. All in all it was superb in taste :) will be trying their beef and pork varieties in the next visit ^_^
(Would have rated 5 but as the fries were not so good hence 4.5)

ok.. dinner done... so time for a review ..

orders : A texan , 2 grilled chicken burger and a portion of fries ..

Texan : buns were nice .. caramelised onions ok and the beef patty good and onion rings sub par ..

Beef patty a little more seasoned than it should be onions rings was not requied and caramelise onions shouldn't be finely cut... and an important ingredient missing, the Gherkins for that tangy part ..

Grilled Chicken : buns were nice .. patty is too good but mustard dressing was a little overpowering ..

Fries : bad .. some were totally burnt.. but overall a bit more fried than it should be .

Overall I am disappointed.. still a long way to go Burger you .. the crown for best beef/ buffalo burger still stays with Chillis.. though its double the price of burger  you ..

But a big thums up for being the only place in kol to serve these rustic burgers.
This is India and not US .. so plz dont compare if you have tried the same in US .. But people who like burgers should must try this as it will give these guys more opertunity to evolve and one day be the best burger joint ... BEST OF LUCK GUYS ...

Happy Fooding :)

Well I take my burgers very seriously..A good burger is not too easy to make, u have to choose a good bun,well cooked juicy chicken inside...choosing of right sos of right amount..it takes a lot of efforts. I have heard of this place many times..so gave it a try.A burger costs u around 200,and thats enough for one person really. I wanted to start with chicken burger so ordered their grilled chicken burger and it turned out to the best burger I have ever had.. really. The chicken was well marinantef,juicy inside.grilled smell within..a cheeze on top that was melting.. and the dips were just fingerlicking. I just couldnot stop eating it... so delicious. I hv heard that they make the best beef burgers,with bacon and so..next time thinking of having one. Plz visit if you are a burger lover. 🍔

A fact which needs to be brought to the attention of everyone is Burger You has shifted from its old location and hence one may be misled if he/she tries to go there using Google Maps since the change hasn't been reflected there, something which happened with me and caused me a bit of a strife. It is now located opposite to the Jahaz Bari where they are trying to set up the kitchen along with a few accommodation. Now, coming to the food, it was tasty. The Slim Trim Beef Burger was delicious and the Pull Pork Burger was above moderate. If you love burgers, give this a shot!

This is one of those hidden gems that most people are yet to find out about. Lemme start with the negatives. Most of the times, only a limited type of burgers are available and delivery can be super slow. But I am willing to ignore this completely as the wait is worth it.I have ordered twice from this place and it blows me every time. I have had the Cheesy Slim Burger, Bacon Bob Burger and Quinella Burger. And all of them were so very delicious. The meat is tender and juicy and the cheese makes it heavenly. They come with fries and a dip. It is probably the best burger I have had.I want to try their pulled pork burger soon.

Edit:
Had the Pulled Pork Burger and Texan Beef Burger. The pulled pork burger was tasty but the burger becomes moist. I don't like moist burgers. It ruins the taste. The Texan beef burger was another marvel. 
Overall, the beef burgers here are better than the the pork and the burgers here are better than most in the city.

I had been dying to eat here ever since I heard about them months back. They've recently relocated, so finding the place according to zomato directions took a lot of time. We had to call them and found the nondescript garage with no signboard. The burgers were delicious served with deep fried French fries and mayo dip. We had to wait about 20-30mins for them though. We had the grilled chicken burger and The Texan beef burger. They were out of stock with the pork ones. The grilled chicken one had a thick patty,decent amount of mayo and mustard. I loved the Texan. It had onion rings with bacon and a fat beef patty , with bbq sauce. I shall go back soon to have to other ones on the menu. Specially the more expensive Oozy Suzy.

So, I've been waiting to try out there delicacies for quite a while now and very recently I got to feast on the Bacon Bob and also the Slim Jim. Firstly, that patty was beautiful. Every single bite of it was foodgasmic. Loved the fries and that dip is simply finger-licking good. Probably the best buger I've had so far in Kolkata. Looking forward to trying out the Oozy Soozy.

Locating this place was really difficult for me to be honest. Google Map was my saviour at the end of the day. I kept on driving here and there suddenly I see State Bank Of India and I asked the people where is Burger You most of them had no clue whatsoever.
Finally one rickshaw puller guy told me to take the left lane and you'll see a black gate and voila! got the place. It is a home kitchen I thought it was a restaurant or something like that and then I placed my order Slim Jim Beef Burger and Grilled Chicken Burger he told me to come back after 15 minutes and then we took the food.
We sat in our car and unwrapped it and started munching on the burgers I swear it tasted really really good , yummy , delicious everything was perfect about the burgers.
Gonna order them again.
Kudos to the Burger You team.

Perfect amounts of everything, and the patty is really well made. The bacon just makes everything even better. I cannot stop raving about this place. Must-eat, definitely.

I had heard about Burger You for a long long time as a lot of my customers told me they are my direct competition as far as burgers are concerned. Finally I got to have their burgers yesterday when I was visiting a friend's place. We ordered the Texan, slim Jim and the bacon burger. And I happily admit that indeed they are my competition. Even the tenderloin patty in chilli's (medium rare) fails to compete with their b€£f patty, which was juicy and rightly flavored. The fried onions add a great touch to beef burgers. The only downside were the wedges which were leaving a slight burnt after taste, which could be ignored if you dip them in the sauce provided. Patrick was a pleasure to talk to and took as well as delivered the food promptly. Now they will be my regular red meat burger place.

We came to know of this place from zomato itself.Seeing the great reviews we decided to order in.They were quite reluctant to deliver to our place,near ravindra sarovar, but agreed after a bit of pursuation,and also coz our order was beyond Rs 800/-.
We ordered three type of burgers from this place,The beef texan,grilled chicken,and pork quinella.They wanted us to take morning Joe instead of quinella as they did not have enough roquet,but we were not too keen on having beans in a burger so stuck to quinella.

We ordered around 5pm and wanted it to be delivered at 8.30.the order was delivered at 9.The delivery person,nor the owners called us up to inform of this delay.We had to call them and enquire,and even then the reply was that he had gone out long time back.It was kind of unprofessional.0.5 deducted for that.
The burgers were very filling.One would be sufficient as dinner for a light to average eater.
the Texan was the best of the lot.the sauce,the onion rings complemented perfectly with the patty. 5/5 

The chicken burgers were great as well.a chicken breast marinated with a sauce that perfectly complemented it.4/5

the pork burger was very dissappointing.the meat was bland,underseasoned.No added sauce/flavouring was used and it tasted like boiled meat with bread and butter.It was described in the menu that it would have blue cheese sauce.we could taste no such thing. 2/5
The potato wedges were good and crisp,though we would have liked some more of them.The dip was nothing great and didnot do anything to enhance the flavours.

I would have rated them higher if they had a smoother delivery system.Since they do not have dine in,nor located very centrally,the delivery mechanism should be much more systematic and professional to sustain in business.Also,took away points  for the pork burger.

Will I try them again?Yes,but only for their beef burgers

This place is much hyped.. Went there with great expectations. 
1. It's difficult to find this place. No sign board . It's a old shabby house from outside.
2. They don't have menu to see and order 
3. No choice was there. Had to take roasted chicken burger as this was only there and my fiend took pork burger
4. Chi burger was average taste but not hot.and we ate immediately outside the place.
5. Pork burger which had minced patty . Twice bone came in his mouth.
6. Fries given were 20% burnt.
7. My brother had asked me to pack one burger for him but I didn't as it was nothing great.
I would not go again

I've only eaten at their outlets at Nh7 and I usually land up spending half my coupon on them. I really enjoy eating the food but my suggestion is --  guys you need to strike a balance between serving quick and serving hot. Coz  both seasons at nh7 either one was missing. No need to work on the flavours it's already there

A friend suggested this place and a sudden plan to satisfy my hunger landed me here. To start with i must tell you that this outlet remains closed on tuesday's but since me and a few friends ended up there, they entertained us even on a day their kitchen was supposed to closed. That is the impact they made even before we ordered. The location is a disadvantage though as it is located deep inside the lane beside Kasba Police Station and at the same time there is no proper place to sit or infact even a counter as they serve from the kitchen inside their house. Hence i would recommend this place only for home deliveries. I ordered for a Grilled Chicken burger which came with fries. The Burger was simply yummy with two proper sized patty inside along with fried onions and a slice of cheese and lots of sauce. It tasted absolutely amazing and at the same time the combination of the filling made it perfect to satisfy an average person's apetite. Add to this, their fries or rather potato wedges were among the best i had till date. The amazing food combined with their top notch customer service makes this place a must for every foodie

I dont even know where this place is exactly, or if they even have a joint. All I know is that, there a magical place which makes badass burgers begging to be eaten, somewhere near Kasba. Their buns are soft and well toasted, their patty is juicy and filled with flavour, their dressing and relish is worth being relished. Their fries, well, are.. err.. fries, and their add-ons are simply scintillating. Whether it's the bacon strips or fried egg or baked beans, or all of them. They do it right. This is my favorite burger joint in the city. This could easily become the burger place the You fall in love with. You can't go wrong. Kudos to You, Burger You! You guys rule!

Swiggy wasn't available, so got a home delivery from the restaurant itself. Ordered two Grilled Chicken Burgers and a Pulled Pork Burger. It was delivered within one hour. First of all the burgers are amazing. I also liked the French Fries and the Dip. The pricing is also cheap. The only downside is probably the amount of the French Fries given with the burgers. We want more. :P 
Anyway, good place to have burgers. Have to try the other varieties.

This place is a little difficult to find unless you know exactly what you're looking for. It's an old house, without any signboards or anything, only serving take outs and home deliveries. They prefer it if you call ahead with your order so they can have it ready for you by the time you reach.We ordered a Cheesy Slim and a Quinella. The only problem here is that a lot of the options on the menu aren't always available. But it's not a big deal since almost everything on the menu looks good. Coming to the Cheesy Slim. The beef was tender and incredible to taste. The only thing I was worried about was how hard it would be. But it turned out to be brilliant. That, along with the fact that they don't skimp on meat. The Quinella had a brilliant smoky flavour to the pork. It was oozing cheese all around the sides. The burgers were large, stuffed with meat, the cheese was brilliant and it was served with potato wedges and dip (which was also amazing).These were easily the best burgers I've had in this city. Miles ahead of any competition. At seen to be believed prices.

The ultimate burger menu. 

I have had the Bacon Bob (with extra bacon),  Quinella, Cheesy Slim Jim (with extra bacon) and The Texan, so far. 

Although I have to place an order of around 500 for them to deliver to my place (which is a little far, all the way in Shakespeare Sarani), they take around 40-50 minutes to deliver, and I am beyond happy with the burgers. 

The burgers are loaded with just enough cheese, so as to not overpower the taste of the patty, and the patty, as well as the bacon, was tender and juicy, prepared to perfection. The fries aren't particularly special, they taste simple and homecooked, but it's the burgers you're paying for, and that they'll deliver. The ranch dip is a delight. 

The meat in Quinella seemed a tad bit undercooked because I came across parts of the meat that were too rubbery to chew (twice), but the taste of the burger itself (especially the blue cheese) is the real winner here and enough to pardon this inconvenience. 

The burgers are an absolute steal for its price. 

Best burgers in town, indeed.

It's been on my bookmark list for a long time and it was high time I tried the food here. Got a chance when I was near Kasba . I initially opted for delivery  service. However as the delivery guy was unavailable, I settled for a take away. Coming to the burgers, they are absolutely delightful and give a home made feel. The burger bun was soft and the chicken patty was well cooked .Am not a big fan of beef and pork, so I ordered the grilled chicken burger and it was served with fries and gravy. Neat packaging and prompt service. If u are a fan of burgers, do yourself  a favour, just dial their number.

The best beef burger in town because of the flavour of the patty combined with the onions in bbq sauce and just the meat tasting so natural and virgin. Its a must try.

Paisa wasool deal.. Foodies should definitely try it.. Won't regret

This place is a little difficult to find unless you know exactly what you're looking for. It's an old house, without any signboards or anything, only serving take outs and home deliveries. They prefer it if you call ahead with your order so they can have it ready for you by the time you reach.We ordered a Cheesy Slim and a Quinella. The only problem here is that a lot of the options on the menu aren't always available. But it's not a big deal since almost everything on the menu looks good. Coming to the Cheesy Slim. The beef was tender and incredible to taste. The only thing I was worried about was how hard it would be. But it turned out to be brilliant. That, along with the fact that they don't skimp on meat. The Quinella had a brilliant smoky flavour to the pork. It was oozing cheese all around the sides. The burgers were large, stuffed with meat, the cheese was brilliant and it was served with potato wedges and dip (which was also amazing).These were easily the best burgers I've had in this city. Miles ahead of any competition. At seen to be believed prices.

The ultimate burger menu. 

I have had the Bacon Bob (with extra bacon),  Quinella, Cheesy Slim Jim (with extra bacon) and The Texan, so far. 

Although I have to place an order of around 500 for them to deliver to my place (which is a little far, all the way in Shakespeare Sarani), they take around 40-50 minutes to deliver, and I am beyond happy with the burgers.

Was excited about ordering from here because of its popularity on Zomato.  Took me two days of struggle to order from here due to the unavailability of the delivery person and then the unavailability of the meats in the kitchen. To be really honest, it wasn't worth the struggle and is quite overrated. 

Ordered the Grilled Chicken Burger and the Morning Joe in Chicken as no other meat was available. There was barely any mustard in the Grilled Chicken Burger and there were NO BEANS in the Morning Joe. 

The fries were average though the dip was nice. 

Overall, it was a mediocre experience at best. Probably won't order again.

We've had a few orders from this place so far and I have to say their burgers are very tasty and a generous size. The chips were rustic, homemade and well seasoned. The Texan was delicious with onion rings and bbq sauce, the cheesy slim was simple but done well and the grilled chicken was again simple, but so tasty and the chicken was succulent! The magic mushroom was more like a potato pattie, with not many mushrooms. Slightly disappointed but very filling. Overall, I'm very satisfied with Burger You, prices are very reasonable. One suggestion would be to consider putting burgers in a box rather than wrapping it in tin foil as they get very squished! The Burgers are usually cold when they get to us so I don't reckon the tinfoil doesn't make much of a difference. We would usually reheat it in the microwave.

Normally, when rating a food joint on Zomato, one needs to take all factors into consideration.. For a home delivery only joint, some importance is given to packaging, delivery time etc.. The 5 rating that I am giving Burger You, is based only on the most important aspect of a food joint.. namely.. FOOD !!! Who cares about branding or packaging, if the food is so amazing !! Had the Beef Burger with Bacon and Cheese. I have to say that this is one of the best burgers I have eaten till date (and I take my burgers very seriously). A good burger is not easy to make..  From choosing the right bun, to marination of the meat, to cooking the meat to perfection, and then using a perfect balance of Bacon and Cheese to ensure no one flavour over shadows the other, is an art.. Take a bow team BURGER YOU !!! You have created a product truly to be proud of.

the best burgers in town!! & by a long way!! (Rubi's Grill, Chili's, and others come after this...) Run by Mark with assistance from his mom and friends, this is a 'only delivery' joint. Have placed orders from here at work and at home many times.. also had their burgers in a private party and at NH7.. They even had a 'Friday special' stall in our office! Till date, Bacon Bob just stands out for me!! hardly ordered or tasted anything else..perfectly pounded beef patty in a bun with bacon and cheese on top along with iceberg lettuce and some veggies! delight in every bite! the ranch sauce they serve along is fab as well! I highly recommend for all meat lovers and burger enthusiasts to give this a shot! You won't regret it all!

Thanks to Swiggy. I regularly get their burgers delivered. I love their grilled chicken burger. What is different about them is their sauce which is heavenly but not enough, I feel and their french fries. For the quantity and price paid, it's worth it. I didn't like their beek burger personally but shall try their items too soon

Burger You supercedes it's name and it does many more than just satisfying your palate.

I ordered delivery few times from their shops and one thing I have noted which is completely absent in big corporate burger joints in our country, the original concept of the burger as invented by Americans, i.e. a burger is all about a simple patty of meat with very little cheese and a pair of bun over it. Now for Burger You's burgers you would actually feel good while having it because it not only tastes good but also the feel of the meat melting in your mouth will make you realise that even this can be possible with beef or pork which is known for their cheweeness plus less the over stuffed cheese and mayo.

The size of a burger is actually something which can only be compared to an international burger joint selling foot-long burger. But the price is much less than that of the big joint. So the quantity is-to price ratio is high. Their hot selling item is beef and pork burgers with 2 variants of each.

The cheese they use is mostly churned by them. Also the cuts of meat they buy is done very cautiously so it tastes the best. I would any day choose their burger over anybody else's in the city.

Had heard a lot about this place so today I finally went there. Okay , first of all , there was no signboard or anything like that which could tell us where to get the burgers  from. It was just a house. It is a place for takeaway only. We ordered mushroom burger , the oozy Suzy, bacon Bob and a chicken burger. All of them were amazing and HUGE !!!!  The patty was just too good with a generous layer of onion relish. The fries were served with garlic aioli which was good. I love the burgers here. They're much better than the common burger joints in town. All i want is more publicity for this place. Because it's just too amazing.

Today suddenly we saw that they were open for delivery. Tried and placed an order only to be informed by Zomato that  the items were out of stock.....worst possible experience.....!If there was an option of giving a negative rating i would have preferred that!!!

Hands down the best burgers in this city. If you have gotten bored with the regular likes of KFC and Mc D, this is the place one should come to. This is basically a home-run kitchen. So, practically there is no concept and option of dine-in. The only way is take-away.

The location to this place can be a bit tricky, so better follow the map or go through all the in-depth reviews put up here where some fellow foodies have explained the detailed way of how to get here.

This was my first time ordering here and honestly I was a bit skeptical. Having read the reviews here, my mind was filled with uncertainity as I did not know what was in store for me. Nevertheless, I picked up the phone and ordered for the following: 1) The Texan 2) Morning Joe 3) Oozy Suzy. I scheduled a pick-up near Kasba P.S:- at 7:45.

Unfortunately, I got stuck in the jam and it took me atleast 20 minutes more to reach the scheduled spot. The owners were cooperative and rang me twice to inquire about my present location and subsequent E.T.A. As soon as I reached the spot, I found the delivery guy waiting patiently for me. He handed me over all the burgers. I must say, they were indeed heavy (Meh having had to deal with stupid KFC Burgers all life long).

I paid the money along with a bit compensation for my delayed arrival. The person looked real happy and so was I on the expectation of devouring the burgers real soon. As soon as I got back home, I began unpacking the aluminium foil wrapped burgers. I started with 'The Texan'. It consisted of 1/4 pound patty, topped with crispy onion rings, BBQ sauce and grilled onions. Hands down, this was the best burger of the lot. I would put this ahead of Oozy Suzy. The tenderness of the patty, coupled with the crispiness of the onion rings, topped with the slightly but not overtly powerful tangy sauce and grilled onions, it was all a heavenly concoction of pure awesomeness.

Next in line was Morning Joe.  I really didn't like this, maybe more because of the presence of the baked beans. It kinda pissed me off and I would have rather gulped in the sausages and the patty ( I had opted for beef) alone. The presence of egg was like a cherry on top. Last but not the least, it was the star attraction of this restaurant, Oozy Suzy. A mammoth  and gigantic 1/2 pound patty topped with grilled onions. The patty was mixed with 4 siblings of the cheese family. It had an unique charms of its own which cannot be described in words. You need to eat this to feel it.

All in all, all the burgers were worth the money spent. The size, the quality, the packaging was beautifully done. I had to however warm them all up in the oven, but I did it carefully by putting in a small contained filled with water, so that the food inside doesn't dry up. I particularly loved the BBQ sauce and the fries. May be the next time I try any burger from here, I would go with the ones being topped with the delectable sauce. 

Do not wait more time reading this stupid review of mine with water in your mouth and a desperate yearning to experience the gastronomical delicacies. Rather, place your order, dress up and try these new sensations in town. Am sure, most of you would be rather pleased and not disappointed.

~Bon Appétit~

Burger You has thrilled me,  I love burgers,  specially when it comes to their Oozy Suzy.  It is quite a big one.  The patty us a real fat one.  They deliver very fast.  I think they make the biggest and the tastiest bugers in Kolkata.  I also remember the 25th Dec party we had at my home rooftop.  We had lots of Kebaabs they cooked with a big charcoal grill.  It was being cooked and served.

Definitely the best burger you could have in Kolkata. Finding the place can be tedious though. Its a takeaway counter or rather a house. They deliver to all parts of kolkata. I had Bacon Bob which was just amazing. You can say the price is on the higher side but so is the quality and quantity. One should not waste time by trying to find the place as you cannot have it there. So better you order from home or office and enjoy the heavenly burgers.

Best burgers in town without a doubt! 

The Oozie Suzy was succulent and just right. And boy was it huge! The add on bacon was also perfectly done.

The BBQ chicken again was very good.

The fries were nice and fat wedges.

Delivery to Gariahat was pretty prompt.

Burgers are decent but bad food hygiene. Unclean cutlery and food preparation area. While the food tastes good, you can only enjoy it if you still have the appetite for it.

Hi foodies!

=13th June 2014=
This place, as listed in Zomato, is really known for the best burgers in town. It's a good thing they specialize in this because, personally I believe that it is very difficult to make a burger actually worth having. Even very expensive and very high rated restaurants fail at it!

We ordered:
1) Grilled Chicken Burger: The patty was dry in itself but the dip made it better. Decent enough.

2) Pulled Pork Burger: This was simply awesome. I've never had a better pulled pork burger elsewhere. #MustTry

I did not like the fries they served with the burger. The taste gets overwhelming after the first few ones. The dips were nice.

-Cons-
> Okay, so I was going to rate this joint a 4 star, but unfortunately, as you can see the picture in which I have circled the highlighted area, I found a fly in my pulled pork burger. It was only the taste of the burger that prevented me from throwing the burger away. But seriously, a fly? One can only imagine the hygiene they are maintaining! 

> Considering their growing popularity, they should seriously consider upping their delivery game and ofcourse, the hygience!

-Bon Appétit. :)

Current Review :  
Previously I've given poor rating to this Take away food centre mainly for poor costumer services and delivery experiance, but now they have improved a lot and I become one of their foodie fan, now I can say loudly that this is the best place for Burger. All burgers are different, and well crafted too. 

Previous Review : 

"Very poor service and food, I have tried beef burger for home delivery they committed to deliver within 30 mins but got it after spending valuable time with a mental torture caused by the delivery guy for his stupidity, at last got delivered after more than an hour or so. 
Food was also very bad, bun was not fresh. Fries were burned. Overall strongly NO NO. These people should not provide this kinda service before gathering experience in customer service and quality control."

Bacon Bob kicks ass! Oozie suzzy is one for those cheese lovers and the Texan with fried onions is mesmerizing.

On hearing from my colleagues that they had ordered 4 burgers from burger you at 2.30 pm, they still could not deliver the burgers at 5.15 pm. This is utter harassment! Unbelievable! On calling them at 4.30, they said the same thing that they are on the way and will surely deliver. At 5.15, they said the same thing. Burger You, this is not at all expected from your regular customers and for new customers like me who probably would have had your burger but could not as you did not live upto what you promised. DO NOT COMMIT FALSELY TO YOUR CUSTOMERS EVER! I would personally never order from you and will never recommmend to my known people at all... This is a disaster! Guys, whoever is reading this review, make sure you ask about the timings of delivery and then order else you will be taken for a ride.

Unprofessionalism personified!

Placed an order for 4 burgers at around 2 pm. The first shock came when we were told that the order will be delivered at 5 pm since the person was still in the market purchasing raw materials! Even though 3 hours is a ridiculously long time to deliver 4 burgers we went ahead and placed the order and starved ourselves with huge anticipation. At 4:30 pm we called the person back only to find that he was still in the market! The person assured us that the burgers will be delivered to us in 1 hour. We waited patiently. At 5:15 we called again and the person told us that he had just reached after purchasing the raw materials. At this moment we lost our patience. To top it all, the person rudely asked us that we can cancel our order if we wish to! So basically they made us wait hungrily for 3 hours, only to tell us cancel our order! 

I have ordered from burger you several times earlier but this experience assured me that this will be my last order. I have also noticed a decline in the quality of the food and the attitude of the employee/owner makes the whole experience pathetic. 

Order at your own risk.

Very pathetic Service.. As per zomato their timings are from 1:30p.m.. Ordered for 4 burgers at 2:30, initially they said all their staff are out at the market buying raw materials and I can get delivery by 4p.m... Infact that was our lunch at office.. Waited till 4:15, called up to ask the status, said people are still in market, will get order in an hour.. Called up again at 5:15p.m, initially they said its already out for delivery.. Then I get a call saying people have just come from market and it will take an hour more..  Do they expect us to have lunch at 7p.m in the evening? Initially I was a fan of their burger but now I promise I won't ever have your burgers again.. N i seriously hope u guys close down soon... Really pathetic and poor customer service.. Close it down if u can't  keep up to ur commitments..

Okay type experience nothing special.... tried there grilled chicken burger.... the buns are soft stuffing and dressing are good.... but the chicken brest was a little bit stiff... the dip and potato wedges are tasty... According to me such a high rating is absurd.... because they serves only burgers and they don't have any dine in service so the rating is not considering any staffs service or deco... it is completely on there only one item with different varieties and delivery service.... so for getting such a high rating they need to server super delicious burgers... but I am confident that they are not serving awesome one.... definitely there are many joints in the town serving awesome burgers more more gr8 once with in the same price.... what ever pocket pinch was on the higher side...

For online orders from this shop, use promo code SFOODS and get Rs 100 off and Rs 50 cashback if its your first order on Zomato.

***Update 18th March 2016***
My 4th Purchase
Order: 1 Grilled Chicken Burger( home delivered). I live right across the street so I didn't have to follow the minimum order. 

Everyday,Every time they put on the grill and smoke the patties at the outlet, the aroma fills my rooms and it makes me crave for these burgers every day.

This time they cooked it well. The quantity of chicken was huge in quantity. It had that perfect blend of flavours sprouting from the spices. This is one commendable burger selling out. Its a pleasure for the tastebuds to experience such a palatable burger.The fries were crispy this time unlike my previous two orders(check my older review). The Mayo was delicious as always. Delivered in 15mins.

I feel like buying from this joint everyday but due to the prices I refrain as my pocket money isn't enough.  But its a fact that regular consumption makes it boring and tasteless.

The burgers are delicious and grubby. Together it's a whole meal. The fries and sauces are good too. Lacking the restaurant it's a great take away for burgers.

If you are a burger lover just dial the no of burger you and be excited cause when you will dig in to their burger, you taste buds will say thanks to you, it's a home based business, me and my friend visited that place we had their burger at the balcony and their hospitality is so good but still I would like to suggest "keep calm, stay at home, and wait for burger you"

On repeated insistence by a friend, i got convinced to give this place a visit. Let me warn you, don't even think of going there without google maps directions or a friend who has already been there. I had a friend who had been there and we still had to resort to maps, so that tells it all. Its not a shop, its just a house at the dead end of a lane, with no signboards in the vicinity. In spite of the location, if the place has a rating of 4.1, it tells us how serious these people are about their burgers. We conveniently placed our order for two veg burger meals over the phone and by the time we reached our parcel was ready.
A little heads up: have a bottle of chilled cold drink ready before you start devouring the monster burger!
Now, coming to the food..well, if you are expecting a burger like the burgers you've had in the past, with crisp patty, tomatoes and lettuce, the taste of cheese very prominent...you'll be hugely disappointed. Have it with an open mind and the enthusiasm of a true foodie who is ready to discover different styles of food, you'll be taken by surprise. The bun was super soft, the patty juicy, with ample amount of fried onions cooked just rightly to balance the taste. However they could've dealt with cheese a little more extravagantly, because the taste of cheese in the burger was very mild. I had heard they serve home made mayo with their burgers. On tasting i realized it was a mix of two or three ready-made dips that u easily get in the market, nonetheless it was good. The fries they serve are pretty awesome, and very very different than any other fries you get anywhere else!
I would definitely visit the place again when I am very desperate to have a burger because its a nice break from the other burgers i have been having till now!

Pros:
1.  Good taste.
2. They specialize in burgers, so they have focus, which is a very good thing.
3. Can't comment on the ambiance since they don't have one, but it has a very different appeal. Plus it is commercially very viable since they don't have costs associated with having a proper establishment. This will give them a better chance at surviving commercially, giving them the opportunity to focus on the quality of food exclusively.
4. The quantity is too good, one burger meal is enough for a lunch or a dinner.
5.  The fries are simply awesome.

Cons:
1. The location of the joint. You might be in the mood for burgers, on your way to burger you, and still go back without even locating the place.
2. Can improve on the packaging, specially when they are charging you pretty decently.
3. Just one option for vegetarians, which is a huge turn off and a little unfair.
4. The cheese in the burger doesn't make it cheesy at all.

P.s: Go to the place if you are open to different food ideas.
This review is unbiased, and totally based on my personal experience!

Did not even get an opportunity to try out the food here. Living in Kasba myself I was expecting  BY to deliver to my house which is within 2  kms distance but they have placed the minimum amount for delivery at 250. Order for 1 does not cost that much and hence I missed out on the home delivery "criteria". On top of that the lady who was taking my order was least bothered about my specifications, almost like another order won't make a difference to her. BY being hard to locate should should have a delivery service. It's really sorry that for a joint that serves good food they are doing the least to reach out to more people. So if you are ordering for one you can make sure you won't get your food delivered even if you happen to stay right next to BY.

After reading the reviews and checking out the pictures of the burgers felt so good that there is something like this in kolkata, but after I ordered today I can just say it was the worst and crappiest food I have ever ordered it had a really screwed up smell and very sticky also the sausages were really not as expected. This place doesn't even deserve a 1.5 rating will never recommend to any one nor even think of ordering again..... seriously sad...total waste of money had to throw out the full burger jst after taking a bite....

Had ordered food from here a while back. After reading so many reviews, had sky-high expectations. Sad to say, it was dashed somewhat. I did not like the burgers. After hearing so much praise, had ordered the Morning Joe which turned out to be quite a letdown. They served a meaty patty, yes: but the bread is not very fresh- or it might be because I had placed the order in the later part of the day@ 6pm.

The accompanying fries were soggy and nothing like crisp french fries, the dip was not up to the mark. I loved the thick, meat-laden patty- yes. That was the only saving grace. For the price I paid, I would have loved to visit Ruby's Grill or other such places. But I am willing to give another try and taste some more before coming to any conclusion. Maybe they were just having a bad day, as so many recommendations here seem to indicate them to be quite satisfactory in appeasing customers!

Absolutely top class sandwiches and burgers. The fries are a little greasy but the pulled pork sandwiches are to die for. The Morning Joe burger with bacon, sausages , baked beans , fried eggs are a treat too. Too bad they dont have a restaurant but just a delivery. Hope they continue to maintain the standards.

I ordered two TEXIN Burger on 11 Sep, 2015.
It was just enough for food poisoning.
Oil they used had v. bad smell & absolutely recycled.
Onion ring batter had a rotten smell.
Potato wedges was 100% burnt & turned black.
Overall the burger was smelly & can't be considered as a food.
I just thrown it to bin.
I followed up with burger u and they told next time they will provide a free burger for this incident, but I would never take such life risk.

Having tried Burger House, Burger King and Burger Barn Cafe in Pune, I decided to give this little joint a try as the name kind of intrigued me. I ordered around 9:45pm at night for The Texin burger and it arrived at 10:30. The patty was soft and so was the bread. It also came with fried potatoes and mint sauce. I was certainly not dissapointed with the quality and they give good value for your money. A bit pricey but then their sizes make up for it:) Would certainly venture here again.
Edit: The morning joe is a must try as it fills you up nice and proper. The grilled chicken patty is simply deli:)
Cheerio

This home delivery burger joint offers succulent burgers. I just love the Morning Joe although they sometime miss out on the pork patty (which is again disheartening). 
The masala french fries are awesome especially the mayo dip served with it are the ones which gets me back to them often.

After reading such great reviews about this place and after repeated recommendation from one of Kolkata's well known foodie, i decided to have a great burger one afternoon, all on my own. and believe me , i have never been so disappointed in my life. I ordered a Morning Joe and sausages. they look 53 minutes exactly to get me my food, all the while me roaming aimlessly in front of the building that houses the place. But the saddest part was, the food was bad. The patty thick yes, but dry and a tad bit tasteless. the bread soggy. The sausages were such that too much of those will give u indigestion. Only the potato wedges were really good. I had expected that they would serve home-made mayo with their food, but it was regular stuff that u get at the stores. That was one of the most disappointing meals of my life I must say. Only good thing about the place is a really friendly and helpful owner.

"Ruguo hanbao de hanbao nin"(if its burger,its burger you)
                                                                                                         -ancient chinese proverb

Normally,I wouldn't go this far.Normally,I wouldn't cast my thought as a confuscian edict.But it's not every Sunday that I get bowled over by something as innocuous and unsuspecting as a burger,or in this case,a couple of burgers.Be it the funions,or the lavishly spiced fries,or the mayo to go with,Burger you packs in a world between the bread and the patty.The texan,now at 200,was enough to douse my sunday brunch appetite by itself.Morning joe is deeply ensconced in eggs and bacons and sausages,along with beans and fries.While it could be more rewarding had burger you not 86-ed out of chicken and given me pork instead,it was still quite fulfilling.This will probably remain my antidote of choice against monstrous hunger pangs and ravenous meat cravings.

THEN-
this used to be the shrine of burgers[domain : kolkata] and CRISPY fries [domain : India] i used to worship the burger you ... it definitely deserved 4.5+ (5 if you neglect delivery time) 

their PULLED PORK was mouth-watering

NOW-
they still make great beef burgers ... ONLY BEEF burgers are great.
they've started making SOGGY fries. One time the fries they gave turned out to be SPOILT. their PULLED PORK burger made me PUKE halfway through as there was too much of lard and the buns were soaking wet. it was hideous. but i thought it can be neglected since it was the first time that happened but no...it is still UNEDIBLE.
delivery hasn't improved and all the new burgers are not worth our money.
CONCLUSION: order BEEF burgers and SAUSAGE items only and nothing else

I am just really disappointed with this place. I love the burgers here and got them to deliver for me twice. But now they have stopped delivering to places that aren't convenient for them and they demand for an order above Rs 600 to deliver the food which is pretty sad. So everytime i crave burgers from this place i never get them to deliver.

I recently had the morning joe from this place. It was a delivery and the delivery service was pretty bad. They had messed up the packets for the dips and things were a bit messy. Moreover, the quality of the food was pretty low to the extent that the egg kind of tasted a bit bitter. The French fries were soggy. The only good thing was that the  meal was pretty filling at a very cheap price.

The savior of burgers. When one says "burger" you think of the little tiny one's in KFC or McD, which taste terrible, and are suited to the appetite of a toddler.
Burger You turned that around, for me atleast.
Ordered the Oozy Suzy. Superb combination of taste and quantity. The beef is tender, well cooked and the cheese is everywhere. Add to that the bacon n fries and you have a clear winner. 
A definite try. They've paid homage to the hamburger well.

I noticed this place in hidden gems section. I'm a big fan of juicy burgers and loved them when I was in pune. So decided to try this without reading any reviews. Now I realize I should have done that first.
Please know that this is not a place where you can sit and eat. It's a takeaway from a home. And also finding it could be a pain. Fair enough. I go anywhere and eat in any conditions provided food is good.
 We waited 25 mins or so for one veg and one chicken burger. first the veg burger since I ate it : big , juicy , completely boiled potato and fried onion patty . And few sauces. Not much of a spice or taste. It was just wet with sauces. Very very low on effort and creativity. Bland tasting.
 
Now the chicken burger. I didn't taste it. My wife tried to eat it. The meat was rubbery and definitely smelly to such an extent that 2 bites  into the ride my wife decided to give up. 

Fries were decent according to me

I won't go nor recommend anyone. Only go if you have never eaten burgers outside of what McDonald's and kfc have to offer, and you live close to this place. 

Bad experience but then that's what experimenting is all about

It's not an eatery,it's a lil kitchen meant for take aways.We had ordered the beef morning joe and the texan and BOTH OF THEM WERE DELICIOUS.Undoubtedly,they serve the BEST BURGERS IN TOWN with a generous helping of fries.And the burgers are huge.It took two of us to finish one burger.Dude,if you are a foodie and if you love burgers,this is the place to be.

Had a really sad meal at Burger You last night. Left my friend and me sick. Literally.
We ordered an Oozy Suzie and a veg burger with added fried egg and cheese. Also wanted slaw on it but they didn't have. Neither did they have cheddar cheese.
The oozy  was yum but bordered on overwhelming. Even the aroma. Post eating experience was extreme discomfort, serious puking int he morning and a bad tummy. In short..something like food poisoning. Ugh.
And the lesser said about the veg burger the better. The patty was nothing was mashed bland potatoes with hardly any seasoning. 
Oh come on..i have had innovative yummy veg burgers. The patty surely could have been better.
The only good thing about the order was the fries and the tartar sauce.
Not ordering from this place again. Even my earlier orders weren't that satisfying. Something doesn't feel fresh about the burgers.
Adios.

I had so much hope for the place that I along with 4 friends of mine, whom I influenced to try burger you, traveled 25 km to get there. We opted for delivery at a friend's place near 8b bus stand. The receptionist was really lazy and didn't have proper information about anything. She didn't knew about the availability of the items on the menu, neither she knew about the locations that they deliver to. We didn't even get the bacon that we ordered thanks to her who forgot to write it down. It took them 1.5 hr to get there with the order. Now service wise that's pretty slow. Coming to the food, well to sum It up in one word, it was just 'ok'. I mean the beef patty in the texin was ok but onion rings were almost burnt. And the chicken patty in the morning joe was very thin considering you're paying 220 for that burger. Morning joe with beef patty was the better of the two. The fries  also weren't crisp. They simply resembled the ones you get at coffee house. So my experience was ok considering the high hopes I had for this place. Still I'm rating 3.5 because it is probably the only place that sells proper burger.

Now the chicken burger. I didn't taste it. My wife tried to eat it. The meat was rubbery and definitely smelly to such an extent that 2 bites  into the ride my wife decided to give up. 

Fries were decent according to me

I won't go nor recommend anyone. Only go if you have never eaten burgers outside of what McDonald's and kfc have to offer, and you live close to this place. 

Bad experience but then that's what experimenting is all about

This place rocks! Ok,so it's a lil difficult to locate.So what?If you are a foodie then you should be ready to go any distance for good food.Google maps led us there accurately . It's not an eatery,it's a lil kitchen meant for take aways.We had ordered the beef morning joe and the texan and BOTH OF THEM WERE DELICIOUS.Undoubtedly,they serve the BEST BURGERS IN TOWN with a generous helping of fries.And the burgers are huge.It took two of us to finish one burger.Dude,if you are a foodie and if you love burgers,this is the place to be.

Had a really sad meal at Burger You last night. Left my friend and me sick. Literally.
We ordered an Oozy Suzie and a veg burger with added fried egg and cheese. Also wanted slaw on it but they didn't have. Neither did they have cheddar cheese.
The oozy  was yum but bordered on overwhelming. Even the aroma. Post eating experience was extreme discomfort, serious puking int he morning and a bad tummy. In short..something like food poisoning. Ugh.
And the lesser said about the veg burger the better. The patty was nothing was mashed bland potatoes with hardly any seasoning. 
Oh come on..i have had innovative yummy veg burgers. The patty surely could have been better.
The only good thing about the order was the fries and the tartar sauce.
Not ordering from this place again. Even my earlier orders weren't that satisfying. Something doesn't feel fresh about the burgers.
Adios.

I had so much hope for the place that I along with 4 friends of mine, whom I influenced to try burger you, traveled 25 km to get there. We opted for delivery at a friend's place near 8b bus stand. The receptionist was really lazy and didn't have proper information about anything. She didn't knew about the availability of the items on the menu, neither she knew about the locations that they deliver to. We didn't even get the bacon that we ordered thanks to her who forgot to write it down. It took them 1.5 hr to get there with the order. Now service wise that's pretty slow. Coming to the food, well to sum It up in one word, it was just 'ok'. I mean the beef patty in the texin was ok but onion rings were almost burnt. And the chicken patty in the morning joe was very thin considering you're paying 220 for that burger. Morning joe with beef patty was the better of the two. The fries  also weren't crisp. They simply resembled the ones you get at coffee house. So my experience was ok considering the high hopes I had for this place. Still I'm rating 3.5 because it is probably the only place that sells proper burger.

Having heard quite a bit about the place, and being a burger fan, this place was on top of my to visit list.  The quest to find the location was no less than a treasure hunt. I went here with a lot of expectations. Though I wasn't fully satisfied,  it was worth a try. The burger come with a dip and fires.  The fires were amazing, the burger had ample amount t of chicken (all a paradise for burger lovers) but the onions in the burger was cooked manchurian type which gave a very bad feel to ye burger. They could have tried giving the same burger with lettuce tomato which would have been a better choice. But it was nice finding the place.

Wow.. Just amazing.. This is a different sorta place. They just deliver. So I went driving by GPS into small lanes of kasba and where the destination was marked there were houses. I thought I made a mistake so called the guy and said m near this hunger place.. He told me to wait and he came out of nowhere with some amazing food. Loved the burger.. I have just tried the texin yet, will try the rest also.. The fried onions inside are just too well cooked and the burger was just lovely.. Would recommend anyone to go there.. Just order when u r crossing ruby. Should take u 20 mins from there. I was really impressed though the reviews here made me go there in the first place

I've been meaning to write this review for quite some time now, and it's almost criminal to be devouring such deliciousness and not putting in a good word. So here it goes.
It'd be a tad bit inconvenient to locate the place if you don't know the area in and around Kasba well. But you can always opt for a home delivery if you're not living too far. The little trouble is absolutely worth it though. I've ordered the Slim Jim, Pulled Pork Sandwich, The Texin and Morning Joe at separate occasions and I'd totally recommend Morning Joe and Slim Jim with Bacon and Cheese add-ons. The texin is great too!
The food is of sufficient quantity and totally worth the money. I feel this is probably the only genuine place you would find a proper beef burger at. And I am darn sure you will ask for more. ;)
I hope they soon expand to a dine-in arrangement and also add more items to their menu. If you haven't been here, Bookmark it NOW! Bon appetite. :*

I tried this on recommendation from a friend. I ordered a delivery as it is near to my place. Ordered morning Joe with extra processed cheese, chicken burger with eggs and cheddar, sausage fest.
Highs: 
1. Unbelievable quality of the sausage with a unique smoky flavor, I believe it was home cooked
2. Well prepared burgers with eggs, beans, great quality bread
3. Comes with sides of succulent potato wedges and dips
Lows:
1. Lousy service, didnt pick up the phone last time and was conveniently half an hour late
Overall recommended and would try again

This is a funny place in that there's no restaurant, no ambiance. You call, you order, you pick up. First of its kind that I have come across. We had two Texans. One with bacon and one without. I had the former and by God, it was terrific. Juicy beef patty, onion rings and the bacon make for a mind blowing combination. So if you can find this place, you can be sure to fall for the Texan. Unfortunately I cannot vouch for the rest. But I am told they are just as delicious. So go ahead, give this place a try. The burgers are really filling and rather cheap. Bon Appétit!

I had tasted burgers from BurgerYou once before after hearing a lot of good reviews and honestly it was all good that time. We ordered Texin and it was good. I decided to get a home delivery and wanted my family members to taste their food and it went bad. I ordered Texin and chicken burgers. They delivered more than an hour wait and multiple phone calls - my home is within 2 KM from their place. The texin was ok, not superb because of the soggy bacons and oily fried onions. 

But the real surprise was in one of the chicken burgers we got a aluminium string in the patty. It got stuck in the mouth as no one expected such a thing a burger!! I am just thankful that it was not my child. The patty was overcooked as well. We called them up to report it. All they could say we are sorry, we should have checked it. Honestly, that was kind of a deal breaker. Would I order again from them? Probably not.

This place features in "hidden gems" in Zomato and hidden it truly is. As many others over here, I heard about the place from Zomato and the huge rating and great  reviews prompted me to find this place. It is impossible for a new person to find the place. Just directly call the number given in Zomato and the person will send their representative. 
It is just a home. Nothing else. A guy comes out of the home, u tell him the order and he goes back in and makes it for u. U have to wait on the road for an avg of 15-30 minutes and then he brings the order packed to u. That's it. Now go anywhere n eat it. I, luckily had my car and could eat it before the fries went cold. For others who plan to take it home, all the best.
Pros:
1. Awesome burgers, no comparison to anything else available in Kolkata 
2. Cheap on the pocket , compared to KFC/MCD and other burger places
3. For the non conservative, they serve beef, pork and chicken, as u wish.
Cons:
1. Impossible to find without help
2. Long waiting time, and that too on the road. Not even a couple of chairs
3. Packing ain't gud. 
4. Some items like oozy Suzy are awesome but totally bad for health. By the time u start eating , the multitude of cheese would already be hardened.
5. Have some soft drinks / water ready before u start eating. It Is Heavy!

Must have items:
The texin,Morning Joe, oozy suzy(not for the health conscious thou), sausage fest

It's not a shop..its basically nothing.. They just give home deliveries.. N if you want a take away then you'll have to follow GPS.. Cuz nobody knows about them.. Even when you're right in front of their place you won't know that.. Because they don't have any kind of indication..not even a name board or even lights.. We basically had to ring the bell and ask for them.. 

Coming to the food it was good.. We had chicken burger n slim Jim..slim Jim was good..the beef was okay..but the chicken in the chicken burger was overcooked..didn't taste that good..they gave mayo dips and home cooked sorta finger chips which were kinda good..dips were very less in proportion ..most of the things in their menu are unavailable..

About the price..well they are pricey considering food quality and everything..cumon they don't have to pay for shop-like stuffs like rent and tax :/..still their burgers are costlier than KFC :/..we had to wait  in the dark for 40 mins..

Overall if you live nearby that area and have  sudden meat cravings then you can order there otherwise its not worth it..don't think gonna go back there..

A friend of mine recommended this place to me. I looked them up on zomato and called them up to place on order. I had almost placed my order when i just re-checked if there were any delivery charges etc. (No delivery charges above a certain amount) and the price of the burger. I was told that the burger which i was ordering (oozy suzy - the most expensive on the menu) would cost me Rs.50 more than the MRP mentioned on the menu online as the prices had increased and had not been revised, as the owner Mark (as mentioned by the person who took my call) did not have the time to update it as he was busy with other projects. - The most ridiculous excuse that i have ever heard!!! Extremely unprofessional!!!! Hope the burgers do justice to this nonsense. Pls check prices before placing orders with them!

I found out about Burger You from a friend a year ago, and have tried almost all their burgers. Burger You is not a joint you can visit for take away, nor is there a dine in. It is solely a food delivery joint and it is good at what it does. They start delivering after 2 in the afternoon. They have a precise and mouth watering menu and it is safe to say all the burgers in the menu are worth trying. My personal favourite is The Texin which is majorly beef ribs and it is juicy and full of flavours. The Pulled Pork is another of my favourites and it is a must try for pork lovers. Even their simple Chicken Burger is worth mentioning. Coming to the star of the show - Oozy susey (if I am spelling it correctly) it is a huge burger with thick beef patty and is too heavy even for big eaters! But it is a juicy heaven for beef loves. With each order you get Dip and Fries. They used to provide slaugh but now they've stopped. I don't know whether they have a delivery charge since I stay close by. They take some time to deliver, but the it is worth the wait. Do try when craving burgers, Burger You wont let you down. One of the hidden gems indeed. Enjoy

Ordered Texin and Sausage Fest.
Lot of good tender beef, sausages were reasonably savoury, fries actually not bad (needn't always be crisp). Buns could be better - firmer crust required.
Both beef and sausages could have been a little more vinegary (marinate them?). Sweet onion sauce on the burger would be really good. And sachets of ketchup and mustard for the ooze.
Overall: good ingredients, hefty portions, feel-good factor. But could improve lots.
Suggestion: the burger is really big and I couldn't finish it, so they could try serving sliders instead. Good pao (available in Park Circus) makes super sliders when slightly toasted.

Excellent : beef burger.  Solid 1/2 pounds beef patty and cheese - delight to have international quality burger. Cost ₹ 400.

Good : pork sausage and fried egg burger - yummy !!

Average : 12 hour slow cooked pork - did not live up to the promise - it was not bad - just not in the zone

Chicken burger - pieces were tough to chew 

Bad : the fries - dark and over done - could not be eaten 

Defies Logic - being just a kitchen and dependant on deliveries - there is ZERO branding. Food comes in plastic packets and silver foil and NOT MARKED. We have to open - see - smell and decide which is which

However that beef patty burger at ₹400 is the only reason you should order.

I find abolutely reason why people should even consider visiting this place! I had the slow cooked pork burger , cooked for 12 hours which i threw after eating half! The fries sucked too! How can someone not cook the fries right? Its just fried potato with salt! Really sucky place! Not worth it!

A huge Zomato rating prompted me to visit this place which is pretty close to my house.. Went there today with my good friend, Abhishek Chatterjee to have a heavy evening snack..
Location: Mind you, I know the locality inside out, yet I had trouble finding the place, mainly because they have absolutely NO boards, banners or any signs.. The people next door don't know about this place and rightly so.. This is not a restaurant, its just a kitchen, where we can pickup food..
Ambience: Nothing. 0/10.. There is no provision to eat there, beware.. There are no chairs, no tables, not even any shade to stand under.. There's just a road to stand..
Service Time: Pretty slow.. We had to stand for over 25 mins for an order of Morning Joe and Sausage Fest, that too in the middle of the road..
Food: Brilliant.. The only thing, the most important thing, which outweighs the rest of the cons.. The Morning Joe had a huge stuffing, generous amounts of French fries and a simply awesome white sauce.. Excellent.. The sausage fest, was exactly as its name, sausages cut up and served in an exquisite bar-b-q sauce, along with French fries.. Enjoyed thoroughly..
Even without any tax, the place is quite expensive as the collective order ended up in excess of 450/-
(The menu in Zomato is outdated, Morning Joe costs 220/- and Sausage Fest 250/-)
Considering the lack of ambience and seating arrangements, its quite expensive.. Overall, little disappointed, but not with the food..

I'd like to start with the place it's very difficult to locate it unless you call them up & they send someone to fetch you, next you have to wait on the streets for your order, further there is no banner or the looks of a proper shop. The food is very tasty specially their morning joe burger & sausage fest is quite delicious and yes the price is a bit too high.

I am a burger lover. Getting a good proper burger is a bit of an asking in Kolkata. But this store has proved me wrong. I ordered for the food and spoke to the owner Patrick who is a very polite person. The deliver was prompt and the service guy was really good. I had ordered for three burgers. The slimjim, Texin and the Chicken burger with extra cheese and bacon. Did not liked the onion rings in the Texin as they where over cooked. But the burgers where really great, nothing fancy, but proper classic burgers. Bacon lover (like me) go for the extra bacon they are quite generous. Their prices have increased than the menu in zomato by 20-30 rupees but its worth the price. The chips are actually wedges which is even better for me and after a long time had a nice mayonnaise based dip to go with the wedges. 
For all the three burgers it pocket pinch was 740. I say its worth every penny.
Highly recommended and will definitely order again.

Okay, so this place has got me short of words basically. I have an average appetite and the chicken burger got me stuffed enough to not move for a while. The burger lived beyond my expectations. Every time I crave for an actual burger, Burger You is the only place that comes to my mind. Way better than other burger offering outlets. Although the only drawback is that they don't have a dine in yet. But the burgers definitely make up for it.

Getting something like this in Kolkata was a bliss. Ordered chicken burgers with an add-on of a fried egg. The egg made the burger more delicious. If I am to give any suggestion it would be that the chicken patty was a bit hard and less juicy. Had it been tender, I would have rated Burger You 5 out of 5. Nonetheless, I look forward to have more lovely experiences in the future.

I was completely unaware of this place until a colleague suggested we order burgers for lunch at work. It was a rather large order, ranging from the simple vegetarian burger to the mammoth half pounder called Oozy Suzy. The half pounder was filled with different types of cheese and I managed to finish it only after a few colleagues pitched in. The overall quality of meat is phenomenal and the potato wedges which are served as a side remain crisp even though the delivery may take awhile. In hindsight, maybe I should have ordered the Slim Jim, Morning Joe or the Texin which is sufficient to fill your stomach. However, if you have an appetite which is above average, there is nothing which compares to the Oozy Suzy - meat, cheese and more meat. The chicken patty seemed dry though and it should have been juicier. It has been ages since we have had burgers tasting this good and this take away place should do well if it can maintain the quality and consistency.

If they had a dine-in I'd bet my fortune on them for they would make all the other famous and not-so-famous food joints in the city a run for their money.
Well I ordered an Oozy Suzy and a Chicken burger both of which came with wedges and dips- such a delight.
The oozy suzy is gotta be one of the best burgers i've had so far and it typically gives the feeling of having a real all-american burger which you get to see on 'eat street' and TLC, only until burger you happened.
And the chicken burger was also sumptuous and lived up to my expectations after having the oozy suzy.
Even though the burger came in lil late the wait was totally worth it. Looking forward to more. Cheers!

i have came to know  about  this place through  zomato itself.  the burger  is absolutely  awsome  nd delicious.  it taste good when  u eat it as soon as u have it in your hand as the cheese melt in ur mouth nd taste delicious .  but the problem  is  they does not have any place to sit nd have it.  i think they should  arrange  some place.  furthermore  it very tough to locate  the place. otherwise  no other burger in the city  can give them any competition.  they r absolutely  mouthwatering.

This place was in my wishlist from a long time.Today me n my friend decided to visit this place.It's very difficult to trace this place.We walked for more than 20 mins from kasba police station n thn we were able to find this place only because a guy came out of a random house n asked us what were we searching for..To our surprise that place had no banners or posters it was that random house n dat guy was going to serve us our food😂 We had to stand for like 20mins n thn we got our food.We ordered chicken burger.It was tasty.The french fries were more than what we expected.I would like to try all the other burgers.But please do not try to find the place.It's better to call n order.

Alright, this place is hands down the best place for burgers you'll ever find in Kolkata. I had ordered a chicken burger and I can say that Im more than satisfied. The only drawback about this place is it's location. And since it is a home kitchen, they didn't put up any banners which is why I had to circle about the place for a good 30 minutes. But here's the deal, if you're having a burger craving and want to pamper your taste buds thoroughly, you must visit this place.

Well dis is a take away joint.burger lovers will surely love their preparations.location is quite diffcult to find.i hv to call them several tym to locate d place. as they hv no add or boards, moreover their foodjoint is actually in a residencial house no proper shop or takeaway joint so its diffclt to understand.they serves hot fresh made burgers in parcel.either u hv to sit in our car to hv burgers or u can simply take it to ur home.coming to the food.they take 15-20 mins for preparing.slim jim is one of d most tasty burger.i tried chicken burger which ws also up to d mark. Their burgers r heavy n one is enough to satisfy ur tummy. Burger lovers shud try once atleast.

Cons : HARD to locate the place.Stone throw distance from SBI NEW BALLYGUNGE BRANCH.I had to call them couple of time to locate the place.This is not a proper din-in place or take away joint.You have to wait outside the house,that's pretty annoying.I had the food in my car..

Tucked in one quiet lanes of Ballygunge, it almost seems this place has been set up to make it hard to find - not even a single board has been put up and you have to and have to call. Anyways, we had 1. The Texin and 2. Morning Joe, both with beef patty and accompanied by French Fries. Burgers were real good with decent meat portions and devoid of unnecessary lettuce, tomato etc. Fries could have been better. Took about half an hour to deliver though. Nevertheless, it did manage to satisfy both my beef and burger cravings - so of course I am looking forward to more of Burger You.

Heard about this joint a lot,  but honestly i didnt like it much.  Practically it is really hard to find the joint.  They should atleast put up a banner of Burger You in front of the house.
Well coming back to the food,  we ordered a chicken burger (170/-), an oozy suzy (400/-) and a sausage fest(250/-). Yes the price have increased from the previous menu.  The chicken burger was really good teamed well up with the potato wedges. The sausages were also good but the quantity is a total disappointment.  It was like having more of potato wedges fest rather than sausage fest.  The plate was full of potato wedges and some sausages were sprinkled on top of it. 
And now the oozy suzy,  it is the costliest item on the menu...  The beef patty is good, but again it is not at all spicy... I like my meat spicy,  which iz why i didnt like it much. 
The last but not the least,  they could at least arrange some stools provided the space,  these burgers would have tasted much better instant and hot.

Kolkata's Burger King!
Heard about this joint from a friend and decided to try their Pulled Pork Sandwich (actually a burger) while my wife went for a chicken burger. 

From the first bite - i was in a sumptuous heaven. The pork was slow cooked and succulent, the fries were done just right and the chicken steak filling was perfectly made. 

Mind you, they are a delivery service only - but who cares if you have food this good! Once u have a bite here, you will just forget the crappy vada paoz and chicken buns that we are taught are burgers. 

Fellow foodies - I've munched on as many burgers as there are under the sun. Trust me, this is the way should be made. Just hoping they start a dine in sometime.

I have never had such difficulty in locating a place. I just hope they open a restaurant soon and puts up banners for the same. This is for all the first timers- Burger you is purely a take away joint. Basically the guy just opened up a restaurant in his house. So when you go there dont expect to dine in . You practically have to wait outside for the food. Kind of annoying if you ask me. They should atleast make sitting arrangements for those who are coming .

DIRECTION:Take the road beside new kasba police station , then first left then first right and gooo straight till the end where you see a band box dry cleaners, ask them for the SBI branch new ballugunge or for the restaurant HUNGREE.  The SBI is just after the Hungree restaurant so when you stop there call the burger you guy to come and pick you up. Its just a 2 min walk from there. This is the shortest way i can tell you or else trust me it can be very confusing if you try locating it by yourself.

Food:I wont lie,the trouble to get here was worth it. I think the place serves one of the best burgers  in kolkata. Really scrumptious and filling. Reminds me of the sizes available abroad. Even the fries that they give are quite alot and very well made including the dip. I had the chicken burger and i am waiting to order again. Just wow. I just hope the charm, quality and quantity remains the same.
 For your information the price of the burger was 170/- and not 150/-. They have a revised menu so call and check before you order.

Overall great food and at a very reasonable price.

Delivery is prompt. We ordered for Oozy Suzy and the quality of the beef was superlative. The £1.5 patty is pure meat with no adultration.
At the end of it, your taste buds crave for more but your appetite protests.
The Morning Joe is another treat for meat-lovers.

Surely the joint justifies its place in the meat craving section. Had ordered for the Pulled Pork Sandwich and Slim Jim Burger (bacon add on), both to my surprise stood up to my expectations!!! The bread was fresh, spices were subtle, perfect juiciness  and the meat was YUM.
Costing is still debatable, but the moment you compare the meat ratio and the seasoning perfection: Burger You stands clear winner.
Definitely a must for meat loving foodies.

My quest for finding the perfect burger in Kolkata has finally come to an end!!! Burger You, You are my new prince charming. Filled to the brim with meaty goodness, these burgers are the best in the city. We ordered a Texin, a Chicken burger( for my oh-so-apprehensive-parents) and a Morning Joe. The Texin patty was moist and succulent and the onion rings were crisp and yummy. The bbq sauce....okay enough! You have to try it once! The Morning Joe was...well...sumptuous and hearty. It had everything that you could imagine and much much more. These two burgers were so good  that even my parents abandoned their apprehensions to have a bite. Its a pity we finished the whole spread in like 10 minutes.A word about the fries - OMG! You guys actually made crispy french fries which were hands down the best in comparison to all the "alu bhajas" served by most fast food chains. 
So the best three places to have burger in Kolkata are
1. Burger You
2. Burger You
3. Burger You!!!
However, if you are opting for home delivery, it will take some time. So hang tight for the awesomeness that will arrive at your doorsteps is worth the wait!

The burger will make you feel like an episode of Man Vs Food. A half pound beef patty burger with add-ons is really big for an Indian. Thumbs up for the availability of add-ons as per your cravings for cheese, bacons, eggs, etc. Thumbs down for the cheese; mozzarella used in the patty was excessive chewy. Please look after that Burger You!
Potato wedges was also crispy and fried to excellence. 
Keep up the good work and feed the Kolkata people excellent burgers.

We have now ordered twice. Excellent burgers. Chicken burger is beter than anything that McD's or KFC can dish out and the Texin and Slim Jim are fantastic juicy beef burgers. The bq sauce with the texin is a perfect match and the mustard with the slim him. My son had his texin with bacon added and insisted that it is better than the simple texin. To sum up, we enjoyed our burgers and will be ordering regularly. Burger You, please beef up your delivery system, which is good, but I think you guys are going to be overrun with orders. I hope you remain consistent. We will keep ordering.

I'm gonna rate this a perfect 5 even though they arrive a tad but late at times, but OH MY GOD, when you take a bite of that special Oozy Suzy with extra Bacon and Cheese,your heart will melt, and leave you craving for more, although I doubt you're up for an Oozy Suzy, cause I almost managed to finish it, and also make sure
 you order their special California Blush Dip with the Complimentary Fries you get. And you won't even feel like you're spending!

NO BULLSHIT REVIEW: In a sentence, this Joint is the best you've Scored.

So this is hands down the best burger you'll find in Kolkata. They have done what every restaurant in this city should do (but next to none of them do): do a few items and do them ridiculously well. Prices are completely reasonable for what you get and they do know their seasoning. Portions are generous and fries are potato wedges and (at least I think) not deep frozen McCain stuff.

I only wish more restaurants would adopt this approach. The only thing I can ask from the proprietors: Keep doing what you are doing, don't expand your menu (at least not much) and don't get entangled in the business of having an eat-in place or any other advancements, that'll only pile on to your prices and really you have a winning thing going here as it is. No need to embellish. 

Be certain I'll tell anybody I know, meet or even just bump into on the street about this place. Also, we've faced no challenges with delivery times. It's been prompt, they've found the place without calling to ask for directions a hundred times (which next to no other restaurant seem to be able to) and we've received our stuff warm.

Lack of stupid plastic packaging is a plus. Keep on with the paper bags no matter what others say.

The best part about Burger You is the casual approach that they have to serve you some awesomely mouth watering american delicacies. What started off as a quest to satisfy two very hungry girls, soon became the find of the year! Burger You have such a huge plaster of burgers that it would even embarrass the Americans. We started of with a beef burger called Slim Jim which by far was one of the best I tasted till date. No add ons like onions and tomatoes to spoil the flavour and fragrance of the patty - which was certainly a no nonsense typical beef patty. The bread was soft and not the lump of flour that we normally encounter in the name of burger. The next in line was Texan burger - a jumbo half a pound patty with fried onion rings! The onion rings in itself was a delicacy - each being fried individually in batter. And both came with dollops of yumm dips and loads of french fries. The only issue that I found was that they have no waiting area and it is a private kitchen set up in a private house. We waited for almost 20 mins on a bike parked outside the premises. The best option is to come in your car, park and have it in the car or order for a take away. Small or big every order is treated with equal amount of élan. I absolutely loved my experience and hope everyone will find it equally enjoyable.

If you want to enjoy a home made meal.This is an ideal joint.I ordered the pulled pork sandwich from here as per their recommendation and boy was I impressed.I was amazed to find the quantity of meat they had provided and it was very tasty.If you love eating pork then pulled pork sandwich is surely a prize winner.Keep up the good work.The only thing that I am concerned is that many small multicuisine restaurants had opened in kasba but didnt last long despite their good food.I hope burger you prospers and stays for good.
All the best!!!!

Their pulled pork burger is the Helen of Troy of burgers, you could start a fight over it! It's that good!

The cheeseburger is simply stellar, so are the sausages! You want authentic burgers, you gotta find this place!

So I was looking for a light dinner and hit up Zomato to look for good sandwich and burger sellers Closeby. The user ratings and reviews of this place helped me decide fast that I need to try Burger You.
Essentially, these guys deliver only out of what looked like their own kitchen. Locating this place can be difficult and it's quite far off from the Kasba main road. 
Thankfully, after being lost and everything, I reached there. They have limited option when it comes to chicken. So, I ordered for the sole chicken burger that they have on the menu. I topped it up with crisp fried bacon. 
The burger is generous and comes with a hearty side of French fries. Infact, kudos to the owners for not being miserly with the fries. The burger patty is a grilled/fried chicken breast with dressing. The bacon was crisp. The Mayo dip was tasty. Overall a very good eat. The price: INR 220.
I felt the prices are a bit on the steeper side, especially since proper done-in restaurants offer burgers at an economical price. At this price, I did expect a side of salads, but the after-taste left me longing for more.
I would hopefully visit these guys again and try out the pulled pork burger.

This is most certainly the best burger place in town. And it is close to my place - so well, what could one want more ? :)

Now coming to the orders, ignore the chicken fillet burger (and of course the veg burger !!) and go straight to the other options which can be into two types - (a) the lighter versions that comes with bbq sauce and salad (like pulled pork and texin), and (b) the heavier ones that come with baked beans, potato wedges and serious meat ( like morning joe). I personally like the lighter version which I find more balanced, as opposed to the heavier version which is slightly dry and lacks an element of acidity or freshness to balance out the serius meat combo. I wish Burger You would give the option of just adding a slice of tomato and onion at least.

Needless to say, beef and pork are superior forms of meat than chicken - so basically it is no-brainer what u should order if u eat beef and pork. :) the potatoe wedges and mayo are hearty and sumptuous.

I would like if they give an option of coke or a drink. Every time I order I have to ensure I have a coke to gulp it down.

Everybody has an issue with the service but with economies of scale, it is going to naturally disappear. So I won't bother much with it.

Had the Oozy Suzy and well,it was legitimately good.
Although,if you have a small appetite then stay away from this one.
It is BIG.
And the cheese gets a little dull when you keep chewing through the juicy beef patty.
Go for the Texin or Slim Jim.
Fries were overdone and burnt.
Too salty.
Nevertheless,this undoubtedly serves the best burgers in town.
Go for it!

An awesome for burger lovers. But a dine in is really really needed, cold burgers are a big no no! But good thing being, they willingly deliver. They do take a lot of time, but they do deliver!
The prices are good for the offerings. Worth a try!

Oh god! Had such a crazy evening trying to have burgers from this place. First tried to hunt the place down for a takeaway. Failed miserably after 45 minutes of trying. They kindly agreed to deliver our order in front of kasba p.s. and our wait started. Their service is horrible. No doubt about it. They took a good 1 hour to deliver an order which they promised in 30 mins max. Shame.
But boy were the burgers good! We ordered a pulled pork sandwich and a morning Joe. The pulled pork was juicy with tender soft pork meat, sweet caramelised onions and soft buns.  Loved it. The morning Joe was excellent as well with a perfectly cooked egg on top oozing yolk. It had a smokey flavour with the pork adding extra zing to the burger. The French fries served with it were more wedges than fries but tasted nice with its dusting of spices. The mayonnaise was excellent as well. Overall excellent food but horrible service and the steep minimum orders quoted for delivery to various parts of the city might keep you.
P.s. the prices have risen a good 20 30 bucks each burger than one displayed by Zomato.

If any of you are hard core carnivores and love burgers, the place to go to is a takeaway called Burger You! Though I was too chicken to order the beef and the pork ones, (pun be damned!), the murgi burger was delish and so was the sausage fest platter!! ...Thanks to a review in TOI on Saturday, prices had been jacked up the very next day...but satisfaction is guaranteed. The buns are soft and the meat juicy, succulent and bursting with flavours. 
The service is courteous and quick but the packaging is basic....aluminium foil. 
No delivery charges are levied for home delivery to neighborhoods within a 2km radius

Not many places in Kolkata serve good burgers but Burger You is an exception.  I ordered their Texin only the other day and even though it took 2.5 hours to turn up (Whew! They make you wait, wait badly for it.), the very first bite took me to burger heaven! That gorgeous barbeque sauce and  that delicious steak patty made for a perfect combo.  The fried onion rings only added to the food drama pleasantly surprising my taste buds!  But, the only downside were the fries.  They were a let down.  Also, I'd be glad if they speed up their delivery time! That apart, Burger You, I loved you!

Burger You was one hard joint to crack!!!
I saw the reviews on zomato and the attraction was instant! I love a good juicy meaty giant burger. Each mouthful satiates the inner carnivore. The menu looked enticing. Beef, bacon, cheese, pork. Meat lovers heaven!
So, one fine evening, 7:30ish, i called them up, dreaming if stuffing myself happy with yummy burgers. They said they were out of bread cheese toppings. Crushed, i decided to try my luck the next day. I called up one hour early, 6:30, confudent that my superb intelligence will be rewarded by burge. But to my utter heartbreak they informed me that they are swamped with orders and have temporarily not taking any new order. They asked me to try after about an hour. But i gave up n decided to try some other day. I gave my heart a day to recover and called them up at 4pm the following day. Yeeeeeiiiii!!! They were able to take my order!!! At last!!
I ordered the Texin and they said that they have a lamb patty burger which will be good with extra chheddar cheese. I wanted cheese on the Texin but they suggested cheese will not go well with it. They asked me to pick the parcel in front of the Kasba New police station. It was a bit of an hassle to wait for an unknown guy but i dint mind it that much.
Finally, the burgers were there. The Texin is a huge beef patty covered with onion rings and some sort of sweet barbecue sauce. The onion rings still had a crunch after being soaked with the sauce. The patty was fat but i somehow found a sort of weird smell i didnt like. Nonetheless it was juicy and delicious. But the star of the day was the Lamb burger!!! It was utterly delicious. Moist lightly spiced and melt in your mouth!! The cheese helped too. I just loved it. Myst try if available. They also serve hand cut fries with the burgers. Quantity wasnt much. But the fries tasted good. For my next venture, the Oozy Suzie and the pulled pork sandwich.
Its great to see the burger void in Kolkata being filled up and with great panache at that. Keep it up Burger You!

Excellent burgers. Mark has perfected the model of providing exactly what we have a dearth of in Kolkata, a good burger. Have tried the slim Jim, the texin, the morning Joe, the oozy Suzy and the sausage fest and I'm at a dilemma about which one to try every time. Just wish the pulled pork sandwich was more easily available. They're by far the best in the burger space in Kolkata.

The best burgers in town for sure.
Had the Texin as well as the chicken burger and both of them were amazingly good.
The only drawback is the delivery time which is not an issue for me as the burgers were just too good.
I really wish the packaging was a little better as by the time the burgers reach you the bun becomes soft.

I heard about Burger You from a couple of fellow foodies who were kind enough to give me Co-Founder Mark's number since at that time it was not listed on Zomato. 
I ordered the Slim Jim which is a quarter pound patty with grilled onions and a mustard dressing. The Pulled Pork Sandwich which is probably their best offering and my top pick .... its filled with delicious slow cooked pork with barbecue sauce and its super yummy ! The Sausage Fest which is Handmade sausages ( yes they make there own its not the tasteless processed variety ) with Mash Potatoes and I loved the texture and flavor of the sausage. Good quality of meat in the Patty and good portion sizes make this place quite a crowd puller..
The down sides are long delivery times my minimum has been an hour and a half , soggy french fries and poor packaging but these are not huge issues and I sincerely hope that as they grow more popular and have a higher turnover the above negatives will improve. The next time a burger craving hits you call Burger You and give them a shot for sure.

Finally they are on zomato and I can give a review! Where do I start? Since the time I tasted their burgers a year ago, I have ordered a number of times. The burgers are so delicious that you simply cannot get enough! Personally, I am a diehard fan of the pulled pork sandwich, a sinful creation the very thought of which makes my mouth water, even on a full stomach. The meat, and the special barbecue sauce, make the burger a treat for all times. Do not forget to try their sausages... You will not be buying the frozen stuff from supermarkets after you do. The texin is also a work of art, and in a city where beef is hard to come by, it is a must-have for all lovers of the meat-- the crunchy surprise of onion rings inside the burger is a bold and innovative touch. The pork ribs (not on the menu yet) are also something you should not give a miss! All thumbs up to Mark, Patrick and their team for giving the city a takeaway joint that is a fresh and welcome change from biriyani and chilli chicken. Looking forward to sitting and dining at Burger You! Hella Hella! :-)

I had the slim jim burger, and I must say, it is the best burger I have eaten in Kolkata. The closest competition was chilli's but it doesn't come close to burger you. The addition of the price makes this joint a steal. Highly recommend it.

Burger You is magnificent. I'm from the States, and had been craving a legitimate burger for AGES since I've moved to Kolkata; I had not had the opportunity to have one until Mark and Patrick started this delectable business.
Service is pretty fast considering that they only have a handful of people delivering the burgers everywhere, and that the same guys operate the kitchen as well!My favorite is the Pulled Pork. Tender, juicy pork stringed out into a patty and glued together with a brilliantly made BBQ sauce.
Other amazing options include the Oozy Suzie, which should include a consumer discretion warning (because it's so goddamn rich and literally oozing out with cheese that's stuffed into a half pound beef monster patty.)
The Texin is a safe, classic beef patty served with homemade onion rings.
I heard he's starting spare ribs. I need to try those pretty soon.

The only con of this place is that they have cursed me; now I cannot besmirch my mouth with any other burger in the city.

Patrick and Mark have managed to create havoc in the city by introducing the most tender, juicy burgers to the people of South Kolkata. They operate from home (near Ballygunge/Kasba) and personally deliver the culinary goodness at your door step. (You can also pick up the burgers from their place) 

#GluttonsPick

1. Oozy Suzy
2. Morning Joe
3. Texin

No burger can taste it's eat without fat. And #BurgerYou promises oodles of goodness, flavour and textures and happen to be very generous with the quantity. You have a choice of adding cheese, mustard, BBQ sauce, caramelised onions, fried eggs, extra bacon to a well seasoned and ground pork/beef/chicken patty. Meal for two would be around Rs 500.

First and foremost I would like to very blatantly state that I love Burger You because this place is a rare combination of good juicy burgers at economical rates. 

I have been reading the reviews written by previous users of Zomato and I honestly do not agree with most of the 'recurring problems'. 

I have tasted their Oozy Suzy, Texin and Slim Jim burgers and the pulled pork sandwich. The Oozy Suzy does indeed ooze out cheese once you bite into it and tastes okay. I would not mind paying a bit more for a choice of sauce (sweet or hot) and some good Cheddar to ooze out of the patty. The Slim Jim is a wee bit disappointing after you have tasted the Texin. It is to my understanding grilled with a different cut of meat than the Texin but I don't like it because the mustard dressing tastes quite flat. My favourite is without a doubt the Texin. I love the sweet bbq sauce and the crispiness of the onion rings. I usually go for medium rare and I love it. The pulled pork is rather tender and is easy to chew and goes really well with the bbq sauce. Someday I hope I will have the courage and appetite to consume an entire Morning Joe all by myself.

While they never guarantee a 30 mins delivery like the pizza companies do but I have always received my orders well within their stipulated time. So forty five minutes has almost always been forty to fifty minutes in my case. I am not a fan of their slaugh. Another reviewer put it rather well, it is usually watery and stale. That crispness of the slaugh is always missing. Apart from this I have no reasons to complain.

My best wishes to the team and I hope they will continue to feed hungry people like us for a long time to come. I just have two requests for the Burger You Fellas:
1. Provide the consumer some choices wrt to the sacue they want.
2. No. 2 is not a request actually. Its more like an expression of despair because I am still waiting eagerly for that elusive RARE rib steak patty in my Texin.

I got a chance to eat at the Burger You stall at Weekender after my friend who is a huge fan told me about it. I tried the Pull Pork and the BBQ Chicken Burger. Both of which were really good. The Pull pork though was excellent. My only complaint at the event was that the serving time was very slow something like 30-45 minutes which was fine with me since the actual product was very good but a lot of other people seemed to be unhappy with this issue. Also I wish there was an easier and faster  way to get these burgers as people have told me that for home delivery the order amount has to be a decent amount and the delivery time is a minimum one and a half hours. Even despite the above issues I will rate Burger You a 5 just because of how good their burger is. I wish them all the best in the future.

MOVE OVER CHILLI'S 
This is the shizz.
I tried the chicken burger. The meat was great. Nice mustardy flavouring etc.....
I tried the pulled pork sandwich.
Soon after that I felt a couple of angels lift me up and I felt myself floating in the air.
I had died and gone to heaven.......the meat....slow cooked, flavourful and lots of it. That's all I remember before st. Peters snapped me awake. My mother, conservative woman that she is, asked me if there was an orgy going on judging by the sounds I was making by eating the burger. Value for money too....can't wait to try the rest of the stuff.

1. The Texin
Soggy onion rings (criminal!), but the smoky bbq sauce redeems the burger. The patty is enormous, and delicious all the way through.

2. The Morning Joe
Absolutely fantastic. The thick cut bacon + herbed, spicy, pork sausages are fantastic. The starchiness of the sweet beans cuts through the grease well. Word of caution, it has a sneaky way of filling you up!

3. The Slim Jim
Absolutely do not go there. Dry, flavourless, over salted. The meat in my patty was undercooked and smelled foul. There is no dressing, and it really could do with some ranch/bbq sauce. 

4. The Oozy Suzy
Fit for Adam Richman, this burger is not for the weak of heart. HUGE, cheesy patties between two buns. Not one for sparkling flavour but oh god the meat!

Recurring Problems:
- Thick cut (soggy) fries come with every order (along with a southwest dressing + coleslaw on the side). They really need to work on packaging the food to ensure crisp onion rings and fries. 
 - Delivery is an issue because this is a one man show with a pretty big clientele. I am yet to receive my order in time. The longest I have had to wait for the burgers was close to 5 hours, the shortest being 2. 
 - Coleslaw is clearly made in advance and lacks in freshness each time. They watered down the otherwise thick BBQ sauce which I hope was a temporary slip.

Despite its flaws this joint scores on novelty and portion size. It's a new place and one can tell it's still finding its way and ironing out the hiccups. Either way, I love their burgers and I hope they stick around (and hire more staff!)

Update of 16 November 2014

A similar order as of two days back with a Chicken Burger added in. A different experience today. For starters the delivery was on time! The French Fries were way better. The burgers were far smaller. I called them later and was informed the regular source for the buns did not have stock and these were sourced from elsewhere. Not nice! They should have informed prior to order. Secondly, I also found out that the Morning Joe actually does not come with a patty any longer (they have discontinued the patty)... once again should be informed, since the menu mentions patty. Finally this time the chicken in the chicken burger was too salty! The barbecue sauce seemed much nicer today.

---------------------

Update of 14 November 2014

Had neighbours drop by and we took this opportunity to try out Burger you for the second time. We were promised delivery in about 45 minutes, but this stretched to 1 hour 55 minutes. The delivery boy claimed to have been stopped by the cops on the way.

My neighbours tried out The Texin (rib steak patty, batter fried onion rings, barbecue sauce and salad). They were pretty pleased with it.

The Pulled Pork being over for the day, I asked for the Morning Joe (despite my wife's reservations on me having such varied meats). I was pleased as punch. There was baked beans, fries, bacon, grilled sausage, cheese and fried egg. Of this, the beans could have been avoided, they did not particularly add much to taste and being hard (probably Druk brand), it pulled the product down. The fries could have also been served on the side instead. No point overloading a burger and making it difficult to grab a mouthful. The bacon was good and the grilled sausage (custom made herbed pork sausage) awesome.   

Apart from the very late delivery, what rankled was the excess salt with the fries. Made it almost unpalatable. They have stopped serving cole slaw on the side and provided a thousand island like dip.

Great meal, good value. Now I shall plot and plan to create an opportunity for the next order :)

---------------------

After a few hits and misses (read as failed chances to order), I managed to get an opportunity to savour their offerings. Had looked at their Facebook page and was very tempted by what they offered.

They are located in Kasba and for the moment is delivery (and pick up) only. They seemed to have delivery limitations too, and my delivery time had to be adjusted into a free slot.

We had asked for three burgers. The chicken burger was consumed by my better half. She said it was decent, but did not seem ecstatic about it.

My father and I shared a Pulled Pork Sandwich and a Slim Jim. Was not too impressed with the latter. It was dry and did not taste flavourful at all. The Pulled Pork was another story. Small and delectable pork pieces (of the slow-cooked variety) graced the inside and made for a very satisfying meal. The menu has other items I am itching to try. Only  issue is the minimum Rs 600 delivery amount!

All burgers were accompanied by cole slaw (could have been made better - seemed to have given out water) packed in plastic pouches and very soggy fries. The fries can be better packed to retain crispness. Also some more fries would be most welcome.

Quantities looked small when they came, but order filled our stomachs rather well as promised.

Well worth a try foodies... please insist on the pulled pork sandwich, among others :-) Which reminds me, its time for a reorder.

How I wish it was closer so I could just walk in and have a burger.
