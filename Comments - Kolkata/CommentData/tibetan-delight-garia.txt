A small place which serves good garlic chicken and mixed non-veg rice noodles and fried rice, most suitable for days when cooking looks like a tiresome job and a quick pick up lightens the mood. 
I have known this place for a long time and had been ordering food from them when they were in a different location - a bit away from the present one. They didn't serve mughlai items then.
The biryani is so so and the paneer served here are the freshest. I am a bit wary of their fish preparations - never liked the fish that been used. But the chicken used are fresh, and they have maintained the quality so far.
Home delivery is not available everyday so one has to confirm before placing the order.

Not upto my expectation as i have heard about it. Ordered thupka, momo and fried rice. Food was average. Price is reasonable but should consider improvising it's food quality.

I had visit a long time ago n nothing has been changed except price of the menu.Its nothing bt a pati(very simple) roller dokan. Do u ever heard Polao is a Tibetan dish?Tough this place is not the first guilty about their names bt there is so many outlet where u see such intentional mistakes bt pls do some justice to taste of dishes.We tried chow n dishearten as u can get better/same in any footpatiya roll counter in 40% cheaper.Only they give you a seating arrangements.
My own view to all petuks that real food lover never look after the decorations, seating arrangements, acs etc they only matters about the quality n quantity.

We had and took away food so many times from them even we gave bulk order for our x-office picnic as the spot was very near to it and situated near to our flat...I don't know about recent taste...but before replacing the restaurant the quantity and taste was just awesome... their chinese is really good...their fried rice chilli chicken mainly schezwan chicken and chilli paneer was really tasty...worthy to choose and gave the order to them...theit taste didn't let us down infront of our colleagues and boss...

This place is just a no-no! The food here is bad with no distinct taste- a schezwan chicken and chilli chicken at this place will taste the same. The fried rice and noodles are still okay, but the place is purely avoidable!

Excellent Restaurant. Great Food. The restaurant owner is a young Nepali guy , who is also the chef runs the joint along with his wife.
People who likes Street Food...Those who can enjoy it by its own taste ( not compare this joint with BarBQue )..for them its an ideal place for their gastronomic delight.
Never felt sick having any of their foods.
Bon Appetite !
Please note this is NOT a to be 'Home Delivered' Restaurant. 
Instead go and grab it...There Take Away service is really fast.
You can sit and eat even if you want, but for 'fault finding' kind of people- it is not advisable, else the ambience is just okay.

Please black list this restaurant and do not promote as I have tried ordering online 2-3 times, they don't respond for initial 3-5 calls and then they say "we don't have person to deliver, so do keep calling us" 

Ridiculous ----------- ensure to highlight places who genuinely serve ..........

Its pretty boring to sit inside this joint unless you are with your girl as the ambience is really dull. When it comes to food, i would rather say its decent enough for the price range and keeping in mind the location. I would recommend Shanghai fried rice and chicken fried along with lemon chicken boneless, they are pretty good at it. :)
