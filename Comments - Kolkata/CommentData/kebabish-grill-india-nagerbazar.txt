Don't waste your money here.. there are plenty of places you can order from in this price. They served Chinese chicken pieces from some other dish in my biryani. Just pathetic.

This place is located very close to the ordinance factory. 
Ambience shouldn't be in mind if u r visiting this place.
This place offers food at cheap prices.
I only tried the fish tempura fry and it was quite nice.
Other things I can't comment on.
The owner of this place is extremely friendly and we'll spoken.
Would definitely like to visit it again.

We ordered three things. Chelo kebab, Hakka noodles and reshmi kebab. 
The chelo kebab had three kebabs which was hard and the rice was very dry. My friend couldn't have half the rice.
The Hakka noodles had a smell for which we had to exchange it with another plate of chelo kebab.
The reshmi kebab was again hard. 
Overall hated it. Waste of money. The restaurant is inside a garage and you could see worms on its floors moving around. Will never go there again.

Visited this small eating joint few days back, after going through the reviews. Located near Ordnance factory Dumdum, well this place has definitely got the varieties of quick bites. We tasted the egg chicken schezwan noodles and Japanese tempura (Basa Fish). Food is not out of the world though, but surely you can try once. Quantity is good and the pocket pinch is also very cheap.

Found out about the place through zomato. I was literally shocked to see such a great variety of food being offered, all in the maximum price range of ₹100. We ordered food by calling, so can't say about the place itself, but as far as I know through zomato, it does not have proper sitting arrangement. They provide home delivery on orders above ₹300. First tried their chelo kebab, and hariyali kebab. It took almost 2 hours to come through their own delivery service. Hariyali kebab was yummy. 5 pieces for ₹100. The chelo kebab was okayish. It contained butter rice, 3 types of kebab, and a fried egg. Quantity was enough for 1 person. Then had chelo kebab and chilli chicken combo for the second time. The combo was not at all tasty. Quantity was ok. The kebabs in the chelo kebab were cold and hard. Though the rice was better than previous time.
Overall, it is a place for quick grabs when you are short on money and want food which is quantity wise enough. The food is not the best but at this price range, you can't really complain.

Ordered through swiggy so can only comment on the food. We ordered for a chello kebab and sunehri murg tikka. Both the items are 100rs each.
The chello kebab was quite nice, please don't compare it with the chello kebab from Peter cat. 😃
There was a good portion of rice with 3 pieces of kebab and a sunny side up egg. The sunehri tikka had 6 pieces and was ok. Both the kebabs were very dry.
Its definitely value for money but there are better options for kebab.

Well, I have been to here for at least 10 times and place is one of my favourites due to its pan fried chicken momos. Obviously its inside a garage place so cant expect a hotel type ambience inside it. But its well decorated according to its size. And I will recommend everyone to try out the Afghani Tandoor Chicken and Chelo Kebab plate and also reshmi kebab. The ratio of cost to quality is good and also the amount.

Firstly The chicken tandoori was AVG at best. Now coming to what they called Mutton Galawati Kebab. It was horrible. Looked like Dung Cakes and tasted like one too. How could they come up with such a recipe and still convincingly manage to call it something which is such a delicacy like Galawati Kebab.

I saw some reviews before going there and they said that the location is very hard to find, but it's basically as easy as finding Diamond Plaza from nagerbazar. Buses and autos are there plus it's just the straight way.
Now coming to the restaurant, it's a tiny garage decorated with some chair tables and some more things. Despite of it's size, the restaurant has a very homely feeling inside. I went with some of my friends and there were no one else and we could have fun in our way. So thumbs up for that.
The food price is unbelievably low so I was in doubt at first about the quality. But they serve the food hot and fresh and they are much more we could have got on that price. One drawback that I got is the extra use of cloves in every dish that spoiled the flavour a bit. Make sure to forbid them about it before cooking.
Overall I liked the places and the food. So if you have much time in hands and need to spend it well, it would be a nice place for you.
And yes, make sure to bring some water or cold drinks because they don't provide it.

So I was on my trip to Kolkata and found this place on zomato and immediately decided to drop in here. I went there and the place was easily locate-able. Small outlet with outdoor seating on stools. I ordered Reshmi Kebab and it was amazing. A little hard but full of flavour. The owner uncle was so sweet, helpful and friendly. He shared so many stories about his life and introduced me to his brother and wife. While talking to him, I ordered Pan fried chicken momos and those were out of the world. I actually got them packed for Mumbai and they packed it really well so that it stays good for about 5 hours. The chef is amazing!! He knows his job right and no wonder why this place is so popular!!

My first experience with their food is not at all impressive. I ordered 2 plates of SUNEHRI MURGH TIKKA KABAB and I am very disappointed with the kababs they served.
The kababs were not marinated at all, it was stiff and neither it tasted well. God knows what spices did they use for making it. Apart from salt I couldn't perceive any other taste. The pudina chutney was even worse.

Kebabish grill India please don't make kebabs, change your name as well. 99 rupees doesn't matter really but the food served was disgusting. Don't sell food at rupees 99 if not well prepared, charge what is reasonable and prepare good food.
They don't have seating arrangements so anyone willing to order have to order online.
Please don't try their kababs. Rather save the money and visit other eateries. Total waste of money!

I have had many dishes from this place and naming them all would be tedious. So I will tell you the ones that top my list. The momos are good enough. Obviously you shouldn't compare them with momos from WOW MOMO... but you cannot get better momo any cheaper than this. I personally am very fond of the momos here. The kebabs are good. The combos are okayish, just because of poor rice. The quality of rice is good but this place just doesn't know how to make good  fried rice and any other variations. I think they should add combos with naans or rotis. Chelo Kebab is quite good. The best thing about this place is that they offer good food at an amazingly reduced price. This is definitely a frequent go to place for me, The recommended dish here is Shawarma Roll but I would suggest Chicken Shawarma Wrap at the Lebanese Junction of Hatibagan (https://www.zomato.com/kolkata/lebanese-junction-hatibagan) which has a base price of 110 /- and is much bigger and filling than the one you get here. I would rather put momos and Chelo Kebab as a recommended dish for this place.

We tried as per their recommendation Fish tempura and Chicken Sunheri Kebab and one more fish tikka but I don't remember the exact name. Quantity is okay as per the price but I did not like the food much, it was just normal. Kebabs were better than the tempura.

kebabish Grill India is just a name and way too much to offer. Best to opt for takeaway or delivery they just charge 1rupee extra for packing. Crazy multi cuisine food for affordable rates. It attracts a big crowd. A testament to its good food. 

They have an extensive menu, we ordered for Chicken shawarma roll, Persian chello kebab, reshmi kebab, galauti kebab, Fish tempura and honey glazed chicken lollipop. Such yummy food. Yet to try many other dishes. For all the food lovers you have to try once and you are sure to get addicted.

Location is not so advantageous it's on the way from Nagerbazar to airport. No proper sitting arrangement. Very welcoming and friendly people.

This is a takeaway counter. We had ordered for home delivery. The service was good, but the food is pretty average. Too much use of black pepper and test is also average. I will not say poor, but don't keep high expectations.

Its located on the main road next to the gun factory on Jessore road.This place serves pretty good kebabs and shawarma roll at very reasonable prices.serving quantities are also pretty decent.they also have a lot of variety I'm their menu.the owner is quite enterprising and is more or less always seen there striking up conversation with customers.it is basically a takeaway joint but they've turned a garage into a cute small seating area.overall a great place for tasty filling snacks at very reasonable prices..

Firstly it is mostly a takeaway joint. But still if you want to sit and hangout with 2 friends then they have the cute little garage turned into seating area. It is very cosy and gastronomically decorated.
Now let's come to the food.
You will not get better variety and quality of food at this price point(F - 100, H - 50 , any dish). Period!
I have tried their shawarma, falafel, doner salad, doner burger, momos, chello kabab, tempura fish and let me tell you. All these dishes are made in proper way that they are supposed to be. Like for the falafel and shawarma they use good quality pita bread and give huge quantity of filling (no cost cutting measures). The chello kabab is a beauty. You would not expect it to be like peter cat at 100rs. But it is pretty complete meal for an average person, with 3 kababs, 1 egg poach and butter rice. All the other dishes are also equally well made.
The best thing is the owner though. Such a warm and welcom8ng person there. Always likes to smile.and chat a bit.
In all i would recommend highly of these place in the dum dum area!

Best for take away, located adjacent to the SBI bank, this is a Gem, like the name suggests they serve some really delicious kebabs, must mention the Pan Fried momos and the Mutton karai kofta combo and all at a price point hard to overlook @100 a dish, the owner being a really friendly man this is a good snack joint... Please note that chelo kebab is best left for the founder and might be the only downside here.

This newly launched restaurant is actually pretty good and reasonable priced. I had decided to try the chelo kebabs and mutton kofta one with the momos as starters. Everything was pretty decent considering the price of each dish. Also the serving and packaging quality is quite good. The only thing that's lagging is that the 3 kebabs in the chelo kebab meals were a little bit dry. The minced meat mutton kofta was delicious and flawless , as were the momos.

The story started long back. Had found it nearly 1.5 years ago in hidden gems in zomato. It was in the wishlist from then. And the visit never occurred from then.
Today suddenly we decided let's go there, and we knew there is no sitting available. 
So on the litter rainy, n breezy weather we atlst reach there.

Location: near the gun n cell factory , take auto r bus from airport. It's on the way to nagerbazar.

Take away: they are known for the take away. To our surprise we have found they have a small sitting arrangement, and it was just enough for us.

Now just jump to the food items:

1. Tempura fish : excellent one. 4 pieces. Quality and taste just superb.

2. Honey chicken lolipop: very very nice. The best part is it had the honey taste with spiced chilly. 

3. Bar b q wings: I would say good one. But what I flt if the items is less fried, it would be juicy n more tastey.

4. Prwan Pakora: it was just perfect on the rainy day. Very good. Owwsum.

5. Lahori fish fry: just owsum. 4 pieces with mustard sauce. Perfect.

6. Mustard chicken kebab: a good initiative. Okay type to me. Would me more tastier if chicken is a bit more soft.

Now, why a full rating? 
Because they deserve. Each item is 100 rs each, what can u ask for more, when they are that tastey and quantity is just perfect.

I had thought to give it 4.5, extra is just for their value for money and the hospitality of d owner.

Animesh ( not sure if a got d name correctly), but this is to the great host : man u r owsum and ur team also. I was thinking earlier why it is a hidden gem. I got the answer today, u and ur team are just superb.

Keep up the good work. This is just a start, long way to go. And it will b, for sure. Cheers :)

To all: one of d best pocket Friendly food outlet, offer just amazing food. So, do give a visit.

I had only ordered fish tempura and doner salad.  My bad that I mistook doner salad with doner kebab.  So that was my mistake.  This one was a mix of vegetables with few pieces of shawarma chicken in meyonise  Not so delectable.  But the fish Tempura was good and they were quick and courteous as well.  Overall I think this place is OK if you wish to keep the budget tight.

AVOID this place at ALL COSTS! I will go the extent of saying that even if they are providing food for FREE, please do not visit.

Alas, there is no negative scoring system available. Apart from the pricing, a smooth talking owner and an attractive menu, the food is absolutely not worth any mention. Tasted their swarma rolls, kebabs, momos, keema balls in gravy and rice... except for the rolls, everything was a waste of money and time. Suggest have some pani puri instead of going here for a snack. The owners have tried to bring home some exotic flavours of the middle east and failed miserably. Having travelled across the length and breadth of the entire middle east, I am in position to state so. Inexperience shows!

The best part about this restaurant is its price structure. We all feel like having kebabs but 6 or 8 piece kebab is generally too much,on the pocket more so than on stomach. 😝  This place offers 2 piece kebab at really reasonable rate,so no point in delaying you kebab craving in search for an occasion or a partner. 
Food although nothing exceptional tastes pretty good. There happen to have some nice combos as well which are economical and filling. This restaurant has been made with people who are always running short of money to eat. 
I would rate their kebabs over other food items and they happen to make some really spicy gravy,so give instructions accordingly. 
Worth trying out,the menu is something which makes you feel like eating,and the food does not disappoint you either.

A nice hangout with a variety of snacks and finger food. It's easy locate, being right next to the Ordinance Factory on Jessore Road.
The food is flavoursome and the prices are bang on.
Must try the fish tempura and chicken. Having said that the kebabs themselves are a bit disappointing, some were soft and juicy while others were marinated pieces of rubber. The cooking is inconsistent. This place has the potential but lacks the execution.

Went there today
Ordered 3 items
Fried rice chilli chicken combo
Chicken doner salad
Fish tempura..

Doner salad was great with carrots onions cucumber Bell papers and chunks of chicken mixed with dollops of mayonnaise..
Fish tempura is basically basa fish covered with batter and deep fried ,the main thing was the sauce..fiery hot but equally tasty..

Fried rice chilli chicken is above average,chicken was a bit salty to my taste but it's okay.

Food is great ,pocket pinch on lower side.
The owner is friendly.
Though I would suggest you to opt for takeaway because though they have some chairs to sit it won't be that comfortable..

Next time will visit in afternoon to taste their kebabs..

If you want to sit there and eat, sorry to inform you but the sitting arrangement is not that good.. Although it's more like a shop than a restaurant.. So if you want to buy the food and bring it home and eat, it's the best place..

My friend told me about this place for good momos and I thought of dropping here. Well the place is good. Not a great ambiance to talk about but it is clean and the services is good. We ordered pan fried momos which came without us waiting for more. Momos are good not great and could have been better. I would be better if they can add good table chair to make people more comfortable and also if they could serve food in dish plates.

Well I had gone there seeing the high rating. Well not that I am disappointed, but definitely things can go up a notch. It is located very near to ordinance factory, dum dum. It has a small eating place, nothing fancy, just some tea tables and chairs and a tv inside a garage. We had the steam momos,fish tempura and honey glazed lollypop. Well the momos could have done with a little bit more of juiciness. It was good compared to the stuff we get in dum dum and wow momo shops , but nothing worth remembering. The stuffing could have been done with a little more of taste hitting you,fish tempura which my friend recommended, has become kind of fish finger , only the crust is different. I liked te fact that the fish was a little under cooked as it is the way Japanese people like, but the pieces need to be a lot more sauted and use of more sesame seeds would have definitely made it more flavoured. The honey glazed chicken could have been made a little more sweeter, considering it has the keywords honey and the crust could have been more thinner. But I would go back to this place again , just because te price is alright and you don't get such variety of foods anywhere in dum dum and in a palatable way too. Kudos to the team behind this.

The rating is more because for the concept than the food itself. They serve a variety of food which is solely missing in dum dum. The price is also moderate . I had tried the fish tempura and the momos and shawarma. Tempura was a very new thing i tried , and am not exactly sure about the taste. I may or may not give it a second try. Shawarmas were okay. We have had better shawarmas  in south. And the momos were not at all juicy and the stuffings were not upto my taste. But i would definitely come again . And i must mention about the staffs and the owner who were very warm and polite.

If you are looking for cheap and tasty kebabs , this is the place for you . Located near the Dum Dum ordnance factory bus stand , the owners have turned a garage into a restaurant . 
Coming to the food , I had ordered 1 plate of Chicken Reshmi Kebab , 1 plate of Chicken Hariyali Kebab and 2 plates of Paneer Tikka . Some of the pieces in Hariyali Kebab were not tender . The Paneer Tikka needed more salt . The Reshmi Kebab tasted really good . 
All this cost 400 bucks only . Courteous staff is also a plus point .

Visited this food joint yesterday. Well I too have been hearing great stuff about this place and well it turns out to be true. It is quite easy to spot. The menu itself is the biggest delight. Students, this place is tailor made for you.
The menu is quite versatile and they are cheap. Kebab lovers will find this place adorable. Kebabs are really good, swarma rolls are also great( Specifically mentioning these because I ordered these only during my first visit). Most of the menu comes in two categories. Half plate fr rs 49 and full plate for 99.
The restaurant has very simple theme. It seems like a garage, been transformed in a restaurant. The walls are decorated with fun messages. The restaurant owner is very friendly.  In my case, when I was there, the food took quite sometime to be prepared  so that was a bit disappointing but the food more than made up for it. :)

Taste: 3.5/5
Quantity:3/5
Quality: 4/5
Location:3.5/5
Value for money: 4.5/5

Looking forward to visit again.

Kebabish Grill India is a newly opened quick bite center located in Jessore Road. Its straight from ILS Hospital flyover towards Airport. The location is little off. As the name says you will find lots of Kebab dishes to choose from.

Beside the kitchen a garage is converted into a dining with small sittings, a led in front & some motivating posters on wall. All this makes it a cozy simple dining but unfortunately A.C is missing so its little difficult to be there in summer days.

Foods : They have made a world tour over here, I mean their menu card offers Turkish, Afghani, American, Mughlai, Japanese, Chinese all of them. So there is something for everyone & for every mood. All of their foods are served in an aluminum foil packaging & its self service.

Chicken Doner Salad : Lots of colorful vegetables mixed with mayonnaise & baked chicken. It was full of Cucumber than any other vegetables. The quality of mayo used were excellent, Ahh, it was Del Monte can be felt very well. Relatively less chicken pieces were there but somehow it tasted good.

Fish Tempura : Fish Tempura looked extremely delicious, but it made my eyes & nose watering rather than my mouth. The fish inside was fresh & very well steamed that felt like cream in the mouth. However the reason for crying was the firey sauce used made it extremely hot & spicy that basically hides each & every taste that it had.

Tandoori Chicken Indian & Afghani : Indian & Afghani Tandoori was best of both worlds. Starts with the Indian one, it was completely different than the tandoori chicken you get in Aminia, Arsalan & other famous Indian restaurants. I mean the freshness of it, the excellent spices used & the way it was grilled everything was so perfect & so good. The Chicken piece was bigger than usual but little oily. It was full of spices & that made its taste overflown from every angle. It tasted absolutely excellent that made me just Wow. On the other hand the same things applied on the Afghani tandoori too. But this one was less spicy. It tasted very light & perfect for non spicy lovers. Both the Tandoori tasted awesome & its a must try over here.

Conclusion : Each & every item looks so delicious over here that you will wish to try them all. Actually with the brilliant combos & only Rs. 49 or 99 pricing you can try them all. One thing is for sure that they are not focused on professionalism but what they are focusing is on perfectionism.

Read about this place on zomato, ordered for chicken shawarmas and a combo of fried rice and chilly chicken, the shawarmas were excellent, chicken was succulent and not very chewy, but the disappointing part was the fried rice and chilly chicken combo, it was not that great, it looked great but cannot say the same about the taste, but would love to try few other items as well in the near future. 
P.s:- the person who came to deliver was very cordial. 
I would like to rate individually,shawarmas-4.5 and the combo-3

Tried the pan fried chicken momos (super tasty, and quite spicy...managed to finish two small bottles of cold water but still couldn't resist them); tempura chicken (the tempura batter was really good and fluffy, properly done with soft chicken fried to perfection); fish and chips (they use the same tempura batter for it and i was happy with it and the fries had a spice mix added to it) and last but not the least, hummus (freshly made with a good hint of garlic).
This place has good food at crazy cheap prices with amiable service.
Definitely going back for more! 
Only the seating arrangement if improved, would be greatly appreciated... :)

Had a lot of expectations  from this place after reading  the reviews on Zomato.  Sorry to say I was utterly disappointed. Well on the positive  side is the pocket friendly  pricing.  What I have realised is that it's an okay place for snacks but main course is a big no no. Their chicken tikka masala  is the worst tikka masala that I have ever tasted.  I mean how can you even call that tikka masala! The kebabs were okay.

Kebabish Grill India!!
Located in between central jail & ordinance factory, a small joint qsr which is basically a garage I guess, the best part of the menu is all of them are less than 100 bucks!! We tried the kebabs here, which tastes different, you will get your product in an aluminium foil with salads :)

This small corner with humble wall hangings and delicious food with a reasonable price justifies a foodie soul and mind. The appetizing look of pan fried momo, the irresistible  shwarma wrap and the alluring fish tempura and all these without a pocket pinch made my day. This initiative deserves four out of five thumbs up and good wishes. 
Highly recommended..

Went to this place yesteday. A very small outlet and there is no proper arrangement of chair-table; all you have is some plastic stools and small tables(?). But that does not affect the taste of the food. Really happy tasting there hariyali kebab and steamed chicken momo. Both momos and kebabs are good is size and tastes succulent and fresh. Feeling really happy coming here and rating it only for the food;agree or disagree want to have some proper sitting arrangement.

Finally today I visited this place during lunch hour! Have noticed this eatery since long time on my way and people was also saying good in Zomato, so was waiting for my moment of truth!

Coming straight to food, in one word AWESOME!! We had CHICKEN SHAWARMA SALAD ( Full of chicken chunks, red and green capsicum, carrot, onion. Taste was really fresh and good. But I expected more white sauce in this), IRANI CHELO KEBAB ( Rich flavored Zafarn Rice with poached egg on top and 3 different kebabs. The taste of rice and kebab was simply mind blowing) and CHCIKEN HARIYALI KEBAB ( 5 chicken chunks coated with green chutney. It was served with freshly cut cucumbers and onion. Chicken chunks were well marinated and so juicy that they were almost melting in mouth. This dish was simply amazing).

Now Food was real good, but still I couldn't rate more than 3.5 because of their seating arrangement. I have no complain for the small place they have arranged or they don't have AC, but the place was not clean at all. It was full of flies and mosquitoes, the clothes on which they put the food boxes, were full with left over foods. we had to keep on scratching ourselves while having a great food, which is not a pleasant experience I took a bottle to have some water and a small piece of raw chicken was stuck at the outside of the bottle.

The food which you guys are serving, is real gem. Please don't spoil the show because of such issue which can be taken care easily.

N.B. Was too hungry to grab a pic!! Sorry :(

Been there twice with my husband and friends. They serve good kababs and sawarma roll at very minimum price. Fish fry is awesome. All items price 49/99. The staff are very co operative and service is really fast. Though they dont have much sitting provision, home delivery and take away are the options. Must try for every one.

This place is the bomb. I have ordered take out and ate in the car. The takeout is fast, friendly, and comes piping hot! I'm still blowing my curry after 10 minutes in on the takeout I have in front of me. The chicken tempura are outstanding. Maxed four in five minutes. The chicken shawarma roll; was divine! So delicious, good spice, and so flavorful. This food is fresh and the taste reflects it. Yum yum yum. 
The takeaway is quaint, clean and well decorated. Great ambiance and the owners are friendly and love to chat:) 

Great people, great food, great service.

I had earlier experience which wasn't pleasant enough 
However I went for the second time and did a takeaway.....this time.....
I took gelauti kebab and sunehri kurgh kebab
..
Honestly I did not have much expectations for gelauti kebab because I have ha dearlier in a luxury dining restaurant gelauti kebabs so that was superb....but yes it was not bad but certainly not great.....
However the sunehri murgh kebab was seriously seriously too good too good....and delicious......
and few points will be added for the nice decoration and the line written on the wall
It read "disturbing the chefs will lead to small portions" and the well placed kitchen and its decor was good....however go for takeaway

This small takeaway joint opened few months back. Its near to my house and the first day i gone through its menu i understood that this is an out of the box for the dum dum area. Seriously, such well and precise menu nd that too of different cuisines no one would have thought about few months back. 
Its located just after the Gun and shell factory and falls on the left if one is going towards Nagerbazar. 
The main plus point of this joint is that it is pocket friendly and can become a very good friend of the 'student' class.. :p
Another advantage is in here you will get everything on half and full portion basis.
Now out of all the menu till now i tried Chicken  shawarma wrap, Pan fried chicken momo and Haryali kebab.
Lets come to the food now - 
1. The Shawarma wrap is soo different from the ones we get in Go lebanese.. Like the meat was not properly roasted and not adequate amount of mayonnaise/tarini/hummus was there.
2. The filling of the momo was quiet good i would say but it  was soo Chilly that i could not  finish the full plate.
3. The Haryali kebab was a bit under cooked, just a bit and it tastes quiet ok. If you again compare it with Arsalan, Aminia or so on you will do a mistake. But within a price range of 100 its quiet good.
Thats all folks!! Untill i try some other dish.. :p

As the name goes, you get one of the best kebabs and that too at a pocket-friendly price at KEBABISH GRILL. A superb takeout for true foodies, this eatery takes minutest of care that apart from a superior quality food, they also provide you with an expert presentation. 

From the very mouthwatering GALAUTI KEBAB to the divine Japanese FIISH TEMPURA prepared in a way to suit Indian taste buds to the extremely tempting CHELO KEBABS, they have a wide range of delicious options and hence a single visit would not be enough. 

They also offer a half-plate option making it much easier for budget midriffs. Their momos are simply heavenly. Do not miss out on this roadside den. A must visit, go grab your plate now.

A very unlikely cuisine that is been prepared and served by the kebabish grill. Located just opposite to St Stephens school, jessore road - this place is never too crowded. A very very small room converted as a kitchen, starting from preparing the raw material to end up the delivery - everything in a single room - hardly 5 -6 people work over here, they don't have any sitting arrangements, just a few "Nilkamal" stools. Now after reading all this, you must be thinking, then is there anything good about this place? Of course - the food!! You cannot have such mouth melting lebanese rolls, you can't even think of any other shawarma salad centre after having here and that also in such a pocket friendly rate. So go ahead, have a roll or salad or pan fried momo and be merry!!

This joint is very close to my house so wanted to give it a try. I was pretty excited to see that the joint serves Lebanese food so ordered shawarma salad and momo. Firstly this is a take away joint. All the dishes are priced in a same manner which is rs. 100 (full plate) and 50 (half plate). I was very impressed with the momos which was really well made with a thin coating and ample amount of chicken filling and it had 10 pieces. The shawarma salad was a total miss as it was nothing like it rather it was plain chicken salad. The dish was totally dry and was not served with pita bread. I was utterly disappointed with the dish. The joint being fairly new it has room for improvement and I would like to try out the other dishes but not the Lebanese dishes.

A quiet joint with lots of aspirational menu and even more ambitious and challenging prices . The concept of a shawArma griller was itself an unique proposition at that vicinity . My ever curious and gastronomical soul coerced for a visit at the joint and truly it wasn't a feeling of guilt . The owner was rather very gregarious and unconsciously disposed my soul to order more than what I desired !!!! While he spoke about his own experiences in his days and achievements of his son he expressed his strong passion for food which is the true spirit of a good restaurateur . 
I followed his suggestion for galauti and I can bet that it was one with pedigree at the price . The fish tempura was just the right Japanese flavour that will satiate Indian taste buds . The Tibetan Thupka was Just as slurpy and crunchy that would give the old eatieries of Elgin road a run . While I don't intend to be critical , yet I can't resist expecting the chicken to be a tad soft unlike what was served . This is just the fall out of the expectations once you are pampered with taste at such exciting prices. 
Overall I really liked the place for the food and it's a fabulous  experience to chat with the senior owner while seeing you food being freshly skewed grilled and tossed .

There is no other resto in this area offering these dishes together under one shed; thus no competition. 
Behaviour was nice. Food was OK and not extraordinary. Shawarma roll can be improved; chicken was not soft and neither the pita/bread. I am sure with time this will improve.

This is a pretty decent place. The quality of the food is good. What you can not miss to notice is the honest effort to serve the best possible food for the price. Kebabs and pan fried momo are delicious.

A pretty unfamiliar place and a pretty decent find! The innovative prices alongside the even more innovative menu, that offers dishes from on different ends of the spectrum (and some in between), provides a truly gratifying experience. Although the Zaffran rice maybe a bit on the bland side of taste, the Kebabs are simply too good! The Hariyali Kebab, in particular, along with the Galauti Kebab, are splendid! You can try out the Fish Tempura (or chicken) if you so please. However, the surroundings are a tad on the untidy side. Pack your food here and head off on a drive.
And a piece of advice : avoid the Chelo Kebab! (Nobody ever comes in Radar coverage of Peter Cat on those grounds)

This place has created quite a bit of buzz already for its food and innovative pricing. Kebabish Grill India is basically a takeaway joint and quite conveniently located, very near to the Ordinance factory on Jessore Road. I had ordered fish tempura and chicken hariyali. Both the dishes were lip smackingly good, the kind that keeps you wanting for more. The owner seemed to be a friendly guy too. USP of this place is  the variety of food and its prices. Anything for 50 (half a plate) and 100 (full) bucks. I will be back for sure. Cheers !!!

Probably among the only decent places to grab a bite to eat in Dum Dum. One of my pet peeves was that there was no real place to get some decent stuff to eat near my place other than restaurants which charge a lot and don't deliver. 

So when this place opened up, I was surprised at the variety of their menu at such a decent price - and they have certainly not disappointed with the execution. I tried their schwarma roll, chicken tandoori (honestly among the best I have had in this area) and chicken doner salad on multiple occasions and the food really makes you want to come back. The food is prepared really well and the value for money is excellent. I would whole heartedly recommend this place to anyone.

I always wanted such a thing in my neighbourhood and my wish got granted! I discovered this awesome place to order lip smacking dishes close to my home. Though I discovered it late, I am going make the most of it in the next 15 days that I have in this city.
Today evening I tasted three of their dishes and they were impressive. Firstly I had a Shwarma Roll followed by Fish Tempura and Chicken wings with fries. All of them tasted good and so they totally deserve a thumbs up from me.
Looking forward to try other dishes from their menu.

The food of this restaurant is fantastic. It's finger liking good. But the quantity is less. The reshmi kebabs I bought yesterday were small. But anyway they are delicious.

Finally a close place to my home where you can eat good food and you don't have to worry about your wallet too much. I am one of their regulars, and the food here is great. The best part, almost all the dishes have a fixed rate : Rs.50 for half plate and Rs.100 for full. Personally I love their shawarma salad with mayo and jalapenos, chicken thupka and pan fried momo. The shawarma salad is filling, easy on the pocket and is delicious at the same time. The chicken thupka is different from what I have had generally. You get good chunks of veggies and chicken, along with quite a good amount of noodles. Again, filling and easy on pocket. The pan fried momos are simply awesome. One of the best I have had. Not smothered in loads of sauce, but just the right amount. The only thing that was disappointing was that they don't serve soup with steamed momo. Apart from that, whatever I have tasted, I loved that. Definitely worth a try.

Kudos to this joint for bringing such excellent food in this part of Kolkata. Tried their Galuti kabab, reshmi tikka and chicken donar salad. All of them were real good and hope to visit this place more often. The owner of this place knows his subject very well.......

Visited this place as it is close to my friend's place. The best thing about this place is its pocket pinch. It is pocket friendly to the point of wow. I had chicken wings and fried and both the taste and the quantity was more than satisfying. The behaviour of the people involved is such that you'll immediately feel elated. In short, love this place!

I don't know where to start from because I am confused about the starting point.  Each and every item pitches the hardcore effort and love nourished with care indulged to stand on its own. All the items are signature. 

Some items to have without fail...

1)  Shawarma Salad and Roll
2)  Chello Kabab
3)  Galauti (mutton only) Kabab
4)  Tempura (chicken only)
5)  Schezwan Tandoori
6)  Fried Chicken Wings
7)  PAN Fried FINGER LICKING              Momo's

 Last but not the least... 

8) Feeling with the warmth 3 in 1 Thukpa.
