How far can you deliver??? Is it too far away. Complete nonsense. I once came to your restaurant. You guys dont have sense how to behave with the customer. I would like to give you 0 rating.

Chicken and Mutton Biryani is ok...still won't consider value for money...almost identical to road side Biryani's. Ambiance is ok.. No there is no free wifi. No additional taxes or service charge

Worst and overpriced food, bought 2 mutton kachi biriyani where skimmed bones were given in the name of mutton with completely uncooked rice and potatoes. FOUND HAIR IN FOOD. When contacted staff said they can replace the rice only if the packet is untouched and carried in as it is. Normal mutton briyani in available for Rs. 90 only in 3 shops in the same locality within a radius of 100 mts. STRONGLY NOT RECOMMEND THIS WORST AND OVERPRICED BOSE BIRIYANI.
