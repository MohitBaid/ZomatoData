At the starting of this review, i make it clear that i have not dined there. I went there and bought biriyani, both chicken and mutton, packed for home. So i shall not give complete review. Well the staff i faced was good, and the food quality and quantity  was also good. On this basis i have rated. Next time i visit i will complete this review for sure.

Though my earlier experience of Chinese food over here was not that great. This time I went to have their Bengali Lunch Thali and it was quite a good quality as per the price. I had opted for a Fish Thali, which includes Rice, Dal, Bhaja, 2 Sabjis, Katla Curry & Chatni. One can also take a second serving of the items, but the quantity was good enough for a person. Loved the food, it was yumm. Food was fresh and the fish piece was quite a big one. Veg Thali - 55, Fish Thali - 75, Chicken Thali - 95, Mutton Thali - 130. They also give you a home delivery service free of charge. Now comes the ambience, which is absolutely neat and clean, spick and span. Service is exceptionally superb, starting from the manager/owner who was at the cash to the waiter, each and everyone was really polite. I also got to know that they are starting their Confectionary from 15th of December. Would like to try that too. I will seriously go back to this place for their Lunch Thalis.

This place serves good chicken steam momos... And their quality and quantity of main course is pretty good. But I feel this place is a bit too pricey than its  service. The delivery of food is also slow.

The most amazing fusion food available in behala! I ordered chicken grilled satey kebab, Mexican rice with chicken sausage and prawn, and fudge brownie with hot chocolate through swiggy and the bill came upto 360 which was quite reasonable as per the quality and quantity of the food. For this amazing eating experience I would give Bong Fusion :
Quality : 10/10
Quantity : 10/10
Taste : 9/10
Packaging : 8/10
Price : 9/10
Guys do visit this place or you can order but do not miss out on Fudge brownie with hot chocolate, trust me it's a must have ; )

I visited some days back...and ordered chicken 65. What I was given was nothing near to the original dish I have tried at other places, but deep fried thin slices of chicken. It was tasteless.then came the bill.they charged me 10% of service charge.when I said it not mandatory to pay it, they rudely said it was GST. I asked for their GST NUMBER , they said they have applied for it. Don't go...they cheat both on food and the bill. Very disappointed.

Heard so many tales about this place and their food but wasn't satisfied with it.
Located at parnashree bus stand so you will have no headache finding it. The cooking area is located in the ground floor and I think it also serves as the delivery counter. On the 1st floor there is the seating area. It seems nice with right kind of decoration . Seats are ok and so is the cleanliness of the place. Serving person are prompt.
Coming to the food we ordered a crispy type of chicken as starter which was really good. Next came the main course for which I ordered Chicken Stroganoff as I really liked this dish but as the dish arrived I found it to be something completely different from what I've thought of. This is the dish I have tried in 3-4 other places but this one was completely different. Tasted ok but not that good. Plus the color was completely different from all those other places. Ordered one more similar dish but a different one but seriously could not find any difference between the two other than a 1 or 2 vegetables. Taste was more or less the same.Ordered fish fry too, it was ok.
Their menu is  elaborate but if all of them taste same then people won't find a reason to go there and order all.

Bhuna Tangy Chicken - The gravy was good.
Non Veg Green Garlic Pan Fried - This is also good in taste and with the green veg paste and garlic flavour.
Gandharaj Fish Tikka - this item tasted good but frankly didnt get the Gandharaj flavour.

Overall a very good experience..

Bong Fusion Cafe is this small outlet that got opened at the mouth of Parnashree. Food here is average. I ordered their Chicken Gravy Noodles. Honestly, I was not impressed much. Although the quality of food is not up there, the restaurant's location can fix that. The menu sets the place apart. The only thing that needs to be done is- getting the flavour in the food.

For a place like Behala, the very fact of having a reasonable continental restaurant is indeed a gift. And undeniably Bong Fusion defines that. My Yum-recommendations are cheese pasta, Chicken Steak and Stroganoff. Quantity, Price and quality is satisfying. Yet, the only one thing that can be improved is training the staff members on the food items as continental foods are not a usual treat. Customers ( including myself) tend to ask about the constituents of the dishes and hence explaining them is necessary. Otherwise, I do not feel there are any rooms to complain for a food startup. Hopefully, the improvements shall be seen in the years to come. I will be happy to go for a generous 4.5/5 rating. Keep it up guys!

Like the name suggests, this is a fusion restaurant newly opened at Parnasree Bus Stand. 10 minutes walk from my place, hence I have tried their food thrice already. Experience so far has been fair. I loved the ambiance. First time at Parnasree, a restaurant with such ambiance and theme has come up. Wonderful lighting, great snaps put up on the walls, which does justice to the theme, and slightly 'loud to the ears' music playing at the background. The owner and staff are quite friendly. The owner having known me through Zomato, came and introduced himself. Nice gesture. The space is not that great, but very effectively and well utilized. They can seat around 30 at a time, if I have noticed correctly. Impressive service time.

Coming to the food, I really loved the Chicken Steak. A whole big chunk of meat, comes with an unusual stuffing, which I have never seen elsewhere. Probably, that's the USP of this steak. Tasted brilliant. A must try for Conti lovers. You guys have earned a regular customer through this dish only. Secondly, I like their Fried Rice too. Quite tasty and good portions. My girlfriend found a strong smell in the Hot Garlic Fish though, could be an issue with the freshness of the fish. Remember having tried Lamb Mandarin, ordered through Swiggy once, which was fine, and same for Kung Pao Chicken. The prices are quite reasonable.

Disappointment: Bong Chicken Drumsticks. Too much flour stuffing in the drumsticks, which comes in 5 pieces in a plate. Price- 110 without any additional charges. I suggest, they can possibly increase the price a bit, if that's stopping them from serving good chunks of chicken, and try to make it 6 pieces in a plate. Usually people don't associate flour stuffing inside chicken drumsticks to regular restaurants. These are generally for fast food centers. And considering the taste the drumsticks had, sweet, tangy and spicy mix, which I actually liked, its a disappointment just because of chicken pieces. Useless in making the size big through stuffing, without having good chicken pieces inside. Really hope this feedback is given a thought and implemented. I would love to try the drumsticks again if it is.

This restaurant is a good startup and I am glad they have opened up at Parnasree. But it would need to maintain and better itself by the day, to keep up with the competition it would face with a couple of other nearby chinese restaurants which are well established. All the best.

*** I revise my rating from 3.5 to 2.5 as they have added Service Charge at 10% to the food bill. In a locality like Parnasree it's not justifiable.

decent food but nothing exceptional. the whole setup has a space shortage and so doesn't look very tidy and hygienic. but I suppose that's same for most small road side cafe restaurants. so one shouldn't expect more than the normal. food isn't bad though. service is also normally good. sitting area, being on the first floor, is luckily cut off from the street noise. its peaceful with dim lights for a nice sit and chat. variety in the menu is also a positive. parking here is impossible. u have to find a place a little further down the street.

I and my friend had a lunch today at this place in the heart of parnasree. In a word it is wonderful. We ordered a chicken cacciatore, white sauce penne pasta, and a Napoleon's chicken marnigo. Quantity and quality was excellent. Napoleon's sauce was too good. Only thing i felt was the chickens were a bit stiff. Could be more juicy. Also great ambience and decor. Would surely visit again.

I ordered chicken bistro with herbs pilaf. A Mexican one. The cuisine comes with Chicken tossed in mushroom, wine and sauces. It was different and delicious. But the delivery was very late and disappointing. In addition the packaging was also poor. The gravy was spilled out of the aluminium foil. So overall a mixed experience.

I never thought, I'd write a review for a food joint located in my para. It's not because I'm high nosed, but most of them simply don't cut in to be reviewed. 
The concept of running a cafe in a place like parnasree (don't judge this place to be downscale, rather this is one place of heaven tucked in the twisted place called behala) always seemed a bit alien to me, cause the food scenario is thronged with street side pakoda, Chinese n momo stalls which always did satiate our hunger pangs and have huge fan following.
Anyways, this place, though fairly new has been well received by our community. A red shiny building opposite to the bus stand, my wife n I have frequented after every health walks we take in the adjacent park on weekend evenings.
The flight of cute little stairs will take you to the cosy little place with nice neon themed hanging bulbs on the individual tables.
The have an extensive menu, it's like they promise to make anything from a simple steamed momo to some kinda weird named Italian dish. Though they have this extensive menu, but their servers don't have the least ideas about most of the dishes.
As far as I remember I have tasted their Moroccan chicken (spicy tangy diced chicken dish), chicken roll, chicken steak sizzler, chicken grilled sandwich etc.
Last time we went, we ordered a plate of chicken steak sizzler(day special), chicken roll and cappuccino.
Their prep time is huge. So you'll have a lot of time to yourself, listening to the background scores of fossils.
The cappuccino was 3/4th foam and 1/4th coffee.
The chicken roll is served with French fries and tastes nice, juicy and meaty inside.
The chicken steak sizzler was surprisingly a peach. Less on the sizzle , a hearty piece of chicken covered sauce is served with buttered rice, sauted veggies and chicken skewers. The chicken steak was decent in size and cooked to perfection, the skewers though tasted a bit dry and out of tune went nice with the sauted veggies and rice. However, if the sauce was spread over the entire length of the dish rather than steak itself, it would've been better.
So all in all, a decent place to relax after an evening walk n eat some okayish food.

This place is a newly opened cafe/restaurant near my house. They offer Chinese and continental dishes along with different types of beverages. I went to this place today to checkout their food along with my friend Rohit. We ordered Chicken Steak and French type Full roasted Chicken, the quality of the food was very good and so was the quantity. The interior is very nicely maintained.

If you are hungry and you don't care about the food quality then u can try out Bong fusion cafe.
The menu card has all angrezi names...but the staff members have no idea of what it is. I asked for Carbonara sause for pasta and the waiter said "yeah it's the tomato red sause"... seriously dude...get your facts right.
The coffee was sub standard and I would even make a better coffee than the. The chicken steak was edible but the lamb steak was unbelievably bad. 
The ambience is good and the restaurant is pretty clean. They have pork in the menu but they didn't have a single pork item to serve.
Not a good pick.

Ordered through Swiggy. Noodles were soggy and unpalatable. Tried hard to find the prawns inside the batter of the golden fried prawns, Managed to find a few shells and no prawn. For Rs. 190/- an absolute rip off. Chicken steak with red wine was ok and pan fried smoked pork good. Overall experience disappointing and will not repeat.

The shiny, red building of  Bong Fusion Cafe is hard to miss if you are travelling to or from Parnashree in Behala, which also happens to be a very prime neighborhood and has seen more than a few food joints open up in the last couple of years. 
Two flights of stairs lead to the 20 seater (estimated) restaurant, which has a bengali fusion theme with Pop Culture pictures, portraits and candid photos all around the theme of Calcutta, with Bengali rock music playing in the background. 
We ordered Chicken Drumsticks, Four Topping Pizza (Non Veg) and a Fruits Salad with Ice cream. The chicken drumsticks were really good. They were really crispy on the outside and very soft from within. The amount of chicken used was larger than what we are used to and that was a pleasant surprise. I highly recommend you to try those. The four toppings Pizza on the other hand, tasted more like a home made pizza, which you and me would rustle up on a Sunday evening. The ingredients were fresh and there was plenty of cheese. The only thing that didnt click with me was that the quantity of ketchup on the pizza base was tad bit too much and overpowered the rest of the toppings. The pizza was about 6" in size. 
The fruit salad with ice cream was really delicious. There were fresh fruits in it like banana, apple, pomegranate surrounded by two huge dollops of two in one ice cream. And I was glad that they hadnt added any extra sugary syrups because that doesnt work for me. 
They have a lot of items on the menu. And the menu has spelling errors which I feel must be corrected as incorrect spellings create a cloudy impression. But when you serve great food, minor errors can be forgiven.
Looking forward to go back soon!

Bong Fusion Cafe is another cafe which has come up in Behala. There are so many restaurants and cafes which has entered Behala in last one year and this place is one of them. The name of the place itself gives you a hint of what they are serving. The place is serving continental and Bengali Snacks in a same place. Not only the food but the decor as well resembles the theme and make it look quite interesting. Its two days back when I found this place when I went to Behala Parnashree for some work.

Location:
This place is very easy to locate. Behala Parnashree Bus Stand and you reach your destination.

Ambience:
Well, I somehow liked the ambience of this cafe. The place is not that big but they have utilised the place in a good way and decorated pretty well with some simple things. The colourful lamp shades are eye catching and the photo frames gets the attraction. One of the walls has retro Kolkata photographs while the other has photographs of Western Bands of yesteryears. The fusion of photographs gives you the perfect idea of the theme.

Service:
The behaviour of the staffs are nice. But they need experience to be better. They are not as skillful as one should be and they should be lil more attentive on their work.

Food & Drink:
We took these items and this was our experience:
#Chocolate Bong Fusion : As the name says something so different, its nothing special. There was nothing bong in it and was just another chocolate shake which was not well made. The proportion of sweet was on the higher side and the shake lacked thickness.

#Chicken Manchow Soup: This was another basic Chinese Flavoured Soup with some crispy noodles over it. It was decent but nothing special.

#Chicken Steak With Red Wine and Mushroom Sauce: The dish was again a decent one with some positives and negatives in it. The Chicken had a nice flavour and tasted well. The quality of rice and the veggies accompanied with it was good too. On the other hand, the quality of chicken needs an improvement and the marination needs to be proper.

#Chicken Bristro with Herbs Pilaf: The gravy was on the sour side which I didn't like much. The chicken was not marinated well. It was hard and not juicy at all..

Last Words:
A mixed bag experience on my visit. Has a great scope in the area as there are not much restaurants which serves continental dishes. But there are improvement which needs to be done. A very new place and they will definitely do something.

3.5/5

This place is pretty close to my home and I have been quite excited to check them out ever since they opened up here. And after many hot Summer afternoons later, me and my friend decided to give this place a try. He got Chicken Momos and I got myself a Mango Tropical. My drink was amazing. It felt like cool yet melting pulpy heaven in my mouth. As for the momos,the one thing I would realy recommend is the soup they serve along with momos.Its hot, spicy and yet at the same time a bit mellow- perfectly complimenting the momos.
I loved the ambience of this place.From the Beatles,Pink Flyod photographs on the walls to the music and the lighting.
The staff helped us pick out what we exactly want to order though the food took a while to come- but its worth the wait.
P.S- This place might seem a bit pricey to some people but trust me its worth it.

It is located just in opposite side of parnasree bus stand. Decor is really good. The interior is decorated with pictures of retro Kolkata scenes and many photos showing the Bengali culture. I liked the collection of photos on the front wall. Coming to the food, they need to improve in this area a lot. Their burger is kind of scattered and not compact. Sandwich did not taste so good. Price is ok, but not at par with the quality of food they provide. The only thing I liked was the beverage part. Choclote shake was really good. Need to improve the food part. But they don't charge extra vat.
