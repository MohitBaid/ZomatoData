This place is situated in the lane just beside Asutosh College where previously Green Cafe was. It serves a wide range of food and most of them are pretty good. I tried the Chicken Kathi Roll and it was very tasty. The chicken was prepared beautifully and a tinge of achaar in it which made it even tastier. The prices are also quite reasonable for which I liked this place.

go to place for students of asutosh college. located just opposite to ccd . this place serves good rools and kebabs quantity and quality both are good . can surely have a visit to spend some time with friends which will not hurt your pocket . i have tried their chatpata keba and dry chilly chickn. the kebab was very good no complaints but the dry chilly chicken could have been better. rolls are also good .. their special biriyani contains huge amount of rice and lachha parathas are realy big in size

This place is just opposite to Asutosh College,and has a lot of place to sit and serves good Quality Roll and Biriyani.
The quantity of the biriyani could have been more.
Otherwise the taste is good and the service is quick as well.
They have launched their Chinese menu, really looking forward to it, surely visiting this place again

Situated at Hazra just behind the Asutosh College this place has come up recently. Went there during the pujas for dinner as most of the other places were running full. It is a non ac restaurant which can house around 20 people. Cleanliness and staff are decent enough. Food quality is also good and prices are very reasonable. We had biriyani and it tasted better than many of the more well known places. Overall a decent pocket friendly restaurant.

Decent place, newly opened. It stays usually empty but the space is clean and the staff courteous. 
The chicken kati roll is actually good with a flaky paratha and generous amount of spicy chicken tikka inside. Haven't tried the biriyani yet, but smells good alright. 
The only issue is that the place is not air conditioned. Also that, being so near to a college, they probably should have a made the menu a little more student-friendly, that is with more options on the menu that are easy on the pocket. 
Overall, if you're in the area and need a place to crash and don't care much for an AC, do visit here.

Well this Aala is actually a restaurant of Haldia city centre and their first branch in Kolkata. Situated right at the backside of Ashutosh college. I have tried their rolls. Egg roll was good in taste and the chicken rolls had good pieces of chicken and was quite tasty. Though I haven't tried their biryanis but have heard that they are quite good considering the price in which they are offering. The staffs are well behaved and they have a decent seating area but non AC. Will surely try their biryani.

The staffs are really friendly and great at their job. I ordered Chicken biryani. The food was fresh and the taste was good as well.
The only demerit is they don't have many options in the menu and the restaurant is strictly non vegetarian.

This food joint has come up behind the premises of Asutosh College. The menu apparently consists of rolls and parathas mainly, not much variation in the menu.
The spot is tight, well-lit with good interiors.
The food is quite good, loved the roll. The prices are reasonable too.
Guys, do check it out.
