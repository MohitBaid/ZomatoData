Though this place would appear to be very simplistic and one of those unhygienic mohalla wala sweet shops, but trust my words , their sweets are simply out of this world. It is now more than 10 years I have been visiting this shop twice in a year , whenever I hop down at Howrah between my journey from Chennai to Patna. Still the sheer purity and genuineness of the stuff remains the same!

Must try their Rosogolla and Mishti Doi!
