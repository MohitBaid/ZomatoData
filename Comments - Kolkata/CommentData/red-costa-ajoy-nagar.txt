Ordered food package charge shows rs20 but if you place same order from swiggy package charge is rs15.Its not about the 5rs but the way they handle the issue, very rude behaviour. Ordered pan fried gravy noodles got cantonese noodles instead which is white gravy.
When i say pan fried is dark gravy and cantonese is white gravy they argue that diffrence between panfried and cantonese is that pan fried has extra diced carrots and cantonese has diced vegetables.Bunch, always screw up my order, ordered tuna once got pompfret instead. These people scam customers in the name of container charges when i go to the restaurant to inquire about this they say talk to the manager but you never find the manager around. Avoid the place at all costs , there are better alternatives at same price range like Red Panda

EDIT:got to speak to the manager about the container issue he said talk to swiggy about it we have no idea, when i say i am going to put up a review regarding this in zomato he rudely says he doesnt mind even if i put up a review on facebook
Packaging charges are charged by the restaurant itself and not swiggy, the restaurant itself is supposed to be responsible for packaging queries.
Very unpleasant experience, used to be a frequent customer but will now avoid the place at all costs.

Ordered through Swiggy. This was truly a wonderful first time experience. I had requested them to add less amount of salt, which was fulfilled quite efficiently. The sweet n sour chicken was perfectly sweet as well as sour. The veg fried rice was perfectly prepared with low salt. The crispy chilli baby corn was crispy enough to tingle my taste buds. Looking forward to try other dishes as well

One Sunday morning a menu card arrived along with the newspaper. Casually going through that my eyes stopped in a section - 'Tribal Taste', which had tribal delicacies from Kerala, Orissa, Mangalore, Mizoram. Since my college days, I had friends from all over the country and heard a lot about their local cuisines but could never taste any. 'Red Costa' - located at Santoshpur was offering some of the rarest tribal cuisines.

The menu card came as a surprise and the very day I ordered dinner from them. Initially, I was worried about their taste and preparation- as it happens for most lesser known food joints- Â and on the first occasion ordered more conventional items. The excellent taste and aroma that filled their food soon make me order again and after that, they have become a regular supplier of my dinners.

They are specialised in all sorts of Asian Cuisine which includes a wide range of Noodles and Rice (the list have Singapore, Schezwan, Cantonese, Korean, Indonesian, Malaysian varieties) but their USP is certainly Tribal Delicacies. I have not seen any other restaurant in the city which focus so much on the Tribal Culinary.

Bansa Pora Mutton Rice(A Tribal Preparation from Odisha), Patra Pora Mutton(Tribal Preparation from Odisha),Â Ngatok(A Tribal Fish Preparation from North East), Kukhura Ko Masu(Nepali Style Chicken Preparation) are some unique items available there. Laaf Maas of Rajasthan, Arsa Chhum of Mizoram, Kori Gassi of Mangalore are some of the highly recommended items from the kitchen of Red Costa.

Apart from their list of tribal items my other favourites are their long list of seafoods. Octopus, Mackerel, Squid, Crab, Tuna, King Fish cooked in different traditional style with a variety of sauces are all heavenly in taste.

Â My personal favourite which I recommend very highly is Dragon Pepper Mackerel and Horse Mackerel. Let me come to the most important part now- how much will it cost you. I have been ordering dinner for two with changed items and it costs me around Rs. 500 every time - which I find extremely reasonable for the quality and quantity of their food.Â 

I was only taking home delivery and their service was extremely professional. They are one of those restaurants who keeps a good relationship with their customers and believes in making a bond. I have started receiving a new message every time they include an item to their menu. Soon I decided to visit the place and found it to be extremely well maintained and well decorated. Though it is not a very large set up for a couple or for a family dinner or lunch, it is just perfect. Expect a delightful hospitality each time you step in.

Please dont order appam and mutton stew thinking that its kerala appam as they have given in their menu. The so called appam is similar to dosa,not kerala style appam.

After trying twice from this outlet I'm really disappointed with the food ...simple masala dry fried squid was hard , the king fish fry was average. Not up to the expectations.There are other coastal and tribal food joints in Kolkata serving lip smacking food and great prices

Had heard so much about their Chinese. So decided to order from here rather than my staple Open Sesame Chinese.  Such a disappointment.  The man taking  the order was clueless about the menu.  He didn't know the difference between the items.  Sometime later he called back to say what we had ordered was not available. The only two words he seemed to know was Hunan and Kung Pao.

Just don't want to elaborate about my bad experience with food,  my ratings are enough to prove my disgust. They gave a stale Sardin fish instead of mackerel, with excessive salt. 
Highly not recommended.

Today I ordered for Chicken Singapore Pan Fried Noodles and Crispy Chilli Baby corn through Swiggy from this place. Being a regular customer I really use to like the Crispy Chilli Baby corn...so I ordered the same. Unfortunately the baby corns were nowhere crispy, rather they were soggy and tasteless. I never had this type of crispy baby corn in my entire life...it was that horrible. Very very disappointed with the food quality and taste. The restaurant has failed to maintain its food standards, hopefully they will take the feedback seriously and improve their food, because that area is full of restaurants and take aways....so watch out ....tough competition.

This place is a stone throw distance from my place. It is a small but neat looking place with limited seating. However, if you do not know of its existence it would be difficult for you to find the place. The pocket pinch is about Rs.500 for two people. The menu updated here perhaps misses some tribal items that the place offers like jadoh rice (mutton), bnash pora mutton, spicy stir fried squid etc. However we avail these mostly and have enjoyed the flavours.

Got the pamflet the other day in my house... Ordered food from them. And yes, it is very good regarding price and taste for home delivery. 
...Better than Fiesta regarding price for the same taste in this Santoshpur area. I ordered yesterday octopus in oyster chilli sauce that costed 240/-. Wonderful taste, for which I might have to pay 400/- Rs @Fiesta.
..And service was at exact time too...
So try this joint all zomatoans:)

They didn't even bother to deliver the food or inform us about the same.We kept calling at same phone no as giving in their menu card. 1st they didn't pick up the phone and when they did pick up said it's a wrong no.Worse restaurant ever. Never ever order food over phone or go to their place.I would give them 0 rating. Faltu restaurant

Whenever we feel like not eating at home, we order food from this joint. Their service is very quick and always deliver within 20-25mins. We usually order Chinese. I love their hunnan chicken and fried rice. However I find their kung pao chicken a bit too sweet. But it's still our favourite.

I loved this new place at Ajoynagar.. This is more of a food joint/restaurant so don't look into the ambience or decor that much.
We ordered crispy baby corn Beijing Chow, Chicken in black bean sauce and chicken fried rice all of which were properly made.They tasted very good and seemed quite fresh.. All in all I loved this new eatery and would surely come back to try something more in the future..

New Thai and Oriental places are always welcome, especially when they know their forte and charge extremely reasonably. Red Costa is quite conveniently located, just a two minute walk from Calcutta Green Towers at Ajoy Nagar, very close to the EM Bypass. 

The restaurant is a rather tiny, cozy 16 seater with a gracious host. On entering (with a few friends), we ordered some soft drink. As our eyes fell on the option of 'Tom Kha' under the soup section, we immediately decided on it. The Tom Kha arrived in ten minutes and it was a piping hot bowl of comfort! Off to a great start, we ordered ourselves starters. We settled on sampling Dragon Pepper Chicken. Crispy Ginger Fish and Crunchy Chicken in Hot Basil Sauce. Every one of these dishes were prepared with care. Dragon Pepper Chicken were the most favoured of the starters among most of us. The portions were such that we felt like we had to order the mains cautiously, so as to not overwhelm our appetite. Again, we decided upon Beijing Mixed Noodles (on the recommendation of the owner/host; this is not on the menu but can be prepared and served on request), Mixed Fortune Rice with Mushrooms, Tausi Chicken and Pla Gra Tiem. The egg wrapped rice called Fortune Rice and the beautiful and light Beijing Noodles were the perfect end to the meal. I, personally, have to mention the softness of the fish in Pla Gra Tiem (I am a self-proclaimed fish lover and nothing gets me going as surely as good quality fish cooked just right). Tausi chicken marinated in bamboo shoots (ah, the beauty!) and cooked with mushrooms, bell pepper and onions in black bean sauce was an absolute hit with everyone. 

In short, I can't think of cons to this place at all, at least when it comes to the food.

Indeed, the place is not very spacious. But with right kind of crowds coming in, hopefully Red Costa will expand into a larger dine in.  Till then, this place is strongly recommended for their food and homey ambience. :)

P.S. I will definitely revisit.

I am glad Red Costa is back. It is the best Chinese cuisine outlet near Udita in terms of quality, hygiene, and taste. Earlier, we used to get food delivered at our home from Red Costa at least twice a month. With no other equivalent option nearby, our family badly missed it while it was closed last several months. Today, after we noticed that it is once again operational, we got food delivered at our home. The food was as delicious as ever .... five stars!!!

The restaurant has opened again after almost 1 year. It is always my favourite restaurant.  The food quality is still excellent. But they need to be smart in taking order. When I was giving order, I was getting confused because of the person who was taking the order. And finally what they have delivered was mostly wrong.

sometimes the veg dishes don't have many vegetables, which defeats the point.Â

Somehow the weather in Kolkata is perfect today with a constant light drizzle and a pleasant cool breeze doing the rounds.None of us felt like having the home cooked food yet none of us felt like going out.So we decided to order home delivery instead.Now we had this menu leaflet of Red Costa lying around in our mailbox for quite some time and we decided to try it out.So I called them up and placed the order of - Chicken Sweet Corn Soup,Mixed Fried Rice,Chicken in Burnt Garlic Sauce ( which wasn't in the menu but they suggested it over the phone) and Chicken Manchurian.They asked us by what time we needed it delivered and the food arrived right on time.It looked like they had prepared and packed the food with a lot of care.The portions were sufficient and the food tasted really good.The soup was quite fulfilling and left us satisfied,The chicken in the burnt garlic sauce was really delicious and there were six chunks of it.The fried rice and Manchurian chicken were pretty decent too.It was a good meal and I think they have found a regular customer in us!!I just hope they maintain their standard and the quality of their food.

This is the most common restaurant that I order food from when cooking is tiring.  The food is acceptable and I'd say .. really good.
â€¢Chicken manchurian momo. The best of all. Stuffed with chicken and fried in manchurian sauce..it's lip smacking and will leave to want more of it. 
â€¢Malaysian rice or Beijing rice. Skip the normal fried rice and go for either of the two. It's flavorful. The aroma and the taste. 
â€¢Butter garlic chicken/ fish in chilli wine sauce is a good choice. 
â€¢satay chicken with peanuts and chilly is a good starter if you are looking for something spicy yet delicious! 

Bon appetite ! :)

Thoroughly disappointing experience on having ordered food from red Costa.  
We ordered egg fried rice, chilli chicken and fish in oyster sauce ( kept it simple considering we were ordering for the first time ). What landed up was a decent fried rice along with two dishes smelling and tasting strongly of soy sauce and cornflower! Both tasted the same! It was even worse than street food!
Service is okay but a colossal waste of one's money with such horrible food!
Avoid!

Firstly, this place is very very difficult to locate. I hope they will ramp up their marketing plan soon so that people are aware of their location.
This place has a very big kitchen, with no seating facility under the roof. However, there are some scattered tables and chairs outside in the open air. I was wondering, they could have easily accommodated some seating space by curbing their kitchen space...which is huuge!

I had ordered Singapore noodles and ginger chicken on the first night. Have attached images of the same. To say it in a line, I was blown away by their taste.
The Singapore noodles were full of chicken, egg and I quite liked their quality and quantity of the same. 2 persons can easily fill themselves with 1 plate of main dish. The ginger chicken too was awesome. 
Since I was quite impressed with their food, I opted for home delivery on the second night to cater to my guests. We had Cantonese gravy noodles, ginger chicken again (on public demand) and schezwan chicken.  I kind of liked the noodles as it was deep fried and was served separately in a container from its gravy. The gravy was quite thick and full of vegetables and chicken. I liked it. I had already liked the ginger chicken. However, I did not like the schezwan chicken as it was too mild to be schezwan. There was very little difference from the ginger chicken taste.

Overall. their service is prompt, menu card is innovative, and price is value for money given their large quantities. Keep it up :)

Okay so after a month of trying to look for this food joint in zomato I finally found it ! 
I was dying to write a review! 
Firstly , this place is very tricky to locate but I was damn lucky to find it 
It's a take away joint , you can't sit n eat here .. It also sends home delivery 
I got it delivered at home , since I was in tuitions and my ma'am suggested that we order food from here . 
The delivery took around 10-15 mins , which already was a complete win win for me 
We ordered chicken momo , which came along with a salad and soup. 
~ chicken momo 
This momo was AMAZING ! The quantity of chicken filling was good enough , it was perfectly cook .. And surely pampered my Taste buds , the sauce was a compete add on and it perfectly complimented the momo 
~salad 
It was a regular lettuce & cabbage salad with vinegar and the momo hot n chilly sauce. At first I was apprehensive about the fact that why would they serve salad with momo , but foodies trust me when I say this. This salad didn't at all disappoint me 
~soup 
After having the "soap like" soup from momo plaza I always avoiding the soups 
But this one , oh dear! Not only I had my share but also insisted my friend to gimme hers with a lame excuse of "you will get fat if you have that soup" 
And of course without fail I had hers too 
This soup was perfectly made , with spring onions , chicken pieces and ginger. 
The bill came something around 650 or so which wasn't at all much 
--------------------------------------------------------------The next time I was there which was a month back I was left mesmerised and happy as always 
I ordered Chinese rice and chilly soya fish 
~Chinese rice 
This one was just fine , not the best I have had but it was just fine. The rice was a lil over cooked and it had a very strong soya sauce taste 
~ chilly soya fish 
This fish ! I surely couldn't get enough of it ! 
This fish made up for the over cooked rice and I couldn't stop myself but steal from my moms plate too (which I got shouted at for ) 
But the point is, you HAVE to find this food joint and try this fish and the momo above with that soup ! 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
Overall 
Service -5/5 
Food -4.5/5 
Cost - 3.5/5 
Overall -4/5 
Must try foodies ;D
