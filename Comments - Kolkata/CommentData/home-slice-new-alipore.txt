Being  an avid pizza lover , i have stopped calling from domino's completely and the margherita pizza with basil is the current favorite. My kid and nephews love it too.

The wheat based pizzas are super light on the stomach (no bloated or full feeling), healthier,  toppings are organic and the pizzas are delivered hot .
A must try !!
Kudos to the home slice team .

Once I bake it..... Just fell in love with the aroma of the same in my kitchen.... Whole wheat base makes it easier for diet conscious and also the advantage is you can make the pizza the way u wanna... My mom wanted to avoid cheese so half her side was without cheese.... So go ahead the just order guys :) 
They need to work on the pesto a little... Though.... rest all good :)

We have tried almost all the pizzas from their menu and I must say its one of the best in the city. Our favourite is Popeye Special and it is simply outstanding. The only reason I have given 4.5/5 is because whenever we have ordered, we were requested for a pick-up instead of home delivery, which was a little annoying as you would expect your pizza to come to you and not you going for a pick-up. Nevertheless the pick-up is definitely worth it.

I've traveled the world,  lived across but never seen a better concept... Get your pizza delivered as a kit in 30 minutes and assemble flat few seconds and bake it in your oven....whether you like it we'll done or crisper or which every way suits your palate... It's pure divine.  Tried the zen,  marinated mushroom and they are outstanding and my regular weekly order.  Tried their baked pizzas too which is even better and perfectly charred but I still prefer the novelty of baking it myself.  Next on agenda is to try their spaghetti :)))happy happy happy

Some of the best pizzas in town. Tried it at India story and had been waiting to order since then, finally did so yesterday! They suggested we take the home kit and not the pre baked one. I was a little skeptical but I was on for a surprise. The kit was well done and the base was very thin. Though they should increase the quantity of the toppings. However, once our pizza was done we were delighted at the taste and crispness. It was just super. Can't wait to orde  again.
Just one problem, they took quite a long time to deliver.

My second order from Home Slice (earlier went by the name "Pomodoro") today via Zomato. Went for the "Formaggi" today mainly because they listed Gorgonzola cheese (never came across this before) as one of the ingredients apart from the usual Mozzarella, Cheddar and Parmesan which I am sure most people are familiar with. I had originally ordered the "Bianca" pizza which was unfortunately not available that day so opted for the "Formaggi". The delivery took more than an hour so I had to microwave the pizza before having it. Tasted exactly the way I like - perfect thin crust, topped with sun dried tomatoes n cheese mix, along with fresh greens (rucola). The Genovese (ordered on the previous occasion), also a nice one, gave off a hot flavor due to the presence of pesto and the jalapenos.

Would have rated 5 had the delivery been a little faster. The staff however, are very well spoken and helpful when Zomato patched them over the phone to inform about the unavailability of the Bianca pizza Prices can be considered reasonable given the fact. that they make only large sized pizzas.

All in all, a mouthwatering experience for my palate which was deprived of a nice homemade style pizza for ages along with a nice respite from usual thick crust pizzas of Domino's or PH. A must try for those in search of authentic Italian pizzas in Kolkata!!

Think I finally found my local pizza joint...finally!!

Pomodoro! A new concept in kolkata, they give you your own kit as well where you can make the pizza how you want to. Which I think is an awesome concept! The pizza is so thin that I can probably eat like 2 whole pizzas myself, but the taste is absolutely amazing. I ordered the pizza without the kit as well, it was really good. For all those pizza lovers, it's a must try!

Very rarely are you enthused to write a review but such is the charm of home slice pizzas :) we've all got so used to the domino's and the likes that pizzas have gotten downgraded to junk food but what home slice has done is made it a healthy meal for your family. Everything is so fresh and cooked in olive oil that you can go through an entire pizza without it making you full of grease and unhealthy 

Have been baking their pizza kits for a long time and they're truly ready in 8 minutes .
Tried their baked pizzas too and they're even better with the charred crust and true Neapolitan style ...just heat for a minute in your oven or on your hot tawa and it's as good as fresh baked ....

A true true true delight and gem of Kolkata ..

Have been ordering at home slice ,earlier known as pomodoro ,since it's inception . They specialise in pizza kits which is super easy to assemble in like a few seconds and bake it in your oven . What I love is the freshness of the ingredients which when baked gives you the best thin crust pizza in all of India. It might take you one or max two tries to bake it right but once you've done that , you'll never eat pizza anywhere else .

So I ordered two pizzas from here , the goat cheese primo and the tatufo. A wonderful thing about this place is that they deliver all the ingredients and the pizza base to your doorstep, and you get to make and bake your own pizza. So I received all the ingredients in a box. The pizza base seemed nice and thin. The various toppings and sauce were just assembled in the base and put into the oven for 10-15 minutes. As I'm very fond of goat cheese , I was really happy that they had it in the menu, though many places don't. The cooked pizza was amazing. The tanginess of the sauce brought out a wonderful flavour, the base was thin as paper and browned at the edges, just the way I like it. The amount of cheese , I was a little skeptical about at first but ended up being enough for the pizza. There was mozzarella , goat cheese and Parmesan. These pizzas are absolutely brilliant which you can make yourself !

The best and fresh pizzas in town, previously for having thin crust pizzas the only option used to be 5* and the home delivery meant having soggy and thick crust pizzas, now with these kits pizzas are a different experience all together, have the liberty to have whenever desired and hot and fresh.

Service: probably the 1st ever delivery outlet that reached before time. And also the 1st to whom I explained my location just once.
taste: i can say the best pizza i have ever eaten in kol.  The pizza was so fresh and light. Am definitely not ordering pizza from any other place.

I ordered a pizza for 2 after great reviews and opinions from my friends. The pizza is good to taste and amazing options of toppings are available for a varied menu..

Thumbs down for not following the extra remarks.. Both the times we requested some extra chilli flakes and oregano which was not complied.. In fact this time (the 2nd time) they even forgot the chilli flakes..so in case you enjoy your pizza extra spicy keep the oregano chilli flakes ready at hand.. They do send some post baking olive oil and sour cream which is a boon! 

Coming to the pizza it was well baked and whole wheat crust and delicious to taste..I heard they also send unbaked pizza with toppings so you can DIY at home in case you want to steaming hot and crunchy...otherwise the pizza tends to get bit soggy due to delivery issues... Also they're loaded with orders so time to deliver is a challenge...

Overall good experience with some scope of improvement...

P.S: would love if they include brocolli and tofu as part of extra toppings..

Home slice, earlier pomodoro, is one of our most favourite places to order from when we don't feel like having home food. I love their concept because all you got to do is assemble the pizza and bake it yourself. The pizza is absolutely fresh and the flavours are brilliant. Each one is different from another and really yum! My most favourite is pizza Alla vodka. Highly recommend it.

Home slice is one of the best pizza bakers in town which gives you  pizzas as fresh as possible ! Their kits are cute and neat and they steal the show in a party! Goat cheese pizza and mushroom in pesto are the ones I've tried and they do pure justice to it! 
An absolute must try !one will surely become a fan of their pizzas once he tastes their fresh pizzas ! Keep it up home slice ! :)

Late Delivery followed by rude reception followed by bad Pizzas.

After reading all the reviews I was quite excited to place an order, convinced my brother too who never goes for such pizzas. Over 95 minutes passed after which I finally received the order. While placing an order I was informed to wait 60 minutes but once it was 20 minutes past that I called only to get a rude response saying "we are not dominos or Pizza Hut, our food is freshly prepared". I do take offence to the tone.

Moving past that the pizzas finally arrived and we were extremely hungry so we just went for it.

Having reheated as per the delivery boy suggestion the pizzas did not taste better. It was quite poorly prepared and they were (margarita and formaggi pizzas) were indistinguishable from each other. Perhaps I do not have a developed sense of taste but this quite frankly is the worst pizza I have ever had, and I have had really bad ones!

Bottom line :  if you want to have fresh home made pizza, without having to spend hours in the kitchen making one , Pomodoro is the solution. 

Taste: I have tried three different flavors. All are superb! For lovers of thin crust this is heaven. The taste of fresh ingredients comes through. Cooking time is also very less. 

Price: pocket pinch is reasonable for what they offer. 

Presentation: A big fan of their graphics and presentation style and such ease of instructions in putting the pizza together at home ! One of its kind so far. The products are very well placed and labelled. 

They have started with other things like salad dressing and garlic bread. Garlic bread was average.

The name Pomodoro rings the hunger bell whenever I hear it. I absolutely adore thin crust pizzas. And Pomodoro has added a new dimension to it. Freshness in every bite, it is a treat for the tastebuds.

Pomodoro means 'a sauce made of tomatoes'. Most pizzas places score marks in other criterion but fail to impress when it comes to the pizza sauce. This is where Pomodoro scores the century. The crust is amazing is as well.

I had pizzas from Pomodoro at a friend's house party. I couldn't wait to order. You can get the pizzas pre-baked or in the form of easy do it yourself kits. I prefer the pre- baked ones.

I ordered:

Formaggi Pizza (4 cheese): Mozzarella, Cheddar, Parmesan, Gorgonzola, sundried tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, rocket leaves. This one is a cheese lovers delight.

Marinated Mushroom Pizza: The mushrooms are marinated in fresh Pesto, the tangy twist of jalapenos, mozarella cheese, extra virgin olive oil, and cheese. This one is my absolute favourite. Can have one full by myself.

Pesto pizza: This is a super healthy pizza, whole wheat base, basil pesto , toasted pine nuts, feta cheese, balsamic cherry tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil. Pizza while on a diet, sounds exciting doesn't it. I think they should rename it to the Diet pizza.

The pizzas are light. That's due to the enticing combination and fresh organic ingredients used. This is for lovers of authentic pizzas.

I loved the small bottle of their EVOO ( extra virgin olive oil) which came with each pizza.
The person taking the orders on phone is very prompt and knowledge. He told me the facts about delivery time, pre baked and pizza kit, which were really helpful.

Disclaimer: it's not as filling as other pizzas so check order quantity.

Mine was a custom made pizza as I wanted to try a healthier pizza (if that is possible). But they did make it possible. Extremely patient with what I wanted. Wheat thin crust with super delicious tangy spicy tomato sauce, sundried tomatoes, pickled jalapenos, bell peppers, pine nuts, mushrooms..it was yumm .. yumm despite that fact i wanted no cheese .. with cheese I am sure it would have been better. But immense satisfactions came. The crust was crispy and nice. Dont expect it to be a 30min ordeal .. but best cause you dont have to order more for Dominos to deliver.
P.S. the pizza came with a small bottle of extra virgin olive oil. Naiicee.
Check the photo below of my half eaten pizza.

So we came to know about this place through word of mouth. Friends and kins were all praises about this place and they were not wrong. I ordered directly and not through zomato. That is what you should do too, zomato charging extra for packaging.  There is a nominal delivery charge of Rs25 and no other additional/hidden  costs. 

The menu is simple and concise. Its an all veg menu (yayyy) . You have the option of ordering a prepared pizza or the kit. I tried both.

My order:
Zen-  basic tomato base pizza with sun dried tomatoes. Good flavours, low on toppings. This was prepared.

Goat cheese primo:  one of their toppings loaded pizza. Pretty good. This was a kit.

Pesto pizza: this was the best of the lot. Very flavorful, toasted pine nuts went really well. Well made pesto base. This I ordered in wheat crust. 

All the pizzas were really flavourful and delicious. ¬†The ingredients were of very good quality and fresh. ¬†But the crust is really very thin, so if you are used to stomach filling pizzas of dominos or pizza hut you might not like it. But if you are a true gourmet then you will love it. 
3 pizzas sufficed the four of us. If you are supremely hungry then one person can finish off the entire pizza.¬†

Bill was for Rs1170, the owner was very courteous to give a discount of 10%. At approx 400 a pizza i think its very reasonable. Its the kind of authentic pizzas you would get at an upscale Italian restaurant sans 30% taxes ( 15% VAT, 5% SERVICE TAX, 10 % Service Charge). I Really liked their pizzas and hope they retain their quality.

Suggestion:  They should increase the amount of toppings  which was very less or should give an option to double up the toppings by charging a little extra.

These people have single handed-ly ruined the pizza eating experience for me... I cannot eat dominos or pizza hut products anymore.... 

I have tried their entire menu and each and every variation is a must try... I love assembling the pizza.. and obviously it does not get fresher than this... 

Just one note, we are a family of 2 adults and 2 small children and we can consume upto 4 pizzas in a single sitting... I am writing this not to boast about our voracious appetite, but to express how refreshingly light these pizzas are...!!

Great job team POMODORO...!!!!

I ordered a special tomato pie pizza. It was already  cooked. So, I didn't have to go through all the trouble of baking it. Although, I might do that sometime. Okay, now this place is vegetarian and the pizza crusts are essentially thin. You don't really have crust options (apart from a wheat choice). I usually like the greasy, cheesy, unhealthy pizza. But, this one comes with really fresh and authentic ingredients.
That was a welcome change. Can't say I'm gonna order too much because because it's too pricey for veg food and the quantity is just okay for 1 person. (Rs. 375 for the one I got).

Heard so many friends raving about this place that we finally decided to order in from them. An absolute delight to dig into their Pizza Alla Vodka and the Genovese. Packed with flavour and baked to perfection.Its rare to find such taste in India !

Stayed all over the world but never received a pizza delivery with extra virgin olive oil as an add on , speaks volumes about the though that's gone behind creating Pomodoro. way to go guys, best of luck

Never ever order in pizzas from anywhere else. happy happy customer

Just a great concept and delicious pizzas!
Just bang on on flavour, and adds the great personalisation touch to make it fun and somehow tastier.

Though the pizzas are great thin crusts, they are super light and will not satiate your hunger craving, fullness wise. And considering that the cost is steep too.

Amazing thin crust pizza with cherry tomatoes,fresh basil leaves, mozzarella cheese and evoo.... Margherita Pizza....that we ordered from Pomodoro ...was worth the wait!!
The box was stylish and it came with instructions written on it....to bake in a preheated oven for 90 secs. After doing that we drizzled the evoo on the Pizza and sprinkled the chilly flakes and took the first bite. Bliss. Loved it!! Will definitely try the other pizzas. The best part we can try out all pizzas on their menu for all are VEG. Pizzas!!!

I have been a pizza lover for a very long time. From the small round breads topped with chicken or veg and almost plastic cheese available at local confectioneries (they introduced me to pizza, I must confess) to the thin crust beauties with exotic toppings, I have tasted all Calcutta has to offer. While the two biggies in the city mainly offer thick crust varieties, many new and promising pizzerias are coming up with thin crust and delicious options. But what would you do if you want to enjoy one sitting inside the comfort of your home? I know most restaurants deliver at your doorstep these days. But however hard they try, it is never possible to deliver a hot off the oven pizza with cheese bubbling to you. This is where, I think, the concept of a pizza kit is a winner.
                                                                ...

The food industry is on a storm here in Kolkata. Every month some new concept or the other is witnessed. Pomodoro....an excellent concept and treat for Pizza Lovers is a new feather in the hat. Good stuff. Their pizzas are beautiful. We ordered Funghetta and Mother Earth. Both were pretty nice. Nice try for Pizza Lovers.

Did not realise it was a pizza kit. My mistake. Now I am left with a raw base and cups of ingredients and no oven. Regret this purchase intensely. But I thought that ordering a pizza meant that it is actually a pizza and not ingredients. I could buy this in a shop for God's sake. Stupidest concept ever. 

Edit - changing the rating since Pomodoro was kind enough to take back the kit and return the money

Excellent pizza, great concept. Would surely prefer pomodoro over any other options for home delivery for pizzas.
Suggestion: should have more options in your menu.

A friend had called for pizzas for a party at his place. The zen pizza was nice and the fungi pizza tasted bad and soggy with burnt edges. I would like to taste more to draw a proper conclusion about this pizzeria. I've had their fungi pizza at farmers market and they did a decent job there.

Perfectly thin crust , fresh , hygienic , and well packed pizzas! 
Their pizza kits are too neatly packed for you too fall in love with them when u receive it!
First of its kind in cal ! And they do their job perfectly well ! :)
Pomodoro has made me truly love their goat cheese primo Pizza ! ( being a goat cheese lover!)
Bake the pizza for a while after you are done placing the toppings on the base ! And enjoy one of the best made authentic thin crust pizza in town with exotic veggies, good cheese and a dash of olive oil! :) cheers pomodoro ! ‚úåÔ∏è

Having a lazy Sunday? Don't want to head out to a crowded restaurant!? Don't want to eat anything that comes from your kitchen? Then this is it! Pomodoro! Order in a choice of your pizza and dig in. One pizza isn't enough for pizza lovers like myself so make sure to order two if you are famished. Tried the marinated mushroom pizza and it was delish!

Amazing amazingly good pizzas!  If you want fresh,  authentic pizzas this is your option. The concept is very innovative,  the packaging is easy to handle, neat and clean and you never have to worry about the pizza getting cold as you can heat it up and eat it whenever you want. All in all it tastes delicious that's what matters the most.

Pizza comes with "assembly" instructions which are easy to follow. The ingredients are absolutely fresh. It's refreshing to have a gourmet pizza at home, freshly baked with real mozzarella. Almost replicates authentic wood-fired pizza. Have tried the Margherita and Zen Pizzas. Worth trying if you are craving a real, fresh pizza at home, or if you have some hungry friends over. Will definitely order again.

Pomodoro...the only pizza which gets delivered to our doorstep and can be made fresh by our own hands...theses people give you all the ingredients in a box..it contains a pizza base, some tomato pur√©e, sufficient grated cheese, olives, tomatoes etc. We can be our own chef, design our own pizza and bake it fresh. So you know that you're eating something fresh which is made, right away, by you. The quality of the toppings and cheese is good. Overall, the pizza is awesome and very much appropriate for small gettogethers, occasions, parties etc. I will recommend pomodoro!

The first time I ordered a pizza here I was quite taken aback by the "bake your own pizza" concept. They give  all the ingredients of your choosing in small containers. You have to assemble it on the tortilla style pizza bread (which is also available in who wheat version) and bake it yourself. I had fun doing it. Though one has to be careful about monitoring the pizza while its in the oven. It comes out crisp and oh so yummy! The sauces are really delicious and the mozzarella slices were super fresh. Very refreshing idea  and a very  healthy pizza! I hope they expand their menu soon!

I ordered 2 different varieties of pizzas. I must say that the taste and the quality of the food is impeccable. The only drawback for some would be that they provide you with the ingredients and you have to assemble and bake the pizza by yourself. But i feel its a gr8 idea. Its a must try frm my side.

Do it yourself pizza is an awesome concept when u have kids. No doubt the ingredients are very fresh and the cheese too is very good. 

Goat cheese pizza - outstanding 

Margarita : average - they need to give two helpings of mozzarella. Mine came without Parmesan 

Surely will order again
