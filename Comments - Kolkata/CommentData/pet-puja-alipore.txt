This is a new outlet that is located on 1st floor of Ahindra Mancha in Chetla.For many years this area was lacking a good multi-cuisine sit and AC dining resto which came to an end after this place opened.On the initial day as I was in a hurry did'nt go for much of their signature dishes but gave their egg fried rice a try.Quality was succulant(two can share if they go for some sides),Quality and Taste wise all was good.Would like to say one of the best fried rice in this budget that I tried in quite some time.Ambience wise also good,if this place continues to thrive with good quality then it would surely be a hit and a lifeline for a good budget AC resto in the viscinity.
