Visited for a breakfast buffet. The spread was wide and good. The juices were stale. The Haka noodles and udon soup were stale. The South Indian spread was amazing. There was live dosa and uttapam , vada and idlis with 3 kinds of chutney and sambahar. They didn't have much for desserts which was a disappointment. The cheese platter was good. The service was good.

An ok ok experience, if compared against the price. Went there for lunch buffet.

Ambiance- great
Staff- Good
Food- There were a lot of items, but taste was average. Both the veg and non-veg starters were a bit on the oilier side. Chicken preparations were not so tasty and the rui kalia was again too oily. Veg and chicken biriyani was good. Mutton preparation was not up to the mark.¬†

There's scope for improvement so far as the taste of food is concerned.

Pros: Food quality was good. Good choice of salads, desserts, main course. Courtesy shown by serving staff and chef team was excellent.
Cons: Limited choice for starters. Service was below average as we had to call them a lot of times for anything and almost everything though I understand it was a buffet but service charge was included in price. Refills were taking for ever. Even for the mocktail there was only one option.

Went for a family dinner on the eve of Christmas. The buffet spread was pretty wide and the staffs were very courteous, specially the person named Pritam. Live music was really great and helped a lot in creating the Christmas-y ambience. As it was a Christmas special dinner,we were expecting the turkey,pork,duck and meat loaf to be spot on,but unfortunately they were not :( They looked spectacular but weren't warm enough...therefore tasted little rubbery. However,the Indian section,salads and dessert section of the spread were good.

Went for the breakfast buffet. They had juices like pineapple, orange and pomegranate juices on display. They had soup and salad section well displayed too. For the buffet they had bacon, sausages, harsh browns, butter soaked vegetables, chicken and lamb stew, pancakes, waffles, idli, sambar, vada. They had a live station for omelettes, dosas and bhaturas. Had a good experience there :)

Venue: Social Kitchen, Holiday Inn
Ambience: 10/10
Hospitality: 8/10

Ok now comes the actual section. Food! And this is where it lacks its overall quality!

Salads: 10/10 very good no doubt

Starters: 4/10 rawa fish fry was good, but chicken was equally bad

Main Course ( Non Veg) : 3/10 poor! Quality of fish and chicken were not good at all! Tastes were so so! Prawns were very badly dressed so that its look was resisting all to try it! Lamb stew was slightly above average! Overall impression is far below the expectations!

Main Course (Veg): 4/10 bad! Nothing tasted well except the yellow dal fry and the Jodhpuri Alu Dum! Noodles were very bad!

Desert section: 6/10 average. Caramel pudding was good! Bengali sweet curd was good! Gulab Jamun was disaster! Other deserts were so so!

Live Counter: 6/10 average. Pasta servings lacked the right portion of white sauce! Taste were good but dry! Pizza was good!

Average score = 33/60 = 5.5/10
Average rating = 2.25/5

For the readers:
If you want to show off, you are always welcome cause you will get beautiful food pics! For camera, they have plenty of foods!

If you want to come for the satisfaction of your taste buds, a big no no for you!

It is strong but this is the worst buffet I've had! Being close to my place my friend and I decided to hit social kitchen for a buffet dinner only to realise it was a disaster. The service is the only decent part here. Soup was cold in a Tauren. The paneer kebab was bland, the chicken wings... it had only bones left in the hot plate,the fish was decent but cold again. I tried the the cheddar with apricot and it was stale cheese(mind it not matured cheddar). The watermelon drink served  to us was nice. For the main course the Thai green curry was decent, gosh red curry had a strange smell in it. The baked vegetable tasted good, dal palak was tad cold, Andhra chicken curry was palatable. After the disasterous food I decided to call for a spaghetti Agli olio, it was raw not al Dante. One thing consistent about the food was everything was cold. I did not have to heart to go in for any dessert. I have not had a meal where everything was so disappointing lately.

A birthday get-together for a lunch buffet was ruined today,¬†thanks¬†to the pathetic food, NO unlimited mocktails as promised, NO live counters as promised, and poor service. You can't promise the moon and stars and not have enough. After all, your's is a trusted brand, and customers travelling all the way from the city are bound to have expectations. Totally disappointing.¬† Do not intend to visit the place EVER again. The experience has left a sour taste in the mouth.

Going by the rating on zomato I went to this place.  Was taken aback by the size of the restaurant first of all.  Pics give an impression that the place is big....  but its actually medium sized. 
Now coming to the main part the food.  We had a look at the dinner buffet that was on offer and decided to go for al a carta instead. Buffet didn't seem to be worth 1200-1300 rs pp that they were charging.  
We ordered a paneer starter , risotto and noodles.  Also some Fresh lime soda sweet (which was actually served without any sweetness in it).
The Paneer starter was just ok
The risotto was pretty good 
The noodles were very plain and had no taste in it. 

Must State here that the portion of food provided is adequate for 3-4 people .

Finally they gave us complimentary desserts ( which was nice on there part) 

All in all its a place that you can avoid going to unless you are staying at that hotel

Located right besides Spencer's Chinar Park makes the place very easy to find. The first thing worth mentioning is the warm and welcoming staff right from the Vallet parking to the restaurant manager. The decor of the restaurant is nothing flashy but clean and spacious with seating arranged around the centre spread buffet. The food included 4-5 starters like ajwani fish fry, teriyaki chicken, paneer makhni tikka and roasted potato wedges which were all good. The pizza and pasta from the live counter were 'wow'! The non-veg main course had wide variety including couple of chicken dishes- methi chicken n roasted chicken with skin in gravy, fish in garlic sauce, lamb casserole and prawn in spicy sauce which were all good. However the best of the rest was the melt-in-your-mouth chicken biriyani. The dessert were all tasty especially caramel pudding, flan and off course - mishti doi! The restaurant manager attended everyone personally and also asked to review them on Zomato.
A good experience overall!

Well, after a tired work-week, the average guy prefers dozing off till late on Sundays, and once up from bed (say 10.30 am), has no time for breakfast! Nor can he wait till afternoon for lunch, as that would be too late! For people of this category, the dining industry has devised the BRUNCH ‚Äì which is a late meal eaten in lieu of both ‚Äì breakfast and lunch!

Only a handful of restaurants in the whole of Kolkata actually serve a BRUNCH, and it‚Äôs good news for the Kolkatans, as well as those flying over from other places to Kolkata, that ‚ÄúSocial Kitchen‚Äù has started doing so very recently!

Location: A stone‚Äôs throw distance from Chinar Park, New Town ‚Äì ground floor of Holiday Inn ‚Äì a 4-star property, which gives you a 5-star feel!

Being a hardcore vegetarian, i tried only veg items .... although my co-foodies opine that their non veg is no less!

On the menu:-

Soup:-

1.	Vegetable Manchow ‚Äì Fine, with lots of chopped vegetables and soya sauce, but was pretty luke warm ‚Äì better storage warranted to ensure warmth. Best had with fried noodles, nachos, soup sticks, breads, boiled noodles and several other condiments available!

Starters:

2.	Panch-phoron Paneer Tikka ‚Äì The regular paneer tikka, goes best with the mint chutney available!

3.	Chilli Blast Babycorn ‚Äì Pretty crispy as well as tasty!

4.	BBQ Potato Wedges ‚Äì Fried in a tangy sauce, high on taste!

Main Course:

5. Veg Biryani ‚Äì Below expectations, devoid of any cottage cheese cubes or potato pieces!

6. Steamed Rice

7. Yellow Dal Tadka - Tasty

8. Dal Panchmel ‚Äì Fine

9. Mushroom Masala ‚Äì Could not try

10. Anjeer Gatta Curry ‚Äì Gatta tempered in anjeer (a dry fruit) curry and topped with lots of methi ‚Äì the Rajasthani style - pretty nice!

11. Kadai Paneer ‚Äì Paneer cooked in tomato gravy with lots of capsicum slices, onion layers, and what not! Wish I could have had tonnes of it!

12. Aloo Posto ‚Äì You don‚Äôt often get better aloo posto these days!

13. Eggplant Parmigiana ‚Äì Don‚Äôt be confused ‚Äì this one is our own brinjal ‚Äì sliced and prepared in a tangy gravy ‚Äì a must try!

14. Singaporean Curried Noodles ‚Äì PERFECT ‚Äì is the word to describe it!

15. Vegetable in Ginger Soya Sauce ‚Äì Could not try

16. Garlic Naan ‚Äì Thinnest of the thin ‚Äì stuffed with chopped garlic pieces ‚Äì well prepared!

17. Butter roti ‚Äì Strikingly, ‚Äúbutter‚Äù was missing ‚Äì atta based bread!

Salads:

16. Green Peas & corn salad

17. Mushroom & Beans Salad

18. Watermelon & Feta Salad

19. Greek Salad

20. Waldorf

21. Pasta Salad

22. Sprout Salad

23. Broccoli & Cous Cous

24. Hummus

25. Variety cheese, dry fruits are available

Out of the above, the watermelon salad deserves a special mention ‚Äì dressed in a few spices, little bit of curd and coriander!

Desserts:

25. Fresh Fruit Tart ‚Äì red grapes, strawberry, kiwi ‚Äì a slice each served in a small basket laced with whipped cream!

26. Walnut Brownie ‚Äì Topped with dried layer of chocolate sauce, a winner!

27. Strwaberry Swiss Roll ‚Äì The pick of all desserts, topped with lots of strawberries, whipped cream ‚Äì perfect on presentation and perfect on taste as well ‚Äì had 2 slices of the same!

28. Flaky Chocolate Mousse ‚Äì lots of crumbled brownie, choco nuts, caramel infused with chocolate planks ‚Äì but below expectations!

29. Dark Cherry Pannacotta ‚Äì Could not taste ‚Äì but presentation was definitely worth a million bucks!

30. Berry Frangipane ‚Äì Could not try

31. Mango Mascarpone in Chocolate Cup ‚Äì Mango pulp crafted inside a chocolate tart ‚Äì mind blowing!

32. Creme Caramel ‚Äì Could not try, but was worth trying!

33. Rasmalai ‚Äì Somehow, this failed to tickle my taste buds!

34. Gur ka Rasgulla ‚Äì Aptly prepared with decent gur content ‚Äì it ensured we end on a sweet note!

35. Mishti Doi ‚Äì They could hold coaching classes exhibiting how the perfect mishit doi can be made ‚Äì optimum gur, optimum curd, optimum sugar ‚Äì everything just optimum!

36. Dry fruits with honey dressing

Live Counter:

36. Pizza Counter ‚Äì Pretty thin crust pizzas topped with seasonal veggies and served with oregano seasonings and chilli flakes ‚Äì a slice or 2 wont be enough!

37. Pasta ‚Äì Fine, but we expected better vegetable content to enrich the taste!

Chat Counter:-

One can make papdi chaat on his own for oneself, also, curd rice is available. Dahi vada with bhujia topping, plain curd, saunth ki chutney, mint chutney, sweet curd, kasundi chutney is available!

Kid‚Äôs Corner

Activity:

Sketch Painting is available i.e. a professional will pencil paint you on a piece of paper ‚Äì on request!

Live Music / Karaoke ‚Äì to keep you entertained!

All of the above are available at modest rates as below:-

Sunday Brunch @ 1250 + Taxes

Sunday Brunch + Unlimited Beer @ 1750 + Taxes

Sunday Brunch + 2 glasses of Indian Wine @ 1850 + Taxes

Sunday Brunch + Unlimited IMFL @ 2150 + Taxes

Ambience ‚Äì Superb!

Service ‚Äì Fine, but needs to buck up high time, staff take ages to serve you and sometimes, even forget to! Often they serve your stuff to others and vice versa ‚Äì in a nutshell, they need more training!

In a nutshell, waste no more time, simply walk in to Social Kitchen and have a time of a lifetime!

Went for their lunch buffet today. To summarize the experience, it was BAD. Right from the service to the quality of the food, nothing managed to live up to our expectation (we had high hopes from the rating on Zomato).¬†

The starters had just one non-veg (dry chilli chicken) and one veg item (panner tikka) . We somewhat liked the chilli chicken the first time it was served and so asked for a repeat. The next time it was served, the chicken was bland and undercooked. As for the rest of the items in the main course, well, ABYSMAL is the word. The mutton pieces had this horrible smell and the Biriyani , (atleast the name card spelled that) was not upto the mark. Finally, the desserts, some of them, like the mango souffle and the rasmalai tried very hard to save the day but, alas, the palate had already been ruined by then.

Would like to request the management to make sure that the service is improved so that people are not made to feel as if they are not allowed to ask for a repeat of an item, because that is what a buffet is supposed to mean, to serve unlimited food. Also, being a 5-star property, people expect good food, great ambience and warm service. Unfortunately, we received none of these, so, overall, we are pretty disappointed.¬†

Hope to see things improve. Cheers! Keep munching!

A sudden plan with a nearbuy coupon made us visit this place.The entrance of the hotel is horrible with broken roads and less parking availability. The decor is average with courteous waiters to serve you. We opted for buffet dinner and I just liked the pepper chicken sort of something in the starter (non-vegetarian starters options were too less)The main course had many options but it was not at all delicious.My sweet tooth was also disappointed with only misti doi and malpoa, strawberry flavoured pastry ,hard chocolate brownie and mango souffle that is it.Will definitely not visit.

We went for the dinner buffet. The choice of menu is very very limited with respect to other popular buffet restaurants. In non veg there were only two starters and that too cold and hard. The salads were ok types and desserts were too sweet to have. Only good part was the main course which literally saved me from starving. We booked it through nearbuy and then also I was sad for my money. I feel terrible for them who paid 1400+ for this disaster.

A sumptuous breakfast spread at a very pocket friendly price i must say. Amazing spread of breads, every item of a typical English breakfast spread was there. What i would suggest is, to uplift their Indian section of the buffet. No complaints with the South indian section but there could be something more in addition to Luchi Aludum. Also, some more fruits to accompany the whipped cream would have been great. None the less, i have no issues with being back to this place.

Cake mixing marks the beginning of the grand celebration of Christmas. And #MunchingMonks were invited to attend this exclusive event at Holiday Inn Kolkata Airport . 
Special touch was added by the presence of the children of Hope foundation and the Cactus band. 
In this ceremony, dry fruits like tutti fruity, raisins, black currants, cherries, almond flakes, sultana,plum, glazed dates and prunes are mixed with liquor to develop it's flavour. 
Special thanks to Executive Chef Suman Chakraborty and Assistant Marketing Manager Debmita Banerjee for inviting us.

As I grow up Christmas has really special and close. We used to get a long winter recess. I always wanted to visit a cake mixing ceremony however I couldn‚Äôt get the perfect time and opportunity to do the same.

This entire month of November a lot of hotels organise cake-mixing ceremonies to mark the commencement of the festivities. I went for the cake mixing ceremony at Holiday Inn. 

I was welcomed to the grandeur of holiday inn and the ceremony. The ceremony took place near the lobby area which is overlooking the Social ‚Äì the restaurant section of the hotel.

The ceremony was commenced by School children who were associated with Hope Foundation and artistes from the band Cactus. We, Munching Monks, were invited by the Executive Chef Suman and Assistant Marketing Manager Debamita to witness the amazing event at Holiday Inn Kolkata Airport.

The ingredients consisted of dry fruits like raisins, black currants, prunes, dates, cherries, orange, lemon and nuts like cashews, pistachios and almonds. The whole mix was then soaked in liquor.

The experience was an enthralling experience and something I would love to experience more often. Felt like a kid for a while and got excited for Christmas.

Well to top it all off, we were also provided Gift Hampers filled up with Dark Chocolates with Roasted  Almond & Dry Fruits and white chocolate with Cashew & Dry Fruits. A special thanks to Chef Suman. It was a very nice gesture. And I must say I enjoyed the Chocolates to the core. They were absolutely heavenly!!!

A gorgeously decorated place  with grandeur , 
Welcomed by courteous staffs , and warm welcome..
The unlimited buffet is a treat to relish. 
The starters are great to enjoy.
Didnt get the fact of mixing raw papaya with chicken in salad. It killed the chicken.
The main course is not so relishing. Biriyani is actually bad  , it  needs improvement.
The dessert section is really the star of the course. 
The mishti doi  is really good. And the mousse , sandesh , pastries have left an awe in my mouth. 
Plus unlimited mocktails are a big add-on. 
Great visit , enjoyed thoroughly.

Located near City Center 2, Rajarhat, just near to Chinar Park. It's located on the ground floor of The Holiday Inn.

Decoration was just nice and the stuffs are well behaved. Their presentation was also good.

At first we were welcomed by a refreshing drink.In buffet for salads there were 8 veg and non-veg salads. It comprised of two soups (veg Nd non veg). It also had chaat counter, live pasta nd pizza. The pizzas were thin crust beauty and it was really delicious.

For main course we had chicken biryani, methi ghost, roast chicken, prawn, sliced fish, veg biryani, Dal, haka noodles, allor dom, paneer nd many others...

For desserts we had Mihi Dana, rosogolla, baked rosogolla, blue-berry pastry, orange and chocolate brownie. And lastly but not the least we had ice- cream (both vanilla Nd chocolate).

The newest baby in 5 star circuit in Kolkata. I had heard about it before coming to the city about it but wanted to try myself. As JW Marriot has already bypassed all the 5 stars and 7 stars in Kolkata, breaking the monotony was not easy. 

Location wise,  Holiday Inn in near Dumdum Airport and you may miss it if you don't keep an eye on the road. It's bang beside Big Bazar in Rajarhat and City Center 2.  Far for South Kolkatans 

Ambiance wise, it's a small 5 star boutique targeted at office crowd. They have plans to open a new gastropub called Urban Kitchen.

For now, their coffee shop named Social Kitchen is only operating. Coming to the Social Kitchen and JW Marriot Kitchen comparison, let's see what's in store for diners.

The lunch buffet is RS 1270 all inclusive. The biggest includes soups, salads, main course including Conti, Oriental, Indian and loads of desserts. 

I opted for buffet and my friend opted for Salmon Steak. She loved the Salmon. In the buffet, starters were great. I loved the Chilli Paneer and the Chicken Mushroom Soup. I also loved the light and fluffy Chicken Biryani they had in the buffet. Overall, the food was unexpectedly light, delicious, and not overwhelmingly spicy.  They beat Marriot in silently executing their cookery to minimalism. If they can continue this cooking, service and ambiance, they will grow multiple times. 

Of course, again coming back here for another buffet lunch though I have not tried the one near my home in Mumbai.

Highly recommended!!

Starters were okay nothing great or deserves amention .
Main course was averaga with the tiger prawns being the only dish standing out.

Salads were good and so was the pizza. But thats it
Deserts were many but not wow.

Not worth a second visit .

We planned to visit this place seeing the high rating in Zomato. But it disappointed us. I am not going again to believe the feedback on Zomato from now. I think it has been posted by their own members.

We visted the place the day after Vijaya Dasami of this puja. First of all there was no icecream on desserts. The food was tasteless and cold. Pizza was pathetic. Very limited menu. In my turn no Rasgulla and golabzamun were left and after requesting 2 times they did not refill it.

It was total waste of money. Dnt visit this place.

A pleasant place to visit and have a quaint lunch! We went to their buffet lunch and it was a good experience. The taste of the food served was quite good.The chicken sweet corn soup was very tasty when added with a little bit of butter For starters they had 2 dishes, one chicken and one fish. The Lemon and Paprika Chicken was very tasty! It had a slight infusion of lemon. It was really refreshing. There was a huge variety for the main course. Not only for the non-veg but for the veg also. There was steamed rice, veg biriyani, veg noodles, and assorted breads for the veg option and Chicken Biriyani for the non-veg. There was a dish Parwal Masala, it was the star of the day according to me. It was just excellent! There was Mustard Fish with a flavor of orange, Prawn with bellpeppers and Chicken and Mutton. All the dishes were more or less very tasty. The desert section had a great variety. It was a delightful sight. 
The ambiance was very good, like I said a quaint place. The staffs were very good and well behaved. Overall it was great experience.

It‚Äôs really worth mentioning that they have taken care of all the needs of their customers with a very pleasant gesture.

We had the buffet lunch at Social Kitchen. The restaurant is just inside Holiday Inn hotel so easy to locate. 

The ambience of the restaurant is quite good. Food was good but nothing to go wow about. Starters and main course was OK. In deserts I liked the Baked Boondi, it tasted quite well.

The service was good. I missed the unlimited mock tails in the buffet even though it was mentioned in Nearby menu but as menu is subject to change so not really complaining üòä

Well my best friend is from IHM Kolkata and he had planned and booked this place for a reunion and it did not dissapoint. The service is really top notch with a good ambiance and the spread was pretty good too including chicken prawn fish and mutton. Well not everything tasted great but the mutton stood out while the biryani was pretty average. I would love to see a change in the dessert section as it really did not have anything different. Also the starters were pretty average. But overall a good outing.

Brighten up your day with a lavish extravagant experience here at Holiday Inn Kolkata Airport.
Located at Chinarpark, Kolkata..opposite to Arsalan this place is extraordinarily good with its beautiful ambience. Starting from the interior to service everything is on top notch. 
So here they are with their excuisite cuisines.
Indulge yourself into the huge array of Bengali cuisines. Team Panchphoron was invited for the food tasting ceremony. 
So let's check out what popular Bengali delicacies they are offering to us..

¬∞ Dhonepata kanchalonka Murgi - A very authentic Bengali dish prepared with chicken. The gravy was green in colour due to green chilly paste and corriander paste in it. The chicken was soft and succlucent. Little spicy. Great in taste.

¬∞ Parshe macher jhal- We Bengalis are very much accquainted with parshe macher jhal. The fish was fresh. And the turmeric, onion paste and other spices in it added more flavours. Will surely love it.
 
¬∞ Daab chingri- The most popular dish among Bengalis. Daab chingri brings that nostalgic memories within you. Fresh prawns cooked with various herbs and authentic spices brings out that aromatic flavour in it. Served on coconut shell. Very much impressive. 

¬∞ Kosha mangsho- A mixture of various spices like bay leaves, cardamom, chopped onions, yogurt to bring the fragrance. The dish is basically very rich as it requires a lot of oil in it. The chunky meat pieces were just heavenly. And another worth having cuisine.

¬∞ Potoler dolma- Basically means a stuffed vegetable. This Bengali delicacy is usually made using prawns or fish. The stuffing is made of cashew paste and is shallow fried. It is tangy and spicy. It is a wholesome meal that can be served with rice or even with breads.

A must visit to enjoy their food and ofcourse this place is great for taking snaps to make your food journey more memorable. Recommended.
Will be back with another culinary experience. Till then Happy Eating üòä.

Proud member of Team Panchphoron

On the ground floor of the holiday inn, this is a gem indeed.

Ambience: Nicely decorated and bright lighting. Comfortable couches. A glass kitchen offers a view to what's cooking. Will set the mood for family gatherings or a date with the special one.

Staff: polite and courteous. Prompt service. Has fair knowledge of what they are serving.

Food: We had opted for the dinner buffet, so the starters we served on the table. There were three types of veg and non veg, equally tasty.
The main coarse were a huge hit with a selection of mutton, chicken, fish and prawn. All were of excellent quality except for the prawn and cooked well with loads of flavors in each dish.
There were live pasta and pizza counter. The spaghetti pasta in white sauce, which we had ordered stole the show.
The desserts section was equally strong with both bengali and western treats. Loved the range of pastry.

Overall: A gem of a place with excellent food and nice ambience. We bought coupons which would make the deal a tad cheaper. Well worth the money.

"THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER."
Had heard a lot about this place.. but it wasn't close to any of it... Breakfast at Social kitchen was a waste.. Tiny Spread...
"COLD FOOD" what a turn off.. 
Messing up with everything is okay but cold food is jus not done.. from waffles to chicken ssgs everything was cold .. spoilt the breakfast that I had been looking forward for months... 
Though the fresh pineapple juice was liked alot by my friend.. 
 When asked for coconut water  told it isn't in the buffet( though it's always included in other hotels)  so we decided to order ala cart .. was still refused and said it isn't available in the kitchen.. but when we had complained about the buffet and cold food they somehow got the coconut water out of nowhere..
Never going back there ever again. üòë

I've tried this place for 2 times, 1st on my birthday(last May) & 2nd on Mahasasthi. Both times they impressed me with their food quality&service. During the durga puja they served bengali food along with some north indian food. The menu was huge that I skipped few items in buffet. Starters were superb mostly the chicken kabab, it was mouth-watering. And the main course had so many options like crab, parshe fish, rara mutton, gandharaj murg, kolkata chicken biriyani in non-veg. I've not tried the veg main course as I'm a hardcore non-veg. In desserts there were rasgullas, gulab jamun, sandesh & many more pastries&mousse. One thing I really like about Social Kitchen is their quality of food. It was just superb.üëåüëå And also the ambience is classy & top-notch. One shouldn't miss this place. Must give a try.üòäüòÄ

Such delectable food with great decor, it's always an experience coming to Social Kitchen .
I Had the Paneer  Kulcha along with Murgh Aap Ki Pasand which literally melted in my mouth, the kulcha was super soft and the Murgh Aap Ki Pasand  was bursting with flavours not to be forgotten!

For dessert we had Gulab jamun, mud pastry which was delicious but the most amazing was the Cheese Cake.Overall it was a great experience and would like to visit here again.

Please don‚Äôt go with the pics and feel that this is the best place to have buffet. It was Navami, when we visited this place and we were taken to oynx hall for the the Bengali cuisine. At first, we were like okay with the menu for which we were charged ‚Çπ1000 per head and we head on for a seat. We were served with a welcome drink. Only god knows what was it. Felt like drinking chemicals. Wasn‚Äôt even chilled. So we went for the plates. The fish was raw and uncooked. The spaghetti was cold as hell and puris and tandoori rotis was not served hot. Coming onto the desert, only misti doi tasted good. They had strawberry mousse which was like okay .... it was just whipped cream with strawberry flavour. Couldn‚Äôt taste the chicken curry. By the time we went home all were complaining of stomachaches. I went there with my family. My little sis was also there. Her conditioned worsened and we had to see doctors. I don‚Äôt recommend this restaurant at all. Very much disappointed. In the Eve of Durga Puja these people have restored to cheap business practices.

I went to Social Kitchen with my family last week for my brother's birthday dinner. We had brought Nearby vouchers for Dinner Buffet.
The Holiday Inn branch in Kolkata is relatively new and Social Kitchen is it's in-house restaurant.
The ambiance was great and our expectation bars went higher.
We had to wait for sometime for the starters to arrive. The starters weren't upto the mark and I had decided on giving the place a bad review. But the main course & dessert made me change my mind.
What We Had---
Orange Flavoured Mocktail
Chicken Soup
Starters: Tandoori Chicken, Ajwaini Paneer Tikka, Fish Salt & Pepper, BBQ Potato
Main Course: Steamed Rice, Irish Lamb Stew, Pan Seared Fish In Olive Tomato Sauce, Chicken Saagwala, Chicken in Hunan Sauce, Chicken Biriyani
Chef's Choice Pizza & White Sauce Pasta (They have live Pizza & Pasta Counters)
Dessert: Creme Caramel, Orange Pastry, Strawberry Pastry, Mango Souffle, Chocolate Mousse, Chocolate Mudcake, Blueberry Frangipane Cake (There were some Indian Desserts as well which I didn't try)
What We Liked--
The main course was pretty good, especially the Irish Lamb Stew and the Pan Seared Fish. The dessert was great.
What We Didn't Like--
The starters didn't meet our expectations. The first plate of Fish Salt & Pepper was stale. The BBQ Potato served had a mix of fresh & stale pieces.
Also, it would have been great if they served ice creams in Desserts.
Pocket Pinch--
We got the Nearby vouchers for Rs. 749 per head. So it was pretty cheap compared to their actual buffet price of Rs. 1550.
Verdict--
Overall it was a satisfactory meal and we would love to come back.
Also, seeing the much talked about 'Chocolate Durga' wonderfully crafted by the chefs was like an icing on the cake.

We visited the hotel for its Durga Puja dinner buffet on Saptami. Mostly Bengali delicacies, the menu featured some North Indian as well as a couple of Chinese dishes. The food was average, while the mutton curry had chewy meat. For dessert we even found the Rasogollas to be sour. So much so, we had to complain and get the dishes replaced. For the price charged per person, the food was not upto the mark!

A very well decorated and spacious place to have food. Ambience is wonderful and so is the overwhelming service of the courteous staff. Hats off to the chefs who make such wonderful dishes. Each dish that I had was indeed really impressive. The whole eating experience was an immersive indulgence. I loved this place. Would love to visit frequently if it was a little cheaper though.

I generally never rate a 4,but yes excellent value for money and ambience!However i wish they served Beer,or had a wine list.Notwithstanding ,a pleasant and memorable dining experience,what sets it apart is that its simple .focus is on quality and Not Quantity in the buffet!!Waiting for them get their liquor license!!

I don't know if it's only to me or others who felt that the ratings they got in zomato,  they don't deserve the rating. The limited options they have and the price they charges,  one would get far better choices in town.
The buffet menu is very short and compact.
For starter they have only one veg and one non-veg item.
They have very limited main course as well
And the desserts are the worst part of them.
I never returned with such a dissapointment from a good rated restuarant in zomato.  This was my first time i had such a bad experience.
Though the food tasted good but the options of the items is something where it doesn't go.

If someone ask me then i would say not to visit and waste your time and money. There are lot of options available in town to try out.

The only rating is due to courtesy of the waiters and the food it had tasted okay.

There was nothing exceptional nor very delightful.

They even charged 5% extra as service charge of the total amount after applying 18% gst.

For me,  i'm not going to visit this restuarant again.

The restaurant has already garnered a lot of positive response from the foodies of the city. Naturally, my expectations were heightened as I stepped inside the well lit & copiously furnished indoors.

LOCATION- Located at Rajarhat, the restaurant is not at all difficult to find. The CC2 is nearby and serves as a prominent landmark.

STAFF- The service was prompt and the staff there is very well trained and professional. They welcomed each guest very heartily.

FOOD- THE FOOD IS GREAT. IT SERVES A WIDE VARIETY OF APPETISERS, SALADS, DESSERTS, STARTERS, AND MAIN COURSE.
EVEN THOUGH IF ONE FEELS FULL AFTER SAVOURING THE ECCENTRIC DISHES,THEY WOULD STILL OPT TO TASTE EVERY BIT OF THE ITEMS SERVED IN THE BUFFET.

IN CONCLUSION THE SOCIAL KITCHEN IS YOUR GO TO PLACE IF YOU'RE CRAVING FIR REALLY GOOD FOOD AND ALSO DESIRE EXTENSIVE VARIETIES OF IT.
MUCH LOVE. ‚ú®üíï

Social kitchen is one stop destination if you are looking for lip smacking multicuisine dishes. Located at a walking distance from cc2 this restaurant serves a wide range of food items. It is one of the prettiest places in the city to opt for dinning. This place aims to offer different flavours all prepared with the best quality ingredients. The food will leave you licking your fingers. They offer buffet as well as ala carte menu. They offer chinese as well as indian as well as continental dishes. The prices are also reasonable looking at the quality of food. So if you are looking to spend your holiday with good food and ambience social kitchen is the place.
Photo coming soon.

One more jewel added to Kolkata‚Äôs crown; Social Kitchen, Holiday Inn. I have been to Holiday Inn in a different city and was eagerly waiting for one in my own city. Team Munching Monks visit to Social Kitchen was for Bloggers Meet for their ‚Äò Durga Pujo Special Buffet‚Äô. The Buffet is reasonably priced at 1250 + tax available on four days from 26th to 29th September, 17.

I have visited this place multiple times and every time opted for buffet, be it lunch or dinner. Buffet spread is very good here. The options are huge in main course, salads and desserts section. I liked the cheese section, this was something new to me. Never had any separate cheese section in any other buffet I have visited. Good service and courteous staff.

[WARNING: A very lengthy review ahead. Please proceed at your own risk.]

Team Munching Monks, was invited over by Mr.Suman Chakraborty (Executive Chef at Social Kitchen) for trying out their Durga Puja Special Spread and Buffet.
Thank you for making our afternoon so memorable and delightful.üòÅ

For the Durga Puja Special Spread, we test tasted the following: (Pujo special buffet @Rs.1250.00+ GST for 4 days of Durga Pujo.)
1) Luchi ar Kosha Mangsho (4.75/5): WHAT A BEAUTY! SPLENDID! The luchis were crisp and the mutton was so tender. The kosha gravy was too good...A bit sweetish from the Caramelised onions - Just the way how a khaati bangali loves his kosha mangsho!This amalgamation of Loochi and Mangsho can set any bangali's heart on fire! This is the love story, every bengali person fantasizes about. Forget Romeo Juliet, for us, Loochi-Mangsho has to be the most beautiful pair ever created.

2) Daab Chingri (4/5) : Fresh prawns slow cooked with mustard , coconut milk and other spices, inside a coconut! The curry was beautifully silky and smooth with a prominent hint of coconut milk. Have this with some steamed basmati rice and you are good to go, with a satisfactory grin on your face. üòé

3)Chicken Gondhoraaj (4/5) : Gondhoraaj lebu has to be one of the most aromatic lemons ever! Be it with 'Musurir daal' or with 'Maccher Jhol', it always plays wonders with the palate. Chicken gondhoraaj emerges as a delightful dish with chicken infused with masala and Gondhoraaj lemon. This is what comfort food is. Really good!

4) Parshe Maccher Jhaal - I was too full to try this. Nevertheless, it looked too enticing!

Next, we buckled down to attack the buffet spread priced at Rs.899 + Gst for lunch and Rs.999 + Gst for dinner!
Here's my experience with the buffet dishes.üòÉüòÅ

~APPETISERS~
1) Chicken clear soup (3.85/5) : A tangy flavourful chicken broth with broccoli and cabbage. Enjoy it with some buttered dinner rolls for some extra comfort to the soul.

2) Crispy Chilli Potatoes (4/5) : A part of the live counter, this was a treat to both the vegetarians and non-vegetarians! Deep fried crisp potato fingers generously tossed with a sweet and spicy sticky sauce! Finger licking good.üòÅ

3) Tandoori Chicken (4/5) : Tandoori chicken was also a part of the live counter. The chicken was soft and juicy with a well charred and marinated outer coating and moist interior.

4) Red Bean Soup for Vegetarians. (Did not try)

‚óèAVERAGE: 4.03/5.

~SALADS~
4) Bacon and Melon salad (2/5) : A very strange combination which I never tried before. Sure, I love melons and bacon separately but together? Well, I had my doubts there. The amalgamation didn't work for me. There was no synchronisation of flavours. The melon was very fresh and the bacon was crisp and of good quality. But, Not a fan of this salad.

5)Trio Pepper, Tomato and Chicken Salad (3.5/5) : A very well made salad with sweet peppers, tomatoes and roasted chicken. It was tossed with a beautiful vinaigrette and white pepper powder!

6) Lamb with Exotic Vegetables (3/5) : Roasted lamb with yellow and green zucchini and broccoli. The flavours of the roasted lamb might come out as a strong flavour to people not accustomed to the taste of lamb.

7)Waldrof Salad (4/5) : Waldrof salad was excellent! With well cut red juicy apples and tangy granny smith apples flipped generously with mayonnaise and then topped with mint leaves. The best part of the salad was the fact that the apples retained their crunch. The concoction of sweet-salty-sour was indeed a bliss to the tastebuds!

8)Pasta Salad (3.5/5): A pretty nicely made salad. No complaints.

Salads I didn't try:
9) Egg corn salad.
10) Bell pepper and babycorn.
11) Cucumber and chickpea salad.
12) Raw Papaya Salad.
13) Couscous salad.

‚óèAVERAGE: 3.2/5.

~MAIN COURSE~
14) Chicken Biryani (3/5): Chicken Biryani was more like Pualo with chicken, egg and aloo. If you are expecting Kolkata Style biryani, then you will be dissapointed. Otherwise, a well mafe pulao, I'd say.

15) Methi Gosht (3.5/5) : Methi gosht was really good. The gravy was super flavourful with robust flavours acquired from the meat juices. Went really good with flaky butter naan.Would have given it a 4.5 had the mutton meat been softer. It was quite tough to tear apart.

16) Prawn Konkani Masala (3.25/5) : Not peculiarly Konkani in terms of flavour, but quite similar to Bangali Shorshe Chingri.

17) Vegetable Biryani (4.25/5) : Loved it! Very flavourful with rich aromatic spices and independent grains of rice. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved it more than the chicken biryani itself. üòç

18) Sliced Fish in Manchurian Sauce (4/5): Batter fried top notch basa fish doused in a regular asian sweet and spicy sauce with yellow and red bell peppers.

19) Chicken Roast (4.5/5) : Clearly the star of the main course and by far the best chicken roast I have had in a long, lonnnnggg time! The chicken had it's skin on and was elegantly roasted to perfection, maintaining the moistness of the meat. Loved it!üòÅ

20)Dhingri Palak (4/5) : Dhingri Palak is synonymous to Palak Mushroom and it was lip smackingly good! Do try this out with some heavily butter brushed naan! Food heaven. üò®

21) Paneer Makhni (4/5) : Pillowy soft paneer in a rich and creamy smooth makhni gravy! Thumbs up for this one!

22) Vegetable Hakka Noodles (3/5): Very Average to taste, I'd say.

From the Live Counter:
23) Pasta Aglio Olio (4.5/5) : Wow! We got another showstopper here! Al dente sphagetti tossed gracefully with garlic, chilli flakes, olive oil and chicken - It just had to be a stunner! Totally impressed. üòÅüòÄ

24) Thin Crust Pizzas (3.75/5) : Nothing to talk about here! The base was more like thin crust crackers but enjoyed binging on them nonetheless!

Dishes I didn't try:
25) Dahiwada.
26) Tadkewali Daal.
27) Daal Bhukhara.
28) Bengali Dum Aloo.
29) Sarson Baingan.
30) Caponata.
31) Stir Fried Vegetables.

‚óèAVERAGE : 3.81/5.

~DESSERT~
32) Gulab Jamuns (4.5/5): Piping hot, ghee (clarified butter) ladened kesari gulab jamuns were so good to even look at, let alone eating! Oh my goodness. I could have had a dozen of these beauties, have I had started with desserts from the very begining! üôÑ

33) Chocolate Truffle Cake (4.75/5) : A three layered cake sandwiched with whipped cream, overlayed with a thick coating of dark chocolate ganache and hazelnuts. The cake was so moist but equally rich at the same time! Worth all the calories.

34) Mango Mousse Cake (4/5)

35)Pineapple Souffle (3.5/5)

36) Dual Chocolate Pastry (3.5/5)

37) Fudgy Brownies (3.5/5) - A bit too dense for my liking. Wish there was some vanilla icecream to pair this up with! It would have been perfect.

Desserts I couldn't try:
38) Mishti doi.
39) Shondesh/Sandesh.
40) Mihidana.
41) Mini Blueberry Cupcakes.
42) Orange Souffle.
43) Blueberry Pastry.
44) Fresh Fruit Salad.

‚óèAVERAGE: 3.95/5.

It was an excellent afternoon and the food was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone!

‚óèFinal Conclusion:
FOOD : 4.25/5
SERVICE : 4.5/5 (Very Prompt)
Ambiance: 4.5/5.
Value for money: 4/5!

Hence, rating Social Kitchen with a 4.5/5!

Definitely Recommended.
Eat.Salivate.Repeat.üíó
Stay beautiful. üôàüíì
Happy eating.‚ù§‚ù§

33) Chocolate Truffle Cake (4.75/5) : A three layered cake sandwiched with whipped cream, overlayed with a thick coating of dark chocolate ganache and hazelnuts. The cake was so moist but equally rich at the same time! Worth all the calories.

34) Mango Mousse Cake (4/5)

35)Pineapple Souffle (3.5/5)

36) Dual Chocolate Pastry (3.5/5)

37) Fudgy Brownies (3.5/5) - A bit too dense for my liking. Wish there was some vanilla icecream to pair this up with! It would have been perfect.

Desserts I couldn't try:
38) Mishti doi.
39) Shondesh/Sandesh.
40) Mihidana.
41) Mini Blueberry Cupcakes.
42) Orange Souffle.
43) Blueberry Pastry.
44) Fresh Fruit Salad.

‚óèAVERAGE: 3.95/5.

It was an excellent afternoon and the food was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone!

‚óèFinal Conclusion:
FOOD : 4.25/5
SERVICE : 4.5/5 (Very Prompt)
Ambiance: 4.5/5.
Value for money: 4/5!

Hence, rating Social Kitchen with a 4.5/5!

Social kitchen is the only restaurant in holiday inn. Restaurant is situated near arsalan chinarpark and few minutes walk from cc2. Went there for buffet dinner. They had few items for starters as crispy corn, chicken wings,chicken tikka and pan fried fish. They serve you with a complementary drink too which is refilled when finished. We were give some orange drink with chat masala. There were 10-12 types of salads both veg and non-veg, chaats including Dahi vada and papdi chat. There was a cheese platter too. For main course we started with soup both veg and non-veg were available. They had a huge variety of main course dishes,Pasta and pizza live counter too. For any Indian bread you need to ask for it. Then finally comes the dessert which had different types of pastries, mousse and Bengali sweets. There was no icecream. All the items were awesome and the spread was worth the money spent!! Happy dining

Social Kitchen is so far the only restaurant inside Holiday Inn Kolkata. And we've already been here twice! The first was during their "Oriental Menu" festival and recently, during their "Ilish Menu" festival. The food was outstanding on both the occasions. Their buffet spread is expansive. From salads to chaat counter to the main course. Their buffet s priced well, and has a lot of meat and fish to choose from.¬†
I am personally a big fan of their desserts. The desserts are unique and so fresh. I can't get enough of their international desserts, and prefer it more than their Indian desserts.

The lunch buffet is an elaborate one, but not an evenly poised one. The have huge selection of salads and dessert. But starters restricted to only one item and main course is selective too. The live pasta and pizza counter are refreshing. Specially the pizza is very good. Salads are also very good and give you lot of option to customize. The main courses are good. They tried to give a local cuisine touch which people may like. The dessert section should have been better considering its a well know hotel chain worldwide.

Want to have Dinner with your family or friend with some lip-smacking multi cuisine dish? Then Social Kitchen is your one stop destination. Been there few days ago with my foodie group Munching Monks to attend Pre Puja Bloggers Meet.

The restaurant located near to CC2, few minutes‚Äô walk from Chinar Park. The restaurant located at the ground floor of the Holiday Inn Hotel. So not a hard thing to find it out.

The restaurant offers you a wide ranges of buffet menu as well as A la carte menu. The buffet menu contains Chinese dishes, as well as Indian and Continental dishes.

When it comes about starter, you will get various kind of Salad. From Baby Corn to fruits, everything is there in their list. Some has Indian Style and some has overseas feelings.

At main course, you will get from steamed rice to biryani and Chowmein too. This indicates, how well spread their buffet menus are. The variety is also available in case of Side items also. From traditional Indian dishes like Alur dom, sukto to continental Cuisines like Baked fish with cream and olive etc. They also serves you Awadhi items too, to fulfill your meat craving.

The dining section of Social Kitchen is also equipped with Live Pizza and kebab counter. The menu changes day to day. So why wait? Grab your own Pizza/Kebab of the day.

Everything is fair, when your ending is good. Yes, Social Kitchen lefts no place for dissatisfaction about items. From wide ranges of cakes to Pudding and muffins, everything is there to satisfy your sweet craving tummy.

As an ambiance, you will get a top premium feel. The stuffs are well behaved and very courteous. They ask you, what you need and their presentation is just outstanding. So kudos to the management.

If you ask about pocket pinch, it cost Rs. 899 + GST for Lunch and Rs. 999 + GST for normal buffet. During Puja days, a special buffet with lots of new puja special items will start, which costs only Rs. 1250 + GST. It will starts from 26th Sep and will end at 29th Sep.

The day we visit the restaurant, team Holiday INN introduced their first ever Chocolate Durga by a grand Press meet. Which is probably for the first time in Kolkata. The thing is hardly anyone wants to miss!So, a big thank you to Chef Suman Chakraborty for such warm invitation and special thanks to

Indulge yourself in the exotic gastronomical ven of the amazing variety of dishes which the "Social Kitchen" has to offer.

It's located near City Centre 2,Rajarhat.
The hospitality you receive from the moment you step in is second to none.
Talking about the interior designing,the decorative feature of Social Kitchen gives it that edge over it's competitors and also provides that beautiful scene and ambience to the foodies to enjoy their food in full harmony and beauty(A photographers paradise).

"FOOD PERSPECTIVE"

The striking feature of their buffet system is the presentation.

But better save the best for the last,the dessert section is that part of the buffet to die for.
Rich in taste,variety of flavours be it the classics or the ones with the modern twist.

Looking forward to visit soon.

Social Kitchen is a restaurant in the Holiday Inn hotel located close to Chinar Park.. The buffet here is amazing offering quite a variety in their spread..

Starters, both veg and non veg, were lip smacking..
Main Course was the highlight of the buffet.. There were a large number of options.. Everything was delicious, but the prawns deserve a special mention..

Social Kichen is located at the ground floor of 'Holiday Inn' and provides one of the best buffet service in town. The extensive plethora of food items in starters, mains and desserts sections can put some brands to shame. Couple with that unlimited drinks and voila! You are in food heaven. The behaviour of the management towards the guests deserve special priase. They truly make the experience a grand one. Plus the location is very much accessible which takes another brownie point from me. The desserts section here will be more complete with the addition of ice-creams. The management will surely look into it.

Overall,come to Social Inn for a complete food experience. You will leave the place but will take abundant beautiful memories back home.

Have visited the place few months ago. They have big brand name. Hotel entrance is shining and catches your eyes instantly. Restaurant's tables and buffet spreads are very beautifully arranged. Staffs are also polite. But the main thing is food is not tasty here. Except welcome drink, one nonveg starter,dal makhani and two or three desserts, no food is tasty at all. Who is interested to eat prawn malaikari and rara mutton or mutton kosha with the gravy being totally tasteless. Food is fresh though. They should remember that few five star hotels in Kolkata serve mouth watering buffet food. I suggest them to change their plan.

Situated near the Chinar Park Chowk, Social Kitchen (inside 5 star Holiday Inn chain) is an overall entertainer in terms of food. Noting down my experiences:

I went for buffer dinner (bought coupon from Nearbuy). I didn't want to eat till full of my tummy, but wanted to taste almost the items (of course I could not succeeded in tasting all items, as there is a lengthy list of items in buffet).

Starters - Lots of varieties of salads (veg / non-veg), served starters were good. (rating 3.5 out of 5)
Soups - Overall good, but not great. (rating 2.5 out of 5)
Main Course - Most of the items were of international standards. Per International Standard, the food is expected to be half cooked, so that the taste of the food is not damaged by so much of spices we put in. However in Indian style, we want the taste of spices instead of the food. I liked the taste overall - good, but could have been better. (rating 3 out of 5)
Desserts - Just one term to express all my feelings "fabulous". (rating - 6 out of 5)

Went on a rainy Saturday afternoon while the hilsa festival was going on.We did opt for the lunch buffet and ordered borishali style ilish fry along with it ( just couldn't resist the sumptuous sounding hilsa dishes).
The buffet had tons and tons of salad options with a variety of dressings and bread rolls.Big thumbs up for it.The choices were endless and whets your appetite.
Now the disappointing part of the entire meal..there were no proper appetizers sans the make your own chaat platter and some besan pakodas.Sure you have your choices of soups and a pizza and pasta counter but no starters?? Disappointing.
The main course options were the usual fare at buffet offerings including four non veg options of fish,chicken,prawn and mutton.Yay!
Dessert left me spoilt for choice and there was nothing to fault.Kudos for not going overboard with the sweet quotient of the desserts!
Now coming to the best part of the meal - my much awaited borishali style hilsa fry marinaded with sweet himsagar mango and served alongside a raw mango salsa. The combination may sound kinda weird but believe me it was an absolute firework on my tongues.Kind of like a palate cleanser but then again only a true blood Bengali can consider hilsa fish as a palate cleanser!!!!
Jokes apart, the fish was the freshest of all hilsa I have ever tasted almost melted in my mouth sans all the prickly bones that I had to pick and the marinade was totally off the charts!! Can't stress enough how much I loved it.I regret not ordering more of the hilsa items.Would definitely go back for the hilsa options till it's available.

Today I was there with my sisters... It's exactly located near Chinnarpark, beside Brand Factory. We had buffet lunch.. Now comes to food portion and quality.. They served a perparation of potato, panner, and papri chaat for veg. And for nonveg there was Chicken, grilled fish.The chicken which they served as starter was yummm.. but the fish disappointed me. Then over to main course. They have a huge counter for only salads, which was pretty impressive. I personally really liked - chickn salad, lamb salad was too good, peas egg salad, fish corn salad, and then pasta one. The most interesting part they have live counter of pizza and pasta. We had veg and nonvef pizza.. those were perfectly cooked.. loved it's thin crust and portion was pretty good. Then they have quite good number of main dishes includes- lemon fish, noodles, chicken, mutton, chicken biriyani. And the last not the least is the desert counter.. they have around 12-15 items. The mango misti took my heart..
One can have a perfect date or family lunch over there.. Perfect place of good place with awsome decor.

Heard a lot about this place...finally could make it with my sisters for a Sunday lunch. We had opt for  buffet which is Rs. 1060/- including all taxes that is pretty fair for the brand to offer. Few things are truly recommendable...
1. Staff is courteous 
2. Ambience is good
3. Veg options are pretty good since one of us was veg so she was really happy to get so many options.
4. Huge spread of salads and desserts both were like yummmmmmmmm.
5. Main course dishes were good
6. Starter options were less in comparison to other restaurants where buffet is served...only 2 non veg starters were there
Overall a nice experience...would love to recommend to others to pay a visit once...m sure u wont regret

Had a huge expectation on this joint as it is a coffee shop of a renowned international chain. Ambiance is quite trendy and waiting staffs are courteous. We tried the dinner buffet and the spread was quite elaborate. Chicken biryani was pathetic, fish was stale and I couldn't able to find the body of prawnsüç§ üëé. Tapas and dessert were up to the mark. But thin crust pizza and spaghetti in white sauce were lip-snaking.

Have been waiting to try this place and specially after reading all the positive reviews just cudnt wait. So finally went tonight for dinner with family and we were very happy with the ambience, spread and staff courtesy.
Salad bar was really good. Had loads of amazing stuff to choose from.
The only drawback I felt the lack of choice of fresh fruits. Every buffet place along with it's desert counter keeps a choice of fruits for ppl who don't want to have desert.
Other than that a great dining experience!!

Had lunch buffet. In starters, Paneer fish pizza and pasta were given which were good. In the main course, some dishes like veg au gratin,roasted chicken,mutton were good. Chicken biryani had no chicken in it,only aloo and egg. The grilled fish in lemon butter sauce had stale fish probably. Desserts were good but then we could not find icecream which was a disappointment. Hospitality is great, and so is the ambience of the place. Though coupon said unlimited soft drinks,only one complimentary mocktail was served. They should correct the coupon then!

A new fine dining in the town. This restaurant is in the newly opened Holiday Inn in Rajarhat. And yes the building will definitely draw your attention if you pass by, and when we found that it serves great buffet also , it was in the wishlist.

Location:
_____________
it is located in Rajarhat, more precisely near city centre 2. If you are going towards airport , it will be just before chinar park on the right hand side.

Ambiance:
______________
The restaurant is at the ground floor of holiday Inn. It is quite nice. Simple and cleanly decorated.

Food:
__________

We opted for their buffet. There was a welcome drink. It was unlimited. For our case it was watermelon mojito. It was nice and quite refreshing.

Now they have a quite large amount of buffet spread.

¬©Starters:
__________
There were two starters one veg and one non veg
They serve it on the table.
‚úì Chicken Lal mirch - Chicken tandoori. It was very nice.
‚úì Aloo sauted in sauce - it was not excellent but nice one.
¬© Soup
__________

Veg and non veg soup option was there. But I didn't like the taste to be honest.

¬© Chat counter
__________________
The chat taste just owssum. You can prepare your own or ask them to serve on the table.

The doing bada was also delicious.

¬© Salad counter:
___________________
There were nearly 15 type of salad spread including veg and non veg. It was pretty nice and broad.

¬© Pizza counter
__________________
The thin crust pizza taste very nice. You have the only option of veg and chicken pizza. It was served on the table.

¬© Pasta counter
__________________
In our visit we had not tasted this. But for your information- they have the veg and non veg option with choice of sauce. That was served on table only.

¬© Main courses:
___________________

They have nearly 7 items of veg and 5 items of non veg main. We tasted mostly the non veg items. Some of them are really good. Best part is you have so many option in veg and in non veg.

‚úì chicken biriyani- very nice.
‚úì kadai mutton- excellent.
‚úì Fresh water Prawn in orange chili sauce - tiger prawns, going excellent with the noodles.
‚úì Pan seared fish with tomato orle sauce - this was boneless. Taste okay type.
‚úì Diced chicken with spicy Hunan sauce - it was a chinies dish , not remember the exact name. But it was just owssum.

In veg didn't try many but the option was many.
‚úì Butter chili Garlic noodles - tasted, very nice one.
‚úì stir fried vegetables
‚úì American Corn Ficacio
‚úì Moog Dal ki tadka - excellent one.
‚úì Paneer korma
‚úì Dum Aloo banarasi
‚úì Bhindi piyaz posto
‚úì subzz biyani handi
‚úì veg biryani
‚úì steamed rice

¬© Dessert:
______________
Undoubtedly the most owsum segment. With nearly 15 type of dessert. All are so tastey. But yes ice cream is not there. But misti doi is there. So no regret. It was just superb.
There were a lot of varieties. Cakes, moose, doi, Bengali misti. A perfect sweet end of your meal.

¬© Service:
__________

It was damn good. Hospitality and behaviour of the stuff was very good.

______________________

Overall a very nice experience. If you are not only lean to starter in the buffet. You should have try this one.

Now the lunch buffet cost 899+tax. But we bought a five people cuppon from nearby app. It was 3500 INR including all. Single person cuppon is also available there which is 750 INR.

To the management: we had a lovely experience. Hope to visit you again to try the ala carte menu.

To all : give it a try. For nice food, nice ambiance :)

Located just opposite aminia ,chinar Park and beside the Spencers.easy to locate. Hospitality spot on .service awesome .buffet was great with impressive starter choices (they included mini oven baked pizzas!!yay!!üòç) and main course consisted of chicken ,mutton, biryani(veg and non veg )and of course prawn (size was good.thumbs up for that).I did not taste the main course though. Bt my fellow foodie was more than happy while tasting the main course. I gorged on their desserts.their desserts are too good to be believed.and I ate my heart out. Over all these folks really did a great work. And I hope they keep this up for future as well.

Another 5 out of 5 deserving candidate. Me along with my family went for breakfast here. And we were greeted with quite enthusiastic people , young and fresh and smiling. The restaurant has nice decor, awesome variety of food and of course host of nice people.

Food: everything you can expect in a breakfast. It is only second to Lalit Great Eastern in the spread. But it had essentially everything to soothe your hunger and your tastebuds. Sausage, baked beans , cheese omlette and pancakes deserve a special mention ..

Decor: soothing to the eyes, beautiful in one word.

Hospitality: one of the best.
Special thanks to our hosts Mukesh and Pralay. Mukesh was always present at the table to look after our needs .. Pralay was also very helpful in every possible way.

Suggestion/recommendation: A 5 star property with 5 star quality food and people is worth visiting. Highly recommended.

Social kitchen of holiday inn is one of the must try restaurants in kolkata. I have visited thrice and everytime they managed to increase my love for this place. Not only the food but also the behaviour of the service team and chefs are really warming. Dessert and salad section gives a wow factor to the buffet menu. Main courses are also a must try. Overall it's good place to visit with family friends and loved ones.

H"aww"lid"eh" Inn!!! What should I say about you! The expression of the prologue has precisely implied my impression of yours!!
Well, visited this place with lots of expectations and it has almost turned into ashes...  Ailed our spinal cord and journeyed for 2 hours to visit this place and all we had got is the traditional idiom that we can get to hear from different people and different places "All that glitters is not gold"...
They undoubtedly have a great variety of items in the buffet but unfortunately most of the items are similar to that idiom stated above... outwardly fascinating but tasted dull and not so good...
The complementary drinks were not at all good...
The soups though, looked good and tasted beautiful...
The other starters were mostly fully disaster...
The main course though was pretty good..
Prawn in lemon butter sauce is something to drool over, the corn in white sauce is also lip smacking...
Chicken biryani mutton kasha and chilly chicken tangra style were extremely delicious on the other hand!!
Now let's come to the dessert section. Their dessert section is the only thing that had made us feel that the money and the long journey have not went completely in vain... But since the dessert section is the best part of their buffet, I think they should add more variety to this section
All the desserts were too good and delicious excepting for the ice cream which smelled like nail polish...
The staffs were co-operating and friendly...
P.S If they give more attention to the starter section, H"aww"lid"eh" Inn will surely turn into "hawwwwwliday Inn....

So this friend of mine had her engagement party here. 
I will give the details about the levels where they can cheat you. 
They gave the starter and drinks but in tiny glasses and were not interested to serve the starters. 
The buffet was equally bad .
They charged us 4K extra adding some random tax and on asking , the management got scared and said not to inform higher authority since they can get sacked  . My friend's dad was kind enough not to take any legal action . 
Then thirdly they threw away the complimentary cake leftover and fourthly it was a ritual to save up the garland exchanged by the newly weds . But they threw away that as well. 
This was my experience with an international brand . 



This place is a total crook. Management people quote different prices from different people for event bookings . Total thugs I say! 
And the women have the audacity to lie on your faces with a smile . I wonder what upbringing in this and why the higher management hire people of

This is the time of Monsoon and In Bengal Monsoon dont just come with the heavy rain but also comes with The queen of fish Hilsa or Ilish.when it comes to the Hilsa then no one can make Hilsa dishes like the Bengali‚Äôs does. There are several preparations you can make make with this fish like ‚Äì Iish paturi, Ilish vaja, Ilish Vapa, Sorshe ilish etc. This is the time of the month when you can find this fish in almost every household in Bengal. Social Kitchen in Hotel Holiday Inn are celebrating the month of monsoon with the Hilsa Festival. various kinds of Hilsa preparations are there in their festive menu like : Khichuri with Ilish Mach Vaja, Pudina Ilish with Masala Rice, Ilish Beguner Jhol with Steamed Rice, Ilish er Aam Kasundi, Ilish Paturi Jasmine Rice.
                                                                ...

Monsoon is just at the doorstep to arrive in Bengal and the the craze of seafood is at it‚Äôs peak. ¬†And what fish can be more special than the ‚ÄúHilsa‚Äù aka ‚ÄúIllish‚Äù. The market is stocked up with various types of fishes. Ilish (Hilsa) fish is a Bengalis culinary delight .There is Ilish macher bhappa,paturi and a simple fish fry . This fish is high in fat content ,fish fat in fact is good for health .They have unique taste and flavor . As a Bengali, it‚Äôs quite obvious that i love food, and fish is what we love. Doi Illish, Sorshe Illish, Begun diye Illish er Jhol , Illish paturi, Vapa Illish, Illish Polao and it goes on and on. Social Kitchen, Hotel Holiday Inn‚Äù are organizing Ilish festival to celebrate the arrival of Monsoon. Holiday Inn, one of the recent additions to the 5 star hotels in Calcutta. Social Kitchen is a dining outlet that serves Indian, Asian and Continental cuisine. Polite staff, beautifully decorated and luxurious lobby, decent and comfortable sofas and chairs, ¬†and I‚Äôm simply speechless now. The location is just perfect for exploring the City of Joy and it‚Äôs just a few minutes from the airport too. I have been here with Team Panchphoron to attend¬†their Ilish Festival and it surprised me like anything.

Ambience, hospitality, service , food all are good. 

Specially want to mention the Salad and desert part. Extremely good. 

Had a chance to talk to the executive chef Pankaj, extremely humble person. knowledgeable guy. understands the taste of a foodie. he offered us a special dish called teriyaki chicken, Japanese dish and it was awesome. special mention the mayonnaise served with this.

I would like to recommend only couple things here.

1) few more item and and variety in starter would do the trick.
¬†
2) I don't know why waiters are more eager to replace the plates as soon as possible. 
it seems they are in a hurry. Please stop doing that.¬†

I would like to visit again.

I happened to visit this place along with four other people for my birthday dinner. Residing near rajarhat made me decide to try it out for the first time. Saving on my transportation time along with the option for luxury dining made to hop into this place. There was ongoing oriental special menu.I expected much from Social Kitchen given the stamdard it has set. But, was greatly disappointed with the slows service and poor choice of buffet menu. Whatsoever, I went ahead and I only gave my points for the salad section and desserts. Starters were served cold and tasted substandard. Main course were too salty and bland too. The food might taste better on other days but that day it spoilt my mood overall and we  were left disappointed.

Holiday inn a famous international brand recently opened up in kolkata and social kitchen is its in house restaurant. Well the entrance to the restaurant is a straight walk from the mains and is a bit conjested and confusing. I wish they had more space. In comparison to the other branches in India this branch is pretty tight. However their interiorS are well done & maintained. Their staffs are really well groomed and courteous. On our entry to the restaurant we were served passion fruit juice which was refreshing. Then we straightaway went for their buffet which is Rs 899 excluding tax. So basically with SGST and CGST @ 9 % each it came to rs 1060/- per person. 

Now coming to the food- for starters they had amritsari fish, chaat and crispy chilly baby corn. Since i am a carnivore i asked to be served the fish which was basically deep fried fish in batter & was ok. The chaat was served anywhichways which too was nothing new, you get them on the streets of kolkata all the time. Then came the real deal. They had a huge layout and the salads were absolutely amazing. They had a ton of veg and non veg salads that comprised of chicken mushroom salad  which was ok, fish salad which was yum, egg salad was a let down, bacon salad which too was good,paneer peas salad, potato salad, hummus which again wAs excellent with vatiety of sauces and pastas as bonus. They were all top notch in terms of taste and quality. Next were the mains, we tried the shrimp which was really bland and tasteless and chewy with runny gravy, lemon garlic fish was to die for. I am not big fish person but this was delicious & had no smell. Next was the murg biryani which was average and mutton kolhapuri. The mutton was well done but the gravy lacked the zing & taste. Their soups however was quite delicious and tasty. Well they had a ton of options for the vegans too. Now coming to the hero of the buffet layout- their deserts. Since the mains were a let down, they again won me over with their desserts which included indian sweets to variety of pastries to mango souffle and black forest pudding. They nailed it in this section. Very international approach and grand indeed. 
 The buffet was definitely worth the price and considering it's international reputation this price is expected. I just hope they work their starters to kickstart the buffet on a happy note.

The ambience of the place is on point. It was quite crowded considering that yesterday was a weekday, which is a good sign. The staff was polite and cordial. Now coming to the food, the starters were good, the Chaat counter and salad counter were nice, the main course had varieties but everything lacked that zing. Everything was nice and not at the same time. The Dessert Counter was great. There were nearly 10-12 types of desserts. I were in dessert heaven. Overall, it was a nice place to dine at.

Had Lunch buffet on 02.07.17

Review:

Starters: 2.5 /5. (Needs improvement both quantity and variety wise )
Salads: 3.5/5. 
Main course: 4/5.
Desserts: 4/5. 
Service : 3/5. 

If you compare with other 3 star / 4 star buffets ( I don't think it's a 5 star property though the official website says so ) ; at a price of 899/- + 18% GST; it's one of the cheaper choices and can be called 'value for money'. Do check out the Nearbuy / Dineout deals for the place too.

Its a new place for quality buffet.  A part of the Holiday Inn.  The ambiance is really good. The decorations gives u a wonderful feel.  Now the main and the best part. FOOD- Well of course the best part. The foods really good.  The variety is also in plenty. Hands down I had the best RARA GHOST in the world here.  The biriyani was good and so were the starters.  Starters are served at the table,  fresh n hot.  Plenty of options for the vegans as well.  The desserts are good but can be better.  
I purchased the dinner vouchers from nearby at a 25% discount so totally worth it. 
Highly recommended. Well I went with my fiancee and she totally loved it.  Hence I totally recommended it.if ur fiancee loves it it has to be good. 
Ambiance-9
Food quality-8.5
Value for money (purchased from nearby)-9.5

Today on 2nd July 2017, visited this place and following is my experience. My friend wants to give us a treat and we were searching some good buffet places.Thanks to near buy for making it easy for us. Soon we book the coupon we made a reservation for a weekend lunch. I reached little close to 1pm and exchange the coupon details at counter. The dine in place is in the ground floor of Holiday inn.I was sitting in the lobby and waiting for the arrival of other members.Finally we were escorted to our table reserved for us. The starter was served at the table. We had chicken tandoori and Fish in black pepper salts. Potato tossed with chilly sause and corn kebab were in veg starter section. The chicken was bit cold at first instance and in the repeat as per request they served a hot bowl. I felt both the non veg starter could be better.I like the corn kebab. It just remind me the galowti kebab. The moment it enter into your mouth it melts. We tested the palak soup and the chicken coriander soup. The veg soup is the winner here. Next I moved to my favourite salad section. It was spreads beautifully with some veg and non veg ones. I like the fusion salad with green apple and curd. Tested the dahi papdi in chat section. The pizza was horrible.In main course the Hakka noodles was just OK with less oily.I really like the mutton but chicken Biriyani was a spoiler. The shrimp tasted with steam rice with palak-dal and lemon. The combination was brilliant. We moved towards the desert section. First I tried the caramel custard which I found is not up to the mark. We were served a glass of mocktail as we made our booking through nearbuy .Most of us liked it.The experience was nice hope I shall visit once more in future.

We went there at 23rd of June. Ambiance was fabulous and the decorations made the dining more romantic so 5/5 for Ambiance.

Starters were not that good as I thought of also options were only 2.
1 veg (crispy chilli babycorn -1 non veg fish kabab)
None of them were so satisfying.
The veg menus in main course was good
Please go by the pictures for names.
In non veg -Tawa Fish deserves 6/5.
Apart of it Chicken biriyani and Lamb was good.
Other chicken items were not upto the mark.
For me It almost turned into a veg buffet.
But options were much more to go with.
They have a large variety of fruits and salads..
And last but not the least ... Desserts were good(4/5) with 10-12 options.
In my opinion they should work in the services part also they should look up for some different items in main course than what it is right now specially in the nonveg section.Or betterment of taste will be highly appreciated.
I would not suggest it right now as they need a lot of improvements.

My husband and I were there for lunch. It was a bit crowded on that weekend to we had to wait for approx 15 mins before getting our table. I liked the attitude and behavior of the staffs pretty much. We opted for buffet lunch. There were a long number of items in food. I loved their choices of salads. Their Dahi Vada is a must try.The foods from live counter was also impressive. They served starters as ordered and also timely taking asking about the taste and preference. Mutton and Prawn was awesome in taste. Each and every item was good in flavour and taste in  the long list of options . Lastly the desserts, best desserts I hv had in any restaurant in Kolkata. I tasted almost all the desserts as they were quite attractive in presentation and also none of them disappointed me in taste. 
I forget to mention about the decor and ambience in the beginning. They r also good. Anybody can opt this for romantic dates as well. Overall it's a must go option for dine out in the city.

Excellent ambience, food quality is good service can be improved a lot further. Possibly not fully tuned up for handling a large group as we went for s group dinner on a Friday. Starters were mixed and they seem to serve a lot of veg starters morw than the non-veg starters we were asking to be served. Main course had a great variety of salads. Dessert collection was also great.

Most common reason why this place is so highly rated is definitely for its Food & Service. The buffet spread is ¬†elaborate as expected. The salads are really nice. The main course is largely Indian . The desserts are however pretty good and the highlight of the buffet. 

Food: 5/5

Staff: 5/5

Ambiance: 4.5/5

I visited this place recently and I was quite impressed with the entire experience. Located near chiner park..I found this place to be very attractive. The ambiance was great. Staff was very friendly and service was prompt. I won't say the entire buffet spread was great.. but there were a few things that I loved. Among the starters the paneer preparation was very good and also the fish. The best thing about the main course was the chicken biryani. And desserts? Well! I loved all them.

An adequate breakfast layout with various vegetarian and non vegetarian options. The south indian options were very good (not very authentic though) especially idli and dosa. However north indian cuisine options like maybe poori-bhaji could be offered. Fruits options did not appeal much. Excellent attending staff. Good coffee!üëçüëçüëåüëå‚ò∫Ô∏èüòä

In a few words my experience with this restaurant was disgusting, disappointing, frustrating and many more of the same genre... First we booked a table at 9pm... Even while reaching there we called them up and informed that we would be there in another half n hour... Unfortunately due to the heavy traffic we finally reached there at 9.15pm... they said we were late by 15minutes and our table was given to someone else... We finally got a table at around 10.10pm... and by 10.40 the waiter turned up and said they would be closing the buffet by 11.. so we were asked to take all food at once... This entire gesture was truly pathetic and disappointing... Talking about the service... Spotted plates. Spotted table mats unpolished cutlery. Waiters spilling food and beverage during service... I didn't expect these type of unprofessionalism from them.. being in a 5 star hotel and listening that they don't serve alcohol pisses me out... Now talking about the food. The spread was very average compared to the pocket pinch... The complimentary black current beverage was quite good and refreshing... In starter the fish and chicken was damn dry... The panner Malai kabab did not have any kind of seasoning whatsoever... The other dishes was also very average... Basic salads where the taste cannot go bad.. yet the baba ganoush tasted awful... The best thing there was the non veg pizza and the spaghetti Alfredo.. then in main course... The biriyani was overspiced... The prawns were as usual frozen and thus tasted like rubber... The lamb dish was good... There was no paneer in palak paneer... The dal makhni was also good along with bread... Speaking of deserts. This was so far the worst desert spread I have ever tasted in my life... Hard cakes. Salty brownies.. the staff was not able to recognize the dishes... The chocolate was nothing more than a pinch of cocoa powder mixed into a litre of whipped cream... They had moong dal halwa and I swear it was the worst desert I have ever tasted... It was just a tasteless dry Sandy crap... I don't recommend this place at all... People who are planning to visit this place... Please go to barbeque nation... Much much better for the same amount...

I went there with my family to celebrate my dad's birthday.
Well they gave us a warm welcome and were very courteous.They served us a wlcome drink.
After that we started with a soup and they served the starters along with it. There were  paneer, chicken and fish item. All the starters was more or less decent.
Coming to the main course.
I had a lot of expectations from the main course but was gravely disappointed.
There wasnt any suitable side dish to have with the biryani. There was lamb curry but the curry wasnt thick and the lamb was undercooked, was unable to chew it properly.
There was a raw smell coming from the prawns.
The paneer tasted average.
After that I was not willing to try the other side dishes so I asked for pizza and white sauce pasta at the live pizza counter.
The pasta was decent but the pizza was so-so.

Then I went to have dessert, the dessert section was nicely spread.
The mishti doi was splendid, it was the best item I had altogether.
The pudding, mousse and pastry was also delightful.

Bottomline is that the dessert section and salad sections are decent.
Although they have to work a lot in their main course section.

Wonderful experience!!! My family and I had breakfast there this morning for Father's Day after I got vouchers on Nearbuy. I am not really a foodie so I won't comment on the quality of food, suffice to say that the buffet is quite extensive. Yes, the breakfast buffets at ITC, Taj, and Hyatt might be slightly better. But I don't think there is anywhere else in Kolkata where you can get something similar for this price.

The quality of service is exemplary. Waiters were very attentive but not hovering. Everyone was always smiling and offering to help if anyone looked lost or undecided.

The ONLY reason for my 4.5 rating (as against 5.0) is that, although their bakery section was extensive enough (breads, croissants, muffins, etc.), I wish they had a proper dessert section or at least various types of doughnuts, considering it is an American franchise. Also, a few special items focused towards children would make it more interesting for them and make the total experience for the family much more enjoyable, e.g. chocolate milk, mango pudding, or some small cream cakes, etc.

Perhaps some of the desserts from lunch / dinner can be incorporated into breakfast?

The chicken stew and lamb stew were excellent. The vegetable hakka noodles seemed a little out of place.

This is a new place and is located near chinar park. You shall have to take a few minutes of walking from there.If you dont visit without a reservation, you will be asked to wait for a while in the lobby, a place that is beautifully decorated.
They provide you a wide range of choices in the buffet. 
The ambience here is pure class.
The dessert section offers malai chana that I found delicious and the best of the lot.

Went for lunch and the spread for buffet was extraordinary poor. No North Indian dishes, only food pertaining to Bengali taste. They served pizza which was the worst I ever had. Infact a road side stall could have made a better pizza. The pasta was too hard , incompletely cooked, it was a total disaster. 
They served a drink which was good , when we asked for another round , again disaster. No sugar , no lemon. I can go on and on , but I am so frustrated that I don't want to say anymore other Than recommend to completely avoid.

The service is very poor, if u guys do like food, come to this place- but don't expect service. I asked for starter, they have not served it even after 30 mins as well. Feeling like we came here for free food and they are not even bothered to pay attention. Holiday Inn a great brand that is why we came to this place but the service is worst in the lot.
I am very much disappointed.
If u love to spend time with your family with good food better not to come here. Instead kolkata is food hub, so go and explore new places..
The price is also on a higher side and we can expect at least good service. In this competitive market why they are behaving like this I did not understand . 
I would suggest please avoid this place and go to some good restaurants like Tamara, bbq nation, hopipola etc.

This review is long due. So after my last visit day before, I decided to finally pen down my feelings and reactions about this place. Music is low and slow, ambience is good and the decor is quirky but one thing which makes it all for the rest is quality of food and great hospitality, they still do not have the liquor license at place once it comes I am sure this place would rock, it is definitely one of the best location for a family dining experience in the city. I am looking forward to many more good times in this gem of a place. Try out the Chicken teriyaki, caesar salad, hara bhara kebab and tandoori jheenga.

Well there was not a single dish which I liked. We went for buffet dinner. Right from the welcome drink to the starters to the main course the food was below average. When you are charging above the average market rates you should provide such services. The welcome drink tasted like jaljeera with color, the paneer in the starter was neither marinated well not grilled properly, the Hara bhara kebab cld have been better. The noodles were sticking to my teeth, that means it was undercooked.A world renowned chain like Holiday inn can't afford such mistakes. The pasta was tasteless, there was no flavour. The white sauce pasta seemed as if they had boiled pasta and put it in milk. I guess you guys don't know how to make white sauce or were too lazy to do that. The indian main course was okayish. The waiters were in a rush to clear our tables and would have interrupted us atleast 10teams saying sir are you done. If am done I wld leave, you don't have to snatch away my plate. The spread wasn't being refilled, I was waiting for pita bread, the entire time but it never got refilled. The only good thing about the spread was desserts. It was a pretty decent spread of desserts. Though I feel the mousse shld have been chilled and there should have been more flavours of desserts apart from chocolate. Plus there should be different flavours of syrups, nuts, chocolate chips, chocolate sauce to be sprinkled over ice cream. Overall the experience was disappointing. Wouldn't recommend people to spend so much money, not worth it.

We chose this place to bid one of my friends farewell. Its a newly opened restaurant along with the Holiday Inn hotel near Chinar Park opposite to Arsalan. When we entered we thought this to be a pretty decent place with good interior decorations and well behaved staffs. But the kitchen people are not so great. They still lack in timely delivery of food, a bit clumsy and not much attentive. We had to ask for water individually everytime we needed it. Ambience was good though. Now coming to the food, they have a nice spread but no starters in lunch buffet. Instead they provide pizza and pasta through live counters. We ordered a non veg pizza and one portion pasta in red sauce and one portion pasta in white sauce. The Pasta was decent while the pizza was way below the par.it was burnt and felt like cream cracker biscuit. They have 18 types of salads which were good but unnecessary. The main course was really great. I loved their Kolkata style chicken biryani and Rara Gosht and prawn. The other items were also good. Coming to the dessert section they have 10 -12 types of desserts. They were good but not great except for Baked Rasogolla which was like heaven. I would like to mention their mocktail also. As part of our Nearbuy voucher they have provided us Lichi Sharbut. It was decent but when asked for the varieties they refused by saying they are only serving Lichi sharbut today.

Overall its a 3.5/5 experience.

P.S. It has costed us 799/-

We went to this place for having lunch buffet on a Friday after seeing quite a few positive reviews about the restaurant. However,  we were utterly disappointed with the quality of the food.  There was no prawn item as mentioned in Zomato or some other sites which was a shocker for us. Even the mutton and chicken preparation were not up to the mark. Only the fish item was somewhat tasty. Having said that,  I must say that the deserts were fantastic. Long story short,  the buffet is way too costly for the kind of food offered.

This place has become quite popular because of their lavish lunch buffet.
I loved the interior of this restaurant.
We were welcomed with soft drinks of our choices.
‚Ä¢Starter-Initially we were disappointed since there were no specific starters as such but the other food here totally compensates for it.
We began our meal with chicken soup which tasted amazing.
I tried a plate full of many of their veg and non veg salads.
Some mentionworthy are chicken salad,baby corn egg,bacon salad and squid ring salad.
We had two smoked sausage pizza and chicken penne pasta in white sauce from the live counter.
The thin crust pizza with generous amount of sausages was absolutely lipsmacking.
Now,moving on to the maincourse,there is a lot to choose from both veg and non veg section.
‚Ä¢Maincourse-Few of the veg items which I had are sabji biryani,paneer makhani,steamed rice,yellow dal and dum aloo.I loved the paneer item.
The non veg items included chicken biryani which was very delicious.There was Mutton kosha,Prawn malaikari which were fresh and tasted nice.
The chicken curry was average.
Also we had noodles and baked fish.
The fish was not upto the mark,hard pieces tedious to chew.
‚Ä¢Dessert-The dessert section here pure bliss.I had almost all of their desserts.From ice cream,brownies,mousse,caramel pudding,fruit salad,rosogolla,sondesh,it had almost everything to allure our tastebuds.
‚Ä¢Coffee-Coffee is also a part of the buffet.We had two steaming hot cappucino and cafe latte.I loved the coffee.
It was a great experience here.
The staffs are friendly.

We visited this place on a Friday evening with family members. First thing I must say this place is not like other big hotels in the city. The entrance is very complicated. Also the set up is not as big as other Holiday inn hotels in other cities. But when it comes to food I must say I am really satisfied. The decorations are good inside and the ambience is good. Two of us went for the buffet, 3 went for alacarte. I took the honey roasted pork which was amazing, I highly recommend. The buffet food was also good and in desert the choice was many.

I went to this place not very expectantly wrt food (being vegetarian), but was pleasantly surprised. We decided to go a la carte instead of for the buffet. Service as well as food quality was excellent. Starters, main course as well as desserts. The breads could be slightly better. Must mention very warm service provided by Pralay from Howrah - with a smile.

Expect yr order to be served fast unlike usual five star hotels.

Hope you maintain the service and food quality

Also the set up is not as big as other Holiday inn hotels in other cities. But when it comes to food I must say I am really satisfied. The decorations are good inside and the ambience is good. Two of us went for the buffet, 3 went for alacarte. I took the honey roasted pork which was amazing, I highly recommend. The buffet food was also good and in desert the choice was many.

I went to this place not very expectantly wrt food (being vegetarian), but was pleasantly surprised. We decided to go a la carte instead of for the buffet. Service as well as food quality was excellent. Starters, main course as well as desserts. The breads could be slightly better. Must mention very warm service provided by Pralay from Howrah - with a smile.

Expect yr order to be served fast unlike usual five star hotels.

Hope you maintain the service and food quality

Been here with the expectation of availing the introductory buffet, which had not yet started as I came to know upon arrival. Moreover strangely, my child of 10 yrs was charged as an adult. Not at all any good memories to carry with as few staffs and mostly self help was needed

What I like about Social Kitchen is the nice range of food available in their buffet section. On my recent visit, really liked their range of salads and starters - but the green pea cappuccino was a favourite of mine. The buffet is reasonably priced and has a selection of meat, fish and prawns. On the day of my visit, they had lamingtons for dessert and a stuffed paneer kabab which was stellar, and the tandoori chicken had my group wanting more!

when we entered into the social kitchen it really looked good . the interior is designed professionally. so we ordered omelette as i was craving for something simple in egg,chicken satay and spring roll. their kitchen is a open kitchen and i only saw one chef cooking and making our drinks as well. there were two more group of people who ordered at the same time and one chef was doing all the cooking. so you can expect the delay in delivering the food. we were almost fed up with the delay and then our food came. so the chicken satay was really good. spring roll could be improved and omelette was okay. so overall the experience was not so bad except we had to wait for a long time.

One of the most spendid buffet layouts you'll get anywhere in or around Kolkata. 
The presentation of food is so good that you'll be tempted to taste each and every dish served there. 
The staff is very well behaved and helpful. Service was superb and were served with unlimited mocktails throughout our dining. 
Overall, a nice experience.

A very nice hospitality. The staff was quite polite and very quick in service.
We had gone there for a Lunch buffet. The buffet was a variety of north India, partly Chinese food and a small portion of continental as well. The salads were amazing and tasted so fresh. We had tried Kolkata chicken biryani, mutton roganjosh, Kadhai paneer and pickles to accompany. In Chinese we had vegetables in Garlic sauce with noodles which was tasty. The pizza was done live and was really great taste.
For dessert we had Gulab jamun, mud pastry which was delicious but the most amazing was the mocha pastry.
Overall it was a great experience and would like to visit here again. I would sum up as:
Music: 4/5
Food: 5/5
Value for money: 4/5
Ambience: 4/5
Service: 4.5/5

Starters were coming very late even after requesting for so many times. And the supervisor who was monitoring our table, indicating not to give us that much of starters. The variation of starters were very less. There were only one fish item, two veg items and only one chicken item as starters. The Main Course was okay. They had Biriani (the potato in there was way too salty), chapati or nun on request, two fish items, one chicken and one mutton item. As we didn't go for the veg items, so can't tell about them. Now about the dessert part, it was just awesome. They had 6/7 types of cake, along with various shots, Misti Doi, Sandesh, Chocolate Mousse. Overall I would not recommend this place with this budget.

Heard about the buffet so tried their "Introductory Buffet Offer with unlimited mock tails". Totally. We started with mutton soup and chicken pizza which was a disaster. Pizza is actually Pizza Sauce spread over Tortilla with some shredded chickens. They served the chicken and fish starter. They are okay. But when we ordered for more, they came with only 2 pieces. Until then we did not get the mock tails. After repetitive¬† asking we get the drinks with only one glass of litchi juices. 

Next came the main courses. The mutton was so hard that we can't eat a single piece. Only items that we had was prawns and paneer.¬† Rest all items are below average. I don't recommend anyone to go here.

Social Kitchen, is a fine dining resturant within Holiday Inn, one of the famous hotel chains of the world. They serve buffets as well as ala carte. I opted for the buffet option and the experience was " waow". They have an Indo-Chinese Combination spread out with Salads and some real good desserts. Fish (Vetki), Chicken, Mutton (goat meat), Prawn comprise the non veg options along with a vatiety of veg options. What I missed was the starters which is usual in most buffets in the town. And I believe they will take care of this deficiency.  Ambience, Corteus Staff, Hospitality resembled the experience of a world famous hotel chain. Pocket Pinch is around Rs. 875/- ( u can save by getting discounts in b2b partners nearbuy and little app). Hope to visit again.

Heard much about the buffet at Social Kitchen so we ramped up our taste buds and went for the culinary extravaganza on offer during lunch. There were no starters, so we started with chicken tom yum soup and chicken pizza. Tom yum soup had the right balance of hot and sour taste with oriental flavors dominated by lemongrass. Chunks of chicken and mushroom adorned the bowl. Chicken pizza was baked using a super thin crust and was just like succulent pieces of chicken on crunchy flakes.

The salad counter had both plated salads as well as options enough for one to make a salad of one‚Äôs choice‚Ä¶

Moving on to main course, we tasted the chicken biryani which was aromatic and done in Kolkata style with ‚Äòaloo‚Äô and ‚Äòanda‚Äô thrown in. Regular stuff‚Ä¶ Other non-veg mains were mutton curry ‚Äì well-cooked soft juicy mutton pieces in a rich red spicy gravy, good to have with steamed rice or parathas;

Gambas pil pil ‚Äì usually a Spanish delicacy of prawns served in a hot, sizzling sauce of garlic, chilli & olive oil. I cannot actually say it was hot and sizzling and I did find it a little bland.

Pescado ala romana ‚Äì crumb-fried fillet of fish served with spicy bell pepper sauce and cherry tomato ‚Äì good, but the fish fillet lost their tenderness and juice, they were brittle ‚Äì I wish they were more succulent

Chicken in hunan sauce ‚Äì the best! Luscious Sliced chicken in mildly spicy, perfectly seasoned hunan sauce ‚Ä¶heavenly.

Did not have the appetite or inclination to try out the Indian veg dishes on offer‚Ä¶.

On request, I was served some garlic bread instead of the usual naan, etc.

This particular buffet is famous for its dessert section and the variety on offer was quite good in terms of quantity and quality ‚Ä¶ Malpua, sandesh, blue berry gateau, panacotta, mang cheesecake, chocolate mousse, caramel pudding‚Ä¶sinful to say the least. Sadly, the honey glazed nuts were absent‚Ä¶BUT, the lady-in-charge was very very accommodative and kind to arrange for a serving on my request and kudos for this gesture.

I rounded off the hearty meal with a honey-lemon green tea‚Ä¶perfect finale!

The buffet experience has made me curious enough to try out the a la carte options sometime in near future

The city if joy has welcomed another international property a few months back; we now have Holiday Inn Kolkata at New town adjacent to City centre 2. I was there last month for a blogger‚Äôs table with a bunch of friends. The visit was a bit special to me; it was for the first time after my hospitalization and the weird facial problem I left home for a social gathering and it went just perfect. I was giving a second thought to the meet as the weird facial problem that I am presently dealing with is not left me with a smile on my face till now and at that time it was worse. However, after getting a few calls from the fellow bloggers I decided to give the meet a chance. ¬†Surprisingly after being there for an hour, I forgot that I was looking weird with no smile¬†but when you have good company accompanied with good food you feel good and that is what happened to me.¬†My friends had always been fun and¬†but the food and the ambience at Social Kitchen by Holiday Inn Kolkata obviously played the role of positive catalyst I somehow forgot the memories of the hospital! Being the happy go, lucky group, we are, we have sampled both the Buffet spread and selected items from the ala carte over there and now that I have to write about the vast spread I actually am confused from where to start and how to end! Errr the food spread was that vast and delicious!

Is it really a 5 star? The sofas at the entrance were very dirty. Black patches everywhere. Since first impression is the last impression, so this was our first impression about holiday Inn. Here comes the food part. Well they only have two non-veg starter and two veg starter. So we apparently have no choices over starters. But yes the pizza were really good. Staffs were courteous too. But the food tastes really poor. They don't even serve the starters with any chutney. Now the main course. Again very few options available in buffet dinner and that tastes very flat. Sorry to be harsh, but we made better biriyanis at home than they offered. Last but not the least they don't even serve any ice cream. They tried to make it happen, but its not upto the mark specially if it's supposed to provide five star experience.

The name Holiday Inn holds a special place in my heart and one that I associate with very precious childhood memories. I was nine years old when I went with my parents to Bombay for the first time and we stayed at The Holiday Inn hotel in Juhu. It was my first five star hotel experience and I remember how excited I was. I would spent most of my time in the bookshop, the pool and once I figured out that the hotel was a favorite haunt of film stars, I would sit in the lobby for hours hoping to catch a glimpse of them. The Holiday Inn was also where I had my first five star buffet meal and since I‚Äôve always been a foodie (yes, even at 9 years), the huge spread, especially the cakes, pastries and ice-creams were a source of much delight.
                                                                ...

We went for lunch buffet. Better if you reserve the table before hand. The food spread is not that much but the food was real tasty and good. The mocktail was limited but overall I would like to recommend the place.

We went there today to celebrate poila baishakh , but the lunch buffet didn't meet our expectation . Firstly, they were under prepared for the day .Secondly , many Bengali side dishes were served but plain rice was not there which was very disappointing. Thirdly , out of the many starters which were mentioned in the menu only chingri cutlet (which was good) , mochar chop and paneer were served . Moreover, even after asking thrice for topshe fry it was not served, though it was getting served in other tables. Fourthly, many bread options were mentioned in the menu ,we couldn't find any. Lastly, food quality was mediocre.
Only portions which we liked are salad and desert (which had many Bengali sweets).

The new addition to the upcoming urban Viesta of the city.....Rajarhat Newtown...Location is prime easy to track.....The building structure is unique.
               And once you step out of their car you can feel their warmth and ecstasy....Visited on Poila Baisakh to get a taste of their buffet......On booking I was informed that the social kitchen was sold out and that instead I would be accommodated in Urbana which will also serve the same buffet.....
Now buffet dishes was quite big to spell all...But the starters were served by them were awesome....Specially the Topshe fry and the chicken roast.....The pulao was average but the malai kofta,chana dish was delectable.....The crab in garam masala was yummy to taste....Chicken was good but mutton was mouth watering...You could actually bite the bones so tender was it.....Biriyani was good but could have been better....There were Papri chat dahi vada papad to give you a North Indian taste...
          Now for the desert part there was carrot cake Fresh Fruit Cream Cake Chocolate Cake and traditional Bengali sweets like Chomchom,Kheer Dahi,Sandesh and to add to it Ice cream of your choice.....
 One thing I am assured of that this hotel is surely going to be a favourite of many....Be it's food quality or it's service..... Happy to discover a good hotel around my Area Finally
P.S.-Do taste their Fish Patishapta,Moong Dal,Echor Rosa....Fish Patisapta is unique and I am sure the Fish haters will surely love it including the fish lovers

Went their today... they were under prepared for this day it seemed to me firstly....but somehow they managed well...it is a five star hotel...but the place is small and not like the other big giants around....but somehow they have decorated the place very well and their behavior is very good...it was a poila boisakh occasion.. So the buffet was themed on Bengali food....first of all the dinning place is very nice...just like in the five stars...

Now coming to food they served us soup and starters on the table, and a welcome drink...among the starters the topshe fry and the prawn cutlet was very good...

In main course there were many items...veg non veg both,they had crab ,mutton,chicken ,prawn, chicken biriyani...all the items were good...the veg items which I liked were dhoka,paneer, ichor etc...

In chat section there were also many options like fuchka,ghugni,dahi vada etc etc....chat section has variety but lacks well organization ..the organization which we saw in Tamara...

Deserts have many variety..today many Bengali sweets were present along side pastries and choco solids,cakes and other tasty items.At last they served us ice creams.. It was a nice experience...Tanushree Chakraborty

Went  there  on  the  occasion  of  Poila Boisakh.  Reached  there  at  about  12.30p.m. We  had  our  booking.  They  weren't prepared  so  we  waited there.  They  served  soup  on  table..  Then they  served  starters  on  table . As  today  is  a special  day (poila  boisakh)  Bengali foods were all over  in  the  menu.  Starter  options  were  like  Chingri  chap,   Topse  fry, Mochar  chop,  Paneer  etc..  Starter-items  were  very  tasty  specially  the  chingri  item. so many  salad  options were  available  along with  Ghugni,  Fuchka, Dahi  bada etc.. 
In  main  course there  were  huge  variety. Most  of  them  were  Bengali  foods  like  pulao,  ichorer  rossa,   daal,  sukto,  postor  bora  and  many  more.  In  veg  section  there  was  an  item  made  of  Chhana  which  was  fabulous. In  non veg  section biriyani, chicken, prawn,  mutton, crab  everything  was  there.  
In  desert  there  were  approx 20 items  or  even more.
So  it  was  a  nice  experience.  
Bill  for  2 was  approx  Rs.  2750

After a long time, this post will be not on the food or the service of the new kid in town (basically a global giant tking its first baby steps in our city of joy), but on the homecoming for me. First things first, Holiday Inn has opened their first luxury hotel in Kolkata and we were invited for one of their menu sampling session in their coffee shop, The Socio Kitchen. In all these posh five star properties, the service from the very entrance of the hotel is generally top-notch and leaves no area to complain and so was the case here.¬†

But, once we were settling in, I heard a familiar voice. ‚ÄúHey dude, remember me ?‚Äù Now, let me be honest, I couldn‚Äôt place him immediately. I could recognice the face, the voice (off course age has taken its troll), but just couldn‚Äôt recognize the name. The blank look was probably there on my face for a slightly longer time, and the suave chef once again called me‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúYou bugger, remember your first job ? ‚Äú And a floodgate of memories came pouring in. He was Suman (executive chef for Holiday Inn Kolkata now) , but was a fresher just like me joining ont of the hottest properties in Kolkata those days, along with me. We both were working in the kitchen- myself in Indian kitchen and he, in the coffee shop. Now, years have passed by, I‚Äôve shifted to pure IT business in due course of time but he had stayed there, learnt a hell lot and today, leading one of the hottest properties in town. Anyway, it was nothing short of a reunion time for me and he casually asked me, ‚Äúforget about the menu dude, let me surprise you‚Äù and who was I lesser mortal to deny that offer ?

After that, the first dish came, which literally was the best dish of the whole meal. It was the Green Tea Cappuccino. As strange as it may sound, the result was simply jaw-dropping. The green tea was dominating but the cappuccino froth was there and paired with an occasional bite of the garlic bread slice, it was pure heaven. 

The second dish was feta on Tomato rings and it was okay-ish. But, the next dish, the Murgh Malai Tikka was another surprise. We all are used to this dish and it‚Äôs a very standard fare in any of our Indian restaurant visitgs. But, what differentiated this was the softness of the meat. Taste was good no doubt, but the meat was done with such precision that it was just melting in my mouth. So, was the next Kebab. The paneer wrapped dry fruits (I forgot the name, sorry. It looked divine and so was the taste. Hara-Bhara Kebab was next and in my humble opinion, veg food lovers would love that. The Tandoori Chicken was soft again and finely balanced with spice. 

Deep fried Calamari rings was next and frankly, it can‚Äôt go wrong. The subtly spiced batter complemented the chewy calamari meat and the result was heaven. I was missing my beer. But hell, it was a working day lunch for me. 

After all of these, we were kinda stuffed and as per the instruction of the chef, I had to go to the buffet. The highlight of the buffet was the dessert counter. The honey glazed nuts was the new thing which I found that and a spoonful of it was there on my plate. And the usual fare of mousse and puddings- only a much larger spread than the regular ones. And, then there was something which is very very rare to find in the city- Lamington. Lamington is an Australian dessert. Basically, it‚Äôs dices of sponge cake, rolled in fruity sauce (or chocolate off course) and sprinkled generously with desiccated coconut. It was the firangi version of our very own Sandesh. These guys made it and needless to say, it was a hit. 

Now, honestly, I couldn‚Äôt go beyond the dessert and some lovely chicken-asparagus soup in the very beginning and was full with the surprises of Chef Suman. The buffet priced at 800/- (All inclusive) for lunch and 900/- (All inclusive) for dinner is quite a steal for the spread that was on offer, is what I felt. 

Will I come back again ? Hell yeah. I need to taste the full buffet again. 

Bon apetit !!!

This place is best for its location and internal decor. Staffs are very cooperative and well behaved. Loved the salads here, they have a wide range in salads. Main course is a must try. But was a bit disappointed with not having any starters in the lunch buffet. Pizzas and pastas are not the best. But they have a very good start.

Visited Social Kitchen for a blissful dinner with my family and was extremely satisfied. The decor is cool and comfy and the stuffs are cordial. We started with non veg starter and moved on to the main course, salivating for more. But the platter that simply wowed  me was the choicest selection of desserts ! The mango cheese cake became my instant favourite! 
This place is a must try, friends...I am sure you all will live it.

The food is delicious , with fresh juices , cold Drinks and pizzas and pastas .... a wonderful way to spend your Sunday afternoon . Great place for families .

When you love to go to a good restaurant for a lunch,social kitchen newly open should be one of your choices. (Only mentioning it for the people in Kolkata)

Food: Coming to the food section, it had a section of continental and Indian cuisines. They had a buffet too with all the corporates and residents of the hotels approaching the same. 
Service : As it is very new in town the servers are too young and are very confident with great customer service. Special mention to Amit who waited for us .

The Social Kitchen have a delicate touch to being clean, spacious and in proper condition to prepare all meals. The Dinning Cafe has been created to imbed its features in your memory. It's much more than simply exceptional, it's Majestic. The hotel is almost a lap away from Kolkata airport - a hop, skip and a jump. I certainly applaud it, recommend it, and guarantee full satisfaction.

I decided to take a day off and checked in at Holiday Inn Kolkata Airport on a Sunday with the simple plan of sleeping, relaxing and eating. I had already interacted with the f&b team during their opening parties and other events but this time I wanted to try out the khana peena as a room guest as well as a walk in.
The meals included in my stay plan were breakfast, lunch and dinner at Social Kitchen, their round the clock diner.
The first thing that attracted me was the warm service and classy decor with each cutlery and table linen placed impeccably. They have a spacious live kitchen that churns out delicacies like pizza, Indian flat breads, pasta, oriental stir fries, kebabs, waffles, dosa, pancakes, eggs to order, salads among other dishes.
For dinner I settled for Khao Sway, a Burmese soup preparation, a variety of non veg, seafood and veg salads, hummus and mini pita, homestyle dal and rice and a skewered stuffed fish preparation with saut√©ed vegetables . And yes, I just couldn't resist the char grilled tiger prawns in mustard sauce, it was simply amazing. To add, they did serve a variety of starters like tandoori aloo, schezwan chicken, fish fritters etc. The entire fare was light, non greasy and served in moderate portions to maintain quality,taste and aroma. Starting from Indian veg and non veg dishes to fusion and global cuisine, they had it all. The pocket pinch for dinner all inclusive was just INR 999 and kids eat free.
Breakfast was delightful with an array of fresh bakery like cupcakes, muffins, Danish, croissants and bread, assorted cheese, dips, preserves, fresh fruits apart from the active live kitchen rustling up dosa, waffles, omelets, pancakes etc, a vast spread of Indian and continental dishes, cold cuts, juices and tea/coffee. I had fresh watermelon juice, figs, prunes, apricots, fresh cut fruits, roast almonds and cashews in honey and a cup of cappuccino.
I got hungry way too quick and descended upon the lunch buffet like a raven. There were at least 10-12 types each of salads and desserts, Lebanese fare, chaat counter, soups, biryani, pasta, curries, oven fresh pizza, several oriental and continental delicacies all for INR 899 all inclusive. I enjoyed coriander chicken clear soup, seafood and chicken salads, Kolkata style biryani, succulent mutton curry and their irresistible desserts.
I can't wait to enjoy their bakery, bar and poolside once they're open. It's a brand new hotel with a boutique feel and I just can't wait to visit with friends and family again. 
My favorite dishes - Calamari salad with strawberry and kiwi, prawn cocktail, char grilled Tiger prawns, home style lehsuni yellow dal, Bengal gur souffle sandesh shots and pizza.

The newest fine dining option in the New Town, Rajarhat area. One of the biggest international brands ¬†in hospitality industry joins the league at Kolkata.¬†
Huge variety of cuisine within less than 1K per head. One will find fish, chicken, mutton and prawn in the buffet spread. Excellent dessert options along exquisite salads. Ala carte spread is equally having good number of varieties.¬†
Service was prompt and staffs were courteous. Valet parking available. Highly recommend for family crowd and business travelers stopovers.

Penne Pasta In Mixed Sauce ‚ò∫

Holiday Inn is the recent most addition to the list of five star hotels in Kolkata. Social Kitchen is their casual dining restaurant that serves North Indian, Asian and European Cuisines.

This weekend, one of their residing guests sent us a parcel of their Penne Pasta In Mixed Sauce.

The neatly packed and vegetable rich pasta came with two medium sized bread buns and two sachets of butter.

Penne inside the dish were of relatively bigger size (slightly). Vegetables comprised of broccoli, zucchini and mushrooms. The vegetables were fresh and retained the right crunch post cooking. Sauces and seasonings were well balanced.

The accompanying buns were kind of oval in shape and infused with sliced onions and topped with a couple of grilled cheese spots. They were different from the usual buns, but tasted nice. 

In fact, they were a welcome change from the usual garlic breads that you tend to receive with such parcels, as those toasted garlic breads, with or without cheese, turn little soggy by the time you actually sit down to eat!

Overall, the dish tasted good.

The quantity received was more than sufficient for one person. Two such parcels would have sufficed three persons.

Menu Price: Rs. 600/-

Casual dining is not a new concept in Kolkata but what's new are the establishment of the new brands of hotel chains and restaurants which have already crowned the fame at the Kolkata‚Äôs gastronomic community. The Social Kitchen at Holiday Inn Kolkata Airport, Rajarhat New Town is one more jewel in the crown.¬†

The other day I had the opportunity to take my better half for one such evening dinner. The ambiance of the place is pretty cozy and the people are warm and very helpful, the help that I needed to order for some of the best food that we have tasted in a while. I settled for the Australian Lamb Chops which was served with asparagus had a hint of rosemary that really brought up the flavor of the tender lamb chops and my better half ordered the Norwegian Smoked Salmon which was served with the light tangy citrus salad, the salmon was soft and succulent had a delicate smoky aroma, sweet flavor with amazingly silky texture that was better summed up as ‚Äúreally mouth watering‚Äù.¬†

I am happy to have found the casual dining place the has such high standards of food where quality is not compromised and foodie type Kolkatans like myself can indulge in more guilty pleasures.

Nice and compact place.. courteous staff.. had the lunch buffet.. the spread was good.. not very elaborate but sufficient enough.. good value for money proposition. Extra special if you go with kids.. as they get toys and activity sheets to keep themselves busy. As far as the buffet was concerned.. starters, salads and desserts were very good. Main course could have been better.

We Tried the buffet .. Great starters ... big spread . Very polite and caring staff they really gave us a 5 star treatment ... but the main course left me and my wife just a bit disappointed as it lacked both parity and flavours in some cases. But a roasted mutton and chicken off the grill was one of the best I have had in my life. And the prawns were as fresh and tender as they could get. The desert spread was massive but had too much strawberries all over... (may be that was the valentines special on the desert front)

I went to celebrate my parents pre anniversary and they were fantastic I'm their service. The ambience of the place is very good. Staff is courteous and warm. The food is very good to taste. The buffet spread is very good considering the price they are charging and the prawns were extremely soft and fresh. They had a wide range of desserts as well. On the whole a good experience.
