If you want to have good kachori, samosa, sweets and South Indian food then here ends your search. Kachori sabji deserves a special mention as they stand out and I love that from this place!

This place is running for past 25 years till the time I remember atleast. I can still drive 10 kms to have Kachori Sabzi of this place in the morning which is excellent. Kanpuri laddu is a favourite and best seller. They have also started serving South Indian and snacks from recent years.

Tasting it from childhood and trust me they still delivered us the same taste and same brilliant quality. Their rash malai is my favorite because it contain lots of malai and keshar.

A well named sweet shop or dessert parlour. Sweets may not appear to be quiet appealing but they do taste really good. The rasmalai is yellow cause of the kesar content and is one of my favourite. Moreover I like the kacha golla , maka sondesh etc.

Located near girish park, Nepal chandra has been a known name since lots of years for the various dahi chaats, kachori sabzi and sweets items. They have expanded their menu over the years and 1 thing which which is a given about all its offerings is great quality, fresh food, big servings at very pocket friendly prices. My biggest grudge being no seating area and one has to stand and eat.

Coming to the chaats, raj kackori chaat and dahi vada are pretty good. Kachori sabzi is always served piping hot and is lovely. South indian food has also been added to its menu and is average, not so much worth it. Other snacky items like the puffs, samosa, cutlets are all decent in my opinion. Sweets are well made and old, stale stuff is never sold at the shop. My favorite being the gulab jamun, gulab sandesh. 

Overall the place undoubtedly gives you the money's worth !!

this place serves some awesome sweets and snacks located in the girish park area..its mainly a sweet shop yet they sell south indian dishes and other snacks...
i have tried their dahi vada,jalebi and kachori with badam halua..which was just great...i did not expect the snacks to be so good..my father tried some sweets like rose sandesh and barfis which were very tasty and better than other places we have been..dahi vada i really liked..they sell dosa as well...special mention to their kachuri and tarkari which is just mind blowing..u just cant beat it..
staff were quick to serve and were cordial to the customers..i will be going back there if for nothing but kachori..:)

There is something about the club kachori at Nepal which  keeps taking me back to this place whenever I am in Kolkatta. Not sure if its the kachori or the aloo  ki subji which is very subtle and not spicy like the majority on offer.Whatever it is the taste has been always the same till date and that is -Delicious. Apart from kachori it also serves sweets and I believe south indian stuff.(haven't tried it though)
Definetely worth a bite if you are in girish park/ burra bazaar area. No seating is available though when I last visited..
