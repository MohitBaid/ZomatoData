Ordered a full chicken roast.. It was really pungent.. overloaded with chili.. Delivery man took extra 10 rupees...¬†
I ordered same dish a few days ago then it was really tasty.. The Restaurant admin should take care about their cooking..
Delivery was on time.. But for the irritating taste of the food and delivery boy's strange behavior it was the worst food ordering experience..
They don't even have consistency in their food's taste..

Tried Chinese only once, but I must mention that the Tandoori items are really excellent. Most of the Kababs are mouth watering. The size of the pieces of Chicken tandoori are overwhelming.
But you are wiser to take your food away. The sitting arrangement is very suffocating as it is  without air conditioning.

It is situated near Baranagar Station. It is a non-ac restaurant. The behavior of the staffs are good and the servicing were also fast. The quantity of the food is also good. But the plates were not washed properly. We ordered 2 rumali roti and 2 tandoori roti and chilli chicken. Chilli chicken was ok, not so bad not good. But the tandoori roti was too hard to tear. Moreover rumali roti was not so perfect but still it was eatable. 1 point for the staff behavior, 2nd point for their fast servicing and another for the quantity of food. Price was still affordable.

I like their biriyani and chicken butter tikka masala... This combo is enchanting for me. They offer Indian, Chinese and other variety of dishes and has a fast food stall as well. They are also good in starters. The cost is also reasonable. I would suggest everyone to visit this place if you guys want some good food.

This joint is located beside dhaka restaurant in dunlop..the ambience is really nothing to speak of..low ceilings make u bend your shoulder to get a seat but the food makes up for it somewhat..we ordered tandoori chicken and followed up bt mutton biryani..i must say that both the dishes were delicious and this place serves the best biryani in the dunlop area..the quantity is ample to serve two people and u cant complain..only if the ambience and decor were better it would have lived up to its reputation and deserve a better rating..

But the kabab section is quite good. They taste well with the pudina chutney they provide. Its a low rating from my side.

I have had only biriyani from this place,which is a tad bit cheaper than the Dhaka Biriyani House.

The first time I tasted the biriyani it seemed fine.

The second time I did,I felt it was too hot as in chilli kind of hot.

I am not going to this place soon enough.

Just beside the B.T Raoad near Dunlop Crossing with all the pollution and dust pouring in. Pretty popular for biriyani. Give a tough competition to Dhaka Biriyani House just beside it. Other items are so so. Ambiance, of course needs a hell lot of improvements. Its pretty much like a take away stall with quick snacks and dinner for locals. Chinese are OK types. North Indian items like paneer butter masala, chicken bharta, naan are a complete NO NO. Pakoras and Kebabs are again OK types. Can be tried if other nearby options are closed.

If you re out of food and live in this area or nearby this is perhaps the only restaurant that can save you from sleeping without food in your tummy at night. Food quality is average,service is not the best,slightly over priced, space is very small and suffocating. Its not a restaurant I would recommend to anyone.

I would not visit this place again. Service is very poor. Food is not upto the mark. Should improve its food quality. Price is just too high im comparison to the quality of the food.

I have been there a few times. But have to admit that this is not a good eat out by any standard. Terrible ambience, below average food, very average service, Hygiene nothing to talk about and price was okay. I will not recommend this restaurant if you have a choice. There are plenty of restaurants in the area.

I've had mutton biriyan and tandoori chicken several times here. Must say the biriyani is awesome specifically the Mutton piece if u give them a preference just like I give, then I assure u u'll get what you demand. The chicken tandoori has got some really large pieces of chicken although it has a certain type of spice which gives it a not so good aroma and taste.

The nearest place to my home to have spicy kebabs. The place is too clumsy  and like hot boiler to sit for a chat. Though they have a small ac portion behind, foodies hardly go there. Apart from kebabs and biryani, a special tadka is taste worthy with roti or parata!

To be consise only thing which amuses me is that how can such a small hotel provide huge number of dishes and also maintain both quality and quantity... But only downside is the very small height of the roof... Any average size person could not enter the hotel without bending their heads which is a bit too uncomfortable... However its good for dine out... Mutton dishes are its specialty along with biriyani..

I have been here since the time there was no internet. I have been in this place since the early 90's with my mom grandpa and grandma. This place serves the best food out here in Baranagar. This place makes me remember my childhood days. And my childhood tastes. One of my all times favourite from here are panner tadka , kasmiri sludam and lacha paratha. I hoping to visit this place ASAP.....period!!!!!!!

Tucked away in one side of a busy Dunlop more, out of the normal vision area by numerous sign boards and humbled by the mighty surrounding of much more well-known places, this is a place only to be reckoned by those crazy people who can go anywhere for taste and flavor.

The first time I saw this place I immediately put it in my "Never visit again unless absolutely hungry" list. Very congested seating arrangement; average, if not below, eating condition. But since we were to have take outs, I didn't mind.

The first surprise to me was the Biriyani Handi kept outside for public display, which is very normal in Kolkata. Even just smelling that, one can say that they can easily compete with the big names. Unfortunately, we already placed our order of Tandoori Roti and Egg Tadka before I could take in that aroma so I could not taste it.

As I already mentioned, we opted for take out. So we took the parcel when it was ready, came home, freshen up and sat to eat. And the second surprise revealed itself. After almost half an hour of getting prepared and packed, the Tandoori Rotis were soft and not crunchy, something even the big restaurants can not manage to do always. Imagine what they would have been when served fresh out of the oven in the restaurant.

The Egg Tadka, on the other hand, was pretty good too. It was well cooked but not too much, not full of gravy, balanced spices- Just what we expect in an Egg Tadka. Frankly speaking, this quality of Tadka is also a bit rare in Kolkata. And if we consider the price range they are offering- VERY RARE.

Of course we had no experience about the service inside. But seeing the pace those people were moving at and judging by the hospitality shown to us, I safely assume it would be satisfactory, if not good.

Take outs are rarely considered to be a good foundation for a review. Even I believe so myself. But this was an experience I had to give them credit for. I would happily give them a 4 rating but the poor seating condition had to be accounted for. Needless to say, I shall be back for that biriyani soon.

It is an old place i guess in this area which made me curious to try it and it wasn't looking that bad from outside as it was after I got in.
The place inside is all awful and congested ceilings and not really where you would like to sit for even a second after you finish your meal. Their cooking place as well wasn't really satisfying to see.
Also they don't serve purified water and seeing their awful unhygienic condition I had no options but to order a mineral water bottle as I couldn't trust their cleanliness.
Ordered a chicken mughlai and one egg roll. Took them quite a bit of time but that was okay. Roll was decent a normal one.
Mughlai rather was not upto the mark and kinda tasteless. The vegetable (something) they served with it was more awful as the potatoes weren't peeled off properly and was useless. My journey through it was going to be too bad until I decided to introduce chilli sauce which saved my journey through that mughlai. :D 
Not recommended but may try some takeaways.

It's located at the busy Dunlop more aside Dhaka Biryani House. You'd first notice this place because chicken tandoori and kebabs are made just outside the main building. Their Murgh Musallam (costs 270rs as of now) is special... Most dishes taste great. Kinda bang for buck as well. You just gotta opt for parcel/home-delivery 'cause the ambience isn't great.

This is a ordinary,  Clumsy Restaurant. A bit Humid and Noisy restaurant.
 But they are Serving some good tasty food.
Good place to hangout with your hungry buddies. But for me , Most of the times it is a Take home deal.
 I Had some great  Tasty  Chicken Bharta, Chicken Butter Masala, Tarka,  Chicken Tandoori, 
Chicken Reshmi Kabaab and Naan.

The Restaurant may be not that great but while  I was having  those tandoors , the time just breezed.
But Biriyani was not a Good Deal.
As a Conclusion a Good, Low-Budget place for some  Selective foods.

If you are looking for a classy place, then it is not for you. By the way if you are looking for a great roadside hotel, then also it would not score much!

So I won‚Äôt say nah! You could visit the place being a nearby resident. However, the clumsy atmosphere and dingy lighting might not be able to impress you at all! No doubt, this is a good place in the Dunlop as there is a noticeable absence of good quality restaurants.

Biryani is the only dish that you could think about having and I definitely no other delicacies including kebabs as they are not well cooked and chinese dishes. Another important thing is the value for money concept, which helps it scoring.

Before I begin with the review I want you to know that this place is strictly not for tall people, u'll definitely hit the ceiling and you won't be able to stand straight. Food is very good here though it is very spicy, i mean its very spicy. Definitely deserves a visit and pricing is also very good. I had: 
 
1. Rice with Fish Kalia - very nicely done, rice quality is good and the fish kalia gravy will make you crave for more.

2. Tandoori Chicken - very good, nicely done but the green chutney served along is horrible.

3. Chicken Hariyali Kebab - If you ever try kebab here then do try this one, u'll love it. Beautifully covered in the green mixture and juicy. Superb in taste. (Though I think the best kebab i ever had was in Honey-da-Dhaba).

4. Chicken / Mutton Punjabi - very good, quantity of gravy enough to serve two.

I am a frequent visitor here as I stay close to this place. All I can say is that you won't regret visiting here and I recommend visiting this place than going to Dhaka Biriyani House.

Clumsy enviornment but good north indian mainly punjabi food. Please donot try chinese over here. Its horrible. Go for the biriyani and the rolls. Its quite good. Few of the punjabi delicacies might taste a bit sweet. Still its quite food. Hygine is a bit concern. Tables are a bit unclean. So better take it away. Price is within the reach. Overall experience is not bad but nothing to boast about.

Please don't go for the FOOD VILLAGE when you are hungry.

Got the most worthless experience from a restaurant. After giving the order we had to wait for 35 minute. Even when we asked for the reason they replied arrogantly that we can cancel the order they won't mind. We tried to meet the manager but he was busy in something else not even attended after several calls. have tried many restaurants in Kolkata but have received such a bitter experience. Food might be good but the service and hospitality is worst and the persons working there is such arrogant that they don't even know how to talk with the customers.

This is not a standard restaurant, just a stop you'd need if you are too hungry to eat anything and not think about the taste buds. No specialties, no ambiance is entertained. Come, eat, go must be the motto here. Best place to hang out with a couple of friends and have something to chew on.
