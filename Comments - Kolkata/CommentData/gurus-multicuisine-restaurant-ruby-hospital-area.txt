Very good place for having food along with alcohol. Ordered Crispy Chicken and Drums of Heaven along with a few bottles of beer and wasn't disappointed at all with the quality of food.

Extremely simple restaurant. Given an option would not have dined here and never did. Since, office was in Bantala we opted for a delivery.Â 
Had Indian dishes and their behavior was good.

Gurus restaurant is a good place to eat food with reasonable price, it's a highway restaurant near to bypass and I like it's tandoori very much. Chicken biriyani is also very tasty. You should give it a try.

This is very near to my place, and I used to be a regular Customer here. I can't really say much about ambience and service, because I used to order home delivery. The quality of food is average. This place isn't overtly priced either. But recently they have stopped providing home delivery, ever since they've opened a bar.

Nice decor, good location, well behaved stuffs and food was decent. Very clean. You would love the ambiance inside. Good for if you're looking for a soft environment. No issue with parking space, they have huge space in front of the restaurant. Try it if you are near Ruby  to Science City.
