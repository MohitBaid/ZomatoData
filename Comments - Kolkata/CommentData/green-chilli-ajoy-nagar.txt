By zomato comparison, this is a underrated place. I don't really understand why. 
Just go through the menu card. Its obvious a wonderful menu for middle class people of its suburbs. Preparations are good. Neat and clean place. Delivers to bengal ambuja society without any question or problems. 
Dal Tadka, chicken bharta masala, paneer masala, chicken curry etc are some of the wonderful dishes of this small hotel, that too in a much affordable price.
Will certainly add photos next time.

Tiny joint tucked near Ambuja, but food is very tasty and they score high because of their packaging and cleanliness.. Both Chinese and North Indian dishes are yummy, and they deliver without any hassles, very helpful staff..

This place servs pretty good quality food, and how i like it, I am not much of a chinese food fan, but they make chinese very well and you will like it eventually, I mostly use this for takeaway and  neve been dissatisfied with the quality of the quantity. Also their food is not at all oily, have been eating dry chili chicken, chiclen.fried rice, chicken chow and many more item.from the menu.

Green chilli is awesome. I never look into the menu. I just tell them what kind of dish i am looking for. And i have never been disappointed with their food. The taste and quality...both are awesome. If you compare them with some 5star that wont be justice. However, in comparison to other small restaurants, its really good and value for money.

This fast food centre is your rescue when you are feeling up to taste something worth the price and yet good quality food. Since this outlet is five minutes walking distance from my place I practically order everything from them . Be it chicken roll, pakoras, momo, chilli chicken, fried rice, noodles even roti ! The people out here are quite friendly and you will never fall ill after having food from here! 
The best part is one day I got my home delivery with 20min which was simply amazing. I had ordered 2 rice and noodles along with 1 plate of fish and chicken dish. Can you beat that ? and before I knew it we all had cleaned our plates.

Green Chilli won't disappoint you if you know what to order.
They make very decent momos, egg rolls and chicken rolls. Everything else is passable and better to be left alone. They started off with making a nice version of the chili chicken but that is now a thing of the past. You may try the egg fried rice though.
The person taking the order is cordial and the prices are cheap.
So use green chili for your snack cravings but stay off the other items on the menu...

Green Chilli is a roadside food kiosk just opposite to my place. Here people generally place Home Deliveries if sudden unwanted guests appear. It has more or less all type of 'Chalu' foods available & guests won't curse considering they ought to call before crashing in..!!! I am even more surprised to see this outlet in Zomato...
RECOMMENDATION: For this one too...?

The food is quite good but the rate written on the menu script is not correct.
Like Garlic Chow Rs. 75.00 is written on the menu but the actually the price is Rs. 80.00
and Chicken Chow Rs. 65.00 but it is Rs. 70.00
The menu script should be changed so that the customer could know the price because every time we can't ask them the price of the item. Also I like to add that the packaging system is not neat and clean. 
I would like to rate 2.5/5.0 for the food.
