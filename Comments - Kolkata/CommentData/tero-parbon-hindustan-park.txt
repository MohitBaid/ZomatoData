I have eaten at Tero Parbon multiple times over the years. I even ordered in recently for a birthday celebration. My favorites are the hilsa paturi, bhetki bhapa and kacha lonka murgi. I love the hint of mustard in both their paturis and bhapas. The kacha lonka murgi is spicy and tangy and certainly a blessing for people who love "jhaal" food.

I also love their hasher dimer devil. It is filled with egg yolk and mutton keema. This juxtaposition is delightful and this is a must have item on the menu.

The restaurant serves authentic bengali food and is defo recommended highly by me.

Wanted to write about their efficient service for quite some time. It was lunchtime on Saptami this year. Puja rush was getting at its worst. People piling up outside the restaurant, in large groups to get a table. Some were claiming that they know someone associated with the restaurant who was just a phone call away. So they deserve an out of turn preference. Some, with bigger groups were almost threatening that they would go somewhere else if they were not awarded with a table right then. And some were simply grumpy, like me. Because we all were very hungry.
It can make way to any management course, that how well the Tero Parbon staff handled the situation! Everybody was accommodated in due course, were properly fed and made happy! 
Oh, one exception they surely made. For a family with a girl on wheelchair.
And the food was good, as always.

Did not have a good experience about this restaurant. The behaviour of the staffs  were little rude and not so helpful. We tried Bhaat, Fish Fry, Chhanar Kalia, Daab Chingri there. I recommend fish fry and daab chingri as a must-try, chhanar kalia also tasted too good but fish paturi was not good.  Price is moderate. Ambiance is also so so.

I apologise to be late to review this Bong-blended restaurant. Although, it's spacious & provides a small upper deck for their guests, but the service was not good at all. Late service. The bong cuisine included prawn & bekti was so-so. So, didn't enjoy it! Sad to say, it was a just a normal lunch. Hope, they improve.

Good Bengali cuisine with myriad varieties to choose.Dab chingri is one of their signature dishes. The topse fry was fried with thick batter like a beguni, the taste of topse was masked due to that. The Mutton kosha was delectable but a couple of Mutton pieces were chewy. We finished with Misti Doi which was good. At the end of my meal I could not finish the entire plate of Mutton and I requested the restaurant to pack it. I found it extremely stingy and outrageous on the part of Tero Parbon to charge for the container after you have spent 2k on lunch. Never ever witnessed this neither in Kolkata, nor in Mumbai or Delhi which left a sour taste in my mouth. Something for management to ponder"Penny wise and pound foolish"

A sincere feedback
Sunday afternoon went to Tero Parbon to have lunch....
Order was Daber Jol, Aam Panna, Fish fry, Dal, bhat, Jhurjhure Alu bhaja, Dab Chingri... bill Amount Rs 1210.
Coming to the experience :
Had to wait for abour 25 mins to get Deber Jol & Aam Panna after I almost scolded the waiter to keep us waiting for 25 mins for starters
After another 15 mins, then came the fish fry - this is the 1st time, i have seen Alur pur mixed with fish and termed as a fish fry...
After another 20 -25 mins came the main course.
Dab Chingri - came as a white gravy and its so sweet that I feel like having sugar syrup.... and Imagine I had to take the shit with rice... aahhhh... what a taste...
coming to the quantity, they serve the same as saptapadi... and their charge is okay compared to their quantity... somehow, I found Tero Parbon was over prices in terms to their Quantity.... Quality.. I can give a Zero...
This was about the food part.....
Now coming to the administration & management part
When I started giving the order, the person who was taking the order 1st asked me whether I am ready with the menu or not.. as if he is damn busy....
The person who served was sometime very busy with making the bill and collecting cash from the customer...
I was actually confused who was the manager ??

Yesterday (15th,Oct) we visited this restaurant and my experience is very pathetic. It's an old restaurant in Purna Das Road, known for Bengali food, so we visited this. We had ordered several veg and non-veg item out of which the Veg preparations are li'l better.
Here comes our ordered menu and the review per item:
Lunch- It was not puffy at all.
Radhaballavi- It was good
Cholar Dal and Fulkipor Torkari: Both were good
Rice- No basmati rice they gave Atop Chap of bad quality.
Khichudi with Aloo Bhaja - Too bad, as saffron was used in it which is absolutely pathetic and was too sweet and inedible. 
Shorshe Elish- So so, nothing extraordinary, we had  much better  Elish Shorshe in Bhojohari Manna and Saptapadi as well.
Gondhoraj Chicken- No flavour of gondhoraj lebu at all and the chicken pieces were too small, bony and stiff.
Kosha Murgi- Too bad, the curry was burnt , 4 chicken pieces were small, hard and bony totally inedible.
Bhetki Paturi -OMG! It was worst of the lot. The mustard was bitter, no taste of the fish and we were about to vomit after eating.
Fish Fry- Firstly we didn't order it, as the Paturi was just yuck, we had asked the manager to replace with Fish Fry. It was another bad experience. I had never had such bad fish fry no even in road side stall. The batter of the fry was too thick, the slice of fish was small and the stuffing inside was worst, God knows what it had. It seems a big piece but the taste is too bad.  
Khejur Amsotto Chutney and papad- Chutney was so so and the papad may be was many months old, too oily and bad
Nolen Gurer Icecrceam - So So
The quality of the food, service is too bad. Serving time after an order is placed is too long. The Manager is a dumb person, there's no point in complaining about the food, he tries to make u believe what he thinks. As we had visited many other Bengali Restaurants in Kolkata so we could easily make out the difference. Totally wastage of time and money. 
NOT RECOMMENDED...

Decent place. Decor and ambience is good and food is mostly good. We ordered dab shorbot, bhaja mug dal, plain rice, topse bhaja, mourola ghonto, Malai chingdi, pomfret bhaja, chitol peti, rabdi, nolen gur ice cream. Most of the dishes served were good. However, dab shorbot was absolutely horrible. Tasted like someone added garlic essence in a glass of tender coconut water. Pomfret fry was a disaster, tasteless, bland, bad bad bad. Feedback given to the manager. Expected him to at least offer a replacement but he didn't really bother. My mother was hugely disappointed with the pomfret.

We ordered fish paturi which comprises of betki fish but it was bad in taste. 
And most importantly  the behaviour  of the staffs and manager was too rude. 
It seemed like we ordered the food for free. 
Will never visit the place again for sure.

A visit to Kolkata always includes restaurant hopping for someone like me who has been staying of the city for years now. In that spirit one lunch, we ended up here and was pleasantly surprised. They had a regular menu and a menu with a twist, we went for the later and ended up relishing everything that we tasted. The aam panna as a starter drink was very refreshing and then on all the dishes was awesome. 
The ambience is quirky and some interesting pieces of pieces used as art. And if one is an Uttam Kumar fan then you will enjoy looking around for sure. 

Would certainly recommend friends to visit this place and enjoy the food.

I went here yesterday with my dad for a dinner.
There was quite a rush during the puja time.
The ambience is beautiful with nice homely vibes.
Since pulao was unavailable we settled with normal bhaath.
We took sona moong dal,jhuri aloo bhaja,Chhanar kalia,Daab chingri,Lonka bata murgi bhapa,Aam panna and Rabri.
All the veg items were nice especially the chhanar kalia tasted great and would be better if it was a bit less fried.
The Daab chingri was nice but had less salt in it.
The Lonka bata bhapa murgi is highly recommended.It is spicy in coriander curry and tasted amazing.
Aam panna was refreshing.
Dessert section has less options.Rabri is rupees 180 and tasted nice but is obviously overpriced.
Also we took one rui kalia for parcel which tasted bad.

Overall,the food quality and qyantity is good but some of the items are overpriced.
Service is a bit slow here.
Ambience is pretty good with soothing lights.
Staffs are courteous.

Visited this place to taste Bengali cuisines and it was an OK experience. Food quality and taste was moderate. We have ordered several Bengali cuisines like dum pulao, mutton curry, luchi, alu-posto, aam-panna, chutney etc. 
But all of these items were over priced. 
Ambience and hospitality was also moderate if not good. 
Needs a lot of improvement on - 'How to manage', things in rush hours. Service personnel needs to be more attentive towards customers.

The place used to be good, it had been recommended by many friends. The restaurant manager provided a lot of wrong choices while taking the order, for example he said Chitol maach had only big bones, kids could have it, it turned out to be a nightmare to finish. The gravy of most of the dishes tasted similar & unauthentic. The only dish that was good was lonka bhapa murgi. It’s best to avoid this restaurant for Bengali food.

The rating is purely because of the food. On a previous visit we had left the restaurant because of the bad behaviour of the staff. So today we decided to see if things changed. 
Décor is okay.Ambience is fine. Staff is one of the worst i've come across. Firstly they keep pestering you to place your order and then it takes almost an hour for each dish to come.Service is slower than a snail.
We had Beguni,Fish Orly,Luchi,cholar dal,bhaat,aloo posto,jhinge posto,chicken kasha,mutton curry,doi pona,chitol machher muitha,chutney.Food was good.The chicken seemed like it came straight out of the refrigerator. The paan at the end was a nice touch.
Visit recommended only for the food.

Located @Purna Das Road, a few mins. walk from Golpark, visited this place one evening with lots of expectations. Only the fish fry and fish manohora tasted good. Rest of the items that i parceled was so blunt in taste. to my dissapointment, the rice of illish polao was dumped with biryani attar and the illish was so dry and tasted okish. The malpua was just awful.

Coming to the prices, compared to quality they were on the higher side. Total waste of money.

Used to visit regularly and enjoy the food here but our past few visits have been pathetic with our experience today being the worst. The aloo posto looked stale and unappetising, chicken kosha was drenched in dalda and the pieces of chicken had no flesh whatsoever. Out of the 6 fish dishes ordered, more than half of them had undercooked fish which looked totally pink and was even red in parts. On informing the manager of the same he went on to argue with us and justify the manner it had been cooked in. One dish had only the skin of the fish and we had to ask for another piece to be served. Even the mango chutney was boiled mango pieces floating in sweetened water.  In any other restaurant we would have gotten the dish replaced with no questions asked, but the attitude of the management here was seriously questionable. Never going to make the mistake of coming back here again!

Horrible experience, went for lunch, served with distasteful Fish chop where the stuffing seemed taken out of the refrigerator. Then we tried Chhanar Kalia, again utterly disappointing, could not even finish the dish, the masoor daal was so thin, it reminded me of hostel food. The hospitality was cold, did not bother to change any of the food which had such bad taste, did not share the Wifi password. Utterly avoidable place, i wonder how this place got good rating. Perfect example of unprofessionally managed restaurant.

I am regular visitor to this place near to Triangular Park . This place is best for family outings and small occasions, decorated like an old "Zamindar " house. It gives a royal feeling. The ambience is one of the best thing that you can get here , the behaviour of the staff and their hospitality is super. 
Now coming to the  food . In one word its superb. Authentic Bengali food served in am exquisite way. 
We generally order the "Bhetki Chingri Monohara " which is basically the prawn puffed in a coating of bhekti fish. Mouth watering and you will be at the top of the world. 
I am specialised in non veg stuff , so I am just going into that. The Prawn Malaikari , Daab Chingri tastes very good. The quality of Ilish fish and the cooking style is superb - one should try the Bhapa Illish and Ilish Posto. I dont like the concept of boneless Ilish. The taste of the ilish gets deteriorated while making it boneless. I am not recommending the boneless items . If you have apetite , then grab some rice with the Ilish Tel ( Oil). 

The Mutton i.e Pathar Jhol and Kasha Mangsho is very good in taste very special . 

Coming to the pickels part , Aamer ( Mango) Chutney and the Khejur Amsatter Chatni is awesome. Please try the Payesh and Rabri , heavenly taste.

A simple yet no nonsense place serving decent food. The fish fry was very good, the fish roll was average. But their signature dish is definitely the Lanka Bhapa Murgi which was mouthwatering to say the least, leaves one craving for more. We also ordered mochar ghonto that easily scores a first division and the kosha mangsho a definite 75%. On the whole a fairly decent experience. Should have served better quality of luchis (fluffier) though.

Staff was very courteous.
Kosha mangsho was fabulous as well.
Luchis weren't puffy so we complained and they immediately replaced it.
Daab chingri was the only dampener.
Desserts won us over with nolen gurer sandesh,mihidana ice cream .

Most of my mark is on the basis of the interior: old building architecture with high ceiling ..large old ceiling fan.. Paintings on the wall..copper utensils decorations..black wooden furniture ..old style lampshades..
Location is just 5 mins waking from Golpark..
We visited for a late afternoon lunch on Saturday only one table was booked ...we ordered bhetki chingri monohara as a starter..bhetki and chingri stuffed..it was too much oily ..and this single item cost 220/- .just too much over priced ..
Then we ordered plain rice , kancha lonka murgi and chitol macher peti..rice quantity was less than others.. chicken was not properly washed before cooking and little bit hard..out of 4 pieces one is full of fat ...the gravy was so oily .. Tasted very normal ..
The fish item was also just too much oily ..and the quality of the fish was also poor ..
Really it was disappointing to choose this restaurant when beside this another Bengali well known restaurant present..
Lastly the bill amount goes to 1000/- for two ..most of the fish item's price were overpriced..so u cannot manage ur bill within 500/- for two as written..
I'll not suggest anyone to come this restaurant and just waste ur money as quality and quantity will not be able to satisfy u ..

Comparatively with others their price is pretty high if you compare food quality and quantity..others in same category offering better quantity with same quality so my problems is their high price only...because I've tasted their food only once..so really can't comment on that...

Visited this place for Lunch with family. Pretty disappointed with the food quality and quantity. Had ordered Elish Shorsher jhal n Kosha mangsho among other items. And both were disappointing. The Hilsa fish was below par quality and the mutton in the Kosha Mangsho was not even cooked properly, rather rubbery n tough to chew. I have had far better version of both these dishes at other places. The quantity of other items we ordered were not enough to be shared by two people. Also, not very helpful staff, makes the experience rather unpleasant, especially when you are out with your family. Not at all recommended.

We visited the place on a day of bengali new year. I like the upstair sitting arrengement. Since bengali cuisine is very close to my heart, i am very strict to the taste. We ordered
Luchi, kosha mangsho, bhaat, daal, alu bhaja, daab chingri, aloo posto, bhetki mach bhapa.
I like everything apart from the aloo posto, dude posto is love, you can not mistreat her, it was not well cooked. 
Mutton and daab chingri was nice and the bhetki had the right amount of mustard oil in it. 
 
You guys can ignore the buskin robbins icecream since i had it outside of the restuarent. 😉

This is the first time I ventured into this old name in Bengali cuisine. And I wasn't disappointed. The ambience is warm with old Kolkata touch and the tables are well spaced out with proper lighting arrangements. They have a fair spread in their menu and for starters we chose Postor bora, fish fry and hanser dimer devil. Each of them were delicious specially the dimer devil.
In the main course, we had rice, moong dal, jguro aloo bhaja, Pabda shorshe jhal, chingri malai curry and kosha mangsho. The items were succulent and deliciously prepared. 
The service was prompt and staff was courteous and helpful. Most probably will visit again.

This restaurant  is very nominal in terms of decore & atmosphere but items are highly priced as per the quantity they serve, each portion of items will only accompany one single person not more then that. it is mention wrong in Zomato that average cost for two is Rs. 500/- which is absolutely wrong as per the restaurant. We ordered for Posto bora which was served cold on request they reheated the same and served us, Then we ordered ruhi fish kalia which was made without any tomato flavour in it , rest we ordered mochar ghonto, Aloo Bhaja & aam Panna which was average as per taste. I being a hotelier i would suggest one time visit in this restaurant is ok for experience, as we have more option in the city now a days, so choose wisely.

Definitely value for money index will be pretty low .
We ordered plain rice,Sona mug dal, jhuri alubhaja,dum pulao, lonka bhapa murgi, fish fry,aam doi.

Now coming to quality.
Bhat,jhuri bhaja, fish fry was average.nothing dat great .Though it was overpriced in my opinion if you compare it with other Bengali restaurants lyk Kasturi, bhojohari manna.
I was really disappointed with their dal and dum pulao,dal was bland, not a single pea was there.
And pulao was horrible.
The only good thing was lonka bhapa murgi.it was delicious.

Oh price ? 
₹1200

Walked in for lunch with dying hunger at this beautiful   old styled bengali house decor restaurant. As the looks or the place impressed me but honestly the food didn't. 
We ordered plain rice, alu bhaja, ghee, macher matha Dal, chingri malai curry and sorshe elish for my friend.
The quantity is below standard. The quality was ok. Prices were more on the higher side maybe due to locating.
The staff and services were good but when the main purpose of good food didn't come my way thus won't visit again...overall average..😕

We ordered chingrir malaikari which was bit undercooked :(
And crab which was good :)
If you wish to visit the place with family, you wont be disappointed much. Moreover the pocket pinch is bearable ;)
The icing over the cake was the complementary mishti pan served at the end.. it was an ultimate adornment..

We ordered lunch from here on Sunday and it was borderline disappointing. Here's the items we had:

Fish Orly - Bland and soggy with terrible quality fish. It was pretty terrible.
Moog Dal - Watery with a complete lack of spices or any taste whatsoever.
Kasha Mangsho - Can't comment on the quality of the meat as I don't eat meat but the gravy was rich and palatable, albeit pretty oily.
Bhetki Paturi - Small in size but decent. Have had better paturis but not really complaining as I am a paturi lover.

Would I order from here again? Not really, no. Unless really desperate.

Tero Parbon is a fine restaurant serving a variety of Bengali dishes. Their fish preparations are pretty good and you may like to ask for Becki Paturi in advance, or Rui Maachher Kalia for either lunch or dinner.
It is a bit over priced, but it's in the running towards the top, if they improve their sauces a bit and bring their prices into reality!

Disappointing fare, in part because of the high prices, the tiny servings and overall low standards of service. We ordered posto bora, topse fry, chital muitha, mochar ghonto, potoler dorma both veg and non veg. The stuffy was tasty partly because of the high levels of salt and sweetness. The muitha was resting in a pool of spicy oil. Posto bora wasn't that great, coming in a batter fried version that wasn't expected. Mochar ghonto was too sweet to be enjoyed. Only the dormas were decent, let down in part because of the small servings. 

The service is close to horrible. There's this server with shaven head and wearing an earring who was impatient and discourteous. To top that he was coughing loudly into his hands the whole time we were there. There was this manager kind of guy who was sitting at the register, watching everyone constantly in a pretty weird and invasive manner. Pretty low standards, I must say. 

Before I end I must warn everyone, especially women customers, of the bathroom. There is only one. it has a urinal, a toilet and a sink. At times, multiple folks were using it at the same time. Enough said. Ladies, if you happen to be inside, please lock the door.

Heard lot about the restaurant . So obvious choice for me to have nabami lunch with my family. But Disappointed 😔
Order placed (4 persons): Rice , Basanti pulao, sona mugdal, aaloo bhaja , sorse pabda , chicken kasha , Boneless mutton kasha
Location : Good
Service : 👎(The worst I've seen till now)
Ambience : Average
Price : High due to puja
Food : average though mutton kasha and the pulao was more than good.
Waiting : 1hr outside restaurant and after they arranged the table another 50 mins for the food till served on plate.
Almost waste 2 hrs to fill the empty stomach.
Just because my mom loved the mutton i dare to give this restaurant 3 otherwise a big zero 👎
Never want to face this place again 😞😠😈

Tero Parbon , the name associated with 13 festivities of Bengali culture in 12 calendar months.
If anyone wishes to have a sumptuous bengali food ,it's a must visit place in kolkata.
I spent sometime here for a lunch in a rainy day. What an ambience i witnessed in a restaurant which offers authentic bengali cuisine , that helps me to remember my grand mother's kitchen delicacies.
I tried variety of hilsa dishes like..ilisher dim bhaja, ilish macher matha diye kachu sag, ilisher tel jhol.
They have somewhat uncountable menus with Hilsa fish. For non bengalis those are not familiar with great tiny bones of hilsa, which may not be manageable for them, they can definitely explore the boneless sahebi ilish here.
A great effort by the management for this endeavor!

I have been to this bengali restaurant on more than a few occassions, as a part of our family togetherness program. I mean with my family for dinner. The menu is somewhat what I expected from a "standardly" overpriced bengali restaurant. The flavor, however, was a little bit unique - only a little bit. Their dab chingri is one of my favorite items, although I'm allergic to crabs and prawn. The ilish items are also quite nice, although my dad always complains about the high price. (best to ignore him and write this review).. All in all, it has been a good experience on every visit.

It really pisses me off when a so-called supposedly sophisticated restaurant sets prices inclined to higher notch but fails to serve food having quality and quantity even 1/4th of that mark. I was so damn disheartened, so were my friends. Went to a bong restaurant after long with flickers of excitement in heart, but such an odium.
'Pomfret Sorshey Jhaal', can't even expect a proper one, tasted bland and burnt. Even worse, 'Pabda Rosha' catching early staleness. 'Mushoor Dal' be like holding a bowl under running tap water and drinking it. 'Murgir Jhol' was edible, of course not worthy of mentioning. Only thing which I liked was 'Beguni', but I guess that too is no better than the street oil-fry shops.
Laughable thing is they have tons of Hilsa menus, which is a seasonal fish. I mean really? Who cares about Hilsa when you can't even prepare the basic dishes. It'd be a disgrace to Hilsa if it was cooked the way others were made.
Utter disappointment. Not gonna visit or recommend this pretentious joint to anyone, for real.

Tero Parbon 
Happened to eat lunch out here when I was in Kolkata this time. 
Kothay aachhe "Baaro Maashe Tero Parbon"...... Loved to see the huge menu list of various items which made me feel nostalgic as I have grown up with all those dishes so close to my heart.
The food tasted yummmm....
Had Aam Panna, Bhetki Chingri Monohora (sorry couldn't take the pic on time, as was super hungry), Narkol posto diye Elish, Sobuj Bhapa Elish, Panthar Jhol with Steamed Rice. Ended with Paan and Misri-mouri. Lavish spread, sumptuous food, delectable taste. Aam panna being well balanced. The Bhetki Chingri Monohora was super smooth. Elish as usual was the dish of the day. Mutton was flavorful with right amount of masala. Loved to end the heartwarming meal with Paan. 
The decor is not too flashy yet tastefully done. Gives a very warm cosy kind of atmosphere. The little addition of the coasters with the logo is sweet. 
Overall, a good feeling...a hearty lunch...an afternoon well spent. 
Will visit again to try the other dishes :)

The Mutton with just the right amount of spice & tender pieces and the Pulao had optimum flavour. Just one point to complain, their parcel charge is a little high. If I'm not wrong, they charge 12/- per container.

The sizzle of the sauce on the hot iron plate notified us of the arrival of our food in a few minutes, and there it was! A beautiful cross-sectional piece of ilish, sitting pretty on a hot plate over a cabbage leaf, surrounded by peas and carrots. Well the sight itself could have given a mini heart attack to many traditionalists, who would be outraged at this blasphemy of sorts, but I was already enticed by the smell of it. As I plunged my cutlery into the fish, it felt very odd using such sharp, ruthless metal things into a velvety soft, beautiful piece of ilish, so it transferred it to my plate and dug in with my comparatively kinder fingers. It took me quite a few moments to decide if I like it or not, and finally I was forced to conclude that yes, I do like it, a lot. It was a joy to have that steak-fied hilsa, in a sweet-tangy glaze which at no point over-powered the intrinsic taste of the fish itself. And it was in that co-ordinated harmony that I realized that off-beat ilish might not be a very bad thing after all!
                                          ...

There is a saying in Bengali that Bengalis have "baro mashe tero parbon" which literally translated in English means that Bengalis celebrate thirteen festivals in twelve months. And with festivals or fiestas comes traditional good food. Located on Purna Das Road, this place is well known for their fish delicacies especially Hilsa. Of course the speciality items vary from season to season depending on the availability of fish. The ambiance is good and so is their service. The waiters are quite friendly and they assist you to choose from the menu if you are visiting first time. During our visit the order included rice, dal, aloo posto, mochar ghonto, topshe fry, bhetki paturi, chingri malai curry, nalen gurer ice cream. All the items were delicious. I would suggest one must try the topshe fry and nalen gurer ice cream if not anything else.

Very nice experience at Tero Parbon. I'm a Probashi Bangali, hence eating authentic Bengali food is a very big deal for me, and this place really made me so happy and satisfied that I would really miss the food I ate there.
I had Beguni, a dish I never eat at home, so happily there that my family was shocked. Then we had ordered for elish bhapa, malai pomfret, papda shorshe jhal, doi elish, aloo posto, chholar dal and bhat, bhetki chingri monohora, and aam panna.
The elish bhapa was really wonderful and very very tasty, so was the malai pomfret! Bhetki chingri monohora still makes me salivate when I think of it, and the rice and chholar dal perfectly complimented each other. The aam panna was so soothing and tangy, that it just made the food experience wholesome.
Loved this place and will surely visit it once I visit Kolkata again!

A good ambience place to have Bengali dish. We ordered Tel jhal koi and bhapa ilish. Food is good portion is adequate for single individual. Egg devil as starter was good. 
Would recommend it as a good Bengali resturant , slightly on the expensive side. 
One plus point would be car parking space available.

Had ordered rice, prawn pulao, fish(katla) kalia, bhetki gondhoraj and mutton kasa..we tried the kalia , it's too oily , spicy and strong smell of garlic dominating the other flavours..it has a overfried fish piece and one potato. Gondhoraj bhetki has one piece of overfried bhetki fish in the same gravy as kalia as the look and taste were alike with one slice of lemon. The only difference was the kalia was sweet and this was tangy. Both the fish had lost it's taste and charm due to the gravy nor the quality of fish was such that it could leave it's mark. The mutton kasa by now tasted same as fish gravies. The prawn pulao was actually plain ghee bhat with micromini pieces of kaju hardly traceable and 1 medium sized prawn ,salt less and again hard due to over frying was just placed on the ghee bhat . We had the food home delivered otherwise after trying out the kalia we wouldn't have made the mistake of placing further orders. The item Bhetki Gondhoraj and prawn is part of  their menu if you place home delivery order via swiggy.

It's a great place if you're looking for authentic bengali cuisine. The price is reasonable. We had gondhoraj chicken and chicken kachalanka in the main course with roti and luchi. The dishes were great.

Okay so this review has been long due! Tero Parbon is my favourite joint for that perfect Bengali lunch that every Bangali staying away from Kolkata craves for. This place has never failed to impress. I love the ambience here and the service is quite prompt. The staff is very helpful when it comes to ordering and advises you on the best fish preparations of the day. The Bhetki fry is mouth watering here and a must try. Kosha Mangsho is impeccable and no complaints there. Ilish Bhapa.. Pabda Sorshe.. Chitol Maacher Muittha are some of my absolute favourites here. All fish preparations are fresh and so delectable that you would be left wanting for more. Also don't miss out on the Nolen Gurer Ice cream which is very yummy. The best part is that all the preparations are quite non spicy and after a heavy overdose of fish mutton and mishti your taste buds are satiated without feeling overly heavy. I love going back to this place again and again so definitely five stars to it.

The food was quite descent out there. A complete and pure Bengali cuisine. The ambience was quite soothing unlike many other Bengali cuisine restaurants. I liked the food but the kasha mangsho was a bit spicy. Would have been best if they look forward towards "re-reciping" it :) Would love to visit again soon.

We had gone there for lunch,
ordered white rice, Hilsa Bhapa, Dal with macher matha, luchi, Cholar Dal and
prawn malaikari. Order taken by captain Subrata. One portion of prawn malaikari
was stale. When reported that to captain personally, he demanded proof, but the
portion of prawn was very less and had only one bite which was taken inside
mouth. Never expected this attitude from a reputed Resturant. Please do not
come here for food where you need to prove that the food served was stale and
hotel staff feel that you are doing this to save money after eating food (as if
you eat by begging)

Mind blowing experience, very intellectual ambiance, very Bengali feel for a non East Indian, very helpful staff, help me navigating to this place, followed up with more then twice speaks volume of they care for their guest.

This restaurant can boast of "bangaliyana" ambience along with tasty food.
Have been visiting this place for last 5 years and must say the standards have been well maintained.
Aloo posto, jhuri aloo bhaja, mocha chingri, dal - lip smacking. In fish category, chitol maacher peti is a must must try. For typical bongs(like me)..... Sorse illish is mouth (and eyes) watering and hence do not dare give it a miss. Tried pompfret, but it was average. Presentation of food can be worked on.

The joint does need to add some good Bengali delicacies in dessert section like nolen gurer ice cream or Misti doi. The dessert choices did disappoint me.
Overall it is clear winner in cleanliness, friendliness of staff, variety in food. I find is a safe bet to take my guests at this place. With the kind of standard that this place maintains in terms of taste, variety etc, the cost is OK types.

Been here few times but on 14th April(Poila Boishak) it was the worst experience ever. Every item were priced 20-60 rupees extra including it was mandated to purchase mineral water at double price(40 when the MRP is 20). Ordered Radhaballavi with cholar-dal which were average. Macher matha diye sona moong dal not up to the mark. Chitol macher peti, this item was horrible. very bad smell was coming from the fish seemed at least a  week old refrigerated fish cooked in a very oily gravy. Boneless mutton - very chewy and almost not cooked thoroughly. The manager looking guy wearing spectacle(the taller one) was also very unprofessional and not courteous at all. So in a nutshell this was the last visit there.

Tero Parbon !! Certain place to celebrate the sophisticated bong in you ... Located at Hindustan park ... True definition of sophistication starting from the menu to the food spread to the ambience and decor ... Although the menu consist of everything that similar bong cuisine speciality restaurant chains in the city have but the difference lies in the aromatic spices and the exact amount of oil used which is quite impressive as being a fitness freak myself I prefer to always have quality food with negligible amount of oil and spices and this place compliments my diet regime to a great extent ... Having said that there is no compromise in the food taste and quality ... Would love to relish bong in me at this place time and again

Was completely famished when we reached here ... with lots of apprehension we entered 13 parbon. What caught my eyes was the absolute bonedi decor complete with copper vessels , and hath pakha.... Now , every restaurant has its own usp , and tgis was no different ... But the ambience took it, altogether to a new level.. We ordered gondhoraj bhetki , goalondo chicken curry , Chingri paturi ... and tgey tasted equally good... But I guess they need to work on the serving time.....

A prime example of d most rapid degradation and deterioration in quality and service. Yesterday we went for dinner.
We took Macher Chop, Mochar Chop,Fish Fry, Fish Orly, Dum Pulao, Mutton Kosha, daab chingri, luchi, Rabri.
I couldn't identify which one was mach and which one was mocha.
Mutton Kosha had 1 ltr oil.
Daab chingri had no flavor of daab. In fact the gravy was similar to mutton kasha.
Then came the most horrible experience. Dum Pulao. It was so sticky with heavy oil (or dalda?) without any taste and smelt like old one.

 When asked, the staff informed that it was made in d morning.
Rabri had salt in it.
We expected that they won't charge for d Pulao. But they did it shamelessly.
I had several outing in this restaurant earlier but was stunned with deterioration of quality.
I take a vow to never visit this place again in my lifetime.

Review coming pretty late! The interior reminds you of an old bangali bari, with simplistic decor. Now coming to the main point, the taste of the food was out of this world! I've never tasted such delightful Dum pulao. It reminded my mother of Balaram er prasad (puri), yes it was that amazingly cooked! We took aloo dum and kosha murgi with it - these too, were delectably prepared. However, the quantity of the pulao was pretty less. We had to order 2 plates, and the pieces of chicken were also not good enough. I wish they would increase the quantity a tad bit more. But i repeat, the taste of the food will blow your mind! Pocket pinch - 680. Overall a good experience.

We Had rice with Dal , Pabda fish, pomfret fish. Not sure if they prepare with less salt or they forgot. But my experience was very bad as I don't use table salt Nd have to eat saltless food.  Overall my experience was bad hope from now chef will check before serving to customers.

Although, I thought the bhetki could have been better. Rabri for dessert was out of this world, absolute lip smacking. I feel they can improve a little on their service time (which was a good 40 minutes).

Tero Parbon is a place where I have visited multiple times in the past. One thing which pulls me to their restaurant is the ambience, decor which is quite simple, yet traditional. Now coming to the food part, its quite okay-ish. Flavors are not over done and food taste is quite standard. Considering the price it may pinch a bit but nothing like some other bengali establishments. I would say visit this place if you are looking for a decent meal within reasonable budget. But don't set out of the box expectations. Some of the noteworthy dishes are Daab Chingri, Chingri Malai Curry, Murgi Golondari Jhol, Nolen Gurer Ice-cream. Best time to visit - They have an annual illish- chingri festival during monsoon.

Big spacious place with superb ambiance and decor. A nice place to taste bengali dishes. Orders daab chingree, doi ileeesh, tel koi, bhetki kalia and gondhoraj murgi. Rice daal and bhaja was very good. All the food tasted as required. Happy to have them. Also tasted the Nalen goorer ice cream. I personally don't like it as it tastes like nolen gurer chhanar shondesh which i dislike. But my parents liked it si its cool too. The only thing negetive is the speed of service and the only 1 wash room considering the big place ot has. These can be corrected. Variety of menu is what gives us the pleasure to taste the different dishes. A nice place. Rs. 600 per head what it costs in average.

I would have rated it 4.5 sheerly based on the food but the staffs were not exactly courteous and hence a 3. Nice decor with a traditional old Calcutta touch and quite spacious. The food is awesome. But staff services were quite poor. They messed up with the orders and said since we were chitchatting between ourselves hence we didn't realize what orders we placed and that too in a rude manner. And never even bothered to inform that a dish wasn't available when we were placing the order. Only when we inquired about it some time later it was mentioned that it wasn't available. And the prices charged are quite high. Surely not a value for money option.

I was shocked when I saw the bill...they charged 60rs per bottle of water +service tax+ vat...  :( :(

Had a very disappointing experience at this outlet which I used to vouch for mostly. I am a permanent resident of Kolkata but working in Hyderabad for the last 6 years and whenever I come in during diwali I make it a point to visit this rest. to satiate our craving for bengali food.

Today was this years quota and was there for lunch. We ordered for the regular Rice, Fish head dal, Alu fry, Rui Kalia, Alu Jhinga Posta and one Ilish Paturi.

Positives - Ilish paturi was good though a little overpriced for 300 odd bucks for one slice of fish.  Rice dal and alu fry as always tasted good.

Negatives - Rui Kalia - Raw cooked cold fish served in mutton gravy. Its a cardinal sin to serve raw fish with blood still oozing out from the bones. Three pcs was like that and on asking the manager the reason - his justification was that since there is so much fat on the fish, the flesh is like that and its okay to eat. But he had no answer for the blood. None of us three tasted that fish and left it. The gravy was clearly not a kalia gravy as it was missing the punch of mustard. 

Service was below par and I am sure the downfall of this establishment has started. When the manager saw me taking the pic of the raw fish he came running to my table and offered a 10% discount. I told him that service is something when you change the dish and not offer a paltry 10% to save your reputation. This was my last visit to this place coz when I pay 150 odd bucks for a single piece of fish, I expect it to be served and cooked beautifully. I am sure the fish was half fried yesterday and was frozen overnight and when the cook tried to make a gravy out of it, the thing did not go through.

A BAD BAD EXPERIENCE!!!

Cheers!!

When I crave for a change of taste I frequently visit Tero Parbon as it has got a very homely atmosphere with well served bengali dishes! You will find the exact feeling when you visit yoir grand-maa's place and is served with delicious bengali food.. Starting from Aam Panna, few mouth-watering starters, Bhekti Paturi, Pabda Macher jhal, Elish bhappa, pulao, kosha mangsho, chutney and my favourite nolen gurer ice-cream delactably lists on top in terms of taste! Every visit happens to be memorable as the management is generous and polite. Thumps up to the team! 👍

This used to be one of the places we frequented for Bengali cuisine, however our last visit before Pujo was a complete let down. The prices have become exorbitant and the quality and quantity have gone down. Service the less said the better, as waiters are not keen to serve. Honestly we have better places which offer good food and better service at a more reasonable price.

The building looked a bit old than I expected. Staff was OK but I normally expect better behavior from Bengali restaurants in time of Durga puja. We tried Rui kalia, rice, Mangsher poulao, kasha mangsho(boneless was not available at that day).
Poulao was good but quantity of all the items were less. Almost every restaurant serves more quantity per serving.  I expected size of Rui to be a bit bigger. Felt a bit disappointed. 
One has to buy mineral water. Its really strange that they don't have regular water. No problem with that but my personal opinion is that drinking water should be free in any restaurant.

Price was exorbitant and was astonished to find that fish fry which consisted of two small rohu fish pieces costing Rs. 200/-..... We ordered shorshe chicken as it was mentioned in menu card that it will have 6 pieces..... It indeed had sic pieces but the dimension of each piece can be measured in centimetre..... Taste was good though..... But not amazing....

It was 'Shoshti' afternoon, and we entered an already packed and crowded 'Tero Parbon', and were escorted to a cramped seating area. The staff did not seem very interested in catering to the customers, since it was pujo, and people would drop in, in any case. This made me feel a bit irritated, since it was my first experience at this restaurant. The menu was not just steeply priced, but was exorbitant. One does not mind paying a reasonably high amount at restaurants during Pujo, since we dine out and enjoy and are usually in a festive mood, but, I definitely felt as if I was being fleeced, when I was charged 80 bucks per plate of luchi (4 pieces per plate), and 60 bucks for a 1 litre bottle of mineral water (We were told they would not serve regular water, and since we did not carry water with us, we were bound to 'buy' mineral water, at an unreasonably high price). The other items which we ordered (Potoler dolma which had just 2 pieces of 'potol' and Kosha murgi) were equally over-priced. Already disappointed with the pale interiors (The entire restaurant for that matter, is in need of a serious renovation, as they could not hide the damp marks on the ceiling, even with the so called 'traditional' decor), the over-crowded seating area and the completely unfriendly (...and to some extent, arrogant) staff, I did not have the heart to 'enjoy' the food (Though, the food was decent, but in no way did it justify the price). Over-all, a not-so-great experience, at a restaurant which I had heard a lot about. I would give it 2.5 out of 5, just for the food.

Bengal cuisine at Kolkata have to be something really palatable and to be remembered. But this place lacks all of it. And the most important think is hospitability which they haven't heard of it ever. My visit for three times to this place has only annoyed me by their behaviour. Food is nothing special to be mentioned. Even aampora sharbot is kochupora here to describe properly. There are better places around.

Very poor and disappointing... No wonder the footfall here is less...
Went for lunch on a weekend afternoon... The decor and ambience are good... But the food!!!
For starters, we had fish Orly, two small pieces of fish for 340....you would get better at bijoli grill outlets... Not worth the money
For mains, we had pulao which is plain normal "mishti pulao",but the quality of rice was that of a street side hotel...sticky and poor in quality
With that, we had kosha murgi which they claim to give 4 pieces but is actually two in quantity... Since the other two are just small pieces of bone... This for 225 bucks... Absolute waste
For deserts, we took rabri which was made from water not milk!!!!! Even the smallest sweet shop nearby will serve better rabri..
Ended that with paan which was ok....
The quantity is unimaginably less and every dish is overpriced...one plate of pulao is barely sufficient for two people...
The staffs need to be trained too!!!!!!! They keep dropping things here and there... Also if you're seated on the way, they'll simply push you and go....without even having the decency to seat you properly...
Please never visit this place unless you want to waste money...

Well, what can one expect in a saptami afternoon- a delicious Bengali cuisine. So, we didn't hesitate trying this much hyped Bengali restaurant.
However, at this place, although paying a bill of 5.5k for four people seemed not worth spending our Buck.
We ordered everything in authentic Bengali delicacies and which are pretty commonly liked by many who visit here like- dab chingdi, luchi, chicken kasha, chittol Mach, hilsa and so on and so forth.
But, what I think of the food is that it tasted a bit bland. Something in every dish was missing. And ofcourse they are so overpriced. 

In a nut shell, if u are paying this amount of Bill then why wouldn't one go to 'oh Calcutta'. They are far better than Tero parbon.

50% price increased from menu displayed in zamato,

The quantity per plate is much less than my expectation.

Worst of all - they dont serve plain normal drinking water.

You will be forced to buy mineral water @ Rs 60 plus tax per litre

Yesterday I had read the reviews and the Price List of TERO PARBON from ZOMATO and decided to have the vegetarian lunch there on the occasion of Durga Ashtami. Today, we were three and paid Rs. 1339/- plus tips to them for the lunch with rice (3 small plates), kichuri (1 small plate), mochar chop (4 small pieces), mochar ghonto (1 small plate), sona muger dal (1 small bowl), potoler dolma (2 pieces) and chutney (1 very small bowl). Of course, we took 1 liter drinking water at Rs.60/- plus tax. Both the quality and quantity of the items do not match with the price. I think that the price list available at ZOMATO is old. I swallowed with pain one hard stick of mocha after which I searched the bowl and located a few other similar sticks. Although the amsotto-khejur chutney was too...oo sweet, I just stopped from buying another liter of water and saved Rs. 63.36/-. Occasionally, I cook at home and it would cost Rs. 30/- to prepare similar standard Sona Muger Dal at least 4 times the quantity we got today by paying Rs. 135/- + tax. The Khichuri must be just one large spoon (Hata) and paid Rs. 165/- plus tax for the same. I didn't find anything extraordinary there except a few small pieces of kaju. 

It looks like an oil-painted  Dalan at the ground floor of an old building. Beautifully dressed customers caused to uplift its otherwise too ordinary ambiance.

Looking for authentic Bengali cuisine, we end up here on  Saptami; it was crowded as expected and had to wait for around an hour to find us a table.  They offer a variety of starters and main course complete with deserts. Ordered alu posto,fish fry,sona moong dal,kosha mutton,kosha chicken, and panther jhol. The delivery time was quite fast to my surprise as the place was completely occupied. The moong dal and alu posto were nice; found it tasty. The fish fry was a bit let down being not hot and crisp. The kosha mangsho was great so was kosha chicken. The biggest let down was panther jhol as the curry was tasteless. 
P.s: Being Puja time I'll give them a benefit of doubt and would like to try out some other time to find out how they manage to deliver.

A visit on panchami seeking Bengali food turned out to be disappointing.  On my palette I had dum poloa, bhat, luchi, fulkopi aloor dalna, kosha mangsho, bhekti paturi and parsher jhol. Poloa quantity is surprisingly less, Taste wise I would recommend to go for fulkopi aloor dalna and kosha mangsho. Parsher jhol was below par. Overall it was an unsatisfactory visit and probably I would think twice before coming here for bengali food again.

Went here last Pujo on Saptami, with my partner.
We ordered Shada bhaat, Basanti Pulao, Chhaana r Dalna and Daab Chingri.
The Basanti Pulao was fragrant with ghee, full of Kaju Kishmish and the rice was long-grained.
The Chhanar Dalna had soft balls of Chhana dunked in a nice, spicy gravy.
But, the star of the show was the Daab Chingri, it was worth every penny of the princely sum of Rs.650. The juicy jumbo prawns swimming in a pearly white gravy with the delectable taste of the 'daaber shash' was to die for, even after a year I can feel the taste in my mouth :p

P.S. The only drawback, albeit a considerable one is the quantity of rice served. It's just about two spoons per tiny bowl, not even enough to fill an infant's stomach.

A nice ambience provided with nice seating facility and decor. The waiters were well dressed and mannered. Coming to the food, everything we ordered reached the table within 10-15 mins max and tasted delicious. Just that I have to complain about the quantity which seemed less than expected. The bhapa ilish was the highlight. A bit overpriced but you shouldn't mind it much when you get food that is worthy for your palate.. :)

I have been here quite a few times by now and have always enjoyed their Bengali spread. Yesterday for lunch my mother and I popped in for some scrumptious food. 

Firstly their service has become super duper slow. After a 35 minute wait we got our starters and then we had to wait another 15 minutes for our main course. 

Now to the food. We ordered Daab sorbot, a soft drink, Mochar Chop and Bhetki Chingri Monohora for starters. The filling of the Mochar Chop was nice but the bread crumb on the outside seemed stale. The best dish of the afternoon and which I know I can keep eating forever is the Monohora. What a beauty of a dish. The prawn filling is the most beautiful thing on earth and combined with that Bhetki and that beautiful batter, this is the real deal. 

Our main course consisted of plain rice, dhokar dalna, chitol macher muitha, Prawn malaikari, lanka bhapa murgi and kosha mangsho. Of all these, the dhokar dalna was the winner. The curry of the prawn and chicken dishes were good, though the prawn and the chicken both were overcooked which was a shame as they ruined their beautiful curries. The mutton and the fish dish both were rather disappointing. 

Though there were some winning dishes here, the bad ones really made our experience a little damp.(Maybe we were expecting it to be much better.)  We have always loved their food but this time we weren't that happy. 

Food Recommendations: Bhetki Chingri Monohora, Fish fry, Luchi and Hing Alur Dom, dhokar dalna, Cholar Dal, Prawn malaikari, lanka bhapa murgi.

This place I had visited for lunch while doing the puja shopping... 
Ambience and decor was very impressive and a home like feel they wanted to create which is really appreciated..
Coming on to the food.. We ordered rice dal postor bora Chitol Mach er muitha and  mutton. Dal and rice were fine.. But the postor bora was not at all good... Tasteless.. Mutton was a bit stiff and hard ... And the chitol Mach was OK..
But the most disgusting part is the quantity specially the chitol Mach served in a small bowl sized an ice bowl.. Not acceptable if u are charging so much.. Not enough gravy for one person also to have the meal... 
Disappointing ... 
Quality was ok they try to maintain but could be improved.. But taste quantity sud be improved ..
Service wise they are very supportive.. For me its below average.

We hogged and hogged and hogged at Tero Parbon during our last visit to Kolkata. The fish fry was amazing. We also tried the bhetki paturi along with mochar ghanto, chicken kasha and cholar dal. Lip Smacking.  I actually needed a crane to lift me from my seat for the amount I ate. The nutun gur ice cream was out of the world. The entire experience took me back years when I used to be in Kolkata and relished the food there regularly. Did I mention before I hogged like crazy!!!

The hand picked Bengali menu for a vegetarian at Tero Parbon, Purna Das Road, Kolkata. That's right, Bengali cuisine with an authentic menu is not just about the fish and meat, it's a lot more than that. Packed with flavors and textures, this was one of the best experiences at eating authentic food. On the menu was,. On the menu for us was Luchi, Chholar dal, Bhaath, Shukto, Aloo posto, Postor boda, Chorchudi, Pulao, Chhaanar daalna, Aamer chaatney, Nolen Gur Icecream and to finish the heavenly meal, the sugar Gods personally hand crafted Kolkata's most celebrated "Mishti Doi". This was undoubtedly Kolkata in one plate for me. Couldn't have asked for anything better to experience the true Kolkata flavors. If youre in Kolkata and looking for an experience like this, visit Tero Parbon at Purna Das Road.

"Janta Janardan"

"Yeh Public hain Yeh sub jantey hain"

For my fellow foodies who are thinking that I have lost it please wait……

While the first comment is a favorite of politicians and the second is a song by the great Kishore Kumar,what they basically say is that the collective appraisal by the public in general is always right,more than the experts or other agencies.

Why this becomes relevant is that in a forum like Zomato where people give grades according to their experience the majority view has a great influence on decision by foodies.

i have learnt this the hard way when my cafe was reviewed,sometimes brutally.As an entrepreneur one has to learn to accept and respect public appraisal.

Hence as i went through a lunch at Tero Parbon,a bengali restaurant,i appreciated how accurate the foodies have been.

Kosha mangsho,kacha lonka murgi,luchi,polao,paturi etc was ordered and consumed.While everything was ok,it lacked the special something that makes a restaurant stand out in the crowd.Nothing exceptional,again nothing totally bad.

just as i thought how to review a place like this I remembered those famous phrases which shows a ranking which explains this place better than words.

Ambience was nice and the wide road had car parking just across the road.

Located near Hindustan park and one day friends decided to try out this place. The ambiance of this place is somewhat of the old Kolkata with black wooden chairs and I loved this ambiance specially when I am having a bengali cuisine.

Tried the kancha lanka murgi, kosha mangsho, and bhetki maacher kalia and pulao. The taste of kancha lonka mugi was somewhat so so but the kosha mangsho was really nice and so the bhetki maacher kalia.

If you want to try out some benagli cuisine, this place will not disappoint you. However I feel that this is tad expensive place.

For being the capital of Bengal, Kolkata has very few restaurants which serve authentic Bengali cuisine.
Tero Parbon is one of the few places which does.
The food is very good and they've tried to keep it authentic.
Our order included Luchi, Radhabollobi (Apologies if thats apelled incorrectly), beguni, alu chop etc.
We also ordered the Postu vada which I didn't care too much for. Just didnt have the right taste.
I only have two suggestions, Firstly they can try and make the food a little less oily; granted that Bengali food is inherently oily, but I felt that it was a bit much. The second is that they can try and do up the decor and the quality of seating a bit.

Giving it a rating of 4 because the food is good.
Do visit for an authentic Bengali experience.

When I first visited Tero Parbon, I remember wishing to have brought a Tagore novel. The decor, the music and the menu reminds you of traditional Bengali culture with a hint of modernisation. I have visited this place with my family and friends and have immensely enjoyed myself. The staff is courteous and efficient. Though I am partial to dining at home during Bengali festivities, Tero Parbon won't disappoint those who want to explore traditional Bengali festive cuisine.

I used to dine at Tero parbon on special occassions like Poila baishak or Kali pujo when I was in Kolkata. It offers a homely decor which I liked. One of my most favourite items is the Kakrar Jhaal they serve. It is amazing in taste.. the Ilish and Bhetki preparations are good too. Polao and Kasha mangsho is another hit combo. Aam pora sarbat goes well with the meal. Prices are a bit steep but food is good. Service is a bit slow but manageable. Good place to try Bengali cuisine

From decor to lighting to seating arrangement and primarily the food everything is up to the mark. Only disappointment at the end was the billing error. Apart from that the service is very courteous and pleasant. The hilsa (bhapa ilish) was fresh and tempered with the right amount of mustard not making it too tangy or spicy. The beguni was crisp and tasted perfect with the shona monger daal. A relishing bengali spread worth every pice you pay.

We were late for lunch nd were also hungry. It was raining. The nearest to the place I was , was tero parbon. There was hardly anyone. And we were the 2 nd group there. I have been here earleier and the I love their taste. The ambience was very good. Neat clean. Hilsa festival was going on. The waiters were helpful.  We ordered ilish Dum biriyani, ilish doi, ilish sorshe, iliah Tel jhol, ilish posto along with 3 bhat and 1 ilish Tel. Ilish biriyani was good.Tel jhol ilish was avg.not extraordinary as expected. Ilish doi was good.it was sweet. New dish for me.liked it.ilish sorshe was also good. But the best was posto ilish. Superb taste.all the fishes were soft and perfectly cooked.loved the evening lunch. ND also the place and the food. Will visit again someday. Pocket pinch was 2324/-,which was not too much according to what we took and the place and taste.

Last time when I was passing by Purna das road suddenly I discovered this place.from that time it was in my wishlist.finally I went there couple of days ago.pure authentic bengali food place.i just love the place.
========================================Location ->>> walk straight from golpark petrol pumb towards just baked walk 5-7mins on the right hand side there is "Tero Parbon"...
There is a saying "bangalir baro mase tero parbon" simply I love that...
=======================================Decoration n interior ->>>
Well without any doubt simply superb from decoration to ambience everything place very big I love this kind of restaurant with big sitting arrangement.
=======================================Food n brevarage ->>> started with Aam panna n Daber sarbot

Aam panna-normal in taste mixed with masala.

Daber sarbot-not different simply Daber jol they served.

Main Course ->>>
1.Elish polau - very very good taste.every kind of ingredients there with a nice flavour with a elish mach.

2.malai chicken - another good dish chicken taste wise good creamy kind of gravy melted inside mouth quickly there are 6 chicken parts.but they are very small.

3.kacha lonka murgi - this is just amazing a typical bengali dish served with chilli a but spicy but yet it's a leapsmaking juicy dish.
=======================================At last 
Rabri ->>>taste wise good I love this sweet dish.
========================================their service very good food quality too good but the only thing I don't lyk is their quantity of the food very small if I am paying 325/- for polau n for side dishes 225-250/- per dishes quantity need to be increase a bit.my tummy lyk almost empty 40% full.

Food quality- 4/5
Decoration n ambience- 3.5/5
Service-3/5
This is a good place for authentic bengali foods.

If you want to enjoy traditional Bengali Food with good environment please visit this place. It will not cut your pocket with huge unnecessary cost while the food will have the great taste which you may had during your childhood from your grandmom. Do not forget to try Hot Rosogolla. :-)

Visited with some of the north eastern friends for dinner. Ambiance wise full marks, orders for mocha chop, chingri bhapa, a betki dish and kosha mangsho with bhaat and lastly nolen gurer icecream. My friends really liked the food absolutely tasty and truely Bengali. Nolen gurer icecream was too good.

Last time when I was passing by Purna das road suddenly I discovered this place.from that time it was in my wishlist.finally I went there couple of days ago.pure authentic bengali food place.i just love the place.
========================================Location ->>> walk straight from golpark petrol pumb towards just baked walk 5-7mins on the right hand side there is "Tero Parbon"...
There is a saying "bangalir baro mase tero parbon" simply I love that...
=======================================Decoration n interior ->>>
Well without any doubt simply superb from decoration to ambience everything place very big I love this kind of restaurant with big sitting arrangement.
=======================================Food n brevarage ->>> started with Aam panna n Daber sarbot

Aam panna-normal in taste mixed with masala.

Daber sarbot-not different simply Daber jol they served.

Main Course ->>>
1.Elish polau - very very good taste.every kind of ingredients there with a nice flavour with a elish mach.

2.malai chicken - another good dish chicken taste wise good creamy kind of gravy melted inside mouth quickly there are 6 chicken parts.but they are very small.

3.kacha lonka murgi - this is just amazing a typical bengali dish served with chilli a but spicy but yet it's a leapsmaking juicy dish.
=======================================At last 
Rabri ->>>taste wise good I love this sweet dish.
========================================their service very good food quality too good but the only thing I don't lyk is their quantity of the food very small if I am paying 325/- for polau n for side dishes 225-250/- per dishes quantity need to be increase a bit.my tummy lyk almost empty 40% full.

Food quality- 4/5
Decoration n ambience- 3.5/5
Service-3/5
This is a good place for authentic bengali foods.

The best place to have traditional Bengali food in medium range (Rs.800approx. for two people) . I personally liked their kosha mangsho(mutton) and daab(coconut) chingri(prawn).The ambiance is nice and it is spacious.

As already mentioned by all that the ambience is extremely beautiful. The service is above average, while the courtesy of the staff is worth mentioning. The food quality for the veg items are far better than the non-veg items. I was a bit disappointed about the "Gondhoraj Mutton", the mutton pieces could have been more soft, while the taste is good but not out of the world.

After many visits... I m penning this down...Absolute luxury for Bengalis palate.. for the lavish spread of fish delicacies. . MELT in the mouth Ilish,  Bhetki,  Koi preparations with an equally competitive vegetarian platter on the offer..#Dhokardalna #Enchorerdalna.. this Food stop.. won't leave one disappointed. .
Not to 4get the Nolen gurer icecream.. to die 4.. 
Spacious place with traditional #OldCalcutta ambience and feel♥♥♥
As well as quality service. .
My favorite place for Lunch with Maa.. ☆★★★
The pocket pinch is a bit on high.. bt food is worth every penny ..although Nt as high as other Overhyped places in Kolkata

As a foodie i want three things frm a place good service, food, ambiance.... Last year i went to this place with my family ambiance is good ... Initialy service was good prlimnary foods like dal, rice, vegetables was also good .. But as soon as i received fish i felt like what d hell .... Fish was so hard and tasteless .... Suddenly after receiving my issues service went cold .... I felt like such a dam mistake i had done..... I would had managed if service guys nd management had done taken some steps but such cold service realy mad me sad and angry as well. So be there at your own risk...But As i say in every review taste and flavor varies from person to person so plzz do visit this place

Maybe i am rating this place very high, as i have a weakness towards bengali food, especially after staying away from Kolkata for the last 3 years. Went to this place on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch, and honestly i had an incredible sumptuous lunch. The ambiance suits to the concept of bengali food, maybe a little more bangali ethnic touch can be added, but even if its not done, it looks perfectly fine. Coming to the food, we ordered for Posto bora, Dal, Pulao, Kasha Mangso, radhabalavi, Bhetki Paturi, Aam Porar shorbot, mihi dana r ice cream and nolen gurer ice cream. And i can vouch for every dish that it was incredible to taste. AND I DO RECOMMEND THE NOLEN GURER ICE CREAM, just go and HAVE IT !!
Now coming down to the pricing, well i would say averagishly priced, the entire menu up top costed me 1200 bucks, which i believe is a decent pricing comparing the ambiance, taste, quality and quantity. 

I would suggest, if you have not been to the place, go out there right now and make your taste buds happy.

Happy Munchin :)

Tero Parbon is located on purna das road close to golpark crossing..Went there a few months back for a family lunch..The decor resembles an old traditional bengali house..with paintings and designer lamps on the wall..The servers are quite polite and efficient..Overall you will have a relaxed and comfortable time in this place..We ordered following items:
Aam Porar Shorbot: Refreshing,loved the masala added to the drink..
Dab Chingri: Pretty decent,six small prawns..but the gravy lacked consistency..have tasted better dab chingri elsewhere..
Chitol Peti: It was nice..the portions were adequate for two people to share..however priced way too extravagantly at 350/- per piece..
Channar Kalia: Another popular bengali dish..tasted well balanced..
Shorshe Murgi: Boneless pieces..This actually tasted way better than other dishes..quite unique..loved the blend of shorshe and chillies..
Gandharaj Mutton: Also tasted quite good..loved the aroma of gondhoraj lime..but the mutton should have been a bit more tender and juicy..
Had Pulao and Steamed Rice as accompaniments..
Ended the fare with Khejur Chutney  and Doi..
Overall it was a decent experience,our total cheque comes to Rs.4200/- for 7 people..But my point is if they fail to offer anything unique or innovative why I will spend such huge bucks for a general bengali meal which is also available in our Homes..Hence I would Recommend Bhojori Manna or 6Ballygunge Place any day over this place..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 2.5/5
Service: 3.5/5

We were a group coming from Bangalore and going to Sandakphu in Darjeeling via Kolkata. We reached the city at noon in high summer and were dying of hunger. I rang a friend in the city and she told me to go to this place since we were passing by. I fired up Google Maps and we screeched to a halt in front of the cosy-looking place after some time. 

I like fish. So reading the menu felt like sitting at some happy carnival. So many authentic Bengal fish dishes to choose from. But since most of them were put there in their local name, I had to kidnap and confine the waiter to explain what kind of preparation each fish was. I settled for fish in mustard sauce, fried fish and some fish curry with peas and potatoes, all of whose names I can't remember. 

The taste was excellent. I'd confidently say it was not hunger clouding my judgement. My initial impression that Tero Parbon would be just another Bengali food restaurant turned out wrong. 

The seating area is not that large but spacious enough to make you feel comfortable. It's quite cool inside (I don't like using AC most of the time but while eating I can't stand any summer heat). 

Bottom line: Tero Parbon is where you go to have well-prepared, clean and high quality Bengali food while in Kolkata at half the price you'd have to pay in a more upscale restaurant.

We went today evening with one foreigner with us. The ambiance is good. We asked for the non spicy food as the foreigner with us can't have it. We ordered starter and other items. The DAB Chingri was too sweet, unfortunately the foreigner liked it. We told them to make non spicy, but the Bhetki pathuri was even spicy for us. Finally, the the desert, we ordered Rossogolla as it is similar to the name of the foreigner. They also suggested Matribhog (a kind of sweet), but both of these sweets were horrible. They made joke of the famous Rossogolla of Kolkata. That matribhog was also an spoiler at the end.

I usually plan for this place every Maha Ashtamee noon. Very well decorated and peaceful ambience. Good quality of food. Some of the dishes are very ordinary e.g. Aalur dam tastes like any road side aalur dam that a common man eats as breakfast with breads in the morning. But some of the dishes are excellently cooked e.g. Daab Chingri is very well prepared with a proper blend of the daab flavour with malai and prawns. As a whole, we found most the the dishes to be well cooked and tasty. Price is moderate and that makes it reasonable. Service is good. I have only experienced this place during puja days; would not comment on the regular non-festive day.

Another lovely find for me in Kolkata. Highly recommend Tero Parbon for sumptuous Bengali flavours and preparations. 

A simple non assuming place that serves home style food. They serve small portion sizes which is good because you get to try several things of the menu. Be generous while ordering ! It's all very economical too ! 

I had a hearty veg meal that included baingan bhapa, dhoker dalna, enchorer dalna, masoor daal with parathas and luchis. I really relished the enchorer (jackfruit) curry since it's not something easily found in Mumbai. The lentil cake tomato curry was another winner ! Baingan bhapa was long sliced pieces of brinjal, I'd have preferred the round diced version more ! We topped off everything with veg pulao - which was a bit saffron sweet. It was nice but the rice and curry flavours did not blend too well.

I returned fully loaded after a heavy meal and look forward to returning soon !

This has been one of my favourite places for Bengali cuisine for a long time! I have been visiting this place since it opened with my family! And recently I took a special someone there and she was so impressed with the decor, the service and above all the food! It was really a great experience with her. I was so proud too! We had doi begun, doi ilish, bhetki paturi, nawabi daal (mug dal with prawns in it) and rabri. The bhetki paturi was a little too dry for my palate but the doi begun and the daal bowled us over! The real deal was the ilish though, and my lady, a khanti baangal, was very impressed with the quality of the dish, even though it is not really ilish season now. The surprise of the day was the rabri though! We ordered one but then had to reorder it! Tero Parbon is known for its desserts, but I did not taste their rabri before! And now it is a must for me whenever I go there!

Second experience

This time we had tel koi, gondhoraj mutton, and chitol muitha, and rabri for dessert and it was even better than before!

All of them were pure bengali food delight, specially the chicken. Ended up eating twice the amount i generally do. The ambience was generic bengali with bengali crowd and bengali setup..!

A couple of friends and I went to this restaurant two years ago,during Ashtami.The place was crowded,but it was expected.We ordered rice,moong dal,alu bhaja,mochar chop,kosha mangsho,chhanar dalna and daab chingri.
The dal was good,but there was room for a lot of improvement.Mochar chop was excellent.I like my mutton tender,so my kosha mangsho was a bit on the rarer side.The daab chingri was delicious and rich.However the chhanar dalna was a disappointment.The gravy was oily and bland.
The service was good.The waiters courteous.A good place for Bengali cuisine lovers.

A nice place for Bengali home-cooked-type meal. The location is easily reachable even with public transport and the entrance as well as decor is impressive. I went there twice and even my mum was satisfied with the food quality which is saying something. The fish chop and mochar chop was nice, mung daal was so-so, Kasha murgi was worth mentioning. Daab-chingri was taste-worthy as well. However, the marinate used in bhapa needs to b toned down, it was louder than the fish and a bit bitter. We went during summer and the dessert part seemed to be inadequate. Overall, again-visit-worthy

Tero parbon will always remain on my top list of good bong restaurants. I loved the buffet spread, ambience and the crowd. I don't like mutton much but tero parbon made me taste their mutton curry several times. It was different. Felt straight from Maa's kitchen. Polao and chingri is a must taste here. Rest all veg item s were good but dal was awesome.

Usually I don't prefer having bengali cuisine bt this tim I chose it mainly because of my hubby n secondly the puja season. it was my first visit to a bengali food restaurant.it was nabami aftrnun n the queue was quite long n aftr waiting for almost an hour we entered into it . Since I was vry hungry I didn't waste much tim n chatpat placed d order. -Plain rice,dal,alu posto, daab chingri n a mutton item( sorry dnt remember d nam).everything tasted vry good n I loved dm all. My 1st attempt was a successful one n aftr this I took parcels from several times. . I hv rated it 4 coz I wish d quantity to b little more

The ambience is great...the place has an old mystic charm. The food is good but not value for money.  The portions were too small for the price charged.

Food is really good here. Too costly for the pocket though. The setup is quite appealing and the overall experience was to remember for a long time. Best Bengali food at Garihat or Golpark area.

Decent ambience. An old Calcutta feel. I took my foreign freinds there. So tried the basic foods.. It was ok... 

Chingri macher malaikari was pathetic... Seemed like Chingri r jhol.. :D

Nolen gurer icecream was a good one...

Pathetic. Its a shame for all the Bengali foodies. Went there with my entire family for dinner on my parents anniversary since everyone voted for Bengali cuisine. Ilish mach was tasteless. Mutton lacked flavor. Desserts were boring. I mean there was nothing about this place worth liking. Yes its clean and hygienic if you are a health freak. That is all.

As my Head was in Kolkata, he always makes it a point to visit one bengali restaurant in every trip. This time we came to Tero Parbon. 
Service is very quick and efficient but food. The very small portion which is only fit for one person and not a great value for money. We tried chanar paturi, which was one in plate, sona mug dal, which was okay, rice, beguni and aloo posto.
Frankly speaking the paturi was sweet and tangy but lacked the zing of mustard. No smell of mustard oil
Sona Mug Dal could have been flavored well and the aloo posto, well much aloo and very tiny portion of posto.
For desser we had nolen gurere ice cream, matribhakti and roshogulla. The roshogullas were piping hot, matribhakti had no difference with gulab jamun but yes Nolen gurer Ice cream was really nice.

They should improve the portion and the food taste after all Bengali Food

Went there at dasami evening with friends…it was 7.30 n the restaurant was closed…after waiting for 40 mins the restro finally opened…
the ambience was quite good…i liked it…lets talk about the food now…
BASANTI POLAO-tasted good…
PLAIN RICE
CHANAR KOFTA-4 dumplings in a dry tomato based gravy, was disappointed with this dish
CHITOL MACHER MUITHA-completely  tasteless 
CHICKEN KOSHA- found 4 pieces of bone only
MACHER MATHA DIE MUG DAL N JHURI ALU BHAJA-Saviour of the day
i was very much disappointed with the food…the price is slightly on the steeper side…but it doesn't worth for the money…dont wanna visit again…

So after this long time fetish for Bengali cuisine I managed to visit to a really goood but not that well known like others Restaurant...
Thumbsup for the lovely ambience,the Rajbari feel is amazing..
Now coming to the food;we ordered Parda Paturi, Til er bata die Mangsho, Shorshe Murgi and Steamed Rice(Bhaat)..
Everything including the green salad was just perfect...Being a non-bengali the flavours of the Typical bengali food I had will be there always and will surely visit the place again..
I would like to ask Zomato reviewers to help this food place reach atleast 4 stars.. :)

We had lunch in 'tero parbon ' on Saptami and the experience was really bad. Starting from the small tables , which could hardly accommodate the bowls and plates to the unreasonably high priced dishes, it was a terrible experience right from the word go!!! I would also like to mention here one more thing the quantity of the pulao was really less so much so that 2 plates of pulao which cost us Rs. 280 was equivalent to one plate plain rice for Rs. 60/70.
It is a pity that a place with such good ambience and location was a complete let down :(

I was pleasantly surprised when I had my lunch yesterday here. We were a group of 9 and youngest member is of 3 years age.
Even during the Puja's the quality of food which they served was awesome. We had quite a mouthful with Hilsha Sorshe,Hilsha Bhapa,Daab Prawn,Chicken Kassa,Mutton Kassa as major siders..Even the gobi aloo & Aloo Posto..was great.. Only area of improvement are desserts & waiters who seemed to be missing the traditional Bengali courtesy...

Awesome experience.. Being a Bengali I have a soft corner for the Bengali restaurants.. But all of the Bengali restro we have in nearby,it is the best one.. Ambience is pretty good.. There was a good arrangement for waiting for tables.. Now foods are just awesome.. Well cooked.. Very tasty.. All items are too tasty that I cant explain.. Little bit costly.. But a good place for giving a treat to your near ones.. The main problem is its location.. A little bit tough to find out if you are going for first time..

Mains included bhaat, mocha, dhokar dalna, and a variety of Ilish for each of us and mutton kassa. Ilish paturi, ilish posto narkel and sahebi ilish were all nice. But the item of the day was the nolengurer ice cream. I have had this flavoured ice cream in many different places but the one served here beats them all...

A friend and I were looking for  place to lunch in the Purnadas Road area and chanced upon this place. It looked pretty nice, and we thought of trying it. Well, the decor and seating were all okay. But the price and quantity of food provided against it did not impress us. Well, Rs. 70 for one since piece of dim er devil containing half an egg seemed a bit too much to us compared to other similar bengali eateries. The ilish pulav to me seemed to be far from what it should taste -- the rice was full of red chili flakes. And so were the chitol muithe and kosha mutton. The nolen guler ice cream was so frozen that I could not spoon out half of it. Overall, not a very pleasant experience. The staff were courteous and the service pretty prompt though. 

One suggestion -- The Management could consider including a buffet spread or a thali at least during the lunch hours where people could savor various items in limited portions.

Tero Parbon reminds me of Ilish Maach Bhape I had few months back. In these days, good Ilish is almost extinct from local markets. Getting little frustrated with poor quality Ilish in the market, we ventured Tero Parbon on a sunday. 
I still remember the delectable juicy pieces of Ilish cooked in bhapa style of bengali household. It deserves a clear 4.5/5. However 0.5 is deducted for the extreme overprice and clumsy ambience of the restaurant. Given the price, you deserve a better ambience. N if you cant maintain, just bring down the price. The seats are uncomfortable. Table for four too small to accomodate 4 rice plates- leave the curry bowls.
If you can adjust this, just go ahead for quality food.... !!!!

Tero Parbon is one of the few authentic Bengali cuisine restaurant located in Hindustan Park. The name of the restaurant Tero Parbon is taken from a Bengali saying “baro mashe tero parbon” meaning 13 Bengali festivals in 12 months. The restaurant is good for eating out for any Bengali occasions such as Poila Baishak, Durga Pujo etc.

Food is at par with other Bengali restaurants but could be better. The menu is a total mess as finding items on the menu is a painful job, items are scattered like anything with no mention of starters, main course, veg/non-veg etc. It's like a contentious menu overall. Anyway, coming back to the food, I am a big fan of the fish fry as starters. Also some pulao, luchi, kasha murgi and some other items will do for an afternoon lunch.

Service is acceptable and no complaints on that. Quantity of the food is quite disappointing considering the price. Ambiance is good and interiors are done well.

The only problem with places like this is that the waiters try to push the most expensive item on the menu. I was with a friend, she wanted to have chetol macher muithya, but the waiter strongly suggested the peti. I had the pomfret masala.  The fish were fresh and tasty, but the gravy was the same and was more salty than anything else. We also ordered loochi and dal. The dal was really nice, but one loochi was full of oil, some how it managed to get inside.

Tero Parbon's buffet spread was to die for, the only downside was the absence of chicken preparations... however I was too disappointed to find out that they have discontinued it . Earlier their offerings were reasonably priced but now the prices are exorbitant. On our last visited we opted for Fish Fry, Peyaj Posto, Shukto, Bhaat , Malai Pomfret and Anarasher Chutney and that required us to shell out 1200 bucks for 2. The portions were too small (the fish fries were a joke.. they looked like the 25 bucks roadside ones and costed 110/- each , the Peyaj Posto was more of Posto and 2% Peyaj - tasted horrible, Shukto and Malai Pomfret were passable, the Anarasher Chutney was sweet enough to give you a lingering toothache lol ) .The service quality has deteriorated with time and I think the management has changed the workforce. The present servers care two hoots about the diners and are mostly found busy gossiping amongst themselves/giving salacious stares to female diners. Also the respective tables are two small for 2/4/6 diners.

Tero Parbon used to be a family favorite but am striking it off the favorites' list for the time being.

Visited tero parbon on a weekday evening, expected less crowd but was stunned to see the absolute emptiness of this place. The decor is quite nice and traditional bengali style. I was a bit apprehensive to start with but decided to experience the food. The food is quite pricey for the minuscule proportions they serve, I mean come on you dont serve a "bhape chingri" worth 250 bucks with 6 micro prawns on a very small bowl, atleast for that price people can expect some medium sized prawns not kucho chingri even though the quality was quite good. Chitol machher muittha was a bit tasteless. Shona muger daal and alubhaja was very tasty and quite like home.

Friendly advice: If you want to have a full blown dinner at a reasonable price avoid this place, If you want to take a long lost NRI friend to give a taste of bengali cuisine go ahead :)

My rating 3 (ovrall) -0.5(for price and portions)= 2.5.

The food is over priced according to me for the quality they provide. Even in a Elish festival the quality of Elish was very average.  I am not sure how many Bengalis appreciate a sweet gravy for Doi Elish. Totally messed up the dish. A simple Rui Kalia was half cooked. Service was good. Cooking medium etc was fine.Veg items were upto the mark. But am really disappointed with the quality of fish served and the pricing for such ordinary quality. At home any day we can buy better quality fish.

I like the kosha murgi and Mangsho with phulko luchi of the this place a lot!(it's not very oily as I like it)


Ambiance of this place is good,the service is pretty good too!

One incident that I'd like to share:
I had taken my mom to Tero Parbon almost a year back,she liked everything we ordered (from kosha mangsho to chingri daab)!
She usually never asks for things but that day maybe she had liked everything so she said:"why don't we have Nolen gurer ice cream" I said :"ok,lets try that".
It was the first time both of us had tasted it..
When it was served,my mom tried to take out a scoop but it was so hard that she couldn't.We both struggled for a while then the waiter noticed it and with our permission took the ice cream and came back with a new melted Nolen gurer ice cream and the liquid syrup!
Though the ice cream was really tasty,but me and my mom felt kinda odd!If this would not have happened then I'd have said that they provide excellent service.

This place is exceptionally sub standard. I went here once and since then I have refrained from going back to Tero Parbon. I had gone here some months ago for a dinner with my family. After visiting almost every single restaurant serving Bengali cuisine in Kolkata I was truly disappointed  with this. Very below average kind of dishes. The mochar ghonto even smelled foul. Most of the items were pretty bad  except for the sahebi ilish which was a tad better than the others. Personally I would recommend other restaurants for better Bengali cuisine. However the ambiance is pretty good.

This place has served up good Bengali fare for a while now and the decor is pretty nice as well. Service at times is a bit slow during rush hours but otherwise its a good option for when you want to eat the delicious cuisine of our state. 
We started with the fish fry and chingrir cutlet both of which are good options. We also ordered bhekti gondhoraj , daab chingri and kosha mangsho along with steamed rice , luchi and cholar dal . Personally I loved the flavours of the bhakti gondhoraj. I have had better kosha mangsho in other eateries though as the mutton was a tad hard. Our meal ended with Mishti  Doi which was very nice. I look forward to going back and trying out the Eelish Pulao which is something I have not tried before!

Went there last Sunday night. Seems there was a huge rush last Sunday and lunch was extended till 6PM in the evening. Many of their specialties were not available. Here is what we ordered.
(1) Hasher dimer devil   (2) Rice    (3) Polao    (4) Luchi 
(5) Daab chingri.          (6) Kasha Murgi     (7) Mutton Kasha    (8) Mutton Korma
(9) Malai chicken         (10) Daab sharbat

Hasher dimer devil, Daab chingri and mutton kasha tasted excellant. Would highly recommend these.
Malai chicken, Kasha Murgi and Polao were average taste (would not classify them as exceptional in taste)
I was especially disappointed with Mutton Korma which was not good and the mutton was tough (should have been cooked better). Also, daab sharbat seemed to be simple daab water (no where near the exceptional taste you get from Paramount's daab sharbat).

Overall, I had mixed feedback. 
Taste : Some items are very good, some average and some just not upto the mark
Ambiance : Good. You get an old kolkata feel
Service: Good (but may be improved).

True experience of Bengali food and culture at Tero Parbon
4 out of 5

A few weeks back, at a weekend outing, we dropped in to Tero Parbon, situated at Purna Das Road near Hindustan Park. We don't frequent restaurants that serve Bengali cuisine very often but try to visit different places every time to get a different feel. 

Yes, they serve the same preparations as other restaurants in the city, but taste and other culinary factors (including the visual representation of each dish) vary a lot, and to experience such wonderful culinary art, one must visit restaurants like Tero Parbon to experience Bengali culture and food more intricately. 

As we entered the place, the ambience really vibed with me. The place was so simple yet so wonderful, delivering a homely feel.  The interior decor and arrangement of dining tables and chairs resemble a Bengali house where all the family members of a large joint family would sit together at least once a day to have their meal. Everything here was so homely that not once did I feel that I was sitting in a restaurant.

Their service was quite fast and helpful. Now let's talk about the food! There's only one word I would use to describe all their preparations - 'Excellent!' Like with usual Bengali thalis, we started with white rice, shukto, echorer dalna, koraisuti dhokar dalna and mochar ghonto. With Bengali thalis, these items generally serve as appetizers. These were followed by macher moong dal with hanser dimer devil (for non-vegeterians) and cholar dal with mochar chop (for vegetarians). 

With Bengali food, the dal appears as an intermediate item between appetizers and the main course. In true Bengali culinary tradition, our main course included daab chingri, bhetki gondhoraj, ilish macher paturi, kakrar jhal, and chanar kalia (for vegeterians). This huge lunch party finally came to an end with aamer chutney, rabri and malpua as a grand Bengali thali can never come to an end without misthi (dessert). 

Every one of us relished each of their items. Even if you don't try the other dishes, order their koraisuti dhokar dalna, mochar ghonto and bhetki gondhoraj. You will surely love them. And when it comes to paying the bill, you will be equally pleased as it is very well priced as well. Overall, Tero Parbon won my heart and I want to come back here again. 

For non-Bengalis who want to stimulate their taste buds with the real flavors of Bengali cuisine, I give a big thumbs up to Tero Parbon!

I'm very sorry to say this place did disappoint me to a large extent. Maybe because of the hype, I visited with a lot of expectations and in the end came out with a sorry face as I was treating some of my friends from Mumbai and had been trying to promote Bengali-food to them.

Tero Parbon is a celebration of food, culture and lifestyle of Bengal. You get to dine in a charismatic interior created to provide a Bengali heritage feel. 
For fish lovers there are more than one can cover in few days and the hangover of the food will remain forever. Just try Ilish Bhapey, Daab Chingri, Posto Chicken, Radhabollobi, Prawn Kobiraji and you will agree with me. Tero Parbon is a delight in actual sense of the term.It is said that Bengali culture has more festivals than months in the calendar, and any Bengali you meet will opine that festivities and feasting go hand in hand. And if you want to feast, Tero Parbon is the best place... for both Bengalis and non-Bengalis. Chingri Malai Curry, Prawn Kabiraji, Chitol Machher Peti, Posto Chicken and Malai Pomfret are strongly recommended. End your meal with the delicious Mishti Doi. Mind you, these are just a few samples of their exciting menu. Their quintessential Bengali specialities will double the fun element of your meal, and significance of the celebrations.

I visited the place today and it was quite a poor experience. Though it was Poila Boisakh and for that there was a heavy customer load but even at the late afternoon hours when the crowd was thinning, the service remained terribly poor. It was beyond a typical test for patience from placing the order until the food was being served.And then each time we felt need to order something more we had to call the waiter attending our table at least thrice. Coming to the food, I must say quality and quantity both are compromised.Rice is getting served in bowls suitable for desserts. Cholar daal lacking accessories, other veg dishes not delectable, Pulao average, Fish Fry almost comparable to local cabins, Fish Orly and  Ilish'er jhal were good. Chicken Curry containing 2 medium and 2 small completely boney pieces. Lastly in  desserts there was nothing available except Rabri and Rasogolla. We opt for Rabri and it was average. I must say modern urban Bengali people and their soft corner for traditional Bengali cuisine are simply getting exploited while dining at some place where 4 small cubes of Dhoka immersed in simple curry costs Rs. 130, street quality Fish Fry costs 100 and a small bowl of plain Dal costs Rs. 70. This restaurant is charging like reputed ones but serving something far below their standard in terms of both quantity and quality.

In Kolkata we find that restaurants serving bengali cuisines are coming up here and there. This place has been there for more than 6 years. Initially it used to serve very nice food, however presently its quality of food has deteriorated drastically! Kolkatans would visit a place to have bengali food only if it is extraordinary! And people visiting from outside should definitely not dine somewhere which will ill-repute bengali cuisine! Nicely decorated place, with ample seating places. Service is swift! But their food is terrible. 
 Their fish curries are typical, nothing great, their posto is pretty bad most of the times, there is no consistency with food quality and quantity, and most dishes taste the same! 
I would really suggest people not to dine here, unless absolutely unavoidable. The quality of food is disgraceful!

When Bengalis crave for delicasies such as: Mochar Ghonto, Chholar Daal, Ilish Maachh, Katla Maachher Kalia, begun Bhaja, and dozen other typical Bengali items, must try our here at Tero Parbon, located at the posh Purna Das Road of Ballygunge area.

I have dined here a few times and found it very good for money.  

My only suggestion to the Manager is to improve the decor, wash basins, lightings inside the restaurant.

I went to this restaurant with my family for lunch today. The experience was really nice.

For starters, we had ordered Fish Roll and Chicken Cutlet. The Fish Roll was delicious, while the Chicken Cutlet was okayish

We then ordered Pulao, Pabda Rosha, Malai Murgh, Sobuj Bhapa Bhetki and Gondhoraj Mutton.

The Malai Murgh and Gondhoraj Mutton were really mouth-watering, while the Bhetki preparation was equally delicious.

But, the Pabda preparation was not up-to-the-mark.

We finished it off with Nolen Gurer Ice-cream, which was just out-of-the-world.

Only drawback is it takes a while for the service to start.

Honestly this place is nothing great. There are way better eateries specializing in Bengali food. It is situated at Hindustan park is which easy to find and quite convenient for people living in South Kolkata. The food is nice but not delicious and definitely not something like irresistible. The 'Chingry Malai Curry' is quite tasty and 'Mutton Kosha' is nice but others not that interesting. 
The pricing is reasonable so you can try having food here atleast once it won't be a bad option. 
Giving it 3 I think will be fair enough.

I've never been to the restaurant, but my father has. He brought home a plate of Kosha Mangsho for me. It wasn't too, bad, and I kept breaking off bits of meat to have then.

All was well until I found,a baby cockroach, warmly ensconced in the mutton, dead and stewed. I feel like throwing up and I'm definitely never returning to a restaurant whose kitchen stores cockroaches. I rate it a one star.

I've been there few months back. Its located near Hindustan Park.

Ambience is mediocre, staff is well-behaved and service is slightly slow. Food quality is simply lip-smacking. Kasha Mangsho is a must try, Malai Murgi is great too. Amer Chatni is sweet and nice. Pomfret Mach Jhal is my all time favourite with plain rice. Chingri Malai Curry is mouthwatering. Prices are affordable. 


Please visit. i would rate 3.5 for Tero Parbon.

Daab sharbat
Haansher Dimer devil.. ( duck eggs.. devilled) 
Rui Bhaja 
Kosha mangsho 
Steamed Rice

all the food was brilliant... especially the eggs... i was compelled to order another portion... 

the staff was warm and friendly ... and the paan served at the end was fresh and crisp... 

over all .... a fantastic meal.... looking forward to the next visit soon..

Another Fantastic meal at the Tero Parbon outlet ..... A friend was here from abroad and wanted a bengali meal and i have told so many people about the hasher dimer devil that we went there only 

the menu

Rui Bhaja 
Mochar Chop 
Bhetki Monohara 
Aam Pora Shorbot 
Pineapple Chutney

A premier Bengali restaurant Tero Parbon is on Purna Das Road, situated between Gol Park and Triangular Park. During my recent visits to this restaurant I had tried various dishes here. In one visit I have tried Mocha (Banana flower) Chingri and Doi Ilish. Both were very authentic and tasty. The Doi Ilish is a special favorite of mine, which is basically Hilsa fish cooked in curd and ghee.

Another favorite of mine in this restaurant is Hanser Dimer Dalna (Duck egg gravy in Bengali style). This is a must have.

On one special occasion they had a buffet. The menu included Koraishutir Kochuri, Chholar dal, Fish Orly, Sukto, bhat, pulao, padba shorshe, Kosha Mangsho and chingri machher malaikari. I loved the malaikari and the mangsho preparation. 

Among the sweets that they serve my favorite is Nolen Gurer Rosogolla.

Service is average to below average - even in an empty restaurant I have had to call out for service. The waiters are mostly busy chatting among themselves than attending to customers.

Food: 4/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 4/5

The ambience is ok,service is irritatingly slow.Many items remain unavailable.For a restaurant that markets itself for bengali cuisine,it really makes pretty distasteful fish dishes.Seriously the roadside restaurants would serve a better rui kalia. Chitol macher muitha disappointmented me,they managed to make macher matha die dal tasty enough.The veg dishes alu posto and dhokar dalna was not bad.
But seriously if you can manage the time call up your elders,get the reciepe to cook and enjoy your bengali meal at home.
A non-bengali who wants to try out bengali food should avoid this place,because this comes no-way close to good,wholesome bengali cuisine.

We had visited this restaurant today for the first time. Ambience is decent with a lot of space among tables. The high ceiling amplifies this feeling. The staff is slow and needs to demonstrate more energy. Food is ok though a lot of items on the menu are not available. Pathuri and pomfret was fresh and good. Postor bora was a disaster and a strict no no. Portion sizes are small which is good. No diet beverages or juices, only colas or  aam panna. Better to go early as the serving team loses the plot once there is a crowd.

I went there once and won't go back in a hurry. The decor was OK but the food was really bad. Fish Fry took 40 minutes to arrive. The Chingri in the mocha-chingri had a smell it shouldn't have (the restaurant was gracious enough not to charge us for that). The Bhetki Paturi wasn't great. The Ilish-Bhapa was just alright and the Daab-Chingri was bland and tasteless. The Rabri I ordered was pretty ordinary too. The prices are on the higher side but the flavours were totally sub-par. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.

The quality & quantity of food served is not at par with the high price tag.

we tasted 'Eelish Bhapa' in their much advertised "Eelish-chingri utsab" -- absolutely no flavour of hilsa. 'Prawn Malaikari' tasted bland. "Eelish kochusaak" also didnt have any flavours of the hilsa.

dont know how can they charge so much for food items which are below average taste wise.
I DEFINITELY WONT RECOMMEND...!

I am a often diner at this place. I wont say it is a complete 'value for money' place for the foodies who look out for economical Bengali cuisine in the city. 

The food is good but not that great. I would term it 'subtle' - perfect for elder people, who are mostly seen at this place. The staff needs to be more energetic and professional. The best part of the place is - its ambiance and space which I think is very important for diners.

Little annoying experience was, in-spite of a wide range of items mentioned in the menu, the diners do not get it all. 

Overall, a good option for elders, but sadly overpriced.

Overpriced, mediocre service (they don't clear the table after a course, or change dishes), poorly maintained crockery and cutlery, the seating arrangements are ill planned, since if you're with your family you get the family table next the door and the counter where all the waiters and other staff gather to chat. The quality of the food does not match the menu - several items are unavailable so it might be better to ring up first and find out if they will be serving a particular dish. The dishes take a long time to emerge from the kitchen, so you have to either strive to prolong the starters or the conversation. It seems to me that this place has great prospects given its location and cuisine it purportedly offers, and it could be changed into a fantastic foodie destination with effective management

Ambience is ok.But the prices are very high compared to the quantity. The fishes served most of times are rotten, or very poor in quality.Prawns are not cleaned properly.All the non veg gravies taste similar.arundhati

I have been to this place 2 to 3 times. Each time I was satisfied with the service. Though I must say that the prices are a little high than the quality of the food. Also the availability of few dishes is really uncertain.

The decor is very nice, it will give you a feeling as if you have entered a traditional Bengali house. 

It is here I have first tasted 'Nolen gurer ice cream' and it has became my favourite dessert.

too overpriced for the quality and quantity they serve. there are better places for bengali cuisine if you are ready to spend that much. the chitol items are strict no. only good if you want to taste a regular bengali meal in a hurry. overall not at all a recommended place for a dine out

A little expensive, but great great food. Love the cheetal fish preparations. Not so fond of the prawn cutlets. And the mishti paan they give after meals just melts inside the mouth.

Authentic Bengali dishes, fairly good. The best part is that they serve small portions so one can order quite a large number of dishes according to their taste or according to what you want to taste.
The restaurant itself is quite nice with good sober decor.

The worst bengali restaurant in south Kolkata. half of the menu is not available. We waited nearly 20 minutes before the waiter came to our table for serving water....to add to our anguish the waiter brought different food and when asked said "Sorry, this is meant for different table!"

The cuisine is bland. just oil and water. nothing else.
The dessert that I read good review was not available as the waiter said "we dont have it right now"

Go to this place if you want to burn your money.   Third class dhaba...thats what it is (with AC and music)

Nalen Gurer Ice cream must try!!! Aam doi also great. You should try to organize more 'traditional festivals' like Ilish(Bengali fish delicacy, for those trying the Bengali cuisines). Bengali cuisine is beautiful and has great variety in Non-veg and veg categories, So, if you organize 'traditonal food fests', it will be a good showcase for  those new to Bengali cuisines. You can make better profits this way, but, to sustain you need to bring in some more innonvative dishes(tradional remixed with modern tastes"(may be experiment with other flavors, keeping the base/heart of the recipe- Bengali)
 Try to include some rare Bengali dishes which are not available in other similar restaurants. Hopefully, with the new profits, you can increase the food QUANTITIES AS WELL....yipeee!!!

Both the decor and ambience are good. Staff are polite and well-behaved, too. But the service should be a bit quicker. The gravy must be a lot more tastier. Otherwise it may have a devastating effect on most of the traditional items. There should be veg versions of dishes like "potoler dolma". "Nalen guder ice-cream" is quite a sensation !!! Like to visit again.
