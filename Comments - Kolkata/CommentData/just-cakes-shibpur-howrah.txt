Excellent quality and customer service. A total value for money. Took my chances with a newbie ordering a personalized baby shower cake and it paid off quite well. No complaints only complements.

Where do I begin…….

I found you on the internet and I took a chance on ordering your cake from the beautiful cake gallery and the customer appreciation comments from Zomato and I was not disappointed at all. I had NO personal recommendations I just
stepped out on faith and we were overwhelmed by how delicious your cake turned out to be.

I want to thank you for your absolutely GORGEOUS cake!! Not only was it a sight to behold,
it was Amazingly DELICIOUS. We couldn’t get over how pristine looking baby and his toys looked. Exactly what I had envisioned and beautifully executed! 

Your baking skills are outstanding, 

The artistry of your design was phenomenal. Everyone complimented on the fondant.
You were very creative, improvised and made it look absolutely beautiful.

You are a true professional and I couldn’t be more pleased. Thank you for your talent,
hard work and dedication to make my nephew's birthday day a special one.

I ordered two chocolate truffle Vegan cakes for Christmas. This was the third time that we were tasting vegan cakes and all three were from “Just Cakes”! The cakes were beautifully baked, soft and fresh, delicious and lasted a couple of days too! They were loved by both young and old family members alike. I recommend them highly. They have an amazing variety of options and the young owner Tulika, deserves appreciation for her talent in bakery as well as for her on-time delivery service. She maintains constant touch, communicating over phone, whatsApp, till actual delivery.
All the best to Tulika and her team! Keep up the good work girl!

It was from my friend Saikat Jotdar that I first came to know of Just Cakes and ordered my first. All who had the couple of cakes (both for birthday, one for a child and another for an adult) much appreciated the taste and design and moreover, this was their first vegan cake. The two cakes were consumed by 17 people, the youngest 9 and the oldest 90 and I am sure all these individuals will start ordering at Just Cakes in no time. Thank you so much Saikat.Thank you Tulika and her team.

I confirmed my order of one rainbow dream and cupcakes around 9.30 pm and she assured of delivering the same in the morning itself! True to her words she did and the whole experience was smooth and amazing! The decoration, the taste and everything else was superb! Kudos to you guys! Keep up the good work!

"Excellent" in one word. 

It was my sister's birthday and I ordered for a Barbie cake. Miss Tulika helped in customizing the cake as per my requirement. 

The cake was very soft, tasty and looked amazing.  
My sister was very happy by just looking at the cake. That was all me and my parents wanted, a smile on her face on her birthday.
It was like a birthday gift :).

Thanks Tulika. I would like to try more cakes (varieties) and other baked items in future. Also would introduce you to my sister.

Keep up the good work!

Perfect Choice! I ordered a customized cake for my friend as a birthday gift and I must say I was not at all disappointed :) The cake looked almost the same as the design was provided by me . The delivery was almost on time in-spite of heavy rainfall on that day for which I was a bit tensed ! The cake was so fresh and creamilicious and so much good in taste and the chocochips inside were a bonus which added more to it! Over all a very nice experience. Thanks Just Cakes <3
