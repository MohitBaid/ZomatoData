This small eatery is situated right next to the katjunagar math and they sell some really tasty pork dishes. 
It is not a good idea to sit and have food from here as the smoke coming out from the kitchen can burn ur eyes. 

It is a small eatery which can accomodate 4-5 people,  hence swiggy comes handy in this case.  
For food. I mostly order their 
CHILLI PORK
CHILLI CHICKEN 
MOMOS AND
FRIED RICE. 
The chilli pork is extremely tasty but they serve too many fat pieces so its better to tell them to serve more meat less fat.  If not specified,  they serve 50% fat over there. 

The momos r really tasty,  juicy and worth the price. 

They sell good food acc to the price and is very pocket friendly for college goers like us.

A very small Tibetan and Chinese outlet in Jadavpur area. This eatery serves quality food like momos, Chinese Chicken preparations, pork and some Tibetan delights. The price is reasonable and is thronged by mostly young college crowd.

I'm a REGULAR customer of this joint. Reasons : pocket friendly and exotic taste

This place is one of the best budget yet tasty joints in the entire city. I'm always in the lookout for cheap tibetian/chinese/nepali food joints and this is one place where 'every dish has it's unique flavour'. Other nearby and competing restaurants degraded within a couple of years...but not this. The choice of dishes is exciting, the chef (especially Dipak) and staff are very friendly. Only downside is the cramped space and long waiting time! Other than these.. this is my 2nd favourite joint after Territy Bazar.

I was badly craving for Chinese food and it's the end of the month. So the food rates are quite cheap here.
I ordered  veg schezwan fried rice and chicken manchurian.
The quantity is enough for 2 people.
The delivery was also quick.
Now coming to the taste..
The fried rice tasted good but was too much oily.
The chicken pieces were made big by the outside stuffing and it almost tasted like garlic chicken rather than manchurian.
All in all, I am not totally satisfied but if you are short on money I would recommend this place.

We ordered CHILI GARLIC PORK CHOW and PORK THUKPA.The chili garlic pork chow was average but the quantity of chow was enough for one person,the pork pieces were pretty good.The chunks were tender.But the pork thukpa was pretty delicious,it wasn't rich at all,the pork slices were very juicy and tender and pork tasted great with the noodle and the veggies.The soup was very light.Over all the food was average but the quantity and the quality were pretty good. If you're an avid pork lover then try out the pork delicacies.

Ordered the Caribbean Drumsticks for 130 bucks.
The pocket pinch for this place is just right for college students.
The drumsticks were perfectly cooked. They were both crispy and saucy. Also the bell peppers and the onions added to the dish and gave it a nice crunch.
Overall the dish was flavourful and was on the less spicier side.

Very small place so best to do a takeaway or home delivery. But oh boy, they make wonderful momos and thukpas at an unbelievable price. The momos come with soup too thereby making it unbeatable. 
The price list here is outdated. Just add Rs 10 to most of them published here.
I will try out their remaining stuff and offcourse, continue to gorge on the momos and thukpas.
Btw, no veg momo is available.

I have ordered food from this eatery via swiggy a lot many times. The price is reasonable and tastewise it's good too for the amount charged. Very recently I think the quality is a bit compromised that's the only fall back I have noticed. It's good enough for a quick bite rather than a full course meal. If the quality doesn't deteriorate any further its one of the most economic place serving good fast food .

This place serves decent Chinese food and is especially apt for those on a shoestring budget. Do not expect something out of the ordinary, but you do get good value for the money that you pay. Quantity of the food items served is good. Taste is decent. What more can one look forward to, considering what one ends up paying? Chilli Chicken is worth mentioning as well as the Fried Rice.

I wanted to order a Chinese meal for my family within a  reasonable amount and I went ahead with China green as the menu looked alright to me. Little did I know that this would result in stomach upset compromising their health. I mean this amazes me how can people take such profession and play with people's health. I feel so terrible to order something for my family which resulted in their I'll health. Not only is my money wasted but Also I have this huge guilt of playing with my family's health.
As a person who definitely thinks that their health should be a priority please think twice before ordering food from this place.

This is perhaps the most pocket friendly place to satisfy sudden hunger pangs at odd hours. At very low prices you get delicious chinese and other fast foods. This time they took a while to get our food. Nevertheless the egg hakka chowmin and chicken hakka chowmin were delectable. Earlier I have had babycorn too from here. Gonna order again and again from this place whenever I want to go yum on taste and light on pockets. :)

Highly disappointed with the food they delivered. It was featured on the hidden gem collection. So, I thought of ordering their house speciality, chicken shyphala. 
First it was delivered late, I had to constantly contact Zomato to follow up my order. Second, the food was served cold. Third, if that's what shyphala is, then I'm sorry, you should name it garlic chicken. Fourth, they served so less for 130 bucks, that I was confused whether I ordered half or full. Lastly, the chicken strips were hard, I don't know what they actually made out of my order.
Maybe people should stick to their pork platters, Momos or chowmein. I'm never gonna order from this place.

China green is the best to quench all your cravings less than your budget. They quantity is amazing,from momos to chowmein , it can easily fill anybody's hungry stomach. One thing you should note that they do not serve 8 pieces of chicken for 80 as printed on the menu. The pan fried momos are a must try.

This is a 'blink-and-a-miss' opportunity to actually spot this restaurant... It's more of a narrow eatery that serves pretty good Chinese at a reasonable price. There's not much of an ambience. Other than a bunch of students or a couple of friends, the rest would prefer takeaway. 
However, coming to the food, their steam momos are terrific! Be sure to give them a try ,along with the roast chilli pork. However one day I had parcelled a mixed gravy noodles, where they did not separate the gravy from the noodles while packing. Neither was their any pack of sauces or vinegar. It was a horrible experience. 
Overall it's a nice place for a quick grub at a reasonable price. Stick to momos and the chilli pork!

A 'very' small food joint in Jadavpur serving good Tibetan and Chinese food . 

So last month it was one of my friend's birthday and he was going to give us a treat . After reaching at that place the first thing which felt awkward was how small it is , it seems like it was saloon which has been turned to food joint .

Now coming to the food , we ordered Shyaptas and Phales and the lip smacking Caribbean drumsticks . They were seriously awesome guys . A must try . The food was enough to remove all those negative ideas of that small place .

I would not stop myself from going once more . üòä

I have to say they were quite generous with the amount. I liked the Chilli Pork a lot. The sauce was delicious. The flesh pieces were a tad bit overcooked. In Schezwan pork, the meat pieces were undercooked and the Schezwan Sauce was spicy and sweet. This eatery is recommended if you want to have Pork and on a tight budget.

Tried chicken drumstick, chicken fried rice along with sechzwan chicken. Regarding the price the quality and quantity they serve is good enough. Nothing to say about the ambiance as we opted for takeaway. The service is a bit slow. Can give it a try once when you are running low on pocket.

There's not much sitting arrangement.Most of the people opt for take-away.I decided to have a quick lunch here today after work.So I sat in the stool and ordered for a chicken hakka noodles(half) and schezuan pork(dry).I actually wanted a plate of steamed momo and shyaphaale.But they said it'll take time.Since I had a hungry stomach I opted for things that'll be served fast.

‚Ä¢Chicken hakka noodles-It was good.Amount of chicken was ample.Portion of half noodles was big even for one person.I couldn't complete it.Also it was oily.But it's very good given the nominal price tag to the dish and the fact that taste was there.

Schezuan pork- Loved it totally! Big chunks of pork are given here instead of slices that we are used to.But there was no stiffness at all.Yummy pork fat was present in correct amount.The sauce it was cooked in was spicy with a hint of sweetness in it.Any pork meat lover will go gaga over this!

Price is very very cheap.Will visit here many more times for the Tibetan snacks they serve!

Have had food from here twice. One of the places where you can get pork. Got a pork chilli and friend rice for the first time. Great quantity and good taste. But they can add a little bit good pieces of the pork other than the fatty ones only. The pork thukpa is more a veg soup than pork one because it only has pork fat and nothing else of pork. But quantity is good  again. Price is quite cheap. Look forward to taste the pork dishes.

Not your usual place to hang out, could have been better with more spacious accommodation. The food here is comparable to that of an overpriced Zyka, yes it's that good! Looking forward to visiting the place soon with my beloved Trisha Das. Here is an image of the chilli pork with half plates of chicken haka noodles (yes quantity's good too)

When ever i see pork on the menu .. i am drawn to it like a Moth to  a flame ... and when the price for chili pork  or any pork preparation reads rs 110 for a full plate .. i am like a moth on a hundred cans of red bull heading towards Pompeii at rocket speed .. it was no different in this case .. The location is easy but also

a little tricky if you are not familiar with the nooks and crannies and golis and the galas out jadvpur , bikramgarh or bijoygarh  well all of them fall opposite to south city when we generalize ..  Well the

shop is a small cozy place .. small enough to be missed in the blink of an eye if you are not paying 

attention that small ..Now coming to the food .. i ordered one helping of chili pork (dry) one helping of Manchurian pork (dry) and a helping of Chicken Jamaican drumsticks . You are probably wondering with

whats with Dry orders are they some drought worshiping cultists or what?? well i am not .. me and my

friends just like to welcome the old monk weather on the weekends with some well spiced not so 

gravylicious meats or in most cases mystery  meats.. Now for the taste .. they chili pork was on point

generously spiced  suited my taste buds but for normal guests i would suggest them to ask them to

tone it down a little .. The Manchurian pork .. had a good amount of fat in it .. but it outdid it self

on the taste department .. while the chili pork also scored high on the quantity department the

latter failed to do so .. but as i said it ranked high on taste ... The Jamaican Drumstick on other hand

had no relation whatsoever to Chris gayle , Bob Marley or the letter J from Jamaica ... It was just

a batter dipped chicken on bone deep fried then pan fried with the exact same sauce they pan fry

momos in but with eye popping amount of red chilies .. which i think really made the difference

it tasted decent i mean better than decent not chalta hain types but above that .. i have to words

to describe this feeling .. Over all it was a satisfying experience .. worth the dough you will end up

spending there ... I like the ambiance or what ever the place the size of harry potters closet room

in privet drive  has .. But i wont be sitting down and eating over there .. its strictly a delivery and 

take away place for me .. Good Service Good Staff Good Food Good Value for Money .. that is i guess

all you need to concoct a cult food joint in the making .. and china green has all of them ... i hope they

stay on path and do not divert from it .. looking forward to ordering more from this place.

I tried ordering from this place....Katjunagar is not very far from Ganguli Pukur....and as per order online option in Zomato it seems that my GPS location falls under their delivery service zone however when I called I was informed they do not deliver here....I accepted without any further altercation as to what they said but informed the guy on the phone with me that they should update this information on Zomato as well otherwise more customers would be misguided....the conversation went birsirk post this and I do not know what exactly i said that seemed so wrong to this person on phone....instead if accepting and acknowledging that yes this needs to be updated he started giving weird explanations unwilling to even consider what has been advised/informed.....weird n bad experience on just a conversation.....their food may be exceptional but behaviour is the worst...they are at the end of the day a part of customer service and this kind of experience leaves no will to fetch their service at all....leave aside not using it i will not even suggest this place....I'd rather settle for a lil lesser tasty food with good service rather than this....end of the day....they do not just sell food....its the whole service we pay for.....period

If someone cares only about food and not the ambience, then China Green can make them more than happy. This place is located near Katjunagar and if you follow the Jadavpur- Tollygaunge auto route, then this place will fall om your right hand side. They have a table attached to the wall and some stools to sit on. This place is certainly not for any kind of dine in.
We were hungry and ordered chicken hakka noodles. Quality of food was really very good. Unlike any other roadside eatery, they serves authentic Chinese dishes. Quantity of food, keeping the price in mind, was more than good.
Overall it's a place for hungry souls like us who will not notice anything but food
Will surely comeback soon for their other dishes.

China Green is a hidden gem in its true sense. The outer appearance wouldn't make you look back twice at it but if you do steal a glance and also move on to step inside, I can assure you that there would be no regrets later on.

He suggested this place for quenching our evening hunger pangs and we found ourselves here in no time. This pocket sized restaurant is kept pretty spick and span with a long narrow table and some stools to be seated on.
A full dry chili pork and chicken hakka noodles made up our order.
The quantity is overtly generous given the nominal prices they charge for the dishes. A plate was heaped up with some nicely stir fried noodles with an ample amount of veggies and chicken strips and it had a rather pleasant smoky flavour. The pork, cooked in a lot of soy sauce, onions and capsicum was extremely flavorsome. It had loads of fat and the meat was tender enough to chew on.

People who tend to avoid oily food should keep away, but this place is a must try for all the pork lovers out there! :)

Came here recently and tried out the hot garlic pork with veg noodles. Like the last time, the quantity was immense and the taste lip smacking. Specifically, I loved the hot garlic gravy. With just the right amount of sweetness and a lot of garlic flavour, it won my heart.

So one evening we went ahead and gave this place a shot based on the high ratings on zomato. As it turned out this place is indeed a marvel. Dont judge a book by its cover. It looks a bit shabby and not so catchy but trust me the food is superb. Chilli pork contained sufficient pieces of pork along with soft fat cooked just the way it should be. We also tried thukpa and momo. The quantity they serve is almost for two people. Really affordable, good behavior and they have some decorations and graffiti too. I cannot wait to try more of their food.

This place is located just beside "katjunagar ground". Take an auto from Jadavpur 8B and get down at katjunagar ground, and u'll see this place.

Well, I asked the guy for a menu card he told me to go and see the menu "chart" hanging outside cuz the menu cards r not updated.

This is definitely not a place to dine in and I wont go into  the decor and stuff. It has one long plank(table) attached to the wall and stools.

Now the food. I obviously came here cuz my pockets were shallow and I was craving for some pork.

We had chili pork dry, schezuan pork dry and chicken momos.

The schezuan pork was kind of sweet and tangy and not that spicy. The sauce was amazing. Adequate amount of pork was served for the price (‚Çπ110). It was really good.

Chilli pork was also good but it was more of a soy and hot sauce combination and doused in chillies.(‚Çπ110)

And the chicken momos were pretty decent for the price u pay (‚Çπ35). Good stuff. Highly recommended if u don't care about ambience, decor and stuff like that. Good food at low price. Period.

Great place and awesome food....at damn cheap prices..I ate the Caribbean Drumsticks and Chicken momos. Firstly, the place is good for hangout with friends. secondly, they were fast to serve and the chicken was just Yummy!!!!. The soup which comes with Momos, is very different yet very tasty. I suggest all Momo lovers to try this place and I must say it is much better than many Tibetan food hyped places in the nearby areas.

Porkilicious food available here. :')
The soft and fatty pork (just as I like it) both in Fried Rice and Chilly Pork was amazing. If you are on a tight budget but is craving for a porky meal, this is the place to be.¬†
Caution: Not a place to satisfy the classy restaurant feel may be but definitely will satiate the foodie in you. Strongly recommended to all those who are hunting out cheap but good food places. Will be back there soon!

Small, lesser known places are always exciting. First came to 'Flavours of Tibet', now 'China Green' on Nicole's insistence. Love the pork, LOVE. Been here for too many times to count now. Will keep coming, for the pork, the momos, the shyapta, the rice.

When you're poor and ravenous, this is the place to go. Located near the Emmanuel School in Bijoygarh, this place is so tiny that if you blink, you miss it. Despite the teeny interior, it is clean and neat.

The staff is polite and friendly and the menu is your typical Chinese and Tibtan comfort food. From the moment you enter till the time you leave, you will feel the fresh air of mountains surround you and you will be in your happy place. On the outside, this place comes off as a little shabby, but if your get over your inhibitions you will be delighted.

We had ordered three different rice dishes - Schezwan rice with chicken, Plain fried rice with eggs and Pork fried rice. And three different side dishes - Chilli Chicken, Chilli Pork and Schezwan Chicken. And like five bottles of cold drinks. The food was AMAZING. Very "puronow deener Chinese" flavour. The pork was so so so good. We finished our food in 15 minutes flat.

And we were shocked, pleasantly, when the bill arrived, because w e had to pay all of 150 each for the ginormous amount of food that we had gobbled up.

Honestly, this little place is the love of my life and it's better than my college canteens. :3 So please leave behind all your inhibitions and do do do visit this place.

~~This is my best find of this month~~
Located very close to JU/8B bus stand. Near the field and Emanuelle school on the Tolly-Jadavpur auto route.

~~People seeking fine dining should avoid this joint. Ideal for hungry souls on a tight budget. Sitting arrangement is clumsy and not too appealing. They also do home delivery which if possible, will be a better option.~~

~~The food is D for DELICIOUS. Famed for the pork dishes and rightly so, China Green has won my heart. Unbelievably economic, generous quantity, and delectable taste, it is a complete package. ~~

~~People looking for an affordable lunch/dinner destination on a tight budget, this is the place to go.~~

Excellent pork dishes at very affordable prices. A little cramped for space when there's a crowd, but that's manageable. Place is very close to 8B bus stand and that's an added bonus as well.

This small nook is located very close to the 8b bus stand. The momos and the fried rice are amazing! And unlike the denzong in golf green, people actually wore clothes while serving us and we're very courteous. This place is cheap and tight but most importantly it maintains its quality of food. For someone who has less than 200 bucks in their pocket, they can easily have at least two plates of momos with a cold drink and still have enough money to go back home. One of the most underrated places I have gone to. I LOVED IT!

We stumbled upon this eatery on our way to Tollygunge. A very tiny tibetan-run kiosk serving tibetan and chinese food. The first day we had lunch here, we ordered the Chicken Fried Rice and the Chilli Pork. The fried rice was ordinary but what blew our mind was the pork. Perfectly succulent, fatty pieces of pork with a thin, crispy coating..YUM! We also tried the Szechuan Pork at one point but weren't really impressed with it; it tasted like 'achaar' a bit. The phaleys here are huge! And at dirt-cheap prices. You get a chicken phaley at 20 bucks. Two should be enough to satisfy your hunger pangs for some time. The momos are good too but me being extremely picky about my momos, would like them to be a tad juicier.
This place is not, I repeat, NOT for the health-conscious and hygiene-freaks. They have a tiny little sitting area that's just adjacent to the kitchen, and all the smoke coming out can make you very uncomfortable at times, so if you live close by, I'd suggest you to go for take-out.

Pocket friendly and dirt cheap pricing, the momos and phaleys they make at this place will have you coming back for more. If tibetian is really not up your alley try their chinese. We had noodles and chilli chicken and loved it just as much. Beware though, the space is a bit cramped but to expect anything else at such prices is being optimistic to a fault
