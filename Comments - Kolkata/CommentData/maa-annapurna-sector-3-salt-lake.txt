I ordered for rajma masala......the taste was not good.....the prices are exorbitant.....a small portion of rajma is for Rs.60/-.....when spoke to a lady for the quantity....I was told that quantity is good enough.....the service is bad....

In one word it is too good.

Today I ordered for a home delivery from this restaurant as per suggestion from my wife.

I ordered Butter roti and Alu daam. Butter Roti was awesome.it come in a pack of 4 pcs.

But personally I liked Aloo dum the most.Maa ka haat ka khana yaad aagaya.that tender smell of masala with melting aloo.

the rate is very minimal.if you are not willing to cook and want authentic north indian vegetarian food , guys go for it.you will love it.

Ordered Rajasthani Thaali via Zomato. The Butter Paneer only had salt in it and was tasteless, the Bhatura was raw but the Chola was good, the aloo  and jeera rice were average, only papad and raita were good. Not recommended at all.
