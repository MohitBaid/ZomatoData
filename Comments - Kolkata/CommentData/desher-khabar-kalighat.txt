This sweets shop is the landmark of Chetla mor and has been there since ages. Nothing much has been upgraded here and they continue to prepare the old school favourites. Though the quality there has dropped seriously. Still I like their singaras and kochuri-tarkari and their rosogollas (of every kind) are really good. Pantuas are good too if you have it fresh, so are chomchoms. I wish they were more attentive to the quality of their fare.

As someone who has grown up on sweets and samosas from here I accept to be completely biased towards this place. They have the yummiest samosas or should I say shingara, since it's the proper Bengali aloo affair ( during winters cauliflower makes an appearance too) this gets sold out within an hour or two from when they fry it in the evening. 
The kachoori sabzi is amazing and one those things that we would get on Sundays when mom was too busy to make lucchis. 
Among the misthis, everything is good. My favourite being milk cake; which mom would take to my sister when she was in Bombay. The kacchagola, sandesh, Rosogolla are all fabulous. Their Gujias are the right amount of soft and what we would get on Fridays as shini. Their misthi doi is good as well, though I would suggest going for the small cups. 
Overall if you want a proper Bengali sweet shop this is the place.

One of the oldest sweet shop in the area... Nothing has changed till date... Same dÃ©cor same ambience... Only thing that changed is the quality... Tried their channar jilapi some days ago... It was not fresh at all... Pocket pinch is friendly...

It's located more in the Chetla locality. The Luchi with Aloor Torkari is just so good. I even love the Gurer Rossogolla and Taalshaash Sandesh. They are just so good. Fingers lickin' good. Happy Dining! :)

Days it has been the landmark to my place. The sweetmeat shop is one of a kind and takes pride on its old school process of manufacturing sweets. I love the rosogolla, winters mean nolen gurer er halka paak mishti and nolen gurer rosogolla from DK. I love their makha sandesh. They just need to add more variety in order to survive the cut-throat food industry competition for unique and delicious fare at reasonable prices!

I had the opportunity of tasting their sweets this time during pujo, when I was visiting chetla agrani sangha. The jolbhora was great, exactly like it should be. And we also tried chhanar goja which was again superb. It is a famous shop in the locality and quite a landmark also.

This is a sweet shop that I have been frequenting since last few years, Desher Khabar is a landmark at Chetla and it is extremely prominently located and noticeable. The place still serves as a meeting point for people and still retains the old world charm of ancient orthodox Bengali sweet shops! The place has got the exteriors revamped a bit (like their name board) in last few years, rest everything remains as it is. Though the place sells decent sweets but I would say it has got no trademark item for which it can be termed as famous. It is frequented mainly because of its prominent location and consistent quality.

LOCATION - - - - - The place is located at Chetla right at the corner of a crossing that leads to Chetla Agrani Club (if you take left turn from Desher Khabar). This prominent sweet shop can be reached easily from Rashbehari crossing if you go straight towards Chetla Bridge; just cross the bridge and keep moving (for a few meters) till you find the shop on your left.

AMBIANCE - - - - - The place has got no touch / feel of modern sweet shops and has nothing much to talk about. Sticking to the old structure / furniture and old mosaic flooring surely makes you feel like you are in a time warp, but then it is always good to embrace a change if that change is for good. Ambiance of Desher Khabar today is no match to the ambiance of popular sweet shops like Banchharam, Balaram Mullick or even Kamdhenus, and thatâ€™s not very commendable.  

FOOD - - - - - We usually have Kachori, aloo sabzi and jalebi from this place in the morning hours on Sundays along with some sweets like freshly prepared Sandesh, Rasagolla, Malpua, etc. What I like best from this place is their Rasagolla, infact I believe they prepare the best Rasagollas in the area which are very soft, big, reasonably priced, pleasant to taste and not at all chewy. The freshly prepared Sandesh are also great and you can surely go for them once you are here at this shop. Also the jalebis are good, kachori-sabzi is very average though. Sadly they donâ€™t have any signature sweet dish here. I havenâ€™t tried their Mishti Doi but their Malpuas are good enough and are not too overtly sweet. Overall the sweets taste good, and the standard is maintained more or less all throughout the year.

SERVICE - - - - - Service is prompt and orders are served in proper sequence. Persons at the shop are pleasant order-takers. Needless to mention, only cash is accepted at this place. 

OVERALL - - - - - Now here are some points of concern maybe - sticking to this old ambiance and environment surely is hampering the hygiene factor which is quite evident these days. So renovation and restructuring is required if they want to stay alive in this competitive market and if they want to grow. Innovation of sweets and food items is another stuff which is missing here that should be taken up aggressively. As of today, the place serves nice sweet items at reasonable price but then that only makes them an ordinary sweet shop, nothing more than that. Also since the area has no other better sweet shop, this place still draws loads of crowd. The place can really do well / keep growing in the coming days if the reviews and criticisms are taken positively and worked upon.

Cheers!

One of the oldest & best sweet shops in Chetla. Am seeing it ever since I was born & moved to Chetla. The shop which also acts as a toad direction to my home. ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†
The sweets are awesomely tasty (though I am not a lover of sweets being a Bong), I love alu torkari & kochuri which they make in the evening as snacks. Yummy.

If u are near chetla u r bound to notice this place. I have been there a few times n have tried mishtis like khirkadam n talshash. They are good enough. Nothing extraordinary. But the mishti doi is awesum. Neither does it have a typical pinkish hue nor is it sickly sweet like other places. But creamy and tasty. I try to have it whenever m near chetla.

My sweet stop shop as it is in the neighbourhood...Desher Khabar makes yumm Big sized rosogollas, decent chanar cake, delectable sonpapri and lovely khirer chop! The winner though, is the amsatta sandesh! :-) Kora paak isn't good at all.

Nothing much to write home about. 
The shop is located near my house and I have frequented it since childhood.
The mishti doi,chanar jilipi,singara,kochuri,bonde are decent enough.
Oh the moya is good too. Overall your average para sweet shop.
P.S-The owner doesn't like handing out change much.

Desher Khabar is a small typical Bengali sweet shop which is a landmark if you are coming to Chetla from Rashbehari area.I used to pass by this shop regularly and tried quite a few of their products.

The mishti doi is their best offering I feel.You can never go wrong with mishti doi basically.The sandeshes are all decent and nothing special.The fried sweets especially the chanar jilipi I found pretty good.The range of sweets is quite limited.The singaras and radha ballavis are average but even then they are quite often unavailable.

Overall this a more or less average Bengali sweet shop situated rather conveniently though.

Nearest sweetmeat shop from our house. It's quite well known in the locality. They prepare quality sweets and they have a good reputation in it. The bus stop is also known as Desher Khabar.

A small sweet shop which is a landmark in itself if you coming to Chetla. Besides the sweets you also get tasty hot samosas in the evening and radhaballavi in the morning. You better check out the timings for both because they are stock out even before you realise. The varieties of Sandesh are good and I like the JolBhoroSandesh and also love the Misti Doi they serve which i buy regularly whenever i pass by
Hygiene n all, like any other small sweetshop in the neighbourhood, with the servers dripping in sweat. But the products are tasty nevertheless
