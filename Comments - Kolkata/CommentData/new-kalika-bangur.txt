Their lemon chicken is just horrible. Their chef doesn't have a simple knowledge of preparing the dish nor the quantity of each ingredients to be added. They added so much lemon to the dish it became bitter in taste. Talking about chilli Chicken, the chicken balls were almost burnt and as result, the whole dish had a burnt smell. The noodles and fried rice also had a similar kind of problem. Overall a really bad experience. 
The price is though very reasonable.

This restaurant is an wonderful example of what we can call: STANDARD. Food Quantity: Standard, Food Quality: Standard, Taste: Standard. Prices: Standard.

In a world where every other restaurant is trying to minimize on Quantity and Quality, while maximizing the prices, this restaurant comes as a respite.

Highly recommended for online ordering. Not sure about restaurant ambiance.

Ordered a plate of chilli paneer, fried rice and hakka chow and our bill was just of Rs.215. The pricing has been done on the lesser side and is very pocket friendly! The quantity is more than enough. One pack of chowmien can be shared amongst two where it just retails for Rs.50. The food is delicious and they delivered to our place on a rainy day which is also a plus.

On a lazy afternoon, I didn't feel like cooking and ordered a Chicken Butter Masala from New Kalika. The packaging was not good. Oil had spilled outside. The gravy was delicious. The chicken pieces were big but were not so much tasty. Okayish, you might say. Felt like home cooked chicken only. The gravy was brilliant but it contained many small pieces of bone. üòï

Located Just opposite to Bangur super Market.Food ordered from Swiggy.
Food Ordered : Egg Chicken Roll and Egg Chicken Chowmein.
The quality of the food was very bad.
Roll was so so,but the chowmein was very bad in taste. We ordered Egg chicken chowmein but couldn't find a single piece of egg, and there were hardly 8-10 pieces of shredded chicken.

Kalika snacks are one of the oldest food joint of this area.This has been renovated and launched with a name of New Kalika.¬†
Located just opposite of the Bangur super market.
I had tried their rolls quite a number of times. Not very oily and filling as well. Freshly made always with generous amount of ingredients added to it. A decent place for quick bite.

On the streets of Bangur Avenue the New Kalika is located just beside the Bancharam Sweet Shop. Me & my friend was bit hungry at that time so we just tried it. This place doesn't offer dining & sitting on the plastic tools on footpath you need have their foods. Looking at the restaurant you may question about their quality of the foods but you can get surprise too.

Foods : We ordered following...

Egg Hakka Chowmein : The chowmein came on Styrofoam plates. It was full of vegetables & rich spices. The quality of noodles & oil seemed good. Everything was fried well. It was served hot & it tasted really good to me. Even I haven't expected the quality of food would be that good, it really surprised me. Quantity was pretty nice where it costs only Rs.60.

Fish Finger : 6 pieces of fish finger also came in a Styrofoam bowl with salad. The sizes of fish finger was little small & very thin. But it was crispy fried & filled fully with fish. Because of the fresh fish used it tasted good to me. It costs us Rs.60.

Conclusion : Being in Bangur if you wonder some street foods to feed your hunger then New Kalika is an wonderful option just because of the quality foods they offer.

Kalika Restaurant was one of the oldest restaurants on Bangur Avenue. Many¬†evening snacks were prepared by them. Roll, Chowmein, Mughlai Paratha were one of them. But due to some circumstances, it is close now. After that, this outlet open with "New" addition in name and different¬†place in Bangur area. The food is average in taste and it is popular for evening snacks and home delivery.
