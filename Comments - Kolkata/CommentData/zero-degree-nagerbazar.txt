1.0 is also a too positive review for them. Went there once and not a single item in the menu was available. Also worst hookah place you can ever imagine. If you think of visiting... don't.

If I could've rated in negative,I would have opted for that.It is probably the worst hookah lounge I have ever been too.The place has no exhaust facility and it's so smoky you might just suffocate and die.The hookah is shitty and will give you an instant headache and you'll have to pay 300 bucks for that crap.They even give you a complementary mocktail that is nothing but cheap Rally's syrup with soda,which they serve you in broken plastic glasses.The tables are dirty and the floor is unclean.The place has a disgusting crowd and it almost looks like a roadside disc cum bar.I couldn't bear staying in there for more than 20 mins.It was a mistake ever deciding on going to that place.

Pathetic experience.. Their choice of music sucks big time.. They play everything from raunchy bengali item numbers from the 90's to loud and peppy bollywood numbers. Didnt hear a single english song during my 1.5hrs stay. 
They have no sitting arrangement for small groups of two or three people. There are counter type long sofas along the perimeter of the sitting area on one side and pairs of three seater sofas facing each other on the other. 
The menu is absurd. The hookah is just like that of any other place but their menu features sandwiches,chaats,soups etc. I cannot imagine someone ordering filling food at a hookah parlour.
Lastly and most importantly, they DONT ACCEPT CARDS!! 
Overall, a bad experience. Wont recommend this place to anyone. If you are not a fan of raunchy bengali and hindi item songs, this place is gonna give you a headache.

I dont know what shall i say about this. More like a para adda. No food choices. Only pasta french fry or maggi which they charge at 10x price. The place to go when no option is available. Please management if you are reading this. Atleast add some good food to your menu and get your ac's fixed. Please.
