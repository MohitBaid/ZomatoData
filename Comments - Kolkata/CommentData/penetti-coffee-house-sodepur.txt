That name is a trap. Food is below average, location is also odd. Staffs aren't professional. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Been here couple of times. Just opposite to the Rathindra cinema hall. They've both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements. I's just beside the railway tracks so the sometimes it's get irritating. Loads of mosquitos are there if you choose to settle outdoor.

An okayish eatery in Sodepur just near the station... but the place is just beside the railway tracks and hygeine is a factor... and the open place attracts youngsters and insects both... priced high as compared to better options like CCD or Domino's... both of which are in Sodepur...
