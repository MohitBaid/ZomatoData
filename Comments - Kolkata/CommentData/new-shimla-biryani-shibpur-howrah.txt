Frankly I didn't like the food quality of this place. If you are low (read: very low!) on budget, you can hop into this restaurant. Under Rs. 150, you will get a full plate of chicken biryani that too with 1 small piece of chicken chap. They provide enough gravy though. A belly-filling deal only, if you know what I mean :)

I was a student of IIEST Shibpur, the restaurant is a 15 minutes walk from my hostel. The biryani is worth money, we often visit when we get bored to our regular mess servings. The place well is a bit on road so a bit not on hygienic side, also has least services but yes good for the college students. Visited it many times during stay in hostel, but a recommend only for near by dwellers, not for planned visit.

This place is few steps away from my Home and its near IIEST, Shibpur. Had their Chicken, Mutton and Chicken Chap many times. The reason is solely because it serves Biriyani and Chap at a very low Rate. Its a Roadside shop with 2 Tables which can accommodate 8 people. As one can expect the place is not much clean. I always prefer Take-Away.Coming to the food, the Biriyani & Chicken Chap are bit oily but it tastes Satisfactory.

A decent Biriyani shop and serves good Biriyani and chaap for people nearby. Sometimes we even ordered from this place when in college. Give this a try.

If u have low amount of money and u want to a stomach full of heavy meal . Then it's the perfect destination. In 100 INR u will get one plate of chicken biriyani with one plate of chicken chap.

Like any other by-the-street biryani joint, it provides you average quality biryani in no time. It has the advantage of being very near to IIEST Shibpur. So biryani-hungry people from the Institute can easily come here to taste biryani at a very cheap price. Beside that, there is nothing special...

The one and only biriyani destination for us, when our mess used to serve shitty foods. Price is very very low, it will take exactly 100rs for a plate of chicken biriyani and chicken chap. The biriyani tastes awesome and served in huge quantity.

Very cheap and the quality of biriyani is so good that you cannot resist yourself visit again and again. Please do not plan for seat and eat rather pick it up and enjoy at home.

Well, tbh the biriyani is not good at all, but if you are a BEing (IIEST student), you have to have visited this place more than once or had it in some freshers' or farewell!
