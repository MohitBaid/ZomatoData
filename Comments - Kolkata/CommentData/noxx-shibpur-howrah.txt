Nice bar. Had some drinks; price range is okay. The staffs were also very sporting. Music was good and so was the DJ.
Also ordered pizza. Their pizza base base is crunchy; a Lil different from conventional pizza giant soft bases. Had a good time there.

Went to have dinner with family on 1-Jan. Front part is very well decorated.Don't know about bar/lounge part, but family part of the restaurant is very gloomy, I didn't like the Ambience(lights, colors of the seats). I could able to hear the loud music from other part whenever kitchen door was getting opened. We could also hear the sound of some one puking in toilet which was very awkward. Total Ambience in the family restaurant can be better.

Now coming to food.Ordered fish malai kabab, Golden fried prawn, thai chicken curry, Hakka noodles and tai pai chicken. Looks of the Menu card and item names do not go with wow factor of the front part of the restaurant.

Malai kabab was really good, malai had little coconut flavor. Prawn was okay. Thai chicken curry was really good. Others were normal. Overall we liked the taste of the food. Tittle costly though.

One of the better restaurants compared to what we have in Howrah. Overall 3.5 out of 5. With better ambiance and no noise of vomiting it can be 4.5.

Food, service, ambience and everything is amazing here. The 549 buffet service was excellent, had plenty of items at a very reasonable rate. The mocktails were also equally wonderful. Nice experience

If you have to enjoy the disco in howrah then you must be in noxx. The place has an enchanting atmosphere and special platters like rissoto is really lipsmacking. Last but not the least the behavior of the staffs including the owner Mr. Manas is really very good. So there is no better place than noxx in howrah to spend your 31st night with fun and enjoyment.

The place is amazing...thanx to owner Mr.Manas for making my cousin's anniversary so very special. A personal touch from his side made our night so very memorable. Guiding us through each course right from starter, his involvement throughout the evening was overwhelming. If anybody wants to have a day made special, this place is worth visiting. The Dj floor is awesome.... Food items fan'taste'tic!!!! Items worth tasting- fish malaikari, dessert- nolengurer icecream with caramelized walnut - thumbs up!!!! Mocktail- miljulke sarkar!!!! Thanx again to the entire management. Hope to be there again !!!!

The service is super slow and the staff are unprofessional. They took 35 mins just to get the check, can you imagine? The food was moderate nothing to be proud of, other wise ambience is nice but some people were there who got too drunk and were making a fuss about everything. Would go there but not very often due to the above reasons. Cheers guys! :)

Nice place near at a distance of 10-15 min from my house. Although a bit expensive but the ambience is good and the food and hookah quality is also good. However, dj was a little below par on which I think they need to look upon. But overall a nice place to hangout with friends and enjoying....

The flavour of Howrah is changed by Noxx. It is totally different from any other restaurants. The quality as well as quantity of Foods and Drinks are very attractive. Besides that the taste of Live DJ adds more taste to the customers. Over all it is the best Pub according to me and too much enjoyable. If any body comes here once,He can not protect himself from coming here once again.

Went there for lunch with a few friends a few days back. Luckily saw they have an unlimited buffet set menu at ₹549 all inclusive. Now coming to the ambience and decor, the place is simple yet attractive. Basically it is kind of a pub with a small dance floor at the corner and all sorts of groovy dance tunes playing out loud. 
To begin with there was a mocktail which was quite refreshing. We ordered beer as well which costed ₹199 AI. 
For the Starters there was a veg platter and a non-veg platter
The non-veg platter consisted of a crumb fried fish, chicken strips, haryali chicken satay, chicken tikka kebab on the first serving and chicken reshmi kebab on the second serving. 
The veg platter consisted of a paneer nuggets, paneer tikka, crispy chilli babycorn and french fries. 
Both the platters were amazing. Except the paneer nuggets everything was on point. 
For the main course there was option for mutton or chicken biryani. We choose chicken one. There was egg-chicken fried rice, butter naan, chicken kolhapuri, paneer butter masala. 
The kolhapuri chicken was amazing and so was the biryani. My other friends tried the egg-chicken fried rice, paneer butter masala and naan and found the paneer butter masala to be a little bland in taste. 
They should add a chinese side dish since they are service fried rice. 
Our meal ended with malai kulfi. It was also very good. 
The service was ok but the behaviour of the staffs were really praise-worthy. 
Will definitely visit again
Happy Fooding ♥

Today we went there for dinner..we ordered two continental dishes. 
The menu card they provided when we were ordering our food the price was normal one is 300 n the other one is 275..food was not at all bad..then we asked for the bill..then the harassment started..the bill amount was 1444.
the food we ordered from the menu card that was totally different from the card they were showing with the bill..the dish which was amounted 300 in that bill that was 650 n other was which was 275 that was 375...
We talked to the manager n the owner also..
Thankfully we had that dish before ,,which they are claiming 650..so they told us to specify the date n we also have that picture so we showed it to them they check the earlier bill..then they less the bill n make a new bill for us..but,,it was totally a big harassment we  suffered. .
If the authority has changed the prices of the menu card then they should removed one older one..
People come to your place to enjoy the food not for facing this kind of harassment. .
This is not at all excepted as a regular customer. .
Thank you.

The pub cum restaurant is recenty opened in our area.as a normal enthuastic human being,i went to visit their restaurant with very little knowledge about the horrible experience that is on my way.
I was fortunate enough to not having the experience inside the restaurant as their security guard make sure we dont enter into the restaurant with their typical uncutured 

unsofisticated attitude.

Dear owner of this restaurant,

i dnt know whether this review will reach to you or not.if it does i hope you do userstand that all peope are not the same and there are some still left who expect minimum mannerism n behaviour n ethiquotte.please employ security staff who knows atleast how to behave with their customer respectfully without starting a conversation with "tu" unless u might get some customer for the pub but soon start to loose customer like us who is willing to go to the restaurant.

I had ordered biriyani under the offer biriyani express. It was really a quality food and though they said that 1 plate serves only one person but the amount of rice was much more. To add to it... the raita was equally tasty. The chicken pieces were succulent and the biriyani was moist enough but not greasy which made me give it a 5 rating. Prompt delivery and well communicated staff. It is nice to have such a food joint in Howrah so near to our place. Way to go noxx.

It is a great place to visit if you are in Howrah.. Your taste buds will be overwhelmed here.Starting from the kebabs to pizza and then chinese,we tried out everything -- all were up to the mark but the pizza could have been better with more toppings.. The ambience and environment for Hookah n bar side was a real check, although little dim - they will improve hopefully with time.. Staff and service was good and polite.. Helpful in chosing the side.
