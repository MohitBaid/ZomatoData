Good South Indian delicacies. Dosas could have been better. Vadas are really good, Reasonable price, But there are better South Indian restaurants in Kolkata with a cheaper price range and good quality of dishes. If you visit do try the Vadas. They are really crispy and nice with a nice range of chutni and sambhar, Again I say it, if you are looking for an amazing blend of South Indian food, this is not the place for it according to me, Service was good but at the end of the day its the food that matters and it should improve drastically. 
Food : 3.5/5 
Ambiance : 4/5 
Service : 4.5/5 
Location : 5/5 
Price : 4/5 
Overall : 4/5 
Food Recommendations : Vadas, Cheese Dosas, Medu Vadas.  
A nice family restaurant which could have been better with the food, Otherwise a nice place for a snack and a subtle hangout.                             I would definitely visit this place again and I hope the masala dosas improve. Top it off with an ice cream or lassi which is a great ending to a South Indian dish.
Kind of a mixed review but an honest one!

Can you imagine an orthodox South Indian joint winning the hearts of numerous foodies of KOLKATA ? Sound ironical ! Well BANANA LEAF is the answer ! A joint locates at the heart of Rashbehari Avenue serving delicacies of seamless quality is the sole mantra of this place. As soon as we entered here, we were reminded of the A2B outlets and the Kamaths that we visited during my times in Bengaluru. Basic South Indian decor with fast moving service (with a smile off course) is bound to set the tone for a perfect dosa craving. 

We ordered Cheese Mysore Masala Dosa and Cheese Masala Dosa, and by the first look of them, both seemed oozing with confidence. And why not ? The first bite revealed it all. Generous portions of molten cheese mixed with the spiced-up potato smash made the visit worth it. Specifically, the Mysore Dosa is the best I had in Kolkata till date. On our request, they even served us the "Gatti" chutney (the thick coconut chutney which is not diluted), which made us nostalgic of our Bengaluru days. We didn't have the inner space to consume Rava Kesari anymore by the time the dosas were done with and hence that ecstasy is still to be explored. 

The pocket pinch is minimal by going by the quality and quantity of the servings. All in all, a MUST GO TO outlet from my side, if you ever have a South Indian craving !

I’ve visited here twice with my aunt; post renovation, the place looks quite spic and span. I had already had the common Idli, Plain/Masala Dosa and Medu vada umpteen times, so we scanned the menu card and decided to order something special, viz. the Podi Dosa. It has Podi, a combination of powdered toor dal (also known as arhal dal), moong dal, chana dal, red chillies & cumin seeds. This is also known as Gunpowder, and is popular amongst South Indians. The mixture was copiously smeared on the inside of the Dosa, and gave an edge to the taste. On the next occasion, we opted for the Rava Dhosa, made of sooji. It was thick compared to the common rice-batter Dosa, and filled our bellies soon.

I found something remarkable on both days....South-Indian families having their lunch at the place. I initially wondered why they would come to a restaurant to have the kind of food they can very well have at home. And then I remembered....for the same reason Bengali families flock to restaurant serving Bengali cuisine ;)

Ordered through Swiggy. This time round, the taste and quality seemed lacking. The sambar was sweetened. Far from how it should taste. The sada dosas were as crisp and dry as the paper dosas, which is definitely an issue. The vadas were overdone, of which a couple were slightly blackened. The oil was too hot, and no one bothered about the quality of the food being sent out. Typical. In any case, I am but one customer, but this one customer will take his custom elsewhere.

Visited JULY 2017We happened to visit the restaurant on Sunday morning around 10am. We had to wait in the adjacent Waiting Hall for 10 minutes to get a Big Table (Table for 9 pax). We had ordered Cheese Onion Masala Dosa, Paneer Onion Masala Dosa, Rava Masala Dosa, Mini Idly for kids, Vada. Dhania variant of Masala Dosa was exhausted by the time we entered the restaurant and hence had to miss out on that part but heard their Dhania variant of Dosa's are too good to resist. At the end, Special Filter Coffee which is so unique to any South Indian restaurants was served.

Service was disappointing as we had to repeatedly call the service persons during the stay.

My Personal ratings on the property:

Food - 4.5/5

Ambiance-5/5

Service - 3/5

Cleaniness - 4/5

Price - Little bit on the higher range i feel but probably worth it.

Banana leaf has always been my favourite one .

 I always go for dosa as they are really good and the filling for the masala dosas are more than enough .the service is good. The place is little crowded but we all know good food attracts more people so the crowd is justified 😊

This placeis easily loveable opposite lake mall. If you love South indian food( beyond the common dosa, idli, vada) then Banana leaf is the place for you. 

Try their South indian thali which was very filling and delicious. Onion uttapam is good but very heavy. In case you want to try a snack combo here , best choice would be the mini Tiffin where they give you a mini Sosa, vada, idli , upma and a sweet. 

Been here twice and found it a  fresh change for veg folks!!!

This is the best destination for South Indian food in South Kolkata. The food is close to the authentic taste and aroma of South Indian dishes. At the same time, it's cost effective and suits your pocket. 
If you are looking for a wholesome lunch or dinner, try their meal or Mini Meal plates. It comes with Rice,  Puri,  Sabji,  Halwa and other variety of items. 
Banana Leaf is of course the abode of lip smacking Dosa,  Vada and Uttapams. Many varieties are available and they cook each to perfection. Try the Cheese and Rava variants of Dosa and Uttapam if you want to experiment. Delicious! 
If you are a big group and looking for fun,  try the Family Dosa. It is enough for 3-4 people. 
Also, try the Cold Coffee and Lassi for a sweet ending. Icecream is also available nowadays. 
All in all,  tasty food with minimum pocket punch makes Banana Leaf a favorite destination.

Visited this place during Durga puja....spacious,calm decor, comfortable seating!

We ordered paper masala dosa, rava masala dosa and plate of idli-vada!!
Quick service inspite of durgapuja rush!!

The size of paper masala dosa is really big...served on banana leaf , crisp & tastes good, sambhar-coconut chutney-average..but the masala can b worked upon with little bit more spices..

Coming to Rava masala dosa...we really liked it ...it was perfect!!

We just loved the idli-vada served here...the idli was steaming hot & really soft! I never tasted this kind of mouth-melting idlis before!

Pricing slightly on higher side!

Never visited this one before Pujo this year. The outlet specializes in South Indian cuisine and delicacies. They serve the idly-sambar and dosas on a banana leaf and water in tall steel glasses. The interiors are designed with green wooden chairs and granite table tops which add to it's ambience and gives the visitor the feel of South India. Minimal decor on the walls and you feel almost at home with the pleasant absence of fine-dining snobbery. Coming to the food, it doesn't compromise on the quantity and the taste keeping in mind the competitive price. The idly-sambar is priced at 75/- that I felt a tad too high since only two idlis were served. Milkshakes tasted alright. Definitely deserves a second visit this one.

My first visit to South Indian Restaurant in South Kolkata in recent times as I have had always prefer Anand at Central Avenue for South Indian cuisine. 
It is the Durga Puja times and being brought up in this city one cannot resist himself to not indulge into pandal hopping, para adda !!
We were also doing the same since noon.

Once we were done covering South Kolkata Pandals under moderate rainfall with Deshapriya Park being the last one we came across this restaurant.

The place has a decent infrastructure, gentle staff and price also being average.

Dishes - Butter Onion Masala Dosa & Paneer Masala Dosa were the one which I liked. Vada and Chutney could have been slightly better by making them a bit crisper and adding a slight blend of spice.

Overall the place is a decent one and at walking distance from Kalighat Metro station.

This place sells literal home made south indian food. The spices are in right amount. The taste takes you to Chennai. And the paper dosa is huge. Really tested my apetite.

Was never quite fond of South Indian dishes until I discovered this gem. This place  undoubtedly serves the best dosas and uttapam in town. Have visited this place innumerable times and they have never disappointed me till date. My personal favorites are the cheese onion masala dosa which is always overloaded with cheese,the rava dosa and the paper dosa(love the fact that they give the masala in a bowl instead of putting it in the dosa such that the dosa remains crisp), the mixed uttapam (love the lavish spread of cashew on top), the vada (crisp and soft to perfection), the thali(one can go for extra serving of rice and puri and even the sambar and chutney). Recently they have introduced a range of mocktails however I prefer sticking to my filter coffee or lime soda. The restaurant is quite spacious divided in 3 sections with friendly and prompt service. The pocket pinch is such that one can enjoy a sumptuous meal without worrying much about the price. To conclude, it is the final destination for all who crave for delicacies from the South.

Undoubtedly, one of the best places in Calcutta for South Indian Food.

We have been here quite a lot of time and have never been disappointed. The place is located right opposite to Lake Mall on the ground floor of Komalavilas Hotel. It is a large seating area divided into two rooms. The place usually remains crowded (even of weekdays) because of its delicious South-Indian food and so you might have to wait for 10-15 minutes. It is a quiet place with clean seating area. 

Our usual order is: Mini Idli, Idli Saambar, Saambar Vada, Masala Dosa, Mysore Masala Dosa, Podi Dosa and Filter Coffee. They give you unlimited Coconut Chatni and Saambar with all these dishes (which usually is a constraint in other South Indian restaurants in Calcutta). The staff is very friendly and the service time is around 15-20 minutes which is reasonable enough given that it remains crowded. 

Would recommend this to anyone who wants to have South-Indian cuisine in Calcutta. Even if not, give it a try. You might start loving Dosa(s), Chatni(s) and the likes  :)

But we had to call for extra chatni and sambar servings a few times as no one was around. They really need to improve on the service. The mocktails was kind of okayish, nothing worth mentioning. Few were really not tasty at all. So it is recommended not to try mocktails here just stick to south indian food instead. Overall a nice experience altogether.

Fantastic Location , walking distance from almost all kinda of bus stops / bus routes / cab locations etc , the food is good and the ambiance - well , just like you would expect a south Indian restaurant to be like situated at Komala Vilas hotel, about 5 minutes walk (towards Gariahat) from Kalighat metro along the footpath on the left or bang opposite of the Lake Market .
Having said that I also must agree with Aninda De - Recruiting under-aged boys in the restaurant is uncalled for and cannot be excused 
Food is Good and I have no complaints about the food , but there are a few tips Maybe Mr. Ram Prakash Viswanathan should make a note of :
1) For those who drop in late in the evening and land up being amongst the last customers to leave - it gets very irritating and uncomfortable when the staff stand beside you hurrying you on with your food 
2) Please ask your Staff not to demand higher tips that have already been left behind it is very embarrassing
3) Please take care of the small roaches scurrying around the floor and in the nooks and corners of the wooden furniture
4) Please take care of your regular customers , they come regularly because they like the food but then would also turn irregular if they want to avoid circumstances mentioned above

Banana Leaf is an institution that really doesn't need any further introduction. This particular branch is situated at Komala Vilas hotel, about 5 minutes walk (towards Gariahat) from Kalighat metro along the footpath.

The place gives a truly southern feel & the energy & vibe you feel inside is organically close to an eatery you would actually find in Chennai. Homely, hygienic & clean, the food served is also tasty, filling & easy on the pocket. This is an A grade place that delivers exactly what it promises one hundred percent.

The question then becomes what is the reason for this very low rating. After our meal was over, we spotted that many young boys, some looking well under the age of 15, were working both in the serving area & in the back kitchen. Employing underage boys to work in your restaurant is against the law & can not be excused. Banana Leaf is a very well known establishment that absolutely doesn't need to bring themselves down to such a low level, for whatever reasons they might be. Sincerely hoping that this issue will be noted & addressed by the competent authorities.

Otherwise, such a meal like this just leaves a bad taste in your mouth at the end.

The dosas were really nice and the sambar is good too. But I have tasted better sambar. Anyway, It was a pretty crowded place. We had to wait outside for 15 minutes which was such a bummer. The staffs there were a bunch of amateurs. They took a lot of time to bring food and they were completely oblivious when it comes to taking care of their guest's needs. We also ordered Lime soda, which was well, to put it nicely a disaster. They charged a hefty amount for a simple lemon and water mix. Got totally ripped off. The only redeeming quality was the quality of the dosas. I might visit again but I don't intend to very soon.

Visited this place with friends late Sunday night.As it was almost closing time they were in hurry to finish off serving as if obliging.few of the items were not available. Sambhar little sweeter side if you like it really tangy and spicy  this is not the place for you.we ordered dosa idli  vada and uttapam. Jain sambhar had finished so my Jain friend had to manage with the chutney .the only silver lining was the tomato onion uttapam which was crisp and yummilicious. Happy eating

A place for South-Indian cuisine lovers.. The rating 2.5 is because of their service.. 
If you are ever planning to go to this place, have lot & I repeat LOT of time in hand.. They take atleast 45 minutes to serve a single Uttapum.. I guess, that's an enough description ..  But, if I talk about the food, it's good..

No doubt about the food, but the hygiene level is not upto mark. I think they should keep some focus on dish washing also... I would love to give 9 out of 10 but -5 for hygiene, which I think is as important as food quality... Looking forward for it... Good luck..

Sumptuous meal, ample potions, great ambience, a great place for a perfect family outing. The restaurant is situated on the main road so very easy to locate. You are warmly welcomed at the place as you enter the aroma of tangy sambhar touches your soul. 
From plain dosa to cheese dosa we tried almost all genres of South Indian delicacy. Their five flavour uttapam platter, rasam, idli and vada were out of the world. 
Everyone should definitely go out for a nice dinner to this place. Highly recommended!

If it is food with the authentic taste of the South, this is the place to be. Air-conditioned and food served with a heart. A must visit for anyone and everyone.

This place just served me one of the best South Indian thalis I have had and to find it outside of South India is fantastic.
Let it be known they don't have any other branches,and the place is not upmarket but you will not be disappointed if you are here purely for the brilliant food the serve.

I went ahead and ordered a South Indian Thali:
-they serve up the regular rasam and sambhar with atleast 3 other types of lip smacking curries,curd,pickle,kesari bhaat. You can have it with as much as you like parathas(which are incredibly well made) and rice.
I loved every dish that was on the plate.

The service is super quick and things come in hot in a flash and the prices are very nominal. I am sure for return visits in the future to satusfy those South Indian cravings

As today was Father's Day, i let my dad be in the forefront and order from his one of the favourite South Indian Food Corner.
We were supposed to go and eat, but last minute changes meant a takeaway, which actually takes away the charm in case of Dosas.
For myself i had Rava Masala Dosa, which was not as crisp as it should have been. Yet considering i had it 2 hours later after it came home, i don't think i can complain about it. For my parents it was the authentic Masala Dosas which they swear by.
The only glitch, the Sambhar and Chutney were not properly given in quantity.

Since I love South Indian food, I decided I must visit this place. And I don't regret it. 
We ordered Blue Lagoon, Anti Colada, Fresh Lime Mint Cooler for drinks. They tasted good. 
Then we ordered Cheese Onion dosas, and a plate each of plain idlis and plain vadas. Perhaps the oil usage could have been a bit less, but I still loved all the dishes.

I always have cheese Rawa dosa whenever I visit this place. No one can make such a delicious cheese dosa as similar to Banana Leaf. They make a special red chutney which is very tasty.
One thing which they need to focus on is the cleanliness of the place.

My favourite Rawa Paneer Dosa had hardly any paneer in it the other day,last weekend. Instead it came filled with aloo (basically they mistook the order to be Paneer Masala Dosa)When I enquired about it, the waiter prompty said he will will it changed but what he did was that he basically scooped out  the aloo subji from inside the dosa.Also,when I asked about the small negligible quantity of paneer, he said that the restaurant had undergone a complete overhaul in management and the chef has changed.  The Dosa was good and so were the chutneys but charging 130 for a plain Dosa (which is earlier had an ample amount of Paneer in it ) is terrible.

This happens to be one of the most popular South Indian food joint of Kolkata and is quiet successful to live upto it's reputation. We dropped in on a Saturday evening and found plethora of people to throng the place. They've a very good system of managing the que and equally comfortable sitting arrangement. The place is tidy enough with decent ambience. Service is prompt and service staffs are courteous enough. 
Coming to food , it was just average. The Uttapam platter was just ok but masala dosa and ghee roasted masala dosa tasted damn similar and that was too, not much different from any other random South Indian food stalls..  
Apart from food, satisfied with every other component, food quality may be improved.

The pure South Indian food joint at Kolkata.

I have visit there many times and order different food items all was good. And the size of dosa is more larger then ur expectation.  This same feeling has come the uses of cheese in the cheese based food item. But the service quality not up to the mark. But the food teast is forgot you to all other negative thing.

I used to love this place for their rasam idli, so after they opened I had gone over earlier this week after the renovation. I had ordered a plate of rasam idli and a fresh lime soda to start with. I was waiting for another friend and had finished my food. I then ordered a lassi and after I drank down a few sips one of the waiters (they are all new except maybe 1 or 2) came over and asked me if I wanted my bill. Only around 4 or 5 tables were filled and there wasn't a rush, so I was amazed that they had tried to push me out of the restaurant. I do not think I will be visiting again after this, or if I do, then I will have to think long and hard about it.

Staying near to this place whenever I get time I go over there for a quick bite . Situated beside the lake market main road the restuarant is indeed a crowd catcher . Everytime it's been filled with a decent crowd.The ambience is good . It not only serves food to the people who goes over there but also allow them to take away.
The quality of food is very much up to the mark so the quantity also

I was there with a gentleman friend. After waiting outside for 15 mins we finally got a table. We were asked to sit at a 6 seater table. After that an unkmoen person came and occupied the chair beside me. After 10 mins another unknown person came and sat at the same table. So i was sharing my table with unknow people. And we were neither informed or permission taken

I ordered a onion tomato uthapam. It was half or quarter cooked. Hence i was not able to eat. Dunno about the taste of the dosa but even he could not finish half.

I dont even want to tell about the dirty floor with water running on the marble floor wherr even a staff slipped and fell.

I m sure i will not ever go bsck.

Worst experience till date. Been there today with my husband. Ordered two onion masala rava dosa and a mocktail. First we asked a cleaning boy to send someone to take the orders. He himself came and took the order but did not bother to place it. Then we waited for nearly 20 minutes but the food is not served. Then we asked two to three table attendants to check our order, but nobody bothered. Then one came and took the orders. We requested him to place the food as fast as possible because we were really hungry. Then we waited another 25mins but food didn't arrived. We got frustrated, left the table. We complained at the main billing section but all in vain, they are not bothered or apologetic at all. They might have a whole bunch of customers flooding in their restaurant so loosing few won't matter to them but when you are at serving business learn to serve your each and every customer well enough.

I am a big south indian food lover. So this is one of my go-to place whenever i crave for authentic south indian delicacies. Last time i visited this place, we ordered for idli, vada, mini meal and paper cheese masala dosa. The idlis were soft and the vadas were really crispy. Loved their chutneys also. The mini meal consisted of 3 varieties of rice, chutney and a sweet halwa. All the items tasted delicious. The dosa took around half an hour to reach our table after repeated reminders, which is a turn off. The cheese was adequate in the dosa but it nowhere looked like a paper dosa., it was not that papery crunchy but tasted really good.

I visited Banana Leaf for the first time today (11/05/2017) at around 1.15pm with my mother. The ambience is busy and a bit noisy but the service is good and courteous. We ordered Paper Butter Masala Dosa and Cheese Butter Masala Dosa, the former tasted good and upto the expectation, but the potato stuffings of the latter need improvement. It tasted quite blatant, sorry to say that. Overall, it was a good experience. Before signing off, I would like to point out one thing which displeased me the most about the joint - the little boy who works there as a server boy, cleaning the table and taking away the used utensils (child labour). I felt bad to see him working and clearing away our mess while two boys of his age were eating at the next table (customers). I would have preferred it if someone older enough to work is in his place instead.

It took a while to find this little place in Lake Market. Tucked inside the row of flower vendors in the main market area, this is a perfect place for authentic South Indian cuisine. The ambience, the staff and the style of service (which is quite lethargic) remind me of breakfast eateries in Mysore in the early 90s. But then, a lot of places in Kolkata remind me of the 90s. 

I kept going back to this place every day at least once during my week-long stay, despite myself. Is this what comfort food feels like? 

Every dish tastes perfect but the dosas are really the best. Understandably, the place is always packed, and it really takes some prodding and coaxing for the waiters to hustle, but it's all worth it.

If you wish to change your culinary taste to something vegetarian, then this is just the place to check in. Age old South Indian restaurant serving vegetarian dishes at an affordable price is really worth visiting. Try out the Cheese Dosas. Rava dosas, Uthappam. All are super tasty. Added attraction is the filter coffee. All the dishes and beverages are served in traditional styles. Interiors are simple and hygienic. Must visit for those who wish to try authentic South Indian dishes simply by sitting in Kolkata.

Location of this particular outlet helps it to be packed with crowd throughout the day...The service is really fast but all the waiters are quite "AJEEB" types.They keep standing in the sides and stare at every customer (And I don't know why)

Nothing special with Dosa,Chatni was pathetic.We Order Parotha Korma n Kuzhi Paniyaram which was on the Today's Special menu but that also didn't add any extra magic.Filter Coffee was refreshing . Staffs were Humble enough and admitted for the inconvenience but slow with the service.Hope they Enhance they food Quality atleast.All The Best !!

Hello foodizens!!,
I had this place bookmarked ti go for ages and somehow it wasn't working out.
Finally on pehela boishak I went here with my family,see we with our national integrated lives have loved south indian food and spending time down south has made me want it even more.But sadly this was a let down ,the food tasted good, the service was amazing, friendly fast servers even in busy restaurant taste o.k. but what was off was the oil factor,since I ordered rasam vada I didn't notice but my parents ordered normal vada with sambar and chatni separate and both complained that the vada was oozing oil which usually means that it was prepared early and warmed ,I happen to know is a normal practice down south too but not in restaurants the normal stalls yes, I couldn't complete my uttapam because it oozed out so much oil even in blotting the base with tissues.
Makes me sad as I had looked forward but might have been the in rush confusion of kitchen in a heavy festival/ weekend double trouble day, I am still going to try and eat on another as they are the only place with bissi belle bhat!! Second time might be the charm.so,
Food-2/5
Service -4/5
Ambiance- made miss the lunch rush in my grad days
Value for money -3/5
Still would go back again to try.

Craving for south Indian snacks we stopped at banana leaf opp lake market. I am a regular at this place and often stop for a quick meal during my market visit days.

We first had to wait for a vacant table, which is a good sign. But overheard a few leaving customers complain about service.

Finally after a ten minute wait were ushered in. We quickly ordered for a cheese plain dosa, a mini tiffin,  a sweet lassi and a thumsup. 
The mini tiffin came about 10 mins before the dosa. The drinks followed after another 5 mins. The lassi was terribly warm and flat. I came to know almost at the end of meal that they had Pepsi and no thumsup.

Bottom line very poor service indeed.

Food quality- the coconut white chutney was watery and tasteless.

The sambar was extra spicy.

The dosas were just about alright.

While paying up I asked the waiter if there was any problem as the food unlike my previous experience S was less than ordinary. He mentioned that the cooks and management have changed and hence such trashy service and food. Pls avoid this joint.@

If you're looking for south Indian food joint then this is the perfect place for you. This outlet is an oldest south Indian joint in Kolkata. It's​ located in lake market area. The service is very quick. We went there multiple times and tried many of their food items. Ambiencewise it's not that good. But their foods will satisfy your taste buds for sure.

The best place to have the perfect South Indian food at a really low cost. Mouth watering and stomach filling food, at such a place is really  blessing. 
Do try the Cheese Onion Dosa and the crispy Medhu Vada with Sambar and the chutnies. Worth the money

The quality of the food is pathetic. Did not expect such kind of service from the staff as well. I have been here many times and such a performance from them is totally unexpected. I had ordered Onion Rava Dosa and they provided me a Dosa which had the minimum amount of onions. This never happens in any south indian restaurant or cafe. After several enquiry about the food, they ignored me.

This outlet is one of the first and oldest outlet in the town serving mouth watering south Indian cuisine which surely gonna play with your taste buds.
The other two outlets are near bhawanipur and sector V salt lake. 

They serve some best idlis which are fluffy and will feel like having cotton. 
Moglapudi idli is one of my favourite where they serve it with the moglapudi chutney on the top of the idli and it's amazing in taste. 

Cheese masala rava dosa is my usual go to dosa.
With some good tea.

Kesar bath is one of the delicacy out here and it's a must try. Heavenly in taste.

If you're around the Rashbehari crossing and lake market area, this is just your place to be. The old world south Indian joint with an AC section thrown in- thankfully. The idlis are to die for here- soft and fluffy. I prefer to order their Molgapudi idli. It adds the sticky molgapudi masala over the idli (you need to ask for it separately) and its heaven. The rava Dosa is pretty good and filling. Thankfully they serve the Kesar Bath (the sweet halwa with banana pulp) piping hot and its a must-try there. For Upma, I'd suggest their upma platter for an assortment. 

Definitely recommended.

We tried the mini idlis as well, which were 16 in number and good to taste as well. Filter coffees at this place are authentic and definitely worth a try. Not much to expect ambience wise, but a must try if you love dosas and idlis!

South India in Bengal?


Nothing like good authentic South Indian food in the heart of Bengal. After ages we went for dinner to eat South Indian. The dosa, the mini idlis, the butter milk and to top it off amazing filter coffee. A really refreshing and different option to eat outside in Kolkata. A really cozy and simple place. Fast food and alot of buzz all around makes it a great place to go to. Their Sunday lunch also looks like a good try. Definitely worth a shot. If you're looking for good sambhar and chutney in a very reasonable price? This is the place to go to. 200 bucks per head? What else do you want.

If you are looking for authentic south Indian vegetarian food, then there is no other place than Banana Leaf. I visited this place for breakfast today. The restaurant is neat and clean with an austere look. I ordered sambar vada to start with. It was delicious, the vadas were crispy, crunchy and hot. The sambar was piping hot and excellent. But the coconut chutney stole the show. Then I had cheese plain dosa: amazing with loads of shredded cheese and accompanied with chutney and sambar. Finally, I had the filter coffee, and it was strong and aromatic, as South Indian coffee should be. Also, I witnessed my neighbouring table having the family dosa. The size was humongous! The staffs are extremely cordial and amicable.

Highly recommended for savouring South Indian Vegetarian delicacies.

Though I am not a fan of south Indian food but I loved their cheese onion masala dosa and paper butter masala dosa, a must try. I also liked their filter coffee. Though sambar and chutney were average , they need to make more varieties of chutney. They usually serve in banana leaf , which is a good thing.
There is always rush here , so service is kind of slow but staffs are well behaved.

Have been coming back to this place for the Filter coffee and Rasam vada!.
I was a regular in college days and have spent most of my free afternoons chatting with friends over Rasam idli and Mysore masala Dosa.
All Dosa and Vada lovers this is your place to be.
A great south Indian breakfast or a quick lunch Banana leaf offers it all.
An element of marvel is the gunpowder Dosa here.
Yeah! Gunpowder.
It is basically normal dosa stuffed with a mixture of Ingredients and spices.
The filter coffee here has history behind it.
Served in a steel glass this coffee is what memories are made over.

This time i visited during evening and as usual was met by efficient staffs.The crowd was much less this time so did not had to wait for food at all.
I had ordered Bisebella bhat ( it has a khichri like consistency) which was served with papad and raita.

Quantity wise good enough for 1 person can be shared too if you have other side orders.
Taste wise ,this place makes me nostalgic of my days in Bangalore and so the taste is very authentic ....rather one of the most authentic in Kolkata.
Kesari bhat ( a sweet dish made of semolina with pine apple,cashew,and raisins) was a bit not good as the ones we used to have in Bangalore i guess used a smaller rava or semolina which is less sticky,also they did not use pineapple in their kesari bhat.

Overall i love this place and would definitely come back again and again.

This is situated near Lake market area, a good place to get South Indian cuisine at very reasonable cost and good quality.
 We went there on 31st early evening.

Ambiance is fine , as for service they took time to get us seated but once we were settled it was good. , polite staffs.

We were in a group of 8 and tried a lot of things starting from Rasam Idly, mini Idly, normal Idly Vada and various types of Dosas. Tried Cheese masala dosa Onion Chilli Rava Dosa and Butter plain Rava Dosa, The Dosas  crunchy and cheesy.  The Butter Rava dosa was not at all buttery and was trying to find the taste of Butter. Also tried filter coffee , which was refreshing and energetic .

Pocket Pinch only 200 per head. It was very reasonable.
Overall a nice experience .

The best South Indian restaurant I have been to. Hands down! 
The idea was instead of going for NYE dinner, lets go for a NYE breakfast. For the same, I had pitched in the names of Taj Bengal, Bikers Cafe etc. and m. y friend suggested Banana Leaf. After a lengthy discussion, we decided on Banana Leaf. I had my reservations but she stood her ground and I am happy about it now. So on D-Day, we left the campus at around 9 AM (don't ask me how we achieved that). By the time we reached the place around 9.40 AM, it was already jam packed with people hogging on all kinds of foods. We actually had to wait for a good 10 minute to get a table for ourselves. Regarding the food, I surrendered the responsibility to my friend and she ordered the following  : 

1. Pongal :  Best food ever I guess. It is supposed to be khichdi but amazingly good. 
2. Sada Vada : Perfect shape to begin with concentric circles.
3. Gunpowder Dosa: Yes, you heard that right. Basically inside of the dosa, they sprinkle this powder made up of many ingredients. 
4. Lassi : This is the only thing I ordered and it was crap. So avoid.
5. Filter Coffee: The way they serve it is unique in its own way and has a history behind it. 

My friend wanted to try one more dish but the same was available post lunch only. Nevertheless, the service was lightening quick and the staff was courteous, explaining to us things patiently. The place was squeaky clean.  The food was so filling that we did not have a morsel of food till 3 PM I guess and that too at such a low cost. 

It was a find for me!

Probably the best South Indian food in town. It's crowded most of the time and there might be a long waiting queue, but in the end it's worth the wait. The idlis are super soft and the sambhar is delicious - not too sour or watery. Their uttapams with cheese in them are a must try, although I almost always go for their mysore masala dosa. The filter coffee is to die for and the buttermilk is perfect for the summers. Very pocket friendly, too!

For a change south Indian food is light and easy on digestion. And if you are looking for authentic and amazing south indian taste, then you can never miss out in this joint. 
Since school , I have been eating here, and I must say I would still live to hog here. 
My hero dish here has to be the "mini idli". It is the normal idli with Sambhar and coconut chutney. But the size is the catch. The idlis are of the size of lime slices. Small fluffy soft and freshly made . 
It is a burst of taste in your mouth. 
The chutney and daal are well spiced. 
Also butter cheese dosa, crisp golden brown and glazed with butter all over. 
That is a sight my friend. 

Hurry and taste the perfect south indian food. 
A very homely and amiable environment.

What was once the best place to have South Indian food in Calcutta, has sadly turned into the worst place.

The food doesn't even taste good anymore, the place isn't well lit, the open kitchen couldn't get dirtier and the staff couldn't care less.

Ordered one Uttapam and one Idly and one Coke for which they took 30 mins to serve when the restaurant was empty. What I got was a tasteless Idly and a raw Uttapam. When I asked for my Coke out of irritation, the staff said it's supposed to be served after the lunch.

Banana leaf was one of my favorite places for coffee and South Indian food, but the food can't be everything to a restaurant, the staff are also a vital part of it. Today morning I went there to have breakfast and I ordered 2 filter coffee, there was a fly in my friend's coffee so I asked the waiter to change it. He just refilled the same cup of coffee and gave it back to us. My friend noticed it and we asked the waiter to give us a fresh cup of coffee instead of making us fool by refilling the same one. Instead of being apologetic for his actions, he threw attitude at us and said there is no coffee now, I'll cancel the charges for this coffee. I was very pissed and angry at his behaviour and even complained about the same to the cashier. I just hope you guys take corrective actions regarding these things because we are not eating your food for free, we are paying for the damn food from our pocket and if we get this type of attitude and food quality from you guys then I don't think I'll be returning to your place. The amount of money your management is spending on food and building, I think some of it should also be diverted to training your staff. One thing is sure I won't be coming back to this place again.

Our family is often dragged to this outlet as my mom is very fond of South Indian food and when mom tells you to go somewhere, what option do you have?

So I've been to this location multiple times and here are my favorite dishes:

Idli - This is the classic Idli, it's really soft and there is unlimited chutney and sambhar for everyone so why would anyone choose not to take this iconic dish is beyond me

Molgapudi Idli - Now this is for those who don't mind some variations in their idli, this idli is covered completely with a masala called Molgapudi, the flavour of which is hard to define.

Onion Rava Dosa - Full of holes and very crispy, this is my favorite dosa at Banana Leaf.

Papadams - This is my favorite part of south indian cuisine, I JUST LOVE PAPADAMS MAN

Filter Coffee - I honestly think there is no better way to end the meal than with filter coffee.

For photos of places where I eat in Calcutta or other cities, follow me on Instagram. (Same name in both places)

This south indian restaurant is located close to the Lake Mall. It was quite crowded when we reached there but we managed to get a table. The ambience isn't praiseworthy. Nothing much to grab your attention...like most of the other South Indian Restaurants. Reasonably priced. The food is good. We had masala dosas, Vadas and Onion Uttapam. The dosas were decent in size and tasted good. I felt the uttapam was a bit small compared to the price. The vadas were good. Hygienic and well-maintained. They served the dishes on a "banana leaf"..which I felt, was a nice gesture.

If you don't manage to make it the lunch time you can always try the Cheese/Butter(whatever you prefer) Masala Rava Dosa and a Sada Vada and to the end the meal with a cold coffee would be like one of the finest South Indian Meals that you have had in Kolkata.

19/10/16 I don't often visit to a vegetarian restaurant. But after finishing shopping at lake mall I thought of visiting here since I heard a lot about them. Order one paneer rava dosa and one cheese dosa. Believe me the dosas were just fantastic specially the cheese one. After having too much of daily nonveg delicacies this place today turned out to be a taste changer for me. Overall experience was great.

Great place for a sumptuous South Indian platter this is. There's nothing great about ambience but it's not bad either. Moreover the location is spot on the main road. Located in the ground floor of Komala Vilas, this place has become a landmark on its own!
We have visited this place countless number of times and even taken a business friend of my dad from Chennai who verified the authenticity of this place. I had tasted by first kozhi paniyaram here on that uncle's recommendation. That was quite a few years back though.
Now that I live in Chennai, I can understand the authenticity of this place even more and the emotional attachment to this place by the huge crowd of Tamilians and people from the neighbouring states residing in the Lake Market area (personal note : my neighbour in Chennai stayed in this area in Kolkata for around twenty years or more).

I'm as south Indian as a non south Indian can get when it comes to tucking in idlis and dosas!
This a famed place.
I was just too happy to go in there .lovely I thought at first look.
Beautifully painted walls yet minimalist in decor.
I ordered a Masala Rava dosa and a plate of idlis 
Fresh and light,just how it should be but it wasn't distinguishing enough from several other lesser known south Indian eateries around Kolkata.
I have had better idlis and Rava dosa than here.
So much for the name.
Go there and enjoy the good food but if you want it a tad better.ping me.i could tell you better places,cheaper too  
I like the place nevertheless,good food.could be better.

Finally one of the biggest item was struck off my restaurant wishlist this dashami. We were in the area for pandal hopping but were utterly dismayed by the hurried bishorjon of most of the big banner puja. Having run out of options, I convinced my friends to hangout at Banana Leaf. Its situated near Lake Mall. We were led into a spacious room. The whole restaurant is air conditioned but I think they need to check all the ac of the bigger room. Due to the heat, we were on the verge of leaving when I suddenly spotted a comparatively smaller adjacent room. Making ourselves comfortable, we ordered a paper butter masala dosa and a cheese rava dosa. Both items arrived within minutes and soon we found ourselves gorging on them. The paper masala dosa was huge and very filling. The cheese rava dosa was tasty too but I found the sabji not as mouth watering as the dosa themselves. The others dips were good and served in good quantities. The dosa I had here is clearly the best dosa I ever had. The bill came around Rs 338/- inclusive of taxes. We rather left on a happy note.

Very well located and crowded even for lunch on a weekday. The Thali, for which it is famous, lived up to its fame - it is served on a banana leaf but the leaf is placed in a plate, at slight variation from the South Indian tradition of just using a plain banana leaf. If there is something that should be changed about the Thali, it is the quantity that is served, which is too much for most people. The menu looked appetising enough to return for an evening snack too !!

They serve some of the best South Indian food that I have ever had. Simply love the Cheese Onion Masala Rava Dosa that they dish out. The amount of cheese added makes it oh so special. Their dosas and idlis are some of the best in Kolkata that you can savour. Another favourite of mine is the Butter milk. The restro is well maintained. Hygiene is good. Be here with some time in your hands cause there is perennially a queue. Service is ok, considering there is always a rush and they really have to get on with their job.

Me and my friend were craving for south Indian food so we went to try this place 'banana leaf' as we were near rashbehari area...the food here is super tasty.. The place is clean...service is really fast and nice...we had ordered for sada vada ,idly , sada dosa and onion cheese dosa ...everything tasted really nice, the onion cheese dosa was out of the world cuz it had a good amount of cheese ...sambar was super good but I just feel the coconut chutney could have been better...I had also ordered coffee which was really nice...less of sugar that is exactly how I wanted....next time I crave for South Indian food m surely coming here thums up👍

Location- walking distance from lake mall.

Interior and ambience: Basic interior, nothing special. Comfortable sitting arrangement. Ambience is good.

Food: RAVA DHOSA is one of my favourite here. Sambar and coconut chutney are better in taste in comparison to many other south Indian restaurants.
MASALA DHOSA and UTTAPAM are also good.
FILTER COFFEE is ok.

Service: A bit slow. Staffs behaviour varies. 

Price: Pocket pinch is high.

One of the best South Indian food served in town. Such an interesting name of the restaurant. My personal favourite from the venue is Mysore masala dosa and also the family paper masala dosa which is huge !!!!! 4 to 5 people can eat on one family paper masala dosa. And nonetheless the filter coffee leaves you with a refreshed feeling. Staffs donot have much time to pamper you around but they are real fast at service. But please make sure you have some time in hand while paying a visit here as the restaurant is always full and waiting time is high. Never mind. We can wait a little long to taste good food. Deserves repeated visits.

Perfect place for a South Indian breakfast or lunch. Located very close to Lake Mall, the eatery is housed inside a residential complex. Banana Leaf is one of the most reputed restaurant that serves authentic South Indian cuisine in South Kolkata. The small restaurant sees a good amount of crowd, mainly on weekends.

So far, I've tried their Masala Dosa, Idli and Curd Rice. They have got a wide range of items in their menu only limited to authentic South Indian preparations and not fusion dishes. Masala Dosa tastes quite good, comes wrapped in a banana leaf. Since I had a takeaway, they packed the mashed potatoes (masala) separately. Sambar was too runny, and had a hint of spice. Coconut chutney tasted fine. Idli tasted as it should, nothing really special. Curd Rice was too sour in my opinion but still enjoyable as dessert. Overall, food review is a mixed bag. There is nothing very special about the preparations, just about average.

Pricing is kept competitive, however you end up paying ₹40-50 more for each item than your average South Indian restaurant. A bill for two would surely stay under ₹350. Quantity is good, the dosas are not humongous in size as I have seen in some joints. Service time depends on the crowd, sometimes they will prepare your order very quickly, other times they will take ages. Packing is neat, no sambar or chutney leakage!

Overall, a so-so place to look for some authentic South Indian preparations.

Came here for lunch in the midst of shopping at Lake Mall. The restaurant is spacious,clean,air-conditioned and well maintained. There were many people in the restaurant so we had to wait a little bit for the food arrive. But once the food arrived we just dug in like hunger crazed people and finished the plate in a very short span of time 😁. The quality of the masala Dosas are simply awesome! I was so delighted to have proper sambhar and coconut chutney after a long time,and by proper I mean sambhar which isn't too runny and filled with more water than sambhar daal. Same goes for the coconut chutney which was thick and tasty. The dosa was crispy to my liking. Overall,lip-smacking south Indian food at affordable prices 😃

I was a regular visitor initially wen this place opened and was quite a fan of the idlis and dosas here. I visited last week after a longish gap.

I was pleasantly surprised that the quality n taste were still the same. I was really craving a South Indian meal when my brother suggested we go here. We ordered dosas, Masala and plain, idli and a South Indian meal. 
The idlis and dosas were evergreen. The outstanding part of the evening was the South Indian meal ( Rasam, rice,  curd, sambhar, papad, vegetable curries , pickle, puris and a sweet.) I felt transported to my South Indian meal experiences down south. I am a great fan of rasam chawal combined with papad. This meal satiated my craving for the traditional South Indian meal just perfectly. 

Will be visiting more often. The pricing is perfect considering quality and taste of food.

However my most recent visit to this place for my morning breakfast changed my opinion. Food was back to it's top place again. I love the chutneys they give. I ordered a paper cheese dosa with my friends and it was great too. My friends also enjoyed the experience. Service is fast and good. Only suggestion is to be consistent in your food.

Being a regular in the lake market area for quite a while, I have been to Banana Leaf two times only, which is quite sad. The quantity of food they serve is simply mind-blowing. On my first visit, I had the milk shake with ice cream and sada dosa. Let me tell you, I have never seen a bigger glass of milk shake ever in my life in any eatery. The dosa was quite satisfactory, but the the price was a bit on the higher side. On my second visit, I had tried the South Indian Meal, and for Rs. 180, that South Indian Thali was a monster. The quantity of food they provided in that thali was simply too much. The price is in no way justified. But then again, I love to eat, and i love to take time in eating what i like. So i ended up finishing it and calling a cab home because walking was simply not possible after that meal. The staff's behavior could have been better, but the food  quality makes everyone excuse that. Thank you for a great (quite literally) meal.

Had been there yesterday evening. I had been here earlier too. Place is immaculately clean, as it used to be. Had a plate of sada  vada & 2 coffee. Got a masala dosa packed for my son. The waiter told bill amount 260/-. On paying the amount asked for bill, which despite of more than five minutes waiting he did not provide. Something fishy.  The dosa I got for my son is half the size of the one provided at the restaurant. Aloo masala was sufficient but the size of the dosa was disappointing. Seems I have been taken for a ride by the waiter.

I am awfully late in writing a review for this place. Because it has been a while... Around june I visited this place while I took our onsite landscape manager to have lunch in here.. I had no idea what the hype was all about.. Because its literally inside a dingy kind of lane in the lake market area ane looks nothing like the nice place it is (inside).. I know some would think i was little generouos to rate them 4 but the 0.5 was for the clean restrooms!! Coming back to food, we had gone on a weekday so couldn't avail the special meal but what they served us were two thalis... With a lot of small bowls filled with yummy looking ( and smelling) veggies, daal, rasam, sambhar, sewai, chutney, curd etc.. They served 4 puri and rice... It was the best south Indian meal I ever had.. Even the client herself ( who by the way is a Tamilian NRI) confessed- " I lived in Bangalore and chennai, but I couldn't believe I would say this- this is the best sambhar I had in this trip!" So there you go. :)

Everything tastes good. The highlight of the mini meal were masala stuffed and fried dry red chillies. The idli had a very appeasing tang. The sambhar was thick and wholesome. The chutney had the perfect balance of green chilli spice. And the buttermilk complemented every food item we ate.

What to order? The Rava masala dosas and the cheese utapam for sure. They're definitely gonna make your taste buds happy by the time you leave, and the pricing is fair as well.

I thought of trying Banana Leaf to satisfy my sudden South Indian food craving since I have heard a lot about this place. It was packed when we reached but luckily enough we were led to another room which also became full within 15mins. The menu is quite elaborate. We ordered Onion Cheese Uttapam and Cheese Butter Masala Dosa. Both were delicious and quite filling. They serve authentic South Indian dishes. I liked the way the food is served in stainless steel utensils with a banana leaf on the plate. We also ordered lassi. I did not like the lassi much. The consistency of the curd is worth mentioning. It was definitely good but I have tasted better lassi. Overall a great experience. Would surely come back again.

A good place for south Indian cuisine. It really tasted good with the mixture of aaloo and it was a bit spicy. But the 'posto' served as a dip tasted a bit sour.
Price will be Rs 450 for 3 heads.

 Ambience and service is fine. Good place for vegetarians.

Great place to have south Indian vegetarian dishes. . ..I am not a dosa loving guy like my family....but still the food is probably the best when it comes to south veg regular dishes....yes you won't find a chetnad chicken here ...just snaking stuff. The staff is humble and ambience is perfect !!! So thumbs up

Located near lake market, this is also one of the few famous south Indian restaurants that are well known for their authenticity. Unfortunately my experience has always been bad and hence I give it two stars. The ambience is just that of a typical south Indian restaurant, there is no logic in dividing the place into two halves.
The waiters are courteous but the manager definitely needs training. I complained about their food and I've never received the kind of backlash I received at this particular place.
Coming to the food

I tried the mini meal and the thali and I wouldn't recommend both of them.

The dosas are very regular, the idli though was better and the vada was the biggest disappointment. Half cooked inside and burnt outside.

Their upma is something I was satisfied with.
The uttapam wasn't upto the mark.
The filter coffee is not recommended.
I have no idea why this place is so over rated on zomato. It is a very regular south Indian place.
Not recommended.

MUST VISIT SOUTH-INDIAN RESTAURANT IN THE ENTIRE KOLKATA CITY!!! Tucked in a quite lane near the Lake Market, but do not mistake its size with the quality of food served. For that perfect balance of taste, its each and every menu item is a must try. You will be only happy to see their menu at the first place...so many varieties to choose from!! Each and every dish is made eith extreme care without excess oil or spices. Fresh produce gives that authentic aroma to their dishes. On the top of this...its damn easy on the pocket too!!!

This place is a family favourite. Its the one place I've found with great Kerala parotta and iddiyappam in cal as opposed to the usual dosas and idlis available everywhere, which are also done well here.
Added to that clean place with good service.

But try the 
Kerala parotta
Iddiyapam with korma
Paniriyappam
The set meals.
End it with the classic south Indian udipi filter coffee.

With the entrance at the side of the building , the place can be a little difficult to find , the ambiance is nothing great also , however it is very clean . Had masala dosa , it was just very normal being a bit too bland , sambar and chutney were refilled continuously . Had a south indian coffee too which was ok .

If you are craving for some South Indian food then Banana Leaf is the place. Excellent food compared to the price. It is a pocket friendly family restaurant. The only thing is the filter coffee is not upto the mark. Going by the ambience its nothing extraordinary. Its just a normal eatery where you get good south indian food at a low price. 
Loved the masala dosa and the onion uttapam there.

If not for anything else I will keep going back there for the Bisibelle Bhat and Kurma Parota. Two dishes I miss hugely from my Bengaluru days. And what I get here is almost the same tastewise.

Ambiance is normal, the dining hall comfortable and clean. The service is fast most of the times.

Most of their items are tasty and good. I love their Rasam Idly, Butter Milk, Upma and Uttapams. Among Dosas I love the Dhania Dosa here. Not all items are served throughout the day or on all days. So if you want to try something special, check their menu before visiting the place.

I only wish they introduce the thicker Dosas, which I think are tastier. I personally am not a big fan of paper dosas. Also they should serve appam and idiyappam throughout the day and not only for dinner.

In all a great place for trying vegetarian South Indian food.

Banana leaf is a south indian restaurant chain and since myself being a great fan of south indian food I had to visit this place. I always wanted to visit this place but never got a chance to visit any of its food chain. Finally got a chance to visit this place in there lake market chain. The ambiance was of typical south indian restaurant with great simplicity.We ordered idly dosai  uttapam and filter coffee everything was nicely prepared and service from the staff too was great.

It has been quite a long time since I have visited this restaurant, in fact, this particular review is for our last visit 2-3 months back.
My wife and I wanted to have south Indian breakfast and we dropped in this place.
It is located at the heart of lakemarket just on the main road. We both have been to this place many a times in the past. It has a simple charm of its own.
The attendants here are well mannered and service is fast. The ambience is typical of any south Indian restaurant, calm, orderly n business. 
Though south Indian food ain't my favourite, yet this place serves pretty awesome dosas.
That day I went for my usual choice of cheese onion rava masala dosa and my wife for a cheese onion dosa. We were served with the food in no time. As famished we were in the morning, the smell and taste of the molten cheese wrapped under the rava cover of the dosa tasted pure bliss to my taste n olfactory buds. However, the extra amount of cheese in their cheese dosa can get too cheesy after sometime. :P
But then this is the only dosa I like.
We ended our affair with a typical filter coffee. This place is a hassle free restaurant for your dosa cravings.
Ps 400 bux for 2 ppl

This is my first visit in this place however I have always known about this from a very long time but I am dissappointed with the food. The decor n ambience is OK but the cheese masala dosa n podi cheese masala dosa that we ordered was not upto the mark. I had been to Prema Vilas just 3 days back which is just next to it and when I compare the cheese masala dosa of BL to PV, the masala of the dosa and the sambar both are bland. PV is much better as far as food quality n taste is concerned. Even the size is smaller here than PV. I recommend Prema Vilas n not Banana leaf.

When you've had a grandfather who has had a significant part of his life, spent in the southern parts of India,  you cannot stay away from this place. Its been over a decade since I have been coming to this place and it has delightfully remain unchanged. 

The menu is quite interesting considering it offers a wide range of Dosas, Uttapams & Idlis.  Over the years I have had quite a few of them and the following are the ones to try out :

1. The Family Dosa : This is a huge Dosa which spans almost two to two and a half feet across the length of the table and served with generous servings of Sambhar, Coconut Chutney and a Vegetable Mash. 
2. The South Indian Meal : This is an all time favorite of mine when I am very hungry. Puris and Rice served with A Papad,  Raita, Dahi, Rasam, Sambhar and 3 different kinds of vegetable preparation, which keep changing daily. All of the things served are given as many helpings as you can eat,  except the papad. 
3. Ghee Roast Dosa : This is exquisite. The smell of the Ghee makes it very appetizing,  especially when you dip the bits in cold and spicy,  coconut Chutney. 
4. Mini Tiffin : Perfect to be a child's meal or an adult's snack. It contains a small dosa , one idli, a fried vada, a serving of upma and a serving of their signature halwa.  
5. Bisbella Bhat : Basically a khichudi made of five different lentils and served with two papads. Scrumptious when piping hot. 
6. Kuchi Paniyaram : Mini idlis with bits of onion,  chillies and curry leaves, deep fried in coconut oil. A must try. 
7. Cheese Dosa : The name itself is enough to explain how delicious this is. 


Well these are a few of my favorite things from the menu. 

The only thing that bugs me is when the place is crowded the cleanliness takes a dive and the serves tend to get overwhelmed and inattentive. That's why I am not giving the place a 4.5. 

And did I say, this place is cheap? 😁

My personal favorite is their Idli, Upma and Mysore Masala Dosa. The best part is the food is cooked well and served clean. Sometimes u may even try their tea and the perfect South Indian Coffee. Overall the place is good from enjoying a perfect South Indian Food.

This is a South indian restaurant located just opposite the lake mall.Personally I am not such a lover of South indian dishes,however the food here was okayish. 
Going by the ambience its a bit shabby. We tried the Cheese Masala dosa, Uttapam platter and curd vada.Thr cheese masala dosa was good with a fair amount of cheese and stuffings.Tge coconut chutney was good however the sambar daal I felt was not up to that mark.The uttapam platter consisted of 5different types of which i personally like the panner one.The curd vada was the popular bengali dish (Doi bora) however without the usual masala,which as ut may sound weird was not at all intaste.
They serve the food in plates wrapped with coconut leaves as is the culture of South India.The waiters are courteous and helpful and service was prompt.
Over in all if u are a south indian dish lover with a tight pocket u can surely check this place out.

Some of the best south Indian food in town, decent price, great variety, good and fast service, tasty food, good quality and quantity. Their thali's are brilliant. You may have to stand in line for a little while because it can get busy especially after 1 PM for lunch. Also you may want to check your bill before you pay in case they forgot to charge you for something you ordered.

We ordered Paper masala dosa and Masala dosa. The masala was sweet and chetney was high on musturd. It was so not authentic south indian dish. I would suggest not to visit here.

After a whole day shopping at gariahat,we were craving for food badly. And made a plan to visit this place.. This is my first visit here. We ordered cheese masala Dosa,onion tomato uttapam, appam and vada. Their service was fast...the Dosa was yummy,the cheese felt so good with the Dosa..I tried appam for the first time.. It was served along with coconut milk and 2 bowl of sambar. You have to apply the coconut milk to appam first,it made the appam really soft and tender and then have it with sambar. It tasted okyish. The vada & uttapam was really tasty. The price is reasonable..we had lassi and coffee afterwards. Both tasted good. I am a big fan of South Indian cousine, and I must say if you are searching for authentic South Indian dishes...visit this place. The ambiance is good,calm & the staff service can be better. Overall a good experience.

Banana Leaf has been offering fresh, delicious South Indian staples to Kolkata’s foodies since 2002... Here you can try a range of traditional bites, like idlys, vadas, dosas or the exquisite uttapams.....

Well, this was a great experience! Banana Leaf is easily traceable, located right by the main road. Its a humble and simple place, good enough to concentrate only on the food. Service is a bit slow, given the crowd it draws. But otherwise no complains. We ordered Paneer Masala Dosa, Mysore Masala Dosa, Cheese Podi Masala, Molgapodi with till oil, Kesari sweet and filter coffee. The molgapodi is a concoction of daal and spices when mixed with till oil, it serves as a taste enhancing chutney. One should order this no matter what your choice from the menu is. The kesari sweet is again a very sweet mixture of sugar syrup, sooji and kesar. It does taste yummmm! And off course the coffee comes in a steel glass sitting on a bowl for you to pour back and forth to froth it.  Well that was quite a filling serve. We packed the  curd rice, which was light and authentic too. Next time wish to try the fried idlis tho! Wish you a great time!

And the ambience is apt as its not that expensive but the way the food is served gives a south Indian feel.
The filter coffee was also really good as the fragrance of coffee is still there.

We chose to pack Butter Onion Masala Rava Dose from here on 20th April and below are the pointers.

The Dose itself was the biggest disappointment as it was not crispy at all when we ate it (which was within an hour). I had a great experience with another joint recently(we had also packed it up) and wanted the same here.

The white chutney had also gone bad when we tried consuming it along with with the dosa.

However,the masala and Sambhar met our expectations for the day.

I guess the best thing to do here is to sit and eat your meal  (which I'm not a fan of as I mostly prefer food to either be home delivered or taken away).

I'm not being too harsh with the rating as I would like to taste the food while being seated there.I have done that in the past though but don't really have enough to comment as it's been a while.

This south indian restaurant located just opposite to Lake market. I have visited this place several times. Food quality is good. The butter milk is is excellent today. But unfortunately taste the abovesaid item vary day to day. Among other beverages coffee is average. Fruit juice is average also. 
1. Idli is of good quality and tastes very well. If you like spicy food you must try molgapudi idli. Mini idli is one of my favourite. This are plain rice idli, small in size. This idlis have a buttery feeling.
2. Dosas here, are of great variety. Today I took cheese onion dosa. Tastes good and had a creamy feeling inside mouth. Mysore masala dosa is also good.
3. Uttapam: according to me you can get better Uttapam elsewhere.
4. Thali: looks great when they serve it on table. Specially you  should try special south indian thali, available only on Sunday lunch time. 
5. Rice items like tomato rice,  bisabela rice etc is average.
6. If you have lots of time and you want to spend time in this restaurant you can try Kuzi paniyarum (I think I spelled it correct). This is kind of fried idli. Good for single try.
7. Rava Dosas are good to taste.
One thing I forgot to mention- sambar and coconut chutney. These are one of the best sambar and chutney I have had in Kolkata.
Ambience and decoration is ok ok.
This restaurant is also pocket friendly.

This place is a real paradise for south Indian cuisine lovers.

We visit this place when ever we visit Kolkata.

The quality and portion size is the real plus point for this restaurant.
Service can somehow be improved in pace.

We have tried Idlis , wadas , dosas , uthappams and of course beverages..


The top menu item is the Molgapudi idlis.
There gunpowder is simply amazing. 
And the blend that is creates in Til oil is too good.
Another dish I recommend is the Uthappams
Really fresh batter ( can be observed by the fluffiness) 

And of course the filter coffee .
South Indian meal is incomplete without the coffee.

Quality 5/5
Service 4/5
Cleanliness 4/5
Value for money 4.5/5

Overall 4.5/5

I have deducted points in service coz I feel speed of service can be improved

A must visit for family dinner 
Avoid weekends as there is usually waiting period of around 20-30 minutes on weekends

Been to this place a few times and nothing was special about it.
The idli are decent. The uttapams are just so so. The dosa is nice. The meal are not upto the mark. Their basic sambar and chutney is not well done. They have to work hard to stand among other good places nearby.

Go for the Cheese Butter Masala Dosa. Its very good. Even if you have south indian food (Like i do) you will fall far it.. I also took Sada Vada. (I have the soggy sambar vada). followed by coffee. 
Banana Leaf ambiance is too Tamil. Sparkling white and glass. and a typical south indian smell. This restaurant is around for a while and a favourite of many  Once in a while it is indeed a treat. I will keep visiting this place and recommend it to all those who love south indian.

Well was the first visit to the place, after all the hype and reviews , but sorry to say that it was probably the last visit. First of all , we were 5 of us,and made to sit in an enclosed dining area adjoining the main dining place. Almost most of the tables were occupied and only 1 person taking orders from all the tables .  Ordered for a mini thali, dhania masala dosa, rice idly and masala dosa. The food arrived in less than 5 minutes and then got to see the real face of a overhyped  restaurant.  Everything served on the table was ice cold and on inquiring the reason for it we were informed that since we were taking time to place the order the rest of the confirmed order was already informed about in the kitchen and been prepared. The reason no where near to justify the problem. The Dania dosa had become soggy as well because of the excess layering of green chutney inside. We refused to accept the masala dosa , they got it replaced, but this time it was very oily and we left it in half. Inspire of all this has ordered for a uttapam platter , as we were very hungry, but the person taking orders was so confused ,trying to reach to everyone, that finally we didnt get platter. Overall i shouldn't be rating them this marks also after such a worst experience. Advise to others that we have better places for south Indian food in the city.

I can't get enough of Banana Leaf.
Their food is amazing, fresh lime soda and a masala dosa goes down well at any time.
The young men that do the table service are always polite and do a great job even though they are constantly run off their feet busy!
This place makes me want to return to Kolkata ASAP!

A good South Indian eatery in Kolkata. The dosas and the thali are good but the buttermilk that they serve here is amazing. Having a glass of buttermilk after lunch can be quite refreshing. The place can get quite crowded and uneasy to sit in. Some days it can take a lot of time before they can accommodate you inside. The place is a little small which I found to be the greatest detractor from this great experience.

Ah! What a delight this place is. Clean, simple, spacious, huge seating arrangement, yet weekends have 1-2 hr long waiting queue, not a surprise sinc the place is so gud and well located. Food: thali is a must have, too much food that I skipped dinner aftr a lunch here. Even the tiffin n mini thali just perfect. I would highly recommend for super yummy southy food.

This is one place I haven't visited much. But I can assure you that this place serves one of the best dosas in town. They crazily have an innovation added to the simple dosa you have on a regular basis. 
So for some authentic South Indian breakfast, this should be your destination.

A slightly overrated restaurant. Though it has a pleasant ambience and serves better food than the other South Indian joints in the area, I must say that there are better South Indian restaurants across the city. Had ordered cheese masala dosa, which hardly had any cheese. The dosas were very soft and not the papery kind you get elsewhere. Would suggest this place for its quick service and reasonable prices!

There food is just awesome. Apart from the idlis and dosas, they also serve south indian meals. I recently tried the mini meal...which was very good....it had three variety of rice dishes (my fav tomato rice) :).....it also had a sweet dish which was very tasty.
Their dhaniya cheese masala dosa is also nice. So, looking forward to visit this place again...

Went there specially for the South Indian Meals...which comprises of unlimited puri, rice, papad, 2 types of dal, 2 types of sabji, rasam, raita, curd, pickle, payasam...Yummyyy !!! The taste is 90% authentic being in Kolkata. Moreover, u will also get to see quite a few Tamil speaking people there to get more of that Chennai wala feeling. Price is reasonable and really polite staffs.

The ambience was very nice- neat and sober. We ordered cheese onion masala dosa, butter milk and in sweets they served a halwa which was the best part of the meal! The colour of the halwa was fascinating! The whole meal was very pocket friendly. I think I'm going to visit this place again, very soon!

Needless to say that it is, without a hint of doubt, one of the most renowned South Indian food joints in southern Calcutta. 
Ordered a number of items which are discussed below:
(01) Rice Idly (the two large pieces of idlis were served hot with two different types of sambhar and a coconut chutney. The idlis were soft and fluffy, something that would give even the ones, exclusively made in south of India, a run for their quality and texture)
(02) Cheese Onion Uttapam (I had had uttapams before, but this one was so unique in itself. Uttapam, prepared with onions, had a plenty of grated cheese spread over it. The size was three quarters of the plate in which it was served)
(03) Cheese Rava Dosa (rava dosa coated with cheese and folded in a triangular fashion was all the more succulent when savoured with coconut chutney)
(04) Paper Butter Dosa (plain and simple dosa with the addition of butter here)
The one thing that catches attention is that, all the dishes are served here with the banana leaf spread over the plate - which is actually the wont in the restaurants in southern India and which has also, perhaps, inspired the christening of this food joint.

Located in South Kolkata,Banana leaf is one of the best South Indian joints in the city.Went there for lunch and had to wait a good 20 or more minutes till our turn came,yes it is that popular.Place was bustling with people.
   Ordered the good old masala dosa.Also the south Indian thali and the mini thali for kid.In simple words it was plain and honest good food.One of the best dosas that I have tried,really big and tasty.Thali food was fresh and wholesome,very home-like.Recommended.However surprisingly what had me hooked was the buttermilk ,had about 3-4 glasses,it was so refreshing.Gonna be visiting the place again,soon.

We tried their traditional South Indian Thali..nothing extra ordinary about food..The rasam and the white coloured curry was worth trying..ambience was good..I dont know why this restaurant is so over hyped in zomato. I have been to many South Indian restaurants before, had sumptious meals, but Banana Leaf couldn't live upto my expectations.Anyways, want to try South Indian food in the land of fish and sweets, give it a try.

Banana Leaf one of the top rank south India restaurant in south Kolkata is located in Lake Market area. We are a common visitor there our main dish there is the Onion Masala Dosa.
Some times we do go for Masala Vada and Sambar Vada. The Sambar which is a form of South Indian dal is very good to have. Moreover the plates were served with banana leaves which actually coincides with the name of the restaurant. our kid enjoyed a lot

Trust me when i say, Banana Leaf is undoubtedly the best south indian restaurant in kolkata. Everything about them is praiseworthy. Located opposite to Lake Mall in Lake Market, it has a large seating capacity with nice hospitality from the staff. The main attraction is ofcourse the mouth watering food in a very reasonable price.  Being an all veg and authentic south indian food joint, they serve deliciously soft idlis, Varieties of fresh dosas, uttapams, thalis,desserts and many more. The main attractions being rasam idli, onion tomato chilli utthapam, kaju uttapam, south indian thali with varieties of curry rasam chutneys, mini meal (with roti, curry, haluwa, curd rice, bisabela bhat and one more) and dhania dosa. They also serve delicious butter milk (just try it for once!). They dont serve appam and other south indian food items which contain non veg stuff. I do visit them regularly and everyone should visit atleast once if you are a fan of authentic south indian delicacies.

Another south indian restaurant with good ambiance. I had tried the cheese dhosa which turned out to be really good. Could get the taste of perfectly melted cheese inside. They served the idly hot and soft. One of the best idly i've tasted here.Rates are pocket friendly. I went there on Christmas and still got good food. The only thing the dhosas lacked was the crispyness on the edges..

Located in lake market area opposite lake mall, this is an awsome south indian restuarant. Their dosas are delectable. No doubt we often faced a queue but its worth waiting. Specially the cheese onion masala dosa needs mention. They offer a south indian thali...quite apprehensive at first to try, we ordered and realised what we were missing! About 6 to 7 authentic south indian dishes comprise the thali, each having its unique taste. Do visit and make sure to order a thali, its incredible for south indian cuisine lovers.

Graet Location. Simple ambience. But food is not so great. It was not even hot. I took Masala Dhosa and Vada and found vadas to be very small in size. The road side vendors at the opposite road conner offer the same quality of food of same quantity at the 1/4th of the price. Well folks it is only good if you want some private time just sit in the corner have some snacks and coffee. Otherwise you know where you get the value for money.

After living in Chennai for 4years, SothIndian cuisine has become one my favourites. Hence, when I came back to kolkata, I was searching for a place where I can get some authentic SouthIndian food. Kolkata has too many restaurants and street joints where you can get items in there menu from the southern part of India. But there are too few places where you can get that authentic taste. This is one of those places which serves you that real taste of SouthIndia. There price is legitimate and service is pleasing. When I went there today I found some people who were speaking in Tamil, believe me after coming back from Chennai it was a delight to listen to their conversation. So if you like authentic SouthIndian food like me, just give it a try.

In my books the difference between a pretender and the original lies in the details.

For a vegetarian South Indian restaurant,one of the prime details remain the sambar.It can be the difference between mediocrity and excellence.Sadly the sambar was quite bland here.

The chutneys,gunpowder,tomato and green chutneys add a lot of variety to your idly and vadai.None was offered.

i opted for the onion butter masala dosa.It was filled with so much raw onion that would have made a butter chicken proud.Awkward.

I had coffee which was good but cold.

Sorry,I would prefer the oldies like Prema Vilas and Ramkrishna Lunch Home in the vicinity.

This review is not about any particular day, just want to mention that we frequently visit this place for a nice spread of south indian thali meal, the most authentic one can get in south kolkata - and that too available both during lunch and dinner time, my daughter is of course very fond of their crisp Mandir dosa with the delicious chutneys as the accompaniments... Banana leaf provides quality food at very affordable prices, however, I must say, the upkeep of the place has got a beating over the years..

My mum took me today to this joint because she really likes the food here and hence wanted me to try it out. The green colour entrance was very inviting indeed and the inside of the place was very simple yet clean and comfortable. We ordered 1 idly vada,  sada paper dosa,  cheese masala dosa and also 1 special chutney. All the items were excellent. The vada was the best till date i had it was so crispy and tasty that I loved it. The idly was also very soft and did not feel dry in mouth. The cheese masala dosa was damn good and it had ample amount of cheese in it hence very filling. The sada paper dosa was big in size and crispy just the way I want it but before taking a picture  my mum crushed it in half :( we wanted to try dahi vada but our stomach was full to the brink so we had to ask for the bill which was around rs. 340. The accompaniments that is, the sambar, chutney and special chutney were also tasty. The staffs are well behaved and polite and the service is also quite fast. Overall a nice lunch experience.

The typical legends of the southern delicacies. Had a great taste, good prices and the typical southern atmosphere. I Tried many of their specialty dosas. Personal favorite being Paneer Onion Butter Masala Dosa. One thing is they serve huge portions and its more than enough for me. Have been eyeing for their thalis for ages, they look drool worthy, but again the quantity is so much that I am afraid I won't be able to finish it.  I love their food and the ambiance is very good. Highly recommended for south Indian food lovers.

One of my most frequented lunch heavens, when I am around Lake Market area !!! 

When I am really hungry, I blindly order their 'Thali'...without even asking/waiting for the menu card. The unlimited Puri(made of Atta) & sabji, to start-with, in the Thali, would make you feel like God should have given us the power to adjust our stomach size according to our wish, so that we could have justified such lunches...post Puri-n-sabji here come unlimited Rice, Sambar, Rasam, 2-3 types of Veg Curries, Achar/Pickle, Curd, Papad, Halwa, Payasam...

When I am moderately hungry, I go for "Bisibeli Baat" - a delicious 'kichdi' sort of made from Sambar, rice, good lot of diced vegetables, served with raita & papad.

Their Onion Utthapam is also one of my favourites, which many at times drag me there, around evening, followed by the signature Coffee.

Price point-wise you may find the place little costlier based on our pre-conceived mindset of South Indian Food = Cheap Food !!! However, well controlled all round AC, hygienic eating ambience, prompt service would possibly trade the price point off...

By definition, the word overrated doesnt necessarily qualify mediocrity. It simply means that something is rated a little (or a lot) higher in prevailing collective opinion than in the opinion of the person describing.

Banana Leaf (Rashbehari Avenue, Lake Market) is overrated in the pristine sense. Have been visiting Banana Leaf for the last many years; never once wowed by any offering: appam korma, uttapam, south indian meal, idli, vada, dosas or butter milk/lassi. The filter coffee, though, is top notch. The service is excruciatingly slow when there's a crowd (read: practically everytime).

Having said that, it has never disappointed except, probably, the first time I went after hearing rave reviews in 2011. Thankfully, success hasn' gotten into the wrong places and the prices have always been reasonable.

A safe bet for South Indian food. Nothing more. There are better options like Pai's Malgudi, Jyoti Vihar, The Chutney Co and many more.

Visited during durga puja this year. The staffs were good. Ambience too was good enough. 
Though I am not a big fan of south indian but one of my friend recommended me this place.
Ordered cheese masala dosa. They took near about 15 minutes to serve. I liked the traditional banana leaf over the plate. 
Didnot find anything very special about the dosa. Cheese toppings were not melted.. I am not sure that they should or not, but the curry inside was good. Without curry leaves though. Specially I liked the chutney with coconut and roasted musturd seeds. 
Overall was satisfied with the hygine and quality of materials used. 
Will visit soon to try the south indian thali.

This is another South Indian restaurant in the  Lake market area. It is well maintained and the ambience is the best among the 3-4 other joints serving south indian food. Moreover I think it is the most popular one as it is always almost full....must be the locational advantage. But the food is just ok. Nothing bad but not great either. Nothing to rave about. The idlis were good..white,soft ones. But the coconut chutney was quite watery and the taste wasn't good either. The sambar wad ok. They only serve one chutney unlike others who serve three kinds. The sada dosa was also ok.(nothing great).I prefer the sada dosa at Udipi which is really good. The onion Uttapam was also just ok. As I said nothing wrong with the food but nothing stands out either. Chutney needs a lot of improvement.

After hearing a lot about this place from my peers about how authentic their food is, I visited Banana leaf this puja with my bestie. We had ordered puri sabji, dahi bhalla and a sweet ( it didn't specify in the menu card). The puri sabji was excellent and so was the sweet which turned out to be highly coloured version of halwa. But the dahi bhalla was not good. The curd had turned bitter and the vada was no good. I was very skeptical as over fermented curd results in food poisioning. When i informed the waiter about this, he couldn't care less. I was disappointed and left the place thinking about my health. The next day, there was no trace of indigestion or gastroenteritis. So, although the curd's taste was offensive, the bacteria wasn't. The thali seemed to be a very popular choice amongst others so one can try that. Another hit seemed to be the dosa. Well if there is a next time, I shall try those two.

I like having south indian food for breakfast. I had been here for a Sunday brunch. Good quality food served here but service was a but slow( may be because of being overcrowded due to Sunday). I liked the vada more than anything but Did not like lassi as it was too sweet to taste. Overall a good experience!

Its a paradise for South Indian food lovers! Located exactly on the main road opposite to lake market on rash behari avenue. They have these mini power combos called 'Mini Tiffin' which gives you a glimpse of what this place has to offer. Very pocket friendly and lot of choices. I love south indian food and this place will never disappoint. Thalis offers a range of options from regular puri to dosas. They serve in large portions which is quite enough to cool down the rat inside. This place often packed with people, good food, good ambiance, homely with all the hustle and bustle you would expect in a family restaurant.

I love South Indian food. So i love Banana Leaf. Period. Its my favorite South Indian cuisine restaurant in Kolkata. Tried many of their specialty dosas and uttapams. Personal favorite being Paneer Onion Butter Masala Dosa and Onion Tomato uttapam. One thing is they serve huge portions and its more than enough for my little appetite. Have been eyeing for their thalis for ages, they look drool worthy, but again the quantity is so much that I am afraid I wont be able finish it. Anyways, I love this place, I love their staff, I love their food and the ambiance is quite homely with the continuous hustle and bustle.

The food here is good. We had Mysore masala dosa n paper cheese masala dosa.. The first was on the spicier side while the latter was filled with cheese. The sambar n chutney was really good.
The ambience wasn't really great but it is a good place for friends to hang out.
The service was POOR. I was really pissed off by the end of my meal. They didn't refill the water glasses. Neither for the sambar n chutney. When we asked the waiter for sambar, he nodded and went and never came back. 
The coffee was way below average.
Last and the very least was the sweet dish, which was suji ka halwa. It was horrible. Artificial colour. Sticky and horribly gooey. 

But then I'd go back again for the Dosas.. I really hope they up their  service.

This is what my review was 7 months back:

This place serves the right kind of typical south Indian cuisine. Look no where else. Just try out any kind of food starting from paper masala dosa to dahi vada. Everything is awesome!

This is what my review is after today's experience:

Ordered a cheese masala dosa and suddenly I found out there was a cheese wrapper inside the dosa. Told the staff about it, the man was quite casual about it and said 'Oh ye toh cheese ka wrapper hai, change kar de?' I asked him 'Do you think it should have been in the dosa in the first place?' He answered like as if its nothing and said 'change kar denge'. And my goodness, everybody is in there own world. Ask for a glass of water to the first man, he forgets and soon the same thing needs to be asked from the second man. Ask the third man for tissues, he forgets, ask the same thing to the first man. And it goes on and on throughout placing order, asking for refills, etc. 
Okay because the food is good out here, I overlooked the mismanagement. Ordered a suji sweet dish over there. Didn't touch it even. Couldn't eat so told a man to pack it, along with another box of the sweet dish. First of the all, when I came back home, I saw a 'hair' in the box. Secondly, I am attaching a picture with this review. Looking at the quantity of the two box, you will be amazed. One box containing the sweet that I didn't even touch has hardly got anything as compared to the other box which I asked them to pack extra. So have you guys been cheating the ones eating at the restaurant with the quantity as compared to the packing to be done for home, which costs the same money?
This used to be one of my favorite south Indian restaurants in town, but trust me three loopholes on the same day, the cheese wrapper, the hair and the amazingly differentiating quantity of the sweet packets has disappointed me. No matter how good the food is, if hygiene and staff grooming isn't done properly, it will turn out to be worse. Management, do something about it!

Okay, here I paid a visit only recently and I thoroughly loved it. It's got a world of South Indian dishes. So if you are a sucker for dosas and idly then do care to explore this one. The restaurant is located at the Lake Market area. It ostensibly seems like a hole in the wall.  But as you walk through the little alley the first thing you observe is the cleanliness. We had ordered South Indian filtered coffee, South Indian special chutney and rava plain and rava onion masala dosas. They were finger-licking. They serve the way they are authentically served in South India, on a nice banana leaf. Similarly the coffee is served and sipped the way they do in South India. The place has the South Indian essence speaking through its minimalist and true decor. The service is also good and quick. It seems like a well-managed one. I give it a thumbs-up.
P.S One problem with this restaurant is the unconscionable time they take to pack the food you order for home. We waited really long albeit they maintain a clean separate area with adequate seating arrangements. Also considering its close to Gariahat it's no brainer to imagine that it attracts a lot of people by the evening. So don't be astonished if you are asked to take seats outside and wait for your turn.

So another south indian restaurant @ kolkata.
Name is very catchy so the same reason i went there. Food is good but i would say not the best south indian food in kolkata. Dosa's are good and meals are not bad. Ambience is nothing great just a normal hotel. Service is again not so great since due to the rush they get at peak time.Location its in the heart of lake market so bit hard to find.Rates are normal not high and reasonable. So final verdict worth for one time visit to have dosa's thats all.

Banana Leaf is a very famous South Indian food outlet in Lake Market area. I have been there several times. It is crowded all through the day even with the large seating arrangement.

The food here is great and cheap, extreme value for money.
The portion size and quantity is very good.
I have tried quite a few items here, of which  I would recommend the Paper Masala Dosa, Mini Idlis, Filter Coffe, Sada Vada etc.

It is a great place for South Indian lovers, though cleanliness can be an issue for some.

I was not a great fan of South Indian delicacies, but I guess the fondness never grew because I have never had authentic south Indian food before. Banana Leaf gave me that experience.
We reached there quite late in the afternoon, yet the queue was long enough to keep us waiting for around 15 mins.
The inside was clean and simple, we ordered quickly and the food arrived fast. Order was, Masala Onion Rawa Dosa and Masala Onion Cheese Rawa Dosa for drinks, one lassi and sweet lime soda. The Dosas were yum ! The Masala smelled awesome and it was stuffed with cheese completely. 
One Dosa a person was more than enough for the my lunch and I was totally full. The bill came out to be 400 something, which was really cheap, considering the quality of the good.
I would definitely come back here or try their other outlets. 
Strongly recommended !

After a long and tiring Darshan at Kalighat, we arrived here and we're pleasantly surprised that South Indian food had such a huge following in Kolkata. I liked the restaurant for being bold and going all south. I ordered my favorite Onion Rava Dosa. It was served with Sambar and Coconut Chutney. Being used to a variety of chutneys - green red and what not, I had to settle for just the white Coconut Chutney. But it was more than what I expected at this city, truly making it a City of Joy :-)

The dosas were so-so nothing to get over excited about it. The place was clean and quite good in all aspect, though the dishes are overpriced.

Just returned from the Banana Leaf after a very satisfying dinner with mom after a check-up at the doctor's clinic gave us good news :)
My mom is a stickler for vegetarian food and spotless cleanliness..though she's not much of a fan of Udupi Cuisine yet I took her Banana Leaf because I wanted her to celebrate keeping her standards intact :)
The restaurant is bang on the main road but housed inside Komala Vilas. Unless one knows the name of the building finding the restaurant without help is a bit of a bummer.
Nevertheless, spotless interiors and the very clean kitchen caught our eyes and I saw her smile up as she sank into one of those rather high but comfortable seats. The place shows its age yet its very well kept, I must say.
The young waiters hanging around were very polite and quick, and served us with a smile on their faces. We wanted to try things different than the standard Masala Dosa and their suggestions were bang on.
We went for the Mysore Butter Masala Dosa (for mom) and a Mini Idly (for me). We also went for a strong Filter Coffee on their suggestion. 
They goofed up orders initially and served us both Mysore Dosas, but immediately cleaned up their act with a fair bit of apologizing. I like it that someone or other was always around to take care of any whim one might have. And not to say the heavy steel tumblers and utensils, spotlessly clean again. 
My mini idly came first, tiny little idlis, each of the size of a large batasha, with two bowls of Sambar and one of coconut chutney. The chutney was otherworldly heavenly goodness. Loved the freshness and grind on them, oozing salty, soothing milk the moment one chomped on them. I loved it to bits.
The Sambar was thick, spicy, a hint bit more sour but chunky with generous amount of lentil and vegetable, and a not too strong whiff of curry leaf. Perfect for dipping the idli in and eat.
The idly....oh, the idly! tiny soft tasty pieces absolutely done right. and the size perfect to snack on innocuously while chatting.
Meanwhile, mom's Mysore dosa came in, smelling strongly of butter and spices. The crust was a bit thicker than the normal but then it stood up strong when doused with chutney and sambar, no mean feat that!
The spice layered in the crust was assertive but not burn your face off. The filling had lots of cooked, sweet onions, potatoes and carrots and tomatoes and it was mild but tasty enough to eat on its own. Not a hint bland and I would love to eat a bowl of it with Puri.
Filter coffee came perfectly towards the end, creamy, not too sweet coffee, with a very strong flavour of infusion in it.  Perfect pick me up.

The bill came at ₹245 for all this, and we totally stuffed folks rolled ou promising that we would come back for the thalus, the halwa, the mollgapodi...and more.

Utthapam and Mysore dhosa were my orders for two, but i was done with half of utthapam. Soooo tasty and healthy they are that you can't deny going there for good tummy filling food under a good price. The order came a bit late but never mind when you get the taste of South India in Kolkata.

Well I am not too much fond of Veg South Indian food. Still out of curiosity just landed up twice for the experience. Once I tried Rava Masala Dosa and the other day I tried Mysore Madala Dosa.

On both the cases the dosas were good nothing to get over excited about it. The place was clean and quite good in all aspect, though the dishes are a bit overpriced. I will definitely visit again to find out more dishes there and may be some day I will get a little bit more interested towards South Indian food.

We ordered chess onion masala rava dhosa and tomato onion uttapam , and other day i ordered sunday special south Indian meal ... both of these dishes tasted very good as i am a south Indian food lover .. but i deducted two because of the late and lazy servicing ... u hardly notice any Bengali around yourself except you and your friend .. so i think they prioritise between you and others ..

A superb place to dine with family n friends. I think it is probably the best South Indian restro in Kolkata that I have ever been to. The quality ,quantity and the price is perfect. We tried out Thaali which had 12 puris n 7-8 veggies,raita,sweet dish n what not!! We tried out a Mysore Dosa  ,cheese butter onion dosa(please note you can find only cheese butter dosa, we just requested the waiter to convert it into plain cheese butter onion dosa and they did it) and the taste was heavenly.
The sweet dish was gajar ka halwa and we loved it so much,that we ordered again. 
To be honest , I am not a vegan and if you ask me about this place, I can suggest that you can trust this place blindfoldedly.

located bang opposite the newly opened Big Bazar, banana leaf is a quintessential south indian vegetarian joint. of course, having lived in South India for a good decade, one knows that the four states have distinct food items and cuisines, so it my belief that Banana Leaf serves up mainly food from karnataka (the wonderful bisi bele) and tamil nadu ( puliogare), with much poorer and lesser of representation of kerela ( appam only).

I have visited Banana Leaf many times by now. the south Indian sapad is very good. so is the mini meal. I am a great fan of the kesari bath which is a must-eat here. the appam and korma are however not upto mark.

today I had sambar vada, filter coffee and tomato onion uttapam. all the items were very good but not the best. the sambar however is always top class and the way I like it (not overpowered by jaggery or tamarind).

drawback: the service is not always prompt. and if u land up after 8.30 p.m, they are mostly out of stock.

menu wishlist : it would be great if the variety of chutney is increased from just the basic coconut one. the molagapudi is on the menu but never available. some more onion, tomato, peanut, garlic chutneys (and gongaru) would be great.

a specials around festivals (or just like that) would be great ranging from an andhra thali (with pappu and spicy gunpowder) to a kerela sadya to the much ignored north karnataka dishes. I would be present for all. :)

Since I grew up in south India, one thing I miss about kolkata is not having a dosa joint at every corner. But as soon as I have a meal at banana leaf I don't miss it anymore. The paper plain dosa melts in your mouth, the vada is crisp and light and the mini idlis are fresh and soft. Love this place.
PS: they always have a long waiting line so go a little before rush hour starts.

Banana Leaf was bustling on a weekend afternoon. We had the mysore masala dosa, bisi bele bath, sambar vada and butter milk. The dosas were pretty good; call me greedy but I wish they were crispier. The bisi bele bath (why was it not bisi enough?) was also satisfying but not a patch on the real thing. Ironically, the butter milk was served warm. The vada and white chutney, I liked most. Fresh, hot and crispy vadas can soothe your soul :D The service had mix ups galore. I'd say this is a fairly reliable candidate for your occasional south indian fix.

PS: I am sure to return to try the ghee roast and kuni paniyaram.

Food is very tasty and reasonably priced.  On a Sunday morning with such tasty breakfast, it makes a entire day.

When u enter u will find the typical tangy smell inside which will blow u out if u r a South Indian Cuisine lover.  We ordered Butter Onion Cheese Masala Dosa,  paper sada dosa etc.  At the end we had their special coffee. It was an amazingly different experience.  Loved every bit of it.

Yesterday was kinda the first time I stepped outta my crib and landed up in Banana Leaf. Thanks to mum. Pure nostalgia. Bisebilleh Bhaat and Puliogare and Lemon Rice.. Reading these names made me so emotional !

Anyways.. I ordered Mini Butter Idlis with Tomato Chutni and Vada.. Other than this.. Masala Dosa.. And Sweet and Salt Lime Soda. It was good. M gonna keep coming here just to relive the memories.

This is one place iv visited a lot of times, thanks to its quality food and proper pricing. Located opposite to lake market big bazaar, this place has a large fan fare, especially among the south Indian crowd and pure vegetarian crowd from other parts of India.
Pros :
1. Good tasty food
2. Affordable pricing
3. Pure vegetarian restaurant
4. Easy to locate and adequate parking place
5. Quick service and friendly staff
Cons :
1. Weekends feature a large crowd and inspite of the large seating capacity, you may have to wait for around 15 mins
2. Could be a bit more hygienic.
Must have items :
South Indian veg thali meals, Wide variety of dosas, kesari, filter coffee

This is the place where I tasted appam for the first time and I fell in love with the dish. The coconut milk accompanying appam was light and favulous. Later on I tasted appam in other joints but none were as delicious. I also love there curd vada. I can go there everyday for that.

After hearing a lot of praises for Banana Leaf, I decided to drop by today. I am a big admirer of South Indian cuisine and so I had high hopes from this place. I had a friend accompanying me.

The initial impression of the place was very nice. It was well decorated, air conditioned and clean. We settled at a table for 4 and were excited to check out the menu.

We ordered Molgapudi Idly, Butter Onion Masala Dosa and Dahi Vadas. The foods were served in clean plates and with clean spoons. We were definitely impressed with the hygiene that this place was maintaining. Well done!

Coming on to the foods...

The Moglapudi Idly was okay - we were having it for the first time, so we had nothing to compare it to. It was okay but I'd much rather prefer plain idlys over them. Coming on to the next dish..

Butter Onion Masala Dosa

It was good...the taste was delicious, the size was appropriate and the accompanying sambar and chutney were very fresh and tasty. I liked the chutney more than the sambar. Overall, very happy with the dosa.

Now, onto the dessert - my favorite Dahi Vada

This is where Banana Leaf really let me down. Davi Vada is one of my most favorite South Indian desserts and so I had high hopes from Banana Leaf on this one.

To start off with, the Dahi was awfully sweet for Dahi Vada. There was no proper seasoning, inadequate salt, no tamarind sauce and no sev. I was shocked to see that a restaurant as reputed as Banana Leaf could serve such bland and disappointing Dahi Vada. As seasoning, they just had a few boondis sprinkled over the dahi, which made it look even more weird.

As they say, all is well that ends well and my first visit to Banana Leaf ended with a massive disappointment over the Dahi Vada. Hence the rating of a mere 1.5 compared to probably 4 or 4.5 which I would have gladly given, had the Dahi Vada been to my liking.

To sum up - Nice ambiance, clean tables and good hygiene. Average quality of food. I have visited way too many places that served better tasting dishes than Banana Leaf.

Would I visit again? - I doubt so. Certainly never for Dahi Vada.

This place gave me the best south Indian food experience in entire Kolkata. When you are here you get so much more than te cliched dosa, idli, sambar, uttapam and vada. This place shows you what a south Indian lunch is all about. We ordered a South indian special meal and a mini meal and two orders complemented in a way that gave us chance to taste all kind of South Indian delights minus the cliched stuffs I mentioned earlier.  Starting from bisibella rice to lemon rice , curd rice and the awesomeness of  the curries that came along with the thali left me absolutely delighted. The thali also had payasam and all that you need for that perfect south Indian experience. They also took the butter milk experience to a different level.  I am so much happy to have visited this place. I will recommend it to everyone looking for South Indian food in Kolkata

this is my first visit to the one of the  famous south indian restaurant in kolkata. Tried their  south indian special thali. The food was pretty simple and a complete meal according to me.  they served plain rice, puri, 2 types of dal, sambar, rasam, curd, another curd mixed with chopped onion , one green vegetable item , red cickpeas mixed with shredded coconut and other condiments. I also tried their butter milk which was really good, thumbs up for that. In terms of taste they had one thick sambar kind of dal which had lots of vegetbles. It looked like a sambar but little bit thick and it was really awesome. The overall taste was good. The thali is simple and good. i really liked the south indian concept of thali. according it was a complete balance diet. South indian thali has protein and carbohydrate and everything in the form of red chickpeas, green veggies, dal, curd , rice and puris. so a complete balanced food. And yea one sweet dish which was like a kheer but less sweet and more water in comparison to a normal kheer. the price is ₹160 plus tax on weekend for the south indin spcl thali. the reason i rated it 4 based in terms of pricing and taste. and btw its based on how much you can eat, its not a set menu like Rasam in salt lake. you can ask to repeat the items.  would i visit again, definitely yes, i love simple food as well. During my visit i saw few foreigners enjoying the meal as well. their food are less spicy and definitely represents the taste of south india.

tired of oily spicy junk foods. then this is the perfect place for you. a peaceful south indian restaurant away from the hustle and bustle of lake market area. everything they serve is super light and never gives you a bad burp. so make yourself comfortable and order for some good dosas or idlis or uttapams. you can also try the south indian or north indian thalis here. the pulao and paneer masala is my personal favourite. :)

for having some pure south-Indian delights (with some Bengali-local makeover which adds to the authentic charm) one would be here, as i had been for thrice and have tasted almost all items except for the meal (which i am eagerly waiting for). 
with a simple yet classy (of South Indian stylized) arrangements it's pleasant to have dosas of as many variety as you want -of which rava dosa is eccentric and yes the onion cheesy dosa (my favorite so far). also had average masla dosas (complemented with abundant portion of butter and authentic tang of south spices). the idlis are light soft puffy ones. but the puri platter that they offer separately are different from those small ones offered in meals & the former (which i had) was not of a kind. though the pickle was nice and the sabji too (which was actually the stuffing of masala dosa). the uttapams were plain (tasty  but not like what they show in the picture) i would prefer dosa to other such items anytime here.
other than the food, all is not nice about the place particularly the service and the behavior of the staffs. the service is slow and notably uncongenial - like the staffs seemed unfriendly to answer, ignorant and reluctant to refill the chatnis and sambars.  (infact they ultimately did not refill ours even after repeated calling) which was surprisingly rude and one would not want to experience so.

A perfect place to satisfy your thirst for some south indian delicacy. This joint has well detailed menu and almost every other south indian delicacy has been placed on its menu .

We first ordered for molgapudi idli which is idli covered with mixture of dal and spices.Its a  spicy one .

We ordered for rava masala cheese dosa and sada cheese dosa with two glasses of buttermilk.the dosas were crispy with adequate amlunt of cheese and masala 
The buttermilk was really good and was the showstopper.

Overall a good place to treat yourself with some south Indian food at a nominal cost

Located in a busy market inside a long alley.Surprisingly big from the inside.Always keeps you waiting when it comes to dine in.Of its great taste and choice of selection on the menu.Banana leaf keeps you waiting and salivating.
Musty try - Mysore Dosa,Fried idli, Cheese rava dosa.
coconut chutney can be a lot more better.Consistency is not the same evertime i visit.Great service with light food and again easy on the pocket.

It is one of my wife’s favorite south Indian restaurants. She can have idlis 7 days in a week. 
Thus we land up coming here twice in a month.

Been a regular foodie at this joint and they have really maintained their culinary standards.

The ambiance of this place is calm and quiet; it is extremely tidy and clean. Pricing is standard, provided the quality they maintained.

Our favorites:

-Special Thali on Sunday. 
- idlis
- uttappa platter
-filter coffeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

We have tasted each and every dish on the menu but still end up coming twice in a month.

South Indian Delights- and as a result, veggie friendly.. The exact two collections that aptly describe this place.. Tucked inside a small alley, the place is actually quite bigger in the inside.. :-P 
I have been there numerous times, and have tried their dosas, uthapam, idlis, vadas and also their Thalis.. The quality of food is excellent, and to be fair, very authentic.. This is one of the very few places where I liked the lassi.. The pocket pinch is nothing compared to the food they give you..
The only thing I don't like is the ambience, its too noisy and crowded, and the ac could me much cooler, sometimes it gets pretty warm inside..

Excellent south Indian food. I usually go there in the weekends because of office schedules. There is a waiting time of around 5-15 minutes. Being a vegetarian, the food quality matched to the ones I have had in Bangalore and Chennai. Waiters are always a bit busy and it's a bit difficult to catch their attention. The value for money is the 'meals'. Go for the full meals, it will satiate your hunger in a tasty way. Not too spicy, not too bland. Overall, a very good experience.

This place was at a walking distance from the place where I stayed at kolkata. I loved visiting this place because its a pure vegetarian restaurant and believe me in kolkata a vegetarian will be more than happy to find a pure vegetarian restaurant. The food was good and almost same taste as that of south indian food being given at roadside stand near rashbehari avenue crossing. Avoid visiting on Sunday evenings as you'll die of hunger while waiting to get a table for you.

South Indian food more or less tastes the same in every restaurant. The only distinctive factor in my opinion is the flavour or coconut chutney & sambhar. I finally paid a visit to Banana Leaf. We had ordered rava masala dosa & kuzi panayaram (these are small balls of idli mixture tangy in taste & the dough has chilli slices, curry leaves & mustard seeds & then saluted in oil). The rava dosa is as crispy as it was expected and the coconut chutney was quite fresh. The kuzis were really cute small balls that tentalizing the taste buds.. All these were washed down with a glass of buttermilk.. Yummilicious! 
Neat place but I must say, it takes quite a waiting to get a table..

Serves authentic south Indian cuisine.with its wide assortment of dosas with every type of stuffing (excluding non vegetarian stuff),chutneys,sambars,delicious crispy vadas,yummy uttapams etc,this restaurant has carved itself a niche. Been a regular foodie at this joint and they have really maintained their culinary standards.And am still awestruck by the humongous size of paper masala dosas,even today. Their cold coffee ain't that bad too. Do give it a try!
However, the management should look into keeping the restaurant serviceable beyond 10 pm.

This place happens to be one of my favorites when it comes to authentic south indian food. The first time I went there I was in class 11 ..almost a decade ago!! I love going back to this place for there  Uttapams and Rava Masala Dosas in particular. Very few places in Kolkata specialise in making such awesome rava dosas, Banana Leaf being one of them. My last trip to this place happened to be a week back when I decided to have an early morning breakfast with a friend before hopping into my gym..and like every visit, I came out with a smile on my face. We had an Idli platter, Rava Masala Onion Dosa and Onion Uttapam. Rava dosa was crispy with a tasty masala filling and the Uttapam was great too. Love coming back to this place.. a must visit for all Dosa lovers!

Frankly speaking I am not a south Indian food fan but this restaurant changed my views. We had ordered cheese onion dosa, vada, idli with special chutney. The dosa was great. Vadas were perfectly cooked, slightly crispy outside and tender inside. Idlis were very well cooked. They also serve sambhars without onion and it tastes really great. The special chutney is a must have. Pocket friendly and air conditioned. One can't help the que as the restaurant is always filled up with patrons. A must visit for south Indian food lovers..

Having explored most restaurants with similar menus, I can safely conclude that Banana Leaf is easily the best restaurant for vegetarian South Indian cuisine in Kolkata. Located in the heart of South Kolkata, Lake Market, this restaurant is the epitome of quality and consistency. Ranging from soft fluffy idlis, crispy vadas, and classic rava dosas to the very indulging meals, this is one place where one can eat and be assured of a gastronomical experience par excellence. In view of the high quality and great demand for South Indian cuisine, it tends to get very crowded in the evenings and holidays, however there is a waiting room and a short wait should result in a blissful experience. I visit this place close to twice a month and have only once been disappointed with the service which tends to be ordinary at times. If you love South Indian vegetarian cuisine and have not tried Banana Leaf, you are missing out on an opportunity to savour good, uncomplicated food at its best. The only reason I have not rated this restaurant higher is because of the service which is not amongst the best.

For all Bengali the south indian food means only DOSA. I also always try dosa, though I should try other items also but every-time I saw the menu card my eyes stuck on dosa only :( . Cheese Butter Masala Dosa .... Aahhhhh what a delicious one.... I will suggest stop thinking that dosa is a streetfood item and try this one in this place. You will again visit I bet. And the most lovely thing is that I dont have to be upset much of having too much of oily khaana like indian/mughlai.

This restaurant is  one of the good ones in lake market area. The food mainly consists of types of idlis, dosas and uthapams. The thali here is also very good. The special chutney is a must try if eating idli, dosa, or uthapam. The normal coconut chutney though is watery. Also service is bad during weekends due to large number of orders.

If you are craving for authentic South Indian flavor, Banana Leaf is the place ! A very natural place with no bells or whistles , only stupendously tasty REAL authentic Dakshini flavor. You can just choose whatever you like from their menu... you just cannot go wrong . I personally like the thali, mini meal and butter masala dosai... ambience is very typical of a Chennai or Bangalore family restaurant , spanky clean and neat... I love the place... service is very good also. And , very important, their Sambar and chutney are masterpiece, and you can just ask for as many bowls as you like... it is FREEE !! :)

Update Jun 13th 2015: excellent filter coffee... Amazing presentation... You gotta try this.

The food and service has gone down to a major extent. The Nariyal Chutney served was not fresh (they say they serve fresh food) and was tasting really sour.
We asked for a replacement and then there was no response for the next 10 mins. Next was, the masala of the dosa had a WHOLE boiled rotten potato in it. They did not mash it and served it as a whole. Really disappointed with the kind of food they served. They just lost a customer. Infact others sitting there also said the food is not good.

Writing the review after visiting the restaurant very regularly for a number of years. The best South Indian food ever had anywhere in Kolkata. The interior is simple, yet clean and hygienic. On weekends you will have to wait for around 30 mins to get a seat.. service is quick and the food is awesome.Had Onion Masala Dosa and Tomato, Chilli Uttapam yesterday.. both were absolutely lip-smacking & amazing. The quality and quantity of chutney and sambhar provided is superb. They also provide special thick chutney and onion red chutney on request.Probably the only restaurant that serves some unique south india fare under one roof viz. bisse bille bhaath, pongal, appam-kurma, idiappum-kurma, kerala parota, kuzi pranayama etc. The south indian thali is probably the best available in the city.Have tried other South Indian restaurants too (Prema Vilas, Pai Malgudi, Chechis, Udipi Home, Sheetala Udipi, Madras Tiffin, Anand Restaurant, Calcutta South India Club, Gupta Bros, Raj, Haldiram etc) but no one can come anywhere close to Banana Leaf. Ramkrishna Lunch Home, Ammini and Tamarind are the only other South Indian restaurants which can be compared with Banana Leaf.Will visit again & again.

Nice place. I found the masala dosa quite crisp and to my liking. I ate one uttapam and one dosa. Uttapam was quite ordinary but the dosa was great. One unique thing which I found in this restaurant is a waiting hall right outside , which amused me first but I soon learned the advantages of it as there was a huge waiting outside. The price of the restaurant is quite pocket friendly. We ate 2 masala dosas, 2 uttapams , 1 plain dosa and 2 coffee for 573 bucks only

If you are looking for authentic amazing no nonsense south indian food this is the place. As an ex bangalorean I had been craving proper south indian food and not the modified food we get in kolkata. What first impressed me was the variety of food available here. I think its the only place serving podi and bullet powder based dishes. Also pongal. The rasam and sambar are mouth smacking yummy. The dosas perfect. Been here on multiple occasions so have had both breakfast and lunch. The meals and tiffin served here are also amazingly delicious. My one problem if i have to be picky is the rava vada is a bit too crisp for my liking. Yes i know its supposed to be thinner then the traditional dosa made with rice. But would still like it a bit less crisp. Will post more pics the next time i am there. Of dosa and the lunch meal

My review is solely based on just two items...that too of the same kind....which i tried out here. They are the rava cheese masala dosa and the butter masala dosa. I,like most other bengalis,distinguish south indian food from any other cuisine by the word 'dosa' itself. I am an absolute dosa lover and always keep hogging them around all the south indian reataurants. Hence when I heard about this place and read some rave reviews on zomato, i decided to try it out. This place is located just opposite to lake market...quite easy to locate,and if missed by any chance,there is a big signboard showing the directions. I went here with my brother and both of us really enjoyed the food. The ambience of this place is calm and quiet, it is extremely tidy and clean. We ordered the dosas which i mentioned earlier and both turned out to be yummy. I specifically liked the butter masala dosa,as the buttery texture gave an extra pinch of delight with each bite. Both the dosas were crisp,light but at the same time quite filling. I specifically liked the white chutney more than the sambhar.The sambar was a little too spicy for my taste buds. The price of the food is at par with the quality served. Its really nice that a very standard south indian restaurant apart from anand is now in kolkata and I hope they serve this same kind of delicious food in future too. I really enjoyed my visit here and surely going back again.

With absolute limited knowledge about South Indian Food and cuisine i finally paid a visit to the very famous 'Banana Leaf' in Lake Market.

Ordered my all time favourite 'Cheese Masala Rava Dosa'. It was very good but definitely not the best till date. Even the 'Cheese Paneer Rava Dosa' my sister had was well made, with abundance of shredded paneer throughout the dosa. The Sambar and the Chatni was good and complemented the dosa, however they charge extra for the other chatni that is usually provided in other South Indian Restros.

Staff was polite and delivery pretty fast. Even they kept Kimberly Stark tissues on the table,something that i really haven't noticed recently elsewhere. Pricing was standard ,provided the quality they maintained.

Will be coming back to try out the various vadas,uttapam,rice and offcourse their filter coffee :)

A south Indian restaurant is incomplete without bisebille bhaat, pongal n mini meals. Well i found almost everything in the menu card that I used to live on during my college days.

Serves best in the city be it tomato rice or fried idli. I somehow miss the ghee rice n podi dosa and am yet to find it.

South Indian cuisine is more than just dosa or idli or upma or uttapam. You looking for more than that, this is one of the place.

Let me be honest here. I HATE South Indian cuisine !!!
I like nothing about the them actually and don't ever bother to even go and eat South Indian food ever but I have a cousin who loves South Indian food and a husband who can have dosa , uttapam and  vada 3 times a day ??? 
So I do end up going to banana leaf at least once a month and I must say it is probably the only place where I can atleast finish a dosa. I like there butter cheese paper dosa with special red chutney. There mini idli is also very popular.

We used to visit this place when we were in college. The ambience is decent but the food and its authenticity will haunt you wherever you have South Indian food. BTW must try the Mysore Dosa and needless to say the filter coffee.

If you want authentic south Indian food, you must visit this place.. They have the best dosas, idlis, vadas in town.. My personal favourite is their rava dosa, which is delicious.. Service is prompt and good too

Authentic South Indian. Don't expect any improvisation in the South Indian Meal which is good. But earlier it contained more Vegetables. Don't miss the Dhaniya-Cheese Dosa. It's sublime !!! Quality-wise it's unquestionable.

Starting from the super tasty rava dosas to the various delectable chutneys they serve added with the rich filter coffee plus the minimalistic neat south indian decor, this place is a decent joint if you are a south indian food lover. But when there's crowd, the waiters are gonna keep checking at your table to find out if you are done so that they could clean up for the next customers! And if you are a slow eater or someone who likes to 'chew' her food or who purely wants to enjoy the eating experience, never stick around the place if you see crowd!

It brings back the old south Indian taste to me. Having lived for many years in south, I look for authentic south Indian. My search took me here, and it was worth it. Having their family dosa with family was fun. Whole family eating from the same dosa. Only place where I could find sevai, paniyavaram, try their paratha kurma, it reminds me of Malabar paratha in Kerala. You can have dosas at many places, but some things you get here only

If you are craving a good south indian meal then BANANA LEAF is the place. Very pocket friendly and just amazing food! I went here initially on a weekend and there was atleast 10-15 people waiting outside to get in so i had to drop the plan then but again i landed up on Monday and after a 10 minute wait i got a table. Phew! So much for dosas!!

The place is not a fine dine restaurant so if you are looking for casual hang out you can drop in. I would recommend reserving a table any day as the place is full almost everyday. The staffs are polite & hard working.

Now coming to their food, they are awesome. We had ordered masala dosa and butter masala dosa and they were absolute stunner. I can vouch for their butter masala dosa - a must try. The filling of the dosa is good not just in terms of quality but quantity too. Their sambhar was yum but what i  noticed was that they had no rasam. I have lived in Bangalore and i know what rasam is but here they just served two small bowls of sambar, one with more vegetables and one with little veggies. In no way can you term the other katora as rasam. 

Next we had their vada- nothing special to be honest. Same old. Then we went for their suji halwa. If you are a hard core sweet lover only then will i suggest this or else no. It is indeed yum and gummy and creamy but very very sweet. I couldnt have more than two small spoons. But the consistency of the halwa was very different from normal suji halwa that we make at home. If you want to give it a try take one and share.

Overall a filling experience.

Undoubtedly one of the best South Indian restaurants in Kolkata. You have to wait for quite sometime if you suddenly drop in on a Sunday evening! This place is entirely packed. I have visited this place innumerable times and I am so content with their food, their service and their pricing that I never felt the need to write a good or a bad review. But I think it's about time that I write one. The decor is very modest and humble, the cutlery used could be a little better but the food more than makes up for everything. Their dosas are crisp and almost perfect. But the dish which I absolutely love are their mini idlis! Ahh! The little pieces of perfection and their halwa! Super delicious. 
This place needs no introduction to anyone who loves to gorge on South Indian delicacies! I love this place and as usual will keep coming back! The staff is super fast and efficient, I have absolutely nothing to complain about this time! Great going! ?✌️

I think I have tasted almost all the Dosa varieties they offer,over the years, but my recent(3-4 years) favourites are Dhania Onion Dosa and Rava Masala Dosa. Authentic South Indian food with a homely ambience to complement it, you eat in peace and relish every bite instead of getting lost in the glam quotient of the restaurant. Servers are very polite. You can't just help but keep coming for more.

Had been to "Banana Leaf" today for the first time and the experience was pretty good. Firstly talking about the ambience and decor, must say they r decent. It remains crowded. The interior is decent and simple. Now coming to food, we ordered for paper butter dosa, dhania cheese dosa and butter milk. Both the dosas were excellent, everything was perfect, especially the dhania cheese dosa. The butter milk was very okayish. But overall the experience was pretty good... as it is definitely a pocket friendly eatery.

This place used to be really good around 3-4 years ago. Now, they've compromised on the quality of their food. It's almost always too oily. Also, their utensils are often unclean. Unclean utensils and unapologetic staff can be okay at a roadside eatery, but are unacceptable here, considering their prices are four times as much. Even the street-side dosa vendor has a better behaviour than most of the waiters here. I'd recommend that you check that guy's stall out before you come in here.

I have been to this place multiple times and have loved every visit. Even though getting a table here is much of a hassle given the huge queue waiting to have the delicious food served by them.

Over the several visits I have had:-
1. Butter milk - is simply amazing, spicy, loved it, probably the best I've ever had.
2. Masala Vada - The special vada served only on Saturday and Sunday dinner time. Crisp and Very tasty.
3. Cheese Masala Rava Dosa - Rava Dosa is perfect, with the Cheese and Masala, Delightful.
4. Uttapam Platter - 5 mini uttapams with different tastes. Didn't like it much.
5. Kuzi Paniyaram - This was a different dish which I had for the first time at Banana Leaf, and was definitely worth a try.

On my last visit I saw a giant size dosa being served at a table, probably called family Dosa. So big, that I think it would suffice for a family of 6 people. The Dosa looked really amazing I must say.

Kudos.!

We had a weekend dinner at Banana leaf and we quite enjoyed it. As a large group we ended up ordering almost all types of food served here. Mysore dosas, uttapams, rasam Idli, Rava Dosa, Panayaram, appam kurma, seera and other stuff. Our test for good south Indian food is the taste of Sambhar and coconut chutney, which they pass with flying colour :). I personally am not a fan potato masala in the Mysore dosa and it was no different here. The appam was a bit of a let down.

Overall we liked the menu and the food a lot, they offer many more south indian items compared to other joints.  We'll be sure to come here again frequently. Be sure to reach here early and beat the long long waiting line.

Traditional and exquisite South Indian Delicacies in Kolkata! Yes indeed!  2 and a half years of stay in Chennai has converted me from an inflexible carnivore to an  idly-dosa-pongal loving person. My days in Chennai use to kick start after having a plate of plain dosa or Idly along with a cup of refreshing filter coffee from our office canteen! Chennai has been great for me in all aspects! Loads of fun with friends, great learning experience career wise and most importantly, the development of taste buds, which now, is not at all biased towards "meat" but could also enjoy quality veg/Chettinad/Keralite/Andra style dishes with equal joy! 
Anyway, the place is neat and clean with organised tables and chairs. Has a waiting area. We had to wait for about 10 min after making the reservations. Waiters are prompt and friendly. They inquired for our order almost as soon as they handed us the menu! A bit rushed I would say! 
We ordered one plate idly, one butter cheese onion masala dosa and one kesar halwa and two filter coffees! My heart skipped a bit after seeing filter coffee in the menu! Within 5 minutes we were served with our orders. Idlies were soft and fluffy! It was accompanied with sambar and chutney! To be frank I expected at least two types of chutney but to my disappointment they served only one - the white one. Not expected from a well known restaurant specially when they are charging adequately for the items. The dosa was tasty enough! But there too the need of a second chutney was strongly felt by us! The kesar halwa was one thing which was spotless and almost as good as the one I use to have in Chennai. So was the filter coffee! Reminded me of T. NAGAR ( A place where I had the best filter coffee in Chennai).
Price - as mentioned before is a bit on the higher note but again being probably the only traditional south Indian restaurant in the area its justified. Crowd was decent. Spotted a lot of foreigners and South Indian people.
As a whole , the restaurant does deliver a nice South Indian flavor in its ambiance and food. Though not as authentic and tasty as the original items in far south, it  does serve its purpose nicely!

Food: 4/5
Ambiance: 4/5
Service: 4/5

It was such a disappointment for me that the review can be in one go. Everything was wrong there....the batter of the dosa, the onions used in onion masala dosa must have been chopped and kept aside the previous night or early that morning and used in the later part of the afternoon, sambhar was nothing but few chopped veggies and lentils in boiling water, the masala stuffed in dosa was insipid...late service...water glasses were not clean so had to be changed....i mean it was a total disaster...

Located opposite Lake Mall, this south indian food joint is ideal to satiate your hunger pangs right after shopping at gariahat. This place serves absolutely good food. Very clean, prompt service and well mannered waiters. But the best part is that they have very affordable rates.I have tried their sada dosa, cheese dosa, paper dosa and sambar vada. The dosas were crispy each time. The sambar and chutney tasted perfect too. Vadas were crispy outside and soft inside.I have been told that they serve great coffee too. I am yet to have it.

Trust me its the one of the best south Indian restaurant of Kolkata without any second thought. Do dig into cheese masala dosa and its a big challenge for a single person to finish it. Moreover rasam- a south Indian blend of hot water with tamarind leaves creates a fresh appetizer. However the inclusion of dosas like pudina dosa, podi dosa, methi dosa, mysore dosa is uncommon and must try. Lastly you would like to visit the place again and again.

I chose a rather unconventional spot to celebrate my birthday. But given the great reviews on Zomato and to add to that the Times food award for the Best south Indian food in the city, I decided to check into this food joint for lunch.
This restaurant is bustling with people and a sense of urgency is evident right from the moment the waiters serve you a glass of water. So if you are going for a private lunch with your near and dear ones, you might want to reconsider your decision.
We ordered Sambar Vada , Paneer Dosa and Cheese dosa for three of us.
The sambar vada was just as ordinary as it could get.Infact the vada was not upto the mark , you could make out the non uniform way from the fermented dough inside. (2/5)
The cheese dosa was good as reviewed by my friends.(4/5)
Paneer dosa was also good. However, if you are used to the normal masala filling, you could be taken by surprise since they simply put in a filling of paneer which is not peppered with any spices.Its plain cottage cheese grated and filled inside right away.(3.5/5) The sambar and coconut chutney disappointed all of us a lot, the latter was one of the worst I ever had.The coconut chutney was devoid of any fragrance or flavor.I don't know still if a restaurant of this stature has a different way of preparing it and whether people love it this way. The sambar was ordinary and the curry leaves in it looked like they were put in there a week ago.
Given that I have had better south Indian food elsewhere, I would like to stick to a rating of 2.5.However, I hope to review their food once again after trying out their Thali meals. Happy munching till then !!!
EDIT - I went there during Navami of 2017.It was my second try at this restaurant.I ordered 1 tomato uttappam and 3 onion masala dpsas for the 4 of is.We also had 2 blue lagoon drinks.The blue lagoon drink was heavily colored and I am sure there was no Curacao used.The tomato uttappam was the disaster of the day.The waiter mentioned it would take time but since time wasn't an issue ,I ordered it. The moment it arrived , i got a whiff of some unpleasant odor.The tomatoes in half the uttappam were stale.The dosas were just ok.I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND this place since it is simply ripping off people nowadays resting on its past laurels.

Difficult to find this restaurant as the entrance is from the side and the board is hardly visible from the main road but marked correctly on the maps here. About the food, the dosas are really tasty and being a south Indian myself I must say I felt close to home... The sambhar is awesome and I could just not stop eating it, had 4 cups of sambhar! Yummyyy... The restaurant is full mostly but service is fast... To my horror I found a bug in bisibele bath and when I brought it to the notice of the staff he apologized immediately... He said he would replace it but I cancelled it... He got me a bowl of lemon rice and insisted that I have it even thou I said it's not required saying that it's a mistake from their side... They didn't charge for the bisibele bath or lemon rice and even gave me a 10% discount on the overall bill... I think the entire issue was well handled by the staff but cleanliness must be a priority and that's why a lower rating... Overall I must say it still is the best south Indian restaurant in Kolkata (Madras restaurant comes very close too) and for the tasty food they serve its well worth the money you pay! 350 for 2 people!

Visited dis over rated eatery twice....nd had their thali meal....
As their name suggests....i was expecting to be served on banana leaves!!!but thankfully the food was served on several katories!!!!around 8 katories of food!!!the presentation was right on the mark!!!
Now....coming to the food.
So many dishes...but the taste of all of them was astonishingly same!!!!
No tempering.no oil.
We opted for puri instead of rice.
The puri was unlimited. Made of atta.nd palatable.
A fried red chilli.achhar.dahi.nd papad.
Nd the star if the thali was this amazingly awesomely yummyly Delicious desert.....a variety of halwa which was out of the world!!!
Dat was the reason i went d 2nd tym.but dat tym the halwa had this disgusting smell of COCKROACHES.!!!!!
M not giving dis a third visit.

For mouth watering South Indian this is the place to go. I went there with 3 of my friends and had a delicious time there. We had the mini idlis(delicious mouthful), cheese rava dosa and mini tiffin(if you can't decide, have one of everything) :) 
It is very easy on the pocket and a must visit for vegetarisna dn also for non-veggies for just must have authentic South indian.

This place was a normal tryout for me, but I found that it is actually a very good place for South-Indian dishes. The name itself proves that how they serve the dishes. It's pretty much interesting. They provide wide range of south-Indian foods at standard price. The place is well maintained & clean.

If you love South-Indian food then this is a must visit place for sure.

My family love the place and we visit quite often sometimes after a walk around Dhakuria lake and sometimes after a lazy Sunday for dinner. Our youngest son, aged 3 loves the mini idli. I don't think you get it anywhere else. Our older son loves his cheese rawa dosa. Our teenaged daughter loves his masala dosa and uthhapam. I love the pooniyaram and my husband loves the rawa dosa. The coffee taken Soth Indian style is the crowning glory of a totally satidfying meal. the restaurant is clean, spacious, matter-of-fact and provides wholesome nourishment any time of the day. The coconut chutney is always freshly grated and never disappoints as some places do.

I went here for a quick bite with my mother yesterday after having seen such a positive response that people had to this place. I quite liked the clean and fast service which I feel is very essential to the goodwill of a restaurant. The menu serves south Indian food and it is very pocket friendly. We ordered butter milk along with a dhaniya masala dosa and a paneer onion masala dosa. It was delicious and the chutnis tasted very fresh, the dosas weren't greasy but were crunchy with ample filling. Really enjoyed my experience there.

Located right opposite Lake Mall, they serve mouth-watering, delicious, yum yum south Indian cuisine on clean and shining steel utensils layered with a banana leaf as the name suggests. I used to be a frequent customer there, along with my Telugu friend during college days because she missed 'ghar ka khana' and gradually I too fell in love with this restaurant. I particularly liked their service and the hygiene they maintained. One should definitely try out 'the south Indian meals (no sharing)'

I must say that it is a must visit south Indian restaurant in Kolkata. Prices are quite decent according to the quality and variety of food served which is very good. The one negative point is that the ambience is not quite great but the taste of the food will make you forget that. Must try - south Indian butter milk, paper roast dosa

A decent place in the heart of the city for South Indian food.

Ambience is good, service is prompt as expected of a South Indian joints. One can order meals out the evergreen Dosas, Idlis or Medu Vadas.

When you are unsure of the choice of cuisine, this can always be the fall back plan.

Simple but very cozy ambience.

Food :
Ordered :
Mini Tiffin ( one sambar vada,one idli,pongal,halwa and a small dosa) - just loved each one of them . The idli just melted in the mouth , the sambar vada was just super - fried to just the optimal level ,crispy to the right extent ,pongal was good ,Dosa good, halwa was just awesome  - 4/5
Butter Masala Dosa- very nice
Masala Dosa -very nice
Rasam - fantastic
One more thing the mini Tiffin only sounds and looks mini - it is quite filling !

Staff : Friendly staff with standard waiting time after placing order 
Overall fantastic eating experience - 4/5

Probably the best restaurant in the city serving south indian delicacies . I went there few days ago along with a friend of mine who is from Chennai. He strongly recommended me to visit there with him as he was dying to taste their dosas . He was correct....i never had such dosas in town before in any other south indian restaurants. The dosas we ordered was simply mouthwatering and yummy. we even ordered mini meals which was simply awesome. It is a kind of thali which consists of a paratha, lemon achar, 3 bowls of rice-lemon,curd and tomato(THE TOMATO RICE WAS THE BEST), a vegetable(dont know the name :P) and a dessert called kesari which was good too. Those who are not much fond of dosas and idli must definitely try this platter. My friend told that even the other preparations are fantastic...would love to try them some other day :).....Coming to the ambiance ...its quite simple..the decor is simple with white and green walls and comfortable seating arrangement...service is quick too..and the waiters are nice and hospitable and recommend good food too....
I would like to visit this place often to try out their other mouth watering preparations and its quite affordable too. :)

This restaurant serves authentic South Indian Food and it lived up to it's expectation in terms of food. The ambiance was modest and there is a scope of more south indian touch to the decor. The banana leaf should have been in the shape of the logo of the restaurant. Over all it was a nice experience as the food was authentic!

I had been here long ago that too with a South Indian friend. Its been ages now and expect some changes. A place for authentic South Indian food. Different varieties of Dosas. You would get almost all kind of South Indian dishes. They serve the food not on 'banana leaf' as the name says but on steel plates as one would see in southern India. The tea is served in small glasses placed on a small bowl. Hmm...try it, don't hesitate, pour it into the bowl and sip your tea.

Not very costly. A good food is worth paying--- applies. Any age group can be taken. No bar, so ask your grandparents to join for some wonderful South Indian dishes.

Since its been years I have been there, I am planning to go soon. Dost-----chal chaltey hai.

Undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in town serving South Indian fare.Recently paid my first visit to this vintage joint on a fine,bright sunny morning.After having stayed in Chennai for a couple of years i do suffer from dosa hunger pangs at times.Believe me this place did a wonderful job of satiating my hunger.I opted for the take-away and had ordered the following:
1. Rava masala dosa
2. Paper masala dosa
3.Mini idly
4. Sweet
The dosas were delectable indeed but unfortunately had lost their crispness when we had it at home.No fault of theirs though.The sambhar was thick,rich and prepared with loads of veggies,not spicy at all.The coconut chutney was also akin to a thick paste and not watery  like in some joints.The plate of mini idly comprised of  plenty of small button sized idlis-in fact the pristine white idlis resembled white batashas-as we bengalis like to call it :)
The only disappointing aspect was the sweet.I was expecting something on the lines of rava kesari- a fiery red coloured ghee soaked halwa that is a rage in Chennai and is the star-attraction at Saravana Bhavan-one of the best South Indian joints in Chennai. But this halwa was a pretty poor cousin of the dish i have had earlier.
Ambiance,staff-behaviour,cleanliness are top-notch.Prices are on the higher side but then good food comes at a price.
Looking forward to repeat visits to polish off more items from the menu.

Been there quite a few times... The place is small and clean but nothing fancy... The name is simple and catchy so is the food...
Must have :
Sambhar vada... The crispy vada is really good and sambhar and the coconut chutney makes it better.
Mini idli with sambhar
Dosa - all sorts
Coffee..... 

The food has the flavour that a person who likes south indian food looks for.... So if you like south indian food then this is the place. Also it fits the budget making it a place to visit frequently.

I am the laughing stock among my friends because I consider myself to be a strict non vegetarian. There are very less meat varieties that I have not tried till now so it was a very new experience to visit this PURE vegetarian place. And it was a very very good experience. Starting from the cheese dosa to the hot sambar, the puri and the idlee, everything was tasty and fresh. The servers were also extremely helpful and very fast service was a sight for sore eyes. Must try for its clean simple approach and is also a south indian delight.

One lunch time, I gave a ignore look to my chinese obsession, and went in for a Masala Dosa and Dahi Vada. That was GREAT! Price is affordable, and service is good. Seating is very basic, cleaned and tidy. I wish to take my Mom and Dad here for treat sometime soon.

BANANA LEAF: Located at the heart of south Kolkata is one of the best south Indian eateries in Kolkata at this point of time. Homely atmosphere. Clean n courteous staffs. We ordered paneer masala rava dosa, cheese onion masala dosa, mini idly. It was a dinner date with my wife as both of us are food aficionados. Once it was ordered we waited patiently and to our surprise the service is pretty prompt. The paneer masala rava dosa was good. The sambar and chutney provided alongside was fresh and tasty. The mini idlis were a good filling experience. Taste and the softness of the idlis are worth mentioning in this context. Cheese onion masala dosa was the show stealer here. Generous use of cottage cheese grated inside the dosa meant the cheese had melted and have a sticky feeling with the dosa. Loved it. Simply mouth watering. 
My only suggestion would be if you wanna try them for dinner reach the place before hand as the kitchen closes by 10 pm so the last order need to be placed by that time. 
Will definitely be revisiting them to try their thalis which intrigued me a lot. 
Stay connected for that review. 
Thanks.

I went here out of desperation. I work in emergency sector and thus have to do shift duties. The lack of a proper canteen leaves us hungry and starving for a breakfast after a night duty. And as proper bangali culture goes, if you choose to have a breakfast outdoors, you must eat kachoris/nans/luchis and tolerate disgusting "choa dhekur" s for the rest of the day.
As I board metro from Kalighat most of the days, one of my foodie colleagues suggested me this this place once. And ever since it has been my regular  breakfast spot after a night duty. I just love their food, the conglomeration of serious eaters during  breakfast, the light yet filling proper south indian breakfast, the heartiness of the service-boys, everything. I have never visited this place other than the breakfast hours. So, I don't know how it turns out in the rush hours. But it has already been a part and parcel of my life.  
Tips: Try their rava dosas and filter coffee as breakfast.

The place is clean and service is good. They are quite generous with the amount of cheese in the specific dishes. I tried the rava masala dose and it was awesome. It was so big that I could'nt finish it by myself. Looking forward in visiting this place again.

Banana Leaf is a south indian restaurant in south kolkata that is part of Komala Villa .

Komala Villa is a 75 years old south indian hotel and boaders can take advantage of the restaurant.

Other than hygenic south indian food like dhosa, idlly, uttapam, curd rice etc one can savour pongal, bisibela bath which are usually not available in other south indian restaurants. 

Good for family dining though food is slightly costly.

Very veggie friendly place! Sure has got the best breakfast options in town. Very simple interiors. Don't go here for any classy dining experience but a very basic one! Yes its authentic south Indian dishes they serve here. They re pretty expensive according to me (but then I am south Indian and I know how much profit they re making!) But the crowds seem like they aren't. The drawback is, yes the crowd. Take away orders take at least 35-40 mins in weekends. So if you have someone to chatter away with, then go on to this place!
Try kuzhipaniyaram, appam, dosas, vada, buttermilk etc. They re my favourites.

We've been searching for a good South Indian joint for quite some time when we read the various reviews about Banana Leaf and then finally one Tuesday morning we decided it was time to give it a try. Since we recently relocated to Kolkata from Bangalore after 12 long years, it goes without saying that it is not very easy to win our hearts with the "South Indian" food on offer by so many "South Indian" joints. We had tried quite a few of them before trying out Banana Leaf and believe me, not one of them provided the authentic south Indian taste which we were so used to in Bangalore.

And then came our experience at Banana Leaf which simply blew us away. Starting from the Idli to the Dosa to the Upma, we couldn't find a single fault anywhere. The Idli was soft and fluffy, just the type we like and the Paper Masala Dosa had the perfect crispiness to it. The Upma was mind blowing, perfectly tender - neither too soggy nor too dry and tasting heavenly. Even the "Filter Coffee" had the perfect "South INdian" taste to it.

My personal recommendation - Try the Paper Masala Dosa, the Idli and the Upma. They are sure to win you over.

The ambience was very homely and the seating arrangement is pretty comfortable.

The service was prompt and the waiter who took our order was pretty helpful and courteous, which is all we need when visiting a joint fir a meal.

So, overall, it was a GREAT eating out experience with full marks to the joint for the excellent job they're doing.

Banana Leaf in south Kolkata serves south Indian dishes. I ordered Onion Rava Dosa, Chesse Uttapam here. Dosa was ok, not awesome, quantity and filling inside was good enough. But, I like their uttapam most. The samber, white chutney and red chutney are delicious. Usualy they take around 15-20 mins to deliver the food and ambience is ok type here. If you love South Indian food, you can give it a try.

Banana Leaf is one of the few places in South Kolkata which serve authentic (as per them) dosas and idlis. I have a few staple favorites whenever I go to Banana Leaf. I'm fond of their cheese rava dosa. Their implementation of a cheese dosa is somewhat different from most other places. Instead of sprinkling grated cheese all over the dosa, they cook the dosa with the cheese and that gives it a slight burnt taste which I like. Another favorite is the cheese uttarapam and its really filing. My father finds a favorite in the south Indian thali and I have tasted bits and portions from there and found the sabzis to be good.

When I think south Indian dishes this comes to my mind . Located at lake market near rashbehari avenue crossing this is quite easy to locate. 

On entering you will notice that 90% of the people there are not bengalis. They have a large open space fit to have family dinners or lunch. They have a lot of item on the menu. The service is fast and one is greeted courteously. 

We ordered a masala dida and a cheese dosa. They both arrived within 10 minutes and in between we were served cold water to quench our thirst. The dosas are sized reasonably according to price. The cheese dosa had I guess above 50gm of cheese grated inside it. The Sambhar and coconut chutney is very appetizing and they complement the masala dosa perfectly. They have good filter coffee. 

A filling meal cost us below 300rs . . The cheese dosa is so heavy please order when you are in a group as it's impossible for a single person to finish. Love this place and recommend it.

Banana Leaf used to be a small quaint South Indian restaurant which has now developed a huge following in south Kolkata.
The food is always good and easy on the pocket.
A few favorites of mine are the mini idly bowl, the utthapam platter and the butter Dosa they serve. My family loves the "meal" that they offer, but I've never tried it myself. A perfect ending is either fresh juice that they make or the filter coffee.

Tip: always arrive early as the place gets full really fast and the wait times are long. Like really long.

Went to Banana leaf based on recommendation of Zomato.  Found it as per the rating. Though located in a crowed surrounding , has a separate entrance.  It was a holiday and lunch time , had some waiting which cleared of quickly.  Decor is simple and siting just ok.  AC wasn't very effective & few flies kept troubling us . Menu has variety,  tried vada rasam ,idli rasam& dosa. All were good and served quickly.  Reasonable priced , place worth trying.  Hope they take care of AC & flies . Overall rating 3.5.

Best place to have south Indian food in the area. They serve the food on banana leaves, hence the name. Love the various types of dosas available especially the cheese masala one. The thalis are also great with so many types of curries and what nots which they give. The uttapams are good, as are the idlies. The place gets pretty crowded on weekends, which gives you a pretty good idea of its popularity in the area. Overall, nice if you want a good south indian meal.

Best place to have authentic south Indian food in Kolkata. Located near lake market this place scores top when it comes to idly dosas n namesake.
The mini idlis are the perfect starters. Their thali is quite sumptuous and has an array of items served in small katoris with unlimited servings. I love the uttapams the most here.  They r like these mini pizzas in the cheese versions which comes I'm the variety of onion n tomato n one with platter where every type has a small flavour.  the dosas come in huge options with rava, plain, butter, cheese,onion,masala n so on.. 
Awesome food if u have a taste for south Indian delicacies

Banana leaf is what stares in your face as you enter and are served the plate!  Novel effort indeed but one is left wondering whether it serves any real value or is it just an attempt to add novelty and please the eyes? 
The food is quite good and the attempt to avoid fusion in terms of chicken - doses and spinach idlis is well appreciated. The special chutney is well worth a try and adds spice for those looking at something extra. I quite relish their upma- milky white and a hint of smell of ghee that tingles the taste buds!  

Overall a great place to go to if one wants to try dosas, idly and vegetarian thali meals. I have a bit of an issue about their cleanliness and the shabiness of their waiters' uniforms. They need to do something about it.

Among the only ones in Kolkata to serve South Indian food other than the normally available idly-dosa-vada! Their kuzi paniyarams (fried idlies) and steam dosas are a must try, if you're experimental with food. You're sure to like it! Also, I totally loved the coconut milk they serve with the other dishes. Also, you could try the onion-cheese or the onion-paneer rava dosas here! It's crisp and delicious. Service is a little slow- but the wait for the food is totally worth it!

This is surely one of my very very faves when it comes to South Indian food. Love this place and I drool over the chutney that comes along with the dosa it's simply to kill for ! 
I am very specific about my order here , I stick to the cheese masala paper dosa and cold coffee. I believe that's the best combo that earth can provide. 
~ cheese masala paper dosa - it's cheap , it's yummy and it's the best ever !! And it comes along with the chutney which I can kill for. (Yes I can)
~cold coffee - with or without icecream I love. I absolutely love it !!

its just one fine day without even not knowing the place properly one of my friend and me went to dine there. Its situated very near to the lake mall. So firstly a splendid location. I do not want to drag about the neatness or decoration of the place as there nothing much to talk about it but i can guarantee that they serve a class apart south Indian cuisine. You ask for dosa you will get possibly 30 varieties of it. Same goes for idli upma dahi vada. They serve this huge dhosa which is for families who love to share their food and who are more in number. they have some conical dhosa or they call triangular dosa. they serve excellent rava dosa. I have never been a fan of dosa. But this place wil force you to crave for dosa again and again. The price is quite reasonable maybe not like those served out the colleges but not that expensive either. I would suggest people to go and atleast try this place even if u do not fancy the cuisine "coz in the end if you decide not to visit this place its completely your loss!

This place is like a modern roadside restaurant nothing better than the famous Azad Hind Dhaba. It is a pan south Indian restaurant with small seating space. The menu is limited and serves just the basic commodities. The service staff are friendly but are rough and crude in their works. 

It is fairly a typical south Indian restaurant lost in the the eastern India. Nothing to talk about it as the dishes are subnormal and at the same price or maybe even less you can always go to Jyoti Vihar which is veteran in south Indian food for many months of Sundays. 

If you have no choice to go anywhere then hesitantly you have to make this as your choice but if you are liberal for a better change choose Jyoti Vihar anytime.

The 1st time I went to this place the waiting room was crowded with people and I thought I will have to find another place for my dhosa-craving. Surprisingly, things moved pretty fast and I was inside the restaurant and ordering food in next 20 minutes. It might have been even faster had I gone with a bigger group. Usually table for 2 takes time. The place is pretty clean by my standard and we  ordered 2 cold coffees with ice cream and onion cheese masala dosa and a podi butter masala dosa. 1stly the cold coffee with ice cream was super! The filtered coffee flavor was something I would go there again and again for! The cheese dosa was really nice cheesy and filling quantity-wise! I would say there quantity is pretty good! Although we had to ask twice to the waiters to re-fill our sambar bowls, it is not like expected them to keep track of this, considering the fast service and a huge queue of people! Over-all - 4.5 for food and 4.0 for rest!

This is certainly the best place to have south Indian cuisine in the city. Banana Leaf is situated in the ground floor of the Komala Vilas hotel. This place gets hugely crowded during the breakfast hours. The interior is simple and everything here is served on a banana leaf which makes the ambience better. Food here is great and the coconut chutney they serve is brilliant. Only negative is their slow service.

Banana Leaf is located in Rashbehari Avenue and is one of the best South Indian restaurants in the city. Its pocket friendly and serves pipping hot food which is best to have in the restaurant.
The ambience is very neat and tidy and it is quite a big place with decent staff. Service is nice and fast.

Food we ordered :-
1) Idly (Rs.42) : Soft and seemed like fluffy clouds.

2) Vada (Rs.48) : Deep fried heaven. Fried outer coat with soft inner portion. Succulent. And the chutney served is very nice.

3) Mixed uttapam (Rs.123) : This dish takes some time to arrive on the table, around 15-20 mins but it's worth the wait. The best Uttapam I have ever had such a delicious uttapam. It was amazing. This is a must try for everyone. :)

4) Paper Masala Dosa (Rs.97) : Very nice. I love the aloo filling. The sambar served here is not watery and is good to taste.

5) Cheese Masala Dosa (Rs.107) : I love cheese and dosa. So, when these two are mixed together, it has to be tasty.

6) Filtered Coffee (Rs.30) : The aroma is to die for. Tastes how it should taste.
 
7) Mango Milkshake : Very refreshing for a hot sunny day. Not too sweet and with the right amount of Icecream. Nice. :)

8) However the Paneer onion dosa is very bland with lots of onions and a hell lot of paneer bits which is the only positive things about it. So, I am gonma deduct a 0.5 from my ratinf given to this restaurant. 

The samber, white chutney and red chutney are delicious.
P.s. They serve the food on a banana leaf which is laid over a plate. So the name is justified. Is'nt it? :D
Pocket pinch was around 550 bucks.
A very enjoyable meal.
Recommended. :D

Location: Diagonally (right) opposite to Lake Mall, Rashbehari Avenue. 

This place has been visited quite a number of times since am a big fan of south Indian food. 
It has always been crowded! 

To sum it up short, 
This place offers great quality as well as quantity of food. 

The dosas are crisp but on the oily end. 

The idli is soft and always served hot. 
Vada is crisp & hot but oily. 

Uttapam is a little more thickness than usuals, but perfectly cooked and definitely filling! 

Fried papad, too oily. 
Filter coffee, a masterpiece. 

Staff: On their toes catering to orders at minimal timings 

Prices are pocket friendly. 

Overall a good experience. 
Could have been great if the oil content would have been low. :-)

The best south indian food that I have come across in Kolkata. Good food, good ambience, Banana leaf is your answer to authentic South Indian Food. The vadas and the idlis are absolutely fresh and soft no matter what time of the day you go there at. Love the filter coffee. And if you are going there on a weekend evening, beware, the waiting is going to be long so be well prepared when you go. Ambience is decent, nothing extraordinary but nor is it bad so for me Banana Leaf is surely worth a try and I am sure you will go back for more

This south Indian food destination is definitely one which can be worth a visit. The food is really good and it is one of the best veg food joints that I have visited. But this restaurant has problems in departments other than food. The fact that the service is extremely slow is definitely something that has put me off from revisiting for a while. But besides this the ambience has a definite buzz to it. But because of the extremely poor service this restaurant is not on my restaurants to visit again list.

One of the last of the high end - operative word is high end - 'original south' Indian (veg) restaurants standing. Anand (Central Avenue) is moving steadily north and west, Swagath (Hazra Road) though continues to be good is showing early signs of going the Anand way as is Homely Raj.....
The food is very good and the service despite the high degree of unionisation is adequate. The thali is good and this is one of the few places that serves the south Indian parotta and veg kurma. The idlis are soft and fluffy, the dosas - avoid the Mysore masala dosa - are as good as any you would get in Sarvana Bhavan. Try the Kuzhi Paniryaram and the mini thali is interesting
The other thing is that even if you have to wait they manage the crowd very well .If you are planning to go with the family for a south Indian meal then this is the place

I love Banana Leaf. But just not today.
There is a total confusion as to which waiter is serving which table over here. I ordered for a plain dosq and chocolate milkshake. The dosa arrived on the table promptly, however was semi burnt. Upon almost finishing my dosa did the milkshake arrive. My ordertaker didnt bring the milkshake, some other person did. Vanilla milkshake was what was served to me. When I told him that I ordered for a chocolate milkshake, he rudely said that I should clear it out with my order taker. Upon completion of my dosa, I called my ordertaker and told him about the milkshake, he nodded, and I then placed an order of curd rice. The curd rice arrived with pickle and chilli. No appalam. Isnt curd tice everywhere served with atleast one piece of appalam?? Not here it seems. Midway through my curd rice did the chocolate milkshake arrive, which was decent in its own standard but not worth the hassle I had to go through.

I repeat, I love banana leaf, just not today. The meal served to me wasnt worth the 220rs bill.

The grievance of a commercialised place!!

My mother's side of the family grew up in Chetla, so this was a favorite haunt since childhood. Back then, it was called Komala Vilas (still written atop the building if you look closely). This was one of the first south indian 'tiffin' joints of kolkata, which the ubiquitous meat-eating bangali did not quite take seriously. But the scenario today is very different. As people are becoming more adventurous with food, this place is gaining ground with food lovers. The sweet-eater in me will start with dessert as usual, try their rawa kesari, it is orgasmic (pardon my lewd choice of words).
Here are my personal favorites - Cheese Onion Rava Dosa, Hot piping Sambhar Idlis, Sambhar Soaked Soggy Vadas, Bisebele Bhaat, Puliyogare, Sunday Thaali, Paratha Kurma, mini idli and Uttapam Platter. Go for breakfast in the morning for that freshly steamed hot piping soft mushy idlis. 
Also, also do check out the crowd (I love the mix) - ranging from second gen lake market hip south-indian to the intellectually driven kohl-lined bangali to the 9-yard saree-clad gold jewelery wearing pure blood Udupi.

Banana Leaf was on our 'must go' list for long but we never had the chance because of the long queue on holidays.
Last week my buddy and I finally made it and glad that we did.
This is a perfect "no-frill" place. Simple sitting arrangement. Well mannered stuff.
The food here speaks for itself. The menu has a wide variety of food. And drinks too. And in budget too!!
We had ordered one Uttapam Platter and one Mysore Masala Dosa.
The Uttapam platter consisted of 5 small ( and cute !! ) uttapams of different taste - onion, tomato, cashew, masala and plain. You get to taste the different kinds at one go. Very happy with the idea.
The Mysore masala dosa was good. Spicy and very tasty to my palate. 
Sambar and chutney is okay, i've had better.
It was really a nice experience and looking forward to taste more of their offerings.

Update of November 2014.
There have been a qualitative drop late. Good food not taste as good. On my last visit I asked for a ghee dosa. It did not have any flavour of ghee or butter. The waiter insisted it did and even brought out the butter used. It simply had a sour smell... no flavour.

...................

Tucked in inside the Komala Vilas hotel, almost opposite Lake Market, Banana Leaf is another of those places that have delighted loyal customers over the years. The restaurant though has slipped of late. The food is not as great as it used to be, but that does not take away the fact it still makes some pretty good stuff.

Once you enter, there is a main hall with at least two smaller rooms, which can be used when the main hall is full. The rooms are clean and well lit. Clean tables welcome you. Service is fast and efficient, but with the typical hurried sloppiness one can expect.

I usually avoid thalis, but my wife swears by them. They are rather well done, and substantial. I like their ghee dosas, not too crisp. The aroma of it almost makes you swoon :) The vadas are always hot and crisp. Never has it tasted re-fried or reheated to me. That is how it is meant to be.

I love their South Indian Coffees. I ask for it to be made strong, and it is flavourful and invigorating.

Prices are reasonable, and they will not hurt. If you have not, this is a must try.

Located in Rashbehari, banana leaf is a very nice place for south indian.The interiors are simple yet good.I have visited this place twice and both times it was a very good experience.I have tasted  rasam idli,plain vada,masala vada,masala rava dosa,dhania butter masala and all of them were tasty.The food is served pretty quick.The sambhar has a different yet good taste and tastes wonderful.
The food is priced well and this place is perfect for  breakfast with family. 
Though im a big fan of jyoti vihar, which in my opinion serves the best south indian in the city, but i also like banana leaf for a good change. :)

Location wise its at a very Prime area .
It is on the left hand side, just before the first left lane after the lake market crossing if you are going towards deshapriya park. The entrance board is nearly obscured by the plastics and shades of the street vendors.
You will see a huge mirror just above the entrance of the restaurant .
Pick a table .Sit down and be mesmerized by the wide range of Southern dishes they have to offer.
Ambiance- Brightly lit all around.With a feeling of a very busy Kitchen and the cooks trying hard to satisfy our hungry taste buds by their magical food.
Menu-Variety of dosas and idlis and every other southern dishes you can think of.See it yourself.
Food- We were two people and ordered  Sambar Idly,  Dahi(Curd) Vada,  Mysore butter masala Dosa,  Paper dosa,  Buttermilk and Tea.You can make it out how much we loved the food that we ordered so much.
The Dahi Vada needs to be in limelight.Star of the evening! The Vada was mediium in consistency,fresh like morning dew! The curd was awesome and fresh ! Its like cows and lactobacilli celebrating friendship day with a fresh feel.Smooth and buttery.
The Dosas were plenty in amount for one, Sambar idly was fresh and lively.  :-)
Mysore masala Dosa was a little spicy though..i loved it.
Buttermilk was salty and smooth with a nice aroma.Though i wished a sweet one..i told a staff to bring some sugar and he gladly gave me sugar syrup and then i made it my personal sweet butter milk! :-)
Nice and prompt service with surely helping staffs.
Bill was 427 only! So many things we had.
Pricing - Pocket friendly!
Quality of food- Awesome and fresh!
I am still full and burping ! :-)
Definitely RECOMMENDED!

This restaurant is quite close to my heart. I visited it for the first time with my mom and dad after waiting for a table for almost thirty minutes. Notwithstanding the long  and  tiring wait, we bonded a lot over mouthwatering Dosas and Idlis. I love this place. Every time I have been here a loved person has accompanied me. One day I wish to try the thali, which i never actually dared before, too much food.

Banana leaf is so close to my house but I only visited this place two years back for the very first time. I liked the ambience ..n more so cos I was famished after college on a hot summer day, so the chilled ac and less crowd felt like heaven to me. Coming to the food, I liked the crisp butter rava dosa and daal vada though I felt the sambhar could've been better, but nevertheless I make sure to visit this place whenever I have my dosa cravings!

In the wee hours of the morning,  I got on my bike and zoomed off. The destination in mind was Banana Leaf. For me it's located at the other end of the city, 17 kms away. But how can I stay away from the fresh grinded coconut chutney and the crispy dosa. So upon arrival I immediately ordered a plate of sambhar idli followed with a masal dosa and being defeated by my soaring appetite I ordered sambhar vada as well. The banana leaf on the plate just adds that natural feel to the awesome tasting dishes and yes the chutney of course. I would definitely recommend this place to any south indian food lover. Look for me when you're there,  I go there often.

Big waiting Que.
Not too much costly...
But Lots of space in side the leaf ;)

So if you love veggie South Indian food then it is a good place to go.

We had masala onion paneer dosa, tomato uttapam .. Lassi and rice sevai... Food is pretty crispy, rice sevai is desert basically... It was perfect.

Heard a lot about the place, especially from the senior members of the society. The place takes a little more effort to locate amidst the bustling road overtaken by hawkers, perhaps once you enter you may find the most typical Madrasi setting and a lacklustre decor.

Considering the rush at 8 in the evening we found ourselves lucky enough to find a table. I am a super-duper Dosa lover and ordered a masala onion dosa. Really liked the taste, however, the oil content was a lil on the higher side. An aunty by the side of my table broke out shouting on the manager complaining about the amount of oil. 

We also ordered sada vada. Trust me, those are the best vada's I ever had. Just fried, hot and crispy; something that will sure to melt on your tongue. Just loved it.

I wish to visit this place frequently and taste the other offerings too.

Being close to my home, and in my way back home from college, been there several times.
The Dosa or Idlis taste great. The Sambhar-Chutney Is awesome as well. Supplied in ample quantity. Still they top it up free of charge.
There is a real variety of times.The waiters are good. Feels like home after the number of times I have visited here.Duing Pujas, tough to get inside, after a real lonnng queue.

This place serves the best south Indian food in south Kolkata. Period!  

I just love the dosas and vadas here, really can't get enough of them! Though this place itself is neat and well lit, but I always prefer to take-away. And not to forget the price, it is really reasonable. I am by the way a hardcore non-vegeterian and really do not like to go to vegetarian restaurants. But Banana Leaf is surely an exception. Being a South Indian food lover this place is a piece of heaven to me. You will find this place crowded during rush hours but the staffs are prompt and well behaved. Do try out their masala dosa, Idli, Rasam and Vadas along with some filter coffee. The quantity is also good so you can fill in your tummy at reasonable rates with really delicious food, and ofcourse they are light on stomach, no issues with that. 

A must-visit place for all the people in love with south indian cuisine!

Cheers!

This is definitely an incomplete review, but couldn't resist from writing. The spoils of staying at Bangalore for 10 years now, is that my son needs Idlies atleast 3 to 4 times in a week, it is easier in Bangalore since you can get the batter easily and make idlies at home. 

When at Calcutta this is definitely a Challenge! so the easiest alternative is to pick up idlies from a Resturant. Luckily enough my parents stay at south Calcutta so the number of options are not limited. I best bet used to be Hotel Homely Raj, and the second alternative was Ramakrishna Tiffin home a maximum distance of 3 Kms from home. 

First day was from Raj, second from Ramakrishna and kept alternating for 4 days. However the missing aspect was good Sambar. On Day 7 a day before we left for Bangalore I gave Banana leaf a shot. Woah, the first thought after having the idlies was why didn't I try this before?!?!?! 

The best idlies, decent enough chutney and definitely the best, almost home like Sambar! The only issue is I didn't have days left in hand, and hence couldn't go back here. I am sure going by the idlies the rest of the food will be worth a visit.

I am definitely going back to this place in my next Calcutta visit! once again the best idlies by far at Calcutta and the sambar as thick as home made sambar :) happy!

The only avenue where this particular outlet loses points from me is because of their horrible sambhar.

So, well. This had been on my list from a very long time & finally I got an opportunity to visit this place. 

We ordered for an onion rava dosa & sambhar vada. 
I remember vividly the waiter had been quite surprised when we told him that we want the vada dipped in sambhar, and later we joked that he knew how horrible the sambhar is and hence that reaction T_T

Anyway, the place is pretty clean and yes, the AC's work well unlike jyoti vihar (another landmarked food joint serving South Indian cuisine.)

I really want to try their meal and the other varieties of dosa and uttapams. If only they changed their sambhar's recipe. Or allowed me to carry some from the hawker selling South Indian nearby. :3

I had heard rave reviews about this place from many of my friends. However, I was never motivated to go visit this place as the prospect of a vegetarian meal is not attractive to me. Recently an Uncle of mine who happens to be a Canadian national wanted to try dosas and idlis. So I had to decide between Jyoti Vihar and Banana Leaf. The easy availability of car parking tilted the decision in favour of Banana Leaf. The place was huge and sprawling and can seat a lot of people and it was evidently very popular. Almost all the tables seemed to be occupied and the place bustled with activity. We were promptly seated as a family was just leaving (and thankfully so). Immediately a cleaner appeared and cleaned the table. Very shortly a young waiter arrived and asked if we were ready with our orders. We had too many questions to ask and we started battering him with them and he tackled them all with ease. I went for the rava dosa as I was rather keen to try that out. Another order I was looking forward to try was the uttapam platter which another fellow diner had ordered. The rava dosa was fantastic and loved the textures and the flavours. The sambar was good and the tomato chutney which I had to ask for was excellent with generous spread of mustard seeds atop. The only thing I did not like at all was the coconut chutney which according to me was too watered down which resulted in diluted most of the flavours. The uttapams were quite buttery and delectable and I liked them, especially the cashew ones. The onions ones had too much onions in them. The tomato one I did not really like. The case with the chutneys was much the same. I had ordered chaas with the meal which was quite nice but a bit too diluted for my liking. The filter coffee after the meal was good and I was glad to have ordered it. Overall a good vegetarian eatery and service, prices and quantity are pretty good value for money. If I visit again, the possibilities of which seem quite remote given the cuisine being strictly vegetarian, I look forward to trying the parathas and other variations of the uttapam. IF and only IF I visit again. But don't let me deter you from visiting Banana Leaf.

Located on the busy Ras Behari Avenue, Banana Leaf is one restaurant every South Indian would be aware of. They serve authentic South Indian food unlike the other places in Kolkata. Although the ambiance is nothing great to write about it is hygienic and well lit. Coming to the food, I got reminded of my mom when I first tasted their Idlis. Not just their Idlis but every item on their menu tasted great. They have quite a large variety of Dosas ranging from the usual Masala Dosa to Cheese Dosa to the aromatic and fresh Dhaniya Dosa. Their Podi Dosas are the best of them all, in my opinion. The Vadas were cooked the way they should be, crispy outside and soft inside, and it was yummy too. DO NOT forget to taste their sweet, Rava Kesari. You will find pure ghee floating on the rim of the cup. Rava Kesari with so much ghee can hardly go wrong! The price is reasonable and the service is fairly quick. 

Banana Leaf is a place that took me on a nostalgic trip with every bite. I now visit the place pretty often whenever I miss my mom's food. In short it is a place that serves great hygienic home food at a reasonable price.

What Matunga is to me in Bombay is Lake Market to me in Calcutta. This South Indian hub in the southern part of the city is near to my house. Given my liking of South Indian snacks and meal it is obvious that i paid this place several visits. Not that the restaurant is new but the recent(few years now) facelift is what has caught attention of people. This restaurant served  the guests of Komala Vilas which is typicallly a hotel run and resided by people visiting from Southern part of India. Convenient location(5 mins walk from Rashbehari Avenue Junction), cleanliness are other positives besides very authentic south indian (Tamil) fare. Try out all kinds  of dosas, vadas and uttapams closing with filter coffee. And must try the evening dinner thali. They have some juices, fresh lime soda and other coolers to freshen you up on a humid summer evening. Expect to queue up on friday and weekend evenings. Counting days for my next visit to the City of Joy !

My friend noticed this place while my south Indian taste buds are tinkling. This place can be found broad darkness as it is situated on main road Rashbehari. As both our stomachs are aching with hunger, we decided to have a mouthful food. And what else would be greater than a full tally Dosa. The place was big enough to breathe and a bit rushy too. The decoration was nothing much, simple chair and tables. 

So we placed ours as soon as we got hold of the menu. And then we longed for our food, we reminded twice our waiter that we have already placed our orders. And then our food came, not to impress us, but to depress. As I had the Dhania Onion Dosa, the taste was not fine; the onions were cooked at all. But on the opposite side my friend was eating uttapam, when I sampled his plate I envied him. His Uttapam was super soft and savory too. The chutney was quite flavorful.  

On the terms of service they are not that prompt, need to work on their skills. But they have a prolonged list of varied Dosa, if you have south Indian taste buds, you can have a go.

Hi All,

My genuine feedback is as below:

1. I guess this restaurant is run by Lunatics. Two days in a row in the morning I went to try their food and as I was denied entry as I was there by 07:57 Hrs. (Which means 3 minutes early, as the restaurant opens at 8 am). Who in this world does this in service industry, tell me ? What the bloody hell ?

2. I somehow thought of trying their food, going by lot of recommendations and positive feedback from the site and Hence, entered during evening by around 8 pm, found that there are chaos in a small stinking hall, though I struggled to get a seat somewhere in the corner. 

3. Finally the food. I ordered only Rotis (Chapatis) and found that the chapaties are coated with thick oil and nothing else.

Wah !!! Wah !!!

What a Freaking restuarant it is .. Since then, I never thought of going there at all.

Guys, Better Avoid this place.

Regards.

I like to think that people go to high end restaurants for the experiance but they go the small, affordable, round the corner places for the memories. Banana Leaf is one such place where you usually have countless memories of convinient, cheap yet oddly satisfying meals with friends and family.
I have been coming here since I was in college and that's like 8years. Not much have changed since. Well, the decor little bit but nothing else much.
The food have been most consistent. I don't know much about authenticity by judging by the taste this is as good as it can get. And that's all I need. I have tried most of their fare. The dosa be it rava, paper, dhania, podi or mysore, are always crispy with generous amount of condiments and undeniably great tasting. The amount of cheese the put in the cheese variants is insane!! The balance of tangy crisp dosa batter along with gooey melting cheese is Heaven!! Same goes for the uttapam. I could easily choose them over any renowned pizza chain. The vada are crisp and airy and the best in all of Kolkata. The idli are the softest and fluffiest I have ever had. It is here that I had my first curd rice. And since it has become a prominent feature in my comfort food list!! I just love the fried curd chilli that is served with it. A must try!!! The Thali is enormous!! The sheer number of components!! The Rava Kesari makes sure that even the person with serious sweet tooth is satisfied. And lastly the two beverages-Filter coffee and sweet lassi. The filter coffee is strong perfect for an immediate charge in the morning with their perfect breakfast platter. Or throughout the day when you really need that slap of awareness!! The sweet lassi is thick, sweet and will leave you with a contended sigh. 
The ambiance is simple and clean. The waiter friendly and attentive. I go most saturdays for breakfast and they always greets me with a smile.
Banana Leaf represents the essential of south indian vegetarian food-simple and unpretentious.

This the South Indian Restaurant I always frequently go to. I have never been disappointed. Ever.
The Idlis - TASTY ( Try the Mini ones , they are really cute and obviously tasty) Light, fluffy goodness.
The Dosas- Masala, cheese, plain all of them are two things : Crunchy and delicious.
The Uttapams-  My personal favorite , lot's of varieties and again delicious. 
The Sambar, Chutney some of the best I have had and I have lived in Chennai for three years so yes, I know my Sambar and Chutney very well you see ! 
Simple South Indian food at it's best :)

I was quite taken aback to realize that I had yet to review Banana Leaf and decided to correct my error immediately :-) .... this place serves some of the best South Indian food Kolkata has to offer ... even though I enjoy my Idli, Dosa and Vada south Indian food is not my cuisine of choice however this is one of the few places I am ever ready to drop into. Its well prepared , simple , unpretentious food at its best actually and very pocket pleasing as well. This place is always full so be prepared to wait a few minutes .... its worth the wait. The Idli is soft and fluffy , the Vada perfect crisp on the outside and soft inside and the Cheese Dosa and the Mysore Butter Masala Dosa are yummy. Great chutney which they will keep refilling generously adds to the lip-smacking experience. If you love your Dosa's and have not eaten here your seriously missing out !

I have been hearing about banana leaf and lots and lots of appreciation for it since last 4-5 years but got formally introduced to the place not before a couple of years.

Located at a convenient location opposite the lake mall, parking is easily available in the lane beside. The sidewalk in front of it is crowded with a lot of small shops and stalls that could well make one miss the place while driving so caution is advised in this aspect !!! The restaurant is big, well lit, neat and clean. The seats are more or less comfortable and not so cramped up for space. The staff are polite, courteous and fast.

Banana leaf is undoubtedly one of the best destinations for south indian food in kolkata and the most lovely part of it is the menu which is soooo comprehensive providing you some of the items which is not available elsewhere in the city. The rates are decent and presentation on banana leaf gets the place a lot of appreciation. But i am still in wait for  a place in Kolkata that serves you direct on the banana leaf instead of using a steel plate underneath.

Upma, idlis are good. Vadas are as crisp as you can get. They are the only place who serve paniyaram. Though i would not say theirs is great but paniyaram here is good enough and value for money. Molaga podi is better than that at raj, anand in my opinion. I am not fond of their sambhar but love their chutney. Rava dosas etc are very well made and are crisp. Dosa masala is good. South indian thali served here is one of the best in kolkata. Filter coffee is nice but being served in small steel bowl and glass makes it amazing giving a very old school homely feel. Only tea is served like that in other south indian restaurants alas !! Deserts are decent but i would love them serving payasam.

In a nutshell, they have got a huge menu and everything on the menu is well made. But as we all know, better the place, longer would be the queues so a bit of waiting especially on the weekends is a high probable before one gets to relish the food here.

This is my go-to place for South Indian fare. The Sambhar is the best in the city. The Chutney could do with much more improvement.

The Idlis are quite soft and tasty. The Cheese Dosa is Yummm !!!

The Uttapam is also quite nice. The Dosa's masala is one of the Best I have had.

The seating is okay. It could be improved.

The staff is quite polite and welcoming.

In my city of joy Banana Leaf is a South Indian vegetarian Restaurant where we can find Bengali palate friendly South Indian dishes. I have visited the place too many times when I felt hungry in Rashbehari area. 
Date of visit – Too many times in & last in October 2013.
Decor: 3
Seating Capacity: 4
Service Time: 4
Food: 4

Items ordered & how they taste :-   
1) Butter Rava Masala Dosa - The particular Rava Dosa was excellent in taste. Mainly the crispy rava was too much delicious. But the sambar was too much thick which I felt uneasy with ( taste was too good). 
2) Davi Vada-   Dahi vada was great in taste. The vadas were too soft to bite & fully soaked with Dahi. But I found that the Jeera masala was slightly burnt & made the taste bitter. 
3) Lassi- It was fabulous with thick Dahi. 
4) Special Sweet - I found the sweet not at all tasty, & it had too too much sugar in it.

The ambience was nearly Ok. The staffs were humble, polite but didn't understand bengali many times. The price is in a little  higher side. Overall the place is very much advisable for tasting South Indian Food in Kolkata.

BANANA LEAF- "SERVING SOUTH INDIAN FOOD ON BANANA LEAVES"

 The hub for south indian food for the people staying nearby RASHBEHARI and GARIAHAT. The name suits the place because they provide you classic south indian food on steel plates having banana leaves over them. It is located at Prem Vilas building which is 5 minutes walking from Lake Market towards Gariahat on the left hand side. 

About the Place:

 When i visited this place it was totally crowded and i had written my name outside with the guard and within 5 minutes i was given a seat. As i visited inside, this place was not like other south indian joints but it had a simple environment, maintained, cleaned and having various frames attached with the wall depicting this place. The environment was not at all cluttered despite being crowded at their peak hours ( 7-10 Pm) and the staffs were working at excellent speed. When you visit this place, the first thing the will come to your notice is that most people are having "Thali"  because its cheaper and stomach filling. 

About the food:

I had planned to peep in just a few days back with my family and had ordered the following dishes:- 

1) Upma
2) Sambhar Vada
3) Rava Masala Dosa
4) Special Banana Leaf "Sweet"

1) The Upma was tender, light and served hot. In certain places i see, they serve you with all the dishes at a time but over here the dining rules were maintained despite being so crowded and staffs were kind and helpful too. 

2) Sambhar Vada was succulent and served hot with thick sambhar making the Vada more delectable and inviting.

3) Rava Masala Dosa was more on the crispy side but very braise and thick.

4) Unfortunately, the sweet dish had a problem as said by staff, it was disappointed at first but on my request, he got a cup of it for me to taste. It tasted like some sort of a halwa cooked in coconut oil having immense amount of sugar. This dish is prepared in this way only by the south indians (by adding substantial sugar).  So, for sugar people, its not advisable. 

Suggestions:- 

1) The sambar was too thick. If made a little on the lighter side it would be great. 
2) Oil content was little on the higher side so please try to maintain it as much possible. 

Conclusion:

I had a wonderful experience because:-

1) I did not have to wait for food.
2) Service was prompt.
3) Prices were pocket friendly. 
4) Quality and quantity of food is up to the mark. :-)

I was at my parent's place. Went out shopping and was super tired while returning. Mom suggested we stop at this small South Indian restaurant close to our house for dinner. Reluctantly we gave in, coz from the outside it didn't look very appealing! We, brother-sister have become very fussy about our food I guess :P

There was a waiting for 30 mins!! The whole place was crowded and I really wanted to check this place now! So we waited patiently. It's got a guest house in the same compound so thankfully there were a few chairs in the waiting room. After about 20 minutes we heard our name being called out. I saw inside, the whole restaurant was packed! Wow, what a sight! Reminded me of Andhra Bhawan at Delhi immediately! 

We sat down and within two minutes, we all knew what we were ordering! Dad went for a thali, mom called for a Dosa, me for Idli and my brother for idli-wada. Food came very quickly too. Daddy was so excited with this thali. There were too many things, sabji and rasam and suji halwa, papad, puris and rice. And everything was unlimited! My Idlis were soft and fantastic, dosa was crisp and sambhar was as authentic as it can get. 

I loved my quick meal. Everyone was satisfied on the table. There is so much rush here that sometimes you can be left unattended. But I will not hold this against them, coz when they serve you, they do it with full zeal. The waiter on our table actually came to us and asked if we wanted more sambhar as it was getting over! 

It is a good place for quick food, amazing taste and great service.

When I think dosas in Calcutta, the name that flashes in my mind without a second thought is Banana Leaf. This place has been standing with its heads high for over 8/9 years now - a perfectly clean look, quick service and true to its name taste. 
I have tried everything from the dosas, idlis, vadas and thalis here. I have even crossed deep, waist-length water logging on the mainroad to satisfy my craving for cheese dosa. The dosas are so perfect that even in Vishakapatnam they kept coming back to me. They are huge, served with two chutneys and sambar. The garlic chutney is a must try and do ask for it if they do not serve it at the first go. Years back, they used to serve it without a request for it. 
If you are a fond of South Indian thalis, please try the meal here. Cheap, sumptious and filling is how I recollect my meal escapades. I love the orange suji halwa they serve as dessert with the meal. It is available separately on the menu too.
It would be a sin not to mention their filter coffee and milkshakes. Just absolutely thick and perfect to wash down one's meal. 
I LOVE BANANA LEAF!!

Banana leaf is located inside the Komala Villas Hotel right at Lake Market. It is one of the newer restaurants serving Veg south Indian food at reasonable pricing. When I say reasonable I meant prices which do justice to the food, ambiance and service :) 

I have been to Banana leaf many number of times in the last few years and have never been disappointed with the food. It is a perfect place to go for breakfast or lunch with friends and even with your family. 

Recently I had gone there on a Saturday morning for breakfast with my mom. We ordered a Podi Masala Dosa and a sada vada. The Podi Masala dosa was quite filling with generous filling of potato based masala inside. The dosa was garnished with spicy Podi (also known as gunpowder). Though the podi masala was not very authentic, but it is one of the best that you can get in Kolkata or South Kolkata for that matter. The dosa was big and quite filling. Dosa was complimented with 2 bowls of Sambar and a bowl of White chutney, both of which tasted very nice.
The sada vada consisted of 2 big vadas which were hot, crispy and light. 
On previous occasions, I have tried the plain masala dosa, the plain cheese  dosa and idly as well. The dosas are pretty big and the masala dosas very filling. If I have one of their masala dosas for breakfast, I am compelled to skip lunch ! That is the only complaint I have ! :) Pricing is also justified. A meal for two should not cost more than Rs200 (as per my appetite)  unless you are experimenting with the fancy and costlier items on the menu. The filter coffee is not that great, I have had better filter coffee for less elsewhere.
Service was fast. We were served both the items within 5 minutes of our order. Ambiance is clean and bright. The restaurant can easily accommodate around 40 diners. The washroom is clean with good quality hand wash and an electronic hand dryer.

I really dont have anything to complaint about. When I think about South Indian veg food, this is the first choice :) Definitely deserves a 4.5

If you want to have the tiniest miniest cutest ever mini idlis, come here! The food is served hot and fresh and the service is prompt. My only hiccup was that the second variety of chutney (the orange-coloured, tangy one) usually served with dosa was not complimentary and served only on request!!

Banana Leaf is the undisputed king of South Indian Restaurants in the Ballygunge-Hazra region(with close competition from Swagath Restaurant). This place is reminiscent of the typical pocket friendly and down to earth South Indian eatery. It is packed during the weekends, which means minimum 15-20 minutes waiting time if you come unannounced. The food inside more-or-less justifies the queue.  

Above the usual Idli/Dosas, worth trying are the Idippam (which is very light and tasty) and Rava Kesari (which accompanies the Thali). Coconut chutney served here is truly authentic and I totally loved it. Finishing your meal with a Filter coffee is highly recommended. 

The service is mediocre. Once I had a bad experience when one of the waiters tried to argue with me that Bisi-Bele Bath is the same as Sambhar Rice (which we had ordered) ! When we further requested to pack some of our food on our table, he simply handed over empty plastic boxes to us and didn’t bother to do any further. 

Overall, a nice eatery especially recommended for all the vegetarian folks out there.

Perfect place to go out with your friends for South Indian Cuisine!!! The specialty is their south Indian Meal/Thali...  Thali has 14 varied items and also offers you unlimited poori :) and rice with tasty daal powder and ghee....
Cause I have been there many a times, I have tasted almost every south Indian variety they offer.... Dosa and uttapam can give a tough competition to the good south Indian outlets of Bangalore.... 

However, i am not satisfied with the service level..  it takes a lots of time to serve all the dishes except Thali.... the steward and polite but you need to call them multiple times to reach them...

Banana Leaf actually provides the real south indian essence. The Thali is excellent and interesting one must say (unlimited for that matter!) We Bengalis generally go for so called safer S.Indian items like idli, dosas...but trust me (and this place) and go for the real s.indian adventure, While the thali consisting of 10-12 items was excellent ,I was not fully satisfied with the Paneer Masala Dosa, which was not more than average .
The staff, other facilities are kind of OK and essentially South Indian.

Banana Leaf serves the most authentic South Indian food in Kolkata. Meaning to say, that it serves all other dishes like - appams, various types of rices etc., apart from the usual idli, dosa, vada and utthapam. Food is fresh and tasty. Prices are moderate. Resultantly, the place is always packed. Many of the customers are the ones who come there for their daily lunch break. Ambiance is very moderate. Nothing great about that.

Food is good but not exceptional. They are offering a good number of dishes and not just idli/dosaz. Plain dosa was just like any other food joint. Butter cheese masala dosa was good but that was because of the cheese..rest all very normal. I tried the podi which is made by mixing dal and spice powder in til oil. I can't compare as I had it for the first time in my life. It was spicy and tasty. But again not mindblowing :) Filter coffee was awesome..best I had in many years!

I donno about other dishes...but with this first time experience I can say that visit it if you are nearby...not worth a long travel ( like i did from dumdum to JD park ). Decent eating experience...price is decent if compared overall...

Hated this place. Went last saturday. Waited for 20 mins outside. Ordered cheese masala dosa, cheese uttapam, rawa dosa, vada, soda. All came with just sambar & nariyal chutney. I was hoping for some special chutneys (as they serve in chennai/blore) but nothing. Preparation was bad as well. The dosa/vada available in Mumbai streets are even better! Not worth.

I am not much of a south indian foody but since my mom loves it, I decided to check this one out. The location is very apt and can be easily found without any hassle. the ambiance is also good. One thing that I noticed is the  restaurant maintains cleanliness. I had masala dosa, buttermilk and rava kesar. To state my experience in one word I would say FRESH. Yes, the food was absolutely fresh. Be it dosa, sambar or even the buttermilk. The rava kesar was piping hot. After my disappointing experience at The Chennai Restaurant I had nt given much thought having South Indian food again. But Banana Leaf has changed my thoughts and am certainly going to recommend this one to everyone. The food is served on the plate with banana leaf on it :) Many places charges extra for adding sambar or chutney after first time but here the waiters asks frequently for sambar or chutney and its totally free. The place will certainly add smile to your place and you will surely like to visit it again and again. So without thinking much I am rating Banana Leaf 4.5 because I still think that the interior could be improved.

Yesterday was my first day at this place. I along with my dad went out for a little shopping at south city mall , and while returning we thought of having a bit of veg food , instead of the regular non-vegetarian. So came to this place. Ordered an onion dosa for myself and a masala dosa for my dad. Believe me, it was the best south-indian i've ever had in Kolkata!.So was the taste of the sambhar and the chutney!!...SIMPLY AWESOME!!..The ambience was good , restaurant filled with sophisticated people, i want to say it was a very good experience for both of us. Looking forward to visit again

If you don't know South Indian food, the food can be considered edible, if only barely. If you like good South Indian food, avoid this palate insulting and tired chain of eateries. Servers are rude and stingy with the Thali servings too, adding insult to injury. Better to go some place more authentic and decent like South India Club our Hotel Homely Raj.

Having spent close to a decade in the southern part of India, I can swear by the taste that Banana Leaf offers. The staff is cordial and they keep serving you rice in meal orders until you drop dead eating. Do try the special meals on sundays and going by the quantity served, I can assure that u might not need to have lunch for the next day too. The place is simple and non-pompous but who cares when one can go along with family without being stared at, for everyone is more interested in the platter in front.
I strongly recommend.

a place that started as komala vilas and later came to be known as banana leaf. come on a sunday and you are bound to have a waiting time of 30 mins. the food is pretty food but recently aren't as good as the used to be. I still remember the cheese onion dosa to be oozing cheese but was a tad disappointed the last time I visited. they have a wide variety of dosas which are equally good. this place happens to be the very few places where they serve hot idlis. the cheese uttapam is pretty decent. the thalis are also pretty good but one thing you should definitely avoid there is the appam. still one of the better south indian joints.

THE BEST SOUTH INDIAN THALI IN CALCUTTA.

It's simply wow. The place definitely can do a bit more with the decor (which is decent at best), but you anyway won't waste time looking at the decor. Service is pretty good. If you go for the Thali (or the Sunday special thali), don't forget to ask for PODI (powder) and ghee. The waiters happily oblige every time. The service is pretty good, the price tag is quite small.

The place does NOT give you a PREMIERE EATING EXPERIENCE, but provides some awesome food. 

Banana Leaf Thali.... any day for me. Any day.

Aah,Banana Leaf!! you made me fall in love with South Indian cuisine!!! I visited you the 4th time(or is it 5th??),this year..and I still can't get enough of you!! You surpass all the standards,ranging from ideal location,to lovely ambience to ethereal food to friendly staff to light on the pocket factor :)
I commenced my share of surreal food experience(thanks to you) with the paper cheese masala dosa...never imagined,that such a weird fusion could taste so awesome...then the cold coffee with icecream..it was too good,but ya,i expected the missing dollop of vanilla... :(

The traditional south indian thali,is just..just so delightful..and extravagant..i felt like a queen while savouring it.The best thing in the thali was that suji halwa cooked in desi ghee...i am sure it had traces of elixir in it! The rasam idli,was nice...but a bit hot on the taste buds...the sweet lime soda was sooo refreshing,everytime i sipped,i felt that i slipped into a jacuzzi :D

Two days back,when i visited you,i swore never to eat pizza again..reason?Your cheese Uttapam :*..so tender and sumptuous topped with a generous layer of cheese...i'll always opt for it,henceforth :) The lassi is a wow,so creamy,with no lumps to stick on to your lips,and with the perfect amount of sweet...

So you see,My Dearest Banana LEaf..how you made me fall in love with you,and the food you serve...and trust me,i don't hesitate to yell out."YOU ARE THE BEST SOUTH INDIAN RESTAURANT IN THE CITY"...because no other south indian restaurant has made me burp so happily :p

 J'aime manger votre cuisine :)

One of the relatively newer South Indian joints in the locality and it is situated inside Komala Vilas which is opposite Lake Market.
It is probably one of the very few Air conditioned South Indian joints in the area and serves proper quality South Indian food.
The decor is also pretty good considering the other options I keep referring to.
The food is very good in fact the rava dosa and the paneer dosa are a must try.
The uttapams are very good and do give the uttapam platter a try which consists of 4 mini uttapams.
Try out their upma or the meals and you will not be disappointed but the thing that you surely must appreciate is the care they take in making the chutney or the sambar.
You can also try out their idiyappams(or however they are spelt as they are pretty good.
Since its been some time since my last visit and the menu given at zomato is not extensive I cannot refer a few other dishes that are there on offering.
However go for it and even from the choices mentioned above am sure you will like the place and its food.
The best thing about this places is that the waiters here are very courteous and have a nice smile on their face while they approach you which is often missing in a regular South Indian joint. This helps you to create a bonding with the place.

Perhaps the Best Vegetarian South Indian restaurant in Kolkata !!!!
I've been going to Banana Leaf for more than 4 years now.
The special Thali(served on Sundays) is great. All you can eat! I counted 18 items. :D
And they go on filling it up as you finish. The Sweet podi is very sweet, otherwise everything is perfect in the menu.
I have a thing for cheese, and the cheese butter masala is awesome. Its filled with hot gooey cheese, and fried in butter. The aloo is worth a special mention. Flavoured to perfection, not too spicy, Yumm.
Also the Mysore Cheese Butter Masala dosa is great! It's like the Cheese Masala Dosa, but comes with a special filling of fried dal and spices. Must try.
All the dosas come with sides of rasam, sambar and coconut chutney! Unlike other places, the coconut chutney here is actually made of coconut and not uradh dal and coconut.
The dahi vada and chaas(buuter milk) should also be tried.
And they serve authentic filter coffe as well. :)
Highly Recommended !

A very important tip for those going to Banana Leaf: never underestimate South Indian food!

One of the very good South Indian food joints in Kolkata, Banana Leaf has a typical 1990s South Indian joint ambience. It is essentially a family dining place. The food is very good, especially the upma, uttappam and the rava dosa. The idly vada combo is killer. But, do not try its new idly item (I'm forgetting the name) for it is EXTREMELY spicy and not worth the taste. The chutney also reeks of coconut oil. The sambar, however, is a frequent repetition during our meals!!

Overall, it is good with is conventional South Indian food!

Been to this place today...First things first....i happen to be a vegetarian Bong...and hunting for some of the best veggie dishes is what keeps me busy during the weekend.. must say this place was totally not on my list.. With some tip from a colleague at work i came here today..and well got what i had expected..the ambiance was really good...the whole menu has authentic south indian delicacies which 1 should really watch out..these people have taken extra care in putting detail into what goes into each dish..some pages even had the history and origin of the dish mentioned on it which really is something new i cam across..
Tried the Cheese Rava Masala Dosa which was thick with Cheese...(Yuumm)..not to mention Uttapam and Vada...to end with i took a dessert..cant recall the name but its the best halwa i tasted after Rajdhaani..to sum it up a wonderful experience...

Although i dint try the Meal..have seen the items and it is more than enough for anyone to finish...next time i would make sure to taste that...

Relish foods on green banana leaves at Banana Leaf
3.5 out of 5

If you are a die-hard fan of South Indian delicacies then Banana Leaf is a must visit place for you. Situated on Rashbehari Avenue behind Vindhyas, Banana Leaf is a perfect choice for trying authentic South Indian delicacies. Contrary to their simple get up, their culinary art is really impressive. After tasting South Indian preparations in many food joints in Kolkata, I am bound to give Banana Leaf a high rating because of their superbly prepared dosas, idlis, upma and a lot of other South Indian dishes. 

Service is also quite prompt and you will never feel disappointed or see your chutney and samber bowls empty because someone will fill your add-on bowls from time to time even before you call for it. To start with their culinary skills, any item you order is served on clean and fresh green banana leaves over a plate. This typical South Indian way of representation is really very alluring if you want a traditional south Indian culinary experience. 

The dosas and vadas are very crisp and soft. Idlis are also very soft. Now, we all know that dosa-idli-vada are some common South Indian dishes that almost all South Indian eateries serve, but if you want to go beyond this, Banana Leaf is the right place. There is hardly any other restaurant that offers such a wide variety of South Indian delicacies. Paniyarams, Puttu, Idiyappam, etc. are some excellent preparations here along with their special thali and varieties of rice preparations. The thali consists of so many items that it is more than enough for a person. Another important thing about their chutney or rasam is that it is always fresh and they never serve old chutney that leaves an excessive sour taste on your palate. In addition, their prices are nominal as well.

If South Indian food is your thing, then Banana Leaf is the place. Located on Rashbehari Avenue,  this place offers you a wide variety to choose from. I am not a lover of South Indian food but the one time I was here I found their stuff pretty decent. We tried the Cheese Masala Dosa and the Onion Uttapam. The place is clean and the staff are nice. Decent place. 3.5 on 5

Great place for south indian vegetarian food. The ambiance is simple, service okay, but the food is great. The thali is too much food for me, but I love a plate of lemon rice or curd rice here for summer lunch. If you get there after 7 p.m. , try their Appam Kurma with the Paniyarams as a starter, really tasty. 

Dosas are great. If you dont mind spice have one with gunpowder. I just adore the upma here. Its soft and incredibly tasty. Try that with a cup of filtered coffee.

Being a Avid fan of South Indian food,I always prefer Banana Leaf for south Indian delicacy.The food is excellent and it is 100% veg.Having visited banana leaf for every successive Sundays for a period of time,I can assure you if that a South Indian food-fan Banana Leaf will surely make you come back

The weekend thali is a must try as is contains so many side dishes as well they give a serving of puris and rice and it serves as a very filling meal.But be sure to go before 3pm as it is available till 3pm only.
The dosas are very well done and I have tried plain,masala,cheese,paper dosas ..all of them taste best if compared to other South indian Joints in that particular area in Kolkata. If you want Indian pizza then you can go for cheese,onion,tomato,butter uttapam :D

The service is really nice and they serve quick even if the place is packed up.....but sometimes they can lag so much that you might get angry.There is no special ambiance and the looks are simple.

Overall I give this restaurant a 4 stars for there service and food....This is the one of the restaurant which I will go back in the future

This place is really worth it. And to clarify, I am not a fan of South Indian dishes at all. In fact, given the option of choosing any number of times, I would choose any other cuisine over South Indian all through.

But this wonderful little piece of the land beyond the Vindhyas in Kolkata is impressive. It serves authentic, fresh and perfectly cooked food - be it the butter milk, the rasam, the vada, the dosa or the idlis. You will not be able to fault the dishes, no matter how much you try. To add to it, the pricing is also quite reasonable! If you want to go beyond the usual idli-dosa affair, you can ask the waiter and he will be able to guide you expertly. The meals, too, I have been told, are excellent. The dessert section for me was not exactly scintillating but quite above average.

Verdict: I don't like South Indian food. But if I have no other options, I would choose either Banana Leaf or Anand.

Banana Leaf is currently one of the best restaurants that serve vegetarian South Indian food. Apart from the more commonly eaten idlis and dosas, it offfers very good thali/meal combinations, and there are a range of side dishes that make a visit to this place worthwhile.

The Weekend Thali is a great favourite of mine. The number of items in it can make it seem quite daunting, but my trick is to eat as little rice as possible and concentrate what is on the plate. I find their rasam excellent and their vegetable curries quite good. For the sweert dish, they usually serve a sticky kesar-laced halwa, but, if you are lucky, you will be served Sweet Pongal, which uses sugarcane jaggery as the sweetener.

Another class of items they make well are those that contain the spice combination they call "gunpowder". While it is slightly different from the gunpowder one gets in Madras, a plate of idlis or a dosa sprinkled with this mixture tastes quite good. It would be good, though, if they brought some sesame oil in along with these items.

The service is usually quick, even when the place is crowded. There is no decor as such, but the place is usually kept clean. This is a place I have been to several times, and provided the quality stays the same or improves, I will visit it again.

The food has a home like quality. The thalis are "not finish-able" in terms of quantity. Dosas are average.

This is a really good South Indian restaurant. I had the Podi Cheese Masala Dosa, Sambar Vada and Lassi. The podi is  is a coarse mixture of ground dry spices that contains dried chillies, urad (bean), chickpea and sesame seeds. I've found this special item only in this place among various other South Indian restaurants. The taste of cheese with podi is really good and the lassi was not bad either. Service was pretty good, given the Durga Puja rush. Overall, it deserves a 3.5 from me. A must try out for Dosa lovers!

It is located in Lake Market, near Kalighat metro station! It is a part of Kamala Villa which is a hotel! Most of the times it is very crowded since it is one of the best among others serving  south indian cuisine! Their menu is elaborate and all the dishes with south indian names are explained :) 
They make the best puri, one of the best dosas, and brilliant halwa! If you root for quantity then you may try their south indian meals whch is actualy the south indian famous Thali s! But may I warn you that the south indian meals are very elaborate and hard to finish! Mini meals are enough for the normal gulpers! On top of that the place is very clean! Staff is friendly! It is in short one of the best places to visit for south indian food lovers! And the prices are reasonable! A complete package! Do visit and enjoy! :)

One of the pioneers of South Indian food in this city ! Situated at the heart of South Kolkata, Banana Leaf is a must visit to all Dosa-Idli lovers. I would not say each item is fairly charged compared to other South Indian joints in that area, nonetheless it is a worthwhile experience. The Dhania Cheese Dosa and Mysore Dosa needs special mention. Also, the coffee is quite refreshing. Banana Leaf deserves a 3.5 from me.

A very high rating because of the food, a much is left to be desired to the interior decoration and ambiance. Would suggest better lighting and decor which will make the place feel warm, it actually give a dull feel. 

Also a better marketing should be done,since the age bracket of people who visit this place mostly consists of family ,the youngsters don't feel at home.

Food wise I would rate this very highly as the rates are extremely affordable and the quality and variety is hardly matched by any other south-indian restaurants in the city.

Best south Indian restaurant in South Kolkata. Price is rightly charged and food is awesome. Idlis are always served steaming hot. Dosas are of many variety and are of excellent taste and quality. Sambhar, chutney served with dishes are very well prepared and tasty. One of the main USP of this place is cleanliness.
Idli , butter masala dosa , rava  dosa is recommended. Although the thali here is also worth the bucks. One may try the PAPER MASALA DOSA for fun.

I love southindian, but for some reason this place just do for me.

we called for rasam and believe me i hv hd better rasam than this place in uk( which is not a place you would expect to find authentic southindian food) the rasam was plain salty.

The idly, vada and the rice dough ball thing was average. The sambar was decent but the chatni was again, disappointing. We had also called for cheese mix veg uttapam which was good.

After all this i went though a surprising incident, i have developed a taste for rice mixed with gunpowder and ghee with pickle, surprisingly enough there was no steamed rice in the menu. When i asked the waiter he said i had to take a thali in order to be served steamed rice (which is complimentary, unlimited servings with a thali) I asked for the manager and explained to him that i wouldn't mind paying for curd rice or lemon rice, just serve me plain steamed rice instead and gun power is served complimentary at all southindian restaurants any ways and inspite of rice being served complimentary he simply refused to give me steamed rice even for a charge and just said 'no' and turned around and left. Having lost home in the management of this place ordered a thali had just rice and gunpowder both being complimentary items and had to waste the rest cos i simply didnt want to have it in the first place.

This place is reasonable for south indians who want to have the thali there for lunch.

For me its a never coming back again experience....

The best part is, the waiters are really helpful and sweet, and suggests great things which you might overlook. The other day I was suggested the Paniyarams, and they were gorgeous! i also love eating the kurma paratha, which is a great thing for those who do not want to eat dosas.

I have been visiting this place for quite some time, this is my all time favorite South Indian restaurant.
It's not high on decor and the place though is air conditioned is pretty ordinary, most of the times it is crowded, so do not expect a nice quiet place.
According to me the best dish here are the mini idlis ! I love them, they are cute and filling.

Over-rated, considering their overall quality has gone down from the days I first visited the place. While one can take in most of what's on offer, at least I can't take in their not-so-great thickish sambhar, which is hardly ever piping hot! The last thing you need is lukewarm sambhar!

Simply Awesome! 

its a shame that i have never been to this place earlier. as u enter u get that very aromatic south indian whiff ! i mean like its sets u in the mood and whets the appetite. 

to begin with the classic neer more.. or butter milk was yumm... light refreshing.. yet packed in flavor. and teh idlis were soft as cotton. it took me exactly 3 mins to finish a plate of idli sambhar, the sambhar was simply divine. i like the fact that they used broad beans and radish in the sambhar bringing it very close to authentic sambhar that i have eaten down south. 

had the podi dosa and special chutney as a main. and i cant tell u how light that dosa was. there wasnt a single drop of extra oil on the dosa yet it was crisp. most doas including ones at some of the veteran restaurants  are oily. the malligapodi/ gun puwder was simply awesome. 

cant wait for the next visit... its got to be the utthapam platter.. 

KUDOS !

Visited today. Serving was quick enough. Ambience was good for a normal brunch. Neways coming to food. Ghee dosa should be given a try as it comes in a hat shaped form and tastes good too. 

Special mention : Lassi should be given a try as in 45 bucks u get a Tummy full of 'Thick Milk'.

Negatives:1. Paneer was not there so paneer dosa was unavailable even in noon time.
2. a little cruel on your wallet if you are on a crunch and cost-friendly food.

If u are ready to spend a few bucks on South Indian food in banana leaf and a 'katori' glass this place is ideal.

Although I had heard about this place from a couple of reliable sources (people whom I trust with their food & restaurant choices) I finally managed to visit this place yesterday. 

Ordered 2 plates of Idly-Vada along with 'Sukkha /or/ Special' Chutney. 
Both the Idly & Vada were cooked to perfection. Special mention for the succulent soft idlis. A point to be mentioned here is that the Sambhar served along with it was a tad bit lukewarm. 

Moving on with the order, my wife ordered an Onion-Cheese-Masala-RAVA Dosa & I went for the Cheese-Podi Dosa. 
The RAVA dosa was very nicely made, especially i would like to mention here that the RAVA (semolina) used by these people was fairly better than what I have tasted elsewhere. They serve the 'Masala or Aloo masala' on the side & not with the Dosa wrapped around it. We found it very convenient because, then the Dosa's crispness is maintained even when you're half-way through it. Another thing worth mentioning here is the generous amount of Cheese (they said they use AMUL Cheese) & Onions (finely chopped, I must say) that were added to the Dosa. 

My Cheese-Podi (Mulga-Pudi or Gun-powder) Dosa, laced with generous amounts Cheese & more-than-generous amounts of Mulga-Pudi. The gun-powder is a 'Condiment' that is generally served with most South-Indian dishes. Although not all south-Indian joints in Kolkata offer this condiment, this is something that one prefers for the sake of taste, especially since its supposed to be had, MIXED with 'GHEE'. 

The sizes of both the Dosas were more than average, and, additionally more than sufficient for quelling our appetites. 
We had ordered Fresh-lime-soda (sweetened) which was just above average. They served it, how shall I put it, not-at-all-cold! And when we asked for ice, they said, they were out of it!  

Couple of other things that must be mentioned, a lot of traditional items featured on the menu like "Idiyappam", "Appam with bhaji" etc. were not available during lunch hours, although this was not mentioned on the menu. The waiters said all those items would be made available only during dinner time after 7.00 p.m. ?!? 

Another BIG Eye-Sore was that all the free waiters (who were not waiting/tending to any tables) just stood right in the middle of the restaurant, chatting away to glory. Surprisingly, it didn't matter to them what their level of volume should while talking to each other. I could easily listen to some of their conversation and they were discussing the appearance of some of the Ladies presently seated in the restaurant at that time. I did complain to the guy--in-charge present there, on my way out but I did not wait to see if any action was taken after my complaint. 

All-in-all an OK restaurant, service-wise but great food. Will visit here more definitely but keep in mind not to order anything that requires Ice!

One of the best authentic South-Indian joints that I have come across in the last few weeks. Delectable food at reasonable prices. The variety  of dosas available is in itself amazing . Before visiting this place I had only known about three or four kinds of dosas. 

 However, the menu card bedazzles you  with the various combination of dosas , idlis , vadas available. The place itself is very traditional. Food is served on a banana leaf which makes it all the more interesting to eat.

 I would highly recommend the dhania , masala , cheese masala onion dosas. The dosas are served with two types of sambar and chutney.

Hygiene-wise I would say it's as good as it can get. The washroom is actually usable. Although a little expensive than the other south indian joints, its good value for money nonetheless.

Whenever I think of going to the Banana Leaf the first thing that pops up in my mind is the queue I'll have to stand in, and I think of it not with pain but joy. I love going to the place because of its hustle bustle and lots of people, and why shouldn't it be? The aroma that fills up the sitting hall is so inviting, it hits you even when you are outside the door. It amazes me how a 100% vegetarian food can give out such mouthwatering smell.
On my first visit I found it rather exciting how literally they have taken their name, by serving every dish on a banana leaf. As obvious as it is, I find the dishes very tasty and flavorsome and they are very filling too, without being heavy on the stomach. This is one quality I find extremely rare in restaurant food. My personal favorite is the Parota Korma, which reminds me of the South Indian 'paratha' I used to relish when in Abu Dhabi. You can not find it anywhere else in Kolkata, I have searched. The dish consists of two south indian parathas, a bowl of coconut and yoghurt chutney and two bowls of an exotic vegetable stew. One might think, is two paratha enough, trust me, it is. And besides, you will be continuously served with as much chutney and stew as you wish, for free. My husband's a fan of the Plain Dosa because he feels any other form makes the Dosa soggy before put in the mouth. The Masala Dosa is a family favorite too. With all dosas and most dishes the stews and chutney are served as much as you wish for, for free.
Very easy on the pocket, with a great dine-out experience, I definitely always go back to Banana Leaf whenever my heart succumbs the coconuts.

When I entered Banana Leaf, I thought I was back in Bangalore. The smell was just the same as the smell in my favourite south Indian restaurant, a small place always crowded though it was far from any main road. I used to eat there every day. All those memories came back with the rich smell of Sambhar. Would the food be as good as the smell promised?

Yes, indeed. This is probably the best South Indian restaurant in town. There, one forgets he lives in Kolkata.

The best: Vada Sambhar, no doubt. Crispy but spongy, suddenly spicy. The sambhar has the subtle flavour it should have. Dosas are also good, crispy but not oily. Definitely the place to go if you can't travel to south India.

Delicious south-Indian food at very affordable prices..
The restaurant is simply done but is hygienic.
The Rava Dosas are great, if you try them, I'd suggest you for the one without cheese. Dosas and cheese somehow don't go together.The South Indian Thali is filling and tasty. The curries and the Sweet Halwa is great, the ingredients are very fresh and all items are well cooked. This place serves one of the best chutneys I have tasted in Kolkata's south-Indian restaurants.The cold coffee with ice cream is highly recommended, to finish the meal off.

According to me this is one of the best South Indian restaurants of Kolkata. I love the Cheese Butter Masala Dosa here. Service is good and so is the ambiance.

The location of this restaurant is excellent , just opposite to the Lake Mall.The ambiance of this  place is so so.. but the food quality is very good. I went there with my family and ordered Onion Utappam, Paper Masala Dosa, Sambar Vada  and Lassi. The size of paper masala dosa was huge and tastes really nice.. The Onion Utaappam and Vada was also good. The Lassi we ordered was not up to the mark. The price was decent . You can definitely try banana leaf if you love south Indian dishes. :)

Ambiance is nice. Service is average..quality of food is just about Good. Over all satisfactory experience. Authentic taste of south is missing in some dishes. 
On value for money i would rate 4 out of 10. A visit once is more than enough.

Sumptuous, great food at a good price. value for money food. Apt and prompt service. Clean and hygienic ambiance. Authentic south Indian cuisine in Kolkata, very reasonably priced, neat and clean interiors. I have tried the rava dosas which are crispy and really tasty! My family also loves the crisp vadas and soft idlis here. Sumptuous meals at very economical prices, overall a very good experience.
