Talking about the food it was really yummy.....#HerbCrushedBhetki#ChickenCordenBlue  both were really tasty and the plating it was OMG...never saw such amazing plating. Everyone should visit this place and I am eagerly waiting that when shall go to this place once again.

The place is easy to locate. It is a straight walk for 2-3 minutes from Wise owl cafe towards triangular park. Opposite to the Mystic Yoga. You will easily identify the cafe based on its white washed walls and beautiful decorations, giving it a nice look. It is very spacious and has beautiful interiors. The service and courtesy of the staff is very nice. The collection of the tea menu is wide and you'll get many options to choose from. It is mainly, as the name suggests, a a tea palace with wide range of teas to satisfy your taste buds. The food options are less but have very nice quality and taste. The Cordon Blue is a great choice for two people and tastes really well. If you visit here try one of their special teas and enjoy the ambiance.

The tea place has an amazing British aura to it starting right from the decor and music  to the food. Service is amazing and the staffs are really friendly and willing to help you out. Going by it's name you must try one of their tea's , they have the best kind of flavour and you will be really delighted by the cup of tea. They also provide complementary cookies to go with your tea. They have a wide range of tea to select from. Coming to the food we had ordered a chicken cordon bleu. It tasted really good and had the right proportion of almost everything. The place is also pocket friendly.

The service was tardy and the staff were snooty. I will never visit this place again. Food was good but they took ages to serve us. We had to request for our tea three times before we were served, having been kept waiting for 15 minutes. We were four of us and had ordered the house special club sandwiches. Since we could not finish it, had requested the staff to parcel it for us. To which we were told that leftovers were not packed! What kind of eatery says that? We escalated the matter to the manager, who tried to apologise to us by offering us free ice cream! They were not sorry for the fact that they refused to parcel left over food. Do they wish to encourage people to throw away food? Just spoiled our mood on 31st December.

We chanced upon this luxuriously decorated tea place on a weekday evening. Done up in white, this restaurant has lovely interiors and is all about the tea. Their menu is tea based and the food offerings include Continental and Italian offerings. We ordered Chicken Finger sandwiches, Fish & Chips, Darjeeling tea, Iced Passion fruit tea and Iced Lemon tea. The passion fruit tea was not good, very synthetic and sugary in taste. The finger sandwiches were okay but not stand out. The Fish & Chips were good, crunchy and soft, with extra texture from the sesame coated covering. The Darjeeling Tea and the Iced Lemon Tea were okay but not stand out. The Darjeeling Tea came with a fancy sand timer to tell the brewing time. Overall, interesting decor but everything else was average at best. The good part was that the restaurant's owner came and asked us for specific feedback regarding the food and service and said that since they were relatively new, they would need a bit of time and help to perfect their service.

A perfect mix of disappointment and humiliation is exactly what I'd like to call this place . Needless I say that the decor of this place is heavenly, the management is equally shitty and disrespectful. While the food and tea was average , our mood was completely spoilt by the manager. 

This cafe has two two floors, most of seating space is on the first floor. There's a glass door which separates the floor into two but that's also a seating space with no mention of it being a silent zone or no photography zone. There are two very huge and tumblrish chairs which are not even surrounded by tables and I've seen a lot of friends taking pictures there. Out of courtesy we even asked one of the staff whether we can click pictures on that chair , he let us go. 

There was an old couple enjoying their tea who were apparently disturbed visually because we were clicking pictures very near them. The manager asked us to go out of there and stop clicking pictures very rudely. 

I had a very elaborate conversation telling the manager how it is very unprofessional on their part to behave like this. The manager defends himself by saying that the old couple might write a bas review because of our behaviour. I'm sorry but I didn't know clicking pictures can disturb someone where the entire cafe was bustling with the sounds of people chatting. 

After having tasteless tea and a very average sandwich , the only thing that kept us going was the beautiful ambience but thank you to the ill behaved manager that our evening was spoilt and we paid for nothing. If you want this cafe to excel , please hire professional management first.  By far this has been the worst treatment I've ever gotten at any cafe. Please look into this matter .

There are some places with GOOD FOOD and BAD MANAGEMENT - People go there for food. Some places on other hand have BAD FOOD yet GOOD MANAGEMENT - People go there to spend a good time over a coffee or tea. BUT THIS PLACE is a weird juxtaposition of both the negatives - BAD FOOD, WORSE MANAGEMENT, worst Manager on the desk.

No doubt the ambience is lucrative but the beauty fades of and the place feels like a "whore"sale market once you start receiving their "great customer service" (sic).

I fell for the positive reviews on Google and Zomato and then realised my fault as these were mostly reviewed highly positive only by their acquaintance.

P.S. AVOID THIS PLACE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SPOIL YOUR DAY.

If you are tea person this place is definitely for you (as the name speaks for itself).They have got varieties of tea preparations to serve.Other portion of the menu is limited.Also if you are a photographer or if picture addict person then also place is so apt.Because the ambiance, the decorations are beautiful.You really get a feel in this cozy cafe.It is away from hussle bussle of the city.If you want to engulf the peace within you , its a must visit.Anyway what I would suggest is to add more and more dishes.The staffs are absolutely polite and decent.Loved the place.

A batchmate of mine recommended it as the venue for our school friends‚Äô reunion, since he was a regular there. One of my friends had brought along her 2 year-old child, and we were relieved to find that both the waiters as well as the fellow-patrons were very accommodative :D The USP of this place is the paraphernalia with which tea is served, complete with an hourglass-style tea-timer to enable the guests to adjust the strength of the brew as per their individual choice. We also ordered grilled chicken sandwich, chicken Caesar salad, and French Fries for the kiddo.¬†
There is also an adjacent section with book-shelves which one can browse while sipping and munching.

Overall, this caf√© may be regarded as an upmarket version of Dolly‚Äôs‚Ä¶of course, far spacious and with greater variety in terms of beverage and savouries. The white and cream colour-scheme of the walls, the varnished wooden floors, the elegant furniture placed at decent intervals, the premium crockery (Noritake) ‚Äì everything exudes a deluxe aura. With coffee joints mushrooming all over the city, it‚Äôs high time tea-aficionados too had more places to flock to :)

What an amazing place for a tete-a-tete over a cup of tea and I love fancy tea. This is like the British tea experience. So white and so pretty. Loved the concept of the timer. Tea Lover's delight. The Tiramisu was out of this world so was the sandwich. Shall go back again to explore more.

Purna Das Road & Hindusthan Park has steadily become a Cafe-Restro patch at the heart of South Kolkata. This place is the newest addition to this smallish food hub. The imminent chill in the air and the hangover of a lazy afternoon dragged us to this Tea Pub which has been in news of late for all the right reasons... the decor in a combo of beige and pastelled mauve is a throwback to the days of the Raj and the Plantations... the crockery & cutlery aptly curated....

Recommended for -

Any type of tea.... we had opted for Royal Assam Black Tea and it kinda suited our taste, the weather and the ambience....

Grilled Spicy Chicken Ricotta Sandwich.... served with Salad and French Fries, is a must try... tastes even better if prepared on Multigrain Bread and with English Mustard, both on request....

For all tea lovers, must visit for a quaint cuppa....

Well it was very brave of me to choose this place being a complete hater of tea. And I am that The Tea Place didn't disappoint me at all!
It's at Purna Das Road(if you're coming from golpark then cross the Wise owl cafe and head straight towards Triangular park. This place is on the left side of the main road.)

I'm in awe with the decor and ambiance of this white beauty.
Each and every corner has been given special attention.
Ambiance:5/5
Well coming to the drink, we had ordered Darjeeling first flush. It was great and lively in character.
The set came with an interesting tea timer and we loved it.
Food that we ordered came a little late though. Pasta Alfredo was YUMMY with lots of mushrooms and chicken. Wish the quantity was more.
Sandwich could have been better. We expected fresh breads.
Apart from this, we had a lovely time here.
Staff was good and so was the environment!

Exquisite.
That‚Äôs the very word that came into my mind while entering this place. Sitting there sipping tea was like sitting inside Taj Mahal. That‚Äôs the magic of the beautiful white building housing this outlet.
My Mom and myself went inside and were greeted in a way that was not experienced by us even in some cafes in five star hotels.
After discussing with Abhishek, the manager, we decided upon Darjeeling first flush tea for Mom and jasmine green tea for myself. They arrived soon after in individual classy kettles and timers. Mom, who is a tea lover, seemed highly satisfied by the flavour of the tea, and I loved the light green tea with jasmine aroma. Only one fault, they forgot to serve sugar separately. On request, however, they were prompt to serve sugar pot.
Foodwise, I ordered non veg platter for us. The platter consisted of egg as you like, baked tomato, sausage, toast with butter and jam, mushrooms. I opted for scrambled eggs. The platter was enough for both of us, yet light and healthy.
Abhishek showed me an exquisite meeting room which I hope to use someday soon. We left fully satisfied and yearning to be back.

This cafe is located in southern avenue.. opposite to mystic yoga cafe.it is very easy to locate this place. It is a 2 storeyed building.. very spacious . Beautifully decorated with lots of lights . This cafe has a very fresh ambience .
They have varieties of tea. Along with the tea., They serve cookies which are tasty. I had gone there with a friend so we had ordered saffron black tea , and honey ginger black tea along with fish and chips. Everything tasted good. I loved the saffron tea.. the flavour..the aroma ..was damn good. Fish and chips was very well prepared and was served with tartar sauce . Honey ginger was good but nothing extra ordinary. Next time I would love to try their rose petal Earl grey tea which I think will be good.
Lastly I really liked the way their staffs were behaving.the were welcoming, they were asking us again and again if we would like anything else. Also they helped us by talking about their different tea & their flavours.
Really a very comfortable and classy place. Would love to visit again. :)

A stylish cafe with pristine white interiors and beautiful furnishings that give you a feel of aristocracy. From the moment you step in, you are bound to be mesmerized by the "whiteness" . The two floor restaurant is lavishly decorated and everything is spotlessly clean. Coming to its main attraction - the much celebrated tea, is worth the pricy range. We ordered marigold tea and rosemary tea, costing 200 Rs each. Both were very good. We also had a chicken alfredo which was too creamy and cheesy, bit bland in taste. The hospitality was good. The only bothersome thing was that the restaurant closes by 9 and their kitchen closes at 8.30 pm. So the staff were constantly reminding people to hurry up on their last orders. The timing needs to be increased to 10pm at least given its situated in a happening locality near Triangular Park. Overall a nice experience particularly because of its magnificent ambiance,and some great tea.

Parisan in purnadas ...That's what I am going to call this place henceforth..Though it's not quaint by a longshot, it's new and bound to be a crowd puller eventually. This is my 3rd visit and I am still pleased as a punch with the decor and the general storybook feel of the place. As the tea place it's bound to serve good tea and though I am not a connoisseur I love how tea is served here as a experience. You get to see it brew and can choose the strength of the brew . Today we asked for the iced lemon tea which was refreshingly fresh. The sandwiched here are beautiful , ask for any of the grilled sandwiched of the prawn and you won't be disappointed. Served with home style fries and ketchup it's a conversation starter. A plate is good enough for two with fresh lettuce and mayo in abundance. The bakery is still not fully functional so the choices of cakes and bakes are limited. No expense has been spared on the decor or the staff and the effect is there for all to see.
Above all this is a cafe you feel like dressing up for , to sit up straight and daintily drink your tea out of fine China cups.

Right after we had begun sipping our iced teas and hot teas, which came a good 50 minutes after we had ordered, we were rushed up by the waiter, and promptly handed over the bill, when the place wasn't even full. The six of us, on our yearly pujo meet a decade since we left school, all festive and elated, felt let down, given the impolite manner in which we were rushed out.

Of course, the jasmine iced tea and darjeling first flush teas were good, and the place is pretty. Since the little empty space we had left for nabami evening meeting allowed us to only have french fries as munchies, we couldn't order much food. But then, who remembers the food and taste, when special memories get so dunked in unpleasantness, leaving a bad aftertaste behind.

The Tea Place by Manjushree is a 2 storeyed cafe that has a classy, sophisticated ambiance, decent service and a menu that offers a wide range of tea along with few continental items.

Observations :

1. Most people would like to have some tid bits along with tea. The dessert options are limited here.

2. There should be few eggless dessert options as well. We did not find even 1 dessert that was eggless. The cookies, cakes & brownies - everything had egg.

3. The Chicken Caesar Salad was good. Cookies and cakes were average. Brownie was too sweet. Tea was good.

4. Price is reasonable.

They billed us incorrectly. Instead of Rs 150 for the Wonder Darjeeling Tea, they billed it for Rs.1200! However on pointing out, they promptly corrected it.

There is room for improvement. Would like to visit again for a better experience.

This is a tea boutique to describe it accurately. A place where you go to have hi-tea. The area is spacious, well-lit and extremely well-designed. There's a waiting lobby at the ground floor. However, we didn't need to wait and were directly taken up to the first floor. We chose a Darjeeling first flush tea and a dragon well green tea along with a plate of French fries. The tea came in two push-in kettles along with two cookies with a tea-timer.
Everything was very well-served, very good etiquettes I would say since its the customary way to serve biscuits with tea. We got fruit and nut cookies(don't know whether it changes each day or not) but unfortunately they were soft. However, tea was very fine and smooth.. I'm sure tea-lovers like me would understand what I mean. You pour your own tea in accordance with the tea-timer so that you get to choose your own preference of strength. French fries were decent in quality and quantity.
I was very sceptical about the prices while entering the place since the place is so luxe, but surprisingly prices, though not cheap, aren't as high as you would think them to be.

This is a classy joint with exquisite silverware and cutlery to match. You would probably want to reserve it for special occasions. The tea is good as it's being offered by the Manjushree house itself. However the servers lack knowledge about the menu which is a let down. Pricey for what they are offering. Perfect for celebrating with a special someone or cuddling on one of their overstuffed chairs with a book on your own.

The best Darjeeling tea I have had in South Kolkata, served in uber classic tableware. You step into classy, refined and tastefully done English interiors as you enter this cafe. We had the Garlic Prawn Spaghetti which was flavourful and cooked delicately with fresh herbs and ingredients. Followed it up with the chicken finger sandwiches which were served with French fries, fresh salad and ketchup. Overall a fabulous addition to the Kolkata cafe scene. Would be visiting again soon.

Out of all the cafe buzz, this place somehow seemed a bit classy to me. Th best part is, the place on first floor is extremely well decorated and spacious. Service is pretty good, though some initial glitches are there, which I feel will be taken cared off in due time. I love their iced tea and mushroom on toast (been there just twice with same orders). Overall, love it ...
