The place was good but the service was not at all good. There was a broken sofa, like one side of the sofa was not well, we asked to change that sofa but the service provider didn't. They don't even change the song, if they're asked to. Place was good but the service wasn't.

Visited this place yesterday night... Ambience is quite nice, but service & food is average... Music is dull as there is no option for DJ in weekdays!!!! Menu price is affordable but menu options are less... Overall a average experience...

We went there in a group.... AC wasn't working.. nothing improved even after complaining... starter was good but there is no main course... they arranged for a small cake on request as we were celebrating a birthday... this place needs a lot of advertisement and needs to attract crowd... or else it is difficult to improve.

Everything was 3 out of 5 except music. And we have requested to change that. And the way crew member handles that is ridiculous. Never gonna visit here no matter what. Basic manners to talk to your guest is missing.

The worst place I've been in my life. Dirty tables, music too loud and fooding we didnt prefer. We ordered a brain freezer hookah and it was the worst i ever had. After 5-6 intakes we felt the charcoal dust going inside and literally I choked myself. It seemed as if the DJ downloaded the songs and played directly. Even the worst place to hangout in Bangalore would be much better than this place. Dont even give a first thought of going here. I literally had headache after coming out of this place........

Not satisfied.  
1. Service is not good, is bad. They cant even manage merely 40 people. 
2. AC was not working properly. Even after complaining it was not much improve.
3. The DJ was ok.
4. Food is worse. Paturi was ok, but the chicken was worst. The chicken quality was smelly and taste like it has been frost-defrost multiple times.

As a whole, I will not recommend this to any one.

Cockroach on the table alert. Skip if you value hygiene . Pretty bad by all standards. This one's owned by the camelia group which also own and operate calcutta retro and the Chinese restaurant next to it. Even as a lounge it has a pretty tired d√©cor and typical neon lighting. The alcohol is cheap enough and the good is good but imagine our shock when tiny cockroaches were running around the table. I managed to kill 2 and then moved to the restaurant next door. The worst bit is the server's are pretty apologetic but nonchalent. They explained to me that pest control was going on and that is why the roaches were everywhere. It's best to keep your establishment closed till you can offer your guests the basic cleanliness .

Horrible place horrible experience. Worst ambiance with bulshit stuff. Ordered few cocktails and they were seriously bad. Food extremely over priced and doesn't taste good at all. One chilli chicken  coasts 450. Dj is pathetic. This was my first and last visit ever.

Very well maintained place, proper lounge with a good dance floor and music. Staff is polite and though they don't have a huge choice of food variants but the quality of food is good and it makes up for some really nice cocktails. Price is affordable and it's worth a visit !!

New hotspot in town - with comfortable sofas and a spacious dance floor it has the makings of the next happening place in town.
Located on the 5th floor of Axis Mall, it is easily accesible. The decor is based on pristine white and looks chic. Though the knee room available is a bit low and feels like flying economy.
There are interesting mocktails and cocktails on offer and there is no cover charge.
Special offers are presently available for ladies on friday nights.

Been here for the first time. The place is just newly opened. There was not much of guests dining while I went there but that's okay. I ordered for some beer and they also provided a complimentary beer in return of my first visit and facebook check-in. While that's good marketing policy. What I disliked was the complimentary snacks they provided, well potato chips, and they smelled of some stale oil. Pathetic it was, ordered basket chicken for some relief to taste buds. The place only serves snacks, and you have to move to a next restaurant of the same group if you are looking for meal post your drinks, that's a bit uncalled for too.
