Small outlet and a reasonable one in kestopur area. Usually take home delivery. Chicken roll,fried rice and mughlai tastes very good. But my favourite is chicken mughlai.one really gets the feel of chicken in every bite unlike many other restaurants. They usually dont use dalda which is appreciated. Good for evening snacks. Pocket friendly and quantity is good.

This is one of my favorite hub for lunch and even for some hiety in evening. Well maintained quality and delicious food is their sign for eaters to visit now and then. They even offer home delivery which is another best option. Had been ordering food from past few days.

Have been visiting the place since a year now. Love it. All the staffs are friendly. Good quality is very good. Tried almost half of the dishes that were in the menue. My fav. Will be "manchurian chicken" and many more. It is on budget and u can get a quick treat

Its been alwayz one of the most easy going food joint of Kestopur at dis reasonable price..they serve Mughal to chinese and Bengali..menu has everything u want bt ask before u make an order,whenever i hv intended to order something from the menu they hv said..dat the item is not availble so i end up ordering according to their availbility..Bt,the taste is very good..i hv once tried their chicken kasha,it was Good.
Panfried momos are tooo spicy to eat...bt as i said taste is good..so,we could'nt resist ourselves despite of spicyness..kabab fry can be much better..
Take away is the best option otherwise Seating Area is not good as its shown..decoration is good bt they dont take care of the area..tables r full of dirt...they dont even serve properly,hospitality is poor..they badly need some educated staff to look after dis things..
So,although it is Pocket friendly n good with taste.. 
ðŸ‘‰Location : Kestopur prafullakanan,from vip it takes 7-9mint walking distance bt easy to locate . 3.5/5
ðŸ‘‰Food : Quality n Quantity both is good . 4.5/5
ðŸ‘‰Ambience : Dont expect anything 1/5
ðŸ‘‰Staff : Not dat good,hospitality is very poor 1/5

Horrible experience! Ordered two veg thalis at 1:10 pm, which after multiple follow-ups, got delivered at 3 pm. About the taste and quantity of items, lesser said the better. One subzi in the thali was like two teaspoonful and dal was stale. On another occasion, they delivered 5 rotis while I ordered and paid for 6 rotis. Won't order again!

Small food joint within the locality of keshtopur. Saviour for home delivery in late hours. Delivers food as less as two chicken rolls and the service is very good with polite stuffs. We often get double chicken rolls, tawa roti, chicken noodles, chilli fish, garlic chicken, chicken tandoori and tikka kebabs. The tandoori is as good as many of leading restaurants serving mughlai food. The kebabs are small, however worth the money. The food is nicely customisable and they provide right amount of the gravy that has been asked for. It is nice to have a decent eatery like this in the neighbourhood.

New little chef is a small food joint with multi cuisine options in their menu offerings.

**Location**

Located at Kestopur prafulla Kanan area near Utsav Marriage hall.

**Food**

Even if it is a small joint honestly I like their food.

I have had their kebabs ,rolls and Chinese items I must say they are good at it.

My preferred dishesÂ 

Kebabs
1. Hariyali Kebab
2. Chicken Sikh Kebab

Chinese:
Mixed fried rice
Chicken ManchurianÂ 
Chili fish & Chicken

These are one of my favorite one from here. My advise is to order usual and popular dishes. Quality is generous and quality is also decent.

**Service**
Preparation time is quick and the chef is really good here. Also the other support staffs are very attentive and well behaved. Liked it :)
