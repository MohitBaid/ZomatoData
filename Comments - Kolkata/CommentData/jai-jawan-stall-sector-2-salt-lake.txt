Best taste food you can get in the area...!!! They say the lines "perfect for the pocket." Chinese items are the best in taste. Rolls are among the most tried items..!!!

Some items are very good... specially biriyani.. even the quantity is quite good.. 1 full plate biriyani can be easily shared among 2.. and takes less time to deliver than other restaurents..

The stall is situated at karunamoyee on the same lane of benfish. There is not much seating space, food is not as good as you would expect. Have tasted their rolls, momo and paratha. Momo is not good at all, rolls are still better.

ontime home delivery, follow  up done with me and assured me the food will reach on time. taste is good little better than the street side food. i ordered indian, tikka butter masala, tandoori butter masala, tikka kebabs and garlic nun. packing was good and food delivered hot also. what disappointed me was nun was hard and i ordered butter nun, but by the time it has reached me, the butter was not there on the nun. i must say that kebabs where tasty and soft and i loved it. all in all i had a lovely time eating it up. also the quantity provided was good. i would request them to look into the indian bread section as it can be better. the food is better than a street side food corner, also what i liked most was this shop is run by x army men .... so i felt patriotic while ordering... thanks Jai Jawan Stall.

I was sceptical about trying this place after seeing the reviews,but I gave it a try.Ordered for a Mutton biryani and chilli fiah(dry) via home delivery and I would say I am impressed.The food was fresh and tasty.The biryani had 2 nice and soft pieces of mutton,egg and a big potato,the rice was perfectly flavoured and not too oily.The chilly fish amazed me more,the fish was absolutely fresh with no fishy smell and above all there was pure chunks of fish and no excess batter.Considering the price,the food I would say I very good at my first try.Yes,this place is unhygienic,so I would definitely suggest order for a home delivery if you don't want to see where your food is being made but the quality in my first try truly amazed me.

A roadside open food stall with open kitchen on the same side tables & chairs are there to sit & eat.
We ordered a full plate chicken biriyani and fountain cold drink (thumbs up) and it was only 150/- .
I didn't like the food at all because of no flavor and on the top of that they were cooking some dishes with kasuri meethi as its an open kitchen all the flavors were mixed up along with the smoke. So,after having biriyani i was feeling pukish . cold drink was filled with water no taste at all. 
Absolutely unhygienic. NO further visit. _/\_

All that's left of this place is nostalgia. I used to come here a lot with friends during our school days. And the biriyani was pretty good back then. As of now, there's nothing left. Taste has degraded. Plus unless my followers want to get diarrhoea, i'd suggest them to avoid this place.

Please don't judge this restaurant by it's look. The quality of food is really really great. I have tried Biriyani, Chicken Roll, Kebabs, Chinese items as well in last 4-5years. I am never disappointed. I often come to here from Kestopur for the biriyani which is awesome. Nowhere you will get 2 pieces of chicken/mutton at this price and taste is also awesome. Highly recommended for everybody who wants to have good quality food at damn cheap price.

Knew about this place located in Karunamoyee all along, recently came to know about the name. :P
A busy joint in a busy area. Nothing to talk about the ambience, a big put off is an open stinking drain right in front of this place. 
However, people seem to love their biriyani. Can't say the same, I'm very picky about biriyani and this one didn't make the cut for me. They also serve rolls, cutlets etc. Food is on the ok side. 
Service is quick. Pretty cheap.

This place basically saved my ass from starving a bunch of times. That might influence my review a bit! Still, the food here is quite good. Delicious chowmein, the paneer egg roll is good too. Their Biryani is really good. You take a look at the restaurant and you know what to expect from a place like it. It does not disappoint, it does not surprise. And sometimes, that's quite enough!

One of those places right at busy zone of Karunamoyee bus depot which has been there for ages now. It is that kind of a place where you can quickly grab a pocket friendly meal. They dont have any proper seating area but tables which are laid at the side of their stall and beside their kitchen. Their food is pretty average but i kinda like them if i am in a mood for a quick meal keeping my wallet healthy. Their Chowmein is very oily but i like it as it comes a bit fried. Chilli Chicken is just okayish. Rolls sells like hot cake here. Once i had biriyani here and i would decribe it as decent as it had too much of the Rose Water smell.

One of the oldest roadside eateries in Salt Lake. I don't remember since when, but it atleast has to be some good 18-20 years since I remember seeing this place at the heart of Karunamoyee. Often flocked by numerous people, they serve almost all type of cuisines. Try their Biryani here, or may be the Kebabs. If you are a Chinese guy, go for the Fried Rice or Noodles. The main concern, besides the quality of the food is the hygiene issue. I absolutely despise the open drain just next to the restaurant. Not recommended to anyone.

First thing i want to say,my  review is entirely  based on the food.This place is kind a "Dont judge a book by its cover" type place.If you come to this place i can guarantee 90% of you are going to dislike this place.But taste their food,specially their Biryani.I can tell you this biryani is much better than some legendary biryani places of kolkata.Mutton biryani with two pieces of mutton,one egg comes at only 130!!.Sounds incredible.Right??
Taste is pretty good.Service was fast.And the place is just near karunamayee and very easy to locate.
Come on,For once atleast dont be a snob and indulge your taste bud.

Not a restaurant,but a roadside eatery.
So please do not expect an ambience here.
Not even tap water and sink to wash your hands.Real match with our GDP per capita.
Spending 360 rs, we got 2 Romali rotis,1 plate reshmi kebab,1 plate chicken chaanp and 1 plate of mutton biriyani.Rumali is same anywhere in the earth,so striking it off.Reshmi Kebab pieces were pretty hard to chew,may be the meat was from a chicken who was a labour or farmer in his/her community,but my expectation was to get one who frequently visits chicken-shopping-malls.Coming to Chicken Chaanp,it was like gravy and scent were mixed seperately to create the aroma,it was clearly 4 seeds/Charmagaz pasted instead of almond/cashew paste,should not expect more.Saddest part was the Mutton Biriyani.Bahadur Shah Zafar, if he was alive,would have blown the big red handi into pieces by putting it infront of a cannon.The goat's death was not justified at all.I am in search of a roadside eatery which in taste could beat the big names,but unfortunately this venture of mine flopped.My search will continue though.

Located right at Karunamoyee, this stall offers decent fast food at very reasonable prices. The place is unhygienic and most wouldn't find it comforting due to open drains all around the outlet.

This is a roadside/pavement stall, serving a variety of chinese dishes and a few north Indian Cuisines. My favourite dish at this stall is the Biryani, be it a chick biryani or the mutton biryani. Its taste is good. Its definitely worth a try. Even if the biryani turns cold on taking away, the taste lasts quite long. The chicken chaap, though oily, has a different texture and taste on the good side. The chinese dishes like Chowmeins, Momos, Fries etc are good too. It feels that your money spent has got its worth both in terms of quality and quantity of each serving. Cold drinks served here are the 200 ml fountain glass and P.E.T. bottles of 600ml to 2.0 ltrs.
But due to heavy construction works around the space to dine in has shrunk. Also the remaining space is not clean as well, the adjoining drain has sewage water logging issues in the open air, giving rise to a horde of flies that will keep on visiting around you and hover over your plate.
My suggestion, if you wanna have food from this stall, buy the frankies (rolls) or pakoras or momos, so that you can finish off quickly, else take away the foods like Biryanis, Chowmein, fried rice, lachchha paratha, Mughlai paratha, etc. Bottomline, food sold here are good to eat in terms of taste.
