A chance encounter while walking down the Kasba stretch, the hip(pie) ghetto of a cafe is a nice new place. Divided in three sections, each with its own flair, this cafe can cater to the relaxed chilled out people out for a casual evening treat, or semi-formal corporate meets over some coffee and good food. In three visits within one week, I‚Äôve had:
1. Panco Crushed Fish - 4‚≠êÔ∏è 
[Its bhetki, not basa. Crispy and tender in the inside, with a mustard dip and french fries. The fries were a let down though]

2. Grilled Fish in Lemon Cream Sauce - 4.5‚≠êÔ∏è 
[With a choice of Bombay or Kolkata Bhetki (additional charges), this is a surprise delight for the fishetarians! I will not, on purpose, spill out spoilers, but let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs includes mash, veggies, and a bhetki ‚Äústeak‚Äù]

3. Grilled Chicken in Paprika Sauce - 5‚≠êÔ∏è
[Around 100/150gms of meat drenched in thick sauce and a dollop of mash]

4. Chicken Pesto Mayo Sandwich - 5‚≠êÔ∏è
[Simple and no nonsense ‚Äòwich, grilled with a delicious paste inside]

5. BBQ Wings - 4‚≠êÔ∏è
[They know the exact amount of bbq sauce the chicken wings needed]

I‚Äôd like to add another section for the decor; with a street front section, a closed air conditioned part and a semi-open air room, this cafe will not be claustrophobic even to an elephant...THIS PLACE IS IMMENSE! Yet, that have chose to leave more floor space naked and relaxed seating (which includes 2 beds and a cane swing), than making it a elbow to elbow crowded chaos of furnitures. Naturally lit with daylight and competitively well lit during evening adds to the ‚Äúfree space‚Äù feel the place has. A huge thumbs up to the management, the decor rocks...a straight up 6‚≠êÔ∏è

A solid 4.5‚≠êÔ∏è. The only thing lacking is the less varied menu (just one option in desserts), but I believe as this place grows up, will eventually earn the last 0.5‚≠êÔ∏è

P.S. Graffiti all over!!

Spent a cozy evening there. Being near to my house, though it was in my wish list for long time. Finally stepped in yesterday.. 
Lovely decor, great Ambience, beautiful hospitality, friendly hosts, again a beautiful and sophisticated decor. Would love to visit them again and again. 
The good thing is one can visit them alone also as they also have a range of books . 
We stepped in there after office so just had cappuccino,espresso and chicken sandwich. 
Simple yet good. Tasted good. Price is reasonable.
Perfect place for peace lovers, also instagrammable ;)

Cafe Strings is a newly opened caf√© which is located right opposite the Bosepukur Petrol pump. 
The first thing that strikes you about this cafe is the brilliant decor. The interior is quite spacious and the cafe is divided into three sections. The first section has outdoor seating, beside a beautiful wall which is hand painted. The second section has indoor seating and is air-conditioned. The final section is the most beautiful - it is a semi-open section with a tin top and the walls and floors are intentionally kept unfinished to add the raw look. There are various seating options here - cane chairs, a cane swing, and even a Japanese seiza style seating arrangement. Absolutely loved the decor! 

Now coming to the food we ordered: 
‚Ä¢ Ginger Lemon Honey Tea - The tea was served with an infuser on top of the cup. Loved the style, but the taste could be better as the honey was not mixed properly and it settled at the bottom. 

‚Ä¢ Panco Crumbed Fish - Bengali style fish fries served with chips and dip. 

‚Ä¢ Aglio Olio Pasta - Not too bad, not too good. Scope for improvement. 

‚Ä¢ Strings Grilled Chicken - Loved this dish! The chicken was very flavourful, and pretty much unlike anything I've tasted before. Was served with rice and garlic toast. 

Overall, it was a great experience and I'll surely revisit. Recommended üëç

Cozy and interesting place to hangout. Pesto Pasta was delicious and lipsmacking. Additionally services are also satisfying enough. If you are searching a place to hangout, you must visit this place.

The best place for a quick hangout with friends.
4.8/5 in ambiance. It was breathtaking. Decorations were worth watching.
Staffs were good and their behaviour towards customers were warm.
Smoking area available.
Panco Crushed Fish, BBQ Babycorn and Crunchy Chicken are the best starters served with excellent dips.  Mango mania and burbon bonanza were excellent in the category of thick shakes.
Overall its a nice place to hangout with your friends.

A hidden-in-plain-sight gem of a hangout near Bosepukur Shitala Mandir 

The first time I went to ' Cafe Strings', it was early evening, and I ordered for a ginger honey tea. Sitting in the covered outdoor section, I looked into two more zones inside and decided I would come and visit the cafe at least twice more. Just two minutes away from my home, visiting this cafe needed some kind of convincing of my self. Even though the section I was sitting in was cheery and colourful with murals and very comfy plastic chairs, it was unofficially the bite-sip-dash-off section. My tea arrived soon enough, with the hints of honey and ginger in the right places and the teaspoon turned the right way.¬† I was soon on my way.

The second time I dropped in, it was almost dinner time. A few weeks had passed.¬† I ordered for a Grilled Pesto Mayo Chicken Sandwich and a Cappuccino. I didn't have much problem picking them up from a pocket-friendly menu which was neither too large, nor too small, neither too uppity nor too boring. 

¬†I leaned back to watch the crowd. This time in the second section, which was air-conditioned and more restaurant-like with wooden furniture and monochrome fun murals. Around me a Tindr date was levelling up quite successfully, a mother in her eighties was chastising her son in his fifties for smoking too much, and a big family group was asking for their usuals with theire preferred customizations. They were soon joined by a visiting family friend who was implored to join them for dinner. I didn't mind at all when my food arrived a tad late, everybody around me was chatting vigorously and having a good time, yet my personal space was not encroached upon -¬† only warmed up around the edges. The food was delicious, perfectly priced and amply portioned. 

The third time, a month later almost, I sat at the innermost section, with a performance space, cane furnitures and poetry on the wall. I lunched on Spaghetti Alfredo with Mushrooms and Lemon Iced Tea. Only a languid young couple was in the table next to me, the rest was the noon silence all around. I was anticipating my table to be not high enough for simultaneously both leaning back and enjoying the pasta. I was proved wrong both about the furniture and my expectation about the quality of pasta. The sauce was the right level of creamy, the mushrooms had just enough bite and the tea had just enough sugar in it. It was the best meal there so far assisted by the factor that I was pretty hungry. 

So whether you are a Goldilocks¬† like me or a no-fuss-no-muss normal human from the neighbourhood who likes to be served breakfast, lunch, evening beverage and dinner, it would be a good idea to drop in solo, duo or en masse. The food will be good, the service will be pitch-perfect without being annoyingly servile or over-pleasant. They even have good musical and poetic events on Sunday evenings. 

Go ahead and try it out. Even Acropolis needs a break from you sometimes. Leave it to the hippity-hoppity X-Mas crowd.

Just went there today with my sister for lunch. Beautiful and spacious place with very lively interiors. Very conveniently located and reasonable pricing. Food was standard. We ordered bbq wings and spaghetti in red sauce.  Quality and quantity both were upto the mark. I am very satisfied. Service was fast too. There was a baithak setting and a swing which i loved the most.  I would highly recommend this place to everyone.  This area was in a dire need of a cool cafe n m so happy finally this cafe opened! :)
