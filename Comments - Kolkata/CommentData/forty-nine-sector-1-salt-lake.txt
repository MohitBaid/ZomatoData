We usually order non veg combo or chowmein here with chilli chicken and like the assorted taste. It's in the food court of City Center 1 and always crowded in the evening and weekend hours.

Forty nine is located inside the food court of Hangout. The staff at the front desk is very much friendly. But at times he pressurizes you to order more food üòê. Compared to the other outlets at the hangout, this one takes more time to cook...but its worth the wait. The food is lovely. The prices are quite reasonable. I am a frequent visitor here. Last time, I had the Chicken Combo Special which comes with a choice of Chicken noodles or fried rice, garlic or chilli chicken, wafers, crispy chicken and a chicken soup. Every item is delicious. I had the garlic chicken and that was nicely made. The quantity of chowmein is enough to feed two people. Overall its a very good outlet; just don't get tricked into ordering more by him üòú

I have tried lamb satay. 
It was where i first tasted lamb. 
It's delicious. 
It's inside city Centre salt lake food court. 
Try once if you haven't tried it at all. 
Staffs are welcoming and well behaved.

Probably they think we aren't human beings.. they put all raw veggies in a sandwich which is named as "chicken......". But hands up we arent cows folks.. Get up from your dreams. Disgusting food quality ever.

A kiosk in the hangout food court with a quirky name is all about Forty Nine. Though the menu is dominated by Chinese, I preferred to try out the chicken sizzler. Quantity was good and pricing was done in a similar way as the other counters in the food court. However, it was the taste that disappointed me. The chicken wasnt cooked properly and thus it was stiff. The taste wasn't also much satisfactory. Would obviously avoid this as there are better options nearby!

A kiosk located in Hangout Food Court of City Centre 1 . One place where you can get sizzlers with other dishes . We opted for Roasted Chicken Sizzler - it consists of 6 pieces of chicken, one egg , french fries , noodles & associated salads of Sizzler. The overall experience was not bad though the french fries were a bit cold . Chicken pieces were cooked nicely, noodles somehow lacked a bit of spice . At Hangout you bring your food from kiosks to your table & it was a nice experience to carry the Sizzler plate with my hand .

The Starters Platter is quite tasty. Even the Crispy Chilli Baby Corn. Though all of the dishes are quite oily. Make sure to get a soft drink to wash down all the oily stuff.

One of the least preferred joints of mine in the Hangout section. Located with some of the big hot-shot names this outlet has somehow managed to stick to its feet even after serving disappointing food. I have visited here only twice, so would keep the review short!

Their main offerings deal in Chinese. So, you can expect here the usual Chinese fares and some Sizzlers. None of them really packs a punch! The sizzlers are basic in nature and so are their Chinese food. The rice or noodles lack taste and equally horrible are their Chinese Side Dishes.

The quantity is just sufficient to cater to one hungry person, that is if you are ready to eat tasteless food. Personally, I feel it useless to stand in the queue and purchase a Hangout card to waste some money behind this joint!

Pathetic service and pathetic food are the USP of this outlet. I had to return a chicken grilled sandwich 2 times before the so called new employee got it right.
The only thing I would rate positive about this restaurant is sizzlers which is just about average.

After a lot of scanning eventually we end up eating from this place. What we like the most is the crispy chicken which is not only great but also quite reasonably priced. Sizzlers are good but nothing exceptional,choice of sizzlers matters a lot as not all are good enough.

I have there five spice sizzler... quantity wise it was very good... presentation wise its good to... taste wise is pretty average... the sizzler consist of half rice, half noodles, five small pieces of chicken with gravy and s small poached egg... rice was smelly and dosent taste well, noodles tasted good, poached egg was over burnt only the chicken gravy tasted well... service was ok... staffs are good and friendly... nothing to say about deco as it's just a kiosk at hangout food court of city center 1... since I am a sizzler lover... I will never try there sizzlers any more... pocket pinch was low...

Located in Hangout Food court at City Center salt lake this place serves good oriental food. I always order their Lamb in red curry when ever it is available and would recommend it to others as well. The Noodles here is not to my liking and hence I prefer the rice. Their combos are great and I love this place.

It is located on the top floor of City Centre 1, Salt Lake and is a part of Hangouts Food Court. The food quality is just okay. We had ordered for a mixed sizzler which consisted of fish, lamb, prawn, chicken and was served with noodles and egg. The service was okay. Taste is not really good. Does not comply with my taste buds though my cousins liked it.

i don't have  a good experience  here..visited with some of my friends some days before and they felt the same.
food was taste less.they did not serve desert although it was in chicken combo and we came to know they don't serve desert even not soft drinks. In place of that we got 2 pieces of extra chicken but as usual those were disgusting.Fried chicken can never be so awful! 
Although the service was good! there are many better restaurants  costing same in and serves good food the city.
