An amazing pub in town! The No - Refusal Menu is the eye catcher here. Also the decor is very cool. The inside is full of lights and loud music. The staffs were very cordial. They also provided complementary Pepsi or Sprite with the drinks.
Location is inside City Centre 2.
Overall a  must visit for great drinks at a very affordable price.

A wonderful place to hangout with friends. The happy hours menu is great, although the prices are affordable even without happy hours. The cocktails was really good and the food also but the dance floor is not really a dance floor. 
It has a nice ambience and the staffs are very disciplined and friendly. 
Overall it is a perfect place at a location like rajarhat and a must visit also.

Visited recently with a friend but my experience was not so good. After checking the zomato review, I had good expectations but unfortunately it was a let down. We went their during the lunch time and we were offered a king size table which we had not asked for. Inspite of having some empty tables we were surprised that they offered as a big 4 seater table. But after sometime, they asked another couple to share the table with us which we feel is not right. As far as food is concerned, the menu options are limited. We had ordered schezwan fried chicken and the tandoor platter. The food was good but not great. But the whole environment got spoiled due to chaos and the staffs were literally not friendly.  Most importantly we had to share the table.

Finally a place to hang out with your friends whenever you feel like, according to the mood. The place is energetic. The place's interior is designed like the regular Indie local street, suits the average Indian teen. Also, the place is pocket-friendly for the teens, which is a huge plus point. Don't keep high expectations from the food, 'cause come on, you won't visit a pub to fill your appetite? Finally, an Indian version of the McLaren's Bar from HIMYM, with an added party-vibes and random people's wacky dance moves.

I heard about this place somany times from my friends. Last week i came to this place finally. embiance was good, wel decorated with lights. There no reffusal menu was good. But they serve only light beer. I suggest if u want to try cocktail this is the best place for try with chepest price. they also serve hookahs. i orderd crispy chiken & there chefs special sizzling sizlar. crispy chiken was taste good but sizzling sizlars taste was not so good. Service staffs are good no doubt. In the bill they charged service charge 10% & CGST 2.5%, SGST 2.5% i dont know why they charged service charge 10% & GST on alcohols.

Nice place, with a decent ambience. The booze is competitively priced especially at happy hours. The food was decent, nothing to brag about. We had barbeque chicken wings and ultimate nachos, both were ok ish.....the decor was quirky so top marks for that. Overall a decent pub to hang out in the city.

Well, I'll give this place full marks for their decor. Totally brings in the #stuckintraffic feels. Sadly, that's about it. Sure, this place is cheap. But then, they REALLY compromise on their quality of drinks. We ordered LIITs, Sangrias, Caprioska, Martinis and every imaginable cocktails apart from actual spirits and ALL the cocktails severely disappointed. They were just not made the right way. Too diluted. In fact, the LIIT I tasted here definitely makes it to my "5Worst LIITs List".

The food was pretty decent though and reasonable. Honestly, most of my rating is just courtesy of the food and the decor. Also the fact that it's pretty easy on the pocket. Go here if you're out of cash and looking to have some sober fun.

You could go and check out this place!! I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs not bad. 
The interior of this place is really cool, gives you a local vibe totally street like. 
The service is good.
Coming to the food uhh the poutine chicken fries were just okayish nothing to grab the attention and make someone reorder it & honestly speaking the chilli chicken was horrible. üò£üòñ it wasn‚Äôt good at all and the quantity was very very little (really less).
They didn‚Äôt have a few drinks on the menu (why have it on the menu then).
Kindly make sure you cater to the needs of your customers because I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt want to loose out!!

This is one of the Oh-so-trending place in town which is kinda must visit for all! But to be honest, i went there with my fiance.Its not a place where couples can actually go and get sloshed! It has the VERY BAD CONCEPT OF SHARING where all of a sudden some unknown people are stuffed to sit beside you! Drinking in such awkward environment is not really nice! I admit drinks are cheap anyways;But they take a service tax of 10% ! Its good for groups as they can take an entire table! I would suggest to make a seperate seating for couples or just removing this sharing basis! And the quantity of food is so less! Very less!

This Gastropub is located right inside City Centre 2 Mall and is beside the Food Court on the Second Floor.

I went to this place to celebrate New Year weekend with my friends. Since it was New Year weekend, we were asked to pay cover charges. For seven of us, we were asked to pay Rs.5000 as cover charges which were totally redeemable inside the pub.

Initially we were asked to stand at the bar for 15 mins and then we will be provided with our table. We stood at the bar and ordered our drinks and nibbles.

Soon we were provided with the table. Coming towards ambiance, this place is quite small. The dance floor is really small. The theme is appropriately set and tables are well mapped across the pub. Bar counter is quite big for around 10-12 people to stand.

Coming towards food, the Pizza (5/5) here was just amazing. It tasted great.

Crispy Fried Chicken (4/5) also tasted well. This was the feedback from my friends who eat non veg.

The Nachos (1/5) which we ordered tasted very homely and it felt as if they were prepared at homw. Though they were provided with different dips, yet the taste was not good at all. I suggest you should not order it.

Popeye Cheese Spinach Roll (5/5) tasted super awesome and is a must have here.

Hookah and Drinks were well prepared and served quite fast. 

Coming towards the staff, they are decent and polite. 

Overall Feedback: A good place to chill with friends and quite decently priced too.

Date of Visit: 30.12.2017

The place is inside cc2... So there won't be any difficulty in finding the pub... If you are going during the happy hours making sure you reach there within the first hour else the place gets crowded... We had to wait around 20mins to get a seat... 
Talking about the interiors, the typical picture of an Indian market comes to you mind where you sit in a sewing machine used by tailors... The wall arts were nice and they have a smoking room available... The music was loud and mainly EDM based and I couldn't find logic behind playing VH1 on the screen if separate EDM music is whats being played... Anyways, coming to the food or rather the drinks only, we ordered most of their cocktails and the listing goes as:-
Cosmopolitan:- It is a must try if you are there... It was sweet, smooth and with a tinge of alcohol to give you that hit...
Screwdriver:- Good and light...
LIIT :- This was not up to the mark as LIIT's made in other pubs are much better...
Caprioska:- This was prepared with lemon and mint leaves, nice and refreshing...
Sangria:- Now this Is again something you must try... Prepared with red wine and fruits, it will surely take your heart away... 
What we didn't like was their beer... It was put up in the menu that they would serve house beer and what we were served was a bottle kingfisher(350ml)... 
Apart from this we ordered shots of Antiquity blue and Old monk... 
The pocket pinch is good during the happy hours only, otherwise it's a bit overpriced...
The service was nice, the waiters being friendly and explaining each item on the menu...
If you are in cc2 then don't forget to pay a visit to this place...

This is one of the best places to eat and sip with friends. This place is much more interesting for the gen-y than any other age groups. Its full of energy and quirkyness. Another add on fun is the traffic theme. Also it is very pocket friendly, though the food and drinks are all very good in taste and quality. In love with this pub.

We went during the happy hours(12pm to 5pm)
Ordered bp, rum, lick my peach,  kamikaze, bloody mary, cosmopolitan, mojito. Bloody mary was the worst of all. Other were quite good. We also tried the traffic ultimate nachos which were tasty indeed with enough amount of shredded chicken, cheese, tomato salsa and mayonnaise. We also had caesar salad which was complete trash(full waste of money). Had nothing but lettuce with hardly 4 to 5 pieces of shredded chicken.

Located inside City center 2 this is the newest place to party hard. It has got some great vibes . The new year party, the atmosphere, the loud music and the crowd all were amazing. Apart from the party atmosphere, they were serving the alcohol and have  'happy hours' till 5 o clock. They have some amazing collection of alcohol and if you come during the happy hour time, then it's your benefit coz they are serving the vodka shots, cocktails, gin, Brandy ,house beer at a minimal rate. 

I tried out two vodka shots, one cosmopolitan,one screwdriver, and one rum shot.
The cosmopolitan cocktail was more like fruit juice while the shots and the screwdriver were bang on. 
Not only wine ,they have some amazing food as well. I ordered the crisp fried chicken. It was hot, yummy and delicious and made me lick my fingers. 

My New Year went well boozing... and this place is  totally worth visiting. 


Happy eating. üòäüòä And Happy New year to allüòäüòäüòä

Since traffic has opened, the mind set of people has changed a lot. It's been a while that this place has been opened and has already captured the crowd pretty well. The ambience and service both is way too good. The ambience justified the name. The service provided is truly good. Starting from the PRs to the other people working. Their behaviour towards the customers is heart warming. Well mannered staff. The rates are also reasonable. Soothing music suffices it to the utmost and also makes it way interesting for people. I'm way too impressed and have already visited this place quite a number times and would like to visit this place again and again. The food, the hookah and the drinks are just the way you want them. No matter how much I visit this place, it seems to be less. The room of improvement will be in the space, this place is really good all is required is more space.

Located inside CC2 mall in Rajarhat...this themed gastropub is a cool place to hangout with your alcoholic buddies...The No  Refusal Menu during the happy hours is just the thing you need :) 

Lively ambiance with colourful graffiti on the walls,good music and actual traffic lights kinda post near the bar counter...it sets your mood to groovy mode!!!

We had a lot of items from the No Refusal Menu...The blue coloured kamikaze shots here are just amazing...Do try them out. We also had a hookah...i don't remember the flavour but it was quite good and dense.

‚ÄúNo refusal menu‚Äù is the reason I planned to give this place a try. Shockingly it was already half filled by 12:30 in the noon. We had couple of drinks and crispy chicken with fries. Both were very oily, which was a bit let down. Ambience and service is top notch, which is kind of expected if places like these.

Ive never had such a bad experience in my life. Ever.
People were dancing on the tiny dance floor leaving no space for us to move,to super loud horrible songs played by a terrible DJ.
We were three people who were forced to sit with three strangers on a random table. This is the most bizarre seating arrangement you'll ever find.

Now we ordered the most generic cocktails- Which had practically no alcohol and were pretty much like Tropicana Juice.

One single piece of advice. Dont go by the rating of Traffic...DONT EVER STEP INTO THIS PUB

We went to the place unplanned, and we had the time of our lives. The only downside to the otherwise awesome place is that it's a bit small and cramped and not more than 4-5 people can stand at the smoking zone. Now for the good stuff. We sat at the bar, and had some cocktails, which were fantastic, along with a hookah, and some nachos and grilled chicken, barbeque wings, etc. There isn't a single detail that I can remember which was out of place. Well done. Waiting for the next time to go.

An awesome experience with this pub located on the 2nd floor of CC2...... Happy Hours duration - 12-5 pm.. I haven't thought this place was so pocket friendly as far as the location is concerned but it was really reasonable priced.... It was also a pleasing experience with the food as well....  In short when u looking for a pub/place for chilling out with your frndz and at the same time a reasonable one u can definitely give a visit.....

First off, I am not a fan of pubs, but I like to explore them once in a while. So when fellow food bloggers recommended this place, I wanted to give it a try.

Here's what i felt:

It's a great place to hang out if you're - a college studen‚Äå‚Äå‚Äçt, pub lover, young and green. Perfect place to sip your beer and have a good time. Not a great place for conversation- the music won't let you hear your neighbor. 

Coming down to the drinks - I have had better. But the beer is free flowing, especially during the Happy Hour that ends at 5 pm. 

The food- the chicken strips were too stringy and dry. I did enjoy the dragonfish preparation... It's one of their signature dishes. It's light, spicy and just the right amount of 'fishy' :)

Overall, might not be for me and my kind-who like to sit back and catch up through their drinks. But, it's not a bad experience. I will definitely recommend to the party people!

With the festive season going on, one just needs that perfect place to get their party hats on! Well, if you're on such a lookout too, hit this gastropub and get trafficked for all the right reasons.
Bustling with energy, the ambiance is all charged up to get you in the party mood in no time. We were surprised to see a pub filled with crowd even in the afternoon! With exciting offers like the 'No refusal menu' and various events, they sure have a lot in store. Coming to the food, we tried few of the starters which complimented all the drinks nicely and a main dish from their chef's special menu.

Food >>

‚Ä¢ Traffic Ultimate Nachos (5/5) : This is a MUST try! Loaded with cheese, tomato salsa, shredded chicken on perfectly crisp Nachos, anyone would love to munch on this one.
‚Ä¢ Schezwan Fried Chicken (4/5) : Another delicious starter, goes really well with any beverage.
‚Ä¢ Dragon Fish (5/5) : Super soft fish coated in spices and fried to perfection. The spicy sauce just gives that extra punch to the dish.
‚Ä¢ Mashir Mangsho Chop (3.5/5) : Contrary to what we know as the original Mutton Chop, this one here is given a twist of cheese and mayo which I personally found passable, if not bad. All in all, this could've been better.
‚Ä¢ Chef's Special Chicken Sizzler (4.5/5) : With a big portion of chicken breast roasted perfectly, this one was served on a bed spaghetti tossed in white sauce and grilled veggies. Loved this one.

Beverages >>

We tried the classic cocktails like Cosmopolitan,
Screwdriver and some Tequila & Vodka shots in between as well. The cocktails were well made and the shots were properly served with lemon wedges. Besides that, we had few other mocktails :

‚Ä¢ Khus Chilli Cooler (5/5) [Must try!]
‚Ä¢ KitKat Shake (4/5)

We left ecstatic with the overall experience as the food made us too full and the drinks were really enjoyable with the peppy music in the backdrop. Definitely a good place to let your hair down once in a while.

If you want to have a gala time with your friends but not burn a hole in your pocket(provided you visit during happy hours), traffic is the place for you. The food is great. We ordered meat-o-logy, crispy fried chicken,schewan fried chicken and bbq chicken wings. Apart from schewan fried chicken the rest of the dishes were really good. If you go during happy hours, I should recommend you try the shots do not go for the cocktails. The hookah is also good. All in all, great music, awesome ambience, the service is good and food too. If you go once you will definitely want to visit again. Only drawback they still take 10% service charge.It remains very crowded,so you might have to wait to get a table so it's better if you reserve it before.

A perfect place to hop in if you are a fan of a fancy restaurant near rajarhat... Situated just inside the premises of City Centre 2 is a great place to go with friends & family to enjoy Greta food over not so high prices... The food if not amazing.. is great indeed... The staff & service were very good.. & the best part about the place still remains the 12-5 offer over drinks... The lowest prices for the place's most valued customers...
Simply one of the must visit place's to hop in to have some good food in City Centre 2.

we went on 25 Dec night. it was chaotic at the door with 3-4 people trying to manage the crowd. the place is basically a pub with a dance floor...or as it seemed. very much cramped up. music was too loud. coming to the drinks - they were fantastic. We had rastafariya, long island ice tea and margarita. we also had hookah, which was great. food - absolutely loved the starters... fresh chicken and cooked perfectly. i wonder how the chefs were handling so many orders and also maintaining the quality. hats off.

If you are on a party mood but budget is quite low, don't worry, you will enjoy a really good time here. I have been here for Christmas and it was very difficult to get an entry. The total party place, DJ, Std Drinks and Smoking room is available. You will get nice flavour of Hookah. Just really an amazing place to visit.

Went today to celebrate Christmas ... Awesome place ... Music was too good with appropriate bass ... Its perfect for dancing mood ... Tried 4 cocktails, beer and vodka in drinks ... All of them looks very innovative ... Ordered dragon fish, amritsari chicken kebab and stuffed chicken in red wine sauce ... All were very tasty ...The crowd was also very decent ... Staffs were generous too .. A must visit place definitely ... The only thing that needs to be looked after is you didn't inform that there are no bookings for today when I called to book table in the morning ... You told its booked however, after visiting they informed that we need to wait for tables to be vacant which is not fair ... We got table after waiting for more than 20 minutes ... You should give correct information at the first go while booking was done through call ...

The place is so good and unique setup that makes you feel more lively.
Soothing environment and staff are courteous and very active. The place is appropriate for hanging out with your friends. And the best part is the happy hours. You can get any drinks at extremely cheap price.
We ordered pizza Pollo-E-Funghi was equally good.

As soon as you enter this place it reminds you of rusty roads with very good ambience.. the place is a bit cozy, they should think about increasing the space. Happy hours is just a treat for us which serves house of beer any more drinks.

As soon as you enter Traffic Gastropub, the rusty, pacey and mad road vibes hit you at the right chords. From the actual traffic lights near the bar counter to colourful graffiti on the shutters/wall, even the chairs and the plates everything has got this tinted and goth feel to it to go with the mood. The place is however very small with narrow lane like architecture, so given a busy pre Christmas Friday night it felt even more crowded than it really was. We began with the BBQ chicken wings, Fried Calamari and Dragon fish. All the appetizers were decent in terms of both taste and quantity while the dragon fish definitely stands out. In the drinks they were out of Bira gold, Tuborg so my friends went for Carlsberg and a cosmo while I went for a glass of Sula Rose. The wine was certainly disappointing, the Cosmo was okay. The Margarita was best among the cocktails we had including the Coke-in with quite an interesting description but turned out to be simple Rum and coke. In the mains the Speghetti Carbonara with bacon was cheesy and tasty served with small garlic breads. The service was okay. They were quite fast with the orders only the dessert section took a while. And it was not worth the wait. The Tiramisu was majorly disappointing which felt like whipped cream on tough cookies..the nalen gurer brownie was also okaish as the brownie wasn't properly baked served with a scoop of nalen gur icecream. They had some lovely music post 8.30 courtesy the DJ, hitting all the major Bollywood and English hits of the year. All in all, Traffic Gastropub was a decent experience. It's not disappointing but as a number of promising Pubs have made their way in the city lately this would might not come in my top list.

Nice place to hangout especially during the happy hours.. the no refusal menu is really something u can't refuse but to get variety of other stuff u have to go for the main menu.. it gets highly crowded during the happy hours and thus space management gets tough... truly it was a much needed place for pub going people especially in the Rajarhat area.

This place is just awesome.. Ambience wise its too too good, foods are cost effective also. As per the menu card, they serve In House beer, though we haven't got it, as it was running out of stock. This place could have been better if they would have come up with more space. Anyway the less place gives you more cozy feeling.

With burgeoning consumer demands, hunger for exclusivity and desire for comfort food,gastropubs have become the places to head to when eating out. 
What makes the gastro pub concept even better is the notion of unpredictability in the dishes, carefully selected and cooked to perfection. While the names might sound familiar, believe it or not, the taste is exquisite.  And this is the reason why this pub is already on hype. With so much music and alcohol, we ordered:
1. Scheswan fried chicken- Supersoft fiery chicken.  A must try. 
2. Dragon fish- Spicy fish that will melt in your mouth. Highly recommended. 
3. Traffic ultimate nachos - crispy nachos with lot of chicken,  tomato salsa and cheese. Very delicious. 
4. Maashir maangsho chop- Bengali's all time favourite fried chicken balls with stuffed cheese, served with garlic mayo. Tastes Average.
5. Chicken sizzler - served with noodles.  Simple,  yet mouthwatering. 
6. Kitkat shake
7. Khus chilli sarbat
We also had mocktails like: 
1. Cosmopolitan - Average
2. Screwdriver 
As the crowd volume is often huge compared to the space provided, there are some inconvenience that one might face to get a table over there. But overall it was a boozing experience. Looking forward to visit again. ‚úå

The ambience, the music, the staff, the food. Everything was pinch perfect. 
We went on a Saturday night and were worried if it would have a space as we had been a little late but fortunately we found a place on the left side after enterig in one of those booths. 
I loved the ambience. From posters of movies, musicians to catchy quotes and graffiti, everything was glorifying the already tinch look. 
The staff were very curteous and helpful, we never had to wait or find for sonebody to cater to our needs. 
Also, all those of you who love Bira and have been looking for places to serve you the same, this is one of the couple of places in rajarhat who serve Bira.
The food was good and is above avg priced. I would strongly suggest their cocktails. 
Even the alcoholic mocktail was something out of ordinary. 
We mostly stuck to drinking with a couple of starters. 
The best part was the DJ and a dedicated dance floor which I have been dying to get on since leaving Bombay. The crowd was amazing, the ambience appealing and the staff attentive and ready. 
And it being a ladies night, my friends had free unlimited shots. What else do you need?
But, I wont go there again. Its a good one time experience, but the second time, the charm wears. But of course it depends on person to person.
Have fun :)

Very good place with nice ambiance at the 2nd floor of CC2. Service is very good and serves food very quick. Good food, good music and good service a perfect combo. Just one thing that space is not so large and limited tables. Sitting arrangement should be more in number. I got a table with unknown people opposite to me and it was embarrassing a little.

This place is lit af.. starting from the entry itself you get a feel dat you r entrance...the wall has different posters of 80's,90's Bollywood movie...even older than that... Then you enter into the reel life traffic like situation...the docor giving you a feel of #stuckintraffic..bright yellow and black strips all over the place...with traffic lights flashing here and there...they have a small space for DJ also... Comming to the sitting arrangement the place is small and in the afternoon like half past 2 it's all packed up... The table whichever you will be sitting is actually a sewing table...and even the tiniest detail about the place will give you dat you r in middle of the road sitting in your vehicle and your stuck in traffic! Food we had munchies platter and crazy noodles...and munchies platter was like worth every penny...the noodles was kinda of okish.. and the no refusal menu...(12:00 to 5:00) omg you get house beer @99 it's dat cheap even the cocktails are cheap starting from 59 to 150 or so... imagine the money you will paying is half the budget you expected!!! This place is a must must visit and I highly recommend it! Go get stuck in traffic atleast once for your good..

I appreciate the honour received by this place...

And yes dj waley babu was also bajaoing the gaana very good...he was the only reason for us to spend time...

I give this place the rating of 10+ because this place is more classy than hyatt, oberoi in terms of timings...

A mixture of good music and good food never goes craving. Many places do provide that and one very much up to the mark of a wonderful pub is this place. The drinks specially the cocktails are like really good. And my personal favourite was the chilli chicken pizza. And apart from that all was up to the very good mark. The good vibes of this place is sure to make you come back for more and more. And hats off to the service too. All was too good . Really a place worth visiting.

Traffic Gastropub newly open in CC2 beside hangout with a new concept of reality I love the ambience, may be it's small but arrangements were too good. Music decent and love it not so crowded overall good experience, sit opposite to bar. 
Let's talk about food.
We had munchies platter which contain four stater:
Vegetable Manchurian dumplings 4pcs small
Potato wedges 7-8pcs
Dry chilli chicken 5pcs small
BBQ Chicken wings 3pcs
Seriously speaking like the way they served to us. Served with tobassco mayo with this platter
But I don't like at all chicken wings too much smoky and and salt need to improve.
After we had 
Traffic signature platter:
Mashir Mangshor chop
Poddar er paneer chop
Veg Rumali roll
Shish kebab roll

Mashir Mangshor chop- taste good filled with cheese deep fried.
Poddar er paneer chop- taste not good at all it's like only cottage cheese mixed it up with tobassco pinch of crush pepper and salt nothing interesting..
Veg Rumali Roll- pita wrap bit thick and I didn't like the fillings full of cabbage on it, need to do sumthing interesting with the taste and fillings.
Shish kebab Roll- Good in taste yummy interesting....love it...!!!!
It's my personal advise to you guys doesn't show good if I am supposed to have the same dip again "tobassco mayo" with paneer, mangshor chop, Rumali roll, shish kebab roll. Need some spicy dip on it at least 2-3dip like:-
Thai inspired sweet chilli sauce 
Cilantro & mint chutney
Sour cream
Fusion spicy Fig or Alupakra dip
Avacado or pea Guacomole
These all make this platter complete!!!

And we ordered many more straight drinks & shots food etc....!!!!

Service guys were too polite to us & too much attentive....ended with fire shot I am love it...overall nice experience. Hope to visit again.

First I need to mention that its a pretty late review. I visited this place almost 2 months back.¬†I was very excited for this place and I am not disappointed to be honest. Finally RAJARHAT/NEWTOWN having its own party place to go to. Ambiance is no doubt very funky. Great interior and amazing concept. Loved every corner of this place. But now coming back to FOOD and SERVICE. I am a foodie and this area did disappoint me a bit. We went to celebrate a birthday there and ended up ordering Penne Arrabbiata and Margharita Pizza. The white sauce was PLAIN and wasnt cooked properly. Pizza was ok . We went in the afternoon and found the place quite *dark* and staffs less interested.¬†May be the place was new at that time or may be we should have ordered something else, whatever it was, I am going to visit this place again, hoping for a better experience.

Be high while stuck in traffic!!!!
A quirky decorated pub in the 2nd floor of CC2 (just opposite to INOX Box Office).
I was disappointed highly. Beer was not available (it's not accepted in any condition I think).¬†
Took a blueberry flavored hookah with cold-drinks base and according to them, they were supposed to change the charcoal once. But once we were done with the first round, one of bartender gave some logic less reasons in favor of not changing the charcoal.
Food is highly overpriced and quantity is minimal.
Smoking-room is too small. 3-4 people can smoke at a time.

People who want to enjoy the Happy-hour offering, get there beforehand because the place gets over crowded within 1 p.m.

Just visited a few days back with my girlfriend, honestly due to the board of No Refusal Menu hanging outside which shows a few famous alcohol brands at a very low cost but when we entered, I was too impressed by the interiors!! Just like a classic pub with so much colours..! Less space but very good and quick Service and yes good music as well! Staff are courteous and very polite. We ordered 2 Screwdriver cocktails and 1 pan rasna flavoured Shisha with ice base. Very smooth hookah with zero choking issues...loved it. Plus one MachoNachos which was served in a mini cart with plentiful of whipped cream and mayonese toppings which was like...WOW! Wonderful experience. Totally worth the money spent...Will visit soon.

So the Traffic Gastropub , located in city centre 2 , is a new venture that has arisen in the Newtown area of Kolkata. It‚Äôs pretty small for a bar , but nonetheless , ambience and music is good. The place is darkly lit. 
We had numerous drinks. The liit and cosmopolitan served to us was weak and tasted basically of the respective juice/coke base. The next one that we ordered and the one after that , turned out well. We also ordered chicken nachos. They were really good. There was sour cream , salsa , cheese sauce , draped over a pile of nachos , served on a plate with wheels. The nachos also tasted good. The marinated chicken added a new soft texture to the entire dish. 
The place is very crowded during happy hours and they have a really small smoking room. But ambience , price and service wise the place is worth a try.

Located in the City Center II top floor opposite to the inox ticket kiosk. They are running happy hours from 12-5 every day where they offer drinks at a range of 49-150.They have included most of the premium drinks in this happy hour offer so price is very reasonable if you are going within that time. 

Starters are costly though. Taste-wise they are great and they serve starters and cocktails in a very unique and attractive container. 

They gave the place a make-a-shift garage outlook but there is no dance floor. Good choice of music. Smoking zone is available but they don't sell üö¨inside. So bring it with you. 

Recommend.

Traffic Gastropub is a pretty cool place. The ambience and decor suits the name to the T. They have the happy hours from 12-5pm. The rates are really cheap durning this time. We had Gordon's, Carlsberg and Tuborg and to go with the drinks we ordered Chicken wings. The chicken wings were more sweet than spicy. The food is pretty average for the price charged. Overall, a nice place to hang out with friends.

We had few drinks and kashimiri kebabs. Food is definitely very delicious. They have very good happy hours offer with no refusal menu, where drinks start @49. We had also tried hookah.
Loud music, happy hours and delicious foods all together creat an eye catching ambience. So it's a must go destination for all food and drinks lover. I would love to visit this place again.

Located at 2nd floor of city center 2, beside the food court, this new pub attracts a lot of youth crowd with its quirky decors, loud music and happy hour "no refusal menu" where alcohol starts from rs. 49 only.
When we entered around 12:30 at noon the place was quitet vacent but by the time around 3:30 it was full, actually crowded.
Though the service was fast but staffs were not much friendly or well trend. More over they levied 10% service charge along with 5%gst. Its disgusting.
Now, at first we ordered from the no refusal menu; Classic mojito and liit. Both of them contained inappropriate amounts of alcohol. Although the mojito was quite okayish but liit, added with a lot of coke, a complete üëé.
Then we opt for the house signature cocktails, 1. Tumse na ho payega; quite a strong one and 2. Mellow mellow; sweeter one, girly type. Both of them were okay, served with their unique way. Atleast i liked my mellow mellow.
For munchies we had calamari; deep fried squid rings served with mayo and marinara and schezwan fried chicken. Both were just fine, nothing fancy.
At last we had oreogasm; mousse with oreo. For a oreo lover it's just pure feel of ‚ù§. Can't said about my friend but i loved it, goes very well with my drink.
With a lot of other options in menu, not a bad place actually.

Have you ever enjoyed being struck at traffic signal? May be with a glassful of  red wine or some mind blowing cocktail perfectly paired with some tasty tit bits it won‚Äôt be a problem at all.That‚Äôs what Traffic Gastropub is all about.
The interior puts up  a busy city traffic often standstill in the signal.The  floor is all marked up with black and yellow crossing marks,the traffic signs and a huge signal post hanging overhead.The sitting arrangement is on the pavements flanked by  brightly painted closed shutter of roadside shops.Touch of innovation is in the seating table & chairs even and we found it no less interesting than the overall deco.The open iron pipes and vintage Bollywood posters imparts some rusty retro look.
The happy hour was going on but the menu was offering only very basic spirits and cocktails.So we opted for the main menu.We ordered red wine and two cocktails.The ‚ÄúRastafarian ‚Äúcame with a hookah style arrangement with a glass  container and a long pipe like straw .Tastewise it was nothing so  special but the presentation was worthy of a few clicks.The second one was ‚ÄúMurbasa‚Äù.This deserves the 90% of my rating.Its nice blend of sweet and sour flavour with an unique pickle like taste lift up your mood in the first sip. 
For food we ordered light snacks such as dragon fish and fish rolls. Though the former one was perfectly spicy, less oily and quite up to the mark but we found the fish rolls a bit blunt.
Want to discover the cocktail menu a bit more in our next visits.

Though it was a sudden plan to visit this place, but worthy to visit. It's a nice pub in CC2 with colourful ambience and courteous staffs. The most interesting thing about this place is the price of the cocktails and booze like drought beer @99 or cosmopolitan @76. Though the quality of the drinks is comparatively inadequate but still I would pitch for it as the food quality balance to it. Surely would like to visit again with bunch of my friends here.

I went there with a few friends from office on a Friday night. To be amazement the place was quite empty for a Friday night.

The ambience is awesome with right kind of lighting and music. The place will give you a feel of a modernised dhaba. The props like a cycle, street side lamp post, the DJ station decked with all old music players just add to the ambiance of the place.

The staffs are really cool, starting from the lady who show you to your table to the serveurs.¬† The service is bit slow but will make it up with their delicious foods.

After eyeing this place for a long time, finally thought of visiting gastropub in the eve of my bday.

Well, this place became very famous for its decor and cheap booze.
Located in CC2, we thought of giving this place a shot.

We ordered
Two glasses of house beer
Tried their kamekaze shots and finally two pegs of old monk.

I must say that the alcohol is pretty cheap in here.

For food, we ordered the TRAFFIC ULTIMATE NACHOS.
Well, it was huge and tasted pretty good.
There was basically ample nachos loaded with chicken, cheese, mayo and sauce.
Loved it and it was going pretty well with the drinks.
Overall, really liked the place.
Pocket pinch for two was around 850 bucks and worth the money.
They also have a separate smoking zone which is well thought.
Overall, the ambience was thumps up, the songs were peppy, cheap booze and good quality food. They also serve hookah.  So basically you get it all here
Looking forward to this place.
Highly recommended

Why go to sector v or south kolkata for a night life? Traffic gastropub brings to you the fun of clubbing in city centre 2, rajarhat. Great place for casual hangouts with some delicious in house finger snacks and drinks. The service is superb as they were ready to pay attention to each and every customer. There is a small floor if one wishes to turn into their happy feet and throw arms in the air. Loud and boisterous music makes the pub happening for the youth. A small smoking cubicle is there which makes me give them another point up. Quality of food is good but it depends on the preparation and one's tastebud. The projector screens and disco lights add to the ambience. The place is vibrant and one should look out for if in a mood to be wild partying. But the place is quite small as compared to the frequency of mob it attracts. So, that's a thumbs down but at the end the pros are more than cons. A must visit!!
P.S - My personal experience was enhanced with the complimentary dessert they offered

Like any other metro city...
Kolkata is not an exception for sure when it comes to the bustling streets and the eventual caecophonic hustle of rush hours, of which getting stuck in traffic is an indispensable part of!!

But as we all know that the 'city of joy' never fails to amaze its people with surprises.... there is an option indeed where getting 'Stuck In Traffic' can actually be fun, and quintessential enough to crave for, be it after a hectic day or an eve to celebrate!! üòÉ

Being an all new dimension to the modern day cityscape of 'Kolkata', the place named 'Rajarhat', on the Eastern flank of the city, with its consistent development of gigantic shopping malls and blue chip condominiums all around is surely a place that infused an adrenaline rush to the fast pace of the citylife!!
And amidst that, is located the much renowed shopping mall 'City Center 2' which houses a wonderful street-themed pub.... üòÉ

Bingo!!
"Traffic Gastropub" is what we are talking about!! üòÉ

While the quirky interior and the jawdropping street themed signages immediately create an impulse to let you leave your worries and agony behind....
The tempting cocktails with quirky names and delectable dishes from the menu is sure to leave your tastebuds on sheer euphoria!! üòç

Amidst the wide range of quirky, yet amazing cocktails in their menu...
The ones that stand out of the crowd are :

1. Long Island Ice Tea
2. Coke-In
3. Daru ki Tanki
4. Rastafarian
5. Tumse Na Ho Payega
6. Traffic Photographic
7. Murbasa
8. Thai Spa
9. Mellow Mellow

And to accompany with the drinks, one shouldnt miss some 'Classic Caesar Salad', 'Traffic Ultimate Nachos', 'Paneer Jhunjhunwala', 'Parmesan Crusted Fish', 'Chinatown Manchurian Balls', 'Dragon Fish', 'Spaghetti Aglio-e-Olio', 'Pollo Penne Arrabbiata', 'Tandoori Chicken Pizza', 'Barbeque Chicken Wings', 'Chilli Chicken Pizza', 'Chicken Crazy Noodles', 'Cornography', 'Murgh Kashmiri Kebab', 'Chicken Poutine', 'Shish Kebab Roll'...
And if you are a pork lover, then some 'Pork Chops', alongwith!! üòÉ

However...
The two dishes without which your visit will remain incomplete are "NIMBOO MAHI KEBAB"(Fish Kebab infused with flavour of Lime)..

And the showstopper of the house "MASHIR MANGSHER CHOP"(Age old Bengali style Mutton Croquette, with a twist.
'Mashi' is a bengali word which literally means 'Aunty'...
In this case, the word refers to the ageold legacy of the local Croquette shops of Bengal and 'aunties' who run it) üòÉüòÉ

And while you are #stuckintraffic, eventually munching and sipping on the delectable delights..don't forget to conclude it on a mellifluous anecdote with some "OREOGASM" and "ORANGE MOUSSE" üòç

Note - A visit to this place between 12 P.M.- 5 P.M.(Monday to Friday) is even more exciting with its "NoRefusalMenu" where the standard pour(30 ml) of alcoholic drinks start from as low as 49INR. üòÉ

Happy Eating!! üòä

AMBIENCE- 4/5
FOOD(Quality)- 3/5
FOOD(Quantity)- 3/5
SERVICE- 4/5
VALUE FOR MONEY- Not very much
RECOMMENDED- Yes. (If you are looking for a place with extremely loud music).
The place is situated on the 2nd floor of City Centre 2. Went there on Saturday with a friend. We were told at the entrance that we would either have to share table or take the bar stool. We went for the shared table as quite honestly high chairs are a little uncomfortable for me. The place is well decorated with beautiful roadside theme. The lighting was dim and the party kind of vibes were in the air. But it smelled strongly of flavoured smoke as they do not have separate area for hookah which was a turn-off for me. The place was quite congested which could be because it was Saturday, ladies night (cocktails on the house for ladies). But I feel that the place is quite small. We were seated at the chairs just opposite the bar. Honestly it was quite awkward sitting face to face with a couple of unknown people. The table was too high for my comfort and the chair was extremely uncomfortable too. Coming to the food:-
‚ö´Ô∏èKit-kat shake- This was a surprise just because of the way it was served. It was presented in a huge tub and looked beautiful. But the taste was quite average as it had the smell of milk, was a bit too sweet and not even properly chilled. So, quality wise it was a let down.
‚ö´Ô∏èGrilled chicken in mushroom pepper sauce- This dish smelled amazing and was actually very delicious. The pieces of chicken were soft, well cooked and succulent. It was served with a side of creamy mashed potato and some veggies. But the quantity was really disappointing. It was not enough for even one person.
Apart from this, my friend ordered a Kingfisher beer.
As it was ladies night, I had two free cocktails which were given to all the ladies who chose to have it for free. They have an extra 10% service charge on top of 5% GST. Our bill was ‚Çπ758 all inclusive.
The staff are well behaved and attentive. There are DJ nights and also the music is always playing so people in the party mode will definitely enjoy. But if you have problem with hookah smell and loud music this place is not for you. But then again it is a pub, what else can be expected.
They can definitely try to improve on their food quantity. I would not say this place is pocket friendly but it's affordable. Some dishes are quite costly. You can definitely visit once to avail their happy hour offers. I am not coming back anytime soon.

      An excellent pub at Cc2. Very innovative and extraordinary. Happy hours from (12-5 pm) is very pocket friendly. TRAFFIC GASTROPUB has surely created a buzz in the City Of Joy. A must visit pub in the town. The only drawback is that they charge 10% service charge. Overall it's a good experience I'm definitely visiting soonü§ótill then KEEP IT UPüëç

An excellent pub at CC2 for chill out with friends.
The ambience, the decorum, service all are too good. I'm specially impressed by their decoration. Very innovative and extraordinary. Good seating arrangement by wooden benches in a not so big place is noticeable. The all time DJ babu plays really good and enjoyable tracks. Happy Hours (12p.m-5p.m) is very pocket friendly. They offered 330ml beer at 99. We had Caprioska, was excellent.
Hookah service is really good. And the lighting decoration belongs from a different level.

Very satisfactory. Loved to be there.

Newly opened pub in town. 
Located in City Centre 2 just opposite the inbox box office on the 3rd floor. 
First of all let me talk about the ambience of this place. The interior design of this place is exactly as the name of the pub. You can see traffic lights,shutters, lamp post and even poster on the walls. It has got a good vibe. 
Coming to the service, they were great. Full marks for the prompt service. We were very well greeted at the door. It was packed house but still they managed to get us seats and even explained us their special items. 
The food was okay. The salad was good but the kabab wasn‚Äôt up to the mark. 
Compared to the other pubs in Kolkata this is pretty pocket friendly. 
All in all a good, decent pub. Can give it a try.

Located inside city centre 2, you can't afford to miss a visit to this place. We ordered a Pollo-e-funghi pizza and a schezuan fried chicken. The pizza was thin crust and delicious. However the fried chicken was a bit of a disappointment. We were there during the happy hour and got unbelievably reasonably priced drinks! The ambience is also worth mentioning. The decor and the music will set the mood!

Traffic Gastropub is the hot new addition to the city‚Äôs pubs. The best part about it is the location. Close to the IT hub of Kolkata, this quirky place is located in City Centre 2, right beside the Inox box office.

Apart from the wide variety of food and drinks that they offer, the biggest USP of this place is the happy hours. They offer rum at INR 49 and beer at INR 99 during the happy hours which in on all through the weekdays. The cocktails are given a creative twist, especially the Good old Rum and Coke.

Fantastic drink menu - served with style. LIIT and Tumse na ho payega was amazing. I had BiRA, few veg starters and oreo-gasm (their speciality in sweet dish). I feel they should work more on their food menu. Will definitely go again to try out more drinks n food items. And they have superb staffs!

One in a million places to be known for its huge crowd. Amazing selection of drinks for the college crowds especially. But lets just not stop at that... The food is also very good especially ‚ÄúPoutine‚Äù the all new concept in the ‚ÄúTraffic Roomali Roll‚Äù and ofcourse the famous ‚ÄúNo Refusal Menu‚Äù which made me the most happy. This place is probably the only place to have the drinks on the house for the longest ‚ÄúHours‚Äù (so called ‚ÄúHappy Hours‚Äù üòÄüçª). We ordered for a couple of House beers which they serve by the glass @ 330 ml, few shots of Tequila and BOY.... did my friend order his long time favourite ‚ÄúBloody Mary‚Äù. The drinks were accompanied with first ‚ÄúPoutine‚Äù then ‚ÄúTraffic Roomali Roll‚Äù of which both were astonishingly awesome. The get up of the place is also of the speechless sort, more of a dim lit area, the only problem with all you smokers out there is that the smoking zone is just too small so get ready for a cuddle üòúüëç The staffs were extremely helpful and cordial to tell you what to try. Absolutely one of the most happening places in Raharhat CC2. Just 3 months off the block they really wooed the crowd over. A definite ‚Äútry‚Äù for the young crowd out there....

This is a new pub in town . Its inside the cc2 mall on the 2nd floor next to inox.The ambience is pretty good with the street theme . They have worked into details from foothpath to closed down shops to roads. They have drinks menu starting from Rs 49 . We tried the Classic mojito and margarita pizza. The food was good . They also have board games in the house .

Chill zones in the city have been redefined repeatedly in the past couple of years or so. And almost every time we are left amazed by the glitz or the very idea behind the establishment. I guess one such joint which I discovered recently is ‚ÄòTraffic Gastropub‚Äô that once again pushes the limit of our imagination. Who would have dreamt of a street themed buzzing gastropub in the heart of Newtown (Kolkata) which is otherwise devoid of any good pub or restaurant, at present. I mean if we literally go by the term traffic, then it‚Äôs something that we would really like to avoid when we are moving on a fast paced road towards our destination. But I guess here the term ‚ÄòTraffic‚Äô is all about indulgence, to get stuck in it to take a pause, take a breather in this fast paced life ‚Äì Traffic Gastropub is all about that unwinding experience.
                                                                ...

Almost every now and then you would get to see a new place coming up in the city which looks promising to some extend at the beginning but miserably fails to do so in the long run. I would put the main problem for those places which don‚Äôt survive as, they don‚Äôt do anything different and end up being a boring zone with a non creative ambiance. Now what makes one visit a place in any format be it a restaurant or a pub ? Many reasons can be the answer to this but the main reason i feel at times is the way a place delivers an overall experience for the value of time and money a person spends out. The newest kind of a happening thing increasing in the city is a Gastropub , which is a place for you to chill with your gang, listen to¬†electrifying music by the dj or live events,enjoy your drink with a wide menu options of high end food ,all together at your table to make it a place having everything that you need under one roof.
                                                                ...

Full points for Interior decoration, ambiance and hospitality (5 pts)
Hookah is good, nice variety but price is a tad high (4 pts)
Starters are awesome but didn't like the noodles that I tried that much. Hence, not exactly value for money but definitely taste is good. (3.5 pts)
Enjoy good live music on Wednesdays and Sunday (5 pts) but I would deduct 2 points for the awful DJ (Hence a net¬†3 points for entertainment).¬†
Also, I didn't like the sudden impromptu play of stand-up comedy one day. Not that I dont like stand up comedies. Just that I wasn't ready for it and the experience was not good on that day. (deducting .5 point for that)

I had been eyeing this place for few months now. Finally got a chance to visit this little pub located inside CC2. We went for lunch and considering the fact that it was daytime i felt the pub was lacking enough lights. It was literally dim which is fine esp in the evenings when people actually come to party get high and dance away to good music but lunch hours can be little more lit up.

I visited the place purely for a good lunch with my hubby and brother on my birthday . Firstly the staffs need to clean the seats once they are vacated to make sure people dont land up sitting on wet seats. It actually happened to us and it was a turn off. Anyways the staffs did clean up on being told but they should have done it way earlier without being told. 

Next for food we ordered the chicken ceaser salad which was amazing and beautifully done. We also tried the schezwan chicken or devil chicken i cannot remember but it was yum and hot &  left us wanting for more. Next we had the fish and chips which was ok and the fish quantity as a main course was very small and stingy. Final dish was grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies which was good and filling. However i was served with rice and on being told they did give me an extra plate with veggies and mashed potato but it lacked taste & butter and was not well tossed or saut√©ed . Also i can do better mashed potatoes at home. Hmph! 

The service was soo late that my hunger pangs died by the time my main was served and no wonder they forgot to serve me mashed potatoes which was part of the dish. Honestly Who would remember a dish after such delay. However it proved that they all lack knowledge of the menu. The starters got served after fish & chips which was a main course meal. The staffs are unaware of the menu & extremely slow. However one of them made us try chilly mojito drink which was amazing and very unique. I have never enjoyed a spicy drink with the correct amount of sweetness before. It is a must try. It was not on the menu. It was recommended orally.

The price justifies the location. The ambience is nice and the concept is novel. Its just a good place to hang out and enjoy a pub time.

City centre 2 has been a common place for me on weekends for movies and shopping. It needed a good pub since quite a long time now. And Traffic is able to keep up everyone's expectation.
We got #stuckintraffic yesterday. Firstly I loved the theme and how the name justified every nook and corner of the pub. The interior is captivating. The wall had posters all over from traffic signals to vehicles. It looked a bit congested though as we visited during the happy hours when the no refusal menu comes into play where the price of whiskey,rum,scotch starts from 49 (not kidding!). Hookah was finely prepared too.We had also ordered for Oregasm which wasn't available then (sigh). The staffs were very responsive and we were getting our orders served within seconds, which added to the cons. We could not explore the dance floor or DJ which intrigues me to visit again on weekends. And everyone should too. It's a highly recommended place if you want alcohol at cheapest prices, I swear you won't come disappointed.

Went there during happy hours and the place was full. We were directed to the bar stools and frankly the experience was amazing. Sitting at the counter, we were immediately attended to. We ordered Kamikaze shots and a Pollo e Funghi pizza. It was the best pizza I have ever had by a long shot. The staff were attentive and very courteous. The decor resembles a street doing justice to its name; and with its graffiti painted "shutters" the place gives an alleyway vibe. The only con would be that the place is  a little small and cramped. Overall an experience I would love to repeat.

They say few places on town are there best to hangout. I will keep this place at top of the list. Drinks apart ,prices are affordable. Snacks are good plus point of the pub is the music & the lights. Billing process is good. Awesome & fast service which makes this place really more fascinating. Been here with my college friends about 14 people but didn't felt like any problem to have fun.

This pub is in the rajarhat city centre mall second floor. We visited here first time and it was quite a nice experience. Let's talk about all aspects of this place one by one. First the crowd and ambience. It's very crowded in the festival time, so better book your table or come early to get a cosy place. Ambiance is perfect for a pub. We enjoyed the dj mix and live music streaming very much. It was good to see the live cricket match over there. Now the decor. Here the theme is traffic and it has been beautifully expressed in the interior decoration. The traffic signals, road lights, over bridge.. very innovative. The alcohol and the starters were ok. We loved the ambiance so much that didn't concentrate on food. Though the crispy chicken, hand made pizzas were awesome. Would like to visit this place again as the food price is also pocket friendly. Now the only drawback is the place is very short. It can be bigger for people who love to hangout. This is a humble request to the management to increase the no of tables in traffic. So that nobody needs to halt at traffic signal. :-):-)

The newest gastropub in Kolkata! In the lines of Hoppipola but the menu options are more, especially when it comes to food! The cocktails are picturesque, and a visual treat! They have a menu where prices start from 49.¬†
The ambiance is in sync with the theme - decor is worth mentioning. Was quite surprised with their food menu, from nachos to pizza, to chinese to kebabs - such variety! Each cuisine has been very well taken care of, speaks volumes about the chef!
Try and reach early because the place is ever crowded! :)

I was extremely fortunate to have been invited to this amazing bloggers meet at this new kid on the block called Traffic.

This gastropub is situated on the 2nd floor of City Centre 2, Rajarhat.
The ambience is very urban chic and the vibe is casual. The interiors are attractive and they also have live music. Flocked by mostly the youth, it can be pretty crowded even on the weekdays. They are also known to serve alcohol at the most inexpensive rate in the city during the happy hours which is from 12-5 pm. Yes, they drink rates start at INR 49/-
Can you beat that?

However, moving on to the food and drinks. The menu for the bloggers meet are as follows :

FOOD ::

1. Classic Chicken Caesar salad

2. Traffic Ultimate Nachos

3. Paneer Jhunjhunwala

4. Parmesan Crusted Fish

5. Chinatown Manchurian Balls

6. Dragon Fish

7. Spaghetti Aglio-e-Olio

8. Pollo Penne Arrabbiata

9. Tandoori Chicken Pizza

10. Barbeque Chicken Wings

11. Mashir Mangshor Chop

12. Chilli Chicken Pizza

13. Chicken Crazy Noodles

14. cornography

15. Murgh Kashmiri Kebab

16. Orange Mousse

17. Nimboo Mahi Kebab

18. Chicken Poutine

19. Shish Kebab Roll

20. Pork Chops

21. Traffic Roomali Roll

22. Murgh Khush Hua

23. Butter Naan

24. Oreogasm
 
The food is extremely delightful, spot on and has amazing flavours. It is a rare case that a pub would serve just as good food but Traffic Gastropub can really surprise you. My favourites of the lot were definitely the parmesan crusted fish, dragon fish, the nimbu mahi kebab, the pizza, the chicken poutine, chicken crazy noodles, chicken wings and the nachos. That being said, the rest of the items were equally amazing! 

I cannot even begin to tell how much I loved the dessert, 'Oreogasm' If there could be something that would end a perfect meal, this is it. It was the perfect sweet ending to a crazy gastronomic journey.

While these were enough to tie us down, the cocktails were on a different league. Extremely well made and ready to give you the solid kick, here's what we were offered.

COCKTAILS ::

1. Long Island Peach Iced Tea

2. Coke-In

3. Daru ki Tanki

4. Rastafarian

5. Tumse Na Ho Payega

6. Traffic Photographic

7. Murbasa

8. Thai Spa

9. Mellow Mellow

After stuffing ourselves till the throat, we were slightly tipsy and mostly full. The food and cocktails are pretty darn amazing and I guess that is a reason good enough for you to visit this place. If not anything else, the crazy good vibes should be enough. Also, they serve hookah.

Pocket Pinch - INR 1500/- plus taxes for two

It was just a week before diwali....when the buzz related to this place compelled me to visit traffic. Since then I've become a regular and have fallen in love with the place. Everything is just good, the food the drinks the people the service and most importantly the theme. With their live performances on most of the evenings and sick happy hours in the afternoon, they really have connected to a huge crowd. I have fallen in love with the place and will visit again n again, hungry for more, #stuckintraffic indeed.

P. S~ "tumse na ho payega" is one hell of a drink üòâüòâ

This is a second place like this I have visited after Hoppipola! 

The place is welcoming, cozy and has a lovely vide about it. Dim lights. Ear-tantalizing music, wooden stools did the seating arrangement for me and the quirky art decor(yellow bicycle!). 
 
Staff is well behaved, courteous, helpful and hard working! They were super responsive even amidst such rush hours.

Coming to drinks, I am not much an expert on this. Tasted a few cocktails. Sangria(Red), Cosmopolitan, Virgin Mojito!
And did the Tequila shot for the first time. :D

Also, had ordered plenty of food, yet to try out some of their iconic stuffs though, hence another visit pending. :)

The ones we tasted were Crispy Friend Chicken, Barbeque Chicken Wings(this was delicious), a must with drinks in our group, Dry Chilli Chicken, a creamy papad-pizza, Pollo Cremoso, Stuffed Chicken with red wine sauce and Amritasari kebab!  
And with a bunch of crazy friends you are sure to have a blast out here!
Will definitely visit more! :)

Another pub worth trying out. We went in and got our seats. The place is pretty big, considerably bigger than CC2's pizza Hut, so there's ample seating arrangements. There's a big bar inside that'll definitely catch your eye. The tv inside the bar usually runs sports so if you're looking for a sports bar, this is definitely the place. We went in during their "happy hours" where the traffic no refusal menu comes into play. And during this time of the day, the drinks are extremely cheap. You can check it out yourself. We ordered 2 VAT 69, 2 Signature Premium, a kamikaze shot, a screwdriver and sangria cocktail and finally a glass of beer. Sadly, they don't provide some form of edibles (snacks) with your drinks, so if you want something to eat, you have to take a starter. And so we did. We tried the Veg Manchurian balls. It's pretty tasty, I'll give you that. All in all, definitely a good place to drink and hang out.

We had a blast with our gang in traffic. Not just the decor , alcohol and the music, we enjoyed the food and hookah as well. The thin crust pizza was yum and the freaky chicken chowmein had us coming for seconds. The only thing that we thought can be taken care of is the seating. If you don't mind the prices which are a bit on the steeper end, it is a great place to hang out with your gang and shake a leg.

I have never been to a bar so I'll be writing as a first time experience in bar kind of atmosphere. I kinda liked the theme of the bar and it looked cool. Now you won't be going to a bar for just look at it and admire how beautiful it looks, you have other places to do for that like pandels at Durgapuja or festival of art kind of stuff. The music was too loud for me, as a non-loud music lover I kinda hated it. You can't even talk to your mate properly so that's a minus point. Then comes the overpriced menu. I mean the Budweiser bottle served looked like 300ml Pepsi bottle and price was 220. I can get Budweiser Magnum at that price and few sticks of smoke. The dishes were good enough to eat. We had pizza with pork. Kinda liked the food but then again I have very few experiences with pizza. So if you love loud music and don't love your money have fun at Traffic.

P.S. You are going to.a bar so you don't love your money, my bad.

Situated in City Centre Rajarhat, this place came as a surprise to me. The environment of this place is really happening, the staff courteous and the food tasty. What can one want apart from these. If all you need to be carefree is good music, great crowd and a cocktail, then this is the best place to drop in. But do make up your mind to wait as the area always is packed.
I gave this place a visit on the occasion of Bhaidooj, with my brothers and the place did not disappoint us. We were greeted with warmth and were given a table within 5 mins of waiting. Since none of us wanted to eat much, we order a fries platter along with two glasses of hard drinks for my brothers and a watermelon cocktail for me. I loved it personally. Would definitely want to give this place a second visit .

I loved the place. Went there yesterday and it was my first visit. The place is amazing starting from the interiors, the music, the chairs were not very comfortable to sit on though. The place has a rustic feel to it. 
Coming to food .... We had ordered for Parmesan crusted fish, which was very nice.. Baked fish with cheese and it just melts in your mouth...totally üòã, Balwant Singh's Amritsari kabeb is basically chicken tangri Kabab... It was decent. Food needs to be worked on. 
 For Drinks we went for DarU ki Tanki ...This had a creamy texture and it is rum based... Didnt like it so much üôÑ, Traffic Photographic ...This was really nice with orange flavors. We also ordered Draught beer and pan Hookah... 
The staff is warm and the service is good. The only turn off is that the place shuts down exactly at 12am so they basically start shutting things by 11:30ish and the music also goes off at 11:45ish üôÅ

The music was fab and we had a nice time enjoying and dancing....wished it last long.... Waiting to visit it again soonüòá

If you get a holiday on weekday and want to have some booze during lunch time, this would be your place! This pub is offering booze in real cheap deal during 12-5 on weekdays! Still I wasn't able to rate it highly because of the food I tried!

AMBIENCE

This is located on 2nd floor of City Center 2. It has some rustic look with seating arrangements and plates they use during service. Their music selection was really good! 

SERVICE

Service stuffs are friendly here and they try to make you feel comfortable. Service speed is also OK.

FOOD & DRINKS

I would segregate this is 2 sections. During happy hours, alcohol is realy cheap at this place. We had house beer, cosmo, mojito and screwdriver. Cocktails were well prepared and alcohol content was apt. Nothing to complain here!
Now coming to food, we tried 
CHICKEN RISOTTO - This dish was perfect in texture, chicken quantity was good, made with arborio rice (best one for risotto)..but sadly it was lacking any flavour. May be the stock they used wasn't that flavourful. I was feeling like eating white creamy blunt chicken rice.
GRULLED CHICKEN WITH MUSHROOM SAUCE - Presentation was nicely done for this dish. Quantity of chickrn was good, exotic vegetables were served but again things didn't clicked well. Mased potato was smooth in texture but lacking butter or garlic flavour. It tasted like the potato mash bengalis eat with rice. Chicken was not grilled to perfection, it got over cooked so lost most of its moistures. We had to struggle to finish this at the end. Also a slight of bitterness appeared due to over use of rosemery sauce or overcooking the chicken.

Overall this place has a huge potential because they are using high quality ingredients. But they have to do justice with the taste of the food. Here you have to pay 10% service charge over MRP and GST. So food has to be the star of the show. May be I would wait for few positive credible reviews before my next visit

The best pub in City Centre 2! The most preferred place. Ambience is commendable and the live shows adds to it. Saturday nights are really happening. The food they serve is nice. The pricing is moderate! The smoking room could have been a tad better. 
But overall, it's the best place to visit in City Centre 2.

Location : City Centre II at newly named Biswa Bangla Sarani, Rajarhat

The city have been stormed with Pubs nowadays and it is equally supported by the youngsters and the elder people. Taking a break from regular life and eating food at restros time has changed rapidly and the clock now tik toks more at night for the people in the city of joy. Some good pubs have surrounded all over the city and is getting the rush and popularity every possible day.

Talking about the restro bars and pubs around the city so this newly opened place at CC2 has the charm as well. The ambiance is quite cozy and small with dim dim lights and ear bursting loud music. Place is been decorated nicely but too small to contain huge walk ins at once. Service is fair but the staff are too busy in each table that sometimes they are so ignorant to provide water even when asked.

Reached here with couple of my type of people to enjoy the nightlife (as it said) and enjoy some quality time with them which we rarely get. We ordered Dry Chilly Chicken first which was quite spicy in taste, though 6 in numbers but perfectly marinated and tossed up nicely in the chilly sauce. Secondly we had the Szwan Paneer which was again 6 pieces each plate, the quality of the paneer was seriously cant be questioned as it was soft and juicy. Thirdly we had the Chicken Strips and that too was able to make us happy with the crunchiness and juiciness of the following strips.¬†

The two hour stay there was very delightful as we experienced some good food and ear soothing music from the 90s too. The dance floor was on the move and crowded all the time. the evening was just rocking.

3. Large screen and popular mix of music, good DJ.

cons-
1. Small sized dance floor,
2. Over enthusiastic lady manager in the entrance, interferes in the choice of table/ chair everything..people should have the freedom where to sit, where to stand..itz irritating and classless,
3. Lighting has a scope to improve, not bad at all presently.

Visited the place yesterday with my fiance. Completely fell in love with this place. It's a one of a kind experience.
The ambience is too good, the decor prefect. Good food with good music is always a perfect combination, you see.

Coming to the food, we ordered Schezwan Fried Chicken (It tasted good I wish it was a bit drier), Chilly Chicken Pizza (The best pizza I've had by far. Thin crust with perfect quantity of cheese and toppings. I wanna run back for a bite anytime its that good), Crispy Fried Chicken (The best thing we ate yesterday was undoubtedly this item. Crispy chicken served with mayonnaise is something you need to much on, trust me). Now comes the sweetest gesture shown by Traffic Gastropub, we ordered Oreogasm (which is said to be their signature dessert) but sadly it wasn't available, the attendant came up with a jar of Orange Mousse saying that Oreogasm wasn't available and instead they were providing us with Orange Mousse COMPLIMENTARY from their side. Yay! Nothing gets better you see, when you're done with the last drop of whiskey, the last bite of crispy fried chicken and you're craving for something sweet.

Love this place to bits. Will definitely visit again.
Kolkata needs more places like this.

I went to this place today with a friend. The decor is amazing. We took a few minutes just to appreciate the interior work. You have to see this place to understand. There was a DJ throughout, playing the latest dance numbers. Regarding food and drinks, we ordered a beer pitcher which they give in a super tall glass and beer lovers would enjoy it. For starters we ordered a schezwan fried chicken, though spicy was really yummy. For main course, we ordered Pizza Fredda (non-veg)...this pizza is great for those who can't choose between a salad or a pizza...this pizza is thin crust with lots of salad and pork and chicken but still very light. For dessert we initially ordered a chocolate volcano where the cake was so soft that it just melted in our mouth...however since the portion was too small for my sweet tooth, we ordered another dessert...Oreo-gasm...it has a huge portion but it's mind blowingly tasty and even the ones who don't have a sweet tooth will be heart broken when it gets over.

Overall a great place to eat, drink and hang out with friends or loved ones. They also have a regular live band. Do check this place out and spread the word if you like it as much as I doüòçüòçüòç

Had a great time whenever we've been here. Great place for music parties. Food is great and staff very friendly. Nice cocktails and mocktails. Easy on the purse and lovely atmosphere.Must visit in City Centre 2.

Finally got #stuckintraffic

Was waiting on for this for more than months now, after seeing it in cc2 and having walked past it many a times. Just before the independence day, they had their grand entry and man, it was really amazing

Decor : Quirky and state of the art, boasts of a design that not many outlets can boast of, rusty yet classy, creative and yet authentic, the decor and the ambiance will suit all moods across all ages.

Staff: Polite, courteous and always with a smile. They knew what we would like and they were pretty well versed as well, with the food that was on the menu, and providing us insights with the tastebuds we prefer

Food: Now the name suits them, gastropub, being a regular, i had the chance to indulge into a lot of their delicacies.¬†

The cold pizza is a must, the first of the kind that i had.¬†

The galoti kebab was a killer.¬†

Their rolls, served in a truck was awesome till the last bite.¬†

They had something called crazy noodles, which was crazy in all aspects.¬†

Staff rice was something really unique.

Had a host of thin crust pizzas, which were a class apart of its own.

Their chops, and the way of presentation was really amazing.

Oreogasm was truly orgasmic in a Oreo chocolaty Way

And the man of the match was their nutella pizza, which is a must for every visit of mine

I would drop by soon for another round of gastro adventures and take a dip into their bar section.¬†

The smoking zone is really nice, and the bar, from its last look, looked very promising

.Another aspect was, the presence of a dj and some soulful lice music, which was also something amazing as well. For gulping down your favorite food with the best music, or taking a drink with some really trance music, or a beer listening to a great voice, this outlet has it all to offer.

Overall, if you want something truly out of the box, with a lot of amazing experiences, this is the place.

For me, this certainly is the #1 in the recommendation and priority list for food and alcohol and all around experience

The very presence of this place make you feel drawn towards it. It stands out with it's classic decor, rocking music, nice food, beautiful cocktail, amazing sisha, fast service among all others place in city centre 2 . The place has a very young and energetic vibe to it. Traffic gastropub located at the 2nd floor of the City Centre 2 ,is definitely one of the best gastropub in city. If you still have not visited traffic gastropub, you are really missing out on a lot. Must visit ###### D.

What more can I say about this place. This place has a very special place in my heart. It's made with a heart beating inside it. This place has life. The moment you enter traffic, you tend to get stuck in there. And as the brand says #stuckintraffic it actually makes complete sense.

I am a regular over there and being very honest I get a lively vibe after I enter this place. Always filled with good people and there will be something or the other happening over there from live bands, unplugged sessions, stand up comedies, karaoke nights, Dj sessions to almost everything. This place opened its doors on the 14th of August and since then they are doing really well in respect of the newly opened places in town.

It's decor is one of its kind. The moment you enter you get awestruck by its view of the streets recreated inside this outlet. Everything looks so real out here. Closed shops with shutter arts all over which ends into a glass house and it's called the smoke house (their smoking room). They have a 25 feet long bar, much like the British bars with wooden tops, a very well lit bar, I must say. Every where you look there is art and with it comes its class. They justified industrial design bars. 

Now comes the food and the drinks. Try out the "dhoper chop" section, the mashir mangshor chop was something so tasty that you would want its taste to last long. Their thin crust pizzas are another thing that gives you the gastronomic feel.
Oreogasm, the dessert, OMG!! What would happen when Oreos, chocolates, cheese and vanilla ice cream melts in your mouth?? I would call it oreogasm. Traffic Photographic, their signature cocktail, its orange in flavour with bourbon whiskey. It's cray!! 

And the service team, they are courteous, well behaved, talented bunch of guys working it out so brilliantly in such rush hours.

Altogether, it's a win win for Traffic Gastropub, from my side.

The newest and the best place in Kolkata if you want to have a good time with great food, amazing drinks and a hint of traditional Kolkata as part of the ambience. Traffic is a themed restro-bar based on old town Kolkata which we ever so miss and never want to let go of. It might make you a little nostalgic and make you feel that you're actually dining on the footpaths of Kolkata. Besides the ambience, they have very innovative and awesome tasting food. Mashir Mangsher Chop is my favourite. Also they have a huge collection of cocktails and mocktails which taste great and are not too heavy on the pocket. Ronnie Handle is a must try. And the icing on the cake is that they have live performances from beautiful upcoming artists and a great DJ to fill in. All in all, Traffic is my go to place whenever I'm in Kolkata from now on and I'd hands down recommend this place to anyone and everyone. :)

A bunch of us friends decided to ditch the crowd in the mainstream Kolkata restaurants and decided to give the first gastro pub in the city a try. Safe to say, we weren‚Äôt disappointed. The ambiance channels the ‚ÄòTraffic‚Äô vibe that is promised in the restaurant‚Äôs name, albeit with an impressive aesthetic. Being a nerd, I was completely mesmerized by the wide array of board games that are available here. However, when my friends stepped on the dance floor, the impeccable choice of music (uncharacteristically) inspired me to shake a leg too! Though all the bite sized treats we ordered were delicious, the pasta definitely stood out!

Also keeping the service people on ground in mind with their "Happy-go-lucky service" which gave a good Happy Trip as always....

One of the best gastropubs in kolkata. Concept is very different from other pubs in the city. They justify the gastronomy with their food quality. Had visited this place yesterday and they had a live band setup which sang coldplay, Bob Marley tracks as well as retro Hindi numbers. One of my best experience so far.c cocktails were very innovative and presentation was different from others. Service was quick and staffs were courteous.

Situated at city centre 2, the new kid in the block, traffic gastropub, has already become the new it thing! With so many newer and cooler place popping up for hanging out, what makes this place stand out is the food tastes as good as it looks! The decor is @urban, hip and even though the music is loud, it does blend well with the kind of ambience this place is looking to provide. 
Service was courteous and the staff pleasant! They have some really classic and some really cool cocktails as well as shakes which does not make anyone feel excluded. Highly recommended!

Kolkata didnt have enough gastropubs but with this one i am sure the gap has been filled. The decor of the place tries to lift your mood and fill up with positive vibes and energetic mood. The taste of music, colour themes and the aura built makes for a great evening.
All i could make out was that i wanted to dance, sip on drink and look around for an amazing bunch of people.
I ordered Chilly Paneer which was saucy and fresh - just how you would want it to be. 
We also ordered noodles, crispy pakoras, summer punch & cosmopolitan which were repeated twice! 
Totally winning a 5 star from me!! üëçüèª

The traffic Gastropub is situated in cc2 and it's like the new kid in town. With the interior being absolutely similar to the name, this place is a must visit for all. The lighting of this place is dim with music playing all the time. There are a variety of combos available which include hookah and some without it. The food is really good here from the pizza, pasta to the finger food they offer. There is a variety of cocktails also available here. To pass the time while waiting for your order to come, board games are provided. Over all the experience is good and I'm looking forward to visit soon. And those who haven't been here please CHECK THEM OUT.

This is truly a delightful place to enjoy a meal. the feel they have recreated is unmistakable and the ambiance is quite extraordinary, it's that special touch of Kolkata that we love and have grown up with.
I'm sure you'll agree that fairly good food is served in many places but it's the unique setting and the effort that goes into recreating a special atmosphere that gives it class. With such an outstanding feel coupled with delectable food fare, this is the place you would love to be with friends.It's the one traffic stop you would be stopping by most often and I can surely say their Italian Fare is quite Traffic stopper. Wish you all a Bon Apetite.

To start with, the place's d√©cor and ambience are a feast for the eyes! All the food items and beverages (cocktails too!) are served in such creative and imaginative ways that you'll feel sorry to eat them (laughs). I personally was smitten by their chicken pasta and fish fingers! It is undoubtedly a perfect place to spend your evenings or lonely afternoons with your friends and family. The live band playing heartfelt songs just adds brownie points to this awesome place!

I visited this place today on my quest for a place to sit and chill with my friends after watching a movie at inox. The ambience is great and the addition of the dance floor and a smoking areas are a good welcome. The music was a tad loud but what else do you expect from a place where you can get up and dance. The food was pretty good and the rates were pretty pocket friendly. The best thing is that the atmosphere feels secure enough with a good crowd to actually let go and enjoy as a girl. The staff is pretty helpful and cooperating. Overall, had a really fun time. Will definitely be back soon.

All that glitters is not gold....

Ambience- Dim lights "EXTRA" loud music & extremely uncomfortable seating. They tried enough to made me leave but Since I ordered the food and shisha I could not leave. It's all chair and table so not so comfortable. 

Shisha- Our shisha was shared between just two people and it ended in just 15 minutes. This is the worst shisha I had. I didn't even went for coal change it was such a waste.

Food & Shake- Ordered a kit kat shake, Chilly paneer and a pasta. I wish the chef or the person made shake had the time to taste. 
         Shake was sour in taste I asked for a change a guy came up and said sure sir and vanished in the dim light üòÇ. 
        Chilly panner was completely road style with loads of soya sauce and pasta was icing on the cake. I came across the first place which doesn't serve garlic bread with pasta. Pasta hardly had vegetable and was completely stale. I completely left it and did not asked for a change. 
          After all this I paid them 18% GST + 10% Service charge. Which comes to 28% which are charged by 3 and 5 star property.

Suggestions- Spend some extra money on traveling and get down at sector 5 and make most of your money. You would find a better ambience and great food and in case if you are in CITY CENTRE 2 go for food court or any other place except this.

Verdict- Don't even try for the sake of try.

The only thing i didn't like was the service charge system..........they charge gst + 10% service charge. Taffic gastropub is not maintaining the govt. rules u guys cant charge service charge extra when gst is applicable....its not right. guys whoever wants to go their just cheek your tax charges which is illegally they charged (10% service charge). Its totally a unfair trade practice traffic gastropub is doing.

Going to cc2 has been a regular off day plan fr me.. and from last few months was seeing this new startup being on its way.. earlier it wasnt known as in what new is to come here but the banner could easily give a hint of pub kind of place opening soon.. so it was just anothr off and as usual i was roaming around there and saw this open. The wait was over i thought and within no time i went in.. they had a quiet a good combo offers written on a blackboard.. the combos were with hookah and without hookah too.. entered, not so busy but good loud music.. the ambience as the name suggests was more on the roadside rough n tough theme depicting some street scenes too... we got a table for two easily.. sat nd  checked the menu... the menu wasnt the best i would say.  Nothing extraordinary though in the menu.. less of chinese starters i guess Nd vegeterian options too.. we planned to try the chili panner and the chinese bhel with a hookah and a beverage.. we didnt go for any combo although the value didnt had a lot of difference if ordered ala carte too.. the food was great in taste.. portion size was adequate too.. 
The only thing i didnt like was the service charge system.. they levy a service charge of 10% plus 18% gst .. which is clearly mentioned in the menu.. and when i denied giving the service charge after given the check.. the service personel stated that its mentioned in the menu sir, we cant help.. this was something which i really didnt wanted to see in a newly opened pub.. hope someday some other person would also stand by this on not giving the service charge when its not mandetory .. 
Aprt from this its a must try place.. surely looking forwrd for a second visit soon..

When it opened :::
I really like the d√©cor. It's totally street like traffic, from the floors to the plates everything is blended to DECOR. It has a live band too, the hookah was good and they served the pasta which was way too differently good. 
Overall it's a good place, they'll serve alcohol they said.


Now::
Sorry it's a very overpriced place. I had hookah and a starter it's freaking 906rs only thing changed is that they have people dancing in front of u with a amateur DJ.and serving alcohol 
That's it..And they charge a 10% extra establishment charge.
