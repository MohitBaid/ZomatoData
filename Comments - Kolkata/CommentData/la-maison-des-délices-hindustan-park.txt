Had ordered for a trufle and black forest pastry. Both were light and fluffy. I'm waiting to visit the place as early as I can to grab more varieties.

I've heard such good things about this place, I was looking forward to come down. The ambience is good and inviting, seating comfortable at the best and great service. 

The shrimp cutlet was good (both in portion size and taste). And dips served with it (mustard mayo and sweet chilly) were fantastic. The honey chilly potato was huge in portion size and can easily be shared between 4 - taste-wise decent also. 

The cafe mocha was, however, pretty average. 

Overall, another above average coffee shop- definitely not bad

Perfect place to drop in with your loved ones. Nice cosy ambience, very tasty food. One can get nice coffee to start with. Omelettes are just mind-blowing. Compare to other places in this area the price is cheaper. Highly recommended.

So I visited delices with a couple of friends tried the desserts and savoury combination. The combination was for 2 people where they gave two coffees, 4 small desserts and 4 savoury items. The quantity was mind blowing compare to its price. All of it costed us around 250 only. Really liked the savoury sandwich and the chocolate tart .

May be it was a wrong choice of day for me.... not that the food tasted bad... but yes.... if those similar dishes were to be compared with that of Mocambo.... then yess.... it tasted bad.... Prawn thermidor is much more interesting and delicious in Mocambo.... Moreover... the day I went... I found the place to be pretty dirty... a fly constantly buzzing around.... ACs not in proper working condition... it did bother me...

Nice Ambience! Good Music Playing! Though i made a table booking but there was not much crowd. The menu has got a lot of variations of italian delicacies. After going through the whole menu several times i finally made up my mind to order am Fettucine Pasta with Bacon and Chicken and a chicken tetrazine with spaghetti. Both tasted awesome, no question in that. The only concern is the customer service and the serving time. I received the order almost 20-30mins after ordering them. Apart from that there's nothing much to complain about. While entering i could smell the fragnance of fresh baked cakes so I couldn't resist that and ordered choco chip muffin and chocolate walnut marble cake and those were just awesome. So, in one word if you're around southern avenue and look for a cool place to hangout, you can always visit here!!!

 for starters, Chicken parmigiana was delicious.Fish florentine and couq au van was also nice.
The brownie Milk shake was chunks and nice. it was chocolately and chunky.

Bought an extremely delicious Chocolate Truffle Cake. The cake was so yummy...filled with chocolate. The cake was decorated with white and brown chocolate geometric decoratives. That was really unique. Even there was small designs painted on them. The chocolate syrup bursts into your mouth as you have that first bite. Heavenlicious! Their cakes are must have for pastry lovers! 😊

Everytime I had passed by this place I had thought that this is a takeaway joint. It seems tiny from outside. But boy when you enter in there you'll be blown away! It's a beautifully decorated cafe with amazing food. The cakes and pastries here are like the ones I had never tasted before. They'll simply leave you wanting for more. The mocktails are unique and extremely refreshing. I had taken a Calcutta bhetki fish fry which came with a generous portion of french fries. This was the show stealer. I would recommend everyone to give this a try and thank me later! The garlic bread with cheese was amazing too. 
So if you are having those sudden hunger pangs go and nibble something here. You'll definitely like it.
The pocket pinch is a bit high. But the food makes up for it.

A brewery cum eatery at Hindustan Park which is definitely one of the best and most attractive in its class. Ambiance is wonderful and it has got separate arrangements for the cafe and the restaurant. The restaurant inside is quite spacious which is not evident if one looks from outside. The pastries here are quite delicious and pricing is somewhat on the higher side. However, that is expected taking into consideration the location of the place. Overall, a wonderful place to have a evening snack or two!!

I loved the chandelier decorations and the white oh so cool ambience.we went for snacks only. Had croque Monsieur, mutton lasagne and brownie shake. The foods tasted heavenly. Mutton lasagne was too good.
Will love to go back for pan masala panna cotta masala dessert,chicken parmigiana and chocolate fondant.

Had been here quite a number of times.
Would highly recommend the Chicken Parmigiana. The pastas here are rich and creamy and  the Chicken Pesto Spaghetti is one of the best in town. Also, the Risotto Con Pollo Olive among the risottos served here. Most of their salads are just okay, but almost all the variations of the Caesar Salad here cuts the mark. 
In soups, I only liked Crème de Brocoli and Consommé Lord Curzon.
Pattisiere is one of the finest here.
I loved the Chocolate Fondant with Ice-cream and the other one is the Hazelnut ice cream.
My last recommendation here is to try the Pina Colada.
Location wise its bit of a sneak peek.
The ambience is posh and sophisticated. I like their decorations and the chandeliers.
The only downside is their speed of service. Though it has improved a lot in the last 2 years.

Me and my wife went for a quick food at this bistro on Mahasaptami evening of Durgapuja. The decor is simple but very cool with effective air-conditioned ambience. Typical bistro style sitting arrangement. We ordered a simple meal of garlic toast, prawn cutlets and fried bhekti fillet with  chips. Though the garlic toast did not meet our expectations, being  too hard and rubbery, the prawn was perfectly prepared with one of the finest quality. Fish and chips was also good. Quantity was adequate and value for money. Price was reasonable, we paid Rs 1240/- for our meal with taxes.

There was a time when one would often overhear people talking about how restaurants compromise on their quality during durga puja festivals to cater the huge rush of customers. Well things have changed and for good. It was a double date for us on the sasthi of 2016. I remember how we zeroed in on this restaurant and how delighted we were when our chosen option turned out to be so fabulous. Frm a knowledgable staff to a minimalistic elegant decor to one of the best continental and italian around, this place was a winner from the word 'go'. Risotto was creamy ans delicious. The sandwich was insanely filling and flavourful. Thi fish and chips was classic. The desserts were mouthwatering. In a nutshell, this place deserves a 5* and rightfully so. N.B the portions of each dish can serve Hagrid easily.

Explored another fine dining place at Kolkata. The place is very nicely decorated with lights and curtains and beautiful pictures. The whitish theme adds a great flavour in it. The ambiance is also very good with sweet music.
Now let's come to service, the waiters are very active and efficient. The service time is moderate. 
Now the main part, FOOD. We went there in a very big group so I got the chance to taste a lot of dishes. All of them were delicious but I wouldn't recommend any of them as outstanding. Comparing the food I would say it's a bit over priced. I liked Bacon Wrapped Chicken Roulate which was in there winter special menu also the mixed grill platter was very delicious and in the desserts I liked Brailey's Parfait, I will recommend you to try these if you visit this place.

Keep going back to this place for its fantastic ambience and even better food. The thin crust pizzas are cooked to perfection and I especially enjoy the pastas. The main course dishes such as the classic Tetrazzini and the  Stroganoff are inimitable in their taste. The breakfast menu is one of the best in the cities, and I would definitely recommend the Hot Chocolate as well as the Oreo Shake. Also particularly appreciate the way the food is plated and served. The prices are middle of the range while the service is top notch. The décor is quaint and cozy.

One of the best continental places in our hometown. 
Though I had only dessert, since I was already full. It was extremely delicious. 
Never mind, will visit again to check out the continental food. 
Great decor, ambience is  another reason it attracted me so much, good crowd.

I had baked fish here, and trust me, it was the best i have ever had. The ambience was very sophisticated, the staffs were very friendly, and the food strikes the perfect chord. Eagerly waiting for the next visit. And, oh!, dont miss out on the pastries.

I rate this place 1...bcoz of the glass of water i had that too after asking for 5 times 😄😀!!! I am very surprised with the rating 4.2 in zomato..because Of the experience I personally had.Today i had been to this place and ordered my food...after waiting for 45 mins to an hour, i checked the status of my order and found out that the food was still getting baked!!! Agn after 5 mins i checked and after some animated conversation and story making inside the kitchen (which i cud see from outside), the waiter cem up and sed that the food has burnt and they haven't started cooking the 2nd item!! Imagine that 45 mins was already wasted and offcourse the mood!!! So we decided to leave and to my surprise nobody even bothered to apologise!!! In another visit, i had found a piece of hair hiding inside a pastry!!! So please visit this place at your own risk...because they don't value ur time and food quality and service needs a lot of improvement!!!

A great afternoon break only because we decided to give in and walk into the restaurant. The 'table for 2' is really isn't a table for two, but notwithstanding crockery hassles, we had a good time. The Lemongrass Creme Brulee was not available and we were disappointed. The lemon tart more than made up for it. The portions of the Chicken cutlets and fish fingers were adequate for 2 people.

Service was brisk and there's nothing to be upset at. At some point I would like to revisit for a couple of other items on the menu.

Initially, I used to think that this place had only desserts. Until a friend and I were forced to visit because of other restaurants being too full, courtesy Saraswati Pujo. But man, oh man. The interiors are fantastic, the music being played was really good, and the ambience was nice, clean and sophisticated. Not that I'm being elitist, but it's true. And since this place is tucked away in the inside lanes of Southern Avenue, there's little to no noise from the outside, which is an absolute welcome change. Coming to the food, again, initially, the prices seemed a little steep. Until they gave the food. A burger, that big, seemed just fine for them to charge 250 for. All in all, it was a good experience. I won't call it a must try, but one wouldn't be hurt if one tries. It's quite nice.

French finesse written all over the place. Stunning ambience....described here in Zomato as a beautiful cafe....and truly so....you will just fall in love with this place once you walk in. This place is truly a hidden gem....a Kohinoor Diamond hidden in the bylanes of South Kolkata. The food is excellent....you are served some of the best continental dishes. The desserts and pastries are simply from heaven. A small bite of any of these....(and I say any cause all are equally exciting to the taste buds).......and one is transported to some other world, a world of delightful sweet pleasures. The service is excellent. The chef's experience in the confectionary industry does show through the wide array of lovely desserts, pastries and cakes available here. A must visit for all. I am definitely coming back and getting all my known people here to enjoy some of the finest delicacies in Le Maison Des Délices.

This quaint looking restaurant is one of the best continental places I have been to in Kolkata. The seating, staff, the service... Everything's characteristic of the sophistication and finesse the French are known for. Coming to the food, the pork ribs were delectable with mild flavours of the beer. The mozzarella and spinach pastel was so delicious that I can write a separate review for it. For entre we ordered bhetki Bolognese and chicken parmigiana. Both were well cooked and I loved the presentation of the dishes. 
The climax was even better with the hazelnut chocolate sphere which is something I will visit the restaurant again for. The prices are high but when you're satisfied you don't mind the extra bucks.
A must visit if you want a refreshing change from the regular India or Bengali spreads

Good food is often measured by its presentation, appearance and aromatic attributes or the ambience it is served in, even before it is tasted. A similar sense is delivered here at La Maison Des Délices with their picturesque décor and authentic presentation of dishes. When we hear of La Maison Des Délices, it tends to create the image of a French bistro in the mind.

This Bistro looks deceptively small from outside. The entrance is through their bakery but it widens up into a long, rectangular restaurant. It’s a huge place with convenient seating capacity for 50 souls. The interiors are as elegant as it gets. The floor has the checkered chess board design and white transparent chandeliers have been hung from the ceiling.

The man behind the cafe is Kolkata’s own – Chef Chiradeep Pal. Chef Pal has 15 years of experience in the confectionary industry, having worked at Taj Bengal, Kenilworth Hotel and Flury’s. He is also the founder and operator of JBL Academy of Culinary Arts.

The service was fluent throughout with the servers replacing the plates for each course.

Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

They just launches their Winter Menu and I'm invited here to taste their veg items by Management.

Spread across 2,500sq ft, the cafe offers an exquisite range of cakes, pastries and savouries along with a wide range of European and Continental items.

Chessboard floor design, chandeliers, gold-and-beige upholstery... La Maison Des Delices — Patisserie & Bistro looks as yummy as its food. Housed in a 50-year-old building at the junction of Purna Das Road and Hindustan Park Road, the cafe blends its old Calcutta charm with a surprisingly delicious spread of Continental cuisine and confectionery.

The name literally translates into The House of Delicious — Pastry Shop and Cafe. The cakes, pastries and savouries at the patisserie are crafted by chef Chiradeep Pal, who has worked with Taj Bengal, Kenilworth Hotel and Flurys before opening this cafe with foodie friend Partha Sarathi Bose, an IT professional.

The adjoining bistro offers a range of Continental items including French classics and an Italian selection of pizza, pasta and sauces freshly made in an open kitchen format.

The 50-cover cafe has two banquet halls (400sq ft and 250sq ft), which can be used to host small parties.

A meal at the cafe would cost around Rs 250-400 per person; a dinner at the bistro will set you back by Rs 1,000 for two.

Now let's see what they have veg in their Winter Menu -

# Starter's :-

* polenta crusted mozzarella-Spinach patcel - Crispy Parcels coated with crushed polenta with stuffing of spinach and crushed corns coated in ricotta and mozzarella. It was crispy, creamy, cheesy and tastes heavenly delicious. served with tomato and bell pepper relish. very tasty recommended.

* Twice cooked mushrooms with bell peppers & parmesan - A Traditional European dish made with fresh baked mushrooms stuffed with red, yellow and green bell peppers and some finely diced garlic and mushrooms cutouts sprinkled with some parmesan cheese and black pepper. Smell and taste of mushrooms 100% natural and stuffing was aromatic. If you like European cuisine you like that too. Served with green peas paste.

# Beverages :-

* Banana Caramel - Perfectly made thick banane shake with hint of salty Caramel in it. Taste was refreshing, natural and very delicious. Served in Caramel coated tall glass and garnished with banana slice and red Cherry.

* Virgin Mojito - The Traditional virgin Mojito made with refreshment of mints and tanginess of lemons with added some syrups tastes refreshing, sweet, little tangy and very delicious.

# Main Course :-

* Ratatouille Primavera with Cheese Fondue - Ratatouille was the traditional French dish made with sliced vegetables like summer squash, red onions, sweet peppers, aubergines etc slow cooked with spicy tomato paste and served with Cheese Fondue which was a Swiss dish of melted cheese. Taste of Ratatouille was spicy, fresh, Herby and very delicious. Fondue was cheesy and equally delicious.

* Tian of winter vegetables with corn & jalapeño bisque & focaccia tuile - Winter vegetables sauteed in butter and simmered with tomato-cream sauce then make their tian over grilled slice potatoes served with corn & jalapeño bisque with hint of homemade tomato jam in it. It tastes very delicious Creamy and cheesy. Served with focaccia bread. A perfect winter meal.

And now the time comes to talk about our Shows topper dessert. We ended our tasting session with that heavenly delicious dessert reviewed below -

* Hazelnut Ice cream in a chocolate sphere with sauce anglaise, berry gel - Choco hazelnut icecream scoop with re d berries gel, anglaise and liquid dark chocolate covered with dark chocolate and milk chocolate mixed sphere which was melted with hot Caramel sauce. Hazelnut icecream scoop was so flavorful that you can die for it and it tastes heavenly delicious with gel, sauces, liquid chocolate and breaked sphere. It was the tastiest and most flavorful dessert I've ever tasted. Personal favorite. A Must try. Highly recommended to all.

Before rapt up like to thank Event Organiser, Shahbaaz and restaurant staff for such wonderful experience.

A must try place. Highly recommended to all European cuisine lovers and dessert lovers.

La Maison Des Délices, one of those restaurant where you hardly find anything which upsets you. From the ambience to service and then the most important thing, food, everything is just perfect.
I heard about this place quite a few time from my friends but never got the opputunity to visit this place before yesterday. 
Went to this place in the evening and had a lovely experience.

Ambience: Classy decor with some lovely photographs and paintings hanging with the walls. I loved the bright lighting which was going well with the sitting.

Service: Perfectly fine. Fast, courteous and a smile to make you happy with the food.

Food: In the starters I had "Beer Braised Pork Ribs with Barbeque Glaze". It was just amazing, looked great when it came on the table and tasted better. The pork was so soft that it melted as soon it went in the mouth.
"Chicken Ossobuco" was great again. The flavour was yummy and then the presentation uplifted the overall dish.
In the main course "Chicken Parmigiana" was the dish I loved the most. A must try for sure.
And at the end you need something really yummy to finish things in a great note so we got "Hazelnut Icecream In a Chocolate Sphere with Sauce Anglaise, Berry Gel", I cannot say much about this, but yeah you would definitely thank me later.

Last Words: A great place to have some delicious dishes. A must visit place for food lovers.

La Maison Des Délices literally means "house of delights" and this place doesnt fail to deliver that promise.This patisserie and brasserie has made its name in cakes and savouries.It might look like a small cosy dessert parlour from outside but there's more to watch out for.The only-white interiors with beautiful chandeliers and painting gives a snazzy touch to this place.Now coming to the food,we had-

1:Banana Caramel-This drink is a fusion flavour of banana and caramel(dominated by banana) and is quite refreshing in taste.

2:Polenta Crusted Mozzarella-Spinach Parcel-This is fried parcel of ricotta,spinach-corn and mozzarella,crusted with polenta,served wjth tomato and bell pepper relish.This indeed tasted good and is a must try.

3:Twice Cooked Mushroom With Bell Pepper and parmesan-In this dish mushroom are baked with vegetables and sprinkled with parmesan.

4:Ratatouille Primavera With Cheese Fondue-A slow cooked stew of red onions,summer squash,mini brinjal and sweet peppers layered with spicy cheese fondue.This dish tasted good and presentatjon was also good.

5:Hazelnut icecream in a chocolate sphere-This dessert was a showstealer and was one of the best dessert we have ever tried.It was hazelnut icecream in a chocolate sphere,revealed by hot caramel sauce.

The food presentation and service went very well and a visit to this place is recommended.

The place looks like a dessert outlet. But the cafe inside is beautiful. It's small and quant, with a lot of space around the seating areas. The ambiance is quite pleasant with good music. Ideal place to visit with friends for lunch.

The menu is quite extensive with a lot of options for continental, italian, breakfast, desserts, shakes etc. The items are also beautifully explained so that one knows what to expect when they order. 

Food is delicious. I have been there several times with friends. We have tried the Caesar salad, bacon wrapped prawns with mayonnaise, rosemary braised mutton shanks, spaghetti, cold coffee, ice tea, milk shakes, desserts....and honestly all of them are amazing and beautifully prepared.

So thumbs up to this place. Head out to Délices and have a fantastic meal with your friends and family.

The place looks like a small desserts store from outside, but as you step in its a huge fine dine restaurant. They have recently come up with a winter menu which I tried on my last visit and it was a great experience here.
Here are the things I can recommend you to try at this place.
• Banana Carmel : This is basically a Banana Milk shake type drink with Carmel flavor in it. This looked and tasted interesting to me.
• Chicken Ossobuco : Chicken Legs slowly braised Legs of Chicken in Caramelized Onion Compote served with Crispy Vegetable. This was the best dish I had here. The Chicken legs were so soft and juicy.
• Beer Braised Pork Ribs with Barbeque Glaze : This was the Pork ribs grilled in Barbeque Sauce and served with Grilled Corn Bread. The Pork and Bread combination tasted brilliant.
.
For the mains we had,
.
• Bhetki Florentine : Very popular Bhetki Fish baked with Cheese Sauce and Creamy spinach. This was served with Strings of Potato. I liked it very much.
.
Desserts
.
• Hazelnut Ice cream with in a Chocolate Sphere : The perfect desserts anyone can desire for. The chef himself came and made it by pouring hot berry gel on the Chocolate Sphere. Just fantastic.
.
La Maison De Delices is one of the best Fine dine place near Gariyahat. Come here and you will love it.
Prices are reasonable and their service is wonderful.

This fine diner must seem like a really small place from the outside, but wait till you step in. The restaurant is so so pretty with all those beautiful chandeliers, white walls, white table clothes, beautiful furniture and what not! This place gives out some real good positive vibes!

Food :

* Beer braised  pork ribs with Barbeque glaze :  OMG this dish was unbelievable. One of the best pork ribs I've ever had. The ribs were so deliciously tender and juicy with the meat almost falling off the bones. Served on a bed of grilled corn bread, I would highly recommend this dish.

* Chicken Ossobuco : This dish was again amazing! The chicken was extremely tender and flavourful. THe meat was falling of the bone . Slow cooking really does wonders. And the caramelized onions were fab! So tender and almost sort of a sweet marmalade, it went well with chicken leg.

* Chicken Parmigiana : I loved this one as well. The tomato sauce was nicely done, the quality of cheese used was fantastic. The accompaniments in the form of grilled veggies and roast potatoes were lovely as well.

* Bhetki Florentine : Full marks for not using Basa fish.  The fish was yum yum yum.  Perfectly baked witht he right amount of creamy cheese sauce. This dish was heavenly!

* Hazelnut ice cream in a chocolate sphere : This has to be the show stopper. The chocolate dome was perfect and thin, The caramel sauce just collapsed it in no time, the cold ice cream underneath went well with it and the berry gel was yum! This dish is  a must order.

And a drink to go with this meal was Banana Caramel : Nice, thick and creamy. I liked this drink a lot!

Service was excellent and the staff was very well-mannered. Highly recommended.

I have been looking forward to dropping in at La Maison Des Delices for quite some time now and that time finally arrived last night. The place completely justifies the hype that it has been able to create around itself. While the service is good and the food is delicious, the dessert is on a whole different level altogether. I tried a few dishes out of their very special menu and loved all of them to bits.

Started off with the Chicken Ossobuco, which turned out to be my absolute favorite. What this is, is a slow-braised leg of chicken that has been served on a decadently delicious bed of caramelized onion compote. The only thing I think could have elevated the dish way further is a jus. The dish is additionally topped with country-fried vegetables, which extends a drastic textural contrast to the already moist chicken and the melt in the mouth onions.

I followed my first course with hearty servings of Bhetki Florentine and Chicken Parmigiana with country fried potatoes and roasted vegetables. While the former filled my mouth with elegant and subtle flavors with every spoonful, the other packed tangy and cheesy punches. Both the dishes were very impressive as well as filling. I accompanied this course with a glass of virgin mojito that certainly helped create some space for dessert, which is absolutely unmissable here.

For dessert, I settled for the very popular Hazelnut Ice cream in a Chocolate Sphere with Sauce Anglaise and berry gel. Every single component on that plate was meant to be on it and did justice to my expectations. All in all, I had a wonderful time feasting at La Maison Des Delices and can see myself becoming a regular in the very near future.

Finally visited this place after a lot of pushing from some of my friends and boy was I glad about going here. I tried a variety of dishes and will give the breakdown of those below:

Beer braised pork ribs with barbeque glaze - These pork ribs were well made and the flavor of the beer came out well in the dish.
Chicken ossobuco with onion compote - This tasted great and the onion compote was to die for, the chicken was slow cooked and the meat literally fell off the bones. Absolutely delicious!
Chicken Parmigiana - This was pieces of chicken breast with a tomato sauce (Not ketchup but more like a puree) which had mozzarella cheese on it, the sauce and cheese was just outstanding and the chicken was well cooked, the dish was served with some potatoes and vegetables and I kid you not, I could eat an entire dish of those potatoes and not be bored by them!Bhetki Florentine - The bhetki florentine had a great flavor to it and was absolutely stunning.

For dessert we had the Hazelnut ice cream in a chocolate sphere with sauce anglaise and berry gel, this was absolutely stunning and looked and tasted exactly like how it does in all those masterchef videos! Amazing amazing experience, very good staff, great ambience and I've heard they serve up a very nice chicken roulade, so saving that for next time! :D

It feels amazing to strike off places from your bucket list after a long wait. And the sheer pleasure of striking La Maison Des Délices off felt no different. Known for their high tea, and continental delicacies, this place had been recommended by many before I finally got to visit it last night. 

A few steps from Mrs Magpie, it's a quaint little café, which may appear as just another bakery shop from outside. However, the door gives away to a long lane, adorned on one side with an innovative agglomeration of kitchen essentials, and the other side makes your heart skip a beat with the delicious little cupcakes and pastries on display. A second door leads to the inside - antique decoration, classic chairs, beautiful paintings and photographs and checkerboard tiles - all in all, a great attempt to imitate the settings of a typical European café.

Coming to the point of interest - the food, here goes my list:

Drinks:
1. Banana Caramel: Creamy Banana Smoothie topped with a slice of banana and cherry - it's for all the banana lovers out there!

2. Virgin Mojito: They have modified the original style of the drink, with a taste more like that of Iced Tea, with a lot of mint leaves. 

Starters: 
1. Chicken Ossobuco: Chicken legs served in a bed of caramelised onion compote along with vegetable crisps. To be very honest, I loved the compote more than the chicken! Not that the chicken deserves any less credit, but the compote was outstanding!

2. Beer Braised Pork Ribs with Barbeque Glaze: This was my favourite dish of the evening, hands down! The beer soaked Pork Ribs were extremely soft, and the Barbeque sauce on top completed the divine combination. The grilled corn bread with it didn't disappoint either.

Main Course:
1. Bhetki Florentine: Staying true to the creamy spinach and cheese, this dish did absolute justice to the original. No excess cream, and no unnecessary cheesy inclusions - it was done just right.

2. Chicken Parmigiana with Country Fried Potato and Roasted Vegetables: This was chicken topped with a tangy sauce and parmesan cheese on top. The strong odour that is so characteristic of parmesan cheese was thankfully, absent. However, since I am not too fond of anything remotely related to tomatoes, I can only give an unbiased review on this one.

Desserts:
This has always been my favourite section and La Maison Des Délices ensured that I don't get disappointed. Hazelnut Ice Cream in a Chocolate Sphere was not only a delight to the taste buds, but also to the eyes. The gradual revelation of the inside ice cream by Caramel, as the chocolate Sphere melts away is a characteristic of the molecular gastronomy that is taking over the Kolkata restaurants now. The Berry Gel added just helped to enhance the taste.

Overall, totally recommended! I hope to go back soon to try their afternoon tea and other bakery and confectionaries!

I went for dinner with a few friends. The Ambience is beautiful and serene. It's a small cafe at first and then a door opens up to their restaurant,which is beautiful. 
We tried the winter menu here. The chef beleives in slow cooking,that makes sure that the meat is tender and packed with flavour to the bone. 
We ate the Chicken ossobuco, Beer braised pork ribs with Barbeque sauce, Bhetki Florentine. 
Beverages: Banana Caramel, Virgin Mojito. 
Dessert: Hazelnut icecream with chocolate sphere, caramel sauce and berry gel. 
I have no complaints with any item and loved every bit of it!

La maison des delices is a cafe located at hindustan park. I was very excited to visit this place ever since i have been seeing some BOOSTED posts on facebook about the high tea platter.

On reaching the restaurant you will see a wonderful facade of this place all bright and it does create a positive statement. The menu has been on display right out side the gate for creating an awarmess about the food they serve.

The moment you enter u see a rectangular lane which has the bakery products on display and some cover layout placed right opposite the bakery counter. Walk further and you will find a gate on the left. Entered the 2nd enclosure and it was just so antique. Really liked the interiors because of the chandeliers and the color tone of the walls(cream).

The restaurant looked busy even though it wasnt a packed house. We were not greeted nor escorted to our table.Eventually I sat in a table for two and the table was too small for my liking. Finally a Food & beverage personnel noticed me only after i raised my hands . The menu had a winter section and normal section which runs round the year.

We ordered for-

1)banana caramel
2)blended mint mocha
3)prawn cutlet
4)ratatouille
5)chicken strogenoff with rice.

Now the taste of blended mint mocha was decent but what i dint like was banana caramel. Honestly it was banana shake with caramel only evident in the glass for designing. Waiting for the starter to come our drinks were long gone before the prawn cutlet made its way to the table. Prawn cutlet was good and was served with a mayonnaise based sauce along side some lettuce. Again starts the waiting game for the main course. Ratatouille came after 15 minutes and it was annoying to wait. The ratatouille looked amazing but on taste it was very mediocre. Lacked the smoothness in the primavera(4 cheese) sauce. Then came the chicken strongenoff which was a disappointment. It was very watery in its texture and chicken strips were a little under cooked too. Halfway in my meal i wished to have thumbsup but they served one after i got over with my meal. I told the f&b personnel to cancel it. I was paranoid by then.

Giving it a thought why is the service sequence so poor i noticed a bunch of bloggers/reviewers (15-20 prople) of them sitting infront of me and they were attended pretty quickly. Okay thats a good way to generate revenues by inviting bloggers /reveiwers but simultaneously one needs to focus on the regular walk in guests also. Remember "todays big foodie will be tommorow's connoisseurs".

Ordered for dessert chocolate sphere which was very unique. It tasted good hence which pulls up the rating from 2.0 to 2.5.

Now another weired thing which happened yesterday was that they CHARGED me 360 bugs for ratatouille which is printed 195 on the menu card.i realised it now when i was going through the menu here on zomato. Have posted the picture of the bill and menu for further clarification.

The conclusion of the restaurant is -
1)Great decor
2) Average food
3)pathetically slow service
4)minuscule portion size
5)wrong billing

All in all i blew up some 2100 bugs in one and a half hours. Not recommended as it is not value for money.

Location - Opposite lane from Basanti Devi College. Walk towards Azad Hind, you will find the place onthe left. Its a min walk from Azad hind.

Ambience - Wonderful Ambience with creative phito arts hanging and blocked up nicely. The Restaurant has sufficient seatings.

Food -
Virgin Mojito - Loved it. Just the way it should be, nothing extra and nothing less. Accurate.

Banana Caramel- Not a big fan, but yes the concept of banana and caramel is something amazing.

Starters -
Beer Braised Pork Ribs with Barbeque Glaze -
One of thr favorites dish of the evening. The pork was so soft and delicious. I completely loved the pork.

Chicken Ossubuco-
Braised legs with caramelized Onion compote. The combination of caramelize onion compote was wonderful.

Main course :

Chicken Parmigiana with country fried potato and roasted vegetables-
Baked chicken breast with Mozarella and Parmesan Chesse and served with fried potato naf and vegetables. Excellent. Very toothsome and appealing.

Desserts-
Hazelnut IceCream with Chocolate sphere with sauce anglaise, berry gel.

This was the awaiting dish and it wont disappoint. Very appealing and mouth watering.
The caramel sauce melts on the sphere and makes the taste delicious.

Recommended -
Pork Ribs and the Hazelnut IceCream.

Lastly the service,
It was very friendly and attentive.

It was a happy visit and recommended for sure.

Location: Located in Hindustan park,near Azad Hind. 

I went for dinner with a few friends. The Ambience is beautiful and serene. It's a small cafe at first and then a door opens up to their restaurant,which is beautiful. 
We tried the winter menu here. The chef beleives in slow cooking,that makes sure that the meat is tender and packed with flavour to the bone. 
We ate the Chicken ossobuco, Beer braised pork ribs with Barbeque sauce, Bhetki Florentine. 
Beverages: Banana Caramel, Virgin Mojito. 
Dessert: Hazelnut icecream with chocolate sphere, caramel sauce and berry gel. 
I have no complaints with any item and loved every bit of it!

La maison des delices is a cafe located at hindustan park. I was very excited to visit this place ever since i have been seeing some BOOSTED posts on facebook about the high tea platter.

On reaching the restaurant you will see a wonderful facade of this place all bright and it does create a positive statement. The menu has been on display right out side the gate for creating an awarmess about the food they serve.

The moment you enter u see a rectangular lane which has the bakery products on display and some cover layout placed right opposite the bakery counter. Walk further and you will find a gate on the left. Entered the 2nd enclosure and it was just so antique. Really liked the interiors because of the chandeliers and the color tone of the walls(cream).

The restaurant looked busy even though it wasnt a packed house. We were not greeted nor escorted to our table.Eventually I sat in a table for two and the table was too small for my liking. Finally a Food & beverage personnel noticed me only after i raised my hands . The menu had a winter section and normal section which runs round the year.

We ordered for-

1)banana caramel
2)blended mint mocha
3)prawn cutlet
4)ratatouille
5)chicken strogenoff with rice.

Now the taste of blended mint mocha was decent but what i dint like was banana caramel. Honestly it was banana shake with caramel only evident in the glass for designing. Waiting for the starter to come our drinks were long gone before the prawn cutlet made its way to the table. Prawn cutlet was good and was served with a mayonnaise based sauce along side some lettuce. Again starts the waiting game for the main course. Ratatouille came after 15 minutes and it was annoying to wait. The ratatouille looked amazing but on taste it was very mediocre. Lacked the smoothness in the primavera(4 cheese) sauce. Then came the chicken strongenoff which was a disappointment. It was very watery in its texture and chicken strips were a little under cooked too. Halfway in my meal i wished to have thumbsup but they served one after i got over with my meal. I told the f&b personnel to cancel it. I was paranoid by then.

Giving it a thought why is the service sequence so poor i noticed a bunch of bloggers/reviewers (15-20 prople) of them sitting infront of me and they were attended pretty quickly. Okay thats a good way to generate revenues by inviting bloggers /reveiwers but simultaneously one needs to focus on the regular walk in guests also. Remember "todays big foodie will be tommorow's connoisseurs".

Ordered for dessert chocolate sphere which was very unique. It tasted good hence which pulls up the rating from 2.0 to 2.5.

Now another weired thing which happened yesterday was that they CHARGED me 360 bugs for ratatouille which is printed 195 on the menu card.i realised it now when i was going through the menu here on zomato. Have posted the picture of the bill and menu for further clarification.

The conclusion of the restaurant is -
1)Great decor
2) Average food
3)pathetically slow service
4)minuscule portion size
5)wrong billing

All in all i blew up some 2100 bugs in one and a half hours. Not recommended as it is not value for money.

La Maison Des Délice, a restaurant that specializes in slow cooking and serving quality food. I had walked in there with a few of my friends today evening and I was very much taken aback by their decor, ambiance and of course versatile menu.
To set our taste buds on a journey were our Chicken Ossobucko and Beer Braised Pork Ribs with Barbecue Glaze. Our chicken legs were served with a side of caramelized onion compote and vegetable crisps combining to make a delicious tasting dish packed with light flavors.
Our Pork Ribs on the other hand, got a ten on ten from my end. Tender meat with lip smacking barbecue glaze served with oven made corn bread. Delicious!
To wash those things down our throat were our Banana Caramel. A thick shake topped with cherry and banana slice. Fully loaded with banana flavor and is a great choice for those with an extra sweet tooth.
Next came out our main course which was Chicken Parmigiana with Country Fried Potato and Roasted Veggies. I would want to mention that the tomato sauce layered and baked with the cheese made for a brilliant taste. A recommendation goes out for this item!
We had a Virgin Mojito with this. I personally preferred this drink over the shake.
Last main course of the night was Bhetki Florentine. Tastes exactly how it sounds- Bhetki served with creamy spinach and cheese sauce. The sauce really intensifies the flavor and makes the entire dish very delectable.
Last item of the night was our very unique dessert. Hazelnut Ice Cream in a Chocolate Sphere with Sauce Anglaise, Berry Gel. The menu card describes it better than I ever will: "Hazelnut ice cream surrounded by chocolate, revealed by hot caramel, served with dried lemon to relish the sweetness of the berry jam".
With this my dinner came to an end. A few words on the service and the management team. My friends and I were thoroughly taken care of duly on time. Excellent service and a very warm set of staff. Visit La Maison Des Délice to receive a fine dining experience in an affordable price range!

Went with friends here for dinner today. Looks like a quaint bakery from outside , but it's actually a spacious cafe. The Banana shake with caramel sauce and virgin mojito were both good options for drinks. We had chicken ossobuco as starters. It's slow cooked succulent chicken drumsticks along with caramelized onion compote. The onions were my favourite part about the dish. Beer braised pork ribs were tasty and soft,although I would've liked the fat content to be a little less. For main course we had Bhetki Florentine and Chicken Parmagiana. The Bhetki dish scored more points for me because of the fish being very soft. Both these dishes were cooked in two different but tasty sauces which were very flavourful and lifted up the taste of the dishes. The dessert was quite an attraction. Hazelnut ice cream with berry gel,covered by a chocolate dome which is broken by pouring hot caramel sauce over it. It was great in presentation and taste both! Overall, good food along with a cosy ambience and good service. Thumbs up to La Maison Des Delices :-)

Went for a quick meet. The Banana shake with caramel sauce is for banana fans. It truly captures the essence. The chicken obosuco was cooked to tenderness. The accompanying caramelised onions were perfect. Sweet and softened. The beer braised pork chops were a bit too fatty but the taste was good. The star of the day was the dessert. Hazelnut ice cream covered with a chocolate dome which is melted by pouring hot caramel sauce. The ice cream has berry gel below it to balance out the dish perfectly. Must try.

Updating review based on my 2nd visit to this beautiful place.

Had a Banana Caramel. A welcoming change. If you are tired of the same old mocktails, do try this one. It's filling too.
Next, had a Chicken Ossobuco. Basically slow braised chicken legs served with deliciously caramelized onion compote and vegetable crisps. Loved it!

Finally had a Bhetki Florentine. Pan seared bhetki baked with creamy spinach and cheese sauce, served with potato wedges.

Do not miss these items. Happy Dining :)

1st Review : They make beautiful, really beautiful customized cakes!

The entrance has a big counter which will mesmerize you with the display of muffins, cakes, tarts, pastries and so on. Enter the seating area, which is really spacious. Some of you might miss the cozyness though.

The ceiling has chandeliers hanging and the decor is classy. Staff is courteous and warm.

We wanted to avail the special Hi Tea offer but the platter had sausage so we had to opt out.
Ordered :
Green tea with lemon and honey : They serve it with freshly cut lemon and 4 cookies (quite generous I must say). Tea was great. Cookies were good.
Hot Chocolate : Too sweet and the consistency was really thin. Tasted like Milo. Quantity was decent.
Red Velvet Cake : Could have been better. It was okayish.
Banana Caramel Muffin : Best of the lot. Loved it. Re- ordered.

Price: Reasonable.

Recommended!

This is basically a cafe , we went there for a small hangout. So, in this review the items that are covered is very less. Not even enough to decide the cafe is good or not. Nevertheless the review is totally based on the items we took.

Location: 
______________
it's near Hindustan park. We started from the golpark and just followed the Google map. We were there 12 mins by walk.

Decoration:
________________

It's simple. Nothing Extraordinary. But good place to hang around. Though I felt the table are really small.

Food
____________

This is the main highlight of d visit. Though we took just a few items, but each made with pure perfection.

* Fish and chips with tarta. : Excellent one, made with pure bhetki. Just a delight to have.

* Irish coffee: another great.

* Green apple fizz : amazing. Great and refreshing.


Overall a nice experience. But yes would definitely love to visit again to taste the other stuffs.

Service is very good indeed.

Price is in the higher side though. All cost 850 INR.

Hope to visit again in near future. :)

The place is far fancier looking than it serves. We had the high tea where the savouries were average,  the chocolate tart was extremely mediocre, the brownie was dry with a terrible piece of chocolate on top, and there was a hideous strawberry dessert which I did not dare touch. We were not served any water, though to be fair,  the staff was friendly and attentive otherwise. I was actually rather impressed by the menu, and perhaps I ordered all the wrong things, but I really wish Delices would serve food that tastes as good as it looks  and reads - food photography can be rather deceiving folks. But the main reason for the really low rating is ALL of us had terrible stomach aches and acidity after the high tea and stale desserts.

We have been to their patisserie which is cutely decorated. They have many different pastries and nicely done cakes on the display and you can choose from there directly!  
We ordered a chocolate pastry and a pineapple pastry.. both were yummy.. pineapple sponge was a bit salty maybe because of the butter whereas chocolate one was  mouth melting and delicious! Will soon try out their food section .

Located close to Wise Owl cafe.
The ambience is amazing. Good points on that itself. 
We visited this place post lunch, just to fulfil my hot chocolate cravings. 
We had two of them for 80 bucks each.
Firstly, the taste was more like bournvita. Quite watery. I really didn't like it much. Maybe ordering other stuffs some other time would be a better choice. 
Service is good. Staff too 
Price on the higher side..

Yesterday afternoon found a friend and me at this delightful place. We went there specifically for the high tea. Served on a tiered dessert tray in classic china patterns, the food was as delicious as it looked. We went for the veg selection, as I don't like fish and there were tuna tarts in yesterday's non-veg menu. There were little open veg sandwiches made from halved bread rolls with tomato, cucumber and a dollop of mayo. Little tarts piled high with a sweet corn filling were delicious as well. But arancini cigar rolls with a spinach and ricotta filling took the cake. They were absolutely divine. The dessert selection had chocolate tarts, almond tarts and red velvet mini cupcakes, all really delicious, though I felt that the cupcakes might have been a bit more moist. Served with steaming cups of coffee, the whole experience was totally worth it and I look forward to visiting again soon. The only thing I would like to suggest is an interchangeability between the veg and non veg items if necessary, since it is all priced the same.

I still remember: the first picture that came to my mind when I heard the name, La Maison Des Délices, was that of pretty China, steam rising from tea, tiny cupcakes, and bite-size snacks on stands, all arranged elegantly in a beautiful room. Pictures shared by my friends who have visited this bistro and patisserie have magically confirmed that I was right, somehow. Naturally, my surprise knew bounds when came to know about the new High Tea at La Maison Des Délices, Kolkata, launched on 25th November 2016.
                                                                ...

I didn't visit this cafe but my mother picked up lemon tarts and quiches from here. They were both priced at about 70-80 rupees each. 
No exaggeration, it was the best lemon tart I have eaten ever! The pastry was perfectly cooked, the curd filling very tangy and not overly sweet at all! It's everything you look for in a lemon tart. 
The chicken and cheese quiche was divine too. It was more like a tart than a quiche and extremely filling. Absolutely loaded with chicken and generous amounts of cheese. I couldn't quite place the flavour but I think they added some caramelised onions and herbs which added a unique dimension to the pie. 

I was extremely pleased with my experience and hope to try more things off the menu. Albeit expensive, I'll surely make my way back there. Can't wait to try the High Tea!

I came here for some light eat with Anamitraa Chakraborty . Located in the bylanes of Purna Das Road..the decor of the dine-in secruon looks like a beautiful European Bistro.The chandeliers,chairs,curtains with victorian touch, paintings and photographs on the wall..every little details in La Maison Des Délices has touch of sophistication and classy feel.Its ideal to come for a romantic date or quiet time with your close ones.

We ordered a Poulet Et Crème De Champignon and Lemon tart.

•Poulet Et Crème De Champignon-It is basically cream of mushroom soup with chicken in it.Its a classic French soup.It was served here with bread rolls and little dollops of butter which had flavour of onions in them.The moment this hot soup was placed infront of us the aroma was tantalising for our senses.
This was a perfect comfort food.It was thick with rich flavour of mushroom coming out from the broth.The amount of chicken and mushrooms were good.Addition of butter to the soup enhances it's flavour.The bread rolls were great accompaniment to the soup.They tasted absolutely fresh.

•Lemon tart-We wanted a dessert that will be refreshing.So instead of going for chocolate based desserts or other pastries we chose this from the patisserie.The size was small compared to its price tag.But it was a very good dessert.It acted as a beautiful palate cleanser.The shortbread crust was flaky and buttery.The lemon curd filling was so creamy and had a perfect balance of sweet and tangy.I don't like lemon based desserts in most places because it can be overly tangy.Here the flavour of lemon came well from the curd without being too overpowering.

The service was efficient.The only negative was that the place is a bit overpriced.Otherwise it's amazing in terms of ambience and food.

​La Maison Des Dèlices – Pâtisserie and Bistro is one of the finest European style cafe in the city of joy ! A breakfast or some snacking at the patisserie or a lunch or dinner at the dinning section inside is sure to give you both visual pleasure as well as a taste of exoticness. The sort of ambience this place holds can definitely be found nowhere in Kolkata. I was invited here for a bloggers meet over the launch of Hi–Tea ! Let’s go into details.

They served 6, savoury treats and 6 sweet treats , which included baked beans in a cup, mushroom with olives on bread, veg croquettes, brownies, almond tart and strawberry pastry. All were delicious. The décor is good too , quite spacious.. they had quite a good selection of cakes out front as well.

It was a quite evening when my friend and me were walking past the lane of Hindustan Park & we came across this French Bakery .... Looks tempting from the name itself, which was initially even difficult to pronounce :D
Coming to the review, it's an awesome place to visit :)
Since we visited between 3-7pm we had the chance to get the offer of High Tea which they are presently serving ..Amazing interiors, Amazing Staff, Amazing courtesy and warm welcome and so it their food.
The strawberry cube was delicious, something to die for which was a blend of soft sponge, strawberry cream, a layer of jelly and a bite of dark chocolate which satisfies the pallette , the chocolate and almond tarts were droolicious
The savouries were good too ..
Being a coffee fan and having tried a few coffee outlets of Kolkata, I felt this serves the best coffee :)
A must visit place.
Although expensive to the pockets, but the ambience and gesture you receive is something I would always return to this place for.
Flawless resto with unbeatable taste satisfying capacity :)

Came to know about this place through a friend,decided to visit. It was not difficult to locate it.They had a cake shop at the entrance.The ambience of the dining area was very impressive. We ordered virgin mojito,blue hawaiaan, charmoulla grilled bhetki and lasagne with minced mutton.The fish was very delicious and well cooked. But the  lasagne has some ingredient which made it bit bitter. For dessert we had emrati and chocolate tart and it was pretty good.The bill amount was around 1600rs. I would surely like to visit again and try out more dishes.

I have had its cakes and pastries only and may I say they were delicious. And the cherry on top was the presentation. This place has taken cake decorations to an art form and in a very sophisticated way. Never done over the top. I have never eaten in its bistro, which calls me every time I step into the shop, I shall soon visit it! 
This is a special annotation. This place gives a whooping 30% discount on pastries after 9pm. So that ensures one thing atleast that the very next day the pastries are all freshly made... No leftovers here!

This is the second time I went there. I went with one other friend because I've been telling them a lot about Délices and their food, especially my favourite--- desserts. So we primarily went for the Mud Cake on the day before yesterday. I'm head over heels about this particular dessert. This one is surely a paradise for chocolate lovers. I've noticed this time they have even added a chocolaty n chewy rose and petals to the dessert as a food prop which is edible. The oomph factor of the dessert has definitely increased with this prop added. I love the gold glitter used in the mud cake. So gorgeous! As far as the ambience of the restaurant is concerned it is as brilliant and cute and pretty as always. The waiters were on their toes all the time. They refilled our glasses with water soon after we finished them. Overall it's always a wonderful experience to visit Délices and have good food. I was even happier to know my friend was equally impressed by it all. Yay!

I have visited this place multiple times for lazy Sunday afternoon dates with my bf. But I cannot judge a place, just based on their coffee right? So, I went for a lunch a few days back.
The place has an amazing decor and ambiance. It is not overdone, but you will definitely notice the pictures in the wall, the music playing, the overall calm and quietness the place maintains. It is a good option for a date day with your special someone. Also you can book a large table and have a good time with your family. 
The waiters and very helpful and helps you to place the order. The service is a little slow even when it is not crowded, but it is not something to complain about. You can even see the kitchen counter from the seating area and you won't definitely complain about the cleanliness that they maintain.
Coming to the food,
We ordered the mushroom soup with chicken first. It is a thick, warm soup that will fill your tummy and soul. An amazing way to start your lunch when you are super hungry. Next came the bacon wrapped prawn. It is perfectly done and among all the other places where I have tasted this, this is definitely the best.
For the main course, we had pasta marinara. People loving seafood will love this. It is a little spicy and if you are looking for a cheesy, light pasta, this is not one for you.
I ordered the chocolate fondant with ice cream and lemongrass cream brûlée for dessert. The fondant, ice cream combination and deadly and everyone will love it for sure. The brûlée is not a very common dessert. It is not very sweet, so everyone may not love it.
Overall, I loved the experience. Will recommend this place to all.

Been to this lovely fresh place on Durga Nabami and was delighted with my experiences...

It looks small from outside but they have a good ample space inside to sit and dine...

Fresh decors with some lovely paintings and chandeliers and designed curtains...

Just loved their Kolkata Bhetki with Sauted Veggies and Kolkata Bhetki in Spinach Cheese Melt accompanied by Bread Rolls (complimentory) & Fresh Lime Soda...And both the items will melt in your mouth...Looking forward trying out Salads and Pizzas someday soon..

Unfortunately as we were full hence didn't try out their pastries which looked yum and surely will be visiting again...

They have some lovely courteous staff who gives you a prompt service...

Keep up the good work...

It's one place I found good food during the Puja. Location is perfect. As to cater the Puja crowd they had arranged for a make shift stall just outside their shop. They were selling very few food items in this stall like fish fingers, chicken fingers, cutlets etc. We have old and golden fish fry and the humble chicken cutlet. It's was too good with they prepared in front of us. So its hot and yum. I just love there confectionery section which was even better. Chocolate mud cake, muffins and lemon tart were awesome.

Visited this restaurant today to try out some evening snacks. Ordered prawn wrapped in bacon and the tiger prawn (chingri cutlet) - excellent taste. Enjoyed the flaky chunks of tiger prawns with some fresh cilantro  wrapped in bread crumbs and deep fried - believe the best prawn cutlet i had served with fresh tartar sauce. Not only that i love the hot mini bread rolls served freshed from bakery with butter.
The ambience portrays blend of amazing french culture in terms of furnishings and litted up chandeliers hanging from ceiling, along with the large wall paintings from bengal.  Very experienced and disciplined staffs.

'La Maison Des Délices' is located at Keyatala Road near Hindustan Park,Gariahat.I've been there once with my lover few months back.First of all they have two sections,one is just pastry section & other section is a fine dining restaurant.Ambience is well decorated,Nice wall painting is hanging on the wall.I've tasted here Chicken Cutlet as a starter,It is tasty,two pieces soft & crunchy Chicken cutlet served with french fries & a flavourful dip.Then we ordered Blue Hawaiian & Hot Chocolate with Chocolate Truffle as beverages.Blue Hawaiian is tasty but Hot Chocolate with Chocolate Truffle tastes like bournvita.Atlast we've tasted here Chocolate Truffle Cake as a dessert,it is superb.overall nice experience.Food service is little late.Staffs are polite & well behaved.Price is little expensive.

The rating ranks highest since it made the first impression marvellously; and as they say the first impression makes a lasting impression. The decor simply stole my heart. Done up in a French country style the interiors set a very romantic backdrop for the heart warming food the place serves.  We tried the non beg soup pf the day followed by chicken stroganoff and mutton bourguignon. The food made us happy.

This is a live review.

This restaurant has gone really down on quality and hygiene.
It's unexpected from such places that you find hair coming out of the mutton patty of the sizzler dish.
The bolognese was sweet as sugar.

The food was ridiculous and a waste of money. Hair in your food!!??

Had coffee there - it was excellent! The decor of the place is very "retro" - I think they've tried to recreate a 40s or 50s atmosphere, which I've only seen in movies, and I liked it. The furniture is wrought-iron and there was soft jazzy type of music playing, which, as I said, was nice. However, even though it's supposed to be "old world charm", I saw an internet router, so looks like they have Wifi - I didn't personally have the chance to use it, but nice to know the place isn't *actually* old, it lives in the 2010s as well :) Staff was nice as well. Overall good experience :)

Lovely Deli... walk by the place and the beautiful display would make you walk in just to check it out... you feel it is just a bakery... but a walk inside makes u feel you have entered a different world all together.... along with the staff being superbly well spoken n helpful.... The cakes are to die for.... Had ordered a crème of chicken soup which turned up pretty good with the freshly baked breads.... An open kitchen is another highlight of the place.... The food am sure is pretty awesome keeping in mind the bites I managed till I encountered a hair problem.... Every time they replaced the dish I found a tiny strand of hair that had landed up into my plate or dish.... The management was extremely generous in waving off the entire bill amount.... Yet I feel it was an unlucky experience.... Would like to go back again for a better experience.... N just one suggestion please do change the cutlery you are serving food in... It brings the standard of the restaurant if they are not as polished and beautiful as ur display....

My sister and I headed here on a quiet rainy Saturday afternoon for a belated birthday lunch. We loved the decor though the Indian prints on the walls clashed a bit with the Parisian theme and soft jazz music. We ordered the chicken and mushroom soup which was delicious and heart-warming....just right for a rainy day lunch. It came with a platter of bread rolls and butter so we were happy. We wanted something crispy so we asked for the Chicken Cutlet which comes with fries, tartare sauce and two thin but big pieces of cutlet per plate. This is quite filling and tasty. Last but the best dish was the Chicken Fricasee...a stew of chicken, mushrooms and veg in a cheesey white wine gravy...served with rice. The balance of flavours was just right and we enjoyed our meal thoroughly. Packed some tarts as dessert for home.

Well you always not be lucky and had a great food in excellent ambiance with no other customer.... I was lucky today..

La Maison Des Délices is situated to the opposite lane of Azad Hind Dhaba.
There was no big gate, advertisement or any other banner to attract you but dont look any other thing just go in it..

Well we were early on 11 am and we waited for 33 mins and finally entered in the La Maison Délices.

Flooring to Lighting, furniture to painting everything was great. Very nicely decorated. The visible kitchen concept was very good.

We ordered KitKat shake and strawberry shake first. Both shake were extremely good.

Then we tried chicken salad with Caesar dressing. It was one of the best Caesar salad I had after Café Pranah.

Then we ordered Bacon Wrapped prawn.
I was little worried because my earlier bacon wrapped prawn experience was too bad on Hungry tide. But in here I literally emptied the plate within 10 mins.

After that Ravioli De spinaci pasta was just not good in terms of taste, spoiled our mood. It was too sweet and tomato flavour was overloaded.

Service was very good.Everyone should try here.....

This place is great for a lunch date or a romantic dinner. We went for lunch at this beautiful place and immediately realized that we had made a great decision. The shop is very easy to locate in Hindustan Park.  It is a Patisserie with an eatery inside. After figuring that out we went in to find a very beautiful decor and a brightly lit dining dining area. Now coming to the details.

Food:  The food was amazing. I had high expectations from La Maison due to high ratings here, and I was not disappointed. We started off with a Cream Of Chicken soup, which was very satisfying and tasty.  We also had a sizzler with all type of meats viz. chicken, mutton, pork, beef. The sizzler was amazing and I recommend it to those who like to eat a lot like me. We then ordered the Lasagne. It was beautifully cooked, some might find it to be a little spicy but it was fine with me. The dessert was also very nice. 

Ambiance: The ambiance of this place is their USP no doubt.  The decor is absolutely gorgeous! The lighting is bright but also kind of soothing to the eye.  

Service: The service was very prompt. The staff were very polite. Adding  this to the charm of the place, you would want to visit again and again ! 

The experience was very nice and I would recommend this place to anyone who want a place to go to for a romantic date.

Went in with a lot of expectation but didn't turn out that well...pasta was thoroughly undercooked...mutton dish was also really not satisfactory...however orange blast with herbs and tobasco kick saved the trip atleast...certainly very costly compared to the quality of food served....hope they would improve eventually...

From the moment you step inside this patisserie you will immediately fall in love with it! It reminds you of the little European cafes you see in movies where the gentleman proposes his lady love! That's just perfect! The chocolate pyramid was heavenly and I had my eyes on the red velvet but that already belonged to someone else . It has decors of kitchen items sticking to the wall and the music will keep u happy and upbeat! Over all a must visit specially for all u ladies to catch up with your girls over a bit of cupcake!

Location: Go straight from Bliss and it shall fall on your list left.

Service: They have an eatery right behind so service lags and is not very prompt.

Ambience: Pretty decor, very tastefully and aesthetically done. Well lit and quiet spacious.

Food: The desserts pack a punch. They are light and airy and melt in the mouth stuff. Red velvet being the easy champion. I tried the pineapple cream and chocolate pyramid and both were delicious.

The best Deli I have been in Kolkata. The Lasagne was delicious. The pizza was crunchy and crispy in the crust but soft on the top, with no sign of oil. The drinks were also very refreshing. One of the best place to escape from the hustle bustle of the city.  As it was my Birthday the Chef gave me two pastries which were also very soft and tasty.

Suggested by a friend, i visited their outlet after having a sumptuous dinner just to satisfy my sweet tooth. The interiors is very classy and the combination of lamps and tables gives a very elegant feel. They have their restaurant inside while the way leading up to it houses the bakery. 

I ordered for a portion of my all time favourite Lemon Tart, Red Velvet Cake and Chocolate Truffle. The Lemon tart was very nice. I specially loved the white chocolate stick at the top. Now coming to the Red Velvet cake, words can dry out in its appreciation. Such delicate and spongy in nature, it was an absolute delight. A MUST MUST try. The pricing may seem a bit steep but it is ok considering the taste and quality.
Eagerly looking forward to visit them again to try their main course.

Have been to this restaurant recently after seeing your delicious pictures on Facebook. At first I thought it to be a confectionery shop, but to my surprise the seating place is huge and the ambience is authentic German with soulful music going on. I tried your Coq Au Cremant and trust me the food was delicious. This is my first review on zomato coz your delicious food compelled me to write it! I will definitely give a next visit very soon to try your other delicacies. Even this soaring mercury wont bother me to hop into your restaurant and bite on other delicacies. Delices, all I want to say is you are now at the top of my favourite restaurant list.

I've eaten here a few times now. I had heard that the deserts were disappointing. But tucked away inside what looks like a cafe, is a lovely little restaurant. I love seafood, thus keep ordering the seafood risotto every time, its excellent, reminds me of the quality of food when Spaghetti Kitchen (sadly closed now) started. We also ordered Mediterranean lamb kebabs, the yogurt dressing was light and creamy. Our mains included lamb steak with mushroom and wine sauce, it was a total melt in your mouth experience. We also ordered chicken in a cream and bacon sauce. The chicken was perfectly cooked. So used to dry chicken that this was lovely.
Highly recommend trying it out.
Prices are a bit steep. Service and cleanliness could use a bit more attention.

The southern avenue side is mining quite some curious places-steak factory,blue door,cloakroom and now,des delices.For anyone caught up in the maze,ny advice would be simple-you find cloakroom,you find des delices.The restaurant has a cute little cake shop at its entrance.The interior is simple but brightly lit and spacious-the tables are spread evenly out to give you some good legspace.We ordered a chocolate monk and a brownie blended coffee.While the latter had sounded better in my head,the former turned out to be better-with its honey base.Both,however,look delicious and provide ample chocolatiness-so both are good to go.Next up was la cuisson parfrait baked bhetki,which was the showstopper for the day.The bhetki is made rare, succulent and comes with a good garnishing,and accompanied by veggies and mashed potato.It's good enough for two if you haven't skipped breakfast,or say,ran a mile around rabindra sarovar.lastly,we ordered pancake with maple syrup and strawberry add-on.The add on proved to be unnecessary as they provide good enough butter and maple syrup for two pieces.The pancake wasn't the best I've had-that has to be at biker's cafe.Then there is DIET-did i eat that(yeah,that's the name of a restaurant,and it's in kolkata),and so on..point being the pancake is ok-ish.Other than the fish,the rest seem value for money.On the whole,a place worth visiting.

ANUPAM ROY'S PLEASANT SURPRISE VISIT !!! 
My family thought of an unusual lunch for Bengali New Year 1423 and that led us through the decorated shop dotted streets of Gariahat to finally reach this patisserie cum restaurant. To admit, firstly, the decor has an European feel with wrought iron dining sets but at the same time, it seems confused because of the wall pictures having no coordination to the proposed and supposed French feel that the restaurant dares to offer. Coming to the menu, the capsule recipes tagged to every dish name unfortunately comes to a closure with a disappointing execution that compromises with what it promises.
The fish and chips with tartar dip was good that raised our expectation towards the quality of main courses that we had ordered - Chicken Tetrazinni, Tavuk Biftek and Brochette De Poulet- only to be morosed at the lack of authenticity.
The third dish was supposed to have ratatouille and pilaf rice as accompaniment but they somehow turned it into a cheap saucy sizzler.
To add to our food frustration, the service was also average.
We could finally realise that perhaps we had high expectations from the place and should have been there for simple mocktails as the singer/composer Anupam Roy ordered for his friends when he suddenly turned up there during our lunch.
Overall, French feeling was lost and so was our wallet balance. We wished we had stuck to the conventional practice of Bengali Lunch on Noboborsho.

A restaurant with excellent food, nice ambience and decor but very POOR SERVICE.

We first visited this restaurant last weekend and because of the excellent food decided to go again this weekend.

However the bad service left a bitter taste in the mouth even after such good food.

We were the first to arrive today afternoon and subsequently only two more tables were taken up while we were there ( total 9 diners). But in spite of only 3 tables being occupied including ours the waiters were totally wanting in their service. They were totally focused on a table with a group of 4 young girls and it was very difficult to catch their eye if we required some service.

FORGET ABOUT THEIR ENQUIRING ON THEIR OWN IF WE REQUIRED ANYTHING.

They had to be called for all services including clearing up the plates after any course during the meal. It felt as if they were doing us a favour by bringing us the food after which it seemed that to them we did not matter.

I have never had this unpleasant experience in any restaurant.

This completely spoilt the mood of the dining out expereince for us today and left a bitter taste in the mouth inspite of the good food.

I even asked for a Feedback Form and mentioned about this poor service in the form. I wonder whether the form reached the management.

Due to the quality of food I had intended to try out various preparations over a period of time but the poor service has made me decide to not visit again.

It is the Morning After effect that takes the cake : Between frequent visits to the Hot Seat, I write this, so the review is at least fresher than the prawns we were served at La Maison Des Delices for a Double Birthday Dinner we had last night.

As soon as we entered the Grand Parlour like Delices, even at 9 last night, it felt distinctly uncomfortable owing to poor airconditioning there. At 40 degrees or thereabouts, ACs ought to have been made to work more efficiently, as warm glow from the Chandeliers and Wall Sconces alone doth not a La Maison make. Bickram Ghosh and his wife would agree, as waiters were found fiddling with this and that on their AC Remotes, with little or no effect to cool them down.

Or was it a case of heat escaping their Live Show Kitchen, cooking furiously for the celebrity guests to be served out of turn, while lesser mortals helplessly perspired ? The celebrities walked in at least twenty minutes after seven of us did, were attended to by the obliging Chef on all limbs, served their orders promptly and even finished their dinner, while only a Bread Basket came to our table just before they were about to leave. We didn't mind waiting for worthy food to follow.

The bread basket held warmed dinner rolls, butter served alongside that was spreadable, but less than a finger's width of some truly rancid olive oil in a bottle and some residual balsamic vinegar in another that tasted stranger than the looks on the waiter's face when we asked them to bring some. There was no reason for them to be in such hurry either, in their attempts to remove the pots of oregano and chilli flakes, while they'd paced about our table like fierce invigilators in an examination hall, minding every pouring and shaking we did. They had no worries of course with the tall wooden Pepper Mill, as it just creaked and squeaked, but produced only faint dusts as it had little Black Pepper Berries to crush within it.

When the orders started trickling in two and threes and not together even after we were made to it at the table for more than an hour, it annoyed us quite a bit. We were told the two Baked Prawns were in the oven and would take just five more minutes to be served. That too would have been fine, but then the Chef appeared with my Mixed Grill Sizzler, placed it quite ceremoniously before me and rather dumbly suggested why don't we start ? It was absolutely unthinkable for us to do so before the two ladies at the table were still to be served their food but why such an outrageous advice ?

My brother-in-law from New York City knows his seafood and wanted to be sure if he should have squid just a day before he flies back. The waiter appeared quite uninformed and insisted the squids were fresh. Not one to stop quizzing, he asked which shore could be the nearest source for such fresh squids ! He was finally told by the Chef that though the squids come frozen as it does in most other restaurants, he could safely order his Spaghetti Marinara. He requested the Chef to make it spicier than is usually served here but managed to finish only half the bowl as he plainly said he did not find the sauce to his liking. He picked up all the morsels of seafood from the bowl, though he was rather surprised to find no grated Parmesan and squids tasted fresher than prawns, but it was fish that was the freshest of all in his Marinara.

Likewise for my son, whose Grilled Bekti in Lemon Butter Sauce was just superbly fresh and perfectly grilled, with a crust of herb sitting pretty on top. My sister-in-law's Creamy Wine and Bacon Sauce was quite satisfying to go with the Chicken and Herbed Rice as well and another lady too found her Fish and Spinach dish palatable enough to finish them rather quickly and completely. So three dishes out of seven passed the muster while they forgot to serve drinks ordered.

My wife now complains of crunching pain in her lower abdomen without exchanging notes yet on the health of our other lady guest who ordered the same item. We must hope she has somehow survived her Baked Prawn & Mushroom.
As soon as their Baked Prawn Casseroles came to the table, all of us squirmed slightly at the not very strong but all too unmistakably offensive smell of prawns that were far from fresh. But for them it was just the smell then, as the prawns, though small, tasted unsuspectingly benign and were served aplenty as each spoonful of sauce held one or two of them.

Ever the chivalrous, I come to my order last : the two ladies needed to be served their Baked Prawns before any of us could even start thinking of eating. I had to wait out for my Mixed Grill to completely stop its sizzling which steals much of its fun quotient. The lone slice of Ham was the thickness of a Sterling Pound when I expected at least a nice Ham Steak, even if not a very thick one. The two rashers of Back Bacon buckled up while grilling, there is an easy trick to avoid it, but were quite full of flavor nonetheless. Chicken Supreme was tender and moist enough to absorb and hold some brown sauce served alongside. It was of course the minced Mutton Patty that stole the show with its being a true blue Flavour Bomb really, and was grilled and coloured so perfectly that I didn't require the Steak Knife they helpfully provided without having to ask for it. The pair of Sausages could do with a few more minutes of being rolled on the hot grill but was not found wanting in any sense. So was the creamy and buttery Mash, in fact a very good one I had here, topped with a fresh sprig of Persley. The Sunny Side Up had a just set yolk and crisper white bottom just as I like them.

Only the Grilled Prawns proved to be the real troublemaker that are still sizzling within long after the Sizzler has stopped its own. The three were of such different sizes that one could fit within the other and then another likewise the way Russian Matryoshka Dolls do. But then again, for me, Size Does Not Matter as long as they were served fresh and juicy. Prawns were entirely lacking in freshness, and having been only grilled, emanated its unique stench that really did add to my punishment of its silent consumption so as not to offend diners at my table as well as other patrons at La Maison. 

I wish my plight ended but there was one more nasty surprise still to be had. As I desperately poured out from the Soup Spoon like Sauce Boat the last traces of brown gravy to camouflage the offending smell from the prawns, I came across a feather ! A chicken feather in a Sizzler ! Did it not burn away at the Griller or on the Hot Sizzler Plate, like the Cabbage Shreds so onviously did ? It came last, to actually haunt me through the night, more than the stale prawns probably did and I alternated between Alkaseltzer and Pudin Hara Softules before this nightmarish upset just gripped my stomach.

It was my birthday yesterday and the Delices had very touchingly set two candles alight on one of the best Chocolate Cakes to be had in Calcutta, and brought it to the table,, with my name and that of another lady who shares her birthday with me, which was the most redeeming gesture I would like to remember the evening by, dessert rather than disaster !

While the sprig of fresh parsley looked particularly appealing on the mound of Mash, the chicken feather on the other hand, even of the Downs variety, was not a pretty sight when I discreetly but mischievously hoisted it on the white  handle of the Sauce Boat but I doubt anybody would have even noticed. They were too busy in their colorful Tee Shirts, having hurriedly peeled out, even if their white liveries, as well as the serviettes, were far from neat or crisply starched.

Even if your guest is not found fit to have a feather in his cap, he is better not flattered with an attempt of being offered a feather in his food, even by way of a Birthday Gift. Which decent restaurant would allow in sweepers, with mops and brooms, to start cleaning its chequered floor, late hour notwithstanding, even before the largest table finished dining, despite approaching closing time ? Hygiene not only took a back seat at La Maison, but complete lack of it all too evidently climbed the plate and palate of its patrons last night at La Maison Des Delices. I desperately seek attention.

It is my niece's birthday today. She has been all too eager to enjoy the delicacies at the Delices and actually been looking forward to it for some time past. I am not heartless enough to spoil her fun by cautioning his parents with a narration of our poor experience. My only hope is that they thoroughly enjoy your keen attention and small indulgences and are completely spared tonight any and every plight we had to suffer last night during our Double Birthday Treat.

Nice place to chill in a quaint neighborhood. Food is excellent, ambience is equally good, love the decor with chandeliers n paintings of Kolkata, service is a bit slow, it might take a while for them to prepare n serve you the food after you order. Its a place where you get the traditional authentic french cuisine, and I found it both delicious n healthy. Also, you can sit there for hours without anyone interfering.

The ground floor of. Nice house turned into a watery, tucked away in Purna Das Road. Simple interiors with some nice lighting. The servers greet you with a smile and would serve you well all through. Chef Riju was an extremely good host :) we started our meal with a better than good chicken ceased salad, perfect! For main course it was baked prawns which I lived immensely... The bread rolls with it were nice and soft. A grilled fish, hats of to the quality and taste but a lil low on the quantity I felt. A lamb stew with potatoes and carrot which was amazing again :) we loved our meal there. Would re-visit

Today I was really impressed with Delices. After having a craving for pizza at an odd hour I sceptically dialled Delices to know the procedure to order food via swiggy. I wasn't able to find their name so I recalled them apprehensive whether they would deliver or not. To my surprise they were extremely polite in dealing with me and extremely patiently took my order and address. The person who spoke to us on call said it would take 45mins and it reached in exactly 45mins. They took special efforts to make sure that the pizza remained hot. The mushroom pizza was just too good and I was elated at having such good food that too late at night. I've been here to eat a lot of times and the staff is well mannered and polite too. The food is amazing.  And I love the mudpie. 
Way to go Delices ! Keep it up ! 😊

This place is a beautiful place located in a quaint neighborhood. The décor is fabulous and grand even. The service is also top class. But you have to wait for a long time, really long time to get your food. I had a mushroom soup and a seafood marinara pasta. The soup was really nice, mild yet flavourful. And the spaghetti was nice too. Though I found a hair in it , and they made a new plate of the same thing for me.

Went there specifically to try my favorite dessert creme Brûlée with two of my friends on a lazy afternoon. 
The decor was very spacious and French. 
The server was very warm and welcoming and gave us ample time. 
We were told of an offer for free coffee if we write a poetry, that was unique and we wrote the same and availed the offer. 
We were informed that only one creme Brûlée can be served that was sad cause we went there for just that, my friends sacrificed it for me and it dint even taste like Brûlée in the end.  It was very very sweet, the sweetness eating upto the balance and flavor of the egg yolk. We informed our server the same and he agreed to that. 
Would I come back?  Umm, tough call. Maybe someday if I am in mood for some french main dishes.

This place is located in Hindustan Park, more accurately in Keyatala Lane. 

Once you enter this place, you will feel like you entered a different era. The place is very quaint and a sea change from the loud music cafes which are plenty there.

We had -
Delices classic cold coffee
Milkshake KitKat brownie.
 Stuffed Focaccia Sandwich which had shredded chicken,bell peppers, onion with pesto sauce
The food was very good. Sandwich had the correct mix in it. Tasted awesome. 

The service was also very good as the waiter's were very polite to us and let us sit for a long time instead of shooing us away.

The prices of the dishes are a bit on the higher side.

Overall the food+ambience+service all gets a thumbs up from me.

Its been quite a while I had wrote my last review! Not that I did not want to share my culinary experiences, but I am not a huge fan of writing 2-3 lines reviews, just for the sake of it. And after this prolonged absence. this particular restaurant has just given me enough reasons to get my fingers up rolling and trouble my keyboard once again!

Coming to the location, this is situated in the vicinity of Azad Hind Dhaba, Mrs. Magpie, Cloakroom, .....! That is, if you know either of those restaurants, you can easily reach here. Evidently, having such big hot-shot names breathing down your neck, you gotta do something special to stand out! And I believe, this restaurant has just found the magical formula to stand apart!

So, you need to stand in front of Azad Hind Dhaba at Hindustan Park Road. If you do not know how to reach there, enter the lane opposite to Basanti Devi College and keep walking straight, or come to Gol Park, take the lane beside the petrol pump (Purna Das Road) and keep walking straight. Once you see Azad Hind Dhaba, look diagonally opposite to it. The restaurant showcases its confectioner masterpieces being revealed through the glass panel. You can see all those wonderful designs of cakes. Once you walk in, you can see a nice narrow lane, cutely decked up with small and round tables and chairs with the glass show-case to the left featuring cakes, pastries and puffs/patties'. The prices there are quite reasonable, just a notch high up than Cakes/Cookie Jar.

However, if you feel, the devilish rat inside your tummy tickling you a bit too much, feel free to open the door to your left and enter the culinary dreamland mainly portraying French cuisine. The interior is kind of like a big hall, narrow in width but pretty much big in length. Tables and chairs and placed decently, with one not climbing on to the boundary of the other. If you notice carefully, you can also see the open kitchen with the chefs working right in front of you to treat your taste buds and impart that magical touch to blow you away!

Coming to my order, I had initially ordered for FRICASSEE DE POULET and COQ AU VIN. Not able to resist my hunger, I decided to have a quick bite while my parcel was being prepared. The person attending me suggested for a Club Sandwich. It took a while for the Sandwich to appear. The Sandwich was huge in size being accompanied with crispy Fries and Ketchup. It had 4 double slices of bread, probably cut in half from between. Although I must say, I wasn't impressed the way the contents were arranged. Owing to the huge size, I could have only 1 of those 4 portions at  a time, which meant, either I need to have tomatoes and cucumber with an egg omelette inside the bread, or ham being served with coleslaw tucked inside the bread! Not to mention, the texture of the bread was hard, and it appeared, that the heat had cooled off. Probably they took more time in sorting the fries, making the mistake of grilling the sandwich earlier!

Next in line was a Irish Coffee and a Dutch Chocolate Pastry. The Coffee was absolutely brilliant, just the way it should have been. I had absolutely no problem in sipping it off slowly in my own sweet time. The Pastry was brilliant as well. Rich chocolate texture, not too sweet, had the perfect balance! It was worth the money!

Before I do a sum-up, let me go quickly to my take-away orders! First in line is COQ AU VIN. 2 huge pieces of chicken, grilled to perfection and smothered in a rich, yet smooth pepper-ish gravy (Perhaps tickled with some wine too). They were accompanied with bacon and mushroom. In most cases, I have seen either the chicken being over-grilled at other restaurants, or the inside being too hard in comparison with the other portions. That wasn't the case here though. Other than the fact that the salt content was just a tad bit high up than my liking, it was perhaps the best COQ AU VIN, I had ever tasted.

My last encounter was with FRICASSEE DE POULET and I must say, I had perhaps saved the best for the last. It is a classic French Dish, which was somewhat in between a stew and a broth! Rich, hearty and silky gravy containing chunks of vegetables and pieces of chicken with it, it is hard for me to describe the actual texture for this one! The closest relation I can draw is a taste similar to a soup, yet you were probably thick chicken broth! 

This restaurant has everything a food lover can ask for! Classy and more-than expected ambiance coupled with classic gastronomical treats to satisfy your appetite! If I were to point out some negatives, they would be to improve the serving time. Also, the waiters were mostly busy, not noticing what I wanted to have or desired to ask for! But then, these are little negatives, which can always be worked upon!

I usually do not recommend any restaurant, but if I had to recommend one, out of all the ones I have visited so far, this one would surely top the list! That means, if you (assuming you read this actually) head up tomorrow to this destination, you won't be disappointed with the quality of the food!

Two words : Glorious food !!! 
Breakfast today was a dream thanks to the quality of food served at this place. We had ordered the egg-white omelette and the chicken and cheese croissant. Our server was very courteous and attentive and the food arrived promptly. The omelette was light and fluffy with loads of stuffing and the croissant was heavenly. The menu has quite a few items that I have set my eyes on and I'm certainly going back to this place for more.

Delices has recently modified and added a few new items in their menu, and I checked them out with a bunch of friends. From the prawn cocktails to the mezze platter with crisp falafel and rather lovely tabouleh, to the Chicken topped with bacon and cream which was fantastic, the entire meal was delicious. For dessert, we took two and split, and mine was all chocolate while another friend had a rather lovely lemon tart.
            Edit: I went there again recently, and frankly speaking, the food remains stellar. The Rosemary Mutton Shank from the new menu is amazing.

I am a regular visitor to this place as it's near my office. So the location for me is quite convenient. The decor & ambience of the place is really nice. The food here is amazing. Me and my friends are really fond of its mushroom soup, it's a real delight. Other than this creamy garlic mushroom toast, garlic bread with cheese are too good it's always on our must have list. In short the food is something worth trying. Overall a good satisfactory experience.

The old school look gives it a perfect vintage feel. The chef deserves a special mention as he made sure to serve us with cold mezze (it was so yummmmmmm) even though it wasn't a part of the breakfast menu. It's rare to see such perfectly cooked pita breads that it can form a pocket.
We also ordered mushroom soup (the portion served was more than enough for 2 ppl). It was served with butter and buns (sadly, the buns were little hard....I'm sure it was a sad error which is unlikely to happen at this place).
The creamy garlic mushroom on toast were just as tasty with a perfect amount of garlic, not mild enough that u miss it, neither strong enough to overpower.
Overall, the place is a must visit.

Amazing food. Will remind you of one of those quaint French bistros with its decor and it lives up to it.  The Bruschetta was flavoursome but the bhekti boullablaise stole my heart.  Such finesse and depth of flavours reminded me of great French cooking.  A must visit for every foodie.

This is quaint little place off Hindustan Road with beautiful tiled floors and wrought iron chairs giving out a very European vibe, and why not! It is a French restaurant after all! My friend and I dropped in one day unceremoniously without having even the slightest intention to eat out! We were quite charmed by the cake displays and thought to give this place a try. But those were the days when we were quite naive and didn't know that this was a French restaurant after all so instead of indulging on the assortment of French delicacies on offer, we decided to go for a Pepperoni Pizza! The Pizza was thin-crusted, just the way we liked it but the the topping was a bit too less. However I would reserve my judgement for this particular place till the time I go back and gorge on their Bouillabaisse and cute little tarts!

Ordered online - jumbo prawn Thermidor, prawn cutlets and vegetable florentine. I am floored by the food - tasted authentic and divine. The Thermidor was cooked to perfection - soft and succulent with the right amount of cheesy white sauce - quantity was enormous - 
The vegetable florentine tasted well unlike some places which serve up chopped veggies with some cheese. This tasted appetising and wonderful. 
Prawn cutlets were full of prawn fillings, the accompanying lettuce salad with feta cheese was just right - with the right amount of dressing. 
The mustard mayonnaise tasted divine and tasted as good as the cutlets.
The buns were toasted lightly and brushed with butter. Tasted yummy
In short fantastic feast 
Such a wonderful contrast to the horrible food from Edesia a few days back. Delivery service person was also impeccable.

Amazing food. Will remind you of one of those quaint French bistros with its decor and it lives up to it.  The Bruschetta was flavoursome but the bhekti boullablaise stole my heart.  Such finesse and depth of flavours reminded me of great French cooking.  A must visit for every foodie.

This is quaint little place off Hindustan Road with beautiful tiled floors and wrought iron chairs giving out a very European vibe, and why not! It is a French restaurant after all! My friend and I dropped in one day unceremoniously without having even the slightest intention to eat out! We were quite charmed by the cake displays and thought to give this place a try. But those were the days when we were quite naive and didn't know that this was a French restaurant after all so instead of indulging on the assortment of French delicacies on offer, we decided to go for a Pepperoni Pizza! The Pizza was thin-crusted, just the way we liked it but the the topping was a bit too less. However I would reserve my judgement for this particular place till the time I go back and gorge on their Bouillabaisse and cute little tarts!

Ordered online - jumbo prawn Thermidor, prawn cutlets and vegetable florentine. I am floored by the food - tasted authentic and divine. The Thermidor was cooked to perfection - soft and succulent with the right amount of cheesy white sauce - quantity was enormous - 
The vegetable florentine tasted well unlike some places which serve up chopped veggies with some cheese. This tasted appetising and wonderful. 
Prawn cutlets were full of prawn fillings, the accompanying lettuce salad with feta cheese was just right - with the right amount of dressing. 
The mustard mayonnaise tasted divine and tasted as good as the cutlets.
The buns were toasted lightly and brushed with butter. Tasted yummy
In short fantastic feast 
Such a wonderful contrast to the horrible food from Edesia a few days back. Delivery service person was also impeccable.

Had little time to go in and take a quick bite. From outside the place will look small  but when you walk inside its actually a pretty big place to sit in. Loved the simple decor done with amazing chandeliers and paintings portraying Kolkata. The place was packed with people. Waiters were courteous. Just tried the pastries and loved them. The menu has a lot to offer. Specially looking forward for the breakfast menu.

Loved the food! This place serves food for the soul. We ordered a few items just to try out the place (having heard about it a lot), and it did not disappoint!

We ordered Calcutta Beckti Fish Fingers with Tartar Sauce, Bacon-wrapped Prawns and Mutton Hamburger Steak in Bacon & Mushroom Sauce. Loved each and every item especially the Mutton Hamburger!

I recommend this place heartily and shall definitely be back for more!

This time when I was in the city, I wanted to try out some of the new places that have popped up across Kolkata. I had been recommended this place by an online acquaintance, and I had bookmarked it after seeing their absolutely brilliant menu. So one afternoon, when the hunger pangs were about to kick in, four of us made it to this quaint, small joint off Purna Das Road. Well, what looked small from outside turned out to be a huge, ornate room with checkered floors, paintings, chandeliers and what not. We settled down and placed our order. What followed was a plethora of proper French cuisine, something that I had been wanting to try for some time - and the food was perfect. Let's take it one by one.

Fricassee de Poulet (served with rice) - One of the French comfort foods, a Fricasse has been described as "halfway between a saute and a stew". It is typically cooked by sauteing the chicken and veggies and then in a white sauce before the meat caramelizes. Our fricassee was smooth as ever, the sauce having both the hint of richness and simplicity. It was loaded with vegetables, and formed a hearty meal.

Bhetki Bouillabaisse (served with parboiled pasta) - A dish hailing from the port of Marseille, this is a stew traditionally made with the bony fishes of Mediterranean and potatoes, tomatoes and other vegetables. It is typically seasoned with fennel, saffron and cayenne peppers. The version we had was a twist in the fact that it used Bhetki and Prawns, but the seasoning was actually as close as it gets to the original. It smelled fishy, and the quality of the meat was awesome, but what we enjoyed the most was sipping on the extremely flavorful and unique soupy broth. The fennel and saffron lent a taste that I have rarely experienced but once you let go of that barrier, it is a heartwarming broth.

Mutton Bourguignon (served with rice) - Another French delicacy originating from the Burgundy region, this is an example of a peasant dish gradually inducted into haute cuisine. Typically made with beef, simmered in red wine and then braised with garlic, pearl onions and mushrooms – this is exactly what we got on our table, made with mutton. The tartness from the wine was delectable and the flavor from the seasonings was superb. I have had this at Gaylord’s, Mumbai, but this was simply one level ahead, a treat for the senses if you are looking for the authentic flavors. Two thumbs up from my side!

Grilled Jumbo Prawns (served with mash and veggies) – After three shots at French cuisine, we ordered this dish, described as the general manager’s special on the menu. And were we thankful! The two grilled jumbo prawns, with a smear and a bowl of a Mandarin Orange and Cilantro Sauce was the best order of the day. The prawn meat was delicious, and the sauce was beyond description. I do not quite have the words to describe the awesomeness, but my palette swears that it will go back and order the same, at least once more. Try the Bourguignon, but do not forget to order this when you are around.

Lemongrass Crème Brûlée – Quite steeply priced for the portion, we decided to sample one of these, so that we were not left with any regrets. And boy, was it good! A base of custard topped with a layer of caramel dust, this was as authentic as it gets. The taste was subtle, not too sweet and filled us with the creamy goodness of custard, leaving behind a tinge of lemongrass happiness.

The meal was extraordinary, much beyond what I had imagined an hour back, and I am definitely going to return to try out some of their other delicacies like the Coq au Vin, the Mutton Hamburger Steak and the Involtini. An experience to treasure.

This adorable and quaint little place is located very close to Golpark and is one of a kind amongst the various restaurants located in that area and it's neighboring area i.e Southern Avenue. The grilled bhetki was cooked to absolute perfection! The fish was still flaky, but light and melt in the mouth like. The veggies had a nice crunch to it which was quite nice. The mashed potatoes were yum and the lemon butter sauce was to die for! The carbonara wasn't too rich and had an amazing balance and consistency. The plating of the food was really really good which made eating here an even better experience. Creme Brulee with lemongrass wasn't a flavor combination that I would ever thought of and it worked so well! It worked as well as music and lyrics! The French apple tart however could have been a little better. For drinks, we had lemon iced tea and a peach iced tea which were both very refreshing! I'll definitely be coming here in the future.

Went there with my elder brother last evening for dinner. La Maison Des Délices is indeed a very good  restaurant in Hindustan park kolkata serving modern and classic french cuisine. French cooking is not fancy or snobby. It’s all about layering flavors, mastering basic techniques, and savoring every bite. As soon you enter you immediately feel in love with the ambience and decor.The biggest surprise was the food. We ordered for a Mutton Bourguignon ( a stew from Burgundy region of France) and the dish was a perfection in itself and the presentation, taste absolutely amazing. We didn't need to add any other condiments to enhance the flavour. Mutton was so tender and well cooked, it took less than 30 seconds to melt in our mouth. The effort and love behind the dish was very evident. Thanks to Chef Riju. and team . All thanks to the super awesome food and service. Service and hospitality at this place deserves a 5 on 5. The staff are very courteous and friendly.

we are happy to drop in here for dinner, although I wouldn't mind fewer people with the same enthusiasm for it. 

Go there and satiate that need for amazing food!!!

Visited La Maison Des Delices last week. This was my second visit and the experience is as good as first time. I really like their interior, everything is done so elegantly. Last time we ordered meat lover's pizza, in mocktail blue lagoon, green apple mojito & in dessert a superb yummy pastry the name I forgot. This time we ordered lasagna with minced mutton and same mocktails.. Lasagna was really good. We thought of having pastry this time too , but as we visited in early evening, we were feeling full after finishing off the lasagna. Good place. Will visit again to try out their other items..

Tucked right behind Southern Ave is this delightful restaurant. Had a club sandwich the first time - it was divine. Trotted off for lunch the following day and immersed myself in the La Cuisson Parfaite of Beckti. Divine. Wanted to ensure that mu friends who came down from Mumbai got a taste of it too - so ordered a takeaway of Jumbo lobster thermodor, coq au vin (chkn braised with bacon, mushroom, wine and garlic), mutton bourguignon - they were made innheaven!! So came back to kolkata yesterday and here for lunch again - Chef Riju recommended the creme of champignon ans the grilled jumbo prawns. This place makes me wonder how often can i make trips to Kolkata just to eat here. Bon apetit!!

This is South Kolkata's answer to Mocambo. Exquisite continental dishes with a french twist. Unless you are ravenously hungry you could share the soup and the main course and feel satiated. We had Poules et Creme de champignon - chicken & mushroom soup with creme. Followed it up withCoq au vin - i.e. Chicken braised with bacon, mushrooms, wine & garlic. Next had a Mixed Grill sizzler - sausage, bacon, ham, mutton patty (terrific!) chicken breast, grilled medium sized prawns with exquisite mashed potatoes. The dishes are simpler to devour than pronounce their names. All this for Rs. 1500/- for 2. Decor and ambience with paintings and artistic photographs on the wall are an added bonus.

Who does not love a cafe or restaurant with delicious food, vintage French music, stunning decor and quality service? Besides food, the ambience, service and background music matter a lot when I visit a restaurant. And I have found these at its supreme state after spending an evening at La Maison Des Dèlices.

The unbelievably good Italian and French food coupled with addictive French vintage music transported me to another world. This beautiful cafe and eatery is a visual delight and allows you to have a good conversation with your special friend. It is a quiet place where you can enjoy the food, the music and the company of your friends. I suggest everyone not to leave the place without having Bailey's Parfait.

Went with my parents on Saturday 25th October. Was handed a "Puja Menu" in spite of the Pujas being over. Since I had heard many good things about this restaurant from Zomato and wanted to try some of the dishes that were not on the Puja menu, I asked if we could order from the regular menu. The waiter handed me the regular menu and went away. We discussed and picked out several dishes we wanted to have. After 10-15 minutes, we were ready to order. Then, the other waiter who came to take our order told us that everything we wanted to order was not available, that the only things that were available were those on the Puja menu.

Few questions:

1. Why are you still serving from an extremely limited and mediocre Puja menu even after the Pujas are over? 

2. Why not give customers the benefit of experiencing your full menu even during the Pujas? Many good restaurants offer both options - some Puja special items but also their regular menu. It feels like the Puja items are ones that have a mass market appeal, can be cooked in advance and can be reheated and served with minimal effort. It does not feel that the Puja menu represents the best of what your kitchen is capable of or what your restaurant is known for. Why show such a mediocre menu to your customers during a time of year when many people are trying new restaurants?

3. Your waiter should be trained enough to inform the customer that items from the regular menu are not available so that we don't waste time browsing the regular menu when nothing on it is actually available. It seems your waiters are lacking in any kind of training or common sense.

We walked in at 9 in the morning looking for a breakfast joint with aaddaa options. Pleasantly surprise by the warmly lit bistro with Chequered floor.  The chandeliers though are distinctly at an odd with the flooring, very made in China if you know what I mean.

The important factor - the food. We ordered Salade aux lardons (poached egg on greens served with bacon), 2 masala omelettes and 1 portion akuri with bacon accompaniment, which sadly was minced and mixed in the akuri. Also Darjeeling tea, pineapple juice, capuccino and an espresso. My friend wowed about his tea, while we had nothing to complain about the others. The juice was canned though.

Now for the service. The beverages were served within 5 to 7 minutes of ordering. The food was quite another story though. They kept arriving at the table one by one, starting with the salad and finishing with the akuri, over a time span of more than 25 minutes. Even the masala omelettes were not served together. One had to knock on the kitchen door to bring up the akuri "tail". So long was the interim wait that the poached egg was congealing, and the omelettes were barely warm. The waiter even offered to warm up the food for us!!!!

The flip side of this was of course that we had an interrupted aadda. Something definitely needs to be done about the service on a very serious note. The person at the billing did profusely apologise, but half the fun of eating together was gone in the wait for all the food to be on the table.

Yesterday
me and my wife visited the place with high expectation. We had prior
reservation and we were seated in a nice comfortable corner. The ambience is
nice without going overboard infact we liked it very much the music was
excellent . The open kitchen and the pizza oven was interesting. 

We were
given the special menu for Delice and we ordered some prawn cocktail and a
salad with feta cheese.. The prawn cocktail was brilliant. The look of dish was
half of the taste. The salad with the fresh cheese was superb. Next for mains
we ordered bacon wrapped prawn with slasa. The crispyness of the bacon and  the
saltiness of the bacon took the dish to a different level. The aromatic salsa was.
The other main was grilled chicken with some pilaf.  The chicken was supper succulent with the
cheese insight. And it was amazing tasting with the green beans and the rice on
the side. Up to this nothing was going wrong and we were full. But the best was
still waiting. For desert we ordered  some
chocolate and it was the best I had in india. It was really the food of God.
The other dessert of chocolate tart was also lip smacking. 
So it was one of the finest European food I ever had and the pricing of Delice
made it doubly special. Look forward for another visit.

What started off as a benchmark in the European cafe scene in Kolkata has turned into a mess...they do not pay any attention to their patrons or take their feedback seriously...
The consistency element is the basis of success for any place and they are miles away from it....the prices that they charge do not justify the substandard stuff served by them... I was a die hard loyalist to this place and now I dnt wish to step back in it post numerous disappointing experiences which were left unheeded by the management...

Visited the place today. Liked the ambience and found the staff quite friendly. Ordered fish fingers and sautéed mushrooms for starters. Found both the items quite delicious but was highly disappointed with Lasagna with minced meat. It was absolutely tasteless. But non-veg Risotto was good. The Virgin Mojito & Banana Caramel Shake were so average that they don't even deserve a mention.
Then again, didn't care much for lemon brûlée but Bailey's Parfait made up for it.
Though it's not a pocket friendly restaurant but would not mind paying another visit .

I have been there quite a few times.The place has a 'paush depressing ' kind of ambience, which is what they might refer as french decor.

I did like the cakes and the sandwiches out side.Can't blame the quality of food served inside either.

So why wont I refer this place to anyone.
Very poor service ( staff here is least bothered to take the orders and they will take ages to make the bill).
The menu is very limited.
Quite expensive for the quality.
I hate the ambience.

I dont want to sound rude but for the amount of money spent Kolkata has better options.

Located in the lane that goes inside, next to Wiseowl on Purna Das Road, this patisserie cum bistro is a beautiful place spend hours. The newly designed white linen seating area is pleasantly bright and white. 

Ordered a Mint Frappe (above average), Delices signature creamy sizzle (above average) and chilly cheese toast (pathetic). So, didnt order any savories. Need another visit soon.

If you like French themed cafes, this one is sure to appeal to you. Go there for a cup of coffee (the mint frappe is quite delightful) or for a complete meal. The seafood risotto there is to die for.

Quite happy with my first visit! :)
We were in this area n happened to notice this place by chance while looking for some other! ;)
It's a sweet little bakery with a restaurant inside!
The interiors are minimalistic but eye catching! :)
Coming to food! We tried their dark truffle pastry which was very decent! Hot chocolate and a cappuccino which were nice too! :):)
A warm place to spend a quiet evening! :)
Looking forward to more such visits and trying more of this pure indulgence! :)

Other folks have commented on the ambience, so I'll leave that alone, except to mention that the cafe is a quiet, peaceful sort of place to share an experience of good food with friends. The service was wonderful and attentive, but not intrusive. They would let us talk with ourselves, but if we needed something, come over immediately. 
Some have mentioned being disappointed with the food, so I was very wary that I was about to spend a lot of money on not-great food, but I was so happily surprisedwhen a friend ordered the broccoli soup, and it came out looking green, fresh, and tasted bright and lovely. Keeping in mind that this is cafe fare, and unless you order a Plat Principal, you should be able to thoroughly enjoy each dish without feeling weighed down. Again, I was almost afraid to try the food here, and was so so pleased, as were my friends- when our fears were unfounded. I got the Pizza Funghi (mushroom pizza), and the mozzarella cheese was perfect, as was the rome-style crust (flatbread-like, not US-ified fast food). My colleagues and I shared two orders of the pommes frites, which were hot, fresh, and crispy with a dash of paprika or chili and a delightful tartar sauce-like herbed mayo.  Both my friends got salads, the greek and the waldorf, which were fresh and authentic, real walnuts and apples in the waldorf, and feta and kalamata olives in the greek. They must import a lot of their ingredients. Someone also ordered the veggies florentine, which was great, veggies, cream, mozzarella cheese, and plenty of bright fresh spinach. Comfort food without being too heavy. I had previously taken away some items from their bakery which were very similar to the sort ofthings available at either The French Loaf or Spencer's Patisserie- and priced similarly- so not fanstastic, but decently good. Their sit-down desserts here though are well-worth it, and amazing. We ordered them all, and the shortbread crust on the apple tart was warmed up and delicious with ice cream, the fondant chocolat with ice cream was rich and perfectly sweet while still being decadent, and the lemongrass creme brulee was refreshingly aromatic for a dessert. The only one I didn't care so much for was the Bailie's parfait, simply because there was a lot of it- and the cream used was oil -based. I suppose if it was switched to a whipped fresh dairy cream I would like it more, but then it would be even MORE decadent than it already was.  If you are looking for a shareable dessert that is kind of American-ish with it's flavours, the Baillies parfait might suit you.  I only removed .5 of a point for the price, which is a little steep, considering that some of the less-expensive items like sandwiches are only available at certain times (they are working on advertising the different times of the menus on Sunday I think). However, the price will not be enough to keep me away. I'd rather just not eat dinner on other days to prepare for really enjoying every experience of a  meal here. I will definitely return to try their Sunday brunch for a different friend's birthday, and am wholeheartedly looking forward to reliving my own first experience by seeing them become as happy and cheerful from the food as I was today.

Right after we got our hands on one of the reviews of La Maison, this restaurant had come into our radar. We were just waiting for a Kolkata trip to visit this restaurant. We liked the hang-out type ambiance in first place, warmth of the stewards not to be forgotten. 
We started with Soupe Cemeuse Au Pou & Bacon wrapped Prawns. The soupe was good & prawn was OK. We had Poissons Cordon Bleu, Mutton Burguignon & Fish Bouillabaisse. All three were mind blowing!! It seemed that the place is a piece of France in the heart of Calcutta!! Icing on the cake was the desert - Lemongrass Creme Brulli. It was awesome & is a must-try for all food lovers.
While we were immersed in French delices, Riju Dey came out to greet us. So nice of him!! We wish to come back for other delices soon....
All the best to La Maison Des Delices....

Located in Hindustan Park..a bit ahead of Azad Hind Dhaba.
Ambience is good and i particularly liked the interior decorations. Makes it a pretty picture :)
Food- Just. Awesome. My companion tried the grilled chicken and i tried the Mutton Bourguignon. The mutton tasted brilliant and was soft and chewy. The gravy was accompanied with rice. The grilled chicken came alongside beautifully made mashed potatoes and a black pepper sauce. 
Overall, a great experience. More visits to come!!!! :D

Yesterday. 30/9/2015, I visited Delices with my daughter. It was my second visit there. We enjoyed some snacks and tea and decided to pack a seafood pizza and a meat lover's pizza home.
Sadly, we found plastic wrapper pieces in the meat lover's pizza. This was totally unexpected from a high end expensive place like Delices. We are extremely disappointed.

I have been to this place quite sometime...but as per my observation they are very good with the bakery side... In terms of food its a bit different if you are coming having a mindset of heavy dinner or lunch.. It's purely a cafe with European touch..Pizza and pastas are authentic in taste a has a flavour of international standards but unfortunately which most of the people in Kolkata might not like.... I really appreciate the concept and specially the see thru kitchen... But in terms of service somewhere they lag a bit.. I would say if you are serving this kind of food then you have to be at par or more than that level in the customer service dept as well. I really enjoy the cakes and pastries here also the coffee as well... But in special occasions the area inside becomes very clumsy and spoils the mood as well... The place is pricy as well which is one of the factor for people to get a bit demotivated.. But bakery products are worth it :)

Visited the place after reading reviews online and as is the case with online reviews it failed to live up to the hype. If you are looking for quantity over quality then this is definitely the place. Soup and sandwich were good and so was the fish and chips. It was the sizzler that let us down. The quantity was far more than what we get at fine dining restaurants these days but sadly the meat was tough. The pocket pinch was 1300 for a meal of two.

We went for lunch this Sunday and we were a bit disappointed with both the food and the service. We were four of us, the Coq au Vin's chicken was tough though the sauce was good, the Meat lovers Pizza was dry. The other two dishes of roast chicken on black pepper sauce and the fish was good and so were the salads. Considering the prices charged one expects top class white linen service and food. I'll think twice before recommending the place or returning a second time

Just around the corner is Mrs. Magpie the ever houseful café ,and while everyone is busy indulging in the glitz and popularity of its,many fail to notice this gem of a place. The tiny chamber overlooking the array of delicacies neatly arranged on the glass shelf is the first thing you come across when you walk through the door. Cute tiny tables await you for a small coffee, chicken quiche and the very appetising, warm coffee almond cake. My least favourite part about this place is the sitting area inside,the curtains are an absolute turnoff, yet i have to say that it's got a certain charm about it. The food is good enough, nothing over the top. My favourites are the crispy chicken cutlet, pasta in pesto sauce and the mushroom involtini.
Never very crowed,quiet and pleasant unlike the other popular eateries around. Deserves a visit.
P.S The customised cakes are to die for.You know where you ought to come knocking at next time your order a cake for your dear ones.

Went to Delices because another nearby cafeteria was full. Now I'm going to be a regular here, or so I've decided. The food is really really good. Please try the Meat Lover's Pizza in particular. It is undoubtedly one of the best I've had. Not overwhelmingly full of cheese or tomato sauce base or toppings, the pizza seems to be perfectly balanced. Otherwise order anything with cheese. You won't be disappointed.

They are simply the best in Kolkata with the taste and the quality of material used for any given preparations. I was going through the reviews and found few unhappy comments. I don’t seem to understand why people are unhappy with silly issues, why can’t they simply talk to the staff and make their experience anywhere better. These are guys are simply in the industry where human resource is a key element and human errors occur and hence could be fixed. 

The big guy on the other side of the wall, Chef Riju Dey is a phenomenal person to chat with and discuss world cuisine, I can’t  imagine the man has such vast ides about food, having being trained in Kolkata. If he is present do take the time to speak with him to share your experience. 

We ordered fish and some mutton stew. Both of them had a great look and feel. They probably have the best pizza in town, tried the chicken mustard flavored pizza.

The music at the background was super it has the mix of today jazz along with the veterans playing some cool  lounge music which created an ambiance which I am not able to describe but make one very happy with the bite of the succulent meat .

I am going to be back again and would like to be again treated like a KING.

This place had been on my list for quite some time now as I read very good reviews on zomato. The ambience here is good and it's one of those places where you can have a conversation over food with light music playing in the background. To begin with we ordered bacon wrapped prawns which I wouldn't say was the best I've ever had but it wasn't all that bad either. The main course we ordered included Chicken Stronganoff, Chicken pesto spaghetti and COQ Au Vin. All three dishes were very well prepared. This place is known for its bakery items is what I learnt but honestly we weren't quite delighted after having some pastries they had to offer. We ordered Pineapple pastry, Black forest pastry and Brownie and all of them were quite average. In fact I'd say the food was better than the bakery items.  Also, I felt the pricing here was a little steep for what they had to offer. 

However. Overall it was a good experience. Its a nice small cosy place where you could hang out with your friends once in a while.

La Maison des delices is located near Hindustan park, quite close to both Mrs. Magpie's and the Wise Owl.

As soon as one steps into this bistro, they are sure to be wooed by the interiors and enthralled by the aroma of the bakery. It is just like a posh English bistro that serves good food at "Desi" prices. And by Desi prices I mean moderate prices.

We had Lemongrass creme brulee, Chocolate Mudpie and Chocolate Monk. Loved each and every item. Especially the creme bruleé which tasted too good. The smooth texture of the cream was perfectly complemented by the crunch of the caramelized sugar.

I loved the food, the ambience and was quite pleased by the hospitality and am looking forward to be here again.

As soon as one steps into this bistro, they are sure to be wooed by the interiors and enthralled by the aroma of the bakery. It is just like a posh English bistro that serves good food at "Desi" prices. And by Desi prices I mean moderate prices.

We had Lemongrass creme brulee, Chocolate Mudpie and Chocolate Monk. Loved each and every item. Especially the creme bruleé which tasted too good. The smooth texture of the cream was perfectly complemented by the crunch of the caramelized sugar.

I loved the food, the ambience and was quite pleased by the hospitality and am looking forward to be here again.

Went here recently for a friends birthday dinner. Absolutely loved the food. The coq au vin was really good and filled me up. The fish cordon bleu was a really good trial and pulled off very well. And the apple pie was to die for! A must come when you're feeling a bit fancy.

The place has a great ambience. Packed off in a quiet lane, the place serves great Italian food. Pasta in pesto sauce was the best I have ever had in the city. Worth trying.

I was with my friend hovering around Hindustan park searching for 'Mrs. Magpie' when we accidentally came across this place. This place is a real beauty.From outside we were impressed with the cakes we could see. We decided to grab something from there. From inside it is very spacious, which was  unnoticable from outside. we had pineapple pastry which was awesome and also chicken salad sandwich with french fries. The food was pretty good and our experience was a good one. The decor and the ambience of the place is delightful. With beautiful paintings,curtains & chandilers & soft music playing in the background. This place is highly recommended for people who love food and like a soothing & calm ambience.

So what are people really raving about this place? 
It looked like a cross breed of a bengali turned french or a french turned bengali themed restaurant. 
We ordered a total vegetarian menu starting with the minestrone, mushroom soup. Both were just ok. I'd skip it next time. 
Then we ordered the focaccia bread with pesto. The overall quality left much to be desired. The pesto was watery and the focaccia came across as a slightly better version of the double pawroti. 
Next was the jacket potato with parmiggiano. This one was alright after a sprinkling of salt n pepper. 
Entrees
Cannelloni was decent. Nothing extra ordinary. 
The only saving grace was the aglio alio. We had to call for a repeat because we really couldnt take a chance with anything else. 
The chocalate fondant was exceptional. Easily one of the best i've had recently. 
I'm sorry guys but this place was on my list for the last 6 months and it broke my heart :(
I mean i desperately wanted it to be good because I had been raving about it to my wife based on the reviews i read here. Wish you guys the best !

This place has a name that is intriguing to non French literates. The decor is beautiful, ambience kept lively with good music back from the 60s. The food tastes good, desserts add a yum touch. The service is worth too. 
Do try.

Came across this place accidentally , while searching for another cafe. Have to admit that this was a pleasant surprise. From the outside, you don't get an idea of the ambience inside. The eye for detail is visible in the decor of the place. It is a bistro , and an elegant one at that. The chandeliers, the iron chairs, the neat tables, drapes, etc go on to show their effort. The food is equally good, with the star of the lot being the desserts. There are just 4 items on the dessert menu, but those 4 are worth it, the highlight being the Bailey's parfait.
Pros:
1. Good quality , tasty food
2. Great decor and ambience
3. Located in a peaceful surrounding with ample parking space. 
Cons :
1. Couldn't find many. One suggestion is they could cut down on the number of tables to make it more spacious.
Must try items :
Everything on the desserts menu, especially the Bailey's parfait, the veg club sandwich, and the pastries

Stumbled upon this place after searching for good French main course for a while. This place looks like a non-descript bistro (more like a brasserie, but, hey, everything European is called a bistro in india) in a nice, cozy, neighborhood. Step inside and you will be seated in a nicely decorated room with chandeliers and wrought iron furniture. Not quite French, but spartan nonetheless - with Jazz music rounding up the ambience.

We started with Poulet Et Crème de Champigonon for the soup. It was a nice, creamy soup with minced bits of chicken and mushroom generously floating around. Had a little raw mushroom smell, and probably could have done better with some lemon zest (or lemon grass) but nice nonetheless.

Then we had Bhetki Bouillabaisse, Mutton Bourguignon, and Coq Au Vin for the main course. The bourguignon was served with buttered rice, Coq au Vin with mashed potatoes and Bouillabaisse with fettuccine pasta. Both the bourguignon and the Coq au Vin had generous amounts of red-wine tang and had the perfect meat to vegetable ratio for a stew. The Bouillabaisse had a very different taste - was buttery and not wine-y and made a stark but nice contrast to the other two dishes. Overall, they all had really great taste, texture and volume.

The sides that the dishes are served with may not be to everybody's taste. I don't like pastas much with sauces with much veggies or meat. So didn't like the pairing of pasta with Bouillabaisse, but the chef is a really cool guy. Just have a chat with him for the sides, I am sure you will get one to your liking.

To sum up, had a great lunch.

Edit #1: On second time, went back for dinner after a gap almost a year. Not only did they hold up their charm, but expanded the menu as well. This time, ordered French Onion Soup followed by Coq Au Crèmant. Glad to see the new offerings are still as exquisitely delightful as the ones before.

Just the perfect place if you want to have some good food in a good ambience. It's a pretty little bistro tucked away inthe lanes of Hindustan Park.  Went there with my aunt and cousin.  I ordered grilled chicken with black mustard sauce. My cousin ordered a risotto. My aunt had steamed fish in mayonnaise. A thin soup was ordered as well. Food was really tasty. The waiter was courteous though the service was a bit slow. The place should be tried at least once if one hasn't been there.

The small but well decorated entrance may let you think that it is a small and cosy cake shop but as you enter you will be delighted to find a well decorated restaurant inside with an AL A CARTE menu from all over the world. The sandwiches and fish preparation (sorry can’t remember the name now) are really good. They proved that they will not compromise in quality and quantity. The best part is the bakery items, the mutton puff and pastries are awesome. The finest pastries I have ever tasted in recent times. Have to go back for those again.

Though I visit this place often as it's very near to my place. The food is okay,but the smoothies are horrible. The place needs to look at hygeine as flies swarming around your food is last thing you need.

I have visited this restaurant yesterday with a friend of mine, so I just have to write a small review about this restaurant. It is located a little far from the main city, i.e golpark but you will immediately notice it. When I first saw it from the outside, I was like, Awww how cute! That's because the outside part has all the confectionary. Now the inner part is where all the people dine. Personally speaking, the service was really nice. The people were nice and the chef themselves came and asked how the food was. Though the food took a little too long to be served but the overall experience was pretty neat. A little expensive, yes, but for a French cuisine it's absolutely fine. I wouldn't mind going there again to have a dinner again with someone special. After all, French people are meant to be romantic, so why not have a romantic dinner as well?

Anyone recall the scene from the movie
Ratatouille, where the illustrious food critic, Anton Ego, is bowled over when
he tries out a dish prepared by the rat-turned-cook, Remy? Do you remember
how his past flashes before his eyes as the nuances of the recipe slowly but
surely penetrate his taste buds and then 'shake him to the core'?! Something
like that happened to me when I tried out the continental selection at La
Maison for the first time, and I have been going back there ever since! I have
had the good fortune of trying out some typical French, Italian and German
gastronomical delights in my little time in Europe...and I have to say, many of
the recipes in La Maison took me back to the places where I had first
tasted them. And that, for me, is the very essence of 'authentic'!



I think I can safely say that everything on the
menu at La Maison is a connoisseur's delight, but where they have really struck
gold is their French selection. I haven't come across too many restaurants
in Kolkata offering traditional French culinary specialities. In
fact, what we have always known as continental food in Kolkata is
mostly Italian cuisine. But not at La Maison! I'm certain La Maison's
French menu will be a novelty for many Kolkata foodies.



So, what do you order once you're there? Try the
Mutton Bourguignon (originally made with beef I think, but mutton works fine),
the age-old Coq au vin, Fricasse de Poulet, Poissons Cordon Bleu (a slight
innovation: it's originally made with chicken, but La Maison maestros have made
it with fish, with an added Bengali touch), the Hamburger Steak, and the
Delices mixed grill (this one's a meat overdose, not for the faint-hearted)!
I'm not a fish aficionado, but the baked fish recipes are apparently very good.
You can, of course, plunge into the pool of well known Italian cuisine as
well, all of which is very satisfying. The Spaghetti Bolognese and the Lasagne
deserve special mention.



Another key element about La Maison is its people.
The staff is very warm and inviting, extremely helpful. The chef will often
step out of his zone and discuss the recipe (or the weather) with you, in true
European fashion! The décor and ambience is bright and austere,
bistro-like - no pretences here - works fine for me. La Maison won't cause a large dent in your pocket either; quite reasonably priced, I would say. The only thing this
place needs now is some wine to go with the fancy food!

 

So, bon appetit!

The restaurant inside is simple and nice,nothing worth mentioning.

Went there to try the pasta on a friend's recommendation.It was great, as was expected,given the price.The quantity was good too.
The hot chocolate wasn't good though.

The menu has a wide range of dishes and I would like to go back again.Both for the restaurant and the bakery. :)

A restaurant as classy as its name! Located in the Keyatala South Kolkata, this restaurant might easily miss your sight as its hidden. 

I am in love with its interiors, location and food. 

As soon as you enter, you spot yellow flowers on every table, a black board with the dinner menu written on it. You enter mini France but just with Indian people surrounding you. 

Delices has an indoor sitting. 

With a wide variety of music being played from Jazz and French songs which I surely didn’t understand, it all adds up to the feel of a sophisticated meal. I would recommend it to all the couples who want to have a romantic and a classy date. 

Staff: 

The staff helped me a lot in deciding the dishes since I was trying French cuisine for the first time. The service was fast and up to the mark. 

Food: 

Fritto Misto (4.5/5):

Again a very popular dish in Delices. This was suggested to me when I asked for a seafood dish. Calamari with sun dried tomatoes, bell peppers, baked potatoes and red sauce was a perfect dish for me! 

Coq Au Vin (4/5):

I will not deny that the chicken looked very weird and was not at all appealing. I was really hoping it to be horrible but turned out to be extremely tasty. Chicken with mash potatoes and mushroom and bacon sauce was like a perfect combination for me.

French Fries (5/5):

I have never eaten such thick French fries. And surprisingly they were very soft as well. Generally thick pieces of French fries turn out to be incompletely fried but these were just perfect. Very filling and accompanies by a tomato sauce and a French dip.

My lunch experience here was truly amazing. No pollution, no noises.. Its like you disconnect from the world for some time.

Surely visiting this place soon for a dinner!

Strongly Recommended!

A small patisserie from the outside but cross into their restaurant, and it is quite a different story. The decor is very simple and aesthetically pleasing. For once, the people know what they are serving. The French onion soup was very nice. We had ordered the club sandwich, spaghetti and crusted chicken with Parmesan. We ordered a variety of food across different genres to check their versatility and they excelled in all of them. A great place with good food and without unnecessary bells and whistles.

Well if you like continental cuisine and want to re-live fond memories of what it was during the Sky room era....do visit the eatery and eat extremely well prepared and definitely well served French, Italian and Mediterranean cuisine. 
From the moment you step inside the property you get this feeling that its a very elegant "khandani" eatery where the management don't believe on compromising.
These days the eatery is opened till 12 at night and I used that to our advantage and landed exactly at 11 at night for a meal. A friend and myself had a long and a hard day and we wanted to eat a good meal. The service staff were extremely courteous and welcomed us whole-heartedly. Not a single time did they made us hurry up as in a lot of other places. 
We ordered a platter of Fritto Miso which was basically seafood fritters served with a garlicy orangish dip. Perfectly coated with a light batter so that we could get the crunch of the batter as well as flesh of the prawns, calamaris and fish. 
My friend ordered a chicken tetrazzini and the it was served with some nice garlic bread. One spoon of the tetrazzini made me really happy. Perfect balance of cheese, pasta, chicken and shredded veggies. The white sauce was also perfect! 
Now its my turn. I had ordered a lamb stew kind of a thing. It was served in a soup bowl. There was a medium portion of herbed rice and around it was succulent lamb chunks with baby potatoes, carrots and whole baby onions swimming in a rich brown gravy. Its was abs brilliant. Extremely well cooked stew thaybwas so wholesome. I almost liked the bowl clean. Both of us very happy with our meals, went on to order our dessert. My friend had a mocha and chocolate pastry and I had a Baileys Parfait. It was to die for. Thought out the meal we were very well looked after. Always attentive but never intrusive. I think the price that I paid for the meal is nothing in comparison to the quantity and quality of the food. Really happy to have LA Maison De  Delices in Calcutta and cooking up a storm like this. Looking forward to more meals like this soon. Team Delices you rock!!!!

A cute little cafe that my aunt took my big Bengali foodie family to and we had a scrumptious lunch. Delices has a wide variety of choice and we enjoyed every dish we ordered. Loved the spaghetti bologoniese, roast chicken and club sandwich. The desserts were brilliant too. The mud pie was so very chocolatey and every item had just the right amount of sweet. So glad my aunt got us here. Absolutely enjoyed my meal. Looking forward to visiting again when I'm in Calcutta.

Rarely does a cafe impress so much as this place in South Kolkata. It is not loud, boisterous and palpably a place for all age group. This is one of my favourite places for Italian and Continental food. The restaurant has amazing ambience. It has a very rich feeling to it and is the best place for a romantic dinner date provided you are in the mood to splurge. I took my cousins from Mumbai today in the afternoon. And now sipping coffee while I write the review.  

The menu is amazing albeit, a little limited in French . The tomato basil soup that they serve is sublime. I am sure people who are not into soups will also love this one. The pizzas are all amazing. Must tries in the pasta section are the gnochhi and ravioli. In fact every dish on the menu is worth trying. Although they have an elaborate menu, they serve all the general dishes like spaghetti aop, penne arrabiata, and the like on request. 

 The mutton French dish was just ‘SICK’ what I meant was that I have never had such a stew in my life time it was just awesome. All the pasta and the pizza ‘s were just fresh and had the real flavour of Parmaseen cheese.

It is a highly recommended place 

The mud cake that they serve here is the best I have tasted in Kolkata.

I also tried there special Irish coffee. It was good but the. Overall the food was really good.. I recommend this place to everyone.

We had the dinner from the French menu, the spread initially seemed too wide, quality wise fresh but and individually tasted wise  remarkable except few. The service really scores high.. we were introduced to the a-la cart section and the staff explained us each section which was very welcoming. We started off with Tomato basil soup, Chicken cream soup, Chicken Ceasar  salad, Baked Fish & VEG salad PIZZA and few other veg salads. The decor of the place was also amazing.
Clearly...tomato soup was one of the best we had and was an umcompared winner to its nonveg counterpart. I found all the food very interesting among the salads which were above  average.
Lamb French stew was great  which we ordered for the second time, the meat was very soft.  Deserts were just great. The international section had Fish in lemon sauce, Cannelloni And a ravioli to die for. We will be back thanks to the team and the chef.

La maison has recently changed their chef and the new guy has made wonders. A friend and me had visited for lunch and had ordered a coq au vin and the baked fish.
The baked fish was nice and flaky and the coq au vin had a nice surprise - instead of bacon it had ham and was wonderful. It was served with garlic bread and mashed potates... the dessert was their version of the classic Creme brulee and the Jupiter. 

The creme bru;ee was different from the last time I remember however as the crust was missing and it had to be sent back. the jupiter was as always AWESOME!! 

They have some issues relating to service and I hope that a place that serves such great food should have to get bad reviews merely because their service doesnt meet expected standards. That is just not  good enough.

A word of advice to the uninitiated.... let the chef choose for you and surprise you... More often than not he does a superlative job!! You feel a bit like Anton Ego when you say... "Surprise me"!! and boy does he......

Conveniently located, this quaint restaurant is area around Lake.  I found the food to be pretty good. I have had a better Spaghetti with Meat sauce and definitely best  version of Garlic Bread here. The place is  moderately  priced & great  ambiance. We had ordered:
1. Focaccia with melted Mozzarella cheese (garlic)  Very Good
2. Pepperoni pizza.  Total Happiness
3. Prosciutto e Funghi pizza
4. Pollo pizza. 
5. Carbonara. 
6. Pasta e polpettine. 
7. Assortment of drinks. 
Every dish was priced at an average of INR 350 /- +. While I have no qualms in paying if the food is worthy of it, however I food was great. While, I'd go back there just for the great food and the ambiance , I  recommend it to all class, sex and everybody I know. I am very happy with the place

This area now has some many choices, however this place I am not talking about it one of the best. We ordered some fish n chips and a French mutton dish. The fish was genuine bhekti i with plenty of finger chips and Tatar sauce , it was friend in good fresh oil the mutton was very soft and the gravy was with plenty of flavor. we enjoyed our meal and it was real value for money. It was a great weekend mean. Love to come back once again. Thanks to all the staff who helped us. I surely recommend the place. Oh I forgot they are now having  a great offer on parties, its 50% of after 9.00 PM every evening.

Needed to buy a cake at the last minute at arnd 9pm... started driving from Ballygunje looking for open bakeries.. n managed to reach this place. But alas.. they were out of stock of black forest cakes. However the baker at the counter was extremely positive and asked me if I could give him approx 45 mins.. he would prepare a fresh black forest!! Talk about being FRRRESH!!

So while I waited.. i decided to try out their resturant section for a quick dinner. Ordered for a cookie shake and grilled calcutta bhetki with sauted veggies. The food was nothing great to talk about. The grilled fish was very high on salt.. and not served with any bread. Finally after two bites had to request the server for slices of bread..to make the dish a bit palatable. Cookie shake was also just about ok. My rating 3/5.

The service was also pretty ordinary. My rating 3/5.

As always... in my other reviews... the perfect ambience of the place was spoilt by  a LOUD FAMILY. Spoilt the entire experience even more. My rating 3.5/5

Coming back to my cake... it was ready in 45 mins as promised! Prompt! We cut tge cake at midnight... taste... AWESOME AND FRESH!! My rating.. 5/5

Would give them another oppurtunity definately.

So this place needs some improvements in its food and also it's cutlery. The insalata de caprese has very little cheese compared to the huge amount of tomatoes. The mushrooms starters need just a little bit more seasoning. The pizza al funghi looks great with cheese melting but the mushrooms are too big compared to what they should be on a pizza. The alio olio is good, no complains.
Now the cutlery. The plates they give are too small to accommodate all your food. And the folks are heavy and the round style of it make them slippery as well.

We have been regularly visiting Delice for the last one year and we are really happy that they have started home delivery, makes our lives a lot easier. 
We do love their pizza and pastas but the grilled fish, prawn cutlet, coq au vin, sandwiches are all worth trying. 

We have regularly ordered birthday cakes from Delice and love their attention to details on each of their cake. 

Their staff is very good but sometimes can be inattentive....

I visited this place with my friend lately.   The order was a little late though,  but the food was amazing. We ordered for morning breakfast, cappuccino and juice.  I think it's a little overpriced  but never the less had a good experience overall. There is just one man serving food and everything. In order to save time he should employ two more waitors atlleast. Make work easier and time consumption would be less.

Very poor service. No one came to offer water or take order for half an hour. Only one family was there for breakfast. They took more than an hour to serve our food. Pathetic service. But the food was good.

We asked for fish and chips and a lamb lasagna. THIS WAS THE WORST LASAGNA I have ever had! It was very, very oily and the minced meat was not cooked well. The layers of the cheese were way too rubbery and not fresh at all. 
The fish and chips and the club sandwich were average with nothing great about them.

Publicity is better than advertisement.Especially if it is the mouth to mouth variety.I heard about this place from a friend today We were contemplating a good place for a leisurely Sunday Brunch when my friend insisted that this will be an ideal place for that.
The looks were promising,the exterior understated,the interiors on a white canvas and the furnitures trying to evoke the feel of a Parisian cafe.The glass wall as of an interactive kitchen add depth and variety to the interiors and an attentive workforce.So far so good.
We asked for Poulet Et Creme De Champignon( a mushroom broth with chicken),Soupe Poulet Et Riz( chicken and rice broth),Bacon wrapped prawns,Calcutta bhetki finger fry,Fritto Misto( seafood dipped in light batter served with cheese paprika sauce),Waldorf salad.
The soups were good,especially the mushroom one,the bacon wrapped prawns were good too,the Fritto Misto was very good,the bhetki finger fry and Waldorf salad were ordinary.
For mains we asked for Delices Chingri Cutlets which were excellent,and pork chops which were a disaster.We had to return the pork chops as they were simply inedible.The chef was kind enough to acknowledge his mistake and sent us a platter of pastries which wer top grade.
Now I got mixed signals from this place.Some items are extremely good and some are extremely bad.No middle path here.Maybe they have one good chef and one bad.Just Joking.They also have to improve serving time.In an almost empty place they took 35 minutes to serve the mains after the starters.But attitude is a winner here.There was no arrogance and a genuine desire to please.So I will give them the benefit of doubt and would go back again someday to reinforce my opinion.Kolkata needs joints like these.

Though few of the previous reviews were discouraging, we decided to give this place a try. Ambience n interior is descent enough, nothing over the top but good enough. We ordered Poulet Et Créme De Champignon - great way to start your lunch, it was tasty and appetising. For main course we ordered Delices Mixed Grill Sizzler and Bhetki Bouillabaisse. Both the dishes were simply yummmmm. In the mixed grill, the mutton patty and the bacon deserves a special mention. The Bhetki Bouillabaisse - french classic with a local Bhetki twist was a pleasant surprise, though a bit more chunks of the fish and prawn would make this dish even more irresistible. The saffron infused citrus butter sauce was to die for. For dessert we ordered an Emrati and a chocolate mud cake - a perfect sweet ending to a delicious n sumptuous meal. All the servers were very courteous, our server Ali did a splendid job, he was very attentive and served us with a smile. Even their Chef Riju was personally taking feedback from the customers which was very nice. Overall, good food, good service, will definitely be coming back to this place.

This is a fancy place in Hindustan Park.. Once during one of the regular evening walks, I passed this shop and being fascinated by their tied cakes with fondant decided to go inside.. Tried one of their chicken pie (I forgot the exact name) and chocolate pie.. And I loved both of them.. Both of them were delicious.. My second time my dad came to home with box full of pastries.. Surely I gained a lot of calories in one night :P but it was worth it completely.. Wishing to visit their restaurant soon.. 
Keep it up! Kudos to the team :)

Finally, decent gourmet comes to Kolkata. Excellently incorporated local, seasonal ingredients like Mango, W'melon in the authentic French/Italian cuisine. Great refreshing Gazpacho to start off with (with watermelon and mint as the surprise "summer" ingredients), the Beetroot pickle salad nicely acidic balanced with Feta cheese- great dish to have alone or accompany your entree. (I did the latter). Becty with a green Olive Tapenade was superbly done. Instead of mash potatoes, Chef Riju changed it to a Herbed, buttered rice on my request. The dip could have been more acidic and tangy. However, Top it up with Fresh Mango Creme Brûlée-- really yum ! .... And all for less than a grand (including Uncle Jaitley's Service Tax!)
Worth it!

For its smallish size and tucked-away location, this little French-styled bistro ostensibly serving gourmet French and Italian cuisine, is quite an impressive destination - particularly for someone like me, who isn’t much into European or continental fare. I visited the place only because a colleague not only highly recommended it but also insisted that I give it a try.

For starters, I wasn’t kicked about the way the place has been designed, but let me not bias you already. If you ask me, the décor is over-the-top, beyond the chequered floor and the wrought iron seating. And they must dispense with all that hideous artwork adorning its walls as innocent ‘hungry’ consumers like me don’t exactly want to stare at the scantily-clad back of an Indian woman when all I’m craving for is food, please. Or is this a misplaced creative strategy to help build one’s appetite? :P

I must also place on record that the name - a lingual mouthful, sounds quite like a gourmet preparation - La Maison Des Délices, Patiserrie & Bistro. *Phew!*

Hesitantly, after having browsed through what looked like a rather comprehensive menu, I ordered the non-vegetarian stuffed focaccia which I dare say, was to die for. (If I am still alive having over-salivated, I promise to return just for this one out-of-the-world discovery).

It had the most amazing pesto mayonnaise-embraced shredded chicken with bell pepper, grilled onion and freshly-ground coarse pepper. Oh, and the fries that partnered this handsome focaccia were perhaps the freshest, firmest fries I have had in a long time. On that note (and in my humble opinion), the quality of the French fries on the side reveals the culinary success of whatever they're accompanying bang-in-the-middle.

The Délices Classic Cold Coffee (just a cold coffee, in plain English) was a rather nice washdown given the weather and our Chocolate Fondant with Ice Cream was the perfect finish to what was a memorable start to my ensuing affair with LMDD.

Now now, isn’t LMDD so much easier to roll off the tongue?

Expenditure/VFM : 1200 for 4 people

Ambience/Service : The entry to the place is small and deceptive which does not give you an idea of its sprawling, spacious interiors. The decor is vintage with an intentional old world charm to it. The checkered black n white marble flooring, the hanging chandeliers and the brocade-like curtains all add to the Victorian feel. All in all, a different set-up for dining in the city and much appreciated.
As for service, I would hope to see some improvement in this regard. The waiters are not too helpful and sparsely available. The beverages we ordered (which were supposed to be served with the meal - we asked for it that way) was served at the end of the meal.

What to Order : Cheese Chicken Croissant, Pancakes.
Food was average (We went for breakfast, so reviewing the breakfast menu). The menu had variety. As the names suggested, a significant French influence could be seen in the menu as well. The breakfast platters were just okay. The bacon strips were crisp and well cooked. The pancakes were the best item in our order. The employees refused to serve Nutella/Chocolate with the Pancakes (even though Nutella was there in the menu with crepes) because Pancakes are served there with strawberry or blueberry jam. Even then, they were soft and delicious. I would like to visit this place the next time for lunch or dinner.

I first visited la maison des delices 10 months ago during a weekend and the place was empty except for us. But still then the food was good and since then because of their good food the popularity of this place increased. I went recently on a Saturday and there was a live bland plying and the place was full and lively. However I felt the music was too loud. So we tried the banana and caramel shake the Oreo shake and both were refreshing. We tried the veg club sandwich and the chicken salad sandwich. We even tried the la cuisson parfait du bhekti, a baked bhetki dish with lemon butter and sautéed vegetables and mashed potatoes. That was really delicious. The dishes being ordered at the other tables were looking delicious as well. I definitely recommend this place.

A very impressive restaurant, 5 minutes off Rashbehari Avenue, Hindustan Park stoppage in Keyatala Road. Good decor, nice ambience, courteous staff and great food. The restaurant offers you a variety of continental dishes. We tried out the Delices Mixed Grill Sizzler and the Fish n Chips. Both the dishes were tasty. The sizzler had 2 chicken sausages, a pretty big mutton patty(it's like a kebab made with minced meat), a few prawns, a chicken steak, salami and bacon served with mashed potato and garlic bread. The chicken steak was a little tough but apart from that, the sizzler tasted really good. The fish n chips included 3 diamond shaped fish fry made with Kolkata Bekti served with finger chips and tartar sauce. The fish was soft and succulent and tasted outstanding.
For dessert we ordered a Mud Cake and a Jupiter. The mud cake was like a mud pie placed on a tart. The Jupiter was like a chocolate mousse. Both tasted really good.
I'm definitely gonna re visit the place to try out other preparations. Cheers!!

A good restaurant. We went there during the Pujas, and just didn't need to wait because it's located at a little interior part from the main traffic. The decor is perfect, gives you the ambience of a French deli, the music played and all. The owner came to receive us at the gate because we couldn't locate the place, hence, called him up. He and his staffs were very courteous, prompt and well behaved. The food served was also very good. Tasted really awesome. They also have a separate bakery from where you can take away cakes, pastries and fresh bakes. Definitely recommended. And what else? Happy Dining! :)

We were searching for a coffee shop near  golpark and zomato came up with this excellent choice. This place is a little gem in the heart of  the city which can transport you any time to the european bistro culture. The interiors are homely and warm with beautiful chandeliers and lucrative wall hangings. We simply ordered our drinks.. Cafe mocha, delices special hot choclate with truffle, and a classic cold coffee,  a chicken tetrazzini and slice of strawberry cake from their bakery. The 1st two drinks were just good.. nothing to write about.. we all disliked the classic cold coffee. Tetrazzini was also just the way it should be. Just that the portion was not generous. And i felt the main courses price are pretty high!!  The strawberry cake was okayish.. not as good to taste as it was to look at.
Just one thing i should mention,  when we pay such premium prices.. we expect some amenities of a fine dining place.  The tables had paper napkeens rather than hand clothes. This can be really improved. Even the promotional pictures provided in zomato shows them!

Though this italian eatery looks quite small from outside, once you enter you find a fairly large restaurant concealed inside. The decor is so very classy with old paintings and beautiful drapes adorning the walls, not to mention the stunning chandeliers. Coupled with the soothing background music, the ambience wins you over. And the food will simply pamper your tastebuds. Both the Stuffed focaccia and brochette de poulet we ordered were exquisite. And one should not miss the French Apple Tart with ice cream,it tastes heavenly. We had also had chocolate evasion from their patisserie which was a mouth full of sinful chocolatey goodness. The ambience and the awesome food will surely have you coming here again and again. Cheers!

Though the cafe looks small from outside, it is quite large inside. This place is at hindustan park, just around the corner of the road, 2mins walking distance from Azad Hind Dhaba there. I've tried the pastries here and without any further discussion I would say this the best place to try desserts in this city. It's worth spending here. You can try the choco tart, choco mocha  and chocolate evasion closing your eyes. The cute signboard outside says that post 9 PM you get 50% off on desserts at  La Maison Des Délices. You can't resist from  visiting.  Keep coming! :)

This restaurant was in my list and there are two reasons for it. Firstly French cuisine and secondly near my home.
Pretty interiors, decorative chandeliers is the first think while entering the restaurant. What disappointed me was the menu. I have always loved French food, I was looking forward to Crepes, French Onion soup, Smoked meat based dishes, Cheese platter. Also the desserts option was very limited considering no eclairs or macaroons.
The food taste wise has room for improvement.
Overall a nice place to hangout and enjoy European cuisine.

I discovered this place on my way to Mrs.magpie. It looks small from outside but trust me it is quite big. The food they provide is very decent. We ordered a club chicken sandwich and a chicken caesar salad. Both of them were good. This place looks like a check board to me (credit goes to my weird imagination). Overall another nice and decent place in that lane. :-)

The City of Joy finally has its small French haven called La Maison Des Délices. Located on the quiet corner of Purna Das Road and Hindustan Park, and primarily a Bistro, one would expect a small café like experience primarily dominated with varied forms of French desserts. However, there is much more to what meets the eye, especially with a name like that. One needs to either toil locating this Narnia or have a hard time pronouncing the name while seeking directions from passer-by’s. It’s a different ball game altogether once you find it and although it looks like a small cozy little café joint on the outside, there’s more to watch out for.

What intrigues a first timer like me is the cute little signboard right outside the door with a Food Quote written with a colorful chalk. One is welcomed with a small coffee shop like ambience at first- the wrought iron chairs and tables, a small counter with confectionary delight and walls adorning 3D paintings- but turn left and be amazed at the space behind the closed doors. The chequered floor, the sofas, the tall portraits and a show kitchen, is what makes eating at Delices an experience in itself.

Primarily a Bistro, i.e. a small restaurant serving moderately priced simple meals in a modest setting, La Maison Des Delices lives up to its purpose.  The menu is elaborate, ensuring the patron is spoilt for choice.  You have a Breakfast spread comprising of a regular spread of Baked Beans on Toast , Pancakes with Maple Syrup, they even serve the traditional Salad Aux Lardons , i.e. a classic French breakfast made with  poached eggs nestled in tender greens and flavorful bacon.  The Entrée’s and Main Course comprise of a variety of Classic French delights like Croque Monsieur, Fricasse De Poulet , Cannelloni Florentine , etc.

Another interesting anecdote here is that you can ask for delights that are beyond the menu pages as well and be rest assured, it will be on your plate. I was delighted to know that Delices has something for the strict dieters like me as Chef Pal brought out The Delices Salad Pizza Parmigiana . How does Salad Pizza be any different one may ask? It has cheese and baked yeast crust right? Wrong. The crust made completely with wheat and brown sugar is baked crispy and khaakra like topped generously with equally tossed vegetables soaked in the goodness of lime juice, herbed spices and a minor drizzle of egg less mayonnaise- a feast fit for a king.

We next ordered Croque Monsieur-  grilled Ham and Cheese Sandwich with Bechamel Sauce that was gulped down in minutes by my friend, so I’m assuming it was delectably good.

Desserts are always synonymous to attaining Nirvana and if the desserts have a French connection, how can one not fall in love? Enter Lemongrass Crème Brulee– a classic French dessert with lemongrass flavored custard topped with a contrasting layer of sweet caramel that stole hearts. The clincher for me was the Bailey’s Parafit - Wallnut Brownie nuggets topped with Bavarian cream dipped generously in Baileys coffee liquor. Have this, and I promise the addiction.

All in all while many complain of the food; I honestly believe if you choose wisely, your experience won't be that bad.

I went there with a friend for breakfast and I found the place to be very very nice. The breakfast set menu.. With the egg and chicken etc was quite adequate and excellent to taste.... The coffee was also very nice
I did not like the seating with the chairs being quite uncomfortable for a place like this... It needs cushioned sofas instead of the wrought iron nonsense..

I want to send out a huge THANK YOU, to the entire team  of La Maison Des Délices for the incredibly amazing work they did by creating the most beautiful and delicious cake that we have ever seen or experienced. It was my parents 41st Marriage Anniversary and I wanted to have a special cake for this special occasion. Had heard a lot about this place so ended up going there with my friend. Since my mom is very fond of eating fish curry and my father is very fond of reading books.I wanted fish and books on top of the cake. To my surprise the cake was exactly made the way I wanted and what I was looking for. 

The cake was magnificent. It was a masterpiece and a true work of art - Tandoori fish, and the Piles of  book. Attention to detail goes beyond expectation. Just amazing. I and my parents were in awe of it. Great look and great taste. It’s not easy to have both in one cake. But the team did it, everyone loved it. Hats off to the entire team of La Maison Des Délices .

A big thanks to the entire team of La Maison Des Délices for making my parents marriage anniversary so special with the cake. The look on my parents  face when they saw the cake was priceless.The cake was very moist and amazingly decorated, and very reasonably priced. I highly recommend La Maison Des Délices to everyone. If you want to try out something different which is new and fresh at the same time yummy this is the place to be. That goes without saying

Went there with family and friends to celebrate my mum's birthday. The place has a welcoming, open feel to it. The kitchen is certainly one of the cleanest I have seen. This was not the first time we were having their food, but we had so far always ordered in. This was the first time we were dining at their restaurant. 

This place's saviour is the food and hence my rating of 3.0. However, the let downs are the drinks and the service. We called for saute`d mushrooms and assorted bruschettas for appetizers. Main course was 2 pizza primaveras, a pesto pasta, mushroom risotto. Apart from the pesto pasta, the rest of it was lip-smacking yum. But oh ! when you pick up your glass to take a sip of whatever drink you asked for, all the yumminess in the mouth disappears. We called for a variety of drinks - peach iced tea, some frappe, fresh lime soda. The peach iced tea was so sweet that I think they forgot to add the tea bit and just gave us peach concentrate with ice. The fresh lime's soda was absolutely flat despite requesting them to open a new bottle of soda. And the topper was the frappe. We had a 13 year old in our group who was having the frappe and while drinking it, he got a piece of hard plastic about 1 cm square in his mouth. Luckily enough, he had not swallowed it. When we pointed this out to our waiter, he apologized and changed it and I'd have expected that they will take it off our bill given that this kid had had a narrow escape from choking. 

Next let down was an offer that was going on - a coke and dessert free with every pizza. Our mistake was that we hadn't noticed this promotional banner. But hey...we ordered 2 pizzas and we had also ordered 2 cokes unknown of the offer. They actually charged us for the 2 cokes...unbelievable. Yes, they took it off later but hey...As for the dessert, we had to ask for it but hardly had the appetite left to eat it after all.

It is a shame that such excellent food is pulled down so miserably by the staff waiting on you and also the drinks that go with the food. Ideally, they should try and get a liquor license, so they can complement their food well. But in the meanwhile, get the iced teas and fresh lime up and running. They're some of the easiest things to make.

Will have to go back to ordering in :(

Excellent interiors, average food. We went there for desserts after a light lunch. I ordered a peach ice tea and a slice of their pineapple cake, while my friend went for their oreo shake and caramel-chocolate pastry (not sure about the exact name). Pineapple pastry is a personal favourite and I have sampled many across the city, and it is nowhere as good as the ones served at some other bakeries like kookie Jar, Cakes and French Loaf. It was not moist enough and the pineapple did not seem fresh. My friend however liked the one she ordered. The ice tea was refreshing, but you cannot possibly judge a place by that.  The black and white decor is beautiful and classy, though the large portrait inside seemed a little unfinished.

You walk in and see the patisserie and a display of beautiful breads, cakes and cupcakes which are just as tasty as they look. Then you walk into the restraunt with a beautiful ambience with soft music in the background and even live music on occasion. The food is soooo good!! A little heavy on the pocket but the perfect place for that occasional splurge. Overall a great experience

Had the pleasure of performing live originals and covers with my band here on a certain evening last year. That was the last show i had with my band. The ambiance of this place is pretty cool. And you do get to hear great live music time to time. The foods are a bit overpriced, but they are delicious. Surely worth a try for once. The coffees are great and pulled us through the 'over an hour long' show. So yes, do visit at least once in your lifetime :P

I accidentally visited this place since there was waiting period in the adjacent restaurant but must say good it was full. 
A rare Gourmet restro in Kolkata. Their ambiance is superb , extremely clean. One of the feel good restaurants for people who think going to a restaurant is beyond food. 

Food - Grilled Bhekti in lemon sauce ( Chef Riju special as shown on a TV show) is a must try.  The desserts are super yummy. 

Good Food. Good Place. 

Go for a casual dine-in experience!

Went for dinner on valentines night but came out disappointed.. Ambience was very good but serving time was painstakingly long. However that could have been still managed if the food is good. Ordered a grilled fish with lemon butter sauce. The fish was too salty and the sauce was too citric killing the entire dish. After drawing attention they took away the dish but instead of changing it and getting a fresh platter they brought back the same plate with some more of lemon butter sauce on the side and no alterations made to the originally spoilt dish, making it even more worse. They however gave a brownie as compliment.. Compared to The Country Courtyard near Maddox this restaurant comes out as a  pauper!!!!!

This place is a little unpredictable, sometimes the food is beyond expectations and sometimes below. 
I love their menu and the ambience! 
Their bakery section is also well stacked and quite delicious. I have been to this place a couple of times, and found the service to be a little inconsistent at times but overall a nice place to hangout. 
I feel their almond marble cake is a must try! Last time when I visited this place I tried their fish fingers ( a bit too salty ) their mocha frappe ( just about perfect ) and their pasta ( again delicious ). 
I think the chef is a little moody here, sometimes prepares excellent food and sometimes plain mediocre. Staff is another problem, they are a little clueless and looks confused and dazed most of the time,and since World Cup is going on they are mostly hooked to the television which is understandable considering they are also humans who are addicted to cricket just like everyone else! 
But I do think this place has a lot of scope for improvement because the location is superb and with a little bit of help the food and the service can improve too. 
I would definitely recommend this place to others.

We went to this place to grab a couple desserts and something to drink. Loved the ambience around the sitting area. French apple tart and the pastries were good. Though the other desserts were not available. Blue hawaiian drink was decent and so was the irish coffee. The placr is well priced. Neither reasonable nor expensive. Service however is a bit slow. There was live music playing. These guys were playing and singing well but it at times seemed a but loud since the place is a a little small. But a good place to try overall.

Generally skeptical of new - so called European Fine Dining Gourmet Restaurants in Calcutta - very pleasantly surprised by Delices. Tho we only had breakfast - the Egg Benedict,  Focaccia and Pesto were enough to make out they understand western cooking and presentation. The ambience is cute and a rare Calcutta restaurant that can boast of an open kitchen - clean and hygienic. Will definitely come back for a full meal.

The staff are courteous however takes a lot of time to serve. So when you go be sure you are not in a hurry. Once again the food is superb!

This is my first restaurant review in my hometown of Calcutta, and La Maison Des Delices naturally comes to mind. Recently, a lot of new restaurants have come up in the Southern Avenue/Landsdowne and Golpark area, and I've been quite impressed on recent trips home. I've visited La Maison Des Delices multiple times with friends and family - for dinner, breakfast, morning coffee and also to buy pastries and savories! The decor is homely and pleasant and not at all like a typical restaurant - with a few chairs and pastry counter outside, to the large dining room with its chequered tiles, wrought iron chairs and artworks. And of course the open kitchen. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and remembered me on my second visit some two months after my first. I am a big fan of French food, and went with high expectations which were fully met. The Croque Monsieur was very impressive, with god quality ham and just the right amount of cheese to not overpower the taste. The Salade aux Lardons  was also fresh and tasty. On my next visit, I must try the eggs benedict and the breakfast platter. Among the entrees, my recommendations would be the Chicken Stroganoff, Fricassee de poulet and Mutton Bourguignon. The first is a classic "continental" dish of Calcutta, and was quite tasty with a delicious white sauce gravy. The latter dishes were also delicious and quite filling. For dessert, I was quite stuffed and went with a lemon tart from the pastry selection. Definitely want to try the creme brulee next time. All in all, a very pleasant experience each time. Keep it up!

love the food. love the ambience and friendly service. the quantity of food is exceptionally good. the Brochette De Poulet and Coq Au Vin are a treat of their kind. the soft tenderized chicken just melts in your mouth. The blackforest pastry is one of the best I ever had.Once you have had an experience of Delices' food you will want to come back time and again. Truly one of the best bistro and restaurant in Kolkata. Wish you a very prosperous time ahead. :D

I recently had the chicken puff and the chocolate cake from here... Regarding their review taste wise, kindly refer to the superlatives of my previous review .. :D
P.S : just so you know.. I fell in love with white chocolate all over again......

Went there last Saturday which also happened to be the v-day. Although initially We had just wanted to have coffee,We ended up having dinner. The place was packed when We had gone there and expected slow service. However ,the drinks didn't take much time(although the staff completely forgot one of our drink orders!) And whatever delay was there with regards our food was offset by the fact that the owner on his own came to our table to apologize for the delay . And the wait was well worth it As all the four main course items were very well done. The meal ended with on the house pastries and two boxes of chocolate and I would say it was a pretty nice experience.
Hope to visit the place again, especially to try the breakfast.

Went to this restaurant with wife yesterday. 

Location wise can be a bit tricky as there is no signage on the main road. Its on the opposite lane to the Azad Hind Dhaba in Purno Das Road. 

The ambiance is great. The decor is really nice with old pics and paintings and some interesting art works. Staff is very polite and courteous. However, the kitchen can be very noisy at time. But the best part is;  I left the same remark on the feedback form and before we were leaving the chef came out to me and apologised.

The kitchen is visible from the dining area and it looks reasonably clean with chef and his team wearing really clean cloths. 

The fresh lime soda is a must try. I have had many and the one here is highly recommended. 
We ordered a Soupe Cremeuse Au Poulet (Cream soup with chicken bits), Delices Signature Prawn Cocktail, Delices Mixed Grill Sizzler. The soup was like a normal chicken and veg cream soup (not a soup fan) the prawn cocktail was spot on but the real surprise was the Sizzler. Its very very full and really good tasting. U get a nice succulent chicken breast fillet with two tiger prawns some bacon, mashed potatoes, couple of sausages (the only bland thing in the dish) and a huge mutton patty with lots of gravy on it (though they forgot it initially and gave it to me separately). All the ingredients tasted great. Especially the mutton patty. Each item had distinct flavours (except the sausages) and complemented each other well.
The deserts where equally good went for the French Apple Tart with ice cream. It was spot on.  

Over all a good authentic food joint.
It is advisable that you book in advance as they do not have lot of tables to offer but do make the effort as its worth. 

Pocket wise it costed us around 1800 for two. I would say it was worth every penny.

Happy Vatentien's Day People. It was a very special day for us, was typically tired and didn't want to do really much, picket up a cool looking cake for my better half and bought a sandwich for my folks back home. The chef suggested me a special meat ball sandwich and a chocolate truffle cake. The truffle cake was unbelievably the best in the city of JOY , with pure chocolate and the meat ball was something which I have never had, it was a concoction of taste with an Italian and Swedish  feel . Well thank you. Chef Riju for your efforts. Will be back soon. Will recommend it to every one. Well needless to say although I pack the food and the cake, I must appreciate the effort the people have take to make it a super ambiance inside the restaurant.

Been there for first time on 13th February for dinner....ordered fettuccini carbonara and mutton bourguignon ....fettuccini was melting in mouth and the white sauce is tempting. While mutton bourguignon is a secret sin i would love to commit again. Restaurant was quite empty when we reached....waiters are always there to help you with the menu....but I found the decoration a bit clumsy..... And portions of food sometimes can disappoint you..

Delicacy and authenticity at its best. 

Earlier tonight, I had Lasagne Al Forno with garlic bread sticks. The taste and quality of fresh cottage cheese was simply mouth watering. For the first time, I felt like having the most authentic version of Italian food, with rich cheese and vegetables and the classic touch of seasoned Oregano all in one bite. However, the quantity they provide is lesser when you opt for parcel rather dining in. Still, on the higher price side, I would suggest all cuisine foodies for venturing out this new and genuine version of baked cheese and touch of oregano and sizzling pasta layer at least once.

Nice place .... Ordered cake for my son's birthday, first ordered a pure chocolate cake of 2 pounds . A simple 1 shapped cake cost 1200 a pound .. Me and my wife were given a cafe mocha cake slice to try .. It was fantastic...
Next day we changed our order to a cafe mocha cake ,but the cake didn't had that taste we tried and that hint of coffee was missing , the binding of the cake was not good at all ..But the cake tests awsome ..... Moreover i was asked to pay another 200@ per pound extra for the same... Thats like 1400 a pound... Though i didn't had to pay afterall...
But if i do send 1400 to 1600 per pound surely i am not going to this place...

Wanted to try this place after experiencing a few of their dishes at a marriage party in our community hall. Had indulged in lots of conversation with Chef Riju and  Chef Chirodeep....so finally on 4th jan, went there.
Decor is bright and good......found the staff friendly and was also introduced to one of the co-owners.
Chef Riju recognised me and upon our insistence suggested a couple of dishes. One was a chicken soup........colour was not appealing as it had a slight yellow tinge BUT the moment we tasted the soup.....well it was awesome....The flavours immediately hit us and the light lemon tinge added to its taste......i would say a very well made soup.

We wanted to try their signature dish "Pesto chicken"......well......still can fell the flavours of the pesto sauce...it was just great........pesto sauce made with a lot of helping of extremely dark olive oil......the mashed potatoes were well made......a great dish indeed to have.

FInally upon the chefs advise has the CANNELONNI.   differentky made from the regular ones had at Taajas or Ganges........but found the filling to be lacking a punch...hence suggested to the chef to try adding some more flavours......but the tomato base sauce served with the dish was simply mouth watering...

Finale......the chef gave us a complimentary chocolate cake slice......

Will definately go again and have other dishes

We had tried this place on January 1, 2015 and it must be said that it was a wonderful start to the year. The food was AMAZING! The french fries were the pretty good but not suitable for the ones who prefer oily, lumpy fries that are more 'potato-ey'. It had a light, crispy texture and the accompanying tartar dip/mayo was fresh and perfect. The Ceasar salad was loaded with ham and sun-dried tomatoes! It had fresh lettuce which is pretty are in the regular places and the mayo content was generous yet subtle. The mixed meat sizzler was truly divine and apart from delicious meat portions, the mashed potatoes were to die for! The quantity of the meat sizzler was overwhelming. However, the quantity of the salad was slightly disappointing (but the ham bits provided enough consolation). In the dessert sphere, the Jupiter slice must have been God's own creation!The decor was quite well-done.The cost for the entire meal almost touched the expensive mark and it not quite affordable in general. But for the days on which one wants to splurge on good, really good food in a pretty, really pretty place, this place is worth a visit! :)

Having heard of place from friends,  I entered the quaint bistro with a lot of hope.  And I'm glad to say,  I was pleasantly surprised.  We ordered a mutton steak and Calcutta bhetki sandwich along with fresh lime sodas.  The food was delectable and the service prompt.  The only discord was the music that was being played at the venue.  If they work on a good playlist, the place will make up for the little of ambience.

Two of us had two breakfast plates.  Pluses - Good ingredients, courteous servers & some effort towards keeping up to a certain standard. Minuses - Overpriced, Taste not that great & customer-unfriendly business practises - I had to buy a whole loaf of brown bread to have some slices  - they don't serve brown bread!  Also, interminably long time for service (the server said that the delay was because the chef was not satisfied with how the egg was coming out). Will give it a miss in future.

A very nice place with neat clean interiors and unique paintings of the city of joy.. Try any of its pizzas( thin crust).. Delicious they are.. Although the place was scarcely occupied, the service was slow to say the least. Hope they improve on this.

The place is quite big,the decor is pretty good.As far as the food is concerned,we were highly satisfied with the things that we had ordered.We had ordered a delices special hot chocolate,a rich chocolate tart and another dark chocolate pastry whose name I don't remember.All the dishes were right upto our high expectations.The chocolatyness(that's one word I just made up) of the pastry and the tart were so damn high that one cannot try(trust me,we tried) and talk while chewing.And after a certain point,your stomach gets jammed due to all the chocolate.So my suggestion is that:whenever you order a chocolate based pastry or cake,DO NOT order a chocolate based drink or shake to go with it.Get a virgin mohito or something to wash it down.My experience was great and would love to go there again.

An European Cafe situated on a quiet lane opposite the Azad Hind hotel on Purna Das Rd with a spic & span decor... checkered floor & chandeliers... heady aroma of freshly brewed coffee & savouries wafting out of the show kitchen ... u have it all.
Earlier had the pleasure of having an Eggs Benedict for breakfast out here which was quite satisfying. Decided to come back to savour their main course... did that last Saturday...turned out to be a tad below expectations.
After having a somewhat tough time to decide on lunch course (choices on the menu were mind blowing) opted for Chicken Tetrazzini & Mutton Hamburger Steak.
Tetrazzini with penne pasta & Parmesan sauce & loads of veggies ... both look & taste wise was uninspiring. All those excess vegetables robbed the dish of it's usual creaminess. Sad.
Hamburger steak of minced mutton in a bacon mushroom sauce was better. The mutton patty was meaty & flavorful & the rich brown bacon & mushroom infused sauce was spot on.
Couple of glitches though... firstly the dish comes with Garlic Bread which was missing & had to be reminded... second the sauce though wonderful had a few whole vinegar onions (the ones u get in North Indian restaurants !!!)
Overall...
ambience - great...
food - not the best...
may deserve a second look...

I have been here twice. 
Once I had the sea food pizza, it was quiet nice. 
The other time I had the croque monsieur (ham and cheese sandwitch), this tasted out of this world. You must try this.
I also tried the Iced teas, they are good. 
The decor and ambiance is nice, the staff is courteous but the food takes  really long to come. Moreover they server in small portions. 
If you have time in your hand then its a nice place to hang out.

I went to this place during the Puja season and fell in love with it almost immediately. My friend and I ordered for some serious Italian food and till the time the food reached our tables, we were admiring the ambiance of the place.
The cooking was good, the price of the dishes were quite reasonable much like any other decent Italian or European food outlet would cost in this part of Kolkata..
Would surely recommend my friends to visit this place and I would love to visit this place again if needed....
P.S. Just ensure the latch on the ladies restroom is in functioning.

Went there to order for a birthday cake for my wife. Didnt want a cake off the shelf. The chef personally met me & agreed to make a blueberry cheese cake within 4 hrs. The owner, Mr. Partha Bose guaranteed the quality & promised me a home delivery. 
It was the most beautiful cheese cake, visual & gastronomical. The texture was smooth, the blueberry was a delight. The cake was beautifully decorated. Delivery was prompt.

You don’t like it … too bad … I loved it. I was just going to write a review while I was having my burger at the Delice.   I espd loved the lemon tart, it was awesome ‘period’. And by the way almond cake is not a marble fatty cake … it’s a layered cake, to be had with tea… I mean drenched in the pallet with tea…. Just like a biscuit. I was pretty surprised with the Kolkata ignorance after coming from Gurgaon.  BTW I am a pastry chef myself and don’t like disrespect for good ones. Please next time it better to call for the chef and educate yourself.  Three cheers to the guys who are trying to make a difference in Bengal. A must in Delice is the Prawn cutlet and the LA CUISSON PARFAITE DU BHETKI.

Thought this was an amazing hidden gem when i found it during my recent pandal hopping spree.

I had the lemon tart and the marble cake. Both were awful. Lemon tart was less citric than desired, the biscuit tart had a wierd iceing that lent to a horrible end product. The marble cake too was extremely hard and dry (as though it has been kept for a couple of days). 

All in all, a horrible experience. Based on its pricing (which is 30-50% more than kookie jar) and based on the quality of food. I would give it a rating of 2 on 5. Only thing going for it was the interiors were clean and reasonably good.

La Maison Des Delices or the place for the delicious is a Bistro located off Purna Das Road. It looks pretty inviting from the outside, and is spacious from inside (3000 sq ft they said). It can accommodate about 75 people easily. The decoration is a tad out of place, where you have Indian paintings alongside gilded tapestry and pleated curtains a la Europe. That said, the pastry stand on the outside is neatly done and pretty impressive. They just need to stock up a bit more. The menu is eclectic continental, a wee bit Mediterranean and mostly Italian.

I started off with a cuppa for my friend, and a fresh lime soda for me. The coffee was standard. The fresh lime soda was a bit alternative. They put in small lightly-crushed lime slices into it which left a slightly bitter after-taste. Then we ordered a coffee almond cake. It looked delectable and was generously sized. However it tasted a bit dry. Then we ordered a basic Margherita which was again a bit dry and hard crusted. And we closed the meal with Ravioli, which was done reasonably well. The pricing is a tad on the higher side, but not inexorably high. In all, I would rate this place a 3, however I feel it is promising and has the potential to be a great cafe.

Been planning to visit the bistro ever since I saw its name in the newspaper.. A disastrous shower out of nowhere on Shashthi, in the pujas 2014, forced us to have lunch, very early..
Right from the start, the owners were extemely gracious hosts and we instanlty liked their amiable personalitites..
At their recommendation, we ordered Chingri Cultet for starters, which melted like cheese in our mouth.. Can't remember chingri tasting better than that.. 
Coming to the main course, we had, Coq Au Vin, a typical continental dish, of chicken, bacon and mushrooms, with mashed potato, which was cooked to perfection..
We had Fricasse de Poulet, which had rice, and chicken with a very light sauce, again brilliant..
The last of the main courses, was Risotto Con Pollo Olive, with rice and chicken, very delicious..
Coming to the desserts, the Black Forest was the best we tasted in ages, and Bailey's Parfait, which again, they recommended was outstanding..
Overall, a nice experience and hope to be there again..
A special thanks to Esha and Partha who were extremely gracious to us and provided a fine lunch for us..

My review is based on a series of visits. The waiters are very helpful , the ambience is top notch and interiors are well designed. But what really matters is the food. 
In the patisserie, the top picks are chocolate mud cake, coffee almond cake and Dutch truffle cake. 
In the bistro: the top picks are involtini di funghi e formaggio , spaghetti alglio e olio, grilled cottage cheese burger and lasagna ala forna. 
I also liked the Irish coffee with cream. 
This eatery is a must visit

Today I was craving for pastry and so I dropped in. From outside I didn't expect this place to have such a huge sitting arrangements. I initially thought it was a cake shop. As I entered the cute pastries, cup cakes on the display, decor, wall paintings, the chandelier was beautiful. 

I had ordered one choco mocho pastry which is newly introduced and non veg stuffed Focaccia. The former was delicious. It was soft, creamy, neither too sweet like normal pastries and nor too bitter like dark chocolate. It was medium n perfect. Latter order was ok nothing great. I personally love focaccia bread but stuffed focaccia was not a good choice. 

Anyway, I feel the pastries were great and am definitely going back when I crave for pastry's.

Bon Appétit !!

I use to too keep passing this place and so decided to visit it finally,  I was quite surprised to see the space they have (seating area).  It's very polished and well decorated,  the ambience is really eye catching specially the paintings,  however let's get to the food part now well there menu is noting special but interesting,  I quite liked the ham&chicken burger,  a must have dish for the meat lovers,  however the foccacia was not how I thought it  wld be it was very hard,  shld have been a bit softer. The desserts area complete treat,  you have a lot to choose from,  it's nice the staff is quite courteous n polite,  overall it's a good place to visit.  It's a bit heavy on the pocket but as I will say not  always good food comes at great prices

This was the place i had in my wish list for quite some time. My hubby keeps visiting this patisserie often with his colleagues and all i got to hear is how good their pastries are. At last i had the good luck to visit... Thanks to hubby for taking me here at last. The interior of the place is very creatively done and it gives a soothing effect once you enter the place. The white background, the yummy looking signage outside is too much for you to fall in love with this place. The beautiful ornate cakes on display made me feel like running away with them :p We tried the almond coffee cake and Jupiter which was a mousse cake. I love mousse cakes and  it was after a long long time that my taste buds got a real feel of a perfectly made mousse. It was super yummy!!!! The almond cake... OMG!!! its sinful!!! I could not be satisfied with just one... I have requested my hubby to now get pastries from Delices often as i am in love with them. The pre ordered cakes also looks great and i am surely gonna order one very soon.
Well I visited Delices again and this time it was for lunch.  We ordered an American pepperino pizza along with the mint mocha coffee and hot chocolate truffle.  The pizza was a thin crust one and it was divine. I am not a very big fan of pizza but I just fell in love with the fresh pizza served here. 
The decor is quite serene but the curtains looked out of place. They just didn't go with the decor which is otherwise very soothing and calm.

The experience as a whole was superb. A couple of friends went to dine there a few days ago and said that they enjoyed the experience, so I looked the place up on Zomato, felt encouraged by the reviews and decided to go for dinner there with my family. Everybody loved the food. The meat lovers' pizza, the club sandwich and the spicy prawn pizza were absolutely amazing (the sandwich bread was a tad over-toasted, but that could easily be overlooked. The filling was brilliant). The rest of the food we had ranged between very good and excellent. There wasn't a single thing we had that we didn't like, and since we were a party of 6 we ate quite a lot. But the best item in my opinion was the cream of broccoli soup (it is primarily a veg dish, but the establishment will add chicken to the preparation if you like, which is how we had it). It is absolutely scrumptious. I'm not the biggest fan of soups (I like them very much but prefer to focus on the more substantial part of a meal if you will), and even I loved it. The place is spacious, clean (VERY important) and nicely done up. The decor does need a little bit of work, I feel a few elements are off balance, but at the end of the day all of that ceases to matter when the food is so good. Oh, and the staff are courteous, friendly and attentive. HUGE plus. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who might want to visit.

You see the signage, the lovely white interiors, and you can't help but wanting to step right in!! :)

So step in we did on one evening and were pleasantly surprised...

Loved the white interiors and the chandeliers, would have been happier if they had a few more couches / low seating area as it has a cafe feel to it.

We ordered for a pot of Darjeeling Tea and a Pizza a la Ortolana. The tea was lovely and flavourful served with 4 cookies, the taste going wonderfully well with the tea. The pizza was thin crust with lots of veggies and they were kind enough to substitute the tomatoes with mushroom. It was baked well and the ingredients looked very fresh too!

The service was prompt and courteous.

All in all a very pleasant experience indeed!

PS: Am told their grilled fish is to die for, will be trying that soon....

La Maison Des Delices Patisserie & Bistro shortly known as 'Delices' is a confectionary cum café located in the lane opposite Azad Hind Dhaba in Southern Avenue. It is divided into two sections – the confectionary and the café, and they both have their own separate kitchens. The main entrance leads to the rectangular confectionary, which has its kitchen on the mezzanine floor. Another door from the confectionary leads to the rectangular... café, which houses counter area, dining area and an open kitchen.

Herein, the food is good, décor is confusing and the staff is trained but indifferent!

Café décor is a mix of old and new. Within a limited space, it has a tad bit too many old style ornamental drapes (curtains), as well as low cost plastic chandeliers. One side wall is adorned with paintings, while the other is adorned with framed photographs. Chairs are made of wrought iron and the flooring is old age chessboard type! Amongst all this confusion, there are two sets of four-seater sofa sets, which are old school but very comfortable.

Staff is trained but not courteous like the ones you find in the diners lined up in the Park Street and Salt Lake area. They seem to be too comfortable and satisfied with the footfall of their local patrons. This may be a deterring factor for foodies who drive long miles to check out new places and/or taste good food.

The menu comprises of breakfast, soups, salads, starters, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, pizzas, Italian, beverages and desserts. Each food category has limited but popular options. Food is good, fresh and well presented. Their cupcake décor are a revelation. Apart from them, only Mrs. Magpie (same location) works such wonders with their cupcakes.

We ordered Latte, Stuffed Focaccia and Strawberry Cake Slice. All tasted pretty good. In fact, the Strawberry Cake Slice was the best that we have tasted till date. But the cream design on the coffee was chaotic. And one of the two spoons accompanying the cake slice was turned upside down!

Every now and then me and few other good friends get together for breakfast and some hearty chat. If you live in Cal you know that till recent the most likely option for having morning coffee/ tea would be roadside stalls. Times change, thankfully, with customer demand and now South Kolkata offers a few cafes to kick-start a day.

Before more or less common place was the Wise Owl. I am sorry if mentioning another outlet in a review seems politically incorrect, but the ever agonizing service experience there drove us to find another spot.

La Maison Des Delices was just a savior. Situated near Azad Hind Dhaba, it's quite easy to find. Behind a small neat facade , though, you shall find quite a spacious (by Kolkata standards) sit-in cafe. I honestly don't care about the theme and decor so much, as long as there are no dusty 100 year old curtains or mosquitoes/ cockroaches. The decor is cute but replicates the already becoming hackneyed French motifs. Whatever. 

 We ordered Scrambled Eggs with Mushrooms, Creamy Garlic Mushroom on Toast, Baked Beans on Toast, Masala Omelette, and Egg Whites Omelette. Before coming to details I'd like to point out the readiness to match customer needs - one of us does not eat egg yolks , so asked for only whites omelette. Staff were happy to abide. It's a small thing but it really means a lot, these details make up the experience. That aside, they served a basket with toasts, butter and jam to go with our order, and a couple of baked goodies. Plus tea and coffee which were ordered, like , 5 minutes before we had to leave, and were served promptly. 

Nothing much to comment on the taste of eggs to order, guys, eggs are just eggs, honestly. My Scrambled Eggs with Mushroom were nice, hot, with good amount of sliced mushrooms, and went perfectly with the buttered toast and a lively conversation. Picked up their mud cake and a loaf of bread for home. Cake was nice, with smooth and rich chocolate filling, the pastry crust a bit too dense, thick and heavy for my liking. Was very eager to try out macaroons but those were not available, so guess will have to make another trip soon enough. Nice basic place to have a decent breakfast , whether on your own or in a group. My biggest liking -their staff and service, quick, with a smile, polite. Will come again, and again, for sure.

Was there yesterday and it was a decent experience. Its a nice sophisticated place where everything seems prim and proper. Not like the other coffee shops where you have everyone chatting away to glory. Service was also good. Though it had a french name, food was more inclined towards Italian. Had a Assorted Bruschetta, which i liked, different from normal. And also had a Fritto Misto, which seemed like Italian pakodas of prawn, squid and seafood. But it was tasty. Had it along with darjeeling tea and hazelnut frappe and chocolate mud cake. The cake was too sweet for comfort but the food was good

We just strolled into la maison one evening for a snack..must say lot of effort has been put into the decor of the place...the feel is that of a upscale patisserie.Interesting sketches of old kolkata adorn the walls with bright chandeliers     all across..We tried their assorted bruschetta , fritto misto, darjeeling tea and hazelnut frappe..The food was decent and service was fine.Although the name is french there is not much french cuisine on the menu and leans more towards Italian. Being a patisserie , the range and taste of pastries is quite good. Planning to give it another try for their main course items now..

The one thing that strikes you when enter this restaurant is its very pleasing and soft decor. There is a cafe at the front with the main restaurant at the back side. I am not allowed to indulge in sweets and hence couldnt sample the delightfully inviting looking pastries but we did eat the full course of dinner. The broccoli soup was very nice. The starter of chicken and cheese on hardened toast was good but I could have ordered something different:). The Spaghetti Bolognese and the Grilled fish were absolutely good!! Looking forward to visiting again

After reading a good review about having breakfast at this restaurant in one of the Sunday Graphiti magazines, we decided to try out the place this Sunday. I would advise readers to check on the Map for zeroing on the exact location, as contrary to the full bodied name that the restaurant advertises, in actual, the only word "Delices" will  catch your eye when searching for this restaurant. (The rest of the words though displayed at the front are virtually  invisible as the letters are sized similar to the disclaimers you read in a red herring prospectus!) 



Anyway, the first time you enter, it seems like a quaint cake shop (albeit the overcrowding of chandeliers) but the main seating area is in the annexe. We were a group of eight and the ordering included an assortment chosen from their breakfast menu. The bacon and stuffed omelette were delicious and so was the French breakfast platter and the Eggs Benedict. However their service though friendly and attentive, left much to be desired for, especially when the pancakes that we had ordered, finally appeared on our table after more than an hour. By that time the whole group had finished their platters except for my two nephews who had unfortunately ordered for the pancakes!. On querying, we were  told that the pancake batter had to discarded as it was not fresh and so the kitchen had to make a fresh batter as a result of which...the delay. Frankly, this could have been communicated to us earlier so that we could have selected any other option.  Though the decor and ambiance was nice and cosy, I would request them to install the insect catchers.... there were too many flies bothering us which in fact was quite a dampener when compared to the posh decor.

A Fancy name for a fancy place. I wanted to visit this Bistro and patisserie from the day I laid eyes on it. It looks quite inviting from outside. So one evening, barely hungry I dropped in. There are separate seating areas for the Patisserie and the Bistro, both dainty white, and tastefully decorated. The Patisserie are, is narrow with three or four garden tables, and garden chairs. I have never sat outside in the Patisserie area. Inside the Bistro there are number of tables, and few sofas too. The floors are Black and white and the tables and chairs match. Ambiance is quite peaceful and pretty. There is light music in the background, not loud enough to interrupt conversations.

The Menu is not very elaborate. They have a breakfast section which sounds quite interesting. Unfortunately I have never been able to make it for breakfast here.

 I have tried the following:

Polo e Fungi- This pasta I have fallen in love with because of the rich cream it is cooked in. It is not bland and has perfect consistency and Seasonings. The portion is quite much to fill one person, even if you are a big eater.

Blue Hawaiian Mocktail - I have a fascination for blue drinks, and this was one of the best blue ones I have tasted.

Spaghetti Bolognese- This too has a nice consistency to the sauce and is not too spicy. just as I like it.

Chocolate Fondant with Ice Cream- The fondant is nice and gooey, and ice cream is usual, nothing extraordinary. this dessert is more or less satisfactory. The chocolate tastes good in my opinion.

From the Patisserie I have tried the Green Apple Pastry (not sure whether that's the exact name) and I quite loved it.

The Chocolate pastry whose name I have completely forgotten was average to taste.

I have visited only a few times. would like to try other things on the menu too.

Pocket inch - The Bistro is a little expensive and the Pastries range from 100-200/-

Servers are sometimes lost about things on the Menu, and some items on the menu are not always available. however service is quick and servers friendly.

Do try. Enjoy :)

Just because I wanted to go into a new restro I chose in dis joint. Me n my bestie were nearly filled in. what struck us was the decor. An old ancient european decor that we got to see. I was mesmerised. Every details was perfectly etched. Since we were not on the hungry side we decided to go in for 2 mocktails. The mango rapture n the shirley temple. I have never tasted such great mocktails in my life. Then we decided on minced lamb strudel and a chicken caeser salad which was good. Then we order for cupcakes n pastries. Tried in the chocolate mud cake, lemon tart pastries, strawberry,  choco mint n choco chunk, white chocolate n apricot cup cake. It was sooooo good. Next day i wanna go in for the delices signature fricassee de poulet.. they make the best in town. Stuffed focaccia . I wanna give it a try. As for mocktails I wanna try in chocolate monk n hazelnut frappe. I m going back soon.

Looked a very small joint form outside,but once you enter it is fairly a big place as well as cosy. Went to just snack a bit and ordered a Chicken Quiche and a pastry called Opera - both were good in taste and value for money as well. Ended with a nice cup of Darjeeling tea.

Though the place looks like a tiny little bakery from outside it is rather a great big restaurant inside with beautiful interiors and a lovely ambience. It has a very french feel according to me which i totally loved!! Now lets come to the food.... after reading quite a few complaints regarding pork chops i was quite hesitant to try out the other dishes as well but still i went there with friends and carefully avoided the pork chops.. but the other items like pizzas, grilled chicken and all were totally great!
especially the grilled chicken... it left me asking for more!! its juicy... yummy... tender and really well cooked.
I would ask all to try it once! The service was pretty great too... and I totally loved the place!! :)
I would definitely go back there again!!
such a happy place....:)
p.s. I genuinely wish they improve the pork chops so I can dig in that too!!...:D

What looks like a small bakery from outside, spreads out into a full fledged restaurant almost magically. The checkered floor, clean walls, plush upholstery and gold tinted chandeliers assured me that this won't be a let down. 
The fritto misto itself was good, but nothing splendid and came with an interesting dip. But the delices special lamb burger was amazing! It was one of the best burgers that i have tasted and is a must try for burger lovers. 
But then, the garden cupcake and the coffee almond cake both disappointed me. no matter how pretty they looked, they lacked majorly in taste. The cupcake frosting was too sugary, and even the cupcake itself was very ordinary with no particular flavour. The coffee almond cake was dry and failed to give the requisite kick of either coffee or almonds. So may be i will go back again, but I won't be ordering their cakes again.

I am a frequenter at this place and from the very first time I never had a reason to complain. I am in love with their meat lovers'  pizza,  potato parmesan and their pastas .What I love most about this place is the ever polite and courteous staff who are never bugged with all the questions  I throw at them. The chef too is always accessible and it's a delight to see your pizza being taken out of the oven through a pane of glass in the kitchen.The desserts are delectable..mocha pastry to apple pie,  it's all so good. Good place to relax and have a nice conversation  over great food.

last week on 5th of july I had gone to La Maison Des Délices - Pâtisserie & Bistro with my friend, we both had ordered PORK CHOPS,VIRGIN MARY & Delices Special Dessert, the pork chops turned out to be raw...and after consuming it a bit we asked your management to change it,you guys did as requested but ,my friend got diagnosed with Trichinosis the very next day, ended up in the hospital for a week...that's how bad your food is...

I'M SORRY BUT DO NOT PUT OUR HEALTH AT RISK...AT THE COST OF YOUR CHEAP SERVICE & FOOD OF SUCH DISGUSTING QUALITY...PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU DO A REVAMP INTO THE STAFF WHO YOU HAVE HIRED TO MAKE SURE THE FOOD THAT IS SERVED IS SAFE ACCORDING TO THE NORMS OF THE INDUSTRY. ALSO IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WHEN MEAT SUCH AS BEEF & PORK IS SERVED PLEASE ENSURE IT IS SAFE FOR CONSUMPTION.

An accidental visit to La Maison Des Delices left me with just three words, 'Wow, what food!' We were four friends, in search of a resturant offering some change and surprise to our taste buds, when we stumbled into Delices. The decor is simple and pleasant and the ambience is perfect for all occasions. The first time we went we tried the fried chicken burger(classic, absolutely), Pork Chops and chicken lasagna, which in fact the chef himself recommended. I'm not much of a soup person, but we also did try the roasted corn and chicken chowder and till date, I'm completely in love with it. The rich buttery and creamy flavours of the chowder is simply amazing. The pork was tender, great flavour and delicious. Every dish is aesthetically very pleasing with great presentation. Since I have a sweet tooth and am completely in love with my desserts, the Chocolate Mud cake, remains my all time favourite. Its rich and gives great satisfaction to your taste buds. Also I need to mention, the staff working here are really friendly and a special word of appreciation for the chef, (whose name I couldn't catch the last time I went) who is equally friendly and whose food is an absolute delight! I love this place :)

This place was on my top wish-list , and I really wanted to come here for a really long time. Alright to start with , it's very easily located and the ambience is perfectly beautiful the black & white floor, the wall paintings , the photo frame section all of that is really perfect ! 
BUT will you pay 1450 for raw meat ? Pls say no ! Cus I will never !! 
So here's the raw meat story !! 
We ordered pork chops , Virgin Mary , and mint iced tea.  lastly the bailey's ice cream. 
~ pork chops 
This came along with boiled veggies and mashed potato. 
Mashed potato was really good , but the pork chops, my holy lord ! 
I took the first bite thinking this is the best thing ever on earth !! The taste was nearly perfect , cut the second piece and put it in my mouth and guess what ? The meat was raw. Yes I had uncooked pork ! I nearly threw up and lost my Appetite. 
When complained they did change and give me a new plate full of pork chops but I had already lost my appetite so this was just really really disgusting !! 
Huge disappointment with raw meat. 
~ mint iced tea 
This was good , really really good ! 
~ Virgin Mary 
Was just fine. 
~ ice cream. 
Again this was just fine. 
What I really liked was the service , extremely polite staff members !! Much impressed. But food was a major down fall.

I and one of my cousins were out to have some coffee on a winter weekday evening. Since we were meeting after work, we were hungry too. We decided to visit this café cum bakery. I have been to this joint earlier. It's near Vivekananda park, very close to lake girls' school. From outside it looks a small bakery but once you stepped in,you would find out a large spacious restaurant inside with a see-through kitchen surrounded by glass. The construction will remind you of an old architecture. The floor with black and white tiles, the chandeliers,the paintings and the wrought iron small tables and chairs were perfectly in sink and looked very nice. Though the chairs and tables are small and are not comfortable at all. Coming to food, we ordered café mocha, café americano and cravettes sautées a l'ail. Café mocha was average but café americano tasted pathetic. I didn't get proper aroma of coffee beans. Cravettes were really yummy and basically garlic prawns but not dry rather a bit gravy and spicy. Next we ordered strawberry slice from bakery section. It was soft, fresh and tasty. Price is on higher side. Service is good.

Quite a number of casual peeks- day after day were inviting enough, but somehow kept putting off the visit  till the day I was dragged into it by a dear friend. 
I loved the signage, and upon entering  was pleasantly amused to see that the place was quite large.Its a visual treat, dainty chairs and tables,rooms painted in white, beautiful light fixtures..the chess floor tiles and the curtains however were a little off the theme of the place.A large number of pictures adorned the walls, but most were not aligned properly and lacked continuum. We were lucky to visit the place on an empty day because otherwise we would have had a cluttered experience-too many tables stuffed in!
The service is prompt, courteous. We had a problem with an order (hair in the food) , it was taken care of well.
Coming to the main part, food-leaves a lot to be desired. The vanilla-praline shake was not blended well, felt like sipping a vanilla shake and chewing nuts. Mint Iced Tea-the less said the better. Garlic milano prawns- tasted ok, more a botched-up attempt than a perfect dish.The pork chops au poivre was good enough, but it was not in a rich creamy brandy sauce as it proclaims to be. Expected the dessert to be the high point, but it was disappointing.Darjeeling Tea was the only perfect dish.
The place is good for a lazy outing, if you are not overtly concerned with food.

The decor is ok , they have their own bakery upstairs , food all over was ok , 
I ordered the iced tea which was not so great , caesar salad and stuffed mushrooms were tasty enough , wanted to try the chocolate fondant , sadly was told after the meal that it will take 20 mins more so had to cancel it . 

Food is ok but service is very slow . The other items should be good not tried it yet though .

Will give it a try again when i have lot of time to waste.

The Delights of Home, is what I understand the name means, with my limited knowledge of the French language. I had passed by the place often, dismissing it as a glorified pastry shop till my friend enlightened me about the existence of a bistro inside. In December of 2013, I visited the place for the first time along with my gang of guys. I was surprised at the beautifully decorated interiors and the art. The owner came and spoke to us, suggesting something that we should definitely order that evening and also discussed the art and the decor. The hype was overwhelming and the food had to be way more than just standard continental to make the cut. We went straight for the main course(hungry as all of us were). I ordered the Pork Chops Au Poivre, and was delighted at the very sight of it. I'll get straight to it, the pork chops were so amazing that I didn't speak to my friends till I had finished eating. The fact that my friend was a relative of the owner, also secured for us a particular specially made dessert which was not on the menu, so we walked out of there not just satiated but ecstatic with joy. The Delights of Home really got to us..The pocket pinch is on the higher side, one may say, but the delights to be savored are not of the ordinary sort either..It is really the kind of place where you should take a really upset girlfriend for a date..ENJOY

Last Friday, my partner was taking me for a surprise.. and we stumbled onto Delices... and he himself was surprised... and we postponed our planned surprise and went inside..
The bakery section seemed promising, so we went ahead into the dining hall.. it was a mixed decor.. supposedly they tried for a French theme, but too many paintings on the wall, out fashioned chandeliers and curtains ..totally killed it. The sitting is cramped.. tables very close to each other and people talk so loudly these days i could hear more of the other people than my partner ( and he is not a soft spoken guy :-P ). Even the music they were playing could not be heard.. i thought it to be French  ;-) It was our plain old school English of course.
Coming to the food.. high on the price i would say.. we ordered a prawn pizza..costed 355. Pizza was okay..nothing special.
And their special hot chocolate was not special either. 
Service is average.. huge crowd.. though i am not sure why. I would definitely not go back... not what i expected of a French bistro. The food costed more than its worth, ambiance is a total mess. A total waste of money and even more regretting, our precious evening.

Excellent service. The owner is always available to help you.  A good sign of a new place, where you have a good manager not just to direct you to a table but show that extra care in helping you choose the right selection of food as well as making sure that you have a very good experience through out.
Food is very good especially the signature pizza and pesto is a must try for vegetarians. Desert is also nice. Just a look at the cake and pastry shows, how sumptuous is the desert.
The joint has a lot of paintings with real bengal art feel for you.
Small and quite place for a relaxed dinner or coffee.

The decor is nice. As you enter the place,you can see colourful cakes in different shapes and themes lined up for display.
The room is themed in white with paintings hung in the wall and a glass open kitchen.
We ordered a brownie blended coffee which was perfectly made, creamy but not too sweet. The polo e fungi pasta was just out of the world. It had a mixture of red and white sauce,one of a kind and was Yumm. We could not help but ogle at the pastries display while we were entering the cafe. Hence could not resist and ordered a chocolate mud cake and it was heavenly.
Definitely worth a visit or more.

Visited again during pujas. The food was heavenly. The fish was fresh n soft, the lobsters were yumm,the dessert was d perfect ending

Purna Das Road is the new Park Street of Kolkata. As rightly mentioned in a couple of reviews here, La Maison Des Delices - Patisserie and Bistro which claims to serve culinary delights from France and Italy is quite a disappointment. With Wise Owl and Magpies on either side, one would usually visit this place when the two others are crowded. We did just that. We entered and saw colorful, cake art all over. We walked into its restaurant which was quite empty except for maybe one other table. We sat down and ordered for two Mojitos. My cousin kept telling me that they don't serve the best food and she pointed at the number of flies in their open glass kitchen. Then at another table, we overheard a conversation between the customer and the waiter about the cookies having fungus. We were quite disgusted already by which time (about ten mins) our drink arrived. Suspiciously brown, I assumed it was the brown sugar. A little too tart and almost sour perhaps from the lime and a strange salty taste from the water/soda. Now, when you call out to a server in an almost empty restaurant, its annoying to see them saunter past your table. Extremely nonchalant and indifferent, the servers surely need training if they want to improve. After asking them to change the drink, they simply added copious amounts of sugar syrup. One glass was almost crystal clear while the other still had the brown tinge. Im really hoping it was just brown sugar and nothing else. We didn't want to get it changed again. After a sip or two, we asked for the bill. This was promptly placed on our table. 

2 mojitos = Rs 400. 

Verdict: Never again.

One of those places I would keep going again and again, if only to have their Signature dishes. Fricasee de poulet, Spaghetti Carbonara, Pizza Primavera (thin crust and very yum), Coq au vin, Bhekti Boullabaise, Lamb Lasagna, Soup de Creme oignon, Risotto (forgotten the exact name) are excellent, among others! 

Special mentions: They make really balanced mashed potatoes.

La Maison is an absolute treat for the eyes from moment one walks in, whether you consider the decor or the cakes they showcase !!!

Located in Keytala road near South Avenue opposite AHD, its a relatively new Bistro which looks very warm and welcoming from outside itself. Once you enter, there is a big showcase on your left for ready savories and sweets and a few small tables on right with wall art made from basic kitchen utensils. Beyond this area you could enter the large dining cum chilling area which is just too beautiful. The space is big and the high ceilings make it more spacious. The big chandeliers and matching lamp shades give a grand look. The chess textured flooring and the wrought iron chairs add to the decor but i have always had a discomfort with such chairs. The staff are pretty warm and polite.

The menu is quite long and prices are a bit on higher side. I dint try a lot of items from the menu as such but only a couple of snacks and coffee. The cheese corn puff was decent, muffins were nice but loved their brownie blended coffee. Its is definitely one of the best blended coffees i have had in recent times. Just fell in love with the coffee and would recommend it big time. The muffins are pretty soft and tasteful. Also tried their cheese indian spicy bread loaf which was pretty soft and had lovely flavour of garlic.

Overall i loved my experience here and looking forward to try their other items !!!

Amazing food. Savoury Sandwiches. Great French breakfast salad, buttery muffins. Good Ambience over all

Minuses:
Bad ventilation. Kitchen smoke keeps getting into the restaurant. 

They need to work on the pineapple and Black Forest. Not even halfway to the Kookie jar taste. In fact no one has reached there yet.

it was in one of my "lets-go find a new place " mood that i discovered this place which at first appeared to me like a patisserie but then as i asked the neatly dressed man behind pastry counter about a cup of coffee he quite charmingly opened a door beside that lead to what was a proper restaurant (surprise!)  ... the place is tastefully done up with a quasi victorian feel to it with the checkered floorings, elaborate chandeliers some old music just humming in the background ... i was instantly impressed ! we ordered an Irish coffee, Delices classic cold coffee along with Girello di pollo and good old chili cheese toast - and as its name Girello di pollo stood out- it is a must have for the chicken-cheese romantics. coffee was average in fact it turned me off a bit as they served me my cold coffee without sugar ! service was quick and the staff were friendly too.... overall a refreshing new find.. would definitely love to go back for a more fuller meal :)

La Maison Des Delices is one of the best continental restaurants in South Kolkata. It's not the usual typical indianized park street continental fare overloaded with white sauce and crappy cheese - this is a more authentic continental experience. 
The food here is on par with some of the finest Kolkata continental eateries like spaghetti kitchen and corner courtyard, on the plus side it's lighter on the pocket too. The interiors are very spread out and nicely decorated with beautiful paintings.

What we tried: 

Sicilian garlic chicken starter - nice succulent pieces of chicken tossed with garlic and herbs
Lamb Lasagna: excellent - lots of lamb and cheese
Pork Chops: great, very light gravy. I highly recommend this dish.
We bought some desserts from the patisserie and they were really good.

They seem to have a good selection of pizzas - but I really can't comment since I avoid generic dishes in specialty restaurants.

Some more lamb and possibly beef dishes would be nice. 

Looking forward to eating here again.

Nestled mid-way between WiseOwl on one side and Mrs. Magpie, practically next door, it still holds its own. The beautiful cakes on display beckons you to come inside and unwind. Barcelona and Almond Slice- two of my favourites there. 
Then when you step in further, into their spacious sitting area inside, you are immediately hit by the neat and candid Indo-French influenced decor. I loved it! 

Tucked away into the corners are two low sofas.. I have my dibs on that! 

The menu is extensive. Needless to say, Offering a variety of French cuisine.. Crocque Madame and Fungi e Pollo. Extremely yummy! 

I think it's an absolutely perfect place to chill out with your girlfriends, go on the occasional laid-back dates and let your hair down and enjoy!

Excellent Patisserie & Bistro = La Maison Des Delices Patisserie & Bistro shortly known as 'Delices' 
=====
Intro:

La Maison Des Delices Patisserie & Bistro is located amidst the famous cafes such as Wise Owl and Mrs. Magpie. Well, to be more precise, opposite lane facing Azad Hind Dhaba, Hindustan Park.

As far as i remember, This particular place had opened on December 20th, 2013 and was graced by quite a few celebrities from the Bengali Film industry. I was searching for patisserie's and Bistro's which is the upcoming trend in the City of Joy and i certainly went here as this was on my wish list for quite a long time!. Well, as i reached here.

The inviting part was the Green Plants which were kept on the outside. 

 The get up of the cafe was somewhat like:-

1) On the left side, they had the cafe advertisement poster which was kept supported on the road. 

2) The famous Delices Cafe which had:-

a) Pastry Shop outside to serve people who want to eat a few pastries and little bit of patties and stuffs. It had well decorated paintings by the famous painter Kali Das. Similar paintings were also spotted on 'Caramelle' by the same painter. Well, here, the restaurant menu isn't served and only pastries 

b) The dine in restaurant area was huge comprising of the staff area(which was transparent and one can peep in and see how the food is being prepared), Washroom and the dine in section. However, the dine in section could be divided into two and one part can be used by them for a private party as they had separate hanging curtain system for the same. I found the get up of the place excellent and quite appealing. I got impressed by the ambience and the hospitality to a large extent. 

This place did give a higher level to the existing patisserie's and bistro's . I am very happy that the city of joy is coming out with certain good places like this. 

c) On the right side, well the Uk inspired 'Chalk style' decoration done with various colour's burgers, pizzas and mock-tails. Well, interesting and welcoming. :) 
=====
Food ordered: 

As i was getting restless to try up the food out here, i had planned my food in such a way that i get to eat one pastry from outside part and one item of the restaurant. I did exactly the same. 

I had ordered:- 

1) Strawberry Slice Cake - It was SUPERB. It had the strawberry mixed up with creme and jelly of strawberry which was melting in the mouth giving a sweet palate to it. Well, Loved it. Mouthwatering and Lip smacking. It was well decorated with a layer of cream on top. 

2) Grilled Cottage Cheese - VEGETARIANS!! Don't Miss this. A lovely preparation of Marinated Cottage cheese, Grilled onion with Cheddar with smoked bar b q sauce inside. Mark my words, i have never had such a crunchy and a flavourful burger all my life and specially such a good dish with Paneer. My goodness. This burger was served to me with tasty Salad dressing, Fries and Ketchup. It made my day. When i took my first bite, i got indulged in the crunchy burger on the outside and so soft paneer inside specially with the bar b q sauce and roasted onion tickling my palate. it did WONDERS. A sure shot Recommendation from my side. The french fries were served to me hot and were good enough. The salad dressing also was too good which was served on Ice Berg Lettuce leaf. One of my favorite veg dish till now. A must have for all of you. It was quite filling too. 
=====
Pros:- 

1) Excellent Decors. Inviting outdoors.
2) Patisserie and Bistro under one roof.
3) Instrumental music as a background was soothing.
4) Courteous staffs. Good hospitality. 
5) Food is excellent here. 
6) No additional taxes charged. Prices inclusive of taxes.
7) Good options for vegetarian's too. 
8) Moderately good A la carte. 
9) Hygiene is quite maintained.
10) Quite filling food. 

Cons:- 

1) Lacks a feedback form. 
2) Well, costly affair if you dine in their restaurant section. The mock tails are kept quite costly.
=====
Meal for two - 600-700 in restaurant section. 300 in the usual pastry section
=====
Suggestions:

1) Some of the staffs are not well accustomed with the food knowledge. A little idea should be given to them.
2) Keep continuing to serve good food. People will come.
3) Feedback form is a must. 
4) Come up with Combo Offers. 
5) The staffs can improve their hospitality skills.
=====
What i noticed:
1) Well done ambience.
2) Lovely food. 
3) Moderate hospitality. 
4) A Modern Concept Cafe. 
5) A healthy option for people who are health conscious.
=====
Summary:- 

Food presentation 5/5
Food quality 5/5
Taste 5/5
Hygiene 5/5
Hospitality 5/5
Ambience 5/5
Value For money 4/5
=====
Conclusion:

I had an excellent time here. I faced absolutely no trouble from coming to the cafe and leaving the cafe. The staffs were courteous enough to say  It is one of the places which has a good gastronomical experience. The dishes which i ordered were totally satisfying to me. I have attached a few pictures below. Kindly have a look. The next visit is promised. :)

Unfortunately it turned out to be another place with a lot of "oomph" factor and even some overly priced pastries couldnt pull the show for them. To my utter surprise, I still visited this place thrice and probably never going back. Beautifully decorated! Only the chair (other than the sofas) are very uncomfortable. Looks nice but for a lazy coffee lover like me, it doesn't work very well. Anyways, very poorly done Coffee (Cappuccino & Mocha)..and an overly priced Stuffed Focaccia was not enough. Stuffing inside the Focaccia was very confusing but not bad. Garlic Chicken (forgot the real name) was actually quite nice. Now the beautifully rich cakes and pastries were very overpriced for what you were offering. Only you can survive in an area like Purna Das Road/ keyatala where people even visit your nearest neighbour Wise Owl and never bother to use their brain about what they are having and at what price. Staffs are kind of alright, not sure what to say. Probably your huge bistro needs a little life and better quality of coffee. I spotted a culinary school inside and not sure if they can offer you guys some help. :) Focaccia bread was okay but can be better. Overall a very unimpressive food and your coffee is expensive like Coffee Beans. But fortunately Coffee Beans does serve real good coffee. So I guess I have not done justice to the money spent. Anyways, good luck :)

Awesome ambience for a great adda after a busy and hectic day at office. A must visit for people who prefer a good coffee over some lip smaking snacks.

Whats in a name? Absolutely nothing.

We were quite intrigued by the menu of La Maison Des Delices - Patisserie and Bistro and so decided that we must visit this restaurant which was given positive reviews by many a person. It was a treat from my best friend and so on a hot spring afternoon three not so young yet young enough ladies went in with great expectations. Located off Purna Das Road it is not very difficult to locate if you are coming from Golpark and keep an eye on the left.

I entered the tiny little joint and was yet to form an opinion when the gentle person at the counter asked me to take a look at their spread of patisseries. Well we were there for some lunch and so I was shown the room which houses the restaurant. My first impression was that of a rectangular room cluttered with too many tables and chairs. To be fair taste is subjective be it in any matter and the drapes did not particularly match the interiors of this bistro or patisserie. As the name suggests it has offerings from France and Italy. Since decor is secondary to the main purpose of a restaurant I let my dislike for the decor pass and asked for a lemon iced tea to be served after my friends' arrival. Here I must mention that while I do not consider myself a connoisseur of tea , I do have a particular preference and prefer mine freshly mashed and flavourful.

Soon my little party arrived and we all decided that the decor was not what we could appreciate. We moved on to ordering the Pizza which we had eyed and settled for the meat lover's pizza.

Here is what I personally do not understand. Kolkata is a city which is very near to tea estates which is famed for producing some of the finest black tea of the world. So why  cafes should use tea bags is a cause of utter disappointment for me. It is not an unnatural expectation that one gets the best of local available ingredients. I shall go no to describe exactly how my iced tea was, watery with too much of lemon and no taste of tea. Both my friends had the same opinion .

We were soon served the pizza which was a medium sized one and had about 8 medium sized pieces. The first bite and I was delighted yet missed something. A bit of chewing and I realized that while I enjoyed the generous amount of cheese and meat a pizza without a base of tomato is no pizza at all. I refuse to actually get into any debate of how pizzas can be different since anyone can simply read about the varied kinds of pizzas available from different regions of Italy and one would not find one single pizza without a base of tomato. I rest my case with 'the very big article from Wikipedia)  for those who are interested. While I would say that the pizza which in reality was not a real pizza was delicious I do not appreciate the restaurant misleading customers into believing that a pizza without a tomato base can be called a pizza. This is not the first time that Calcutta has had its brush with authentic pizza. years ago a Neapolitan lady had opened a restaurant which served some excellent pizzas till a few years ago and ever since their standard started spiraling down we had been looking for another option but if this is the other option I am mighty sad.

Since none of us were very impressed with the iced tea and the pizza , though all of us agreed that the so called pizza served was delicious indeed we decided to call it a day at Delices. The bill of Rs700 for three terribly made iced teas and a so called pizza which though delicious on its own is not a pizza was not value for money at all. Since it had no substantial base we were hardly full. While going out I saw a burger which was served to another diner and was very disappointed to find the top part a bit burnt (just a tiny bit but nevertheless it was noticeable) Their offer of pastries was not quite varied and in all it was a very dissatisfying visit for us.

The service was odd. We were constantly asked when we would order the mains and I for one was quite annoyed with the interruption. When we asked for the bill they repeated if we wanted anything else. Well, when a customer asks for the bill it is anyways implied that she doe snot want to order any more food. Caring for the customer and being pushy are two different ways of conducting oneself .

It was good to see this bistro located in a quiet neighborhood....away from the hubs of malls and high streets. A fairly nice menu, the best part being that each section is restricted in number of dishes but pretty eclectic. We had a Pepperoni Pizza to start with. The base was good...thin and pretty much cheesy (no pun intended). They could have been a little bit liberal with the pepperoni. 7/10. The pork chops could have been cooked better. Was a little tough and did not come off the bone easily. Interesting white brandy sauce...most of it on the side...which was good as I like my chops plain grilled and bank on the marination more than the sauce. 6/10. Though i did not have the grilled fish with lemon butter sauce, but am told that it could get a 7/10. For presentation of the mains i would give a 7/10. For VFM it would easily get an 8/10. Will surely go back. Recommend

Location: the lane opposite azad hind dhaba on purna das road.
Decor: well a lot has already been said about it.
Food: I visited that place after reading the review on T2. For starters we had ordered the stuffed mushroom. It looked quite appealing and enticing but taste wise was quite insipid. it had a stuffing of cheese and spinach. Albeit the dip served with it was quite good.
Then we ordered a leek and onion quiche and a black forest pastry from the patisserie. The quiche was outstanding. The best I had in the city. The black forest pastry was quite hard, non juicy and not good. We left it after a bite or two.
For main course we had penne paprika which was very good. Instead of bell peppers I asked them to put mushrooms ( for which I was charged strangely).
 We also had a burger which had cottage cheese in BBQ sauce. What was in between the breads was quite good. But the bread was hard and leathery. 
For desserts we were keen to have the lemon creme brulee which they ran out of. So we had Bailey's parfait. It had a very mild taste of Bailey's. Copious quantity of cream. The crunchiness of caramel was quite good. But the brownie in it seemed malnourished, dry and non buttery.
The bill was  Rs1000 for two of us. (We got 2 quiches packed)
Overall an average experience. But would want to visit this place once more since it's new and a work in progress in order to give a final verdict.

A bistro is a small restaurant serving moderately priced food in a modest decorated atmosphere and mainly judged by the food they serve. Quoting Wikipedia.
This new eatery is just the place. Went there today reading the T2 review.
The ambiance excellent.Loved the see through kitchen and the cleanliness .Once you enter you just love the place.The service was prompt.The cutlery,plates,tumblers.....all of a one quality.
Now food. Had the breakfast platter. Being a bong can't resist saying KONO KATHA  HOBE NA BOSS.Juice, bread ,warm croissant,masala omelette, smashed potato,grilled tomato,bacon,muffin and coffee. Awesome.Need to come back for pizza and main courses.
Whlie coming out bought muffins and lemon tarts from the patisserie. Gulped the tart returning home.The best in town.The hard crust is more than perfect. Cookie Jar has a competitor.So has Mrs Magpie and Wise Owl.

Loved the ambience. A well-lit restaurant is quite a bold idea when dim-lit restaurants are all over. But they have pulled it off well. The food was excellent but a little more quantity would have made the pinch to the pocket bearable.

I have just been to this quaint place today based on the recommendation of others. We were two heads looking for a decent continental dinner in n around that area. I believe the décor n the cleanliness of the eatery looks proper though I could not understand whether it  is an  Anglo French or  an Anglo Saxon interiors with a pinch of colonial past  or a bit of everything ? 

Anyway, we opted for a single hors de' oeuvres followed by two of their main courses. The prep time and the service were horribly slow and the servers seemed too oblivious about the basics. We were told that all the items would be in front of us by 15 minutes and we sat without anything for at least an hour. The food was al right but what killed the entire evening was the brazen behaviour of an individual who might be the manager or the owner(not sure) the gentleman came asking about our feedback about the food when I politely mentioned about their slow service which was a shame for a fine dining joint. He was quite ghastly and shot back in a patronising manner about fine dining restaurants and their services. I did not mention that I have eaten in Michelin stared joints run by Ramsay n Bluementhal as  that is where I come  from and if they cant afford to be brazen to their clients then I am bloody sure this guys cant even dream of either.

I was quite taken aback by this rudeness and to be honest in a hospitality industry the most deadliest of the sin is being boorish to your clients, cheers !

Well, Wise Owl located in the same neighbour definitely has some competition from this newbie. The risotto and lemon cooler were pretty high notch. Will visit again, this time for breakfast.

What a Place!!! 
Though I am not very good at writing reviews but couldn't stop myself from writing one for this place..
You never know what's in store till you reach the place.. 
Everything that was served to us was very delicious as the name suggests. 
Minestrone soup was great.. Bruschetta was over baked but the toppings were amazing.
Caesar Salad was refreshing with the taste of sun dried tomatoes still playing on my mind.
Pizza Primavera was true to its details provided in the menu. I would love to have more toppings of veggies on the same but the taste was authentic and the base was rightly baked. Here I would suggest them to scatter Sun-dried Tomatoes instead of placing them in a single line as they end up being on only 2 slices in the whole pizza.
Virgin Mojito was good though lacked the punch. I guess good fresh mint leaves are not available this time. 
The desserts were actually icing on the cake of the entire dinner experience. They tasted as good as tempting they looked.. First time had a Pastry (Jupiter) with edible glitter on it.. And the Fresh Fruit pastry was fresh enough to melt in the mouth..
Although I was lost finding the way and though Zomato is a bit responsible for the same but even the owners of the place should have taken the pain to get it corrected. 
The address is P-596, Hindustan Park Road. The location shown on Map is perfect.
Overall a great experience.
All the Best to the management for their venture.
Keep up the good work..
Looking forward to be there again very soon..

I visited this outlet twice once for breakfast and the salad with fried bacon was awesome and had grilled chicken on my second visit with garlic bread which was delicious too.
The ambiance was awesome too and there's cozy french decor. 

But they refused to serve me apple pie or chocolate pie and they had some pre cooked desert with brownie that they were trying to sell forcibly and I didn't like the desert. So I deducted 1.5 stars for this malified business practice which otherwise was courteous and well behaved experience from the staff.

Surprisingly spacious inside, pretty good Focaccia sandwiches and up to the mark coffee and tea. Will be back soon for English breakfast. Btw spic n span french decor minus the french beauties. Price wise, value for money. Definitely worth trying out irrespective time of the day.

I spent Valentine's day evening at Delices, with Rachit Lakhmani playing and singing the music of seventies... And let me tell I was more than delighted and had an amazing time with my husband. Candle light, roses, heart shaped baloons, they had it all...that the ladies were looking for. I would say on a regular day, their ambience is what will get them higher scores. They have the vintage style wrought iron (though very comfortable) furniture plus a few very comfy sofa seats. Menu for the day was pretty limited and the guys serving were ... , yes a little sloppy and did not bother to bring in the consequent items on time and we were looking for the hiding fellows to remind them. But yeah I'd say food was good, though my hubby wasn't very fond of his vegetarian menu for Valentine's day(it was very limited). On regular days, their menu is pretty exhaustive. The owner (I thought so) took special interest, so there... all the attention seekers..You've got ur man... ! He tries his best to give it a personal touch. I'd even say you could go there to get treated well and have sinful bites...!
P.S. Rachit Lakhmani was an awesome find and his presence of mind, music choice was all just the icing on the top!

Ok... I am surprised.... thanks to zomato and the people i follow for their reviews of this place that i got to go visit them.... this place is located walking distance of 4 building near my house.... never visited them once and would just pass... i have to say i was fairly surprised and happy... after the likes of garden cafe and wise owl and azad hind opening near my house i am happy to get another star in the neighborhood... 

Lets start with the people... the owner was there and he took personal interest in us and got us the seats and everything organized which was very good... the waiters were very helpful and nice and courteous in every way... the service is a little sloppy and takes a long time for no reason.... but it is manageable...

Next the food... the minestrone soup was fantastic in every way and we were begging for more... the chilli cheese toast was ok.. it was made on a bruchetta bread... had no layer of tomato sauce which is lacked... the PIzza was very very good... to the likes of the best in kolkata for italian... they put sun dried tomatoes and olives and everything.... so the food though a little rich is amazing in this place...

The ambiance of this place is another plus point... from low sofas to proper tables... to the canvases on the wallas to the lighting.... to the big screen tv and the clean open kitchen.... everything was amazing.... 

Over and above the place is very good.... though it is not extremely cheap and well priced... but for the food it is just great.... i wish they could serve wine with their food and that would sort th deal totally....

i am sure for another visit soon to try their burgers which looks like they are going to be proper ones and not the main stream ones which are available...

all in all a wonderful time and a great place with amazing food....

brilliant food ! very poor service . 

On seeing pictures and reading some really good reviews a friend and i decided to hop into this place for lunch. I was in the area and decided to step in. 

To begin with, I loved the front entrance . The 3d kitchen themed wall art is very innovative. The chess board floor and wrought iron furniture.. the art work all are beautiful .. i feel the sofas just go exactly against the decor as do the choice of drapes a beautiful wine colored satin drape would have complimented the decor much more . 

The gentleman ( i guess the owner) was very courteous and seated us well and took our order . We were very happy with the food as well .. 

our order was as follows: 

Chicken Corn Chowder: 2/5 ; Not that it tasted bad it was nothing but a cream of chicken soup with  roasted corn in it . A chowder, as far as i know is supposed to a rustic chunky soup. Hearty like a broth ... very disappointing ! 

The bruschetta platter was brilliant 5/5 for that all three variants ( tomato basil. roasted bell pepper and garlic , and mushroom ) were great . One of the best platters i have had in a very long time . 

The iced tea was decent as was the americano. the ice tea tasted good when sipped from the glass but when had from the straw it was warm . 

The meat lasagna as recommended by the gentleman was brilliant ! but when  the server tried to serve it he literally picked it up by the layer .  I got irritated and chose to serve it myself . 5/5 for the food taste 

Then came the fungi pizza what was decent but the waiter was unable to serve it as well ... said SORRY SIR BOHOT CHEESY HO GAYA !  so i served it myself again . but it tasted nice 3.5/5 for it. 

Over all all the food tasted really nice ... just that the service was very sloppy. for the prices and the theme we expected better service. The portion sizes are great ... the live kitchen was very neat and clean. 

Also with the entire french theme ... pretty much the entire menu is Italian and american ! not much France Happening ... Also very ugly cakes in the display ! especially the blue mermaid ! 

Kudos to the chef ! he was very sweet and came and asked us how the food was and we said it was nice . which it was.

La Maison Des Delices located just off Southern Avenue is a nice Bistro/Cafe/Bakery that has opened up. We visited for lunch yesterday and it was a mixed bag of sorts. Though the waiters are enthusiastic they are not too well informed about the various dishes. We ordered the Delices Classic Lamb Burger and the Pork Chops au Poivre for our main course. The Lamb Burger was something I was looking forward to because the Chef informed me that they make a mutton mince incased in potato mash like a mutton chop instead of the regular burger patty and it sounded interesting for a change , however though it was fairly generous in terms of size it was totally lacking in salt and had barely any lamb and too much potato. The Pork Chop too though it looked very impressive was a bit on the tough side and fairly bland though the mash potatoes that accompanied it were excellent. For dessert we ordered the Bailey's Parfait which was quite nice and large enough to be shared. The presentation of all the dishes was excellent but they lacked punch in terms of flavor. The Chef however was receptive to our feedback and I hope to enjoy better flavors on my next visit. Pricing is quite good and so is the ambiance.

Amore Mio!

La Maison Des Delices is a foodlover's paradise once you discover this place, something that happened to me yesterday evening.
We were walking towards Magpie's when J and I spotted this uptown patisserie. Of course, the first thought that crossed our mind was to try it but I did not know it would happen this early.

Delices is a beautifully made patisserie and they have themed Old Calcutta.
The chandeliers, the paintings and the furnitures, all depict Old Calcutta with a hint of perfection !
The staff is very amiable and helpful and also offers very good suggestion. 
Here's what we ordered :

1. Roasted corn and chicken chowder
2. Stuffed Foccacia (non veg)
3. Bailey's Parfait

Now, the soup was creamy and thick with a subtle hint of mildness to it. Not very spicy yet warm and nice. They also provided soup sticks with it. The proportions are good.
The stuffed sandwich was the stuffiest thing I ever had. It was BIG and warm and tasted really good. It was stuffed with chicken, bell peppers and pesto sauce. With it, came a salad and home style fries.
The sandwich is bug enough for two average eaters. Priced at 195/- this is a complete catch.
And, do not forget the dessert, in our case it was Bailey's parfait which was out of this world, amazingly awesome.
YES, HIGH CALORIE ALERT!
It comprised of chocolate, french cream, yes bailey's ofcourse and nuts. And it was heaven. Make some space in the tummy.  :D

The patisserie outside looks convincing and hence, I shall be back for more.
Amazing food, good ambience.
Oh and did I forget they had "Hallejuah"  as the background score while I ate.

Prices : moderate :)

You game ?

Cheers. :)

This is THE place for coffee, pastries, english breakfast and Italian/conti dinner with your family. Loved the art gallery style decor, coffee table jazz and the food completely. Highly recommend the place for the their quality+quantity and price. Try the chingri cutlet, bacon wrapped prawns with their special Pesto mix and honey mustard sauce - yummy...

We visited this place for a breakfast on a lazy Sunday morning. We came to know of its existence through Zomato, but as the café was off by a street in the Zomato map, it took some time to locate the place. We ordered for Creamy Garlic Mushroom on Toast, Bacon and Fried Eggs. Mushroom on toast, a pair of crispy toast in a mushroom and cream sauce, was nicely done. Bacon was optimally juicy and substantial, both in the amount and in the cut. It was not over-fried as it is the case often. We finished our meal with Hot Chocolate. The drink that was served was a little flat but an extra serving of molten chocolate was served alongside to make it to our taste. 

This was our first visit to the café and we came out quite satisfied.

Set in the heart of South Kolkata, is this excellent cafe. The cafe has a unique ambiance, not found in today’s architecture. The food is superb.  The confectionery and the kitchen are within the same area. The food is fresh along with their cakes and pastries. They have their own live breaking oven, where the bread is baked fresh. It’s something really new, which indeed fascinated me. The place is very clean, with a sign of happiness.  I wish them all the best. We will soon be back.
