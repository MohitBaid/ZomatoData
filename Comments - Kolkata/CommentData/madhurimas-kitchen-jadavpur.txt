Ordered Chelo Kebabs from Madhurima's Kitchen. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. The food arrived on time neatly packed. I have to admit that the taste was authentic.  The Kebabs were soft , juicy and done to perfection.  The portions were also much more than I expected. There was a complimentary mocktail to wash it down. They are very professional and very good.

Food: Delicious and absolutely tasty preparations that keep you asking for more. You can't argue on the taste factor here, its a clean sweep. I am absolutely in love with the dishes here like Tandoori Momo and Tribal Chicken.

Service: Very prompt and spontaneous response without much hassle. No issues to complain about.
