I have tried all the flavours here... Corn lovers will love to revisit the corner ðŸ˜Š
Only one drawback never have I ever found all the flavours available together.. Except for this the corn tastes absolute bliss..

I very casually tried their panjabi zika and o boy it was amazing... a small joint with in the diamond plaza... nothing to say about the deco n ambience... staffs are very well mannered... service was very fast... pocket pinch was very very friendly...
