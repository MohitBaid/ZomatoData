Ordered chicken shawarma salad, hardly any chicken was there. 2nd item was chicken shawarma roll with red pepper sauce, I couldn't feel the red pepper taste. Both items we're disappointing. Had tried these items in South City mall, which was much much better. 

This is like cheating, if there is hardly any chicken in chicken shawarma salad.

This was the second time I had food from here!

The chicken Shawarma is really really good! Have a try! You won't regret it!

Tried chicken sandwich, didn't like it that much! Could be improved a lot! The mayonnaise was very less in it and filled with vegetables! Not upto the expectations

The momo was also really good! Felt like someone had made it in home! :) really nice.

Dropped at this place to try out their stuffed chicken wrapped in pita bread - satisfied with the chicken portion used as filling. The bread quality was good. I would also recommend to try out their biriyani which is healthy - with less oil, but tasty. Service is bit slow.

I am pleased with this small little place located in New Alipore, between Taratala and Triangular Park, just opposite Corporation Bank. Decent food. I liked the stuffing inside the Chicken Shawarma Wrap. The mayonnaise used was awesome. The shawarma comes with an option of 3 sauces, white, red and green. Chicken Grilled Sandwich was good too. Just I felt it could have been better without the use of cucumber. The lady managing this place is so nice and polite. Prices are reasonable. Overall, good experience.

Lebanese outlet located at one of the corners of New Alipore lanes. Food here is decent. I have recently got their Chicken Shawarma Wrap delivered home. The pitta was a bit under. However their filling and their red pepper sauce was done okay. I'd give it one go if I were you!

I saw this tiny outlet while I was driving .. So I just popped it and ordered a chicken shawarma wrap with white sauce and got it parcelled .. For 90 INR I thought it was decent .. Generous quantity of chicken which I loved and their white sauce was good .. . This place is good for home deliveries as it does not provide seating. It doesn't stand out at all so you might just miss it ..

The first Lebanese outlet in New Alipore, I have eaten here a few times & funny enough, the quality of the food has been different each time. I have tried the Chicken Shawarma Wrap, Chicken Shawarma Salad & Veggie Patty Wrap. The first time, the wraps and the salads were quite good & I was glad to have found a good Lebanese place close to where I live. However, the next time when I ate there, the salad was too high on the spice content (inspite of mine telling them to keep it at minimum) & also the taste was nowhere near the first time. There is not enough space for eating there so it mostly works as a takeaway place. Given the boom in the number of Lebanese eateries in the city & this being the sole one in New Alipore, it can improve a great deal by focusing on the food quality and probably a bit more marketing as people who havenâ€™t passed by it, barely know it exists!
