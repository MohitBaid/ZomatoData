I was having a boring Christmas this time staying away from home.While scrolling tomato with a hungry tummy I discovered this amazing food hub.Quite impressed with the well designed menu and the affordable price,I ordered multiple items.It was a zomato delivery.I started with a plate of chicken momos.The Momos were absolutely chicken filled and succulent.The soup was tasty but was a bit thick.Next came,the fish butter fly.This made me a li'l disappointed.The coating was thin and not properly fried lacked crispiness.But the fish fillet inside was good enough.I also ordered chicken fried rice and chicken Manchurian.Both were way too good.The quantity of rice was perfect for two.I would definitely order from this place again for sure.

I've ordered from swiggy when I heard it's in my locality and a friend suggested it's really doing well.
I must say it's cheap and very tasty.
The shawarna roll is so so good it's a must try and it fills you up with enough chicken chunks.
And the TFK noodles is very good in portion with good chicken chunks but the taste coudve been better. 
And other dishes like chilly Chicken and all had a different anti Chinese taste more like Lebanese.
Overall considering the price point it's awesome.

Since I've only taken home delivery from this restaurant, so my rating is based on food quality, taste and delivery. The packing and delivery is up to standard, nothing special. The chicken shawarma roll is delicious and a definite steal at the price of 70 only. However the special shawarma roll didn't taste quite so good as we felt that the addition of egg ruined it's taste. Overall definitely going to order again to try the other items.

Baguiati lacks proper quick bites restaurant but this newly built restaurant helps me to serve my purpose.

Location - A 5 minutes walk from Baguiati will take you to this food junction. To be more specific it is located near chawlpatty. One might face difficulty to locate but once you locate you will love to visit this place again and again.

Ambiance - It is a small restaurant serving foods with outdoor sitting. The behaviour of the staffs and the chef is also pleasing.

Food - Since I am an ardent lover of good foods, I visit this place on a regular basis.
Even I have tasted most of the food items they prepare.

The items which I tasted are as follows :
1)TFK special chicken noodles (4.5/5) : I love this item. The taste and quantity of food is equally pleasing.
2) Boneless Chicken pakora (4.5/5)
3) Chicken pakora tossed in hot garlic sauce (5/5)
4) Steamed momos(4.5/5) : If you visit this place then you must try this as the momos they serve is tasty and filled properly with chicken and the soup is also good.
Only one problem is that the quantity of soup they give in home delivery is very low due to their container size.
5) Chicken fried rice (3.5/5)
6) Fish butter fry (5/5) : The fry tasted awesome and I prefer to eat this item whenever I go.
7) Szechuan drums(4/5)
8) Sawarma salad(5/5)

I would ask every new visitor to eat the sawarma salad, butter fry and chicken pakora in hot garlic sauce.You can also try their sawarma roll too.
Overall it's a good experience since it's located near my house and I love to visit this place every evening.
One more thing it's very pocket friendly too.

I would recommend every people residing in Baguiati to visit this place.
You can also order food from here via swiggy too.

You don't get better food at such unbelievable rates than this anywhere else in Baguiati. Undoubtedly the best place for quality food without burning a hole in your pockets. Hands down.

Being a shawarma lover, I'm always looking for new places for shawarma. So came across this place closer home today, located in chalpatty area. This will be at your right side from chalpatty towards shyamnagar, the Mehndi banquet being few steps ahead of it.

The shawarma tasted okayish, not the one to die for. Mustard is unacceptable in shawarma acc. to me! It had cheese, a lot of chicken and veggies but the bread was thin. I love much more mayo than they gave in my shawarma.
 
(PS. I had it for the 2nd time and this time ordered it to be made without mustard. The quality has improved, and it was all mayonnaise and chicken and veggies and I totally loved it this time and would recommend it.)

However their noodles and steamed momo,especially the soup that comes with it were amazingly delicious.We brought them home for which they provided nice plastic containers which is hardly expected given the low cost of the food. So it's definitely a thumbs up!

Its a newly opened tiny food joint in the baguiati market. Its a hard to notic shop because of its odd location. It is situated in the middle of so many rice shops of Chawal Patty. I have tried their "Chicken Swarma Roll" & "Chicken Steamed Momo". Both were mouth watering and very awsome. One thing I would like mention, they send very small amount of momo soup, quantity of this should be increased. Anyway, I will try their other foods. You are doing a good job The Flavours King. Keep it up.

The shop is located in Baguiati Chawal patty area .. Anybody can easily locate it ...about few minutes walk from Baguiati bus stop. I have tried their chicken shawarma roll .. the taste is out of bound ..chicken ,salad and mayonnaise are blended in exactly right proportions ...the bread used is also very soft ...last but not the least it costs only 70 bucks ...
Thus any one looking for taste at pocket friendly zone ...they must give a try to The Flavours King

This is a place which could satisfy anyone with everything..be it your taste buds or your money.. Apart from being pocket friendly.. The food is just too good and fresh with appropriate quantity..a small joint located in a place where you can hardly find anything good to eat..well no worries now.. this is the place to go..the chef is polite and gentle which gives you a friendly feeling..i don't think people who loves food will ever get disappointed ordering from here.. üëå..

just awesome ... its really Flavours king.. m loving it.. would definitely recommend this outlet to everyone..and i wish to go every day if possible..good job guys.. & i want to tell you one thing if your team making some food for Gym peoples & fitness peoples then so be very happy..

In Calcutta there are still no outlets that make fitness food or Gym food..(high protein food like ¬†boil broccoli or grilled broccoli ,grilled chicken , rice or brown rice etc... its like combo pack. )
It's now started in Mumbai. . It's always available abroad.. I would like you to think about this big thing..

Yesterday I had the non veg noodles it was tasty,, difent taste from others,, they serve the noodles in a bowl not in a plate like others fast food shop,, the shop is clean and it's look hygienic and the the boy who made the noodle he worked in 5stars hotel as a chef... But I think they should have more items,, after all taste is the king so I enjoyed the food.. Will visit again......

Few days back i had been there..It's located in the chawalpatti area of baguiati market place..easy to spot.. We had tried the Sawarma salad and butterscotch milkshake.. the milkshake was light and yummy..just perfect! Where as the salad was a big dissapointment! with bigger chunks of onions than a mouthfull and bland.. i really did not like it at all.. whereas i will for sure visit the outlt again for the milkshake!
