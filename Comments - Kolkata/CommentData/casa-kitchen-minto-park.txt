The much hyped veg restaurant turned out to be a fault in itself.
I went with my family and ordered yellow dal,steam rice , kulcha, tandoori roti , mix vegetable and aloo ka sabzi and it turned out that the food was full disaster and the quality of food wasn't good either!
The management should look into matter and make sure that the food should be nicely cooked in gas rather than oven 
Bad very bad!

Never had such bland food. Awfully tasteless gratin , vegetables weren't cooked properly. Bland paneer butter masala. Kulcha had more of cinnamon than potato masala.

Casa Kitchen from inside looks like a Corporate Dining Restaurant,very Formal sort of Ambience.Coming to the Food we tried their "Paneer 65" which was chef special for the day and was it too good.We also tried its Chinese Bhel which was good but nothing special as such.Coming to main Course we tried its Malai Kofta,Naan and Kulcha which were pretty satisfactory.Also Tried Biryani which was also good.Impressed with Service,Kinda Fast.
Need to improve the Quantity keeping in mind the price they are charging.

An abode for vegans. Very seldom you find such a tasty retreat at a veg restaurant. The food is amazingly good, the right portion sizes, the temperature and especially the taste. Loved it. 
Now coming to the staff, they are extremely courteous and helpful. It has a good liquor collection as well. Valet parking is available which is highly required in that area. Table reservations recommended on weekends. 
Food menu that we tried included paneer tikka, spring roll, noodles, Manchurian, lasagna and few other mouth watering dishes. Great going.

First things first, the restaurant has a pretty nice decor. Having said that, I must also mention that service was quite slow and much better was expected.
                  I had penne arbbiata pasta, chilli garlic noodles, naan, paneer butter masala and chocolate mud pie. Food was pretty average according to me and I've had much better elsewhere at this price.The dessert was pretty good though.

FINAL VERDICT- One may give it a try,but I personally had higher expectations.

Being a hard core Non-Vegetarian, sometimes I do like to have Vegetarian Food...Yes obviously I don't like to have it at home, but if it's a good restaurant, I love to have it. I mean I love it.
So my foodie mind along with my fellow foodie members of TEAM PANCH PHORON stopped hunting here and tasted some awesome super yummilecious food.
We have tasted all of the dishes from their PUJA MENU.

I have so many friends who do NAVRATRI, I'll suggest them to come here to enjoy the gala lunch and dinner.

We have tasted over 25 dishes where there were continental to chinese to Indian. And each and every dish was a show stopper.

So don't think much just hop to this place and fill your empty 'stomach with some good food.

here is teh glimpse of their PUJA MENU 2017 :

MOCK-TAILS-

● MAID MARION : this was a red colored drink that will distract you to have it more and more.

● CUCUMBER AND CURRY LEAF LEMONADE : this is another drink that I had for the first time.  I never tasted curry leaves in a drink before I had it. And trust me after finishing one glass I asked for another one.

SOUPS- 

● VEG SWEET CORN SOUP - this was normal sweet corn sweep.

● VEG MANCHOW SOUP - though it was a manchow soup, we ate the chowmein part and the soup differently though we were supposed to have ot all together

STARTERS- 

● HARA BADAMI KEBAB - it was green ring shaped kebabs that was served as sizzler. In every bite of it you can feel the essence of peanut and spinach

● PANEER CHILLY CHEESE TIKKA - it was a mixture variant of chilli paneer and paneer cheese tikka kebab that was served again with sizzler. And the smell of burnt charcol made it win the match 

● PANEER 65 - it was super yummy and supper tasty. Though it was my first try for any veg 65 dish, I would love to recommend this to anybody anytime

● PANEER TIKKA - I don't need to write much about Tikka I guess. But what I must tell you that is, Paneer Tikka serving in a sizzler plate can bring water in your mouth anytime.

● SHAHI BHARWAN ALOO

● CHINESE BHEL 

CONTINENTAL-

● FOUR CHEESE PASTA - Pasta is my all time favorite. So this was basically white sauce Pasta with whole lot of cheese. So if you are not in strict diet please have it without a second thought.

● PENNE ARABBIATA - it was the red sauce pasta. It had a tangy taste. 

MAIN COURSE-

● DAAL CASA - It is Casa's one of the signature dishes. So if you are ordering Indian Menu please don't forget to order this.

● DUM ALOO

● PINDI CHHANA

● PANEER BUTTER MASALA

● HARIYALI KOFTA

● MALAI KOFTA

● NAAN 

● VEG BIRIYANI - Basically I can't think Biriyani without chicken or mutton, but yes if you are offering me this biriyani I'll never say NO.

● CHILLY GARLIC NOODLES - I always love asian food. So chinese dishes are my all time favorite. Be it a veg or non veg. I just loved it.

● EXOTIC VEG IN HUNAN SAUCE - And as I love vegetables, this dish played like a yorker of the match.
 
●PAPAD

DESSERTS- 

● CHOCOLATE BROWNIE

● TOOTIE FROOTIE

For now all I can say enjoy pujo and happy tummy..

Thank you Casa Kitchen and Rajdeep Bhattacharjee for the invitation..
I love food and I'm a Panch Phoron forever..

Casa Kitchen is a famous restaurant located at Hotel Casa Fortuna, 234/1, A.J.C. Bose Road, Minto Park, Kolkata. As the name suggests it serves the very famous and delicious North Indian Punjabi delicacies, which are rich in flavor  with spicy preparations and traditional to the core. I have been here with Team Panchphoron to attend their Durga Puja food menu launch. As we entered, they have beautiful, spacious ambiance. Comfortable seating areas with enough space for movement. Very cozy and warmth.  The vibrant colors used on the table gives you such positive vibes that you start liking the place even before eating anything.  The seating too is quite spacious and comfy. The dishes that we went to try were from their newly launched Durga Puja Menu, so obviously they were gonna be nice.
                                                                ...

Really a good place to visit with family.
Thumbs up : The interiors are really nice. The place is comforting and really makes u feel happy and delighted. Talking of the matter which matters the most, Food is just fantastic. We ordered the usual family dinner, roti dal and sabzi, the items we ordered were basic but I must say they turned the basic orders into a satisfying meal. U will leave the place happy and satisfied.

Thumbs down : nothing much really , the prices are fine, food is great the feel of the restaurant is very good.

Facilities : valet services which is actually a very good facility keeping in mind the location, which is very busy and will have a hard time in getting a parking spot.

Cost for 2 : 900-1000

Fingerliking food, friendly waiters, though improvemnts should be made in the seating and ambiance.
Most apt place for vegetarian foodies. It is placed at a good location. top notch restaurant and will surely come back again. Really impressed!!
You should especially try 'shahi bharwa aloo' and the 'paneer mountain'. The 'dal Casa' will surely make your mouth water.

I am staying in Casa Fortuna the same hotel which houses this Casa Kitchen. After a tiring journey reached at around 9 in the night and ordered paneer tikka for starters and jeera rice and Dal Casa (their name for dal makhani). The food presentation was good and the taste was excellent. Only the tandoori chutney needs some fine tuning.

Wanted to visit this place since ages but hesitated as the rating given on Zomato is only 3.8
I don't know what makes people not give a 5 star rating to this place because this place deserves more than that.
Food served here is extremely good, from taste to quality it is 5/5 
We ordered Pina-Nina which is basically a sweet cocktail made of pineapple juice and is one of the best cocktails served in the city. It is a must try. 
In the main course we ordered  tandoori roti and 
Paneer butter masala which was absolutely delicious.
Lastly we ordered blueberry cheese cake. 
Our overall experience at casa kitchen was fabulous and we would definitely visit this place again :)

Though the prices are a bit on the higher side, the food is delicious, to say the least. We ordered masala onion dosa, chilli garlic noodles, kadai paneer as the main course. In soup, we ordered vegetable sweet corn soup, minestrone soup and cream of mushroom soup. In desserts, we had chocolate mud pie, chocolate brownie, chocolate mousse and blueberry cheese cream cake. The main course was okay but the soup was delicious. And the desserts were simply wow! I would definitely recommend the yummy heavenly desserts.

This place is one of the best fine dining restaurants you will get when you are in and around central kolkata.

Location : Very easy to locate . Just beside Tewari Brothers Minto park branch. 3 mins walk from Forum Mall.

Food -

1. Chinese Bhel - I have hated this particular item all my life , but the bhel we were served here was good to be honest . If I like it anyone else would just love it. 4/5

2. Vegetable Lasagna - This was the showstopper. Loaded with cheese and perfectly grilled . I almost had the full plate myself . This is highly recommended. 5/5

3. Dahi ke Kebab - The Kebab Festival was on full swing when we visited. We tried their Dahi ke kebab which was mind-blowing to say the least . Extremely soft and you could feel all the flavours as it slowly melts in your mouth. 5/5

4. Virgin Mojito - The only thing that disappointed. The mocktail tasted like ENO. Maybe an off day for the guy preparing drinks . 1/5

Service : OK so this is an important point and hope they take notice . Service is very prompt and all staff are very helpful BUT they need to understand that being extra clingy with the customers is irritating sometimes . Every two minutes they would want to serve everything on our plates even after being told not to worry about it . I hope the management takes note . 3/5

Pocket Pinch : Slightly on the expensive side but the ambience and hospitality makes up for it .4/5

We ordered manchow and sweet corn soup, American corn salt and pepper, paneer tikka, jhaal farezi, aloo do pyaaza, matar methi malai, rotisserie and biryani and veg pula. All the items were good except aloo do pyaza. The service was fast and good. Overall a good experience.

A few days back one of our friends wanted to know where in Kolkata could one find the defining Punjabi meal of Makki di roti and Sarson da saag. We gladly suggested a few places and he was happy with the food. Then my parents went on a trip to Amritsar last month and had the delicacy themselves and I was now literally craving for some Punjabi food myself.
                                                                ...

I had visited this restaurant few months ago with my family on the recommendation of my son Rishabh - a food reviewer on Zomato and we had enjoyed awesome foods and courteous services. 

My 2nd visit was today with family and we had enjoyed again some tasty foods our selection for starter was :
Cream of Mashroom Soup - a white cream based delicious nice sweet soup. 
Minestrone Soup - a tomato based tangy soup with vegetables. 
Tandoor Mashroom - a tasty Mashroom buttons filled with cream and properly cooked in tandoor, served in hot plates with salads and green chutney.

For lunch we preferred Paneer Tikka Labbadar, Aloo do Payaza with Garlic Nan, Tandoori Lacha Paratha and Tandoori rotis. foods was good but we had got better food experience during our first visit. restaurant  need little attention to maintain same food quality. 
However this restaurant is excellent in ambiance, service and food and I love to visit again.

We ordered  Cream of Mushroom soup, Crispy Chilly Baby Corn, Chilli Garlic Noodles and Vegetable Manchurian, items were of top notch both in quality and quantity...in dessert ordered blue berry cheese cake, pocket pinch was not that heavy.

We visited this place to try the corporate lunch menu which is served during the weekdays.
The ambience is nice and classy. The restaurant is well lit and is divided in various sections.
Moving over to food- 1 corporate lunch can be shared and they serve it in 3 different cuisines, namely Continental, Chinese and North Indian to choose from.
We opted for 2 corporate lunch combos thinking that the quantity would not be sufficient, but Oh Boy!! It was more than just sufficient for us and we had to get some packed.

Our favourite picks from the combo is:-

Cream of mushroom soup- Nice and creamy !

Garlic Bread- Perfect crunch with loads of garlic and butter on the top

Veg Florentine- Spinach based, white sauce dish was very cheesy and creamy. The veggies were fresh and delicious.

Penne in Arabiata sauce was a perfect bite! It was penne tossed in rich tomato sauce!

We also ordered two mocktails Pina Nina and April Lady.
Pina Nina was a virgin pina colada but was extra sweet. It could have been little less sweeter.

April Lady was a combination of mangoes and coconut milk. It was very refreshing and tasty.

Overall our experience was a nice one here, the staff is nice and courteous.

P.S.- Order only one combo if you are two people, else it will be too much to eat!

This is a proper Family Vegetarian Restaurant located near Minto Park. One would often see anniversary and birthday treats been given here. Coming to the food, the tomato soup we had was quite sweet and had lack of any sour and salt in it. We had to return it. Starters was delicious. Paneer tikka & Crispy Chilli babycorn was to the mark. In the main course, i.e. North Indian we had Paneer Butter Masala which was good, Kashmiri Aloo Dum the best out of th three and  Malai Kofta was okayish. Breads were crippy. Jeera Rice and Peas Pulao did not disappoint. Moreover, Dal Makhani had a hand in making the total experience good. Being mostly a family regular place, the ambience is also quiet and a bit sophisticated. 
If you are looking for group bookings and budget friendly restaurants then this is the right place.

On my first visit way back in 2015 during Durga Pujo, we had fallen in love with this place, being strictly nonvegetarians we were impressed with their veg dishes..dal casa,hara bhara kabab,cream of mushroom soup, crispy fried baby corns.. However on our second visit this year on Maha Shivratri we were disappointed with the service.. The place was over crowded.. The staff seemed to be struggling to manage.. We had to keep waiting for a glass of water.. No one refilled it.. Food was good as always but we received masala kulcha when we had ordered for a plain one..so that explains it all..

Casa Kitchen is one of the best veg restaurants in Calcutta. If you come here, you must try dal casa, authentic black dal preparation and very tasty. They have a bar counter also. Well stocked.

Went to casa kitchen last week. I have been here earlier too n had loved it on those two visits. 
Its a nice clean restaurant. The waiters are attentive. The manager came twice to our table to enquire about the food. 
We had ordered tomato soup which unluckily was little too sour. 
The kebab platter was decent. It had 2 piece each of paneer tikka, tandoori aalo n 3 other items. I didn't find it too great. 
The butter naan n kulcha was soft. Though a little more stuffing in the kulcha would have made it great. Paneer tikka masala was good. Dal makhni was superb. 
Overall a pleasant experience.

One of the best vegetarian restaurants in the city of joy, which lived upto our expectation. This vegetarian gem is located right in the heart of the city, Minto Park offering excellent service and ambience. The kabab platter served the purpose of pampering our taste buds, we never seen such a variety of kabab in the cuisine, followed with yummy butter kulcha, dal casa, paneer butter masala. For desserts one cannot go without the mudpie that they offer. Overall a thumbs up for the entire setup and not to forget the warm hospitality.

Bengalis don't like to visit veg restaurants. It's just one of those universal truths. Casa Kitchen, will however delightfully surprise you- whether you're a Bengali or a Non-Bengali. 
I tried their Paneer Pukhtan from their Boishakhi menu with Plain Rice. With that I ordered Tropical Summer mocktail, to wash down my dishes. My orders were done spectacularly. And the service was very fast too. Extremely pleased with the entire experience. Best wishes goes out to the team!

More surprising was that they have a well stocked bar with high end brands dotting their shelves. We had a couple of drinks and the starters we ordered with it were simply finger licking. The dahi ke kabab and crispy chilly baby corn needs a special mention. Prices are also reasonable. Could not taste the main course, but would definately like try them in near future

Have been here couple of times or more every time at the end i have a feeling to come here once again.
North Indian cuisine is at its best from Dal Casa to paneer to breads everything is just delicious! Not to forget the Continental and Italian cuisine a perfect blend of taste and has mouthwatering dishes in this section of cuisine.

This is one of the fastest serving restaurants. We all know about the waiting lines in the Restaurant, on Sundays in Kolkata and none of us likes waiting because it kills the mood and by the time, it's our number on the list, the hunger goes Bhooommm!

But here, you wouldn't have to wait for long, plus their service is too quick. 
It's a nice family dining restaurant with quick service and good food.

The Food is good! Maybe less gravy in your mixed vegetables as they overpower the subji. Also, maybe offer more options with no onion and garlic as nearly everything on the menu contained those.

One of the worst places been to ,the service is pathetic.The waiters are rude and unpleasant . It took 20 mins Just to get  3 tandoori Rotis .We had to change the Food 2 times because the food was not cooked properly. Do not visit the restaurant Unless you have a compulsion... Would rate this 2 or maybe 1 ....

I went there last night with my family. All the dishes served were substandard. When we wanted them to change a dish , first they argued and then when then changed it we got to taste something far worse. I have never tasted sweet noodles anywhere so this was a first. Also these cheese paneer dish did not have a flavour of paneer. Further more the vegetable platter had hardly 2 exotic vegetables and it was more of a main course than a starter. This starter was suggested by them only. So I was very disappointed. We had gone there to celebrate a birthday and it was totally spoiled. Further I experienced stomach problems I'm the morning. So just think about going here.

One of the best restaurants by far for pure veg food. The decor too is quite impressive, with a busy street view from the tainted glass , though this does not impact the noise level inside the restaurant, by any manner. The diners can somehow increase the noise level as have often seen kitty parties taking place in the same.

My personal likes from the food we have ordered in the past

Veg hot and sour soup (never had any veg soup so tasty as this, can give any other non veg soup a run for its money) 
Hari bhari malai kofta
Butter Naan (which is so soft and tasty and prepared to perfection, to say the least)
Hara Bhara Kabaab
Dal Casa 
Paneer Butter Masala (the paneer bits are usually just too good and super soft)
Sweet Fresh Lime Soda (which is perfectly blended and has a refreshing taste)

Haven't tried to much variety here but definitely a must visit place for all vegetarians in Kolkata.

Now how have I missed reviewing this place. As my dad fondly calls it his "favorite-ist" of places. Casa kitchen is the F&B outlet at Hotel Casa Fortuna on Sarah Bose Road ( the crossing that leads you to elgin/forum. The property is small but accommodating and the restaurant is on level one.
One of the best places for vegetarians in the city!

In my countless visits I have tried their North Indian, buffet breakfast and continental

Standouts-
• Grilled pineapple which comes in a handi
• Paneer Tikka which is juicy and succulent
•Dal Makhni, cooked to smoky perfection
• Veg lasagne, which though a little heavy, has always been my favorite order.
• Cheesy potatoes which I prefer here out of any other place
• Paneer Tikka butter masala
• Veg biriyani, perfectly cooked dum style.

The service here, however is a little problematic. Also the restaurant is small and a little congested.

Ignoring the minor cons, Casa Kitchen is a perfect place for a nice dinner with the fam.

This was recommended by a friend but I got to try it out recently. 
The ambience and service area definitely pretty good. I was expecting more of an Italian pizzeria from name somehow, turns out they have a lot of good Indian stuff. We tried their soups and a couple of appetizers. They were not serving main course as we went at an odd hour. 
I would love to come back again.

Been here this past Sunday with a friend, liked the simplicity and location of the restaurant, food could be better. we ordered 1 Paneer Kadhai which was okay, i think the vegetable should have been cut a bit small, like capsicum were not properly cut to be eaten at a time, also we had Corn Palak which was a bit spicy, otherwise it was good. Among breads, we chose to have Masala Naan, which was quite good and unique in taste, Pudhina Lachha paratha which was also quite awesome, Masala Kulcha was not that good in comparison to the 2 breads I mentioned. Overall Dining here wasn't a disappointment.

Best thing about this place is the courteous staff . One of the best services offered. We went there fir dinner on Dussehra food was awesome . I recommend ppl to try Cheese paneer tikka & manchow soup next time if you visit this place .
Only drawback was that being a puja day we got a table near the kitchen & the sound of the cutlery was too annoying . Ignoring that it's one of the best place I have been in Kolkata.

Went to this place for the second time. Again, for breakfast. They start at sharp 7am, which is very good. The place was stark empty with properly set tables. We went for a la carte instead of the buffet. The service was quick and professional. We ordered cheese corn on toast, cheese fritters, beans on toast, idli and club kachori. I like their club kachori a lot. Though the rest of the food was okay.

The place is definitely worth the visit. The entrance may be deceptive, but the interiors do live up the expectation. 
Food is good... And the service is quite prompt. 
The staff are cordial and ambience is great... 
Had the following items :
1. JODHPURI PANEER TIKKA : The preparation is great... Presentation is good and the taste is quite near to the tangy and spicy promise of Rajasthan cuisine. 
2. CORN CHILLY KABAB : This dish is very delicate to make. The kababs are always difficult... The chef here actually did justice to the dish. Worth the try. 
3. PANEER 65 : Well this dish was tried when I was almost full and hence shouldn't comment on the dish.... But yes... It was quite good in taste. 

All the above went with beer and obviously it's the best creation of human civilization.

So todae suddenly we planned to visit Casa Kitchen as my dearest daddy loves exploring new restaurants and he is a pure vegetarian🙏🏻
 So this place amazed me. The ambience and staffs and the manager were too good and friendly 😀😀
So we ordered Crispy Chilli Babycorn as our starter and it was just awesome crispy from outside nd soft from inside. We loved it and it had a different taste 👍🏻😍
And for main course we ordered Veg Biryani,American Corn And Four Cheese Pasta.... The Biryani was just yummy must better than the egg biryani or chicken (i just love chicken biryani) but yaa the veg biryani was sumthng different and lets come to American Corn my dad just loved it but as I don't like spinach so it was just okay for me 😀
And "THE FOUR CHEESE PASTA" was jusssssssstttttttt amazing and outstanding as they use four kinds of cheese-Cheddar,Parmesan,Gruyere and Mozzarella Cheese(believe me guys who are cheese lovers ❤️❤️💞 they should try this pasta) 
So thumps up Casa Kitchen i rate you 5 stars 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😀😀😀😀😀😘😘😘😘❤️

A vegetarian restaurant that is the ubiquitous multi cuisine one serving Indian, Chinese and Continental food. They don't seem to specialise in ant particular cuisine. But their food is good and tasty. The decor too is excellent. In fact when you walk into the restaurant after climbing a few stairs the decor speaks of class. But what I felt was lacking was the warmth..... I had arrived early for a group reservation and though I Waited for around twenty mins for others to arrive they didn't even bother to enquire for anything, other places they would have at least have asked if I wanted water! Since we went in the evening, we only had snacks, Chinese Bhel, crispy chilly baby corn,and panir sizzler. All were good. Tea too was well made.

Wanted to visit did place since long. One of the best vegetarian fares in Kolkata as on date. Loved d food. For starters we had paneer kababs Nd Dahi ke kabab. Have never tasted such succulent paneer kababs before. Dahi ke kabab was equally good. Main course consisted of veg Hakka noodles - tasted really good, vegetable polau, naan, methi malai corn - tasted amazing came with a rich gravy a bit on the sweeter side and last bt not the least paneer in red gravy wth matar Nd Alu - customised for us. All the food tat we ordered were without onion Nd garlic as my in laws are pure veg. For desserts we had chocolate mousse. Price is a bit on the higher side but won't pinch ur pocket much cause the Quality and quantity of the food compensates tat pretty well. Not to forget the cordial behaviour of the staffs. Overall a very rewarding gastronomic experience.

It's Raining Sizzlers @ Casa Kitchen, Kolkata ☺

Food Event: Escapade to Sizzler

Duration: 22 Dec 2017 to 1 Jan 2018

Timing: 12:30 pm to 11:00 pm

Armed with a bevy of 17 types of Sizzlers, Casa Kitchen, the popular vegetarian diner is all set to commemorate the Christmas to New Year span with a Sizzle. 

"Merging Indian and exotic international ingredients with the buzz of a Sizzle, the food festival is a delight for the ears, a sparkle for the eyes a relishing moment for the mouth! Every item on the specially curated menu - the appetizers, the main course and the dessert - all Sizzle!

Being invited for the pre-tasting session of the aforementioned food festival, I had a gala time viewing and at times eating the Sizzlers plated as - a platter of a particular cuisine, imitation of a popular non veg dish, vegetarian version of steaks, innovative preparation of a conventional item, an assortment of tandoori items, assorted cottage cheese preparations and the likes. 

Dips like green chutney and kasundi, sauces like barbeque,  arrabbiata, schezwan, manchurian, neapolitan, conjinaro and side dishes like parsley potato, sautéed veg, cheese balls, fried onions, mustard-onion etc. were used tactfully to garner a distinct character to each Sizzler. 

Being made in-house, the cottage cheese as and where present, was top notch i.e. fresh, soft and dense. 

My personal favourites turned out to be - 

- Barbeque Soya Steak: Two minced soya patties, topped with a generous portion of barbeque sauce, along with a side dish of parsley potato garnished with thinly sliced black olive roundels were served on an oval shaped sizzler plate. The patties were garnished with some cream, a sprig of greens, a tinned  cherry and some olive roundels. 

The steaks were quite well cooked, soft and chewy. The barbeque sauce was excellent, in fact much better than many skewers and sandwich centric eateries! Parsley potatoes were nice and filling.

- Vegetable Lollipop: Being a vegetarian, I was always amused by seeing the non vegetarians holding a Chicken Lollipop like a toothbrush and chomping it off from all sides in a jiffy. Barring the battlesome roasted corn cobs, I never really had any choice to replicate the aforementioned chomping off experience.

Thanks to Casa Kitchen, I was able to fulfill this dead wish of mine by chomping off their vegetarian avatar of Chicken Lollipop!

An oval sizzler plate containing six portions of Vegetable Lollipops along with a bowl of barbeque sauce and garnished with finely chopped spring onions was served. The holding stick aka the leg of the Lollipops was carved out of sugarcane and duly wrapped in shining silver paper!

The dish along with it's sauce tasted nice and chomping it off was sheer fun.

- Custard Pie: Not exactly a sizzler, it was a solitary piece of dessert, nevertheless served on an oval sizzler plate. It was a closed pie, garnished at the centre with a dollop of cream, which was further topped with a solitary canned cherry and a sprig of green.

The pie crust was uniformly baked, flaky and thankfully devoid of too much butter. The chocolate based filling along with the presence of finely chopped apples and the likes, tasted very much like a Christmas Cake!

It was something different and tasted wonderful.

Corporate Lunch Tasting @ Casa Kitchen - Casa Fortuna, Kolkata, India ☺

Keeping in mind, the time constraint and food taste of corporate personnels, i.e. no fuss no frill but hale and hearty comfort food, Casa Kitchen, the popular veg restaurant cum bar has introduced 5 course fixed lunch menus in 3 different cuisines. The cuisines are - Indian, Continental and Chinese.

The Indian Corporate Lunch comprises of - choice of 1 dal, choice of 1 paneer curry, choice of 1 additional vegetable curry, choice of 1 rice, choice of 1 bread, raita, papad and choice of 1 ice cream.

The Continental Corporate Lunch comprises of - choice of 1 soup, choice of 2 continental dishes (rich in cheese), choice of 1 pasta, garlic bread and choice of 1 ice cream.

The Chinese Corporate Lunch comprises of - choice of 1 soup, crispy chilli baby corn, choice of 1 vegetable (in Chinese sauces), vegetable hakka noodles, vegetable fried rice and choice of 1 ice cream.

It's evident that, the Corporate Lunch is designed in such a manner that, though each of the three cuisine's menu is fixed, it still provides the diners, the flexibility to choose from a well curated set of available options!

Also, the number of Corporate Lunches ordered need not be equal to the number of diners present on the table. Meaning to say that, three mild eaters can easily order two Corporate Lunches and share.

Food quantity of any one Corporate Lunch is more than enough for one person.

For the tasting session, three different Corporate Lunches (Indian, Continental, Chinese) were presented. I opted to taste the following (mostly the house specialities) -

Crispy Chilli Babycorn (Chinese) - It had a nice garlic flavor.

Cheesy Baby Potatoes (Continental) - They were small round potatoes baked with cheese and cream. This dish was quite filling.

Four Cheese Pasta (Continental) - It was a concoction of penne pasta along with mozzarella, gruyère, cheddar and parmesan.

Dal Casa (Indian) - It was the staple black lentil, rich in butter and cream, and quite well simmered. Apparently, they simmer it overnight.

Paneer Butter Masala (Indian) - It consisted of soft cottage cheese cubes dipped in a creamy cashew gravy.

Butter Naan (Indian) - It was the regular tandoor baked soft Indian bread, greased with butter before serving.

All the aforesaid food items were well cooked and tasted very nice. Excellent hospitality added to the good taste.

Corporate Lunch Price: Rs. 350/- (all inclusive)

Corporate Lunch Timing: 12:15 pm to 03:15 pm (Mon - Fri)

Casa Kitchen is clean and welcoming. Soft instrumental jazz creates a relaxing atmosphere.

The menu features a lot of cheese. If you don't want cheese, there are choices in the Chinese section. I enjoyed the noodles. 

If you are a guest of Casa Fortuna, the breakfast buffet is abundant with South Indian choices: idli, sambar, dosa, uthappam, all of the chutnies, fruits and curd. If that does not suit, then there are fresh, crispy veg cutlets and poori bhaji, too.

Pradyut Biswas and the staff are thoughtful and provide attentive service.

Located near tiwari sweets minto park, this place is very easy to spot. One of the most exclusive vegetarian restaurants in bhawanipur,this place is gradually gaining it's popularity. Busy on weekends , I'd recommend you to visit it on a weekdays.

The strongest plus point of this restaurant would be its interiors. Rich and posh. The hospitality is also upto the mark .

Coming to the food, the restaurant serves Indian,continental and
chinese .
I was deeply disappointed to see that this restaurant hardly has any specialties of their own. Just the basic average menu card wouldn't help you to create the niche, which your restaurant is trying to create.
Though I am happy to see the new kabab menu added. Good job.
One of the attractions on the menu card was the different kinds of tea and coffee served and the breakfast options like the Cole slaw sandwich and the smoothie.
You would like to try
The sweet corn soup - Tasted perfect .
The kabab platter- Was a good mix of kababs. I'd recommend you increase the quantity served.
Vegetable spring rolls are not recommended.
Crispy chilli babycorn was better than served in other restaurants.
Vegetable au gratin - Space for improvement.
Four cheese pasta- A very new concept. Recommended.
Stuffed jalapenos - Too spicy for my palatte , recommended for those who love spicy food.
Subz gnuchi- Try it if you do not want paneer or aloo.
Vegetable biryani- Needs a lot of improvement. The flavours were not right at all.
Paneer kadhai - Very regular.
Masala kulcha - soft and just perfect.
Hakka noodles - very regular.
Blue berry cheese cake- A delight .
Also try the maid Marian
Also your rates aren't standard, so try improving on that.

"A regular Vegetarian restaurant priced high"

This is a pure veg restaurant with nice and cozy interiors. We had ordered Tandoori Kumbh which were great, their Dahi ke kabab just melted in the mouth and the Dal Casa (Dal makhani) is wow. I can confidently say that after Sonargaon at Taj Bengal, this restaurant has perfected the art of making such lovely and mouth watering Dal Makhani and unlike Sonargaon you don't have to pay a bomb here to taste this divine form of dal.

One of the best all vegetarian options of kolkata. When they had opened there wasn't much choice for pure veg food available in the city. Now even with the competition building up, they are still doing well. 
Good quality, simple, delicious food. Keep it up!

Liked exotic vegetables with hunan sauce.

Quantity of vegetable preparations were lesser than I expected. Else everything was good.

Friendly waiters who explained the dishes properly.

We are here for an Zomato Meetup organised by Samridhi Singhvi (Zomato Kolkata). It was a Vegetarians meetup at a restaurant who proudly saying we are veggie friendly. . Ambience was really great. The moment i entered warmly welcomed by Samridhi then we interact with manager and some other important guys. Restaurant was simple looking but classy. comfortable seats and rich decoration.
                                                                ...

Casa kitchen: Hair kitchen would have been a more apt name. Soup served with a hair piece and on our complain the manager put forward an apology with a grin on his face as if to justify it as a human error and with a sense that "Guys move on..." This is what we call a fine dine restaurant! Horrendous staff and unhygienic methods. A leave it alone place

BEWARE OF UNHYGIENIC FOOD.
There was a piece of hair in the soup. Manager conveniently said sorry and tried to rationalize by saying "it's humans who prepare food, ho jata hai". This experience was peppered with a demeaning smile towards us from the manager almost indicating it to us that, get done with it and move on. Food without hygiene and super rude staff behaviour is what you can expect here.

Btw was here for a family dinner and they ensured a sour taste to the awesome time.

Was invited to a Zomato meetup hosted at Casa Kitchen. Curious, I went along and was pleasantly surprised to come across genuine food lovers and critics. Usually having a difficult time having more than two things on my plate, I was the odd one out. But the meetup was eye-opening for me as to how seriously some food reviewers take the art: talking about minute details of how things usually should be cooked, the good places in town for culinary delight and their food blogs. Enchanted, I kept on listening, sipping my Mojito which was more than welcome on a Saturday afternoon.

Casa Kitchen is a well-lit veg-only family dining place with a fully stocked up bar at an amazing location (Minto Park, AJC). The staff are amazingly cordial and the menu for the meetup was special, the best of which was the Dal Casa the creamy Dal Makhani with a tinge of sweetness and Lassoni palak which was too good. Hariyali kofta and paneer were delightfully soft while pasta was cheesy and good as well. The starters/dessert were too many: none above or below average. In all, a good dining experience made better by the insights I got from the company I had. And Saturday afternoon cocktails.

Thank you

Casa Kitchen was on my wish list since it opened but never got an Opportunity. Probably, The Opportunity had to be through Zomato for good.

It was a Vegetarian Reviewers meet by Zomato at a Vegetarian Restaurant. Well planned and thought of by Zomato.

We were taken through a Culinary Delight in the hours that followed after the introduction.

Though we were served a lot of Dishes as mentioned in the photo, I am mentioning Dishes which I liked and feel are worth trying when at Casa Kitchen.

Starters:

Crispy Chilly Baby Corn:
Crisp as it should be and Fried in right combination of sauces.

Shahi Bharwan Aloo:
The name says it all. Aloo stuffed with rich stuffing tasted yummy.

Main Course:

Hariyali Kofta:
Koftas stuffed with creamy filling served in Red Sauce.

Dal Casa:

A version of Dal Makhani. This main course surprised me. It was perfectly as it should be or I should say I like it. Creamy with a slight sweetness. It's a must try when you are here.

Breads:

Kulcha & Butter Naan

Service:

It was a zomato Meetup and the Managers had Full Focus on us. They made sure we had a very good Dining Experience. It was one of the best I have ever had. It very rarely happens that the server insists that you try a dish.

Ambience was good. Right cooling with Sun Lights.

All above with good people to accompany you, made it a Awesome Experience.

Jst a week ago i had gt a mail from Samridhi Singhvi inviting me for the foodies meet at Casa Kitchen. I was extremely excited gtng the invitation since it was my first foodies meet. 
Casa Kitchen is located near AJC Bose Road. On reaching the place i was warmly welcomed by Samridhi along with her team. Then we started the introduction section where we introduced ourself to one another. We were also introduced to their Manager along with their Floor Manager who catered us to our needs. 
The decor was very much simple and elegant. The wooden ceiling and the wooden frames on the windows complimented the furniture along with the sofas.
What really impressed me was the hospitality of the staffs. They were very friendly and courteous and had a huge smile on their face throughout. 
Their was a specially set menu for the meet up with wide varieties of food and drink. I opted for Tropical Summer which had orange flavour and it had a perfect amount of tang in it. 
For starters we had Paneer Chilly Cheese Tikka- paneer was very well done with the right amount of spices quoted. Shahi Bharwan Aloo- was excellent to taste.. It had excellent stuffing of vegetables in it which made it all the more tasty. Hara bhara kebab- was v well made with the right amount of crispiness in it. It was a treat eating it.
Crispy Chilli Babycorn- was v crispy with right amount of flavours and sauces added. 
Stuffed Jalapenoes- This was my personal favourite. The jalapeno was coated in such a way tht it could be crispier with stuffings of paneer in it. Very well made.. Highly recommended.!!
Coming to the main course we had Cannelloni Florentine- it was excellent to taste with not so bitter spinach in it.. It was creamy and smooth and very well baked eith the right amount of cheese and sauce. Pasta Aglio Olio-was the spaghetti pasta which according to others was okayish. Four Cheese Pasta- was very well made and it stood out for me. The taste of the cheese was very mesmerizing. Dal Casa- was mostly dal makahani which tasted great too. Paneer Butter Masala was creamy and the paneer pieces were really soft and the gravy was great too. Hariyali Kofta was presented very well with the chunks of koftas perfectly placed in palak based gravy and highlighted coconut cream. The taste of it was great too. Aloo dum was made of thick gravy with cashew nuts and tomatoes and it had a perfect tang. The potatoes were soft too.
Lasooni palak also tasted very well though i am not a cery big fan of palak. For breads we had lacha parathas, butter naan and tandoori roti, all of which were made properly and not over cooked. Veg Biryani was served with some fruit raita.. However ibwas soo full that i couldnt taste the raita, however the biryani had the perfect aroma and the taste. 
Last but not the least we were served blueberry cheese cake which i didnt taste but according to others it was notupto the mark. Warm Chocolate brownie servedwith vanilla ice cream however stole the show. The brownie was simply mouth watering.
Overall i had a very pleasant experience. Thanks to the Zomato team for inviting us.. I would definitely recommend this place for all the veggie foodeies out their and also for the Non- Veg lovers who can try out this wonderful plc!

# ZOMATO MEETUP #

Approximately a week ago a got a mail from Samridhi inviting me to a zomato meetup at Casa Kitchen. I was really excited (needless to say) as this was a first for me. But then this review is not about me or my excitement, it’s about the food and service we were treated with. So without further lag let me pen down my experience.

Venturing down the AJC Bose Road towards Park Circus, you’ll find Casa Kitchen right on the edge of Wood Burn Park Road. Though a part of Hotel Casa Fortuna, Casa Kitchen has developed a separate identity for itself in terms of pure vegetarian food. On reaching the place, I was warmly welcomed by Samridhi, Keka , Rohit and Nikita. Then we were introduced to their F&B Manager and Floor Manager as they extended their greetings towards us.
The décor is pretty much simple and elegant. The furniture has been stacked to match with the wooden ceiling and the wooden frames on the windows. The sofas were very comfortable and at the same time complimented the décor. The tracks playing in the background were soothing adding a classy feel to the place.

There was a specially set menu for the meetup with wide varieties of dishes and drinks to choose from. We started with the drinks given the thirst generated from the sultry afternoon.
★    Watermelon Martini : Undoubtedly best cocktail on offer. It had an amazing tangy taste as soon as it touched the taste buds. A unique combination of watermelon juice and vodka was definitely a success. It was presented in a standard martini glass.

★    Mojito : The classic drink…classically prepared too. The flavours of mint and lemon were clearly highlighted despite being paired with white rum which has a strong after taste.

★    Cosmo on the Rocks : I just had a sip of this particular drink, so couldn’t figure out the ingredients properly. But it surely tasted great. The sourness of alcohol duly subdued by the sweetness of fruit juice.

★    Pina Nina : This was their eye candy mocktail. A really close resemblance to Pina Colada, it even tasted somewhat similar. A nice cooler, however too sweet for my liking.

Along with the drinks, they served us the starters which were as follows :
★    Paneer Chili Cheese Tikka : Generally paneer tikka tends to be over/under cooked at various restaurants, but thankfully it wasn’t the case here. It was super soft on the inside with a nice coating of spices on the outer.

★    Shahi Bharwan Aloo : An absolutely wonderful snack. I have had this dish elsewhere but wasn’t was good as this. Excellent vegetable stuffing to go with.

★    Hara Bhara Kebab : This was a bit on the crispy side, which is nice as it adds texture to it. It was topped with cashew.

★    Crispy Chili Babycorn : As all the other dishes being either Indian or Italian, this was the only Chinese item served. It had a nice texture and crispiness but was low on the spice element, which could have been increased a notch. Other than very good.

★    Stuffed Jalapeno : Another great starter, a combination of jalapeno base and paneer stuffing. Beneath the jalapeno there was also a crunchy coating to help the dish hold it’s form.

Now moving on to the main course dishes which consisted of both Italian and Indian cuisines.
★    Cannelloni Florentine : This is a pasta based recipe which involves infusion of cheese, spinach and olive oil. It was completely smooth and creamy – just the way it should be. Garnished with basil leaves, the dish looked splendid.

★    Pasta Aglio Olio : This was the spaghetti pasta preparation. It had a pleasant texture and the colour had turned somewhat golden brown which is an indication that it had been simmered well. It also had chilli flakes and basil leaves for extra flavour. Having said this, it did have a strange taste which was a minus.

★    Four Cheese Pasta : This is my personal favourite till the end of time. What can be better than four lovable cheeses added together in a single dish! The key is that the taste of every cheese should reflect on your taste buds. And that’s exactly what happened here.

★    Dal Casa : This was essentially dal makhani reincarnated. I guess the chef must have just played with some spices, because otherwise it was similar to the dal makhani. And it did not fail to impress.

★    Paneer Butter Masala : And here came the dish, without which any meal in India is probably incomplete. It had a creamy consistency and a sweet tinge. The paneer pieces were soft and tender. The gravy had a rich yellow colour.

★    Hariyali Kofta : This was a real eye catching dish with portions of kofta dipped in palak based gravy and highlighted with coconut cream. The kofta was mushy on the outside and quaint inside. The rich taste of spices in lip-smacking curry was clearly evident.

★    Aloo Dum : This dish was not as good as expected. The potato was a bit hard, an indication that it wasn’t boiled appropriately. However the gravy was better with a tang from tomatoes and sweet hint from cashews.

★    Lasooni Palak : It was one of my favourite dishes that I had at Casa. The elements of spinach and garlic were in the commanding position in terms of flavour.

★    Breads : For the breads we had Masala Kulcha, Lachcha Paratha, Butter Naan and Tandoori Roti. All of these were evenly baked. They were not at all chewy or stretchy.

★    Vegetable Biryani : The biryani was served along with some fruit raita. The flavours and aroma of herbs and spices were prominently infused into the rice giving it a rich taste. But have to say that it could have been better.

And last but not the least, the desserts, as all good things to those who wait.
★    Blueberry Cheese Cake : It happens rarely when I dislike a dessert. And this was that rare occasion. The combination of blueberry sauce and cheese cake did not match as it left a briny taste in the mouth.

★    Chocolate Brownie : Warm brownie topped with chocolate sauce was served with vanilla ice cream. This has always been a classic mix and it tasted absolutely blissful.

Coming to the service, I reckon the management was trying to put their best forward, but I felt that during the process the staff was a bit rushed while serving. But still a commendable job.
Finally I would like to thank my fellow foodies for an awesome experience and hope for many more dining adventures together. Plus a big thank you to Samridhi  for inviting me over for this meetup.

Location-GREAT :)
Ambience-Good enough
Service-Fast but servers could be rude.
Food...
White coloured paneer tikka.... Amazing! Soft creamy and good quantity! 

Canelloni florentine..  Smelly spinach,not well baked,not cheesy enough though the quantity was decent.

Cheesecake was not avalible so went in for a mud pie and it was just average.

Summer fizz mocktail was nice and refreshing! Ask them to customize it as how sweet you like ur drink.
* I did not like their service much, they don't take complains seriously and that's not acceptable totally.

★    Hara Bhara Kebab : This was a bit on the crispy side, which is nice as it adds texture to it. It was topped with cashew.

★    Crispy Chili Babycorn : As all the other dishes being either Indian or Italian, this was the only Chinese item served. It had a nice texture and crispiness but was low on the spice element, which could have been increased a notch. Other than very good.

★    Stuffed Jalapeno : Another great starter, a combination of jalapeno base and paneer stuffing. Beneath the jalapeno there was also a crunchy coating to help the dish hold it’s form.

Now moving on to the main course dishes which consisted of both Italian and Indian cuisines.
★    Cannelloni Florentine : This is a pasta based recipe which involves infusion of cheese, spinach and olive oil. It was completely smooth and creamy – just the way it should be. Garnished with basil leaves, the dish looked splendid.

★    Pasta Aglio Olio : This was the spaghetti pasta preparation. It had a pleasant texture and the colour had turned somewhat golden brown which is an indication that it had been simmered well. It also had chilli flakes and basil leaves for extra flavour. Having said this, it did have a strange taste which was a minus.

★    Four Cheese Pasta : This is my personal favourite till the end of time. What can be better than four lovable cheeses added together in a single dish! The key is that the taste of every cheese should reflect on your taste buds. And that’s exactly what happened here.

★    Dal Casa : This was essentially dal makhani reincarnated. I guess the chef must have just played with some spices, because otherwise it was similar to the dal makhani. And it did not fail to impress.

★    Paneer Butter Masala : And here came the dish, without which any meal in India is probably incomplete. It had a creamy consistency and a sweet tinge. The paneer pieces were soft and tender. The gravy had a rich yellow colour.

★    Hariyali Kofta : This was a real eye catching dish with portions of kofta dipped in palak based gravy and highlighted with coconut cream. The kofta was mushy on the outside and quaint inside. The rich taste of spices in lip-smacking curry was clearly evident.

★    Aloo Dum : This dish was not as good as expected. The potato was a bit hard, an indication that it wasn’t boiled appropriately. However the gravy was better with a tang from tomatoes and sweet hint from cashews.

★    Lasooni Palak : It was one of my favourite dishes that I had at Casa. The elements of spinach and garlic were in the commanding position in terms of flavour.

★    Breads : For the breads we had Masala Kulcha, Lachcha Paratha, Butter Naan and Tandoori Roti. All of these were evenly baked. They were not at all chewy or stretchy.

★    Vegetable Biryani : The biryani was served along with some fruit raita. The flavours and aroma of herbs and spices were prominently infused into the rice giving it a rich taste. But have to say that it could have been better.

And last but not the least, the desserts, as all good things to those who wait.
★    Blueberry Cheese Cake : It happens rarely when I dislike a dessert. And this was that rare occasion. The combination of blueberry sauce and cheese cake did not match as it left a briny taste in the mouth.

★    Chocolate Brownie : Warm brownie topped with chocolate sauce was served with vanilla ice cream. This has always been a classic mix and it tasted absolutely blissful.

Coming to the service, I reckon the management was trying to put their best forward, but I felt that during the process the staff was a bit rushed while serving. But still a commendable job.
Finally I would like to thank my fellow foodies for an awesome experience and hope for many more dining adventures together. Plus a big thank you to Samridhi  for inviting me over for this meetup.

Location-GREAT :)
Ambience-Good enough
Service-Fast but servers could be rude.
Food...
White coloured paneer tikka.... Amazing! Soft creamy and good quantity! 

Canelloni florentine..  Smelly spinach,not well baked,not cheesy enough though the quantity was decent.

Cheesecake was not avalible so went in for a mud pie and it was just average.

Summer fizz mocktail was nice and refreshing! Ask them to customize it as how sweet you like ur drink.
* I did not like their service much, they don't take complains seriously and that's not acceptable totally.

Had dinner here along with 15+ members. Ambience is pretty and it was full which is why my expectation from food was high.

It started on a bad note with effed up minestrone soup. Soup so bad that I had to leave it( I am among the group of people, who rarely leaves food unfinished). Average starters like American corn and Paneer Tikka.

All thanks to Dal Makhani that I was able to finish the dinner.

The restaurant for their hotel 'Casa Fortuna', this place has some of the amazing vegetarian food in town. Having tried their Indian affair one will be surely impressed by the taste. our favorite was the starter platter and the mocktails. The food was pretty decent as well but lacked salt(according to our preference) and with a few improvements they can be one of the best vegetarian outletin the city...

We have visited this place a couple of times and every time we have come here, there is a difference in the food quality. Sometimes it is good, the other times we had to complain about the quality of the food to the manager.

The only thing we order here, if we go for lunch is the corporate meal. They claim that its for one person but approximately 1.5 people can eat from one meal.

Overall our experiences at this place have been like a roller coaster ride.

Casa Kitchen, probably the best veg destination in town. Mine is a bengali family who also happened to be a semi-vegetarian, it's an instant hit with them! I recommend even hardcore non-vegetarians to try this place and it's totally worth it. Ambience is just perfect with well decorated floor space and warm lightings.

Initially,,I was quite pissed off when they literally served raw lemon along with a cup of hot water and tea bags when asked for lemon tea..to add to the agony ,they went on to justify that this is how they have known to serve lemon tea..pathetic!!!they later made amends..served green tea properly...
Now coming to the food..went there with family as it an apt place for vegetarians...
Canneloni was amazing and so was the paneer tikka..the hakka noodles and vegetables in conji sauce were not upto the mark...
In the main course we had ordered indian spread..
The curries-aloo da pyaza and paneer butter masala were very good..the breads,biryani was also awesome..the presentstion and service was good..apart from that hilarious incident,everything went well...

This is the third visit of mine to this place and every time before I have come to this place, I had the same complaint of poor service and the manager had the same fake promise to give - We will surely improve the service. Poor hospitality to our guests whom we had appreciated from our end coming outside of kolkata and thanks to your team for letting us down. 
Please kindly improve on the industry and take care of your manager who is too poor in hospitality service and needs to learn the etiquette's to serve and talk. 

For all others, not recommended at all. Think before going
Rather than enjoying you will spoil your mood at this place. 

To conclude, overall a hopeless experience !!

Went there with friends. Nice ambience. We ordered kebab platter, crispy chilli babycorn, cannelloni florentine and chilli cheese paneer tikka. All the starters were really good. I would recommend the Italian starters. We then ordered Indian main course. Dal makhni, aloo do piaza and malai kofta, with hyderabadi biryani and basket of assorted breads. Dal makhni is a must try, really nice.
Overall the place is quite good, the pricing is a little on the higher side though.

This place seems to be hit with vegetarian. We went their when the lunch hours were over....so ordered Fried Rice, Vegetable Manchurian & Lasagna.. 
While we liked Lasagna & Manchurian, Fried Rice was total blend and just seemed to be steam rice...the manager asked about the food & we said Rice was blend but nothing was done... He listened and went back without uttering a word. So service seems little bad. 
Giving 3 points just for Lasagna.

Although I'm a non-vegetarian, I loved my visit to this place. The hospitality and behaviour of the staff is like the cream on a cake. I would specially like to mention Marshall D'Costa for his commendable work and hospitality.

Ambience: The 1st thing you'll notice is that its a family restaurant and the decors are pretty.
Service: Very goood. The staff is friendly and courteous.
Food: So we ordered for Paneer Tikka, Crispy chilly baby corn, Russian Salad , Dahe ke kabab for starters. And all of them were top notch. Crispy chilly baby corn is a must try! And I've never had such amazing Dahi ke kabab ever!
For the Main course we had ordered Dal Makhani which is finger licking goood, we ordered Paneer Butter Masala, Malai Kofta and American corn palak which I loved personally. The Breads were serced hot n soft. 
And my favourite was The Blueberry CheeseCake and The Mudpie. They are amazing! Just what u need to end the Great lunch with.

Overall, Great Food, Great Service. I would recommend it. :)

I've been to Casa Kitchen once before. And on both occasions we have ordered north Indian food. This place has consistently served really good food. Right from soup and starters to main course, all were very nice. One suggestion though: Soup stick was neither fresh nor crispy. Plus the kind of money you charge, rather than being stingy, you should at least give sliced onions if asked for.

So today we visited this place for family dinner and I must say the feel and ambiance of these place makes it cozy and a perfect place to dine with family..
Coming to food..for starters we ordered chinese bhel ,paneer tikka,and babycorn..I must say paneer tikka was well marinated and tasted well,while babycorn also good but not very great and chinese bhel was okayish..
Coming to the main course we ordered pindi chana ,dal makhni,and paneer butter masala,and paneer tikka masala,along with Indian breads..the breads were great especially onion kulcha...paneer butter masala was heavenly and pindi chana had the right balance of spices...all in all it was a great experience which was stopped by desserts we got some complimentary tutty frutty and I must say it was very well made..so totally a great place ,nice ambience only points deducted for was chinese bhel and paneer tikka masala..

I've been to this place innumerable times. Situated at the crossing of AJC Bose road and woodburn park, just next to Tiwari. It gets overbooked on weekends, so Reservations are a must if you are visiting this place on weekends. 

This review is based on all my visits combined and not on a single visit.

The food quality is superb. I've been over here a little over 20 times and not once have they failed my expectations. Some of the dishes which I liked were : paneer tikka, crispy Babycorn, yellow dal, chana masala, paneer kulcha and many more. Veg Augratin is a must try. It's a wholesome preparations with ample vegetables and white sauce. 

The staff has been very courteous. Once they served me with Augratin which had carrot when i had ordered one with Jain preparation. They apologised, changed the dish, and also served complimentary deserts to each one of us. Also they make a point to call back their customers to take feedback once they have visited the restaurant.

I've never felt disappointed and always left the place with a happy stomach and an immense smile on my face.

The quantity could serve 2 people for 1 plate... The dishes were many and tasty... The food, the ambience of the restaurant, the staff behaviour everything was excellant...!!
Above all, I had ordered for the food over the phone and they delighted me so much that they believed the customer on call and had prepared the lunch because we all 3 were running short of time... We just had to eat and rush for a meeting... :)

Very happy... Would visit the place many more times... Also because of the pocket friendly buffet... ;)

Make it a point to have at least one meal here on every visit to Kolkata. One of the very few pure vegetarian restaurants in Kolkata that serves tasty food with very good service. Cost is affordable as well. Must visit for all veggies visiting Kolkata.

Casa Kitchen is pure veg restaurant. I went there with my 2 friends. The staff greeted us very politely. We ordered tomato soup, bhutte ke kabab, subz bahar, butter naan, masala kulcha and veg fried rice. Food was served quickly. It was yummy and delicious. Although quantity was less than what we were expecting. Best part was blueberry dessert. One thing which i didn't like was they took the subz bahar even before we were not finished eating it. Cost is on the higher side. I will definitely like to visit this place again.

Let me be very honest that i'm not a big fan of veg cuisine but after tasting here at casa kitchen my perception changed about veg cuisine to an extent. Actually i'm visiting Casa Fortuna for audit work on daily basis so i'm getting the chance to try their dishes daily for lunch.

The stand out dish for me would be their dal makhani. Simply outstanding & must be tried. Their paneer varieties are also good along with their dam aloo.

The staff here are very responsive & prompt which a very strong point for any restaurant. A must visit for any vegan & a thumbs up from me

And this family restaurant doesnt ever let u down with its food ! Be it North Indian or its Chinese or its portion of Italian cuisine! I love the Dal Casa and paneer Kadhai! Their bakes are pretty good specially the cannelloni and veg florentine! and the pastas are too well made! Their Chinese is good including their baby corn , wantons for starters and vegetables in Hunan sauce in the main course. I like to visit this place because of the consistent good food they serve!

The Kaali Daal here is simply out of this world. I mean, being a veggie, I have tasted Kaali Daal at almost every restro, but Casa Kitchen serves the best Kaali Daal I have ever had. The other items from their menu which I have had is very good too; like the Paneer Kadhai, Garlic Naan, Kulcha and Veg. Biriyani. The Biriyani too is one of the best I have tasted ever. Moreover, the restaurant's ambiance is superb and the staff is very courteous. I had gone there last month and along with the meal had ordered a Pineapple Raita. However, the curd in the raita was sour and I let the manager know that. At the time of billing, I came to know that I wasn't charged for the raita. That made me pleasantly happy as it is very rare to find something similar happening in other eateries.The place is a tad costly and hence I would have to think twice before visiting here regularly. But the smell of the Kaali Daal would probably drag me here. Two thumbs up to Casa Kitchen. Please maintain the same standards always.

Its a pure vegetarian restaurant located in Minto Park. The ambience is pretty decent. As for the food, for starters crispy chilly babycorn was delicious. Highly recommened. The paneer tikka was a disappointment though. The paneer was rubbery, not soft enough. For the main course, the dal casa was excellent. Paneer butter masala again quite didnt live up to the mark. Naan, tandoori and vegetable pulao were decent. The staff were courteous. Overall a good place but there are better restaurants with a lower pocket pinch.

Celebrated my mom's birthday here with a group of 12. Ambiance is good and service too. The place is silent and has a very proper atmosphere for a restaurant.  To talk about food-  in starters, baby corn was very dry and not good panner tikka was good, naan was 'ok' and the food was not at all spicy.  in all it was an OK restaurant.

As a film journalist who occasionally does restaurant reviews, I was hosted by Casa Kitchen to savor some of their exclusively vegetarian fare. I am a fanatic of non-vegetarian food so it was not an experience I was exactly looking forward to. But once I stepped in, my food world turned topsy turvy and my taste buds began to go through rainbow shades of flavor, taste, texture, colour and the works. 

The debate between the merits of vegetarian versus non-vegetarian food is a never-ending one especially in Kolkata where the non-vegetarian population dominated over the vegetarians. But not anymore. Vegetarianism has gained in popularity and also risen in terms of its demographic presence in the city over the past two decades or more. Casa Kitchen has set an example in serving the best in vegetarian fare that covers cuisine in every variety one can imagine - from pastas to chow mien through Butter Paneer  Masala served with your choice of Indian breads and even Continental flavors - you have them all at Casa Kitchen. 

Never mind how much of a hard-core non-vegetarian you have been, I am sure that one trip to Casa Kitchen will drive you to repeat visits. The ambience spells out taste and class, the collages on the wall and the stained glass paintings spell out their own personas, low key and subtle. The music is so low-key that you almost miss it but that is good because the conversations at the table can keep going. 

Right now, the restaurant is offering a special Summer Soiree to beat the heat and forget the beating sun outdoors. Casa Kitchen is an award winner Pure Vegetarian Restaurant famous for its thoughtfully designed and structured culinary offerings for the gourmet. The Casa Kitchen spoils you for choice. You can order from a large offering of coolers or from a variety of colourful salads if you are health conscious. 

There is  the Cool Casa Sandwich, Mediterranean Salad with balsamic or may be a Go Green Salad with garden fresh raw mangoes and vinaigrette. You can even try out the fried crispy chilli baby corn which you must have eaten a hundred times before but the Casa Kitchen variety is surely a custom-made designer's delight! 

There are the unique Casa Kitchen treats like the Water Melon Sandwich. But I was offered a rainbow hued range of dishes that began with Aglio Olio, a small hill of thread-like pasta piled up on a milk-white dish delicately flavored with roughly ground red pepper, olives and basil. O My God, it was sheer heaven and I am not exaggerating. The very spicy vegetable hakka chow was hot in more ways than one but extremely tasty making one want to lick one's lips and click one's tongue  till Kingdom Come.

There is a bar too but being a non-drinker, this reviewer had to keep away from the bar. Tequila lovers may wish to indulge in a Watermelon thunder and Mango Margarita while the vodka cocktails could be your preferred Pink Glow Splash and White Russian.

The service is pure white ceramic in different shapes and sizes to add to the variety of the entire visuals of the restaurant. The flavors do not run into each other at any moment. If you are a non-vegetarian and do not like to even hear of vegetarian food, Casa Kitchen has learnt the magic of conversion - a conversion from the non-veg fare to veg fare or to marry both to add to your gastronomical girth and happiness. 

And why did I decide to award 4.5 on 5 to rate the restaurant? The answer is simple - I had savored so much of the delicious offering spread out on the table that there was no room to taste the desserts! You are in excellent company if you covert to vegetarianism. From A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to Narendra Modi, from Amitabh Bachchan to Shashi Tharoor, from Vidya Balal to Olympian Susheel Kumar - they are all world-famous vegetarians so why not join the queue and become famous?

Casa Kitchen is a pure vegetarian joint , Ambiance is standard fine dining types . Staff are well behaved , no parking issues . Soups were served quickly and were hot. Minestrone was a perfect balance . Paneer Tikka was nice and green chutney was okayish . Paneer was cooked very evenly which is a very rate thing . The Lasagne was fantastic with oodles of cheese . Coming to the main course the Nans were a bit disappointing , so were the rotis which were not exactly as i liked , The masala kulcha was even very thin . Maybe its just me who likes the traditional kulchas so i wont complain much . Mocktails were refreshing . A good experience overall .

I have been there thrice. Amazing Food. Well Trained Staff. Satisfied On all Occasions. Even Celebrated A Birthday There. Courteous Management.

Let's get to the main part: Food
1. This is a pure Veg restaurant, very much to my liking.
2. The cucumber mint drink was fresh and very well prepared.
3. Tandoori paneer tikka was one of the best I've ever had. Paneer was really soft, juicy and succulent. Well balanced spicing, well marinated. Even the tandoori aloo dish was well prepared.
4. Coming to the main course, the Dal makhani shouldn't be given a miss. It's right up there with the best Dals of Kolkata. Finger licking good. Called for the chef and he informed us that the dal is cooked for quite a long time in a clay pot. Much like Dal Bukhara of the famous ITC Maurya in Delhi. Kadhai paneer and Malai kofta were good as expected.
5. Desserts were good. Specially the tutti frutti one. Even the brownie was moist and delicious.

You must come here with an empty stomach because you're sure to be a victim of overeating in this wonderful restaurant. Delicious.

P.s. There's some waiting on Sundays due to heavy rush. Make reservations if necessary.

it was a very good experience for the the whole family. the ambience was praiseworthy. Being a veg. we enjoyed a food a lot .anyone who visits that place must have the dal makhani and the dishes of paneer. 
At last i had the brownie which yum!!!
but still there are some dishes which i dont remember and just wish that i could remember them.

I had heard much about the place,however have always missed out on the cuisine as I am a self-confessed non-veg.
However I went there on this Saturday, we were six pax.Had 2 starter of which I really liked the Kebab Platter.With that 2 soups and 3 mocktails and 3 main dishes,amongst which was dal makkhni,a mushroom platter,a paneer platter,laccha paratha and pineapple raita.

And,did I forget to mention Corn cheese Cake? It was drool-delicious.

The total cost for 6pax was all inclusive Rs.3300, which I found reasonable.Only,I really hope I remembered all the cuisine names I had.

Please don't go to the place for wasting money.We went the place at last month for a birthday party,Your dining experience will be good but it is so costly,and food quality also not good.
If you are in Minto Park and searching for Veggie Friendly restaurants, suggesting you to go Govinda's ..100 times better than this place.

Casa Kitchen is a pure vegetarian restaurant and a place I personally would love to go again and again. Among the things I had, I really loved the Vegetable Au Gratin, Dal Casa, Harayali Kofta and the Monte Carlo which were all really delicious. The decor of the place is simple and the service is okay. Overall the place is good and I really liked it.

The best thing about Casa kitchen is the friendly atmosphere u get as soon as u enter this place. The food they serve is probably the best North Indian served in Kolkata. One should surely order monchow soup and lasagne here. The ambience and food the place provides is worth spending for and a must visit too.

Breakfast at Casa Kitchen was a delight. To begin with, for all the coffee lovers, you will find the coffee (with brown sugar) much better than the ones served by so-called "cafes" that specialise in coffee! Among the English offerings, mini croissants, baked beans, mashed potatoes and muffins were well above average and almost equivalent to the real British taste. As for the Indian food, the South Indian offerings were decent, except for the upma which could have been amazing had it not gone cold and bouldered up. The other options, the typical kachori sabzi and cutlet etc. were alright, nothing different from what other competitors serve. I wish the juice had been freshly squeezed and not taken from tetra packs. On the whole, the buffet was tasty, delightful and quite filling even in one helping provided you chose the right combinations. 

Every small qualm I had, was made up by the excellent view of Minto Park from the glass windows and the proficient service by the well-mannered staff. 

Overall, really good food, really good service and coffee and really good view!! Just try squeezing more fruits for the juices.. Will taste much fresher :)

Located nearby mintoo park, this is a pure vegetarian restaurant serving multiple cuisines ranging from north Indian, south Indian, Chinese, continental etc; a complete squeaky clean posh set up over a lavish floor space, the interiors are elegant with chique and sophisticated decor. The ambience is ideal and very hospitable. The stewards and waiters are very well groomed and courteous. Their offerings are vast and detailed starting from a perfect multi cuisine breakfast menu to lavish lunch and dinner main courses. The quality of their offerings are top notch, perfectly garnished and served with perfection. Overall it provides a complete luxurious dining experience.

I went here out of desperation. I work in emergency sector and thus have to do shift duties. The lack of a proper canteen leaves us hungry and starving for a breakfast after a night duty. And as proper bangali culture goes, if you choose to have a breakfast outdoors, you must eat kachoris/nans/luchis and tolerate disgusting "choa dhekur" s for the rest of the day.when i tried on this place it fells me a lot.....best place for all variety of food

To start of it's a pure veg restaurant. Situated very centrally on AJC Bose road. Next to tewari bros & french motor. Very nice ambience and service also very good. Staff are very polite and don't take much time in bringing your orders. 

Now the food part. Perfect blend of taste and very wide range to choose on. Presentation is also good and would really like to appreciate the effort of chef. 

Will surely recommend this place for all veg food lovers. 


Cheerzzz. Keep it on guyzzzz.

Being a hardcore non-vegetarian..it takes a lot to go to a pure veg restaurant. Being Diwali eve and forced adoption of vegetarianism decided to try out this fave joint of all the veggies.

Its on the first floor and is part of the hotel. The ambiance is good, you have the choice to sit beside the french windows and witness the hustle and bustle of Calcutta's street whilst you enjoy your food.

We ordered for Dahi kebabs, 4 cheese Pizzas, Rotis, Dal Casa (Makhani) and Hara koftas. The pastas were very tasty - this came from my 2 year old daughter who is a big fan of Pastas. Dahi kebabs were nice and something new for my palette. Daal Makhni was nothing spectacular, Hara koftas were unique and tasty. Overall a good place to have some veg fare. Meal for 4 came to 2000/- which is a little high for a vegetarian place.

Will visit for sure only for forced vegetarian days!!

Cheers!!

I write this review even as I'm waiting for the dessert to arrive. The minestrone soup was tomato soup infused with sightings of mini slivers of veggies and pasta -it was good though. The dahi kabab with the pudina chutney was really nice. The bhutte ke kabab was a let down though, I expected corn - I could literally count them: just about 2-3 per kabab. 

The au gratin has made me very very happy. The Hakka noodles were good. The chilli lemon gravy dumplings were a little spicy for my taste but if you like hot, I'm sure you'll love it. 

The blueberry cheesecake and chocolate mud-pie have arrived, and look amazing! Annnnnd, yes, the dessert exceeded my expectations! The mud pie is spongy, soft, and yummylicious!!! 

The decor and ambience were attractive and the music was soothing. The staff were courteous, but they need to work on their speed of service a little. The prices are a bit on the higher side, but considering the location it's okk. I'm a vegetarian, so I had a great time. 

Recommended for everyone. A must-visit for vegetarians!

Casa kitchen is one of those rare places in Kolkata which serve only veg food.. Thus having a limited customer base which is good for those who would give it a miss.. Their soup was average.. For starters we had dahi kebab, hare bhare kebab, paneer chilli cheese tikka (they prefer to keep chilli and cheese on the menu and not serve on your plate). Other kebabs were soft and melted in the mouth.
However, the main course was served luke warm and I found it to be over priced and below quality. Their casa dal tasted like one of those MTR ready to eat dal.. Aloo do piyaza was ketchupy and corn palak was one item which was served hot but lacked any taste.. Kulchas did not have adequate filling, was not cooked adequately which made it a bit hard and chewy. Papad was over cooked which had to be replaced. Onions were not fresh which also had to be replaced, hesitantly done so by the waiters.
With such disappointments from the food, we developed the courage to order a chocolate mud pie.. And thank god we didn't order any other dessert..!! A dessert which is capable of leaving a long lasting impression and could make you forget even the worse of foods was one among the most disappointing ones I've ever had.. They need to do some research on what a mud pie is!!!
I must say that staffs were friendly; need more professionalism.

At the time of ordering food they would recommend the best food that meets your taste. And even after serving they constantly asked of the food was good!

Being a hardcore non-vegetarian, a pure veg delicacies seems to be a different world to me altogether.  In the city of "Meat The Fish", I always find it very difficult to change my taste genre for a while to go green. Few of my vegetarian friends suggested that CASA Kitchen may not disappoint me.  Though it was few miles away from my Lake Gardens home, but somehow a inner force dragged me yesterday evening (Saturday) to enter into the "Kitchen"! Where Puja knocking the door, I can not expect a table straight from the car. However, my waiting into the CASA Fortuna (the hotel this restaurant belongs) lobby did not go beyond 10 minutes. A mid size restaurant, not so well decorated but soothing enough to enjoy your foods. Till date wherever I go green, I always try two items (purely my choice), one is a Continental dish "Vegetable Au-Gratin" and another one pure Indian "Pindi Chana". Service was little bit late after request, but the staffs were courteous enough to condone the delay. I told them to make the gratin with extra thick and crispy coat of cheese. This is one of the main reasons I like this dish. Vegetable was perfectly cooked and separate from each other in the white buttery sauce. My daughter enjoyed this dish much because of cheese and buttery taste. As a non vegetarian, I don't prefer any Chinese or other continental foods as nothing new can be offered in these items by a veg restaurant. Rather I always prefer Indian veg delicacies that have plenty of resources to enjoy. In the main course, I requested three types of Indian Breads viz. Stuffed Naan, Masala Kulcha and Garlic Naan. I have a weakness on Chole preparation. And Pindi Chana (almost dry item) is one of my favourite. Paneer Kadhai was another vegetable dish I requested. Veg dishes without paneer is always incomplete. Of these three breads, stuffed naan was the best. Garlic Naan was extra crispy. Paneer Kadhai is good but somehow I felt too much of capsicum. Three types of Mocktail they served, tasted ok. Price tag is little bit higher but not much expensive. Staffs are very much attentive. Good gesture and ambience to get away with a smile. Hope to visit again to be green!

I had much expectation from this place, but...
Before we entered, we had been asked to wait for 15 mins because of the queue. As I realised I had not been called since about 26 minutes I went to check, and we were in within 5 mins.
The table which we got was such a disgrace, it was right in front of the kitchen and the bar. The staff were howling and fighting. The orders were been shouted to the chef and likewise. There was not much space for the staff to move around, my friend's chair was repetitively been knocked by one of staffs while managing and moving around. Even after requesting him this did not stop, so my friend had to change his seat on the same table.
When talking about the menu, I'd say that the mocktails sections could improve. The food is the only reason for which I am rating 3 stars. We ordered Vegetable Florentine to start with. It was well prepared, spinach was in the right amount and vegetables were nicely cut and cooked and I enjoyed every bite also because of the cheese. Our main course was pretty simple, Dal Casa & Paneer Kadhai with Paneer Kulcha, Garlic Naan and Butter Naan. Dal was the best and which kept my mood during the meal, paneer was ok. Garlic Naan was nicely done had nice taste of garlic and butter with sprinkled garlic pieces as wanted. Paneer Kulcha and Butter Naan were generally good.

Till I was eating my food, I enjoyed sitting there. But the rest of the time, I was feeling very uneasy and irritated. My request to the management would be to take care of the ambiance.

Ambience wasn't that great... As the place was too noisy... The waiters didn't even realize that every time they crossed our table they were pushing it!!!  Service was really quick.... The waiters knew the menu well and also served with a smile ..that's the good part.  The food was only average.. As the kabab festival was on.. We ordered alubukhara paneer kabab.. The dips were very nice.  Without the accompaniments it wouldn't get a good taste.. Cream of tomato soup was not too creamy...:P coming to the food.. It was just OK.. Not great.. Per head billing is rs.500..

This place is located in a prime Gujarati area in Bhowanipore. So they offer a wide variety of Jain food items. Good food and ambience. A nice touch to this place is a bar that they have included. They also have a hotel incase you wanna stay here and not worry about the food. The price is very apt and the service is what needs to be worked upon. 
Do give this place a visit for North Indian Food.

Well my husband and I stayed at the hotel on our first night after marriage, and they had a complimentary breakfast. Being tired, we woke up really late and ventured out for breakfast only around 10 am. Yet, they had almost everything served. We had read up that it is a vegetarian place, so we were not taken by surprise. I was a little skeptical as, given a choice, I would always prefer to go non-veg if I am eating out. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The food was simply yum! They had a potato mashed and fried (something like that), which I simply loved (I usually do not like potatoes). We didn't try the Indian food, but the continental fare. We were not disappointed. This is one vegetarian place I would definitely recommend!

Had lunch today at Casa Kitchen. Tried a soup, dahi k kabab, veg seek kabab as starters. Excellent kababs, very delicious. Then corn palak, dal makhni, roti n garlic naan at main course. Again good experience. The only dislike was the green chutney which was excessively sour but less spicy. That can b improved. It's a veg restaurant offers a fine dining option. Ambience is above-average, not too classy as a 5 star hotel but decent enough. Services were good, waiter interacts with customer well. Keep it up guys.

Had been to Casa Kitchen last week just had an overwhelming experience :) starting from the entry into the restaurant to the exit we had an ecstatic feeling and a marvellous food is all we need and they certainly provided one, way over our expectations. In terms of the ambience it was good but not the best but the quality of the food served here is world class out of the world. We ordered cheesy tandoori aloo as a starter which was awesome next as the main course food we ordered Chinese Bhel and T-sing hoi potato really exclusive. IMO if you are looking for vegetarian food then it's the best in Kolkata!! Moreover the stuff and crew were very courteous and polite. Thanks to Casa and their crew for making my day so great and colourful.... Keep doing the good work and will definitely be looking forward to visit soon !!

Have been to this place more than a couple times. It's almost full every time we went there. A good place for a vegetarian.

However today was disappointed with both service and quality of food. The staff were in-attentive and quality of food served was also below average.

Seems like after winning awards in 2013 (as displayed at the reception cum waiting Area) they have accomplished what they wanted and now they are least bothered. 

Furthermore after getting liquor selling license, you can find some non-family crowd too which was absent earlier. Might be a negative for people looking for a family place.

i went on 05/05/14 with my family for a dinner there was ample space but they denied a single table
for 10 of us and when i asked them to arrange a single table they simply said me to leave.

After getting the table there was no one to serve water even for 10 mins... In all didn't have a good experience though food was decent...

I had been to Casa Kitchen last sunday with prior reservation . I , being a vegetarian , thoroughly liked the reach of the menu . We ordered for a paneer kadhai , which was finger-licking ( though i would have preferred it to be less oily ) & navratan curry ( which gradually built its taste ) . Boondi raita was as good as you could get anywhere . Breads were crisp & upto the mark . 
  All in all , a perfect fine dine i would say . I wish I could be up early some day & go for its Breakfast buffet . 
 Recommended .

This wasn't my first visit to Casa Kitchen. I have been a regular there for the past year or more. What I love about the place is that they have been consistent with their quality. Let me say that the Indian here is pretty average. It is not something that you would go 'wow' about! But the Italian and the Chinese cuisines are surely amazing. I have tried their minestrone soup, which is made the traditional way, with a slight twist. Yes it is a little indianized but is awesome to taste with rich basil. The Chinese sure is worth coming back for because even with selected dishes on the menu, you do get quality and delicious food. I would rather go to a restaurant with selective items that taste yummy rather than going for places that has everything across from across the globe, but tastes just average!

Casa Kitchen surprised me ..... being a hardcore non vegetarian I have not ventured into this place but I was invited for dinner by a friend recently and so finally got a chance to try it out.... I came away fairly impressed. We started our meal with Cream of Tomato Soup , Paneer Tikka and Chinese Bhel  .... the soup was very nice and I loved the Paneer Tikka and Chinese Bhel .... it got our meal off onto a good start. Dal Makhani , Dum Aloo , Pindi Channa with Butter Naan followed. All the food was good and we enjoyed our meal. I would like to try more of the Continental and Chinese fare on my next visit.

This was my first visit to Casa Kitchen and it was just splendid! Not at all disappointed! The valet car parking is a big big plus (you rarely find a free parking spot in that area). The Pesto Panner Tikka was tasty and well cooked. The Butter Naan was just so soft and fluffy, and the Dal Makhani was absolutely out of this world! It was so sweet and yummy! The Yellow Dal was good too. 
To conclude, the ambiance was amazing, food was amazing and so was the service! 1 less star for the slow service, but except for that, I'm absolutely satisfied and it was just an amazing evening I spent there! Recommend it to everyone! Keep It Up guys!

it was my second visit to Casa Kitchen...... My first visit was an awesum experience with lovely starters n main course, hence i decided to give my birthday treat at Casa Kitchen... therefore, booked a table for 10 in advance..... i had already mentioned its my birthday party and hence expected lil more attention...... but to my shock instead of making lil extra efforts, on the contrary the service was pathetic.... the staff were ill-mannered..... literally ill- mannered.... my party was spoilt completely....
my guests kept calling the waiters and they barely responded....
on the other hand, wen they heard us calling, they were making fun amongst themselves.... "excuse me .... excuse me....huh"
Nothing cud hv been more insulting and humiliating.... my guests kept shut coz it was my birthday and they din want to spoil it.....
next cums the food.... i had relied on my first visit and chose the place but was a big big mistake....

The breads were actually "kacha".... "kacha" is the word.... shyam savera was on the special men and hence we ordered dat.... it was even more worse..... the food was just pathetic...

Bad food is still tolerable but mis-behavior is just not tolerable..... and hence Casa kichen has for sure lost its goodwill...
and i  wonder where will such negative mouth publicity take them.....

I will not forget such a pathetic birthday of mine.....

thank u Casa Kitchen for such an unforgettable experience!!!!!!!!!!!!

Looking forward to your earliest action so that you dont lose another couple of customers.......

Awesome experience. If I have to say one thing about Casa Kitchen, it's the food that takes away all the credit. Tried their stuffed paneer and steamed broccoli dimsums for the starters and they were out of the world. For the main course, tried their custom made malai kofta and black dal and I can certainly say that it was comparable to any of the best North Indian restaurant in the country. One must definitely visit this place if he is a foodie. Another positive aspect is the prompt service. The variety in the bar menu is also upto the mark.

Average place with exorbitant prices!!
Went here on one of the days during durga puja with family and was disappointed right from the outset. Though we were very well attended and the staff was very well behaved yet I would not visit this place again for its sheer average quality of food.
Everything we ordered was quite below par and every morsel made us regret the decision of coming here.I understand during puja every restaurant finds it difficult to live up to its food quality but this one was well below the accepted level.And if this wasn't enough we ended up paying a bomb for a below average quality food.

My visit to Casa Kitchen happened in the backdrop of my visit to Olive Restaurant this week located exactly opposite on A J C Bose road and so, if comparisons have to be drawn CK fares better at some premium !!!

This one is part of the Hotel Casa Fortuna located at the crossing of Woodburn Park rd and AJC Bose rd. Thinking of the location first thing that came to my mind was parking and their valet parking came as a relief, more so when i dint locate a valet parking guy on first instance. The restaurant has a separate entrance though i prefer getting an eye at the hotel lobbies before getting in.

Had checked the menu, photos and reviews of the place on my way for a lunch on saptami, so had an idea of whats coming my way. The staff were there at all key points and everybody greeted us well. They were courteous, polite. The ambience was a bit clumsy and though the place is big, it seemed very congested. Decor is pretty simple. There are large glass windows with a good view but thats a tough call to take since the sunlight during daytime doesn't allow the artificial lights to create that intended atmosphere inside.The seats and sofas are well cushioned, comfortable but i thought the tables weren't matching well and gave a shabby appearance. 

Now coming to menu, they had a special puja menu with options limited than usual but extensive enough for us to order our dishes. The prices were almost 50 percent higher than those mentioned on zomato presumably their regular menu and such premium for puja menu is not so justified in my opinion. Anyways, with the great durga puja state of mind and hunger in the iron caves, we decided to plunge into an eating extravaganza, bypassing the starters and getting straight into the rotis and sabzis. While waiting for the outcome, we noticed the place was pretty packed and look of the dishes being served on other tables raised the expectations and we weren't let down. The quantity served were pretty generous and dishes were prepared very well. The rotis were made well and paneer makhani was very nice. We also had a biryani which had a very nice aroma and tasted nice with the raita. The staff were very quick to volunteer to serve each time we tried to serve ourselves and a big THUMBS UP for that !!!

Food turned up better than expected and we came back as very satisfied souls. But at a 300 bucks per dish, you are expected to deliver a more royal, grand dining experience be it the pujas or any other day of the year but no complaints as to the food and its presentation. But at regular rates as mentioned in the zomato rate card, the place is really great. In a nutshell, a very good restaurant and i would rate it as one of the best in the category of 100 % vegetarian ones.

Food quality was below average, mostly due to rush because of festivity. The time taken to serve was very long and breads were cold. The restaurant had hiked the prices greatly in last 1 week and the food quality did not back up the premium pricing. The menu was changed to mostly substitute the dishes with Bengali dishes which would not go well with non Bengalis like us who constitute 90 percent of customers for such pure vegetarian restaurant like casa kitchen.  I hope this review will be useful for people like us who would visit Casa Kitchen during such festive occasions.

Had gone for breakfast buffet at Casa Kitchen on 21st July after making resevation for table for 4. The review is as follows:

First: Making Reservation for table for 4 and strictly requesting them for Jain Food which was kept to a certain extent.

Location: Situation on the main road in AJC Bose Road ( next to FMC Fortuna, Opp to the road entering Camac Street, easy for one to find it out). Since the place is nearby from my house. This is a pure veg restaurant.

Decor: Nicely decorated but so great about it with the interiors.

Food: The most important thing. Even after prior informing them that Jain food is to be made, they didn't had so many options with them even being a Pure Veg Restaurant.  
Coming to the buffet menu, it has Puri Sabzi, Idli Uttapam Dosa with Chutney and Sambhar, Cornflakes, Fruits (Watermelon, Papaya, Muskmelon), Juices (Orange and Mixed Fruit), Yogurts, Breads, Sandwiches (Vegetable and Mayonnaise),  Cookies

Uttapam - we ordered two... First one was ok but second one was great. Juices - It was like water has been added and it tasted horrible.  Even the Fruits were not sweet. Yogurts were pathetic which didnt even taste like and it looked like color added in curd.

Only good thing was the sandwiches, cookies and dosa (which were good)..

Staff: They should really learn to serve the customer. Repeatedly had to tell them that kindly clear the used plates, but they had been deaf with the ears - ignoring.

Cost: Rs. 1600 for four (including taxes). Not worth if i compare the food and service. Since my father wanted to visit the place, we went..

Overall experience, for the same cost one has good options available for veg food

There is nothing in the restaurant that was extraordinary. The food was simple and not convincing. The decor and ambiance was average. The worst thing was our waiter. The day we went their were some special kebabs which our waiter was forcing us to order and give it a try. That was very annoying. The service was horrible. Will never go there again.

I had gone to casa fortuna today(8th may 13) with family. our religion doesnt permit us to eat mashroom. we had clearly mention not to put mushroom in any of the food.

We had ordered a sizzler. when it was being served we found that it had mushroom, and ask to replace it. The managment there said that the particular dish cannot be made with mushroom, however the cheif is making another similar dish withour mushroom. 

After 10 minutes we were served with a similar but shabby looking dish. the management claimed that this was made without mushroom. 

To our horror, after finishing almost half the dish, we found mushroom in it. it was when we questioned the management, they confesed that they had taken mushroom out of the earlier served dish, claimed it to be a new dish and server it. 

the managment made us feel we were fools in the entire episode. 

it was a very bad experience. will never visit casa kitchen again.

This place is well done and apt if you love vegetarian food. This one is located on AJC Bose Road just beside the lane where 'Subway' is situated. The first thing which attracts you is it's ambience and interiors. The intriors are very eye catching and gives you a feel of fine dining. The various shakes and mocktails offered are very soothing and refreshing. The food too is quite tasty and nice, the quantity is also pleasing.
The staff are cheerful and friendly and always ready to help. I must appreciated the wide range of menu offered by them. 
The pricing is high I would say especially if you compare with other vegetarian eateries, but once a while you can definitely try this one. 
Overall I was satisfied with their food and service and rate them 4.

casa kitchen,situated near the french engineering car co,on ajc bose road is a favourite vegetarian restaurant of mine.they have a buffet option and it doesnt cost you many dimes.with a plush interior and gourmet ambience,it attracts foodies and bon vivants from all nooks of the city.in buffet they have many tradtitional north indian dishes along with a few continental choices.the taste is good,and even if you are a non vegetarian,you won't gruff about the menu.the dessert has icecream and gulabjamun among others.why this place isn't any more popular is ineffable to me.perhaps,the lack of non veg section.

Casa Kitchen was a shock...I was fidgeting the whole time to be in a all vegetarian resturant n was sure to be bored or displeased and i stood widely corrected.. I didnt even miss non veg dishes... the paneer tikka is to kill for...LITERALLY... their speciality dishes of pneer and corn are MIND BOGGLING...

To top it off...very nice ambience paired with coordial in-resturant employees....

To all pure Non Veggies out there..... trust me..n visit this place once...it'll be worth it

A FOOD HAVEN FOR VEGETARIANS!

Casa Kitchen is arguably the best vegetarian food haunt in Kolkata. It is definitely the best alternative for people who prefer to eat at a fully vegetarian restaurant. It is centrally located and also provides valet parking. The ambience and decor of the restaurant deserve praise and appreciation as well. The service is prompt and efficient. The menu is extensive and exhaustive in its offering of vegetarian dishes for the three cuisines they specialize in namely Chinese, Continental and Indian. But their strong point lies in their Indian dishes which are superb in taste and well prepared. One glance at the menu will show that their Indian items are greater in number than the Chinese and Continental fare on offer. From the Indian section items like Paneer Tikka and Hara Bhara Kebab are very popular. 

Other notable dishes from the Indian section are their Kadhai Paneer, Dal Sunehri and Navratan Curry. Some of their popular and fast moving items especially from the main course of their continental section are Vegetarian Florentine, Mushroom Italiano and Risotto. Their mocktails are refreshing and go very well with the food served at the restaurant. They also serve delicious desserts as well though they are nothing to write home about. I like to come here on 'veg' days like Diwali and Holi. 

 You don't have to limit your gastronomical experience at the restaurant only for lunch or dinner they also offer exciting breakfast options. Treat yourself to healthy south Indian options like Dosa or Uttapam or north Indian items like Chola Bhatura or Kachori. Even the good old toasts are tasty snack items from the Casa Kitchen. 

The only problem that you are sure to encounter over there is the perpetual wait for an empty table.  The difficulty of getting an empty table testifies to the kind of food that they dish out.

Hi, 

My wife and I went twice to enjoy dinner at Casa. It is worth dining and food is also fabulous. We had pasta Oligolio, initially i was pretty aprehensive but it tasted great, with blend of olive oil, freshly minced herbs. We are looking for enjoying more onion garlic free dishes in future and difinitely some oriental and Thai cuisines as well.

Casa Kitchen is a pure vegetarian restaurant located at AJC Bose road in Hotel Casa Fortuna.
Food is purely vegetarian here. 
Plain Dosa was good...prices are bit costly in order to quantity,,,i think.
Chilly Cheese Toast was tasty,,had served for snacks
For main course, vegetarian florentine was too good and for the first time i had tasted a vegetarian continental dish.
Mushroom Italiano was well done too. 
Service is fine and ambience is nothing special..
Overall a nice restaurant especially for veggies.
3.5 from me.

If you have run out of options this weekend , you could give Casa Kitchen a try!  Low on ambiance, gentle to your wallet, an all vegetarian, seventies style multi cuisine restaurant that has a liquor licence too.
Casa is located centrally on AJC bose road and woodburn road crossing and whats best it offers you ample valet parking. On most weekdays you are sure to get a table without a reservation. This place makes u feel like a "multi-cuisine" joint found largely in the Gujrati dominated suburbs of Bombay.
I tried the Chinese baby corn and felt it could have been more crisper and had an uncanny flavor of Kissan tomato ketchup.
The Indian grub was extremely well made and the black-dal topped on all food that we ordered.
Again a NO_ON_NO_GA ( no onion no garlic) friendly place.
On a weekend if you chose to have dinner there be prepared to find your self on a rather LOUD Gujrat-Rajasthan border. Not just will you hear vernacular cacophony but also  loud burps to make you  feel at home!

Hi all foodies.Sorry guys I am writing this review a bit late. Me and my wife went for a dinner on 14th Feb and to our surprise this place turned out to be a TOTAL NIGHTMARE of sorts. 
The food, the courtesy, the hygiene, the billing part everything was utter worthless. ThE tables even didnt have napkins and when we asked we got napkins which were smelly.
We in the end also gave a written complaint in the attached hotel which they have and we are sure it wont be heard. 
 
 HOPE IT SAVES MANY FROM GOING THERE.

Very nice ambience. I was there last week. Food was superb.  The restaurant was choc-a-bloc. They should revive the buffet. Prices are a bit steep. But one doesn't really mind because of the good food. The service could be a bit better and faster, could hear crockery breaking and stuff, though can't blame the staff, the rush was such on a Saturday.They should also introduce ofters and gifts for guests celebrating special occasions.

i must say for vegetarians {especially pure veg ones} this place is heavenly!!serves awesome indian food, rich in flavour just like all marwaris and gujaratis want!!with excellent staff and super prime location and amazing service and ambience this place is ideal restaurant! sometimes i feel this place should've been a little more spacious because on sunday nights itz always full, i mean the reservations to hardly make a difference!!
abot the food i must say the paneer tikka is out of the world!! as it enters in its sizzling plate it makes you even hungrier with its aroma!!the drinks too are good especially the Chatka mary( though i took the mocktail version was sooo good).. i must say previously this place had good chinese these days itz a little degrading .. i guess it's just getting better and trying to specialize with itz indian. this place seems all good to me so it definately gets a 4.5 from my side!! :))

Firstly I was attracted by the name CASA KITCHEN & 2 add to it being in South Kolkata. This is a pretty decent place for Vegggieee Lovers. Menu card depicts array of Multi Cuisine Vegetable garden. Among the starters Bharwan Tandoori Aloo was gr8 a must try for all. Dal Makhani, Malai Kofta & Shaam Savera wer FAB. The breads were edible. Vegetable Biryani was awesum. Need to improve the desserts side. The service staff were good & gentle. They have a lady Captain to take orders in the day time. Its a gr8 initiative for Ladies Gang to party in cosy & comfortable environment. Hard drinks are also served there.
 
      Remark: VEG Delicacies are prepared & served in a pleasant manner which is backed by gr8 service & valet parking. Yes u would have a feeling "AABAAR JABOO". Food & service are the wins for any restaurant & to be fare it has both. I would rate it with 4 stars. 
 
Thanking You.

The ambience is perfect for fine dining. Its a good place for family dinner. The food is awesome and delicious. The service is fast enough, so that a person does not wait for too long to satisfy the hunger. Moreover, we get pure vegetarian food, that makes it perfect for the family gathering.

I celebrated my birthday there, and was appreciated by the guests for choosing such a fantabulous venue for the TREAT.......

Casa Kitchen has provided a good food station for occasions. Now we do not have to think much before choosing a venue for dinner and lunch parties.......

I am totally satisfied with the food and service provided, and can very frequently suggest friends and relatives for choosing CASA KITCHEN as the ultimate destination for Lunch and dinner..... 

Must Try for every Vegetarians..........

Thank You

Casa Kitchen changed my views about veg food. Wondering if I can give it a couple of more stars!

Being a hard non-veg guy, any veg food has to be extremely tasty for me to appreciate, and Casa Kitchen is one place that I would recommend to anyone who is looking for quality food, aesthetically stimulating environment, courteous staff and reasonable price.

I visited the restaurant in mid Jan this year, and I have to admit, whenever I want to have veg food, I know I can't be wrong in choosing Casa. Any foodie would love it. Such high quality food, that you can only expect to get at home, is now being served in Kolkata.

Wondering if you guys would provide catering services to me as well. Personally, I would see no reason to rate this joint anything less than a five star. Cheers!

The mouth watering kababs are out of the world and Lasagne is a must try.
Chocolate mud pie and blueberry cheese cakes are to die for.
Overall, an awesome place. The service is very good. This is one restaurant I would suggest to anyone living in or visiting South Kolkata.

Centrally located. Veggies delight. Widely spaced comfortable seating. Relaxing ambiance.

There`s one brand of restros that we have grown up with, ones where our families went for dinner and occasional friend treats - the legacy restros and probably those are the only ones remaining kicking the restro scene in Kol.
Then there`s another brand - aaj ka brand restro - where people seem to be trying everything under the sun to delight the customers. Many fail miserably and some manage to impress you over and over every time you got there. For me, Casa Kitchen falls under the later category. 

I don`t know about the burning oil smell or overly cooked food probably coz i was seated where the customers are supposed to (and not in the kitchen)
The food if you try is really awesome - the dal makhani, and the kebabs -  i never had this better in other "only veg" restros in Kol.
But, probably what got me is the ambiance, neither too loud nor too dull. In fact, the ambiance there kinda made me feel more hungry.
The first time i had gone there, i thought probably The flying monk on the opposite lane would have been a better deal. But, it is not.

Suggestible for: Quick eat, unwinding with friends, semi-formal occasions, small get together.

They should be taught basic hygiene if you know what I mean !!when it comes to food, I can't find words to describe how awful it was. The dal makhani was only makhan and oil and it wasn't even cooked properly, the kabab a were not looking fresh. Very stale food and the cheesecake was bad. The entire place smells of fried garlic. I wouldn't even enter this place again neither let my loved ones do so ! Horrifying experience

As this place seemed to be quite popular with the locals, I decided to go there for dinner and I can describe it as a pathetic dining experience. I ordered dahi ka kabab which was absolutely pitiable. The location though centrally located, is extremely noisy. It feels as if you are sitting on the road and eating. The odours of this place is intolerable, smelling of oil being burnt several times in a day. I will not recommend this place to someone who gives preference to mindful eating. My experience was absolutely disgusting. Though I am a vegetarian, this place had nothing exceptional to offer except paneer and aloo!

Never been to such a pathetic place.. Can't recommend this place to even an enemy.. The odour of the place can't be tolerated and I had the paneer which was very oily and excessively salty.. To my shock I also found strands of hair in my food. Very few choice of desserts.. The location is too noisy and very slow service. Not up-to the mark of a boutique hotel also. Really disappointing. The kebabs were stinking. Though the prices are reasonable the place is not at all good.

Casa Kitchen.. A great pocket friendly restaurant in Calcutta mainly because it is in the center of the city and serves buffet at a very reasonable price. and what more? it is pure vegetarian. which is a boon for a city which is starved of good vegetarian joints - apart from the regular ones. this serves everything from italian to continental to desserts. But North Indian main course is where its specialty lies. being located in the minto park - ajc bose road crossing, it is a great restaurant for south calcuttans.
Three and a half stars from me :)

I might be being unfair to rate this a one star, however the one star is my very subjective opinion. Objectively I would give it a 2.1 star.

My subjective reasons for rating this a one star:
1. I will never recommend this restaurant to my friends, friends of friends, colleagues of colleagues and even my enemies
2. It is a pure vegetarian hotel and restaurant on Kolkata high street. Unfortunately the food selection is extremely limited to paneer - wouldnt you expect some variety from 'THE ONLY VEG' three star restaurant ?
3. The minute you enter the lunch buffet you are assaulted by the most pungent 'chinese' odours of vegetarian food. The 'chinese' food is essentially indian food cooked in the default base of nearly burned "onion - garlic - tomato - garam masala - 20 more masalas" to which a heavy dose of soy sauce has been added and 'bhunoed' to burning point. Yes, the restaurant smells like onions and soy sauce are on fire. Hello, have you heard of ventilation ? My complaints are no good here, as this is the hearty love of the locals.
4. As said before, aloo and paneer seem to be the generous options of the vegetarian food in the menu. I saw precious little other vegetables in the menu.
5. I headed for the hills and would advise you to do so too.
