wonderful place.. very decent well behaved staffs. the food was really good. loved the Thai & Japanese preparations that we ordered. Having visited both the countries, I can assure you that the preparation were as authentic as you find in Thailand or Japan.Â  we asked the staff to suggest some main course of their specialties. Their suggested menu was bang on... the food were tasty and the plating were awesome.

Have been twice to this place. And the place is WOW. Very good ambience, decent well behaved staffs, and awesome Chinese food. We took fresh lime soda, virgin pinacolada, chilli gondhoraj punch(so yum mocktail- a must try),chicken sweet corn soup, green chilli fish, sweet and spicy crispy chicken, egg Hakka noodles, fried rice, phad khimao( Thai stir fried noodles), schezwan chicken, vanilla ice cream and  triple chocolate icecream. Overall the food was tasty except the Thai noodles..the basil leaves got burnt and had a too pungent smell. But I will definitely give this restaurant a visit again in future!

We bought a deal worth 499 from nearbuy and were served 1/2 chicken soup, 1noodles, 1rice, chilli fish for the starters, 1schezwan chicken, summed up with two scoops of vanilla ice cream.
Food- 5/5(assuming the quantity is more without the deal) However for two of us it was suffice(since both rice&noodles) were given.
and CHILLI FISH is a must try from here. My friend who hardly likes fish, loved it .
Ambience- 5/5. Perfect for the days when you just want to converse.
Staff- The most courteous of all. 5/5.
I loved the restaurant, definitely going to revisit and try their a la carte menu.

I went to this restaurant yesterday with my mother to avail a coupon that I bought from nearbuy.com I had opted for the non veg lunch. Here goes my review

Chicken Corn Soup- This soup was piping hot and tasted yum. Nothing warms you up like a chicken soup in winters and this for sure amazed my taste buds. I would give this 4/5

Green fish- This was the starter dish. The waiter told me that it's made with the combination of spinach along with colorful capsicums. To my surprise this dish turned out to be the star of the whole lunch. I would give this 5/5

Hakka Noodles - This was like any normal noodles that I have ever had. Nothing remarkable but nothing disappointing too. The noidles were non-sticky with regular thickness. I would give this 3/5

Chicken Schezwan - So here is the thing. When I have scezwan I expect it to be spicy in taste. But this was certainly not upto my mark. Although it was great for my mom because does doesn't prefer spicy food, I still think it could have been a little more spicy because Hello! It's Schezwan. But it did taste good. I would give it 4/5

Fried rice - It was also normal in taste. Nothing extraordinary. I would give it 3/5

They also served one scoop of vanilla icecream. All of this at 449/- It offer was a steal and luckily I took it. The staff is polite and courteous. Although I did not order anything additional but I did go through the menu and the price is high as per my point of view. If I had not got the coupon then  probably I would have not gone there at all. The decor is decent with paintings for sale. Also there tagline suggests that they contribute to charity which is a wonderful thing to do. May be if I get a chance to visit again (with some offer) then I most certainly will. Do visit this place out. Definitely recommended

Yesterday I went there for the first time. We bought a coupon from nearby and opted for it.  We had Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Green Chilly Fish, Chicken Fried Rice, Hakka noodles, Schezwan chicken and ice cream. The soup was really yum, the green chilly fish tasted really good, the chicken was also good but the noodles & rice were average. The ambience is really nice & the staffs are very courteous.

A little over-priced. It has an interesting assortment of dishes in its menu. Sushi lovers can give this place a try. Good place for seafood enthusiasts! 

Personally, I wouldn't mind paying a lot for something exotic. But an unimpressively simple Chinese fish dish can't be 450+ taxes...

If price is not a concern, the place is for you.

Located at Kalikapur, this place is situated where Wasabee initially used to be. It is a few minutes walk from Kalikapur crossing and is on the first floor of the building. 

We bought a coupon from Nearbuy and went there for a Friday dinner. We had Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Green Chilli Fish, Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Hakka Noodles, Schezwan Chicken, and two scoops of ice-cream. The food was tasty. We simply loved the Green Chilli Fish. And, the fried rice was also extremely delicious.

The staffs are courteous and helpful. The decor is nice and elegant. You can watch cars passing by if you take the seats by the road. They keep paintings for sale on a wall. If anyone buys any of those paintings, they give a share of it to charity. Overall, a nice place to be at and enjoy food with your family and friends.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Good Service, Good Ambiance & very Good Food.... that's enough to say about this place..
but let's talk with a bit more details...

As I always love to try new cuisines, unknown dishes.. this place is perfect for me..

Situated at the first floor of a building on the main road, but unfortunately wrongly located onto google map.. so we had to face a long harassment to find this place as it was 1st time...
You can go upstairs by stairs or a small elevator is also there...

A very soothing decor and peaceful ambiance.. with very professional and elegant Staffs..Â 

Foods are excellent, we tried so many dishes on that visit..Â 
only the "Smoked Salmon Sashimi" couldn't satisfy us.. but that totally our personal experience.. the dish was not bad, you might like the taste...
"Chicken Yakitory" was damn good.. solid but soft pises of Boneless Chicken cooked in various souses gave us a real goosebumps,Â 
so as "Pork Josico Curry".. Mouth Melting Pork cooked in a mild flavor with different vegetables.. must give a try, if you don't eat pork, then go for the same with Chicken/Fish..
Also give a try to the "Chili Gondhoraj Punch" mocktail..Â 
Soba noodle is also a must try item here...

And at last.. I need to mention the "Wasabi", without mentioning this the review will be incomplete..just go for it, it isn't an independent dish, it is a paste comes as complimentary with different starters..Â I won't tell about the taste in details.. let keep it as a surprise.. but before having it must follow their instruction..

It is located in Kalikapur,can be easily noticed from road.The restaurant is located in 1st floor.The waiters are very polite and courteous.I tried Veg combo for two which I booked from NEARBY.COM.First they served us soup which was hot and tasty.Then they served baby corn which was very crispy.Then came noodle,fried rice and chilly manchurian.It is delicious but one thing I must say...their quantity is less.They should seriously work in it.Then they served vanilla ice cream and mouth freshner.Overall good experience.I recommend this place if you want to taste Chinese food.

We visited this restaurant on last Friday. We had lunch over here. We started with chicken clear soup which was really good then we had green chili fish as starter which was really good and tasty then in our main course we had chicken noodles with chilly chicken and that tastes good too. Interior decoration and ambiance was really good. One of the main reason I rate them 5/5 because of their service. I am really happy with their services and behavior. My birthday lunch was awesome so thanks and I will surely visit them soon. Keep it up.

Just Asian is Just 3 months old but their food deserves a look in by the Asian food lovers in the city! Located near Kalikapur where Wasabi used to be previously.

 We went on a Nearby voucher of 499 and was served a huge platter with good amount of servings per item.

A little bit about the voucher and what it comes with in 499/-

1) Chicken Sweet Corn Soup 8/10
2) Green Chillies.Fish 8.5/10
3) Chicken Friend Rice 7/10
4) Egg Chow 7/10
5) Schwezan Chicken 6.5/10
6) 2 scoops of Ice cream.

So, you see the variety of food served was very good and we were satisfied with the service as well.

We did have a glance through the menu card, and was of the opinion that the regular price of the dishes were a little more steep than average. 

Overall a good dining exeperience.

This is a newly opened restaurant, near my place. We went there one evening just for snacks. Weren't much hungry, so we just ordered one dish - Roasted lamb in soya chilli sauce. 
The flavour was really good but the lamb was bit hard. We informed them about it. They took the rest of the lamb, which wasn't served yet, to re-cook it. But came back with a full plate!
This hospitable gesture was really amazing. And this time the lamb was good. 
The ambience was beautiful and soothing, a japanese instrumental song was playing, which we loved.
Service was excellent. 
We will definitely visit again.

Guys , just tried Just Asian ! Itâs certainly the coolest place to try Oriental cuisine. To begin with itâs less than 2 kms from home on Anwar Shah Connector , a stones throw away from Spencerâs and the extended hours ( till 12.30 am !!ð³), makes it the Numero UNO in my hangouts list ! The Sushi or Dimsum Platter, Chicken Basil Cups , Lobsters or even the succulent Chilli Pork are just a few out of many what the Doctor orderedð and without squeezing your pocket too much !! I can vouch for the fact that one single visit won't be enough to try out their wide spread speciality items. Great ambience and excellent services. An extra reward point  to the owners for personally  visiting each table and looking into all matters strictly Gastronomic . To cut a long story story just try it guys to believe it ! Highly recommended !! Keep it up !!

It is definately one of the best Asian Cuisine restaurant in Kolkata.Happy to find Indonesian dishes along with Chinese, Japanese and Thai. The Dim Sums are to die for . Other favourite starter of mine the best I have tasted is chicken basil cups. Their Nasi Goreng and Hibachi sizzler are not only awesome but the portions are large enough for two. There is also a crispy fish in sweet chilli sauce forgetting the name is just yum. 
Was extremely surprised at the quality and taste of the food there. I have gone back several times and also ordered home delivery ...the consistency of the taste and quality is very very commendable. Their done for a cause and art for a cause is something remarkable.

Big spacious restaurant with a decent ambience and very polite staff.Having a plus point of being open till wee hours of night upto 2.30am.They serve chinese plus japanese cuisine but sadly most of the items written in menu are unavailable.We ordered chicken udon noodles which tasted good,had a little bit of burnt garlic smell.Fresh lime soda had no fizz and was watery with bland taste.So thumbs down for it.They have ample parking space which is a plus point too

Our experience at Just Asian last evening was Just Divine! The food, the service and the overall experience was amazing. The menu is extensive and varied and we required the inputs of the obliging owner to help us make informed choices. Beginning with the subtly fiery Signature Chilli Gondhoraj Mocktail, we segued into  wafer thin delicious Dimsums and a light Ramen Ball Chicken Soup. The main course was a mÃ©lange of Japanese and Thai. The finale was an absolutely melt in the mouth home made Caramel Custard. 
It wasn't just a meal... it was a gastronomic experience! Highly recommended!

The zomato link for directions sends you into the lane behind the place, when it is on the main road, so just stick to the main road.

This new place has come up in place of Wasabee restaurant in Kalikapur, which has shifted it's location to a place not very far on the same road.

The ambiance and decoration of the place is nearly identical with Wasabee and it is quite possible that there is a group of the old management that has broken away to start this new place. Even the practice of reserving two best tables for imaginary guests continues. 

The mixed meat miso soup was wonderfully light and flavourful. The prawn tempura tasted different from what I have tasted in Japan, but the prawn was fresh. 

The Udon noodles had very strong taste, which ceased to be enjoyable after a few spoons. The Cantonese noodles were just right. The fish in oyster sauce was good, it was definitely Basa, not Bekti. Finally the sizzling brownie with chocolate sauce and ice-cream was quite good. 

The prices are reasonable, without the GST, which they are yet to implement. 

The service was very attentive. Actually it was too attentive to have a peaceful meal. With all their good intentions, the management may do well not to ask thrice (no exaggeration) after every dish. 

I would definitely like to visit the place again.

Best place for Sushi in Kolkata. Courteous well informed service. Extremely reasonable service. Located where restaurant Wasabee once was. It is better than its predecessor. We had Gandraraj chilli mocktail. Delicious.
Sushi platter - fresh and having most pure Wasabi paste in Kolkata, unlike most other places that dilute the staff. We had Dim sum platter - colourful and delicious. Mixed meat stir fried Udon noodles with uniquely rolled egg omelette pieces. Taste different from Chinese noodles but preparation almost similar. Chinese Peking style lamb-OK. Would go back later to taste the Thai and Chinese delicacies and desserts. And some more Sushi.
Went there for the second time. Had Salmon Sashimi, Nasi Goreng, soba noodles, rock lobster, and excellent desserts- brownie and caramel custard. Liked all of them. Also had steamed fish with dill and ramen soup - both on the blander side but each with a distinctive flavour of its own.. Last two items may not be agreeable to everybody 's taste though I personally liked them.

Visited Kolkata with a friend sometime back.. Knowing that Kolkata is the place of food..Â 
wanted to explore different food joints in the city.. Â Could just cover a few in the short duration. Â But must say that Just Asian was one of the best experiences that i had. Got to know from my friend, that it is a newly opened restaurant and he had already visited the place twice before. He insisted me on visiting this place.Â i was just too impressed with the food.. perhaps one of the best oriental food that i have had so far.. Loved the Sushi platter completely.Â The service was superb and the waiters were just courteous. Â The paintings on the wall, made the ambiance all the more attractive.Â In love with the place and the food. Would definitely come back to this place, the next time i visit Kolkata!

OK, so this is the new kid off the block! The kid is new, fresh, full of energy and raring to go. The owners do a round of the tables, speaking to the diners, trying to connect, suggest courses, extract feedback after a course is done and generally make an attempt to make the dining experience a pleasurable one! 
Well, I did like what the new kid had to offer during our first visit. The place used to be rented earlier by another restaurant and I couldn't but help  make a mental comparison of the inside decor of the current with the old. The owners of the previous restaurant had done up the place in bright shades of red and yellow with the walls being adorned with colourful posters and a clarinet style decorative lamp shade. Shorn of these posters and the clarinet lamp shade, the decor now appeared a little minimalistic and bare though by no means unattractive or un-appealing. 
We had gone to the place with a specific aim of trying out the Japanese cuisine. The Miso soup that we ordered initially turned out to be a drab affair with the endearing seafood taste, so characteristic of a typical Miso soup, missing completely. Then we ordered some salmon sashimi, which however seemed to have retained all its freshness and hence was delicious in taste. The Thai red curry was next and though I thought the chef could have added a little more spice to the red curry and thickened the gravy a little bit more, the aroma emanating from the steaming white rice and the flavour of coconut milk of the gravy made up for any misgivings that I may have initially harboured. 
In summary, if I had to describe the dining experience at Just Asian it would probably suffice if I mentioned the fact that I look forward to explore this place more in the coming months. There's certainly the convenience bit for us because it's distance from our house  can be covered in 10 minutes even if we walked at a pace at which the tortoise had started the race with the hare. The brother - sister owner duo have already talked us into getting the discount card made and we certainly intend to make use of it in the coming days. There's also something more than the convenience bit and the discount bit that would make me go back. It's that honest eager to please attitude of the owners that has endeared me. I would therefore go back, on another day, to have a hearty conversation with them on matters relating to charity, something that they mentioned was their passion, over some good assorted sashimi platter.

A restaurant with a different outlook, Just Asian was simply an amazing experience. We had dropped in there to enjoy my husband's birthday lunch and returned with sweet lingering memories of yummy Asian delicacies, incredible hospitality and excellent service. The spacious interior, the ambience and decor, the exclusive paintings and artistry were all so perfect! The novel concept of 'dine for a cause' is indeed a noble gesture. The food served was awesome and were truly authentic in their taste and flavour. Last but not the least, a surpise birthday bonanza from the restaurant authorities left us overwhelmed.

A newly opened restaurant, I think it's just a couple of month's old in the place where Wasabee used to be ( they have now shifted elsewhere) but already gathering a loyal clientele. What I liked about them is that together with the restaurant business they are trying to give back to different sections of society in different ways. 1. They opened by inviting underprivileged children to their restaurant, which to my mind was an amazing gesture.2. They give discounts to teachers, doctors and senior citizens.3. On Wednesdays they give discounts to Women's groups.4. On one wall they have exhibited art work and a certain part of the sale money will go to charity.This will also help artists.5. They have a showcase area where they will have live performances from up coming singers etc to give them a platform.6. I was told that even the servers donate a certain amount to the charity from the tips received.All in all very commendable. 
I wanted to take a group of around ten to dine there and the management were extremely helpful and cooperative, they helped me plan out a good menu.1.CrispyChilly Baby Corn 2. veg sweet corn soup 3. Ginger Capsicum fried rice 4.Hakka veg noodles 5.Veg. Manchurian 6. American potato and corn sweet n sour 7. vanilla ice cream 8. Darshan 9. Welcome drinks of soft drinks and fresh lime soda.
This was of course a veg menu as requested by me. All my guests were very happy with the quality and quantity of the food. The service was very good and they kept on serving the guests with repeat helpings always with a smile. I had wanted a buffet but they apologized and said it wasn't possible but in the end this was better as the guests didn't have to get up to go to the buffet table. All were very happy and some even said that they would definitely be back to try out the other items on the menu..... Japanese, Thai and of course, next time for them...non veg ðð

Amazing food, some of the best I have ever
experienced. Tried Raman Ball Soup, Chicken Teriyaki - simply lipsmacking,it was just perfect. Stir Fried Chicken Udon Noodles: this is a must must try, you will find this dish rarely in any restraunt in Calcutta. Prawn Yakitori,Green Chilly Chicken, Chilly Garlic Chicken Noodles : Perfect blend of spices.

If you are looking for authentic Chinese, Japanese and Thai food, Just Asian is the perfect place to dine out. I would definitely recommend everyone to have "Hibachi Sizzler" and "Octopus Golden Curry". Â They are mouth watering and delicious. Try out the food here and it will certainly satisfy your taste buds.

The search for authentic Asian delicacies end here at Just Asian. Prawn Tempura and Salmon Sushi served here are mouth watering. "The way to a person's heart is through their stomach" and Just Asian has mastered it well. One could fall in love with Thai, Japanese, Chinese and Indonesian cuisine all over again at Just Asian in our city of joy, Kolkata. Fantastic interior and excellent service. A must visit for food lovers.

We stay in Ambuja, Santoshpur. Late at 11.30pm, 3 families decided to search for a restaurant where we could dine out. Through Zomato, we found out Just Asian is opened till 12.30am. We rushed to the place and found quite a few mad late eaters were already dining there. Was quite impressed. Though during late night they have a shortened menu but there is enough choice of Japanese, Chinese and Thai food. We had fantastic food so late at night. Har Gau Dim Sum and Volcano Sushi were amazing!. So were Udon noodles and Teriyaki Chicken. A higly recommended place and specially if at late night you suddenly decide to have dinner at a true fine dining restaurant, Just Asian is the right place for you as they are opened till 12.30am.

We have been hearing about Just Asian for sometime and 6 of us decided to drop in yesterday at about 10.30pm. The restaurant was packed but manged to get in after 5 minutes waiting. Since we were 6, we tried Japanese, Chinese and Thai. Amazing food and excellent service. The interior of this new restaurant is having class of it's own with beautiful wall hangings. If you have not visited this new place, would recommend to visit and try out their Volcano Salmon Sushi. If you love seafood, don't forget to order for Seafoof Hibachi. Kungpao chicken was just delicious! Thai food lovers must try Tom Kha Soup in Just Asian. Highly recommended place.

Our ordinary saturday night became extraordinary because of the fantastic dinner we had at Just Asian. I went with my family and some friends. I was completely blown by the delicious food, great ambience and excellent service. I simply LOVED their Nasi Goreng,Just asian Bhetki fusionl,Udon noodles and being a Sushi addict I undoubtedly think its the BEST SUSHI I have had in Kolkata. I also strongly recommend their CARAMEL CUSTARD. Thankyou Just Asian and I shall be back very soon.

I loved the noodles here. I tried udan noodle and Soba noodle. Both were good. Kung pao chicken can be improved but it can depend on my taste as I find it salty a bit. I will be ordering soon. All the best team.

Just Asian is a newly opened restaurant on Prince Anwarshah connector road. Had read the review in t2 and since then was planning to visit. Eventually on Tuesday, went all the way from Alipore. Was amazed to see the ambiance! The entire ambiance has a very soothing touch. The staffs were courteous and was always ready to help. Now about the food! I am not that fond of Sushi but my husband craves for it. He had his Sushi platter and Sashimi and I believe he went gaga on these two items. I didn't take any risk but ordered for Yaki Udon noodles, fish yakitori and also ordered for prawn tempura. I must tell you that each item was delicious! The noodle was something great and I would go there time and again to have yaki udon noodles and so is my husband for the sushi. At the end we had caramel custard and I couldn't resist from taking 2 more Â as parcel. As a Tolly Club member we were offered 10% discount and was also handed over the privilege card. I would recommend everyone to try out Just Asian. The food, the ambiance amazing.

Had been to this place under different name Wasabee. Came to know from a friend about Just Asian opening at the same place by the main Partner running Wasabee. My friend also recommended to have Sushi Platter, Chicken Basil Cup and Seafood Hibachi and hence we had our mind set. The ambiance and decor have totally changed by Just Asian. It's more classy, more spacious and have tremendous positive vibes generated from the art wall they have. We took Chicken Basil Cup as starter with a mocktail called Chilli Gondhoraj. Chicken Basil cup was out of the world and have never had such a delicacy earlier. Chilli Gondhoraj was something really exciting but definitely be careful with the chilli taste. Sushi Platter!!!!!!! I must tell you you would neither experience such a presentation and nor the quality and authenticity in Kolkata at least. It was awesome! I have had Wasabi paste in many restaurants but haven't had such Wasabi earlier. Upon enquiring the owner informed that like most of the restaurants they don't use wasabi powder and dilute them with water. I had to request him to arrange a Wasabi paste for me. Last but not the least, Seafood Hibachi was delicious and the steaming flavour itself was tempting! The amount of seafood such as squid, prawn and Octopus they filled up with it was Â beyond expectation. A highly recommended place if you are fond of Japanese and Oriental cuisine.

WOW SUPERB!!! Just Asian, what a place to have the best quality Oriental Cuisine and at such affordable price! I was floored to see the interior. A classic interior with a Art Wall stating 'buy for a cause'! What about 'dine for a cause'then? Couldn't be more than happy when the management informed that a part of the revenue goes for the charity of children and senior citizens! Hats off Just Asian! Who else could think of opening the restaurant with 25 under privileged children!!!!!!

Was already mesmerized with the interior and the initiative for social cause taken by Just Asian. More was to come when my mother being a senior citizen was given complimentary dish. I had my favourite Sushi Platter and let me be honest that such quality and authentic Sushi is not only difficult to get in Calcutta but only few outlets in Mumbai and Delhi can come at par. We had Mixed Meat Yaki Udon Noodles, Fish Yakitori, Chicken Basil Cup and Dim sum Platter. One must try all these items and specially the dim Â sum platter. They are unique in colors and melts in your mouth. The surprises were not over as we were handed over the Privilege card.

Friends don't miss this place and don't miss out on the Privilege Card.

Had gone with family of 5 to celebrate my wife's birthday. Â It was Friday and as expected the restaurant was quite packed. Since we were there to celebrate a special occasion, we decided to try for non conventional items. We had ordered for one whole fusion bhetki, on rock lobster along with normal Chinese fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. A complimentary fish item was served to my father who is a senior citizen. This is a great initiative which Just Asian is taking and is very touching. The bhetki and the lobster were out of this world. Even the normal Chinese food we ordered for were really tasty. The service was prompt and very professional. At the end we were given a Privilege card. A very satisfying dining out on a special day. Highly recommended and one must try the bhetki and the lobster. Thank you Just Asian. Best wishes!

Have been hearing about Just Asian for some time now. Having spent in Japan for 3 years I always crave for good Japanese food and have tried everywhere in Kolkata. In some places they are moderately ok and in most places they are only Japanese by name and not by taste. Â So far Pan Asia has been been my favorite. Was a bit apprehensive when I learnt Just Asian is in the same place where Wasabee used to be because during my visit to Wasabi 6 months back my food experience was not upto the expectation. However when I entered Just Asian I was amazed to see the changes in the decor and the ambiance! What a fantastic transformation! We ordered for Sushi platter, Tamaki Sushi, Sashimi and Octopus Golden curry. I must tell you keeping Pan Asia in mind I have no hesitation to mention that Sushi Platter and Maki Sushi what we had in Just Asian are the best in Kolkata. Sashimi was also too good but my only suggestion is that they should also consider raw salmon other than smoked salmon only. Couldn't believe the total bill came to less than 2700/-. I can bet no restaurant in Kolkata can offer such quality of Japanese cuisine at this rate. Â The octopus in golden curry was fresh and meaty and not the frozen one which generally others serve. Be careful of the Wasabi paste! They don't use wasabi powder to dilute with water but the real imported Japanese wasabi tube which I don't think any restaurant does. Service was prompt and the staffs were always on their toes to help us and the owners were on the floor supervising everything and talking to the guests. What else one wants! There are many items in their menu which we could not have in one visit. Next time we would like to try the other items. Those who are fond of Japanese cuisine Just Asian is highly recommended. Don't miss this place. Â Well done Just Asian, keep it up!

4 of us had suddenly visited Just Asian on last Wednesday at around 10pm. We had 1 each of Nearbuy and Little coupon for set meal. To our surprise the restaurant was literally packed and hence we were not very confident of proper service specially against coupons. But the staffs and management were very courteous to make us feel comfortable. Now coming to the 5 course meal against coupon, each and every item was simply Yummy. Though none of us are fond of veg, the Veg Manchurian was delicious and different! Be it noodles, chicken or fish , they were simply superb!!! We really had good food in a good and cool ambiance. The owner himself came to our table to enquire. The only thing which we could request him is to consider to increase the number of pieces of fish and chicken items. They are so tasty and delicious that only 6 pieces are not enough :) Keep the good work going Just Asian! Next time we will visit to taste the special dishes! Friends, a highly recommended place!

I went there with my friends on a 5 course meal lunch. The offerings were attractive, so we went there.
In starter, there was chicken sweet corn soup and then green chilli fish, soup was good but the fish was really tasty, though only small 3 pieces of it. After this comes, egg Hakka noodles which was pathetic and chicken Manchurian maybe compared with sugarcane juice, it was very sweet indeed not liked at all. Next comes, chicken fried rice, another bad item, bland in taste. Moreover, the quantity of the rice and noodles was not at all satisfying, I felt the soup was more in quantity rather. They charge less obviously, it's 450 for 2 people though even asked for the bill they dint gave us the bill, though it's not their fault completely, we were about to avail a coupon to get this offer of 5 course mean at 450 bucks, but they said we can pay the money offline too so they just denied the bill. It was a messy event indeed, food quality is certainly good but the quantity and taste is just very disappointing, hopefully, they will buck up to satisfy their customers from the next time.

Such authentic food! Our favourites were the maki sushi, teriyaki chicken and of course, the mixed dim sum platter. Can't wait to go back! Really pleasant ambience and attentive staff ....oh and their signature gondhoraj chilli lemon mocktail is such an adventure in itself . Topped off the meal with a really light yet delicious dessert of darsaan and vanilla ice cream. Highly recommend Just Asian.

'Dine for a cause'! I never knew there could be any restaurant in Kolkata which contributes a percentage of sales for the welfare of children and senior citizens needing special care! I am not aware that there is any restaurant other than Just Asian which offers complimentary dishes to any senior citizen! I had no idea that a restaurant can offer special discount on allocated days to Teachers and Doctors. That too when the prices are sooooo affordable and reasonable without compromising on the quality and quantity. I was emotionally touched when the owner informed me that the inauguration of Just Asian was done by 25 under privileged children followed by sit down dinner with the management of Just Asian. JUST ASIAN PLEASE TAKE A BOW! Same place there used to be Wasabee earlier owned by a musician of Kolkata. I have the experience of dining there. But the exorbitant price not matching with the quality forced me to stop going there. When you enter Just Asian, you will firstly fall in love with the decor and specially the art wall displaying paintings of upcoming artists which says 'Buy for a cause'. The entire earning from this goes for charity it seems! If it is true then I would say WOW! WHAT A UNIQUE INITIATIVE! Then comes the food! Sushi platter of Just Asian is by far the best in town. The colorful Dimsum- I don't know whether you would get them in any other restaurant! Nasi Goreng I tasted for the first time in Kolkata and I fell in love with this Indonesian rice! I would recommend all my friends not to miss out Just Asian and not to forget to collect your loyalty card. Since initially Just Asian is not charging 18% GST and with the loyalty card in hand, you will get more than 30% cash back from your next visit onward. I wish I could rate them 10 out of 5 :) Keep it up Just Asian!

A recently opened restaurant in place of wasebee. Visited the place for the first time and m too amazed. The ambience was too good with a calmness and noise free. The interior decor was nicely done with proper arrangements of lights and all those frames. One of the best place to hangout in town. Coming to the foods, actually there was a lot but tried the chinese and all the dishes are made with proper care. Staffs are well behaved and not let u hunting for anything , too much conscious. Those who love continental should visit this place for sure.

This is a very recently opened Asian restaurant. We had a really good first time experience. The waiters and the manager was Really courteous. The ambience could be a bit better. And they took a significant amount of time to serve the food. But the food was delicious. We had ordered the prawn sea weed dim sum and chicken basil cup for starters. The sushi platter and the chicken and prawn hibachi. All of them were really really good especially the sushi. You should definitely try it out :)
