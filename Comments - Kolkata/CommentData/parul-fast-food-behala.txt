As a snacks bar it's quite famous in surroundings.Have ordered mughlai paratha and chicken pakora. Good food. Since a long back I take away from this outlet. This Place is not so decorated as well but they serve the food is really satisfying.

This place serves good and quick fast food. The food tastes good and is of a better quality than the fast food centers around it but that being said most of the items on the menu strangely tastes the same.
Mughlai and chowmein are really good!

This is one of the fast food joints I have been visiting for so many years now. Serves really great chicken cutlet,butter fish, fish fingers etc. Their chicken roll is superb as they are one of the few joints who fry the chicken with gravy on spot, really brings out the spicyness. One of the most popular fast food joints in behala.

Its a local Fast Food Joint and attracts real crowd and have to wait for 10 mins to actually get hold of the order. The BUTTER FISH FRY & CHICKEN CHOWMIEN are must TRY over here and even the Spring Roll is really good.. I've tasted here BUTTER FISH FRY so many times that I dont even know..

Its more of a take away junction. However if u want they can serve you in plates.

Coming to the food, they sell almost all kind of junk foods starting from rolls to chowmiens...fries to pakodas,  Drumsticks to Kabiraji ,momos to kathi kebabs...and a lot more....Food quality is good and also pocket friendly...They taste good for a para fast food joint...I can bet that people from pretty far places come to buy stuff... Like ME!!

readers discretion is requested...score of 4 is given only based on the variety of products they dish out for the rate they charge...it has gone up in the last few years actually just because it has been so popular...

a small para fast food joint...which dishes items from rolls to chowmiens...fries to pakodas, momos to kathi kebabs...and a lot more....and it is fast food for real, amidst extreme busy times they will still be able to give you the order in 10mins max...and they taste good for a para fast food joint...i can bet that people from pretty far places come to buy stuff...

at one point sometime last year, they introduced biriyani, in order to move to a new section but stopped...seems like thats an area they failed and realised pretty quickly that sticking to the simplest form is the safest bet...

again, people reading this revie might have had stomach aches after eating from Parul but you cant ignore the food from this place...readers discretion requested... :)))

In a rush to reach home... You are around Roy Bahadur Road?? Suddenly a phone call from home... They ask you to bring some food... Don't worry... This is the right place with the right price... Plentiful, tummy filling food a just the right price... Go grab buy and feel the real taste of street n quick food... The most well behaved shop keepers... And they let u know just wen ur food will be ready... Call dem before... That would be great...

Parul fast food centre is quite a popular take away junction in roy bahadur road just beside mitra sangha club.  Coming to the food,  they sell almost all kind of junk foods starting from chops to chowmein... Cutlets to kebabs... Drumsticks to fish fry and rolls also..  Food quality is good and also pocket friendly...  Happy to hop in whenever you are hungry and hate to travel much...
