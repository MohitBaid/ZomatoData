The decor is amazing and no doubts about it. I loved the store and the collection. The cafe is not that big but it's not too small too. The only thing I was disappointed with was the menu. The menu was way too overrated and didn't have that huge variations.

I absolutely adore and LOVE this place.  It simply synchronizes with me.  Beautiful,  absolutely beautiful.  

I love their items so don't know what to praise over what! It's  great to have such a quaint place in South Calcutta.  
Starting from the decor to the food.  Everything is simply awesome for my taste.  

The pesto pasta and the ice cream with brownie are my usuals. 

Don't forget to check out their cafe store on your way out.

One of the most popular hangouts in Kolkata - specially for the artsy crowd - Sienna is a cafe with a concept. Housed right inside a store which sells sustainable fashion clothes & accessories, it's got a menu to match the boutique concept. Their drinks are quite nice, and the food is yum too. Specially love their Chicken Pesto Pasta and sandwiches. Their desserts are quite delectable too, and some days you get specials that are too yummy to miss!The space is small, but the decor and ambience more than makes up for it, and the things I like the most are the beautiful crockery they use!A definite must-visit for people on Kolkata, even if you are a tourist visiting the city.

when you are sick or sad head to sienna and drink their spicy hot chocolate (the best in town), along with some munchies like fried chicken with salad. It lifts your mood and you feel better instantly!

This hole in wall café is a delight to look at, although small in size it got style, a blend of modern, chic and natural, don’t know how best to describe it, maybe posh. My friend had recommended the place for its hot chocolate and that’s all we ordered. It did turn out to be the best one I have ever had. I had ordered the chili version, it was thick hot chocolate with a dash of chilies and few marshmallows on the side, to be used as dip-ins when the going got too hot. Trust me when I say the hot chocolate was out of this world. The utensils added to the charm, most seemed hand pottered, each one a unique piece. They even sell these to those interested. 

This is a place I would love to come back to, can’t wait to try other items on the menu along with the hot chocolate again.

Front side its garment store and backside it's been turned into a cafe.Well if you prefer more of ambience and decoration of a place over food then this place is definitely for you.Well maintained,decorated place apt location for any photoshoot.They have a limited space but utilized smartly.
But if you are a food person then this place might be a bit disappointing for you.Firstly they have a very limited menu .Some of the items are overpriced to the quantity they serve.We ordered chicken cheese sandwich and hot chocolate.The size of the sandwich was really a tiny one.But the taste was good.Anyway i repeat it is a good place for photography.And the staffs are ignorant to you and are busy with their own staffs.Half of the seats were reserved in such a small place.The only thing to recommend is to add up more items to their menu.Thats it.

On a rainy Saturday afternoon in Kolkata you do not usually feel like going out, that too for brunch. But just in case you don't feel like lazying the day at home, this place will not disappoint you.
Me and a bunch of my friends had been smitten by the pictures of this Cafe for long and finally when we made it there the feeling wasn't different at all. 
The store had some really beautiful accessories and goodies for shopping. And the first thing you do when you reach there is explore around the place and click pictures. 
And once you get tired of the photo session you finally decide to order food. :p
1. French fries- one of the best I have ever had. It's very home-made types and a must try for all potato lovers. It comes with a schezwan sauce to enhance the taste. 
2. Masala Tea-the rainy day definitely called for this and being an ardent tea fan, had to order this and it's was amazing. 
3. Chicken and cheese sandwich- it was decent in taste but a Lil oily. So watch out if you are on a diet. 
The veg cheese sandwich on the other hand wasn't grilled and had a lot of lettuce which made it dry. 
4. Mutton minced pizza-it had a thin crust base and the minced mutton was extremely spicy. 
5. Chicken pasta in mixed sauce-the best dish of the day I would say, the sauce was well balanced with flavors and the pasta was perfectly cooked. 
6. Roasted chicken and Barley- the chicken was perfectly roasted and was very tender unlike how it looked. The barley was a great accompaniment to the the chicken and melted in the mouth. However a lot of oil had settled at the base of the plate which didn't seem healthy. 
7. Hot chocolate- my friends loved this and said it was one of the best hot chocolates they ever had. The highlight was the bunny shaped marshmallows in the hot drink. This drink also gelled perfectly with the cold weather.
Overall a must visit place. 
Ambience - 5/5
Food - 5/5
Service - 4/5
That was it about my experience at Sienna. Hope to visit the place again to enjoy the warm sunshine on a wintry morning.

This cafe is a bit overpriced! I tried a lot of dishes and sadly it was not upto the mark. Their hot chocolate and alfredo pasta is good but the others were not good. 
The store has beautiful collection of jute bags, ear rings etc.  but those are pretty expensive!!!

Observing the hype, I had decided to go to this place for lunch. The food was decent. The hot chocolate was impressive. The place is small and cosy but the staff wasn’t friendly or welcoming. I have been to many similar cafes and usually the staff greets you with a warm smile. This place gave such cold vibes. At the billing counter, I felt as if I wasn’t paying the entire bill amount or I just got done with an argument with the cashier. Cafes are meant to be warm and welcoming, not with an arrogant bunch of staff members. Yikes. 
Giving a cafe an earthy or boho decor doesn’t make it a hit. I don’t think I can visit this place again.

The caffe is a must visit. Its cosy interior, its wall decor, lighting ,ambience. Everything just keeps me want for more. 
Coming to the food, honestly I never had such a good spicy hot chocolate ever in my life. Rest of the foia itens are all good and quantity wise also cool.But the beverages are extremely reasonable in price. 
All in all I would definitely want to visit it again and again.

Been here a few times. The decor of this place is absolutely amazing and aesthetically pleasing. 
It is a very cozy and simple place.
The hot chocolate is the very good and the celery cucumber juice is refreshing.
The food was a bit disappointing due the portion size compared to the price.
We had order cheese and chicken sandwich and spaghetti with sun-dried tomato sauce. The sandwich was okayish and the spaghetti was also nothing great. The beverages and desserts are nice though.

Holy guacamole ! Ok first things first...... Anybody who knows me (nobody does), knows I can be critical. But generally tend to be kind to a place with heart. And that pretty much summarizes how I feel about Sienna.... a place with heart. There is plenty this small cafe has pioneered in the city obsessed and content with mediocrity.  From salad's with caramelized walnuts, to avocado smoothies * creative aesthetic use of scarce space ... all at a reasonable price. I wonder if growing up the young pretty girl, usually smoking a cigarette with a hollow stare (owner's daughter), would turn out to become like her mother, who seems to lead by example with the sweetest, widest smile, being completely hands on, on occasion serving the guest's on their table. (Even if not, she'd be a sight for sore eyes). Don't get me wrong, there's plenty here they can improve, but let's be serious, as reviewers n customer's we should introspect n wonder if we are the best there is. Now before ever joining a review site (i.e - before today), I would have been weary of giving an establishment maximum stars, I mean c'mon, what does that imply, that there's no better place imaginable than the one you're giving 5 stars too ....but maybe I'm just turning into a softy with age,or maybe the girl's face reminds me of warm melancholy and depression. What the hell, no one's really anticipating my thoughts, and more likely than not, this is more about my need to be heard than anything else (which quite frankly is insanely depressing in itself). Tips - Try the pomelo salad or quinoa bowl.... place has plenty of options but since I'm veg can only stick to those suggestions... celery juice is nice... the mint cooler (which they've stopped making was excellent), cakes are decent and not excessively sweet. The patrons here are sometimes chilled out, but more often than not it's full with pseudo college crowd, a harsh reminder of the dumbness existing in the city. If it's the first time you're visiting, I'd suggest, looking up directions on the GPS....it's in one of the lanes near 'purna das road'....few landmark restaurant's etc. nearby. Wi fi speed is good. (Note to Sienna - You may provide plastic disposable straws, I realize you'll are being creative, but c'mon, a little understanding goes a long way).

The look and feel, the ambience and seating all lovely. The food presentation is something I liked. It's priced a little higher than reasonable. Has indoor seating and outdoor seating with a small seating area in the backyard. Plus you also get to shop stuff like accessories, clothes, bags and all boho decors.

After a long wait for a laid-back cafe, Kolkata lastly has its perfect cafe. I am so much head over heels in love with this cafe & store in blue, that I find everything beautiful about it and my term 'bluetiful' suits it aptly.Situated in the by-lanes of Hindusthan Park, Sienna Store & Cafe is a boutique store and cafe with shuttered windows, doors, mosaic-tables all in blue. It is beautifully decorated with handmade decor items and fairy lights that give the place a magical charm. I love the sandwiches, simple but served like a dream. If you want to find the best pasta in town, the one that Italians would be proud of, you should order the pasta here. My favourite is the one with sundried tomatoes. The lebur jol, the juices are served in canisters and the thing that you cant beat is they have copper straws if you want any. The thing that you would die for are the cakes. Its very difficult to name one, because the goodies baked in the kitchen is not only a delight to look at but even is a treat to all the senses. You could smell the spices wafting into the air, the lusciousness of the baked goods in front of your eyes and when you taste them, each flavour sends a gastronomic revolution inside you. This my to-go place anytime, for anything. 

You can read more about this place on my website or see images on my instagram profile.

This small and cosy cafe is located at hindusthan park just beside newly opened Saha Textiles.. this cafe is inside the store which mainly deals with handicrafts and dresses... Capacity is very less with a number of 10 tables.. but this small place never failed to amaze me with its decoration and ambience.. now I am a little bit disappointed with the food menu they provide.. the price is quite high comparatively and quality of food is not worth the price.. infact variety is also absent in the menu card.. we took one banana cinnamon shake, lebu jol, chicken fry with salad and cheese sandwich.. food was okayish.. so yeah if u wanna click and get clicked this place is definitely a must visit... overall had a good time.. :)

I must say I am disappointed.  I had expected much. I visited sienna on a fine winter evening. The place was very crowded. Hardly got any place to sit. 
Location: its easy to find using Google map. Near Basanti Devi College. 
Decor & Ambience: loved the decor. Every bit of the decor has elegance. Cozy place. 
Food: ordered banana cinnamon milkshake and burger platter. The platter had a chicken burger, fries and a salad served with 2 sauces. The burger was the saviour of the day. It had thick juicy patty. But i have had better. The salad was not upto the mark. Fries were hot and crunchy. The milkshake was good. Not too good not too bad. Mediocre. 
Service: here's the disappointing part. Ok i consider the part that the place was crowded. I asked for water. Even after finishing the food no water arrived. But the milkshake was served without straw. Salad served with burger had no fork no spoon. No napkin. These things are basics. Straws, spoons & napkins should be served with the food. If crowding is the problem the waiter should take time to attend you. Food should take time. Not these problems which i faced. 
Verdict: good for one time visit. Price bit on the costlier side.

You are greeted with twinkly fairy lights as soon as you spot the place in one of the bylanes near Hindustan Park. 

When you enter, you need to go through the 'store' section , selling various items of clothing, bags, books as well as little trinklets and scented oils and more. 

As you venture into the cafe, you are provided with two seating options - indoors/outdoors. Since it was a cool winter evening in Calcutta, we decided to sit outdoors. The decor is very pretty and soothing, There are fairy lights everywhere and you feel like you are sitting in a coffee shop somewhere in Europe.

I called for a caramel cappucino, which was served with a cookie, whereas my friend called for a hot chocolate. The cappucino was strong with just the right amount of sugar coming from the caramel. We also tried the non-veg Quinoa bowl, as it looked like something which is not your standard cafe fare in most places. Looking at the menu, the items were all quite intriguing and not the usual burgers or sandwich and chips that you find in most coffee shops. Cannot wait to come back and try some other dishes. 

We really wanted to try out the chocolate hot pot for dessert but it was sadly unavailable and all they had in dessert options were some sad looking muffins on a cake stand. 

But overall, I absolutely fell in love with the decor of the cafe, The perfect places to spend a quiet evening just catching up with your loved ones or also spending some quality time with yourself :)

This is featured in Kolkata's hidden gems and finding this place can be lil difficult. Somehow after roaming in the winding lanes of Hindustan Park for a while, we found this cafe. The famous Saha Textile Shop can be your cue to find the correct lane. Amazing interiors and even better food. Coffee was okay but the fettuccine pasta was delicious!

Aesthetically decked up and hence appealing to the senses, a visit to Sienna is nothing less than an experience.
The matte textures, subdued lights, punched up with the ceramic magic, gives you the right throb to your heart.
But how I desired to be equally generous with my remarks on their food! Just the regular latte, with the kind gesture of a Madeleine to it. Had a slice of date-walnut cake; most unappealing to the palate - dry and marked with an excess.

Sienna was on our bookmarked list for a really long time because it looks really artistic and photogenic in the reviews. Unfortunately, our visit wasn't that good and we couldn't take proper pictures on our first visit.

When we reached Sienna at around 3 PM on a Tuesday, there was hardly any room to walk or sit. The place was way too crowded, we browsed the store for a few minutes, had a coffee and left.

The place is quite easy to locate, it is a store + cafe. But it's really suffocating when crowded. Seating feels cramped. 

Don't know if others would feel the same, but we like places with lots of light and air, felt it would be best enjoyed when less crowded.

The tables don't have menu cards, there is a blackboard on which the available items and their prices are written. Indoor seating is cute, and outdoor seating has a glass roof. Coffee was decent. Would try to go again on a day to click better photos.

We had ordered Avocado Tortilla Salad, Spaghetti Aglio Olio, Iced Mocha, Iced Black tea and Almond Finacier with Ice-cream n green apples.
The food is average. The almond finacier with ice-cream was nice.
The thing I loved about this place is the ambience.

Sienna Store and Café, Hindustan Park, Kolkata
The ‘Sienna Store and Café’ is a cafe come boutique store, which, is situated in one of the most popular areas of Kolkata city, near the Southern Avenue. Apparently it is the favourite hangout place for people from all age groups be it young socialites, health concious souls, young beloveds and especially for those who appreciate cultural designs and ethnic jewelry, there is a little something for everyone.
As you enter the place you get the feeling of old meeting the new, which obviously is the case as it is the ground floor of an old South Kolkata building. The entire area is very aesthetically divided into the cafe seats and tables and the boutique, with cute coffee tables and cozy seats and rustic walls with the food menu written on blackboards.  Sitting in any table you have a wonderful view of the workshop-like kitchen where you can see the chefs working. The boutique is aptly decorated with roughly styled mannequins bamboo stools unkept draping of displays. But the most unique decorative pieces are the recycled heads of deities that are scrapped after festivals.
The menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering starters soups, finger foods salads, meals and desserts, with one thing being common, which is, health. I personally had their coffee and salted caramel brownie which were delicious with just the right amount of sugar. There is also a wide variety of healthy salads and yummy finger foods. Just the right amount of food required to accompany your heart to heart conversation with your company. The prices are decent, not extremely cheap yet not extremely high. The only criticism is for the service, orders are to be given at the main counter, which is still fine, but there are no menu cards for each table. This might be because of the eco friendly notion of the place as they refuse to use straws or napkins.
Despite the  high price of the food and the not so attentive waiters´ service, I had a pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavours. For this reason I highly recommend going to the Sienna cafe.

Although the ambience of the place is soothing and the decor is great but the food is hugely overpriced and there is nothing exceptional about the quality. We went there on two occasions, the last time we had a latte, a cappuccino, French fries and grilled cheese sandwiches. The bill amounted to 611 rupees, and it took them forever to serve the French fries.

One of the few cafes I had been wanting to go for a very long time because if it's splendid interiors and a variety if sandwiches and salads !
I ordered -
✓Ham and cheese sandwich
✓Avogado​ salad
✓Mochachino
✓Cappuccino

Out of the above mentioned​ Avogado salad is their signature dish and I loved the Mochachino flavour along with the cake !

➡️Service - 4.5/5
➡️Decor and ambience- 5/5
➡️Pocket pinch- 3.8/5
➡️Food quality and quantity - 4.6/5
➡️Menu variety-4.5/5

I will strongly recommend you to pay a visit at this beautiful cafe which even has a boutique for variety of items.Situated very near Vivekananda park this place will never fall short of woo-ing you !

The best cafe in town!
To be very honest the amazing unique artistic decorations, utilization of old tin boxes, the glass roof with plants hanging fro everywhere, stole my heart! oh I love it!
I really admire the interior decorator!
The food was good! Coffee everything was normal. A bit costly I might say. 
You can just sit there....reading a book or with a laptop...there is plug point in every table...
The store in front offers good collection of handloom products..kurtas, ornaments, very offbeat....diaries etc
This place is so beautiful with each wall so unique from one another...you can get atleast 10 different beautiful pictures of yours.

Been here quite a bit. Love the food and ambiance. This time, though, the food was mediocre at best and the service was unbecoming of such an establishment. Hence the 1 rating. 

Food first:
Aglio oglio- the taste was good but the portion size does not justify the 300 rupee price tag. 

Olive and egg sandwich- overloaded with garlic paste, mashed up eggs and Olives for 175. They need to scrap this item. 

Fries- the best thing I’ve had at this place. They didn’t serve the homemade chilli sauce with it though, despite saying they would. 

Coming to the service- when we arrived, there happened to be an empty glassbottle of water on the side of our table. We’d been sitting there working for hours. The bottle accidentally fell (because the table was on wheels for some reason). They didn’t seem to care whether I was hurt, and casually called someone to clean the floor (not all shards were removed still). The worst bit- when we went to pay our bill, after paying, we saw they had charged us for the broken bottle of water. To top it all, they kept insisting we would have to pay for that broken bottle. I asked them to view the cctv footage as to how that bottle fell, since there was no contact by us. Also, how pathetic and cheap is it of a reputed cafe to charge you for a broken bottle? We were disgusted by the behaviour of the staff(who are also somehow always too busy) and the cashier, who told us we had no choice but to pay. Finally, one of the senior managers intervened and told he cashier to give us a refund for that bottle. NO APOLOGIES. Like they were doing us a favour by refunding that amount. This used to be one of my favourite places to hang out in the city. I’ll be looking for alternatives now.

The first thing that would draw attention about this place is it's interior. Not very bright nor drab. Meticulously designed and thoughtful use of material in the interiors are sure to draw your attention. 
The tuna salad and the chocolate peppermint cupcakes are must try. 
One should preferably visit in the evening to experience the lighting arrangement in the external sitting area.

I dont usually post reviews about a place on Zomato but in this case i couldnt help myself.Located on a small street near Hindustan Park this is the place you are looking for if u want a cup of coffee and something to go along with it.The food and services were pretty good and the prices reasonable.Coming to the thing that struck me most was the interior decorations.It is bound to create a vibe as soon as you enter the front door.Each nook and corner was meticulous decorated and each frame perfectly thought out and designed.The music was good too which made the ambience and the food all the more enjoyable.Highly recommend if cafes are to your taste..

The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star, is that I had to wait very long for my chicken. The food However is brilliant and so is the ambience! The cakes look beautiful and are mouth watering. I did not try a slice in this visit,  maybe next time!

A very cosy cafe with a very positive vibe! Loved the blue dominant decor with minimal but very effective interiors as well as outdoors. Though the food is overpriced and overrated, I tried the almond financier cake which was like a tiny sliver on a plate, but damn it was good! Coffee was ok and honestly didn't enjoy my bacon and tomato sandwich.
Also, to bring to note that we found the behaviour of the stewards is very casual. They almost didn't want to listen to what we were asking or saying. Though the food, however average it was, came to us within 15-20 mins on a weekday evening.
Go just for a cuppa and the ambience maybe?

Sienna Cafe.. a place that got me at hello. <3

If you are a first time visitor and someone who hasn't researched well about the place ,you're gonna feel deceived Because it's a cafe and store. A store of handmade clothes and accessories ,rustic cutlery etc.
But dude, once you enter further, your eyes will be in for a treat!
What a BEAUTIFUL place!! Just Perfect for romantic dates or for just having a relaxing experience with anyone whosoever. I kept staring all around, adoring every little corner which was designed so splendidly. It is the kind of place where you can even go alone and have a great time with yourself.

They don't play loud urban music , which is the most irritating part of majority of the cafes in town. The music they played only added to the tranquility of the place.

They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but the outdoor seating here is different. Unlike other places offering the same, here they've got a kind of translucent roof which is beautifully decorated, and lets just the right amount of sunlight to seep in. There are air conditioners even in the outdoor area which makes it all the more comfortable at any given point of the day.

Coming to service.. yes it is slow, but then in a place like this, you don't really wanna leave soon, so it didn't bother me .
Staff can be a bit more cheerful . They all had a very grave expression on their faces, which didn't go down very well with me.

We ordered a hot cappuccino and an iced one ,both of which were prepared really well.
But the star of the show, the literal Rockstar was the HOT CHOCOLATE.
Yess it's the best hot chocolate you'll find in town.
Right from the first sip to the last one , you'll utter a 'wow'. Just the right amount of sweetness, just the right amount of chocolaty flavour, just the right proportion , just the right kind of consistency. It was out of the world and I mean it 😍

Pocket pinch is moderate. I felt the food items are rather unfairly priced as compared to the beverages.

So guys, a visit to this etheral place is highly recommended. It's a gem of a place in Kolkata and I don't think any other can give u a similar experience.

Cheers !

This was not a very nice experience. 

This is a small cafe behind a boutique. A very beautiful and well decorated place.  But most of the dishes in the menu were not available. We ordered spaghetti pesto pasta and was served with flat noodles. 

The hot chocolate and cappuccino were good. 

The two star is only for the ambience and decor. 

To the owner of the cafe, ask your staff to at least smile and be polite.

Very small space for a cafe. Good for being on your own alone or as a couple. But intelligent set of seating all around. It is a small narrow place inside and out. Been there one very rainy afternoon and enjoyed my time there. 
The food is excellent with a very big portion size. Taste is to be sought for and served in delightful ceramics and cutlery. The menu is relatively small but we liked every dish we ordered. 
Serving may be slightly slow for some dishes--15/20mins but not too much to complain of. 
There is also a small boutique attached which I didn't think was too well stocked in terms of variety but one can certainly browse around and maybe pick a piece. 
Would highly recommend this place if you can overlook the space.

A very pretty cafe with intricate decor, excellent ambience and an extremely incompetent kitchen which would offer competition to snails. My mother and I visited and ordered two cappuccinos  and assorted vegetable fritters. When they could not serve any of these in 40 minutes I cancelled the fritters as they said the coffee is ready. Any enquiry at any time regarding when my order would be served was met with 'in a few minutes'. Finally I had to cancel the entire order and leave. Not all of your customers would have the entire day to while away at your beautiful cafe. Some of us actually have work to do as well. If you're incapable of serving food on time at least have the decency to communicate the same. It would eventually help you more than a fancy menu with fancier prices.

Service was good. Staff were okish.

Food menu presentation was unique.

Food (veg) was good and different than usual flavours, that's because have different kind of menu, different than the normal cafes are offering.

All in all a good experience.

I've stayed away from Sienna Cafe so far. It never gave me the welcoming vibe. As I am sitting here right now, my assumption is proved just right. It's a place apt for the Instagram crowd - that comes here to take selfies and check in, kindly don't think you will be served food. The staff isn't trained to serve food or provide hospitable behavior. Indifference and Apathy is what you'll get adequately. The staff doesn't know or understand (or pretends not to) the menu (which might I add is precariously positioned at the entrance which you'll be blocking while you try to comprehend the menu). 

We came here due to Facebook check ins - and I realize it's just that - a place to check in. I'll stick to my instincts next time and go to Cafe Byloom across the street instead. 

We shall be walking from here to Bedwin to get some real food because two teeny tiny slices of bread with an excuse for chicken smell doesn't count for a sandwich for any of the three of us. Also we have been waiting 50 mins for the Black Rice Aracini. Thank you so very much Sienna Cafe, Hindusthan Park Kolkata.

I was mesmerized by the beauty of the place - Inside and out!
The place is absolutely serene and cozy and a marvellous creation of art. I am totally in love with this place. The food is delicious and the quality of service is efficient. Me and my friend called for two bacon tomato and avocado sandwich, coffee for me and belu Jol for the friend. The bacon was crispy, just the way we liked it and the every ingredient looked fresh and tasted yummy. The ambience of the place is in itself a bonus, attracting people from every culture and space to this amazingly beautiful cafe. Loved and enjoyed the experience here.
Highly recommended.

Are you kidding? This place is a must visit. It's charming, romantic, breathtaking, vivid, nostalgic (this list is only going to go on). Their stuff with Avocado in it is fabulous, and their spicy hot chocolate is the best I have ever tasted (including various places in Europe).

They keep trying a range of interesting dishes (like jhol). The best way to order is to ask the owner to bring what she likes. After coming here a while, I still haven't tired of the food.

At first I thought the prices were a bit high, but I no longer believe so. I think they use high quality locally grown ingredients (some of which apparently come from a garden in Shantineketan). If you order the avocado salad, you'll realize they're not skimping like other places might. Hi five for at least a good attempt towards local sourcing and organic, even though they're not all the way there yet.

A note on the crockery. It's simply divine. There is not a single restaurant that I have come across that even comes close to comparing. Luckily for me it's on sale right next door.

I don't usually give a five on Zomato, because I think that something better might come along. But finally I think here's a place that fully deserves the max score I can give it.

Very cute cafe in a store. I really feel it is important to encourage such cafes in India. It has a limited food menu (which I like) and a wide variety of tea and coffee. I found many reviewers have complained about the menu being on the wall rather than on cards on each table, but I felt that was part of the charm of a small cafe.
Ambience - Awesome. Super to meet up with friends. Air-conditioned, lovely decor
Food - Aglio olio was really, really good. Lots of olives and packed with flavour. Just the way I like it - olive oil, garlic and chilli flakes 🌶. The baked fish was not great. It had dried out. Probably needs some tweaking, this dish.
Service - pretty good, no issues at all

Quaint place. A concept of boutique cafe was long awaited around my area. I have been here from day1 and always love sitting by this place. Decent food. It has a better "in shop" quotient. I love their desserts.
Variety & choices are limited in the menu. The biggest let down is the delay in service. I have waited forever for my order. Another issue is the space crunch. So, if I feel like droppin in for coffee and cake there, I always have to keep a back up option as the place is nearly full most of the time.

Been here once. Had heard a lot !The ambiance and interior are simply breathtaking. The beauty of the intricately decorated walls and ceilings are beyond words. It has a number of seating areas, and each area has it's own beauty. The fact that it isn't air-conditioned doesn't discourage the innumerable customers at all.

Coming to the food, this place serves the best hot chocolate in town. There's no doubt in that. The chocolate is too pure and delicious!!
The food, however is disappointing. They need a major change in this area, and need to expand the menu carefully and smartly. The service was sadly very, very slow as we were made to repeat the same order thrice and pay frequent visits to the counter to get it sped up, and were also informed that most of the dishes we wanted were either discontinued or unavailable. Lastly, there was a mix up in an order that took forever to arrive, and the bill generation took another twenty minutes.

If they manage to offer proper dishes at an acceptable price, this place might as well become my favourite spot in the city for meet-ups and dates :)
The 3 rating is solely for the decor, ambiance and the hot chocolate. I will come back and upgrade it to a perfect 5 the day they improve their menu and service.

Hands down one of the finer cafés of kolkata. If you're an americano fan, this place is something that you won't regret since they clearly understand that it isn't something that you serve with garbage beans and chicory. The highlight however is in the details of the decor which makes it a bigger experience than just a regular cup of coffee.

The place is cramped and food options are really limited. The store part of course gives it a quirky and artsy feel which isn't there in many other cafes in kolkata.

To keep it short, I think this place needs to develop a lot. 
A quaint place though to hang out with the availability of reservation.I think they should have made menu cards rather than writing the names of the items on boards hanging from the wall.They took a long time to serve and the price comparatively is not that cheap.Coming to the food, the Tuna Sandwich was not that good though they term it as healthy. Other than that, the coffee varieties were just as they should be, nothing special.

Sienna Store and Cafe is one of those places in Calcutta which has started becoming over crowded these days! And why it shouldnt be? The vibes, the location, the good food and coffee, amazing ambience, creative crowd, and those lovely stuffs at the store - are enough to pull the crowd here. I am a frequent visitor at Sienna and I am in love with this place because of all the reasons one can love this cafe for. I personally love the Celery Cucumber, Almond Honey Cake slices, and Affogato (my utmost favorite) out here in Sienna. These are my must-haves from here!

Highly disappointed with this place !!
Been there on an evening around 6pm .. It was crowded but we managed to get a place. The ambience is nice , it gives a garden vibe. We opted for coffee and sandwich. The sandwich was stale and it was nothing compared to the price. We ordered hot coffee ,it came cold . I had heard good reviews about this place but my experience was horrible..

Let me first help you to locate the place :

If you are from South Kolkata and you know Byloom , it will be easy to locate as it is just opposite to Byloom . else you can go through the lane where the "hindusthan park" puja helds . or just take the lane beside "Kinnor kinnori" punjabi shop . 
The place was in my wish list from very long time . And finally managed to visit it today , on friendship day . And I swear , no point of disappointment . the tiny clumsy cafe with beautifully crafted decor and the artistic theme . oh I will suggest you to go there to fill the artistic essence there . 

If you reach there then don't forget to try their HOT CHOCOLATE anymore . It is awesome . stuffs were good , though busy . It will be easy for them if they can add few more stuffs there . 

I tried chicken n cheese sandwich , hot chocolate and Iced cappuccino . I loved the food . and the wooden tray .  another decoration there .

I am just impressed with the artist who has planned to make this cafe this much beautiful and different from any other places ..

Another cafe at the heart of Hindustan park that is drawing lot of crowd these days. The area is divided into 2 parts - a boutique at the beginning leading to the cafe inside. The most interesting part of the cafe is how they have utilized a very cramped up place with intelligent use of furnitures that fit perfectly giving an illusion of a large area . The cafe again has a small indoor sitting arrangement and outdoor arrangement. The decor again has been done intelligently. 
The process of ordering food is quite confusing. As there is no menu card but menus are writing in walls and boards scattered around. Neither they are easy to chose from. 
However, the quality of food specially desserts is very good. I have tried their Darjeeling tea, muffins, cake of the day which was a walnut cake on day and mango with nut cake on the other. Both were delicious. Peace loving might not like this place on a crowded day as people as too many people in a small place makes it chaotic  Staff is slow and themselves confused at times.

A small quite place with botique gallery & a cafe. The collection is decent but it's on an expensive side. Yet you won't mind paying if you want to support handloom workers 

It has an artistic decor which is unique mix of modern set up & traditional cutlery in modern format. With potted Plants on the side walls & simple decorative lighting makes your experience quite adorable. You can't miss the comfortable swing chair vyed by everyone there. The table tiled with pretty blue ceramics will grab your eyes for sure

Yes ther service is bit slow yet you don't mind it as it's a soothing place to spend some time reading or chatting. Though it's lil overtly done yet the blend of concept is nice

I found the food decently nice but food cannot be the reason for my repeat visit but the experience can. Being a coffee lover, I can say that it was a disaster.... Rest Pasta & salad was nice. 
Do try once for the experience...

Rated it 4 star because the staff is really friendly and courteous. This is somewhat of an art café. There is a store in front which sells beautiful merchandise. Coming on to the food, they provide various healthy options. Love the celery cucumber juice and watermelon juice. They also offer home-baked cakes. Love their pasta and chicken salad. Even hot chocolate is pretty good. Price is reasonable too.

Artistic decor , a bookshelf offering some pretty good books with beautifully plated dishes makes this cafe my current favourite cafe in Kolkata 

I wouldn't go too much into the quality of the coffee since my standard order everywhere is a shot of espresso with hot milk on the side which no restaurant can mess up or has messed up till date but my friend who had ordered a cappuccino on one visit and hot chocolate on another seemed delighted by them.

It's of course the decor which is my key hook for visiting this place but then again this is one of those few cafes which serves what I like to call 'real food' fresh , without added colours with a rustic appeal. The food is good. While the tuna sandwich was not bad there is nothing exquisite about it but then the arancini is what absolutely blew my mind away. Full points to the Chef for using our very own black rice which works beautifully with the mushrooms and mozzarella. They also have a non vegetarian option with ham and 2 of the 4 arancinis served is heavy enough for a light lunch for anyone with moderate appetite.

Unfortunately I have only visited the cafe during tea time so I'm yet to try out the interesting range of dishes offered for lunch or dinner which they serve throughout the day anyway. Other than the arancini nothing seemed that unique so if you are looking to explore new dishes in the city which you have never tasted before then this isn't your place but the dishes served to the other tables seemed wholesome and delicious and that's enough to make me want to try them. I fully recommend this cafe for a long chat with a friend or perhaps just enjoying a long date with a book. 

Service is slow which I feel is part of the beauty of this cafe . I hate fast food and quick service where you are expected to quickly eat and free your table. They have charging points and wifi.

This is a cafe within a art store on Hindustan Park. The place is neat but I felt was a bit cramped. Good decor but overly done at certain cases. The place has good beverage and cake options. But the food menu is bit too costly with the cheapest item placed at 220. Ordered a muffin with ice cream and a mango cake. Both were soft and tasted good.

There's hardly a thing that one can't like about Sienna Café. When I was in Delhi a couple of friends from Kolkata expressly told me that I'm going to love this place and boy, I do! When you enter the store you're immediately taken in by the clothes, bags, jewellery, cutlery and trinkets on display. I found most of them overrated for their style and quality, so I walked in to the café. It's a new age paradise: chic and kitcsh at the same time. I've only been drinking espresso for q while so my friend and I ordered three shots of it. And then came the food. I have never tasted arancinis so good: the deep fried balls of black rice and mozerella was sinful. We followed this up with four slices of home made bread - honestly I've had better home made bread before but the pesto dip was made to perfection. It also came with feta cheese and cherry tomatoes. The prices of the food are reasonable for their quality, portions and taste. Sienna café is going to be my haunt in this city whenever I am here. One could spend hours in this old-south-calcutta-house transformed into a very twenty first century continental café, using their free Wi-Fi or reading their commendable collection of books (Celan and Spivak included) or just sitting in their open air (albeit covered with a mesh and hanging lanterns) courtyard with friends talking endlessly. I love how much thought has gone into making this place what it looks like today. :)

P.s. did I mention their service is slow which works wonderfully for me because I wouldn't want to be rushed out of a place so beautiful too quickly. If you're lucky enough to find a place, stay put!

Firstly, it is totally untrue that meal for two is 500 bucks... We ordered a cup of tea and one dessert that cost us around 250 bucks... It is unbelievably expensive and you would get much better food at, I don't know, any other cafe... The staff doesn't cooperate and will make you feel really insignificant if you don't order a lot and talk and dress in a certain way... 
So if you are looking for a casual coffee time, please do not visit this place...

Serves the most terrible food you can ever find. Way too expensive and the most pretentious cafe you can ever find in Kolkata. The 1 rating is perhaps for the decoration of the cafe which is the only good thing. If you are rich and need to flaunt that for pathetic food then yes, this is the place for you.

P.S. they also sell souvenirs, ethnic wears and bags which will cost your kidney.

I am very sorry as the experience of this place was too gloomy for me . The salads which are only edible items are priced so high that one does not feel like investing so much money to quench the hunger . However a heads up to the decor and the ambience of the place which brings in the quirky modern as well as old traditional  family.    Some details really caught my attention ,the way an earthen pot was kept for fetching water , the way bills were presented and the furnitures were quite attracting . I do understand eating healthy is imperative but some spicy or juciy items would be lovely too . I just had a chicken sandwich as the cakes nor the desserts fancied me . I do wish to  try one or two salads the next time if I went there and shopping becomes a myth as all the items are over rated and unnecessarily priced .

It's located in a quiet locality of Hindustan park off Southern Avenue. They have a handloom store in the front and a small but artistically done cafe at the back. They do not have much food options, it's mostly cafe food and beverages. The decor and ambience is something to come back for. If you want to read a book or work on your laptop then this is an ideal place for you. Prices are a bit exhorbitant.

Location wise it is a bit hard to find. I liked the store very much. The ambience is great. I liked the decor too. A pretty posh place it is.
There is no menu card. The idea seemed to be taken from the roadside stalls yet to make that seem elegant. Worked so far!
Food is nothing compared to the hype. Sandwiches are okayish. There is no consistency with the pasta. One day it is too oily, one day it seems overloaded with cheese, one day it seems its too dry. Three out of four times I wasn't satisfied with the pasta. Also, price is high in respect to the quality of food. Moreover, with limited number of dishes and their unavailability it is quite disappointing.
Even poorer is their service. Orders are needed to be placed by the customers over the counter. A good idea. But, it doesn't work out if one has to ask twice or thrice to get the food.
It is overhyped and a pretty much wasted experience.

This charming cozy spot at the back of the Sienna store is the kind of place you could imagine writing your novel in. With cute mismatched seating and a knick-knack filled decor that looks like it's been accumulated over the years you could easily spend hours year reading on your own or with friends. 

We had a coffee and an eggplant pesto pizza, both of which were fine but it's really the ambience which is the star here. It's expensive but the quaint charm of the place (and the free wifi which meant I could be there for hours) made it worth it for me.

If you are trying to avoid crowded noisy cafes and spend some good time with your partner at a serene and cosy place, then you can definitely give this beautifully decorated cafe a try. Crafted seats and these warm lights will set up your mood.

Coming back to business, don't keep high hopes for the food. They have a very limited menu and a couple of unskilful staff. Food is ordinary, doesn't justify the price.
Their boutique is adjacent to the cafe, thus they devote more time selling these goods.

Order something simple ( go for the baked items) and have a great conversation with your partner.

Visited this place on a Wednesday evening along with my boyfriend expecting few delectable treats for our tastebuds. Blinded by the reviews and pictures on zomato we ordered spicy minced pizza and mint-lime cooler and to our utmost disgust we found out how unappetizing both of them tasted. The cooler gave out taste of some leaf and that pizza was anything but a pizza . Cutting it short , both the dish ordered were a big no from our side.

Mint and lime cooler is the drink to stay away from if you do not want to go on a vomiting spree . 
Also the spicy minced pizza tastes more like a stale bread with mutton curry on top . 
The decor is the only pro which is overshadowed by the terrible food and the drinks . 
In one word DISAPPOINTING .

Sienna cafe located in Hindustan part is an aesthetic cafe which has a boutique at its entrance too. The cafe although being really up the standard is super small. It has a small inner sitting area and another outer sitting area which is pretty narrow too. The place is one of the prettiest places in Kolkata, and has really cool DIY decorations , that's the only reason of its popularity. The food menu is really mediocre. Had the spaghetti and sandwich over there and found it pretty disappointing because of its tiny portion size. Would still ask you to visit this place once. The dishes are pricey.

I had visited this cafe on a Sunday evening. They don't have a menu card and the dishes are written on black boards which are hung on the walls which is a bit of a trouble. You need to place your order at the counter and they'll serve you. It's claustrophobic also because it's a small place and the number of tables is a lot. 

We tried their roasted pepper/mushroom sandwich which was bland and had no flavour. We also tried their tomato gazpacho (which is a cold soup). It was extremely bad and was kind of stale. 

You can shop for exquisite products also.

It was my birthday and I wished to treat my friend at  some new cafe where we both havn't ventured yet...it was my friend who suggested this one and I was all game...

Location wise difficult to find...I walked down the Purna Das Road from Golpark and met my friend infront of the Allergy clinic...we then took the lane adjacent to the clinic as the google map navigated us and finally reached the cafe that fell to our right..

At first I mistook the place to be a fashion boutique until I saw an arrow pointing to a cafe inside@..the boutique was extremely pretty and so was the cafe...completely done with Spanish Mexican decor...elegant and subtle..seating place is too small..we were happy to secure a table for two...

Talking of the food, the options are way too less and one needs to check the menu from the wall where it lies hanging.. We ordered Pesto Cream Fetuccine Pasta with cherry tomato....after asking two to three times for water the attendant gave me a glass of water and again after my friend asked thrice she was provided with such...that was really annoying as they seem to be busy even when only 2 other persons were there at the table next to us...

Anyway finally when our dish came and we started to have it, all our frowns vanished...OMG! Best pasta I ever had...trust me when I say so...I would like to go again and again for such a lipsmacking dish.. it adequately filled both of stomachs and we were literally fumbling to finish it...'WOW' is the word we both uttered...

Pocket pinch was on the higher edge as the decor and food seem to take you miles away from the bustling streets of Kolkata..

The cafe is definitely a hidden gem and I believe could be on every other Kolkatan's lip if the cafe- personnel enlarge the seatings and yes perfect their gesture by not unnecessarily harrassing customers asking for a mere glass of water and that too in Kolkata May Month Afternoon...

Wished to give a 5 but their gesture and the long walk reminded me not to do so..

Certainly Recommended!!

This is a cute little cafe cum store in Golpark. The ambience of this place is lovely with quirky blue doors and decor but it's really small so it's not suitable for big groups. The food there is average. Tried the avacado salad, pesto walnut pizza wedges and sun-dried tomato pasta which were all average. The walnut and date cake and mango cake were nice.   Even though the food is mediocre, I would recommend this place because of it's ambience.

This is the first time I am actually facing a hard time describing a place, so I will start with the food that we tried there:
1. Chocolate Milk Shake - 3.5⭐️
2. Banana/Date Milk Shake - 3.5⭐️
3. Fried Chicken with Fruits Salad (Cucumber & Tomato) - 3.5⭐️

The cafe is exquisitely decorated, with an "out-of-Kolkata" ambiance. You should not expect a quick service here, as this is more for the chilled out and laid back crowd. Also, there is this vibe of sophistication in how the place is setup & managed. Loved the retro Jazz songs being played in the PA System.

A 4⭐️ for the overall experience we had. The menu here is no way close to what they have to offer, just read their walls inside the store for the real time menu.

This is a beautiful little cafe at a quite corner of South Calcutta. The interior and the decor is beautiful. Very aesthetic. It's a therapeutic experience, being here with your friends and loved ones. The spice hot chocolate is to absolutely die for. Sienna Cafe does take a healthy bite out of your pocket but it's quite worth it.

Amazing place and the avocado salad lived up to the expectation. We also ordered baked sweet potato which was good but a bit dry. Guess you cannot experiment much with that vegetable. The mint cooler was great but ice mocha was a let down when compared to other dishes.

The place had a serene ambience. Hidden in one of the alleys, one definitely needs to visit the cafe.

Wow wat a place. It's been around for 2 years but between my projects never knew it even existed until a few days back saw the name appear somewhere checked out on Zomato n voila ..
From then I've been frequenting this place as I love the food, ambience, music and the overall positive vibe the place has. 
I just simply love the place and cud keep writing all night, but just to keep it short:

Food: 3.5/5 some hit some miss. Reasonably priced. Small menu but great dishes that stand out, like the corn-avocado salad, ham n cheese sandwich, cream cheese walnut crostini. Eggplant pizza and fries were sad. 
Desserts to try Madeline n financiers. Not the best, eggy but love them anyways.
Coffee is amazing try an affogato. I love there cappuccino. "A good cappuccino, never needs sugar" 
Ambience: 5/5 amazing and makes me come back here again n again. Very beautiful chilled out atmosphere, thoughtful interiors, reminds me of Greece. I love there bar counter, chalkboard menus, ceramic table tops, and on n on. It's like an oasis in south Kolkata. Kudos to the owners u make Kolkata proud👍🏻
Service : Waiting times for food is long but I don't mind as I like chilling there.  This place is not about the service but can be better specially on busy days.
Overall great cafe and a definite visit when in Kolkata. Highly recommended. 
Best of luck guys n keep it up👍🏻

A little too overpriced for the food but fairy tale place to visit at night. The sitting arrangement is also a little on the less side so it gets crowdy fast.

A cafe with some really good ambience, beautiful lights and fancy presentation. But standing midway the passage to check the menu put on different boards was a bit inconvenient and the staff though sweet but didn't really seem professional in catering the customers. As for the food the iced mocha and chocolate cake with icecream that we ordered was good but the smoked bacon sandwich was not at all worth the money.

It's been a long while before I could tick off this place from wishlist. I think I discovered this pretty and soothing place quite late. Such intricate and beautiful interior, and finger licking food (Pesto Pasta and Pesto Grilled Sandwich) deserves an 11 on 10.
Inspite of the compact place, it's well managed with adequate staff.
There's also this exhibition of junk and quirky collection as you enter the place.

Cheers to the management! 🍻

A must order is their stuffed capsicum and the chocolate fondue. Just the best place to hangout with friends and eat delicious food.

Sienna is undoubtedly the prettiest thing in Kolkata right now. I visited with my friends yesterday, it was absolutely spectacular. The store has some very nice products but they are exorbitant, we headed directly to the cafe which has an indoor seating and an outdoor one. The place is unbelievably beautiful decided in Fairy Lights which makes it look right out of a Fairy land. The menu is quite interesting. We ordered 2 pots of fries, they were well fries but it's fun with friends. Then we ordered the Smoked Aubergine Whole wheat pizza wedges. Tasted good but pretty low on quantity. The service was good. Give a try for the decor, it's worth falling in love with.

The prettiest little place, this one! A boutique coupled with a cafe, everything about this place is artsy. Decorated beautifully, the place can seat around 7-8 groups at a time. It also has a one seater which I loved! The only problem is that it can feel cramped, and the seats are mostly small, and meant for young people to squeeze in. 
The food spread, though impressive on the menu, is not so impressive on the plate. They serve it in really pretty plates, but taste wise, it is ordinary. We ordered coffee, black tea, a dates and banana milkshake and an eggs and olive sandwich. The sandwich was pretty small for the price. The coffee was just okay as was the milkshake. The service is a little shaky, seemed to me that the waiters were not very well versed with the menu. I kept asking what non veg pasta was available, and they just couldn't tell me! Finally, I dropped the idea and just had a sandwich instead. Due to the space issue, ordering too much food becomes a problem as you just cannot fit it on the table! It is heavy on the pocket, looking at the quantity of the good served. Also the menu is scattered across 3-4 blackboards, so you have to keep moving around, peer over the heads of other guests to decide what you want to have. They should really rework on the logistics in this case.
Overall, I loved the boutique more than the cafe! But you can visit once just to see how pretty this place is!

Oh, the ideal place for an idyllic afternoon, spent by oneself or with friends. The quaint cafe on Hindustan Road lays out a fare that makes my mouth water in hindsight, a definite fave? The Bok Choi and Shrimp soup and a dose of their home made French Fries served with a hot dip straight out of heaven (for the millionth time, please bottle it!!)
One wish it was a more spacious since it gets hard to get a seat at times and over crowding makes it a tad suffocating. 
However, will DEFINITELY go back!

To begin with, it's a small pretty place. Well lit and creatively set up. But the major drawback is how cramped it is. I don't understand why a tiny little place needs to be stuffed with double the number of table and stools and what not! There's no breathing space and most of the decor goes to waste because the area, since already small, seems stuffy when completely full. The tables are so closely placed that you're probably not even two feet away from the next table.
The sitting area outside suffers mainly from this seating arrangement.

The food. Basically, the menu. What's on Zomato is certainly not there in the cafe. We thought it to be a pretty reasonable place, but the menu on the cafe's wall tells a different story. And the difference in the prices mentioned is quite stark. For instance, the menu on Zomato says that fries cost Rs.55 whereas the one in the cafe reads Rs.115 ! Needn't explain any further.

Having said that, the fries were really good and crunchy. We had iced cappuccino which was good. I would've liked to try a lot of things but honestly, the place was packed to the brim and we just wanted to leave.

It isn't a total thumbs down but not a full thumbs up either. Please update your latest menu on Zomato and do something about the space. It is not small, but overwhelmingly crowded due to the arrangements.Anuja Sinha Chowdhury

Been to this cafe after a lot of recommendations from family and friends, heard of its celebrity fame. Quite happy to have been to the place. Commendable decor, perfect combination of colorful walls coupled with ample departure, beautiful lighting and cute small furniture. The store houses a variety of stuff which are claimed to be handmade , quite tastefully done. Coming to food we ordered hot chocolate, iced americano, cappuccino, almond madeline cake and a baked fish. Hot chocolate was heavenly with authentic molten chocolate, rich and tasty! America was okayish and cappuccino ticks the standards too. The baked fish was quite different - layer of spinach and green peas, topped with a thin layer of fish and then mashed potatoes covered with bread crumbs, baked in oven and served with 4 pieces of toasted bread. I wont say the taste wasnt good, however, there was more of spinach, peas and potatoes that fish and the quantity wasnt generous for a price of 500 plus. Overall a good experience - I would give it a 5.0 for the decor and the look, and a 3.5 for the food, which kind of normalizes this to a 4.0. Good for a one time experience.

It is a very picturesque place to be at, let alone eat at. Sienna store and café is right opposite Byloom and is tucked away in one of the lanes running alongside the bustling Gariahat. Hindustan Park, to be precise. The decor is beautiful. It is peopled with a lot of beautiful objects but none make it look clustered. The hot chocolate is to die for and their coffee is very fresh.

Ordered Hot Chocolate, Lemon Mint Cooler, Spicy Chocolate Pastry & Mango Pastry. 
Way too pricey!
The menu that they have put on Zomato is absolutely fake just to show it a cheap café. 
Not worth the money. 
On top of that they didn't put up the entire menu on Zomato. 
And cost of two '500' is a joke. 
And the service was poor as the pricing of the menu.
Had to wait for 25 minutes for the food and well as the bill to arrive. 
Terrible experience.

The cafe has not provided the entire menu on Zomato and the 'cost for two' has been wrongly calculated. 
The service was very poor and we had to wait for a long time to get the order. 
They should add the entire menu for transparency of the cafe's offering. 
I was not happy with my visit to Sienna cafe.

It is so creative and relaxing its ambiance and its creativities can change anyone`s mood with its rock n roll music which is played there
Its a prefect package of hanging out and having good food..
If I come to the food then I got nothing to say cause its amazingly delicious...two dish which touched my heart was their pasta with red sauce and the salt caramel milk shake....

This place is done up perfectly so as to compare to the small and quaint cafes in bandra (bombay) or bangalore. It's got charm and a distinct warmth about it. It does therefore, run well and is hugely popular among both the artsy 😋 and the family kinda crowds. They are, however, quite understaffed/ untrained to the extent that even the quality of food served becomes inconsistent. They have a small enough vegetarian menu but either the order placed is forgotten about or that particular item (especially on weekend evenings) finishes before your order is communicated to the kitchen staff. The staff does its best to keep up but despite best intentions, isn't able to. Overall I love the place and particularly bec South Calcutta doesn't have so many options where you can work out of to get a change of scene. I'd still recommend this place but I'd say that you go there with a lot of patience and/or time at hand.

Situated in a relatively wide by lane of Hindustan Park, this cafe is a designer's haven. It is firstly located right beside an art installation of colourful hanging kettles (The Art Rickshaw), and the glass doors open into the Sienna Store, selling handicraft shawls and clay cutlery and jute rugs. You cross this right into the cafe, done in the boho chic style, with chalk on blackboard menus, brick walls with mosaic decor and photo frames, hanging rice lights and papier mache lamps. The inside seating area is rather small, but the outdoor seating (enclosed, so it is still air conditioned), with translucent glass walls, potted hanging plants, mosaic tables and cushioned chairs gives off a cosy adda place kind of feel.

Menu is quite varied, and completely cafe continental. Tried the Iced Mocha and the day's special Banana and Date Milkshake. Served in large mason jars, they were both worth it. Especially my iced mocha was low on sugar, exactly as I prefer it.

I had the Egg, Olives and Sundried Tomato Sandwich with Hummus and Potato Wafers. It was a semi open sandwich with multigrain loaf, lightly toasted and quite delicious. Husband ordered Mango and Almonds Salad - clay plate full of sweet succulent mangoes, topped with almond and honey sauce. We did not try dessert for the day, but the varities of cupcakes and muffins and cake slices on the glass counter were very very welcoming. Hard to resist gourmet sin!

A boutique cafe. Recommended, but not if you're in a mood for loud and boisterous merrymaking. More like when you want a nice designer afternoon or evening out.

Another hidden gem to explore.Located in one of the lanes in gariahat, this place is just AMAZING....in the midst of hustle bustle kolkata,this place will definitely transport you to Goa.From interiors to ambiance to food..everything is extremely good.They even have a backyard garden​ with AC facilities... now that is cool!!😍😍
One negative thing is that the limited number of seats they offer...for better management they should definitely do something regarding the sitting arrangements to cope up with the rush.

Comming to the food we ordered.
1.Pesto Fettuccine-Though the price is way high for a pasta...but you will simply fall in love with the dish.Exact amount of creaminess,mushrooms and pesto is just mouthwatering..so that extra bucks can be considered keeping the taste in mind.
2.Almond financier with cream and fruits.-Healthy dish..the hot almond financier with the cold ice cream will definitely beat the heat.

So anyone wanting to spend time with friends for hours and not with too much pinch in pocket...this is just for you.

Haven't been this disappointed with a place in a long time! Inconsistent, horrible service and uncomfortable seating. Almost felt that the previous high ratings were paid for!!!

3 iced capacinnos ordered together- two were served 10min after the first and tasted completely different; and horrible. 

2 of 3 sandwiches ordered together were served 15min and 20min after ordering. 3rd one, they "forgot". Plus, don't understand not giving cutlery OR napkins with the food- if you give me a fork and knife, i might not need napkins... But if I'm eating by hand, I need a napkin. And got ONE napkin each time we asked for them (we were 7 on the table). 

Mango smoothie was less smoothie and more mango shake. Plus was served warm - "we wanted to keep it thick!"

Ambiance was interesting, but that's not what i came here for. 

Don't even feel like commenting on the food.

This is my 3rd time in the cafe n this time I was utterly disappointed. ....the service was extremely slow, the staff were very inefficient.....had to literally fight to place the order........the staff didn't even bother to listen or give proper response to our queries.....they were not sure when they can get us our orders n every time we went to check they said "only 5 mins ma'am" and they kept us waiting endlessly. Also they refused to cancel the order when we were tired waiting. Then when the food was served the quality was horrible. The chicken was not good n I felt what we they served did not live up to the level of the quality for which it was charged so much.

I don't know if it was lack of availability of fresh products or incompetent staff or may be low number of staff but whatever it is, the quality of the cafe has detoriated a lot. Very unhappy with it.

A perfect place to spend a silent and slow evening with your friends! The ambience is simply fabulous with the decor tastefully done. It reflects the aesthetic sense of an art connoisseur. The wraps, burgers and sandwiches have been a given a twist. The way you are presented with the delicacies in exquisite cutlery resembles the practices of a colonial household. Coffee is too good.

The moment you get seated you get transported out of kolkata , Pondicherry or goa. Interiors and music is very different. It's a place where one can sit and spend 2-3 hours. 

Food is excellent. We ordered avocado Tortila salad, aglioglio , aubergine pizza and mushroom sandwich. All of which was excellent. One only downside was they didn't have Tabasco sauce. 

Quantity is generous.

Hindustan Park Area in Kolkata has become quite a hub for some really interesting little Cafes.. Some boutiques in this area have also added cozy little Cafes, in an effort to further enhance customer experience.. "SIENNA" is one such wonderful place.. Had the Ham n Cheese Sandwich.. was really tempted to try the Mango Crumble Cake and the Ginger Walnut Crumble that were lying on the counter, but left it for next time.. One disappointment was that I had been here a few months ago, and tried the Fried Prawn with Papaya Salad, and Egg Plant with Humus Dip.. unfortunately, for some reason, these have been removed from the Menu. Hope they are brought back, as, they were very good.

Nice. Cozy. Comfortable. The concept of this cafe is very nice with a small attractive store & few good reads. Feels great to see such new places coming up in Kolkata. Its a perfect place for the "evening adda"! Options for food/drink is very limited, however their marshmallow dipped chocolate fondue is a must try!

Hindustan Park Area in Kolkata has become quite a hub for some really interesting little Cafes.. Some boutiques in this area have also added cozy little Cafes, in an effort to further enhance customer experience.. "SIENNA" is one such wonderful place.. Had the Ham n Cheese Sandwich.. was really tempted to try the Mango Crumble Cake and the Ginger Walnut Crumble that were lying on the counter, but left it for next time.. One disappointment was that I had been here a few months ago, and tried the Fried Prawn with Papaya Salad, and Egg Plant with Humus Dip.. unfortunately, for some reason, these have been removed from the Menu. Hope they are brought back, as, they were very good.

Nice. Cozy. Comfortable. The concept of this cafe is very nice with a small attractive store & few good reads. Feels great to see such new places coming up in Kolkata. Its a perfect place for the "evening adda"! Options for food/drink is very limited, however their marshmallow dipped chocolate fondue is a must try!

Beautiful.
Everything about this café is extraordinary. Located in the heart of South Kolkata, Sienna Café gives off vibes which no one can refuse to embrace. The food is 5/5, the service is 5/5 and the ambience is probably 100/5. Although it is a little expensive, the menu's variety makes up for it. The staff here is wonderful and they truly know the ways of dining and hospitality. Also, do take a look at the wonderful stuff they sell in their store!

Sienna Cafe is a beautifully set place nestled in a sleepy lane of Kolkata,the frontage is decored with bright kitsch articles and as you enter,you find a store with some cool exclusive stuff.
Then at the back you are greeted with something that looks like a backyard garden cafe with everyday fresh menu.
The food arrives fairly quickly and your expextarions sky rocket cuz it looks beautiful.
Here's what we had:

-Avocado Tortilla Salad : Fresh as the day and sits beautifully on a colorful platter. It has crunchiness and creaminess and almost a proper meal. Maybe a fruit could add to it. Chopped up mangoes would go very well

-Cream Cheese Walnut Crostini : the creamcheese seemed very organic,slightly ok the sweeter side and the crostini was more like a walnut and date cake. But somehow it did work on the taste. Good but not extra-ordinary

-Pesto Fettucine : excellent excellent dish. Correct amount of creaminess and mushrooms thrown in.

-Lemon Bars : I am a lemon dessert fan and this was brilliant as it wasnt too sweet or tangy. Everything was on spot

-Strawberry Crumble : just before the gates of heaven.

You should definitely go for a lazy afternoon for some good food and conversations or for some solo time as well.

This place is a must visit! Kooky interiors, Mediterranean themed furnishing and excellent food. Seating is restricted but that makes it perfect for a cosy setting of two-three people. We ordered a lot of food, of which I loved the roast chicken with sweet potatoes and the smoked aubergine pizza wedges. The caramel cappuccino cold coffee is a bottle of heaven, cold, sweet with a bite of saltiness. The chocolate financiers are a yum nibble while you wait for your food!

Nice Place! Nice Ambience! However, the space is little bit crippled. Seats could have been arranged I n a more spacious way. Coming to the menu it's innovative and attractive. The pies, cakes and tart looked delicious. I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nice adda session in the evening with your friends. However, again iterating the space issue which if solved will make it great !!!

Sienna is a beautiful and well decorated cafe located just opposite to Byloom in Hindusthan Park. A tiny sophisticated place for a great hangout with family and friends. Visited today with a friend since it was a long wish and was quiet happy with the service and food but the prices are little high.

A small beautiful cafe tucked away in Hindustan Park. This is in my opinion one of the most beautiful cafe in Kolkata. Much like it's competitor across the street this is a store with a cafe behind it. The service is good and the staff behavior is extremely courteous. 

We had ordered spicy hot chocolate,  smoked aubergine parsley and Walnut pesto with whole wheat wedges,  cream cheese and Walnut Cristina and some pesto cream pasta. The food is average. The pasta lacked seasoning and the walnut pesto lacked flavor. The only special thing was the spicy hot chocolate which was packed with the heat from the chillies which went perfectly with the silky smooth hot chocolate. Overall a small but very decorated place without a smoking zone which serves decent food. Pocket pinch is a little on the higher side.

I have been meaning to go here and so decided to drop by with a few friends one fine day. From the moment you lay eyes on the property you are struck by how beautifully it is done up. Very artistic! I guess it has to do with the fact that it's a boutique with a cafe. The crockery and the tables were all artsy and different than any other cafe. After taking in the amazing ambience to our fill we decided to order these:
*Celery Cucumber Juice- It's freshly made and you will feel that from the first sip itself. Tasted a little bland according to me.
*Aubergine and pesto cream on whole wheat wedges- This was surprisingly good,inspite of it having aubergine which I seriously dislike. The texture was very creamy.
*Pesto tomato mozarella sandwich- This was served with chips and was very good. Much better than any average veggie sandwich anywhere. Full marks for this dish.
*Walnut and almond cake- Big piece with lots of nuts on it. Tasty but maybe a little too sweet. You gotta eat this slowly to enjoy it.
*Strawberry Crumble cake- Loved every bite of it! The tangyness of the strawberries cut through the sweetness of the cake beautifully. I can go back again and again for this cake alone.
We had a good experience in this quaint but interesting little cafe. The only dampener of the day was the totally inefficient service of the staff. Most of them were newbies and didn't know the menu or prices well and how to go about their job. I hope the management looks after this issue. Apart from this hiccup,I can safely recommend this to my friends. Great place to go on a date even though it's a little pricey.

Sienna reminds me of the little cafes you have on the mountain side, where you can while away your time with a cup of coffee and a book in hand, or work on your laptop, without anyone bothering you. Located in one of the by lanes of Hindustan Park, bang opposite Byloom, Sienna basically celebrates art. They have different goodies -clothes, accessories, bags, decorative items and what not! All indigenous stuff that are sure to woo you. And when you're tired of looking around the food and handicrafts, you can take a bite at the cafe inside.

The decor of Sienna is hands down, the BEST I have seen in a long while. And the high rating of this cafe is primarily due to the decor and the ambiance. The way they have utilised the space is worth appreciating. The theme is blue and you can find tiny drums turned into chairs, beautiful blue tables, hanging lights, little pictures scattered on the wall, a glass window, and a chair at the corner with a lamp to help you finally finish that unfinished book in comfort, or just pick up a book from the stacks. The menu is hand written and hangs on one of the walls, while the counter offers a sneak peak into the beverages available and the desserts on offer. The place is surprisingly‌ almost always full, and a good number of foreigners are regulars at the place. 

The café is one of the newly growing health cafes and so you get a good number of detoxicating drinks, but being always the rule breaker, I love their hot chocolate the most. Served in a little blue cup, it's pure and thick and warm. I go back to the place again and again just for a cup of this. Although for a 100 bucks, I would have wanted them to serve a little more of it.

Well, unfortunately, the good bit ends there. Coming to the food, I have tried their Pasta, Sandwich and Fried Chicken. The taste is average, and forgettable. But what makes me give them a low rating is their service. The number of attendants are too less compared to the people waiting to be served. They take abnormally long hours to take your order, and then to serve it. I had placed the order for dessert, and they informed that they will require at least 20 minutes for it. I had time, but not so much that even after 40 minutes, I had to hear that they didn't even take the order. Well, a little more patience and even after 10 minutes after this, they had not even started preparing it. Speaks of how negligent the staff is, and add to it, their attitude is unapologetic.

I love the place for its ambiance and a strange serenity, but if you're hungry and looking for good food, this is not the place you would want to go to.

A hidden gem in the bylane of Gariahat. Reminds you of the quaint little cafes found in Pondicherry. Amazing decor. Exquisite ambience. Best part is they have an outdoor seating arrangement that is air-conditioned. Loved their bite size muffins. The coffee was brewed exactly to my liking. Would definitely be visiting again and would SURELY recommend it to everyone. Good job folks!!!

Small little cosy joint in hindustan park , the deco is very good and they have store in the front . The seating is not much , so getting a place on weekends is very difficult . 

The food was good and ambience gave feel of being in Pondicherry cafes.

We ordered the avacado tortila salad which was yum and a must try and ordered the alio olio  pasta which was good too.

For the drinks tried the green ice tea which was ok .

 Definitely going  back again for the other things on the menu.

This Cafe is located in hindustan park,not far from rashbehari avenue,we had read a few reviews and found this place to be quite interesting so we decided to give it a visit and we were not let down.The ambience is really nice and the decor is also quite different it just gives a different feel and creates a cosy atmosphere.Coming to the food we tried the avocado tortilla salad which was made up of really fresh stuff and you could tell by the taste of it that it was healthy,then we tried the aubergine on whole wheat pizza wedges which was also great and was served beautifully,the beverages were also really good we took the spicy hot chocolate which has now become my favourite thing ans the strawberry smoothie which was really thick and made up of strawberrys,(no artifical flavouring) for dessert we took the affogato which was a scoop of vanilla ice cream dipped in a coffee shot,and I'll have to say the coffee was super strong.We also ordered the ICED Mocha which was also quite good and smooth to taste and if you are interested in buying some stuff they do sell some good decorative items and clothing.

Rightfully listed as a hidden gem. The ambience is super cozy, the furniture is unique and quirky. I’m guessing this is the creative person’s ideal café to brainstorm at, with themselves or others. Fortunately, the interesting vibe carried through to the food. We had the spicy pumpkin soup (glorious), cream cheese crostini (distinctly European and sinful), hot chocolate (not for the weak hearted, the shot is enough to get you addicted), pink pasta (corny sounding but delicious) and aglio oglio (paled in comparison with the other dishes, begged for some spices and accompaniments). The service is slightly kooky; this is not a place for someone looking to gobble and dash. Overall, much recommended.

Let’s call it a Food stop! Amidst the beautiful by-lanes of Kolkata’s most food craving location, is a set up which is surely not a conventional one. “We bake our own bread. Our peanut butter is made at home too. The vegetables are sourced from the farm Organic Mandi. We will change the menu seasonally so that the vegetables are fresh all the time”, promises the owner. A store of handmade ceramics and hand loom textiles originating from Confetti, a ceramic workshop near Shantiniketan, accompanies the 800 sq ft space. What a fabulous concoction!

Sienna Cafe is a beautiful, instagram worthy , aquamarine dreamy place which is actually a store leading to a cafe.
I'm in love with this place and have been here a bundle of times. I've tried out the following things-

1. Watermelon cooler is freshly pressed fruit pulp in a jar, definitely going to rejuvenate your soul.

2. The Cold Coffee here is really good and so is the Hot chocolate here.  Do try out their coffee they are really worth your second timer on the same day.  We had ordered for a Machiatto. 

3.Asian Salad with Shrimp is a delicious treat. It is tossed with lettuce leaves, wai wai and shrimps. It's your choice if you want to add shrimps to it or not. 

4.Pesto Tomato Mozzarella Sandwich. We found this a bit on the bitter side maybe because they use all fresh greens and make it freshly for you. But if you love mozzarella do opt for this. 

5. Loved the  Minced meat pizza. It came up to me as a surprise. Basically it was spicy mutton keema topped with parsley on triangular bread bases. Definitely a must try.

This cozy one was in our list for long...untill..we accomplished our mission and trust me..we came out with a peaceful mind and happy-happy stomach. First of all, the awestruck decor along with a harmonious ambiance will get high marks...and..the food (as we were on a hurry, we just ordered one food and a drink) was yummy to the core. Going by the popularity, the cheese and ham grilled sandwich was really really good accompanied by the cool senses of a cafe mocha complimenting the combo to its fullest. I think, we will pay a second visit soon!! :)..:)

Had heard so much about this place and was very keen to visit it. However, was so disappointed with the food and service. I'm not a fussy eater but we were so disappointed with the appetiser that we left to eat the main course elsewhere. We ordered the fried chicken and salad, one cappuccino and one green tea. The cappuccino machine was right beside us but it took them 25 mins to serve us. There were only groups of people beside us (my friend and me) so it shouldn't have taken that long to serve. Then the fried chicken took an hour to reach our table. Each time we asked the server, he said it's getting ready. The chicken pieces were raw and red inside. We told the server who in turn called the cook. The cook said the pieces were from the thigh of the chicken and that they will also be red!! We told him that we were uncomfortable with that and asked if he could put it in the over for a bit to cook it some more. He refused saying we didn't know what thigh pieces look and taste like. The salad was not a salad but crudely chopped pieces of cucumber and tomato with no seasoning, whatsoever. We were so disappointed with the service that we left for the main course elsewhere. Unfortunate for us, as we LOVED the decor inside.

Had heard about this place from almost everyone. It was all over my instagram feed.So I was quite curious as to what is the reason for its huge popularity.
So I visited them last week and was quite enthralled to see the place.This place is an artists dream come true. Its really tastefully done up and is beautiful. The tiled tables,warm rice lights all around and the choice of cutlery really give a modern yet laidback feel to this place.
I had the masala tea and Pasta with Sundried tomatoes here .
Masala Tea -
It was the perfect Indian tea. It had a strong flavour of the liquor and had a good consistency.

Pasta -
It was spaghetti pasta with sundried tomatoes,olive oil,salt and black pepper. It had a very good balance of all these flavours.We could call it one of the more authentic tomato pastas in town.Also,you have a choice of regular/whole wheat pasta here. Sienna has some really great options for the health conscious !

Sienna is a delight for artists and foodies alike.

Quaint cosy place tucked in hindustan park , a handicrafts store featuring some exclusive pottery and textile leads to this gem of a place , amazingly decorated with recycled products , the slice of coutyard with a transparent roof and golden balls hanging from the ceiling gives a very earthy look to this cafe. The decor mesmerized us the most and hence a higher rating.
The food maintains quality owing the international crowd the place usually welcomes , and priced tad high. I had a HOT CHOCOLATE, nice one but had a thinner consistency than preferred. A jar of ORANGE JUICE ,a healthy choice for my friend. The food comprised a PESTO FETTUCCINE and CRISPY CHICKEN , both liked and upto the mark. The dessert , a slice of STRAWBERRY CRUMBLE served with cream was droolworthy itself at the first sight , and tasted perfect to end our meal on the sweetest note.
Highly recommend visiting sienna cafe.

I'm a regular at this place. The ambience, decor and the vibe is very unique...rather positive.
The French fries are to die for. The serving style is also in a big mug. And the taste cant be explained...crisp and addictive. Served with a spicy sauce. Tomato ketchup also available.  The coffees and shakes are also good. One can try the fried chicken with salad. Portion is good so is the taste. Only hitch, the french fries take tooooo long to be prepared. There are always a lot of orders for it. I have always waited for 45mins for it. Requesting the management to look into it.

It's nice and cosy with good music in the background. Ambience is top notch. Went to have coffee and was very happy with Cafe Mocha. You actually don't have to add the sugar. It tastes beautiful as it is. They serve a little biscotti with it 😊. The eggless caramel cake was soft and yum. And with summer coming,always have the lebu jal..its refreshing. I would recommend it to everyone. Would like to visit again. 😃

The food is pretty good too. I was impressed by the variety of salads. A special mention of the fresh celery cucumber juice.. It was mind blowing. The staff is very courteous and accommodating.

Sienna Cafè is located in a bylane in Hindustan Park- opposite Byloom. 

It has a rustic decor which compliments as well as enhances the beautiful ambience. It's always pretty much crowded because it is THAT good! 

Coming to the food- we ordered cafè mocha, macchiato, capsicum stuffed with minced meat and the BEST Chocolate fondue.
For vegetarians, do order the avocado and tortilla salad. 
The hot chocolate is my new favourite on their menu. 

This place has a special charm to it that would want you to come back to it often. 
Would absolutely recommend this place to everyone!

Barring the food which was obviously good, i only kept on gazing through the lights, the idyllic bricks & the worn out green wooden doors. I could just take a cup of coffee & sit there all day long..i could get spell bounded thinking of what's right and what went wrong..i could think of the long awaited rain, the city deserves after a dry winter..the warmth of the fire derived from the tinder..there is peace, there is endearment smitten with the afoot of happiness and my long lost recess..

The items found here are very unique and creative. Ambiance of this cafe is simply crazy so as the decor. We had ordered their creamy pesto pasta and hot chocolate in a pot (fondue). Both of them tasted great. Visit this cafe soon if you haven't yet and I bet you'll not regret your decision. Prices are on the higher side though. Looking forward to visit this cafe again.

The service could be a bit better, otherwise it's a nice place to catch up with friends.

The palate wants more, and the tastebuds demand a stopover too soon with friends in tow. 
The Spicy Mint Pizza with minced meat topping and the Roasted Chicken with date were yummylicious. The Strawberry Crumble had the pure home made cake flavour with a twist. What followed was the irresistible and never a miss, Lebu Jol.
Its all about serving with care in a surrounding where simplicity embraces innovation.
Sienna Cafe is full of surprises. Surprises that you look forward to.

It’s that time of the year again when the roses are a bit more red, fragrances smell a bit more sweet and everyone longs for that special someone. Yes Valentines Day is here (whether you celebrate it on the 14th or on Saraswati Pujo or any other day of your choice). And since it’s here, we would love to tell you about Cafe Sienna. It is perhaps the prettiest cafe we have seen in Kolkata and is the perfect place for a date or to simply hang out with friends. The tables are tiled with pretty blue ceramics. Potted plants and comfortable seating. There is the option of both indoor and outdoor seating (we prefer the outdoors). And the place becomes simply adorable when the lights come on and you look up.

A beautiful cafe store located in Hindustan Park, second lane. Was awestruck by the amazing interiors tastefully done. The place is divided between a store and a petite cafe. With inside and outside seating. Every corner is beautiful and makes you want to over stay a little.
Ordered for the cafe mocha which was made very well.it was served with a tiny home baked muffin and was very tasty. 
The cold coffee was nice too. Couldn't try the food, though the menu ( though small) looked tempting.
The place is stunning and you must visit it to know more.

Tucked inside one of the by-lanes in the Hindustan Park area (just opposite Byloom, Gariahat), Sienna is an eclectic mix of quaint and quirk. And guess what it serves pretty awesome food as well. Reason enough to fall in love right? Yes that is the exact reason why it was a love at first sight kind of a thing between us :-)

This is one of the prettiest cafes in town right now. The evening scenes are much better. The dim lights creates an amazing scenario. Quite ideal for those romantic dates. 
But the food was a let down. The options are quite less. And since we were having veg for that day, the less options became even more limited. 
Ive never had a worse Iced tea than this. Cappuccino was decent, even though I'll chose others over this. 
We also had Madeleine with fruits and ice cream. There aren't any ways ice cream can go wrong. So this again was ordinary.. the quantity being real less worth the buck. 
The prices weren't that pocket friendly compared to the food they serve. We received a bill of Rs. 290
I plan of further visits to actually form a proper opinion of the place.

Really simple but nice food and the place is adorable unfortunately my experience there wasn't the best... but it may have just been an off day for them so don't go totally by my 3 point rating....

The order for the evening was a chicken sandwich, fish pie and an aubergine pizza and for drinks we got an affagato, chili hot chocolate and a black tea. The food was good; simple yet flavourfull. But I felt like the aubergine on the pizza was a little to cold to enjoy... I was mentioned to be aubergine and pesto but the fact that it was cold meant it wasn't fresh made... none of those ingredient lyrics really need to be served cold. So that must mean some of the stuff was refrigerated. Also it seemed a bit too garlicky for my taste.
The chicken sandwich was not bad either. The fish pot pie....well it started off well...it had a nice cauliflower puree (it think) crust which was good and then we found a hair baked into the pie.... YIKES!!! Thank God that was our last dish to come coz that definitely killed our appetite. Also when I went to complain about the hair I managed to peep into the kitchen I could totally understand how the hair got into the food... the people preparing the food don't use any gloves or hair knitts...

Well moving on to more pleasant things.... the hot chocolate was the best iv ever had! It was the saving grace and the chocolate and the decor are the only reason I'm rating this place even a 3!

The affagato was not bad...for anyone wondering what an affagato is, it's a shot of espresso with a scoop of amul vanilla ice cream in it and AN almond. This "concoction" took 20 mins and 2 checks with the waiter and one visit to the desk to get. The place wasn't even really that full to warrent taking so long to make. And while on the topic of time it wasn't much fun that they brought each dish one by one with a good 10 to 15 mins gap in between them. It was ok for us since we shared all the food but for people getting their individual dishes it would be such a bore since your friend would probably finish their meal before you even get yours.

Besides all this I would go back to enjoy a hopefully non hairy hot chocolate and the prettiness if the place; but for food I'd probably give it a miss....

But in all honesty if they just improved their service speed a little bit and got their cooks a hair knitts this place could easily be something around a "4 rating"

I had the displeasure of visiting this cafe back in September. Upon hearing quite positive reviews from my daughter's friend I had taken it upon myself to come here. 
The décor had a positive vibe which was overall likeable. But that is where the good stops. 
We had ordered a latte, a cup of Darjeeling tea, a muffin and an appetiser whose description said "mini pizza". 
But none of the orders were delivered to our table in time. The tea and coffee took half an hour, the muffin an additional ten minutes and the appetiser nowhere to be seen. We had to keep enquiring about our order progress every ten minutes but either our calls were ignored or stalled with a simple phrase "five more minutes"
We were sat at a table right opposite to the open bar counter like area where beverages were being made and orders being taken. And the muffin was on a display at a counter top in the same place yet it took 40 minutes to arrive. 
Unable to wait any further we asked for the bill (after an hour of waiting) and immediately one of the server's came over and asked us to wait for another 15 minutes as the dough for the pizza was being made and our order will be out soon. 
Unable to wait I had paid the bill, even for the appetiser which was refunded to us immediately.  
Our appetiser never saw the light of the day. 
Other customers were being served left and right before us, even the ones who had arrived after us. 
Overall a terrible experience. I would not recommend this cafe to anybody. The food, whatever little we got was not worth the wait.
However if you have a lot of time to kill and sit with a cold beverage and forget the food aspect, spend some time with friends this is the place for you.

An intelligently lit cafe, beautifully decorated with vintage frames, photographs, mosaic tiles, tea pots and so on. It's a visual treat. The seating arrangements are to the point. Empty paint tins converted into pouffe, teapot ceiling lights, cane baskets with fairy lights. It feels like I am sitting in those one of a kind cafes in hill stations. They even have corners with one seater for people to work or read on their own. 
The coffee there is mediocre but the fries are spice and yummy. Their muffins and cookies are equally tasty.

BEAUTIFUL setup. Totally in love - more with the ambience.
Not much variety in food, but if you're health conscious, you could hit Sienna Cafe pretty much every alternative day. Innovative food. Tasty too. They let you watch what you eat yet enjoy every bite of it!
5/5 - ambience 
3.5/5 - food
Perfect for a quick meet up with a friend. Or for a post shopping coffee break.

Cozy yet beautiful, that is what comes to my mind whenever I think about the decor and interior of Sienna Store and Cafe with moderately okay food and service. A friend recently wanted to visit the place I ended going there with three friends (one of them is my husband). Our order was for Iced Mocha, Iced Coffee, and Hot chocolate along with Fired chicken and a side of Cucumber and Tomato Salad and Chicken Cheese Sandwiches. 

The Hot Chocolate was thick and chocolaty but I found both the iced coffee and iced Mocha on the watery side. Chicken fries were good but no dip was served and naturally was on the flat side. However, we ended on asking for some spicy dip to match with the Chicken fries and Salad. Sandwich, in fact, was the best item served that day with the perfect balance of Chicken and Cheese.  We found the service a bit on the slower side but all in all, it was a nice visit.

An absolutely shambolic experience. The ambience is unique compared to other cafes but it ends right there. The menu is quite small and there isn't many items to choose from. On top of that, out of 12 items 3-4 items are always unavailable. Topping that off, this cafe is really snobbish in the sense that you will mostly find foreigners visiting this place & Indians are mostly neglected. We were told that an item is unavailable when we went to order it, the same item which was served in on the very next table of ours after 10-15 minutes where there were foreigners. The difference in time required to serve a table full of generic Indians and tourists is astronomical. The management should be ashamed of themselves if this is their concept of a cafe. Other reviewers have also stated this & it's a sad reality. Will never visit this place again.

What a joke in the name of a Parisian cafe... My friends have been insisting me to check out this place for quite a while now but my preference for the good old fav corners has been a big impediment to this plan. The only positive response aftr leaving this place is that I was absolutely correct abt such uppity places. With all due respect to the people who serve...I wish dey had reciprocated that behavior which there ambience seems to promise. After  being disgusted for a while looking at the folks who shot some very quizzical or snobbish expressions my food did arrive.. It was not bad. But sadly any eatery can just not be judged by how the food tastes...

When i entered the cafe,the first thought that striked me was "Why did'nt i visit this place before?" In simple words i loved the ambience. The space is a little less as its like a home..if you know what i mean. But the decor is very cute..food tastes good. And they have books that you can read while devouring..lol no devouring is a harsh word for this calm n quiet place...'enjoyin'..enjoying your food :P.  And they have got a store as you enter,there's ethnic wears m jwellerey,and ESSENTIAL OILS AT A MUCH CHEAP PRICE!!!!! And i feel that the price of everything over there,including food is lower n reasonable.

You have to come here for the feel and energy ...it is contagious. The closely placed tables makes you comfortable with strangers as well. The upturned baskets make up the ceiling,mirrors on the wall talks about a very minimalistic approach to decor. It looks very inviting intriguing  serving  absolutely delish food. The contentment on my friends face after her first sip of coffee still remains unparalleled. And mind you she has been to Italy and done all the jazz. The spicy hot chocolate is dark and spicy (duh uh cinnamon and red chilli flakes) slowly and steadily wins your heart. The pesto mozzarella tomato sandwich is exceptional and the roasted red pepper pumpkin soup superb, The sandwich and soup they have got it spot on . A must must try! 
The whoopie chocolate pies were just fine . Nothing to gaga over.
You gotta eat here.
Because of the ambience, amazing pesto and velvety smooth soup!!
We happened to pick some liquor chocolate from Allthings . Expensive but worth every penny. 
Dont be surprised if you end up shopping a bit arnd here . 
Eat greet and shop ...the perfect combination.

People love the ambiance of this place and I can't lie, they have done a really good job when it came to their decor and setting.
Adorned with fairy lights, Sienna Café is one of those places that serves food and merchandise both.
Although Sienna Store has very edgy things to purchase from, when it came to their food, it didn't impress me much. We ordered their popular Fried Chicken & Salad and Aglio Olio Pasta. While the pasta seemed under-seasoned, the good points were that it was thoroughly cooked and the flavor was somewhat still up there.
With their Fried Chicken, the batter had a good crunch. However I personally would have liked my order with a side of dip. Flavors lacked depth.
Verdict: Food is average as per cost. However, people go there just for the ambiance. The cozy setting, the soft murmurs- everything adds up to a lovely experience.

This is a very beautiful cafe with some real good interiors with outdoor seating arrangement as well.
The ambience is very lively.
The food choices are less here.Lots of fresh juices are available here.Even the sauces are chef made.
We took a Tuna Sandwich which came with generous portions of chips.
The sandwich was soft and melted inside the mouth.
The chicken fry came with fresh salad and it tasted average.
The mango lassi was nice.Overall,the decoration is the main attraction of this place.
The staffs are friendly.

On our second visit,we had their famous mutton pizza,walnut and cheese cream crostini,chocolate shake and cake with ice cream.
They do not have huge options in food section but their miced meat pizza is really unique and very delicious.It is a wholesome dish and we loved it.
The walnut crostini with cream cheese is a healthy and yummy dish.
Chocolate shake is great.
Also the almond cake we had with vanilla ice cream was fresh and hot and tasted great.
Service is prompt and we had a nice experience here again.

At the heart of south Calcutta stands this very posh looking small and dainty cafe. It's Decor is crafted to perfection with very things of everyday life. The sitting area is nicely done with very interesting lighting.this store also houses its collection of beautifully handcrafted products. One can easily scan through the lovely products while waiting for their food. We had only tea n coffee which was quite decent. It was served with small bite sized tea cakes which was really good to taste. A highly recommended places for the suckers of art and aesthetics.

On a busy evening the staff and the owners were unfazed a d most courteous. Loved their presentation of food. I specifically lived their fried chicken along with the subtle and simple tasted cucumbers and tomatoes in the side. The fried chicken was exactly what it should have been... crisp and succulent. We also had baked fish with bread on the side. What I loved was the fresh watermelon juice served in the mason's jars. Freshly squeezed and without any additional sugar ; it was the perfect thirst quencher. However some more dessert options would be welcome. And last but not the least loved and appreciated their gift of pot of honey for their one year celebrations.

i just realized today that i haven't written about Sienna though i LOVE this place !!! hence its seems only apt that i should just when it completes a year that is tmrw 6/11/16. the ambience make the place - be it the wall with all kinds of photo frames, or the wall with little nick nacks/ iron pipes with light bulbs at the end.. the decor so different and nice. i always believe that the proof of the pudding is in the taste of the food  oh that is where they score. Everything you order here is delicious - chicken & cheese sandwich/ mince stuffed capsicum/ avocado tortilla salad ice tea, madeleines, eggplant cheese poppers... they make very nice masala tea and last but not the least they take the humble french fries and make it a must have every time i visit.  Happy first Anniversary Sienna

This place has a very comfortable feel to it. You can spend hours here all by yourself and not get bored. The seating area is small and the menu limited, but it's all worth it. There's a store too with some beautiful clothes and accessories at display. The interiors of the cafe look incomplete in the sense that they appear rusticated with a naked brick wall and another wall with blue paint. The studio lights brighten up the place as well as provide a positive atmosphere. The drinks were all well made. Had the iced American, cappuccino and mocha. The iced cappuccino had the perfect balance of milk and sugar. The mocha had a dominating taste of chocolate. To accompany all this we had aubergine pizza wedges and sundried tomato and mushroom pasta. The pizza wedges were served in slices of brown bread and the aubergine paste was creamy and nutty. The pasta had a really tangy flavour of tomatoes with the intensity of parsley. The pasta was cooked al dente. They served generous amount of food and drinks and the prices were all reasonable. Definitely a very good place to eat , drink or shop.

I absolutely loved this place. It is just amazing. It is a small yet comfortable and cozy cafe. As soon as u enter it, it seems more like you have entered a cute European cafe. We ordered for Avacodo salad, Spaghetti in sundried tomato sauce and Homemade bread with Mozerlla Cheese and cherry tomatoe dip. We loved all of it. I can't specifically choose which one was the best, each one seemed exceptionally good. For drinks we ordered Ice mocha and Nebu jal. While iced mocha was just bang on, Nebu jol was just average. For desserts we had the chocolate fondue. And gosh that was the bestd one I have ever had.
All in all I loved the place and I am definitely going back here.

This place is small place and some of the tables have a lil uncomfortable siting. The roasted beetroot salad with mozzarella was our first order..... the salad was superb bcoz of the combination of ingredients in it.... the chef didn't have much to do. I would have loved some dressing though. The fried chicken was also juicy n tasty. I didn't like the pasta with roasted tomatoes... it needed to be a little more simple... didn't like the overdose of red sauce while I expected roasted tomatoes... overall different kind of food.

A boutique cafe. Collections for the fabric and jewellery is amazing. Do give a peep there before sitting for the food.
Pretty decoration, unusual though. The frame wall is my favourite. Outdoor seating with the fairy lights on top with baskets..innovative.
Health cafe as it says, it actually lives up to it.
We ordered a mozarella pesto sandwich which the served with potato chips (they could have left out) .
A watermelon juice, fresh, refreshing and healthy. With no added sugar it was sweet and pleasant. I ordered for an iced mocha.. Which rather I expected to have a little sweetness in it..But they served the sugar along side. Never mind.
Speedy service, amiable staff. And cozy ambience !

This place has a very comfortable feel to it. You can spend hours here all by yourself and not get bored. The seating area is small and the menu limited, but it's all worth it. There's a store too with some beautiful clothes and accessories at display. The interiors of the cafe look incomplete in the sense that they appear rusticated with a naked brick wall and another wall with blue paint. The studio lights brighten up the place as well as provide a positive atmosphere. The drinks were all well made. Had the iced American, cappuccino and mocha. The iced cappuccino had the perfect balance of milk and sugar. The mocha had a dominating taste of chocolate. To accompany all this we had aubergine pizza wedges and sundried tomato and mushroom pasta. The pizza wedges were served in slices of brown bread and the aubergine paste was creamy and nutty. The pasta had a really tangy flavour of tomatoes with the intensity of parsley. The pasta was cooked al dente. They served generous amount of food and drinks and the prices were all reasonable. Definitely a very good place to eat , drink or shop.

I absolutely loved this place. It is just amazing. It is a small yet comfortable and cozy cafe. As soon as u enter it, it seems more like you have entered a cute European cafe. We ordered for Avacodo salad, Spaghetti in sundried tomato sauce and Homemade bread with Mozerlla Cheese and cherry tomatoe dip. We loved all of it. I can't specifically choose which one was the best, each one seemed exceptionally good. For drinks we ordered Ice mocha and Nebu jal. While iced mocha was just bang on, Nebu jol was just average. For desserts we had the chocolate fondue. And gosh that was the bestd one I have ever had.
All in all I loved the place and I am definitely going back here.

This place is small place and some of the tables have a lil uncomfortable siting. The roasted beetroot salad with mozzarella was our first order..... the salad was superb bcoz of the combination of ingredients in it.... the chef didn't have much to do. I would have loved some dressing though. The fried chicken was also juicy n tasty. I didn't like the pasta with roasted tomatoes... it needed to be a little more simple... didn't like the overdose of red sauce while I expected roasted tomatoes... overall different kind of food.

A boutique cafe. Collections for the fabric and jewellery is amazing. Do give a peep there before sitting for the food.
Pretty decoration, unusual though. The frame wall is my favourite. Outdoor seating with the fairy lights on top with baskets..innovative.
Health cafe as it says, it actually lives up to it.
We ordered a mozarella pesto sandwich which the served with potato chips (they could have left out) .
A watermelon juice, fresh, refreshing and healthy. With no added sugar it was sweet and pleasant. I ordered for an iced mocha.. Which rather I expected to have a little sweetness in it..But they served the sugar along side. Never mind.
Speedy service, amiable staff. And cozy ambience !

One of my favorite new cafes in the city! Call ahead and book yourself an avocado salad; they run out often. I love the decor (even the bathroom is beautiful...I want that sink), and it'd be the perfect coworking spot if I didn't live in Salt Lake. This is also a *very* good place to eat out or for a meeting if you're eating low-carb (unlike, well, pretty much everywhere else in the city).

I have had their avocado tortilla salad, the distinctive fries, walnut and cream crostinis, the fried chicken and the pesto platter. Highly recommend the avocado salad - very flavourful, the olive oil they use is quite fragrant, they are generous with the avocado and the tortillas are nutty with the right amount of crunch. The fries used to be Rs55 till recently. Just saw they have hiked it up to 90+. Bummer. 'Cause I used to have a plateful of those with a black coffee while I worked. They also served the fries with this deadly chilly sauce - sour and sweet and grainy. That was missing last time I went. Found the walnut and cream crostinis too heavy and cloying. But the pesto platter's smashing - with a cup full of basil pesto and another full of baby tomatoes and feta cheese . Best bread and pesto in town. But hey, what happened to the cheese, guys? What I was served the last two times was definitely not feta. I have to talk about the ambience.  The blue tiles are rather soothing. Lots of hipsters, blingy aunties, and yuppie wannabes hang out here. They could do with a few more seats. It can get quite noisy when the bling aunties or the wannabes troop in.

A beautiful tiny cafe. The ambience gives you the vibes of an European cafe, someplace where you could just be in your own happy space. Has a concise menu. I ordered for a plate of homemade bread with pesto and cherry tomato dip and Pasta with Sundried tomatoes and mushroom sauce . Absolutely loved it. The iced mocha was just right in taste. The staff was polite and helpful. Overall, a well fed and well spent afternoon ❤️

Ok, what's with Kolkata and its cafes selling wearables, or rather turning fashion boutiques into cafés. But it seems to be working well here. Sienna cafe has amazing tea cakes. I loved the warm financier with ice cream. And even their masala chai is very good. Hard to locate but the place is not bad at all.

Clearly one of the best cafes in Kolkata, hands down! Easily accessible from both gariahat more and Purna Das road, this place kind of grows on you. There is something strikingly soothing about the earthy hues and the super intelligent use of space and decor that makes for great conversations. Don't forget to try their fried chicken with salad. It's an work of art. So is the Pesto tomato mozarella sandwich! One of those places that makes you want to visit it again and again. Simply amazing.

Went here for an evening out with 3 other friends. Was bowled over by the decor and ambience. It is really commendable how they have used seeminly inexpensive things like 'jhuris' and 'vanaspati ghee tins' to give this place a quirky look.
Coming to the food, the four of us ordered a couple cups of masala CTC , cold coffee (in bulky mason jars) and 3 mufffins, whose unique flavour combination won our hearts. One was the regular chocolate, another was a combination of ginger and walnut and the last had orange and poppy seeds. They were DELICIOUS.
The major drawback of the place is that we found it overpriced as we had gone here randomly from our campus, without planning. It is not really advisable to land up here casually without checking the prices on zomato and the amount in your purse; well atleast if you are unemployed students like us.

This place is on point for good interiors and decor. Though a little cozy, every corner has been aesthetically decorated. The coolest part was the menu which instead of being put across tables, they managed to use the menu also as a prop for wall decoration. Sensible use of resources! But as much as I was wowed by the decoration, the food din't really work that well for me. I started with aam panna juice followed by chicken cheese grilled sandwich and after the end of which I decided not to order further.  

It is good to see such thematic cafes trending in the city, but ultimately what a cafe stands for is good coffee and food. How long otherwise can you sit at a place if you don't have good food. Food quality and options much be seen to.

A small quaint cafe at Hindustan Park, the Sienna Store & Cafe is certainly a delight to the senses. I have been to this cafe a few times and every single time, I'm awed by the quirkiness and simplicity of the place. The entrance leads you to the store which is like a treasure trove of collectibles and ethnic wear. The cafe is housed in the rear and displays dainty installations. The use of recycled materials find predominance. The interiors are done in elements of blue with subdued lights that lends this place a very comfy relaxing atmosphere. My favourite portion of the cafe is offcourse the semi-outdoor that gives you a nice feel-good vibe with all the greenery and stunning installations. 
When it comes to food, Sienna Store & Cafe is more noted for its coffees, teas and cakes. My usual favourites are Cappuccino or the cold version thereof or a simple Americano. On my last visit, I tried the fried chicken with salad and boy, it was delicious. Two decent sized breasts of chicken, lightly fried with herbs and served with fresh salad...this is soul food at its best. I have heard rave reviews about their pasta and my next visit there will definitely find me trying out the pesto pasta.

Sienna is kinda Calcutta's answer to Social with limited space and no alcohol. The interiors will give you a great aesthetic pleasure with an amazing playlist and comfortable ambience. The menu doesn't have much variation but isn't over priced either. Capsicum stuffed with minced meat is something you should go for with a mug of french fries which you cannot afford to finish cos of the huge quantity and I shouldn't have ordered the Affogato. Tag along with your friends or go alone, this place will only lift your mood up.

Innovation found its new meaning here, using all types of recycling materials furnishing this cafe it stand in its own glory. BUT, visiting this place i felt it is overhyped by other people in zomato, making that its only limitation. Service and display of menu card would have been better.
May be proper for them who likes afternoon nibbles and long overdue gossips over coffee and snacks. Bill amount of ours was approximately 500 INR (which includes fried chicken, assam tea and americano).
Totally an exotic cafe for a place like calcutta,  recommendation wouldn't be there unless you are galvanised by the hype.
P.S. As the name suggest there is a separate store for garments and crockeries just at the entrance.

I've been there a couple times and this review is solely based on the hot chocolate we had, because I always prefer to eat from the Byloom cafe. The hot chocolate was fantastic on the first day. However, on the second day, they probably added some extra bit of clove and it was troubling everyone's throat. So, not so happy. I'm guessing it was those once a while fiasco. Otherwise, extremely well decorated, cozy and I absolutely love the rustic brick-walled look.

This review is divided into two parts: The ambiance, and the food.

The Ambiance: This is yet another gem hidden among the treelines of Hindustan Park, amidst the crisscross of concrete buildings and metalled roads. When you enter this place, you have to ask someone where the cafe portion of the store is, because the front of the store is a treasure chest of handcrafted and ready made materials ranging from pottery to clothing. When you make your way leaving the walled bookshelf behind you, a beautiful seating area appears in front of you, with a diner-esque arrangement. Everything is tastefully selected over here, from the tables to the wall bulbs in earthen casings.

The food: This is probably the best café in Hindustan Park area, I might be wrong, but to me it felt like one. It felt comfortable, not just because of its chairs, but because of the taste of the food along with the ambiance. It feels welcoming to the taste buds and makes you want to stay more. It makes you want to read a book while you sip away at your cappuccino.

We ordered a cappuccino, an espresso and potato fries. The cappuccino was aplenty perfect with the blend of coffee and cream, but the star of the show was certainly the potato fries. It came in a mug, almost overflowing. It looks welcoming to the eyes and it hits you right in the sweet spot when you eat it. The potatoes are sweet, crispy, spicy and at the same time salty and irresistible. Moreover the pocket pinch doesn't hurt you and it feels like the best place to blow off some steam.

Final thoughts: Would I go again? Absolutely yes. I have yet to try everything else on their menu.

Seldom do we find a place that can take our breath away and make us fall head-over-heels in love! Sienna Cafe is one such place. It's one of the best Cafes in town to have a nice chilled evening with your friends or just enjoy a peaceful little me-time. The decor is at it's quirkiest best, with a laid-back, relaxed ambience. Recycled chairs and installations make this adorable Cafe THE place to be. The menu consists of a variety of interesting dishes like Grapefruit Mozzarella Salad, Bok Choy & Shrimp Soup, Tuna Sandwiches and the likes. Our personal favorite is the Fried Chicken with Salad, that they serve with this hot hot Dip!😍 The Chicken is fried to the perfect crunch with herbs and we love how it's not dripping with oil. The salad is such a fresh accompaniment to the dish plus we always have to ask for a second helping of the heavenly Chilli Dip. Go have your share of the crunchy goodness this weekend!😌

Limited items on the menu. Since, I am not used to not at all masala waale khaana, it took me 3/4 bites to adjust to the taste.
I took the salad, which I thought could have a little salt in it. But nevertheless, it felt refreshing to have it.
The black ice tea(lemon ice tea) seemed insipid at first compared to all the other places I've had it. But then, that also seemed fine.
French fries was good :)
People who have an eye for art and unconventional décor should surely visit this place.
The thoughtfulness of the interior designer is highly appreciated. Even the light tunes played in the cafe is soothing. A cosy place where one can either go with a friend to have a hearty chat and also alone to work or read a book.
Kuddos to the this place.

A boutique cafe is the right term for this place...a contemporary European cafe layout and decor using recycled items makes it a little spunky..I ordered the avocado tortilla salad and celery cucumber juice both were okayish...
The sundried tomato and mushroom pasta was a little cold to my taste and the watermelon juice was quite boring for its price
The french fries were nice
All in all go there for "lets try a new cafe" experience

Like the club culture of the 70 in present days the trending topic is café. All over kolkata cafes spring up every now and then, everyone trying to do something different. One such place is Sienna Cafe and Store. And what a place it is. From the lights on the iron pipes on the brick wall to the chawk board menu to the outdoor sitting, everything is creativity at its uniqueness. 
Coming to the food, we ordered Cappuccino, Pesto Tomato Mozzarella Sandwich, Fried Chicken and Salad and to finish it just perfectly Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. Like the ambiance and the rustic recycled design food here is also good. Good because somewhere presentation became more important than taste. Don't misunderstand me. Food here is very good and it has the potential to be great or extraordinary, but right now it's not. 
If you visit with firends and like me if you are going out after a long time, these won't matter. The surrounding does it all. But a light music would have been better. Some Beatles maybe....
And they have a shop section also selling books some apparels and more. They have a descent collection to surf around.

The store is exquisite! While waiting for the table, one can happily check out the beautiful stuff they offer...ranging from apparels to accessories and household decorative pieces. Pocket pinch? Yes, a bit!

The eating area is divided into few sections. Optimum utilization of space I must say. We were there on a Sunday evening and the place was extremely noisy.

We ordered 2 Darjeeling green teas, 1 chocolate muffin, 1 choco-chip muffin, 1 hot chocolate and 1 Asian salad.

The tea was good, served with a tiny strip of cake. Both the muffins were great. We loved the muffins. Hot chocolate was delicious! The Asian salad was decent but we did not like the addition of wai-wai (most probably) to add the crunchiness.  

Price was okay. Portion was sufficient. Service was okay.

Recommended!

Well finally found a quality cafe in Kolkata serving cafe food with an unmatched classy recycled decor. We had the Chicken Cheese Sandwich and Baked Fish. The baked fish was more of a gratinated dish with fish cubes and a sauce. It tasted pretty well but I was expecting a baked fish instead. My Sandwich was tasty and really nice wish they had a little bigger portion size for the sandwich as it was served as a main.

Drinks were fine and nice. The 4.5 is for the awesome ambiance and vibe of the place. Definitely gonna come back but hope your food gets a bit more refined. Menu is perfect and pricing is also fine. Two thumbs up.

Honestly was so impressed with the pictures of the decor, i visited sienna today for only the ambiance and no expectations with the quality of food. However, the decor and the ambience was even better. With regards to the food, i was impressed there as well. You don't usually expect the backside of a house to turn into a beautiful mini cafe but this was possible for the blue tiles on the tables, beautiful lamps on top of the tables and wall hangings along with the  fairy lights stuck to baskets on the ceilings bordered by plastic leaves. The place is very well lit for the natural light coming through the transparent window panels  but when the fairy lights were lit during the evening, it was even better. A Cafe has to/needs to serve good coffee. And i loved the cappuccino and my friend enjoyed her iced mocha too. I also tried the Madeleine chocochip cake with ice cream , that was a delight too. I will surely visit again. 
I personally don't like board menu's so  that's a negative. 
Verdict : Perfect cafe to enjoy a good snack and coffee this monsoon season.

I loved the cafe mocha with the balance of chocolate syrup to add flavor to it. Even the ghol is a good option for a refreshing beverage for summers. Also, mind you their cakes are to die for. Overall I really enjoyed the ambience and the food and I recommend all my friends to go visit this cafe.

Recycling old tins,  cane baskets,  vintage windows.  Overall very pleasing.  

Had the watermelon feta salad.  And iced green tea both were very refreshing  and to my taste...  I did need to sprinkle so e chili flakes on the salad as I like chili with my fruit.  The green tea was nice and was brewed well.  

Picked up a packet of mini almond cakes...  Forgot to click them. Overall An awesome  experience. Sukanto who took my order was very warm and I'll surely be back.

A lovely European themed cafe, located at Hindustan Park Road. The first question, which should be answered is why you should come here. This place is more about decor and innovation, than it is about food or drinks. If you have ever been to a hill station by a car, you must have had noticed the beautiful small habitats, falling in between large stretch of mountainous roads. This place is just like that. Once you enter and you keep walking, it would be like a stroll on the roads of a a beautiful town. The ambiance and the decoration would simply make you awestruck. The marketing gimmick comes here first. Loaded with Sarees, Kurtis, Earings, Gift items and other accessories, this is a perfect example of 4P of Marketing. You have the place, you have positioned your items carefully, the pricing is not sky high and you have people attracted to your store, not because they might come there to purchase your items, but they might just buy a think or two on their way back home after having a lovely time with their partners or buddies.

To come over here, take the lane opposite Basanti Devi College and then take the 2nd left (The one after Krystal Chopsticks). Leave 6 or 7 houses to your right and the cafe would be right there in front of you. The place was mostly full today. Fortunately we managed to find a decent sitting place.When we asked for the menu, we were told that the menu is kept outside displayed on a wall. A bit of an inconvenience though. This isn't a roadside dhaba where the menu would be displayed on the wall and one would need to choose one dish out of the ones being put up. We prefered to refer to Zomato. We were about to order our choosing, when we were handed a leaflet with some newly introduced items. I do not exactly remember the name, but it was some Grilled Mutton dish that we decided to order. Along with this, I ordered for an Iced Cappuccino, while my friend preferred a Iced Black Tea.

The food and drinks were served in no time. The Cappuccino was made good but was slightly on the watery side. The temperature was mostly of a room temperature one. The quantity was awfully low with the container being filled like 3/4th of its total capacity. The Iced Tea was of the same quantity as well. I did not like the taste for this one, but my friend remarked that it was done brilliantly. The food arrived shortly. It was 4 medium portion of Lamb Chops served with sour cream and olives. The first thing we struggled here was with the size of the plates. They were awfully small while the knife and the fork was comparatively bigger. It was like Andre the Giant, holding the hand of a 2 month old kid. We barely managed to keep a single portion of the lamb on the plate, rest alone handle it with the gigantic utensils. Barring one portion, most of them were grilled wonderfully. However, being the typical Bongs we were, it was kinda hard to cut through the small and miniscule bits and pieces. I personally would have had preferred to have this back home or atleast have it at a place where one could eat the portions with our own hand.

The sour cream was an absolute disaster. The flavor totally spoiled the one from the lamb. Once we realised that the sour cream was of no use, we resorted back to have the lambs on its own without any accompainment. The lamb, I must admit was beautifully done. I could not get the masala and spices used to tamper the portions with, but it had a lovely earthy aroma imbibed in the dish. The quantity appeared to be less when compared to the price, but the quality totally made it up for me. The drinks however could not keep up with the food and created a disharmony. The total bill came up to Rs. 500 (exact) after adding up all the taxes. This place has a limited menu and needs to expand on it. The quality too needs a huge boost. The concept here might be different but this place risks getting lost into oblivion, if it doesn't buck up and do a BPR. The food and drinks were delivered fast, but the initial approach and the final attempt to procure a bill involved much hiccup. This place has the potential to do a lot more but right now the approach is mostly casual. I hope they will buckle up soon and provide everyone a chance to drop back soon to enjoy better food and drinks.

LOCATION:

Hindustan Park. Describing how to get there wont really help in this case so much rather use the GPS.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

With so many cafes opening up in the city with almost the same menu with a few differences here and there, one has to really search hard to find something truly unique. Sienna is one such place. Its mostly a clothing and accessory store with a small cafe in the rear portion. Interior wise I think its the best done up cafe in town at present and standing reminder of the fact that simple and quirky is better than grand and boring. Its one of those cafes which will remind you of one of those quirky art cafes in Goa if you have been to one. Where good friends can meet and talk about their ex's at a corner on stools or wives can meet and complain about their husbands over a cup of brew or professionals can enjoy a sandwich and a coffee while working on their laptops. 

Honestly, ambience wise go there and see for your selves. I would hate to take that smile of being there the first time away from you.

WINE & DINE:

They have an extremely selected menu with no mains. Theres limited salad, sandwiches, soups, desserts and fondue with beverages. The kitchen is run out of a pantry sized room with a decent enough service counter. I called for a chicken and cheese sandwich and a chocolate cake.

The Sandwich was served as a jaffle. It was more like the ones we are use to having at home, just done well with simple flavors. Yet all the flavors shone through which added a hint of professional preparation to the dish itself. The crisps served with it were of great quality.

The chocolate cake was more of a muffin yet it was prepared perfectly. It was light, not too sweet and had a good amount of cocoa. I would go back for it.

Service was a little novice. The guy did not have much of a clue of customer satisfaction but then when you are there, you really wont care about it much , trust me on that :). The ambience will win you over in no time.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

Service needs to be better. When one asks if they do chocolate milk shake one does not expect the reply " Madam ne yahee menu diya hai"..lol!!. A simple "Sorry sir but we don't have it " will do just fine.

VERDICT:

A gem of a cafe hidden from all the bustle and noise. You might find it hard to believe this, but there is so much to explore within this hardly 20 seater cafe.

One of the best findings in recent times for me considering the food and ambiance. The very concept of a courtyard converted to an air-conditioned cafe with glass walls, gives a homely touch to it. The quirky overhead lighting, the fairy lights and candles on every table adds to the charm. The unconventional menu card, the mason jars for drinks and the oh-so-cute cow-shaped milk pots will delight you. Both the hot and cold beverages available in this cafe are good but the food is better. The quality of fish served to us in a dish made with spinach was really good and so was the taste. Overall a great place to hang out with friends and family especially in the evenings, when this place seems magical.

had seen pretty pictures of this place on instagram and that gave me the boost to visit this place. well yeah , o my gosh! how pretty can it be. the alley of fairy lights and use of recycle material made this place more earthen and suiting to its decor. the utilisation of space makes me give a thumbs up to the decor all the more. 
i visited sienna with few of my best friends and thankfully did get a cozy corner seat. but may be because it was saturday and there was quite rush, we managed to get that corner seat after waiting for half n hour. but nevertheless the chattery us and the store artifacts kept us busy. as for food, we had ordered iced cappuchino, chicken and cheese sandwich and masala chai. the masala chai was at its perfection and stole all the credits out of all the food that we had ordered. the sandwich was okayish and so was the cappuchino. but for the decor and masala chai to sip it and read at the corner of cafe, i would visit this place again. a nice cute den in south kolkata i must say :)

Once on a Saturday evening, I happened to land up at this place & as I entered I was taken to my most favourite place - Khoai at Santiniketan. The difference -  I enjoy the handicrafts and the crockery sets at Khoai amidst nature but at Sienna the enjoyment is inside an air-conditioned finely decor place with a cup of flavoured coffee and delicious munchies. The decor is really appreciable, something which Kolkata didn't experience before. The scrolled menu, the well-planned lighting, the seating everything is just fine.
It's a very cosy place  and I would recommend the place for a long chat with your best buddy.

What a wonderfully quaint little lovely store and cafe. I simply loved the ambience of the place, it truly appealed to all that was artistic in me. In front is this wonderful boutique and Knick knacks store and behind Is the cafe. It's different from other café's..in that it gives a feeling of being in an old mansion,eating and drinking either coffee, tea or fruit juice there. There is one tiny room and then there is outdoor seating with blue tiled tables and paint can cushioned stools and plastic chairs. Above there is a canopy of lights in baskets with an array of foliage ( artificial). The menu is very limited but that's ok the ambience makes up for it. The menu is in three segments on the walls. The food menu is in a brown paper scroll on one wall. The drinks menu behind the counter and the pastry menu on a blackboard on another wall. We had eggplant and hummus with naan, Lemon iced tea,lebu jal and cakes with icecream. All were good .  Happy with the experience.

This place is an example of a cafe where you want to take your best friend and chat for hours .
The decor is elegant . Very well speaks of the choice of the owner . It have been a regular visitor of sienna store at salt lake city centre and jodhpur park . So I happened to visit there to see the collection . Ended up being impressed by the cafe .
Though I only took a cup of Darjeeling tea but it was well made . I would love to visit this place again .
Quite impressed .

For a change this is a cafe with healthy food options :-) Tea and coffee based beverages taste good. Try out some of the salads like the avocado and tortilla with corn and baked beans. These are quite fresh and also good for the health conscious individuals. 

Only issue is the sitting arrangement which is quite uncomfortable! However it is somewhat compensated by good staff and fresh food. Recommended!

Definitely one of the trully great cafes in the city. While most cafes seem to cater to the 'quick-coffee-while-i-wait-for-my-client' customer, Sienna is lovely because you can sit here with a cup of coffee and read a book. With a working, free wi-fi connection (something, which shouldn't be so incredibly difficult to find) and lovely music and decor - the place is ideal to work, read, chill or for a date. Either alone or with friends, the food will blow your minds. Of course, if you don't like healthy, fresh, robust ingredients and inventive cooking - then this place is obviously not for you. An additional word for the coffee: I am a coffee fiend and in a city which veers obviously towards tea, good coffee is surprisingly hard to find. This place, with its freshly brewed coffee is a godsend.

The sun-dried tomato and mushroom spaghetti was lovely! The cafe` is very pretty and cute. It's like one of those cozy little cafe`s in hills. The menu isn't  huge spread, but it has just enough options to choose from. The drinks are a little expensive, I feel. Overall, it is quite an affordable place with brilliant food. My experience was great. Would visit again soon. :)The store has cool stuff too ;)P.S. am a vegetarian.

In no time, this place has turned out to be one of my most favourite hangout spots when on a vacation to the city. 
Location: Walk into the lane right opp Basanti Devi College Gariahat and after entering the lane, walk straight and take the 2nd left right after Krystal Chopstick. Once you enter the 2nd left, you'll spot Sienna on your right after 7-8 buildings. There's a popular boutique called Byloom located right opp Sienna  
Ambience: The ambience is stunning. Simply stunning. You'll feel like you've been transported to a small European town, like in the cobbled streets of southern France or the cafes of Santorini. The theme colors used in the décor are blue and white and each and every item, starting from the plates which they serve in, right upto the furniture are all crafted by the owners. The best part about the place is that it's air conditioned and still has an outdoorsy, garden like feel to it. There  are multiple plants and beautiful candles placed on every table: a perfect date spot

Food: The food is a 3.5/5 owing to the not-so-fantastic preparation. However the food (taste wise) actually deserves a 3 and the extra 0.5 is just because of the stunning menu selection. We tried their celery cucumber juice, the pesto platter, water melon juice, the spaghetti with mushrooms, lebu jol and vegetable fritters.  I liked the  pesto dip with the platter but what's with that naan! Who serves naan at such a stunning place, whatsoever happened to pita or lavash? The spaghetti was cooked homes style and tasted fantastic, just wish that for the price (300 INR) the sprinkling of parmesan as well as the quantity of portion of the dish were better. The juice was fresh and upto the mark, nothing more nothing less. We tried the choco chip muffin too, which tasted good (not great': can have a more homely feel to it, along with being fluffier and melt in your mouth).The servers seem pretentious yet have trouble understanding extended sentences in English, that seemed funny to me.  Food quality is great (the ingredients are fresh and a lot of them I hear are home grown) but the recipes and service need improvement

Overall, this place isn't really cheap and a meal for 2  could cost around 700 INR per person (with a pasta, 2 drinks, 1 dessert, 1 pesto platter). On regular days, 200 INR per person would be sufficient. I would say that Sienna is worth multiple visits owing to the ambience, look and feel of the place, a novelty in a city like Calcutta. We need to keep such cafes coming!

Sienna is popular with young people who go there mostly for the ambience and coffee/tea or soft drinks. Not a place to go for Dinner. The customers are expected to guess the menu, as there is no printed menu available..and the servers don't know much either. Ours suggested that we have a cheese and chicken sandwich at 9.30 p.m. for dinner !!
The Fried Chicken was mostly batter and the slivers of chicken marking its presence  were still raw and bloody.  The eggplant dish was merely " Begun Pora " but with some chopped tomatoes.,not bad, but the Naan that came with it , well..the soles of my 5 year old  Birkenstock would have had a better texture.  .
The Prawns were good but @ Rs 450/- plus taxes, for two pieces ?  I could have bought 1 kg of Bagda for that amount.  I ordered a salad of Avocado and beans.  The Avocado was rotten, quite black but the Chef had decided to serve it anyway, believing that the customers don't know the difference.  Had to leave most of it..the Chef apologised but decided to still charge us for it ..rotten or not. Also the Chef needs a lesson in making a proper Hummus, because the one he served would have had any self respecting Lebanese chef hang himself by his apron.    
If you want PRETENTIOUS  food  served by surly and incompetent waiters, by all means go...but if you want to eat decent food at Rs 750/- + per person....stay Far far away.

Loved the place for the tastefully done up interior and the beautiful pottery work along with the selected display of ethnic wear and matching jewelries. The place had a unique charm and the cool blue shades all around had a soothing effect on the mind. The brick walls adorned with assorted frames and the blue and gray cups and pots hanging from the shelves gave the place a classy look and feel... something which got amplified by the copper jewellery and showpieces neatly pinned between the trendy outfits on display. 
By the time you were almost done with the boutique you would get enticed by the rich aroma of fresh bakes and accidentally discover a cafe carefully tucked inside. There was an equally appealing outdoor counterpart which kind of gave the feel of a French bistro with a matching decor. They served healthy continental food and drinks in the same turquoise shaded earthenware, and the cucumber and celery juice was just perfect for us while we visited during the scorching summer heat. The baked dishes and salads were quite good, though the service was a tad slow. Loved the baked fish with spinach served with brown bread, and the fried chicken wings with cucumber and tomato salad tasted good too. 
The decor outside was neat and the glass covered roof with the ac was a respite from the heat, at the same time offering an outdoor feel.
The place can get a bit crowded during peak hours, hence needs more space with adequate seating arrangements and the low lying stools were a bit of a turn off considering the overall elegance. The spread has room for improvement too and should include more choices of bread and continental items.

What a tiny little peace of loveliness ! I have been to the Jodhpur park store a couple of times so was eager to come to the new store. Loved the cafe . its décor quaint and rustic though no expenses have been spared. Those transparent chairs must have cost a bomb. Absolutely loved the quirky lights. The food was really well presented. The cucumber and celery juice was refreshing and the tuna salad was wholesome. We also ordered the platter with pesto and bread which was nice aswell. Would have liked to try the cold cucumber soup but they were out. Courteous staff. Good place for a week day brunch for two. The place is really narrow so I am not taking a whole bunch of people together . the place outside has air-conditioning too which was s big relief. Will be back for more soon .

Changed the rating to 3.5 after terribly lazy service of the last two times we were there including yesterday. Service is all over the place , specially when the owner isn't there. Note - it took is 20 minutes to get a server. 30 mins for an iced tea and that arrived without ice and after the food. And the ham cheese sandwiches sounded good on the menu , turned out to be burned at the edges not mention very very late for something made in the sandwich maker.

Reason for such high ratings for the Sienna Cafe is just for their ambience. Yesterday, me and my friend were supposed to go to Kurry Klub for dinner. We had time and no place to go. So, we creeped into this place as we were in Gariahat to sip in some coffee and pass the time. So suddenly, this place came to my mind. It has been open for long still I couldn't manage to come here. Why not give it a try?
It's located just opposite to the ByLoom Canteen at Hindusthan Park. I had visited the store earlier. That time, I saw the seating arrangements inside only and didn't realise that they have outside seating arrangements too. This time, we sat outside. The fun part is although they have seating arrangements outside, it's architectured in such a manner that you don't have to live by the scorching heat or rains of Kolkata. It's covered with glass surfaces on top air conditioned. So outdoor feeling and air conditioning comes together as a package. That's obviously gave them a brownie point!
It's planned in a very different manner. The first part has the store with the cafe behind it. The decor is beautiful giving the feeling of an outdoor cafe in Santorini. The perfectly matched blue and ash walls would give you a feeling of strolling by the islands of Oia, maybe. I am in love with this place now. The windows, the ceilings with beautifully curated lights and everything over there was so magically realistic that I cannot depict the beauty in my words.
The spread over there is mostly salads and sandwiches - no junk food, all healthy stuffs. We didn't go for anything like that as we had dinner due somewhere else. But we ordered an Americano and an Aam Panna. My friend who drank the coffee said it was strong and flavourful, something that suited his tastebuds. Even the Aam Panna was good. It was made with real pulp. But I think it could have been a bit sweeter.
I loved the wooden game coasters placed on each table to pass your time. Have got plans to come back here soon to try their spread and spend some quality time with my loved ones. You gotta come here for the sake of their ambience and beauty. Definitely recommended. Happy Dining! :)

My experience so far with this place , as far as food is concerned is only limited to drinks 

Things ordered: 
1) cold coffee with single shot : my all time favorite drink which I must've tried in all the corners of the world. They did get it quite right . The ice was crushed well and the drink wasn't too milky or too watery or too sweet

2) Iced tea: again right amount of it all

3) mango smoothie : same comments

Bottom line :
Love the feel of this place . The staff, the casualness of the interiors and the food tried so far , all go hand in hand to make it a place I would love to go back to.

Quirk: the menu does not comes to you, you need to go to it.

USP: they have a very cool Jewellry, crockery and clothing store as well. So while you sip away to glory, you could shop the same time !

The first thing that strikes you about this Cafe is it's decor.... the interiors are aesthetically done with recycled materials... tins of oil made into seat and mosaic tables.... jhuri as lampshades.... with curtains of fairy lights ... it has a carefully careless vibe.... loved the crockery.... hand painted ceramic cups and plates in blue and grey.... adds that right amount of ethnic sophistication. The food was actually beyond expectation.... the meat stuffed bell peppers was amazing... the spicy zingy keema stuffed capsicum topped with cheese and grilled in the oven... the side of jhirjhure aloo bhaja was great!!! The walnut and cinnamon muffin was amazing... so fresh it seemed as if it was right out of the oven.... I like my Darjeeling Aromatic and brewed just for 4-5 mins... the tea was tad over brewed for my taste and liking.... the service is relaxed and the staff friendly.... but then in a place like this one goes with friends for an evening soirée... so the delay is not much of a concern..... loved the place and loved the store.... will definitely go back soon!!!!

Sienna is the calm in the eye of the storm. The food it yummy and and very reasonably priced, the staff courteous, and while they make the food (fresh no reheated crap here) you can browse through the attached boutique (a curious and wonderful collection of cottons dresses, copper jewellery and quirky pottery). My favorites from their menu include the avocado salad, the fired chicken, the pumpkin soup and the humus plater. The food is heathy/wholesome and the desserts are simple but pop with amazing flavours.

Nestled in one of the quieter streets of Hindustan Park, Sienna Store and Café is the new blue boy in town! From hand woven apparel to maatir cha mugs, the boutique store and  has much to offer to the vagabond and the inhabitant alike. Pull a chair, sip into their iced americano, order yourself their ham and cheese quiche and you are good to go. Oh and did I tell you about their backyard which doubles up as the cafe outdoor seating area with AC!!! Goodbye 45 degree Calcutta afternoons.

Located just opposite Byloom boutique and cafe is this quaint and serene place called Sienna Cafe. The door opens into a tasteful boutique and the cafe lies in the backyard of the place. I love the way you walk through the kitchen and place your order before settling down in the comfy backyard. You can have some perfect me-time or meet with your friends for an adda session while you are served everything fresh and hot from the kitchen. The ambience is very homely and peaceful in the little backyard. I loved the seating arrangement, tables and plates done up so artistically with junk materials. It almost invites to do settle down and relax for sometime. I had ordered their Iced Cappuccino and Chocolate cake with ice cream. Food is a bit costly but I loved what I was served. The cake was something I would like to have again and again. The way the coffee was served in a jar looked cute. If you are ready to shell out a little money for a perfect date or adda in a quiet and homely place, go for it.

I wanted to check out the much talked about Sienna Cafe for a while. So I landed up there with a dear friend on a Friday evening finding the place to be tiny and slightly crammed. So we waited for a few people to leave and then settled in. The cafe gives am impression of an outdoor seating but it isn't so. We found the Nerolac cans turned into seats rather uncomfortable. Infact I was accidentally leaning on to someone sitting right behind me for the lack of space. 
Coming to the food. We ordered two cups of Darjeeling tea and a ham and cheese quiche strongly recommended by the staff. The food was served on their own crockery (lovely blue pottery). The Darjeeling tea was perfectly brewed. It came along with you-see-and-miss-it sized homemade muffin. I thought they could have done without that since it looked liked they were cost cutting. Anywhere else a cookie or a small muffin is of a better size. A huge disappointment was the quiche. Over priced at Rs 350, it hardly had any ham. It was more of a spinach and cheese quiche. The accompanying salad too had almost negligible pieces of bacon on white apple.

Located at a quiet corner in Hindustan Park, Sienna Cafe is located behind the store. The seating area is the covered backyard of an old Calcutta house and will be a pleasant sit out under the evening sky. The theme is all blue though I was expecting it to be a little towards brown given its name. The drinks were nice and cooling specially the cucumber celery. The Hummus could have been better; was a little dry in my opinion and the eggplant pretty bland. The Walnut Prostini was quite a find and the walnut spread was pretty unique. Its a nice place to hang out if you are in the area; may not be worth going all the way for the food. Loved the way the menu is displayed on the wall.

A below average place. It looks like they are not done with the decoration which is not the case actually. Coming to the service the waiter was totally clueless what to do or say, was looking totally confused. Coffee was not upto the mark. We ordered one bell pepper item stuffed with minced mutton. That item was okay type but it was so funny to see that they served "jhuri alu bhaja" from some local grocery shop instead of French fries / potato wedges / good quality potato chips. Then came the bill with wrong amout which was also lesser than what it should be. We informed the staff about it. Been there once , will never visit again. 😐

Then came the bill with wrong amout which was also lesser than what it should be. We informed the staff about it. Been there once , will never visit again. 😐

Sienna Cafe is an enjoyable experience overall, but I would like to say that the chicken and cheese sandwich was a disappointment - the filling was nothing remarkable and 200 INR for one toasted, regular sized sandwich is just a bit much. 

Other than that, love the decor and the pesto in the pesto platter was delectable :)

This is a cute cosy cafe inside a boutique. I loved the concept and the decor. The menu is written on blackboards and hung on scrolls. The seating arrangement has a greenhouse feel and they have a nice choice of music playing in the background. Coming to the food, the masala chai is perfect and we had a stuffed capsicum which was good too. The chocolate brownie and specially the cakes with ice cream and strawberry were delicious. I would suggest them to keep some more choice of tea and light finger foods which would be ideal to munch with tea and coffee.

It was a lazy sunday evening. I and my college friend suddenly decided to meet. I wanted to go to a new café and searched this joint out on zomato. It's very close to my place and located near hungry tide just opposite to byloom. The concept is same as byloom. It's a designer apparel  shop where a cafe is there on the backside. The small backyard of the house has been decorated with artificial(i think so) as well as real plants. The roof was covered with translucent sheet and artificial leaves are arranged with small bulbs which looked like thousands of fireflies. The hexagonal table top made up a piece of blue colored tiled floor. Beautiful lampshades are hanging from the ceiling. The chairs were not so comfortable. On the entrance of the café, you will find a gramophone and a wall full of photo frames and books. They have a very unique fashion of menu display. The drinks were written on black board with white chalk and the food items were written on a scroll.
        Coming to the food, we ordered cappuccino, Darjeeling green tea and pesto platter. We were served within 10 minutes. The hot beverages were served with a small piece of plain cake though it looked like a cookie. Both the drinks were good. Platter consisted of fresh brown breads, pesto and sun dried tomato and cheese. I loved it. It was simple and healthy quick snack. 
                   Service was good and price is very reasonable and pocket friendly.

The Sienna cafe is the most pleasant surprise in the Hindustan Park area. Really cool interiors, very friendly staff, great coffee and, of course, fantastic food. 
I'd recommend the fries, the avocado tortilla salad, the bok choy soup and the caramel cup. They also make a great affogato!

Everything here is great. I've tried everything on the menu more than once, and can honestly say it's hard to recommend any one thing. The caramel cup is delightful, the salads, sandwiches and fried chicken are delicious, and their fries are the BEST in town.

I have been a regular patron at Sienna store at Jodhpur Park. So when they opened their new store at Hindustan Park, they naturally invited me. The new thing that is included here is the cafe. When I went towards the cafe, I was pleasantly surprised to find a known face among the staff - from some other popular cafe. He helped me choose my palate. The menu contained healthy food much to my liking.
I was made to sit comfortably at an open space. The cafe claimed to be free wi fi zone, and I saw a man sitting desperately clicking on his tablet. The lights are dim to set the mood. Some indoor plants there. A perfect romantic atmosphere.
Now for the food. First came celery cucumber juice. It is cool and refreshing. Then came egg plant with humus dip. This is something new to my tongue but not bad to taste. In fact, after one or two bites, I started liking it.
I loved this place for their warm and friendly staff and for the healthy and different types of food that they provided.

I loved this place. It has a beautiful dimly lit ambience that gives it that cozy feeling. The food is okay, but better portions would've been better. The whole feel of the place is what makes it unique and different from any other cafe in Kolkata.
