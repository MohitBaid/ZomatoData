Taraknath Mistanna Bhandar is very close to Dhakuriya station. I visited here and tried few of their sweets. The few things that I really liked was the Laddu, Lancha and the Kaju bari. They were very good. I had their Kalojam which I didn't like much.

This local sweet shop is located near Dhakuria railway station, caters the need of local people.

Ambience is ok with quick service.

Their Misti doi is of good quality but other sweets are above average. pocket pinch is less.

Overall above average.

শেষ দিনের রাধাবল্লবি টা এখন ও মুখে লেগে আছে । এক কথায় বলতে গেলে অসাধারন । আর তার পরে রসগোল্লা টা হলে জমে যায় জাস্ট । মিষ্টি দই টা খুব ভালো লেগছে । যত বার সামানে দিয়ে যাই ঢু মেরে যাই ।

Situated near to Dhakuria Railway Station, this is a decent sized sweet shops catering to the local people. Have tried the Radhaballavi here and Mishti Doi to pang my hunger. The Mishti Doi was particularly good and at par with some of the popular brands serving the same in this city. Affordable pricing!

For many years I have bought sweets, samosa, radha ballavi, etc. Especially their rabri is fascinating. The price might seem a bit big but the taste & quantity is worthy. Its located near Dhakuria Railway Station & it has another branch near Nanidar Chayer Dokan.

Being a Bengali I love having sweets whether it's in some occasion or just for no reason as desert. 
This shop is located near Dhakuria railway station and it serves good sweets at a very reasonable price.

My entire family has been a customer of Taraknath for more than 15 years now. Their wide range of sweets, including rasgullas, rajbhogs, kamala bhogs, sandeshes, and the pantua, is a thing to watch out for if you are sweet-tooth. Because you will simply get addicted. The taste, the variety, and the shear talent of making some of the finest sweets mesmerizes me quite extensively.

An usual local sweet shop located near the Dhakuria station is a decent outlet in Tanupukur area near a friend's house. Have got sweets from this shop whenever we had gathering at that friends house. Tried their Misti doi which is quite decent and also other products are average too. An average one.
