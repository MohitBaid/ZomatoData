Sudden plan with friends.. I loved the place. Though while ordering we thought the bowls to be small in but we're satisfied with what we got.
1 Chicken bowl- great taste. The chicken pieces were tiny. Well cooked and sauce was delicious.

2 paneer bowl - there was small pieces of paneer. I liked it. And the noodles were well cooked. There was a good quantity of assorted vegetables.

3 sauted chilli garlic mushroom - best of all the order. Extremely tasty and enough for 2 person

4 pan tossed chicken dimsum - good stuffing and the sause was good.

5 veg steamed dimsum - quite good. The dip given with it was better the dimsums

6 darsan with ice cream - loved it.

P.s.-- you get complementary soft drinks of choice with food.

Interesting concept, the food was average. Really liked the crispy chicken honey chilly.
The place is really small,accomodating  max 5-6 people at a time.

Not what I expected. And they just top it off w sauces and too much of it. Momo was good enough! 2.5 stars is just because of the momo otherwise not that good enough food.

I had
 *chicken noodles with garlic sauce : it was spicy.they prepared it well. Good food in Rs 230.
The only bad thing is the smoke from their kitchen.

Wok 21 is a well lit QSR which serves Asian food. We visited this restaurant on a find Sunday to have some asian food for lunch.
First we tried the pan fried veg momo, it was very well cooked, Wok tossed and topped with the right amount of sauce😋
Next up was the Haka Paneer, and I specially loved this one! It was a bag full of flavours of garlic, ginger, onion! This was a melt in mouth.
Then we had the Crispy Mushrooms, and again was quite impressed, these tasted like mushroom popcorns, the right texture!
Next we tasted the thai flat noodles in garlic and Coriander sauce, which was good but I like noodles a less saucy.
For desserts we had the banana toffee, Darsaan and ice cream. Both were yum and we liked Darsaan better😋
And finally we ended with some fortune cookie, which was really cool concept and new to Kolkata. We have seen these being served as asian restaurant outside Kolkata, but we're quite impressed to see the tradition still be cherished.

One of the best place To visit when you're having a Chinese food craving without much pocket pinch.
This place is a small joint located beside AMRI HOSPITAL sec-3 salt lake , and it exists together in a floor alongside with SUBWAY .
 We ordered :
1 chicken dimsums- 6 pieces of succulent chicken dimsums with 2 dips and trust me the dips are awesome .
2. The customisable bowl - this is their best part , they give you a list from which you can select the ingredients to be added to Ur bowl and the best part is that you can see your food being cooked live in front of you. We ordered flat noodles with chilly oyster sauce and it was delicious , we had enough exotic veggies in our bowl and it only costed ₹250. 

The proportion of the bowl is more than enough to fill a hungry stomach .

A very attractive concept of full meals in bowls with customised toppings.Recently had a very bad craving for Drums of Heaven and since this place opens quite early ordered for a plate of steamed chicken dimsums and Drums of Heaven.
They serve 4 pieces of chicken lollipop for Rs 159 which is a moderate price value.The coating on the pieces were thick but at the same time there were nice plump pieces of chicken lollipop.The sauce was perfect except for the spice level,I would have preferred it a bit more spicy but it was not sweet and ketchupy which I liked.
The dimsum on the other hand for Rs 100 they were 6 nice plump pieces.The stuffing was heavy on garlic and sping onions.The wrapper was quite thin and tightly packed with stuffing.They provide two sauces one peanut based and another tomato basee.I missed the fiery red chilli sauce provided with dimsums though.
I will be trying the bowls soon.

This was my first visit to a Chinese restaurant built over a Mongolian concept, and I simply loved it. You don't get to have unnecessary stuff, just customize it the way you want and you get it cooked right away! Tastes awesome, and we didn't actually expect the quantity to be so heavy! And most importantly, the price - don't think, just go for it. Located just opposite to the salt lake stadium gate no. 3, adjacent to Subway.

I ordered through Swiggy. The quantity of Hakka paneer that was given was 35% of box size although they serve more in dine in at the same price. Pathetic quantity. I would have given the least rating but this is because of the alright quality of food. Taste Is just fine nothing great rather most ordinary. I was so excited when I ordered but now I am very sure not to repeat this error of ordering from here again.

What i liked about their concept is that the menu is quite simple and easy to understand. Also, the prices have been kept reasonable and they serve the food absolutely smoky hot which is still lacking in many places in the city of joy.

Went there with zero expectations as the outlet has no menu card uploaded in zomato. Me and my partner were super hungry and yet we were unsure of the place,but it was a good decision to visit it as our tummies were filled and our taste buds satisfied. We ordered only a plate of Salt and Pepper Chicken and the dish was spicy as well as tasty. As we went there late not much was available but the single plate of chicken proved useful for the time being. Would love to visit the outlet again at a time when other dishes would be available.

Not much spacious...but serves great food.
Their items arent wide..they have got momos..few chinese dishes and their speciality customizable veg and non-veg bowls..where you can select the base veggies..protein..toppings..type of noodle/rice...from a list of options selecting your choice like an mcq.
I loved the sauce that they served with the momo..and simply loved the non-veg bowl.
No complaints about the place except for the little space..which is still okay but too many flies flying around you and your food is pretty annoying.
1 mark deducted solely for the flies.👎

Located in front of Salt Lake stadium or Stadel, Wok 21 is a self service oriental restaurant that is not very pricey and has a good menu. Lots of ingredients to choose from, is what I loved but had a mixed experience with the food.

Crispy chilli babycorn was lovely and portion size huge. Veg dimsums were pretty nice as well. Main course involves getting your bowl of rice or noodle made in your choice of veggies, protein and sauce out of quite a long list, and most of which are available surprisingly. I got a bowl of rice made with tofu and my choice of veggies in black bean sauce. But black bean sauce was a major let down and I did not like it. However noodles in butter garlic tasted good. 

Overall, a decent hit and run joint for quick,  decent food at decent prices. Let down was ambiance, trays that seemed dirty and sticky, and black bean sauce.

Tried this joint today , right opposite Salt Lake stadium gate 3 . They have momo, some starters and noodle bowls where you can make your own bowl with ingredients of your choice. 
The chili garlic sauce we tried with our flat noodles was spicy and not very flavourful. The ingredients or the taste in general was okay, didn't quite stand out. 
We took pan fried momos which to my disappointment was not properly tossed, just fried and then some gravy put on top. The gravy however tasted pretty good. The peanut sauce with the momo was a disaster.

Quick, quality food at a very pocket friendly price - the quintessential Chinese outlet which will always live up to your expectations.

Wok 21 is a great 2.1 for me, for the grace of managing to do what it does. Wonderful idea wise, failure execution wise. Chilli Baby corn was absolutely insipid. Then, came pad thai in Chilli Oyster Choice, it was no better. They ask you to opt a lot of things, I bet you will not find more than two pieces of anything. The only relief, they don't take much time to deliver or serve. If you are very hungry and can do with average food, may be you can go there. Otherwise, my suggestion, try subway, it's just two steps away. My friends ordered chicken and Prawn and chicken was stale, Prawn was just average. The main course was so spicy, that we ended up having 2 fountain Pepsi each. All in all, average place, average ambience, but Value for money!

Location : Salt Lake sector III, behind Salt Lake Stadium.

This is a subsidiary outlet of the Subway and it is also attached with the subway only. Ambiance is not big but they have small sittings for the people walking in. Staff here are very friendly here and cooperative as well. Talking about the place so they have a small menu with some lip smacking stuffs. 
They offer vegetarian and non vegetarian in forms of Starter, Dimsums, beverages and Desserts.

They have got quite exotic items in their menu but we chose few from them. 
Started from the Veg one
Chicken Dimsum : Softly Coated and had the number of minced chicken in it. 

Prawn Salt and pepper : Prawn has always been my favorite and when your favorite is being made this good then their cant be any complaints. Hint of Salt and pepper and fried to perfection, even the garnishing was done well.

Choose you Bowl : This concept is really interesting where they provide you with a leaflet that contains names of ingredients and from that you need to customize your own bowl.
I chose my Bowl with:
Spring onion
American Corn
yellow bell Pepper
Prawn
Egg
White Rice
Chilli Oyster
Fried Onions.

These were my selections and they made it ready in mins of time in front of me. tasted brilliant and loved each and every spoon of it.
The experience was wonderful and the staff and the owner was very courteous.

Wok 21 is located nearly to broadway road petrol pump and they share the Sector 3 Subway joint in one place.

Ambiance is good and funky. The idea of making your own food is good. Nowadays its very popular among cafés and restaurants.

Similarly you can make your rice or noodles from scratch in here.

I had Crispy chilli baby corn, chicken salt and pepper and crispy prawn salt and pepper in starters.
Also I had Chicken Steamed Dimsum. All the item is fresh, good and tasty.

Then I made my own Rice with the help of thier small form they had. You just have to tick the iten u want in your rice or noodles.

From dessert I had darsans with vanilla Ice cream and Fortune cookies (litte message written under the cookies when you break it)

Quantity and quality is very good.. Pocket friendly also... Loved it.

Lovely place with some scrumptious food! 

Because every wok tells a story..........

WOK 21 is something that has been fast tracked because of my new found fondness for Chinese cuisine. It's situated at 15, Block JC 21, Near AMRI Hospital. 

The Decor was looks like Chinese themes with lovely posters. 

The menu is a wonderful mix of Chinese dishes. The service was pretty fast,

We tried the following on our visit there :

Veg Starters:

1) Crispy chilli baby corn : This dish is loved by everyone equally for its tangy crispy feel. The baby corns are shallow fried along with various sauces used in Chinese cuisine to make thick gravy that is enough to coat the fried baby corns. 

2) Crispy Konjenaro: One of my favorite chinese dish. This is a crispy, crunchy and a dry version of chinese konjenaro.

Non-Veg Starters:

1) Chicken Salt and Pepper:
If you've ever asked for salt and pepper chicken from this restu, you know it tastes absolutely amazing.

2) Chicken Steamed Dimsums:
Chicken Momos are popular in the whole world now, in Asia they are also known as Dimsums at times. But this chinese steamed dimsums is awesome and so yummy.

3) Crispy Prawn Salt and Pepper: 
Crispy, salty, slightly spicy but it's too good.

Main Course: 

One more things I need to say
In main course foods, they do have a fun MCQ type ordering pattern. So,you can tick the items you want and hand it over to the waiter.

We've ordered many dishes like hakka noodles, white rice to brown rice. Its tasted absolutely good.

Now, Coming to the Desserts,

1) Darshan with Ice Cream: 
Crispy fried noodles drizzled with honey is a hot and cold combination which served with a nice dollop of vanilla ice-cream.

2) Toffee Banana with Ice Cream: 
Slices of banana are battered and deep-fried, then coated in toffee served with vanilla ice cream scoops.

3) Fortune Cookies:
Hope you know what is fortune cookies. :P 
This crisp cookie with a piece of paper inside a "fortune" :D

Overall,it's good and awesome. Will definitely visit this place again.

So go ahead, gather your friends and family and head to Wok 21.

Location : Salt Lake sector III, behind Salt Lake Stadium.

This is a subsidiary outlet of the Subway and it is also attached with the subway only. Ambiance is not big but they have small sittings for the people walking in. Staff here are very friendly here and cooperative as well. Talking about the place so they have a small menu with some lip smacking stuffs. 
They offer vegetarian and non vegetarian in forms of Starter, Dimsums, beverages and Desserts.

They have got quite exotic items in their menu but we chose few from them. 
Started from the Veg one
Chicken Dimsum : Softly Coated and had the number of minced chicken in it. 

Prawn Salt and pepper : Prawn has always been my favorite and when your favorite is being made this good then their cant be any complaints. Hint of Salt and pepper and fried to perfection, even the garnishing was done well.

Choose you Bowl : This concept is really interesting where they provide you with a leaflet that contains names of ingredients and from that you need to customize your own bowl.
I chose my Bowl with:
Spring onion
American Corn
yellow bell Pepper
Prawn
Egg
White Rice
Chilli Oyster
Fried Onions.

These were my selections and they made it ready in mins of time in front of me. tasted brilliant and loved each and every spoon of it.
The experience was wonderful and the staff and the owner was very courteous.

A newbie but good place to try out. Service & food quality is good & taste is great too. Carry a pen since you have to fill up a questionnaire kind of menu with your choices! Seating capacity is remarkably low & that too is shared with adjacent Subway. Overall decent experience.

Location : Right next to the Subway, one island away from Carnival cinemas.

Stopped by for a quick meal.

Food ordered :

*Chicken salt and pepper : It was good.

* Chicken dumplings : It was served fresh and steaming hot and was very good as well.

* noodle Bowl : you get options to choose your own base, veggies, exotic veggies, protein, sauce and toppings. I made my own bowl and was pretty happy with the outcome.

This is a great option in sector 3 if you want to grab a quick meal on the go.

This is a small joint situated near the AMRI hospital. It has its space shared with subway. What truly makes this food stand out is its unique concept. The fact that the food is so highly customizable is absolutely amazing.
                We ordered soft drinks, Crispy Chilly Babycorn, Chicken Salt and Pepper, Chicken Steamed dimsum, Crispy Prawn salt and Pepper. We tried out the customizable bowl in the main course. There were a lot of options to choose from in veggies, proteins, noodles or rice, the kind of sauce etc. They have an open kitchen and seeing them make exactly what we wanted made from scratch is an absolute delight. The bowl was simply lip smacking and would bring absolute delight to all. The quantity was great too.

FINAL VERDICT- This is an absolute must visit place with a marvellous concept. Do give it a try for some superb chinese delicacies, you would not be disappointed.

A good new outlet where you get what you want. Been there a couple of times and every time the food is quite good. They have an option of ordering as per your choice, choice of vegetables, choice of meat, choice of noodles, brown rice, rice, proteins,sauces and other condiments where you need to write in their menu paper. 
Order is prepared live and takes around 10 minutes to serve. 
Overall taste is very good. Quantity is well balanced as per rates. Must try.

Ordered a non veg wok bowl and an American corn pepper salt from here. The corn pepper salt was cooked well , tasting good and having adequate quantity. The wok bowl was cooked in schezwan sauce and tasted okay. I think the wok bowl could have been better. The ingredients and sauce tasted alright.

Ordered their non veg wok bowl via Swiggy. The fact that you can choose your own veggie basics, or exotic veggies, healthy protein, base , sauce and garnishes was really unique and interesting. You get quite good options and can customize the bowl accordingly. The food was okay-ish. Looking forward to try their dimsums.

Previously this place was yogurt parlour. (Frozen yogurt)  . It is located beside Ami hospital. This shop is sharing it's space with subway. It's a Small place with delicious food. However food was very spicy and they did not serve dessert as well, so faced a bit trouble. We ordered dumplings (steamed and pan fied) and crispy honey chilli chicken . Overall experience was good.

Wok21🍳, situated opposite The Stadel in Salt Lake is a new and creative venture. I went there yesterday and ordered a veg momo and I have to be frank, it was the tastiest I had tasted in Kolkata. 
Being from Port Blair, I never really had the opportunity to relish such tasty delicacies and it was a wonderful experience. 
I would be glad if some venture of this sort opens up at Port Blair as well.

I visited Wok 21 yesterday with my friend. It is located in the same location as Subway, opposite SAI complex, near Big Bazaar in Sector 3, Salt Lake. They have a fun MCQ type ordering pattern wherein a paper menu and pen is handed over to you. You can tick the items you want and hand it over to the waiter or to the kitchen. It is an open kitchen so you can see them putting your food together.
They have veg and non veg starters and dimsums. The beverages and desserts were not available when I visited them.
My friend and I ordered the chicken fried dimsum which was served with peanut sauce. The dimsum was stuffed with meat and had a nice texture. The grainy texture of the peanut sauce went well with the dimsums.
Next we ordered the non veg bowl. One side of the menu is dedicated to the bowls. You can choose 5 common veggies, 2 exotic veggies, 1 protein, rice/noodles, 1 sauce and 3 toppings. We chose flat noodles with chicken and hot garlic sauce. There was sufficient food for the two of us (we had already had some snacks before arriving). The food tasted fresh and flavourful. There was a good amount of chicken and veggies. The sauce coated the noodles evenly which added to the experience. My friend even took one noodle bowl back home.
I noticed that they have many sauces on offer, divided into mild, spicy and very spicy categories.
Looking forward to trying out the other available combinations.
I hope they start offering extra chillies as a topping too!

I went back again to try their brown rice bowl with chilli oyster sauce. It was yummy with great textural variation which made the dining experience really good.

I have also tried the hakka noodles bowl in hot garlic sauce with soya chunks which I shared with my vegetarian friend. It is quite a wholesome option for vegetarians. Both my friend and I (a non vegetarian) quite enjoyed the food and it filled our stomachs well.

I visited WOK21 during its opening, and I have to admit, I came out impressed. Situated beside Subway in sector 3 opposite Salt Lake stadium, WOK21 seems to be a winner. The system is different from your typical Chinese restaurants. The signature meal is your noodle or rice bowl which is reminiscent of Mama Goto. You choose your bowl combo by ticking your choices from the menu card itself. I had a bowl, and have to admit, it was very good. The choices itself would leave a customer spoiled. Do try your own version.
Apart from the Chinese bowl I must recommend the fried Dimsums as well. The Dimsums, served alongside peanut sauce and chilly sauce leaves a person wanting for more. In fact, I felt that the quantity should be increased a bit, but given the pricing, I will say the quantity served is sufficient. Post tax per head cost should be about Rs400.
1 area of complaint is that there were way too many mosquitoes there, and management should focus on the same.

Went on the opening day of this outlet. The veg momos were excellent. It is located adjacent to the Subway Sector 3. Though not spacious enough, this outlet has various items. At the very first day they did not have the card swiping machine and I was short in cash, so couldn't have any thing other than momo. I wish to visit again to consume the rest of the items..
