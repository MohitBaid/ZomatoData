All the products were fresh and the dishes had the warmth of home-made food. The chefs take great care in selecting the best quality ingredients. I can assure it is more than value for money.

It was a great experience at Nh2 food Junction, It is perfect for family, friends to enjoy the quality foods at reasonable price, the taste is awesome, ambiance is very nice, ample of space, good management, highly cleaned. You will get different kind of foods under the same roof. For the local people ... an alternative to Park street. A must try restaurant.

Food here is pretty Good. The biriyani and Kebabs are splendid. Besides these, the tandoori seems like another good choice. They have the ability to make your mouth water and enjoy the essence of a typical plate of tandoori chicken. All in all it is a place you should definitely try out.

Awesome dining experience...I frequently visit this outlet for dinner and take away...The speciality of this food junction is they provide a huge range of food from dosa to biryani....Also they keep up with the quality for large scale orders...I have given them order for a party of 50 people and they overdid my expectation...

Had been to this outlet for the first time a few days back while driving through the N.H. Its a tidy, spacious eatery, one of it's kind in the vicinity. Let me point out the pro's -
1. Ample parking space (A must in these times)
2. Refreshing aesthetics.
3. Cleanliness - Pristine
4. Attentive and polite stewards
5. Wide spectrum of cuisines 
6. Quick service of food.
7. Even though the cuisine spread is wide, they try to stick to the authenticity of the recipes. 
8. a.Food quality - Excellent. b.Taste - Very Good (as taste varies from person to person). c. Portion size - Optimized. d.Suggestive selling - Good

Cons - Nothing much to be noticeable in my first visit. If they continue the good work, I do not see any reasons for them to develop any. 

Kudos...Keep up the good work.
