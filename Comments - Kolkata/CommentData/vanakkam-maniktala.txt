Granted some of the items on the menu either were unavailable or would've taken a substantial amount of time to make (we were told), Vanakkam still remains a classic and a childhood favourite. There is little that they serve up but they do it well - very well.

Crispy dosa, fluffy idli, extra fried uttapam and the thick chutney! Spot on.

It is renowned for your south Indian food. It is pocket friendly. Food lovers must visit there. Masala dhosa, uthapam, idly are really awesome there.

Yes yes .. Of course I went with my buddhimoti but my parents too joined us .. We tried idli and masala dosa .. Looks can be deceptive .  he he he .. Interiors may not be eye striking but the food doesnot fail to strike the tongue .. Idlis are soft and good enough in size and yeah masala of the dosa was awesome .. I wish they add one extra dhaniya or onion chutney .. To maza aa jayega ..namaskar to vanakkam .

Used to be my weekly dine-in place between 2002-2004. A simple looking restaurant, on the way towards Manicktala, the Dosas here, were to die for. The size of the Masala Dosa was enough to fill my hungry appetite. To top it all, I particularly liked the Sambhar here. Hopefully, the quality has been retained, and not been done away with.

Its my favourite restaurant when Durga puja arrives as they serve pure veg food. Quality and taste is just great. Though it becomes tough to sit n eat as the place is not that big.

This is a hidden gem if you are a South Indian veg food lover. It is near Maniktala crossing. From the crossing keep moving towards Circular Canal / Kakurgachhi. Just after crossing Raja Dinendra Street, Vanakkam will be on your right after few meters. It is a blink and you miss eatery. So keep your eyes open.

The seating is very basic. Though the menu says AC restaurant (and I saw an AC inside), it will be the fans you will have to keep yourself cool with. Service is friendly, but a bit slow. 

Ordered a plate of veg pulao with alu dom. The quantity of rice was good (more than enough for a normal eater) and it was a real pulao, and not fried rice. There were plenty of veggies and nuts and raisins. Taste was good too. The Aloo Dom was not dry. The spicy, rich and flavourful gravy went well with the pulao. There were two big potatoes. There were also a bowl of raita and a papad. The raita curd was a bit sweetish, but tastes nice. It was thick and there were onions, tomatoes and cucumbers in it. 

The mixed sada dosa was huge and was fried with onions, tomatoes and capsicum. It tasted great. The sambhar was one of the best in the city and the chutney came with a tadka of red chilli and dals. Few places serve like this. 

The prices look a bit high, but the two dishes I tried completely justified the price with the quality and quantity.

If you are around and love South Indian veg, you should not miss this place.

This restaurant is related to my childhood memory. My grandma was a cancer patient. She was admitted in a nearby nursing home. When we came to visit grandma, we had to had our lunch outside as our home was almost 100 k.m. from Maniktala. So everytime we chose this restaurant. I have tasted almost all their dishes like uttapam,vada, idli, pizza, chaat, pulao everything. An authentic south indian pure vegetarian restaurant. After my grandma's death it has been 12 yrs now, we never get a chance to visit this place again.

Pure south indian cuisine. Great taste of masala dosa with sambhar/rasam and chatni. Price was also not high. Idli, vada, uttapam all are tastes like we're eating in chennai. Highly recommended to all south indian cuisine lover.

It has excellent food and quite good service. However it has poor interior decoration and the overall persona is not good. In all it is good for money restaurant when you are a compulsory vegetarian.

Vanakkam is one such quaint place which quietly serves nice South Indian food, right in between the city. Located conveniently near Manicktala junction, you're sure to miss this place if you're walking/driving out in a jiffy. Nothing fancy about the exteriors or there interiors but the food was served up with a lot of zest. The staff are polite and so not necessarily badger over you to make a quick menu decision!
The coffee was a pure pleasure given the fact that it was a typical rainy Kolkata evening. Beautiful taste and just the right balance to set out the tone for the Masala Vada. Rava Masala Dosa and Masala Dosa. I felt the Vada could've been done better in terms of texture as the batter seemed pretty tight and the Vada heavy. Rava Onion Masala Dosa was very very tasty which the crunchy Onion bits and a typical bland-ish South Indian aloo masala filling.
Pro tip: go with an open mind, sans plush decor finicky stuff and you'll settle into the dosa in no time!

It is a simple south indian restaurant. Average space with AC and nothing special but its dosas, idlis, uttapams are quit nice. Service is for just to provide the dosa plate on your table, don't except much from service department.

It was raining heavily. So me and my friend decided we should take in shelter somewhere nearby. It was maniktala and no proper caf√©s around we decided to jump in to the nearest one. And there was vanakkam beside arambagh. On entering what we saw was a simple table chair arrangement. And I was moreose. No proper ambience. People chattering.  And the worst part, it only served south indian delicacies. And I am not much of a fan of south indian. A sunday and an overcrowded eatery is synonymous.  So the waiters were hurrying and we were just trying to avoid the rain. So ordered something simple. Cold drinks because cold coffee was not available.  And of course a rava dosa for my friend and an idly for myself. The food came in. It was served hot and fresh. And it tasted amazing. Could not have expected such good food at such a dingy place. The bill was dirt cheap. So definitely it is a heavenly affair for the south indian lovers.
