We had picked up chicken biriyani from this place on a really hungry afternoon. I must say that the biriyani was really nice with a handsome quantity. Thumbs up. üëç

Spicy Kolkata is located infront of Lake Mall. I took their Chicken Biryani as parcel today after a movie at Cinepolis. The Chicken Biryani was definitely worthy of Rs.140. The quantity was huge, I had to struggle to complete it. The chicken piece was good in size.

We picked up Mutton Biryani and Chicken Chap during the Pujas , both were sumptuous and reasonably priced. The owner and the staff were very welcoming. High recommendation from my side.

Ok so i m the 1st one to review. 
One fine afternoon i took a parcel from this place. Mutton biriyani. Which was yum. They do provide a lot of quantity in the box. Two people can easily eat it. 
Though definately not like shiraz or arsalan or aminiya, but this place is a must recommended place.
