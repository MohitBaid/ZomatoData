Newly opened food joint in Thakurpukur area near 3A bus stand...I ordered a take away...Fried rice hot garlic chicken and egg noodles,coming to quantity,one plate of noodles was good enough for one and a half.Quantity of rice was good enough for two.Hot garlic chicken was hot n tasty.One thing I didn't found right was that they charged extra 10 inr for two plastic container.I have ordered for parcels from many eateries but none charged extra bucks for the container...I would rather say this is unfair.But quality n quantity both were good,this place has seating arrangements also.
