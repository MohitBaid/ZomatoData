Firstly, fantastic packaging .... The lookout for minute details such as chutney container and packaging for papad is commendable. Taste-wise, pretty good, but a slight increase in quantity will be appreciated. 

Overall, good ...

So cute packaging. It came with a reusable bag, very thoughtfully placed over a sturdy cardboard. Absolutely spill proof. On time delivery.
The food is pure comfort. Just like mother's cooking.I am tired of regularly eating out so ordered for some good old Sheddo Bhaat and Aloo Bhaja. They also gave sweet tomato chutney, papad and a wooden spoon. Loved the food experience.

Just awesome.
Wow.

Ms. Madhu Kandoi the owner was so humble and so cooperative with touch of mother care is rocking the place.
The food was awesome, full of taste and the hygiene is best. The packing was another attraction and it's really really very nice.
We had the opportunity to have the hot cooked Aachari Khichdi, Salad Khichdi and Baked Khichdi along with tomato chutny, papad and Alu Tug and supported with delicious Payesh.

In one line if you missed the opportunity to have this food you have missed the taste of great and best food ever. Just order and make sure to eat it hot. Turnkeyy gives the gaurenty If you don't like the food we will pay on your behalf.

Many best wishes to Madam Kandoi and team. Khichdi Khichdi rocks. Great Goingüëç

Sincerely with Best Regards,

This place is every Kolkatabashi's favourite in rainy season ! The khichri you didn't want to/ couldn't be lazier to make will be served straight to your home , thanks to this restaurant. The khichri is served in an aluminium foil , and they provide a complimentary spoon and chutney with it , so you can enjoy your khichri in peace. Maa's khichri has curry leaves and a hint of ghee in it , and makes you oh so comfortable on a rainy day. The taste is very homely , so you might end up missing your family too , if you're away! Do try this place for its interesting flavours in khichri ; for all you Desi food lovers , this place is a must try !

Khichdi this word is well known specially among bengali. Being a bong thought of trying khichdi today from "Khichdi Khichri". We opted for online order and ordered "Bhoger Khichdi" and within 45 minutes got my khichdi in hand. Taste of the Khichdi was simply awesome ,all ingredients was well cooked, taste bit spicy along with u'll get papad and chutney,taste of the chutney was also good,overall good experience. We ordered again from Khichdi Khichri this time i tried their "mass khichdi" it was ok in taste and also tried again their "bhoger khichdi" along with aloo bhaja "bhoger khichri" was good but the aloo bhaja was dry and quantity was not enough but the tomato khejurer chatney was really nice.

I was searching today for an outlet that delivers my most favourite dish which is hardly available anywhere, that is Khichuri in bengali. Accidentally found it through Zomato and they agreed to deliver at Salt Lake. We had Bhog'er Khichuri added with Labra and Alubhaja. The food was superb, pocket friendly and to our delight not oily or too spicy. Even we were served roasted Papad and Mango Chutney as complimentary items. The monsoon rain outside might have added some more taste! Wish to be a regular customer.

The name itself is so interesting that out of curiosity decided to order. Was pleasantly surprised with the variety of khichdi they had on their menu.
Ordered a few of them to try out which was the best and found that the Bhoger Khichri was the winner. Aloo chokha was also good along with the Aloo Dum. But the aloo was a bit hard. The Bisibileybhaath was also quite tasty if u like the sour taste. The onion & tomato chutneys were good. Labra was ordinary.

The containers deserve a special mention. It's a nice touch.

Complimentary chutney was good in taste. But the quantity ma'am can be improved. The payesh amount was just two teaspoons!!

I travel to Kolkata every month for two days for work and being a foodie i love to explore the awesome food in this city of joy!!

This time when i was travelling i had a broken foot and i was taking  alot of medicines and therefore wanted to eat something sober and healthy! So Zomato gave me this option of Khichdi Khichri.. I was so delighted to the read the reviews and after i saw the menu i wanted to eat everything they had!

Believe me it took me 15 min to decide my food.  I called  Khichdi and placed my order. The lady on the call helped me chosing their best!!

Food came absolute hot in 30 minutes of time.   Home delivery in earthen pots no plastic all organic stuff.. i was like wow.. she also sent me mattha in a steel flask .. 

The food was excellent!!! This is gonna be my meal one time for sure everytime i come to Kolkata!!

LOVED IT ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

Khichdi Khichri unusual sounding name but conveying the exact meaning. Sometimes, you are bored of rice, roti and non-veg, then you think of something light and healthy. Khichri prepared by Mummy is the first thing to come to your mind but where to find that in the restaurants. This food joint which is only for delivery provides the exact replacement of the Mumma's khichri.
I have got to know about it while using Zomato, though they accepted only offline order at that time but food came in 1 hour 10 minutes. I ordered veg. masala khichdi and mixed raita. The packing was top notch with khichdi in big earth pot perfectly insulated with leaf and foil. mixed raita and tomato chutney were too in the earthen pot with plastic packing and papad was complimentary along with it. Now coming to taste, the khichdi was nicely cooked with some fried vegetables like carrot, beans, etc in the khichdi ¬†and also tastes nice but ghee could add some more flavor along with a little salt put into it. The mixed raita was little sweet but tasty and tomato chutney was good too. The taste of khichdi can be made little better, apart from it everything is top notch and healthy. Looking forward to order again.
Thank You!!

Dates of Tasting: Mar 2017, Apr 2017

Apr 2017:
Summer-time, Healthy and Day-to-day Food @ Khichdi Khichri, Kolkata ‚ò∫

Sprouts, Poha, Upma etc. are the vegetarian light foods that comprise the breakfast table of most of the vegetarian households. Old people and the ones on diet, also prefer the same over Roti or Rice, specially for dinner.

Resultantly, in the event of long absence of the lady of the house and/or the cook, these are the items, that people tend to miss direly after the first couple of days of the aforesaid personnel's departure. Even when they are able to spruce up a basic and bland Dal-Chawal or Khichdi for themselves, their craving for a decent Punjabi Kadhi with Chawal stays unattended. During the sumners, similarl fate happens to their need of the mandatory mango based desserts, which they are so used to consume on a daily basis, in the form of - Aamras, Mango Lassi, Mango Shrikhand etc.

Spicy, oily and fried foods have always been easily available. Home made tiffins comprising of sabji-roti, dal-chawal etc. are easily available of late. But, it's quite difficult to find the afore mentioned daily and seasonal food items at reasonable price.

Thus, when recently Khichdi Khichri sent me two hefty hampers comprising of these very items and a few more for tasting, I felt like shrieking Eureka!

As I have already mentioned in my earlier article (https://goo.gl/HVe5kS) -

"Khichdi Khichri's all veg menu lists - around 13 Khichdi options, 4 Rice options, Upma, Onion Poha, 3 Desserts and a host of Accompaniments comprising of chutneys, sabjis, raitas, salads and papad."

The food hampers comprised of - neatly packed edibles in small bowls (sikora) and medium sized lidded bowls (handi), throwable cane spoons and tissue papers. The food items present therein, comprised of -

- Main Course -

- Salad Khichdi (Rs. 150/-): Packed in a lidded handi, it was a healthy and wholesome meal comprising of boiled red rice, sprouts and lots of finely chopped salad vegetables. A slice of lime also came placed on the top. The dish tasted crunchy and nice.

- Onion Poha (Rs. 100/-): Packed in a lidded handi and infused with curry leaves and peanuts, this flattened rice based preparation was much darker in color than the one we prepare at home. It tasted fine, but kind of contained too much of chopped and sauted onions for my taste. But then, it was just living upto it's name of being Onion Poha, while at home, we mostly make Aloo (potato) Poha, Matar (Peas) Poha or Mixed Veg (carrot and french beans) Poha.

- Upma (Rs. 80/-): Packed in a liddes handi and infused with relatively bigger pieces of carrots and beans, it was the dry version of the usually moist Upma. Personally, I like the dry version, so I really relished consuming it. Thankfully, the ghee (clarified butter) content was quite low.

- Pakodi Ki Kadhi: (Rs. 60/-): Packed in an aluminium foil box, the Punjabi Kadhi was tempered with a generous portion of curry leaves and dried red chillies. Both the pakodis i.e. fried gram flour dumplings and kadhi i.e. gram flour and curd based gravy were well made and tasted as good as homemade. The dish tasted very nice.

- Condiment & Chutney -

- Mango Chutney, Pachadi, Khejur Chutney, Tomato Thokku (Rs. 30/- each): An assortment of 4 different chutneys came packed in small clay bowls or bhaands or sikoras. Each of them tasted authentic. My personal favourite was Mango Chutney. It was well made, scantily spiced, tangy and quite addictive in taste.

- Dessert -

- Kesariya Meetha Bhaat (Rs. 150/-): Infused with cashews and raisins, the saffron flavored and yellow hued rice grains based sweet dish came neatly packed in a lidded handi. The dessert was well cooked and tasted nice. This being a quintessential household dessert and connected with popular festivals like Basant Panchami etc., who would have ever thought that one day it would be available for purchase.

Such availability is a great booster for folks who have shifted base out of their respective native towns and are yet to learn cooking or get hold of someone who already knows cooking. Consuming festival specific 'bhog' or item, makes one feel closer to home and not abandoned.

- Paayesh (Rs. 60/-): This was the usual Bengali style rice and milk pudding, sweetened by a generous mix of jaggery. It also came packed in a sikora and tasted very nice. 

- Mango Special (Rs. 80/-): Packed in a sikora, it was basically thick and creamy Aamras containing uniformly cut mango chunks and some saffron. It tasted excellent.

The amount of food that arrived was quite sufficient for 5-6 people.

This one is for the vegetarian gentlemen - Next time your wife goes 'mayke' or your cook goes to his 'desh', 'fikar' not, just call or order online to get delivered light and freshly cooked comfort food at your doorstep!

It's Raining Khichdi @ Khichdi Khichri, Kolkata ‚ò∫

When it comes to health food, we all seem to have fixated upon - super foods, low fat dairy products, detox juices, protein bars etc. These food products - were not a part of our growing up, are not widely available and cost relatively high.

In the current age health food entrapment, we seem to have forgotten our age old and humble Khichdi, the mother of all health foods, a simple rice and dal porridge, which in it's simplest form, can be cooked with just some salt, turmeric powder and water, and it would provide your body, the necessary carbohydrate, protein and antiseptic agent! Needless to say, that it's quite light on the stomach and tastes nice, both with and without accompaniments.

Beliaghata based Khichdi Khichri seems to be the only food service in the city, providing this wonderful food item, in it's myriad avatars to the door steps of it's patrons. Theirs is a cent percent home delivery model. Their is no sit and dine option.

Khichdi Khichri's all veg menu lists - around 13 Khichdi options, 4 Rice options, Upma, Onion Poha, 3 Desserts and a host of Accompaniments comprising of chutneys, sabjis, raitas, salads and papad.

The Khichdi options are - Palak, Tamatar, Achari, Himachali, Salad, Maa's, Niramish, Amish, Sabudana, Vegetable Masala, Bhog'er, Ven Pongal and Bisibilebhaath.

We used the Swiggy App to order the following -

- Amish Khichdi (Rs. 120/-): It was the Bengali style masoor dal khichdi, made with onion, garlic and whole spices. It was topped with coriander stems. It came accompanied with papad and mixed pickle.

The khichdi was well cooked, but little spicy for our taste. The quantity provided was more than enough for one person. Papad was roasted and relatively smaller in portion. Mixed pickle was store bought, but still tasted better than the ones you get in most of the restaurants.

- Kasundi Raita Rs. (50/-): It was a lovely mustard flavored yoghurt, that came packed in a 'kulhar' i.e. small earthen cup, commonly used for serving tea. It tasted very nice.

- Labra Rs. (60/-): This popular mixed veg of Bengali cuisine, which supposedly gels well with khichri, came packed in an aluminium foil container. It was mildly spiced and little oily. It tasted nice.

- Moong Dal Payasam (Rs. 60/-): This moong dal, jaggery and milk based dessert came packed in an earthen bowl. It was garnished with a couple of raisins at the centre.

To be honest, we are more tuned to moong dal based sweet delicacies like - halwa, pinni etc. So, this payasam was kind of an experiment. It tasted average.

The entire meal came packed in a monogrammed paper bag. In general the whole packaging was environment friendly. Most of the food items were packed in earthen vessels, including the Khichdi, whose containing pot's open mouth was covered with dry leaves, put together in place with a wrapped up and knotted twine.

Prices specified in the Swiggy menu were all inclusive. No additional taxes were charged in the total bill.

So, if you are in the mood for light desi food, or just want to try a new variation of Khichdi, then Khichdi Khichri is your goto place.

Note: It was a paid meal, not a tasting session.

Ordered bhoger khichri,amish khichri and lemon rice , all 3 were awesome. The presentation of the food will make you order it again and again, cute earthen pots and yummy authentic food !! Great job and keep it up. The portion was absolutely right and the taste was perfect and delivered timely . Thanks for giving us such a new concept !!

Heard about this little joint from a friend of mine. Their menu was pleasantly surprising. I guess one can easily say that they are the only once delivering khichuri and other similar kinds of food around in our city. I ordered for a few plates of khichri on a rainy day since everyone at work was craving it. The order arrived a little late but it was worth the wait. We received khichri in a pretty earthen little pot, with some achaar and papad to go with it and chutney for us to have an happy ending with. All this just for 60 bucks (plus delivery charges). I am happy that they obliged to deliver on such a rainy day and covered quite a distance. (metropolitan to southern avenue). Would definitely go back to them again, whether it rains or not!

Concept and the way of delivering the food is good. Jute bag, clay pots, its a good concept all together. But the taste and quantity have to be better. They should rethink about this two. Instead of using plain boil rice they could have used traditional gobinda Vog rice. It could have increased the taste multiple times. Secondly the quantity is very less. Normal adult person would need minimun of two plate to fill their appetite. Khichuri is a traditional Bengali food which we Bengali's are loved to have anytime. So folks you have brought a good concept but their is scope of a lot of improvement.

We had ordered for 4 types of Khichdis : Ma's,Bhoger,Tomato and Achari with Aloo Chokha,Tuk,Dum n Labda as accompaniments.The pickles and papad were offered complimentary.

Good food should appeal from the moment you get to see them being served.In this case from the time it is being delivered.Yes,am talking about packaging.Very neatly done in earthen pots n jute bags.The accompaniments came in foils though.

Food : Flavourful,distinct feel of spices,fresh
vegetables used,mild n easy on stomach.Aloo chokha and labda were just perfect n must haves.Aloo dum and tuk were pretty average.

On certain days when you wish to have simple,satvik food just dial in for a satisfying experience.

This is an only delivery place and serves some of the best khichdi. Going by it's name, they only serve khichdi and other rice dishes, along with accompaniments like chutneys , achar, papad and desserts. I ordered the himachali khichdi and the aloo dum. With that I also ordered onion pachhadi. The presentation of the food was beautiful and gave a very earthy feel to it. The food was packed in a jute bag, and the khichdi and chutney were served on separate earthen vessels, complete with a lid and dry leaves. A wooden spoon was there too. 
Coming to the khichdi, it was well cooked. The quality of rice that they used was very superior, as it they were long and plump grains of rice, cooked in various spices that played with your tastebuds. Boiled rajma added another texture to the dish. If you order one portion, it's enough for one person. It had a bit of excess oil in it but was totally worth it. The aloo dum was good too, just like it's made in common Bengali households, with a lovely gravy. 
What I loved was the onion chutney. It was sweet and tangy and there was ajwain in it too. Along with the khichdi it tasted amazing. The onions used were so finely mashed and ground into a paste that it was very homogenous, both in appearance and taste. 
This place has no scope for any negative comments yet. It's a must try for all khichdi lovers.

If you live alone, and are craving some serious home-style comfort, look no further. As a delivery - only place, Khichdi Khichri does an outstanding job of bringing a restaurant to your home. The customer experience is flawless - the order call is always received by a very courteous and warm executive; the packaging of the food is adorable and a great local touch to it. If all this is also not enough, they sent a card - swipe machine for me on two occasions, when I didn't have cash because of the demonetisation debacle.¬†

Coming to the substantive experience, I have ordered the Himachali Khichdi and the Chutney Pulao. Both were delicious, with generous quantities of ghee and love :). I particularly enjoyed the complimentary tomato chutney, which unlike most tomato chutney I have eaten in Calcutta, was not sweet. I also make it a point to eat their Sprouts Kachumber, which they are always nice enough to customise with a little extra lemon juice. All their food comes in adorable terracottaware, and there is lot of attention to detail with respect to use of recyclable materials. Even their spoons are wooden - a delightful touch!

Super yummy, and full marks for presentation and service! Kudos on being one of the few places in this city that focus on satvic eating and environmental consciousness!

Great concept  along with excellent  taste with a very exciting  menu. Have tried almost all the khichdis and loved the taste of all. Special mention to the presentation as well, very unique. What started as an experiment  for me has now become my personal favorite. Keep up the great taste and hope to see more delicious dishes adding to the menu.

The best food that I have had in a long time. It reminded me of my mother's home cooked khichdi. The difference here is the variety. The chutneys are awesome

Khichdi is a sheer delight for Bengalis especially on rainy days. Given the level of rains in West Bengal, I hope Khichdi Khichri is received in every household. Their eco-friendly packaging in earthen pots and jute bags are also reusable. It's a treat to order from them. We thank them for their support to Earth Day Network and hope to have them more often at our Organic and Natural melas.

Nice concept and good thought for promoting Indian food for all people of the world if people start promoting Indian food like this then I am dead sure people will forget eating western food or junk food

The place has a lot of varieties. I had the opportunity to have one of the many varieties of payasam available here. It was really tasty and made with so much love by a group of women working for this space. Would love to order Khichdi next time. üòÄüòÄüòÄ

Amazing wholesome food. This is a boon when you're tired of eating the same run of the mill food in restaurants. Easy on the stomach and pocket too. My parents were far more than impressed and loved every portion of the various khichri ordered. The packaging was really sweet.

Awesome delicious food and also very healthy. The menu has many varieties for different tastebuds at the same time, keeps the healthy food factor well in check. A must try before you turn into a regular for KhichdiKhichri. Keep up the good work, KK!

I am a great fan of anything rustic and Khichdi Khichri, its food reminds me of everything 'Home' and childhood.

So far I have ordered food 3 times from this charming place.. I have tried a different thing every time and now I know what are my pet favourites :D

The best part about this outlet is the service. Everyone you will interact with is courteous and pleasant. The food delivery is pretty awesome. They ask for advance notice and when you get the food, you sigh with pleasure. The food comes in lovely earthen pots and eco-friendly donas. Everything comes in a cute, little Jute bag, all of which have been squirrelled away by me for carrying food for my kid when I go out. The bill can be folded into an origami childhood game (Name is elusive.. I wish I remembered it)which can be used to decide which Khichdi you want in future!

Now the food. Things I have tried so far: Tomato Khichdi, Upma, Pongal, Aloo Tuk, Chokha, Tomato Thokku, Onion Pachchadi, Kasundi Raita, Masala Papad and finally, Moong Dal Payasam. Everything has tasted homely and delicious. I have no words to describe the feeling of satiety I get after eating food from this joint.

My personal favourites are Tomato Khichdi, Aloo Chokha, Onion Pachchadi & Kasundi Raita. The Moong Dal payasam was pretty awesome too. The food never upsets my tummy and the portions are generous. In future I do want to try Bisibele Bhaat and the other South Indian variants of Khichdi in the menu.

Khichdi Khichri is high on CSR as well and feed a poor for every portion of khichdi ordered. Makes me feel good to order food from here.

I have no complaints from Khichdi Khichri and I highly recommend this place.

Excellent concept with a start of eco friendly business module just a hats off and nothing to say about it. Coming on the taste of khichdi is really homemade has nothing to say, only to say please grow up this module, so that every person gets the loveliest taste of it. Thanks khichdi khichri for a marvellous concept at the heart of our city also enjoyed the great tasty lunch on that day.. üòäüòä
