Didn't Expected this from you guys (Amma's Kitchen). I have earlier ordered for Thai Fried Rice that was so awesome but today i ordered lemon chicken along with Thai Rice. It's clearly seen with the packing with no name and moreover there were broom chops in entire Fried Rice...

After long tym I found a guys being chinese,  dont know the... The flavour of momos... 
It was my worst experience,  as I been there with my friend to have momo and chowmein,  but the taste was really worst,  we have to leave it in between, as because it was changing our views about the momo. 
They need to work on flavour and service...  üòí

Best pocket friendly Chinese here and don't think if the price is low then you will have to compromise with the taste. The highlight is the burn butter garlic rice or noodles and the quantity is more then enough as well as the quantity and the staff is also very polite and understanding.And last but not least on top of these they also provide a wonderful discount like 15% what else we require so don't have any second thoughts ordering food from here because this place won't dissapoint youüòÅüòÅüòÉüòúüéä

Wow. Such salesman. Such clever salesman these people have. They so smartly try to deliver you wrong items. I had ordered momo and soup at around 11pm. They come by 12 am. They tell me they bought me wrong order but its very clear that it was the only item left in the restaurant and they were trying to sell it off to me. Amazing guys! Thank you for pissing me off.

Chinese is my favourite cuisine and Amma Kitchen is one of my preferred Chinese Outlets in Picnic Garden. This particular outlet is located right opposite to State Bank of India on C. N. Roy road and it is quite spacious, neat and clean. No table service is available here and only has an outdoor seating for 3-4 people. I had ordered for Prawn Fried rice and Veg Singapore Rice Noodles. The Prawn Fried-rice was non-oily and delicious, but the noodles were a little bit let down. The service is prompt. Except for the ambience, which does not matter, since it is a quick bite place; overall, it was a nice experience.

Ordered food last night n we were very happy with the quality & quantity. We loved the Thupka and the chefs special momo. The kids enjoyed the crispy honey chicken n the noodles. 
Over all a great experience will definitely order again and very reasonably priced!!!! A must try!
