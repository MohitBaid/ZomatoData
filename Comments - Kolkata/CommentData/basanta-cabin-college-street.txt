After a long time I was here. 23 year's back I enter and discover the fish kabiraji hold the same taste. Chowmin was OK type. They need to polish like other old famous restaurants.

I have heard about this resturent that uttam kumar generally went there so I have also give a try.
Its feel like a highroad side dhaba.There is no cleaniness, I have ordered chicken fried rice that is a very much bad taste and the plate is also not cleaned. I have just kept the unfinished plate and after paying I just make a exit. Dont go there

Whenever I go to college Street, even at least for five minutes I enter into here. Everytime I go through the room , sit on the wooden chairs and take a cup of tea I become so nostalgic that a  word can merely define...After Indian Coffee House , I should say Basanta Cabin is such place where poets, artists, writers of that time used to gather...and lastly people like me who loves the tea most, Basanta Cabin is one and only place in Kolkata where tea is served at Rs.5 in a place of four walls around.

There are some places which are above and beyond any reviews or recommendations. Today when the food scenario is changing fast, there are a few eateries left which gives you a sense of the true nostalgic Bangali (no it's not a spelling mistake) feeling. I have always heard about this place from my Ma but only got the opportunity to visit last Saturday. And as I said true Bangali feeling! I love moghlai paranthas and they managed it to get it just right. It did not taste great and the kabiraji was also ok. So why the 3.5 rating then?! In today's Calcutta where most of the restaurants have posh ambience with zero takeaways, the old uncle who serves your food will strike a chord with you. And when I handed him a 10 rupee note his smile was worth something! As with my other reviews I have mostly talked about food as I should but here something else takes the precedence. Emotions dwelt. And it does not happen everyday!

The significant history attached to the old joint made us visit Basanta Cabin, which once was a place where our grandparents would spend their leisure with good quality food.

The present condition is absolutely disgusting. We ordered coffee which was more of water with a tincture of God knows what, and the kobiraji had everything but chicken.
The price is affordable but with the quality of food even the meagre sum feels like a waste.
Highly unrecommended.

Do visit this place to have authentic kabiraji, cutlets...
Otherwise this old shops will shut down someday with many memories...

It is a very old food joint just opposite of medical college gate 2. They have not changed anything , it has the same decor since the british period I guess. I have come accross many old food joints but never seen such a kind before. Its really dark inside with a few bulbs throwing bright yellow light at your face. They have all kinds of menu on board from indian to chinese. Going by the looks I ordered sonething safe i.e paratha and mutton kasha. It was larged sized "luchi" rather than a paratha. The mutton kasha was okayish nothing worth mentioning. Had good company so did not have a bad time. Its a place where you can have mere ordinary food at a very cheap price.

There are many restaurants which carries on their businesses not solely because of the food, but because of various other factors related to it. Some has a history linked to it, others have quality service and extremely well behaved staffs, whereas few give some extra perks. However, these perks can be favourable or adverse depending on the type of people visiting it.

Basanta Cabin is among those food outlet which provides perks instead of food. It is located on College Street in an old dilapidated building, being devoid of mobile network or taste of food. However, the staffs here are honest as because I have once misplaced a possession of mine, which they kept secure and verified before handing over to me.

If you are interested in having even low quality food, please do not visit it. Even their tea or coffee seems pathetic to me, let go of the meal.

Inspite of serving such pathetic food, this place runs its business well because of the extra upper seating arrangement with cabins separated through curtains. This well secured private place gives enough confidence to the couples to plan their future ahead and is probably the sole reason this place is still in existence.

The dishes are awesome esp chicken kabiraji, fish fry, moghlai parantha, noodles and rice and lots of starters etc. The ambience and decor is not good which attracts lots of customers. Its quite shabby. There is not  enough seating space. The servicing is good, is fast and quick. Also the food rates are reasonable enough. Its quite old in the city infact the best.

Serving foodies since 1931, basanta cabin definitely was one on our list of food outlets to be tried, and we did that today...well,just as you stand in front of the cabin, it will take you many years back from the prevailing age of modernisation and fancy cafes and themed restaurants..the interior remains as simple as it has always been..the decor reflected the flavour of the cabin era of kolkata , aided by the wooden benches, tables and ash trays...well , we went at around 2 pm and majority of their menu was unavailable..we settled for a chicken kabiraji and a chicken cutlet..well, to be honest i was pretty happy with the food..it was light on the stomach and tasted pretty good..was served hot..rs 100-150 is enough for 2 to have a stomach stretching dining/luncheon over there..service is okay..another one off my list and i would recommend it to the ones who would never mind getting a flavour of old kolkata.....

Located at a pivotal point in North Kolkata, you will easily recognise it if u know college street or else it can be a pain to find out. It located at near the Calcutta University side of Surya Sen Street and just in the opposite footpath of College square.

Its a fairly old place which mainly sells meals and other food. These places are old and sell the Kabiraji cutlet which is a old charm and not available fairly throughout Kolkata.

The Kabiraji Cutlet was a bit oily and the amount of fish used (i had a fish Kabiraji) was little. Its pretty easy to hate it. Although I felt it was just ok. I was also offered tea which i did not order. 

Its just an old place whose quality has gone down over the years. I used to hear good things about this place from my grandfather but now its not like before.

We had their...
1. Chicken egg chowmin~ It was quite tasty... 
2. Chicken kasa & paratha~ It was not kasa is was jhol... but the quantity was huge... it came with 3 large pcs of chicken... and the paraths were basically deep fried large luchis... whatever it tasted decent...
So it was an average experience...
Pocket pinch was ok...

I know this place has a bad reputation for the service - but I assure you, the chicken Kabiraji they serve over here is more than enough to paper over any deficiencies they might have with regards to service. The old world feel with dim lighting and cranky chairs add to the ambiance.Don't be in two minds about visiting this place because of the low rating on Zomato, this place has been famous since 50 years before Zomato came into existence.

The food here is surprisingly tasty. Even the Chinese items are prepared well. The ambience is pretty dismal and to top it off I cannot for the life of me understand what goes on upstairs. On several occasions I have seen couples walk upstairs hand in hand . This is followed by the owner taking note of the time. This to me could mean just one thing. 
So whenever I eat here this one thought plays on my mind continually.

Ok so everybody seems to be happy with the history it bears. Im not so fond of the place, its shabby and warm, the staffs do their own work & doesn't even bothered abt the customer. The price to quantity & quality ratio is decent if not bad.
The only thing that pinched my tatse bud is the 'pan fried momo' the rice is a bit less in quantity than all other similar typ shops, the manchurian is wotrthless with pieces of extremely small size chicken covered with some atta like stuff that taste awful...
The rating is solely based on the taste of the momo. The kabarajis & fish fry/cytlet is still left to explore.. will surely try them in my next visit.

Located beside Calcutta University, opposite to Medical college. The name is  a brand itself.  Today I had Chicken Kabiraji. It tastes superb. Quality wise ok. Like other typical north kolkata restaurants this place is a little shabby but otherwise ok. Sitting arrangements are good. I'm happy with the experience.

This is a eating house with very dim lighting and not so pleasant seating arrangement.
But if you don't care for all those and want food, then come here and try the fish fry with kasundi. 
A big fillet of fish coated with bread crumbs and fried to perfection.

After reading the great novel Kalbela i was very keen to explore that place. One day while visiting college street to buy some books i went there. Basanta cabin is one of the famous heritage eateries of kolkata. If you are looking for mindblowing ambience eyesoothing decor then it is not the right option for you , but the place has its own charm, a retro aura can be felt there. I ordered chicken kabiraji and moghlai paratha. The food was served quite promptly. Quality of food was really good. The kabiraji was fantastic in taste and the moghlai paratha was yummy too. Though the place is  not eyecatchy, it is capable enough to win a food lover's heart.

This place bears the league of heritage foods of kolkata. They have tasty fishfrys and kobiraji on their menu. This is not one of those fancy restuarants or cafes of kolkata.

In all my five years in College Street, I have come here once only. That too a year back. We have had the Fish Kabiraji and few took the Chicken Kabiraji. The chicken one was.a big breast piece, tough to tear off. The fish kabiraji was pretty good. And we loved it. Yum!

Nil ambiance, bare sitting arrangement, yet this outlet is one of the 'The places' to visit if you are in and around College Street. Flooded with history and lots of memories, ask your parents, what Basanta Cabins means to Kolkata and its history.

If you are still not convinced regarding the history part, come here for the food. They still excel at making some of the wonderful Cutlets and Kabirajis. Although, the quality has fallen down in the past few years, it is still worthwhile a visit. Pocket pinch isn't that high.

The reviews here really deteriorated the place as before i wouldn't have visited the place reading reviews of zomato but due it's my second locality nowadays i go there with my friends now and then.  The kabiraji cutlets are famous here and are must try.  The other items tried by me are chowmein,  fried rice and chilly chicken and those were nicely made to give your tummy a satisfaction.  This is not a high place so one can't wish much of the ambience as it is not that tidy and clean in look but kabirajis are a real gem .

This place looks a bit unclean and unhealthy but the food is nice. In a place like college street where you find nothing except books and Bowbazar where gold shops stand dominant, Basanta cabin serves the hunger. It also remains open for a long time. Chili chicken dry is good here. Basanta cabin is a better choice when compared to the most famous and hyped Indian coffee house. It's a pocket friendly food stop. Please do visit this place when you are tired of roaming through various book stores, colleges and gold shops.

When I ve uploaded d pics on my fb wall,my frnz became amazed...."shit yaar,u went into this cheap food joint?" I asked them what is actually CHEAP? I damn care about ambience n all, if my taste buds are satisfied,if my pocket is satisfied n above all if I think "pet r mon dutoi vore gelo",then nothing is cheap. I would rate this age old n very famous food joint above many sophisticated bar or restaurants 8 on 10. We took mixed fried rice, chilli chicken and of course coffee. All were tasty,chicken pieces were smooth n no complain from my part. N.Kolkata is itself a age old place,so if you wanna eat in old food joint,you have to make up your mind. If you like to eat food....only good food....doesn't care of ambience, dirtiness n all, if possible,visit here. Take my word as a N.kolkatans, u ll not be disappointed.

The place is located on the foot opposite Calcutta medical college and is diagonally opposite Calcutta university. The entrance is narrow and the place is hard to spot if one is not good at spotting signboards . The interiors are gloomy and not very well kept . Though the food isn't bad . The chicken  kabiraji is nice , priced at rupees fifty . The cutlet seemed tinier than usual , and not as good as the one available at coffee house . They also have chilli chicken , chow mein , parantha etc on the menu . Try out the kabiraji and leave the rest . The dismal ambience doesn't add to the adda mood. At all.

Yes, not the cleanest, and definitely not the most hospitable joint you'll find - in the shabby lanes of College Street, this is a far cry from the folklore surrounding it.
First recommended by my maternal grandpa, I finally decided to pay this place a visit. 
It's really tough to locate, but we did manage to get a seat in the ground floor - the cabins up top were as dirty as they could get.
The only redeeming factor was, the food. The Fish Kabiraji was sumptuous - not very oily, and delicious. 
The Moghlai Paratha, although a bit on the oily side, was well made. 
Verdict : Come here. But only for the food.

The name Basanta Cabin is  associated mainly with the era of 1960s and the early 90s.
After that this place had completely lost its charm.Today it stands in the midst of a buzzing College Street pavement,and the passersby hardly recognize it.

Maintenance wise this restaurant is  slogging behind and the interiors are really not of much interest.
The most astonishing fact is that there is hardly any place to sit. Being a foodie it really irritated me to stand and enjoy my food.This in fact shows that the place is extremely laid back....

The food Moghlai Paratha and Aloo Dum,Chicken cutlet and fish fry were good in taste,but there has been a steep rise in the price(yes we are no one to blame them also).

All in all not a memorable experience at all.This place needs to be upgraded so much so that it rather goes for a complete makeover.Until then I don't think it will be able to cope up with the market competition.

It hasn't it's glory regarding the adda, discussion and food.. Food is as bad as it can be.. Back in the days coupled with coffee house these 2 dominated college Street and political situation of Bengal. Alas nothing left of it.. If you're are an old admired please don't stop by here and carry bitter memories..

It is the place I visit if not Indian Coffee House. It used to be a really nice place. Heard some great stories from father and other elder persons. But my experience was not good. Its former glory is long gone, now it is just a normal street side food joint. Nither the food is tasty nor the service. So it may be a historical place it didn't stand up to its reputation.

The Description: Its at the Hedua crossing behind the bus stop. I often use to go with my friends there.. but now i have totally stopped visiting here...

The Ambience: Place is very small only few chairs and tables. Not that clean.

The Food: The chowmin here is really disgusting according to the prices and the cutlets are a bit satisfactory. The chow was so oily and and cant even find a taste in it.. Very disappointed And after that didn't ever tried anything.

The Conclusion: Its was a place for hangout and good food.. but now it will not only destroy your mood but also make ur money wasted. Last time i went there and my  experience was a disaster. 

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

i went with my friend few days ago..we ordered chicken cutlet ...fish fry and fish kabiraji...things are steep priced and the food is yuckiesh..full of oil and bad taste ..only the kabiraji was eatable..
the shop is untidy and not clean at all..service is slow..and it hurts me to say that this place has degraded from its old avatar..very very disappointed!

No way it will make u visit again. If u are at college street and u are running out of money and need some food badly then u gotta come here. Typical bangali food with a touch of unheiginic conditions. Taste of food is average. Not that good. I donno whether they wash the plates well or not. Damn sure u will vomit. It is a historical place. But it did not kept up its goodwill. So my rating is 2.0. :(

There are only two of the five Basanta Cabins in Kolkata now. Started in 1890, there were five such restaurants, and after feeding Calcuttans for decades, the restaurants shut shop one by one. College Street, Moulali and then the one in Bhowanipore - which peaked in the 60s and was patronized by Uttam Kumar and Basanta Chowdhury. This is another place where people used to flock for “adda”  along with good food. The items to look out for are –

Moglai Parota – Rs 35
Mutton Kasha – Rs 110
Fish Kabiraji – Rs 50
Fish Finger (6 pieces) – Rs 120

Taste is average and fish finger seems to be a bit overpriced. Mutton kasha also needs more improvement. Overall, it is a place to hang out with your friends for some adda and get a dose of nostalgia.

I had been there last week with friends from work. A small nondescript hotel tucked away in a corner.My friend and colleague ordered for us as he was true blue food  fanatical Bengali....and was obviously the best person to order for us. We started with Fish Kabiraji touted as the original Bengali fast food dish. Succulent fish with onions and eggs fried and spread over it... A little oily for my taste but very lip-smacking. We moved on to egg Mughlai parathas and the only place you the get the same is obviously Kolkatta. Kasho Mangso to taste was okay and the pieces were less. But the bill for 3 came to 400 bucks.There is no place in Delhi that you get a full meal for 3 at 300 bucks . On a whole a good expierience.Just do not look at the decor...Just Eat!!!!!

We were pushed into this place on Oshtomi morning after visiting the College Square Puja Pandal. I say 'pushed' because the sudden rains left us with no other alternative and we had to run into whatever was open in front of us. The place is ill maintained, soot covered and has a dampening feel to it. However, having no other alternative, we sat down and ordered for a fish fry each, with a softdrink thrown in. The Mister was telling me stories he had heard from his mother about this place and I was looking forward to the food now. The fish fry was actually pretty decent and tasty, and that prompted us to order for a plate of chicken pakodas as the rain hadn't ceased yet. This time, once the pakodas arrived, we were left gaping at them. Eight overburnt chunks of chicken bones dipped in a thick layer of batter. We had two each, did not find a single shred of chicken in them, and could not proceed any further, and had to dispose of the rest. The bill came to Rs. 200/- which wasn't really cost-effective considering the ambiance and the quality of the chicken 'bone' pakodas. My first and last time at this place, and no amount of reminiscing from elders is going to change my decision.

Went to Basanta Cabin for the first time. Had Mutton outside home also for the first time. It was Mutton Kasha. To me it was awesome. Love to have a go at it again whenever I visit it.

well this place is an option only if you want to do "pet puja"... but you have to be blind enough to overlook the place. dark, dingy and delapidated, the food they serve is ok. the price is ok-ish. my friend and I ordered a plate of fried momo and mixed gravy chowmein which we shared and it cost us 110 bucks.... you may go here if you are in college street, very hungry and want any place to sit and eat

I must be mad to be writing this review. But I will go on anyway and let you know of my misfortune. Have you heard the song Bela Bose by Anjan Dutta? Those famous lines "Rastar koto sosta hoteler boddho cabin e bondi dujone...." probably sum up everything you want to know about this place. My dad tells me this place was quite popular in his days. But it is nothing more than a sooty, dark and dirty pice hotel at present.
We ( my dad and me) entered this place because Food Station was closed next door, he for a bit of nostalgia perhaps and me thinking "how bad can it be?".... I will break it down for you...
Decor- What decor?????!!! Aren't the soot covered walls and furniture enough for you?
Service- Hardly any with a child labour wiping tables and a man taking orders.
Food- Nothing was available except "Charapona mach and bhat"! Not even egg!!!
Price- Surprisingly on the higher side!!! I have tried enough pice hotels all over west bengal to compare pricing! Trust me!
I am going to give this place 1.5 (Generous me!) because my dad told me it was decent enough once....
