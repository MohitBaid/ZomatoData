I love the food... When you are hungry, what really matters is the food.... Paytm is also accepted so people can go cashless. The employees are very nice and cool.

After a long practical exam, you find yourself too tired to find new places to try out, especially in a place like Shibpur, where finding a decent restaurant is quite similar to finding Rs.100 notes dispensing ATMs these days!
Based on a friend's review we thought of trying out this place and we were not exactly disappointed.

Ambience and atmosphere: It's not a place for people like me who is as my friends have tagged "naak unchu". The discoloured walls, the chairs and tables all speak of the "maintenance" The plates and cutlery even weren't in the best of their state, but then, who is bothered with all that when you are hell hungry(well, I am!)? The only part which is worth speaking about the restaurant was the big aquarium.

Service: We actually thought there is only one person who cooks, serves, and even sits behind the counter. That must not be the case though! Service was quite fast.

Food: We were three hungry people, but even if we weren't hungry, the amount of food served wasn't satisfactory. We had ordered chicken butter masala, chilli chicken and mixed fried rice.
The mixed fried rice was very low in amount and 2 plates were highly insufficient for 3 people(which is usually not the case). And I realised it later that the mixed fried rice didn't have prawns. Me being allergic to prawns didn't make much difference though. The chicken butter masala was try-worthy. The pieces were succulent but 6 pieces ought to be similarly sized and here it wasn't the case. The chilli chicken was not good, somehow it didn't suit our taste buds, it had a weird taste and it had bones :/

And then came the climax! We had a 2000 ka note to pay and it was happily unaccepted. They do not take cards and even "Paytm accepted here" was false! We were in a mess and the owner agreed to accept the 2000 note and give 500 back and we were supposed to collect the rest of the balance the following days. Thankfully we found one of the ATMs dispensing Rs.100 notes and finally the story ended for the day!

All in all, if you are in Shibpur, near B.Garden or IIEST and want to sit somewhere to eat, you can give "New Mirch Masala" a try :)

*located near B. Garden 55 bus stand
*really inexpensive food, considering the quantity.
*quality of the foods arguable, but belly-filling deal.
*place is really small to sit 'n breathe at the same time
*null ambience
*provides home delivery.
Recommended, if avoiding minor pocket pinch.

Inexpensive restaurant ideal for college students of Shibpur engineering college. Located close to Botanical garden main entrance. The place is very small.

Call them up and order food. That's the only way you can actually somehow like what they serve. The place, with all its ambience and aquariums and television sets, sucks...big time. Food is still okay-ish and I personally order food from here only because its very near to my place. Other than that, I sincerely do not know of one good reason why people should go for it! Chilli chicken is the only item that you might like...that too depends a lot on ur expectations! :D

The quality of food served is really poor. I got stale food on multiple occasions. The service is bad and the behaviour of the staff is not at all good.

I had visited New Mirch Masala more than once, during my 16 year long stay at D. S. Lane. Mirch Masala is located at the B. Garden bus stop and can be found easily. While comparing their food with other food joints of this area, one can say that they serve pretty good food. Price was also reasonable. If one is around B. Garden, then can certainly look for Mirch Masala, otherwise not recommended as their food is below average and not very hygienic too.
