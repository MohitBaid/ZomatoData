Had both plain and paper masala dosa from this place. Food is quite nice. Service of the restaurant staffs is really good. Overall it's a nice place to have veg dishes.

Situated on the eastern flank of James Long Sarani near Sakherbajar this place offers vegetarian food. You will be bowled over by the courteous and suave behaviour of the crew including the owner. The price is reasonable too.

Pure vegetarian.. But food and service not upto the mark.. Price tad high in comparison to what they are offering. They need to make amends if they want to survive in the market

We placed a direct order with them couple of days ago, as we were looking for vegetarian fare. A friend had eaten from this place recently and had good things to say about this place, thus we had ordered. 
Our order was for plain dosa, chole batura, kulcha and butter paneer. It was a lunch order, which reached us 30 minutes later than they said it would. Barely minutes before delivery, the restaurant informed us that they couldn't deliver the dosas, but the delivery boy had left already and that we needn't pay for the dosas when he arrived. 
When the order arrived, to our utter disappointment, they had not sent the complete order (1 plate butter paneer was missing). We had already paid for it and the delivery person had left too. The quality of the food was also not at all satisfactory. The kulchas were more like thick parathas with no flavour. The baturas were just like big puris and the most disappointing fact was that in spite of us asking them repeatedly not to put onions and garlic in any dish, the chole had onions that were plain visible.
We reported the matter immediately to the manager and he apologised and agreed to refund the money for the food that was not delivered and also for the items that were unsatisfactory. The next day, the money was returned and that was probably the best and most decent thing that they could have done for us after that debacle of a lunch.

Who would say that for the vegetarians there is no place in kolkata? This is one of the best place for veggies considering the price and the amazing combinations they have I simply love the place. The dahi vada with tamarind chutney taste still lingers in the mouth. Amazing to eat. Try out the chilli Babylon and pastas for a great experience at a throw away price . However a little courtesy from the staff are required

This place is okay-ish for tiffins specifically dosa, the vada is totally oily- we had to squeeze out a lot of oil before we could consume it. We ordered Chilli paneer which was not at all edible. It was raw paneer in some sweet sauce.

The staff is very friendly though, they were apologetic for our review. It is a new hotel still under construction but they are maintaining it neatly as of now.

First coming to the staff response  extremely poor , very very poor service. Secondly they have Ac lounge up stairs for which they are charging 20% on the bill amount which is crazy. Third the food is extremely bad. Never would visit this place again. Full thumbs down.

It's like next door to my house, new kid in the block....pure veg stuff.... although I have been here only 2 times and I checked out dosa, pasta in red sauce and lassi....I am bit disappointed by lassi bcoz it's not chilled enough and you can feel sugar in your mouth....pasta was average and dosa is good....they charge extra 20% on the bill value if you sit in the air conditioned room and you have to order food of atleast 200 bucks to sit in the AC.... common who does that???charging minimum 40 bucks for AC,not good mate...
