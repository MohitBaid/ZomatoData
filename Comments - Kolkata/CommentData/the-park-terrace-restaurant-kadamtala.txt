I have ordered a spl Mutton Biriyani on 31st Dec 17 for lunch through food panda. Quantity is good sufficient for 3 people, 2 big Mutton pcs with huge bone, less meat, 1 egg and mediun size potato.. Taste is not bad but u can't expect the authentic taste as u get ot Royal or Arsalan... I'll visit the place soon to try their other items...

I wonder if there's a zero rating possible. The delivery was 2 hours late and two items missing now they cancelled the order and refuse a refund as well. My money and food both are gone.I'm taking serious legal action against that stupid restaurant owner and make sure he doesn't have the audacity to break his customers call again and say "never order from here again" .This restaurant was nothing but pure ball sucking time waste and I've never been so seriously raged out as now Consumer Forum is gonna receive my call soon against the restaurant. Be Prepared :) The WORST restaurant u can find on zomato.

Parcelled food from their takeaway counter. As per the rule was waiting for my order no on the display board. To my surprise I waited nearly around 50 minutes for my parcel and they didnot even bothered to call my order no although it was ready and packed at the table. Finally when I asked the guy inside the counter about my order and he got me the parcel. Careless to the core and food was cold. No food was worth mentioning and too overpriced. I don't think I am going to visit this restaurant again.

Very Overpriced. Less quantity. Food quite ordinary in taste. Had their indian dishes. Chicken masala, chicken tikka masala, kadhai paneer, daal makhni and plain rice.
Chicken masala and kadhai paneer had no difference in their taste. Chicken tikka masala was okayish. Only the dal makhni was good.
Home delivery in the area by the restaurant only if the order value is Rs.700 and above.

Edit: Tried chicken biriyani few days back. Ordered via zomato online. Was very disappointed because they took nearly one hour to deliver the food. Anyway the biriyani to my surprise was unexpectedly good both in quality and quantity . Chicken , egg and the aloo was perfectly cooked. One can definitely try the chicken biriyani here.

I have been there for eating non veg with my brothers after a long time but the Restaurant made it worst and I am sure that I am not going there again in any circumstances . First of all we ordered chicken irani kebab which was just average (like to say kaamchalau) and after a long wait it was served . The waiter's are also not trained and pushing each other work , that order is taking someone serving another attending another . Then we ordered chicken nawabi in gravy which was very much less in quantity and the Tandoori Roti was like a papad as much thin , then the mix fried rice was good in taste , chicken butter masala was also a disaster full of pepper and not well cooked , naan was also like Baccha naan size and at last the price is also very much higher according to quality and quantity. The menu which is uploaded is old , currently price 10% more of it and don't forget for the GST @18% !!!!!

Didn't hear good feedback before but when I visited it was really good. Ambience is quiet and peaceful. Enough space for a big group. And for us the service was good. They served pretty fast .
Can be improved more only when they get good customers. Giving 4 rating as an encouragement so that they make it awesome and people from Kolkata soon drive to our town.😊

Parcelled Mutton Biryani yesterday from their take away counter. The service was quick as I received my parcel in no time after placing the order. So a big thumbs up for that. Now coming to the food, the biryani was pretty good. Much better than I had expected it to be. The mutton was so well cooked that it melted in the mouth. The quantity was also appreciable. I would definitely try other items from this place. 😊

Been here for dinner tonight... And after visiting here i discover that you have to be in proper dress to have your dinner in this restaurant ( I was wearing 3quater long pants and tee) as been a foodie I have visited quite a lot of places but never gone through this kind of queries from the security guard... And the most hilarious thing happen, when I inform the owner regarding this, he told me that 3quater long pants is allowed... Then why the hell the security guard is judging the customers???
From this it is clear that management has not trained their employees properly regarding the rules...

As this same thing happen with MOCAMBO (Kolkata) and right now they have paid a lot for their misbehave....

Nice place with great foods. This place is very well decorated and very well maintained. The staffs are very friendly and welcoming. The food items are really good. Very tasty and are presented quite beautifully. Their gravy chicken chow, pasta, biryani, polao, chili chickenand tandoori items are worth trying. The only thing is that they can improve on the quantity of the foods they serve. 
Overall, its great to be there once in a while.

A phrase is called that unplanned things are better than the planned once but it got wrong when we visited the restaurant it was unplanned but we decided to go to the restaurant .
FIRST of all at the entrance the informed us that the kebabs and the tandoor were off today because of the fever of the people who used to make .
SECONDLY I would like to tell about the ambience it was the only thing I liked as they have well maintained the restaurant .
Thirdly about the food we ordered crispy chicken mutton biryani nd chicken tikka masal a it was very bad as half of the food was left by us because it was not tasting good as the prices are very costly over there .
As I am writing this review over my personal visit nd experience to the place.

All of a sudden plan to have dinner from outside therefore me and my family decided to have take away. We had ordered mixed fried and garlic chicken. As starter we decided to have reshmi kebab. The time of preparation of the food was near about 20 minutes. However, coming to the taste of what we had the food was disappointing. The fried rice was very dry and the chicken had no taste except for some garlic and tomatoe sauce gravy. The kebabs were not tender even. Compared to the quality of the food, the price rate is high.

To avoid the unwanted overcrowd we visited the restaurant after 1 week prior to Durga Puja. The ambience was pretty good and I can say it is among the good one's what we can find in Howrah. Big space, well decorated interior, good lighting all together a good place to hang out with friends and family.
Now, coming to the food. I visited with my two friends and our order was short and simple. We've ordered one Mutton biryani , one chicken biryani, one chicken bharta and two tandoori rotis. The food was good. Biryani was bit too oily but the taste was good and the quantity was sufficient. The bharta was average and it didn't taste like a proper chicken bharta. 
Service was also good and can be much better with their amount of staffs in hand. They served our order in about 20-25 mins.
Over all the experience was good, we can say okayish. They promise a lot of good menu options . I hope they will be available as some visitors didn't get those. I will surely visit the place again to try out there continentals and other dishes and hope something good will be waiting. Cheers :)

The interior was sophisticated but the food was disappointing.Hakka chicken chowmein was extremely bland in taste. Boiled strand of noodles was soaked in oil with very low salt content and other ingredients required for taste.The chicken pieces were also somewhat stiff.Chicken bharta was not proper at all.It was too oily and again it was incapable   to please the taste buds.Hope next time will have a better experience . Listings in the menu is impressive but most items are unavailable. Requires dramatic improvement to become number one in Howrah

Just went once during puja. The menu was cut short. We ordered kabab , fried rice and hot and garlic chicken. I didn't like the taste of the rice at all.it was dry and the rice was hard and undercooked. Yhe chicken compensated for that. It was delicious. But the best part was the ice cream which was deeellliiciioouuss... Tax is a bit high. Good ambience.

When we got the menu card, we found astonishing items like steaks, sizzlers, pastas etc. But the excitement droped immediately when heared that only kababs, biriyani (not even hydrabadi one) and common Chinese foods like fried rice, chilli chiken, chowmin etc is available. With sad heart ordered reshmi kabab and chello kabab. Taste is ok for starters. Next stop was mutton biriyani which we got immediately but alas... its cold.. mutton was too hard to chew. Quantity was good but again taste was miserable. Finally tried hakka mix chow. Again disappointed.. And the shocking thing was that we waited 45 minutes for bills to arrive. It seems they were trying to wait us out so we will be hungry again and order something!! But even dessarts also not available so their idea failed..

Waiters are good, they are very friendly and service was excellent. But it seems managers (more than one) are new and unable to handle customers nicely.

Hope when this rush hours of puja season will over, they will start all items they promised in menu card, managers will get experience, then the whole restaurant will be able to shift up to 2nd gear, but according to the structure and menucard promises it should be able to run on 5th gear...!!!

Had to wait for nearly 45 mins as it was crowed which was obvious during Pujo Season. Now coming to food quality, it's was good. We had chicken reshmi butter masala, chicken tikka masala, tandoori roti n masala kulcha. Food were served on time. All were good other than the masala kulcha. It tasted blunt. Only tandoori n kebabs were available in starters, Chinese starters were unavailable. Overall average.

Very disappointing.. Had gone today with lot of expectations but their rude behaviour wasn't something one looks out for during pujas in howrah.. Went at 7:30 to book a table , they told us to directly come and get ourselves a table .. when we went there at 8:30 - everything was all booked and we had to wait.. On top of everything , they were all shouting on us and asking the security to take us out.. It clearly seemed like they were paying for our food or like we were first time getting into a restro.. It's better they keep their attitude to themselves and unless you know how to interact/behave , kindly please don't open up a restro here to insult the town and look down on people this way..  we are not here to take any of your bloody frustrations.. keep it to yourself..

Food quality is average, but behaviour of staff are very very poor. They think that they are helping us to get food. what ever order you will give, you may not get. What ever is available in the kitchen, you have to eat those. They demand that, they have table reserve option. But, in reality they doesn't maintain it. As per my option, it's staff not suitable for good family.

Plz upload the full menu card asap. Untill and unless we get to see the options, it's difficult to visit this place. Puja is just round the corner, we need to go through your offerings before we visit

Went here with lot of expectations, but was disheartened. The restaurant has not started its all offerings yet. Continental are not available till now. Did not get mocktails and desserts also. Kebabs are ok. They do not serve good quality fish yet. Hope they will do in future. We tried chinese . Cook should go to authentic chinese restaurants to taste how chinese should be. Overall moghlai seems to be tried. Needs improvement on chinese and normal Indian foods. We will check other offerings. As it just started business we can expect improvements in future. Price wise it is reasonable.

I must say that they are strictly unprofessional. Don't expect good business if you are so lazy to upload your menu card. Neither they are introducing all dishes nor providing home delivery. Such type of unskilled business doesn't work in deeply competitive world.
