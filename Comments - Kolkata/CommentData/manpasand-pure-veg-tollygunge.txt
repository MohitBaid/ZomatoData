This is a worthy place for veg food lovers.
Tried Dhoklas, dahi vada , gulab jamun. All were tasty and fresh.
No sitting arrangements as it is a roadside eatery .
Pocket pinch is very friendly .
Quick service & hygienic .

যদিও নিরামিষ তেমন পছন্দের নয় তাই না বলা সত্তেও প্রায় জোর করেই এক অবাঙালি বন্ধু প্রথম নিয়ে এসেছিল , সেদিন প্রথম পরিচয়ে এই জায়গা টার সাথে সাথে নিরামিষ খওয়ার এর প্রতি একটু টান জন্মেছিল । তারপর নিজেই বার তিনেক ঢুকছি নিজের ইচ্ছায় । পুরি আর সিঙ্গারা টা মনে রাখার মত বলে মনে হয়েছে । নিরামিষ যারা খান তারা অবশ্যই একবার এসে দেখে যেতে পারেন ।

Located near Azad garh this all new veg eatery serves some lip smacking veg dishes. Had tried their Daahi Vada and gulab jamun which was too tasty and lived up to my expectations.

A wonderful option for Vegetarian food lovers, this place excels in making some simple and lipsmacking offerings. Tried the dhokla here, which was quite soft and melted in the mouth. The Gulab Jamuns too were quite good and helped me finish off my meal in a sweet and lovely way. :-)

Any Roadside eatery reflects essence of the locality and food habit. So is this very ordinary shop located on NSC Bose Road. This shop is essentially Gujarati. The chatpata stock of khakra and fapra adorns the store shelves. Not to mention the yummy poori and bhaji, kachori, samosa and other namkeens. In sweets- hot jalebi, a must try. All are priced at very low rates, around 5 a piece very much to the standard of Kolkata price range. 

Food- 3.5/5
Hygiene-2.5/5
Price-4.5/5
Ambience- NA ( Roadside Eatery)
Value For Money-4/5

I just had food from this shop yesterday suggested by one of my friend. I was amazed to see a marwari food cooking shop here in south Calcutta.  Food was good simple and healthy.

Just today only ( 14-07-'15) I went to the place for my fav. Gatte & pakoray wala Kadhi for our lunch at home. They proved it that if Veg. Food is properly prepared it can surpass Non. Veg., win the heart of a hardcore Non-veg eater. But truly Amber's pure Veg is really good.
                 Gatte was very good & similarly  Kadhi was also splendid. The portion was sufficient for we two.  After a long long time I enjoyed nice delicious Raj. Food. Pricing is very reasonable by its portion they serve. It is very near from my home.  
              My heartiest thanks to Zomato.  This will continue. I asked them to serve B'Fast at 8.00am. But they may start it later not now.
