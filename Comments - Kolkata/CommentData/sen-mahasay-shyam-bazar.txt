This Sweet shop is one of old heritage shops of North Calcutta.The look n feel of the shop would certainly make you believe so.Inside of the sweet shop,four tables are there with proper sitting arrangements.I ordered freshly prepared nolen gurer rasogolla,one piece of rasomalai,one sweet curd and a gulab jamun.The rasogolla tastes really nice.Sweet curd tastes average. Rasomalai was itself tasty but the milky sap(ros) was very dilute and blund in taste.Gulab jamun was really soft and melted like overall I liked the ambience and food.

Still they are maintaining their own old good reputation and quality as far as possible. Had kochuri and aloo dum with chocolate sondesh and it was a great experience as both of them I found fresh and tasty.

Located in fariapukur, shyambajar. it is among the oldest sweet shops in kolkata. Its a simple shop serving authentic bengali sweets. The sondesh is great here. Specially the "aam sondesh" is spot on. Sitting is available. The price is affordable. Must try as it is a legendary shop.

One of the oldest sweet shops in kolkata. Recently they have opened many branches throughout the city. But this one is the best outlet among them holding the old age legacy.
I love their MIHIDANA, CHANAR POLAO, KHEER ER CHOP, KORA PAK SANDESH.
CHOCOLATE TALSASH is really a 'traditional with a trendy twist' item.

Although a legendary place but the sweets here tasted nothing special to me. Rather they were overpriced and poor in quality. It seemed overrated to me. Completely my opinion, though.

The first, oldest and the main branch of Sen Mahasay.
It offers you many varities of sweets and snacks.
It is famous for its sweets like Khirer Chop, Darbesh, S Sandesh, etc. and snacks section includes Samosha, Radha Ballavi, Nimki, Kasta Kachouri, etc.

I grew up eating sweets from this shop only.. Any occassions say Bhai Dhooj to Parar Kali Puja to Birthdays, whatever it is it must be from none other than Sen Mahasay. ❤

My personal favourites and recommendations are
● Khirer Chop
● S Sandesh
● Mihidana
● Darbesh
● Rasamalai
● Rabri
● Mishti Doi
● Radha Ballavi
● Sita Bhog

When i hear the name "Sen Mahasay",The first thing which comes to my mind is "Kheer-er Chop".

Craftly fried in ghee,kheer er chop offers you a delicate outer lining with amazing flavours of ghee which'll shake awake your senses and the moment you dig into the sweet and take your first bite,the blend of kheer and LOVE-thebsecret ingredient of every sweet shop in kolkata,will surely rejuvenate your tastebuds.

Savouries like "Radha Ballabi" and "Shingara" adds to the charm of an north calcutta evening.

Sen Mahasay,one of the oldest sweet confectioners of shyambazaar and kolkata, is carrying forward the legacy of offering the city and it's people, sweetness to their lives in every occasion.

If any sweet lover has missed this place , please be fast to visit this shop.
I visited it last evening , set amidst the old lanes of Shyambazar , the shop would give the feels of 1920s . It might not be some kind of fairy land looking pastry or bakery shop, but I must tell you it has the best sweet I could have asked for.
The shop has an aura of simplicity, the rates according to its quality are really cheap.

Huge fan of their Kheerer chop, kheer kodombo, pesta sandesh , Nolen gur er rosogolla and mishti doi. 
What really strikes out for me is that each of their sweets have a distinct taste and you can enjoy every bite without being over powered by the sweetness.
Also love te Kathaler sandesh during the season and the mango sweet.

If you are looking for quality sweets, this is the place to come. I went there today and had few sandesh here. The Pesta Sandesh Green in color was amazing. Then their Chocolate Sandesh is something I couldn't resist myself to. Had their Chocolate sandesh and it was again brilliant.
I guess any of their product is wonderful, this is an heritage spot selling sweets for years.
Prices are bit pocket pinching. Chocolate sandesh was Rs.25 and Pesta was Rs.20. So are the prices of all others.

Sen Mahasay! The name has been in North kolkatans in their blood. I had been visiting since I was a child. The sweets were great, the snacks were wonderful. One could sit on the classic old chairs and have radhaballabhi and some sweets. Chat away and look at the world passing by. The food was excellent, the ambience was great, the people were great.
It has been many years since and the place still holds the old world charm but the quality of the sweets (which is the heart of Sen Mahasay) has dropped a little. Still a great place to have good sweets.

An old world place for the old world charm of bengali desserts, sen mahasay (meaning, Mr. Sen) is located in the busy old bengali stronghold, shyambazar. It is a place for@ reliving nostalgia and tasting some of the best bengali sweets of yore that have taken second place in the city shops to fusion sweets. 
Take your pick from the 'naram  paak' /'koda paak' sandesh. Simply put, soft and hard sandesh. There is the yummy kaachagollas (cheddar cheese balls), taal saash (hard sandesh filled with liquid jaggery in the centre), the famous mihidana (itsy-bitsy yellow balls which fill your mouth with syrupy wonder), and many such charming popular tasty sweets.

A very popular and well known name when it comes to Sweets, this particular outlet of Sen Mahashay, is situated in the same lane to that of Amrit/Amriti and Striker. Been coming here for atleast 24-25 years now, starting from my childhood, when my mother used to bring me to Striker to purchase the toys and other kid stuffs. My favorite here always has been the S Designed Sondesh and the Khirer Chop, but the Mihidana and Radhaballavi are also very well made here. The place has got a couple of sitting options, so that gives you enough comfort to sit down and enjoy the fingerlicking snacks and delicious sweets..!

Aah... What Sitabhog and what Mihidaana ! If you are wondering what they are (although they are pretty common in Burdwan district), go and savor these delicacies in Sen Mahasaya and you will remember them for long. 
Located and easily accessible in the Fariapukur Lane at Shyambazar, this place has been a legacy of north Kolkata. However going by the look of it, the outlet is not as posh as the other modern multi-chain outlets that have grown in the recent times. Nevertheless, I would only recommend the place and go back again and again for the Sitabhog and Mihidana !

Send mahasay is a sweet lovers' delight. I love their mihidana and rossogolla and their khasta kachuris but my favourite is their radhaballavis which they serve with alur dom. They have seating arrangement in Shyambazar branch. I frequently visit this place and would recommend it to every one who likes bong sweets and savouries..

Send Mahasaya is one of the oldest and popular sweet shop in Kolkata. It always reminds back the good old days of city of joy and still carrying the legacy along.

##Location: Located at Shyambazar Fariyapukur area.

##Experience: They are famous for Sitabhog and Mihidana which originates from Burdwaman. It tastes amazing and a must try from here. Also there are lot of other authentic Bengali sweets are available which are equally brilliant. Sweet lovers must visit point.

Nothing to say about it. Always classic. Marvellous quality of sweets. Classic about theis rossogolla is, within the rossogolla a mixture of kaju,pesta and keshar makes it sublime. One must try it. And moreover, it is like heritage of Kolkata. So you should definitely go there to visit the heaven of sweets.

A very old and famous Bengali sweet shop near Shyambazar. They still sell most of the traditional Bengali sweets and mostly Chena items and have not converted themselves in a modern shop with more elaborated menu on offer. Shop is also little shabby

I have been visiting this place several times since childhood with my parents whenever I went to Fariapukur to buy toys. They serve mind blowing Sitabhog & Mihidana combo, Kalo goja, Kheerer chop. And its special Malai chop is a delight to the heart. 
The outlet @Fariapukur also has sitting arangement.

A very famous sweet shop in north kolkata located in fariapukur,hatibagan area. A sweet lover's paradise, every bengali living in north kolkata knows of sen mahasaya. Mihidana,rabri, mishti doi,chocolate sandesh are mouth-watering. Also radhabhallabi nd aloo dom are awsome. Prices are a little above average, though comparing the quality with other sweet shops, one wouldn't mind spending a little more! 😀

Went to a friend's house where was treated to some evening snacks consisting of kochuri and aloor dum from Sen Mahasaya, accompanied with their creamy yogurt, only a bit thicker and smoother than a vanilla ice cream. The stuff were so, so good that I recommend this place for any food enthusiast for its a food lover's heaven when it comes to typical Bengali snacks, besides sweets.

You will love this place only if you like authentic Bengali snacks and sweets. The poori is stuffed and made into a thing called Radhaballabi which is served along with amazingly tasty dum aloo,this isntheir trademark snack which is worth a try for anyone visiting Kolkata or staying there. It is soechlessly good,needless to say Bengali sweets are sure to make you go gaga over them anytime you have!!

Are you an authentic bangali and love MISHTI????
Have you ever tasted বর্ধমানের most popular in the world মিহিদানা and সীতাভোগ???
If yes, then take my word and visit once this mishti outlet. You ll feel heavenly when tasting these items.....
1. SITABHOG ( authentic bengali sweets made with pure ghee. It tastes heavenly, trust me)!!! 👍👍👍
2. MIHIDANA ( yellowish colour sweets,another super duper hit mishti,made with pure ghee). 👍👍👍
3. CHANAR POLAO ( once you taste,you ll crave for it more and more). 👍👍👍
4. PESTA SANDESH ( very smooth নরম পাকের সন্দেশ filled with real pestas. Just awesome).
5. RABRI ( I can't even explain the taste, if you don't taste it. Just BRILLIANT!!!! I always buy 1kg, can't compromise).  
5. RADHA BALLAVI WITH ALUR DOM ( its also made with pure ghee,awesome taste,but less oily). 👍👍👍

* Location : Just 5 mns walk from Shyambajar metro station towards hatibagan at FARIAPUKUR MOR. Its a 100years old mishti outlet,every N.Kolkatans knows the location.

* Ambience : You ll not see a big mishti outlet in kolkata as this sweet shop because its enough big and almost 15 people can sit and taste their sweets. Especially I like the aroma of pure ghee when I enter into the shop. 👌👌👌 A cool, calm ambience though located a very busy fariapukur st.

* X factor : Trust me or not, they export their SITA BHOG, MIHIDANA and CHANAR POLAO every week all over the world more than 500 kgs!!!! 😜😜😜
Now I think you have understood how popular this mishti outlet is!!! So, If you haven't yet tasted, just go and taste it. Trust me, its awesome!!! 👌👌👌 @priyabrata ganguly

Date of visit - 10/02/2016

Occasion - food walk with Facebook group 'Good Vegetarian Food of Calcutta' 

Item tasted - Radhabalavi Aloo dum

Description - Sen Mahasay is one of the oldest sweet shop. Visiting this place was part of our hathibagan food walk. This legendary shop has a reputation of selling quality product at comparatively a little high price. Radhabalavi Aloo dum I felt was not the best. I missed on trying their sweets but will surely try it on my next visit.

One of another Misti-palace in the city
And this one will do wonders to your taste buds
Located in the busy Shyambazar-Hatibagan market area in a wide lane between the Bidhan Sarani and the APC Bose Road,this sweet shop is quiet large and clean as well
Being an old Calcutta fantasy,me and my friends decided to visit it late evening after our tutions.
The sweets were classical,juicy,aromatic.The langchya was typically fresh and the standout remained the our very own "Rosogulla" - it was just heavenly,just melts in your mouth and makes u feel like "abar khabo"
The prices were at par and the ambience was nice.Overall a "Sweet-house" worth visiting
P.s.- Would like to have the misti doi next day

One of the legendary places and a favorite destination for many bengali people when it comes to sweets. Some people might find this place a bit expensive when comparing with other local sweet shops but that is what you pay when you get The Sen Mahasaya quality. I love this place and would definitely recommend it to any sweet lover.

Khirer chop and Rosomalai of this place are must haves. Sondesh,all of them are fresh and melts in your tongue. Prices are reasonable,the Shyambajar outlet provides sitting arrangements as well. After satisfying your sweet cravings,make sure you pack some Mishti Doi to have later at home. ?

The shop is located in the lane opposite Shyambazar Ajanta. The sweets are the usual Sen mahasay fare with kheerer chop and kalo goja topping my list of favourites ! The rajbhog is priced at 20 rupees and is spongy and slightly overpriced . The lyangcha here is the original Shaktigar version in its shape and appearance , and even has a pink centre ! Yummy. The shop has an adequate number of seats though loyalists rather buy home than sit and eat here.
