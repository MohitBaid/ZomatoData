This place is an absolute delight. 
I had mango doi and baked rosogolla which can't be described by words but one has to eat to actually experience this delicacy. 
The money spent was totally worth it.

Undoubtedly the best sweets that I've ever had are from Balaram. Apart from the mango doi, the blueberry doi is also phenomenal. It's a must try and the new stuff they come up with each passing day is appreciable.

One of the best sweet makers in Kolkata and undoubtedly the best creative sweet maker in Kolkata... Baked rosogolla, mango doi, nolen gurer souffl√©... The list is large enough... My favourite traditional Monda ( round shaped Sandesh with nolen gur inside)...
You have also extended your business in UAE and recently in Oman ( in Sarod utsab)... Wonderful... Continue to fulfill our expectations with new innovative ideas along with Bengali tradition...

This place has always been famous and rightly so for its Sweets. But today we ordered lunch via swiggy with luchi-cholar Dal and radhaballavi-alu r Dom and the quality simply amazed us. Mishti doi, Baked rosogolla, nalen gur er sandes and chana r jilipi were overwhelming as usual but the main course stole the show.

A traditional sweet shop, that is serving the nation for the decades, yes that's Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick Sweets.

Sweet like Rosogolla, Misti doi, Korapaker Sondesh etc. are kind of emotions to the Bengalies and salute to those persons, who are really taking care of it.

The store located near the Netaji Bhavan Metro station.

Tried their baked rasogolla, misti doi, sondesh like - aamer sondesh, chocolate sondesh etc. Every time I have a sweet here, smile automatically comes from the face and that's its beauty. Love the store, love the heritage, love the tradition.

Being a sweet lover I love to explore various  places in kolkata and Bularam Mullick is the one which I can't replace from my favorite's list. I love each and everything from this particular place. From backed Roshogolla to koraishutir kochuri everything is just perfect here. And yes I am telling you if you are in kolkata and you never visited this place then dear come and have a single piece of sweet from here it will make you fly high (mistir nesha üòâ)

one the place in bhawanipore branch is so small and crowded that it's difficult to eat one piece with any peace of mind.

If you are a Dessert lover, you cannot resist yourself from this prestigious and heritage sweet shop from the city of joy. Balaram Mullick are setting high standards with offering of varieties of desserts and bakery items. 
Tried their most famous Baked Rasogulla(recommended) and Baked Doi. Both are amazing and luscious specially baked rasogulla. Best part was their rate which was very pocket friendly. You have to loose only Rs. 15 for that baked rasogulla nd Rs. 25 fir their baked doi.

Awful place....buy sweets and be prepared to find insects like bees inside your favourite nolen gur desert. Unapolegetic and arrogant management says it happens due to contaminated gur from rural suppliers. Its tall claims of super hygenic automated manufacturing process goes for a toss. Surviving solely on gimics and marketing.....products are pathetic. Your neighbourhood sandesh shop is better, cleaner and cheaper.

On my recent trip to Kolkata, I visited this outlet to taste the famous sweets of this place and also to bring sweets to my home in Mumbai. I had heard about this shop from few family and friends who had raved about their sweets. I also read the zomato reviews to know about the popular items here.
As expected, the outlet was crowded when I visited there which is a sign of any good eatery. I had a plate of Aam Doi which was really delectable. As I scooped a spoonful of doi, the mango pulp from inside oozed out. The combination of the sweetness of Mango and the mild¬†sourness of curd makes it the king of dessert.¬†¬†
The baked rosogolla¬†over here is a real winner and a must-have. The top-notch quality and the genuine taste can only be found over here. I also tried baked sondesh, gurer¬†sondesh, kachagolla¬†amd pineapple sondesh all of which were equally good.
I truly enjoyed this sweet experience and the taste of the heavenly sweets is still lingering in my mouth

This outlet of Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick Sweets is located in Bhawanipur, opposite Khalsa High School. It is about 5 minute walk from Netaji Bhawan metro station.

This age old sweet shop is known to almost everyone. You'll get a variety of sweets and snacks. The price is extremely reasonable and the food is worth the money. One should definitely try the Aam Doi and Baked Doi. The pastries are soft and delicious. The Kulfi is also good here. We also tried Spring Rolls and Kesar Kulfi Sandesh.

This outlet is not much spacious though. Seating is available but not for many. Definitely a recommended place for everyone who are craving for something sweet and are near this outlet of Balaram Mullick and Radharaman Mullick Sweets.

This sweet parlour is located near Netaji Bhavan Metro Station and will surely satisfy your sweet tooth. 

I tasted the Baked Mihidana, Rabri and Rasgulla. The Baked Mihidana was the best I ever tasted.

The payment system was a bit awkwark for me. First you have to pay and get a blank receipt where the staff will add up your balance and then at the end you will have to present the receipt again, referring to which the cashier will return you the balance. Because of this two tier process, there's generally a crowd at the billing station.

But the sweets are really amazing.

Oh! what a place man. Simply sweet. Went there with friends are let me tell you, it was worth the time spent. We started with Rasgulla, it was good, nothing out of the box. Had the same taste in Odisha. Gulab jamun was really tasty. Radhabhog was good but my friends were not impressed. Band Rasgulla was out of the world, it's really awesome and is a must try. So guys if you are hunting fit done ru good sweet then you hit the Bulls eye. Enjoy.

mango souffle sandesh- one of the best sweets here sereved as per piece aroound 20 bucks , it had original minute pcs of mango in it with fresh cream malai mixture which was off white coloured. it tatsted lovely and was fresh.

baked rasgulla-indeed the best dessert here , was too happy to discover something new here and was damn lovely with a brownish coloured and the super aroma of rasgulla. this sweet had really won my heart and i m definately gonna recommend others. this is a must sweet if you are heading here to eat.

small browni square shaped - the name was not properly given as staff did not knew wat exactly it was. i ordered it and it dissapointed me as it was too hard to bite and left a very bad impression, .
there were two trays maybe the one i had was two days old as it smelled bad and was too hard.
i wil upload the picture.

mango mishti doi- one of the lovliest sweet again. it had to melt and flow in my mouth and it really did.the super fresh mango and doi combo was wowwwwwwwwww.. loved it a lottttttttttt.

white forest pastry - tried this pastry but the stuffing was out of coordination as in white forest they have mixture of white choclate cherry and a little brown chocolate but it was very bad filled with choclate and nuts ¬†dat was a real miconception of theirs, they should hire a special chef for cakes and pastries as all of them looked miss matched . plz dont try any of pastries or cakes if you are really looking for authentic ones because of misconception out here.

one more thing i experienced here is that the cash counter girl is just senseless as she told me different rates and the order taker told me different rates.so beware otherwise you will be fooled out here. ¬†¬†

¬† ¬†i request the management here to atleast be ¬†familiar with rates....rest i would love to come here again n try lots of different varieties here.....

A true blue Bong's appetite is never satisfied until and unless he gets his dose of maachh(fish) and mishti(sweet). Coming to sweets, we have a tradition that goes back for centuries. Kolkata invented Rosogolla, Kolkata serves the best Misti Doi in the world and it's Kolkata where you get your choicest overdose of Sandesh.

Starting from the age old traditional sweet makers from KC Dass, Bheem Nag, Dwarik Ghosh to Putiraam, today's cool misti outlets are still doing great in business though people are a lot more calorie conscious these days. Even amidst the rise of fast food chains, Kolkata's sweet shops have held on to their identity and are constantly reinventing themselves.

Balaram Mullick and Radharaman Mullick is such a chain of sweet shops across the city. They have a tradition of making sweets since 1885 and the Bhawanipur outlet is their first outlet in the city. They now have cool and happening outlets in a lot of place around the city and have some amazing lip smacking and mouth watering sweets and snacks to offer.

Their products are made using really scientific and hygienic methods in their factories and their shop outlets just extends the joy to the customers.

Let's come straight to their products and list out some of my hot favorites:

=> Aam Doi: Mango flavored yogurt is number one and hot favorite for me. What's amazing is that beneath the layer of yogurt you have actual mango pulp. Yummilicious to the core!

=> Chocolate Lava Sandesh:Here's a tasty twist to your chocolate sandesh, replete with liquid molten chocolate filling inside.

=> Jol Bhora Sandesh:This one's always been a classic. The taste of nolen gur just melts in your mouth.

=> Baked Rosogolla:This is one of their best products. A huge favorite across ages, this baked version of the classic Rosogolla is ready to rock you!

=> Cadmish Sandesh:This is a fusion of Cadbury CHocolate and Sandesh and done to perfection. THis heart shaped mishti will make you fall in love!

=> Kulfi Sandesh:If you are a lover of Kulfi, you will devour up this one like a glutton! The packaging is too attractive!

=> Gulab Jamun and Baked Mihidana:You can't say no to a hot Gulab Jamun fried in ghee, can you? And the classic mihidana here has a baked avatar and is all set to make your diet plans go for a toss!

=> Diabetes Sandesh:Diabetic? Don't worry! This sugar free sandesh is too tasty and will end your grief of not having sweets!

Let's now explore some of their snacks:

=> Kucho Nimkih:This crispy namkeen fry is an all time tea time favorite!

=> Veg Chop, Veg Puff and Paneer Puff:These are all good salty snacks, which fills you up and tasty too!

=> Cheese Straws:Okay, Cakes does them better but you can give it a try here too!

Apart from these, Balaram also has great Dhakai Parota, Muffins, Vegetarian Cakes, Pastries and Pies. A bit of pocket pinch for sure, but you will love it if you are a connoisseur of awesome sweets! Visit Balaram today!

Somewhere this shop holds the initiative to introduce new kinds of sweets from time to time. Extreme hygiene is maintained in preparing the sweets and that's one of their boasting statements other than the magnificent platter of sweets they offer. Needless to say they are a touch expensive that the rest. But it's value for money

This is located near netaji bhavan metro station, just a walking distance of 3 minutes.. Though gps helped us out to find the outlet..
As I mentioned in my previous review that I went to their park street outlet to taste kulfi but they said kulfi is only available to their bhawanipore branch so I had to go there.. :D
I have to mention that they have so many varieties like sweets, cakes, desserts and fries too..
Food ordered:
1) Dhakai parantha : This is soo big n good to taste.. specially the chholar daal was too good.. probably the best one I have tasted in any sweet shop.. costs only 30 bucks..
2) Chocolate mudpie : This was simply amazing, mouth watering and so on.. I bought 50g and it was for 50 rupees only..
3) Keshar kulfi : I went there for this mainly but I was not that much happy with that.. nothing special in this.. just okayish type actually.. probably it was also for 50 rupees..
4) Baked rosogolla & 5) Gulab jamun : I bought these for my family members actually.. though tasted a bit.. both were good but nothing to be overwhelmed..
I have to visit this outlet soon as so many items were left out there.. :p

Your customer service @ shop near Ruby which is frequented by me.  Today afternoon @ 2/ 2:30 I was humiliated by your counter shop as my daughter had already tasted a sweet and asked them to drop one item from the pack he  was preparing for us as she didn't like the particular item. The shopkeeper behaved rudely and asked us to decide our mind first before asking for an item. We pleaded that we come here frequently and how can we always know the taste and if taste is not palatable why we should take the same just merely by looking at it. He pointed out to crowd and said there are a lot more people to cater to as if it's a retail Ration Shop .
Who are the people Sir. I told him are we not? We are the people. I used to frequent your place and now no mor after this repeated bad behaviour in front of all and despite being a long time patron. Sweet  is readily available and it has an elastic demand.  I have a choice to buy elsewhere now  question is DO YOU HAVE AN OPTION TO SELL TO ANYONE ESP IF HE IS NOT INCLINED? 

I am afraid the answe is NO. There are many many shops
 in Kolkata and if your staff behavior is thus appalling,no doubt its a matter of time before your popularity ebbs. 
I hope you come out with a proper clarification and change staff if at all you expected customer to return.

The variety is unbelievable and every single item looks decadent and delicious. It is almost impossible to choose from them! 
But my all time favourites include the choco-lava sondesh,baked roshogolla, baked mihidana and mango sondesh.

If you're really embarrassed by the sweltering noonday heat of the city and feeling thirsty to have a glass of clean, hygienic cool water, make no mistake than to slip into the famous Balaram Mullick sweets shop, close to Jagubabu ( Or Jadubabu) Bazar near Netaji Bhavan metro station. Believe me, it is always a better option to taste some of their brilliant desserts rather than going for some cliche, calorie enhancing soft drinks.
The other day I tasted‚Äã their CHOCO LAVA SANDESH, ABAR KHABO SANDESH and KESAR RASOMALAI. And needless to say, all three are out of the world. Those who haven't tried till date, pls don't ignore. Whether u've a sweet tooth or not, it is absolutely immaterial. Do not be deprived of a brilliant taste. The pure Chocolate caramel within the Choco Lava Sandesh nourishes your mouth with a feeling of 'LOVE" and you feel yourself lost in a different planet. Abar Khabo looks very traditional. But will certainly deceive you with it's lovely taste of "Nolen Gur".  Try it. Kesar Rasmalai is another fascinating creation which literally gives u a kick of soothing Kesar.
Enjoy these ones.

This place is very famous for it's sweets and it tastes good too.
Hence we have taken chocolate Cake 2-3 times from this place and it was not fresh at all. It had sour taste and henceforth we had to return it.
Also I have experienced this Unfresh cake problem from it's 2-3 Outlets. 
This surely is not expected from such a famous outlet in Kolkata with a big brand name, selling unfresh items and not once but twice or thrice. This itself prooves that it was not a mistake and they use Unfresh items or re use materials for way too long. 
Rating 3 is still given for their delicious and large variety of sweets that they have.

After a hectic day in college me and my friends decided to come and check this place out to satisfy our sudden sweet cravings. And it did not let us down for sure. We were really excited about trying Baked Mishti Doi and Baked Rosogolla and it was the first thing we hopped on to. Also tried Rabri and Lobongo Latika. To our surprise there were a lot of other deserts too like brownies, souffles, etc. We decided to go for the mudpie which sure melted our hearts with its chocolaty goodness. Though the seating area could get some help but otherwise I would surely like to come back and try the other range of sweets and deserts available.

A Calcuttan with the worst case of sweet tooth would get sweets from some of the most renowned sweet shops in the city. This one in the best one. Very innovative with the sweets they sell. There's nothing on the shelves that will not seduce you into devouring them. The sweets here are not just sweets, they are an emotion. Balaram's baked rosogolla is a household name. Their mango curd is a must in many Bengali weddings. They just won't stop in creating lovely new variations of sweets that Bengalis deeply love.

The baked rosagulla is highly recommended.  
Apart from this the chocolate sandesh and the nolen gur is a must try.  

The pastry section is the black forest. Great taste.

Balaram Mallick and Radharaman Mallick doesn't need any introduction as it falls in top 3 Misti joints of Kolkata.They are famous for serving traditional Misti with a global twist. basically they innovative new Misti. 
As it was occasion of bhaifota I got the opportunity of selecting the shop from which we r gonna buy the Misti... I chose Balaram Mallick,went there but got disappointed as most of the Misti that I wanted to buy were finished as it was sooo rush over there ,so end up buying Strawberry sandesh, chocolet sandesh, chocolava sandesh, baked rasugolla and baked sandesh. All of them are awesome.But people visiting there make sure u guys try their
1.Mango Gelato sandesh
2.Mango Gur shuffle sandesh
3.Baked Mihidana 
4.Gandhoraj Sandesh.
5.Choco Excess Sandesh.

It is a 5 star hands down. The quality of sweets is awesome. Try anything and they will mesmerize you. I tried the pithe during the sankranti. It was awesome, the gur they use is beautiful.

A big thumbs up to B.M.R.M for the sheer variety that they stock.
Be it sweet or savoury, the different variants are mind-boggling.
Have had their Shingara and other savoury snacks like the methi nimki. It's nothing like anything.
In desserts, have had their patishapta(full of the flavours of pure ghee), their mango doi (soft and fresh) and their chocolate mud-pie( a chocolate lover's delight).
Also had their norom paak jolbhora and chocolate truffle mishti last evening.
Blew away my mind again.

Visited their stall at the Calcutta Classics Food Festival at City Centre today. I was keeping my eye out for something chocolatey and hence had the Choco Lava Sandesh. The Cadbury chocolate flavour was ample within the Sandesh. Little bit of chocolate syrup was oozing out after a bite, it could have oozed out more. The chocolate rice used for decoration on top was a good addition. It's a good option for chocolate Sandesh lovers.

The different types of sandesh, sweets, samosas, radha ballavi & all other snacks are made with utter perfection. The choco lava sandesh, rabri, ice-cream sandesh are mouth watering. I liked their special singaras too. 

If you like desserts just go for it, the brand for sweets in Kolkata!!!

The famous Balaram Mullick &Radharaman Mullick has a branch out in Bhawanipore(could be the main shop) and hence ,we tried tasting some sweets from there, rather it would be better to say that we are daily trusted customers of this sweet shop. Since its the season of puli pithe and other traditional bengali sweet delicacies, we ordered for bhapa puli , makha sandesh , dudh puli n gokul pithe, as well as packed, home some more too..surprisingly we all fell sick n suffered terribly from food poisoning ..what a disgusting and degrading quality of food!!! The SIMPLE hygenic conditions are also not maintained in the shop -a trash bin being located right below water booth, houseflies all over, salesperson serving sweets without wearing gloves, their whacky contaminated hands had worsen the situation! !! Oh god what is wrong with them..because they win awards, does it mean all basic ethics of theirs will go for a walk! Balram n Radharaman Mullick needs serious cleaning guys! I simply dont get it the food quality dropped, cleanliness changed its meaning in the shop but the saga of attitude and roughness on part of owner continues!! Disappointing very much indeed!! Please look into these matters andbrush up ur services and staffs!
We vote for u making "Sera Mishti Shops N Services"(??!!) and this is what u do??! Shameful.
Please note, its we the commoners who make YOU famous so your hideous activities will take no longer for us, THE CUSTOMERS to rip you off uyour attitude n pride.

When it comes to sweets balaram mullick and radharam mullick is the best place to go to. Just located near khalsa high school, this one is always filled with people. I tried their ghewar and trust me it's something one must try if you like something less sweet. And the bonus it's made from pure ghee. Mango sandesh was pretty good. The cake are quite different. I tried a white chocolate cake orange cake. The tangy orange flavour was unique and unusual.

Quality of sweets is heavenly but pocket pinch is bit high, but that's ok.

They come up with innovative ideas and never fail to satisfy their customers.
The cadbury misti's are bliss.
And the behavior of the staffs are very good.
My first time to this place was when I had gone there with my friends from college as part of a college project and they were very warm and welcoming and even offered us to taste some of their best items.
One should bookmark this place as a "must visit" if one is a true blue bengali who loves their misti.

One of the oldest sweet shop in Kolkata,has wide variety of sweets; sandesh particularly. The taste is really unique. Sweet lovers should try their Sandesh. Other than sweets, they also sell snacks like samosa kachori which are also tasty. Some combinations specially in fusion food are great. They have recently started innovating new varieties of sweets which are worth tasting. The Chocolate sweets are must try. If you love Bengali Sweets then you cannot afford to miss ¬†their sweets. ¬†My personal favorite is baked rasagolla. Try it.

When we talk about lip smacking sweets, the pensioners or even the modern people only have one name in mind and that is Balaram Mullick. This sweet shops has it's branches all over Kolkata and even though the prices are a little bit on the higher side for an average consumer, the taste of the sweets are incomparable with any other sweet shop here in Kolkata. I would recommend everyone to try their chocolate excess sweet priced at 20 INR a piece which is well worth the money. I would highly recommend anyone who still hasn't visited the place, to give this a visit as well as tourists who are looking forward to tasting some delicious sweets of Kolkata.

Need some sweets? Go to the local sweet shop. But want some innovative sweets? The Legendary name continues to amaze us with its quality and innovation! Been here many times, the quality remains the same every single time! The last time I visited this outlet, I ordered a choco excess sandesh, man oh man was I impressed? Well you bet I was! Also bought home some Kaju barfi. The quality was very good, not just an average Kaju barfi from the local sweet shop. The costs are very high, but the quality does the job of equalizing. The service was also pretty good, keep up the good work.

After having food in Denzong Kitchen, I asked my friend if he he would like to go this place for Desserts as it was one of the highest rated place in Kolkata when it comes to sweet and he agreed to visit.¬†

The place is very well maintained (Neat and Clean) and also the staffs were cooperative. To be honest i don't have sweet tooth and that's also one of the reason I find it difficult to try sweets. Anyways we had few things like Baked Rossolgolla, Choco Sandesh, Chocolate Marble and Mango Doi.

While we are having these things, I saw the happiness on my friends face and when I asked about it, he said "its out of the world" and when it comes to my feedback I really liked it but can't judge which one was better than whom.

This is one of the best places when it comes to sweets & desserts . Located near Jagubabur Bazar in Bhowanipore the outlet is very well maintained . The neat & clean environment adds to their already impressive food list. Apart from sweets they have karaishutir  kacouri , radhaballavi , aloor paratha , dosas ... the list is simply endless. The varieties of Doi - be it Mango Doi or Payodhi or something else - is simply mind blowing . The famed Baked Rasogolla is a must try . I love their aloor paratha , karaishutir kachuri also .Today (05/11/16) on a rainy morning  decided to have Karaishutir Kachuri & it was really good with quite heavy stuffing of Karaishuti inside the kachuri. This place is a must visit for any food lover.

This is my personal Paradise.
It's not easy for me to be sold out solely on taste,i should feel convinced about the quality that I consume.
They do exactly that.Best ingredients,superb taste.
My sweet cravings often take me here.is there any sweet they make that I have not consumed? Naaah.
I have an Alice in Wonderland experience whenever I
enter their shop,i stare endlessly at the yummmaaah sweets before I zero in on my sweet targets.
Go in for anything you want but if "different" is You,  try their Mango Mishti doi,Nolen gurer souffle,baked rosogullas,chocolate marble,lichur payesh & Mango malai.
Welcome to a whole new level of Bengali sweets.
Dig in.

Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick is my favourite franchise for fusion sweets.Love their baked rosogolla,mango gelato sandesh and cadbury mistis..specially the chocolate bon-bon sandesh.Among the savoury stuffs I like the radhaballavi which is served with alur dam.

Location-Bhawanipir,Kolkata.

We often visit this outlet as its nearest to us and along with that it also has a seating area.If you want to have an authentic taste of bengal's sandesh then a visit to this place is mandatory.They have an extensive variety of sandesh from fruit to real chena to chocolate but we visit them only to have their chcolate flavoured sandesh especially their "chocolate excess" which comes with a solid chocolate layer in between.

Once upon a time my father used to buy sandesh regularly for my brother's tiffin being barely hundred metres from our home(it was a tiny shop then without any branches!) I like the great sweets of this place but nowadays we think twice before going to this place as for regular sweets it seems not so pocket friendly. I don't like the people parking their cars in front of the gate and nobody say them anything..I'm sure it will go great business in the coming years but let not the price be so high that localites move to some nearby sweet shops and let not cars being displayed in front of the gate.

Oh my god ! The sweets served by this place are just delectable ! They are all just perfect.   
I tried chocolate sandesh, rasgulla, gulab jamun, malai Cham Cham, samosa and kachori. 
Chocolate sandesh was very nice. It was filled with a bit chocolate inside which made it better. This being a Bengali shop the rasgulla was expected to be good, but it was excellent ! So, rasgulla : recommended. Gulab jamun was also good and perfectly made. The malai Cham Cham had a mango sauce above it. This combination was new and unique but it tasted really delicious ! So, I would definitely recommend malai Cham  Cham. 
Now, samosa was also good but the kachori was awesome ! They were served with a chutney which made them more appetizing. So, kachori also recommended !
All In all, visiting Kolkata without trying balaram mullick and radharaman mullick 's sweets is incomplete. So this restaurant is highly recommended.

I have a lot of memories attached to them! The most liked item had was their eggless pasty! They're so so so fluffy! I'm a chocolate lover, so their chocolate pastries are a drool worthy thing for me. 
I've even tasted one of their dry fruit filled pista coloured sweet. It's a story of like 3-4 years back. That taste still lingers on my mind. 
Thank you for giving me so many memories and infusing the love for eggless cakes!

Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick is a name that needs no introduction. One of the famous sweet-tooth joint in South Calcutta. Being a Northie where ee have Nakur Chandra Dey, Nalin Chandra Das, etc. Balaram Mullick does give a good competition with them. 
We a bunch of photographers went there to have some light snacks after a photowalk. 
We took Dhakai kachuri, Dahi Vada.
Dhakai Kachuri was accompanied with Cholar Dal and Chutney. 
Both the items were equally delicious. Dhakai Kachuri was quite crispy. Dahi Vada was a bit less sweet IMHO. But the Dahi was fine and delicious when it got mixed with the masalas and Chutney.
Then we were given 2 items to taste.
1. Baked Mihidana (which had small Chanar Balls)
2. Mango Souffle

To me the Baked Mihidana tasted good because it was served hot and yet delicious. The Mango Souffle was a mouth melting dessert. The base was of makha sandesh and the top covered with soft mango cream. 
My verdict, the Mango Souffle wins the race.

I am a dessert lover and this place is a paradise for me.
The chocolate sondesh, the baked rashogolla, the baked doi, the jolbhoras, the ice cream sondesh, the radhaballabi , then there was this sandwich with pudina dhaniya chuthney inside and a huge chunk of paneer and all of it dipped in a batter and deep fried.
There is absolutely nothing in this shop that I don't like,
The rabri, shorbhaja just name anything and all of it is just amazingly tasty.
Last winter I had nolen gur er ice cream and you won't understand it until and unless you try it on your own. Till this date even just the thought of it is mouthwatering.
Trust me, if you are in Kolkata and you haven't been to this place yet, make sure you plan something soon.

I remember them having a section on the right which was for chocolates and cakes, I never got the chance to taste anything yet but then I am very sure its good, like real good.
I wish they expand and open a store in Bangalore, we Bengalis in Bangalore miss Balaram Mullick so much.

This is my favorite sweet franchise in the city and probably rightly so. The variety of sweets is unbelievable and is always on the rise due to their love for experimentations. More often than not the experiments result in delightful treats for sweet lovers. The different types of chocolate sandesh, baked mihidana, chhana pora, mudpie sandesh, nalen gurer souffl√©, mango doi and a whole lot of mouthwatering sweets are prepared by the franchise. But the baked rosogolla is simply the best. Many others have tried to execute it but none have come close to the ones at Balaram Mullick and Radharaman Mullick. Here's hoping that they keep churning out such lovely sweet treats for eternity.

Those who are from or have been to Kolkata must be familiar with the crave that one goes through, even at a pale sight of ‚ÄòBaked Rosogollas‚Äô from Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick Sweets, Kolkata. Undoubtedly we are no different. By the time R‚Äô would have captured the long awaited packet of joy from a friend, she herself gobbled up two of them without a single admonition.üòã

Being baked these Rosogollas are not so soft and spongy, but that unusual crunch imparts a delectable and matchless taste to this Bengali delicacy. Overall, it‚Äôs a real melt in the mouth healing every gastronomical soul with its sweet nectar of ‚ÄòGur‚Äô.

Do grab your share of these yummy sweet bubbles of desire, the next time you drop by Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick Sweets, Kolkata.

This is the original outlet of the famed sweet shop Balaram Mullick & Radharam Mullick, the pioneers of baked rosogolla in Kolkata, with its branches across the city. They have been spinning mishti magic since 1885, with a glorious tradition of quintessential sweetmaking to boast of. I'd heard a lot about them owing to their delicious Cadbury sweets at the Cadbury Mishti Festivals so decided to drop in here one evening as some work led me to Bhawanipur.
The shop is situated in a bustling alley close to Banchharam. It remains busy most of the time with customers jostling in front of the shelves displaying a plethora of mouthwatering attractive sweets on trays vying for attention. Interior gives off the vibe of a traditional sweet shop with touches of modernity here and there, like the trash can and Chocolates & Desserts section selling nice-looking pastries. They also have 3/4 small circular tables and chairs for seating arrangement for customers to perhaps try out baked mihidana or chilli paneer, for they offer both sweets and savouries like patties and baked samosas to name a few. Laminated awards for best sweet shop by Times Food Awards won over consecutive years adorn the wall close to the shop entrance.
We bought the Dhakai paratha accompanied with chholar dal and chutney, chocolate sandesh, baked rosogolla, baked singara and tasted malai doi inside the shop-cum-mini eatery. The malai doi was almost like ambrosia, kind of like phirni but distinct in its smooth texture and creamy thickness. Baked samosa was good, light and filled with generous portions of mashed vegetables like peas and sweetcorns; the sandesh or sweetmeat made of pure rich chocolate was also delightfully tasty, as was the Dhakai paratha. Baked rosogolla was simply heavenly bliss, specially when consumed warm.
Overall, I think they truly deserve to be awarded the best sweet shop, for they have strived to achieve the title over the years and keep getting better! If you haven't already tried their sweets, and if you are an ardent Bong lover of "mishti" or any sweetaholic for that matter, rush to Balaram Mullick & Radharam Mullick ASAP. They won't disappoint.

Shakespeare's poetry read out by Arnab Goswami at 10 pm is the perfect personification of Balaram Mullick.

Only go to buy sweets from there if you are okay with the cashier screaming at you.

Yes I agree their mango sandesh is good but I only tried it until my driver used to get me the same.
The day I walked into their Jaggu bazaar store myself, it felt like I was in prison. Staff is non cooperative obviously as the owner himself has no respect for their customers.

2 points for mango sandesh, 0 points for service and customer respect.

I saw this place turn itself around from a run of the mill sweet selling business to a thriving fusion sweet shop. And I love this avatar, this experimenting side of it.

The sweets are amazing- be it the baked roshogolla or the various chocolate and fruit based sandeshes. I can't remember the names but I ate a sandesh once with a layer of sandesh, topped with barely set ganache and rice crisps. I remember my grandfather exclaimed 'E ki! E to muri dewa opore!' And I admire the guts of these people for experimenting with this west meets bangali mishti without being afraid of hoe veterans would take it. I mean they still have a sizeable part of their sweets variety containing the 'conventional' seeets and they are well worth trying. But when you are in Balaram Mullick's, do try out their innivations. They deserve all the accolades in the world.

Went there a week ago after hearing a lot. Staff has very bad attitude. Particularly the person with spectacles at cash counter and a dark complexion middle age person at mango souffle counter. They behave as if they are offering sweets for free and doing the customers a favour.

A household and legendary name, when it comes to quality sweets. A pioneer of Baked Roshogolla, this is perhaps one of the biggest outlets they have in Kolkata. A concoction of savory sweet and snacks, it is like a food heaven. The brownie point here being, each and every product of theirs tastes delectable and hardy any of them would disappoint you. Have tried Baked Roshogolla and Mishti Doi, two of their popular products ever. Hard to describe the experience, the feeling is best said and felt when having the products yourself. Highly recommended for any sweettooth addict.

I am in love with Balaram Mullick and Radharaman Mullick since I had their Misti.

I tried most of outlet till date and this was my another. Its a huge outlet with a food court like setup. Like the idea.. Hospitality and management was good.

Tried Baked Rasogolla - great, Misti Doi - perfect - Chocolate sandesh - Awesome and Singara was also good. Pricing was also cheap.

Every outlet of Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick maintains the same quality and is absolute beauty. I love their sweets. Each and every sweets from this place is heaven. This particular place is quite bigger than other outlets and is kind of mini sweet court. I think this place has a large number of varieties which you don't get in other outlets. I don't wanna speak about any particular sweet because they hold the quality for every sweet.
But still i cant stop praising there "Aam Doi" because this is one of my favourites.
So if you wanna eat some good quality sweets and you are a sweet lover. This is the place for you.
Come here. And enjoy sweets

I can say without a doubt that 'Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick' is the best sweet shop in Kolkata. I have been visiting the Bhawanipur outlet for the last three years and I can say that this shop has never disappointed me. It is located in the lane beside 'Netaji Bhawan' metro station in Jagu Babu's market. On entering the shop, you will feel that you have entered a dessert fairyland. Sweet and savoury items of every type can be found here. I love their baked rosogolla, rosogollas, kaju barfi, gujia, white forest pastry, black forest pastry, chocolate mudpie etc. Their savoury items such as pizza, burger, puffs are also delicious. Today, I observed that they are serving dosas as well. I will surely try it the next time I visit this outlet. The behavior of the staff is amiable which acts as brownie points. I will surely visit again.

Well this is the first place I crashed into after landing in kolkata. I must have heard the name of this place from my Bengali friends. I was in the neighbourhood, I casually decided to walk into the place and see if this place was actually up to the hype it has created. 
It looked like a nice shop, and I entered the shop.I knew I was in for a surprise since I didn't know the name of more 50% of the sweets that they were offering. I picked 'Gud Rasogulla' and I couldn't explain how good I felt, the flavours started melting into my mouth, and my taste buds seemed to have attained nirvana. I don't think I ever ate anything like that before, I don't how many more I gulped down before I moved on to different Sandeshes. I don't know if could ever satisfy my senses in the same way anywhere else ever again. But this place actually lived up to the hype and has actually moved up in my list.

It was a mini food court of BRM. Always crowded and only 4-5 tables to sit. Very impressed with the ambitious it was very nice and hospitality was also very good. Quick service and very friendly and helpful staff. They have many variety of sweets and they also have separate counter for cakes/pastries and malai kulfi and also fast food and Chinese dishes. Their sweets were very delicious, fresh and made of brilliant quality raw materials. Not only sweets all the dishes of this shop was very tasty, delicious, fresh and brilliant quality. Pride of kolkata. Very old and still service quality sweets in affordable price. Brilliant experience here. Totally loved it. Highly recommended to all the people.

Not a sweet lover but how can I miss it when m in Kolkata... So decided to try out one of the most popular in the city and landed here... I ordered for a baked rasagolla, baked mihidana and chocolate sandesh... Baked rasagolla was gr8... The best of them all... Chocolate sandesh was somewhat of a dampener for me... I would prefer a chocolate than a chocolate sandesh... The mihidana was too sweet for my liking but then it was also good... 
Recommended for every sweet lover visiting this place...

These are the people who possibly brought fusion sweets to Calcutta, and invented baked roshogolla which are now served in almost all functions and gatherings throughout India. Their chocolate mishtis are to die for and so are their mishti doi. I love their AAM doi the most though.

This shop is located in a dense market of Kolkatta. It has one of the best Sandesh in India. It's a typical sweet shop. When you enter you'll see a whole variety of Sandesh and other sweets. The one which is most recommended is the Sandesh with a liquid filling. Just ask which one's the best they'll tell you. Also there is baked Sandesh which is a must try. So if you are new to Kolkata and want to take something home, this is the best thing to take.
Enjoy :-)

Always heard about this place and people used to say that they make sweets like no body else in Kolkata. So last month i wanted to get some "Misti Dahi" for my friend in Mumbai and decided to take it from this place. I repeatedly told them how the sweets would be taken by train (although in an A/c coach) and immediately put into fridge after arrival in Mumbai. They told me that it's their guarantee that the Dahi would stay as it is and wont sour. So i took 6 cups of dahi and got it packed. Once i arrived in Mumbai I immediately put it into the fridge and cooled it. The same evening I handed it over to my friend and the moment she tasted it-she said it has already turned sour. I tasted it to confirm and found that its pathetically gone wrong in terms of taste. Now my question for the management is why do u make wrong commitments when you know the Dahi wont stay-i would have taken some other sweets instead of it then. This seriously brings a bad name to ur brand. I would never recommend ur place to anyone for any kind of sweets. 
Sweets lovers-please visit the outlet of Gupta Brothers which is very nearby, just opposite Balwant singh eating house for a much better taste and more variety of sweets(which doesnt sour and the employees don't make false commitments).

One might find the sweets to be overpriced in comparison to other contemporaries, but trust me every penny of yours is worth to the taste of the sweets and snacks that this place offers. Try to indulge yourself in the chocolate sandesh, chocolate mudpie and baked mihidana. Do give it a shot!

Best place on kolkata to have chocolate sweets, ranges from Sandesh to rosogollas to marzipan or chocolate spoon. All of ther chocolate items are simply awesome. 

Their specially made Cadbury desserts are a treat to have. 

A piece of advice to all enthusiasts visit that place around 5pm in the evening to avail sweets from their offerings, else you may end up choosing from the selected few. Sweets, as I have experienced, flies of their shelves in a jiffy. 

Happy hunting!!!

Been here several times. The store is charming and is always buzzing with a lot of customers inside. The mishtis are genuinely innovative and the best part is they dont stop imagining and combining different tastes.
It will take you a while to decide what you want to have, considering the fact that 2 or 3 mishtis wont satiate your hunger..and you cant afford more than that in a single visit..i suggest you combine snacks and sweets..and make a meal out of it...their snacks section is fortunately cheaper.
They also have seating arrangements inside.so take your lady inside and do try their cakes as well....:)

Balarams' is a very safe choice to order mishti for occassions at home.

Best of luck to the core team.

Yes I have a sweet tooth but also a very selective one. I've been recently going gaga about this one dessert called the 'Nolen gur Souffl√©'  that I had in this shop. I'm still not over how it tasted. Melt in the mouth, that's what it is like. A layer of soft sandesh poured  with delicious gur syrup topped with extremely light and fluffy flavoured cream. 
It's a must have for everyone in this country. Period.

Each item was good.

It was difficult to tell that the Baked Gur Dahi was actually a Fusion version of Dahi.

In one line: "Yummy Delicious Bengali Fusion Desserts"

They have all the reasons for being most crowded stall at the Fest.

Ohkay!!!!

This review has been long overdue, like really long.

First of all thanks to Zomato for giving me a sweet gift voucher for this sweet shop, and me being me, I procrastinated a hell lot and now am finally writing the review which I should have written eons ago.

This sweet shop is a legend, first you'll find yourself looking at the arrays of delicious sweets looking right back at you and deciding which one to start with and then you‚Äôll find yourself shamelessly eating away sweets one after another, forgetting about the diet you‚Äôre going through or the countless hours you spent at the gym burning the calories you put on by, well, shamelessly eating away.

It‚Äôs that GOOD!!

Baked mihidana, baked rossogullas, rossogullas chocolate borfi, kaju borfi, mango mousse, to name a few that originates here is like a heaven in your mouth.

Tried all of the above mentioned sweets and I would thank Zomato with all my heart for introducing me to the Holy Grail of sweets in Kolkata.

If you do want to get a fix for the sweet tooth you have, this branch of Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick Sweets is the best place in Kolkata, hands down, to visit to.

P.S- Only could upload the pictures of the sweets I bought home because I was in a trance while eating there and forgot to click away because it's so FRICKING GOOD!!

Gluttony is not a sin here!This place is not for the weak hearted or the fake sweet eater. Baked Rasogulla, Gud Sondesh & Mishti dohi.. i only manage to somehow find space for these 3 before i pass out into food coma! Its a difficult to reach place with hardly any space inside to stand - despite the size, but all the effort is worth the fruit( er sweet).

My first purchase from this branch and indeed a delightful experience. The place is somewhat difficult to locate and one has to walk some 10 minutes from Paddapukur bus stop. Place is huge and even some seating arrangements are available. Servce is nice and also, price is not high.

Their Choco Bon Bon is simply out of the world and I crave for more each time I have one. Priced @ Rs. 15, it's worth every penny paid!

Also, their gurer kancha gola and ras bhara sandesh is nice.

This outlet is the best BMRM outlet I have visited till date. A must visit place to satisfy your winter sweet cravings!

However, I strongly suggest that all their outlets should have a price tag - i.e. the prices should be displayed along with the items so that customers do not have to keep on
 asking the prices of all items they wish to purchase. 

Cheers!

"BRM"was in my radar for quite sometime and finally I could make it here!!
Mishti at its utter best.. Pick any stuff and forget the whole world.. This is undoubtedly a favorite place among all chocolate mishti lovers..
Since childhood I am die-hard fan of any type of sweets (specially chocolate)
and have tried almost every small, big, med shops ...
Being a bong and if not being there is a serious crime.. ;-) simply awe by the taste.. Established over 120 years ago, BRM has some incredibly sweet history to share and boasts of many royal and eminent Bengali customers...
Their flavoured Sandesh spread out, especially the baked rasogollas are out of the world!! As well as their mango doi is something which acts as a magic to your taste buds...
The rememberence of BRM brings a certain nostalia and a flavour of old Kolkata with it...!!
They come up with the modern twist to the traditional sweets.. So I personally actually the way they mix and match.. Those experiments not just gets the success they also provide satisfaction to each and every sweet toother mouth...

I visited this outlet with my nearbuy voucher were I got sweets worth 200 in rs 99. I packed  the sweets for my home. I took nolen gurer souffle which is 500/kg, baked mihidana @ 450/kg and chocolate mudpie @ 400/kg.
This was the second time I had the baked mihidana. Both the times they had this little sour aftertaste and extremely sweet to begin with. The mud pie was too dry but reason I gave 3.5 was solely for the souffle.  A MUST HAVE for everyone. It was so delicious. You can lick the bowl and still want more. It was amazing.  A bit costly though. 
But I paid half the amount so no complaints from my side. :-)

If I may, I will call it as the best sweet shop in India! you will go gaga over the variety of sandesh, rasagulla and baked sweets. Pure heavenly experience! Bet you cannot have just one.

You would atleast require to go there 50 times to try everything great they are selling! Balaram Mullick take a bow

I was amazed to see the widespread variety of sweets they had on display at this outlet. I guess I put on a few kilos right when I entered the shop. Where do all these sweets go??
We had what the shop is famous for, the baked rosogullas. They were like small soft balls of joy topped with the excellent rabri. It was perfect. The sweetness was balanced, the texture bang on, the rabri too creamy. If the shop is popular for its baked rosogullas across the city, its quite justified. The next thing we had was nolen gur kacha gola. Another delight to add to our experience. So tender, not overly sweet, the favor of nolen gur(jaggery) was so profound and yet so subtle. The texture was chewy, the kind of chewy we look for in chena based sweets.
The malai chamcham is also great, not for the chamcham (which was hard), but for the malai. Mishti doi wasn't up to the mark, maybe because the preceding dishes had increased my expectations way too much. We also tried some snacks like cheese panini and veg patties, both of them were below average. But that should not come in the way of me rating this place a 4, because of the sweets they make, specially the baked rosogullas (the primary motto of our visit). 
Do go if you are in the mood of authentic Bengali sweets.

This is one of the best sweet shops in the city and my all time favorite. This outlet of balaram mullick is the oldest and probably the best outlet. It is located in the lane beside netaji bhavan metro station. I love each and every item they serve. A special mention to their baked rosogolla, baked sondesh and mango doi. These taste irresistably good and u can't afford to miss them. Among snacks their radhaballavi is very tasty and the alurdom they serve with it is great. I recently tasted their chocolate sandesh which I found very tasty. The upper crust is made of chocolate while the filling is of chocolate sandesh !!

I am north kolkatans n sweetaholic....so I ve every right to criticize highly recommended reviews of Balaram mallick sweet shop. Their makha rabri is not at all good compared to Sen Mohasoy of Fariapukur. Baked rosogolla is far better in Chittaranjan of Shyampukur st. Different chocolate sweets r no way better than Nakur Nandi of beadon st. I like best their seasonal sweets,mango doi is all time fav n bonde is must try. it tastes superb. As north kolkatans,where loads of delicious sweet shops r located,i cant rate u guys so high....n please increase ur varieties this winter,all sweets r tasted by every1 already.

The final word when it comes to best quality sweets. This place is the dessert heaven on earth! The variety is endless which ranges from the regular favourites like, sandesh, sweet curd, rasgulla, gulabjamun to seasonal sweets made with fruits and jaggery. However, the ones to die for would be the baked rasgullas and baked mishti doi. You can never get enough of all the wonderful sweets this place has to offer. A must visit!

The best sweet shop in Kolkata, in terms of both quality and price as well. The baked rasogolla, gurer malai chamcham, monda, jalbhara, mango doi and rabri and sitaphal er sandesh, kheer malpoa, sorbhaja are some sweets that everyone must try. And after that, you wouldn't want to go elsewhere for sweets!! All the above sweets are excellent but baked rasogolla is my personal favourite followed very closely by all the others.

The Bhawanipur outlet is their flagship store, they also have a few other outlets in different parts of Kolkata. But their sweets are the same in all and they are just awesome. They are now known for their innovative sweets but they have not abandoned traditional sweets either. Their shops stock all kinds as well as a variety of savouries. Whatever I've had from their outlet has always been great. I've been to their shop on many occasions and my favourites are their baked rasogolla and chocolate sandesh. This Diwali too we got a box of mithai from here and they were excellent, all frnds and family members who had them were all praise for them. One was the coconut dry fruit ladoo which was just too good. In fact there's no complaint about any of their items. But I wish the staff behaviour was better and they were more helpful...sometimes they are simply indifferent to customers. If that changes this place would definitely rate a 5.

1) Ambiance (1/1) : Clean, hygienic, well let, bright, organised and always buzzing with people! Loved the chaos! Look at all the options they offer and you immediately realize that you are in a Sweet Paradise!

2) Food (1/1) : Yummm, innovative and gorgeous! We ordered:

a) BAKED RASOGULLA- ¬†The all time bong favorite dessert with a twist - baked in milk and I cannot tell you HOW AMAZING it tasted! We all ate up 2-3 pieces all at once! Soft, sweet, bolder and now creamy too!

b) RAS BHORA MONDA (Syrup centered sweet) - Medium sized soft sweets with jaggery syrup in the middle! I would have personally liked some more of the filling but what they served - was really yummy!

c) ORANGE SANDESH - Orange shaped (sort of) and flavored Sandesh - amst try for all those who love the traditional sandesh and oranges!¬†

d) CHOCOLATE GANACHE SANDESH - This was the BEST of the lot (no surprises here)! While many have tried to infuse chocolate in desi sweets, these guys have not only done that - they also topped those sweets with the PERFECT CHOCOLATE GANACHE! OH MY GODDD!! Stunning ¬†preparation and it was a total hit in the family of 6 :)

They also have a bakery section (their CHOCOLATE MUD PIES seemed absolutely SINFUL!) which I will try probably in my next trip to Kolkata.

3) Service (1/1): Quick, all the people are helpful and will guide you if needed

4) Innovation/technique (1/1): Baked rasogulla! chocolate ganache sandesh!! Center filled sandesh - I think these guys deserve a huge round of applause for their minds and efforts! Wishing them all the luck!

5) VFM (1/1) : Look up their rates and it is reasonable enough. They definitely deserve all the money they earn, especially after all the hard work they out in! go eat your hearts out here guys! :)

Have been hearing about it from a friend for years. And the decision to try it out once as we were pandal-hopping wasn't a bad idea at all.

We had the chhanar cake which was not too sweet,thus maintaining the cake-ishness. The lyangcha,motichur laddoo,baked rosogolla,everything was made with such perfection.¬†
And the chocolate mishti was the best I've ever had. It basically broke my notion that chocolate and mishti just cannot be a good combination.

Service is nice. The 10-15 minutes we spent there,we could feel the sweet nature of the people working there.
And you don't ask for ambience in a crowded mishti-r dokaan in a city like Kolkata,so no complaints there really. :P

So I am not a fan of Indian sweets. I can never participate in a Roshogulla eating competition with the excitement of gorging on sweets. However, this one destination for sweets keeps me going for more helpings each time. The baked roshogulla is to die for. As well as the chocolate sandesh. As well as the chitrokoot, langcha and baked mihidana. Just mentioning them is making my mouth water. Every time while visiting Kolkata, this place is a must go. The chaos, the flavours, the nostalgia.. it's an experience in itself.

I ended up coming to this place in the quest for 'Dhakai paratha' and these people are the only legitimate food outlet that serve it. Needless to say what a legend of a place this is, dating back to 19th century. Well, the dhakai paratha was indeed a treat, atleast for me who likes to experiment around with food. A flaky rose like structured paratha served with chana dal and sweet chutney. Also it is interesting to note that they've gone insane in terms of experimenting with sweets, be it bengali or the usual indian fare. How? Well they have gelato sandesh, watermelon sandesh, baked rosogolla and what not. Loved the plethora of sweets stacked perfectly in an organised manner. The display is a treat in itself. Should be here very soon to indulge. Cheers!

Their baked rosogolla is simply stunning. Apart from that few things which are a must try r mango doi, choclate mudpie , their own version of the souffle( oh so good!!) , choclate sandesh and their gajar ka halwa.. Apart frm these there r many worth mentioning which didnt make the list but those who are reading the reviews..for these few are a must try...

I am forever in love with this outlet for the most delectable Indian dessert options they present you with. You just go crazy seeing all those sweets in front of you.¬†

Love the ¬†doi, rosogolla, baked rosogolla, kaju barfi, laddu, mihidana, peda, mango doi, komola bhog..........Have tasted around 20 items on the menu and each one is quite different from the other..¬†
The snacks are also very tasty.¬†The best thing about this brand is that apart from the traditional fare, they have an amazing collection of fusion items like choco lava sandesh, choco fudge sandesh and many others, though I have tasted only these two and I love them.¬†

I wish I accomplish my mission of tasting each and every item on the menu ASAP!!!

I found their baked rasgulla a bit too sweet for my taste buds but nevertheless they are worth trying...

Being a south kolkatan, it hurts to praise North for anything(sorry! :P) but sweets are something North Kolkata is famous for and South can never ever win the race but Balaram Mullick definitely gives a tough compitition to its North Kolkata's counterparts and considering its innovation in sweets, mixing international flavours with traditional ones, it is definitely has a high rank..
Bhawanipur is their main branch and that is definitely reflected in the H-U-G-E collection of sweets it has to offer. 

Ambience: It's quite big with a few chair and tables set in one side. It's very clean and somewhere I felt if I drop something they will scold me or something! It was speckless.. A video of how their sweets are made was being shown on a television and I liked the very concept of it :)

Food: I was spoilt for choice and I could have actually had all of them provided the CALORIE was not being counted! :P
We tried the much popular chocolate sandesh and being not a lover of dark chocolate, I didnot like it much. 
We went on to their "invention" Baked Rosogolla. It is Stupendofantabulously awesome! The soft rosogolla served at a perfect warm temperature melts in your mouth and leaves you craving for more!
I am definitely looking forward to trying the other sweets and some namkeens too. 
All in all, do indulge in the sweets of Balaram Mullick..although a bit overpriced,they are heavenly!

This aint a brand which serves just boring sandesh and roshogollas.There's much more to it.They serve an array of mishtis,some traditional ones ans some with twists. I'm not a fn of mishtis.So whever I used to visit with my father,I used to have their fudge brownie with ice cream.And it was super awesome.I don't know whether it's available nowadays.

Balaram's or previously known as Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick is one of the oldest sweet shop in not only Bhawanipore area but also in Kolkata. This outlet is located near Jadubabur bazaar and it was their first outlet ever.Other than Sweets they also have Pastries,Kulfi's and a few Snacks. I love almost all the sweets out here but one should definitely try the chocolate mishti's and Mango Souffl√© :) and yes how can I forget the baked rasgulla :D

Some say even Amitabh Bachhan prefers his sweets from here. 
Located in Jaggu bazaar it has a huge pallete of sweet from sandesh to baked rasgullas and the special Mudpie that is pure chocolate indulgence!!
Also known for its perfectly clean process of manufacturing the sweets and snacks which they display in the tv there.

I guess the biggest brand of Bengali sweets in India. We buy sweets from here since childhood. This place has evolved in itself n redefined the traditional Bengali sweets in modern n dignified way. Best part about this shop is its baked rossogolla, which should be categorized as 8th wonder of this world. Lovely. It's combination with makha sandesh surely going to give a bliss .

This place has the best sweetmeat in town. From the traditional to the experimental, you have it all here. Every time I walk in, there is some or the other new sweet waiting for me to try. And yes I am happy with what I get. However even though the sweets make me happy, the people at the counter are a great repulsion. Very unfriendly and very uncouth. At one point one of them was even dusting the shelves while I sat there eating. At other times, they just can't be bothered to reply to your queries. So even though the sweets do invite, the employees puts me off every time.

Balaram Mullick is the place to get the most delectable, innovative and yummiest bengali sweets in the world. If someone is visiting kolkata then this place has to be at the top of their "TO DO LIST" in kolkata. The place isn't very big, but that is not a matter of concern. What matters the most is the taste of their sweets which by far is the best from anyother place.

From their long list of items in their menu some of the MUST TRYS are the mishti doi, baked rossogolla, rose sandesh, baked sandesh and another type of sandesh that has a filling of some type of  sweet syrup. Even though the place is very famous its prices are quite reasonable.
I wish they open up a shop in hyderabad as well.

Take a bow,the mullicks.At a time when Gupta Brothers had all but wiped out the sweet shops of Kolkata,not only did Balaram Mullick stay on,but did one better,they beat the others on innovative products while retaining the traditional base,a seemingly impossible task.A case in point being the use of chocolate innovatively in traditional products like rasogolla and sandesh.
Their baked sandesh,baked mihidana,the mango doi,the chocolate sandesh,the white sandesh with chocolate inside and the reverse,the list is too long for someone like an explosive sweet tooth like I have but in short,here is my favourite Mistanna Bhandar( sweet shop) in kolkata today.I do not include chandannagar,burdwan and barrackpore when I say kolkata.And I wish them a sweet journey for many more years.
I just wish their service to come with a little more smile.

If you have not been there, then you have missed something known as baked rasogolla and baked mihi dana. If I have to write individual reviews of this place then I think I will take around a month as I visit this place almost every month and its a regular affair for me.

The best is baked rasogolla, and baked mihi dana and please who ever is reading this review Don't miss it when ever you visit this joint. Rest are OK types. I remember having mango kulfi once which was also very nice. I generally don't go for the confectionery items though.

It feels like every sweet is made with a lot of love. Roshogolla is very tasty and some other Sandesh are also quite popular. Actually its very tough to name a specific sweet as all of them are good. You can sit here too. There are some other branches too but Bhowanipore shop is the best. Must Visit if you are nearby.

I find an uncanny urge to visit this sweet shop again and again! Maybe its because of the huuuge display of mouth watering sweets or the LEDs showing how the sweets are made, or simply the heritage of this place. It is located within a minute's walk in the lane just beside Netaji bhavan metro. Being a crowded place, parking is a bit of an issue. And its expensive! More so because the huge spread which inadvertently tells the Bengali heart to keep on buying. Their packaging is very good so there's no worry of bringing it safely back home. Among my favorite, is the Mango gelato sandesh, Lichur payesh and the Manglo souffle. And among the regulars, just any sandesh is good enough specially the chocolate special ones!

It was a very special treat for me as i had got complimentary passes from zomato to snack at this legendary sweet shop.
Finally visited Balaram Mullick & Radharaman on a hot sweltering afternoon when most of Calcutta seemed to be deserted but to my surprise this restaurant located in a small bylane of Bhawanipore was fully packed with orders flying here and there ,workers hustling to serve the customers.
On being asked for their speciality we were told to try out the "Baked Rosogolla" which was realy heavenly with a soft spongy rasogolla layered with malai rabri ,and i felt like keeping on eating but had to try other items too.
"Radha Ballabi" was soft tasty and the rich aloo(Potato Gravy) was cooked authentic bengali style.
The "Veg Samosa" had a modern twist to it and was filled with veggies like capsicum,sweet-corn,baby-corn,carrots etc and had a distinct but subtle taste.
The "Mango" and "Kesar Pista kulfi " both were perfect ,but i personally favour the Mango Kulfi as it had loads of Mango flavour and a tangy twist which really appealed to me and is a must try.
The restaurant also offers a huge variety of Mishti Doi(Sweet Flavoured Curd) and Gelatos which can put other bakeries to shame, and i have vowed to try them soon.
Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick is truly legendary in every aspect and is one of the few still carrying on the traditional bengali culture & cuisine.
I was also surprised to find that the prices were very reasonable compared to the quality and stature of this restaurant and is one of the prime reasons huge number of people flock this sweet shop all around the year.

Had been to this place with a friend who suggested me to try the pineapple pastry but that piece of cake was the most awful bakery item i had ever munched. Had never expected that  level of quality from such a reputed shop. The cake was hard and wasn't fluffy at all. It tasted stale and was excessively sweet which even further rottened the taste.

Being a regular at this place for a very long time (as it's very close to my maternal uncle's house), I was surprised when they introduced the chocolate sandesh. Previously I was a fan of the Nolen Gurer Jol Bhora and the motichoor. And when they offered me the chocolate ones I was a bit skeptical. But once I had those, my perception changed. Balaram had learned innovation. And over the years they have not plateaued. They have tried to beat their own standards, and there in lies the spirit of Balaram - they never settle. Recently they had opened few other outlets. I have had the opportunity to visit the Ballygunge one. Sadly, the Kathi Gauja I bought did not taste fresh. That was my last visit to that outlet. From then onwards, if I have the cravings for the Miss Cadmish or the Jolbhora or the motichoor or the strawberry sandesh, I go to the mother shop at Bhawanipore. Balaram also sells wonderful Cheera Bhaja. Do try these as they are the best in Kolkata and safe enough for my 85 year old grandmom. My request to Balaram would be to continue their magic and never be complacent because of their success.

So I am born with the appetite for sweets ... This place is one of the many places I go for a selection if sweets. But what I find intresting everytime I am there is there are so many people from all sorts of region and bloodlines in this tupically bengali sweet shop that its hard to get your order in less than 20 to 25 mins on any average occassion. The improvisationa nd sweet behAviour definetly adds in benefits. I love the baked rosogolla, roso malai, nolen gurer sweets and also fall fr the new age sweets . The malpoa is slightly high on sweet for people who r not sweetoholic. Try haveing portions of myptiple things when u r there and make sure u go back for the other varities as well.

If I am not mistaken this is their oldest and most popular shop in Kolkata. 
Well most of the Bengalis swear by their sweets and for good reason why. 
Some of their signature sweet dishes like baked Rosogolla, nolen gurer souffl√©, kheer doi is top notch. 
They have got no competition from other sweet shops when it comes to authentic Bengali desserts with a twist. 
Also there collaboration with Cadbury dairy milk has resulted in some mouth watering chocolate Sandesh. 
For every occasion they have some sweet delicacy with a twist..but I wait for the winter to set in for their out of the world PATISAPTA! They don't make like them anywhere else in the world. 
Everytime I am there I can't decide on a particular sweet, I go inside thinking I will buy this and end up buying a lot more than what I imagined. I love their sweets and I don't think they have any competition with any other sweet shops. Period! If in Kolkata this one is a must try for all!

The sweets they provide were just simply delicious. Don't miss their Mango Curd & Baked Rosogolla. Also they are the pioneers of the chocolate sandesh in Kolkata, which is a must try for all choco lovers. 

I found price is bit high, but the quality they provide, im satisfied with it.

However, very poor customer service. Specially if you are a first timer there.

P.S. This is their main branch.

The sweets are alright. Location is extremely bad. You have to be on foot to purchase anything from their outlet. The artificial flavouring in their sweets have gradually started increasing. Worst of all are their cashiers. Unless you have exact change they will not speak to you properly and will more often than not misbehave.

One of the legendary names in the city. Wide variety and supreme quality of sweets. Not being a sweet fan, I have not tasted all of their delicacies but I liked whatever I tasted. My personal favourites are their baked rosogolla and aam doi. Long live.

I am a big fan of Balaram Mullick and I make it a point to visit their outlet frequently but after my experience today I will never visit their outlets and would request people not to get their sweets. I saw two cockroaches on the strawberry sandesh and the same sandesh was being given to customers.

Here is the thing. Two kinds of people exist. Those who have been to balaram mullick and those who will go there. I wouldn't go to describe the sweets and their specialties because that would be a grave injustice to the others because every sweet in itself is a little slice of heaven. You've got to sink your teeth into one to understand the biochemistry of sugar and innate human happiness. As that rich taste fills you up with radiant happiness you realize what heaven truly feels like. Statutory warning. The heart's content doesn't apply here because somehow I am never contended, and less spoken about my heart the better. The sublime delight of each and every sweet on display is beyond words. Maybe tha@t's what authors meant by saying certain things can only be felt and not described. Try them on your most depressing days. They work better than the best anti depressants.

They are the pioneers of the chocolate sandesh in Kolkata. They are slowly divulging to kind of sweets which are unheard of but are a very refreshing fusion of east&west ... Like chocolate sandesh souffle... All of their sweets are must try.

Kolkata diaries - the sweet tooth

If you aren't a local resident... Its tough to find !
So TIP: it's near the Khalsa school! 
I was recommended that this place had the best sweets and guess what happened? 
Turns out they have great vegetarian fried foods too!!!!
Location: 
A little hard to find but if called they are helpful.
Too tiny a street so taxi walas blatantly refuse or take you around on weird roads.
Foods:
The sweets were just amazingly delicious.
The mishti doi in all its glory kept me wanting more of it! So much that I wanted to carry it back to Mumbai.
The rasgullas were tasty but the sandesh however was a bit muddy and the choco filled one turned out to have no filling.
The paneer fry was just so well flavored and spicy that nothing compares!
Price: 
A teeny weeny bit expensive as compared to a few sweet marts . Nevertheless they deliver what we pay for.
Customer service:
Initially they weren't so friendly, but then this really friendly lady came and explained what the dishes were and was super courteous.
Flaws:
Other than the location , the only other flaw was that every time you want something new, you have to go to the counter to buy the coupon , which is annoying if you are new.

Overall:
Awesome!!!! A must visit! Delicious mishti doi ! *a memory I carry home.

They are one of the best & the oldest in the sweet business with branches all over the city. This one is located at jadubabu bazar, nearby to the Netaji Bhawan metro station. You must pay a visit to this place. The sweets are delicious but my personal recommendation would be to try the pastries & the mud-pie! Though the staff & management is unfriendly, hence -0.5

Another visit: Thanks to Zomato for the gift coupon; enjoyed a variety of delicacies like mud-pie, pineapple pastry, mishti doi & choco-cup! The pineapple pastry was a little hard/stale, other desserts being just perfect!

Undoubtedly one of the best sweet shops in kolkata, Balaram Mullick needs no introduction. They expertise in fusion sweets adding their own punch to the traditional taste and no doubt they do it with style. If anyone alive has still not tasted their baked rosogolla, baked mihidana or the chocolate fudge they are definitely missing on something out of the world.

I have been to this sweet tooth joint since I was a toddler.Never mind the people who own the shop,every time I pass by this place I feel that a magnet is pulling me towards it.
Even the manager of this place knows my entire family,much owing to the fact that whenever we have guests coming over to our place,they will get a sweet treatment to Balaram Mullick's sweets.

I really fall short of words if I have to describe the essence and glamour that is associated with this place.Every Tollywood star has been here and it is located in one of the posh neighborhoods of Calcutta.

If you are a first timer,well then simply follow these guidelines.I'm sure after a month or two you'll be dwelling on a better idea about Calcutta's sweets.

1) Mishti Dahi- offer one packet to the god/ goddess you are worshiping on a special day.Also meant for the guests at your residence during a small gathering.They will always beg you for another platter of it.

2)Chomchom-I have enjoyed this sweet so much so that the owner adds in an extra two or more when I order it.The most magnificent and well crafted sweet of Balaram Mullick.

3)Mihi Dana-Try hitting the joint in the early  of the day,and bag 100g of this sweet.It will make your Sundays even more sweeter.

4)Rabdi-This is one sweet that gives you the real taste of a Sourav Ganguly's sixer.You cannot ask for more.If you want to add something special to your post dinner sweet tooth,this is the ideal one to pick up.

5)Chocolate Sandesh-Burns a hole in your pocket.Try not to have it much,but if it's for your first date,impress her with this gala treat.The molten chocolate is like a royal kick.

Having said so much I really miss this place a lot.But accounting for my best times in Calcutta,this sweet joint and me go a long long way back.They have maintained their standards for ages and I'm sure they will make it even more bigger in the ages to come.
This one truly deserves a 5/5.

Like every other trends , the traditional Bengali sweets have undergone a change of flavours like none other. From strawberry to custard apple , and the newest member - chocolate, all have been incorporated in sweets. While some may have lost their way, Balaram Mullick and Radharam Mullick have excelled and created their own niche. From traditional to modern, every fusion of flavours have its fan among the Kolkatans. The "Chocolate Sandesh" , " Rash-bhara talshash " , " Aam doi ", are some of my personal favourites. The prices ranges from Rs. 15 to Rs. 80 per piece. But trust me every penny you spend here is worth it. The traditional sweets are served in earthen plates especially the "Aam Doi " , only to add to the feeling. For anyone who hasn't been here its a must visit , and well for traditional Bengali sweet tooths its a tradition we DONOT wish to loose at any cost.

Bengali misti with modern makeover - Balaram has kept its legacy of making fine sweets for ages. There are few things a Bengali should eat once in life is their BAKED ROSOGOLLA and BAKED MIHIDANA . I never had anything like these before. The KULFI is too fatafati and so is their SOUFFLE. The DHOKLA is tender and a bit on the sweeter side. They also make fine confectionery. Price is bit on the higher side but is worth it. Sweet lovers beware ...... you just might become a diabetic .

Located nearby "netaji bhawan" metro station. "Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick" is one of the leading and most popular sweet joints in town. They have multiple number of outlets all over Kolkata. This "Bhawanipur" outlet is one of its busiest one and definitely one of the vastly stocked one as well when it comes to the variety of their offerings. This outlet is delicately decorated and has an elegant touch, it is decently spacious and also offers sitting accomodations too. The complete area is squeaky clean and the ambience is perfect enough to indulge yourself into your sweet cravings. The complete store has separate counters for different types of sweets like- chena sweets, ghee sweets, dry fruit sweets, fried sweets, gut sweets, chocolate fusion sweets, pastries etc; everything is evenly organized into separate sections. They offer a huge variety of succumbing sweets both traditional like-(talsash, barfi, laddoo, gaja, sandesh, lyangcha, gulabjamun, rabri etc;) as well as modern fusion delicasies like ( various types of chocolate sweets, fruit flavored sandesh etc;). Their snack savories are one of the best and mouth watering as well, especially their "dhoklas" are just mesmerizing and just melts inside your mouth. Specially during this winter season, the special offerings like- various types of "pithes", "patishapta"(Indian pancakes), malpoha, dudh puli, etc; are definitely worth trying. Overall one of the best sweet outlets in town serving a wide range of sweets and savories and definitely worth a try.

This is one of the legendary sweet shops in Kolkata. They are always crowded and loaded with orders because of its popularity. Their aam doi is very popular and so as their baked rosogolla. But I personally dont like the amshotto they use in Aam doi but overall its good in taste. The baked rosogolla was also soft and creamy. Prices are good and quality used in top-notch.

Have been hearing about this place since a really long time and was excite and ecstatic at the same time to visit it considering its one of the most celebrated sweet shops in the city. The place is quite spacious but the staff is horrible. They won't listen to you at all and carry on their gossiping or move around here and there on the counter. If by any chance they even listen to you, it's of no use as they won't reply to your queries about the contents of the sweet over the counter. The sweets seem to be a bit overpriced. Have had chocolate sandesh, rosogullas, misthi doi, and many other sweets here and they are not that bad. Very much edible. But the Overall experience is really bad. Pity. Disappointed.

I wish they would come up with a store outlet sonewhere down south, Tollygunge area, so that I have more frequent access to one of the best sweet shops in town!

This is one of the outstanding sweet/mishti shops I would love to visit, and always! They've sustained their quality, presence and image right at the apex! I visited their cafe-like store in Bhawanipore and I returned back happy and stuffed!

Firstly, I ate those big, round.. erm Dhoklas :P
Served with 3 chuteys and grated coconut, works absolutely fine!

I took Baked Mango Mishti Doi, tastes like mangoes thawed with cream and baked, delicious indeed. Tried their baked Rassagullas which are served with a Thick creamy syrup, delectable indeed - I packed a whole dozen home! Yes!

More on the list which you must try are - the Sandesh kulfi, so creamy it melts in mouth, with crunchy dry fruits they've as a surprise. Fab! And I also ate Chocolate Sandesh and the regulars! 

Service: 3/5

Brief: Balaram Mullick had been on my wishlist since a long long time. My mother got a takeaway from here which comprised of Dhokla's. Please don't ask me about the location and ambience as i personally did not visit it but just a takeaway was done from this place.¬†

As far as the Dhokla is concerned, it was soft and mouth melting. I probably felt that after parceling dhokla's it might get stiff. However, it was not the case. The chutney served along with it complimented it real well.¬†

Conclusion:
I would visit it soon and talk about the ambience and the service. :)

Two words. Gur Souffle. Probably the only place in Calcutta that serves sweets with a delightful twist and treat. The first time I visited this place I ended up spending almost 800 rupees on sweets. Had Gur Souffle, Chocolate brownie or something they call - I can't quite remember and all I was left was to pack at least 250gms each for home. The baked rasgulla and a host of other stuff. Amazing sweet paradise!

One of a the Finest Sweet & Snack shop of Kolkata and pocket friendly too. Dinning Area is too small to accommodate groups. Mouth watering delicacies all around. Overall its a good restaurant to enjoy with friends and family.

This is one of the outstanding sweet/mishti shops I would love to visit, and always! They've sustained their quality, presence and image right at the apex! I visited their cafe-like store in Bhawanipore and I returned back happy and stuffed!

Firstly, I ate those big, round.. erm Dhoklas :P
Served with 3 chuteys and grated coconut, works absolutely fine!

I took Baked Mango Mishti Doi, tastes like mangoes thawed with cream and baked, delicious indeed. Tried their baked Rassagullas which are served with a Thick creamy syrup, delectable indeed - I packed a whole dozen home! Yes!

More on the list which you must try are - the Sandesh kulfi, so creamy it melts in mouth, with crunchy dry fruits they've as a surprise. Fab! And I also ate Chocolate Sandesh and the regulars! 

Service: 3/5
Food: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5
Value for Money: 3.5/5

Brief: Balaram Mullick had been on my wishlist since a long long time. My mother got a takeaway from here which comprised of Dhokla's. Please don't ask me about the location and ambience as i personally did not visit it but just a takeaway was done from this place.¬†

As far as the Dhokla is concerned, it was soft and mouth melting. I probably felt that after parceling dhokla's it might get stiff. However, it was not the case. The chutney served along with it complimented it real well.¬†

Conclusion:
I would visit it soon and talk about the ambience and the service. :)

My favourite sweet shop in kolkata. Although it remains crowded whenevr i visit and there is a lot of chaos in the shop, still it does not looses its quality and standard of sweets. The baked rasogolla, souffle, and kulfi sandesh, mousses and pastries, aam doi are a great turn on for me. Not only the sweets but also the radhaballavis, sandwiches, chops and pakoras are delightful. And moreover what attatracts me towards this shop is the decorations. This place is creatively decorated in every occassion :)

Yes my first visit to the one and only Balaram Mallick Radharaman Mallick and i must say the shop is filled with sweets and sweets... the oldest of the chains¬†The varieties of sweet makes you get confused as what to buy or what not. The corner most section of the shop where i found the namkeen section where food items like that kachauri and sabzi cutlets chops and etc items are available there ...

Though not a place where you can sit and indulge every delicacies .. still they kept spaces for sitting arrangement

OH THE BIG THING¬†They also happens to serve bakery items like that of pastries mostly strawberry,chocolate and mango flavoured hoping to go there again and try it out... the good thing about this shop also is the bad thing .....located in highly populated gujrati and punjabi locales the sweet will make heart melt but for somebody who has sweet tooth a too many for them it might not just be enough¬†


But i will give a THUMBS UP!! for the brilliance of aroma of ghee and smoothness of chhana that once put upon the mouth it just melt down touching the heart never before like ..also...

I would recommend that if are looking for good quality sweet tend not to think of the sweet taste and style just enjoy the aroma of ghee and NOM NOM NOM!!!Specially for the first timers

One fine evening, I was introduced to this sweet shop by my best friend and thus, began my love affair with the store! I don't have a sweet tooth, rather I have sweet teeth. So, whenever I visit Kolkata, my Dad always stocks the fridge with their sweets. Their twists on the traditional Bengali sweets blows your mind. The gooey mango pulp that oozes when you scoop out a spoonful of Aam Doi, the sensation you have when that first bite of warm Chocolate Mudpie is in your mouth, the Baked Rosogolla with its burnt and creamy taste will make you fall in love with sweets all over again. My favourite is the Mango Gelato Sandesh which is mango flavoured makha sandesh with real pieces of mangoes in it. Their recent invention, the Paturi Sandesh, is extraordinary. And their chocolate sweets have always been a hit among my Non-Bengali friends. Seriously people, if you are a sweet-lover, this is your paradise.

Bengali & Mishti are inseparable. And when it comes to a wide array of great tasting Fusion Sweets, Balaram's does it in style.¬†
They are the best innovators in their industry. Their first & most famous invention being the Baked Rosogolla.¬†
Must try: Mango Gelato (Seasonal), Nolen Gur Souffle (Seasonal), variety of Soft Sandesh, Custard Apple Kheer, Kulfi Sandesh, Chhanar Malpoa topped with Rabri and dont miss out Poyodhi - the ancient version of Mishti Doi, much thicker & tastier than the Mishti Doi.

Born in Kolkata I know the ultimate cold-mishti-war of south Kolkatar mishti versus north Kolkatar. 

Everyone has a different story and justification to support. My family always supports north kolkata sweets because its my 'mamar badi' and of course they are loyal to the point that they pledged never to have sweets from south.



I have had sweets all my childhood from NAKUR NANDI, BHIM NAG, SUBODH MULLICK, LOKENATH and of course GHOSH & Co. Marwari/North Indian dry kaju mishti had very little place amidst all these sweet marvels.¬†



Things have changed now and I decided to hunt for the best sweet. One fine day I went to Balaram. I never expected an AC; glass walled very neat Bengali sweet shop. I thought it never existed but then again you see KC DAS but then again I have hardly visited, though have tasted their sweets but seeing Balaram I felt really good.


First Impression is it a sweet shop or chocolate shop. I knew it‚Äôs famous for chocolate sandesh but c'mon chocolate sandesh is way too simplified to express their creation. It‚Äôs quite like visiting The Chocolate Room (TCR). I have tasted almost all of them but i ma not a very big chocolate sandesh fan hence I never got that feeling but definitely tremendous lateral thinking done.

Then I decided to go for their baked rasgulla. Simply WOW. Awesome taste, Looks great, Tastes even better than it looks. I end up buying this almost every time I'm here. 


Let me tell you here that i've still not described their most wonderful creation; yes it‚Äôs hands down there Rasamalai/Rasmalai. It is the creamiest and most delicious rasamalai I've ever had in my entire young life. Its a must have here no doubt. I pack a kilo every time I'm here.


The not so good attempt is there Rabdi, which is too much like having sweet malai. Bhikharam and Lokenath make it much better.
 The baked doi is also not very special but you can try it definitely and judge it yourself.


It was groom kaal i.e. summertime so I also decided to have their mango souffl√© sandesh. It‚Äôs definitely a commendable attempt. 

As I was proceeding towards their payment counter something absolutely strange tall conical cup thing in a mini fridge caught my attention. I decided to try it. Its their norom paak caramelized and a definitely something that you can gorge on your way back home without worrying about your hands getting messy and sticky.
Pocket Pinch: I end up buying a lot of stuff so I'm not the perfect one to rate on that. HAHA¬†

So now coming to the conclusion North vs. South Kolkata sweets. I must say north Kolkata sandesh has no comparison but certainly I have to taste other confectioners in south before i can perfectly declare something.
In the end its all about taste and I think every shop is famous for at least one thing in particular and if you are a foodie then you know you will travel anywhere to get that particular taste. For me its Baked Rosogolla and Rasmalai at Balaram.¬†


The parking is definitely a problem but if you can just spare that trouble you will land into this south Kolkata marvel. 

Sweets of Kolkata are hands down best; I cannot imagine a place, which makes better sweets like Kolkata both sandesh and dry sweets.¬†

Food Quote:
"Men have come, Men have tasted, and Men have rested in peace. Kolkata Sweets, Kolkata Sweets, Kolkata Sweets Indeed"

Just remembering them makes my mouth watering. It is very difficult to control yourself once you enter this shop. Recently they have opened a branch at Kasba also. They change their sweets as per the season and it is a treat to both eyes and taste buds.

Bengali Sweets are always the best and Balaram Mullick is the silver edge of the genre. Kolkata or I should say visiting India is incomplete if you have not tasted the delicacies. Currently they are also selling special World Cup Football Sweets, so new. I would visit them again very soon.

Not a single thing shy of amazing. If you have a sweet tooth, welcome to heaven. If you don't have a sweet tooth, be prepared to develop a sweet tooth and then go to heaven. Seriously, the best sweets ever. I went to try their summer special mango sweets. Starting off with their ‚ÄòAam Doi‚Äô, that was truly one-of-a-kind. For one, they are absolutely gorgeous to taste at with awesome flavours. But I have to say, I was stumped by the ‚ÄòMango Chanar Brulee‚Äô. Mango Chanar Brulee was baked mango pudding in a glass having real mango at bottom and a small rasgulla in middle. Real mango at the bottom of the glass was an awesome surprise, very very innovative. The detail and effort that goes into each sweets was impressive. Their seasonal menus were always changing so it's always wonderful to try something new. Their Mango Gelato Sandesh was so fruity, just unimaginable creation. They are dense and rich. They have something for everyone. Some of my favourites include the Aam Doi, Mango Chanar Brulee and the Mango Gelato Sandesh. They just elevate their already amazing sweets to a whole other level. Every sweet I have, I never want it to end.

We trust this place as family so much that my father relied on them for the sweets that were sent along with my wedding trousseau. Apart from the sandesh (made specially for the purpose with names inscribed), the rabri and mishti doi too were highly appreciated. They put those in containers in the shape of tabla and baya, and made a visual treat that appealed to all aesthetically. Of course, no one ever had any doubt about the taste when the package was from Balaram Mullick. If you have similar plans, remember to place order before hand. Apart from picking up sweets on display every now and then, come summer, we are a big fan of their mango doi.

The Bhawanipur outlet is huge and one is spoiled for choices. The video playing showcases the automation and is very inteteresting too. Balaram has made a name for itself and has highly advanced in this art.

The other sandesh are bit expensive but taste is superb(am sandesh, butter schotch,black current).
And Baked rasogolla is always taste best in town.
Kaju barfi and rasogolla -- are equally good .
Snacks--probably not the best place.

I decided to visit balaram Mullick sweet shop bhowanipore branch a day before easter Sunday since I heard so much about this shop from my wife. Well first of all I did not find the place so easily although it was on the main road of jaggu bazar. I guess if the shop could be lighted up a bit it would have been better. Anyways on entering the shop I was amazed to see the variety of sweets meats available ranging from the baked rassogolla to the chocolate sandesh the mango dahi at the far corner of the shop was the sweet meat that attracted me and I decided to taste it. And to be honest I was not disappointed the least it is something really worth eating and also those awesome chocolate sandesh which simply melts in your mouth... There was another strawberry sandesh but this i felt was a bit on the dry side and I don't recommend that sweet. The barfi and the baked rasogolla that mr mallick had given me to taste that had come straight from his factory deserves a mention it was really good. The deco was satisfactory neat and clean place. Would certainly go there again for those mango dahi and chocolate sandesh...

Since it is "gorom kaal" (summer season), my father wanted me to get the "aam doi" from Balaram Mullick, because they make it best. While at the shop, I also got hold of some norom paak sandesh and roshogolla. They packed everything carefully, and after returning, my father went at it like a maniac. Of course, I was there to accompany him in the demolition squad, and around 150/- worth sweets were over in 10 minutes. Of course, we are both hanging our heads in shame now.

When you talk about clear division of the legacy of bengali sweets in Kolkata between North and South Kolkata, the sweet shops in North Kolkata would beat their southern counterparts by a dozen. But among the few sweet shops in Southern Kolkata who can compete with their northern counterparts - Balaram Mullick and Radharaman Mullick would top the list. An old shop situated right in the Bhawanipur Jadu Babus Bazaar near Khalsa High School holds its supreme flag high. The shop is well decorated and not like the usual "mishtir dokaan" of Kolkata. The legacy have given birth to "Balarams" who apart from sweets specializes in bengali/Gujarati snacks as well as eggless cakes/pastries.
Coming to the sweets - 
The chocolate sandesh, pineapple sandesh, sandesh paturi, strawberry sandesh, jolbhora are excellent. Their rosogolla is also superb with the premium quality getting tin packed for international travel. The bhapa doi, aam doi and baked rosogolla are also excellent. 
In their snacks section, the radha ballavi, paratha, dhokla and fried veg items are good. The eggless cakes and pastries are also very nice.
One late addition to menu is "Nolen Gurer Souffle" which is introduced around 2 years back. This is a feast for a sweets lover and the taste cannot be expressed in words.
The price for all items are on the higher side.
I would rate this joint as 4.5 due to their taste, ambience and quality of food.

I have been visiting this place since I was a kid and my family has been a valued customer of Balaram Mallick since the very beginning of their journey !!!!! Being a bong , I have an insane craving for Mishti .. be it Sandesh or 'Rosher Mishti' !!! I have seen them transform from the 'PARAR' mishtir dokan to the Modern day Mishti entrepreneur !!!! It is part of the HERITAGE of Bong's 'Mishti' culture !!!

If you are at BM....then the one thing that you must blindly order is their Mango Doi !!! Its the best in class !!! No other sweet shop can match its taste and quality !! The next thing to lay your tempting eyes on is their range of Chocolate Sandesh !!!There is a lot of variety in this section and the perfect union of Our CHOKOLATE and our  bong SANDESH !!!! And of course...your mishti treat cannot be complete without theRoshalo Baked Rosogolla !!

Other than mishti......they maintain their high standards in the 'NONTA' section toooo !!!! My grandmother is a big fan of their Cantonese chowmein and their chilli paneer is also owesme !!!!

In recent time,they have also ventured into the bakery street and their chocolate mud pie cake is a must try !!!

So....I am giving this mishti shop a full 5 stars...beacuse not only their mishti appeal to my taste buds...but also this shop is a part of my bong soul and my childhood !!!!!!!!!!

I have visited this particular branch only once. That time I had to take a guest to a Kolkata heritage sweetshop and my office specifically instructed me to take this gentleman to this particular shop. This is the oldest and main branch of this chain of sweet shops. 

I am sad to say that I was disappointed. I had reached at around 10.30-11.00 am and although the place was crowded, there were just not enough variety of sweets. I wanted to buy jaggery rashullas and sandesh. There was just one type of jaggery rasgulla and it was not the soothing jaggery rasgulla available in good Kolkata shops. It was just too sweet for my comfort and not soft enough. I am not ready to pay Rs 15 for a rasgulla if it does not taste that good.

What I really did enjoy n this shop were several varieties of the chocolate sandesh. It was simply amazing to taste and I would definitely go there again for the Sandesh.

They bring all their food in through their Tavera 6458 from a kitchen located nearby. Sweets, snacks are delicious. The pastry counter, however, does not fit in. My favourite is Samosa. Radha ballabhi is sometimes good, sometimes not. Decently priced at 20bucks for two samosas. They are famous for their sweets.

Perhaps my favourite sweet shop. I remember going to this place as a toddler (or may be I am reminded by my parents of that :) )
Not sure if this place is going to fit in the heritage list of Kolkata but then BALARAM MULLICK & RADHARAMAN MULLICK has been there in the business for quite some time. I guess this is the flagship outlet of the chain of sweet shops. Located near Khalsa High School (the lane beside Jadu Babu's Bazaar), the business has come a long way from being a normal standalone shop selling only cult Bengali sweets to a swanky air conditioned sweet shop with fusion sweets and egg less confectionery on offer as well. 

My favourite was always the special Darbesh (a soft variant of Laddoo topped with Kheer and half cashew nuts). They have also come up with Choco Golla (an innovative Roso Golla dipped in chocolate syrup), which is a hit with everyone but I do not like it that much. The Baked Roso Golla tastes damn good. :) 
The Nolen Gurer Sandesh is definitely a must try during the winter season. Do try their norom paker sandesh (Soft dough based sweet) which is melt-in-your-mouth good ! 
Its been few years that they have started an egg less confectionery in the store itself. Black Forests, Truffle cakes, pineapple cakes, you name it and you can have it. And they taste real good. This joint is a dream haven for vegetarians with a sweet tooth. Apart from all this you can also try the snack items like samosa, kachori,etc. Frankly speaking I am not too fond of these and I stay glued to this sweet shop for the sweet delicacies ! :D
I would have rated this a 4.5 or a 5 but I will have to deduct a point for the high prices. A normal sized sweet costs Rs15-20. Also the quality of Darbesh (my favourite) has deteriorated ! :( 
A  4 from my end ... definitely a must try !

Kolkata, if not others, is known for its sweets specially the chenna sweets. But if you want traditional and authentic bengali sweets with a twist then Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick is your go to shop. Inspite of being born and brought up in Kolkata I never had a sweet tooth. Maybe because of my Rajput descent I get baffled when I see meat. But that doesn't even compare with the reverence my friends have for sweets. And yes us kolkatans do swear by our sweets. ButI have to say the moment I enter BRM the Kolkatan in me takes over and I simply can't resist the sweets.

A place that is one of the older sweet shops of kolkata frequented by Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee himself Balaram Mullick has reinvented itself in recent years and has carved a niche for itself. Yes they have the traditional rosogolla but they also have a baked rosogolla which is to die for. Balaram's very own take on mihidana is their baked mihindana which is equally delectable. Mishti doi which has become synomous with kolkata has been given a twist by them. The mango doi which is sweetened curd with mango pulp at  the base is simply amazing. But the one thing that is unique to this place and is kind oftheir specialty is the sandesh souffle which is souffle with crushed sandesh. Besides they have a wide array of chocolate sandesh all of which are equally heavenly.

They also have a confectionery segment and make numerous eggless cakes. The mudpie they make there is just too good to be true.

Besides they have a snacks and chat segment. The radhaballavi they make us another of my favourite. And a surprise element they have is the chowmein they serve.

Coming to favs at balaram they have to be the rasmalai (Rs300/kg) the bonde ( Rs 300/kg) and the mudpie (Rs500/kg). The bonde here is too good and has a distinct crunch not seen anywhere.

If you ask me balaram is certainly a top notch confectionery that can proudly be put on the global map. Then why the .5 deduction well just because sweets are not my favourite and it is by no fault of their own.

One of the very old traditional Bengali sweet shops,this place has come back into the limelight largely thanks to the popular cadbury chocolate mishti competitions.This place has won many accolades for its chocolate mishti products and once you taste them you will certainly understand why.The chocolate sandesh is surely up there with the best if not the best.The chocolate mud pie is also excellent.
Other than these,being one of the oldest traditional Bengali sweet shops,this place stays true to the traditions and provides authentic,quality,traditional Bengali sweets like jolbhora sondesh,rosogolla,bode,pantua,kalo jam and everything else one can think of.
This place has also evolved with time and provides new types of innovative yet popular items like baked rosogollas,bhapa doi etc.Their kaju barfi is also one of my favourites.Overall this place offers all types of sweets one can possibly wish for.
The place also serves snacks like singaras,kachoris,sandwiches,chowmein etc.Even these are quite decent.But this is certainly not the place for such snacks.I would surely recommend satisfying your appetite with the vast array of options for sweets.
There is seating arrangement for about 10 people.It is air conditioned and quite clean and hygienic.But it remains crowded and busy at most times of the day and one can understand why.
Location wise also it is quite convenient.It is about 3-5mins walk through the busy market along the lane beside Netaji Bhawan metro.
The one area where the place can improve is by increasing the space inside and providing more seating arrangements.
The service is okay and the prices are slightly high.But one just doesnt get quality at cheap rates these days.So it is quite understandable and acceptable.
All in all,this is a place worth recommending.And,if you have a sweet tooth,its a Must!

Balaram Mallick..I was in search of this place for a very long time.. specially since the city had a chocolate mishthi festival in progress..I decided to venture out and taste some of the new and authentic sweets across town.. Balaram Mallick was one of them..infact the first.. the best way to reach this place would be to get down in Netaji Bhavan metro station and walk straight right to the first lane that comes once you are out of the station...
Its little tricky to find specially when this place is covered with a busy market throughout the day...but then after walking for maybe 5 to 7 minutes..you would see this place..(quite large and spacious).. Once you enter and start browsing through the sweets..one surely gets taken aback with the unique sweets that are in display..
the first time i went i remember having some of the chocolate sweets..one among them i still remember, Mrs. Cadmish, and there as another one which looked like a choco ball..Mrs Cadmish which costs around Rs. 20 was  such a delight.. Shaped like a heart..it had a white sugary coating outside of a complete thick crust of chocolate inside...the whole sweet was quite filling...the second one which i remember as Choco Ball was equally good..One bite and you immediately see a choco burst out from inside..just delicious...price the same..aint that good..

Then i went on to try their Bhapa(fried) Rosogolla, Bhapa Doi.. Mango Mousse, Choco Kheer.. Aloo Kachuri..and Aam Poraa..
At the end of this sweet fiesta..i was compelled to call it a day and stop asking for more.. instead i ordered some more of BHapa Rosogolla and Mrs Cadmish as a take away.. :) 

I had a discussion with some of the sweet lovers that day who like me had traveled from diff parts of the city just to taste these sweets.. Kudos to them to innovate and experiment the Age old trend of Shondesh and Rosogollas.. to give it a more Modern look..Sweets over here are like "remix" of the original ones..

One bad thing which i noted was the seating arrangements, it was quite small.. But then this aint that much of a problem for a sweet shop were people are always open to stand near the sweets that sitting far away..

I've had little exposure to the large mishti establishments in North Kolkata. Balaram Mullick was my first foray into this world. And by God, was it marvellous !! Although the chocolate mishtis they make are stunning and have commanded more than 1 prize in the various Chocolate - Mishti competitions, I'd like people to pay more attention to the traditional sweets they produce. Those are irreplaceable. The variety of sandesh, both the 'roshbhora' as well as 'shokto' variants are mindblowing to say the least. Plus what you also get is a cool,clean ice cream parlour like ambience with even a few seats. Something you'd generally not expect in a mishtir dokan  :)

My jaw hit the ground when I heard they also served Chowmein and Dhosas. I mean Seriously !!!! With no disrespect towards the non bengali community who also frequent the place, I'd point out that they had started serving northern/ continental snacks in the form of chaats, paratthas and pav bhajis before but this is plain and simple stupid. Same goes for the sandwitches which however are delightful. But I would hope that they stick to the tamer and more in line Singara and Alur Dom. Some things should never change.

Chakraborty Tip : I was however a bit dissapointed by the staff on one count. The popular legend has it that Sir Asutosh Mukherjee regularly made a trip to the shop n search of one or two of his favourite mishtis. On asking the staff (mind you, i asked the old ones, not the young of age ) I got blank looks in reply as to which were the two mishtis. This and other questions about the shop's heritage went unanswered. :(

If one has to define a perfect product mix-in Marketing Parlance then this sweet shop has got it bang on target. Balaram & Radharaman Mullick have embarked on a journey of fusion sweets with great success  without compromising on the age-old traditional Bangali mishti. This is one shop which always replenishes its stock of sweets and you will never come across empty space in the shelves.Among the traditional sweets-rosogolla,langcha,pantua,bonde(boondiah),doi are awesome.In the new age segment items like chocolate sandesh,baked rosogolla,aam doi(mango flavour), flavours like strawberry,mango,vanilla etc and the egg less pastries are also very good.
They also have a section which serves vegetarian snacks like dosas, chole bature,chops,samosas,radhaballavi etc .These items are pretty tasty and sell like hot cakes throughout the day.
On the flip side, the prices of sweets have  increased over the last couple of years and their sizes have diminished.The behaviour of the staff can be a bit offensive and rude at times.
Overall no bangali social event is complete without a dose of "sweet magic" from Balaram Mullick. Highly recommended!!!

My first visit to this iconic place which caters to the rich and the famous. The glass door boasts of patrons such as Lakshmi Mittal and Tendulkar. The glass door also writes about the sweets that Lakshmi Mittal missed out on such as, Jol bhora sondesh and nolengurer souffle, and those were the first things I wanted to try.
The nolen gurer souffle was a winter sweet and so was unavailable. The jol bhora sondesh (water filled sweetmeat) had very little jol to speak of but nonetheless quite tasty .It was like a very high class norom pak (soft bengali sweet).
This place boasts of such twist in tradition sweets such as baked rosogolla, which is a hiy with the old and the new. The kids and chocolate lovers can try the chocolava sondesh and the chocolate bonbon sondesh. We had the gooey chocolate mudpie,which was sinfully good.
there is no parking in this place and its always crowded, thus making for a jostle.But if it isn't good enough to jostle for then what good is celebrity status eatery.
The walls proudly show off the multiple awards and newspaper articles on this eatery and they are righly so.
A must visit for every visitor yo Kolkatta, though it is very difficult to parcel some for the perishable sweets

Recently I had a strange experience with Balaram Mullick. picked up a pack of baked Rasogolla. They packed it well and gave it to me.When I opened the pack I found two long hairs inn the box. Very nauseating. A reputed sweet shop like Balaram Mullick should be more careful.

Moreover the taste of baked rasogolla is different in each outlet.

To state a fact I must say that Balaram and Radharaman Mullick is the best sweet shop in South Kolkata. They are pretty old and have fought very hard to retain their position and popularity. Off late though I feel their prices have increased and size of sweets have decreased still that hasn't stopped me or others from being their regular customers. 
Whenever there is a occasion in my house it is mandatory that the sweets will be from this specific shop.
Now along with amazing sweets they also offer snacks like dahi vara, chola batura, samosa, several shakes which are reasonably well done I would say.
Their prices are a bit high compared to other sweet shops but still somewhere they have balanced it with their taste and reputation. 
So I rate it 4 and do consider this one whenever to want sweets or little titbits.

Balaram and Radharaman Mullick is an establishment that personifies the oft-spoken about but rarely practiced concept of the synthesis of the old and the new. Instead of going into the conflict, this place has brought out innovative solutions that are delightful to look at and even better to taste. Here you will find the traditional classics as well as the modern ideas of a confectioner. The baked rosogolla is just too good, and the curd - or ‡¶¶‡¶á as they put it in Bangla, is absolutely delectable. I could have more and more of both without limits. The fusion section is brilliant, too, with flavours ranging from mango to chocolate, strawberry and vanilla. There are a lot to choose from if you are looking for namkeen items, and all of them are very tasty.
The best thing about the place is that unlike other shops, you will never go there and find that an item is out of stock. They continuously replenish their stock fresh from the kitchen, so it's a great assurance. The price is definitely high but it is totally worth it.

Verdict: It is one of the best in the city, if you are the type who doesn't compromise on quality, you will love this place.

One of the oldest and best sweet shops in the city .... what I love about them is that they have continued with the older traditions but also introduced many delicious new ones ! The chocolate sandesh that I had was absolutely amazing and I was quite taken aback with the "chocolatey" taste .... happily unexpected ! I also love their mishti doi which ranks among the best in Kolkata. Reading the reviews of my fellow foodies it seems the savory items are also excellent and I look forward to trying tham out on my next visit there.

One of the best sweet shops in Kolkata. Located in Jagu Bazar and during any bengali festival i order sweets from here. Whenever i visit there it remains crowded and it has never lost its standard. I am addicted to Kaju Barfi, Baked Rosogolla and Chocolate Sandesh. If you are a pure 'Bheto Bangali' as me you are going to definitely like this place. You also get 100% eggless pastries and cakes which they have started serving newly. They are tasty and mishtis and sweets are simply excellent. Mishti doi is a good one, Aam doi is another best thing present there. The nimkis, chips are good and also the radha bollobis, pantuas are awesome. Staffs are good and when you go to purchase sweets, first you have to let know the staffs that what sweets you need then take a bill from the counter and you get it. Baked Rosogolla's suggestion goes to everyone and you will like it undoubtedly. It is like Haldiram cause you can get vegetarian meals and other vegetarian food.  The collection of sweet is huge and all sweets are available all the time i think. There is also sitting arrangement for 10 to 15 people. This a pure Bengali food store. I would rate 4'5 for Balaram Mullik and Radharaman Mullik.
:D

excellent place for sweets,they are not stuck on traditional bengali sweets and have created magic with the innovations.aam-doi,aam sondesh,chocolate rasgulla,chocolate sandesh are delightful and can easily compete with the mousses and pastries to become dessert favorites.Their radhaballavis,kachoris and chops are great.The place is efficiently and systematically managed and you will never be disappointed with their creations.
