Was highly recommended by a friend. And boy did it totally surpass our expectations. We took Harissa Chicken Skewers. Light and tasty. 
Chocolate Oreo shake was one of the best I've ever had. A chocolate Lover's must have!
Chicken in mushroom sauce was delicious and very filling. It came with a portion of herb rice.

While the food - classico chicken burritos, cheese garlic bread and Oreo shake was definitely delicious- it would have been preferable if the burrito had been made with real pita bread and not the paratha like substitute.

The black beans nachos here are the best i've had so far. A must try for nacho lovers,also the thin crust pizza is really good. Risotto isn't anything great but overall its a cozy joint to be at offering good food.

Definitely not worth the high rating given on zomato... service is not that good.... we ordered barbeque roasted chicken pizza, grilled chicken in mushroom pepper sauce served with garlic rice, chocolate mudpie and chocopate oreo shake.... the food was okayish and nothing to die for... though light on the pocket... definitely worth the money but not worth the rating.

Located at Prince Anwar Shah road, this is quite a small place with around 20 seats or so, but what they don't make up with the place they surely do with their hospitality and food.

‚ñ´Ô∏è AMBIENCE: As already mentioned this place doesn't have much accomodation. But i must say, with whatever space they have, it is pretty much well done and maintained. So for a small get together and all this place won't disappoint you.

‚ñ´Ô∏è HOSPITALITY: This is the arena where i got really impressed with Crossroad. Their staffs are so friendly and cooperative that you will never feel out of place. They are very much attentive and cater to every needs of their customers as far as they can. We were attended by a guy named Dipankar. That man even though had a plaster in one of his hands, was trying to keep up with the customers request all along with a smile on his face. For me, these things matter a lot, and personally i was pretty impressed with the lad.

‚ñ´Ô∏èFOOD: For the fact that we had other plans too that day, so we didn't order much. But whatever we did, they are:-

1. BBQ Roasted Chicken Pizza: It is a 10 inch thin crust pizza which comes with generous amount of cheesy and chicken toppings. Absolutely delicious. But yes, one pointer, its a bit on the sweeter side. So order according to your specifications.

2. Red velvet cake: This one is an absolute blinder. One of the best i ever had. It is love at first bite. Highly Recommended.

3. Chocolate tart: After having the red velvet cake, we were left asking for more. So settled for this one. And yes we were right again. Filled with gooey liquid chocolate, this one even surpassed the expectations after the red velvet. Extremely delicious. And for those chocolate lovers out there, you are sure to find heaven on earth with this one. So go for it without a second thought.

Overall a nice experience. Recommended for a one time visit. But if you are a dessert lover, then i am pretty sure this place will manage to get few more out of you.

The crossroad cafe is in Prince Anwar Shah road offering delicious food. Had the Panko fried fish and it was very tasty. The Pesto chicken bruschetta was below expectations but still not bad. The  Chocolate mudpie was great again. Overall a nice place to eat and hang out. The interiors look nice as well.

A nice cafe with decent decor. We had Caesar Salad which was average and Thai spice crispy fish which was good as well. The fish was extremely fresh. For beverage we had black coffee and Tiramisu iced coffee. The latter one tasted fine.

Ordered pesto barbeque veg pizza and grilled chicken sandwich though swiggy... oh man the pizza was simply lipsmacking.. It was overloaded with cheese and the veggies were perfectly barbequed and the crust was crisp like a biscuit..üòç the sandwich was also very good... It was made of brown bread and the stuffing was also perfect.. They do serve some really really yummy food.. and the sandwich was accompanied with French fries which lost its crispness due to the packing.. overall a very good cafe to have some tasty sandwich and pizzas... 

And the packaging was also good.. sorry we were so hungry forgot to click the pics..üòÄ

The rating is specially for the behaviour of the staff..
They were so friendly and decent
we ordered classic chicken burittos,Chicken sausage and chocolate mudpie
We were 3 in number so they just divided the 2 buritto into 3..the burittos were well cooked and had mixture of flavours
The chicken sausage was also good but i found it a bit dry
But i did not like the mudpie..

I visited this place on weekend, as per its rating I imagined it will be very crowed, but there was no one. They took lot of time to deliver food, even though there were no one in the restaurant, so it is big  turn off. We ordered blueberry mojito, there was nothing special in the drink. Also we ordered, classic nachos which wasnt up to the exceptions.

It's a regular pocket friendly cafe that's always a go to when in doubt and to spend time without having to worry about the food or anything else. 
The peri peri fries with yoghurt dip is almost a must. Go for anything else and they won't disappoint. The staff is well organized and make sure to be there whenever in any kind of doubt or need. 
The line of beverages are interesting and the offers they come up with add to the charm of the place.

Visited this wonderful place right after my gym today which is located on the top floor of the same building. Ordered a Veg fried rice and Chilly chicken. The fried rice was nicely cooked with lots of veggies... but was bit disappointed because the Chilly chicken didn't taste well but it was eatable though. Then we also ordered Oreo Chocolate shakes which was spectacular, specially the presentation of it was outstanding and it tasted very nice.

One of my favourites, this place is absolutely beautiful. It serves from a variety of Continentals, Mexican, Chinese and many others, the Menu is vast and everything available here tastes amazing! It's a relatively small and comforting place with good music and a beautiful ambience. The staff are very friendly and competent as well.
EDIT : They've added a new Prawn section and a Nolen Gur Cake in Desserts.
Must try - Asparagus Risotto, Chicken Bitten Steak, Grilled Chicken in Pepper Mushroom Sauce, Aglio Olio, Chocolate Shake.
Indepth Review :

1. Pastas - I've had almost everything from the Pasta section and they taste amazing. They're well cooked, well presented and comes in good quantity as well. Of all that I've had, the Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is my favourite, it being the most simplest dish of all but do feel free to pick any of the rest 'caus they're all delicious.

2. Salads - I should have started with salads but I didn't since I haven't had every one of 'em. The ones I had were well made and prepared and tasted quite good.

3. Risottos - My favourite destination for Risottos, I've had almost every on 'em and they taste stunning! Especially the Asparagus Risotto which is my all time favourite. The Silician Risotto is also good considering that I'm not a fan of spicy dishes. If you come here, do try the Asparagus Risotto once.

4. Burritos - I've had just one dish from this section, the Picante Chicken Burrito which tasted amazing in my opinion.

5. Main Courses - I've been through this section , all of these are stunners in their own ways, they're as always, well cooked and presented. My personal recommendation would be the Chicken Bitten Steak and Grilled Chicken in Pepper Mushroom Sauce.

6. Beverages - I've had all the basic stuff like Chocolate Shakes and Cold Coffee etc and they taste good. One thing I'd point out that both times I ordered from the Capuccino, Espresso etc. section, it came quite strong, without any sugar, so it's better if you mention it once before ordering or you can add sugar yourself from the sugar-pouches available on your table. There are Yogurt Smoothies too but I personally didn't like 'em.

7. Desserts - I feel these are a bit expensive compared to other places but nevertheless they taste absolutely amazing. Better try the Blueberry Cheese Cake and Red Velvet Cake out of the whole list.

I went to this place with a friend of mine on a weekend and really liked the place.

The place had a funky look to it with funky wall paints and One-liners. Its a small joint with 5-6 tables.

The serveur was really cordial and suggestive. We tried Burrito and it was just awesome
Classico Chicken Burrito (Tortilla wrapped with roasted chicken with refried beans, Mexican rice, pickled jalapeno, lettuce & chese)

Picante Chicken Burrito (Tortilla wrapped with spicy beans, Mexican rice, grilled chipotle chicken, lettuce and cheese)

Keep up the good work.
                    

Roasted Chicken with Bar B Q Sauce
Grilled Chicken
Harissa Chicken Skewers
Thai Spice Crispy Fish
Crispy Chilli Chicken

except for the skewers all were very good in taste.

This place was on my wishlist for a long time and finally I went there on last Monday.
This place is situated near the Lake Gardens bridge and is very easy to locate.
It is not a very big place but the quirky ambience will readily make you feel good.The drawings on the wall are really cute.
Now coming to food we ordered
‚Ä¢ A smoked chilli chicken pizza.The pizza was perfect.
‚Ä¢ Next we ordered chicken pasta in white sauce.
It was amazing.One of the best pasta preparations I have eaten in Kolkata.
‚Ä¢ Finally we had Harissa Fish.This was the best of all.It tasted super delicious.
Both the quality and quantity of the dishes were really good.But they were a bit over priced.
I am going to visit this place again !

Was very excited to try out this cafe which i have shortlisted for a really long time now.
Located near the Lake gardens bridge, is this lively cafe which has a variety of food items to offer.
We went in there on a chilled sunday evening. Though i thought it to be crowded, but thankfully the place was quite empty.

Now, coming to food. We ordered
1) CHICKEN SAUSAGES IN BALSAMIC DRESSING
2) BERRY YOGHURT SMOOTHIE AND
3) BANANA CARAMEL SMOOTHIE.

Well, honestly the drinks were really good.
The berry yoghurt smoothie was delicious and the drink was rich in berry, meusli and nuts. This drink is one of their best sellers and is a very healthy option.
Now, i was not quite sure of the banana caramel smoothie as we are more chocolate drink lovers.
But the decision of me experimenting turned out to be great when we ordered this drink. It was so tasty, with perfect balance of banana and caramel taste.
Loved it to bits. Highly recommended!!

Last but not the least, the sausage. Okay! So i was highly disappointed by this preparation. The,sausages were over fried nd the balsamic dressing along with the sausages were tasting bit weird. The sausages were over fried, dried and also bland.

Nevertheless, this cafe will be a great option for a quick hangout with friends over their wide variety of drinks.

A small cosy cafe beside the lake gardens connecter. It mostly serves continental dishes. Its quite pocket friendly with good proportions of food.
I visited this place twice. Once with a friend and once with my mum. 
The pretty place is all decked up in yellow. The staff is friendly. It plays old english country music.
On a rainy day, i visited this place and took a table by the window. We ordered roast chicken sandwitch and smoked chilly chicken sandwitch. Their sandwitches are huge and consist of buns, not ordinary bread. Plus they have excess filling and good amount of french fries. Having a bite of their sandwitches , watching the rain outside and humming 'bachelor boy' was very comforting!
Next i tried harissa chicken with coriander rice. Again an excellent preperation. One cam try their chocolate mud cake with is very tasty. I tried blueberry smoothie which was not as good as expected.
I would recommend all the college goers to drop by this cosy little joint . You wont be disappointed.

Crossroad Cafe - A good cafe which repeatedly plays 'theme for a dream' (pal pal har pal) music.

Location & Intro:

If you are heading from Navina Cinema or Princeton club towards south city, just take a left from the crossing before lords more and you will locate it on the ground floor on the right foot.¬†

I had been here many a times. Usually, this is the place where you can come and chill for long hours. They have got very simple background with vibrant lightings. What i really like about them is their pure white tables which looks really neat.¬†
=====
What i had here:

‚Ä¢ Harissa Chicken Skewers - They are soft and juicy. Great to taste and piping hot.¬†

‚Ä¢ Barbq chicken pizza - It is a small shape pizza. However, they add chicken pieces in abundance. The pizza is served smoky hot here.¬†

‚Ä¢ Sheesha - I have come here couple of times for sheesha flavours such as vanilla mint, paan rasna and more. It has not disappointed me ever.¬†
=====
Meal for two: Their food prices are highly inclined over the higher side. Nonetheless, 500-1000 for two approximate. (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc.)¬†
=====
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Great ambiance.
‚Ä¢ Good cafe concept.
‚Ä¢ Good hospitality.

Cons:

‚Ä¢ Please change music and avoid loop everytime.¬†

A tiny cafe located conveniently at the Lake Gardens crossing, Crossroad Cafe has been in demand ever since its inception. The competitive pricing of this place really appealed to us, the college-going crowd. With a vast array of continental fare available for the hungry visitor, how can this place be missed? 

‚òÖ AMBIANCE : First of all, the place is pretty small and cozy. The bright lights illuminating the graffiti-laden walls create a superb, casual ambiance which makes it ideal for that little campus gang catching up after their classes. However, if you looking for a date with a great deal of privacy, you may consider other places.

‚òÖ FOOD : I've been to this place so many times over the past four years, that I can barely recall which is the best - every dish they serve oozes excellence. I can swear by the Harissa Chicken Skewers, Panko Fried Fish and the amazing BBQ Chicken Pizza. Team it up with some Hot Chocolate (i wished they made it thicker, though) or Cappuccino (normal/hazelnut), followed by the Chocolate Mudpie, and you'll be the happiest man on the planet. :)

‚òÖ SERVICE : Service is decent, albeit quite slow at times. The staff are courteous and professional.

‚òÖ PRICING : As I mentioned earlier, this place appeals to the teenage, college going group, and the initial pricing was set up accordingly. Over time, the prices have been steeped up a little, but after your first visit, I'm sure you'll keep coming back for more.

P.S. They have home delivery facilities too (through Zomato Order & Swiggy).
Happy gorging!

This is a small but cozy cafe bear my home..  Went there few weeks back... The day was pretty special for me as I was introducing my boyfriend to my grandmother for the first time.  So we did not focused much on the food as the 'meeting' was much more important..  We ordered
1 mango  passion twist
2 peach iced tea
3 crispy baby corn 
4 chocolate mud pie
Mud pie and mango twist were really good 
Baby corn was average.. Not bad but nothing extraordinary 
I didn't liked peach tea much, though my bf liked it...  So it's subjective... 
Waiters were nice..  Good experience..  Would love to go back and try some real food...

The bright lights illuminating the graffiti-laden walls create a superb, casual ambiance which makes it ideal for that little campus gang catching up after their classes. However, if you looking for a date with a great deal of privacy, you may consider other places.

‚òÖ FOOD : I've been to this place so many times over the past four years, that I can barely recall which is the best - every dish they serve oozes excellence. I can swear by the Harissa Chicken Skewers, Panko Fried Fish and the amazing BBQ Chicken Pizza. Team it up with some Hot Chocolate (i wished they made it thicker, though) or Cappuccino (normal/hazelnut), followed by the Chocolate Mudpie, and you'll be the happiest man on the planet. :)

‚òÖ SERVICE : Service is decent, albeit quite slow at times. The staff are courteous and professional.

‚òÖ PRICING : As I mentioned earlier, this place appeals to the teenage, college going group, and the initial pricing was set up accordingly. Over time, the prices have been steeped up a little, but after your first visit, I'm sure you'll keep coming back for more.

P.S. They have home delivery facilities too (through Zomato Order & Swiggy).
Happy gorging!

This is a small but cozy cafe bear my home..  Went there few weeks back... The day was pretty special for me as I was introducing my boyfriend to my grandmother for the first time.  So we did not focused much on the food as the 'meeting' was much more important..  We ordered
1 mango  passion twist
2 peach iced tea
3 crispy baby corn 
4 chocolate mud pie
Mud pie and mango twist were really good 
Baby corn was average.. Not bad but nothing extraordinary 
I didn't liked peach tea much, though my bf liked it...  So it's subjective... 
Waiters were nice..  Good experience..  Would love to go back and try some real food...

This place is just so good that I genuinely felt like writing a review. Ever since our first visit to this place, it has become our go to place¬† for pizzas. Pizzas or BBQ Roasted chicken pizza and Pizza Chiptole to be more specific will keep you asking for more. Of other things I have tried,¬† Harissa skewers were good and Thai spice crispy fish was subtle to taste and was full of flavours. Overall a reasonable and yet a lovely place. The desserts were not up to the mark though.

Its was a ok
Place , but too expensive.
I think some other arrangements 
Should be done for hookahs
As serving of hookah inside the
Cafe actually makes the place a bit suffocating 
As its a small place.

Situated at the crossroad of Prince Anwar Shah road and lake gardens, this cafe is pretty good in terms of the food as well as the ambience. We ordered the red sauce pasta, roast chicken sandwich and an Oreo shake. The pasta had generous chunks of chicken and the sandwich was stuffed with chicken and a delicious barbeque sauce. The oreo shake wasn't too sweet either! The decor is nice as well! Listed in student's favorites, this place could be on your list for days you have around 500 bucks in your pocket!

When they say it's a college goers' hangout they don't lie. That's what I liked about the place, the honesty. A quaint little place at the crossroad of Prince Anwar Shah Road and Lake Gardens caught my attention as I often passed by. But when we decided to drop we were all the more mesmerized. The cute little place had stationery available as well. The food was good and so was the music playing. It's the teddy bear of food joints.

This another small cute cafe just near the Lake Gardens Bridge.
I went here with my friend to have a quick lunch.
The interiors are like any other cute cafe,cosy and lively.
We took three items-Chicken sausages in Balsamic sauce,Harissa fish with Cilantro rice and Mint orwo shake.
‚Ä¢Mint Oreo Shake-The shake tasted really good.This is first time ever I had a minty chocolate shake topped with delicious oreo crumbs as well
We loved the taste of this shake.

‚Ä¢Chicken Sausages in Balsamic Sauce-10-12 pieces of sausages cut beautifully into flower shaped pieces served on a bed of sauce and lettuce was another nice choice.But it was overfried and were almost crispy which is not much appreciated.

‚Ä¢Harissa Grilled fish with Cilantro rice and side salad-Steaks are very wholesome food and the prices here are reasonable too.Four succulent pieces of fish cooked well in a tasty gravy served with good amount of Coriander rice.We loved this dish.I wish they served a bit more salad.

Had a nice meal here.
Pocket pinch is 800/- for two.
Service is good.

The glass it came in was much smaller than expected. But it was topped with delicious crunchy oats. Overall, it was an okay experience. Overpriced food. Relatively fast service. Delicious shake.

I went there few days back and was suggested by a colleague of mine. He did gave me a pass on discount coupon. Here I start with the ambience, so it's a well decorated place and not over decorated. There plays music of many genres and I got to listen to some classic western english songs too. The food was nice too. Ordered Chilly Chicken Pizza and Chicken sausage. There I tasted one of the best thin crust pizza, though I'm not a fan of thin crust but literally liked it. The chicken chunks were tasty and the pizza sauce was delicious. The chicken sausages were great too. Though some might not like sauce of the sausage as it was a bit hard on smell. The sausages were crispy fried and was enough in quantity.
P.s.: - News for the hookah lovers, they serve hookah too.

It really feels well, when you get something much much greater than your expectation. This happened to me, when I visited this Caf√© yesterday. It was rainy day yesterday, so was looking for a caf√© and after a little search on Zomato, I choosed this place.

The location of the restaurant is near the PA Shah Rd and Lake Gardens Rd crossing. Wither you come from South City side or from Tollygunge side, drop at Mannar Khabar Bus Stop. Take a few step towards Dhakuria Lake taking Lake Gardens Rd and you fill find this restaurant on the left side.

So lets come and explore this place ‚Äì

Positive Points ‚Äì

1.	Ambiance and decoration ‚Äì It is a pretty small caf√© with basic table chair sitting arrangements and capacity of max 35 persons at a time, but well maintained. Soft music at background really add some great mood to your dining experiences.

2.	Food ‚Äì They offers you some great quality food, which really melts your heart down.

Negative points ‚Äì

1.	Pricing ‚Äì I personally think that some food over there are really overpriced with respect to Quantity and Quality.

Without this one, I didn‚Äôt get any negative point there.

Now lets come to food. We ordered ‚Äì

1.	Cappuccino ‚Äì A perfect start for a rainy evening. Was little bit strong in nature so if you don‚Äôt like the raw flavor, just add some sugar and you are good to go. Love the foam texture on the top of the coffee.

2.	Penne with Parmesan, mushroom & fresh herbs (Chicken) ‚Äì I always love the Italian cuisine and Pasta is my all-time fav item. So what can be better to have some cheesy chicken pasta on a beautiful rainy day! Pasta was well cooked with lots of mushrooms and fresh herbs and the cheesy white sauce is something that you can die for. Awesome in one word. They add 35 Rs. extra with MRP if you want the chicken toppings. They also served garlic bread with the pasta, which really goes well with the white saucy pasta. Love the concept.

3.	Chicken Bitten Steak ‚Äì This is not like the traditional steak, which you generally get in a Tex-Max restaurant. Quite different texture and presentation style also. 3 pieces of chicken patties were server with Risotto rice. Chicken patties were well marinated and perfectly grilled. Rice was cooked in traditional cheesy and sticky way. Overall good in tastes.

With all the food mentioned above it costs us only 665 INR, which is a decent pricing and the best part is, they don‚Äôt added any VAT or Service charges, which was really a blessing one. So, in conclusion I will say, in the growing Caf√© culture of Kolkata, Crossroad Cafe is really a shining star in it. Great food, nice presentation, wide range of variety is something that bound you to visit this restaurant again. Overall an awesome dining experience and will visit this restaurant again and again.

I have ordered online. Cold coffee and Caesar salad. Though it took much more time than the due time at the end I was happy with the food. The coffee was normal plain cold coffee but was awesome in taste. The slad was also good and it was probably best for my recent diet plan.
 And for me it was a win win moment because they have managed to send a special note along with the delivery on my special demand. Thanks to the team. I would love to visit the shop very soon.

A quiet and cosy joint near the Prince Anwar Shah road crossing. Although the place is a bit small, the food makes up for it. Quite a varied menu that helps you fill your fast hunger needs. I specially liked their garlic bread mediterranean sandwich and their spicy chilli chicken sandwich, not to mention their calzone spiced chicken wings which is just amazing. Allover, I would recommend this place to all those who are reading my reviews to atleast visit and experience their food once.

I discovered this cafe in May,2016 from the Zomato Newly Opened Category.SInce then I frequently visit this cafe as it is very conveniently located at the Prince Anwar Shah Road. The service is very good and the staff is co operative. They even changed my mojito when accidentally something fell into it. Now coming to the food, it is one of those places where one can go with 500 bucks and have a pretty decent meal starting with appetisers and concluding with desserts. ¬†

1. Harissa Chicken skewers : A very decent dish . The chicken was well cooked and tender . The sauce has a balanced taste of the spices and the vinegar.¬†

2. Roast Chicken Sandwich : The cafe is celebrated for the variety of sandwiches it offers. The roast chicken sandwich had a nice filling. The chicken tossed in barbeque sauce with a hint of garlic melts in the mouth. One of the best sandwiches in South Kolkata Cafes

3. Barbeque Roasted Chicken Pizza : The chicken toppings with a generous amount of nice smooth barbeque sauce tastes awesome. It is not like the ¬†pizzas with a good amount of gooey cheese (I love cheese) . However its tasty and filling. Good for sharing.¬†

4. Chipotle Pizza : Nice toppings .Not spicy. ¬†However I liked Barbeque Roasted Chicken Pizza more.

5. Pizza Chicken Supreme : The Cajun spiced toppings is pretty nice and not very overspiced. However in my opinion their Barbeque Roasted Chicken Pizza is still better.

6. Chicken Bitten Steak : A very simple yet yummy dish. It presents a perfect quantity of risotto with chicken steak. The steak is nicely marinated and tender. The risotto is absolutely yum.

7. Barbeque Roasted Chicken : It is a chicken dish with loads of barbeque sauce which is lot more like gravy and is served with potato pilaf. Not a very wonderful dish from the cafe and it kindof is disappointing as opposed to the other dishes

8. Passion Fruit Mojito : Wonderful . Truly refreshing . A perfect balance between sweet and tangy taste this is wonderful mocktail to pair up with your main course.

9. Blueberry Mojito : Cool and refreshing. Nicely presented. Not a big fan of blueberries , to me Passion fruit rocks .

10. Chocolate Mudpie : Just like mudpies. Usual taste . Good presentation

11. MonteCarlo - Chocolate : One of the best desserts I have had in the different cafes of Kolkata.¬†

12. Chocolate Mousse : Very usual taste. Nice presentation.¬†

Overall Crossroad Cafe is decent place to visit and offers quite a nice menu worth praising.

I ordered in from this cafe a couple of days back. I'd seen it multiple times in the passing but parking seemed to be an issue due to its location on the flyover, so thought it better to order in. We ordered a chicken white sauce pasta with mushrooms, a snowball chicken sandwich, and a grilled chicken with rice and veggies. Also ordered a chocolate tart such was pretty tiny. Unfortunately I didn't get any pics, will get some the next time. 
The pasta was good, no complaints. The sandwich was okay, the bread was good but the stuffing could have been tastier. The grilled chicken was a disappointment, the chicken was packed in an oily gravy and the veggies were not fresh. The zucchini was actually bitter. 
I liked the rest of the food, such was also delivered in time without any hassles. Will try visiting this place to test if the food is better in the restaurant!

On a lazy Sunday afternoon, I decided to order pizza and pasta from here and I'm glad that I ordered from here. 
Four toppings pizza and penne pesto. Pizza was amazing. Full of flavours, freshly baked and crunchy on the edges. Pasta was good too but it was mild in flavour. Maybe I should've eaten pasta first as pizza was strong in flavours xD

Cafe culture is gaining popularity in India and Kolkata is no lagging behind. This newly opened cafe is located in Prince Anwar Shah Road and Lake Gardens crossing. It is a small venture started by two brothers Vishal and Adarsh Kajaria. There main motto is to serve authentic and best food to the people of Kolkata at a reasonable pricing. This place has already started to gain popularity and remains filled most of the times.

They also have facilities like free WiFi, live sports screening, free parking , home delivery etc. They use organic ingriedients and make their food as healthy as possible without using preservatives and artificial colours. The dips and sauces are also homemade. A great thing !!!!!

Ambience - Nice & clean ambience with seating arrangements of about 15-20 people, well lit with live sports screening.

8)Crispy Chili Chicken- a Chinese preparation with mixture of hot and spicy Crispy Chickens with sticky, sweet and savoury sweet homemade schezwan sauce.

9)Corn & Spinach Sandwich- Served with French Fries , a juicy sandwich with spinach, corn & white sauce.

10)Smoked Chili Chicken Pizza- Perfectly grilled pizza topped with smoked chili chicken, white barbecue sauce, onions, and cheese. It was very tasty and highly recommended.

11)Bar B Q Roasted Chicken Pizza‚Äì Grilled pizza topped with roasted bar-b-q chicken, onion and cheese. It was again a superstar.

12)Veg Hakka Noodles ‚ÄìVegetable Hakka noodles are also more commonly known as Vegetable Chowmein. This is a popular Indo-Chinese dish. Vegetable hakka noodles consists of stir fry noodles with a variety of vegetables.¬†

13)Grilled Fish with stir fried vegetables - Fish chunks properly grilled and mixed with caper lime sauce, fresh herbs and paprika and served with garlic bread. It was very presentable and lipsmacking.

14)Butter Chilli Mushroom- Mushroom tossed in Butter with Onion, Garlic and Herb was creamy and delicious.

15)Peri Peri Chicken Burger ‚ÄìServed with French fries, A delicious Portuguese style peri peri¬†chicken ¬†burger ideal for a quick lunch, dinner or weekend party night. It was lipsmacking and juicy.

16)Grilled Chicken in pepper mushroom sauce served with garlic rice and side veggies ‚Äì very delicious preparation.

17)Porcine Mushroom Risotto ‚Äì This classic¬†risotto¬†presses all the right buttons, with intense¬†porcini mushrooms¬†and plump arborio rice.¬†

An ordinary looking looking cafe with really good food. Service is quick. We ordered a chicken wings which had 3 pieces ,a peach ice tea and a non veg mushroom risotto. All the items tasted really good and our bill was 615/-. So its really pocket friendly as well. üòÉ

A cafe which has been on my list for a long time. It's a small cozy place with good music. The interior is cool. It is actually smaller than I thought it would be. The ambiance is kindoff chilled out. Coming to the food, we ordered chicken pizza supreme, Chocolate mudpie and Irish cold coffee. The pizza tasted great..It had a different taste. The mudpie stole my heart! The Irish coffee had a different taste which suited our taste buds. So food is 4/5. The staffs are courteous and the service is good. Overall a chilled out place to hang out with friends. Also if you want to have variety then you can go here as there is a lot of options in the menu. Would love to visit soon. 
Also the prices are inclusive of tax!

Conveniently located. Small place yet comfortable ambience. The grilled fish has a full plate of veggies with the fish in it playing peekaboo! Will give a 5 star for cold coffee!

This cute little cafe just a few minutes away from South city mall is a catch. It has interesting items on the menu.
We especially liked the service. Even though there was a single person handling the place that time he was very courteous.
Btw, there is Nearbuy open voucher you can avail for the next few weeks.
We ordered a
Harissa Chicken skewer: it had unique spices and the plating is impressive enough.
Chilli chicken cheese sandwich: The name is misleading. It tastes more like the ordinary chicken 65 sub (Mio amore)
Cold coffee Hazelnut..
The waiter gave us extra fries on our request and didn't charge anything. It was very polite of him.
Only flaw is the beverages are way too pricey. But if possible I would visit there again. :)

Just at the juncture of Prince Anwar shah flyover, is located this little cafe. To my surprise it was smaller than I expected..but let that not disappoint you, because the food and refreshers aren't any less. 
Ordered for a green apple iced tea and lemon iced tea.. decent drinks. Rejuvenation satisfaction. 
Also took a portion of grilled chicken sandwich. 
Four pieces of loaded sandwiches. The filling was very tasty, mayo, peppers , grilled chicken and herbs mixed perfectly. Loved how each sandwich was amply stuffed. 
Served with ketchup and fries. 
Tasty! 
Also serves hookah. 
Since its a little place and hookah is served in it as well, The non smokers might have a tad bit of issue.
Otherwise a decent hangout spot.

With so many new places popping here and there, this place stands with its glory at the very end of the Lake Gardens Flyover. Initial impression was that the place was a little small with minimalistic decor for accommodating a huge crowd but nevertheless we didnt face any trouble. To be the judge we went for,
üçñHarissa Chicken Skewers: flattened breast of chicken skewed and roasted tossed up in a tangy red sauce, good ome to start with.
üåØClassico Chicken Burrito: surprisingly a well stuffed burrito with chicken cubes and potato filling wrapped in golden tortilla served with salsa dip. (It made us full don't know how)
üç∞Red Velvet Cake: indeed the show stopper both by its look and taste, a must try.
I'm sure this place will not burn a huge hole in the pocket, so can be dropped in anytime without hesitation.
P.S. Staffs are courteous too.

The place in very easy to locate and the name of this place is just appropriate for it's location. Food is well above average here and the staff very polite and prompt. The place, though small, is very clean and tidy. The one thing that stands out is the music that is played here. The one who creates the playlists sure has some incredible taste in music. This place surely deserves a second visit.

This place is located the the "manna khabar" crossing. Decided to go there for my birthday when my friend gave me a surprise visit. Since we went there around 11 the hookah was not available ( it is available after 12noon). We had ordered a grilled chicken sandwich, a lasagna, cappuccino and masala tea. The sandwich was delicious and filling. The lasagna has such a thick cheese layer than it is impossible for you to complete even half of it alone. My coffee was average but the masala tea was horrible.. it was mostly water! My friend had to ask them to add more milk even then it tasted like sweetened water.

I prefer this place over many because it's just 5mins walk from my place. So whenever i crave for a sandwich or a hot chocolate or a chicken bacon ham caesar salad and don't feel like travelling long distances, then this is the place i go to. Though the place is small with not much sitting place, but the location by the roadside makes it cozy. Price is also well within reach. So, the next time you're crossing Lake Gardens Flyover and are in a mood for a coffee or sandwich or salad then this place is always recommended

Crossroads cafe is a newly opened cafe , located at Prince Anwar Shah Road, Kolkata. The main motto of this cafe is to provide great quality & tasty food at a reasonable price. They provide home delivery too.

Ambience - Though spacing and sitting arrangements is small but ambience is nice with simple decoration, live sports screening, free parking, WiFi etc.

Staffs & Service - Staffs were well behaved and service was prompt.

We Panchphoron team went on a food tasting event and had the following-

The Dishes¬†We Had :

Yuzu Fizz ‚Äì¬†a cool, healthy & refreshing drink made with¬†Yuzu juice, orange wedges, orange water and syrup.

Chinese Salad ‚Äì ¬†Fried Noodles with vegetables tossed in chilli garlic sauce was crunchy, crispy and yummy

Virgin Mojito¬†‚Äì¬†A Mojito without alcohol is called a "Virgin Mojito" or "Nojito". It contains lime juice, mint, soda etc.It was very refreshing , cool and a perfect summer drink.

Burrito Bowl (Chicken) ‚Äì¬†is a type of Mexican food,consisting of a large wheat¬†flour tortilla with a filling, wrapped into a closed-ended cylinder, in contrast to a¬†taco, where the tortilla is simply folded around the filling. The flour tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it, make it more pliable and allow it to adhere to itself when wrapped.
In Mexico, meat and¬†refried beans¬†are sometimes the only fillings. In the United States, burrito fillings may include a combination of ingredients such as¬†Mexican style rice or plain rice,¬†beans¬†or refried beans, lettuce,¬†salsa, meat,¬†guacamole , cheese,¬†sour cream¬†and various vegetables. Burrito size varies. It was lip smacking and good in quantity and healthy.

Roast Lemon Chicken Salad¬†with apricot, fresh coriander, mixed lettuce, sun dried tomato and pickled red cabbage was beautifully dressed & mouth watering . It's a healthy dish.

Bubble Berry Shake¬†‚Äì ¬†It was heavenly in taste and a must try item. It was very refreshing and fresh.

Strawberry Oreo¬†Shake¬†‚Äì¬†It was creamy, smooth. Combines the traditional cocoa flavour¬†with a wonderfully smooth strawberry oreo¬†flavoured creme filling was refreshing.

Crsipy Chilli Chicken ¬†‚Äì¬† is a wonderful mix of hot and spicy Crispy Chickens with sticky, sweet and savoury sweet homemade schezwan¬†sauce. This dish would definately arouse your taste buds.

Corn & Spinach Sandwich ¬†‚Äì¬†It is made with spinach, corn & white sauce and was served with French fries. The sandwich was succulent and very yummy.

Smoked Chilli Chicken Pizza ¬†‚Äì ¬†Pizza with chicken tossed in smoked chilli sauce.¬†It was lip smacking and can be tried over again & again.

Veg Hakka Noodles¬† ‚Äì¬†Perfectly cooked, less oily with enough veggies and perfect balance of flavours and sauces.

Bar B Q Roasted Chicken Pizza¬† ‚Äì¬†This was very tasty and well presented, perfectly grilled and topped with Bar B Q chicken, onion & cheese.

Schezwan Chicken Rice¬† ‚Äì¬†Chicken fried rice, spicy , hot with juicy chicken pieces was tasty and enough in quantity.

Grilled Fish with stir fried vegetables¬†was also yummy , perfectly grilled, catchy garnishing and was served with garlic bread.

Butter Chilli Mushroom ‚Äì Mushroom tossed in Butter with Onion, Garlic and Herb. A classic Indo-Chinese starter was well made & tasty.

Peri Peri Chicken Burger ‚Äì ¬†Grilled chicken with spicy Peri Peri sauce sandwich.Served with crispy french fries. It was lip smacking.

Grilled¬†Chicken in pepper mushroom sauce served with garlic rice and side veggies ‚Äì
A meal of Garlic Rice with Grilled Chicken and creamy Mushroom Sauce. This platter was yummy and was sufficient in quantity.

Porcini Mushroom Risotto¬†‚Äì Arborio rice cooked with fresh porcini mushrooms and white sauce. It's like veg steak and was yummy and soft.

Red Velvet Pastry ‚Äì¬†Red Velvet cake¬†is traditionally a red or red-brown¬†layer cake ¬†topped with white¬†cream cheese ¬†or cooked¬†roux icing. Red velvet cake is often made by dying chocolate cake red, however a true red velvet cake contains cocoa as only one of the ingredients.
Common¬†ingredients include¬†buttermilk, butter, cocoa, and¬†flour for the cake,¬†beetroot or red food colouring for the color. It was enjoyable.

Creme Brulee¬†Pastry ‚Äìalso known as¬†burnt cream,¬†¬†is a¬†dessert consisting of a rich¬†custard ¬†base topped with a contrasting layer of hard¬†caramel. It is normally served at room temperature. The custard base is traditionally flavoured with vanilla , but can have a variety of other flavourings. It was beautifully presented and delicious.

Pocket pinch is reasonable along with sufficient quantity and every dish is a healthy one. Don't bother the simple ambience cos the food here is worthy every penny and one will always find this place full of people .

Thanks to the management of Crossroad Cafe for their warm reception and hospitality.

Thanks Rajdeep da for your invitation.

Came here on a hot summer afternoon and was very thankful for it being air conditioned. It is a small joint but looked spacious and wasn't crammed up. It played light music which provided for a good ambience. It had a happy vibe with it's colourful walls. I really liked the walls. The staff was friendly and very curtious.
Now coming to the food, since I had come here with a friend who was vegetarian so I had to eat vegetarian food. Starting with the fact that I am not a fan of veg food, the food was good.
We started off with iced tea which wasn't that great. You would want to avoid it. Next we had the four topping pizza which was tasty. It had a thin crust with a good tomato base and was cheesy. We next ordered the veg lasagna. My friend liked it but I thought it was just fine. The only problem with their food is the salt balance which is off and the dishes tasted a tad bit saltier than preferred‚Äã.

Intro: It was a lazy Sunday dusk. After the siesta, missus said she wanted to have a coffee date. Obviously, what the better half demands, you do! So after some searching on zomato it came down to two cafes. Either it was this venue or a new raging cafe opened at the southern avenue. But finally we settled for this one as it has been in the bucket list, for long!

Location: the name does the perfect justice to depicts it's location. Located at the cross roads of anwar Shah road and the lake flyover, it's pretty easy to spot.

Ambience: we were the 1st person to be there that session. We had pretty much the place to ourselves. Quiet , little , charming place it is; simply decorated with neatly arranged chairs and tables. After sometime they started their music collection and i must say , I was surprised to hear Cliff Richard being played; I loved it. Full marks to the ambience.

Service: the attendants were courteous n very helpful. The service was good.

Food n beverages: well , missus opted for an Irish coffee n i settled for lemon iced tea. We ordered a plate of Thai spice crispy fish between us.
The beverages were served in no time. They were okay , no complaints there. Nothing huge to write about though!
The fish dish was served after few minutes. It looked ridiculously delicious. It smelled also awesome. It had 4 chunky pieces of bhetki crisply fried n marinated with an awesome sauce. The outer coating was crispy n the inner portion was as soft as it can be. It was perfectly soured and spiced.
Blown away by the fish starter we thought of trying the harisa chicken skewers. It took some time to be prepared but it looked like it was worth the wait, atleast that's what we thought! Four pieces of seductive looking chicken skewers coated in a brown sauce was served to us. However, it was a big let down. The skewers which were supposed to be coated with African type of sauce felt like simple Bengali chicken kosa jhol. Also , the skewers didn't soak in the sauce and it was just left on the outside, as a mere coating.

Cost: 600 bux for two ppl. It's cheap , I'll give em that.

Summary: lovely little joint at the crossroads, convenient to hop in anytime, pocket friendly and hey, they play cliff Richard, anytime I'll go back!

To start with we had espresso and cappuccino coffee ‚òïÔ∏è and Shisha. The cappuccino was perfect. 
Next it was time for calzon spice Chicken wings, I felt that the Chicken was under cooked and very chewy. The sweetest part was after complaining the owner (Mr. Vishal) ,he asked us not to continue with the food and rather ordered one of their specialties. Indeed this shows that is a very ethical and a humble person. 
After that we had crispy chilli Chicken well  my surprise after the wings my expectations had gone down but then it was wow it was full of flavour it was crunchy,was delicious. One should visit this cafe. The ambience is good,the staff and the owner are very friendly.

We ordered Harissa chicken skewers, Thai crispy fish (best of the lot), chicken pasta in mixed sauce. Quantity is good, and we could not finish the pasta. For desert we ordered Chocolate mousse and got chocolate tart free.

Crossroad cafe , as the name suggests has its first outlet located at Prince Anwar Shah Road and Lake Gardens crossing. There is plenty of parking options nearby. We went in to find such a variety of menu items!. It is a small venture started by two brothers and young entrepreneurs Vishal and Adarsh Kajaria. It was started exactly a year ago in Feb.‚Äô16 with an aim to serve authentic and best food to the people of Kolkata at a reasonable pricing.
                                                                ...

I was near jadavpur and the area is really unknown for me. I decided to order lunch for us via zomato online ordering.
To my initial shock, the delivery time was showing as one hour whereas ‚Äãother delivery vendors take maximum of 30minutes.
Anyways... I ordered Mediterranean's Burger, Peri Peri burger and chicken wings.
The packaging was too good! Everything was sealed and hygienic.
Both the burgers were good, i won't say they were excellent. But the chicken wings were a big turn down for me! 
It had no taste. 
Not spicy not sweet! 
I would love to visit the outlet once though üôÇ

After being there in the bookmarked section for quite a few months, finally gave it a try. The only thing that comes to my mind after spending 2 hours in the cafe was: SPLENDID! The experience was just too good to put in words. From the courteous staff to the posh decor with a mix of wall arts and graffiti, added up to the aura of this small little dugout. The food was gorgeously lip smacking with an extra bit of cheese. The Caesar Salad creamy, fresh with succulent chunks of chicken. Though was quite apprehensive about the risotto but they surprised me with a wholesome serve of cheesy Asparagus Risotto which was tossed in white sauce. Blueberry Mojito and green apple iced tea just enhanced the whole feeling of a king size brunch! To finish it off there was this extravagant Chocolate Mudpie and the only thing I could do was dig in it. 
Overall a beautiful place and quite reasonable when it comes to quality and quantity. Loved it and will revisit it as many times as possible. Kudos!

The caf√® is situated at the crossing of the Prince Anwar Shah and Lake Gardens, just below the flyover leading to Southern Avenue. The place is small but the ambience is calm, nice and quiet. The staff was very polite and extremely courteous. It's a pocket friendly place. All the price in the menu card is inclusive of tax.
Coming to the foods:-
‚Ä¢ Harissa Chicken Skewers : This dish was really good. Skewers are tossed in African marinated spices. It's bit spicy but the taste is really nice.
‚Ä¢ Classico Chicken Burrito: Tortilla wrapped with chicken, mexican rice, pickled jalape√±o, refried beans, lettuce. 
‚Ä¢ Red Velvet : This dish is a classic among deserts. It looks so fresh and yummy. It is a three layer pestey, filled with cream and nicely garnished.
Lastly, the price, ambience, locality, staff everything is very nice. My experience is quite good.
Highly recommended üôÇ

Crossroad Caf√© has been simply outstanding and exceeded my expectations. We (four of us visited the place today) ordered Harissa Chicken Skewers, Grilled Chicken Sausages, Crispy Chilli Chicken and Chicken Bitten Steak. The Harissa Chicken Skewers and Chicken Bitten Steak are worth mentioning as both were really mouth-watering. To add to all these was the ambience which was really great. The pocket-friendly price tags of the dishes deserve special mention.

Also, not to forget was the complimentary Mocktail for women. Special thanks for recognising the International Women‚Äôs Day with the offer.

If you want to have some different types of lip-smacking wraps,burgers along with mixed platters, then you have to visit this joint Crossroad cafe.

In a very small time of period Crossroad Cafe reached towards success. Around 21-25 can seat & eat at a time,this place looks perfect for the evening time.

The ambience called for a nice quiet meal over some chitchat with friends or a date. This food joint located in 40/1,Prince Anwar Shah Road.

I was quite impressed by the interiors which they maintained really well .I went there over a food tasting session with my fellow foodie friends.

We started our food tasting session with newly launched dishes along with some refreshing uncommon drinks.

Overall it was a very good experience.all the foods they prepared for us good in quality as well as good in quantity .Price is very reasonable.
service was quick as well as very very tasty.I would like to thank to

A Revelation. No doubt. 
Calm ambience. Great locale. Excellent food. Pocket friendly.
Coming to the food:
1. Grilled chicken sausages with BBQ sauce -
 Decoration n garnishing simple yet eyecatching. Tastes good. Good qty.
2. Crispy Chilli Chicken - Tastes the best of the whole lot. It had the WOW factor. Would suggest everyone to try this dish out. Perfect amount of sauce. Perfectly crisp. Everything perfect.
3. Chicken Skewers - 4 sticks of chicken. Fresh.
4. Mexican fries - French fries with a twist. The sour white sauce provided with the fries was excellent to taste. Thick and creamy.
5. Latte - After a very long time tasted coffee that felt homemade with a lot of heart. Only complaint is about the qty. It should be a bit more. Froth occupied almost a good portion of the cup. Deducted 0.5 for the qty. of coffee. The taste however is better than most of the coffee joints in the city.

Hi I am Rishabh Agnelo.....this cafe has a superb ambience!!!....food is excellent and authentic. Continental dishes are perhaps the best in the city. This restaurant will give any 5 star restaurant a run for its money. Very expensive foreign ingredients imported by the owner to make all the dishes.
After eating here you won't feel like even entering somewhere else.

A small restaurant which you can easily find at the junction of Prince Anwar Shah road and Lake Gardens Flyover. The decor was extremely simple, with a few tables and yellow plastic chairs beside them.
It is not too crowded and the ambience is pretty nice.
However, one of the most important reasons to visit this place is the food which is extremely cheap. I went for : 
1) Grilled Chicken with Pepper Mushroom Sauce - It was served with garlic rice and sauteed veggies. 
Grilled chicken is pretty much available in any continental restaurant in Kolkata and this restaurant met the benchmark. The sauce, however, had spread all over the plate and so it could have been served better. Still, the dish is definitely a must-try there.

2) Grilled Chicken Sandwich - Two portions with a generous amount of chicken were served. The sandwich tasted amazing and the fries on the side were extremely crisp.

3) Red Velvet - Red Velvet cake is a classic among desserts. Their's didnt miss the mark.

4) Creme Brulee - Extremely surprised to see the Creme Brulee being served as a cake here. Even though I liked it, it was nowhere what a classic Creme Brulee should be like. The only major negative of the meal for me.

Overall, it was a pretty good experience. Add to that the absence of VAT and service taxes, and this place becomes a must-visit. Would definitely come back again.

The Caf√© is situated at the Crossroad of the Prince Nawar Shah Road and Lake Gardens, just below the flyover leading to Southern Avenue. It's almost a blink and you miss it place, but once you're inside, it's pleasantly surprising what the place has in store for you. The first thing that catches your attention are the bright yellow chairs and the quirky grafiti on the walls. The vegetables have been given life and they are drawn in weird postures that imparts a hippie feeling to the place. The second thing that will surprise you is the long list of items and that too spanning different cuisines that are included in the menu, for such a small place. I have visited this caf√© a couple of times and I have tried their Harissa Chicken Skewers, Thai Spice Crispy Fish, Chicken Bitten Steak, Classico Chicken Burrito and Harissa Chicken.

1. Harrissa Chicken Skewers: Skewers in African marinated spice. A bit spicy, but good.

2. Thai Spice Crispy Fish: Crispy on the outside, soft inside. Tossed with hot basil sauce and topped with sesame. Pretty good.

3. Chicken Bitten Steak: It's beautiful and different. Must try.

4. Harrissa Chicken: The sauce remains the same as the skewers- spicy and thick.

5. Classico Chicken Burrito: Burritos done in the classic style.

For the desserts, they do have things like Chocolate Mousse and Chocolate Mudpie on offer, but I personally didn't like any of them. They aren't freshly prepared and are more like the ones you purchase from Mio Amore or Bake Club.

Overall, I love this place because the prices are tax inclusive and you don't need to burn a hole in your pocket to drop by. Also, the caf√© mostly doesn't have too much crowd, which allows you to have a quiet time. It's one of the better cafes in town, save for the sweet tooth!

This awesome little cafe is located at the Lake gardens turning point towards Rabindra sarovar. We had ordered Harissa chicken skewers, Penne al pomodaro (pasta) and chocolate tart. I have to say, all the dishes were absolutely lip smacking! The chocolate tart was an added delight, when the soft crust on being bitten lets out a warm ooze of chocolate into your mouth. *_*
The staff were also extremely courteous, and the ambiance was warm and friendly. Perfect for a relaxed hangout with your friends or a date. It also has life sports screening and a rock music keeps playing, though not too loud, so you can enjoy your conversations. :)
The prices of food are inclusive of tax, and the quantity is good too, at a pretty affordable price, so you get a wonderful experience without burning a hole in your pocket. I would highly recommend this place to all!

Zomato users have rated this place really high but we were kind of disappointed with the food.

We had a Chicken Caesar salad which was average, Thai Spice Crispy Fish & Calzon Spice Chicken Wings, both were below average, the desserts were the saving grace. Both Chocolate tart and Chocolate mud pie tasted good.

Service is good, chairs are really comfortable, charging points are available, price is quite reasonable.

Chicken was well cooked. The sauce was Rich in pepper and had loads of mushrooms. The veggies were a tad bit bland.
The packaging was great, and there delivery service was on time with the food hot on delivery.
Overall -

**Pocket friendly cafes at its best!**

I visited this place on 20th Jan with my best friend. We weren't able to make any decision where to head, after our classes got cancelled. We both had this in our bucket list for quite sometime, and finally decided to visit.

We went there at an odd time. It was 4pm, so almost just after lunch. When we entered, it was devoid of any other customer. Sometimes i like that a lot, because i get to sit anywhere i like, and need not care about table manners!üòõ Anyways, the waiter was himself the cook, as it seemed to me, and the seating arrangement was scarce too. The decor was interesting and pleasing. There's a tv at one end, and cricket highlights were running at that time. So perhaps on match days, live matches are played, though this is my assumption. 

Now coming to the food items, we had ordered Roasted Chicken Sandwich, Oreo Shake and one Cold Coffee. The sandwich was sumptuous, Oreo Shake was also excellent. On 1st sip, the cold coffee seemed the weakest of them, but after stirring a bit, and the chocolate sauce getting mixed with the coffee, the cold coffee became our favourite! The quanity was average for the price, though the taste definitely adds to their positives!

One great positive thing about this place is, all the prices are inclusive of taxes. So add the price of the items, and that is what you've to pay! 

I would definitely love to visit this place again and again and try their other offerings.

I have been to this cafe with two of my friends for a taste of the "trendiness" on Zomato. It is located in between Lord's Morh and Prince Anwar Shah Crossing and lends its name from the its placing in the crossroad.

We went there in the late hours of evening at round 8 pm and ordered for an Espresso and two Cappuccinos. The order was taken quite swiftly and the staffs wore a sly smile on their face.

The beverages were served with a slight delay but that did not bother as we had a lot to talk among ourselves. The ambiance was neat but the idea was borrowed from one or more places and even the decor has few similarities from the other places. The place was lit bright with all lights blazing.

Once the order was placed, the serving style of the item made us smile. The prices were little on the higher side.

On an whole, a recommended visit!

One of the most unprofessional cafes in town. Placed an order from Swiggy for Chickey Burritos and Chocolate Montecarlo. Got a call from Swiggy that Montecarlo is unavailable and they replaced it with Chocolate  Mudpie. I was OK with it and they confirmed the order.

However, when the delivery guy went for collecting the order,  he was told that Burritos was out of stock and the guy from the restaurant tried replacing it with a Veg pizza. The worst part was the restaurant guy  was completely unapologetic. This is absolutely unacceptable. I'll make sure I never order from this cafe again.

Quite liked this place. Pleasant surprise on the corner of the road from where Lake Gardens bridge starts. We had a roast chicken lemon sandwich which was a-may-zing! Awesome flavours of the dressing, veggies were still crisp and the quantity was good too. We also had a Mediterranean chicken burger which had fried onion rings and cheddar and came with very crispy fries, all in generous proportions. The prices are very affordable. They do not charge taxes. Overall, a good, filling experience.

This quaint little cafe is easy to spot right at the start of the Lake Gardens flyover from the anwar shah road side.. Indeed the offerings of this cafe has been a breeze of fresh air and the perfect hangout spot for college goers as well as working professionals as well.. Coming to the interiors the cafe is not big, a few tables and the decor is quirky and colorful matching the taste of the gen y.. The brightand funny¬† inscriptions on the wall and the tasteful music being played add to the mood while sipping the mocktails.. However one major flaw is the lack of any proper and suitable washroom..Also servers were too naive and inexperienced failing to describe the dishes offered by them only..
Since we went in the evening for some light snacks, sampled the following:
Thai Spice Crispy Fish: Basa fish batter fried and tossed with hot basil sauce.. loved the crunchiness of the fish and the presence of sesame seeds add to the flavor..
Open Baked Crostini: Basically toasts topped with mushrooms and bell peppers and grilled with cheese on top.. creamy, soft as well as crunchy.. and the mushrooms tasted good as well..
Chocolate Tart: This was a complete disaster.. you expect a tart base to be crunchy and warm.. this one was cold and soggy and you could hardly taste the freshness of the tart..
Overall, a nice experience for a wintery evening and the good thing is they didn't charge any extra VAT.. Our total cheque was Rs. 450/- (all incl.) for 2 people..
Food: 4/5
Pricing: 4/5
Service: 3/5

We ordered calzone spice chicken which was pretty good. Along with that we ordered Hazelnut cold coffee, grilled chicken sandwich and chocolate mudpie in desserts. All of the items were good in taste. The place is ideal for a hanging out with small group of friends or family. Surely, you can pay a visit once.

We went to this place at around 12 noon. It had just opened and we were the first customers. The interior is beautiful and they were playing Cliff Richard songs which made for a really pleasant ambience. The staff is extremely courteous and polite. We stayed here for almost two hours.

We had a load of things and started off with the Classic Nachos. This dish needs some improvement. They need to use more cheese. The Cafe Latte was quite good - the flavor was strong. The Chicken Bitten Steak isn't really a steak. It's more of a fillet roasted in honey-mustard sauce. It was okay but there was nothing special about it. The BBQ Roasted Chicken Pizza was decent enough. They use BBQ sauce, the crust was thin and crunchy, but they really should use more cheese.

For dessert, we had Chocolate Tart and Chocolate Mudpie. The Tart was cold and tasted slightly stale. They don't make it. It was refrigerated. The Mudpie, on the other hand, was brilliant. I loved it.

Update: Went to this place again and tried out the Hazelnut Cafe Latte, Mexican Fries, Crispy Chili Chicken. My friend had the Passion Fruit Mojito and it was pretty good. The fries were crispy and spicy but not too much. I'll definitely try the Hazelnut Cafe Latte again. You can actually smell and taste the Hazelnut. Very few cafes get this right. The crispy chili chicken was tossed in schezhuan sauce. It was good and very filling. The quantity is enough for two people. However, the chicken pieces weren't really crispy.

I wanted to visit this place for a long time. At last got the opportunity. The decor.. Well I would not say it's a "spacy" place but I loved the wall paintings. For cafe it's an okay with respect to the space. Now the food.. Two things. Roasted BBQ chicken pizza and hazelnut cappuccino. It tastes heavenly. The pizza even though thin crust the toppings, the sauce, the chicken pieces and the cheese everything was on fleek. Hazelnut cappuccino.. If you are a coffee lover you would totally dig it. But a little disappointed with the roasted lemon chicken salad. It was very moderate. And we took virgin mojito which was as usual. Overall it's an awesome place to crash and chill with your people with quality food. Would love to visit again.

This is a small food joint at Mannar Khabar bus stop on Anwarsha road just in the beginning of the Lake Gardens bridge. The ambiance here is pretty good with nice English music. The food is cheap as they don't charge you any extra tax. Quantity of food they serve is absolutely value for money. Hazelnut cappuccino was quite good, mushroom omelet was superb, mud pie was not very perfectly made but wasn't bad either. So overall this is a nice place around South City to have something to eat at pocket friendly price while enjoying a good ambiance.

A relatively new cafe that's almost exactly on the main road! I came here a few months ago with my BFF. It's a small place with bright yellow chairs and decent music. We ordered the BBQ smoked chicken pizza and the Penne Al Pomodoro, along with cappuccinos. Gotta say, I wasn't expecting such good food here. The pizza was covered with smoky flavourful chicken and caramelised onions and tasted simply great. Just the right amount of cheese, too! The pasta was also yummy - the sauce was thick and chunky, the way I like it, and with the right level of spice. The cappuccinos were standard ones, nothing great, but the food really hit the spot. I'm most pleasantly surprised. Not too expensive either! Definitely worth a visit.

This place is a winner! Only problem so far is parking of vehicles...otherwise this quaint joint is vibrant, modern, pocket friendly and is a nice place to hang out with friends and family. Food is great...immense value for money. Could not say that about the Capuccino though... it was not that aromatic..

we had grilled fish with veggies and Roasted BBQ chicken pizza...both are quite good, the pizza was generously topped with chicken shavings and had a thin crust, unlike thick floury crusts served in the fast food chains..
Three pieces of grilled fish on a bed of veggies (should have had broccoli) in white sauce (super-tasty) nested in wanton sheets..great presentation, though placed in mains...can be enjoyed anytime...

The first thing that strikes you on entering this cafe is its easy and cosy ambience. With friendly, courteous staff and some soothing music, this is a great place to have a laid-back lunch. Now coming to the obvious attraction of any restaurant, the food here is great.  Both the quality and quantity of the food are very good and the best part is that it doesn't burn a hole in one's packet. The prices mentioned in the menu are tax-inclusive. If one is looking for a budget place to have a relaxed meal, this place would be a perfect fit.

Guess what! The caf√© is at the crossroads. Not very hard to spot. This place has a great ambience and good music. The staff are friendly and courteous. We asked for a knife to cut the cake we had brought along for friend's birthday. They offered to put it on a plate. They put the cake out on a plate, served extra plates and spoons for the cake and actually provided us with a candle and match sticks too! Later we asked for the cake to b taken away while the dishes we ordered, arrived. Before leaving when we asked for the cake, they had actually packed the cake up in a container. That was really nice of them.
Coming to the food, we ordered the Chicken bitten steak, veg lasagna with chicken, grilled fish with s/f veggies, picante chicken burrito and a mojito.
The chicken of the steak was really well cooked. It was very tasty. The burrito was yummy as well. The lasagna took a while to prepare but thats ok given how yummy it was with layers of cheese in it. The grilled fish was good too, but there were more veggies in it than fish. Overall the food experience was good. The dishes were filling.
Hope to frequent this place, because its cozy with great music and ambience.

This place has been on my checklist for a long time.
It is very easy to spot. 
Visited with a friend today.
Walking distance from Prince Anwarsha Road, this is  a hidden gem.
The ambience is good but when we visited during the late afternoon today, it was not crowded at all.
The staff is friendly and well behaved.
Service is good. 
All items in the menu are inclusive of tax.
Now, the food. 
We ordered, Calzon Spice Chicken Wings, BBQ Roasted Chicken Pizza and Chicken Mudpie. 
The Chicken Wings were perfectly cooked and delicious. 
The pizza was thin crust and cheesy. Really good.
The Mudpie was chocolaty but the presetation was not upto mark. 
Will visit this place again, soon.

Located at the foot of the Lake Gardens flyover.

This is a small yet interesting place with cartoons drawn on the wall depicting craze for food.

It basically boasts of a cafe type cuisine with wraps, sandwiches, pizzas, burgers and other beverages.

We ordered A chicken barbeque roast pizza which tasted awesome with that tangy and crunchy chicken.

A harissa chicken skewers which was the best of the lot.

Virgin Mojito was good, choco shake was bland and needed to be sweeter and the irish cold coffee too was fine.

Best part is that all prices are inclusive of tax hence its pocket friendly, all this we had for 1000.

Service takes a bit of time with food although the beverages are served fast.

Me and my friends wanted to explore different cafeterias in Kolkata. This was the first cafe that we explored. The place is average looking and is quite clean. The service is quite slow but they serve freshly made food which compensates for the delay.

We had a cheesy garlic bread, fish burger and a barbeque chicken pizza. Fish burger was apparently the speciality so we had to try. The fish fillet was nicely cooked but overall the burger was okay. The fries that were served with it were crispy and added more flavour to the burger.

The barbeque chicken pizza was served smoking hot. The chicken was juicy and fresh. Even the base was freshly made. They had applied a lot of barbeque sauce which over powered the flavour of other ingredients. Other than that the pizza was nice.

The best was the garlic bread. We had it with a few drops of olive oil. It was very cheesy and the herbs added to it just enhanced the taste to perfection.

Overall, an average looking place with reasonable prices.

I ordered one mexican fries and one grilled chicken in mushroom pepper sauce via their online ordering through zomato. Not only did they delay their delivery (1.5hrs from order time) but they also got the wrong food. They got the ultima nachos instead of the fries (well that's what the bill said) and they did get the chicken but there was no bill for it. This ended up in a half an hour delay where the delivery boy kept calling his manager to confirm his mistake. In the end i had to point out the menu for him and then pay, but just for the chicken. This is late into the night, and i wasnt willing to wait for their fries as the restaurant had already shut.
Firstly Crossroads, its not my responsibility to look into your delivery boys bag and see whether the food matches the bill. Secondly you sent the wrong bill, there was no bill for the chicken nor the fries but nachos. I would have ended up paying extra for the nachos, esp diff in current times when cash is so scarce. I cant imagine what would have happened if i paid by card! Adding to this, next time even if you do send the wrong bill its your responsibility to ask the delivery boy to check the food, not me.
Very disappointed.

The food was fine and so was the coffee and is enough to fill you up. But I'd rather not order what I did- Mexican fries with sour cream the next time I go there. The cream didn't compliment the fries at all and it tasted so wrong in my mouth.
The staff was really nice to us, even though they are a bit slow.
We didn't pay much though for the food- its pocket-friendly.

I finally managed to find my way to this delightful corner, courtesy my two friends. They are regulars here, apparently for the Hookah and Virgin Mojitos. Although, I did not try out their sheesha, they seemed quite satisfied with it. We ordered all the 3 variations of the Virgin Mojito, where White Peach was the best one and Passion Fruit tasted like medicine!

We then tried their Spicy Chicken Wings with BBQ Sauce which left us disappointed, though. For 180/- just three wings and that too, completely crisped up, wasn't what we were expecting. It tasted charred and a tad bit acrid.

Next, we had their Barbecued Chicken Pizza which was absolutely scrumptious! With thin crust, a generous dose of caramelized onions and chicken chunks, it was amazing! I will keep coming back for that again and again!

Lastly, we ate a salad, the one with Roasted Chicken with Lemon and Apricots. It was tangy and sour but the chicken was juicy and the fresh veggies, finely diced. The dried Apricots lent a very distinctive taste.

The entire meal, with four Mojitos, one salad, the pizza and wings, along with the Hookah came to a pocket friendly, 1260/-.

Thus, please do drop by at this cheerful den with pleasant service and appetizing food!

Small, quant, happy place in Prince Anwar Shah Road.. Very European cafe feel to it. Went there for lunch with my friends. You can simply sit there for a long time and have a good time with friends. 

Food is just amazingly delicious and so very reasonably priced. We ordered grilled chicken in pepper mushroom sauce, grilled fish with stir fried veggies, roast lemon chicken salad, ice teas. Food was yummy and very well prepared and quantity was awesome. 

Staff was courteous and friendly. This place also has a very good playlist. So i was extremely happy and satisfied with the music and highly recommend the place to others.

If you want a decent, classy place , this is it. The moment you enter, the decor the nice soft music( tge playlists are really awesome ),you're hopes will get high. Went there couple of times and... trust me, loved it. The drinks are so fresh, the food are so classic yet a little spiced up. From nachos, to fries, to burgers, sandwiches...I totally enjoyed. Burrito , was not so much liked though. My best dish would be the sandwiches.

I'm in love with their sandwiches and perfectly baked think crust pizza. It's soft and overloaded with loads of topping...extra cheese as a option will make it more tasty...forget ur calories for a while. Pesto barbeque chicken pizza will surely steal ur heart...all by best wishes to u guys. keep rocking...though I never got a chance to visit the cafe...it's always been a swiggy order satisfying my guests and mine hunger.  Do try their main course too chicken bitten steak is creamy and quite different served with risotto also grilled fish was yummy üòã

To end ur day take a bit in the chocolate mud pie...heavenly

After reading about so many experiences it was a must to do list that we would be visiting this cafe . This cafe is a hidden gem , there is absolutely no doubt about that . When you serve continental food at reasonable prices and they end up tasting good you are in for rewards . And , Crossroad Cafe had been conjuring a lot of them . We had a dinner last week and we had a more than a pleasant experience . 

¬∞ Location :- Okay , it is not that tricky . Those who have been travelling along prince anwar shah to South city must have seen the lake gardens bridge that takes you to southern avenue . The cafe is located at that crossroad between the anwar shah road and the bridge on your left if you are coming from tollygunj .

¬∞ Ambience & Service ( 3 / 5 ) :- This is where it lacks substance . Just a small cafe with few chairs and a television . The bar is located on you left just on the entrance . Although it's tiny and may seem claustrophobic , it is the food that had created the waves . As for the service , the service time is a lot . At some points we were almost loosing our patience but the food made up for that .

-------------------------------------

¬∞ Food :- The best part of this restaurant . I am always fond of eateries serving continental food in reasonable prices . Everyone loves it cheesy and grilled  . We ordered the following :- 

1. Fish burger ( 5 / 5 ) :- Yup, full marks . If yoh wanna make a list of what to compulsory in this city . This delicious fish burger from this joint must be on that list . Me and my foodie partner always share dishes but this was something we didnot want to . It has delicious buns , with a very tasty patty . Added with onion rings and an egg poach the burger is super delicious . A must must try for all . The French fries that is served with the dish are awesome . I am gonna come back for this .

2. Penne pesto & parmesan chicken pasta ( 4 / 5 ):- You don't get a good pesto pasta everywhere . But , we heard from the reviews and we ordered . And it was such an amazing decision . The pasta is sufficient for two . The pesto sauce was cheesy and just like it should be . Served with 2 pieces of garlic bread it is so so tasty . Much recommended .

3. Grilled chicken in pepper mushroom ( 5 / 5 ) :- Another full marks dish . 2 generous portions of breast portions served in super tasty pepper mushroom sauce and sauted veggies . Also accompanied by a super tasty and delicious herbed rice . The rice, sauce , veggies and chicken just compliment each other so good that you will complete the dish in a jiffy . There are grilled chicken dishes all around the city but I will list this one on the top . Please don't miss this , totally recommended .

4. Grilled fish in stir fried vegetables ( 3 / 5 ) :- Okay, so a lot of people have praised this dish . But , I felt that it has flaws . The dish is beautifully decorated and the first time it came to me we were amazed . The dish is decorated like a flower basket . It has small basa pieces and vegetables showered with cheese . The problem was that the pieces were small and very very few . We nearly counter 4 small . So, yrs it was a downer . Although there were generous amounts of veggies with a flood of cheese . But, I felt you can skip this . The other dishes are way more better .

5. Virgin mojito ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Decent drink to go with your meal . We are glad after ordering it . It served well for both of us .

---------------------------------------

¬∞ Verdict :- A must must visit . I would say that probably this is one of the best of prince anwar shah and if you are looking for continental fare at reasonable price then this must be your pick . Following are the main points :- 

1. The best fish burger in town .
2. Excellent grilled chicken .
3. Decent continental fare . Everyone had praised all the dishes that have been served .
4. No taxes . Another tax free hidden gem .

So, don't think twice and just dig your spoons in the fantastic dishes that are served here . I am sure you will have an amazing time .

Crossroad Cafe has gained immense popularity over the last few months and is now an imminent inclusion in every foodie's bucket list. A very strategic and easy location saves its customers the harassment of exploration. Good colour combination and graffiti on the walls ensures a joyous decor and the view from the inside is marvellous if one can acquire the table right by the window. They have a variety of offerings to choose from, Burritos being the main highlight. I was almost spoilt for choice before eventually opting for Chicken Lasagna, which, to my great surprise, sufficed two people. The taste impressed me as much as the quantity, giving me enough reasons to believe why other reviewers have regarded the quality of food highly. My hazelnut latte was smooth and tasty and so was my friend's oreo shake.¬†

It would be a little harsh to cite negatives about this lovely little cafe and I might well have been unlucky, but the service was annoyingly slow. I had to wait for about 40 minutes in an empty cafe to get an oreo shake placed at the table. Hoping to see the team bucking up in the service department a little. Very nice place otherwise.

Have been planning to visit this place for really long, and finally I managed to peep in. Locating this place was very easy as it is situated right at the beginning of Lake Gardens flyover. The decor is very simplistic with graffiti on the wall and basic tables and chairs, yet there's a very cozy and warm air. The service via decent. The waiter was prompt and the serving time was pretty fast.

Coming to the food. The portions are larger compared to other cafes and are good for two persons. I ordered chicken Harissa skewers for the starters and it consisted of five stripes of chicken stuck with toothpicks, too big to be called skewers. The Harissa sauce was rich, yet not very spicy. Overall it was a well balanced dish. I had chicken bitten steak with creamy asparagus risotto for the main course and it was more than enough for two persons. The risotto was amazingly delicious. Perfectly al dente grains of rice cooked with asparagus in a deliciously creamy sauce. The chicken steak was a bit dry, which is obvious, however the creaminess of the risotto did balance it perfectly. The parsley oil seasoning and a hint if garlic did add another dimension to the dish. It was a fantastic preparation as a whole, however I couldn't finish it. I wanted to end my lunch with cream bruelle or montecarlo ice cream with seasonal fruits, however none of those were available, so I wrapped up with a red velvet pastry. Well, not a fan of red velvet in general, however the pastry was good, if not great.

Would have given a 5 rating if cream bruelle was available. As of now 4.5. :)

Just visited this place yesterday afternoon. Its at the crossing where prince anwarshah connector bifurcates towards lake gardens. We mostly ordered based on recommendations by our friends. We were very hungry and the penne pesto parmesan was a welcome sight to our hunger pangs. It was really cheesy and yummy and was served with garlic bread. The pasta was followed by the fish burger. It comes with a poach, fries and onion rings. The first fish burger i've ever had. Was delicious. Not very juicy and unlike traditional burgers, was not dripping with sauce or mayo. To end the meal, we ordered a mudpie. It was decent. The servings are large and since it was just the two of us, we had a tough time finishing the food. We were so full that we could almost not move  :D Looking forward to trying the burrito bowls.

Went to this place for an early dinner. 
The place was completely empty as we went in, we were the only guests. I don't know if the place is usually this empty. 
The interiors are small, but the decor is interesting. All they have got a nice playlist playing in the background, and the volume is not too loud unlike some places, which allowed us to chat without literally shouting at each other. 
Coming to the food, we started with the classic nachos. They were covered with generous amounts of salsa, guacamole and sour cream. The guacamole however was in the form of a complete paste, I expected a few chunks of avocado. Anyhow, taste-wise, no complaints. 
Next we ordered the  parmesan pesto penne with chicken. The quantity was really overwhelming. It came with two pieces of garlic bread, and it's one of the best pastas I've ever had. Also the quantity of chicken in the pasta was pretty good, unlike some more expensive places. 
Then came the grilled chicken in pepper mushroom sauce. The quantity again was really overwhelming. The taste was also pretty good. No place for complaints. 
By this time we were already too full, but still wanted to taste a little dessert. And boy, there would have been some real regrets there if we didn't. We went for the red velvet pastry, and there is just one word to describe it - delicious! 
I would have rated this place 4.5, but the cherry on the cake was when we were brought the bill. All this food amounted to something around ‚Çπ870 which is pretty unbelievable in these times. 
Really enjoyed our visit and can't wait to revisit! Thumbs up to the team üëç

Quickly becoming the friendly neighborhood caf√© with upbeat atmosphere, friendly crew and consistent finger food. For a quick iced tea by oneself, or a chat with friends to working over a quiet bite, all are great possibilities in this newly minted caf√©. Their roasted lemon chicken salad is particularly recommended for folks who want a tangy tasty salad¬†without the heavy dressing. Kudos!

A small joint arrived with various types of lip-smacking foods like starters,main course and desserts.in a very small time of period Crossroad Cafe reached towards success.this place is quite small around 21-24 seaters at a time,decorated properly with the simple things like drawings all over the wall.ambience also was quite good.best part is the service and the foods just excellent.located in 40/1,Prince Anwar Shah Road.i was invited there by the management of Crossroad Cafe with my foodie friends.it was such a excellent experience for me.they prepared varities of signature dishes for the tasting session including some of the special dishes which they will serve within this month.

We went there during the puja days looking for a quiet place to sit n chill. It was a lil hard for us to locate the cafe as the locality was unknown for us. We called in for the directions they were quite helpful. We reached their the ambience wasn't too great n the place was quite cramped. We ordered grilled sausages: it was too rubbery n lost its taste, Thai pan fried fish : it was average and pasta which was really good n creamy. The service was really slow n we had to ask quite a few times for our order. Not a place for a real foodie..

I had seen a lot of friends putting up check-in saying AT crossroad cafe and I knew that I too had to be there.
I must say, it's a small place but the food here is yummy.
We started off with the famous "harrisa chicken skewers" and some "peach iced tea". For the main course we had "smoked BBQ chicken pizza" and "harrisa chicken platter".
We seriously wanted deserts, but we were so much full, that nothing more could be eaten.
Overall, pocket friendly and an amazing place with some great food and good music.

A very good and well to do place with a very good decor. Even the ambience is also good. The quality of food and the price goes hand in hand. But one thing is guyz pls don't order any tea or coffee in that place that is not upto the mark. Rest all items were good enough. All the sides are very well prepared with a different touch.
About the ambience it's very very good with a kiddish touch in it. A few items are a bit only overpriced but then again the quality they serve is very good to overcome the price for it.
In short a well to do place to be visited now and then with friends.

Tried the lemon chicken salad and cappuccino...
The salad was very good... though the tang could be toned down a little bit, the salad in itself was extremely amazing. The chicken pieces soft and the veggies fresh....  the coffee was good.
Overall good experience.

A cosy, small yet neat and tidy cafe. The place is soothing and the background music added to blissful ambience. Service was fast and the staff were soft spoken and friendly. No extra taxes added, the stop is absolutely pocket friendly. We had ordered:
1. Iced Tea-Lemon - Very refreshing after a hectic day.
2. Harissa Chicken Skewers - Perfect for a starter, zesty and juicy.
3. Penne with parmesan, mushroom, fresh herbs and add on chicken - Cheesy and creamy.
4. Chocolate Mudpie- Ultimate  treat to the taste buds.
Thoroughly enjoyed the food and drinks. Would be happier if they could just increase the seating arrangements and make the walls and decor more attractive and vibrant!

Visited this place yesterday... Well lit area with adequate seating capacity.  Looks neat and tidy.  The wall art looks very childish and the decor average.  
The service is prompt and polite.  
Tried their passion fruit mojito and the Mediterranean chicken burger.  
The mojito served in a fancy jar was too sweet and the passion fruit's flavor was too subtle. I am sure it can be made better.  
The Mediterranean chicken burger was prepared to perfection.  The bread was soft,  chicken patty was crispy on the outside and  soft/juicy on the inside.  The cheese,  jalape√±os and the onion rings added to the flavor and the crunch.  The fries served along with the burger was good too.  
Overall a nice experience... Would visit again to try the other items... 
The place looks promising,  just a little changes to the walls and the decor would certainly make it more appealing.  
Great job!!!

I had a lovely experience here today. The food is something that really deserves mention. The sandwiches are completely delicious and so is the oreo shake. In mains I tried the harissa chicken and the cilantro rice. They both tasted heavenly. I deducted a 0.5 since the spoons had a pungent odour. But rest ambience, hospitality,food, location are all in the top notch.

this is one of my favourite destinations in kolkata when i look for a western style caf√©/restaurant. situated just in the crossing of prince anwar shah road and lake road, the crossroad cafe is a must visit place for all the mexican and western food lovers. they also tried to give it a countryside western look. we ordered Mushroom jalapeno & cheddar omlette, black eyed bean burrito and pizza chipotle. every item was delicious with sufficient quantity.service was very good. menu price is bit expensive though the quality of the food will never let you complaint about it. definitely i will give it a second visit soon.

They made each and every item so nicely,nicely presented and quantity it's good enough. The most attractive thing in this place is they decorate it so nicely. Maintained very well. Love this place and want to visit again. 

YOU GUYS HAS DONE GOOD JOB AND THANK YOU SO MUCH TO MADE MY EVENING VERY SPECIAL.

In love with the Mediterranean burger. 
I have mostly ordered it in,  but it is amazing.  The pita and hummus was really good too. Keep it up.

I had a lovely experience here today. The food is something that really deserves mention. The sandwiches are completely delicious and so is the oreo shake. In mains I tried the harissa chicken and the cilantro rice. They both tasted heavenly. I deducted a 0.5 since the spoons had a pungent odour. But rest ambience, hospitality,food, location are all in the top notch.

this is one of my favourite destinations in kolkata when i look for a western style caf√©/restaurant. situated just in the crossing of prince anwar shah road and lake road, the crossroad cafe is a must visit place for all the mexican and western food lovers. they also tried to give it a countryside western look. we ordered Mushroom jalapeno & cheddar omlette, black eyed bean burrito and pizza chipotle. every item was delicious with sufficient quantity.service was very good. menu price is bit expensive though the quality of the food will never let you complaint about it. definitely i will give it a second visit soon.

The place really well done, bright walls and casual setting. I ordered a Latte which was pretty well made. The for main course we ordered a Chicken Bitter Sweet Steak with Risotto, Pesto Chicken Pizza and Mud pie. The food was very filling for the two of us and it was delicious. The Risotto was a personal favourite.

Talk about the wisdom to know what exactly a caf√© menu should have as offerings or call it the punctuality of their delivery service or be it the quality of food ¬†- I hardly find any shortcomings that would not let me give this place a 5 star. And I admit they have a decent well thought of pricing ! 

I ordered for home delivery twice and both times I got the delivery smack on time. 

Their pastas are my personal favourite. I keep ordering penne in pesto and penne with mushroom and herbs in white sauce. Pasta is a tricky dish ‚Ä¶ If not well cooked the penne would get hard and rubbery later. Also if the sauce is not cooked to perfection and done in haste without giving it proper simmer time, the smell of the raw flour would kill the taste. However, I am so satisfied with the way they cook their pasta , soft and tender and the sauces of the pastas so delectable and silky smooth - that literally the pasta melts in your mouth.

I also ordered grilled fish with saut√©ed veggies . I am amazed to see the variety of veggies they provided with a reasonable pocket pinch - it had generous quantities of red, green and yellow bell peppers and tad bits of cauliflower, zucchini, baby corn and mushrooms . I am very impressed .

I would like to visit the caf√© in person someday soon (till which I am saving back the last 0.5 star) and would highly recommend it .

I was a regular customer of this restaurant and the food is really good..there is no doubt about it..but recently i ordered food (spaghetti with garlic bread) for home delivery through swiggy from this place and it was disgusting.The Spaghetti was not fresh which you could tell immediately even by taking a look..the bread was hard like a rock and I even found a hair in the box -_-.I immediately complained but got a pretty reluctant response which is completely unexpected.I would have rated it much better but that incident totally changed my opinion about the restaurant.

Loved this small cafe at the corner of prince Anwar shah flyover. Went for a quick bite. Ordered ultimo nachos and a cup of Assam tea. The ambience and the service is extremely good especially the music that they play. After a long visited a cafe in Kolkata where the music was not obnoxious. Will definitely visit again and try their main course which looked tempting.

Well I experienced an extraordinary delivery service from Crossroad cafe. Came across them on zomato and ordered a bulk food delivery of several dishes.

- Roast chicken salad (for my nonveg friends)
- Veg Greek Salad
- Chipotle Pizzas
- 4 topping pizzas
- Sweet corn balls
- Thai fish
- Mexican fries

The food came in neartly packed with proper instructions on how to use the sauces and dips!

The food was very very tasty!

The restaurant staff personally delivered the food and was cordial and very helpful. Special thanks to Subhojit from the team!

Definitely visiting them at the cafe soon!

Looking for a place to chill out with friends? And great food is a major criterion? Crossroad cafe is the saviour indeed. This new caf√© isn‚Äôt just your regular place for coffees and conversations. This place is also about afternoon brunches, evening get-togethers and dinner with friends and family. Crossroad cafe is a quaint family cafe that specializes in Italian and Mexican.

Location : Crossroad cafe is tucked at one corner of the road at the beginning of the Lake Gardens flyover. So if you are heading from South City to Prince Anwar Shah, get down at Mannar Khawar walk a few steps towards Lake Gardens fly over and bang on at the right corner is Crossroad.

Staffs: The cafe is an initiative of entrepreneurs Adarsh Kajaria and Rakhi Kajaria. Mr. Vishal Kajaria also is an amazing host. The chefs are extremely skilled personnel who knows the art of crafting food. The serving staffs are extremely prompt, amicable and ready to serve.

Decor and Ambience: Crossroad is a small little cafe with a seating arrangement of nearly 25 people. The brightly lit caf√©, with animated characters on the wall and colourful chairs, will appeal to your quirky side. The sausage with potato wedges in the hand, the coloured tiles, the earthern lampshades will give you the hint of an European caf√©. To top it all, the English classics played is a solace indeed.

Food and Beverages: From the innumerable visits I have been to Crossroad, I have tasted the following delicacies on their menu.

Drinks -

1. Mango passion twist

2. Sparkling espresso

3. Passion fruit lemonade

4. Virgin mojito
                                          ...

Situated just at the foot of the lake gardens flyover...this is q small cafe cum food joint. The d√©cor is extremely simple and cozy. We ordered a few mocktails, cheese garlic bread, chicken skewers and a thin crust BBQ chicken pizza which I  heard amazing reviews about. All the food tasted good except for the mojito which I ddnt quite like. The pizza as expected was very crunch and juicy .. but had too much of a tangy flavour. Special mentions to the staff who are extremely friendly. One of my colleague even broke a glass by mistake but the mess was cleared in seconds and they did it with a happy face. Kudos  for that guys! 
I vote it a 5 pointer for its convenient location and food array,and as it becomes one of our after office hangouts spot...

A small, clean, well organised cafe with quick service and great food at reasonable price...well that summarizes Crossroad cafe. We ordered green apple lemonade which was refreshing, lemon chicken salad which was fresh, chicken skewer which was soft and spicy, bbq chicken wings were extremely delicious. Being impressed with all these food we ordered ultimate nachos which didnt really impress us. Also we got free wifi.

Decent small cozy and appealing caf√© situated in a very beautiful location. The food is on point. So are the beverages. Availability of every item on the menu is a question mark. Didn't get the desired flavoured ice tea( raspberry, to be specific) in spite of being in the menu. Rest assured whatever was available was on point. Look forward to visiting it again. Hospitality pretty homely. Do visit the place for some friendly evening hang outs. Thanks for reading. Have a great day. Peace. üôÇ

Want to have a quick bite, catch up with friends or first date at a pocket friendly yet peppy place? This is the place to be. Located right across the street on the Lake Gardens Flyover, this cafe has ¬†made its mark amongst the the innumerable cafes that have recently come up in South Kolkata. This place will instantly lift your mood with its bright and vibrant ambience as soon as you enter. It's a neat and tidy, 20-seater. Oh Wait! do not go by the size of the cafe 'cause the food makes up for everything else. Coming to what we ordered:
1. Caramel Cold Coffee: A very distinct flavour of caramel with blended coffee espresso and milk. Highly recommended for the ones who loves caramel.¬†
2. Fruit Sangria- Served in a mason jar this non-alcoholic drink was quite refreshing. Contains cranberry juice, apple juice, soda, sangria syrup and lemon juice. To add further taste there was wholesome slices of fresh fruits like watermelon, kiwi and melon.¬†
3. Classic Nachos- Served with cheese sauce, sour cream, salsa and an avocado dip. Highly recommended.
4. Garlic Bread Mozzarella- This is for the ones who love their garlic bread with oodles of mozzarella and oh! this one was yum.¬†
5. Pan-Fried Gnocchi- roasted in bell pepper sauce with spinach, mascarpone and parmesan cheese. This was served with garlic bread and topped with caramelised onions. The sauce was good, however, I have had better gnocchi than this.¬†
6. Falafel Wrap : These succulent wraps was filled with pickled eggplant in tomato, tahini and parsley salad. Perfect!¬†
Friendly staff, vibrant ambience and great food! What more is needed! Would definitely like to visit this place again sometime soon.¬†
Crossroad you have been doing a good job! :)¬†Cheers!

This cafe is located near South city, at the lake gardens crossing. Very easy to find. We three people visited the cafe and ordered one pesto bbq chicken pizza, one chicken supreme pizza, and one chicken sandwich. The sandwich is one of the best I have eaten so far. Coming to pizzas, bunk domino's and pizza hut; and try pizza here. Starting from the crisp thin crust from the succulent topping every bite was delicious. Chicken in topping or in the filling was so juicy and tender. We actually could taste the chard grilled flavour of the bbq chicken. Overall awesome food, and nice music. Do visit this place.

This is a tiny caf√© tucked away right where the lake garden flyover ends. Minimalistic decor with cool background music, this place offers tasty grub at amazingly cheap prices. We ordered calzon spiced chicken wings with bbq sauce, an true example of grilling perfection and along with that, harissa chicken skewers. For drinks, we tried a number of mocktails like blueberry mojito, white peach mojito and mango passion twist. The mango passion twist deserves special mention. We also gorged on mediterranean chicken burger, fish burger, smoked chilli chicken sandwich with melted mozarella, grilled chicken sandwich and also barbeque roasted chicken and chicken bitten steak. The sandwiches and burgers are delicious, the patties well cooked. We ended our meal with a sinful chocolate mud pie and monte carlo chocolate. Though the food is sumptuous and really pocket friendly, the service is really slow. But all in all, I loved the place and looking forward to visiting again sometime soon!

It's a pretty cool place to hang out with friends!
Bright and simple interiors with extremely well behaved staff.
Coming to the food....it wasn't exactly awesome but fair enough!
The raspberry iced tea was flavourful but with way too many ice cubes..... the taste got diluted!
The Oreo shake was a stunner! Absolutely amazing!
I personally liked the lemon flavoured chicken salad.... fresh and tangy..... just that the quantity was a bit too less!
The burrito bowl was perfect.... a complete dish in itself.
The pan fried gnocchi was spicy and tasted great after the salad!
We were even offered a complimentary bubblegum flavoured beverage....
This was our first time but hopefully not the last!
Keep up the good work Crossroad Cafe team!

( both the pizzas were great.8 slices.thin crust. Very filling)
4.grilled fish with veggies.( generous amount of cheese was there. Lots of veggies.fish was tasty too)

The prices on the menu card were tax inclusive.

Overall a nice experience.
All the best! :)

This was on my list for a long time and finally i did visit the place. 
As you walk it the colour scheme refreshes you instantly. It is a beautiful place perfectly done..
Now coming to the food , i have  heard so much about this place that i was eager to sample some of the food and mocktails. 
I wanted something light so we ordered " Roast Lemon chicken salad", found it to be fresh infused with cherry tomatoes, iceberg lettuce which added to the crunchiness and the fresh roasted chicken bits. I enjoyed this lip smacking salad.
The "ultimato nachos" was nachos laid on a bed of gooey cheese topped with vegetables and soya paste. A nice finger food that you can snack upon while you have some peppy talk with frds.
" Caramel cold coffee" was a beautifully presented tasty drink
"Grilled Fish .." was beautifully done fish superbly presented and equally palatable.
Really it was an overall grwat experience which was further agmented by the friendly and attentive service of team crossroad..keep up the good work!!

Continental is now just a step away for South Kolkatans. Fulfilling yet reasonably priced, Crossroad cafe is one of the best hubs for chitchats over coffee and some lip smacking food. Been there only once for a friend's birthday celebration only to be awestruck by the great ambience, the amicable and prompt staff. The interiors are brightly lit with stylish lights. The graffiti on the walls, perfect for one who beckons food, are something to watch out for. Worthy of mention are the Mango smoothie, the delectable chicken ceaser salad and the grilled fish that comes in a basket, stuffed with grilled vegetables and oodles of mayonnaise. Will hop in soon! Till then keep rocking!

It's a nice small place, conveniently located, which serves good food. The menu range is small, but it's better than having a large menu and ruining the same. I agree with other reviews that it's a nice cozy place where one can hang out with friends. Overall, it's a feel good place.

A rainy evening deserved a good cup of tea and i am glad to discover this place in the vicinity. A small cozy shelter with bright colors around and hospitable service Crossroad cafe is quiet a preference for me. ¬†being less skeptical about food i am a person to go for easy options and also eager on trying others. I went for a simple order for Assam Tea, Chicken Coriander omelette, and Cal zone spicy chicken wings in BBQ sauce. Chicken coriander omelette was simply mouth melting. The fluffy beaten egg dissolved leaving behind a fresh feel of coriander. I simply loved the piece used to serve tea, if the milk is not added it gives you a feel of fresh brewed coffee beer -hot thought :-P

Calculating the total experience, the place made my rainy evening indeed a beautiful one and the menu had lots of reasons to convince me for a further and more frequent visits very soon. Only a small suggestion for the cal zone chicken, considering myself as a more spicy person by food, the preparations as named was really sweet and did turn off my palate a bit, so if the words a maintained then let the wings be spicy for people like us. Cheers!!

Aha..one more cafe with a fresh feel and aura packed with innovative and awesome goodies. The interior is great for some quick pix..and if its raining, the view from inside has some feel of nostalgia (I was the lucky one on the day I visited the same). Ordered chicken skewers, chicken burritos and one lemonade drink which were really yummy! Looking forward to a second visit.

Thanks to zomato I came across this place. A small, bright youthful cafe, brightly lit and was playing rock music, at once won my heart. The sevice too was very impressive. Although, the food was not upto my expectations. Never order food online from this place, for all the plus things about this place is their ambience. The only good thing about it was the pizza... and that's all! If you are looking for a place for meeting some friends somewhere nearby, you can give it a try, but that's all...

Crossroad Caf√© is located literally at the crossroads between the Prince Anwar Shah Road and the Lake Gardens Flyover giving it quite the advantage of being located in a city hotspot yet far enough away from South city mall not to be hampered by it. 
The ambience is great, absolutely loved the music there, quite nostalgic. The number of seats are limited but it's perfect. The staff is courteous too.
Now, coming to the food. The menu is on par with that of many fine dining restaurants and is definitely not that of a usual cafe. 
The White Peach Mojito and the Passionfruit Mojito were some of the most refreshing drinks I have had in a while with perfect balance of cold and flavor.
Coming to the dishes, I very much loved the Picante Chicken Burrito. It is probably the best Burrito I've had in the city and very comforting in its flavor. 
But the dish of the day was definitely the Chicken Bitten Steak with the cheesy Risotto. I'm personally not a fan of risotto but this was simply delicious.
Im definitely going back to sample more food someday. This was one hell of a caf√© and should be taken as a benchmark of what caf√©s should be in the city.

#Location: just at the junction of prince anwarsah road and lake road. Very easy to spot.
#ambience: a small cafe with small sitting area. Small but nice. You will feel relaxed when you will be sitting by the window side tables.
#food: food is juz amazing. I order Capuchino, Oreo shake, one pizza chipotle. All of them were absolutely delicious.
I will say about pizza chipotle.. Its the best thin crust pizza I ever had in my life. Juz too good. If you are a pizza lover you gotta try this for once.
#staff: people over there are welcoming and good. 
Overall had a soothing and pleasant experience. I m going back soon to try other dishes, specially the sandwiches..

A large number of cafes have mushroomed all across the city, completely challenging the motto of the CCDs and the Baristas ‚Äì ‚Äòmediocre food, higher than average prices and to compensate the mediocrity long sitting time‚Äô.¬† Even a decade back cafes were associated with the culture of ‚Äòsitting with a drink‚Äô where food wasn‚Äôt given much priority. But today small eateries like Crossroad Caf√© have challenged this theory and motivated the caf√© scene of Kolkata to undergo a complete transformation. Today food is as important in caf√© as it is for a fine diner and there is no room for mediocrity. When it comes to food and its quality Crossroad Caf√© can give many a fine dinners of the city a run for their money. Their strategic location at the crossing of Prince Anwarshah Road and Lake Gardens flyover, but far away from the maddening crown of South City just adds to their coveted status.,

However, the stand-out for me was their Fish burger. It was a hearty little burger with a well-cooked patty with a mustard sauce, cheese, a sunny side up and crispy onion rings. The fish was not lost in the bread and accompaniments, and remained the focus, in spite of the paraphernalia.

The small kitchen space didn‚Äôt stop Executive Chef Mr. Subroto Chakraborty from dishing out the dishes one after another, at a commendable pace. Also, it was great to know that most of the pickles and dips too are made by the team and are not store-bought.

Crossroad cafe is perhaps one of the best cafes in South Kolkata. They keep a check on even the minor things and they are doing a pretty good business when it comes to customer satisfaction. 
My picks from Crossroad cafe are roast lemon chicken salad,  thai spice crispy fish,  black eyed bean burrito,  falafel wrap,  BBQ roast chicken pizza.

Exquisite music that tuned well with the d√©cor and the wall designs. Food we ate was worth the money. The main course items go for 400-450 rupees each of the same quality in other restaurants , so it was cheap that way. Would love to go again. Please include non-chocolate desserts.

It's a small cosy caf√© in Prince Amar Shah Road. Since it's a new caf√©, they don't levy any kind of taxes or vat, hence the place is quite reasonable. I had gone there with my sister. I had Virgin Mojito and she had Passion fruit Mojito. Both were good and chilled with that subtle mint flavour. As we were full, we only had starters there. For starters we had taken Harissa Chicken skewers. They consist of five chicken skewers cooked in that spicy and tangy Harissa flavours. The other dish that we took was Thai Crispy Chicken in Hot Basil Sauce. I liked this dish more since the fish was crispy as well as had that basil flavour, which tasted delicious. The service is good but van be much better. The decor is good. It's a good place for a quick bite.

On my second visit to this place just a few days back, I had a good experience yet again. My forms and I had gone there. We had orders their much recommended BBQ Chicken Pizza which had the right amount of cheese and it was medium size and enough for two persons. It was thin crust which is a positive thing. I loved the taste. Next we had ordered Grilled Fish which was good too. The fish pieces were cooked to perfection and the combination of white sauce with garlic bread and saut√© veggies with the fish was a liking to my taste buds. Both these dishes were good and quite heavy since back home, I had to skip lunch.

Crossroad cafe is one of those small cafes which gives more of a coffee place feeling rather than an eatery but my intuitions were proved wrong when I walked in to this place on Sunday evening for a quick snack.

Ordered for Chicken Ceaser Salad and Chilli chicken sandwich for a food. I really loved their sandwich and its one of the must try here.Salad was decent though.
In Drinks opted for Ice tea and Americano (Black Coffee) along. Lemon Ice tea was made well and the flavour was quite distinctive. Coffee was strong which was expected.
 In desserts tried Choco mouse which was decent in taste. I am rating them high as the price is also very reasonable enough for a cafe like this.
Will come back for more may be next time as I have seen a big menu offerings in their kitty. Will wait until I am back here again :)

Bright and well lit..nice hangout place with friends..reasonable food with good quality !!
Jumping to the food we ordered virgin mojito, oreo shake, sweet corn balls, pizza.
All were good to taste.
Special Mention- Oreo shake and sweet corn balls just swept me off my feet..!

A brunch lover should not miss out on this place. It's so bright and clean. When you're out with a couple friends and just wanna talk and eat, this is the place that you'd want to visit. This place is so clean and tidy. Everything has a new charm and that's the thing I loved about this caf√©. The pizza was extremely delicious. I tried the BBQ Chicken Pizza, it had enough slices to feed 4 people. The mason jars are a nice touch. Please do order the Chocolate Mud Pie. Its not much in quantity compared to the price but it's so delicious. The vegetarian dishes are not so bad either. I'd definitely try the pasta next time. I am very happy with the service. They would serve us with a gentle smile on their faces. The small tables are so cute and comfortable. I hate large tables where you have to shout and talk to the person on the other side of the table. The whole concept of confidentiality goes down the drain. It's right beside my college. So I'll be a regular. The location is so convenient. It's a walking distance from Navina cinema and lords more. If you follow Google maps, it's 800 mts from Lake Gardens Railway station.

Situated at a prime location right near lake gardens flyover. Easily accessible via public transport or private vehicles, this place is a big cafe chain in the making. They serve the most amazing multi-cuisine food in such prices in kolkata i believe. Well cooked and well seasoned. I have had the sandwiches, the burrito and the burger. All of then were top notch and very reasonably priced. I would definitely go back there for more the next many times.  The interior is well designed and is very cozy. The ambience is very soothing and service is super fast. The behaviour of the staff was very pleasant. I would definitely recommend this to all the cafe goers in the city to check this place out. It is amazing.

I read many fellow experts reviews and recommendations and finally came here to justified my taste buds..

CrossRoad cafe is small and well decorated small cafe opened where lake gardens flyover started.

We took a seat and ordered two Ice tea. One is peach and another is lemon. Both tasted average.

Roasted chicken salad was bland and had no taste. Dish decoration was good. Chicken were juicy.

Burrito bowl was very bad.. I dont like the taste.

Bbq chicken pizza was good. I liked the taste but its too much sweet. Added salt to the pizza to reduce the sweetness.

One thing am want to mention that the service was blazing fast. That is why am giving 3.5*; else 3* is enough..

Very poor experience.

During the initial days of caf√©-style dining in Kolkata, the city saw a rapid rise in the number of hookah parlours trying to match the concept. But the true features of an authentic caf√© are found in cafes present in European and American styles. The city is still lacking an abundance of such cafes, but Crossroad Caf√© has been doing pretty well in its field of work. It has been throwing light on the standards and the true meaning of caf√©.

The place is located at the crossing of Prince Anwar Shah Road and Lake Gardens Road and can be spotted easily, being located just a few steps from the crossing. The place is a typical 20-seater caf√©, which not being grand on size but is grand on the food, which is much important. Though the place is small, the seating arrangement has been managed in such a way that it seems pretty spacious. Bright colours and a peppy ambience is what livens up this place. The coloured lights, graffiti on the walls and raw brick design are also well thought of while setting up the interiors. The chairs are colourful, sturdy and comfortable at the same time. The music playing in the background is also soothing.

Well they boast of serving food without any artificial colours and preservatives. The sauces are all kitchen made and are without any additives. All this great stuff under a pretty convenient price tag which is rare to find these days.

At first I thought that it will be difficult to locate this place but to me sheer astonishment I found it at one go as its located just on prince Anwar shah road and if you come from BRC one can see the well lit glow sign board which is clearly visible on the left side just before the crossing. Parking was also easily available on the opposite lane. 
Crossroad cafe is the first baby of Mr. Kajarias who have surely mastered the art in hospitality. Also got to meet new friends

Till the time I didn't visit the place... I was bit confused about such a high rating for it... and the confusion goes on until the food and beverages get served...

I expected the space inside to be quite big but it was not so... but the interior was very beautifully decorated with their homemade prickle bottles and some wall painting as well... and the music will take you to a new world... it was so pleasing...

‚ô°‚ô°‚ô° Fish burger¬ª¬ª¬ª Now these one is the show stellar of the day... my friends are so hungry that they ate it all... I only got a chance to take a bit of it... it's insane... highly recommended...(forget to take the photo of it, sorry for that guys)...

#Sandwiches#
‚ô° Smoked chilli chicken¬ª¬ª¬ª Awesome one... served with garlic bread and fries... and the sides are excellent too... they didn't comprised with the quality of the sides... it's gr8...

#Pizzas#
‚òÖ Pizza chipotle chicken¬ª¬ª¬ª Good... but not extraordinary...

#Main Course#
‚ô°‚ô° Panko fried fish¬ª¬ª¬ª Excellent... the fish was so fresh and the coating was tasty too...
‚ô° Grilled fish with S/F veggies¬ª¬ª¬ª I like the presentation of the dish... also it tasted mind blowing...

This place is a new comer in the crowd of numerous food joints in Prince Anwar Shah Road area and has gained popularity among the youngsters very soon. Located at the end of the Lake Gardens Flyover (Prince Anwar Shah Road Side), it's very easy to locate.
I had been there with my sister yesterday evening. It was a great meal.
At first we had taken the Harrissa rubbed chicken skewers. The portion was a standard one. The flavours of Harrissa could be differentiated distinctly. It was spicy, flavourful and delicious.
Next came a Thai fish in hot basil sauce along with seasame and lemongrass. The fish was deep fried, everything okay. The dish looked beautiful. Lemongrass flavours were present to the fullest but the taste was too bland. I think it should have been a bit more spicy or tangy, maybe. When asked for feedback, I expressed my views to the manager. He just shrugged off and say it is this way only and that is how people like it.
Then came the much revered Smoked Chilli Chicken Sandwich along with Mozarella Cheese. This was just so good. Perfect! I loved it very much. Creamy, cheesy and spicy made to perfection.
Lastly, we had the Panko Fried Fish with Mango and Tartare Sauce. The fish was crispy, deep fried, the coating was total yummm. The mango tartare had an innovative twist in it. I loved it more with the Mango Kasundi they served when I asked for something tangy. It was so good.
Later we had no place for desserts. So didn't try any of them. Must say that staffs are courteous. They served us happily and simultaneously handled my toddler niece by gifting her Oreo cookies and keeping her engaged. The place is well decorated, well lit. Loved the theme. Everything was very good except for the Thai fish part. That is it. Happy Dining! :)

I have been to this place twice so far and it has never disappointed me on both the occasions.

LOCATION AND INTERIORS :

- The location of this cafe is perfect. It is on opposite of lake garden's bus stand and is situated on the crossing which makes it easily accessible.
- The theme and the decoration of the interiors is on point with amazing graffiti painted on the walls. It has a Television, Air conditioners as well as WiFi where people can basically chill and chat together over a cup of coffee.
- The interior is small like most cafes but it is spacious at the same time.

FOOD AND BEVERAGES :

- The food here is second to none. I had ordered a BBQ roasted chicken pizza, Penne al pomodoro pasta and two cups of Americana and Cappuccino coffee. All the items were definition of perfection.
The BBQ roasted pizza was made the way I like it. It had a thin crust and was well garnished with spices herbs, cheese and chicken. It is love at first bite. It was also quite big with 8 slices for only Rs 240 which is not only cheaper than pizzas at Dominos and Pizza Hut but also much larger and better in taste for the given price. The Penne al pomodoro pasta was my favorite here. They make the pasta in any sauce of your choice. I got mine made in mixed (red + white) sauce and it was one of the best pastas I had eaten in a long time. Also the quantity was adequate and can easily fill a person's stomach alone.
The Cappuccino and Americana coffee was well made. They have different types of sugar such as regular sugar, brown sugar and sugarfree available to alter the taste of the coffee according to one's preference.

- The best part of this place is the affordable PRICE of all the items compared to most of the popular cafes and restaurants. It is an instant favorite for school friends, college buddies and couples as it is a very friendly environment to hangout as well as pocket friendly.

- Another amazing part is that they do not charge any type of TAX on the food. No VAT and no SERVICE TAX.

SERVICE :

- The servicing is top notch in this cafe. They are quite quick in serving the dishes and taking orders.
- The waiters are very polite and well spoken and professional. Also they try to recommend some of their specialties as well if you are unable to decide what to order. They are also good at explaining how each food item is like before ordering them and assist you without hesitation.
- A cafe that says "Welcome" to the customers the moment they enter and "Goodbye, have a great day!" when they leave, are very loyal to their customers and is evident through their services.

I never usually rate any cafe, restaurant or outlet a 5/5. But this place surely deserves it. I would suggest everyone to visit it at least once. It will be a very great experience.

The moment you step in, the cafe will scream of comfort and colours. Comparatively new to the eatery business the crossroads cafe is all set to be the prime hangout zone for youngsters. Located on a busy street near the lake gardens flyover this cafe has a soothing yet bright ambience.
The food is absolutely cracking and delicious.
Loved the #Mexican fries and #burritos.
The burritos are quite fulfilling and treats your taste buds with warm flavors.
Another favorite here is the classic nachos, it defines my version comfort food. If you are a risotto lover, then they have the perfect dish for you in the menu.

On a rainy evening we checked into Crossroad cafe. It was small but the ambience was superb; well decorated with yellow chairs and soothing music was being played. We tried mexican , one burrito bowl chicken and one herissa chicken served with calintro rice and side salad and those turned out to be super delicious. I am totally satisfied with the food quality, quantity and customer service as well. As we were full could not try desserts and mock tails. Spent the evening awesome there. Wish to visit again and explore other food items.

Ultimate happiness is, getting food delivered at your doorstep when you are hungry as hell doing nothing In some super lazy Sunday evening. Indeed a good meal which I Have ordered from swiggy. They were serving a combo of barbeque roasted chicken pasta, non veg pizza with garlic bread @ rs 315. It must be paradise for pasta lovers if I'm not wrong. The way they packed all the items, I found it very attractive. Decent quantity, encountered nothing negative. Wish to visit there with close ones.

The ambience, with mostly well known country songs being played in the background, and the soothing music to tag along with the delicious food. Not much else that you can ask for actually, especially when combined with the reasonable price that you are required to pay for all the above. It's small in size but packs quite a punch. 'Little chilli, very hot' as one of my teachers used to say back in school.

Ordered Food from here 2 times in this month. Quantity wise the price is reasonable. I ordered both chicken burritos, Chicken steak and chicken BBQ pizza and also chicken sandwich.Specially the pizza and burritos are very good in taste. I ordered via Zomato but the delivery time is more than mentioned.In all way not a bad experience and the quality of food is good.

Cute lil place tucked in the ground floor of a building near the junction of lake gardens bridge and prince anwar shah. Though not spacious enough, the seatings inside are done in canteen style , old english numbers and bright lights make it s great place for friendly hang outs. The washroom is separate , the common one at the backside of the building. Staff is very polite and serves efficiently. But what takes away the cake is the food...Brilliant cooking to say the least!
We had
HARISSA CHICKEN SKEWERS
THAI SPICE FISH TOSSED IN HOT BASIL SAUCE
PESTO CHICKEN BARBEQUE PIZZA
CHICKEN BITTEN STEAK WITH SWEET POTATO STRAW AND RISOTTO 
GRILLED FISH WITH VEG IN CRISPY PASTRY BASKET WITH CAPER LIME SAUCE HERBS AND PAPRIKA

The dishes tasted extravagant and greatly quantitative in terms of the reasonable pricing. I recommend the first four dishes, specially the skewers and pizza are must tries.

P.s. The only point i felt of deducting half a mark was that the grilled fish that we had didnot match the description in menu at all. The pastry basket was missing, sauce was far away from caper lime, tasted like some spicy mango pickle, the vegetables were missing instead had some 'tikia' kind of thing that came along with the fish with addition of mashed potato . On inquiring we were told it was the same dish as we ordered but chef had served it without a pastry basket today. However i felt this was not the case. So i would request the servers to take down orders carefully and priorly inform the guests in case the dish or any of the accompanying sides aren't available.

Cute little place where you get mocktails in pretty mason jars. Pizza is thin crusted and really cheaper if compared to Dominos or pizza hut. Enough for two people if you're an average eater. Also tried their harissa skewers. It's a tangy and tasty African dish served with salad. Overall the place is cheerful.

In search of a good cafe (not CCD or Barista) my journey was destined to Lake Gardens all the way from Rajarhat, that too after a hectic work schedule.
Well, I actually went there after viewing zomato rating with a pretty high expectation but as soon as I entered I was somehow not that much happy. The interior was not that much soothing, neither was caf√© type. It's a small joint with minimum decor. Kept my finger crossed for the food.
When got served with delicious nachos I was quite happy until I ordered chicken steak served with sweet potato fries. It was quite average. The only satisfying part was the bill. 
Hope to come across a better caf√© next time. Till then search continues.

Located just beside Mannar Khabar sweet shop (the road which connects prince anwar shah road and southern avenue, it is there at the prince anwar shah side). Anyway not very spacious but very comfy. Tried cappuccino, cafe latte and calzon spice chicken wings served with homemade BBQ sauce and I just love the dish. It is very tasty.
There was some sort of chef's special items going on when I visited and ordered a pizza and yes that was good too.

The place is near mannar khabar,that is if you are coming from jadavpur thana towards anwar shah mor, you have to turn right just before navina cinema hall, towards lake gardens flyover. Just as you turn right you can see a glowing buildng, and the ground floor you can see that crossroad cafe.
The ambience is very nice. It attracts you to come again. Very nice glasses,suits with the outside very much. The staffs are quite well mannered and helpful in the  true sense. Food is good raste wise. But the chicken we have had today was a bit rubbery,because of the awesome taste that could be ignored. Irish cold coffee was good though. The cost is pocket friendly compared to cafe mezzuna south city , CCDs etc.  But The chaiwala near tollygunge tram depot, (at graham's land) beats it anyday food standard wise. Overall the experience is nice.

Was very disappointed with the food. The quantity was not nearly up to par with the price. We ordered a grilled fish with potato swirls, there was potato but no fish. The fish burger was averagely good but was TINY. The classico burrito was a sad excuse for mexican food, it had raajma paste that had a bad sour taste. And their apparently famous mud pie was just bad.

The ambience is cool and the service is good.ordered sweet corn balls,picante chicken burrito,grilled fish with vegetables,chipotle chicken pizza and passion fruit lemonade.passion fruit lemonade was nothing special it was like normal tropicana juice.now the sweet corn balls..they were heaven..highly recommended.according to me the grilled fish was a bit sour maybe bacause they added too much lime juice in it.but other dishes were pretty much perfect.t he burrito was quite filling and the crust of the pizza was very light and crunchy and that was making it all the more tasty.plus they serve 8 pieces which is an applaudable quantity for rs 160 i guess.
P.s.no extra tax..so its a pocket friendly place with decent food.

This place was in my bucket list since a long time. Finally, visited this cafe on May 7, 2016 with my guy. Located near the Navina Cinema's Lake Gardens bridge. A simple yet quircky look. Yellow chairs and the tables make the place look more bright. The staff is courteous. The food is good specially the burritos and pizzas. 
Very reasonable price and enough to fill two hungry tummies.

The crossroad caf√© is located near anwar shah road. If you're going from the tollygaunge side , then it'll be on your left had, just at that point where the lake gardens flyover takes the left turn and if you're coming from the lake gardens side then on your right hand. 

Okay now coming to the ambience- it was 8/10. Nice small seating arrangements. The walls are well decorated. 
They have an amazing staff. 
Coming to the food, it was really nice. We had ordered classic plain nachos, a veg pizza and a virgin mojito. The mojito was on spot, 9/10 for that. Plus I have the small jar kinda thing in which they serve. The nachos were covered in ample amount of cheese. Those were delish. The pizza was okay for two. It was medium sized, thin crusted. Tasted pretty amazing. 7/10 for that. 
It was a good first experience. Will surely revisit sometime soon. :)

Over the past few years most of the sprouting cafes across the city has only disappointed me. Some has got awesome ambiance but lags behind in quality of the food, some has got amazing food but is so cramped up that you cannot take your friends and family there, while there are many which serves nice food, has got nice ambiance but the beverages served are not that great. Also not to forget, ‚Äòprice‚Äô is also an important factor in cafes since at couple of places you will find everything else is fitting your requirements except the budget. It‚Äôs really not that easy to setup a picture perfect caf√© having all the boxes ticked. So I really thought reasonably priced amazing cafes are a myth, and I had given up all the hopes :( But finally when I visited Crossroad Caf√© my perception changed a lot. The place was overall a piece of heaven for fun loving food lovers like me, who concentrate mainly on quality of the food and beverages and just demands a relaxed ambiance. So let us delve deep into this food talk to realize a bit more about the food and beverages that are being served here. We tried 22 food and beverage items here which is enough to conclude that this place has got loads of potential and can rarely disappoint you in terms of flavor or aroma of the food and drinks.

I have never been to this place but have ordered food from here more than two times.... So i ordered mediterrain chicken burger most of the time and grilled fish.... Everything they serve compliments eachother... The taste of the mediterrain burger is little different than the regular burgers we have so if you want to try something new it could be a good option....

Once you enter the decor impresses you. It has the walls painted with names of food and their images. Now coming to the food, we order for a BBQ roasted chicken pizza, a virgin mojito and a chocolate shake. The pizza is a thin crust one with generous amount of toppings and both the virgin mojito and the chocolate shake goes down well with the pizza. Would recommend this place to everyone.

This is another hidden paradise to food lovers. The place is easy to find. The d√©cor is simple and attractive and the place feels homely. It's a good place to go to on a date. It's not suitable for big groups as you'll be crammed for space.

We ordered Barbecue Roasted Chicken and Grilled Fish with Stir Fried Veg. The dishes were attractive and the way they serve it steals the show itself even before we get to the food.
The Barbecue Chicken is served with risotto and baked potatoes in Barbecue sauce. The risotto was tasty and so were the potatoes. The chicken was soft and juicy and the portions were right for the price. The grilled fish is one of the best I've tasted. It's soft and melts in your mouth. It's served in an edible basket which was really attractive.

Lovely experience. The food is excellent. Their barbecue pesto chicken pizza, not listed in the menu, it's the most heavenly chicken pizza I've had in a long time. The bitten steak with risotto paled in comparison. Planning to visit soon again to try out a few more dishes. Location - Just at the junction of the Anwar Shah flyover. Try it out.

This is a relatively new restaurant which has come up on the Prince Anwar Shah road near the lake gardens flyover.In terms of ambiance and food quality this place packs a punch. Pricing is also reasonable and overall it offers a decent experience. Space is a bit inadequate and it can house a maximum of about 12-14 people at a time.But since the place serves only as a hangout option and is not a conventional restaurant for having lunch or dinner it can be overlooked.Overall a nice place to have a snack or two with your close ones!

A quiet little place situated right at the  'crossroad ' between Lake Gardens and Anwar shah connector.  Hence very aptly named. This cafe has very light and simple decor but it's not too spacious. 
The highlight is the Food. Anything and everything that you order, will be made heartily and will definitely delight you.  
We opted for The **Barbecue Chicken Pizza with Pesto Sauce,**  which had 8 portions. The pesto sauce went so well with the grilled meat. It's become my new pizza love right after Eagle Boy's. 
Next on was the ***Chicken Bitten Steak with risotto ***. Damn tasty!  The Chicken portions were cooked to perfection,  seasoned well. The risotto disappointed me. Should have asked for Mashed potatoes or normal buttered rice. Still a great dish overall.  
We also took *Hazelnut cold coffee*, which was served in these cute bottled jars. Good coffee and flavor. 
And also the pocket friendly price is worth mentioning.! 
This cafe has ticked all the right boxes on my list. Keep it up!

It's a cozy little cafe located on Prince Amar Shah road with a pretty and brightly lit interior. We hardly expected something as heavenly as the food we had when we entered. The menu doesn't have too much to offer, specially for desserts. But whatever food that is available over there is enough to bowl you over completely. We ordered a plate of chicken skewers served with harissa sauce and it was beautiful. The chicken was soft and warm and fresh and the sauce absolutely lip-smacking. Then comes the best part. We ordered a plate of Mexican fries. Little did we expect something so surreal. It felt orgasmic on our taste buds and i'd recommend that particular dish to anybody who visits Crossroad. We also had a plate of Spaghetti and chilli chicken sandwich, which was yet another delicacy. And then came the chocolate mud cakes. The only disappointment was the size of the mud cakes. They were pretty tiny. But in terms of taste, yet another joyful experience. And we also had a chocolate Monte Carlo with crystallized caramel on top. That too was beautiful.
Visit this place and you will not regret it. It is also VERY pocket friendly. So if you are low on budget and you need good quality food, I'd recommend you to go visit this place once. Cheers :D

There was a time when the chitchats & addas used to take place at the para'r roak/ some restaurant 'cabins' munching on some 'aat anaar dalmut' while sipping from a 'maatir bharer chaa'. That's quite a thing of the past now. In fact so distant that many from the younger generations don't have a clue so as to what 'roak/cabins' mean.

To say the truth even my understanding of those is largely from Bengali story books, most of which again have disappeared behind the colourful covers of harry potter! Anyway this is not about my rants regarding the changing scenario of the kids of our generation! Coming back to the tea sipping , badam bhaja munching thing, that has been quite abolished when Kolkata got introduced to the swanky coffeeshops to the likes of cafe coffee day, Batista & other multi national fast food outlets like McD & KFC. I have nothing against their food or patrons but , people may find them good. But personally I don't like the monotony of things. Each outlet of those giants seem like another brick the wall. The same d√©cor, the same food, the same drinks prepared in a mechanical way. That totally ruins the excitement of trying new things. Add to that the push sales strategy of all these chains. No! I don't want extra whipped cream. No! I don't want extra cheese. If you want me to have it the way it tastes better make it the way it's supposed to be & don't make me pay the extra premium! So these are the things that have made me shun the chains & look out for new outlets, small cafes which are opening up now and then. Sometimes the experience is good, sometimes disappointing , but in the end it always has been an added bonus to have tried out new items with new flavours as the chef's have wanted. These discoveries have taken me to various corners of the city & find out cafe owners who are not just hell bent on making profit from what they do, but also serve to people what they love. One such cafe is 'Crossroads Cafe' which I visited few days back as part of PanchPhoron when the co-owner Mr. Vishal Kajaria invited us over for a bloggers meet & food tasting session.

Locating the cafe is super easy. It's situated at literally the 'crossroad' of Prince Anwar Shah Road & the road towards southern avenue (Baroj Road acc. To Google). Its located on the ground floor. Though there is no dedicated parking space, you can park your car on the opposite side of the road.
It was a summer morning, however intermittent rains had made the weather somewhat bearable. As we entered the cafe we were greeted by Mr. Subroto Chakroborty, the Chef who had prepared a sumptious meal for us. We had a brief chat about the cafe, the food, but the food was too tempting to wait, & we digger in. We tried the following items:
Mango Passion Twist:
Fresh & ripe mango pulp blended with passion fruit juice with a hint of mint, this one was a bit thicker in consistency compared to regular mango shake, with a slight grainy texture, this was a delight to the tastebuds.
Passion Fruit Lemonade:
A fizzy lemonade is always a great drink for these scorching summer days. The added bonus was the addition of passion fruit syrup. Served in a mason jar with lots of ice cubes this one was instant hit among us, & must be among others too!
Cafe Latte:
This was the first drink I ordered. Was quite good, in fact amount of milk was fair compared to some places who just make it watery with lots of froth on top.
Virgin & Blueberry Mojito:
Both of them equally good, the blueberry version scoring a little extra for the extra tangy kick . Again these are served in mason jars, quite chic to look at, while being incredibly good at quenching the thirst.
Irish Cold Coffee:
Obviously this is served in the virgin form, but the extra bitter Irish Coffee, sans the pretentious whipped cream on top was a delight to have. The mix was thick, proportions of coffee & milk great, delicious to the last drop.
Caramel Cold Coffee:
A variation to the regular cold coffee with added caramel syrup blended in. To say the truth I found this not much different from the Irish one, just a hint of the caramel. Given a choice I'd rather stick to the regular cold coffee.
Kulfi Shake:
The last drink to arrive on the table was this. Though it resembled a glass of passion with some mixed ingredients from the outside, that was quite a deception which was instantly blown away as soon as we took the first sip. Pista kulfi blended with condensed milk, creamy milk & sugar blended to a fine creamy consistency, this was the one I loved most. 
After the shakes & drinks, it was time to taste the foods. Again the list was quite long.
Sweet Corn Balls:
The first item to arrive at our tables was this amazing dish. Perfectly fried crispy Tempura American Corn made into balls with crispy batter, presented with a dollop of chili cheese mix on the top. The crispness of the outer corns, softness of the inner & the not so hot chilis made this one a hot favourite, I swear I would have finished the whole plate if not stopped by fellow group members.
Harissa Chicken Skewers:
Grilled Chicken Skewers, to make it simple was the next dish to arrive. Though the fiery red colour of the chicken looked strongly artificial, to our surprise the Chef confirmed them to be all natural. The outer layer was quite stiff, while the inner layer juicy & flavourful.
Thai Spice Crispy Fish:
Fresh & soft pieces of fish hiding inside a crisp coat of batter, tossed in basil sauce & thai spices this one was another amazing dish. However the usual lemongrass flavour was missing, not that I'm complaining.
Barbeque Chicken Roasted Pizza:
All those people fed up with dominos & pizza hut, I ask you to try this just once. Not that this is the best Italian joint in town. But definitely this smoked chicken chunks in house barbeque sauce pizza is worth a try. The sauce being prepared in-house, has its own unique flavour which was great.
Classic Burrito:
Cooked beans blended to perfect mix & then wrapped in a lightly grilled crisp tortilla bread, served along with fries,pickle, dip & salad. The pickles are made in-house & are insanely tasty. The burritos itself were tasty too, considering I am more of a non-veg person, any vegetarian will find it much better.
Grilled Cottage Cheese Bruschetta:
Chunks of cottage cheese lightly grilled so as to not charr them, yet leaving the distinct grill marks, laid out on crisply grilled bread & a generous serving of sweet sauce sandwiched in between, this came as quite a shocking discovery. 'Don't judge a book by it's cover' was the cottage cheese shouting at me. Worth a try.
Green Peas Burger:
Green peas & beans cooked, mashed & then made into a crisp patty, topped with mustard mayo, fried onions, cheese, salad inside the buns. The non-veg version also includes a poached egg which just adds more to the look & taste. Enjoyed to the last bite.
Pizza Earthy Veggies:
The veggie pizza with mushroom, tomato & garlic is far less impressive than its non-veg counterpart. Yet the bread was crisp & quite likeable. Dishes like this make me wonder what the vegetarian people are missing out in life. üòÄ
Chicken Beaten Steak:
This one came along with risotto & topped with fine potato straw. The chicken was beaten to a flat, so much so it looked like an omlette to me. The sauce that the steak was cooked in was tasty & in stark difference to the cheesy & creamy risotto. The topping in the form of potato straws was a perfect match to the risotto. 
Barbeque Roasted Chicken:
Soft chickens along with potato chunks sauted in barbeque sauce & served along with pilaf rice. Their Barbeque sauce is in one word¬† Finger-Licking-Good. It greatly complemented the rice as the sauce of choice.The last dish & this one actually came as a surprise to me. These were not something that one would usually find in a cafe. These are quite a meal by themselves & perfect for a brunch.
Grilled Fish with Stir-Fried Vegetables:
Although this one was served around halfway of the meal, I saved this one to write at the end. Cause this one has to be the best looking & best tasting dish I had at Crossroads. The pastry basket the fish came in actually looked like a large flower with the soft juicy grilled fish sitting at the centre. The lime & caper sauce was perfect to go with the grilled fillets, with herbs & paprika sprinkled on top while buttered garlic breads sat at the sides. I could write some more lines on the items, but rather I would like to ask you to visit the cafe,if not for the other items, then at least for this one. Only then can you realise with how much care this dish is prepared by the Chef.
Dessert:
Chocolate Monte Carlo:
By now everyone was pretty full. Inspite of that one can always make some room for dessert, specially one that's as good as this. Made with Chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream, sugar syrup & topped with chocolate sauce & crushed cashews drizzled on it. Surely it had to be great tasting , with so many lovely ingredients to boast of. & Tasty it was. A perfectly sweet & satisfying note to end the meal with.
As you may have realised by now,that this one was hell of a meal. Most if not all the items hit the right spot in the taste bud. The cafe is not confined to serving coffee & light snacks only. Rather a wide variety of dishes from varied parts of the world awaits you. It was a fine discovery on my part. & Surely I'll be going back for more. In fact I could not actually taste their signature fish burger as I was in a hurry. The other members who tried it could not stop praising it. It was in fact good that I missed it. That way I'll surely go back for it.Untill then
Happy Eating,
Cheers!
                                          ...

There was a time when the city of Joy was all about munching on Gorom Gorom Alor Chop and Telebhajas. There was a time when an evening in Kolkata was probably about sitting on the luscious fields of Gorer Maath or having a sip on the clay pot of a popular tea vendor around. There was a time when adda for us was limited to sitting in one of those quintessential legendary cafes in Northern or Southern Kolkata. But not any more! The time has changed and so has the landscape. Kolkata is getting its due share of modernization and the food industry is growing faster than it ever has in the past.

The 5 star hotels and restaurants are getting economical, atleast in their food section and the privilege to munch on quality food is being accessible by the common masses, Thanks to the ever growing small cafe‚Äôs and restaurants here and there. One such place which is a part of this revolution is Crossroad Cafe, and is certainly one of my favorite. I have tried a number of such cafe‚Äôs in Kolkata and very few are actually liked by me. If some excel in beverages, they lack in offering quality food. if some dishes out delicious cuisines, their service quotient is as good as a thin lining in the sky. But, not this place!

The food and service, both makes up Crossroad Cafe to what is really is today. A perfect destination to hang out on any given time in the day and enjoy a meal of flavors and comfort. Located near Navina Cinemas, this place can be found just at the junction of dropping into Prince Anwar Shah Road, if you are coming from Southern Avenue. Likewise, if you are coming from South City Mall and approaching Anwar Shah Crossing near Tollygunge, just turn right towards Lake Gardens/Mannar Khabar, and this place would fall to your right.

Situated on the ground floor, the place is really small. It can hardly accommodate a max of 25 people at the most. But, as they say, a small family is sometimes a happy family. The bright radiance of the sun entering the room through the frosted glass door, the quirky and colorful painted walls, the wonderful combination of colors of the tables and chairs, the artistically hung up bottles consisting of home made pickles, the ever-smiling staffs attending to you; this place will not cease to amaze you no matter how many visits you plan on making here.

The co-owner, Mr. Vishal Kajaria, a humble and down-to-earth man himself was kind enough in inviting Panchphoron to this humble venture of his for a food tasting event and we gladly accepted. Following are the delicacies which he had offered to his. Carefully crafted and prepared by him and by his skillful companion Chef Subroto Chakroborty, it was a sumptuous feast lying ahead of us.

Drinks:

1) Mango Passion Twist: Slightly different from a regular Mango Shake, this was perhaps infused with finely sliced Mint leaves and perhaps some Passion Fruit Juice. With a grainy texture and somewhere shifting to the flavor exhibited between a ripe mango and a ‚ÄòKancha Aam‚Äô, this was a pure delight to have. Could be easily ranked on top of an innovation list, if you prefer to try new things, this is one drink you must have.

2) Sparkling Espresso: Honestly, I did not like the idea here. The coffee was overly sweet and the entire thing was more likely on the nomenclature of an iced tea rather being a coffee in itself. The drink looked appealing with a sliced watermelon on the edge, but the overall taste did not impress me much. I would easily prefer something on the likes of ‚ÄòCold Coffee‚Äô over this.

3) Passion Fruit Lemonade: Who does not like to gulp up an enticing lemonade in this hot summer and you get a free bonus if you get to taste the seducing passion fruit as an addendum! Sugary syrup, lemon juice and passion fruit pulp; together they make a holy alliance. Served in those pretty jars which are easy to handle, this one is probably the most ordered beverage here.

4) Virgin Mojito: Perhaps the most common of all the Mojitos. This was rightly flavored up with the correct amount of zing. The mint leaves were fresh and the lemon and ice together made it a much refreshing drink from us having come a long distance against the scorching heat of the sun.

5) Blueberry Mojito: A regular Mojito transferred into something colorful and enriching by adding up Blueberry Juice. Tasted the same as the previous one, but a tad bit sweeter and slightly different due to the Blueberry A combination of mint, lemon and sweet blueberries, try this instead of the regular Virgin Mojito if you are looking for something new.

6) Caramel Cold Coffee: Regular cold coffee with a drizzle of Caramel syrup inside. Tasted a bit sweet but not sweet enough to dominate the very essence of Coffee. Infact both Caramel and coffee complimented each other very well.

7) Irish Cold Coffee: For the uninitiated, there has been numerous modifications to this one and everyone has their own way of making this classic. The one served here was nothing fancy, yet it tasted so rich, smooth and sublime. The whiskey was put in the right quantity and the combination of the ice cream with the coffee gave it a nice smooth and sublime texture.

8) Caf√© Latte: Combination of Espresso and Steamed Milk, Caf√© Latte is one of the most popular beverages among its own kind. Served hot, this had a strong coffee flavor as it usually should. The sugar wasn‚Äôt excessive and among all other cold beverages which were served, this one really managed to make a mark for itself. Must be one quality hand which prepared had this.

9) Kulfi Shake: A unique twist to a rather ordinary shake, this one was perhaps used by mixing up frozen Kulfi with cold milk and sugar. The Kulfi was probably plain pista and had an enchanting presence of condensed milk. The consistency was good and this wasn‚Äôt watery as one would find the shakes to be elsewhere. The froth above gave this a nice visual appeal and we took no time in finishing this up before moving to the main course.

Food:

10) Harissa Chicken Skewers: Supposedly originated from Africa, this one is made up of a paste comprising of red chillies, garlic and vinegar. The paste is then applied on huge chunks of chicken which are then skewered onto a stick and then put on a grill. This was served with a dice of lemon and a bowl of salad which represented the likes of kimchi. Chef Subroto was honest enough to confess that the coloring of the paste was all natural and no artificial substances were used. The chicken had a firm texture from the outside, yet we had no problem in consuming them due to their soft core in its inside. The drizzle of lime managed to infuse a tangy flavor upon the already flavorful paste.

11) Thai Spice Crispy Fish: Eyes do not lie and so wouldn‚Äôt the picture for this. The Fish was fresh and the batter was crisp. Tossed in basil sauce and served with salad on the side, with every bite I cursed myself for not wanting to have a sweeter version of this. Being a ‚ÄòBheto Bong‚Äô, I absolutely adored this dish. Sprinkled with wonderful and fresh spices, this was a delight to have. Perhaps addition of few more herbs will infuse more ‚ÄòThai‚Äô feeling than it already does.

12) Sweet Corn Balls: Tempura Fried American Corn fried perfectly to crispiness and garnished with bell peppers, a dollop of cheese and finely cut red chillies. The chillies weren‚Äôt fiery enough here. What contributed to this dish was the sweet corn, the crisp batter and the heavenly cheese. One could really bite in balls after balls of this one to satisfy their tastebuds.

13) Grilled Cottage Cheese Bruschetta: Honestly admitting, I am not a big fan of cottage cheese. For someone who despises the very mention of this item, this dish was a surprise in disguise. The cottage cheese was grilled to perfection and the base was also grilled to crispiness. The salsa wasn‚Äôt tangy but rather on the sweeter side. Sprinkled with a drizzle of herbs here and there and some bell peppers on the side for presentation, this was perhaps our most enjoyable dish all throughout.

14) Classico Burrito: Refried beans grounded to perfection and then being wrapped in a tortilla. The tortilla was lightly grilled with a lovely crisp texture throughout its surface. Served with pickled jalapenos, cheese and French fries on the sides, this was a bliss for my vegetarian only friends who could not enjoy the non-vegetarian delicacies.

15) Green Peas Burger: Green peas and refried beans stuffed together to make a crisp patty, which are then topped with mustard mayo, brown onions, crisp onion rings, chopped salad, cheddar cheese and crisp fries. Honestly, it was hard to distinguish if this was a vegetarian one or a non-vegetarian counterpart of the same. The stuffing was just perfect, full of flavors, and had a nice balance of sweetness and saltiness. The cheese was just a blessing on top of the crisp patty and the onions rings made sure that no stone was unturned to give the customer ultimate experience.

16) Fish Burger: Regarded as the specialty item here, and rightly so, this was liked by one and all. Served with bell pepper, homemade mustard sauce, pickled cheddar cheese, corn relish, home fries and crisp onions rings; this was the second time I was having this. Both the times I was equally amazed of how a small item like this burger could pack such a punch. The combination of the sunny side up along with the patty and the cheese lifted the level up a notch justifying the high standards set by this caf√©.¬†

17) Falafel Wrap: Again a treat for my vegetarian friends, this was served with pickled eggplant and tomato and parsley salad, this one is a Middle Eastern classic and is made up of ground chickepeas or beans or both. The filling was crisp and sweet inside and well with the tomato and parsley salad served in the sides.

18) Pizza Earthy Veggies: Topped with spinach, mushroom and garlic, I did not really enjoy this much because by the time I had this one, I have already had the taste of their special Barbeque sauce twice. The plain tomato sauce provided for this one thus seemed quite bland for me and the spices for this one did not appear right for my palette.

19) Barbeque Chicken Roasted Pizza: Smoked chicken in their homemade Barbeque Sauce and accompanied with onions, according to me, this is the real deal here. The sauce is not too tangy, not too sweet either, yet it is so lucrative and enticing. The sauce has its own flavor and certainly is one of the best I ever had in Kolkata. The sauce is not artificially sourced and is completely homemade. If you are looking for something surprising to make your day up, have this one. You will not be disappointed.

20) Chicken Bitten Steak: Served with sweet potato straw and risotto, this one is a bit hard to describe. May be because this dish requires artistic perfection and careful hands to combine all the flavors to complement one another. The chicken was beaten to perfection to give it a flat texture. The risotto was cheesy and went well with the steak. I could not get the sauce which was used to toss the steak, but it appeared some sort of an orange glaze. The thinly sliced potato straw added to the crispiness and made sure that the cheesiness of the risotto wasn‚Äôt dominating the flavor coming out from the chicken.

21) Barbeque Roasted Chicken: Same intoxicating Barbeque sauce was used to toss the chicken after which it was served with green pea saffron potato pilaf. The sauce was beckoning as usual but the chicken did not lose easily out to the sauce. The chicken was soft throughout and wasn‚Äôt like the usual dry ones you get elsewhere. The pilaf went well with the sauce and this could be regarded as a wholesome dish altogether. The quantity was quite good to serve two people along with a drink on the side.

22) Grilled Fish with Stir-Fried Vegetables: A work of an artist, a creation by a perfectionist, a dish by an expert. Certainly not a work of an amateur, the fish here was soft, succulent and fresh. Grilled to perfection and tossed with caper lime sauce, this was carefully put in a crisp pastry basket and garnished with fresh herbs and paprika! I have heard stories of how a man could fall for a woman. Visit this place and have this dish and you would know how someone could fall in love with a dish. Sprinkle some lime on the top and bite in some garlic bread and this dish would certainly win your hearts and mind.

Deserts:

23) Chocolate Montecarlo: By this time, we were all stuffed and decided we could not go along any further. Sadly we had to give up, but a meal is not complete until you have some deserts to end it up with. Made with chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream, sugary syrup, this one was topped with chocolate sauce and probably some caramel as well with cashewnuts being used for presentation. The desert brought in a comforting end to our sumptuous meal justifying the standards set up by the quality beverages, starters and main courses.

To end, there is hardly anything else I could speak about this place. The co-owner, Mr. Vishal Kajaria is one of the most generous and kind person one would ever see. He carefully coordinated our entire marathon and made sure all of us present in his caf√© got equal share of the food and wasn‚Äôt left out. The food and the drinks came appearing one after the other and had no intentions of stopping at any point of time.

The chef is a highly qualified man in himself and has earlier worked as the head chef of Chai Break. He listened to all our suggestions and inputs we had to give him in the most humble way one ever could. We were amazed at his expertise and how he had helped in setting up the menu at Chai Break before he ventured onto elsewhere on his professional journey. If not 100, 99% of his dishes here were liked by us and equally praised by all.

If you are still not convinced that this place should be your next destination to come over, go through the other reviews. If not all, most of them have been showering praises as to how good this caf√© is and more importantly how great their food is. Considering the throw-away prices they charge for it, this place is definitely a steal and a hidden gem among the hundreds of newly sprung up cafes all around this city. Try and enter with an empty tummy and I promise you that you will go out with a happy heart.:-)

LOCATION:

Just continue on straight from the Lake Gardens flyover towards Prince Anwar Shah Road and you will spot it on the left just before the crossing where the connector meets the main road.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Kolkata is undergoing a cafe revolution of sorts with numerous small cafes opening up in every location serving reasonable yet tasty gourmet food. Crossroad cafe is one such outlet. It can seat about 20-25 people. Interiors are simple but vibrant. It seems to be a well organized cafe.

WINE & DINE:

I called for delivery last week. My order consisted of Harrisa Chicken Skewers and a Mediterranean Sandwich.

To begin with, I though the delivery boy was very well behaved. He spoke properly and greeted me with a smile which I instantly liked. It created a positive feel about the food I was about to eat.

The Harrisa Chicken Skewers were really good. The chicken was well cooked and the sauce along with it was spicy, yet flavorful and had a very good salt balance which I seldom find in most dishes. I could taste the pungent chilli flavor at the background and yet it was not pronounced. I liked the dish.

The Mediterranean Chicken Sandwich was a bit of a disappointment. It had a wierd odor to it and also lacked a base sauce which should have been there. This made the sandwich a little dry for my liking. I also felt that the chicken in the sandwich was a little underdone. If the dish itself has be presented without a sauce or with a subtle sauce, then the chicken itself I feel needs to be either grilled or smoked to add a bit of flavor. I did not manage finishing this dish.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

I personally like places where dishes are either smashing or not good as it shows potential. Food with all dishes being "ok" does not reflect the same in many ways. This place has potential but I feel they need to work on their recipes more.

VERDICT:

For the price I was charged, I felt the portions were generous and the food came well packed and hot. Flavors maybe a matter of perception or personal bias. So try it out !. I would probably try out some other items as the Harrisa Chicken Skewers did impress me a lot.

I was eyeing this cafe while returning from work since quite a few days. Last Saturday I planned to meet up a friend and we decided to go somewhere nearby. She came up with the idea of Crossroad Cafe and thus we went there. The place has a feel good factor and one would actually fall in love with its simplicity. We ordered - 1. Thai spice crispy fish tossed with hot basil sauce served with side salad  and 2. Pizza chipotle chicken with bell pepper, roasted corn and fresh cilantro. They were really tasty and the fish had a very different flavour. The pizza was yummy and it was an absolute value for money. We had to try very hard to eat the whole pizza but it was worth it. In fact 3 people can actually order one pizza. We did not realize that. It was filling with loads of toppings. The staff was very courteous. I wanted to try out a mocktail as well as a dessert but was too full for that. Would definitely come back to try out their other delicacies.

The cafe is on everybody's list now , so had to try this place too. I tried the Pan fried gnocchi..the first veg item on the main course section of the menu.
It wasn't that great to taste but the presentation of the dish gets full marks!
My friends who tried the non veg dishes off the main course section liked theirs!
It's a cute little place and play very likeable soft songs! 

My second visit here has been way above satisfaction:)
The panini roll and the Oreo shake were delightful!

Had visited this place on Saturday evening with a friend. The place is small but tastefully decorated. Service was courteous. 
We ordered Chipotle pizza and Thai crispy fish. Both were succulent. We were too full to order any desert or drink. Meal came around 360. Pizza was thin crust but quantity was enough for 2. Thai crispy fish is the best I have tasted. The place is worth visiting for the excellent food.

Sweet corn balls were amazing. Pan fried gnocchi was good. Asparagus risotto was again, amazing. I loved the dining experience. Staff is good, service is fast and the food is pocket friendly too. Highly recommended.

Reading lots of positive reviews we went to this cafe ,ordered two dishes and were enjoying the ambience and the well decorated interiors. Little did we realize then that everything that glittered would not keep our glittering smiles intact for long!

The black eyed bean nachos seemed nothing better than bengali "nimkis" ( I am not at all trying to demean our favourite traditional food but think how you would feel paying for a Mexican dish when it turns out to be nothing more than what you are so familiar with!) .

Then came Classico Burrito that had so many things stuffed inside a wrap but was surprisingly tasteless! Either every element in your food recipe should retain its taste/smell or when assorted you should get a flavour that's way better and different from the original ingredients. A whole lot of tasteless (supposedly Mexican!) stuffing inside an Indian parantha ...this is all I can say about the dish. 

Extremely disappointed. Scratching out names of continental food items in your catalogue doesn't always win. What you serve on the plate finally is what counts.

This is a small cafe serving delicious food. 
Had been there yesterday with a friend of mine, munching on their sandwiches and watching KKR win, was a sheer delight! :) 

Coming to the food, we had ordered:
Mexican Fries - all the spice lovers would love this dish. It is French fries tossed in some Mexican sauce. 
Barbeque chicken pizza- it was really nice. Thin crust pizza with lots of chicken and cheese. 
Smoked chilly chicken sandwich.. This was my favourite. One of the best sandwiches I had in a long time. 
Green apple lemonade and blueberry mojito both were good. However, the mojito could be better with a little less mint in it. Otherwise, perfect üòá 
The prices were reasonable. The above items cost us around 650. 
The staffs are really well behaved and courteous.

Generally I don't write reviews but this place needs a special mention. Easily one of the best Mexican place in Kolkata. We ordered Pizza Chipotle, Chicken Bitten steak with risotto, Barbeque roasted chicken and Choco mudpie. Each of them was delightful. The risotto was perfection! The thin crust pizza was also one of a kind. From next time I'll prefer Crossroad than Dominos or Pizza hut as you'd get more delicious pizzas in half the prices. 

To top it all, prices are very reasonable. Can't wait to go back again and try out all the dishes.

In a lazy Sunday afternoon , this might well be the highpoint of your day.

If you are in Prince Anwar Shah Road, you might want to try this place out. Why, you ask?
Two words: outstanding food. Best caf√© in this vicinity and I can give you my word on that.

Food Quality: 4/5
Food Quantity: 3.5/5
Service: 4/5
Staff: 5/5

Location: a bit of a pickle to locate at first. Crossroad is on Prince Anwar Shah Road. If you're coming from South City, continue towards Jogesh Chandra Chaudhuri College and take the immediate right turn. It is a bit difficult to pin it, so you might want to consult Google Maps.

Food: coming down to business, the food here is outstanding. They have a specials section written on a board outside their caf√©. 

Pan Fried Gnocchi with Roasted Bell Pepper Sauce, Mascarpone, Spinach Sage and Parmesan Cheese: a plate full of hot gnocchi over creamy bell pepper sauce presented with thinly grated, semi molten parmesan cheese. The gnocchis were saut√©d to the right degree. They were both light and smooth. Coming to the sauce, it had a strong, overwhelming taste to it. It was rich, and undoubtedly brought the whole dish together. This dish can be easily misinterpreted for its unfamiliar taste. Try only if you are curious.   (3/5)

Grilled Fish with Stir Fried Vegetables in a Crisp Pastry Basket with Caper Lime Sauce, Fresh Herbs and Paprika: The star of this caf√©. Hot pieces of cleanly cut, boneless chunks of fish. The meat is butchered to perfection, cooked thoroughly,and is light and fluffy. This is served with fried mixed vegetables like your usual corn, carrot and cauliflower. But what made the protein accentuate was its sauce. Rich, velvety, smooth white sauce with a lil bit of tanginess from the lime. This is served in a chrisp pastry basket. The creamy sauce and the pastry makes a heavenly combination. (5/5)

Management: Crossroad is a caf√© you would not want to miss out on. It can accommodate a room of thirty people approximately. It may look small but the place is strategically engineered and built. The room has a flat screen TV in the middle so that everybody can more or less have a view. The caf√© is kept clean. Food comes out fast. The staff there is friendly and very well versed with the menu, a rarity nowadays. And to put an icing on the cake, the place is inclusive of tax and is light on the pocket. 

Synopsis: 
> Food is better than your regular caf√©s
> quantity is satisfactory for one person
> pocket friendly

Located roadside near lake gardens, this cafe is easy to find. You get tempted to enter the cafe once you spot the casually decorated paintings on the wall and the message it carries..."take life one cup at a time". My friend and I went there on a lazy sunday evening .. We wanted smething tasty yet light food for our stomach.. Something vch is not too heavy and oily..so we ordered fish burger.. Thai crispy fish and bbq roasted chicken pizza. Fish burger was yumm totally, with fish patty and egg poach stuffed inside.. Loved the combination of mayo,fish,egg poach, olives and veggies.. The pizza was a bit saucy and spicy... Yet light for stomach.. The best dish was the thai crispy spicy fish. Really loved it.. I guess its the most wanted and most preferred dish in the cafe.. We wre too full eating all these that we couldnot go on for desserts this time.. Would love to visit this place once again to try out some more dishes

I wish Zomato had rating that went beyond 5 because THAT is how good the food was over here! Taste wise, service, food quality was amazing. To say it felt like I was eating at some star chef's restaurant would be an understatement. Pocket pinch wasn't much surprisingly! The average beverage and dish costs around 150 INR. We had 14 dishes and the entire bill came up to approx 1900 inclusive tax. Each drink, each dish was presented beautifully and also had a unique taste. The seasoning of everything is perfect and the pasta is cooked just right. This fish was your die for. I never knew what melt-in-the-mouth-fish meant till I ate here. The last time I had fish that good was in The Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The cheese garlic bread is filled with enough cheese to make a mini fondue and I'm not even exaggerating. Location wise they are quite easy to spot along Anwar Shah making this place an absolute gem. I most definitely recommend people to come and give this place a try. I know i will be coming back to this place soon.

It's very easy to locate and like an oasis in the barren land, lacking some good caf√®s.
Don't expect lady gaga or Justin bieber playing. Certainly one of the best cafe, in terms of the music playlist. Great wall graphiti to accompany it.
About food, it's got a great promising menu in reasonable price. Being a pizza lover myself, I have tried two kinds. One being the chipotle chicken and the other one is 4 topping. Disclaimer : they are thin crust pizza, and not over doughy pizza that Indian palate is used to. And it's over loaded with the cheese. Nothing beats the stringy cheese. I have also tried the corn fritters with a spicy aioli ,
The chocolate mouse and the chocolate mud pie. The sauce which comes with the corn balls is darn good, and we asked a second helping of it. Just for the sauce. Tje mud pie is gooey and moist, just how you would want it and the mouse is also great with its creamy texture. Though it tastes more like a pastry.
Overall experience thumbs up! This shall be my go to place,for pizza obviously!

I ordered in some food today (18th May), and I'm terribly disappointed with what was served.

The spaghetti aglio olio was salty and full of unrequired cheese. The pasta was sticky and chewy. Horrible.

The Mexican fries seemed to be large salt fried potatos with nothing to them except salt.

The thai harissa fish was a salt mine, with little sweetness and excessive salt. Really,  honestly, guys - tone down the salt. 

The grilled Mexican burger was barely passable. Just barely. Still with more salt than normal.

It was Rs. 710 worth of absolute rubbish. 

Speaking as a customer, improve your standards of food delivery or suffer dwindling customer numbers. Because this meal was one of the worst I've ever had.

Located around the corner of Mannar khabar on Prince Anwar Shah road. The cafe has a cozy ambience. Visited dis cafe for the first time today and enjoyed it. Good music and friendly staffs. It wasn't that crowded when we entered, probably because it was nearly 8:45. We didn't order any beverages, went for grilled fish with veggies. It was delicious. The fish was properly cooked, tender and juicy, perfectly seasoned and came with a side of garlic breads and lots of veggies and a tasty and creamy lemon sauce. The whole thing was extremely satisfactory. The only thing which created a slight glitch was the coriander leaves in the sauce but it was great nonetheless. I personally felt that some other herb would have been better for my pallet. The staffs were helpful, guided us well with the chice of dish. We didn't order anything else as it was quite late by then but intend to do so on our next visit. Overall a nice experience.

I had Crossroad cafe on my list for a long time and finally paid a visit a couple of weeks ago. For people who have not visited this place yet, Crossroad cafe is situated right where the lake gardens fly over meets Prince Anwarshah Road, or more specifically, Mannar Khabar.

Service:
First things first, very pleased with the service. The person who was waiting our table, served us immaculately well, guiding us through the menu and also customizing the orders to our demands on the way.

Food:
We ordered for Sweet corn balls, falafel sandwich, Penne with Parmesan Mushroom and fresh herbs and the mudpie.¬† We also ordered, white peach iced tea, green apple lemonade and chocolate shake to wash it all down.

We were very happy with the beverages, according to me, they were the absolute highlights of the meal. The corn fritters were nice, especially the dip that accompanied it. The Sandwich/wrap was nice too, with flattened falafel patties stuffing the interiors of the wrap. The pasta did surpass both the other dishes. The mudpie was warm and gooey and increased our craving for some vanilla ice cream to go with it, which was sadly not available.

I also ordered a Thai spice Crispy fish and a pasta, same as above, with chicken, to go. Being a carnivore did make me crave some fish or chicken, hence had to go for it.

The favorite from all the dishes mentioned above was undoubtedly the Thai Spice Crispy Fish. The fish is soft and flaky on the inside and crisp around the edges. Absolutely the perfect combination of flavor and textures. You must opt for this one.

Final Comment:
While I was extremely pleased with the fish, the rest of the dishes could not live up to the standards, set by it. But the question is will I be visiting this place again? The answer is a yes. They have a promising menu card and some of the dishes look extremely luring. Maybe they will have a more promising effect on the rating next time.

Suggestion:
A small quenelle of vanilla ice cream with that Mud Pie will surely take it to the next level.

Located very suitably on Prince Anwar Shah Road on the main road. Very small place. But I must say I was delighted.
They have a very small and basic menu. We ordered the black bean burrito and four toppings pizza. The burrito was really good. And we ordered a combination of zucinni, corn, mushroom and onion. This thin crust pizza was absolutely amazing. We also ordered a pasta which was quite basic. 
For drinks we ordered the Irish coffee and the chocolate shake. The chocolate shake was really good.
Overall I would say just go and order their pizza and chocolate shake. 
It is very reasonable and the don't have any kind of taxes that's the best part.

Amazing place to have a snacker with coffee.
Classic Nachos are a must have here. I had it with the Caramel Coffee which was equally good. Mexican fries with sour cream is a good alternative if you need a change up.

It has been a wonderful experience spending an evening with continental foods. I loved the cruncy cheezy bbq pizza followed by the cold Irish cold coffee...The rosted bbq chicken platter was brilliant. The chicken was well cooked with the rice...the finally the pene pasta with white sauce and chicken was out of the box. I enjoyed the food funda with my friends.. But I think they should work more on the sweet dish.. The mocktails were even refreshing. Overall I loved the food and ambience..

It's a small cafe near Lake Garden Bridge, easy to locate. The interior is quite nice. Now coming to the food we ordered, Roast Lemon Chicken Salad, BBQ Chicken Pizza, Lemon Iced Tea and a Classic Cold Coffee.

The salad was amazing, it was fresh. I loved the sundried tomatoes and pickled red cabbage. The presentation was pretty nice.

The pizza was yumm!! It was a thin crust pizza with sufficient amout of cheese and chicken.

The iced tea and cold coffee were nice.
The prices are also very reasonable. The staff is well-behaved. I would like to come here again and try some other dishes.

Their burger is excellent. Accompanying fries as well. I liked their garlic bread with mozzarella. The choco mud pie is a little too sweet. But good nonetheless. The one thing in my order that I didn't like too much was the Mexican fries. It just tasted weird. But I recognise that it's probably just me. Other people might like the different spices etc rubbed on the French fries but I didn't. On the whole, a really good place with good food

Crossroad Cafe was a delight. Small joint, nice ambience. The menu is very appealing. We were a group of 5 and went for lunch. Ordered A LOT. Fish burger, harissa chicken with cilantro rice and grilled fish with veggies in pastry basket with caper lime sauce were mind numbingly good. Among others, classic chicken burrito, chipotle chicken pizza, roast chicken sandwich with bbq sauce, virgin mohito, passion fruit mohito and the chocolate shake are great. The mud pie cake was tiny for the price they charged, but tasted good nonetheless. Relatively quite reasonable on the price chart. First eatery which has really compelled me to write a review :p
I have a feeling I'm going to be a regular here. Keep up the good work :)

I have visited this place a number of times as it's near to my home. Regret to say the quality of food and service has deteriorated over time. It's sad! It was one of my favourite cafe.  My old review is below. The service is slow. I ordered a cold coffee....Which was watery. Changed it but in vain. A hookah order took more than half an hour to arrive. The staff looks untrained. A complete turn off. I have experienced this kind of service in my last few visits. Surprisingly all the things I liked about the place has changed for worse. Thankfully food is still good.

My old review.

This a bright new place. This cafe has a bright ambience, awesome music. Western music from 60s and 70s, its quite nice. From the cafe tables you can see through the glass walls the cars running. Its quite a feeling. Coming to the food. Its a 5 star. I honestly did not expect such great stuff from a Cafe. They have a good selection of Pizzas, Sandwiches, Pastas. Lot of continental food. I tried their Roasted Chicken sandwich and smoked Chilly chicken sandwich.It was very tasty. The breads used were of high quality, soft and fresh. The chicken was juicy. The accompaniments were also tasty. I also had a cold coffee. It was made to perfection. Their service is fast. I ¬†am happy to get a place like this in Prince Anwar Shah Road. This is away from the crowded part of the road, yet easily accessible. Keep up the good work. I will keep coming back.

This cafe was in my wishlist for a long time and today finally could hit this place. :) I went there with my sister in the afternoon time. It's easy to locate, just at the backside of where Manna's khabar used to be. If you get down at the Lake Gardens stop it will just take 2 mins by walking. Coming to the ambiance of the cafe, it has pretty wall paintings, cosy, good music and very nicely decorated. Service was excellent! We ordered their passion fruit lemonade from the beverages and then BBQ chicken roasted pizza and chocolate mudpie. Passion fruit lemonade was refreshing and in this summer you may try this out apart from green apple lemonade which is quite common everywhere. The pizza was super awesome. Chocolate mudpie was amazing too. Overall had a very good experience. Keep it up!
Looking forward to visit ¬†again:)

Location:Behind Manna'r khabar, where a new shopping complex is coming up beside the lake gardens flyover.
It is a small cafe & can accommodate around 20 people.The decor is too simple, so are the furnitures & cutlery.The choice of music is commendable & the volume as well is soothing.One of the good things is that since it's a small joint it wont be too loud.
Food:We ordered the chiptole pizza,Virgin mojito & lemon iced tea.I've had better chiptole pizza both taste & size wise but considering the price of this one it was quite wholesome & good.Overall the food menu was impressive with lots of variety & reasonable price.
Drinks are pretty pricey compared to the food.The mojito was good but lemon iced tea tasted bland.No taste of lemon or tea was there.
May revisit in future.

Decor and ambience wise this cafe is pretty great despite being a little small in space. Coming to the food, it was a mixed experience. For beverages we ordered lemon iced tea, caramel cold coffee and a classic cold coffee. All three were served in pretty mason jars and tasted great. The bbq chicken pizza and the harissa chicken skewers were simply delicious. But the classico chicken burrito was a big disappointment with more red beans than chicken. For desserts we had mudpie n chocolate tart...though really good in taste, the portions were too tiny. Good place to drop in if you are in the locality but yeah, not going back in a hurry.

Visited this Caf√© today evening with a friend after going through Zomato.. Newly opened, the place is cute and cozy with limited tables.. The ambience is pretty chilled wit some nice music in the background. My orders were:
1. Chipotle Chicken Pizza with corn, bell peppers and fresh cilantro.
2. Virgin Mohitos.
Super tasty pizza, came in 8 slices, and we finished it in no time. Virgin Mohito was too sweet when I first sipped into it, but after telling about the same, the guy who took our order added some fresh lemon zest. It was quite refreshing. I wish we had little more time to chill there, as I quite liked the place. Will be back soon.

The pizza was delicious and is certainly one of the best in the town!! However, I found the sandwiches a bit dry and felt that its size should have been a little larger considering the price. The mudpie was tasty and unique!! Loved it!! Overall its a nice place to visit!!

I'm absolutely in love with this place. The food is so very delicious,presentation is beautiful and the interiors are colourful. The place is a little small,but that's okay.

Of the many items I have tried,the fish burger tops the list of favourites. Its juicy,crunchy and amazingly tasty. Comes with a side of fries and some corn-achaar mix.¬†
The chicken in homemade bbq sauce,the chicken skewers both are good.
The pizza was great too but with so many pizza joints around,this one can be skipped. Nevertheless it is tasty.

Prices are very reasonable,quantity is good enough.
¬†Would suggest them to add more items in the dessert section.

This place is all you need a cafe to be. Good food, good ambiance, friendly service and good music. 
The things i loved : the presentation of the food, the quality and service. The chicken skewers and the mushroom jalape√±o cheese omelette (which was served with four pieces of the best bread toast i have had in years). 
The drinks : they were presented nicely and we had quite a number of options. I had the blueberry yogurt smoothie and passion fruit lemonade. 
Things they can improve on : better decor. They had beautiful chairs and table, but the walls can have more than paintings. The plates need to be bigger cause the spoons and forks are bigger in size. That was odd. But a very minor flaw. 
Verdics : Need a place with good food and ambiance without worrying about the expenses. visit crossroad cafe. 
A definite thumbs up! :)

The food in this place is good alright. Fair quantity too.
The caf√© itself is a little small with minimal decor. The waiters are friendly and we had found a rather chatty one, he was fun. 

We tried : 
Harissa Chicken Skewers - Awesome. It came in piping hot in a bed of steaming, delicious, spicy harissa sauce. The chicken was tender, nicely cooked and melted in mouth. One serving is enough for two as starters. 

Grilled fish in pastry basket - This was chunks of grilled fish in white sauce with grilled veggies in a delicate, crispy filo pastry basket. This too, tasted gorgeous. The white sauce was creamy, delicious with little olives and grilled veggies to add acidity and freshness. The fish itself was perfectly cooked. Best thing we tasted here. 

BBQ Chicken Pizza - Thin crust. Had a topping of grilled onions and chicken doused in sticky, sweet bbq sauce. It tasted pretty good. Although, not the best pizza crust. And a fair amount of more cheese would surely had made it better. 

Chocolate Smoothie - Like a chocolate smoothie is supposed to be. Thick, creamy, chocolaty. No worse, no better. 

Since the bill got over Rs. 700/- they served us a complimentary dessert (could be swapped for a drink) as a special offer. 
We chose a brownie dessert. It was sticky, sweet, covered in chocolate sauce, not extraordinarily great but had a crunchy crust that I loved and these little caramel brittles, which was fun to chew. :)


One last thing, we had packed the pizza for take away and I have issues with their poor packing techniques. They put the slices into a silver foil box one above another which made the crust go soggy and gross. Sad.

Another thing, they have a washroom that's actually outside the cafe at the back and dark (and scary). Please get a better washroom? 

At any rate, it's a nice little place. You might wanna try them.

I had the opportunity to visit this place on my birthday and what a delight it turned out to be. With a casual yet cozy ambience, this place provides delicious Italian dishes, the highlight of which are the pizzas. Having a wide variety of both hot and cold beverages, this place is a worth a visit. - Srijita Ghosh

Summers are getting hotter gradually and this little cafe in Mannar Khabar (Lake Gardens area) is capable of calming the heated up brains and bodies that enter into it instantly. The warm greeting by the staff, the colorful decor and the awesome music that is played here cheers you up. I have visited this cafe many a times and have tried the Fish Burger, Roast Lemon Chicken Salad, Grilled Fish and Harissa Chicken. I definitely recommend all of these. The latest addition to their desserts is Chocolate Monte Carlo which is just out of this world. I loved it!

As far as the food goes, the sum of the parts is much less than the whole ~ that is, things don't add up to anything enjoyable.  We ordered the grilled fish and the chicken steak and at first, both from appearance and taste, it was difficult to tell which was which.  The accompanying salad, fries, pickles were all forgettable.  For a a market in which the buyer is now spoilt for choice, this newbie needs to get its act together very soon.

This is a newly opened cafe near lake garden bridge and it has already come to prominence, a big thanks to zomato !! This is a nicely decorated place having bright wall paints and quite comfortable seating arrangements. The food we ordered are listed below :
#Virgin mojito - Comes in a transparent jar. Looked happening, tasted refreshing. But I missed the punch a bit.
#Cappuccino - I was having a light headache and it was a saviour.¬†
#Classico chicken burrito - Quite filling served with yogurt. Tasted good but the flavour of the beans overpowered it.
#Roast chicken sandwich - Two good sized sandwiches which not only filled my stomach but did total justice to my heart.
#BBQ roast chicken pizza - This was the star of the evening. Thin crisp crust, delicious toppings, good amount of cheese, eight slices - what else can you dream for in such a low price. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!
A great experience. Will surely visit again. :))

We were looking for a place to have a quick ,light lunch near about Deshapriya Park and chanced on a review of the Crossroad Cafe. Situated just at the corner before turning into Prince Anwar Shah Road coming from Southern Avenue,it is a clean,small and cosy kind of typical cafe which would be popular with young people,not very busy but I am sure it will be quite different in the evenings, more so as there are just about half a dozen tables. The menu was typical cafe food sandwiches,burgers, pizza and desserts etc. and we ordered a salad with chicken for me and a Chicken Harissa with rice for my colleague. Service was quick. Both were very well turned out and satisfying without being heavy.We then had a strawberry yogurt smoothie instead of dessert which I found a bit sweeter than necessary as in addition to the strawberry syrup, they seemed to have added sugar.¬† Total cost Rs.700 which felt just a bit pricey for cafe food. The person in charge asked for our feedback which was satisfactory on all counts. Would go again

After years of witnessing promising new restaurants come into the foray in a blaze of glory and fizzle out by failing to live up to the hype, I have grown an uncanny sense of forecasting the fate of food joints. And by what I saw yesterday, this place is here to stay... and satisfy!

First thing first, I've loved what they have done to a small space. Kudos to the people who came up with the decor plan. Bright and chic interiors with moderately comfortable seats were enough to keep me interested. Yes, it did light up my mood!

And let's get to the real deal: the FOOD! We ordered a Roast Lemon Chicken Salad, a Fish Burger, a Grilled Fish with stir-fried vegetables, a Chocolate Mudpie, a Blueberry Mojito, and a Passionfruit Mojito.Roast Lemon Chicken Salad: Perhaps the best of the lot! This was my first time tasting apricot, and I loved it. The veggies were extremely fresh. However, the slow-stealer was the grilled chicken chunks. Simply superb!

Fish Burger: Small in size, but packed with loads of good stuff... especially my favorite onion rings. And even though the size is not sufficient, the house fries make up for the missing piece.

Grilled fish with stir-fried vegetables: Sorry, the quantity is not enough to term it as a main course. The fish tastes amazing, no doubt; however, veggies are too much in amount. And it's definitely not as filling as it looks like.

Chocolate Mudpie: Small in size, but that's okay considering the price. Tasted delicious... and I was very impressed with the texture as well.

The Mojitos: Refreshing, and the presentation makes them perfect.

Six items in all, the bill amount was less than 900/- bucks. So what's there to complain? Absolutely nothing! Would love to visit here someday soon... especially when there is a light drizzle on, and I can sit by the misty window to watch rain-drenched cars pass by.

We had ordered harissa chicken skewers, roasted lemon salad,BbQ pizza, chicken chipotle pizza and bitten chicken steak served with risotto. The starter was good and the thin crust pizzas were cheesy and delicious, the salad was fresh and refreshing but the steak dish was out of this world. Risotto was really creamy. Was too hungry to click more pics. They also served dessert which was complementary. Will definitely visit again... with

It happened to be a Sunday night and mood for deviation of food. My saviour Zomato pulled this up in Newly Opened. Reviews indicated good energy, zoomed to the place with family .A small bright lit cafe playing hard rock. Thought it's a teenage hunt, never mind it's food that matters.The server was warm and suggested their exclusives.Started with a Classic Nachos. The salsa, guacamole and the sour cream tasted awesome. A good start. The main course was a melange of barbeque chicken pizza, chicken chipotle pizza, a Mediterranean Chicken Burger and a Chicken steak strips with risotto.Coming to the pizzas. ..they were brilliantly crisp thin crusted.The barbeque sauce and crunchy chicken complemented well.The Chipotle chicken was grilled perfectly and added a spark to the pizza. The Burger had a generous patty cooked Lebanese style , some good mayo served with loads of French fries and salad. The other main course was like a fusion of Mexican and Italian. The risotto was cheesy, mushy and adorable. The chicken tasted like fajitas . Tongue tickling, smokey, delicious. Served with nicely blanched veggies. I asked the server I needed a strong coffee. He happily said "Mam , I'll prepare something u exactly want". Nice gesture and added rating for that. He served me a huge mug of Strong hot Latte, aromatic and crisp.Super. Others tried lced tea and Kulfi milk shake.Served in jug tumblers the ice tea was very refreshing and the shake was very innovative tasted like liquid Kulfi. Soothes the mercury soared weather. Prices are pocket friendly. .no added tax.Pros : Good food, budget friendly, jovial cooperative servers. Cons: Nothing in particular, the ambience is just a little juvenilish for me üòâüòâüòâüòâ.Do try dear foodies not a place to overlook.

Well...what can I say...seeing zomato reviews for this new cafe got me really excited...! But it was a disaster...! Ordered for home delivery today....I rated 1.5 only bcoz they didn't add tax and packing charges on the bill amount.
Coming to the food..
1. Calazone spiced chicken wings with barbeque sauce...3 wings drenced in sweet tomato sauce for 170...I will even prefer KFC wings over this. Does the chef know what calazone spice is? And the barbeque sauce was like sweet tomato chutney we make at home...I can't rate this food. Sorry
2. Barbeque roasted chicken with green peas pilaf....all fancy name huh??? When I opened the parcel I was shocked to see the amount for Rs240...2 small chicken pieces with 2 potato halves plus some yellow rice. The rice was oily and flavoured with too much of cinnamon. The chicken pieces was just coated with some sauce. Just a store bought barbeque sauce is not all. And everything was sweet...!
3. Chocolate mudpie....it was tasty but for Rs80 the slice was just about 1cm thick.
I don't know how people have rated this place so highly....for me a fancy place to seat with AC and all the jazz doesn't suffice for a good food joint....The taste is most important.
These days cafes are opening every other day...the put up menu with exotic names with nothing new to offer for our taste buds. I'm highly disappointed..!

It's a cute small cafe. Very neat and tidy. Food is proper and service is attentive. Decor is lively and bright. Give a good feeling when you enter. Menu has interesting collection of sandwiches and pastas. Also some choices of omelette. 
Just a suggestion our omelette was slightly oily and cooked a bit over so it lost the softness. Rest it was good. Surely will.visit again.

Nice cozy place but lil too small. Classico burrito was good but had a sweet flavour that can be worked on. Nice Iced teas. Dessert options are very limited & all chocolate based. More options definitely needed. Service was good.

Everything about Crossroad Caf√© is wonderfully bright and cheery: the yellow and white decor, the frosted glass front that lets in the soft midday glow, the smiling, eager-to-please servers, the white crockery and ofcourse the food! (Did I mention the two-in-one olive oil and soy bottles? Well, they have my heart!) Though the menu is an assortment of dishes that cannot be grouped under a single cuisine, they haven't just been hashed randomly either. So with Picante Mexican burritos, we had Chicken spiced with North African harissa and neither disappointed us. 

The burrito, plump with a layers of Mexican rice, chunks of chipotle chicken, cheese, lettuce and spicy beans, was served with a salsa and a bright green guacamole. The salsa, though not perfect, was better than what we've had at most places. The Harissa Chicken Skewers didn't perform high on my heat rating. We thought the meat was cooked just right but there was this slightly bitter aftertaste. The tiny bowl served with the skewers has kasundi tossed vegetables and if, like the guy at the next table, you discard it you're missing out on some tongue-tickling flavours! 

I found the Blueberry mojito a tad too sweet but when you're served a see-through amethyst drink in a mason jar on a bright spring morning, can you really resist it? You can't!

But the star of the afternoon was the Roast Lemon Chicken salad. The ingredients were incredibly fresh; the salty smokiness of roast chicken slices played alongside the sweetness of dried amber apricots, carrot sticks, sundried tomatoes and the sharp tang of lemon doused cucumber crescents. Add to it bits of crunchy green and red leaf lettuce and pickled purple cabbage threads and you have an explosion of flavours, textures and colours in your mouth!

Crossroad's USP is serving restaurant food at cafe rates, and we are more than pleased. The service is quick and the servers attentive. Besides, we are glad to find a place near South City that serves great food but not at cut-throat prices.¬†Prices on the menu are inclusive of all taxes.¬†Crossroad is located on Dr. Deodhar Radharaman Road, right opposite Indrani Park. From South City, you'll¬†have to walk towards the Tipu Sultan Mosque. It'll be on your left.

The Reluctant Eater's Notes: Every dish we tried had fresh, clean, light and well-balanced flavours. No overwhelming or tastebud clogging condiments, flavouring, aroma or texture. If you find the Harissa Chicken skewers a little under-seasoned, a squeeze of lime can magically brighten it!

To be honest, I entered this place quiet 'upset' but when I left, I was quite 'refreshed and happy'. Well, I think, that entails all about how my experience was with the Crossroad Cafe.
Oh damn! I was so upset that evening that I had called up my senior Tanwyee Ray and urged her to meet me up. As you know, food always uplifts a bad mood, so as usual, my senior told me that she had a new cafe in her list and we should try it out and needless to mention, I trust her completely on this.
Situated at Prince Anwar Shah Rd., the cafe is located on the ground floor of a multi storeyed building. Well lit and a lot presentable in appearance from the outside - which I felt was quite impressive. As we entered the cafe, on our left, was the reception desk, decorated, well lit with decorative and fancy lights. The cafe is a not-so-big one, but a small and cozy place, perfect to spend a nice chat session or a meet-up with a friend or two. Yes, its true, theres a space crunch and the cafe may barely accomodate a maximum of 16-20 people at a time, but however its one of its kind and good enough.
Coming to the decor, i feel that the cafe had a theme of its own. The tables and chairs were well arranged. White tables, yellow chairs - the table-for-two ones were circular in shape with two bright yellow-coloured chairs with it. The bigger tables were square in shape with four chairs - alternately coloured - two white and two yellow. Each table had a steel tissue-stand, a glass bottle containing olive oil which had stop cocks and this is what had captured my eyes. Adding up to the white and yellow colour combination, were the beautifully painted walls which were in a perfect sink with the theme of the cafe. The walls had graphic paintings depicting colourful vegetables carrying dishes on one wall, while another wall had various names of dishes written on it with colourful alphabets. The entire cafe was well lit with decorative lights, the false ceiling also had lights. Also, the temperature of the cafe was well maintained and the air-conditioning was perfect.
It was hot and humid outside. So we preferred to go for drinks at first to get some refreshment and cool ourselves down. The staff had given us a warm welcome and the menu was brought to us without any delay. We ordered for one Elderflower Iced Tea and one Passion Fruit Mojito. Bothe the drinks were served in glass jars with lids which had white and yellow squares - which I personally liked a lot because presentation matters a lot to me.
The Elderflower Iced tea was a refreshing drink, decent in taste, thirst quenching one, well balnaced in sweetness. On the other hand, the Passion Fruit Mojito was a drink on the little more sweeter side, with a fruity flavour, refreshing as well.
Next, surfing through the menu card, the dish which sought our attention was Harissa Chicken Skewers. We ordered for it. The dish looked good and tempting. There were 5 long rhombus-shaped boneless pieces of chicken served in sticks. It was a marinated dish, the chicken marinated with Harissa sauce made of red chillis, garlic and vinegar, with an excess of olive oil. Supposed to be from the North African origin, the dish tasted great! The chicken was little stiff and according to the dish, its supposed to be like that. Garnished with mint leaves, the dish also came up with a tangy salad of chopped carrot, cabbage leaves with lemon juice.
The owner of the cafe happened to be present there and while we were talking to him, he suggested us to try their Fish Burger which was one of their signature dishes. We decided to go by what he suggested and so ordered one. The burger came soon. It was large enough in size, with two burger breads, soft enough, and the stuffings were in layers, a layer of basa fish, a layer of onion rings and bellpeppers, well stuffed with homemade mustard sauce and cheddar cheese, and a layer of egg poach which happened to be a sunny side up however it got cracked. I loved this dish to the fullest. It came with a corn pickle and a salad of chopped cucumber, carrot, tomato, and chopped methi leaves.
The cafe provides free WiFi to its customers, however that day they didnt have connectivity so we could not use it.
Next it was dessert time. This time too, we went by the suggestion of the owner and ordered for a Chocolate Mudpie. It was an yummy, chocolaty dish with a nutty layer on top, and a layer of molten chocolate which just tasted awesome.
The bill was pocket friendly and well in sink with the food quality that they serve. To add, I must mention that the Mudpie was made complementary for us by the owner, and I must say that it was a really sweet gesture and thank you so much for that.
I am definitely coming back to this cafe to try more of their signature dishes.

visited the cafe last evening with 2 of my friends...ambience is very good..service is gud we had the cappacino/ blueberry mojito/ green apple ice tea...drinks were refreshing. we ordered the chicken chipotle pizza which was very tasty- nice thin crust generous amounts of cheese and checken. we then had the grilled fish with veggies in the filo basket which was the best of all the 3 dishes we had. we also ordered the chicken bitten steak with sweet potato straw and risotto.. the chicken was very tasty but the risotto was under cooked which they immediately changed. i realised later that i seem to have missed the sweet potato straw in that dish. overall resonable prices and very tasty food hence the high rating

Went there with my girlfriend...We were greeted very warmly by the staff there...the decor is really bright and colorful and we loved it...we had ordered a chocolate shake, a black eyed bean burrito and a grilled fish wish stir fried vegetables...the shake was served in a really cute jar which my girlfriend loved!!..the service was prompt and the guy serving us kept on giving us heads ups on how much longer it would take, which was really nice...

i had the grilled fish and i found it to be excellent..both filling and delicious..they even gave us some extra sauce with the dish(which i fully utilized :P)...my girlfriend had the burrito and she said it was pretty decent too

the ambience, the decor and the service are best things about this place...my only suggestion would be to not play EDM in the background!! it just doesn't suit the ambience of the place...some 80s rock maybe??

all in all, an afternoon well spent at the crossroads cafe!!..keep up the good work guys...

Went there on Woman's Day..Very easy to locate.. Near lake garden's crossing.
Small yet colorful...the bright yellow color gives a positive vibe.. What really striked me was the staff..they were really quick and friendly and greeted us with smiles..which was quite pleasant..
We ordered BBQ chicken pizza and blueberry mojito. And guess what as it was woman's day and our bill was above 400 bucks we got one green apple lemonade for free!! :)
Ok the pizza was good..thin crust..topping was good..the blueberry mojito was simply mind blowing..Cool and refreshing !! Overall I liked this place..will definitely go back to try their burrito and the steak dish !!! Thumps up to this cafe :)

A new bird in the city....small but pretty nice ....location is also very convenient ...bright yellowy decor....coming to food...the classic burritos are very filling and nicely stuffed especially the herbs and rice in it...the chipotle pizza is good enough giving a break to the usual pizzas but to mention the penne mushroom pasta could have been better...its more milkier than cheesy...actually they mentioned cheddar cheese but i didn't find any cheddar in it....but overall its a nice place and the best thing is they have included taxes in the item price!!

A nice place tucked away near Navina Cinemas. We ordered Classic chicken burrito and a four topping pizza. The burrito was excellent. The pizza was good, but a little sweet for my taste. Overall, its good value for money and I might hop in again.

The oh-so-friendly smile right after you enter this place, what else can you expect? The simple interior, some good music and tasty food. Crossroad cafe is one of the few places you are going to visit again and again. Affordable, comfortable and the service are the top three things you are going to get.

I went out with my sister for a refreshing evening walk and went to grab some coffee. Ordered one cold coffee with caramel and blueberry yoghurt smoothie. Not to forget those cute mason jars that they serve in. This time, we didn't order anything to eat but there's always a next time.

I loved every bit of Crossroad and keep it up with the good service üòä

A very simple, cosy, feel good cafe with a decent decor , bright lights & a subtle charm. The hazlenut cold coffee came as quite a surprise so did the chicken sandwich & the sesame thai fried fish or something like that. The only suggestion is for the harissa chicken satay fingers, they were too spicy & the gravy made it a little messy, rest everything was perfect. Keep up the spirit. Shall be back soon. :)

A small cafe in Lake Gardens, this is a relatively new place. It is just opposite to Smart Kolkata, near the Lake Gardens Flyover. It's easy to locate this place. The cafe is small, however it is decorated in a very 'fun' way. Ordered a Chicken Bar Q pizza and a Chipolte Pizza. The pizzas were thin crust with a lot of toppings and cheese *_*
I absolutely loved the Chipolte Pizza. Price is very cheap and taxes are inclusive as well. Looking forward to visit again and trying out their other items!

Went there with a friend yesterday to this cozy little cafe which is located on the lake gardens crossing area. Well me and my friend were very hungry so directly opted for main course. I ordered a chicken bitten steak and my friend ordered barbecued grilled chicken. What to say about their food, its absolutely delicious and the best part is their authentic presention, just loved it. Then came our lemon iced tea which was served in a really cute way, not in usual high ball glass. The ambience of the cafe was also very pleasing. Pocket pinch was absolutely on the lower side.

Such a quaint little place! The colours are bright and happy and both A and I would agree, this place is very instagrammable :3
Coming to the food, I loved the salad I ordered! It was fresh and light, just what I wanted. I had ordered the roasted lemon, chicken with coriander, lettuce, rocket leaves, pickled red onions and cabbage, apricot and sundried tomato. It was vibrant and amazing to taste. A loved her peach iced tea.¬†

P.S. We were served a complimentary slice of chocolate cake (it was Valentine's Day) which was an amazing gesture! (More so, for we were two women together- such a nice touch!). The cake was, to our surprise, not very sweet, which is very much to our taste! :')

Coming back for more.

After the Second visit:Loved the grilled fish in filo pastry with stir fried vegetables in caper lime sauce, the blueberry yoghurt smoothie, the barbecue roasted chicken with green pea saffron potato pilaf, chocolate shake. I reordered the roasted chicken salad that I had previously ordered. Did not regret it. :)Cheers! xD

We  ordered a white sauce pasta, Mexican fries and veg falafel wrap. The pasta was good but the wrap was a pleasant surprise ( recommended by the chef himself) !!  It is simply superb and a must try when you visit this place..oh and to end it, we received a complimentary serving of their chocolate mudpie which was sinfully awesome ! Will definitely go again !

What a beautiful little place this is! The interior is vibrant and cosy. The presentation of the food is at par with the high end caf√©s of the city. The price is astoundingly low. The staff is extremely courteous and well behaved. I absolutely am fond of their thin crust pizzas and their mexican french fries and I love how they serve their drinks in cute little mason jars! The caf√© gets another cookie for its location. Just 5 minutes away from where I live. I just hope they increase the variety of food in their menu. I will be definitely visiting this place a lot of times. And I highly recommend it to people who want to casually hang out with their friends.

Well, first of all, when I saw it from outside, i thought it might be some just another new cafe at town. But yesterday afternoon thought of paying a visit, and mark my words when i say, it was really really worth it. First of all, it proved my "just another new cafe" conception wrong. It is more than just a cafe. It has a wide range of menu which includes English breakfast to continental. It got continental main course too. Food is simply mind blowing. The quality of the food is its USP. It seriously speaks a lot about the cafe. All the breads, spices, sauces, meats, salads, all speak for themselves. You have to try the grilled chicken sandwich. This restro, actually defines the "grilled chicken sandwich". You have to try it by yourself to know why. It also serves great coffee, wide range of mouth watering desserts, pizzas, pastas and lots more. The grilled chicken s/w was my first dish I tried here, and it immediately raised the bar of my satisfaction. Overall, great food, with very well behaved and trained staffs and nice and sober decor.. So finally I got a new continental favorite cafe with reasonable pricing.
Location, on lake gardens crossing, ground floor of the Kick 2 Gym.
