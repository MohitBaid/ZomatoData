Ok i really dont wanna rate this place  because didnt get the  opportunity to taste the delicacies as depicted in zomato i.e "japanese".
First of all this place was really hard for me to find and secondly after reaching their i got to know they are closed with their japanese menu and serving normal food i.e indian and chinese i guess. Was really disappointed.. üòî‚òπ
Requested this guys to update their profile and menu on zomato. 
Hope to try their normal cuisine sometime in future..‚ò∫

Took us a little while to locate this place. Ordered Chicken Dumplings, Crab sushi and khauswey. Sadly the bakchoy wrapped Dumplings were unavailable. The chicken Dumplings were delicious. Chicken filling was great. I hated the sushi. Tasted awful to me. It was my first time though. So didn't know what to expect. The Khauswey was amazing . Pocket pinch is reasonable.

Ok, so the thing is their old south asian menu is gone, and their indian menu has practically nothing to eat..The staff is courteous. But then I wasted my time completely going there.üò•

Went there on buffet lunch with a friend a year ago. The starters were not so good. The main course and desserts were good enough. The price was reasonable. The staff was really very good. So was the ambience of the place.

This is possibly my favourite sushi place (along with Fuji!) in the entire city! They're excellent value for money, and taste amazing. I had my first sushi here, and the staff were extremely helpful in helping us choosing what to try, and preparing us for what would come on the plate! Now, countless visits later, I'm even okay with sashimi! (To the great indignation of my father, because I don't have cooked fish at home.)
Their sushi is excellent. It's a great place to start sushi because the rice here is slightly sweeter than the other sushi places in the city. The nori is slightly moist, but I'm nitpicking here. If you're not sure what to try, take the platter. Their Korean meal bowl is extremy filling, and tastes amazing.
And if you're looking for something more traditional, try the dumplings, they will absolutely blow your mind!

Where will you find a place where they serve Indonesian,  South Korean, Chinese & Japanese food under the same roof?  That also it's prices aren't very high and the quantity is greatüòä. It's worth the price.  The servers are best‚úåüëç‚ù§

Went there yesterday with my date after a lot of browsing on Zomato. The decor is good. The people here are very courteous too but to my disappointment, a person came up to us and said "Sorry sir, we don't¬†serve Sushi and any other food. We have a fixed menu that is Indian meals."¬†So, will try again later and update the post. (maybe)

Came for a late lunch to this restaurant in Dec 2016, unless you are really an observer, its difficult to find the hotel which hosts this restaurant for its inmates as the hoarding isnt very eye catching. Dining area has a cool ambience with pictures, books on a rack, their menu is short and sweet and we did a few clarifications on combination of our dishes to order. Also they usually do dinner buffets where more variety of dishes can be tried. Starters were tempura prawns and bok choi dumplings which did not take a lot of time. Prawns were very tasty served with tartare sauce. The dumplings had a surprise element namely the bok choi leaf used and the oil garnished by waiter just before eating it. Chicken dumplings were good and the oil gave a different taste. Next we ordered khow seuy which came like a platter with all its ingredients to be mixed as per one's palate and garnished. I loved the idea of making it to your own taste and savoured it totally. Next we ordered nasi goreng, fire cracker chicken and another sticky rice dish served with apple sauce. Well the apple sauce was a bit sweet and combination of it with the veggie rice was alright as my palate was not used to this taste. Nasi goreng was good but less spicy and fire cracker chicken was unlike its super spicy name but tasted good. In all, it was a lovely quiet place to visit to have a change in the daily restaurant food we eat as no dish was very salty, sweet or spicy and balanced on asian food preferences.

Its located in d groundfloor of dee empressa hotel on kyd street. I'd give them full marks for the ambience decor & service...the staff was very courteous & patiently explained abt all d dishes & clarified any queries we had ...they evn adjusted d flavurs a bit according to our choice & we found their recommendations to b vry appropriate. We had ordered panganng -a leaf wrapped steamed fish dish & pad thai- handmade noodles with nuts & veggies , & we found both dishes to b quite unique & worth repeating...the quantities were also satisfactory.... the only drawback was d crab maki sushi but most probably it wasn't any fault on their part just the fact that sushi didnt suit my taste...all in all a good experience... wud like to visit again

A wonderful place to visit if you're looking forward to exploring Japanese cuisine. Inside the narrow lanes of New Market Area lies The Co and might I add that they have a good range of food items and at very low cost. 
What attracted me to this place was their availability of sushi. We happened to order Crab Maki but boy, did it fail to impress. I don't know if it was the unfamiliar taste that made me to come to this conclusion or the fact that the food was actually made very bad, but I would suggest everyone to avoid this item if you are planning to visit here. 
The restaurant was kind enough to compensate that dish with a Bok Choy Wrapped Chicken Dumplings. This item was simply delicious. The sauce, the consistency, the flavor- everything was spot on. 
Next we ordered their Khow Suey. A simple dish, no doubt but one must give it a try. 
Service was excellent. The staff here are great. And the cherry on the top, at least for us was that we got a discount for showing for student identity card. So make sure to ask the people there if this offer is still available. Bon appetit!

This place should legit get more attention. The pricing is decent, the food authentic and discount for students. Located in the lane beside Sudder street, extreme end of the street if you're entering from the Park Street side. Their sushi was amazing and far cheaper than other joints, the Pad Thai was generous in quantity and authentic in taste. Must visit this if you wish to try Japanese, Burmese or Thai cuisine.

Well, liked this place a lot... Visited along with friends... It is located in kyd street... Not hard to find.. After getting out of park street metro, walk towards esplanade nd take the first right after crossing Dominos... Then it's about 5 mins of walking...

*Ambience: Really nice... Must say... Kind of expected it... As it's part of Dee Empressa hotels...

Now coming to the food... They provide limited choice in the menu... Nd the sushis are really low priced...
We kept it simple... Ordered bok Choi wrapped chicken dumplings, chicken fried rice, stir fried noodles, and firecracker chicken...

*Bok Choi wrapped chicken dumplings: The presentation was good... ND they add a sauce or something... I dnt know xctly... But whatever it was, it was pretty awesome... Overall... The taste was nice... üòä

*Rice and noodles: It was nice... Nothing much to say... The quantity they provide is good... üòä 

*Firecracker chicken: It tasted more or less like chilli chicken... Expected a bit different, going by the name üòâ

Overall the experience was nice... üòä nd price is very reasonable.. They also gave 20% discount on the billing on showing our students ID..üòä

Looking fwd to this place again... ND will be trying the sushis nxt time... üòã

My girlfriend received a Voucher of this place as a Surprise Gift from Zomato. So we decided to pay ¬†a visit :P

The place was beautiful and very classy.
As soon as you enter this place, you see the walls so beautifully done with small shelves for the books. The Seating arrangement is nice and the music that was being played were nice too. üòç¬†

Food we ordered- Had Fresh Lime Soda, Bok Choi Wrapped Dumplings, Chicken Teriyaki Rolls, Nasi Goreng Rice, Fire Cracker Chicken. Wished to have Lemon Cheesecake but that was not available. ‚ò∫

*Fresh Lime Soda had been ordered Sweet. What they served was Salted. While asking them to replace it, all they did was add Sugar to it. Totally bad and disappointing!

*Bok Choi Wrapped Dumplings - were okay. The sauce or oil that was added was so bad to taste that it spoilt the entire dish.
*Chicken teriyaki rolls- this was my first experience of a sushi and it was good.
*Nasi Goreng Rice - This seemed okayish to me but my partner was outright disappointed as she had had it earlier and knew the orginal taste of a Nasi Goreng.¬†
*Firecracker Chicken - This chicken looked just like Chilli Chicken and tasted just about fine. 

To sum it up, the food was a real disappointing factor and that more or less gives you an idea about whether you should visit this place or not.

Out of everything, I just like the ambiance of this place. Improve your cooking and dishes.

Had a hard time finding this restaurant located inside the dee empressa hotel.
Was in mood for costfriendly oriental food and hence after a few wrong turns and a few right finally reached this place.
Gorgeous interiors. Well lit and spotless!
The cost was not much though the portions were way too little. 
We had chicken Satay which was served with a very weird tasting sauce.
Next it was chicken fireball which tasted impressive.
The Thai red curry was good but the taste of lemongrass overpowered every other flavour.
The wasabee ice cream was again... Weird.
Overall it was an okayish experience.
Hop in if u have a thing for oriental food at affordable rates.

*Nasi Goreng Rice - THIS WAS TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. Nasi Goreng is supposed to spicier than Chinese Fried Rice. Whereas, this rice had cucumbers and it was so sweet to taste. I also enquired the staff if it was Nasi Goreng and they said Yes ! *sigh*
*Firecracker Chicken - This chicken looked just like Chilli Chicken and tasted real bad. It had heaps of capsicum and onion and no proper taste.
Overall, I am totally disappointed with the Food. üòì

We were greeted complimentary fruit juice.
The d√©cor and ambience of the place is good.
They serve pan Asian food. We didn't stick to any particular cuisine so we ordered a combination of dishes.

Chicken dumplings wrapped in bok choi: it was served steaming hot. The presentation was good. Iw as delicious.

Nasi goreng: it's like fried rice served with an egg poach on top. Taste was good and was well cooked.

Crab maki: I never had crab maki before. This was worth the try. The flavours fused in your mouth.

Salmon maki: I tried this for the first time too. They were tender and delicious.

Firecracker chicken: well cooked and tasted well.

We were greeted complimentary fruit juice.
The d√©cor and ambience of the place is good.
They serve pan Asian food. We didn't stick to any particular cuisine so we ordered a combination of dishes.

Chicken dumplings wrapped in bok choi: it was served steaming hot. The presentation was good. Iw as delicious.

Nasi goreng: it's like fried rice served with an egg poach on top. Taste was good and was well cooked.

Crab maki: I never had crab maki before. This was worth the try. The flavours fused in your mouth.

Salmon maki: I tried this for the first time too. They were tender and delicious.

Firecracker chicken: well cooked and tasted well.

Loved this place. As it is a restaurant of a hotel so the ambience was ought to be good and elegant. The decor is simple yet classy and has a little flavour of China and Japan. On every table one will find a scribble and pencil beside the menu which takes you back ro the childhood. Coming to the food the offer very limited but interesting hoice of food which I liked very much as it helps you to select your menu easily. We ordered Chicken Teriyaki Rolls for Sushi which tasted awesome and the flavour of wasabi was great. Then we ordered Bokchoy Wrapped chicken dumplings which tasted goof as well. Then we had Pad thai noodles and Firecracker chicken for main course. The noodles was delicious and the chicken was spicy and tasted great. Service was good and staffs are very friendly. Food quantity is very good and pocket pinch is very reasonable. One must try this place atleast I am looking forward to go there and try all other dishes they offer specially the Sushis. :)

This restaurant was in my wishlist since a very long time and finally I visited this place. I had very high hopes from this place but at the end I was a bit disappointed. The interiors are very nicely done and the ambience is very good. However the service was a bit slow and the staffs seemed to be confused. 
Now coming to the food we ordered Veg Dumplings, Chicken  Balls of Fire, Firecracker Chicken, Stir Fried Vegetables, Schezwan Noodles, Burnt Garlic Coriander Rice and Vegetarian Bento . Veg Dumplings we neither too good nor too bad, they were just average. Chicken Balls of fire were very good and its presentation was also very nice. Firecracker Chicken were just like chicken manchurian. Both the noodles and rice were perfect.
Now coming to the Vegetarian Bento, after eating it I felt like vomiting, it was so so horrible and while eating it we found a hair inside the dish. üòë after complaining it to the waiter he refused that it was a hair and started making lame excuses. I mean what the hell, if its a hair just say sorry and apologize for it.
Overall not a good experience!

Went for a Lunch with 5 friends
Planning was to try sushi, and some Indonesian dishes.
What we ordered:
Starters:
1.Bokchoy wrapped Chicken Dumpling: basically balls of chicken wrapped in bokchoy and steamed in traditional bamboo steamer taste preety good.

2.Salomon maki sushi : I didnt find it tasty, may be it didn't suits my Indian palate.

3.Chicken Satey : doest taste good, favoured with kafir lime the satey doesnt have a balanced taste..

Mains:
1: Padthai chicken Noodles : Taste good, Long striped noodles with chicken and egg, over all a balanced dish

3.Burnt coriander, garlic chicken rice

4. Nasi Goreng : a Indonesian fried rice served with a poached egg.

5. Firecrackers Fish: basa fish cooked in a hot gravy taste OK.
6.Honey chicken: this dish is little sweet...

Overall the quantity they serve is huge.
Taste wise the Restuarent is OK. One time visit.
The staff are quite informative and served well but they take way lot of time to serve.be ready to wait.

A nicely done restaurant inside the Hotel De Empressa. The seating and decor is just very soothing! We wanted to try out this place since they serve veg sushi too and being pure vegetarians we wanted to give a shot at this preparation!  So we ordered the Capsicum Nilgiri sushi which was very spicy because of the wasabi content in it! Did not like it much though! For mocktail we tried the Pinky Dinky which was good but lacked presentation. Then for main course we ordered Stir fried vegetable in soy sauce and schezwan fried rice. Both the dishes were good but not the best! There is quite a room for improvement for the veg dishes! The dishes could be made more flavourful .. :)

I and my friends were in mood of having Japanese cuisine. Zomato showed us this one. The place ia situated near the metro station. They serve authentic Japanese food and we tried a lot of new dishes. All the items were good and the staffs are friendly too. The ambience and the interior was also nice.

Come here if you want to try some wacky ice cream combination. Only thing my father kept asking, is for drinks so would like some cocktails and hard drink also introduced in the menu. Other than that from sushi to chicken, everything had a different flavour that people need to try. A new feel.

Very nice interiors.
Just verify the bill one before you pay. 

Addendum july 26 th,  2017: They do not make the sushis and the other Asian dishes anymore.. 
The restaurant lost all the charm it had for The excellent japanese food.. Sad!

Attending back to back sessions of Kolkata Literary Meet at Victoria Memorial and a long walk along New Market had left my sister and I completely famished. So we decided to have lunch and searched Zomato for a suitable place. This place is located at Kyd Street(also known as Md.Isaq Street). It's the lane after Park Street if you are coming from Maidan side. The restaurant was pretty classy with nice d√©cor and dim lighting. Coming across an asian restaurant in such a low price range is like a dream come true for foodies like me. It's truly a hidden gem. The restaurant was deserted when my sister and I walked in. We ordered Bok Choy wrapped Chicken Dumplings (BCWCD), Crab maki and Khao Suey. Unfortunately the BCWCD was unavailable. So we settled for Chicken Dumplings instead. The service was pretty fast. We were served the Crab Maki first. Since this was our first tryst with Japanese cuisine, we were pretty excited. Unfortunately we didn't like it at all. However this is not a reflection of their cooking. It's just that we were unaccustomed with the taste. Nevertheless we ate it with much difficulty since we didn't want it to go to waste. Next came the Chicken Dumplings. This was a clear winner for us. The Dumplings were very well-cooked. The Chicken stuffing was good in portion. They were moist and juicy. We really liked them. Then came our Khao Suey. Here the noodles and the soup was served separately and other ingredients came in small bowls. Since we didn't know any better, we just mixed all of them and it tasted amazing. The dash of lemon along with it just enhanced the flavour. This was actually the star of our lunch. The KhaoSuey was enough for two people and we were full after eating it. One thing I really liked about the staff was that they didn't serve us all the dishes at once giving us the opportunity to relish each of the dishes. The bill came upto 492 bucks after availing the 20% student discount. Basically they are not charging the tax. I really liked this restaurant. Being in such a dingy lane, I don't think they get much business which is a shame since they serve great food at such a cheap price. It's really a gem of a restaurant.

We had ordered Dragon Favs (mocktail), Chicken Teriyaki Rolls (sushi), Nasi Goreng (rice), Szechuan noodles, and Firecracker Chicken (a chicken gravy side-dish). The food was delicious, the interior superbly posh, and the prices extremely cheap given the type of food and service they offer.

Visited here during puja. They provide a pocket friendly buffet. The starters were good, especially the khow-suey and basa fish though the momos were sticky. Unlimited cold drinks for rs.100 along with the buffet. The food was good according the price. The chocolate ganache was really yummy.

Exceptional value for money take away. Great for kids. Flavourful mildly spiced food reminiscent of Malaysia and Thailand with out the excessive spiciness. Dumplings are to die for as are the prawn tempura with the outstanding wasabi mayo. Nasi Goreng , Pad Thai Noodles and Thai green curry with steamed rice were nicely done too.

This review may not match your taste so just don't go by this review. First look at the place gives a very positive vibe about the place. Pretty decor, comfy seatings, very courteous staffs. The price is very reasonable. We got salmon maki sushi, khao suey and bak choy chicken dumplings. Sorry to say, didn't like any of those.Maybe my taste buds doesn't respond well with Asian cuisine. Sushi was a nightmare for me. But if you are fond of Asian cuisine do visit the place.

Had read about this place on Zomato about a month back. Always wanted to visit this place to try on their sushi. Had to decide on a place to treat friends for birthday and I without any hesitation decided on this.
The restaurant is small, yet spacious. We were a group of 9 and didn't have any problem finding seats. The minimal decor set a calm ambience. 5/5 for the ambience and interiors. The first disappointment as we entered was that the staffs informed us that sushi was not available for the day as the chef was sick. We decided not to go anywhere else but give the other dishes a try. We ordered Bok Choi Wrapped Chicken Dumplings, Veg Dumplings, Chicken Satay, Fireball Chicken and Crispy Fried Spicy Chicken for starters. Special mention for the Bok Choi Wrapped Chicken Dumplings. The sauce that was served on it was amazing. Chicken Satay was something new but wouldn't be liked by one who loves spicy stuffs. The other dishes were pretty good too.
For mains we ordered Pad Thai noodles, Szechuan Rice, Burnt Garlic Coriander Rice and Nasi Goreng along with Firecracker chicken, Szechuan chicken. They have veg, chicken or prawns options for all the staples. The Pad Thai noodles was great. We loved it completely. Kudos for the presentation of Nasi Goreng. It was an awesome dish with a mixed sweet and sour flavour. The Szechuan rice was cooked well. Not too spicy yet yummy. The Burnt Coriander Rice was simple and tasty. The Firecracker Chicken tasted well but nothing great as a dish. It looked like a chilly chicken with added gravy. The Szechuan Chicken was good.
Overall the food was quite amazing. Found a lot of variations other than the mainstream Chinese menu. The presentation of the food was awesome as well. The staffs were very polite and told us about every dish.
The only thing that restricts me from giving me a 4.5 is the slow service. The service was extremely slow and we had to wait for about an hour to get our mains after we finished the starters. Otherwise it was a great experience. We availed the 20% discount for students and the bill came upto Rs.3176 for 9 people, which was pretty much fine as the place and the food is concerned.
Will surely come back to try on sushi.

This is really a gem of a restaurant . The ambience was really awesome . Favorite playlist on the boxes . Food was really too good . Bok choi wrapped chicken dumplings had out of the world taste . We ordered for  rice noodles, mixed fried rice , fire cracker chicken , honey chicken and black seasame ice cream with darsaan . The dessert was something I would recommend every dessert-lover to go for . Main course was.pretty good too .  Sufficient quantity , outstanding quality and pocket friendly . I loved it .

Had been hearing about a sushi place for a while and finally decided to look for it... Zomato said it was in the park Street area, but we eventually found it on Kyd street which is somewhat further than main park Street. We went there for sushi, so we ordered a seafood bento to get an assortment of the option. It included 2 salmon maki, 2 salmon nigiri, 2 chicken and 2 crab maki. The sushi was just as good as any other sushi I have had in Kolkata, but the prices were rather affordable. Then we ordered bok Choi wrapped chicken dumplings which were basically like no-carb dumplings and tasted really good and healthy. For mains we had ordered the chicken pad thai and the waiter suggested we should take a side with it, so we ordered a firecracker chicken. When the pad thai arrived we found out that it was pretty good by itself and did not really need a side to go with it, but none the less, the firecracker chicken was delightful and just the write amount of spicy. There was a mocktail on the menu called 'pinky dinky' which we ordered just for the name. It turned out to be a mixture of guava and orange juice, nothing too special to be honest. The proportion of pad thai and firecracker chicken were quite large and 3 of us had to struggle to finish it. It was a filling meal which amounted to a total of ‚Çπ1110 which was under 400 per head.
All in all a pleasant meal. They have some kind of a membership system so you can get discounts on later visits. Would definitely recommend the salmon nigiri for seafood lovers.

Great place to visit for anyone who loves Sushi and other Chinese & Thai dishes. I've visited this joint twice already in a span of a week. The ambiance is great and so is their playlist; the staff is very friendly and the service is prompt. Also, it isn't too crowded which is a plus point. When we visited, we ordered Pad Thai noddles (which is great and very filling for two people). As for Sushi we ordered Crab Maki; Salmon Nigiri & Chicken Teriyaki Roll; and each of them were great!I would love if they could expand on their Japanese menu (there aren't many cheap and good Japanese restaurant in the city after all).

As for Sushi we ordered Crab Maki; Salmon Nigiri & Chicken Teriyaki Roll; and each of them were great!I would love if they could expand on their Japanese menu (there aren't many cheap and good Japanese restaurant in the city after all).

We are really thankful to Zomato for featuring this gem of a restaurant in the Hidden gems collection. We were really skeptic about the food since it was Christmas eve and we were the only ones there. For starters we decided to order Salmon sushi and Bakchoy wrapped chicken dumplings (BWCD) thinking we'd go ahead with the remaining meal only once satisfied. 
The BWCD with its succulent meat filling truely turned the tables. Obviously, we went ahead with the main course. We ordered Pad Thai Noodles, Nasi Goreng and Fire cracker chicken. All abdolutely yummy with Pad Thai being everyone's common favourite. There was no stopping us then. We went ahead with ordering Bibimbap and Chicken Satay. Bibimbap was a beauty and I regret not clicking a pic of it.  
Overall, the experience was truely satisfying. The staff were really courteous and sweet ( even after witnessing us fumbling with our chopsticks). The pricing was surprisingly reasonable. We had 7 dishes for a total of Rs 1300 of which we got a 10% discount wia ewards. 
Its criminal for such an amazing restaurant to remain hidden for long. We really look forward to make them our go to place for our asian hunger pangs in future.

Ok so 1st of all location is bit difficult to find.But the restaurant is a hidden gem.A very pocket friendly indeed.We tried the seafood platter Sushi, Chicken Dumplings & Wasabi ice-cream. Wanted to try sushi so this restaurant does offer sushi at a very reasonable rate.Salmon Sushi was not tasty but rest of them was good.Wasabi Ice-cream was a huge disappointment.Dumplings were no doubt really good.We would like to visit this place again.

Had sushi for the first time. It was a memorable day. :p we were sitting in front of the cucumber maki that they just served us with no clue how to place things and how to start eating. We browsed YouTube for an illustration on how to have a sushi xD well, we didn't like the sushi. Not our type. Then we ordered another dish , khow suey .. they served a huge tray filled with numerous toppings and a large bowl of gravy with seemed to be daal .. and a bowl of boiled noodles.. it tasted good. :) The lime juice topping , added a nice flavor to the dish. The place looks quite classy. The staff members were very fine behaved and friendly too. The place is pocket friendly .. we came with a bill of around 290bucks. :P

Ended up there with a bunch of friends on a weekday afternoon! The ambiance hits you like any fine dining restaurant's, with beautiful wall decors, books and music. The staff is extremely ¬†courteous, and we ordered CRISPY FRIED SPICY CHICKEN, STIR FRIED NOODLES, SZECHUAN RICE , FIRECRACKER CHICKEN , SZECHUAN CHICKEN and CHOCOLATE BROWNIE WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM.
The Crispy Fried Spicy Chicken was quite tasty and brought out the typical desi Chinese flavour. Lip smacking in it's way. The noodles and rice were nothing extraordinary , however we preferred the noodles. The Firecracker Chicken had some zing to it, it was a tangy. Szechuan was pretty common, but had loads bell peppers and was well seasoned.¬†
The next was the brownie, it was a little dry and the texture was a bit off. The vanilla ice cream was smooth. But a small surprise came along with it, which was a mini chocolate tart. The biscuit base was beautifully baked, and so was the filling, which also had a tiny chocolate shrad! This was the best ¬†of the meal. Now came a complimentary Pistachio Ice cream, which was a complete fail because of a strange mustard smell. But the gesture was welcome! The pocket pinch was 350 for two people, which was decent considering the ambiance and location. ¬†Overall, it was a fun experience, but there's a lot of room of improvement.¬†

We had gone here for dinner and mainly for the purpose to try sushis for the first time.
Located in the ground floor of Dee Empresa hotel,it has a really nice ambience.
The staffs and the chef are very friendly and told us how to have sushis etc. üòä
We tried the salmon maki sushi and it was love. üòç
We had a dish in a big bowl which came with huge quantity of sushi rice,20 fried vegetables,fried egg,chicken.We had to mix it ourselves and serve.
The food is absolutely amazing here.‚ù§
It was fun sipping the lemongrass cooler and scribbling on the papers they keep on the table for that.‚úå
Will be visiting this place soon as we are a fan of their sushis now üòå

Visited this place on my birthday and loved every bit of it. The food was great and that too at a very reasonable price. The food comes in huge quantity. We started off our meal with Salmon Maki and Bok choi wrapped chicken dumplings. ¬†The crispy ¬†fried spicy chicken was amazing. We ordered 2 plates of Stir fried noodles and honey chicken. Ambience is great with courteous staffs. They were so nice to us :) Six dishes, three people and our bill was thousand bucks only :) Can't wait to visit this place again.

Today visited this place with my bff and tried some dishes quite new for our taste buds. The ambience and decoration is amazing. The staffs were really well-behaved and helpful. Prompt service with warm gestures made us feel comfortable immediately. We tried
Dracula's fav mocktail - it was lovely
Bok choy wrapped chicken dumplings - out of the world taste
Vietnamese rolls with crunchy vegetables- good quality and taste. But not for those who like something spicy
Bibimbap with chicken- my bff loved it but I couldn't even like the taste. Japanese dishes are clearly not for me. The dish is very colourful. But they had used excessive ajinomoto.
Darsans with vanilla ice cream- again it was one of the best darsans.

We had availed the 20% discount by showing our students Id card. And all these came at a price of Rs.809/- after the discount.
Will visit again to try out their other dishes. It was a really good experience.

Had gone on a saturday with a friend. They have a buffet only saturday which is pretty much the same every saturday except for some minor changes.
The place is very attractive and comfortable with good music. The hosts are extremely sweet and they make you feel at home. The ambiance is great. 
 My friend and I loved the food there. We went at around 1.15 p.m. for a 12.30 p.m. buffet and they had not yet organised or started it... so we had to wait a while. We started off with the khow suey which was nice and then we had sushi... sushi is not my cup of tea so i din't palate it well. 
The starters were all superb except for the crispy fried spicy chicken. The panggang fish and rock corn tempura need special mention.
The mains and dessert were all very nice. The szechuan prawn is a must have. The lobsters are a delight to see and eat . 
Overall the food quality is excellent and for 499 you are pretty much getting more than you could possibly ask for.
The only con was that it could be organised a bit better as there was a delay in getting quite a number of dishes and that we had to wait a while for the refills each time.

The day we visited,there was only buffet..plenty of veg & non veg starters..including fish,chicken,mushrooms n lot more..each n every dish was delicious..coming to the main course, noodles n rice lacked of varieties,though the available dishes were good..personally i dint like the sushi..desserts were good as well..
The environment was so calm & decent..behaviour of the stuffs were polite,and helpful.
Well,cant help myself sharing a funny incident..we visited this place on Saptami during durga puja..there was unlimited alcohol also at just 499 per person..a guy called "Naveen",after having drums of alcohol denied to pay..üòÇüòÇ and his friend already ruined the reception area vomitting..üòùüòù it was such a crazy incident..OMG..!

Whoever knew there was a hotel named Dee Empresa on Kyd Street? Moreover, who knew that it houses a restaurant called The Co. by Wok Anthems, a pan-Asian joint that is featured in the Hidden Gems collection of Zomato, along with legends like Chittoda‚Äôs Suruchee, Apanjan, Hungry Tide and Tung Nam? I, for one, did not. And all thanks to Zomato for leading me to this place for my last lunch in the city during my recent trip home. The place is easy to locate, Dee Empresa Hotel is right on Kyd Street, a little ahead after you cross Machherji‚Äôs, the only Parsi joint in the city. The restaurant is small and pretty, and it has a quirky, feel-good vibe that is not lost on you as you make yourself comfortable. Most of its customers, from what I understood, were the hotel‚Äôs guests, and hence foreigners. With a moderate level of expectation, we ordered our food. The buffet is what this place is known for, but that day the buffet was off due to the Diwali holidays, and we ordered off the menu.

The starters were Chicken Satay, Bok Choi Wrapped Chicken Dumplings (BCWCD), and Crispy Fried Spicy Mushrooms (CFSM). The Satay was the first to arrive, and it did not disturb my moderate expectations. The skewers were a little overdone, hence dry, and I have had some amazing satays at various places over time. The peanut sauce, however, was absolutely kickass ‚Äì a tinge of sweet, and a dollop of spice to go with the distinct flavor of peanuts ‚Äì the sauce promised good things to come. And boy, they did! The BCWCDs were the next item on our table, and they were served in a traditional bamboo steamer ‚Äì like many other places. There were two twists to the well-known preparation ‚Äì one, the casings were not made of flour but of Bok Choi leaves, and two, just when they served it, they opened the lid and poured in a runny mixture of soya, chili oil, and stock over the dumplings. Trust me, these were fabulous! I mean we couldn‚Äôt wait to devour them all, and the fact that one of us was vegetarian for the day (Diwali, you see) meant that we got her share too! This is a must-order when you happen to visit this place. The last starter was the CFSM, and I was already looking forward to the mains ‚Äì because vegetarian, duh! But hang on, how could something vegetarian taste so damn delicious! And I shit you not, these were some of the best mushrooms I have ever had! I don‚Äôt particularly like mushrooms, and I was kind of embarrassed to be seen stuffing them into my jowls faster than time! Another must-order you see ‚Äì I mean they were just batter fried funghi saut√©ed in sauces ‚Äì but somehow the combination hit all the correct notes and the result was brilliant. Hmm‚Ä¶ 96 words on a vegetarian dish, I don‚Äôt even‚Ä¶ but yeah, it was that good. Moving on, then.

For the mains, we ordered the Burmese Khow Suey (Veg) and the Korean Bibimbap (Chicken) {ask for their special menu}. The Khow Suey was great ‚Äì DIY, replete with all the condiments in good quantity, along with the noodles and coconut milk based gravy. I rustled up the bowls for the table, and acceptance came slowly, as the taste grew on the palette. A good Khow Suey is measured by the warm happiness it spreads through your body, and this was close to being one of the great ones. In a few moments, the Korean Bibimbap took the bar a little higher. I have had Bibimbap before, and it is a dish that looks absolutely fabulous, and very colorful with all the ingredients. This was no different, but the Gochujang Sauce served with it was not good at all. And say what, we didn‚Äôt need it! The contents of the bowl, once stirred with venom and intent, took a form that was subtle, flavorful, and filled with goodness. Each bite was an array of tastes, and I dare say this beat the taste of Caf√© Maroo in Pune, which is an authentic Korean joint. I am not sure if that‚Äôs just the Indian touch (look at Indian Chinese) but whatever it was, it left the three of us very very happy, and destroyed our friend‚Äôs resistance toward non-vegetarian food as she attempted to remove the chicken and egg bits and consume it. I didn‚Äôt tell her that she failed spectacularly, and I think she knew it too.

Well, that was one epic meal that was going to get more epic. How? Well, do you like Wasabi? Or Black Sesame? Yes? No? Forget it, what if they made ice-cream out of those flavors? And what if you ordered them? Well, you must! We ordered one of each flavor, and they were runaway blockbusters! I, personally, love Wasabi ‚Äì and the ice-cream was legendary. The zing of the Japanese magic spice with the richness and sweetness of milk and sugar ‚Äì just brilliant. Stuff dreams are made of. Well, the Black Sesame ice-cream was not too far behind, and actually, it got more love from the others ‚Äì the non-Wasabi-fanatics. I can vouch that these are ice-creams that will be etched in your memories for a long time - but yes, there is an outside chance that you may not like them if you are not open to new experiences, because that‚Äôs exactly what you are going to get!

Overall, a totally kickass meal at a severely under-known (?) place. These guys know their stuff. It is not easy to innovate and excel in a cuisine that Kolkata loves to bits, and is spoilt for choices when making a decision. The best part is that this place is truly pan-Asian ‚Äì we covered Indonesia, China, Japan, Burma, and Korea at one go ‚Äì and by the end of it, each preparation was distinct and rooted in its origin. A fabulous place for any occasion ‚Äì The Co. by Wok Anthems, YOU JUST MADE THE LIST!

HONEST REVIEWS...
Disappointed  .....
#Food hazard was found...(plastic)
#Sushi rice balls was absolutely horrible it was like a smashed regular boiled rice with lots of sugar in it . 
#salmon was not fresh at all ,it was more like a jelly.
#szechwan chicken was extremely tangy ,it dominated all the flavour ..(excuse was "it's not spoiled ,by mistake chef pored a lot of tomato sauce ..)the rule is chef should taste it before you server it!!
#garlic rice there was no garlic ...

Service:
 2staff in playing all the covers wow amazing.
#Food knowledge need to be improved.
#no service staff was present in the floor I could have just walked out without paying.
#food recommendation by the associate was totally illogical ...(turn off moment)

I am not trying to demoralise , discriminate by any mean ....but you should really try and improve your  food and service.
This was so disappointing to me and my friend ..I had to let you know ..just an HONEST REVIEWS. 
Thank you!

A small Business Hotel tucked away on Kyd St - I didn't know it existed till someone recommended their Cafe/Restaurant. Off we went to check it out last week and though the exterior was hardly impressive, the little restaurant was cute and served us a lovely meal!¬†
We had a fragrant & flavourful Tom Kha - an Indonesian ¬†coconut based soup
 followed by a Sushi platter with Salmon, Crab & Chicken mouthfuls which was declared 'very good' by my daughter;
 A Vietnamese 'Crunchy Vegetable in a Rice paper Wrap' was just passable and should avoid the raw onions next time;
 A Wonderful piquant sauce with lovely Bok Choy wrapped Chicken Dumplings were truly satisfying.¬†
However, I save the best for the end ~ we ordered a subtly flavoured Ice Cream which was just right (in my experience Wasabi can be overpowering)¬†
and, wait for it.......
A Fabulous De-Constructed Lemon Cheesecake - this was outstanding to say the least! I have stopped having Cheesecake after the heavy, creamy cheesecakes most places serve - this one revived my faith in Cheesecake - it was light, delicious and just crumbly enough to go back to, again and again!¬†
Do try it out!

This restaurant was suggested by a good friend of mine when I had told him about my desire of trying out Japanese cuisine. When I checked out their menu on Zomato I saw that the food is extremely affordable for students like us. So with two of my favourite people I went to this place. It's located on Kyd street. We three had no clue about which sushi to go for. The waiter was helpful enough and asked us to try out Chicken teriyaki. It's great as an appetizer. I loved the taste of it. Then we ordered for Bok Choi Wrapped Chicken Dumplings and pad thai noodles. I became a fan of their Pad Thai noodles seriously. It was absolutely delicious and so was their chicken dumplings. We wanted to have another round of sushi, so we ordered Crab Maki sushi. This one was very bland in taste in comparison to the teriyaki one. Lastly we ordered their special Chicken Satay. The peanut sauce provided with the grilled chicken was lovely. So if you ask me do try their Bok choi wrapped chicken dumplings, Pad Thai noodles and chicken teriyaki sushi because these three were simply amazing. The staff was also very helpful and cordial. Would love to visit this place again!

The best part is that this place is truly pan-Asian ‚Äì we covered Indonesia, China, Japan, Burma, and Korea at one go ‚Äì and by the end of it, each preparation was distinct and rooted in its origin. A fabulous place for any occasion ‚Äì The Co. by Wok Anthems, YOU JUST MADE THE LIST!

HONEST REVIEWS...
Disappointed  .....
#Food hazard was found...(plastic)
#Sushi rice balls was absolutely horrible it was like a smashed regular boiled rice with lots of sugar in it . 
#salmon was not fresh at all ,it was more like a jelly.
#szechwan chicken was extremely tangy ,it dominated all the flavour ..(excuse was "it's not spoiled ,by mistake chef pored a lot of tomato sauce ..)the rule is chef should taste it before you server it!!
#garlic rice there was no garlic ...

Service:
 2staff in playing all the covers wow amazing.
#Food knowledge need to be improved.
#no service staff was present in the floor I could have just walked out without paying.
#food recommendation by the associate was totally illogical ...(turn off moment)

I am not trying to demoralise , discriminate by any mean ....but you should really try and improve your  food and service.
This was so disappointing to me and my friend ..I had to let you know ..just an HONEST REVIEWS. 
Thank you!

A small Business Hotel tucked away on Kyd St - I didn't know it existed till someone recommended their Cafe/Restaurant. Off we went to check it out last week and though the exterior was hardly impressive, the little restaurant was cute and served us a lovely meal!¬†
We had a fragrant & flavourful Tom Kha - an Indonesian ¬†coconut based soup
 followed by a Sushi platter with Salmon, Crab & Chicken mouthfuls which was declared 'very good' by my daughter;
 A Vietnamese 'Crunchy Vegetable in a Rice paper Wrap' was just passable and should avoid the raw onions next time;
 A Wonderful piquant sauce with lovely Bok Choy wrapped Chicken Dumplings were truly satisfying.¬†
However, I save the best for the end ~ we ordered a subtly flavoured Ice Cream which was just right (in my experience Wasabi can be overpowering)¬†
and, wait for it.......
A Fabulous De-Constructed Lemon Cheesecake - this was outstanding to say the least! I have stopped having Cheesecake after the heavy, creamy cheesecakes most places serve - this one revived my faith in Cheesecake - it was light, delicious and just crumbly enough to go back to, again and again!¬†
Do try it out!

This restaurant was suggested by a good friend of mine when I had told him about my desire of trying out Japanese cuisine. When I checked out their menu on Zomato I saw that the food is extremely affordable for students like us. So with two of my favourite people I went to this place. It's located on Kyd street. We three had no clue about which sushi to go for. The waiter was helpful enough and asked us to try out Chicken teriyaki. It's great as an appetizer. I loved the taste of it. Then we ordered for Bok Choi Wrapped Chicken Dumplings and pad thai noodles. I became a fan of their Pad Thai noodles seriously. It was absolutely delicious and so was their chicken dumplings. We wanted to have another round of sushi, so we ordered Crab Maki sushi. This one was very bland in taste in comparison to the teriyaki one. Lastly we ordered their special Chicken Satay. The peanut sauce provided with the grilled chicken was lovely. So if you ask me do try their Bok choi wrapped chicken dumplings, Pad Thai noodles and chicken teriyaki sushi because these three were simply amazing. The staff was also very helpful and cordial. Would love to visit this place again!

You do not even need any image to refer, trust me the food is just fabulous. Getting Thai, Japanese and Oriental cuisine in so much variety plus so pocket friendly is like a dream come true. I drool on their mushroom sushi and I am yet to try their buffet, which i badly want to. Whatever you guys have to try it! Must try.

Buffet was not there, still great experience (actually later they informed that due to diwali less customers are there, so buffet option was unavailable.) Ordered Tempura Prawns, Crab Maki, Chicken Teriyaki Rolls, Salmon Nigiri, (3 Sushi) and Crispy Fried Spicy Chicken. Staff are good. All 3 sushi tasted good even for a first timer like me. But best was the Tempura Prawns. It was so crispy that it was possible to eat the prawns with shells. It was great experience.
Will visit again to try the buffet option.

The Co is listed in the hidden gems and is know serving buffet for lunch and dinner . That statement is enough to encourage pan Asian or foodie enthusiasts like us to go and explore the spread . And I was really really impressed at the quality of food that was served . Nowadays , there are a lot of restaurants who are currently serving buffet out of their normal comfort zone just to get the required attendance . But , The Co. has simply put the stake very high with their quality of items in the buffet . 

¬∞ Location :- Located at the Dee Empressa hotel this restaurant is located at kyd street . You have to take the lane next to the park street lane or you can enter park street take the turn of Mocambo walk straight into Mirza galib straight and then take a left turn to kyd street . Walk some distance and the Dee Empressa hotel will be on your right .

¬∞ Ambience & Service ( 4 / 5 ) :- Very classy and beautifully decorated . Since , it is from a 3 star hotel so it was never a surprise that the decor will be so beautiful . The servers are properly dressed and well behaved and polite . The cater to every needs and take care of all the details of the customers eating at the restaurant . Really impressed with the service and the ambience . 

-------------------------------------------

¬∞ Food :- Let's start reviewing the items in the buffet menu so that one can have a clear idea as to what to have and what to skip .

---------------
SUSHI
--------------

Salmon Maki , California roll , Chicken teriyaki :- I am not a fan of sushi and i find it distasteful . Those who really get this type of cuisine can have a try . I found the chicken teriyaki the only sushi to be eatable , the others were not right for my taste buds . So, let me just stop here and let the sushi lovers take the matters in their hands and thus i am not rating this dishes . Just keep in mind that there are 3 types of veg and 3 non veg sushis served just as mentioned in the menu .

---------------------
STARTERS
---------------------

1. Chilli potatoes ( 4 / 5 ) :- stir fried chilli potatoes perfect to start the meal . Recommended starter .

2. Non veg dumpling ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Quite the usual chicken dumpling , the outer covering was slight chewy . Nevertheless a decent dumpling .

3. Crispy fried spicy mushrooms ( 4.5 / 5 ):- Simply amazing . The mushrooms were perfectly stir fried with chilly sauce and they were really soft . Highly recommended .

4. Fried veg wanton ( 4 / 5 ) :- Not mentioned in the menu but we were happy to take it any day . Got cabbage filling and it was yummy . Recommended .

5. Panggang ( 4 / 5 ) :- These are medium pieces of fine quality basa covered in schezwan sauce and wrapped in aluminium foil and steamed . Although the fish was a little bland , I found the dish perfect as the quality of the dish was outstanding and I liked the taste of the steamed fish to go with . I will highly recommend this item .

6. Chicken satay ( 4 / 5 ) :- Boneless chicken strips fused with lemon flavor and grilled in sticks . This is like gondhoraj chicken kabaab . Amazing to taste . Highly recommended .

So, as you can see there are a lot of options and most of them are really tasty and worthy of a good pan Asian meal . Was really impressed with the quality of all the starters items . They serve the starters on table so you can ask for any item you want to be repeated and they will repeat .

-----------------------------------
MAIN COURSE
-----------------------------------

1. Khow Suey ( 3 / 5 ) :- They kept all the ingredients beside the buffet counter . You have to take a bowl , pour all the ingredients and make this dish urself . Of course they will help you in preparing the dish . So, we took noodles , pour the soup , sprinkled some chicken , spring onion , fried onion , coriender and some chilli . And our khow suey was ready . We found this exercise really worth it and i am sure you guys will love it finally after seeing the khow suey in place . As for the taste the broth is the main deal here so I found the taste similar to a mild sambhar . So, it was not that impressive to me but still it was a good thing to try for the first time . Recommended .

2. Pad Thai ( 4 / 5 ) :- I have read mixed reviews about this dish but if you ask me I loved it and i really don't know why it has mixed reviews .firstly the flavor is awesome , and it goes so well with the nuts . The flavor and the sauce is the real.deal here . Highly recommended from my side .

3. Schezwan fried rice ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Mild spicy veg fried rice . Was decent to go with the non veg main course items . Recommended .

4. Firecracker chicken ( 4 / 5 ):- Amazing chicken dish. In all the pan Asian buffet , I have never found the chicken dish to be good.  But it's an exception here. The chicken pieces are jumbo and tender and the sauce was amazing to taste . Similar to chilli chicken they simply were bang on with this dish . Highly recommended .

5. Hong Kong styled prawns ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Firstly the prawns were huge . Basically king prawns cooked in a wonderful gravy . Other places have their prawns covered in arrowroot but not here . We simply loved this dish and had a lot of prawns to our hearts content .

The veg items were okayish but not that spectacular . As you can see from the above ratings that the number if non veg items are not that huge and whatever they served they did really well . The chicken and prawns go fine at the this price and we were really impressed .

-----------------------
DESERTS
----------------------
1. Choco tarts ( 4 / 5 ) :- Fine tarts , well made . With a choco sauce on top this desert simply hits you with a choco delight . Recommended .

2. Blueberry mousse (4.5 / 5 ) :- This was even better . I am a big fan of blueberry and this mousse was perfect for me . Recommended .

Not a big spread of items . An ice cream could have been better but still whatever they have they did well 

--------------------------------------------------

Verdict :- A must must try buffet spread. Most ofbthe items are from their ala carte menu so you will have an idea of what they serve . And these are the items that are costly ordered . This pan Asian buffet is a better deal than the others that are in the city and also cheaper . Thats what I felt and thus have rated higher . Following are the main points :- 

1. Great classy ambience. 
2. Decent service .
3. Great array of veg and non veg starters .
4. Awesome chicken and prawn main dish 
5. Fine pan Asian buffet at 499 inclusive taxes .

Would encourage foodies to visit atleast once and see for urself as to what they serving is . I am pretty confident that you won't be dissapointed.  My best wishes to the team and the chef for the future and I am thankful to them for cooking up this fine buffet .

I chose this place for treating my friends for my birthday and it did not disappoint us. 
For starters we took Bak Choy wrapped Chicken Dumplings and Crispy Fried Spicy Chicken. Dumplings were really good along with the sauce that came with it. The crispy chicken was a bit chewy. 
For main course we ordered Pad Thai Noodles with Firecracker Chicken. We also took Prawns in Lime Juice.
The flat noodles was totally different from anything I had tasted before and so It was a good change of palate. The prawn was extraordinary though. Overall a good experience!

If u are looking for authentic Japanese.... this is not the place for u. We tried the buffet... The quality of the food was good.... how ever some were a little too sharply  flavoured for the palette. For the price of the buffet there were lots n lots of options.... for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. The sushi was good not extraordinary... the cereals...average.....prawn excellent and khaoshuey ...ok. all in all u can try once if u are desparate to have oriental but not burn a hole in ur pocket....

Me and my friend were in the mood to try something new! And so we decided to try Sushi from Wok Anthems.

This was my first time with Sushi.
We ordered Chicken Teriyaki roll as suggested by the really well behaved waiter there since it was new to us. The taste was totally new for me and with the wasabee and soya sauce added to it, felt quite tasty. But due to the small size of sushis we finished it within a few minutes! :P

Next we ordered Salmon Nigiri with crab teriyaki (which was a surprise)
Its almost like sushi with rice and a fillet of salmon on top. Even though its my first time trying Salmon but couldnt find any taste.
The crab teriyaki roll tasted better than chicken!

Since we were too full to try main course we went straight to the desert and ordered Vanilla crepe and Dracula's fav.
Vanilla Crepe was really delicious.
Dracula's fav was jus another soda based drink which was refreshing nevertheless.

I really appreciate the less number of items in the menu and the specialization over few cuisines. It ensures quality and also reduces the problem of not being able to decide over a huge menu card.

The price of items are very reasonable in my opinion.
Will surely go again to try out the main course specially.

Really enjoyed the experience.
Keep up the good work.

Recommended for those willing to try something new!

I have visited this place to introduce my girlfriend with sushi about which she was quite apprehensive from start. Precisely speaking this is a budget friendly place for having good sushi especially for first timers. Note that the place have a nice warm ambience with very cooperative staff who were just happy to help and provide their suggestions, however the sushi here is good but not great. The fish is fresh, delicate and the sticky rice had a sweet after taste which is a very nice welcome. They put in pieces of cucumber in the sushi which came to me as a surprise but it only added to the texture. I will recommend taking the seafood bento which is an assortment of tuna, salmon, prawn. Personally didn't find the tuna quite upto the mark and the prawn was the best. However it is not the best that I have had. They keep a bit of exoskeleton on the tail. But overall its very good. Only because I kept comparing with the ones I had at Big Wong, it didn't pull off the magic I was expecting. I would like to suggest the chef to give the prawns a nice crispy coat of batter to add to the flavour. But I am sure for a first timer it is gonna be a great experience. Infact this place serves the cheapest sushi in town, I think and the quality is more than worth it.

Small but very pocket friendly place, the ambience is so beautiful and so is the food.. loved the sushi , so delicious and so very cheap... the service was also very good.. the only reason I am giving it 3.5 is that they have a very selective menu , not much option.... but apart from that it's a very nice and beautiful place for a nice dinner or lunch.. so for a very posh fine dine experience without upsetting your wallet please do visit this place 
I will surely go again..

The staff were always on their toes trying to make the guests comfortable, the service was very prompt, never had to notify them of anything, food was decent and the interiors were nicely done. Definitely worth visiting, if you're new to the world of sushi!

This restaurant is a part of the dee empresa hotel, located at it's ground floor in the lane of Kyd street. Just to try something different we chose this place and this place didn't actually disappoint us much. Ambiance is pretty nice with courteous staffs and good music. Coming to food we had ordered their salmon maki sushi which was not so good, then we had one of their signature dishes that is bok choi chicken dumplings which was really awesome and was served hot,and lastly from their mains we ordered a Burmese dish that is khao suey. Khao suey is enough for 2 persons. Pocket-pinch is not that much as compared to other restaurants those who serve pan-asian cuisines. Had a nice time.

Small but very pocket friendly place, the ambience is so beautiful and so is the food.. loved the sushi , so delicious and so very cheap... the service was also very good.. the only reason I am giving it 3.5 is that they have a very selective menu , not much option.... but apart from that it's a very nice and beautiful place for a nice dinner or lunch.. so for a very posh fine dine experience without upsetting your wallet please do visit this place 
I will surely go again..

Great food great ambience great hospitality these are the words to describe this restaurant in short. Only thing is they should increase their arsenal of foods,  items are so limited.  Otherwise it is a great place to have your lunch or dinner.

Visited yesterday for lunch after seeing a good review on zomato. Although I was hoping for an alacarte menu but they had buffet yesterday instead. Coming to the food directly. I am actually divided in opinions. Most of their items were good and tasteful with lot of flavours. The Khow Suey and the sushis however were very bland. Khow Suey lacked the aproriate galangal flavour in it. Anyways overall I was impressed. The ambience and service no complain about them. Need to visit for their ala carte. Ofcourse price was reasonable given overall experience.

This place is well polished and attractive with their minimal decor. Nice and warm atmosphere with sections of wall covered by posters. The menu is not vast though it offers selection of Thai, Japanese and other oriental dishes. We ordered a seafood bento which was not upto the mark since the seafood in it was mainly frozen. That's a bit let down but their chicken satay was good. Though nothing to brag about. Another let down was not having enough dessert options. Although the staff were very friendly and helpful.

We went there yesterday after reading good reviews about it. You can easily locate this restaurant on KYD  street. Ambience is very calm and pleasant. Food  also tasted really good specially the mushroom balls of fire. For the dessert we ordered black sesame ice cream, Oh! It was a delight to our taste buds. Overall a good place in a pocket friendly budget.

Reading excellent reviews about this place I decided to give my birthday treat here and all i can say is the place is worth every buck you spend.
Location: Can be easily located on KYD street ...its just beside park street and a 5 minutes of walk

Ambience:Wonderful decor, soothing lights, nice seating arragement,has 3 bookshelves containing encyclopedias on various topics

Staff:Were very courteous,polite,ready to help out with the menu...the menu is short but the quality of the food is very high to say the least.

Food: Was the best aspect of the place.we ordered the following
1.Bok Choi chicken dumpling: It was a steamed chicken dumpling nice,fresh and juicy and the leaf covering gave it a nice texture and the sauce just gave an extra tang and the net result was deliciousness!!
2.Chicken Teriyaki Roll: Frankly Sushi is not everyones cup of tea....to love sushi one needs to understand the fishy,salty taste of japanese cuisine....but as far me and my friends  go..we thoroughly loved the dish

3.Khow Suey: Was the best of lot.We ordered the non veg version.It is actually a make it yourself dish of noodles with a wide variety of condiments..it consisted of beresta,fried garlic,coriander,spring onion,green chilli,boiled egg,chicken pieces and cocunut puree containing curry leaves..we made up our own variety and it left us wanting for more..the stopping factor being our budget!!üòÇüòÇ

Firecreacker Chicken and Nisa Goreng Rice: The combination was fantastic ...very soft and succulent chicken..and the fried rice tasted equally good

Now comes the dish creating a lasting impression
Wasabi ice cream: Man what was that!! Ice cream never tasted better than that!!Me and my friends were fighting for a spoonful of it!!‚ò∫

Cost:Full four course meal cost us 1250 for four..if this is not pocket friendly what is??

Overall had a very sumptuous meal at a very reasonable price and best part was my friends congratulating me for giving my birthday treat in this gem.The managemnt is doing a fine job and i hope they maintain their standards for long....definitely coming back to try more from their special menu!

The ambience is really good, but the service was really slow. They have a buffet option where either you can take unlimited soft drinks or you can get one peg of hard drink. Well tried both of the deals... And both are really bad... They just mix a lot of water with the soft drinks nd the same is with the hard drinks... They say that they will give 60ml but it seemed that they didn't even give 20ml... The starters were good but the main course sucked... Fried rice with no taste... Chicken tasted like rubber... The desert was good with an option of cake and mango custard... That was good... I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PLACE ONLY OF YOU HAVE A LOT OF MONEY TO WASTE. Highly disappointed with the type of service.

Through Zomato came to know about this sushi joint in a nondescript part, hidden in the ground floor of Dee Empresa hotel located on Kyd Street. ¬†We went for their buffet lunch on 18th Sep. The ambiance is nice but the restaurant is small. Staff are pleasant and welcoming. Starters were served promptly and we liked the crispy fried chicken, dumplings, chilly baby corns and steamed fish. However, there was a time lag between starters and the main course. It took a while to set their buffet table, probably due to some problem in the kitchen. Later on the manager apologized for the delay which we accepted in good spirit. After the starters we went after the 6 types of sushi which were good, specially the california rolls, salmon make, asparagus/cucumber maki. Chicken teriyaki roll was good too. The wasabi was little dry and was not very strong. In main course szechwan prawn and rendang chicken were tasty and properly cooked that went well with the stir fried noodles. The fried rice was a bit disappointing. We didn't find mushroom crackers and shanghai style veg on the buffet table though were listed. In dessert the chocolate ganache cake was good. Mango mousse was ok. Here again we didn't find the black sesame ice cream on the table. Overall the food experience was good and look forward to another visit sometime. ¬†Hopefully by then the small hiccups in service would be taken care of!

Located on the Ground Floor of Dee Empressa Hotel on Kyd Street, The Co. by Wok Anthems has perhaps one of the most unique menus in the city at extremely reasonable prices. This place has been on my wishlist for months now, and finally I visited the place a week ago with a couple of friends for lunch. We were early and the first ones there. The ambience was lovely, with a bookshelf in one corner and a very interesting collage of vintage magazine covers.

I must say, ¬†love limited menus. Less fuss about what to choose and the dishes generally turn out to be good. However, within the limit of two pages they have managed to pack dishes from all over South East Asia, from Chinese stir fries and Thai curries to Japanese sushis and Korean Bibimbap.
Coming to the food, we started off our meal with mushroom balls of fire and chicken satay. The mushroom starter was filled with a rice and mushroom mixture encased in a crispy coating, served atop a bed of hot chilli garlic sauce. It was missing the ¬†garnish it normally has and although it tasted good, I wished there was a bit more mushroom. The schezuan sauce however was deliciously spicy and helped to kick start our palate. The chicken satay was strictly okay. It tasted a bit bland and chewy but the peanut sauce that came with it was to die for.
.
For mains we chose the Khao suey, Bibimbap and Firecracker chicken. This was my first experience with Khao suey and I loved the do-it-yourself approach to the dish. You assemble your own soup and add condiments to your liking. It tasted extremely hearty and delicious, with a dominant flavour of lime leaves. I loved the sheer variety of condiments, 9 to be exact, that added various flavours and textures in each bite.

The Bibimbap, surprisingly, was even better. It looked gorgeous with its array of colours. This too was a hands-on dish, in which we had to mix all the veggies and chicken with the sushi rice underneath, add the apple bell pepper sauce served along with it. Rice, bell peppers, mushroom, zucchini, bokchoy, chicken, fried egg and finally the sauce..... they all mix together to create a gorgeous symphony in the mouth. This was my most favourite dish yet. Although the Bibimbap can easily be had on its own, we decided to order firecracker chicken to go with it. It tasted good, but it was okayish.

Then came desserts. I have always been a fan of quirky desserts with weird flavours and textures and so I naturally opted for their signature ice creams, black sesame and wasabee. Served in small scoops in a martini glass, it looked pretty interesting. The black sesame ice cream was full-on in its roasted sesame flavour. Although the sesame made the texture just a tad grainy, but overall it tasted gorgeous. Even better was the wasabee ice cream. Smooth and creamy in texture, it seemed a bit flat in the first mouthful, but after 3 to 4 spoons the wasabi flavour slowly creeps in. The slight burn of the wasabi at the black of the throat balanced by the smoothness and cool of the ice cream, it was an amazing experience and probably one of the best desserts I have ever had.¬†

The staff were extremely polite and although service was a tad slow and honestly, we didn't mind and enjoyed a laid-back meal. The value for money here is amazing, considering the quality and amount of food served. A big thumbs up on that account.

Although the starters seemed a bit average, the mains and desserts simply blew us away. The Khao Suey, the Bibimbap and the ice creams..... I will definitely be back for second and third helpings. I definitely have to try out the sushi next time. Definitely and most highly recommended to all lovers of Asian cuisine who are looking for something different from the usual Chinese fare.

Look, you could be one of the two types - if you are the type who loves Indian Chinese and the greasy spicy Kung pao chickens, then the Co. is your place to visit for new and hence untried items like Bibinbap and Nigiri Sushi at very reasonable price; or if you are the type that is a sushi snob and have backpacked in Japan or Korea or that eats only at five stars, still visit the Co. only to try out how affordable sushi can be costing less than 350 bucks, without seeking the authenticity. 

Because, in a market where Japanese food is very expensive and which is dominated by more affordable Indian Chinese food, the Co. By Wok Anthems is that rebel that actually managed to introduce absolutely new and novel pan Asian dish (that requires imported ingredients) at such reasonable price.

The break down 
Pros
Limited menu hence better attention to each dish. 
Adequate portion. 
Reasonably priced. 
Less surround noise hence decent for a date. 

Cons
Limited menu and customers opting for rice and curry? 
Same sauce is being served with the maki and nigri.A variation will be welcome. 
The rice can be boiled a little more.

The Mocktail we had was Dracula Fav which was tasty and refreshing ! We had the Honey Chicken , Firecracker Chicken , Stir Fried noodles , Fried Rice and Schezwan Rice . All of them were well prepared and the Hobey Chicken was exceptional ! We ordered Bibimbap with Chicken also but was disappointed to find a strand of hair in it . It was quickly changed and made up for ! So enjoy !

Being an anime fan, I always wanted to try Japanese dishes, especially sushi. This is what interested me in the menu when I stumbled across the restaurant in Zomato, and that is the principal reason why my friend (another anime lover) and I went here. That, and the everlasting urge to try a new dish or cuisine.
First, about the decor and ambiance. The decor is very beautiful with a variety of film posters and book covers adorning the walls. And I must mention the washroom signboards. Too bad we forgot to click a picture of it. The ambiance was also good with Enrique playing in the background. The staff were awesome. They answered every question of ours with patience (we had many about the dishes), and as we were first timers, they also informed us about the process of eating each particular dish.
We ordered the Salmon maki (a sushi), Bibimbap, Firecracker chicken and Wasabi ice cream. As we both are totally new to this cuisines, except for the Firecracker chicken, I can and will not comment on their preparations, for this is the first time we are having it. I will only ¬†comment on how I found the taste.
The Salmon maki (Pic 1) looks like the typical sushi you see in the shows. It is served¬†with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce. [Let me mention a little about wasabi here. It is basically Japanese horseradish. It has a strong, crude taste that packs a punch in your mouth. If you have too much of it, you will have a burning, itching sensation in your mouth and throat.] You add some pickled ginger and a pinch of wasabi on the sushi, dip it in the soy sauce and put the whole in your mouth. Many are somewhat repelled by the idea of trying sushi because of the fact that it contains raw fish, but after trying, I didn't find the taste bad at all. And the saying, that sushi is an acquired taste, is very true, because as I proceeded my third piece (each plate contains 6), it tasted better and better.
Bibimbap (Pic 2, 4) is a Korean dish. It is a big bowl of boiled rice topped with a variety of vegetables- green, yellow and red capsicum, carrots, sprouts, bok¬†choy, zucchini, and mushrooms. You are served an apple and capsicum sauce (Pic 3, 4) with it. You put the sauce in the bowl and mix the rice, vegetables, and sauce thoroughly, serve and eat it. As this is a traditional Korean family dish, the staff doesn't serve it, you have to mix and serve it yourself. It has an awesome taste‚Äì a hint of sweet with a hint of sour. A thoroughly enjoyable dish.
The Firecracker chicken (Pic 3, 4) looks like the side dish you will get in any other Chinese restaurant. But the taste is a perfect balance of sweet, sour, hot and spicy‚Äì exactly as the name suggests.
The Wasabi ice cream (a popular dessert in Japan) (Pic 5): All's well that ends well. But it didn't for us. Japan, you were very... v-e-r-y close to giving us a perfect ending to the dinner. But you hit the shot ¬†faaaar¬†off the mark. I have already mentioned about Wasabi. The ice cream tastes exactly like the paste, only slightly toned down and cold. It will itch and burn your mouth and throat. (Mine is still sore after two and a half hours!) It was like a very good anime ending with a tentacle hentai! Do not even think of trying this ice cream.
All in all, It was an enjoyable experience. This place is one of my best findings at Zomato. I would highly recommend it to all who want to have Asian cuisines.

The Co. as a restaurant, is situated inside the Dee Empressa Hotel, Kyd Street, beside the Geological Survey of India campus. It is a humble venture, not very lavish or big, yet there is something about the theme of its interiors that is bound to captivate one's interest. Several funky book-shelves were decked with publications on cuisine, culinary skills and technique. The wallpapers, even the direction to the gents and ladies wasrooms were very unique, sort of abstract art.
We found buffet arrangements placed at a corner, for a team of business delegates from the Dee Empressa Hotel. This place is gradually acquiring fame, and is a hidden gem, yet to be found my many. 
The menu is very small yet offers various uncommon South-Asian delicacies one might not expect to find at such low price.
We ordered for :
1. Sushi Salmon Maki (quite new to this taste, actually liked it better with soy, and not with the complementary wasabi and ginger)
2. Bok Choy wrapped chicken dumplings (out-of-the-world, craved for more!!! Hence a must try)
3. Pad Pak (Thai noodles, quite authentic and tasty, sufficient for 2)
4. Nasi Goreng (A rice preparation, with lots of chicken, also very tasty and sufficient for 2)
5. Chicken fire-crackers (Again a wonderful dish, with a certain sweet-but-tangy flavour, bound to be loved).
All of this in just 900 (inc. Taxes)!!
Surely will come back to try the other items. Great job fellows....

Recently had lunch at this place.

Location:ground floor of hotel de empresa on kyd street.Keep walking past the mla hostel and it would be on your left

Ambience: clean,bright clutter free.as it is a part of the hotel there were mostly inhouse diners.

Service:not too fast.each dish arrived seperately after we finished the previous dish.we would have liked the main course dishes together.But they were courteous.

Food:The most important part.our order was

Bokchoy wrapped chicken dumplings:excellent in taste and texture.with six small balls in each plate,we wished there was more

Lemongrass cooler: good again.I would have preferred lesser fizz though.

Bibimbap:this was the best part of the meal.different types of julienned veggies and chicken layered atop a bed of flavourful sticky rice with a fried egd on top.you can mix them all and have it,or taste a different veggie with each spoonfull of rice

Nasigoreng and firecracker chicken: these were average stuff.they tasted very good,but not much experiment here.the firecracker chicken is like your regular dry chilly chicken.and nasigoreng is your regular fried rice with brocolli.not much impressed with the rice.

Thai red curry: comes with a generous portion of steamed rice.quantity is more than enough for 2.taste is very good and authentic.lots of veggies made me happy with the gravy.

We were too full for desserts.so next time we will return for their khao suye and signature ice creams.
Our bill was Rs.1500/- for four.

I wasn't expecting much judging by where it's located, but my mind has sufficiently been blown. We were a little confused by the music, though. Must try's - the salmon nigiri rolls, the vanilla ice cream with that weird sauce + the steamed fish in chilly oil. The pencils kept alongside the cutlery is a nice touch, guys. Good stuff!

LOCATION & AMBIANCE
Had heard a lot of about this restaurant and decided to try yesterday for a family dinner. 
The Co by Wok Anthems in located inside the Dee Impressa Hotel on Kyd street. 
The hotel is a budget corporate hotel in the segment and has decent infrastructure.
The restaurant is located on the ground floor adjacent to the reception. 
The restaurant has a buffet, 8-9 tables and is well decorated. Colorful chairs and yellow lighting dominate the interiors. There is a book section on a grey wall which was quite interesting. Old magazines poster wallpapers were quite eye catchy.

FOOD
We ordered for the following-
‚Ä¢ Pinky Dinky- which was orange and guava juice. The drink failed to impress
‚Ä¢ Dracula's fav which was pomegranate juice and was a bad mocktail to order
‚Ä¢ Soft drinks which we had to order coz the drinks were a disaster
‚Ä¢ Veg bento - Paneer and cucumber sushi rolls wrapped and steamed well. Was served with salty vinegar #recommended
‚Ä¢ Veg star shaped dumplings which was indeed a star dish! The dumpling fill sheet was amazing, the filling was tasty and the sauce packed in good flavours #recommended
‚Ä¢ Stir fried noodles was good and tasty
‚Ä¢ Firecracker mushrooms came in  semi gravy and was delicious #recommended
‚Ä¢ Veggies in Hong Kong style was my personal favorite 
‚Ä¢ Schezwan rice which was not spicy at all! #disappointing 
‚Ä¢ Basil Panacotta tasted like Rabri #disappointing 

SERVICE
They didn't refill glasses or serve food initially. Most of the items were not available ( lemongrass cooler, tofu, most of the desserts) and they weren't really guiding us with the already puny menu!

Overall, an average experience and I don't think I am coming back again.

The restaurant located at Kyd Street is one of my best recent  finds. The decor is subdued yet it is very different from the other new eateries which are mostly kitsch. One of the few places where the attendant told me that everything is available. I felt like tasting the entire menu which I would by end of September  ‚ò∫. I had bak choy wrapped dumplings which are super tasty and a must try. The Nasi goreng was just right. Fire cracker chicken had subtle taste of star anise giving it a different flavour...And the dessert of Pana cotta and Wasabi ice cream was yum. If you like good food and is tired of the pubs with their copy cat decor....you can visit this pla@ce for a lazy brunch. The price point is fantastic and the people were friendly with their suggestions yet  discreet...Loved this place and a MUST VISIT FOR ALL..

Launch of new menu at The Co. By Wok Anthems..!

An off-spot destination, where food is the only quotient which defines the sole success and popularity of the restaurant. Located in the ground floor of Dee-Empressa Hotel, this place specializes in Korean and Japanese Cuisine. Minimal d√©cor, the walls have small postercards and pictures glued together to form a collage, while a separate section has brown plywood as a partition with names scribbled on it. Small shelves on this brown partition, with books on them to entertain the guests. Red velvet cushioned chairs gives the visitor comfort, while the trees maintain natural essence. The lighting is dim and creates an intoxicating weather inside. The menu may not be extensive, but is surely elaborate.

Known for their Sushis, and mostly for the combo box, this place has managed to garner much success in this short time they have been in operation. Each of the dishes has been researched well and has been carefully curated by the owner and the chef. High quality ingredients are sourced and hence it gives each of the people walk in a good value for their money. The tables are a bit narrow, but that isn‚Äôt much of a problem. To keep the people engaged, there is a separate paper menu provided, and a pencil to jot down your order. The latest addition is the introduction of the chopsticks, which was absent earlier. I had been to this place before all alone, and had always wanted to come back for an extensive food tasting.

Little did I know that my wish was to come true. Team #panchphoron was invited over on the launch of the new menu this restaurant was planning to introduce. Keeping their old dishes intact, this was more like an icing on the cake, to widen the scope of the offerings the restaurant has in store. Reaching the place wasn‚Äôt very difficult. If one knows Kyd Street, i.e. the lane just before one turns towards Park Street from Jawaharlal Neheru Road, keep coming straight, and the hotel would fall to your left. The owner and the chef wanted us to try anything we would like to, and hence began our gastronomical expeditions.

Mocktails:

1) Pinky Dinky: Combination of Guava and Orange juice mixed in shaker with ice and served on a Martini glass. The drink looked appealing, but somehow the tanginess of the Orange was missing. The thickness of the mocktail was also a concern for me. The Guava was very much predominant, and hence made it impossible to identify the existence of Orange as such in this drink.

2) Lemongrass Cooler: Lemongrass juice served along with an aerated drink with plenty of ice. Mostly seen these days when it comes to providing refreshing mocktails, the fizziness of the soda, along with the lemongrass provided much relief to our thirsty souls. The drink was undoubtedly fizzy but at the same time was refreshing as well.

3) Draculas Fav: Pomegranate juice shaken with Ice and then mixed with an aerated drink. All natural drink, other than the aerated portion ofcourse, the freshness of the pomegranate went pretty well with the aerated counterpart. What impressed us the most was the look and color of the same.

4) Tango Mango:Fresh Mango blended with Milk and Ice Cream served in a small bottle! More of a Mango Shake, this is a pure delight for anyone who is a Mango Lover. Creamy, smooth and Milky, a must have for a Mocktail.

Mains:

5) Bibimbap- A Korean dish, which is served in a bowl with Cooked Sushi rice which is used as bed for chicken and vegetable  which include zucchini, mushrooms, Pok Choi, Bean Sprouts with a sunny side up egg. The first thing which would impress you here is the sheer presentation and the contrast of colors. All of the basic components and ingredients are kept separate and gives you a wonderful visual pleasure. As they say, presentation is everything. As you cut through the egg, and it mixes with the rice and other vegetables, it gives you a sheer ecstasy and goosebump.

6) Mushroom Balls of Fire: Balls of fire as the dish's name is: mushroom balls mixed with some Szechuan Oil. Not at all spicy though, the oil content was very less. The Mushrooms however, were wonderfully marinated with spices. The exterior was soft and crisp as well. 

7) Chicken Balls of Fire: The dish is the same like mushroom, these are served with minced chicken. The chicken bits and pieces tasted a bit bland though. Could not really hit our tastebuds like the mushroom balls of fire did. The difference between the two, other than the sharp contrast in taste was the color from the outside. One was dark brown, while the other was golden/light brown.

8) Prawns in Lime Juice: Prawns served with pickled zucchini, the prawns are tossed in lime juice to give the tangy taste to it. Undoubtedly the best dish for the evening.  The softness of the pawns and tanginess of the lime juice was simply mindblowing.

9) Grilled Salmon with Teriyaki Sauce: Salmon Fillets cooked delicately with skin on it. It's served on a platter, flat noodles give the base to the dish. The Salmon is drizzled with Teriyaki Sauce. Most people may not prefer the fish with the skin on it. But for quintessential Bengali, this is of no concern. The fish melted in the mouth, and the addition of the sauce gave it a sweet and soury touch.

10) Scallops with Horseradish Cream: Ceviche of scallops which is served with basil oil, seaweed paper infused butter. The horseradish cream is the base of the dish. The scallops are blowtorched to give colour to it. Perhaps, the most expensive of all the dishes. The quantity is absolutely minimum, but for those who know the price of scallops, they would understand the ground reality. The dish was pungent and the use of the Wasabee was a sheer masterpiece. 

11) Rock corn Tempuras: The corn is made in the shape of a rock like structure which is then fried and tossed in a sauce of mayonnaise and Szechuan sauce. 

Desserts:

12) Basil Infused Panacotta: Panacotta being one of the most famous dishes around the globe is served in a glass with whole basil leaves in the center of the Panacotta. To note, the use of basil leaves instead of basil oil, as seen in most of the restaurants, doesn‚Äôt let the bitter taste form within the dish.

13) Crepes with Vanilla Ice Cream: Crepes which is used as a blanket to cover the ice cream within it. The crepe was soft and did not go soggy. The batter was minimal and hence melted in the mouth. The ice cream added a fine touch to it.

14) Black Sesame Ice Cream and Wasabee Ice Cream: Both of the above ice cream dishes are the signature desserts in the house currently. Both being hand churned ice cream mixtures. Made in batches to perfection. The inclusion of a flavor like Wasabee into a desert is something unexpected, but I must admit, these guys had done a wonderful job with it. The Black Sesame Ice Cream wasn‚Äôt powerful in flavor, but was very delicate, with slight hint of the sesame. 

The gastronomical venture was indeed worth remembering. The uniqueness of every dish coupled with the fine quality of it, made us travel through wonderland the very little time we were there. The Chef Is a highly qualified person, and has spent countless hours to come up with the right menu and the twist and twirls behind it. Each of the dishes was freshly prepared, vouching for the fine taste behind it. The addition of the new menu is surely news of joy for foodies like me. With both the old and new in place, looking for more of such additions in the future.

A brilliant Pan Asian joint at pretty reasonable prices. Bright yet minimal decor, very helpful staff and extremely fast service, this place should climb up on the must visit list of the city's food connoisseurs. Coming to the most important part : the food. The menu though small offers a decent variety.  The starters bowled us over. We ordered Bok choy wrapped dumplings and chicken teriyaki rolls, a sushi-like preparation. We were a bit apprehensive initially but both were extremely flavorful. For the mains we ordered Nasi Goreng, an Indonesian rice preparation, a variation of fried rice basically, along with Firecracker Chicken. The portions were generous, tastes very satisfactory. If the starters were like powerplay, desserts have to be given due credits for being slog overs of the lunch. Both the wasabee ice cream and black sesame ice cream were clean hits out of the park... Most unique desserts I have had in recent past. It was raining heavily outside...within the cosy environs of The Co. by Wok Anthem we had a wonderful afternoon with some amazing delicacies. Highly recommended.

Nice food, great ambience.. Situated inside dee empressa hotel, this place is easily locatable. We ordered bibimbap with chicken.. Firecracker chicken, lemonade and chicken teriyaki sushi.. Sushi was good but could have been better.. Firecracker chicken was spicy chinese preparation..and bibimbap was full of fried veggies.. Juicy chicken coupled vd egg poach perfectly completed our meal vd sushi, firecracker chicken .. Lastly dessert was the best amongst all.. A must try , lemon cheesecake.. One of the best restaurants to go near park street.. Will go there again to try pad thai noodles and nasi goreng vch i missed this time.

We went there today with a group of 7 people. Took an uber and took us straight to this hotel. It looks nice. The restaurant is small and got its own buffet. The buffet didnt interest us and it wasn't worth it also. So we ordered ala carte. To be honest, the service was really really slow but the food was pretty good. Worth the money. Ordered seafood bento, bakchoi dumplinga, chicken satay as appetizers. Main coarse, pad thai, szechuan rice, garlic fried rice, and so on. It is understaffed so please look into that. Overall it was nice.

I went to The Co. with my 2 friends yesterday. First impression : the interior
Second impression : the food
Last impression : the taste

I was a little worried at first by seeing one negative review here but went anyway. And its worthful.

We ordered Bok Choi wrapped chicken dumplings for starters. Man that was yummy with that sweet-n-sour sauce. 

Then we ordered a Veg Vento which includes 2 pairs of Crab Maki, 1 pair of Salmon Maki, 1 pair of Tuna Niggiri. I always have wanted to taste Salmon & Tuna & Crab. And finally had it.

Lastly we ordered a Nasi Goreng with Firecracker Chicken. This dish was a hell of a dish. We so much loved it that we want to try again sometime.

Last but not least, the servers(waiters) are very  informative and friendly. Also the cooking prep time was also reasonable. And the bill too.

Overall, a 5 star recommendation for those who want to try Japanese food.

Having been planning to visit this place for a really long time.. N finally was able to do it today.. We order bok choi wrapped chicken dumplings... tampura prawn... seafood bento.. thai pad noodles and firecracker mushrooms along with limesoda and virgin mohito... Everything was worth trying... But we gave 4 rating due to the portion size and that the limesoda was not despite our complaining... Oh yeah one thing I really liked the welcoming attitude and hospitality of the person who served us...

I had been longing to visit this place fr a long time but due to exams I just couldn't drop in but finally the wait was over and it was an amazing experience just like i had been expecting it to be.
So,today I visited The Co. with a friend of mine fr lunch.we ordered
1.bok choi wrapped chicken dumplings.
2.steamed fish in chilli oil.
3.non veg fried rice
4.firecracker chicken.
Each of the item were delicious.
The staffs were very cordial.
Ambience was good.
Pricing is normal.
Overall a fulfilling gastronomic experience.
Hope to be back here again.
And I would request all of you who haven't eaten here yet to drop in soon.
The hotel where the restaurant houses is little difficult to find but its surely one of the hidden gems in Kolkata presently!

With a fuss free decor and comfortable seating the Co is probably the only restaurant in Kolkata that offers varied Japanese and other pan Asian delicacies at an extremely reasonable price.¬†¬†The place was virtually empty (it was a hot summer noon) and that perhaps was the reason why the service tended to be slow : they were all setting up. The mocktail that we ordered was not available, so we ordered another one. It turned out that too wasn't available and they gave us a different one altogether albeit complimentary, which was a nice gesture and shadowed the shortcomings.¬†¬†
1. Bok Choy wrapped chicken dumplings - visually appealing but was not up to the mark taste wise. I like my dumpling meat softer and the sauce did not complement the dish at all.¬†2. Firecracker Chicken : Pretty standard, colorful dish.¬†3. Prawns in lime juice : This one was cooked to perfection. Very simple with elegant flavors : a must have.¬†4. Wasabi ice cream : They make their own wasabi and the ice cream just blew my away. I was a bit skeptical at first as wasabi tends to overpower anything else but the blend here was done expertly.¬†¬†Overall, it was a very satisfying experience. Despite a few gaffes regarding the drink, the person serving us was extremely attentive and helpful. Would really like to see them expand their menu.

The place has a mediocre ambience. The food was so-so. Being a sushi lover, I was expecting alot... But honestly the sushi did not feel freshly made...felt somewhat like bento food; basically the texture felt wrong...the sushis did not feel freshly made or the sauces were not placed in right proportions. There goes my sushi experience. Adding to this we also ordered Pad Thai Noodles and Chicken Satay...they weren't up to the standard as well. Overall a very mediocre experience. Wouldn't recommend sushi here because sushi is made of raw ingredients so lack of freshness is a big issue for sushi platters. Needs to improve.

Okay, a pocket-friendly place for authentic Japanese, right in the heart of Kolkata! I went there for something new! We ordered chicken Satay and Chicken sushi(with a fancy name which I cant recall).Both these dishes were kinda weird, Maybe to a tongue that is accustomed to only Indian, Chinese, Italian, Continental and other mainstream cuisines. The mocktails arequite nice. The service is good as well. On the whole, if you are a food adventurer, you could have a quick visit to this place!

The restaurant is located on Md. Ishaque Road near Park Street. The ambience is very nice and the staffs were very courteous, helping us everytime we wanted to distribute the food amongst ourselves. Now coming to the food. We ordered Nasi Goreng and Fire cracker chicken. Both were very tasty though Nasi Goreng is highly recommended to all who want to try an alternative to regular fried rice. Overall, quite a pleasant experience.

The Co. is really easy to locate, situated in Kyd street-the lane in between the Indian museum and Park Street. Their menu may not have a lot of variety but the quality of food is top-notch. On the waiter's recommendation, we ordered bok choi wrapped chicken dumplings- traditional dumplings wrapped in a leaf which tasted heavenly. Among the various choices for sushi, we opted for chicken teriyaki rolls. It was our first taste of sushi and we were mighty impressed. For mains, we had nasi goreng rice, the traditional Indonesian fried rice with firecracker chicken, both were quite delicious. It was followed by Khow Suey- we were given an assortment of ingredients, plain noodles, fried onions, shredded chicken, burnt garlic, chips, chilli, lemon and a coconut flavoured soup to prepare our very own chowmein (we must have done a pretty great job, because we couldn't resist second and even third helpings)! Our meal ended with black sesame seed ice cream and strawberry compote with vanilla icecream. While the latter was conventionally tasty, we were pleasantly surprised by the unique yet delectable flavour of black sesame seeds blended with ice cream. Service is excellent here, portions more than adequate and the prices cannot be more pocket friendly! Hope to visit again soon. Keep up the good work, team!

Calcutta is full of restaurants serving Chinese and Thai. But when it comes to Japanese or Korean, then very few restaurants come up in the list, with a very high pocket pinch. So I was looking for a place which serves Japanese and Korean without making a hole in the pocket and thus, The Co. came into the city. Situated in the ground floor of De Empressa Hotel, Park Street, this restaurant has earned much fame in a short period of time for the amazing dishes they serve, which are almost available nowhere in the city and that too at affordable rates. For this reason, The Co. was in my wishlist for long but I was unable to visit it coz of my busy schedule and lack of company. But then what made me really excited was an invitation for a food tasting session at this place for the occasion of their new menu launch.

Can't complain, this place has left a lasting impression. Small, well-lit and nicely decorated, The Co. needs to spread the word a little more as I was surprised to find that ours was the only occupied table. Furthermore, I've noticed that the Zomato ratings have taken a slight dip off late‚Ä¶ they definitely need to be more consistent.

Anyway, coming to the real deal‚Ä¶ Bok Choi wrapped chicken dumplings, Nasi Goreng and the Firecracker chicken stole the show (just as previous reviewers have mentioned). The special mocktail, Lemongrass Cooler, was the best I ever had. The special desserts, Basil infused panacotta and Crepes with vanilla icecream were also impressive. Though the panacotta tasted strange at first, the taste buds soon got a hang of it. And the other one was simply wow!

What intrigued me about The Co. a couple of months back was their sushi spread. I've had sushi before, and the Seafood Bento didn't disappoint (although the wasabi lacked the familiar punch).

Last but not the least, this place has some of the most courteous staff. You're sure to feel special once you're seated.

The Co. is the small in house restaurant of the business hotel De Empressa on Kyd Street, serving some of the best mouth watering South East Asian delicacies. Their sushi & California rolls are inarguably the best you can get on a budget in Kolkata. I had been to the place first time about three months back, even before they had formally opened to try out the menu. Recently they invited group PanchPhoron over to try out the special menu, & I am happy to share a short review of the same.

Since the d√©cor & ambience was described in detail in the first post, I won't get into that. But it suffices to say they have built a cozy restaurant with classy elements. Also notable is the choice of music played over the stereo. The only notable change on the table was inclusion of disposable chopsticks in the box of pencil & straws, surely adds to the charm.
Coming to the special menu, we tried the following items:

Mocktails:
During the initial days, the menu was devoid of any drinks at all, though we were served some virgin & lemongrass mojitos, those failed to impress. This time around they have included seven drinks to go with the food.

Pinky Dinky:
A balanced combination of Guava & Orange juice served in a salt rimmed martini glass, with a orange wedge as the garnish. The drink looked welcoming; however the whole orange-ey thing was deceiving as the lemony kick was missing. Wish they make it a bit tangier in taste.

Tango Mango:
Fresh mango pulp blended smooth with milk & served with ice cream in a small bottle. Interestingly the mango milk shake & the vanilla ice cream weren't mixed, rather left unstirred inside the bottle, giving it a unique appearance. As far as the taste is concerned, it was too good. Maybe the best drink on the menu, surely one can order it without hesitation.

Ice Tea:
Nothing fancy here, this was served in a regular glass tumbler with ice cubes. A hint of lemon here, a bit of fragrant tea there, and this one is an all time favourite summer cooler for me. & at 80 Rs this one's a steal deal to get in a good restaurant.

Other mocktails on offer I didn't try:
Fresh Lime Soda / Lemongrass Cooler / Dracula's Fav / Virgin Mojito

Mains:

Bibimbap:
This one is a signature Korean Dish, literally meaning 'mixed rice'. However unlike regular Indian or Chinese mixed rice dishes, here the cooked ingredients are left unmixed, it's up to the diner, how they wish to consume the mix. The dish was served in a bowl, where cooked chicken along with tossed/fried vegetables like julienned zucchini & bell peppers, sliced mushrooms, diced Bok Choy & bean sprouts & a sunny side up egg sat on a bed of cooked sushi rice. Last time their Khow Suey impressed me, this time it was Bibimbap. The whole thing when mixed up had an amazing hotchpotch of flavours, colours & texture. Listed at no. 40 on the World's 50 most delicious foods list by CNN Travel (2011) I could tell why it's so! Surely a must try dish.

Balls of Fire (Mushroom / Chicken):
As the name suggests, minced ingredients mixed with Szechuan sauce, shaped into a ball, dusted in breadcrumbs & deep fried. I didn't get to try the chicken variant; the mushroom version was really tasty. However it felt a bit chewy, they promised to look after that before they formally introduce it to the regular menu. Also the spice level was quite moderate, don't expect fiery balls here.

Prawns in Lime Juice:
Medium sized tiger Prawns served with pickled zucchini. The prawns are tossed in lime juice to give the tangy taste to it. The Zucchini are more of a garnishing. Never knew that prawns tossed in only one ingredient could taste so delicious. Hats off to the chef for preparing this simple yet mouthwatering dish!

Grilled Salmon with Teriyaki Sauce:
A bit of surprise here, the fish fillets are cooked with the skin on. However if you are not a big fan of the skin, do ask them to cook it without the skin. The fish is cooked delicately, hence is absolutely soft & juicy, imbibing the flavour of mildly sweet teriyaki sauce. The fillets sit on a bed of flat noodles, which are a delight to have with the fish.

Scallops with Horseradish Cream:
The star of the evening was this last main course to be served. What they don't tell you on the menu, that this dish also contains caviar & wasabee paste. To say the truth this was the first time I was having scallops. I have had small fresh water snails before (thanks to spending my vacations as a kid in my ancestral village in Midnapore). However this was my first time with fresh water clams. The Ceviche of scallops was served with basil oil & seaweed paper infused butter. The horseradish cream serving as the base, a spoonful of Salmon Roe (fully ripe orange coloured eggs of Salmon) is place on top of a pinch of wasabee paste. I can't really recall the taste of the individual ingredients. However the lightly torched scallops, the caviar & the cream mixed with the pungent wasabee made the whole dish seriously outstanding. This is the costliest item on the menu, also the quantity quite small, however if you have that penchant for trying something unique, this one is a must try.

Desserts:

Basil infused Panacotta:
A renowned Italian dessert made of sweetened cream thickened with gelatin, this one was infused with basil leaves. Contrary to other restaurants where basil oil is blended with the cream, the infusion of basil leaves give this a subtle aroma & flavour, devoid of the bitterness.

Crepes with Vanilla Ice Cream:
A simple dessert where ice cream scoops are used as the filling for the soft crepes. Highly enjoyable delicious item to end your meal with.

Ice Cream ( Black Sesame / Wasabee )
Both are signature flavours made in house at the restaurant. The Black Sesame has a unique crunch to it, while the Wasabee flavoured one is for the more adventurous diners. Although the quantity of wasabee is kept low, very few can enjoy a pungent tasting ice cream as a dessert. However the taste being unique, I enjoyed having both.

It's good to see how Wok Anthems has evolved from former stall selling food in Bento boxes to a medium sized restaurant. It's great that they are experimenting with their foods, the special menu being a welcome addition to their already much appreciated diverse menu. I enjoyed having some wonderful dishes, in fact this visit turned out to be better than the previous one. Hopefully they will continue to evolve at this fast pace & win more hearts with the great food they cook. A shoutout to the prompt & courteous service also, which is being handled by new yet competent staffs.
Looking forward to my next visit to The Co. By Wok Anthems.
Till then
Happy Eating,
Cheers!

Compact cozy restaurant, with good ambiance, hygienic n soothing music helps one to be comfortable n be one with self. Menu simple yet at its best in platter. Every dish we ordered tasted different from the other but with great taste n everyone better than the previous. Their Sushi was completely amazing. People are humble at ur disposal. Explained every dish properly with a smile. Helped in understanding the way to have the dishes. One can visit the place with family friends n self to spoil your pallets with great taste of the dishes served along with the display of the same. 
Had a great time n ohh... don't miss the Wasabi Ice Cream... can say it's my NeW FaVouRiTe :-)

I was new to Japanese cuisine and so decided to give it a go. The first thing that comes in mind while thinking about Japanese food is sushi.  While searching zomato to have sushi I came across this place. Its only about 5mins walk from Park street crossing. Its a bit hard to find as there are no signboards of the restaurant. You need to find De Empressa hotel and the restaurant is just inside the hotel. When we got there it was empty. We were welcomed and were seated. The place is well decorated and properly lit. It is a very small place with maybe a sitting arrangement for about 30 people. The decor was quite interesting with beautiful pictures and book shelves on the  wall.  We asked the waiter's advice while ordering sushi as we were first timers.  He adviced to try out chicken teriyaki.  It was nice and soft with chicken filling in the centre,a little bland for me but maybe that is how sushi is supposed to taste. Then we ordered Bok Choi wrapped chicken dumplings. I must say these were  delicious. This was the best chicken dumpling I ever had. It was just so good.  In main course we ordered Pad Thai and Firecracker chicken.Pad Thai was really good. It was not the regular noodles that we are used to in having but a bit something different. But for me Firecracker chicken was about average. Wanted to try Nasi Goreng too but by that time we were full. 
It was quite a unique experience.  Most say sushi tastes bad but I kind of liked it.  Maybe next time will try salmon maki. The staff were  very decent and the service was real quick so a thumbs up for that.

That was a sultry day, after much maneuvering we reached Hotel Dee Empressa. It's about 2mins walk from Mirza Galib Street through Kyd Street which was definitely a bit tricky to find! But, you know Google Maps is always there to help! :P
The very first thing that attracted me was the subtle yet quirky decor, and the next thing has to be friendly waiters.
But. The food.
We were a bit skeptical about trying sushi, but the waiter made us decide otherwise. So we ordered Chicken Teriyaki Rolls which he suggested, and frankly I've never tasted anything like that before. The mushy rice, the chicken, ginger, wasabi and that dipping sauce was really new for our Bengali palate!
Then came the Bok Choy wrapped Chicken dumplings with another amazing sauce, which adds the much required twist to it, I think. Though my boyfriend found it quite okay-ish. :3
The Khow Suey came next and frankly it tasted totally bland. And the amount wasn't enough either - be it the chicken or the noodles. There was a hell lot of curry pata in the soup, which is not at all the way it should be! Though the presentation was gorgeous!
I really believe Pad Thai or Nasi Goreng would have been a much better choice for us. :3
We also ordered the Firecracker Chicken because I read some amazing comments about it.
BUT you so should never order it with Khow Suey. It will definitely ruin the tastes of both the dishes!
So, yeah, that's a warning there. :3
But overall that was a nice experience, more so because we finally learnt to use chopsticks!! So, yayy !! :D

The Co. by Wok Anthems.. a nice place indeed! We two had already set some good expectations from this place. Truly satisfying! Starting from the decor to the limited menu items along with the courteous staff- a nice combo!
Coming to food, ordered
Bok choi wrapped chicken dumplings- truly fulfilling the taste buds, presentation was nice.
Panggang- the signature showstopper dish. Literally it melted in mouth. Tangy nd Delicious!
Chicken teriyaki sushi rolls- my first sushi day, though not to my likings. The wasabe was nice,but that sauce smells so bad! May be I'm not a sushi person.

Narsi goreng- with a egg on top, nice flavour of that indonesian rice. Cooked nd presented nicely.
Fire cracker chicken- a twist from that regular chilli chicken. Tasted good with narsi goreng.

We were not able to finish all these, had to pack. The staffs were really helpful, helped us to choose the sushi nd dumpling.

Loved their decor. The stack of culinary books interested us to go through one of those. The table mat had one detachable portion to scribble or to give some suggestions as well.
Definitely a recommended place for everyone!

This recently visited place, though a bit difficult to find, would definitely meet the appetite once tried at. The short but crisp menu ranges from the common momos and noodles to the not-so-common option of sushis. We'd tried the Crispy fried spicy chicken to nibble on followed by Firecracker chicken - yes, it was indeed a bombardment of goodness in the mouth and Nasi Goreng - much insisted upon by one of the staffs and was definitely worth it. Overall, although not entirely pocket-friendly, it's a place that can be visited and revisited.

Only restuarent where I and my small group of friends spent almost the whole of evening chatting and trying each menu options!!!! Can you believe that.
Though the food ranging from sushi s to dumplings everything tasted average to good (so this is a generalized review rather than going in depth, frankly as I cannot not recommend a particular dish) but their ambience was top notch and staff equally courteous.
So Kudos to them.

In terms of restuarent get up it was pretty main stream like one sees at the Park Street area.

Also there s ample parking space just outside the restuarent, hence that won't be a problem.

But coming back to the main focus point FOOD, hopefully the next time I visit I would have the chance to get my taste buds a more satisfying experience!!!!

Its been long since i wanted to visit this place seeing it enlisted in the great chinese collection and going through the reviews of other foodies , my visit was about 3 weeks ago , it began with a nice start and then onwards the graph rapidly dropped down to an utter dissapointment.
The entrace of the hotel is not really very decorative , however the restaurant interiors are vibrant in bright shades of yellow and red. The one thing we noticed is that the place is highly understaffed. After repeated request we placed the order as follows..

#Chicken tom yum soup ( on waiters strong recommendation inspite of our preferring the sweet corn soup , two by four ) this was brought almost after 20 minutes of wait . The soup was watery and the chicken pieces were too few to count. However passable.

#chicken satay .
#bok choi wrapped chicken dumpling
This again took another 10mins after we finished our soups. The starters tasted nice but quantity was super low comparing it with the relatively lower pricing.

#chicken phad thai noodles
#nasi goreng
#steamed fish with chilli oil
#firecracker chicken.

The mains took another 45 mins to be served and after several enquiries. The nasi goreng and firecracker chicken though tad oily tasted nice. The fish didnot match the cuisine and wasnot cooked throughly, some portions were saltless others being oversalty , some portions were even undercooked . But what dissapointed us the most was the pad thai. The sauce with which the noodles had been tossed had a bad stink , and all four of us on concluding there has to be some problem with the dish we reported it to the staff. He was not much bothered and said thats how it was supposed to be. Later he asked he can replace the dish so opted for chicken hakka noddles. But what came after another 20 mins was a greater shock... small portion of noodles without any chicken swimming in pool of oil. Any street chowmein in 20 bucks is better than this. However left that half eaten and asked lemon cheesecake for desserts. Tha waited again recommended for some chocolate pie which was house special that day. After another 10 mins he came and informed us no dessert will be available that day.

So dont get any illusion of this place being an affordable eatery , the service sucks , the cook spoils ur evening , quantities are quite less for the pricing.
AVOID.

After seeing all the hypes about, this place was in my wishlist from much time. And finally today got the chance to have the experience.
Firstly, locating this place will be easy, if u are able to find out 'De Empresa Hotel'.
It is situated just at the ground floor of the hotel. Follow Kyd Street it will take u there.
Coming to the food, it was my first time trying pan asia cuisine, & to my utter surprise the delicacies were superb.
Coming to the ambience, its an urban style restaurant with posters in the walls overall decent. Now heading to the food We had:
1. Salmon Maki- authentic salmon fish wrapped sushi, served with wasabi, garlic & soya sauce.
2. Chicken Satay- grilled chicken properly marinated & skewed. (Though to me it tasted lil bitter don't know why)
3. Panggang- fully marinated fish with spices wrapped in banana leave and steamed. THIS DISH TOOK AWAY THE SHOW. (A must try dish, strongly recommended)
4. Nasi Goreng- a rice of thick grains cooked with eggs and chicken (non-veg)
5. Firecracker Chicken- a tangy flavoured chicken with bell peppers and onions
6. Lemon Cheesecake- as the name suggest, though the taste was okayish.
Pocket pinch is approx 900INR for two (don't trust zomato for this)
P.S. Must try the firecracker chicken and panggang.

The Co. by Wok Anthems.. a nice place indeed! We two had already set some good expectations from this place. Truly satisfying! Starting from the decor to the limited menu items along with the courteous staff- a nice combo!
Coming to food, ordered
Bok choi wrapped chicken dumplings- truly fulfilling the taste buds, presentation was nice.
Panggang- the signature showstopper dish. Literally it melted in mouth. Tangy nd Delicious!
Chicken teriyaki sushi rolls- my first sushi day, though not to my likings. The wasabe was nice,but that sauce smells so bad! May be I'm not a sushi person.

Narsi goreng- with a egg on top, nice flavour of that indonesian rice. Cooked nd presented nicely.

I had been wanting to check out this place ever since I read the rave reviews on Zomato. Finally one sultry afternoon, me and G, Google-mapped it here.. The exterior of the Dee Empressa hotel itself wasnt that impressive but ambience inside the resto was urban chique. After being seated, the 1st thing that caught my attention were the table-mats. The black coloured mat-cum-menu with a detachable space for jotting down menu or random doodling ---- boy, was I impressed ! The table stand was well stocked with pencils and needless to say, I ended up sketching. There was also a rather quirky wallpaper adorning the wall behind my table..overall, a thumbs up from me...
Coming to the food...we started off with the Tom Yum soup which was rather ordinary. Next we tried Steamed fish in Chilli Oil which was totally new to my palate...really liked it ! Next up was Nasi Goreng rice with Honey Chicken... The gravy of the chicken blew me away...S.L.U.R.P. the quantity of rice was a bit less i felt...and ravenous as we were, we ordered a Pad Thai Noodles.. it was spicy but tasty... When time came for sweet endings, we were informed that none of the delectable desserta on the menu were available... I was rather looking forward to the lemon cheesecake and Strawberry compote dessert, so the meal ended on a slight disappointing note.. They advised us to go for a chocolate pastry instead which was nithing extraordinary.
Overall, food and service is good for such a new place.. I will definitely be going back for the desserts again..keep it up !!

I just love the decor, some how in its simplicity it packs a great ambience and effect. It feels fresh and bright.

The menu is simple, neat, and its small, but you won't really be asking for too much more, if anything you'll try more than you can eat. 

The food is well executed, great presentation and good taste, the price is the cherry on top.
Funny how I don't see more people going there. Try it out. 

And they've managed to get some sushi in a reasonable price band, which gets a double thumbs up from me, cause you can't go to zen every time you want sushi, not that I'm comparing it to zen, but it satisfies the craving.

Well, the best place to drop in when u really wanna get the perfect taste of pan-asian cuisine... located in a very convenient position in park street. I and a friend of mine decided to go in here to try out some sushis... the most notable thing about this place was their classy interior with really friendly and helpful staffs... now coming to food.. the foods were pocket friendly, fresh, well cooked and delicious.. first we ordered the chicken teriyaki rolls.. it was properly cooked and tasted great.. then we went for the pad thai .. the quality was amazing and really tasty.. the quantity was more than sufficient for both of us... along with the pad thai we took the firecracker chicken. The chicken was really tasty but i didnt like the gravy.. it was way to liquid and tasted of soya sauce too much... other than that.. the place was really amazing with good food and good staffs.. i would definitely recommend these dishes. But would tell you  to go for some other chicken preparations but not the fire cracker one... really looking forward to get my hands into all of their sushi dishes...üòé

Pad Thai and Firecracker Chicken in the main course is good. However, the Nongse Goreng was sticky rice, sweet and ordinary. Ambience is good. There's nothing extraordinary or uncommon in their menu

The Co. By Wok Anthems. 
Located at park street  , a good place to try japanese cuisine. 
Ambience is very nice. You will find chop sticks on the table , which is pretty interesting. 
Pretty well decorated. Book shelves having quite a variety of books. 

Food: ordered the following.
1.Bok choi wrapped chicken dumplings
2.Nasi goreng
3. panggang
4. firecracker chicken
5. Teriyaki rolls

I dont know why i did not like the sushi (teriyaki rolls) that much though had a huge expectation for that. Maybe it tasted like that only. 

Bok choi dumplings were good

The fire cracker chicken and nasi goreng together tasted great.

Only the pang gang was outstanding. The fish was so nicely cooked that it literally melted in the mouth.

Overall it was a good experience.

It's not easy to locate if you are new to this area. My friend and I spent a good half an hour walking in that area trying to locate the restaurant. Lastly we decided to call them and ask for the exact direction. Located at kyd street in de empressa hotel. A small restaurant with simple decor. friendly & courteous service. Loved the unique concept of their menu card .. Ordered crab maki, pad thai and firecracker mushrooms!! This was my first attempt to sushi..didn't want to be too adventurous..so ordered crab..tasted good..but the rice was mushy...I don't know if that's the way it should be..

Pad thai was YUMM!!! ¬†the mushroom dish was spicy but delicious ¬†!! Thought of ordering khow suey too but by the time I finished my noodles ..sadly I had no room left in my tummy....Generous portion!!!

And for dessert..we chose the dessert of the day..it was a chocolate dessert with mango jelly..forgot the name :(

Overall I had a good dining experience..planning to go back soon with my family to try their sushis !!!

Japanese. Haven't acquired a taste for this cuisine yet. But still, a try shouldn't hurt and hence I land up here.
The small yet well decorated restaurant does capture your attention once you enter it. Well laid out tables and well lit with some books, etc gives it a nice casual dining feel. The waiters were nice but there seemed to be an ongoing tiff at the restaurant among the staff and they were yelling at each other for as long as i can remember. That was a big distraction.
Now as for the food we had ordered Salmon Maki, Stir Fried Noodles, Firecracker Chicken and Lemon Cheesecake. Sushi was first for me and I cannot really say if it was nice or not but I am yet to like it enough. Now the stir fried noodles was mediocre and one can have better at some places at esplanade street shops. The firecracker chicken was again, moderate. The disappointment was the lemon cheesecake.
No Japanese for sometime now for me. Yet one should give this place a try!

One of the best restaurants in Kolkata right now. I'm sure its gonna break the news headlines pretty soon. Located at a rather remote setting, the ambience and food quality is top notch here. The service is excellent as well. Pocket pinch is pretty reasonable and if you are looking to visit this place then do not miss out on pad thai and firecracker chicken. :)

The Co. is a relatively small restaurant in the  hotel Dee Empress with good ambience and  interesting interiors. The first thing that caught my eye was a huge panel on the wall made of prints of covers of 20th century magazines..... as well as little shelves on the walls with books, fiction and non-fiction, that patrons can go through while waiting for the food to arrive. We started with veg tempura, chicken satay and chicken dumplings which were all very tasty, each accompanied by different yummy sauces. The main course of mixed szechuan noodles, firecracker chicken and nasi goreng were equally good, served by a very attentive staff. We finished off with a cheesecake served with a chunky mango marmalade which was simply delicious. The owner, Mr Bardhan, was kind enough to help us choose our dishes and later came to see whether all was to our liking. The quantity and quality of good served was good, and the staff were helpful in seeing that we didn't over-order for our family of 4.

The co by wok anthems is definitely a must visit if you're up for some high quality oriental food. The d√©cor is very well done. We first ordered the sushi... beautifully presented and tasted even better!!!. We also tried the bok choy dumplings and the steamed fish in chilli oil, both dishes were cooked to perfection. My favourite however  was their version of the popular khow suey, for sure one of the best iv had till date.
Can't wait to come back and try out the rest of the menu!!

They are the specialists when it comes to experimental Asian cuisine. If you are looking for street-food kind of 'chinese', then you better not try here. The decor is something very welcoming. It immediately makes you feel warm and of course cozy. Do try the refurbished 'Nasi Goreng'. It's their speciality.

Just got back from lunch at this highly recommended on zomato place....extremely disappointing experience with everything that we ordered that  is the nasi goreng ,phad thai  noodles, tom yum soup,firecracker chicken much below expected standards ..the chicken was so hard that you could not break it with a fork even the fresh lime soda had no fizz...have been to a number of places that were recommended on zomato but have never had such an experience.. Wonder how this place managed to get  such a rating

Took the family out to dinner. Since its part of a hotel the people staying there are given preference which is understandable so don't expect the seat of your choosing.
On the food front the quality is really good. Well served. Items are sufficient not what you would call a lavish menu. But If its Asian food you are craving for then you must give this place a visit.. 
And if the staff is more co-operative and attentive during your visit you might have a great experience..

Visited this place last night since I had been craving for sushi for quite some time. The place is not very big but is well spaced. really liked the wallpapers. I was planning to order a host of items but did not; we were only two. So we ended up ordering California Rolls, Firecracker Chicken & Pad Thai Noodles.
The sushi was really good. Since I have had sushi before I could not help but compare it to the ones I have had earlier. Must say, it is pretty good actually. Would definitely go for it again. Firecracker Chicken & Pad Thai Noodles were slightly spicy for my taste but the flavours really came across despite the heat. Also, the portions served were generous and can easily be shared by two people.Service was good, the waiters were polite and the one taking our order also enquired whether we are fine with peanuts in our noodles (many people are allergic to peanuts, you see). Browny points there! Overall, the experience was great and I would certainly like to revisit it. :)P.S. Sorry, did not take any pictures of the food. Just dived straight into it!

Nestling away in a quiet road just off the lights and traffic of Park Street is Hotel Dee Empresa. Its old world looks cloak its pearl: The Co. Food here is more than a meal served at a restaurant. As we settled in and ordered our food, my eyes wandered and settled on interesting visuals on a wall and I found the music soothing. 

A well designed menu gave us a chance to experience food from across South East Asia. There were plenty of options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians and the focus on Asian food is not limiting at all. This is a new take on dining: food here is fashioned rather than simply cooked and priced well.  

I found it refreshing to be at a restaurant with an ambience where people laughed gaily, had fun conversations and ate food which made them feel happy. Stop by The Co if you want to soak in the joys of food in Calcutta, time too likes change.

Went to The co this evening . Food was really good and very reasonable. We were a large group to we nearly ordered everything off the menu!! . I would specially recommend the prawn tempura, chicken satay with peanut sauce  and the green curry. The deconstructed Lemon cheese cake was a happy surprise ! All in all we had a great experience!

We visited this place for lunch last week. After a day at the Indian Museum the two of us decided to have a light lunch comprising of one our favourite cuisines: Japanese. 

Location: Dee Empress Hotel.We walked straight inside Sudder Street, took a right after Fairlawn Hotel and walked straight for 200 metres before reaching our destination, right on the main road

Food: We ordered a host of items, right from the Crab Maki, California Roll, Prawn Nigiri, Salmon Maki to the seafood Bento and Khow Suey. The menu seemed limited (which I loved) and seemed like a far cry from the regular Indianised Chinese menu with the usual boring Chilli Chicken and Fried Rice: full marks for that! Having heard amazing things about this place, I couldn't wait to try out their fare especially because no other place offers Sushi at such affordable rates.  However, when the food arrived and we took the first bite, we were a little disappointed. The Salmon Maki packed in a punch with fresh, delectable fish, but the others were good for the price, but pretty average taste wise. Now coming to the accompaniments, the Gari (pickled ginger) was nice and zesty, but the Wasabee could have been better: it tasted like it had been defrosted just 10-15 min back, lacked freshness. The California Roll was probably the worst of the lot and just had no flavours whatsoever. I've had the good fortune of trying Sushi in India and abroad and was expecting a 5/5 on the quality front, esp since we are talking about Calcutta here, the queen of good food. But these guys can up their game even further to become a legend of sorts to initiate the average Calcuttan to Sushi. 
The Khow Suey just wasn't good enough: although the condiments were fine (fries garlic, chilli flakes, lemon, spring onion, coriander, peanuts) but where was the boiled egg? And I didn't quite understand why was regular noodle served with the gravy instead of the authentic Burmese noodles. Also, no self respecting khowsuey has curry patta in the coconut broth, that was such a downer.
Overall, this place holds great promise but needs to challenge itself in terms of quality and authenticity since they are doing something in a city's cuisine map still dominated by Biryani and Fried Rice. A meal for two here will cost around 1200 INR (pretty reasonable for all that we ate) and I would love to revisit, hoping to have a better culinary experience this time.

YOU ARE GONNA MISS SOMETHING IF YOU DON'T READ TILL THE END

Cradled in the womb of Hotel Dee Empressa, lies one of the Hidden Gems of the city....

From Linkin Park in the background to the pure friendly smiles of the waiters... what an evening in the Pan-Asian restaurant!!!

And now comes the FOOOOODDD!!!!!! I could't help sharing details of the endeavouring dishes we experienced today.....

In the starters, the juicy and hot Chicken Satay with the tongue twisting Peanut Sauce made us go bonkers..

Next, the Bok-Choi wrapped Chicken Dumplings came in the traditional chinese box along with the Wok-Special Honey Chilli Sauce which really made us ask : "CAN WE HAVE MORE OF THAT SAUCE, PLEASE?"

Now, for the SUSHI-VIRGINS like us, it was as if our unstimulated taste buds got a shock for the first time in life.... Crab Maki, California Rolls & Salmon Nigiri... Each of them kicked our throat as if several things pouring in the mouth at once....

In the main course, Classy Burmese Pad Thai was average but the best of the day : "Steamed Fish With Chilli Oil" just led us to a different dimension itself.... Its hits you suddenly as you have the first bite and the strong pungent yet endeavouring smell of the Chillies with the coriander makes you literally crave for more.....

Lastly, the Mango Cheesecake ... An exclusively new addition to their menu, just completed our Food-Innings with a Six-Out-Of-The-Park....

NOW COMES THE ULTIMATE SURPRISE ::

And we quote : "Sir, as we are getting late with the dumplings, this Crispy Chilli babycorn is a Complementary for you from us"

I've never ever come across such courtesy... EVER...

Wanna come here again and again...

A MUST MUST try for the Foodies of the city...

Tried my first sushi here. The sushi is good and the owner was sweet enough to explain the various types on the menu. However, the noodles were below average and the dessert was bad. So have mixed feelings about this place. The owner apologized for the dessert gaffe and admitted that they need to work on their dessert menu. 

Would recommend the sushi.

Ambience: The Yellow and the Red decor got my vote :)
Loved the Wallpaper.. The tiny paintings beside the tables added a nice touch to the place.

Service: The waiters were friendly and prompt and they even suggested us dishes.

Food: My first time I had sushi.. It was not really my type of food; nevertheless; my friends really liked it!
Had Salmon Maki and Crab Maki.

Loved loved loved the Chicken dumplings so much that I ordered another plate!! :D
For our main course we ordered Shezchuan rice and Burnt Garlic Corinder rice; along with Firecracker Chicken and Honey Chicken.

If you wanna eat here; do have Firecracker Chicken and the Chicken dumplings :D

Happened to stumble across their good rating on Zomato, following which I decided to try it out. The Co. may be a wee bit hard to locate (especially for first timers), but once you do, you are in for a treat!¬†

They serve delectable platters of the orient, and quite reasonably priced that too.. What more could a foodie want? :P The interiors are simple and tidy, their hospitality especially good, and their food.. amazing!¬†

The Tom Yum soup was at it's lemongrassy best. The Bok Choi wrapped dumplings, were sublime. Must try here. We had also been offered the Chicken Satay as a complimentary dish, due to some glitches they had at that time, which I thought was really sweet of them.. :)¬†The firecracker chicken was really soft and the dish, quite colorful.
¬†
I was also a Sushi-virgin before Woks happened.. tried out their Chicken Teriyaki Rolls.. They are mouthwatering to say the least! I am definitely coming back to try some more of their Sushi varieties.¬†

This place is a great find for Pan-Asian cuisine lovers, and all generic foodies. I'm giving a 4.5, because they're great but there is always scope for improvement!

ambiance is good, a bit interior from the main road.
if you exit at gate -2 from park street metro station it will be easier from there.
we ordered schezwan noodles and firecracker chicken.¬†

the staff guided us to have that combination, and it was delicious !

felt a bit overpriced according to the quantity, but to me it can be compensated by the flavors of the dishes.¬†

will like to visit it again !

I'm gonna keep it very simple, in order of preference :
 1. steamed fish with chilli oil. Excellent bassa, steamed without compromising on moisture. Chilli oil, a li'l low, but can always be overdone by the crushed chilli bits. Overall, standout.
2. Seafood Bento. Good. Prawn nigiri, ( li'l too much sticky rice for my liking, no subtlety) salmon nigiri, (okay) salmon Maki (good) and crab Maki (best of the lot, retested). Overall balance and execution, sophisticated and neat. Excellent start for someone who has never had sushi before.
3. Firecracker mushroom. Biggest letdown where my expectations became my nemesis. Starch-Coated Button mushrooms in a typical tangra-style oriental stir-fry gone horribly wrong. I don't know what is the correct mushroom for such Stir fry (shitake/anything else), but it definitely ain't buttons - it became horribly chewy and rubbery at presentation. Such a shame because we had it after the fish...
Overall, great step one. Chefs, buckle up on the thoughts. Our next venture- Bok Choi dumplings, satays and lemon cheesecake. It better be higher Ooh La la, team! Recommended!

Cradled in the womb of Hotel Dee Empressa, The Co. by Wok Anthems has many a surprises to offer. And I must say beforehand, they are all pleasant surprises. I was invited with a group of foodies, for an evening of food tasting¬†by the owners, Barnik Bardhan and Mridul Chatterjee. They were lovely hosts, and their food selections were simply exquisite. Barnik, moreover helped us in creating the Mom‚Äôs Khow Suey when we struggled, it had an array of ingredients and his concoction was delicious.

Surfing through Zomato i came to know about this place & as i work in the Chowringhee Mansion,Park Street this place wasn't at all hard to find.

We were two n was there for lunch. They have a brief menu which i appreciate (personal view coz i think too many options diverts the mind of the visitors and its hard to choose the dishes).
Well, we opted for 
Salmon Maki Sushi - which was tenderly made with a generous amount of Salmon on it. When compared with the other restaurants, I really appreciate the portion which they provide. 
Bok Choi wrapped Chicken Dumpling -- soft and juicy chicken wrapped with Bok Choi steamed to perfection. But the best part of the dumpling was the condiment which they provide along with it, honey green chilli dip which is just awesome. 
Khow Suey noodles which comes with soup was also delectable.
Last but not the least was the Lemon cheesecake, I choose it coz i love cheesecakes but these people have taken it to a whole new level... it was soooooooo tempting and flavourful. 

Overall I felt everything was wonderful ( food quality, quantity, courteousness if the staff, ambience, pricing)

I would surely recommend it to others as well. 
Give it a try and you shall never regret..(i will be paying my second visit very soon )

thanks team,, keep up !!!

I tried mushroom maki sushi and it was awesome. The stiffness as well as the softness of the sushi was well balanced. The Nasi Goreng rice was an absolute delicacy.¬†The proportion is enough for two people.

Browsing through Swiggy trying to figure out whether to order Indian or Chinese I suddenly came across a restaurant serving Sushi and Pad Thai. I went through the entire menu which looked quite impressive. Couldn't resist and ordered 2 types of Sushis, steamed fish and Pad Thai. Though it was a home delivery the quality of the food was just excellent. The packing was like any foreign take away. I am sure their in house service and quality of the food would be better. Looking forward to visiting the restaurant.

The Co is a small in house restaurant which serves amazing oriental dishes, especially I am crazy about their sushis.

Location : ground floor of Hotel Dee Empressa. This hotel is in Kyd street, the lane beside Indian museum. 

Decor : It is a small restaurant with very simple decor. A buffet table on one end. The wall drawn into abstract graffitis against the white backdrop.

Ambiance :  Good clean and warm ambiance.  the table mats here, you ought to fall in love with. They have the menu printed on them with a perforated side so that you could essentially write down what you want and pass it along to the server.

Staffs : The staff seemed to be on their toes and there seemed to be an air of happiness around. They are hospitable and amicable. I was pleased to meet the owner himself, Mr. Barney Bardhan,he is an amazing person and can weave magic with his wok. The head chef, Mr. Vishal was equally willing to serve. 

Nibblers :
1. Chicken satay - The hard to resist chicken satay served with peanut sauce was amazing. The chicken just was very finely marinated and skewered.

Mains:
1. Firecracker chicken -  The firecracker chicken has the most amazing combination of and sweet and spicy flavors, with a hint of tanginess. However I did not quite feel the softness in the chicken. 

2. Steamed fish with chilli oil -  A reinvention of a Chinese classic. It was prepared with tenderness, the staunch presence of chilli oil and lemon grass took the concept to a whole new level. This one was definitely a Barney special.


Noodles:
1. Pad thai-  pad thai is  thai flat noodles which is made made with soaked dried rice noodles. The dominance of tamarind pulp, fish sauce ,red chili pepper and palm sugar was predominant and was garnished with chopped roasted peanuts. Although I have had better versions elsewhere.

2. Khow suey - this is a burmese delicacy which is probably one of their USP. It  features layers of noodles, a vegetable curry made with coconut milk and an elaborate masala of spices, coconut and cashew nuts, and an elaborate garnish of fried onions, garlic, vaal dal and spring onions. Probably one of the better ones in Kolkata . Cannot be given a miss.


Rice:
1. Nasi goreng- it is the indonesian fried rice and probably this is one of the best rice that I have had. The correct portions of spices along with the right amount of stir fry in the wok resulted into this miraculous affair.


Sushis: 
Possibly they serve sushis you can die for.

1. California rolls-  a sushi roll, containing cucumber, crab meat  and avocado. This was made to a level apart. I just could not stop eating. 

2. Seafood bento - this is however the surprise package. the bento box contain two pieces each of salmon nigiri, prawn nigiri,salmon maki, crab maki. This is the numero uno of the joint. A definitive recommendation.

Value for money : The Co by Wok Anthems  leaves you happy and satisfied. The amazing food at such nominal rates is hard to imagine. 

Overall this is a good place to kick back and enjoy a good meal.  Being within the same area one does not need to travel far to eat here.

It was my first tryst with 'Sushi'. I was way too excited about having my first 'Suuuushi' and this is what drove me to this place.
Well located, a lil far from the hustle and bustle of Parkstreet. It had a very comfortable and quiet ambience, for a Sunday afternoon. The staff was cordial.
Getting back to the 'Sushi', since this was the first one that I tasted, I can't say if other Sushi lovers would like it. It did dissappoint me a little, may be my taste buds aren't meant for it. I ordered 'Seafood Bento' which was a mixed platter of sushi.
A word of caution. Try the green paste offered with the platter at your own risk. Phew.. it gave a shock to my nervous system üò•.
Nevertheless the other dishes that I ordered made up for it. 'Chicken Satya' is a must I would say.
'Khow suey' was light and healtly with a twist. Not the usual noodles that we are used to. You can mix and match and have it.

After reading the reviews at Zomato, I had decided to visit this restaurant and trust me, I didn't regret it. This place may be a bit difficult to find and won't have that appealing look, but after trying the food from this restaurant, you will definitely come back!
Great ambiance, wonderful service and delectable dishes! If you want to experience authentic Chinese food, then this place is a must-visit for you!
The menu may have a limited range of items, but the dishes are absolutely amazing! The quantity is pretty much good and more than enough for two people! The Hot and Sour Non-Veg soup tasted a bit simple, but otherwise the other recipes were awesome!
The prices here are damn reasonable!! Seriously!
And the staff members are simply very warm and welcoming! Be it the owner or the waiters, every one of them had a cordial behavior and a polite approach towards the customers, which really stood out among everything.
Few minor glitches might happen, and that is bound to....but that shouldn't be the hurdle to stop you from visiting this restaurant!
I would definitely recommend everyone to give this place a show up! Please do so!!
P.S.: I am certainly coming back again! Very soon!

"It may have taken a while to get to my mouth, but I've had the best Khow suey until now. Sam,the manager was humble to help me pick the best of The Co. 

Chef Vishal has a very good working environment going on in the kitchen. And not to forget the Bok Choi Chicken Dumplings with sweet chilli sauce. I had to end that meal with Lemon Cheese cake which dropped straight from the heavens onto my plate.

Cheers to The Co. By Wok Anthems for running an establishment as great as the staff.

I wont beat around the bush. This was a marvellous experience. The food, the service, the warm welcome and everything else in between. Go for it. Dont give it a 2nd thought. Good location. When you enter kyd street, keep walking straight , and Hotel De Impressa will be on your left hand side. Coming to the food, we ordered a chicken schezwan rice, stir fried chicken noodles and a chicken cracker. Where do i start from ? Hmmmm.. Dont expect typical chinese food. Theres a touch of south asian style to the food. The chicken rice was so awsome, and so was the quantity. The stir fried chicken noodles was good too. The firecracker chicken was another version of the dried chilli chicken but it had a different touch to it. All in all its worth visiting. The amazing, quirky ambience is an added bonus. And whats better...2 of us had a sumptuous meal within 500 bucks. Couldnt have asked for anything else

Have Been Coming to Dee Empressa Hotel Since last 5 Years. The Hotel has Upped it's Name after the Opening of The Co. by Wok Anthems , Pan Asian which has a Cool and Vibrant Ambiance. The Best Part is the Pan Asian Food ( Burmese Dish Khow Suey ) that Woke my Taste Buds to its Limit. One of the Best Food I ever had in a Long Time. Eagerly waiting to taste the Other Dishes before leaving Kolkata. Hats of to All the Staff which Adds More Value to the Food by their Service with a Big Smile. Keep it Up The Co. by the Anthems. Highly Recommended.

The only thing that surprised me was most people were ordering things which are not on this excellent menu that you see on zomato. Not to say that that is bad food, but this stuff in the menu is just out of the world. 

Good job guys. Be sure to see us again.

The collection of south east asian dishes are the main catch which will attract the Diner most. The restaurant decor and  the ambience is appropriate  with the theme.

Horrible food! Called for home delivery via swiggy. The food was hot (thanks to swiggy's service!), but it tasted like it was made 2 days ago. I spoke to the restaurant manager on the phone and specific requested to make the food less oily. I guess they understood it the other way round. A special request was accepted by them to make the schezwan chicken without frying the chicken. Unfortunately, the chicken was deep fried, that too poorly. The mushrooms tasted like prawn. 
I guess my only suggestion is to order everything you don't want. So that they do the opposite!

I am a very cautious eater when it comes to new cuisines. There's obviously this thing about always going for something new but to be honest I just like pampering my tastebuds with what I already have had and liked. 
Asian cuisine, mainly Chinese has been topping my list of favorite cuisines. However, Asian cuisine has always been altered as per our Indian tastes and spices, our need for everything to be either spicy or absolutely as bland as khichdi. This is where The Co.by Wok Anthems steps in , in order to change my perceptions regarding such altered Asian food offerings. This was my first time with Sushi and Bokchoi dumplings, not to forget I was massively excited about it. I have not been let down and to be fair it is not very difficult to live up to my expectations of 'taste'. As a student, I usually opt for places that aren't too high on ambiance and seating arrangement. Unlike this time, I was up for everything - from the food, the restaurant feels and to expecting exceptional hospitality. Again, it was a difficult task to pick out any flaws with any of that. Very easy to locate, The Co.by Wok Anthems has newer experiences to offer, some like : table mat combination with a brief menu(easy choices basically), cutlery not lined out on your table but placed in separate stands with not just cutlery but even pencils. Now you ask, why pencils? 
Well the table mats had ample space for us to write our reviews down then and there. Uniquely placed idea, I'd say - because as you eat , you jot down what you like and what you don't. My only issue with this place being -- the table I was seated in had a very wobbly table. It was fiddling with my eating pace and interest. Other than that, I am planning another 100+ visits to this place. 
Thank you for the wonderful experience.

P.S.- Kindly look for plating and variety of dishes and not the quality of images. I am still working on that. :)

This is where Zomato comes in handy for anyone with cash and the willingness to spend on good food. I stumbled upon The Co. on Zomato a few days ago while browsing for Pan Asian restaurants. Having read the reviews and consulted my own gut, I put this unique little restaurant by Wok Anthems at the top of my 'To Visit' list.

The Co. by Wok Anthems is fairly easy to locate. Go down Free School Street till you hit M.D. Ishaque Road. Hotel Dee Empressa is on this road and once you've located that, finding the restaurant should be child's play.

Ambience is the one thing I've noticed most restaurants lack. This is partially why The Co. stands out. Nothing beats their ambience! I think we were greeted by every single member of their staff on our way in. Their interior will remind you of The Park in Vizag. Granted the restaurant doesn't have an incredible view to accompany great seating arrangements, it still manages to give high end restaurants a run for their money. Their cutlery and their crockery are top notch! However, the thing that impressed me the most in this segment, was their menu card. There wasn't one. Instead, what they've very ingeniously done is to combine their menu card with their placemats. They've also thoughtfully added a comments section on their placemat -- for anyone not on Zomato but eager to post a review.

On to their food then. I reckon The Co. would give great Sushi restaurants like The Fifth Element and Zen good competition. They're yet to progress onto a full fledged menu, but the items they do dish out, are exceptionally well presented. They combine well and that's something I've come to expect from a good meal. The water they serve is slightly altered with some cucumber and mint, I think. Delicious, nonetheless. The Crab Maki is to die for! Absolutely stunning! I also ordered the Chicken Satay, which although turned out to be a good dish, didn't reek of ingenuity like the others did. Perhaps the peanut sauce which they serve could do with some innovation. The standout starter was the Bok Choi Chicken Dumplings. I've had the same at Yauatcha and The Co. takes the cake. Quite easily the best Bok Choi based dish I've had in a long while. For our mains, we went with something a little less adventurous -- Stir fried noodles and fire cracker chicken. Both of these dishes were good, very good. The noodles were very reminiscent of a sort I had in Singapore a year ago -- very easy on the buds. The chicken however could have done with a little punch. I understand that the firecracker chicken was probably their rendition of the classic Chilli Chicken; they've pulled it off no doubt, but it still leaves a bit to be desired. No desserts -- their quantities are fantastic! The most impressive aspect of their food is their pricing. How on earth a Pan Asian restaurant is surviving on 1000 for 3 is beyond me. But I'm glad they are.

I cannot lay enough emphasis on how good their service was. The waiter who served us was exceptional -- among the friendliest people I've come to know. I only wish I caught his name (he did tell me, but I cannot recollect). I recall it being something like a 'Zafar'.

A couple of pointers:
1. I would've loved to see some Asian drink like the Sake on the menu. It probably would've added some much needed liquid impetus.
2. Considering their menu isn't pages long, I feel they could do with a few additions like Tofu. And if they're feeling adventurous, make a Daikon dish or a Korean Bibimbap.

To conclude, The Co. by Wok Anthems is a fantastic joint! I usually save long, tiring reviews for the better places in Kolkata and this particular restaurants is worth it. Fantastic service and food meets value for money in what I can only describe as pure quality. The Co. is a classy restaurant in all sections -- food, ambience, service, decor. Their manager did come up to us for feedback, and well there was only so little I could say at the time with a mouthful of noodles. This is something I personally feel is a deal sealer -- managers and staff heads showing actual concern for their customers. Top job!

Exceptional service. Fantastic food.
I'll be back soon.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

Different can be very good or very bad, at The Co its surely good.  A wonderful place for dinning. Not expensive and offers such new kinds of dishes you don't want to miss. Located around 5mins walking distance from park street , hunt for the hotel dee empressa. 
Now coming to the food, 
the bok choi wrapped dumplings, now i usually don't prefer veggies, but the chicken wrapped in bok choi (Chinese cabbage) was a hit. 
Next was the steamed fish in chilli oil. One more standout. It looks like any normal steam fish till you put it in your mouth and then there is a burst of wonderful flavours. Should order this. 
 The schezwan noodles (non veg) was great as well. Very tasty and spicy. 
Service : Seemed a bit confused at first but they are very friendly so that was really nice :) thumbs up for that. 
Whats missing? More options in  the menu. Also, i don't enjoy eating main course on relatively small plates. 
Verdict : A must try ! Loved the experience dinning here.

The food though limited in variety is good. And pocket friendly. We tried the chicken satay. Which tasted good except for the lack of peanut flavor which traditional satays are known for. The bakchoi dumplings were something new and definitely yummy. The sushi while smaller in size and not like the regular sushi u get elsewhere is different in a good way. And very very affordable. The nasi goreng rice il confess i m not familiar with the taste of the dish. But i liked what was served. The firecracker chicken was pleasant and had good quantity. The khowsuey was delicious and definitely worth recommending
The low rating is because of the service. The waiters were completely clueless and all over the place. They were bringing out cutlery and putting them in drawers from the kitchen during lunch time. Our waiter served water. Then came back to put coasters under the glasses. Then cAme with cutlery. And had to rearrange it twice for it to be appropriate. There were only one pair of chopsticks between three people. And again they took ages between each dish. And also to get the bill. Please improve and train your staff
N.B the manager was very friendly and helpful.

If you are a Sushi lover then look no further... This is the place to be! Very well prepared and insane value for money! We had ordered a Seafood Bento and Chicken Teriyaki rolls. Both were amazing! Absolutely in love with this place! Too good! Keep it up!

Located below "Hotel Dee Empressa"  at Dr M.D. Ishaque road, one have to take the road on which Mocambo exists and after a 5 mins walk need to take the first left... and from there at a mins walk it will be at the right side... can be distinguished easily...

After entering I found it was very classy... and the ambience was very refreshing... clean and clear, extremely well maintained property... bright light works enhancing the charm very well...

Staffs are well trained... and well mannered too... service was awesome... not a single complaint regarding that...

I just loved the concept of there menu card... it's very unique... the attached scribble portion for giving them feedback is great... there are pencils on the table for helping...

Coming straight to the food... as we were a group of 5... we tasted large nos of there preparations... starting with there nibblers...

1. Chicken satay... good one to start off...

2. Crispy fried spicy chicken... very good and tasty, the chicken was soft and juicy, the spiciness was well spread...

3. Bok choi wrapped chicken dumplings... Superb one, very tasty, one of the best dish I ever had, recommended...

4. Panaggang... Now although my friends didn't liked it too much, I personally found it was awesome, the tangy and spicy soft fish was melting in my mouth... specially recommended for spicy people...

5. Tempura prawns... excellent presentation and very good in taste...

Now these need the special mention... They got the nerves of Bengali peoples... as they are able to make everyone having there SUSHIS and getting appreciation from them... as they are not using raw fish or meats.. we tried there...

6. Salmon Maki, Crab Maki and Salmon Nigiri... all have definite flavours and tastes, it's far better than authentic sushis... according to me... a must try...

In the main course we had...

7. Khow suey... they call it mom's khow suey, just insane, everyone must try it... I will not tell you the speciality just go and figure it out...

8. Pad Thai... okish, nothing gr8...

9. Nasi Goreng... very good...

10. Thai green curry... very tasty...

Lastly we tried...

11. Steamed fish with chilli oil... Excellent, excellent, excellent... what a dish to end the main course... highly recommended...

In dessert after a long discussion we settled for...

12. Strawberry compote with vanilla ice cream... very sobar preparations, also tasted very good... 

In drinks ( not in the menu, just ask for that) we had...

13. Lemon glass cooler... awesome...

14. Virgin mojito... both diet and non diet one and both were good...

Ultimately we ended in a very sweet note... with all happy face... the things which needed special mention was there preparations and Barnik (Co owner) for guiding through out our food journey... just carry on the good work guys...

So yesterday in the afternoon, I went to this place with my dad to try out their oriental menu. The location was very tricky for us to find out for we did not know that Dr. Md. Ishaque road is the new name of Kyd Street. Once we got that information, we could easily find the Dee Empressa hotel and thus this place too. The place has a very nice and elegant look about it. The servers were well mannered and courteous. The place was completely empty apart from us. On being seated we were served plain cold drinking water with the flavour of pudina and orange. 
We ordered Bok Choi wrapped chicken dumplings, Tom Yum soup and Khow suey. There was a very pleasant lady working there who helped us with our menu. Coming to the food we ordered :
1. Bok choi wrapped chicken dumplings: Bok choi is actually Chinese spinach which is wrapped around the chicken dumplings which were themselves very juicy and succulent. This is served with honey chilli sauce. I'll give this dish a 4.5/5. The 0.5 less is just because the dish was finished too early for my liking. The quantity could have been a little more. 
2. Tom yum soup : This soup is my signature dish in any Oriental restaurant. I'm completely in love with this and the soup here did not disappoint me. I'll give this a 4/5.
3. Khow Suey : The noodles, the coconut broth, the chicken pieces, and the garnishing including spring onions, coriander leaves, lemon slices, garlic, potato chips, chillies were all separately served. You can add whatever suits your taste. Everything was cooked very nicely. I'll give this dish a 4/5 too.
Taxes are applicable. They take a 5.8% service tax along with the 14.5% vat.

Nestled in the cosy enclave of Kyd Street area, The Co. by Wok Anthems is one of those places that become an instant favourite. This cosy spot tucked inside Dee Empressa Hotel is easy to miss, but if you love oriental cuisine, then you should have heard about it.

From the good people behind Wok Anthems, The Co. by Wok Anthems is a more off-the-cuff concept that focuses on authentic South East Asian cuisine. It‚Äôs, mostly serves the delicacies of Japan, Burma, Vietnam, Thailand and China. Devotees of Pan-Asian fare can taste a variety of oriental dishes under one roof. The atmosphere is very vibrant thanks to the bright orange & yellowish themed decor and comfortable specious sitting arrangements.

As thirst quenchers we got served Lemon Grass Cooler which I found little dull, I opted for Corona Beer and mixed it with Lemon Grass Cooler and found it turned into an interesting Beer Cocktail. I will recommend the management to think of something to add in Lemon Grass Cooler which spike up the taste or think of creating some innovative beer cocktails out of it.

Tom Yum and Tom Kha were both quite different from the ones I had experienced on my numerous food visits to Thailand but it‚Äôs likewise amusing. The dish was made into a light soup to be treated as an appetiser rather than a complete meal, which it was traditionally known to be. The Tom Yum soup (sadly you can‚Äôt choose to have the clear or thick base) here was tangy yet subtly sweet, and will kick your butt with its spiciness. If you need a drink to quell the spiciness, their Lemon Grass Cooler will do the trick.

Start with the luscious Chicken Satay, grilled marinated chicken strips topped with various spicy seasonings and finished with olive oil/butter. The Chicken Satay was just fantastic ‚Äî seemingly rustic, yet elegant in execution. It comes with a homemade peanut sauce to die for.

Do not miss the Paneang, a dish of fork-tender fish piece doused in yellow curry paste, which was one of their unique dishes. Panggang was not purely authentic, it was a dish they adapted using concept of a popular Bengali dish as inspiration (paturi) with Thai flavours with a lemon twist. The soft melt in mouth fish was a crowd pleaser as well. The succulent pieces of fish slow cooked in steam, infused with flavourful herb and spices with hints of lime and ginger. You just couldn‚Äôt stop eating this luscious fish ‚Äî a spicy, irresistible dish you just don‚Äôt want to share.

Their Crispy fried chicken was a dish developed to thwart the common misconception that crispy fried spicy chicken was dry. The Crispy fried chicken here will leave you begging for more, especially the unique flavour and texture combination. It was exceedingly moist, tender and flavourful, this melt-in-your-mouth crispy fried chicken was sure to please every chicken-lover.

Go for the Bok Choi wrapped Chicken Dumplings, exceptionally done chicken dumplings covered with green leafy vegetable that imparts a ton of flavour without being heavy. Finish off theese freshly made Bok Choi wrapped Chicken Dumplings, while they are warm ‚Äî warning: very addictive. It was a must-order you should share.

For something more extravagant, try out the Star Shaped Poached Dumplings, loaded with generous amount of gooey cottage cheese and American corn, was sure to satisfy! Star shaped dumplings after poaching is pan seared and quite similar to potstickers. Another must try dish.

Do yourself a favour and taste a legit plate of Firecracker Chicken ‚Äî amazing flavours full of umami from generous load of black bean sauce and chicken. The Firecracker Chicken sports a perfect crisp and won't disappoint.

Firecracker Mushroom and Chicken were there signature dishes which were their version of the popularly consumed chilli chicken. I was bit curious and asked the reason behind creating these dishes. Owner said Firecracker Mushroom and Chicken was created 3 years ago out of necessity because their first outlets landlords wouldn‚Äôt allow them to sell chilli chicken to avoid competition. But finally it ended up becoming their one of the most popular dishes.

It was evident that the sushi was super tasty, with the delicate, well-cut slices of sushi simply melted in our mouth. Try their Crab Maki - the pieces of crab meat were so lightly seared that they just dissolve in your mouth, DIVINE, so gorgeous that you'll find it hard to discard, this light and healthy alternative will leave you full and satisfied.

Sushi was where Wok Anthems started their food journey from; they have gone from serving supermarket sushi to where they are today. They do not serve fresh sushi because no one in India does and they don‚Äôt hide it. Instead they use the best rice, wasabi, ginger and soya because fish was not the only hero.

For mains, get the Steamed fish with chilli oil, a Thai street food. Steamed fish in chilli oil was delicately prepared using a French technique, en papillote with South East Asian flavours. Put it in your mouth, and wait for the party to begin; the flavours and textures were pretty damn amazing.

The Khow Suey, they served was not traditional but couldn't be more pleasing to the eyes and palate. Served with a generous amount of chicken strips, fried dried shrimp, bits of lime, chilli, fried onions and boiled egg was one of the best you can find. It was the simple Khow Suey gravy that elevates this Burmese delicacy from good to amazing. Mix up the ingredients as per your choice, stir it through the curry paste and there ‚Äî you're in heaven.

Again I found their Khow Suey was different from the authentic Khow Suey I tried in Myanmar. I once more asked the owner the reason behind that. He explained that their Khow Suey was created using inspiration from family meal that his family would enjoy on special occasions. It‚Äôs not made with coconut milk and curry paste. They used lentil paste and stock to give it a fragrant kick along with eight other condiments. Leaving enough room to create a playful fight on the table among us patrons much like their family would for dinner.

The Green Curry Chicken was aromatic and pleasantly lighter, so you can pair it with rice without any hesitation. Another must-order includes the Stir Fried Noodles ‚Äî smooth and exceedingly flavourful, it's sure to please carnivores.

You might even find your new favourite Pad Thai here. Their Pad Thai was a nutty dish with a sweet and spicy homemade sauce. It's tasty and loaded with bean sprouts, egg, and your choice of chicken or seafood. I personally didn‚Äôt find it much interesting to my palate.

Save stomach space for the Strawberry Compote served with Vanilla Ice-Cream. Finally, end your meal with the Lemon Cheesecake, a silky-smooth Cheesecake with lemon flavour. For dessert, you can't go wrong with the Strawberry Compote with Vanilla Ice-Cream or Lemon Cheesecake. You and your date will be all smiles when you leave.

The Co. by Wok Anthems is where you want to go if the group feels like trying something new. Expect punchy flavours and getting your hands dirty. If you're looking for a casual night out and need to satisfy your oriental cravings and enjoy some mocktails or beers, this is the place to be. The rustic, charming space is perfect for a laid-back dinner with your friends and family, and makes you feel right at home with its warm service.

Was hearing a lot about this place and on last tuesday I finally had a chance to visit this new quirky restaurant. It is located in the ground floor of Dee Empressa Hotel, a few minutes walk from Park Street metro station. The place is beautifully decorated having decent staffs. But the reason behind giving this new baby a full mark is their conviviality and generosity. Now let me come straight to the wide variety of cuisine they deliver. We ordered :

#Bok choi wrapped chicken dumpling - A unique chicken dumpling recipe which tasted absolutely delicious with the tangy sauce.

#Panggang - Grilled fish in banana leaves is a must order for spice lovers. The fish was beautifully cooked, a melt-in-mouth experience and the spice paste gave the dish an extra kick.

#California rolls - An inside out sushi roll served with soy sauce and wasabi tasted good.

#Khow suey - I really liked their way of serving this Burmese recipe. One can make his/her own dish as per preference. It tasted divine and the coconut curry broth had a perfect balance of flavours.

#Chicken Satay - They were having a problem in rolling the sushis, so they gave us a complimentary dish that was very sweet of them and it tasted good as well. The peanut sauce served with it had a rich flavour and was absolutely complementing the grilled chicken.

I'm simply amazed by their uniqueness and it seems that they are surely going to stand out from the crowd. The pocket pinch is quite reasonable which is an extra bonanza. Definitely gonna visit again !!

This is one of the the best restaurants that I've been to recently. Situated at the ground floor of Dee Empressa Hotel, this place isn't hard to find. The first thing that catches your eye is the decor of the restaurant, and this restaurant is very classy and stylish. I loved the warm tones complemented by neon and the quirky wall decorations. Another uncommon feature was the table mat doubling as the menu card, with space to scribble notes. Fun!
Second thing I absolutely loved was how they served basil leaf water (or maybe it was mint, I'm not sure). It was quite refreshing and welcome on a sultry evening.
Thirdly, the menu. Simple. Concise. Easy to choose.
We didn't have to wait long for the food to arrive. We ordered bok choi wrapped chicken dumplings, crispy spicy chicken and chicken teriyaki rolls. The chicken dumplings and the crispy chicken were delicious, supple. About the sushi, it was the first time I was trying sushi, so I was a bit skeptical, (the first bite of the sushi felt like my head will explode; its multiple times the effect of a tequila If you take too much wasabi, as I was told later). But they helped us ( how to eat it and tips ) and it was good. It was a personal achievement for me.
The people were very helpful and hospitable. This place is beautiful, very reasonably priced and classy. I'd highly recommend The Co.

This is a place which was on my list and we weren't disappointed. The ambience is wonderful and so is the staff. Now comes the food:
1)We started with Bok Choi wrapped Chicken Dumplings-It was one of the best dumplings I have tasted,the sauce makes it even better.
2)California Rolls-They had a bit of trouble with the sushi so they served us Chicken Satay on the house which just made me love them even more. The sushi was just as good.
3)Pangangg-A quirky dish,probably the best of the lot.
4)Khau Suey-A traditional burmese dish which is balanced and clicks the taste buds.
All in all a wonderful place and I sure hope they keep up the good work.

A hidden gem. I dont know how many people know about this but it surely deserves more customers. Location has been mentioned in one of the previous reviews. 5 minutes from both esplanade and park street metro station. So ideally located. The decor is classy and chic. The staffs were excellent. Coming to the food, we ordered crispy fried chicken, bok choi wrapped chicken dumplings and chicken teriyaki rolls. Crispy fried chicken was awesome and had a tangy taste. Bok choi wrapped chicken was awesome as well.  For those who have never tried sushi before beware of the green paste,i.e.,wasabi. If you take too much it will feel like something went up through ur nose and exploded in ur head.
Tip for those who haven't tried sushi yet. Take a very tiny amount of wasabi on ur sushi n then dip it in soy sauce n put it in ur mouth directly.dont try to eat it in two or more bites. And this place is too reasonable n very classy.

The name itself could give you a hint of uniqueness of the place itself. They have their own style of catering the pan Asian food which stands them out from other places of that area. 

Location: At the ground floor of the Dee Empressa Hotel which is situated in Kyd Street area. If you are coming from Esplanade to Park Street area then just take the immediate left after you cross Indian museum and 3-4 mins walk inside that lane towards free school Street you get this right at the left. Very easy to locate. Parking available right at the opposite.

Decor and Ambiance:
They have kept the decor very catchy yet very simple. On the side walls are designed with post cards and on a wall u find bookshelf which has some of the popular books in it. 
A perfect ambiance for fine dining.

USP: 
-> The table mat cum menu card and side part scribble option .. Very very smart and unique
-> Reasonable pricing compare to the taste of the food and quality. 
-> Simple and stylish presentation
-> A hidden gem located near park Street area- If you wanna try something different and good go for it also gives you a relief of avoiding queues in lot of restaurants available there. 

Food:
Starters:
Bok Choi wrapped chicken dumplings: Looks good and tastes even better.. Try this new style dumplings .. 
Panggang: Spicy fish filet wrapped with banana leaf .. Quality of the fish is excellent ..if you like spicy stuff just go for it.

Crispy fried spicy chicken: This chicken dish is tossed in juicy sauce with a very decent presentation and taste makes it completely perfect dish to start with.

Mains:
Firecracker chicken: Saucy dry chicken preparation made with colorful Bell peppers  added to it.

Steamed Fish with chilli oil: A MUST TRY..Recommend strongly..
Thai green curry: It was light and smooth goes well with steamed rice. For people likes Thai light curries.. .very authentic

Pad Thai: One of my favorite and they makes if really well. Tastes a bit on the Tangier side which I personally like very much . 

Nasi Goreng: A chinese touched non veg rice with egg pouch on top is a nicely presented rice dish.
Khow Suey : HIGHLY Recommend... 
I was just bowled over this unique Burmese dish. Special soupy dal with noodles, chicken , garlic , fried oninos ,  spring onions, chips , dhaniya, lemon .. Best part is you can make the dish as per your taste as all the items are served to you separately. You can literally be the chef if you want to otherwise as for the expert assistance.

Sushi:
Tried the below variety in sushis .. They are absolutely mild in taste and a person who has never had sushi but has a notion it's being bad trust me you can easily have it here. Very much palatable for all. 
Salmon Maki
Crab Maki
Salmon Nigiri

Dessert:
Strawberry compote with Vanilla ice cream: Vanilla ice cream is my fav as dessert and this one made me really happy as they kept it simple as it is and the strawberry compote added to it  was just a perfect combo. Simple and sober :)

Service:
No doubt this place could give an awesome hospitality and lovely service through out.
The owners Barnie and Mridul are very generous and helpful towards their guests and assists you through out your meal. Now that's what I call being a real good host . Keep it up guys.
 I am sure this place is surely to be an upcoming star performer in the city and will definitely recommend this place.

I loved this quirky place, serving some awesome food in the heart of the city. The lemon grass cooler and the Diet Coke mojito were 2 refreshing drinks we were served! For starters it was Pakchoi dumplings, a very healthy no-carb dumplings which tastes well. Then came a chicken satay, I did not like the sauce much, they should improvise on it. A spicy fish wrapped in banana leaves for all people there who loves spicy food. A simple crispy fried chicken, which was decent. And then some good sushi, for people who have not tried... This should be the place :) prawn tempura done up a way which was uncommon, yet crunchy and nice! For main course it was some awesome green Thai curry with steamed rice. A nice fire cracker chicken that goes very well with pad Thai which was really well made. A nasi goreng which don't please my taste buds! The best khowsuey I had was here, very different from usual and yet amazing! The fish in chili oil stole my heart, nothing could be better. We needed our meal with an in house ice cream and strawberry compote- damn it was so sexy! I loved how me. Barnik hosted us, and the way his team took care of us :) harts off!

Is this David on the Park Street food scene? Fingers Crossed!
The Co by Wok Anthems at Hotel Dee Empressa on Kyd Street leaves you happy and satisfied. The Co is a small in house restaurant at Hotel Dee Empressa on Kyd Street. There is a promise that The Co makes with it‚Äôs food and it is easy to accept because what we were served was good and we would go for it again. The only challenge is that food is the only thing they have to amp up the game against the regular places on Park Street.¬†

We believe that is The Co plays their cards right they will have regulars lining up.
                                                                ...

This south east asian food joint can prove to be a tough competitor for existing and upcoming south east asian delicacies with respect to taste and price of food! The Co. by Wok Anthems is located in Kid street and based out of hotel Dee Empresea. Can accomodate about 50-60 customers with decent interiors!
Sushi lovers should definitely visit this place to gorge on the range of salmon, crab, meat and seafood sushis with a minimum pinch to the pocket. The other dishes worth mentioning are the Khow suey( sumptuous spread and good quantity), Nasi goreng, fire cracker chicken. Quantity is sufficient for two people to share a dish.

This restaurant marked my very first sushi tasting in Kolkata!!!And it will be remembered by me for this. It has a very interesting decor‚Ä¶The walls are adorned with quotes in one section and also has a bookshelf‚Ä¶Very few restaurants have bookshelves in Kol‚Ä¶For people not interested in books,they have music played in the background to keep you engaged‚Ä¶What impressed me the most was their table mat cum menu had a scribbling area,which made it easier to us to note down what we were eating!!!

Location: Hotel Dee Empressa, Kid Street; Near MLA Hostel.

The Co., a sister concern of Wok Anthems, is the newest addition in the Pan Asian food timeline of Kolkata which has finally opened its gates to the customers a week back. The place had an overall nice feel to it and looked quite promising. The AMBIANCE was pretty soothing and sent across warm vibes which helped in the unwinding process. The colorful & abstract wallpapers, cushioned seating arrangement for approximately sixty heads, a combination of dims & spots, the marble top for the buffet which could be utilized as the pass in the absence of the buffet spread gave this place a very contemporary feel and also the sound levels of the music was kept at bay. Adding as a brownie point were the tissue holders which were designed in the form of a sectioned box with four sections each for tissues, pencils, fork and spoon respectively. One might wonder why pencils were there, but, that's there because of the style the menu has been drafted in, which was yet another plus to the place.

Coming to the FARE, the menu was designed as a table mat with a scribble section for feedback or noting of orders/little things you might wish to keep a track of. The fare on offer was thoughtfully kept short and sweet. One thing before talking in details about the fare is that not only did the taste & flavors did justice to the short menu but, also made us overlook the want for more options/variety. The following spread was sampled:

- Lemon Grass Cooler (Welcome Drink)
The cooler though wasn't fizzy enough, was nicely prepared in terms of flavors. The lemon grass flavor was a notch low and could have been a bit stronger in balance to the sugar levels. Nevertheless, the flavors didn't overpower each other at all. Extremely refreshing it was. But, the melting ice acted as a negative for the drink by diluting it to a certain level. Adding a subtle citric tangent would add as a brownie point.

- Virgin Mojito
The mojito was a bit disappointing since, the major problem was the fizziness of the drink. Though the other parameters weren't a problem but, the lack of fizz in the mojito failed the drink as a whole. Could be looked upon and improved.

- Tom Kha
A traditional Thai Soup, having Coconut milk as its base, was a spicy & sour hot soup consisting of an assortment of veggies and a flavorful broth. The subtle punch of the kaffir lime and ginger/galangal did add as a brownie point. Wasn't as spicy as expected but, did taste delicious. Recommended.

- Veg Star-shaped Poached Dumplings
The flavorful dumplings were served as a potsticker and oh boy, they did impress. Simmered to perfection on one side and fried until crisp & light brown on the other. Was served with a delicious dip made of garlic, ginger, parsley & red pepper flakes in perfect proportion on the side. The dip was punchy, sharp, tangy and did compliment well. The dumplings along with the dip were an instant hit.
Highly Recommended.

- Veg Satay
Satay is primarily a Malaysian dish of well seasoned, skewered and grilled meat but, the vegetarian variant consisted of mashed vegetables instead. Paired with an in-house peanut butter dip, the soft and well grilled Satay was an absolute delicacy. A special mention of their in-house dip which was one of the best I have come across.
People who love satays could definitely give this vegetarian variant a try and I assure, you wouldn't be disappointed.

- Cucumber Maki Rolls
Known as Kappamaki Sushi in Japan, these are sushi rolls, as the name suggests, with cucumber as a filling in the middle of the rolled sushi-meshi (Japanese sticky rice). But, before talking about the sushi dish here, I would pen down a special mention that though my quest for delicious sushis would never end but, it definitely has come to a pause here and The Co. is the go-to place for awesome ones.
Now about the sushis,
The rolls itself were well prepared and each & every component of the same was done with utmost care. Starting with the sushi-meshi, it was nicely cooked, had the essential quality of being glutinousness and was perfectly seasoned with rice vinegar, sugar & salt. It was neatly rolled within the Nori (the black dried seaweed wrappers on the outside) with thin slices of cucumbers inside.
The sushi is often served with wasabi, sweet pickled ginger (gari) and soy sauce. Here as well, it was served along with the same. The well prepared strips of gari acted as a palate cleanser and the wasabi, a piquant paste, was extremely strong & was recommended to be used by pinch.
The sushi dish as a whole was loved and did justice to its origin & also to the claim of being the restaurant speciality.
Though, a complimenting cup of Agari (green tea) and a colorful presentation was missed, this dish as well as any other sushi variant is highly recommended.

- Veg Khowsuey
Khowsuey is a Burmese dish which is more or less a one-pot meal with layers of noodles, a curry made of coconut milk and a garnish of different accompaniments. Here, the accompaniments included crushed potato wafers, chopped spring onions, red chillies, coriander leaves, fried onion, roasted garlic and lemon wedges. The curry however, was extremely different yet, flavorful having lentils as a base. The less traveled path (family recipe) could however, add as a positive if the menu is subtly indicative.
A khowsuey is prepared as per personal taste preferences. Mine did taste awesome!

- Firecracker Mushrooms
The dish consisted of deep-fried Shiitake Mushrooms tossed in a well prepared sauce along with an assortment of fresh vegetables (Onion & Bell peppers). The sauce was a perfect combination of sweet and spicy flavors with a subtle hint of tanginess & zing. The dish as a whole did taste nice but, the mushrooms were however, not found to be crisp or have that slight bite in it. Swapping the Shiitake with Button Mushrooms might bring out the better of the dish. Preparing the sauce as per customer preferences might add up as a brownie point.

- Crispy Chilli Babycorn
Well marinated pieces of babycorn deep-fried and tossed in a flavorful & well-balanced (in terms of seasoning) szechuan sauce. The corn was crisp and had the expected bite. The dish tasted good.

- Szechuan Noodles
Perfectly boiled noodles tossed along with fresh veggies and mild spice. Did taste decent, however, the level of spice could be slightly increased as the noodles as a whole tasted nearly similar to Hakka Noodles.

- Thai Green Curry
The preparation of the Thai Curry here has been by far among the delicious ones tasted. The consistency of the curry was exactly as its supposed to be; neither too runny nor too thick in nature. The vegetables were fresh and the flavors were subtle & clear so as to suit the palate; no single seasoning flavor overpowered the rest. Loved the preparation. Was served along with perfectly cooked steamed rice. The combination tasted good.
Recommended. Jasmine Rice could be a great compliment as well.

- Strawberry Compote with Ice-cream
The Strawberry Compote, made from fresh strawberries simmered into a sauce with sugar and lemon, was an excellent & deliciously prepared accompaniment to the Vanilla Ice-cream which was topped with crunchy caramel pieces. This dessert was an instant hit.
Highly recommended.

- Lemon Cheesecake
The base of the cheesecake made up of biscuit crumbs was nicely set and had no complaints. But, the cheesecake was found to have a tad higher level of gelatin making it too stiff & derailed from the expected texture for the liking. Nevertheless, the lemon zest levels were absolutely fine and paired well. The dessert does have a scope of improvement.

About the STAFF, they need proper training as well as need to be well-aware about the menu on offer.
About the SERVICE, it surely was prompt but, lacked professionalism. The servers should remember about the protein preferences i.e. serving a non-vegetarian dish to a vegetarian in the flow of service is unacceptable. Also, dropping food while servicing is bit of a turnoff and could be improved upon. Yes, human errors are meant to be rectified and was immediately looked into. :)

‚Ä¢ A word of appreciation towards the owner, Mr. Barnik Bardhan, who has been looking after the intricate details that would go into the making of a wonderful food experience, is a warm and welcoming host who looked after to every little thing with ease! Cheers!
And, thank you for the warm invitation for a Food Assessment.

The PRICES were found to be pocket friendly.

Overall the experience was good and promising.
- Looking forward to more visits.
- The little flaws once worked upon would help better the experience!

Cheers & All the Best for the future days!

Wish i could give 0, staffs are just horrible. We had the reservation but thry refused to give food on arrival. Then after plenty of non sense talking from them we called the manager. And finally we got the food. But again our food vouchers were clubbed. We had 8 group on vouchers but they served only 5. Don't know how can you divide them into 5. Just horrible. Will not recommend this place at all.

The Co. by Wok Anthems offering 4-course meal on nearbuy app for 199 bucks looked like a good deal. Had some confusion regarding the name since the offer was by The Co. and voucher showed Hues Restaurant. Went there today for redeeming the vouchers. The restaurant is located in the ground floor of the Dee Empressa Hotel on Kyd Street. The decor was nice. We went in at around 12:30 pm and the restaurant was completely empty. We could understand that the restaurant kitchen wasn't ready for taking orders. The captain Mr. Akhtar came and confirmed that. Offered us cold drinks. We waited for 20 mins after which the manager came and apologised for the delay. We then ordered Tom Yum soup, Chicken Satay, Dumplings. They were served quickly. Firstly the soup wasn't at all to our liking. Haven't had authentic Tom Yum so can't comment much on that. The Satay was another item we wished we hadn't ordered. Cooked in coconut oil and served with peanut sauce they tasted awful. We decided never to order anything cooked in coconut oil ever again. The Dumplings were good and the dip was amazing. Coming to mains we ordered Burnt garlic coriander rice which is a 5/5 on flavour and taste, Nasi Goreng a tangy fried rice server withing a fried egg wrapping, Firecracker Chicken, Honey Chicken and Schezuan chicken probably... The honey chicken stood out with its sticky sweetness. The other two dishes were good but not at all hot n spicy. Overall they were good. Since we had messed up our taste buds with the Tom Yum and Satay we didn't try the sushi even though we heard good reviews. For desert we ordered lemon cheesecake and strawberry with vanilla ice cream. The lemon cakes were too tangy for us and had a slightly more gelatinous character than desired. The strawberry with ice cream was fabulous.

The servers and captains were courteous inquiring about the taste of the food often. Glasses were filled at intervals. The manager also came to inquire us about the quality.

Overall had a nice lunch. Looking forward to try the sushis some other time.

Pointer to management: This restaurant has the potential to be one of the hip and happening destinations if you keep improving.

To begin with I desperately wanted to give this place a better rating, because there were things which I really liked. But there were more cons, so had to go for a 3.0

The pros first - 

The ambiance is nice and warm. The service was attentive, quick and friendly. Few items were really good. And above all the place serves sushi.

Now the cons -

The servers were not well trained. This restaurant is part of a hotel and earlier used to serve only Indian (they still do). The Oriental menu was added a couple of months ago. So the waiters, I think, are still not comfortable with the new items.

No beverages in the menu, other than diet coke cans. However, in the end, we were told they could manage fresh lime soda. 

Some dishes that were served had almost no connection with their names written on the menu. You will get names like Tom Yum Soup, Khow Suey in the menu which looks and tastes completely different. Not all tastes bad, though. But it comes as a shock after you order something and get something different. I personally think this is dishonest and manipulative. One should not use the name and goodwill of one dish to sell something else. 

For most items the quantities are shockingly less. 

Now the main thing, food. We Ordered - 

Tom Yum Soup - It was anything but Tom Yum Soup. it tasted refreshing though. If it was named as Chicken Lemongrass Soup in menu, I would have given it a much higher rating, for not confusing my order. About the soup apart from the name, the broth was refreshing, the chicken pieces were hard and one even had bone and there were way too much lemongrass. They should have strained the lemongrass pieces out. Quantity was less.

Bok Choi Wrapped Chicken Dumplings - Tasted awesome. Loved the dumplings and the sweet sauce given with it. But at 160 bucks four pieces of tiny dumplings was too much. Most badly priced item in the menu.

Khow Suey - What was served was not Khow Swey. Yes, there was a broth, and noodles and condiments, but the similarity ended there. Didn't even like the taste of the broth. The fried garlic was not done right, too. 

Salmon Nigiri - Loved this. The rice balls were pressed a bit too firm, but that can be overlooked. Loved everything else. Rice, fish and wasabi balance was perfect for me.

Crab Maki - Loved this too.

In all, visit the place if you are in a mood for sushis. Nothing else I tried was worth travelling for.

They should have strained the lemongrass pieces out. Quantity was less.

Bok Choi Wrapped Chicken Dumplings - Tasted awesome. Loved the dumplings and the sweet sauce given with it. But at 160 bucks four pieces of tiny dumplings was too much. Most badly priced item in the menu.

Khow Suey - What was served was not Khow Swey. Yes, there was a broth, and noodles and condiments, but the similarity ended there. Didn't even like the taste of the broth. The fried garlic was not done right, too. 

Salmon Nigiri - Loved this. The rice balls were pressed a bit too firm, but that can be overlooked. Loved everything else. Rice, fish and wasabi balance was perfect for me.

Crab Maki - Loved this too.

In all, visit the place if you are in a mood for sushis. Nothing else I tried was worth travelling for.

I visited this place on an invitation to Team PanchPhoron a few days back, for a weekday dinner. They have two separate menus: Indian and South East Asian, and we were there to sample the latter.

We were greeted by the Lemongrass Cooler and the Mojito. Both these were okayish, and being super hungry after office, I was ready to gorge on some real food.

I had the Tom Kha soup which was brilliant to the t, the flavours being delicate yet identifiable. Then came the satays, of which I liked the dip more than the satays themselves. Next was the Bok Choi wrapped Chicken Dumpling, which was nothing short of amazing. It won't be an exaggeration to say that it was one of the best dumplings to have ever entered my mouth.

We were in a big group and made it a point to sample almost their entire menu. The crispy fried spiced chicken was the perfect balance of sweet, hot and tang coating over succulent chicken. However the baby corn version of the same failed to make an impression, with the babycorn itself being a little dry.

Then came the sushis, one thing I was really looking forward to. Both the Crab Maki and the Salmon California Rolls were well rolled, and with the wasabi adding the punch, it was indeed an enjoyable biteful.

The Khao Suey, being a spin-off of the original, will dissappint one looking for the exact traditional flavours, but even then it was the warm bowl of comfort and goodness as it was supposed to be. So personally I wouldn't complain, though the menu indicating the twist would be better.

The Thai Green Curry was good, but the Pad Thai wasn't. But Panggang again was the perfect piece of fish, amply spiced and cooked beautifully with some strong aromatics.

The Fire Crackers, both the mushroom and the chicken versions, could have been more fiery in taste and more crackling in flavour, but the chicken noodles were a surprise and was simple yet beautiful.

The final main course was the Steamed fish with Chilli Oil, and this one really stole my heart. Simple clean flavours, perfectly seasoned well cooked fish, fried garlic on top all came together to bring magic to our taste buds.

Hardly had any appetite for desserts after the elaborate mains. But sampled the Lemon Cheesecake and the Vanilla Ice cream. The former having too much of gelatin, had lost its desired texture, but the latter was really good, with the tart strawberry, crunchy caramel and the creamy ice cream, making for the perfect end to a great meal.

The restaurant is called Hues I guess. No one had any idea what wok anthems was lol. So we went to have chicken khow suey. It was the first time we had tried anything like this. It was new, different and interesting. The decor of the place was quite decent. No crowd. Which was good but the service wasn't as quick.

The Co. restaurant forms part of the De Empress Hotel @ Park Street near the MLA Hostel. We went there for buffet breakfast and were overall happy with our experience. The restaurant is a 25 odd seater with a decent buffet spread. For b/f, brown and white reads with jam and butter, fruits - including apple, banana and watermelon, kellog's chocos with milk, packed "Raja" brand cakes, canned guava juice, bombaiyya sandwich, gobhi bhaja, methi paratha with aloo dum, vada with chutney and sambhar and finally milk and tea!
Methi paratha with aloo combination became my favorite whereas, the sandwich was also nice. Gobhi bhaja as well as south indian spread was pretty mediocre - which calls for improvement! Tea served was initially blatantly cold which was replaced on demand! Toast, packet cakes and kellog's with tea seemed a nice combination!¬†
Service is nice and fast. The staff provided ice on demand which I used for the guava juice which was served @ room temperature. The food was getting exhausted very quickly and was getting replenished equally fast!
I am thankful to the management for providing me this experience and I wish them best of luck for their future endeavors!

My third food tasting event as part of the Paanch Phoron team.
The Co. may not be that familiar a name in Kolkata food scene, but 'Wok Anthem' definitely is. Or at least was when it operated out of the small outlet at Salt Lake & then New Town. The idea of Thai / Chinese in bento boxes really excited me a lot.Had bookmarked them as per suggestions from Zomato. However they closed down. There were speculations that they will be opening a outlet around south Kolkata. there was no option other than waiting.The wait finally paid off, when I found that they have set shop in the park street area, & invited our team for a complimentary dinner.
Let me tell you, the location of the outlet is a bit odd. Basically take the road between park Street & Sudder street, Cross the MLA hostels, arrrive at the De Empressa Hotel on the left, which houses the restaurant in the ground floor. The outlet is new, so make sure to ask for the hotel & not the restaurant. Also they immediately need to put up a sign outside the premises.
Coming to the ambiance:
The place is brand new. Nicely done up. From the glass doors that slide open automatically to the washrooms which have oil paintings replacing the standard 'his/her' signs. Seating is spacious. Though the tables may seem a wee bit narrow. Lighting is neither overwhelming, nor you have to struggle to read the menu.
Coming to the menu:
It is of a standard size, not an encyclopaedia. In Mr. Barnik , the owner-cum-manager of the outlet's own words they didn't want to serve the same ingredient in 3 different sauces in 4 different plates. Good one Barnik. Still they have managed to have fair amount of variety on the menu, from fish to crab, dumplings to sushi. The only thing they lack is mock tails. In fact the menu we were given didn't have any. However they will be shortly changing the menu, & I sincerely hope they will be having extra additions.

We were asked for our choice of drinks. Two mock tails were available from Beer. The mock tails 'Mojito Mint' & 'Lemongrass soda' were a bit disappointing. The mojito lacked the punch of the soda while the lemongrass lacked the citrus kick. Hopefully they will get those right before they have their grand opening which is upcoming shortly. I don't think there's to write anything about the Corona beer served. :D

As for food we literally tried nearly all of the items on the menu. so will do a very quick review of them.

1. Soups: Sweet Corn, Tom Kha & Tom Yum
Sweet Corn was decent. Tom Yum is prepared a bit different from the authentic recipe to suit the Indian taste palate. But what was really outstanding was the Tom Kha with its unique coconut milk & seafood-like smell. Must try.

2. Chicken Satay & Veg Satay:
Well prepared, though the veg ones tasted better than the chicken one. Extra point for the peanut butter dip prepared in house. It was mind blowing & perfect for the satay. in fact forget the satay its can be eaten as a separate item altogether.

3. Panggang:
The closest thing which can come to this is Bhetki Paturi. However this one is prepared with Basha fish and cooked with lime slices inside the folded leaves. Extra ordinary in taste. Consume with or without the lime as per your taste.

4. Bok Choi wrapped Chicken Dumplings & Veg Star Shaped Poached Dumplings:
They serve the dumplings over boiling water contained in those wooden dumpling box which I think is a first for a restaurant in that locality. The Chicken dumplings were good, not exceptional but once again the veg one was outstanding. Prepared with paneer this one was unlike any other veg dumplings I've tried in the city.

5. Sushi: Salmon Maki, Crab Maki, California Rolls
This was my first time with sushi, hence can't comment on the quality.Of course I didn't find any obnoxious smell at least¬† & since its there specialty, there was no complaint from fellow foodies as well.

6. Mains: Firecracker Chicken/Mushrooms, Crispy Chili Baby Corn & Thai Green curry:
Firecracker Chicken was good, nothing to write home about. Firecracker Mushrooms were not that of a cracker item, hopefully they will be experimenting with button mushrooms to improve it. Firecracker Chicken was decent. The Baby corn was hard in the inside & soft on the outside, exactly opposite of what it should have been. Thai Green curry although tasted great lacked the quantity of the veggies it ideally should have.

7. Khow Suey:
This was the first time I had something like this. It was like prepare your own noodles. Mix n match the fried shrimps, toasted garlic, fried onion , coriander as per your taste, top it up with the curry of your choice & sprinkle some chips over & voila you have a great tasting food.

8. Pad thai:
It was not that good. Looked promising though. In fact used to be their signature dish when they operated in salt lake. Hopefully they will give it a makeover.

9. Szechuan Noodles & Fried Rice:
Prepared at per if not better than most of the outlets in park street serving Cantonese food.

10. Steamed Fish with Chili Oil:
They have a unique way of preparing it. Burning hot oil is poured over the steamed fish fillet, cooking the crust in a unique way.

11. Dessert:
We had Lemon Cheesecake which was a disappointment. It really needs to be much much softer.
But the strawberry Compote with vanilla Ice cream with crushed caramel on top was seriously mind blowing. A must try for everyone.

Overall nice place, Good food, bits & scope of improvement here & there. As of now the staff are under-trained, but I'm sure they'll do just fine with time.Some of the foods are too good to be true for the price paid. Will visit again.

Till then,Happy eating.
                                          ...

This restaurant marked my very first sushi tasting in Kolkata and thanks to PanchPhoron for that!!!And it will be remembered by me for this..

It has a very interesting decor...The walls are adorned with quotes in one section and also has a bookshelf...Very few restaurants have bookshelves in Kol...For people not interested in books,they have music played in the background to keep you engaged...What impressed me the most was their table mat cum menu had a scribbling area,which made it easier to us to note down what we were eating!!!

Coming to food,we started off with the lemongrass cooler which I found a tad too sweet and also lacked the punch.

Followed by chicken satay which was perfectly cooked...What I loved more was their in-house peanut butter sauce which had a hint of tamarind.

Panggang-What impressed me the most about this fish dish was that it was already garnished with lemon which added bitterness and acidity to the dish..however,it can be removed for the ones who prefer more spicy and less bitter.

Chicken dumplings-One of the best dumplings I've ever had!!!Very soft and juicy..

Crispy fried spicy chicken was absolutely amazing!!!I would recommend this as a starter..

Tom Kha soup-The texture was amazing and tasted great as well!!!

Fire cracker chicken,Fire cracker mushroom-The mushroom was not very good...Chicken I felt was a bit overcooked(at least my portion)..

Crispy chili baby corn lacked the crispiness and needs to be a bit more spicy..

Thai green curry was well cooked..had ample vegetables accompanied by meat.

Khow Suey here is good...not the traditional one...their own version..so if somebody wants the traditional Khow Suey,then they should give it a skip!!!They served it with many condiments including shrimp so that we could make our own version..

Stir fried noodles turned out to be a surprise...Tasted really good!!!Szechuan fried rice had the color but lacked the spiciness...Pad Thai really needs work...

Amongst their sushis,the California rolls particularly impressed me more than their Crab Maki...Hoping to try their seafood bento someday!!!

Steamed Fish in Chilli Oil-This was the clear winner for me!!!The fish was fresh and just perfectly cooked..They should recommend this dish particularly to the health conscious people..

For deserts,we had lemon cheesecake which was not at all impressive,it was a bit too set and also the base was difficult to cut with a spoon...strawberry compote with vanilla ice cream was amazing...especially the combination of vanilla ice cream with caramelized sugar shavings on top...

A special thanks to Mr. Barnik Bardhan for making our visit memorable...and all my best wishes with him for the grand opening!!!

Why this place has been rated so low, I really don't know (Probably because most of the reviews I've been reading have been mostly trying to redeem some groupon coupons, but hey, what would you expect when you buy a coupon for an Indian buffet breakfast at a Thai and sushi place, just saying.) but my opinion of this place is that it has the best value for money food that one can get in the category of Asian cuisine. Dropped by for a quick lunch. The owner was there to greet us as we had a reservation so he was really sweet to care enough to follow up. Once we were seated, we started with placing our order. We ordered the Crab Maki (according to the owner's suggestion), and the Salmon Nigiri Sushi. The Sushi was worth every penny that we paid. Salmon was frozen but with the price we paid, hey, there's no complaining! And more importantly, it wasn't frozen in a bad way. Next came the mains. We ordered the Thai green curry, which came with a huge bowl of steamed rice, and Pad Thai, both of which were really really good. Finally came the dessert, and since we didn't have enough room for a cake each, we ordered one cheesecake. It was decent. Two cans of diet coke were had as well as a bottle of mineral water. Total bill came to about a thousand bucks, which was well worth the food. Very friendly staff and the decor was nice too. Would recommend if you have a stomach for thai food or sushi. Will definitely continue visiting this place.

No menu ! My friends and I visite the restaurant with 5 SEPERATE group on coupons. We were five. So according to what they published on group on, we expected to have five seperate plates for each. But it was not the case.Instead of virgon mojito, they served us cold drinks
We were neither informed nor asked about our choices. They served only 2 starters saying thay they have clubbed the orders.Food looked good and tasted average. Staff was not so cared about our prefferences. Chilly chicken tasted horribly sour. Will hesitate to recommend.

No one to attend. Found food quality not upto the mark. Bhatura specially was too oily. In deserts, they only served packaged chocolate cake which was disappointing. Only respite there was their cutlets were awesome. Just loved it.

A Sunday lunch by redeeming group on vouchers. It was me and my cousin again. I reached there in time when i got to know that my cousin gonna be late. Without waiting outside on the footpath, i entered the restaurant. It's basically a restaurant at the ground floor of the hotel dee empressa. It is located near kyd street parallel to sudder street. No restaurant name is written outside and only hotel name is there so it's difficult to locate if you don't know the hotel name. When i informed them that my cousin would be late, the staff didn't complain and i waited there for more than 30 minutes. Finally my cousin reached and we started our food venture. It was a fixed menu.
                    First we were served chicken clear soup but the taste is completely different from the usual one. The soup had a strong flavour of 'gondhoraj lebu' or kaffir lime. The leaves are added to it to keep the aroma strong. I loved it. Next came the starter platter  comprising sushi, chicken stick served with a sauce. Chicken was good but low in salt. Makizushi was average but the sauce was good having excess ginger with a touch of sweetness. Next came the main course comprising of plain rice, Thai green chicken curry and chilli chicken. Thai curry was really tasty with full of vegetables and chicken pieces. I didn't like chilli chicken. It was not like the usual one and had excessive capsicum. Taste was also very different. And the last item that is dessert. It was ice cream with brownie. Two scoops of vanilla ice creams sprinkled with ground brownie and chocolate sauce. It was good in taste.
        Service was good and the staffs were very helpful. Price is reasonable.
