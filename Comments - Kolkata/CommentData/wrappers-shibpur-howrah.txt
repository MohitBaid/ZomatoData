1. Ordered Double Chicken Roll & Boneless Chicken Pakoras.
2. Taste is above average.
3. Pricing is a tad bit higher keeping in mind the quality.
4. What surprised me the most was the discrepancies in the price list when ordering on Zomato and ordering without Zomato.

Today I have ordered egg gravy chowmein from your respective restaurant. But the chowmein was too salty and the gravy was too runny that I can not labelled it as gravy at all. It is a total waste of money.

Ordered chili chicken, chicken lolipop and veg noodles through zomato...
Chili chicken was average..
Chicken lolipop had a thick covering which made the taste bad..
And they noodles were good..
But with respect to the prices, the quantity was cool..

Tried a veg steam momo from here and noodles.
Noodles was with less vegetables and thin noodles. Liked the Momo's though one of the best Street momo's, it was perfect and the dip had less spice, just like my type.
