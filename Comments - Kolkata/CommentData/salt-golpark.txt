Food here is really good especially the chicken tandoori. Only suggestion I have is that when serving regular chicken biryani then please increase the portion of rice.

Salt is a new addition to the Southern avenue food scene. It is a small restauranr but the food is good. Ordered chicken malai salli kebab, mutton masoor pulao with sarki, chicken dabba gosht, masala thums up and cucumber mint cooler. The highlight was the salli kebab.. perfect taste. The mutton masoor pulao was good but was not quite flavourful. Quantity was bit less compared to price. Dabba gosht is a baked dish so like any other baked dish with cheese it will dry up quickly but it is unique in its own. The drinks were great. Service was very friendly..no complaints in that. Ambience is a mix of white and green interiors and very soothing to the eyes. Pricing is okay.

This was my first time to this restaurant and my first time trial with the Bohri cuisine. We tried Mutton Masoor Pulao which was served with some accompaniment. Taste was OK overall. Need to try other Bohri stuffs as well when I visit next. Other items we tried were Chicken Reshmi kebab, Butter Chicken and Butter Naan. All of them were good. Tutty-Fruity was OK. I liked the ambiance which was neatly designed in the shade of white and green.¬† I however found the service little slow.

Homely place, bright green and white interiors - very soothing to eyes. Great Bohri food - not too spicy or oily.  Have the Thal - it's an experience by itself.  You need to be in groups so it's like great bonding over good food.  Whatever we ordered, we just polished it off - it was really yummy. We ended with falooda ice cream - nice light was very yum.

Coming across Salt is probably the best thing happened to me this weekend. I have never had a chance to explore Bohri cuisine before and had a little knowledge about it but the owner nicely explained it to us and walked us through the menu.

For the interior they picked two colours, white and lime green, which was soothing to the eye. The seating was close-packed, neat and comfortable. The orders were also quickly served.

The Egyptian Mutton had four pieces of boneless mutton and yellow gravy which was probably some kind of lentil. The Lachcha paratha, made in oven was nicely layered. The Mutton Masoor Pulao was adequately spicy and had four chunks of mutton. All the meats were tender and well-cooked. Falooda was not available and I did not ask for any other desserts.

A nice cozy place off southern avenue on Keyatala road. Very neatly decorated and what was unique was to find little hand sanitizer on every table. 
The foods were very classily presented and tasted really good. The Haleem was more of a thick gravy instead of fluid which actually made it more interesting. The seekh kebabs and malai salli Kebab is little different due to a frying tinge but it's good. The meat were tender. The chicken in cashew gravy was yummy and went well with the bread. The khejur halwa was too good. Heavy on the tummy but super tasty.

Salt is a nice restaurant located in the Keyatala area close to Dhakuria Lake. It serves little known Bohri cuisine (along with more famous North Indian cuisine) which comes as a surprise. I haven't tried their Mughlai fare, so I can't rate them on that. My review and rating is based on the Bohri dishes we tried out. We ordered for home delivery and the service was prompt & efficient. Both the Mutton Masoor Pulao & Sarki and Bohri style Haleem were delicious and had generous portions for two. The Baked Kaju Pak deserves a special mention as one of the best sweet dish I've ever had.

Situated in bylanes of golpark - keyatala area , this restaurant Salt serves some selected items from bohri cuisine along with regular mughlai choices. The interiors are clean , done in white and green , with full length curtain separated couch settings to accomodate groups .
We were quite late for dinner , however the owner welcomed us with warmth and allowed us to try and experiment the menu without‚Äã any hurry. Sadly few items including biryani was not available which wasn't expected.
The two starters CHCKEN MALAI SALLI KEBAB and MUTTON SHEEKH‚Äã KEBAB were both great , the mutton mash tasted a little on the sweeter side but the salli won all our hearts, is a must try here.
For mains we picked up dishes from the bohri section , MUTTON MASOOR PULAO WITH SARKI , a lentil rice with chopped mutton and served with sarki which is yogurt based soup was quite good. CHICKEN DAL CHAWAL PALIDU was a similar preparation with palidu which is a lentil based curry with mashed vegetables mainly bottlegourd and drumsticks was average . DABBA GOSHT CHICKEN was baked chicken , had to be tatsy due to presence of good amount of cheese. CHICKEN IN CASHEW GRAVY was a very dissapointing , 4-5 tiny chicken cubes in a tasteless gravy made of raw cashew paste , would not suggest this at all. The mains failed to impress us as much as the other courses.
The desserts HALWA , KAJU PAK and SHAHI TUKDA were again awesome , all of them! While my friends like the kaju pak more , my pick was the halwaüëå

If I had gone by the reviews in Zomato and left this restaurant out , I would have been a fool. Firstly one must understand what is Bohri cuisine , if you cannot then go with a blank head like me, simple. Do not try to draw parallels with Mughlai or Punjabi food , or else you would be disappointed .Bohri is less spicy , subtle yet flavorful cuisine. Anyway my family loved it , we chose malai salli seekh kebab, dabba gosht , mutton haleem ,chicken in coriander, kachumbar(try it!) , butter naan, baked kaju pak and sitaphal creamy delight in dessert. The decor is no show off , staffs are courteous , great for family eat outs, they have great offers too. The only reason i am giving a 4/5 is the quantity, the pricing and the quantity needs to be balanced .
Btw we saw a Bohra family dining at the joint, so i guess its a good indication !

I am disappointed with this place. The food is not at all satisfactory. The naan, tandoori roti and laccha paratha, are almost the same type. Not much difference among them. Just that the tandoori had some butter over it which was served as butter naan. The chicken preparations were blunt. The ambiance is good and it is a cozy place though.

Being a hardcore foodie i like to explore different places for different types of foods.like that way when i heard about this particular joint known as ‚ÄúSalt‚Äù i was really excited. a small joint which has 25-27 seater located in near Keyatala road, opposite Nazrul Manch,Golpark. this place is famous for their Mughlai,Biryani and for the none other than Persian foods. they decorated this place such an wonderful way with the combination of white & green. ambiance of the place is very nice. i and my fellow foodie friends are invited there over a food tasting session. we started with very famous & authentic starters,

For our post sem mandatory meet up, my friends and I came here to have lunch. Our original plan was to go to Kimli. But finding it closed, we had to change our plan. This place is located on the second right from Bijoli Grill if you are coming from the Golpark side. On entering the restaurant, our eyes felt peaceful taking in all the green and white colours. They made for a pretty soothing background. The ambience was real nice and quiet. But coming to the food, we were really disappointed. We were looking to try the Bohri cuisine but somehow they didn't taste good to our Bengali tastebuds. We ordered Butter nun, Chicken Hyderabadi, Chicken in cashew sauce and Haleem. At this point before going into details, I would like to mention that the service was extremely slow. We had to wait for over a hour to be served even though there was no rush. The servers were a bit negligent of the customers. We had to call them twice for basic things like water. Coming to the food, the butter nun was a bit rubbery, but manageable. Chicken in cashew sauce tasted completely bland and seemed like some pieces of boiled chicken has been dipped into cheese and served. The Haleem was really terrible. It was actually a khichdi with only two pieces of meat. It had absolutely no seasoning. Their only redeemable part was the Chicken Hyderabadi. It was really awesome. It was finger-licking good. The Chicken Hyderabadi was the only good part in our lunch. The whole thing cost 890 bucks or so. They gave us a handwritten bill.

P.S. They even didn't bring our wash bowls untill we asked.

Salt is a cosy place with a great ambience. Its a perfect place for foodies and those who loves to try out new cuisines. It mostly specialises on Bohri Cuisine.... It has an innovative approach rather a healthier approach towards mughlai delicacy like lachcha paratha and tandoori roti. Masoor pulao, salli kabab and of course baked kaju pak is a must try out. My personal favourite except the mentioned is Chicken Reshmi Masala.  If you have a sweet tooth you must try out the deserts that Salt offers.  You won't find out this type of deserts in normal restaurants... I just want to thank the chefs for providing us with such mouth watering dishes and wanna wish the salt team all the best for their future ahead.... üòäüòäüòçüòçüòçüòäüòä

Southern avenue has surely got some gems tucked away in the bylanes and corners. Having seen this one being raved about by foodies recently I just had to be there asap coz as far as my knowledge goes this is the only restaurant serving Bohri cusinise in Kol. For me food is all about experiencing the different intricacies of the cuisines, the blending of spices, the transformation of ordinary dishes to extraordinary at the hands of the chef... Well u get my point. So even after a heavy downpour I made it a point to visit this place . It's a tiny establishment situated at keyatala road with a simple Green and white colored basic theme imaprting a classy yet minimalistic decor.

Food is okayish. Well it's quite different from what we are used to. The starter had to be Malai salli kebab which was average in taste in stark contrast to my Oh- so-foodgasmic expectation!! Nevertheless for main course we ordered Dal chawal palidu and Mutton pulao with sarki. The 2nd one was an absolute disaster. The quantity of chicken and Mutton in both the dishes was shamelessly low which did very little to enhance the taste of the dishes. Inspite of asking the waiter he suggested two dishes which were almost similar in texture, taste and even ingredients which somehow marred the whole dining experience. In desserts only halwa was available which we didn't want. So overall a very very average experience inspite of high expectations.

Service was slow. I personally felt this place is under staffed. There was a group of 12 elderly ladies and most of the waiters were busy serving them and we even had to ask for our glasses to be refilled and our food to be served. Moreover Dessert section was the the biggest turn off factor. What is the use of incorporating dishes in the menu of a restro which boasts of a special cuisine and then not being able to serve anything other than plain halwa!!

I guess everyone has their bad days and this is one of them. I still have high expectations from this place and would return sometime to give it one more try.

Have you ever tried Bohri cuisine?? You haven't even heard of that??? Then this is your destination!!!
The only restaurant in Kolkata that serves authentic Bohri dishes...

An invite for dinner from the owner for Panch Phoron group brought us here. It's located near golpark, opposite najrul manch; more precisely, exact opposite to somnath hall.

The monotony of clean white decor is broken by fluorescent green. It can accommodate around 20 people at a time. One corner of the restaurant has been covered with fluorescent green veil where a family can sit and enjoy their food in privacy which reflects the basic of Bohra community i.e. eating together.

Bohra Muslim community is a group of Shia Muslim and the speciality of their cuisine is being less spicy. Before the beginning of meal, everyone is made to wash hands with a special pot-and-bowl type equipment named chelamchi.

The items we were served -
Snacks -
1. Malai Salli Kebab Chicken - Chicken seekh kebab coated with thin crispy batter was soft and tasty. It was served with salad and tomato ketchup.
2. Samosa Mutton - Samosas are made with filling of cooked spicy minced mutton, spring onions, coriander leaves and mint leaves. The coating is very thin and crispy.

Main course -
1. Haleem (Bohri-style) - It is a creamier variety that is subtly spiced, unlike the spicy Hyderabadi variety, which uses turmeric. The spices used are whole (tej, clove, tejpatta, black pepper) and a bit of garam masala to round off the kick from the whole spices. The creaminess comes from the milk that is added instead of water while stirring and beating the grains. Fried onions, mint and lemon are condiments, without which it would be deemed incomplete. Soft mutton pieces were perfectly cooked and appetizing.

2. Tandoori Laccha paratha - Soft paratha went perfectly with Hyderabadi chicken.

3. Hyderabadi chicken - It is rich in flavours and spices unlike Bohri recipe. Chicken was soft and tasty.

4. Dal chawal pallidu chicken - A very unique dawoodi bohra dish made on happy occasions. A layer of rice and tur dal and chicken served along with gravy made of besan with bottlegourd & drumsticks. The tur Dal is flavoured with tempering made of Curry leaves,fried onions and cumin seeds.

5. Mutton masoor Pulao & Surki - Layers of masoor dal, rice and mutton cooked with garam masala, coriander leaves,onions & yoghurt. This scrumptious one-dish meal is traditionally served with surki which is a cold soup made with the water of boiled tur dal, Dalia powder, chopped spring onions.

6. Dabba gosht mutton - Baked dabba gosht with mutton stock's white sauce, macaroni, mutton
& Vegetables is a scrumptious casserole dish and a must try.

7. Coriander masala green chicken gravy - It's a must try over here. Boneless Chicken pieces well marinated with spices and cooked with coriander paste and tasted amazing.

Biriyani -
1. Mutton Biriyani - Bohra mutton Biriyani is a bit light on spices. It uses whole garam masala with mutton pieces, finely chopped onions, large cubes of potato. Biriyany was served with fried crisp onions and coriander leaves on top. Mutton was soft and well balanced on spices and the whole dish was delectable.

2. Chicken Biriyani - Bohri Chicken biriyani is again very light on spices. It has no plums and no tomatoes, yet it is a delicious and simple biriyani to relish.

Dessert -
Halwa - The halwa is prepared with dry dates and almonds, pistachios & cashews and has a grainy texture. It is actually named as kharak halwa. It is well balanced on sweetness and extremely ambrosial.

Overall it was an amazing experience and especially because it was the first time I tried this Bohri cuisine. Service was prompt.

As a foodie I always love to try something new dishes, though in Kolkata options are limited, but some new food joints are opened in Kolkata last couple of years and they serve some unique foods of different origin. One of them is ‚ÄúSalt‚Äù located in Keyatala road near Golpark. They serve delicious Bohri cuisine.
I really don‚Äôt have any clue about bohri cuisine. After some search in google I came to know that, Bohra Cuisine originated in Yemen, later spread into India, Pakistan and others Middle East countries. In India Bohras mainly settled in Gujrat, so there is a huge Gujrati influence in their cuisine.  More than many Indian Muslims, the Bohras have retained customs from their Hindu past‚Äîan attitude that extends to their cuisine and results in extraordinary amalgamations. Traditionally bohri food is eaten using all five fingers, preferably of the right hand and avoid uses of spoon and fork. Bohras have strict no-wastage policy so not a single morsel should be left on the thaali when it is taken away. It‚Äôs a tradition for Bohras to take a pinch of salt to start the meal. Every meal starts and ends with taking a grain of salt which is believed to clear the taste bud and cure many diseases. The Bohras have a wide variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian rice mixes for their main course. But interestingly, the first course is usually a dessert in bohri cuisine.

The place is nicely decorated specially the combination of green and white colour is very interesting and catchy. The ambiance was very peaceful with comfortable seating arrangements. I and my fellow foodie friends visited there for a bloggers meet and try some of their best dishes. The preparation was very unique, it‚Äôs a type of Mughlai food but it is different form as usual Mughlai we had in Kolkata. In the starter we had,

Chicken Malai Salli Kebab- A unique kebab preparation. Minced chicken marinated with different spices and put into wooden skewers. Later dipped in a batter and fried in oil. The kebabs were very soft and juicy, full of taste. The outside was crispy.  It will melt in your mouth in no time. Very different from as usual kebabs we had. Try it with sauce. 

Mutton Samosa- Samosa stuffed with minced mutton. Mouth-watering snacks. Very crispy and delicious. 

After the starter we tried some main courses and side dishes and stared with,  

Haleem Bohri Style- Hallem is a very famous preparation, especially during Ramadan many Mughlai restaurant prepare hallem. Haleem is made of wheat, barley, mutton, lentils and spices. This dish is slow cooked for seven to eight hours, which results in a paste-like consistency, blending the flavours of spices, meat, barley and wheat. It is very delicious as well as healthy. They added fried onion from top and lemon juice for taste boostup. Bohri style hallem is not very different in taste as compared with normal hallem.  

Mutton Masoor Pulao & Sarki- It is unique dish, but very famous in Bohri cuisine. It is actually a full course meal made with rice, minced mutton and masoor dal. A three layered pulao, preparation. Served with fried onions. Try this preparation with Sarki. Sarki is a soup made with yogurt.  It is taste like buttermilk. A unique combination.

Dabba Gosht Mutton ‚Äì One of the best mutton dish I ever had. Small pieces of mutton are cooked slowly in a creamy coconut and poppy seed gravy. The mutton was very soft. The creamy gravy was too good. Try it with parathas. It is one of the signature dish of Salt. A must try. They served it in a square size pot topped with sliced tomatoes and cucumber.   

Coriander Masala Green Chicken Gravy ‚Äì Boneless chicken pieces cooked with different herbs, spices and coriander and later mixed with coriander gravy. Chicken pieces were very soft and juicy and flavourful. The mixture of coriander masala and other spices with chicken was really good. The coriander gravy was not very spicy but very delicious. Try this preparation with parathas. 

Hyderabadi Chicken ‚Äì Another gravy item. It is a spicy gravy preparation with small pieces of chicken curry which is simply delicious in taste. Chicken pieces were cooked into a thick gravy, made with tomatoes and different spices and herbs. It was very flavourful. Served with grated cheese all over it. You can have it with any kind of naan and parathas. The taste was simply amazing. 

Apart from that we also had Mutton Biryani and Chicken Biryani. Both biryanis were brilliant. Came with a big size potato and a nicely cooked big pieces' of mutton and chicken. Very flavourful and delicious. The same old biryani we always love to eat. 

We also had a dessert,

Halwa ‚Äì Made with suji, ghee and sugar. Served with almonds, cashew and raisins. It was dry and very delicious. 

Our overall experience is really good. If you never try Bohri cuisine then you need to visit Salt. You will a get a unique taste of foods. I definitely recommend this place to those who always try to taste something new. The quality and quantity both are good and the pocket pinch is also very justified as long as quality concern. The staffs are friendly, humble and welcomed us very nicely. Delicious moments. Had a great time with

this place is one of the cosiest and quietest restaurant in this area. The ambience is good. The staff is extremely helpful and quite amicable. The dishes were lovely. Good in terms of taste and quantity. Personally I would prefer a bit more spicy.

I didn't think that there was very much room to improve on Mughlai cuisine in Calcutta, but Salt successfully has! Their Chicken Salli kebab & Kaju Pak were excellent, and the Mutton Shami Kebb & Chelo kebab (entree) were pretty good too. Different & distinctive ‚úÖ!

The decor was cool and refreshing. For starters we ordered Lemonade, Burhani and Malai Salli Kabab Chicken. The Kebab tasted really good. For the mains we had Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Reshmi Masala, Naan and Mutton Masoor Pulao & Sarki. They all tasted yumm ... especially the tandoori chicken which was the most flavoured and tender I have had so far.For the desserts we had Seasonal Halwa, Firni and Shahi Turka.Firni tasted the best among them. A great experience. Would love to visit again.

We have heard of this place ...And wanted to try the  biriyani
Few days me and my friend decided to visit this place 
SALT is located just opposite Nazrul Manch and it's easily accessible.

We ordered 2 Chicken biriyani only 
Frankly speaking the biriyani had a unique taste which I had never came across!!

And the pricing was also reasonable
Ambience was also good
Overall It was  very good.
Everyone should try out the place üòã!

Situated in keya tala road lanes, this beautifully Decorated restaurant will give you possitive vibes once you get in. They have a limited variety of menu, Bohri cuisine‚Äã being their best. Overall the food was really nice, specially the Hydrabadi chicken which i liked the most with the mutton musoor polaw and sarki! Would highly recommend this if you want to give your taste buds a break from chineese.

This place is Situated near the Southern Avenue main road in the lane just opposite to the Nazrul Manch. The decor of the place is well and good and it is a relatively small place which can seat around 20 people at a go. This place serves Bohri cuisine which is a mix of the Muslim and Persian cuisines. Most of the items were good to taste specially the Green Coriander Chicken. The biriyani was also decent enough and trying this unusual cuisine for the first time felt a good choice. Overall a decent place which can definitely be given a try and the pricing is also relatively reasonable.

We went there yesterday night .The restraunt is a small one but with excellent eye soothing green and white decor.i had read the reviews in Zomato and was excited to taste a new cuisine in kolkata..Their speciality is in Bohri cuisine.We ordered Chicken Malai Salli Kebab as starters ..They were really good in taste .For my 3 year old daughter we ordered corn salad but the corn in the salad taste like they were not fresh. Then we ordered Egyptian Mutton ,which was unique in taste but there where 4 tiny pieces of mutton, the peices were really disappointing..But the gravy taste great...Then we ordered Masoor Mutton Pulao with Sarki...This Pulao does not go with our pallette ,may be some people will like it..But I was expecting  something else...They don't have Bohri Biriyani which would be good to add in the menu...The Pulao consist of again 4 tiny mutton pieces with tarka like Dal in layer with Batista at top..However the best part was the desert..Baked Kaju Pak was out of the world...Khara Halwa and faluda was too good...It was a nice experience ..You can try it...But they have limited staff of 2 person...But the service person behaviour was very good

Located in Keyatala Road off Southern Avenue, Salt is a Bohri cuisine based restaurant. First of its kind in Kolkata, I decided to take my friends for a taste of our cuisine.

Simple ambience and decor with a corner for the traditional Bohra Thaal to be kept.

We ordered Chicken Malai Salli Kabab and Kharak (Dates) Halwa (you won't find it in the menu)

The Salli kabab is a long seek with a stick in between which is fried. It tasted yumm.

My friends, who are not much fond of sweet dishes, freaked out over the Kharak Halwa. Its super delicious.

What disappointed us was the a couple of items like Noodle Patties were not available.

Nonetheless, a good experience and great hospitality.

Salt is a new entrant in the Mughlai dishes and rare one with Bohri cuisine. It opened up before Durga Pujas of 2016 in the quaint Keyatala road that connects Southern Avenue (opposite Nazrul Manch) and Purna Das Road.

Food:
The Biriyani is very dry and bland to my taste. Some health conscious foodies like the preparation but I miss that divinity. The regular kababs tastes fair. What I particularly liked is the Chicken Tandoori. That was really great. Tried their special tandoori roti which was OK.

Ambience:
A shade of green and white makes a simple but elegant ambience. The restaurant is small one with around a capacity of 20 guests to jam it. However, they miss the popularity yet so it remains pretty empty. Now I have a problem with empty restaurants. Food is perishable. So there are chances that the food served will be stale or lived long in a refrigerator.¬† However, I did not face this issue with Salt in my rare encounter.

Service:
They are willing to please the guests. That is a very positive attitude. There are and will be areas of improvement as they start serving more guests and feel motivated.

We were eager to try Bohri cuisine for the first time and this place was on our wish list. To begin with, we loved the decor of this restaurant. The staff were very courteous and guided us very well.¬† We started with chicken malai salli kebab and virgin mojito. The kebab melted in mouth and was awesome in taste. For the main course, we ordered dal chawal pallidu mutton, served with sarki and nimboo achar. The rice dish was nicely prepared, aromatic and tasted great. Sarki, a close realtive of cucumber raita, was refreshing. The nimboo achar complemented really well. We ended our meal with baked kaju pak and 
house special halwa. Both were winners. Overall, We came out with a great experience. This place definitely deserves a visit from all the food-lovers.
P.S. We were too busy eating to take any photograph of the place and the dishes.

This quaint little outlet is located in Golpark. It serves Bohri cuisine, which is light and tasty. Some preparations are really unique in taste and must try. Though you have to wait a long for the meal to appear, but the wait is worth it. Given the quantity and quality, Salt is pocket friendly. The restaurant is worth a visit if you want to explore something different in Kolkata

This is a quaint little place tucked away in southern Avenue.  The fresh green and white decor is such a welcome sight.  Authentic Bohri cuisine is their speciality we sampled the Dal chawal palidu in chicken but it was a bit salty for my taste buds.  We also tried some chicken kebabs and they were juicy and tasty.  The staff is courteous and service is easy.  Worth a one time visit.

This is one place that I was longing to visit as I love Bohri Muslim food . The food is fragrant and divine .
For starters we had Dal Samosa , one piece was burnt. And hollow without any dal filling . We reached the place  around 1.10 pm on a Sunday afternoon but the service was abysmal and pathetic . We were the only ones present in this tiny restaurant and moreover the menu was preplanned by our host as it was a special celebratory lunch . In spite of the pre decided menu we had to wait for almost 30 minutes between each course . We were just a small group of 5 people .The other starter was a Malai Salli Kebab Chicken . It was tasty and we gobbled it off so fast as we were ravenous.  Our next course included Paneer masala ( so so ) , a dal Makhani ( tasty ) , Egyptian mutton ( yummy ) and a Chicken in cashew gravy ( tasty ) . This was followed by a fragrant and yummy rice called Mutton Masoor Pulao and Sarki . The sweet ending was in the form of a date halwa , which was not too oily neither too sweet , suitably embellished with dry fruit .
The lemonade came after ages with room temperature water , its summer guys and you don't even have ice !!
We were given some excuses at the end of the meal by the manager who apologised for the abnormal delays between each meal , thou it was a pre ordered menu !!!
No excuses dude in the service industry !!!
The surroundings are a bit bland with too much of " go green " .

On our target list for quite some time... specifically for their Bohri Cuisine which is not so much in vogue in Kolkata

Recommended for -

Burhani (the perfect opener & an absolute necessity during our sultry summers)
Samosa Mutton (the Bohri starter, very delectable though the mutton stuffings could've been more)
Mutton Nehari (My pick... has that nice homemade flavour)
Falooda with Ice cream 

All in all a nice & cozy plc, very competitively priced although the portions can be better....

Simple and elegant decor. Good color combination coming from the background they are trying to portrait about Bohri and Parsi culture. Both white, green are quite soothing colors. My childhood was spent in Daman, a Parsi and Portuguese territory in South of Gujarat. After say 18-19 years i had bohri dishes. Nevertheless it brought back old memories. 

Now coming back to the food, the Bohri cuisine is very diff from the regular mughlai ones we are accustomed to so clear your head before you eat. 
E.g They enjoy yoghurt based curry, may be we Bengali dont. The flavours are mild but some of us want spicy. So if you find the cuisine indifferent then dont term it bad. Its an another world.

Now we ordered Mutton Malai kebab, Malai chicken kebab, Dal chawal palidu chicken and Mutton masooru pulao with sarki and Dabba Gosht. Also had burhani as customary after meal digestive drink. All of them nicely done. The mutton malai kebab being the highlight. Dabba gosht was lil let down. Skip it. 
Mutton masoori pulao was very good. 
N.B. All though the dishes are very light, they are high on food value with all the pulses and meat. So order accordingly. We were like very full after having not quite much of food in terms of volume. 

My humble request would be bring in more dishes from that region (which also includes mkre Parsi dishes) and also sweets and confectionery items too.

Definite visit.

Yesterday noon visited this restaurant near southern avenue with a friend for lunch.

We reached by 3:15 pm & it was empty. We sat & ordered Chicken tandoori, mutton special biriyani & mutton korma. They recommended us to try one of their speciality burhani ghol.

I personally didn't like that ghol.(2.5/5)
Chicken tandoori was hot n spicy, it was good.(3.7/5)
Mutton special biriyani & korma weren't excellent, but were okay.(3.3/5)

You can try it for having a good & quick meal at a pretty reasonable price. Prices in the menu are inclusive of taxes.

I really liked their simple and beautiful interior. The staff, serving us was a bit slow, but at the end of the day, I have no complaint. It was a good experience.

The easiest way to reach this place is through Southern Avenue Keyetala road.Salt is the most important taste maker of food and this place has validated it's epithet by offering some truly tasty and delicious delicacies.But what made me more surprised is the presence of hand sanitisers on every table, showing a notion of care for their customers.A very beautiful place. A perfect harmony of colours. Sitting in the restaurant is such a soothing experience. Food is tasty and reasonably priced. Service is very good. Staff behaviour is very warm. I loved this place. I recommend everyone to visit this place for quick bites.

What could be a better occasion to try a new restaurant and a new cuisine other than your parent's 23rd wedding anniversary? Had read about "Salt" in a newspaper tabloid last year and after that I had made up my mind that i have to come here. What "Salt" can boast about is their introduction of the Bohri cuisine to Kolkata's food trail and also for being one of the many restaurants in our city run by women entrepreneurs. Now coming to my experience. We reached the place without any trouble since it's located in one of the most popular food trails of Kolkata, Southern Avenue. The restaurant is made up all in greens and whites starting from the tables, chairs, drapes and everything. We settled in a small round table surrounded with drapes so that we could have some privacy. Coming to what we ordered-
For starters we had chicken reshmi kebab and chicken hariyali kebab. Both the kebabs where really tender and juicy and tasted really good.
For the mains we ordered tandoori roti, veg pulao, chicken biryani, mutton rezala and chicken in cashew gravy. The veg pulao was cooked to perfection and so was the mutton rezala. The portions are a bit small but it was quite ok for us. The chicken in cashew gravy was a part of their Bohri menu and i just loved it.
For dessert we order a shahi tukra, halwa and a baked kaju Pak. Being a dessert person myself i always look forward to the end of every meal and this time i was more than satisfied. All the dishes had a very moderate sugar content ( which is a thumbs up for me) and yet was super tasty. The halwa is what i liked the best.
So the food was amazing, starters to dessert.  Whenever we think of Indian food we always picture it as a rich cuisine which is generally heavy on your tummy. But here at Salt the food was so light yet so tasty as if someone had made it at home.
The staff was also very courteous.
So we had a very nice time here at Salt and hope to visit again soon.
Happy Dining Peeps :)

The place isn‚Äôt very big, but has been done up tastefully, in green and white, without much unnecessary clutter. The gracious hosts had planned to present their signature Bohri dishes in the gigantic Thaal to us, something that all of us were new to. The Thaal is basically a huge platter, filled with a large number of dishes, both sweet and savoury, meant to be shared and eaten together by a group. Here at Salt, it can be customised to contain the various dishes from their menu, in varying quantities. It should preferably be for a minimum of five people to share, for which the minimum per head cost will be around 500 INR.

Another very interesting thing about Bohri eating which I found out was that unlike how we have always been taught to have the desserts last, here the sweet and the savoury are to be alternated to keep changing the taste. Suits me perfectly, I had thought, when I came to know, as it meant that I won‚Äôt have to wait for desserts while constantly reminding myself to leave some tummy space for sweet endings.

I tried a great many of their signature dishes. And most of them were so unique that it would be futile to try and describe those. My favourite was undoubtedly the big bowl of Mutton Haleem. Haleem is served in only a handful of restaurants in Kolkata, that too only for a few days around Eid festivities. So it being a part of the regular menu here was a delight for me. Also, the viscous, almost pasty Haleem is nothing like anything I have had before in the city. Second in the line of my favourites was the Murg Malai Salli, a skewered kebab with a fluffy egg washed exterior, which somehow reminded me of our good, old Kobiraji Cutlet. Another dish definitely worthy of mention was the Daal Chawal ‚Äì Palidu Chicken. It was a layered rice dish with daal and chicken folded inside the layers, and topped with crispy, caramelized onions. Of the sweets, the Date Palm Hales was my hero, and I couldn‚Äôt resist going for one spoonful after another of it üòö.

Salt is one place which I will visit again and again. And would also recommend it to anyone who cares to listen. Especially if one is looking for a budget meal with family or for something the country hasn‚Äôt tasted much before.
                                          ...

This is the only outlet in Kolkata serving "Bohri Thaal" which is their speciality. 
Location- Take the lane next to Fillers then at the end of the lane turn left.
Bohris are a Gujarati Muslim community which believes that a family bonds over food, so they serve food in a customized thaal. You have to pre order the thaal , minimum for 4 ppl. 
Pocket Pinch- It's approximately 500 per person for the thaal.
The day we tried the thaal there was Salli kabaab, Egyptian chicken curry, nehari, Palidu,2 types of samosa, whole chicken roast, haleem, shir Kurma and Halwaa. They also served strawberry Bloosms, pineapple bloosm,mojhito,tuti fruity.
Apart from the thaal one can also try items from their regular menu.
We thank Team Salt for the invitation and will drop in soon.
This is not only food, this is experience.

First I ordered for
 Mutton Samosa - it was perfect, crunchy outside & packed with flavours inside

Mutton kasha - extremely good. A must try

Biryani - typical Bohri Biryani (a must try) something different than usual.

Salt had been on my wishlist for a long time.¬†I wanted to visit this and somehow got a chance to hold a bloggers meet here as well (I did dine in before too). It is currently the only restaurant in Kolkata which is serving Bohri Cuisine and Bohri Thaal. I had been privileged to visit this with other fellow foodie bloggers and to eat in the exact same way the ‚ÄòThaal‚Äô is eaten. When we first entered Salt, i was quite mesmerised with the decor. The purdah style¬†Thaal eating area and the usual dine-in with bright lights and white/green decor mesmerized my eyes.¬†There is a lot about Salt and lot about Bohri Cuisine which i will be stating down below.¬†The first question which hits the mind is what is a Bohra Community? In simpler terms, they are Gujarati Muslims and are said to have migrated from Yemen to Gujarat. They believe in the concept that ‚ÄòThe family that eats together stays together‚Äô (I too¬†believe it is right). Second thing which comes in the mind is ‚ÄòWhat is a Thaal‚Äô? In simpler terms, it is a large flat plate where the meal is served.

After hearing good reviews about their specially served Bohri cuisine.Couldnt wait to actually go and pay them a visit.Went there on a Sunday to find it more or less vacant.The ambience is neat and has hints of green and white but feels homely,nothing to complain about.As the food was served we really fell for the uniqueness of the food and we really liked their kebabs and biriyani which was on the lighter side but tasted really well.

The only place in Kolkata which serves Bohri cuisine. Bohri cuisine mixes Persian, Iranian and Indian cuisine with an aesthetic and philosophy all of their own.
Bohris are a Gujarati Muslim community who believes that eating from the same plate or thaal increases bonding and love.Thus the concept of eating together in a thaal.
There is an ornate and enamelled "chelamchi lota" where one needs to wash hand before eating. There is an alteration between the Khaaras and the Mithaas in this cuisine. Khaaras means the spicy portion and Mithaas is the sweet aspect. In the food tasting session we had ample of both. We were served
Kachumber salad and corn salad at the sides.
Daal samosa are small triangular samosas which can be filled with both veg and non veg stuffings. I liked them. The Parantha was crisp and flaky to be had with Mutton Nihari. The Nihari looked a little spicy than I have tasted earlier but absolutely great to have.
The Egyptian Mutton Curry melts in the mouth with the base note of cashew. Surprisingly cashew paste doesn't make it sweet. The Stuffed Chicken (Stuffing made of rice and dry fruits) is amazing and highly recommended. The chicken Malai Salli Kebabs were one of the major highlights for me and one which is heavily recommended. The slow cooked Haleem was divine and also a must have. The Daal Chawal Palidu(Rice layered with Chicken served with Daal) is unique in its taste and the accompanying Dal is delicious.
In the Dessert section we had Shir Kurma, the Date Palm Halwaa, Strawberry Blossom and Pineapple blossom to drink and also Tuti Fruity ice creams. The Shir korma and date palm Halwaa are nothing I have ever eaten and were divine.
Absolutely recommended if you are smart enough to overlook that the place is small. However the soothing interiors will make you rested. Saurabh Rana Luna Chatterjee (Madly_Food_Lover) Devpurna Talapatra

Bohra/Bohri is a very small community in Kolkata and so people know less about them and their cuisines. They are originally from Gujarat.Traditionally, they have been traders and most of them have the suffix 'wala' in their last name to designate either their ancestral trade or their ancestral village.  There are hardly few thousand people in Kolkata so it is obvious people know less about their culture and food habits. This week I went to the newly opened Salt restaurant (near gol park) and enjoyed my lunch. The food that I had were 1 plate each of Malai Salli kebab (served on the stick), Egyptian mutton curry , Tandoori lachha paratha,Mutton Masoor pulao and  finally dry date halwa. The malai Salli kebab is the best right now in Kolkata-amazingly made and melts in mouth, Before this I never ever had such amazing Salli kebabs in Kolkata at least, the lachha paratha is very soft and very less oily unlike other places and it can be savoured with the Egyptian Mutton Curry. 
Now I wanted something in rice and lo there came the hot and good to look at dish called Mutton Masoor Pulao- it was just WOW!!! This is one dish which I would suggest everyone to taste in this restaurant if one wants to enjoy a Bohra dish. 
Now time to seal it with sweet memories so as a desert had dry date halwa-perfect for those who can't have much of sweet dish at the end as already you are loaded with heavy meals(but amazingly light). This was also very good and perfect with less sweetness. 
Finally I had one of the most amazing lemonade I ever had and served too in a very novel way-you have to go and see it. This was very refreshing and acted as a digestive too at least for meüòä.
The decor is very soothing with a dash of soothing green and reflective white everywhere. There are couple of Bohra utensils too displayed for those who want to know little more about the community and the owner is all enthusiastic to share it with vivid detail. The staffs are very polite and respectful to customers but would suggest the owner to make them little more trained in servicing as in today's world people go as it looks from outside (though am not bothered about it), I guess time to serve can be lessened by just 5 more minutes , if possible play some soft music as it would make customers happy and don't think about waiting time.......enjoy !!!!

Enjoyed a gala feast in salt . The  Bohri cuisine was one of its kind in Kolkata . The thali they serve is awesome. The very traditional way of hand wash to the serving .Everything was very good..worth the penny!

I really wanted to rate this restaurant good but I can't think of a single thing why it should deserve a point.
Yes, the interior of the restaurant looks amazingly good with an all-green-theme but the food is the most important thing in a restaurant and they drastically fail on that! And after that comes their equally horrible service.
Staffs are well mannered but they memorize your order rather than taking a note of it which results in them bringing a completely different dish to your table. They brought either the Shammi Kebab Mutton or the Malai Salt Kebab Chicken instead of our Chicken Seekh Malai. We had waited from 4:30 to 5:15 till we finally got to take a bite, although they had apologized for the delay.

Chicken Seekh Malai of Salt is, honestly, THE WORST KEBAB I'VE HAD IN MY LIFETIME! What WAS it? They should've named it the "Cardamom Kebab"! Even in my hungriest hour, I failed to swallow that disgusting piece of creation. You'll get a cardamom seed in EVERY bite and it will ruin your taste, your appetite and your mood beyond your imagination. It was THAT bad! I never waste food and I did it here for the first time.
For main course, we ordered a Chicken and a Mutton Biryani. My chicken one had a weird smell. The mutton wasn't soft enough. The biryani was dry, not the way I personally prefer. Many people might like it considering it's less oily.

They don't charge extra for tax which is a good thing. But they should really improve on their food otherwise if they continue to serve such bad food in a market where there's so much competition, they won't last too long!

I & my NRI Son-in-law went there for Lunch on 18thJan'17. We wanted to have a bite on BOHRI delicacies ( Persian ) as they are mostly forgotten & lost as their community is reduced . So , we ordered for as starter 1) Malai Salli ( stick- in old Bengali it is called Sola ) Kabab Chckn. Great Prpn. but less of a Malai, 2) Fish Kabab ( N'Indian Prpn.) but very tasty , ( my opinion is it could've been little more Juicy instead of so much dry, probably Chef is not aware of Basting by Butter which is an essential process in Tandoor foods items) . Pls. take care of this. 3) Lemonade was served in good 1 Litr. Jar was excellently tasty . 4) Mutton Masoor Pulao & Sarki , it's a complete dish & to pour Sarki on every chank is ready to eat. It's an experience but in this so many good Mutton ( only small with bones 4 pcs almost lost in the heap, though we were told of boneless but they failed & these Mutton Pcs. are not done at all clearly shows they are miserable in Prpn. of Mutton delicacies, sad . Madam is an Institution of culinary classes , why such failure ? Not clear , similar failure of Mutton delicacies in previous  review I read . Is it your weakness Chef? Next time I'll be avoiding an Mutton Prpn. Surely. I'm a lover of Mutton & Fish items though. OK. ) 5) Baked Kaju Pak & Halwa ( Prpn. made mostly of Dates ) delicious & quite different . I loved it but the portion was bit less to the price paid. Will I get Nalli Gosht ( well tendered ?) & Nehari Gosht & Paya Trotters ? Not sure ? I shall give a call before .

We went to Salt after having heard of it from those who had been there before and having read about it in the newspapers. It did not disappoint at all. It's a restaurant that specialises in Bohri cuisine, something not often found in this city. The Malai Salli Kabab was succulent. The Mutton Masoor Pulao is a layered rice dish that's delectable and good enough for two people. We completed our meal with the subtly flavoured dates halwa,that had just the right amount of sweetness!

Dark horse for sure. Serves outstanding Bohri Cusine. Taken back by the warm and attentive service. Food quality is simply astounding. Exquisite food flavours indeed, Wondered why the management does not call it a speciality Bohri Cuisine restaurant.  Must try Dabba Gosht Chicken, Masoor Mutton Rice with Sarki, Coriander Green chicken masala, Mutton samosas, Chicken Biryani kolkata style with a elahi twist :) Tandoori pomfret. Prices visavis food quality is very reasonable. This place has to be tried.

Tucked away in a quiet, residential para in Keyatala, Salt is quite a hidden gem. The menu offers sumptuous dishes which are specialties of the Bohra cuisine, a unique cuisine with which Kolkata foodies may not be too familiar. It is a refreshing change from the same-old Chinese and Mughlai dishes, creating a fine balance between delicate flavours and non-oily food. The owners were hospitable and the prices quite reasonable. Overall, a must-try restaurant which scores high both on quality and hospitality. Good luck to Salt!

I have visited salt many times. Amazing food. One of the best biryanis and the musoor pulao is a hit here. The tandoor items are also well cooked, tender and tasty. Today the service was a bit slow because the restaurant has taken part in a food exhibition and had less workers but the wait was worth it after the delicious food was served....pocket friendly and great service. The owners are very friendly and interact with their guests and makes one feel comfortable. 
Good luck to team salt.‚ù§

Visited today after reading about it in the telegraph...  It has a unique interior, though not very spacious. But its soothing..  Coming to the food part.. We were not dissappointed at all... I would say they serve one of the best quality biriyanis in kolkata..  chicken Rashmi masala was wonderful.. And the desert.. We had the halua..  I suggest you to try it..its amazing..  The place is quite pocket friendly.. Just one last thing, the mutton of the biriyani can be made better..

Firstly i want to speak about the decor....its so eyesoothing that u can keep on staring for hours and feel at peace! The interiors are done very tastefully in green and white.we had chicken salli malai kebab( though it didnt have any malai in it),masoor mutton pulao with sarki,sitaphal creamy delight and pineapple blossom.chicken salli kebab had a coating of egg and it was quite crispy..liked it.now masoor pulao was a bit bland for my tastebuds.maybe its like that only but bohra cuisine is a first for me and me being an avid lover of spicy indian food it seemed to lack some spiciness to me.next the creamy delight was whipped cream with sitaphal infused in it and had a bit of tangent flavour ( but it seemed only to me,my friend didnt get it).anyways it was quite unique..i never had anything of the kind before.pineapple blossom was usual.At last they even gave us a bucket full of props for clicking pictures.Even they give the bill and mouris in royal looking pots..overall a pleasant experience!!
P.s..prices are quite low...and they dont even charge taxes.prices mentioned in the menu are inclusive of taxes.

Just dropped here suddenly. Was heading towards some other joint, when the name just attracted us. "Salt" an essential element in food. A lovely green and white decor, sensible use of colors on the wall, chairs, and even the cutleries. Coming to the cuisine - they have Persian and Mughlai dishes in the menu. You can choose some awesome Persian platter served in a huge brass thali. If you pre-order them¬†they arrange this platter for a group of 5 to 12 people. Chicken Cashew and Kababs are a must try if you are here along with their Bohri cuisines. ¬†The food was actually good my taste buds says they can make a mark soon. The way they served the Lemonade in mason jar keeping the theme of their decor in white and green was eye-catching. Wish Salt team best of luck.

I visited SALT last Tuesday (Dec 20th) & was welcomed with a refreshing and eye appealing White and Green decor. I was treated to a lavish spread of Bohri Thali & some of the delicacies served on that huge plate that you can't not eat when in SALT are their Stuffed Chicken, Shami kebab, Malai Salli kebab and Masoor Pulao. The dry date halwa & sitaphal delight was just what i needed to wind up my hearty meal.  I promised not to eat here soon if I still wanted to fit in my clothesüòÉ 
Well I haven't lived up to my promise as am practically drawn to this really cute & personalized eatery every second day ready to experiment their Menu. You must try their Lachha parathas, Biryani, Chicken Dabba gosh,  Hyderabadi chicken & Falooda. Even their simple fresh Lime soda tastes  heavenlyüòÉ
And all of this gastronomic delight is very easy and pleasant to the purse; you can't get it any better!

Today I had lunch at Salt (Keyatala)....The first thing that caught my eyes, was the decor....very uniquely done.We ordered for Lachha Paratha, Mutton Masoor Polao & Sarki, Chicken tikka kebab and Hyderabadi Chicken. Complementary was the drink and dessert ( Sitaphal creamy delight). The parathas were light and fluffy , not oily at all( like usual). Mutton Masoor Polao & Sarki was the winner....although I am not so fond of rice...but I loved the dish. Kebab was soft and nicely cooked. Dessert was also good. The food was delicious and hospitality was great. Price very much reasonable. Overall very satisfied...wish to visit again. Everyone must try...

I was at Salt a short while ago; and this wasn't my first visit to this cozy restaurant. What i had today was Tandoori Chicken and Laccha Paratha. The food as usual was served hot and was exceptionally tasty. According to me, this is a restaurant that undoubtedly gives you great value for money. I'll dine here again for sure. A must visit for all, if I may say so.

The first thing that catches your eye is the decor of the place. The entire restaurant is decorated in white and green. It is indeed very soothing to the eye. It is a neat and cosy little place. The ambience is very nice and the restaurant offers great hospitability.
Now coming to the food we ordered chicken kebab and paneer tandoori kebab for starters, followed by butter nun, dal makhani, jeera rice, paneer masala, chicken biryani and hyderabadi chicken. For dessert we had sitaphol ice cream.
The chicken kebabs were amazing. The butter nun was very soft. The biryani lacked salt and was not at par with the rest of the dishes. But the highlights of the entire meal were the hyderabadi chicken and the ice cream. I fell in love with the chicken dish. I have had this chicken dish at other restaurants before but hands down this version is the best. 
Also i have never been much fond of desserts but this special ice cream dish stole my heart. 
I highly recommend this place and can't wait to visit again.

Two days back visited Salt at Golpark for lunch. Salt came up on 5th of October and not even 1 month old ! Liked the d√©cor and the ambience.¬†Very neat and clean place with food served in good crockeries ¬†The food was awesome. We tried Kebabs,tandori chicken as starters,Mutton biriyani & Mutton Rezala as main course and Sitaphol as dessert . The Tandori Chicken was awesome and so was the Biriyani and the Rezala.But the final icing on the cake was the Sitaphol, as dessert, which was truly awesome.The place is pocket friendly as well¬†as three of us ended up spending just over Rs 1500 !!Looking forward to visit that place soon with more friends and colleagues .

New in town.. Got to know about this when we were searching every possible restaurant and came out with an answer of 2 hours of waiting... But luckily we got a seat for 6 here... As the set up is new so the ambiance is neat and clean. The table mats and the walls all are with the combination of two colors green and white. The best part is they also provide a hand sanitizer in each table so no need to search for washroom for washing your hand. ¬†But my only concerned is tables are so close to each other that one can get disturbed if the restaurant is full.. Though we are lucky that day it was not..Now coming to the food the options were limited which is justified they were just opened on 5th of October.. But as we were starving very much so we managed..¬†

We ordered for Chicken biriyani, Tandoori rotis n one chicken preparation (forgot the name)... Unfortunately the desert I was looking for (Chocolate brownie with ice cream) was unavailable... So we ordered for two deserts made up of Cashews (again forgot the name :P). But they serve us with a Complimentary brownie which I appreciate more... The price are pocket friendly though... Staffs were very attentive n courteous. We came out with a great experience... Looking forward for more visits.... :)
