This restaurant is located on top of hind cinema. It's a nice place to go to after a movie. The menu is an average menu. The preparation of most of the dishes were good. The stuffed mushrooms was an excellent dish and a must try.

Pleasantly surprised to find such a tip-top restaurant in this not so flashy neighborhood of Central Kolkata. The ambience is pretty decent. The food quality meets good standard. The overall service is very good and prompt. Liked the Mojito served here. Also had the Sangria, Pan Fried Chilli Fish, Honey Sesame Chicken and Murgh Reshmi Kabab. The quantity of chicken/fish you get for Rs. 250 a plate is quite a lot :) Overall pretty impressed.
One advice: they can do away with the high chair tables and replace with the more cozy sofas which are on one side.

Went there on 23rd Nov for some quick bite. This is located on the first floor of Hind Cinema. The entrance is very difficult to locate. But that‚Äôs the only blemish.
The ambiance, the food, the presentation... everything was splendid. We ordered steamed fried momo, red hot chicken drumstick and fresh lime soda. Each and every item stood out on its own. Highly recommended.

Authentic Chinese dishes. They have mainly two sections North Indian and Chinese but very less options to choose. Well decorated restaurant with proper seating and great ambiance created with great play list.  We Ware four people there attending dinner. Ordered three soups - Chiken wonton soup,  sweet corn soup,  and the other I forgot. Ordered Chiken in palm sauce and kung pao Chiken in main course stippled with mixed meat  schezwan rice. All these items were magnificent with proper spices. I wish I'll have another lunch there very soon.

Nice ambience with attractive decoration. We ordered 2 Heineken, Ice Berg Lagoon, Pan fried Chilli Fish, Butter Nan and Murg Makkhanwala.

‚ñ∂Ice Berg Lagoon contains lichi juice which was extra sweet. Still we enjoyed it for its look and ice cream on the top.
‚ñ∂Pan fried Chilli Fish was less spicy and no bell paper with it, not so good.
‚ñ∂Butter Nan was different in taste, like 'Luchi'.
‚ñ∂Murg Makkhanwala was medium spicy, tasted good but not like a Makkhanwala dish with is naturally a buttery sweet-spice item.

So, I'm little bit confused about their menu which are not tastes according to their names. Not satisfied very much as I expected.

Otherwise, stuffs are well behaved and our bill was approx. Rs1400.

Located inside the building of Hind Inox, this place is simple yet beautiful in its own way with blue furnitures and well lit ambience. 
Now coming to the food, 
For starters we ordered - 
~Kafir Lime Chicken Takrai
We decided to order thia because the name sounded promising but can't say the same about the taste. It was too sweet for our palate and honestly speaking that much sweetness is the only reason why the beautiful flavour of kafir lime couldn't mix of well with the flavour of the chicken and sauces. 
For the main course, we ordered-
~Chicken Malai Tikka in Shahi Gravy
It was great. Large chicken morsels in a thick and rich gravy, this dish was 'shahi' from all aspects and went perfectly with the butter naan. 
I had also ordered two rounds of Cocktail ~Long Island Iced Tea. They made it really well. The first time it tasted less alcoholic as they might have mixed the lemon juice a bit more but the second round tasted like how a classic LIIT should taste but cannot say didn't like the first round. It was also good. 
The staffs were courteous and the service was promt. 
I have high expectations from this place and would like to visit again to try other offerings on their menu card!

The restaurant in the heart of central Kolkata is a good place to have lunch or dinner, food is average but considering the pocket pinch and taste it's not that great. The ambience is pretty funky. The service is not at all good. Can visit this restaurant once but surely something not to die for. Kolkata have way better restaurants of the same category and with a budget friendly option

Pathetic service. We had ordered for Chinese food who has very average and had a lot of salt. The food had hair in it. The manager was the worst with no care for the needs of the customer. Refused to regulate the AC Temperature. The vegetables did not get served even after an hour of the noodles getting served.  In a restaurant that serves primarily chinese food at 8pm on a Sunday we were told that the noodles is over and it would be better of we cancel the order for parcel as it will take time in spite of saying we are ready to wait. The manager and waiters are extremely untrained and the food is below average.

As a foodie , I am always ready to get plunged into the restaurants and their food menu! And after many hide and seeks... I got this restaurant in zomato list! I dunno why this one isnot enlisted in the so called popular restaurants' list... but if i give you explanation about this..i hope u will like it a bit and will dare to give a try!

Direction : It is situated at chandni chowk...it is 5mins walk from chandni chowk metro station. Let me be clear abt it... it is attached to HIND INOX !

Ambience : well... the ambience is so nice...the entrance is filled with wallposters of filmy world nd d interior decor is so fine...u can see that in pictures..! They will play music to entertain you!

Service: the people and the management is so prudent .. they will interact with you with much decency...! And after giving orders... they served those chronologically within 10mins!

Price: as we went in puja days...the prices were hiked a bit. But alcohol was tax free! But if it is pocket pinch or not .. that depends on what you order!

Food menu:
We ordered chicken wanton soup,chicken lemon coriander soup as starter. Then main course included chicken schezwan fried rice, mixed meat schezwan fried rice,kung pao chicken,chicken in chilli plum sauce ! And lastly.. we were mad that we ordered chicken sweetcorn soup.. üòÇ
P.s - we had alcohol along wd this menu as in Signature, bira 91 blonde!
STARTER :
Chicken wanton soup includes sliced carrots,wanton,mushrooms,sliced cabbage,meat and chicken pieces..nd black pepper made it more tasty and spiced up...it was really delicious!

Chicken sweetcorn soup : it is sweet in taste...if u dont like sweet then dont go fr it.. cause i myslf dont like sweet soup ..but others do..! So they tasted it but i didn't taste it much.

The schezwan rice bowls were spiced up with meat,shrimps,mushrooms....it was also awesome to taste!
Kung pao chicken dish includes 8pieces of chicken pieces spiced up with cashew nuts and many spices which made the dish more tastier!
Chicken in chilli plum sauce includes sliced chicken pieces with diced and chopped onion pieces....itz taste is much different than kung pao chicken ...but it is also very nice!
Quality : the quality is really higher! If you want to have a taste of pure Chinese flavor... then this is it!! I didn't get chance to taste other cuisines but I am really satisfied with management! Will visit again!

Quantity : It is enough for two if you dont eat voraciously.. i mean if you are a big foodie!
P.s - they dont take extra charges if u book table!

Visited for the first time in the eve of Durga puja. It's in first floor of hind inox. Place was decent looking. Decoration was also good and charming. Music played was also good. In starter we ordered pan fried fish which was good then lemon chicken it was average. Stuffed mushrooms üçÑ were also pretty ordinary though it was a chef special menu and lastly lat mai chicken,it was also average. In main course we ordered mixed fried rice and the flavour was not good and mixed pan fried noodles was pretty average,it seems chowmin were floating in the gravy and it would be better if it served in a bowl üçö. In side dish fish in oyster sauce was good and Kung pao chicken was also average but better than the others. In dessert golab jamun with ice cream üç¶ was good, hot brownie with ice cream was average (brownie was not hot at all), toffee walnut with ice cream üç¶ was also average. In one word it was a average restaurant. And finally the staffs were very lazy and completely unprofessional. They took almost 45 mins too serve each dish and took almost 3hr 40min to complete the lunch. Not a good restaurant to visit again.

Visited here in a soshti afternoon. The behaviour of the staff were good. The mocktails & cocktails were good too. The issue was with their lamb starter. The meat wasn't tender..infact was so over-fried that it turned almost black and was even dripping with oil. The baby corn & honey sesame chicken was fine. Hope you guys will work on that..& think before you serve.

Expensive eating places in town... Its situated at Bowbazar located on the 1st
Floor or Hind Inox...
The restaurant has a cheesy entrance & covered with several Vintage Bollywood posters... Am damn pleased with the decor lights table chairs everything..
The ambience is just mind boggling...
Cantonese noodles mixed meet is simply a try some dish...the noodles were so tenderly cooked mouth full of flavours 
Kung pao chicken is also a well known dish...Service is well maintained..!! 
If ur planning a movie night or movie date den definitely u must pay a visit in the 1st floor ur gonna love it..!
Hoping to drop by sometime again..

The chicken sweet corn soup was nothing remarkable .We had the Two cuisines that it offers. The chicken butter masala was good. Starters were nice.We had Golden prawns, pan fried chilli fish and one chicken item. In the main dish we had mixed fried rice & kung pao chicken which were tasty. The chilli garlic chowmin was burning hot. The choice of music playing  was v trendy and contemporary. Overall good ambiance but average food experience

Masala Wok is one of the prettiest eating places in town. Set in the first floor of Hind Inox, this criminally under advertised (we had no idea about its existence until last week, when we accidentally discovered it after a movie date) restaurant has a chic entrance adorned by several vintage Bollywood posters. The ambiance changes inside where it is one long row of plush blue seats on both sides, with the ones on the right hand side overlooking the street.¬†

The menu is mostly standard Chinese and North Indian fare, reasonably priced and value for money quantity wise. We opted for a hazelnut coffee sparkle which was an inspired concoction of coffee and orange juice. The pan fried chilly fish, Cantonese noodles, Kung Pao chicken and Toffee Walnut with ice cream were all more or less tasty affairs. The staff were courteous and the service was fast.

¬†This is one place that deserves a chance, peeps.

Nice little place. Everything was well cooked. But I've tasted better food. Butter chicken  lacked the creaminess that is necessary in butter chicken! The chilli chicken was a bit too loaded with salt but that could be my personal taste. The naans were delicious though. Desserts were okay. Staff was very courteous, ambience pleasant. Not sure if I'll be eager to visit again but I appreciate the place.

Both tasted nice,specially the soup. They served the Manchow in a separate bowl which was good. In main course we had chicken fried rice, Cantonese Noodles mixed meat and Kung Pao chicken. I loved the noodles. Other delicacies were tasty. We tried three mocktails in which Iceberg Lagoon was pleasant. I personally did not liked the taste of Deep Sea mocktail. The staffs were quite good and well in behavior. Lastly pocket pinch was moderate.

A boozed belly always craves for good food to finish it on a HIGH note! There are very limited place in kolkata which serves mouth watering food alongside alcohol, this place is indeed one of them.
Located in a very prime location just beside Hind Inox. As soon as you enter the interior will soak you in, & I'm sure you will be craving to click couple of photos with the amazing furnishing they displayed. As alcohol is injurious to health we settled for only food,
üçπShirley Temple: fruit juice based mocktail in duo colour topped with vanilla ice cream.
üç§ Garlic Pepper Fish: the best of the lot, sliced fish fillet fried to perfection then tossed in garlic based sauce which melted in the mouth like butter. Highly Recommended.
üçö Szchewan Fried Rice: not so spicy rice like the name usually suggest, with portion to serve max 2 heads.
ü•ò Chicken in Black Bean Sauce: lookwise it will seem like any other chinese chicken dish but as soon as it reaches your tastebuds the difference will be right infront, went well with the rice.
Zomato did it right this time with the pocket pinch, points cut for limited options on the menu. Overall a good place to visit with a large group as it sufficiently spacious to accommodate such.
P.S.: They serve North Indian dishes too.

Ambience is nice, service is good and food is average. All I can share about my experience is that we had 2 starters and a desert. 
Spring Roll- Well crisped and less oily dish with typical filling.
Steamed dim sum- One thing is pretty clear, don't expect a dim sum because it's veg momo served inside a bamboo steamer with a chutney or sauce which is actually quite different and tastes good.
Brownie with ice cream- You won't find it different from other places.

Located in the same building of Hind Inox. The entrance takes a walk through the nostalgic Bollywood movie posters which we admired as we took crazy selfies there. The interior decor is beautifully done. The table arrangements are apt as the group tables, couple tables and the bar section are separated. Now coming to food and ambience, where both are fabulous. Service is fast and commendable. Prices are reasonable and beyond expectation. Though the bar is not yet open but it is being said it will set on soon. So there it goes:
Cuisine: 9/10

After a good movie a good food is must! So do pop in.

Finally Masala Wok!! Just 30 sec away from my place of residence. Located on the 1st floor of Hind Inox, this place is just the restaurant that was missing in our locality. The decor is pretty neatly done, ambience is soothing, drinks are a delight & the food is yumm. We had north indian, everything from the kebabs, dal makhni, paneer butter masala, chicken makhanwala, kulchas and nans all were amazing. The only con could be the quantity served(especially of crispy chilli babycorn) which should definitely be improved. All in all a good place to have dinner with friends & family. Fairly priced, would definitely be coming back to try their chinese dishes.

Location is perfect for a combo of Movie and Lunch/Dinner at 1st floor of Hind Inox. 
Interiors are classy. 
Tried their Butter Chicken and Chicken Reshmi Kebab. Soft and juicy pieces of chicken just melted in the mouth. Perfectly cooked. 
They even serve Biriyani. Perhaps will try next time.
Service is a bit slow.

This restaurant will go a long way if they maintain same food quality. 
Went there at 2 pm, it was only us. Ambience was very good, definitely uplift your mood. Long space, and glasses letting natural light come into, sitting in comfy sofas,chairs - a nice atmosphere. Fusion music playing in background, a very good combination of everything! 
Coming to food- monchow soup lemon coriander soup both were good and up to the mark. I enjoyed my combo meal - chicken kebab with laccha and kali dal. Other dishes served to others - pretty good they said. Mocktail was below par.
Lastly,could say, very good place for hangout. 
Budget 900 for 2!

Visited this place on 11/02/2017, after watching movie at hind. They have created a really nice restaurant with all fancy and highlighting interiors. Food was good. We had veg spring roll, hakka noodles, veg coined manchurian and fresh lime soda. We loved the Veg Spring Roll, it was just perfect. Staff was also very helpful and nice. We were in a hurry so did not check the bill properly. We had veg hakka noodles but were charged for egg hakka noodles. Silly mistake, but our experience was great. Will surely visit this place again. üôÇ

One winter afternoon, bored of the regular Medical College canteen fare, I decided to drop by at this newly opened joint.. Located just above Inox Hind, this place is a brainchild of Red Hot Chilli Pepper group.. the place is simplistic but classy in decor..  A few posters with throwbacks to old Hindi film dialogues adorn the entrance.. The ambience inside is cheerful and bright..The menu covers the usual North Indian and Chinese staples..  To start off, we ordered a pineapple and  mint mock tail named something like Deep Sea, it was rather ordinary..  What blew my mind was the starter that followed - Pan Fried Chilli Fish - it was lip smacking and undoubtedly one of the best in Kolkata...   The main course comprised egg fried rice, chicken bharta, dal makhani and tandoori roti..  The rice was good but nothing else really stood out.   I was too full to try out dessert.. Service was prompt.. And pocket pinch slightly on the higher side. If you visit, I suggest you stick to the Chinese... 
With a few improvements, this one could go a long way...being the only fine dining restaurant in this locality.. All the best to the Masala Wok team!!

Walked in here for a quick lunch. But boy did it surprise me! The Jeera Pulao and Bhuna Gosht combo was excellent, and so was the steamed chicken dimsum. Prices are reasonable, and the quantity is good for even people with a large appetite.

While the ambience, food, and service was execellent, rating it a 4.5 for now as the music was a bit too loud for the afternoon.

This is a new restaurant, just above hind fame inox.
Serves both chinese and indian courses.
I visited this place due to an offer on the nearbuy app, in which we got a 5 course meal for two for 499 bucks.
Ambience vise, this place is beautiful.
Full marks on ambience and decor.
The staff were very helpful and pleasant, and the dishes did not take long to arrive.
Our orders -
Chicken manchow soup - heavenly, with loads of shredded chicken.
Chicken lat mai kai - easily the best dish we had.
The chicken was soft and spicy and tasted brilliant.
But low on quantity.
Kung pao chicken - quantity was good, but i have had better.
Chicken chowmein and fried rice - the weakest dishes,
Tasted a little bland,although abundant in chicken.
Only gulab jamun was available in desserts, though it was seved with vanilla ice cream and tasted brilliant.
Also we had fresh lime soda.
Overall, this was extremely worth the 500
A fine dine experience at that low a price is very rare.
Although, when the offer expires, i doubt if the restaurant would be that attractive a proposal.

The best part of this restaurant is the location. It was an awesome choice for the gang to visit this place during our office break. Located at 5 mins walk from chandni chowk station. So we reached there within 2-3mins from our office (on bikes).

The place has an excellent decor. Good and courteous staff. The service is also quite fast, considering we had to rush back. The prices were surprisingly cheaper than the impression we first had for this place.

The presentation of the food is complimented by the nice food.

They should have the delivery option too.

When it comes to rating a restaurant, I'm quite stringent but surprisingly this place deserves a full 5/5 rating!
Very classy d√©cor, a good ambiance, lip-smaking food with excellent presentation and extremely courteous staff...I wonder why is the rating 3.9? It deserves more.
Coming to food, for starters we ordered chicken malai kebab, schezuan chicken dimsum, pan fried chilli fish. All the items were cooked to perfection but my favourite was the dimsum. Also tried a mocktail Shirley temple, it was okay.
For main course we ordered prawn in hot garlic sauce along with mixed fried rice.. it was delicious as well.
And lastly for dessert we ordered darsan with ice cream.. Undoubtedly the best darsan I've ever had!

The service is very good and each of staffs were extremely courteous. Even the quantity was sumptuous. Most intriguing part of this whole dining experience was its price. The bill came around 1500 which was moderately quite reasonable as compared to the taste and quality of the food. 
Will surely recommend this place to all my friends. :)

Jugalbandhi of Chinese Wok Feat Indian Masala @ Masala Wok..!

Kolkata‚Äôs immense love for Chinese, has made Red Hot Chilli Pepper quite a popular restaurant string in different corners of the city.¬† Their newest baby is however an evident addition to the food map of Kolkata, ‚Äì Masala Wok by Red Hot Chilli Pepper lays hands on not only Chinese but also specializes in North Indian.

‚ÄãMasala Wok, as the name suggests, is a multicuisine restaurant which specialises in Mughlai and Chinese. So what makes it exceptional amongst the other restaurants in the city? Well, the fact is its location, in the same building as that of Hind Inox. You would hardly find a proper fine dining restaurant in that area. Masala Wok can rightfully be considered as the best fine dining restaurant in and around Ganesh Chandra Avenue and hence is the saviour for the residents nearby ! The most striking feature of this place is the lovely ambience. The colour contrast that has been set looks amazing. The best part is their food and their equal expertise in both Mughlai and Chinese.

While going through zomato reviews about the newly opened restaurant, I was planning to visit this place since a month. Today visited this restaurant with my foodie friend Mrinal Debnath for lunch. The location is very convenient. It is located near chandni chowk metro station in the same building of Hind inox cinema. I must say from the entrance to the dining space the decoration is pretty good and appealing. The dining space is quite big with cozy ambiance and vibrant decor. 
We had a nearbuy voucher for Chinese meal , so we placed our orders on the basis of that coupon. We ordered chicken lemon coriander soup üçú followed by Red hot drumsticks üçó in starter. Then in main course we chose chilli garlic chicken noodles and schezwan chicken rice as staples along with Green chilli smoked soy garlic chicken. Also there was fresh lime soda and gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream in dessert.üçß
Firstly the soup was served and it was quite flavorful. Then the starters came and it was just superb to taste with the salad and sauce given as sides. Perfectly crispy and spicy drumsticks which were very much well going with the spicy sauce. üçóüòã
Next the main course was served. The schezwan rice was not up to the mark as it tasted quite bland but the chilli garlic noodles was awesome with perfect balance of garlic flavor. The chicken gravy item was also decent. Last but not the least the dessert was the main attraction of today's food journey. The hot gulab jamun was tasting divine with the vanilla ice cream. I couldn't imagine ever this combo would taste so yummy.üòã
Quantity is mentionable. The staff behavior is nice. The ambiance and decor is eye catching and impressive. The service is very prompt as well as great. So overall it was a great experience.

Taste!! Oh yes! The soup was actually a clear soup that was really tasty.. Drums sticks was yum..üòã  chilly garlic noodles was also good in taste.. Fried rice is ok, but it taste more with the chicken item.. And yes!! How can I forget the dessert!! I must say about the combination of hot gulabjamun with chilled ice cream..that was heavenly ...
But one suggestion, they served noodles and rice together..that was little messy for some people...
But overall that was an good experience..

If you live in Kolkata, and love Chinese, then Red Hot Chilli Pepper is no stranger to you. It has remained a popular destination for 17 years now. Having accomplished this amazing feat, it has now come up with a new restaurant in Chandni Chowk. Masala Wok by Red Hot Chilli Pepper specializes in North Indian, besides Chinese. Here‚Äôs a brief look at the restaurant, based on the items I tried from their menu.

This place deserves more attention that it is currently getting. We decided to eat lunch here after watching a movie at Hind Inox and we were greeted at an almost empty restaurant with beautiful decor and delicious food.

We ordered chicken biryani- perfect taste and so light and non-oily; tandoori roti and kadai paneer- soft paneer in a spicy gravy with an abundance of capsicum; cuba libre- coke with an undertaste of rum; sherley temple- for those with a sweet tooth and ice cream craving and caipiriosca- lemony drinks with rum.

We had a great time and since the food was great and prices were reasonable we intend to visit again.

This is an amazingly beautiful restaurant with a very bright and colourful decor. It is on the first floor of the same building as Hind Inox. Coming to the food, we ordered Lat Mai Kai for starters. It came along with some complimentary kimchi and pickled veggies. The Lat Mai Kai was perfectly crisp and tasted amazing. For main course, we had Chicken fried rice & Fish with ginger and spring onion. The preparations were light yet very flavourful. Overall its was a lovely experience and the food was great.

Although a restaurant by the chain Red Hot Chilli pepper but its extremely economical may be as it's a new one and yet to get Bar license. 
If you visit the place u must must and must try the garlic pepper fish in the starters. That's absolutely wonderful to eat. Very tasty and the portion n quality both worth every penny. It serves both Chinese n Indian food. The dum Ka murg goes nice with the Nan. 6 tender pieces of chicken and very mildly cooked in semi white gravy. The peas polao was good too. And guess what was the pocket pinch of 1 plate garlic pepper fish , 1 nan , I plate dam ka murg and 1 plate of peas polar?? ... ‚Çπ 831/- including Tax.

It was a wonderful afternoon in Masala Wok after a nice movie. The place is very well groomed and very cozy. I liked the food there and the service were excellent. It worth a try. Price was OK with me however I felt the quantity of the food was less than what we usually find in other restaurants.

This is my first review on Zomato.
Well i visited this particular restaurant located just above Hind Inox and it just was just mindblowing.Firstly the ambience is top notch and the place is well maintained.Food is also excellent.We ordered mocktails, crispy mushroom,Tandoori Chicken and darsan icecream.Not only the quality was excellent but also the quantity was substantial.The staff were friendly and the order time was minimum.Everyone must give this restaurant a try.

This review was long over due, went there during dasami. Loved their ambience, I ordered combo meal of fried rice and chili chicken, price is very reasonable. Coming to the food the rice was sufficient and tasty but the chili chicken though six pieces but were small. Having said that at this price point you can't complain.

We visited on 11th October (Dashami). We have a quality restaurant near our house. The food was really good and liked the ambiance of the place. Price is very reasonable. All the best and hope they maintain the standard.

Went to the place on 9th sep (asthami). Liked the ambience and food. Bar licence yet to get so only mocktails. Food wise quite good and price wise not so high. All the best.
