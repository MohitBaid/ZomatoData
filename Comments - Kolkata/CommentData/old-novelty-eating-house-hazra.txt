This place isn't comfortable for "Sit & eat" ideas, and it's a popular pick up joint. Egg Tarka Fry, Chicken Bharta & Rumali roti are signature dishes and are delicious if eaten hot. A pocket friendly place which can be a life saver on the occasions when you go through a long and tiring day and you don't want to cook anything for dinner. It's a heavenly place for people on the move throughout the day, looking for budget meals.

Can be termed as a cheap area place. It wasn't clean and there were flies all over here and there. The place seemed to be very shabby as well as the workers. The food was okayish but I'd rather not recommend this place to anyone.

This is a old eatery near hazra more. So don't expect classy ambience. If you want to enjoy tasty food at low budget then this is the place. I've never been here but I ate several dishes from this place. The best one is chicken bharta. It's damn tasty and value for money.

This is an age old place which I believe can be featured in hidden gem category. Never tried the food, but I have had the special Lassi twice or thrice and find it to pretty good - thick and yummy.

Small joint near hazra. . somewhat like "Bhater Hotel" with Chinese mughlai dishes as well.
Prices are quite cheap.
Don't expect any ambience or decor.
If you're low on money then only try this place, otherwise no recommendations from my side.
