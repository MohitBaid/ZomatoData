A very small place near DUM DUM Junction serves dishes with avg pricing and fine quantity. The seating arrangements are very limited and basically people go there for a take away rather than a dine in.

Small and cozy. Ambience is nothing mentionable. But the Chinese food is mouth watering. Pocket friendly. Good portions. Insanely tasty for such a small joint. 
Must try: red pepper chicken, chicken panfried noodles.

I learned from my friends who lives in Dumdum that this restaurant is a popular one in case of Chinese food. So I have been there with friends and they insist me to order a pan-fried noodle for me. And I did. Than  after I  could not  resist myself stopped eating.  It was very nice. Loved it. Loved the atmosphere of the little restaurant. I'll definitely recommend it to the couple.

This restaurant is a few steps from Vicekananda statue in Dum Dum,which happens to be just beside my friend's house.

So one day both of us went there and ordered a plate of egg noodles which both of us shared. I personally didn't like the flavour. It was definitely overpriced. You can get much better quality noodles at a lesser price.

If you are hungry, need a quick meal or want to take a break from cooking, then this place wont disappoint you. They are literally ok, and their prices are well measured. After all its the best place you can grab a meal along with Mitra-Cafe between Chiriamore to Nagerbazar. and if you instruct them to prepare your dish without ajina motor they will do so.

Location : 2 minutes walking distance from DumDum station.

Ambiance : Perfect for a lunch/dinner date. Air-conditioned. But not spacious enough to accomodate more than four in a table.

Food Quality : Quite good, considering the price. 400 rupees is enough for two.

Food Items : Fried rice and preparations of chicken are the best that you can try here. Noodles are okay. I've also tried crispy chicken, chicken lollipop which were not up to the mark.

All in all, a good cheap Chinese restaurant.

Thank you Zonato for finally adding this place. This business is serving great chines food since couple of years now. This is a small joint beside dumdum metro station. They have a wide but purely Chinese menu, recently updated with pork and duck. Food is very testy and hygienic and quantity are also large. Tested lots of item here and all were great and distinct with each other. Ambiance  is OK. Stuffs are good, only letdown is their reluctance to put the AC on.

Situated in a prime location at dumdum.
 This is a good place for a romantic dinner as well as a family get together. Awesome ambiance with appropriate lights and decor. I¬†must say that they don't give you any opportunity to complain about anything be it their food or the services provided by their staffs. Food quality is very good and tasty... specially red pepper chicken. There are lots of food items, and though I have tasted very few but whatever I had tasted till date all are awesome and tasty.
