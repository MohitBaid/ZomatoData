Good bar with a great location. It's a good option to go specially if you are going for a movie or for shopping at esplanade because it's mostly empty. Among the food the kebabs and tandooris are much better than their any other dishes. It doesn't have a wheelchair ‚ôø access though!

My goto place where u can have a good chat with friends, good food, good booze with less pocket pinch and with good and prompt service. Love their fish finger -  served with mayo, mutton seekh kebabs, garlic non veg noodles, tikka salad to name a few. üòÅ
A bar where you get chilled Bud Magnum and 60ml as standard measurement!! 
Love to go there and spend time with my friends.

The ambience was good and decoration was quite good too. As per the highly demand they were only serving some selective dishes for the Christmas Eve. We ordered chicken lollipop and 2 beers. Service was good. 
Will visit again :)

Situated on the same floor as the New Empire movie hall in New Market area. Fairly big but clumsy because of the packed up seating arrangements and narrow lanes to walk through. Fairly comfortable seats and decent amount of ambient light. Though the lightings inside is brilliant. I went a day before Christmas and it was decked up in all its glory. The bar section is beautifully decorated. I kind of like the side sitting area a bit above the ground level. Food we ordered were

Lama Chilli Lamb and Pan fried Chilli fish for starters along with some Electra as they had shortage of cranberry breezers. For main course we ordered gravy chowmein and Sesame crusted chicken which were both really tasty. We also had Fish SOS Tikka as a side dish with the noodles. We then ordered some biryani along with Chicken bharta and burnt onion raita. I got to say the presentation of each item were indeed impressive. Taste wise also am pleased. But the service is terrible. They took so long to deliver each dish. FOr starters we had to wait 20mins. For main course we had to wait another good 15mins. In the end we went for a brownie with vanilla scoop topping and it took so long that in the end we felt like cancelling the order. A bit better service will be appreciated in the future. Staff are very experienced and good at their jobs. If you are near Esplaned and need to decent place for booze along with good food this is the place to be.

One of the kolkata's oldest bar.. It have its own classic charm. Situated opposite new empire cinemas at the 1st floor of new empire building. 
Don't expect a very well trained staffs and swift service but the old Butler type servers are perfect match with the place. 
We ordered 2 cocktails; aunty anita's suger plum juice and oh dear. Both were good; gave a great Christmas feeling. I prefer oh dear over anty anita's bcoz of its sweet taste blend. We also ordered one cranberry based mocktail gold rush; it was really good.
Food was avg. The fish fingers were not upto the mark (We had a lot better b4). But cheesy fries were good; sufficient quantity with loads of cheese.
No matter what but one of the must visit place if one want to experience the old Kolkata.

Experience not so good.. not so happening place.. basically a q place for boozing.. couldn't get the dishes which was highlighted as a special menu.. chicken malai kebab was good to go with the drink but nothing special.. though we haven't planned for biriyani still ordered as it was only available and again it was pathetic.. will not recommend any foodie for food.. very good location just to sit and booze but apart from that very much dissatisfied üëé

The atmosphere inside the bar was average.

The staff behaviour was good.

The availability of beer was quite poor.

The "sesame crusted chicken" that we ordered was not prepared with particularly fresh chicken I would say (it wasn't stale though). The preparation had an average taste and was not as much a great a combination with Carlsberg light as was suggested by a waiter.

Overall, it's an average hunt.

1.Yum yum yum .This spaghetti and meatballs was delicious.
The meat balls were so tender that it melted in my mouth.It was perfectly cooked with perfect herbs and spices .The spaghetti was soft not so chewy which i loved.Amount was good enough for two . I love garlic bread thats why i had one with those 

2."Pan Alfredo"
Alfredo is one of the  authentic Italian  quick pasta dishes which can be found in this restraunt .
Pasta is soft and creamy with cheese and sauce .Fresh tomatoes ,pepper and herbs adds colour and taste .
Best with buttery garlic bread

The decor is amazing.
You can click amazing pictures and selfies..
the comfort was a little less as the chairs were not that cozy and comfortable
Now for the booze,it is slightly expensive..
Coming to the food,we ordered a starter which was a signature dish of fish fingers,the fish tasted real bhetki and the whole thing tasted crispy but the salt was way too less in it,it was served with mayo sauce,
Which is a bonus.
now coming to the main course we had ordered hakka noodles and garlic chicken.
The hakka noodles tasted good,but it wasnt sufficient for one.
To me the best of the lot was the garlic chicken,it was apt and served well and the quantity was even sufficient.

Its one of the best located place. After a tiring new market shopping we hopped in this restaurent. They were offering good happy hours and other pocket friendly offers. The liquor is also not at all over priced. We ordered dragon chicken which turned out worst then chewing rubber. But the friendly staff immediately  changed the dish on request. But the real flavour of the friday evening was the good music by the singer tuning in his guitar some melodious hindi and Bengali tunes. Waiting to visit again

As it was my first time I must say I am impressed.
Nice place nice food
I had chicken tandoori fish finger both of them were good as starter but tandoori can be better
In main course I had chicken sticks which was really good I mean just love it and pasta was also very nice.
The best thing was the service which was great
The serving of tandoori was really unique which I have never seen before any other places that the way they squize the lemon on the chicken
Second best think was music at very first I thought it was music player but it was a singer as I don't know the name so I just wanted to say that he is a very good singer who made the Place more enjoyable.
Overall I must be there next time again.
Such a good evening.

One of the oldest bar. Ambiences are different in two sections. First floor is for family and couple where the ambience is soothing and seating arrangement is cozy. Stag section is on the second floor where hookah is also available. Ambience is not that good over here. 
Most of the food items I tried are up to the mark. Food is obviously a plus point here. CHICKEN MUSHROOM SAUTEE, SPRING CHICKEN, PAN FRIED CHILLI FISH are worth mentioning.
I have mixed experience about their service. Few staffs are well behaved and prompt in service while some are ill behaved, slow in service and are enough for spoiling your mood.

Went in a weekday with my frnd these is a nostalgic place for mee since my collage days so far peoples like staffs know me very well here the last day when i went i was requested by a waiter itself to be in his section but i preffered in a corner seat near to the projecter screen so i was been taken care by another waiter evrything was cool since the time we ordered hookah, we ordererd our hookah and within 1mint we asked the waiter to cancel it now the time the drama starts the waiter starts arguing with me that the hookah was ready and its on the way my question was within a fraction of second how could be the shisha got ready now he starts convincing me and this is just because we have to pay for the hookah by cash and dat also by advance payment and as we payed it the waiter starts his level best to serve us the hookah when i shouted he said let me check and the person who makes hookah came to us in very rude and annoying way without a uniform and said "choriye choriye app ki bas ki baat nhi" this made e soo furious and the reason to write this review and then afrer the cancelation of the hookah we asked for the bar menu to order our drinks the waiter instruct us to help ourselfs by going to thier side secsons where their menu being kept. This humilate me very much. Then the waiter came as he was gossiping with other waiters about us after a long he given us the menu and we started. This is unprofessionalism by the person who is serving us but yes the other waiter came to us and he talked to me n he was sorry to for the way the other man has behaved with us i forgot his name thats why i cant describe his name here but still that make me comfortable i am giving 3 only for this guy.
But this shuld be changed immedi@ately and make the staffs to b trained....!!

I am editing my review towards the previous just because i got a positive response from the management side whichi to be taken care of as i know how important a rating could b...

Thank u

You should look after the customer that doesn't mean you will ignore your staff. Please do help your staff to help us better. It's their identity with the personality they show. Every customer knows your staff who so ever visit there. Help yourself to first to help others.
I hope you got the inert meaning of my words........
I would love to rate 5 star coz I get the best service they provided. But one thing struct my eyes that management should provide the best service to them first and their service doesn't mean good salary and good training. They are know by their personality, positive attitude, attire, proper dress up with their name tag.
Please do look into that as well.

A chilled out zone where you can go along with friends only or team colleagues. I went with my team. A place mostly known for booze with some good offers on food thrown in from time to time. Foods are ok. Pocket pinch is not much. Since I am a teetotaller I concentrated more on the food part. The mushroom preparation and dry chilli chicken were good. That chicken could hv been little better though.

I don't get It. Why the Bars in the most crowded areas become so lazy and careless while treating their customers. Actually they think that the customers will come pouring anyway they treat them. You should never ever visit this place if you are a group of 6 or more. They have tables for four only. But we six still c ramped in that table and gave it a try. Food quality was so bad that no foodie should visit this place. Good for drinking only. Dry Chilly Chicken was good. Baby Corn and Prawn was pathetic. It was a mistake on our part that we ordered prawn. And don't order cocktails also. They are not a specialised cocktail bar. Very poor quality cocktails. So visit if you want. This is my personal feelings. Waiters were good enough and responsive. Everything else was not. Cheers!!!!

I visit the place often, situated in esplanade beside citi mart,, the restaurant cum bar seems to be crowded all the time.
With moderate expenditure anyone can satisfy his taste buds over any dish.
I ordered the normal chicken biriyani and found quite good. The quantity is even enough for two.
Athough the waiters delayed to serve the food.
Have hopes from this restaurant towards betterment.
However I went later n i found this paneer butter masala to be very tasty.

Not going to visit this place again.
Located in a prime position of Esplanade, the behaviour of the staff is not promising, they don't keep everything given in the menu. We had called the staffs before hand as it was sunday, to enquire about happy hours, there was'nt any happy hours bt they ensured there was some flat discounts going which is valid on daily basis. When we asked for the daily discounts menu they told us it was only from Monday-Friday, later on when we enquired further about why they gave us wrong information over phone they started denying, we showed them the number which we got from zomato. Initially they created a fuss but later they agreed it was there bars number. From there began the misbehaviour, we ordered for Tuborg strong which was not available, although when the menu was served they told us everything was readily available, we had to settle down for Kingfisher instead. There was delay in serving.Later we ordered Spring chicken as side dish we were served chicken pakora, they were not ready to accept that it. We did not want to get into any mess so we settled down for what was served. Service executives are rude,not grounded, misbehaved with us regarding both food and drinks. Complete rubbish and total disappointment.

I'm quite regular here. I used to like this place but day by day this place is getting worse. 
Stuffs are so annoying. Service is so bad and they increase their price so frequently. 
And yes I'm giving 3 Star only for food.

Liquor is little high priced.. specially beer... Food is good... And the innovative names of the foods are really good....goblin kabab...or spring chicken... Ya we were there for drink...and enjoyed it... Though they can easily omit the live music session...

The most decent bar in the new market area. I said decent because of the crowd that comes in. Yes the prices are on higher side compare to other bars. Ambience and food are pretty perfect.

The rating 4.5 is given to a bar cum restaurant of they have extraordinary service or have nostalgic interiors which lifts your mood.
This place has both of these. The service by a particular person who was attending our table was very polite and prompt on his feet. I am very sorry that I can't recall his name. The second thing to notice was the cramped interior. I mean, for a particular "normal" sophisticated person, the interiors may look cramped. But for an abnormal person like me, as people think of me, the place was pure bliss. Old bricks, wide tables, dim lighting, everything was just urging me to be happy and in face I became very happy. 
I ordered for a couple of Budweisers and a fish finger. The fish fingers were delicious and went well with chilled beer. Next we ordered another beer and chicken tandoori. The food didn't disappoint too. 
The pocket pinch was quite less as compared to other places in that area.
Great experience. Thumbs up. Highly recommended.

Visited after a lonnnng time... got very nostalgic. still the house is having that "Mood"
Now lets give some feedback 
Interior 4.5/5 = there is always a chance for improvement
Ambience 4/5 =¬† (lighting. chairs, tables cutlery, crockery, arrangements. upto the mark. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† if you are with your Partner, you will feel comfortable)
Service 5/5 = ( fast, compact, they will really make your day, 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The unit should be proud of their service staffs. Kudos) 
Food 3.5/5 =¬† Though we visited in afternoon (and at their lunch time) and had Beer and 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chicken Bharta and Tandoori Roti.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† We are not satisfied with the bharta taste, it was a little bit if modified chicken masala.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† May be the chef was not in his good mood, that time. Sometimes it happens.
Now I had An Issue and like the management to address this.¬† : Menu card charge and Billing mismatch. I have noticed later on, In menu card the price of Breezer was shown @ 120/- however we are charged 175/- again in the menu Foster Beer was listed as @ 170/- but we are billed as 210/-. ( Bill No- 486, 15.06.17, @2.57 p.m. Table 12.

Lastly like to conclude that Its again a great place to visit, relax and get refreshed. Definitely like to visit again, but next time in the evening.

I have been here so many time. This is situated just opposite of Shriram market. Dark Ambience with blue lights which make the Ambience very romantic.üòç Nice place to visit with your partner. They used to play romantic Hindi songsüéµ, that can change your mood automatically.

food:- they serve good food as well. I ordered french fries which was crispyüëç, fish finger with chips fish was ok type but the chips was goodüòä. They have some combo offer, buy two beer one Chicken lollipop on the house, but I did not found any test on that lollipopüòê. Next we went for main course. Tandoori Roti,chicken Bharta, chicken tikka masala. Nothing to say about the main courses it was delicious reallyüòã. Our stomach was full so we can not go for any dessertsüòÅ.

Beverage:- many things were notavailable. We ordered beer and rum.

Service:- courteous service. Well behaviour and friendly tooüëç.

Thank you

This place is very balanced if terms of a perfect bar as well as for dinning. The upper floor attracts more due to its long portion of space and the staff being really good makes this place a quality one to spend time with close ppl as well as for party purposes.

Going to the New Empire bar was not prepared meditated but the end result and the satisfaction was good. Located just in the main heart of Kolkata ,i.e; Esplanade and beside the Citi mart ,this place is not so hard to find out and it's a favourite place for foodies and drinkers.I went over there a few days back and tasted the Chicken Steak . Though the dish was yummy but i was disappointed with the way they presented it . And the quantity was also not adequate enough.The only different thing I found was that they gave 2 bunny garlic bread along with it. The Chicken steak was not something extraordinary as I have tasted better than this yet it had that creamy lustre in it and the chicken was really cooked well and so was those mushrooms.
It's quite pocket friendly and it cost me around 500 for 2 along with the beer. The place is not very spacious and also not quite lit up properly which will not allow you to have good pictures .

A REAL NICE PLACE TO HANG OUT WITH FRIENDS

AMBIENCE- IT WAS A COZY ATMOSPHERE WITH A LOW LIGHT AND NICELY SET UP TABLES FOR A ROMANTIC DINNER WITH YOUR PARTNER

SERVICE- THE STAFF WAS REALLY GOOD. THEY TOOK NICE CARE OF US ALL THROUGHOUT THE TIME

FOOD- IT WAS GOOD BUT NOT FINGER LICKING. THE TASTE WAS AVERAGE.

AT THE END ITS A NICE PLACE TO SPEND AN EVENING FOR A HOT DAY WITH SOME CHILLED BEER AND SNACKS

Decent ambience with great food.. The "Chicken Mushroom Saute" was delicious.. We also ordered the "Spicy meat balls" and the regular  "chilli chicken", those weren't anything to boast of but was pretty decent, especially at that price point.. They also serve great cocktails, "Sangria" for example, they make it pretty delicious..

Service: Very Bad. They did not even give us water unless we asked. The most horrible thing was that we were not given enough attention just because we did not order any alcohol. 
Food: poor. Dhabas and regular restaurants taste better.

If you want to go and have drinks and all it might be a moderate place but if you want to go and have a proper meal it is the worst possible destination. The quantity and quality is not good at all in terms of the money you are going to pay.

After being tired and drained out at new Market area. We were looking for some good place to sit and enjoy yourself over few drinks. There is something very comfortable and welcoming about this place. No doubt to say its a great place to be with your close knots! Very courteous staff, quick with their service and really good food at prices which won't burn a hole in your pockets. The menu of the Bar was well designed with large pictures of the food items of the place. Quite liked the semi dark interiors, dim lighting, glass painted windows..it adds to the charm. Would love to go back again.

Great place to be after classes or work! Very courteous staff quick with their service and really good food at prices which won't burn a hole in your pockets.

Our order :-

Food :

Peppery Mushrooms Sauted : Delicious! The mushrooms and bell peppers were well cooked and seasoned. Perfect !

Hariyali Paneer Tikka : Loved it ! The 4 large pieces of paneer were so soft and the marinating made it heavenly. Just perfect with the drinks.

Pyaar Karo (Veg pakoras) : Great ! The spicy sauce was well in synch with the pakoras.

Drinks : Just the basics. 3 x VAT 69. Their standard measure is 60 ml.

Total Bill : Rs. 1200 for 2 people.

Deducted 1 star due to lack of options for vegetarians. Please add some more vegan dishes, otherwise a really good place. Coming back soon.

Cheers!

If you are in search of a cool hangout place, New Empire Bar can be your perfect pick. Quality foods and classic drinks along with the subtlety offered by the surroundings can up your mood in no time. Well, the place is not a new one for me and I always prefer to hit that spot with my pals to freshen my mood. After all, the cozy sitting arrangement and the lighting have made the place perfect for having fun time with your buddies. 

It was a sudden idea flashed into my mind and I didn‚Äôt take so much time to call my pals and inform them about the plan of visiting the bar. There we ordered Tandoori Chicken and Chilli Chicken Dry. Both the preparations were well cooked and mouth-watering. I totally lost myself in the flavors and tastes of both of the dishes. However, we reveled in each of the bite along with a trendy whiskey Vat69. Moreover, this combination was unique and we totally enjoyed our time.

One cannot deny the precious old Kolkata feeling, which you can experience after stepping into the New Empire Bar. The soothing ambiance of the place along with the well mannered behavior of the waiters will automatically make you feel elated about the Bar. 

My last weekend‚Äôs visit to this amazing friend with five of my pals went quite well. There are two floors of the bar, divided in smoking and non-smoking zone. We all decided to go to the first floor where the dim lighting and the glass painted window added some more colors to our expedition. The whole atmosphere of the place can easily transfer you to the good old days of those classy English Pubs. The menu of the Bar was well designed with large pictures of the food items of the place. We all decided to go for the Tandoori chicken, chilli chicken dry and vat69. 

We all loved the Dry Chilli Chicken very much due to its marvelous flavor. The juicy and soft texture of the Tandoori Chicken was also awesome. Sipping the Vat69 along with the above mentioned dishes was truly amazing. The continuously played background music is another aspect of the New Empire Bar, which can automatically create a charming and cozy ambiance.

This place is cozy and the ambiance is nice. We sat in the smoking zone of the bar which is upstairs. Had beer (Millers) and two dishes. One was the Corny. Sweet corns tossed with veggies and spice, really crunchy. Also had the Chilli basil chicken. Tender slices of chicken made in an oriental style with basil and bell peppers. Would love to go back again.

There is something very comfortable and welcoming about this place. Be it the old Calcutta feel, the old New Empire Cinema or the really well mannered waiters. 
So there were four of us and we took seats in the upper floor, where it is a smoking zone. Dim lighting, glass painted windows..it adds to the charm. 
The Menu is well designed with large pictures of what you can expect from the dish. Nice job !
We sipped on Millers and had #Corny as sides. Corn tossed in sauces and garnished well.  Also took a Chilli basil Chicken (sliced) . Nothing remarkable but nice. 
I wonder why I didn't go there earlier :)

Located on the first floor of the New Empire cinema. The ambience is really good and cozy with an array of lights hanging from ceiling and a number of hollywood photographs stacked all around the walls - really can create a nostalgic moos of old English style pub very different from our recent days happening bar lounges. They have an excellent selection of cocktails which¬† really boosts up the inner energy. Coming to food i would recommend to try the chicken legs named as 'sexy thangs' in the appetizer section. Service is good and rates are reasonable. They do have live band on Thu and Sat from 6 pm.

After a movie, me and a friend of mine just wanted a quick grab of some good food with a pint of beer. Since fairlawn was closed,this was the nearest . I just heard about this place before , never been here. So it was the first time..and I must say I was pretty impressed for a very pocket friendly bar with good seating, friendly and prompt service , a great ambience (considering I went here around 4) . The food wasn't out of the world but for a budget like that..it is appreciable. Do try out the sexy chicken legs(i know the name is attractive) to side with a beer.  This place does come as a relief within the hustle bustle of the busy place.

One of the best places to sit ¬†and have a drink with friends, girlfriend or alone. The food is okayish but one thing which makes this place different is the service. Especially Christopher, people keep coming back to this place just because of his humor, behavior and service. The live music and the cozy decor is also an add on.

Here we went being tired and drained out after shopping at new Market area.We were looking for some good place to sit and enjoy yourself over few drinks.
Coming on its ambience, it is OK for me,not bad either.Nathing new,nathing fancy.Keeping in mind this  is a very old decorated place.
We ordered a veg biriyani ,which is really amazing. Spring chicken and chicken bharta.
Food was tasty and quantity quality all good.But I HV issue with there waiting time.They serve too late.We had to constantly check with the waiters for our order after certain decent time for waiting us over.
One of a stuff was a bit on bad mood I felt so.
Overall I had OK experience.

Good Service, Nice ambience, drinks at reasonable rate and food is also better than average. They have live singers performing every Thursday and Friday, which I found amazing. The two singers were too good. Overall value for money for drinks and adda, nothing fancy but not at all boring. Some good simple egg based dishes also they have. Just one thing, the upholstery needs a little refurbishing and the volume of music should be a little lower to allow people to talk comfortably across the table.

How big was New Empire some years ago !! Home to one of the most happening cinema halls in town , a pizza parlour , a cafe , a kfc , a restaurant and on the top floor a much happening bar . Those were the times when the city was all but not flooded with pubs and bars and restaurants . Things have changed these days , and old school stuff cannot be called great any more just because they have been there for a long time . They need to upgrade and rectify themselves in every steps now to be one of the superstars . New Empire Bar however has all the ingredients to be a legendary place , only if they realize it more . 

¬∞ Location :- Easy peasy , you have to come to New Empire cinema hall or better known as the Humayun Palace and then go to the 2nd floor where you will find the bar to your right .

¬∞ Ambience  ( 3 / 5 ) :- It has so many pros and cons . First of all the tables and seating is brilliant . The 2 people seating with a lamp on top is the best thing you will get in this pretty happening part of the city . You want to grab a drink with your dear one, this is so much the place to be . And then they blow it all off by playing this irritating loud Bollywood music. The choice of songs were pretty poor . Moreover , when you have dim lights and a fine seating you just don't spoil it by playing loud Hindi songs . Contrary to my belief that maybe their theme but i am not fully convinced with this approach . The music spoilt my experience .

--------------------------------------------------------------

¬∞ Food & Drinks :- They have this classic menu which is not mentioned in zomato . This menu has some collection of fried which goes so well with the drinks available here . Unfortunately , the menu in zomato is not updated as that of the bar and I found the prices to be different . 

---------------------------
DRINKS
--------------------------
We saw Miller in the menu but to our dissapontment that was not available . The other beers were all overpriced . A bottle of tuborg costs 190 whereas I have had cheaper rates . Anywayz , they served it chill and provided a bowl of "chanachur" as chakna .

-----------------
SNACKS
-----------------

1. Spring chicken ( 4 / 5 ) :- super yummy . There were 8 delicious and tender pieces of chicken pakora without bones . Served with small toothpicks , they were absolutely perfect to go with our beer . The chicken pieces had some fat which make the pakoras more delicious . A very much recommended dish from my side .

2. Chaata ( 4 / 5 ) :- This was from the special fry menu . This is perfect to go with the drinks . It was basically a spicy salad made of boiled egg whites , tomatoes , onions , basil leaves and lemon juice on top . There were a lot of green chilis in it to make it spicy and trust me it was delicious . This was the perfect chaat with our drinks . A must try .

-------------------------
DESERT
-------------------------

1. Original sin ( 4 / 5 ) :- After we gulped down our drinks with spicy food we needed something to cool us down and this one did one hell of a job. This is 2 scoops of choco ice cream , one scoop of vanilla in the middle accompanied with mixed fruits and nuts . It was a yummy experience after having the drinks and the snacks . Acted like a fire extinguisher , this is a yummy delight .

------------------------------------------------------------------

¬∞ Service ( 3 / 5 ) :- Had mixed feelings about this.  The first dish I.e the spring chicken came after 20 mintues which was a bummer . The service time although improved for the next dishes i was really pissed with the first one.  They should be a little quicker if they have to score more .


I would like them to stress on the following points that I felt is needed to be worked upon :- 

1. Check the loud and type of music player. The bolly theme with posters of Western movies on the wall is not happening any more .

2. Should improve the service time .

3. Availability of good quality drinks like Miller . 

4. Price of the drinks .

But , inspite of the cons as mentioned above i had a pretty good time . And i will always recommend this place to everyone to come and have a drink . The quality of  food served is really good . 

Following are the good points :- 

1. Excellent food . Wide variety of snacks to go with drinks .

2. Super cosy seating . Recommended for couples .

3. Live sports screening . Epl was being player so football enthusiasts can have a try .

I would have wanted to give 4 stars but I stuck to 3.5 because I really want them to improve and then I will change my review for sure . I will be back again very soon till then if you are done with your shopping in New Market and want to grab a drink then this is the place to be .

I simply love this place. Their array of starters along with free flowing drinks won't be disappointing for anyone. The atmosphere is casual and calm with cordial and attentive waiters. They are a huge plus point of the place. Whenever I visit, I always go for a glass of wine along with 2-3 types of starters coz you just can't stop at one. Love the food and the overall quality of the place. The prices are slightly on the steeper side but you'll be having a good time.

A decent place to grab a drink and some starters with your bunch of friends. Moderately priced, the New Empire Bar serves okay-to-taste chicken and lamb dishes (for the non veg crowd, I have no clue about any veg dishes here). However, I did not like the live band playing there as the music was not soothing at all. Neither did it make me ecstatic.

This place is a literal heritage site under tremendous, under enhancement....the two bioscope models outside would have been such a cultural piece and rich heritage site had someone paid attention, but nevertheless, one's gotta adjust with what they got....

Moving on, the food is pretty avg but having said that, we did gulp down so many black dogs and tons of chilly and spring chicken..... a bill of ‚Çπ1913 (sounds like the first world war.....lol) was not bad at all, so full points on that count....

I hated three things though:-
- the way they fussed about the complimentary snacks on the black dogs (whiskey for the yet uninitiated....)
- the singer, no offences meant, but, it wasn't rock / old classics; it was noise pollution....
- too much salt in the chilly chicken....

Overall everything was good except the noise and the above mentioned antics (I think I am starting to sound like the contents of the letter from the movie Border)....at best 3.5/5

Generations after Generations of Calcutta have drank, discussed great ideas, argued about politics , shared business plans, laughed, cried and made memories at this place. The painted glass windows, small cubicles, low hanging English lamps and the dim light is a true picture of a British pub. Its pocket friendly, don't expect great food , its average, the service is good and courteous. ¬†Just visit this place and get drunk on nostalgia. :)

Heard about this place from my father and most probably, from my grand father too. 
Started visiting this place since college days. A major missing is there while I am writing this review since I do not stay at Kolkata nowadays. 
The waiters are too well dressed and courteous. They demand respect. I like to have beer at this place accompanied by dry chilli chicken. Most of my visits to this place were with like minded friends. I remember going to New Empire Bar when I broke up with my partner to drink till I drop.  Many memories linger with this place, a gem of Kolkata.

Have been visiting here for quite a few months now. The place did not disappoint me as much in basis of food quality and money value, though the quantity of food is not upto the mark. But where it displeased me is the drinks part. Being an Absolut vodka lover, I love trying different flavours of that particular vodka but it could not provide me with the flavours I wished for. It happened more than once. The ambiance is quite pleasant though. Even the sitting arrangements is quite neat, tidy and trim. üòä

One of the most oldest bar in new market area. Its in the second floor opposite to the cinema hall, this one is well airconditioned and dimly lit little place for a nice hang out, if u want a cheap shady place. Me and a friend went there on an afternoon in weekday. We had ordered beers and a cocktail on the servers recommendation ( forgot the name, sorry). The cocktail was rum based, and it was blended extremely well to my surprise. The dry chili chicken was fine in taste. The servers were extremely attentive and helpful. Will definitely visit there once again for some more shady experience.

Bar from the 60s. This will give you the old school feel the moment you enter. The one you used to see in the Hindi movies of the 60s and 70s. The food and drinks are fairly priced. I ordered Chilli Cheese Toast and Saut√©ed Veggies along with Mushrooms. The chilli cheese could have a lot more crunchy than it was and the pieces could have been better sliced. The veggies were very average, and I would not order either of the dishes a second time.

Though highly recommended by a friend i did not like the place. We ordered two items from the Tapas menu and when it came the amount was outrageously minimalistic. Thus we felt deceived. The bloody mary that i ordered was also very ordinary..

Located inside the New Empire building, have a lot of memories associated to this place. Started dropping by, when the bar at Lighthouse shut down their operations. Athough the space inside is not huge, the ambiance and the comfortable sitting options makes up for it. The refurbished menu at Zomato suggests a lot of change has taken place. Hope to visit here again after a gap of 8-9 years. :-)

The most important thing is that it is in a prime location. The bar is bit so-so. A.c  is not that strong. Personally I feel the smoking zone should be in one side. Prices are reasonable. Had chilli chicken dry with beer, food is ok. Not that tasty. Overall it's ok.

It's an awesome place to be.. Have a long connection with this place and really the sense of hospitality of the amazing manager and the waiters who always receives u with a smile sets this place class apart.. Food and drinks is economic but ever compromises in quality..

Probably the first bar in kolkata where I actually started drinking, on a weekly basisüòÄüòÄ. Located just inside the New Empire building covering 1st and 2nd floor, this place is really nice for couples and boozers. Rates are acceptable considering the location. Dry chilli chicken and chicken reshmi kebab are must try. The waitors are really nice, specially a fat aged Anglo-Indian man used to treat us as if we are his guest. He used to talk about his family children his work life etc and was very friendly.
Smoking was allowed inside, not sure if they still permit that as its been quite a few years that i have visited this place.
The interior in both the floors are very spacious, the sofas are really comfortable to sit for hours. They used to arrange for giant screen and projectors during cricket match and IPL so definitely thats a significant value add of the place.

I went to this place with my friends and enjoyed the evening thoroughly. It's situated in Esplanade, around the famed New Market area. The place is easy to be located as it is perched on the top of the group of eateries like Scoop and Barista. It lies on the first floor of the building juxtaposed to the New Empire cinema hall. This place is commodious, snugly and easy. It emanates the essence of romance. 
We had ordered Biriyani, Nans, Chicken, Cottage cheese and bottles of Touborg.
Firstly service was good and prompt. The food arrived early. Next they tasted quite good too. I love Biriyani but only from few places. This one surprised me as I actually did like it. This is one of the most frequented bar in the Esplanade area and don't worry, check out the muscles of the bouncers standing guard!

Have been to this place thrice. Must say being located at an area like the esplanade really pays off. Though called a bar, they provide good quality food too. The booze is decently priced. They don't have a huge collection but your purpose can be fulfilled with what their menu consists of. The foods are decent enough. We had tikka kebabs and spring chicken kebabs. They were succulent and tasty. The cream of chicken soup tasted a bit bland. The Chicken bharta wasn't tasty enough. And we had another dish i don't remember now. Overall the food was decent. The booze were all cool. The service is very good and the waiters are very well behaved and friendly. The walls are decorated with cool    pictures which will surely draw your attention. A place that should be visited. More than once üòâ

I really find this place been deprived of proper attention. I believe, with the decreasing popularity of movie halls, this place has suffered consequential losses. However, I find this place a good eatery. The food and drinks (of'cos) are reasonably priced. I wont say much about the drinks (coz drinks would always be the same everywhere) but the food is really good.¬†

Warning-
1. Athough the billing system is electronic, yet I have found error in summation, so kindly verify the final bill amount before payment.
2. Insist to verify the quantity of the drink before serving. (The owner has a clean heart, the server might not)

Just like the commoner ,roaming around esplanade, looking for a place to drink some beer and have some swell food,this is the place for you. The waiters are polite and courteous and the food is awesome. We ordered meatballs with tartar sauce,chicken a la king, chicken steak, pan fried fish, chicken margarita pizza, cheese garlic bread and Thai fried chicken and to be honest all of them tasted awesome. The only cons would be that some of the items in the menu remains unavailable and the songs playing in the background sucks. Priced moderately high, overall a nice place to relax.

Many of those who grew up around the Esplanade area and drinks would recognize New Empire Bar as their starting joint in drinking career. At least I'm one of those.

One of the oldest yet sober places one can grab a beer and choose from a variety of snacks that go along with its and just relax. The ambience is nothing to gorgeous but does the job fine.

The prices are nothing to worry about as it's undoubtedly reasonable. It would be nice to get back someday to refresh old memories.

Ambience is soothing with dim light and music. Staffs are helpful. The food is quite good and delicious. I am visiting this place for more than 3 years now but the taste has never changed much. Serving time is good and quick. The chats they provide with alchohol is tasty. They keep most of the reputated brands of alchohol. I really recommend this place on a presonal level as i always have a really good time here even if i am alone.

It was just a curiosity of my student life. I was alone & get into this bar. Ambience & service was very nice. They served my soda & free snacks with drink. It felt good. The bill amount was Rs. 35!!! 

I will visit this place again if I get a chance.

New empire bar located in new market in the same building as the new empire cinema hall has recently been revamped.The cinema themed decently decorated stair cases and interiors make it more appealing than what it used to be or what one would expect judging by the shabby dimly lit entrance.

I had paid this place a visit a few days back with a couple of friends mainly for a quick drink.The drinks menu though not much elaborate or fancy contained most of the standard stuff.But most importantly the drinks were extremely reasonably priced.Other than the drinks we were not that hungry and we shared a chicken steak amongst ourselves.The steak came with a couple of breads and in a black pepper mushroom sauce.But taste wise it was pretty average.

The service was decent but the waiters seemed a bit moody.The ambiance and decor is quite decent but the fine details have not been given much attention.There is a tv screen which quite irritatingly played rather cheap hindi songs.The quality of the crowd was not the best either.

Overall this is a place which is worth a try may be when you are short on budget and looking for a place with cheap booze and a half decent ambiance.

Be there to experience how old Calcutta is keeping up with the new millennia.

They have updated their tapas menu and are now serving a great variety of kebabs. Also noteworthy is their Chicken steak and pizza, both of which go well with the drinks.

Looking forward to better times.

In our college and early career days, we dud not feel too comfortable to go to the popular bars and all as they were filled with people pretty senior and even the waiters and all did not give us much importance. The New Empire was ideal for a movie and a couple of beers and also a quick bite. And all of that could fit into the tight budgets we had those days. I went in a couple of weeks back to relive the experience and was greeted eith warm and atrentive service and the chilled beers as i wanted. Liked it.

Situated just atop the New Empire movie hall,this place is one of the most coolest yet pocket friendly bars in Kolkata.The ambiance is pretty amazing especially the upstairs which is themed upon movies. The service also is one of the best in Kolkata with some of the friendliest folks serving you with their generous hospitality, something that you dont find much often around the city.
The drink menu is pretty okay with most of the drinks on the card being available and the food too goes well with it. So, if you are in town and looking for a couple of beers this is a great place to hangout with your friends.

A typical bar - comfortable seating, standard brands and good service. And best part - no music! Very conveniently located it is just outside New Market. Just the place for meeting an old friend after more than 5 years. 

Lucky this place is open even though the movie theatre it is located inside is long closed. The framed posters of old classics like Roman Holiday along the staircase adds to the charm of the place. Overall experience - v good!

All in all, this is a great place for an evening out...be it for a date or just to hang out with ur group of friends. The staff members are very courteous and helpful. The walls are stacked with posters of classic movies and they lend their aura to the ambience of the place. (y)

I gave my birthday treat here when I was in high school. We were a group of 12 people and ordered almost everything covering more than half of the menu card. This place has extremely tasty Chinese food to offer. The quality of hakka noodles and garlic chicken is very good. I like the fish fingers and the side dishes foe chicken. The mixed fried rice is tasty too. I am not much of a fan of Mughlai here. You get far better Mughlai food in several places in Kolkata. But certain selective Chinese delicacies are pretty nice. Yet I rate it low because of the arrogance of the manager and the bad service. Commercial houses cannot run successfully for a long time if they don't value customer sentiments. Arrogance kills all the good effort. Cordial behavior with customers count and its high time people in business understand that and stop acting like fools.

Yesterday was here with three of my friends. Ambience is good. Dimly lit lights with a projector screen where isl matches was goin on...I would say a nice place to go in this area. I think this is one of the budget friendly restaurants in this area.¬†
We ordered garlic bread which was ok. I thought it to be served with at least onions and capsicum but they didnt. We took chcken tandoori which was nice. But the green chutney was not so good. Then we ordered chicken hot garlic which was really good. Then as suggested by the waiter we took chicken mushroom aglio olio...Its kinda healty but tasted good and not that much spicy. we also had chicken noodles (hakka) which was also good...all food item were good. I wont say they were great but also not bad...They were a bit better than average. One thing i must mention is that the amount they give per dish was not ok. Especially the hot garlic chicken and chicken mushroom.
Then the drinks part we all had 6 absolute, 2 beers and one of us took daiquiri. Daiquiri was nice. They didnt have all the absolute flavours as they mentioned in the menu.¬†
One thing that i felt irritating was that every time we were about to finish our drink the waiter was like coming and asking us if we need anything, as if they were in a hurry!Total this costed us 3141/- but the food part was around 1000/-. Dont ¬†think this place is too costly and will visit there soon.

Visited this place many times... recently it has been renovated.... now this place is d cheapest luxury in this area for any student like me. there are two floors. One is non smoking floor... on d top floor u can smoke inside the bar... bt ambiance of middle floor is awesome. Price is reasonable... they keep varieties of drinks and dishes unlike BIG BOSS... one think i should mention, once i lost my purse there wid 2000 rs within... bt they returned it wid money... i love this place, there service.. visited many tyms already, and will visit again and again...

There are two section here the Family cum girlfriend section and the Stag section.The ambience of the Family cum Girlfriend section is very good,but the same cannot be said for Stag section, the Waiters are a bit rude in the Stag section.
The food is very good  and the alcohol is also priced very decent.
Overall it is a good experience.

It used to b very affordable before and a bit dingy.. still not very expensive though.. the ambiance is pretty decent now.. the food is fine according to the price.. Tandoori chicken, fried rice, schezwan chicken, etc are some of the preparations which i like served here.. But what i like most is the MOJITO which is prepared using lemon, mint, brown sugar and rum.. other cocktails are also good.. I would recommend the kebabs, fried rice and chicken preparations as well as the oriental cuisines.. and from the alcoholic part i would recommend the cocktails n the beers.. and of course my fav mojito..

A very small, dingy and dimly lit place in one of the oldest places of the city, this bar was once very cheap, but now is very expensive. This place had a fame of being very cheap, but now that is not the case. They often run out of good beers and are left with only Kingfisher. The food is not that good both in quality and quantity. The ambiance is also not that good to speak about. Average place, standard crowd and not that good a place to hang out in.

This is basically a go to bar for me & my friends. Another old eating & drinking institution in the heart of the city. But the first thing you will miss here is the feeling of nostalgia mainly due to excessive renovation & partly because of the quallity of the crowd. The institution is been devided in two floors one of them being a family resturent( you can't enter here without a lady friend)
Most of the liquor on the menu is available most of the time except a few exception.
The food quality is actually quiet good in comparison to other bars. Specially the "chicken tandoori" is exceptional.
The service is better than most of the bars around.
But a word of caution the food takes ages to come out of the kitchen so make sure you don't end up here with an empty belly.

A good place for boozing with your buddies, but the quality and taste of  the food is not up to the mark, I am not happy with the food, Environment is good. Low light, good attention to the customers, quick service but for college students It is not cheap now a days.

new empire bar used to be a fav hangout for my friends,we never thought about the budget as we knew what ever we eat and booze the bill will always cost six penny from your pocket. 
the ambiance was n is always good with tenebrous light cosy sofas n dim lamps hanging from the ceiling.
the waiters are not that co operative and the main waiter is utterly disgusting. he cracks poor corky jokes on other customers which is quite irritating.
now the gud part was there 2:1 offers and the price. n yeh its family section is separated ,that way you can avoid the crappy looks of the drunkards.
but now all d attrctive features went away ,the price of a kingfisher 650 went up2 175rs, they made it a no smoking zone,even d starter price went up,
2reasons to visit this place -convinient location and memories
and be very careful about your belongings when you leave the place cos once you leave it there its permanently gone

new empire bar was one of our favorite places for boozing since last 3 years. the reason being-
-affordable prices,a large strong beer costed about 130rs, so 2 large beers with a chicken starter costed about 350 bucks..pretty reasonable..what say?
-smoking was allowed inside,so we preferred it over oly.
-ambience was nice, i liked the hanging lamps,the one we get in peter cat and mocambo and their large screen with one of the hindi music channels on.
-2:1 offers on selected alcohol.
boozing,smoking,eating,gossiping,party music...overall it used to be fun!

But recently,smoking is not allowed inside,prices are increased(beer costs 175, peter cat serves at 180! which one you prefer? the menu card here in zomato is very old and shows half prices for the items) the waiters are extremely ill-behaved, they come and ask- anything else sir? just after serving the food, and brings the bill when you are just half way with your food.wot rubbish!
one more thing,once on our way back home,we realized we left a branded sunglass on the table for 2 ,that costed about 3.5k. we rang them immediately and informed. they said- mam aap khud aake dekhlo.
we rushed back but they refused to get anything fr
om there. Come on! we were regular loyal customers, this was utterly shameful from their part!

I've been visiting this place for the last 3-4 years almost twice a month. The waiters behave nicely with the customers. Always expect your food on time! Quite reasonable and wine is good. You get buy 1 get 1 offers on Bacardi or selected Beers sometimes. In fact, the waiters are so friendly here and they never ask you to leave table once you've finished your food or wine. What attracts me most about this place is the atmosphere, the lighting, decoration, and the mood it builds. I've been to many other bars in Kolkata but New Empire bar is one of the bests for the amazing atmosphere it offers. They play nice, soothing, and catchy tunes very lightly or classic Bollywood songs at times which helps to build the mood when you're there to drink. Apart from that, this place is completely safe for girls. I've been to this place with my female friends and they were always very comfortable. The crowd is also very nice here, they never bother others and maintain silence all the time. Apart from all these, they keep the best wines and beers in reasonable prices. When I put all of these together, I can proudly boast myself as a fan of these place and I'm going to visit this place again and again.

Was in Esplanade and wanted a quick drink so went to this place as did not want to go to park street. Have been there twice before so knew that getting a place wont be difficult in the family Bar. After getting seated the server came to the table a good 20 mins later and that too after me shouting for one for 3-4 times. Ordered Beer & white rum and chicken Lollypop. After another wait of 20 mins the drink came to the table and we had to wait for another 10 mins for the mixer to arrive. The Chicken Lollypop was dry,bland with not even an iota of Salt and was pathetic to even taste leave alone eat. After complaining about the same and sening 20 mins just searching for a server then ordered for a repeat of drinks and this time thought of ordering the tried and tested Dry Chilly Chicken. They compensated for the salt this time and the Chilly Chicken was full of salt. Decided enough is enough and neverwould i visit this place again.

the ambiance here  has  two sections ,  The Family cum  GF  section & the STAG section  .  it all depends as to where you are heading  .  The family cum GF section  has excellent ambiance, very well mannered  staff  & good food at a  reasonable price .  in  the stag section the ambiance  is  not  so good but  drinks are available at dead cheap prices .  black Dog  60 Ml here would  cost you  Rs 200 only  .  100 pipers  60 ml & black  & whyte  60 ml would cost you rs 160/60Ml  peg  ,  which i  find is very reasonable .  In food  try not to experiment over  here have the tried & tested stuff in the stag section  .  we had dry chily chicken  costing Rs 115  & crispy chili baby corn costing Rs  80 only .  Overall  a  decent Experience for me But i agree with  JOL FORING  that waiters in the stag section  can  be a  bit rude . In  order to avoid that go in  a  group of  5 or more , that will  do the trick  .

Went to this place a few days back with friends after shopping. We had Chicken Fried Rice, Chilli Chicken and Chicken Manchurian. The quantity of food was more than enough. A bowl of Fried Rice could be easily shared by two people. The only negative point is the staff, our bill was about 900 bucks and we left a decent 50 bucks as tip...but these people were not satisfied and said..'madam, taka ta niye jan...eta rakhar ki ache?' and when we came down we realized that we left one of our umbrellas there. When we went to get it back, they said, kon umbrella? Amra kichu paini...tips na dile umbrella debona' and the staff over there started laughing. Horrible experience. Not coming back.
Watch out for these dangerously ill mannered waiters.
