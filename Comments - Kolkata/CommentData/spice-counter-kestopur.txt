A good joint for vegetarians, this place is a solution for some quick hunger cramps, pocket friendly treat etc. It is open till little late so people nearby can hop here for some coffee, pasta and vada pao to munch. Quality and service is average dont expect much out ot it...

It should not sell pizzas anymore.  on ordering a large pizza, i got a pizza much smaller in size than a medium one . The cheese was crusty and the bread was blant.  also there was barely any cheese on the pizza. the bread hardly could have passed for naan . In conclusion , I could have baked a better pizza at home rather than spending 100s. regrets.

Ordered pizza from the place and it's quite good actually in a place like this. pocket friendly. Will try other things as well. Hopefully they add some non veg items in future.

1.  Listing error. It's not in Howrah. It's in Kestopur itself. Beside NATURAL GREEN housing complex. It's a good joint for fast food take aways. But with no sitting arrangements, it's not that attractive to me.
