Happiness is seeing your parents happy. So it was my treat to mom dad !! Ordered smoky chicken , chilli chicken and mixed noodles . Although both the chicken dishes were gravy less ,but trust me very few eateries provide such quality of food where you don't require gravy to mix with the noodles. Ample amount of chicken and shrimp were there in the noodles. Good experience overall.

Finally a good Chinese delivery chain in my area with very much affordable price. I love cozy and small Chinese restaurant with Chinese theme. They give me warmth of food. This one is the same. The night was chilling and I ordered mix hakka noodles for takeaway. It was a good experience overall. I will point out all:
1. Packaging was awesome
2. Noodle quality and quantity was good 
3. Chiken was soft and plenty.

What else u need. GST is 5%. 

Go and order ASAP.

‚ÄúChinese food tries to engage the mind, not just the palate; To provoke the intellect.‚Äù

Yes, today I‚Äôm starting with this line cause I love Chinese Cuisine. To be vry frank, after I‚Äôve started dieting, it has become my BAE on my CHEAT DAYs‚Ä¶. So, it was my CHEAT DAY and me along with my fellow team members of Team Panch Phoron, went to visit Noddle Oodle Express which is in Salt Lake, Baisakhi.
                                                                ...

Noodle Oodle express has come up with a new kisok in Salt lake mainly for the office goers. It is mainly a take away and delivery outlet and one speciality about them is  that they have started the tiffin box  concept for the working people. 
I know it can be hard to make lunch and carry it to your workplace but nothing to worry coz noodle Oodle will.make your work easy. They will be delivering tiffin box from 12.30p.m.-3.30p.m.

And coming back to the food it was great. We tasted lots of things from their starters and main course section like the stir fried broccoli mushroom, honey lemon chicken, golden fried prawns and many more, smoky chicken

It was truely marvellous to galore upon them.
If you love Chinese food and love exploring then definitely this is for you. And for your comfort you can call for home delivery as well. 

So what are you waiting for??? Just daily the number and galore upon your favourite dish.
Happy eating üòäüòä

This is a express of the popular food joint by the same name situated opppsite to the Diamond Plaza. We recently tried to butter garlic rice, the veg noodles, dry chilly fish and chilly chicken. The quantity was excellent and the quality of the food was amazing. The taste is really different and a change from the usual chinese we often have. Going to order up real soon once again.

Having tried their food in Jessore Road (Opposite Diamond Plaza) this concept somehow i liked, small eatery but service is quick, its also gives you an option to carry your food at home,or, order from online.

but i prefer to go and have it, when i came to know that Noodle oodle Express Opened at Baishakhi, Salt lake. (at AG Block)

three tables, neat and clean (they must continue that), inside is air conditioned.

Food:

Ordered LAT MA KAI & KONJEE CRISPY LAMB both were good.

in main Course ordered sliced lamb in Black pepper sauce & wok tossed noodles.

i must recommend them to keep DUMPLINGS. Overall i was happy with my experience.

Best Wishes !!

Just ate from their salt lake outlet, had ordered a dry chili chicken and a roasted lamb, and I loved both of them. The neat was tender and juicy, the seasoning was balanced and the food reached piping hot. After ages enjoyed an oriental meal in a home delivery. Good food, reasonably priced. Totally loved it.

This tiny restaurant is located right opposite the outlet of VIP sweets , and a stone's throw away from Gupta's Tea Shop. The place has two tables , with chairs for four people in all. The food here doesn't have momos, but they've got fried baby corn on their menu. The service is not good, so do consider packing for  home, instead of eating at this restaurant. The order is served fairly quick . The noodle Oodle special noodles they served tasted undercooked and burnt at the same , so it's a mystery how they manage to price it at 200 bucks , taxes included. However , it had a fried egg served on top of the dry noodles , just for that (special) touch(!) The food here is groslly overpriced , given the quality of food served here.  So , order at your own risk.
