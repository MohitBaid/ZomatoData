One of the finest restaurants in Kolkata:

Pros:
1. Awesome decor & ambiance
2. Sinfully tasty food (Biriyani, Tangri kebab, dal all awesome)
3. Location and parking GOOD
4. Staff Bit COLD but very professional

Cons:
1. Pretty Expensive (Value for money I will give them a 65%)
2. portions are bit small 
3. Serving time about 30 mins +
4. Strict Dress code

Caution: DO NOT GO WITH A nearbuy.com coupon, u will be served spoonful's of food and greeted with cat-stares

Went for casual dining over here as I had heard much about this place. 
But frankly after one visit I was not really amazed or impressed with this place. 
Ambience and service are really nice, but food is nothing special. Also in my opinion the items are actually overpriced and you can find better food than this at lower cost elsewhere.

Zaranj is amongst the old fine dine restaurants in Kolkata.
Interiors are good,pleasing but  the old furniture and upholstery let's down the fine dine status.

It serves  NW frontier and Mughlai cuisine.

My friends were happy cause they had fish delicacies.
I thought I could sample some authentic vegetarian Bengali food but had to order something similar I had for lunch.
I started with fresh lime and highly recommended dahi ke kabab,No regrets for listening to my colleague,was amongst the best I had till now.

For main course I wanted to go for mushroom dhaniya but he suggested paneer makhni,It was very tangy,they hadn't balanced sour tomatoes well,and too much fat.
Next dal amritsari,second disappointment of the evening,subtle flavours of ginger or khatas of amchur or anardana as described missing ,tempering was good though.
Roti's were good crispness near perfect.
Jeera rice,good aged basmati rice mild fragrant.

The desert Rasmalai corrected the sourness created and half serving of malai kulfi very generously shared by my colleague settled the thing completely.

Service was good except a slight issue.

This place has been losing its sheen over the last few years. At present, nothing but the price column suggests you are at a premium dining place. The maintainence standards are below average....service is very poor. Air conditioning is not adequate and the seating appears cramped. The food taste is not like it used to be and the portion size is shrinking. Unfortunately....after our last two outings there....all of us suffered from discomfort at night due to heartburn and stomach ache. Since it has happened twice of late....perhaps I can assume it has to do something with the quality of ingredients used. Zaranj in its present state is best avoidable as you have scores of other options in this premium category where better dining experience is meted out.

Although zaranj is unbeatable incomparable and it is my all time favourite place but it lacked behind in serving us hot food during our lunch visit on 23rd august with my family. We were the coupon holder but that doesn't mean that food will be served room temperature. Panner tikka to tandoori alu to dahi kabab to pindi chana.......nothing was served hot. 
A restaurant zaranj type should not be partial by any means. Food quality was also inferior as compared. 
Never ever expected from them.

5/5 for the ambiance and service but utterly disappointed with the food. I tried a bit of chicken soup, fish amtitsari, fish kebab, chicken makhani, kadhai chicken, kaali dal, peeli dal, roti, jeera rice, ice cream and jaljeera. Yes.. A bit of all.. ;)
For all main course dishes i found that there was excessive usage of tomatoes in the preparation making all tastes very sour. Fish too had a peculiar smell. Jaljeera had loads of masala and creaminess of ice cream was missing (small ice particles could be felt while eating).
Thumbs up for the ambiance and hospitality but don't expect much from the food which is heavily priced.

The restaurant has lush and classy interiors and a 5 star ambiance. The food is mostly mughlai, it was tasty and ample in quantity. The staff were polite and interactive in helping us choose some of their best dishes. We had ordered chicken shorba,peas polao,chicken makhani,chicken nawabi kebabs and veg navratna kebabs. While the navratna kabab and shorba were just okay, the chicken nawabi kebabs were succulent. Overall this place gives you a feel of an expensive fine-dining experience

I had recently bveen with a couple of friends to Zaranj restaurant located close to the Indian museum near the New Market area. Zaranj has always been known to serve some of the finest delicacies from the north western region of the country, and it was time that i got to taste dome of their most sought after dishes.
In Starters, we ordered a plate of Tandoori Aloo, Paneer Shashlik and two plates of Murgh Tandoori, accompanied by Jal Jeera in drinks. The Tandoori murgh and Aloo turned out to be great in taste. Paneer shashlik was decent, whereas the Jal Jeera drink was well balanced and quite refreshing in taste.
In the main course, we had ordered a Murgh makhni (an all time favorite), Dhania murgh and a Rogan Josh, which is a personal favorite and a classic. From the veg section, we ordered Paneer makhni and yellow dal, accompanied with rice and tandoori rotis. It was quite a lavish layout, but every bit of it was worth it. The food was simply amazing in taste and variety. Plus, the service standards and the portion sizes was a thumps up from my side. The Rogan josh and Paneer makhni were my two favorites out of this experience, and the rotis were made to perfection. My friends were at a loss of words due to the lavish treatment of food and service that they had just received. 
Overall, it was one of the fining dining experiences that one should enjoy at peace with friends and family.

So i visited this place with a lot of anticipation...having heard that it is one of the oldest and most posh fine dining restaurant in Kolkata.

I went there for lunch on a Sunday.It was adequately crowded  and the staff was courteous.Now at this point we had to choose between the Indian and Chinese section of the restaurant.Some of us wanted to eat Indian while some wanted Chinese.But the staff made it clear that u cant have any chinese dishes if u sit in the Indian section.So no flexibility.Thats a thumbs down.We opted for the Indian section.

We ordered veg au gratin, mushroom da dhaniya,paneer and yellow dal.Among breads we took lasuni paratha,bharwa kulcha and laccha paratha.
The food was okayish...!The spoiler being the yellow dal.It had no taste and was priced at rs585!!!!FOR A DAAL!!!!!
So yeah no value for money or time.

There is no rating less than one otherwise I would have rated it lower than one.  Pathetic service,  no food quality nor taste. I had went to place along with my in laws with lot of expectation. We had ordered Chicken Bharta and Paneer Makhani in main course. Both items very extremely sour,  the taste was so horrible that we could not eat it,  and have to leave the table without dinner,  I hope this is worst thing to happen with anyone. The place has spoiled my special occasion with my family. I had given feedback to the floor manager about the taste and our bitter experience and manager instead of trying to get the food replaced just told that he will try to get the things right next time. Is this a reply of reputed restaurant, no this is not acceptable . I know  I could not do anything else other than never to go to this place and never to suggest anyone to go

I'm a big Zaranj fan. The decor is fantastic, with a little rivulet flowing through and the food is superlative. Try the Zaranji Raan; the Peshawri Burra Kebab won't disappoint. I would avoid Saturdays though as the service was uncharacteristically sloppy last Sat and we had to wait for over an hour to get our food. Still, an excellent place to dine out - especially, with the family.

Atmosphere of this place is good. But menus are overpriced. They do not mention in the little or nearbuy coupon quantity of food (ex. No of chicken/mutton pieces)  they provide. I got only 2pieces of chicken in starter, 2pieces of chicken in chicken main course and only 1mutton piece in mutton main course.Quantity of peas pulao was also very poor. Food they provide at Rs 449 Little coupon is not enough for 1 adult. So those who want to buy coupon from little / nearbuy be careful otherwise u will feel cheated. Will advice management to mention the quantity of (chicken/mutton/fish) in the coupon.

We found ourselves at Zaranj after much discussion about legendary places to dine in Kolkata. Much to our surprise it was exactly as was described to us. The revamped version of Zaranj is warm and brings about the heritage that has brought this place it's much deserved praise. The soothing sound of the waterfall was just the perfect setting in this ambience. 
The dinner started with some complementary crisp roasted 'papad' accompanied with what can be described as a green salad and some condiments. The mint chutney was not the average chutney that one usually gets and was made with yogurt and was delectable; the sweet pickle was too sweet for our taste. 
The Tomato Shorba that we ordered was pretty average and could be worked upon to bring it to its fame. The Fresh Lime Soda (Sweet and Salt) left us wanting for a better taste as well. It was more lime and less of everything else, the soda was flat as well. 
On recommendations from other patrons we ordered the Dahi ke Kebab and the Tandoori Aloo. 
The Dahi ke Kebab and the accompanying hung curd dip was pretty average, but the Tandoori Aloo left was wanting for more. 
We moved on to a more 'Continental' palate and ordered an Au Gratin. Though not authentic it was still pretty decently prepared and was possibly better than what one would find at your average 'North Indian' restaurant. 
While the service for the appetisers was very quick, we waited for 20 minutes before our dinner was served, which was such a put off. 
The Maa Ki Dal which is basically their version of the black Dal, sumptuous and worthy of the accolades that it's got. 
The Paneer Makhani and Pindi Chana were good too. 
The Pindi Chana lacked a bit of salt though. 
The rotis were crisp and well made, as were the parathas. The Lasuni Paratha with all its earthy and garlicky flavours, and its divine crispness is a definite recommendation. 
The service and the ambience overall is a huge tick, but the food can be worked upon a bit to maintain its legendary pedestal.

When it comes to joints, the things I am a succor for are good ambience, service and if the music happens to be modern combo version of the 60s blues & saxophone jazz, then I am flat out fan of it.....this place happens to be all that....
The food.... actually the thai food tasted "simple plain old thai" for a change, a big relief from the Indianized versions....
The fare.... didn't mind the extra buck (₹875 to be precise) but it was relatively very less (ridiculously low rather....)....it's worth every penny, believe me, you won't regret (provided you are more of an evening rather than morning person and if you are into the old world charm kinda thing).... strongly recommended....

I have been 2 this restaurant few times and always enjoyed the food. 
The ambience with an open kitchen looks impressive. 
The green chutney and murabba that they serve with onions are very tasty. 
The curries and more importantly the breads are nicely done.

It is a heaven for food lovers with elegant decors and pleasant ambience.

For starters , we took the following-

Murg Shorba soup , which tasted exciting, rich, aromatic and savoury.

Masala papad with 3 kind of pickle is an innovative idea. Papad with sweet mango pickle suited more.

Murgh nawabi was very palatable flavourful and tender.
Jugalbandhi sheek kebab was also flavoursome, tender and was served with Pudina sauce.

Fresh lime soda was enjoyable, perfect blend of sweet & sour.
Virgin mojito mixed with blue lagoon was surprising and a unique piece.

For main course, we had the following -
Tandoor roti, butter naan, Maa ki dal, Dal Amritsari, Machli begum bahar, Murgh Makhani, veg pulao , peas pulao & green salad.

Naan & roti were soft, warm with a fine crunch.
Dals were thick , creamy and well cooked, and served as a good combo with Indian breads.

Machli begum bahar was extremely nice, fresh Bhetki with a flavourful mixture of jeera, ajwain had spicy gravy and a must try.

Murgh Makhani was very tender, soft, succulent, well cooked with a top notch taste . A must try.

Pulao were ok, nothing to rave about.

As desserts, we had gulab jamun, rajbhog and choco ice cream. Rajbhog was the best out of the three.

Service was quick. Pocket pinch is a little high but adjustable as per quality. A must visit for authentic Indian food lovers.

Highly rated place with average quality food. 

Wins: Well trained staff, one of them being a real life remake of Charlie Chaplin 😁.
Ambience. Small streams of water flowing all around.
Prawns kebab. It was yummilicious. And mirch paranthe 

Losses: Cramped spaces. Not so tasty food. Be it the chicken, fish, dahi kebab, tandoori aloo or paneer tikka. Very dry preparations. Fish and chicken lacked juice and color. 

The main course was a bit of a saviour. The cocktails and mocktails were better. We tried the watermelon cooler and virgin mojito.

Extremely costly but not worth it.

Of all the restaurants I have been to in Calcutta, I would not hesitate for a second to state that this is my all time favourite and "THE BEST"....The ambience, the food, the service- everything surpasses excellence. The price is moderately high but every bit of it is worth spending. I am crazy about Biriyanis and North Indian Cuisine and I can vouch for the fact that a person who is a true foodie and is visiting Calcutta for the first time should not return back without trying out at this place! It is ethereal....simply ethereal!!! 🤗🤗

The elegant and the most pretigious among others in Kolkata fine dinings. This place needs an applaud. I love this place because of the ambience that gives you a feel elegance and decorum. Though did not have much chance to visit but yes once I was there and it was winter. They were having a special turkey festival. With other dishes I was totally flattered with the turkey and cranberry sauce. One must visit this place if you are a foodie. Looking forward to visit soon here.

One of the best places in town to try Mughlai cuisine. I've been here 3-4 times and every time it has enthralled me. When you first step into the restaurant the décor would surely make you fall in love with it. The tables are well attended and they serve a basket of papad,salad and some tidbits like aam chutney,aam achar and a pudina curd dip. There is a long list of items one can choose from. I've tried mutton sheekh kabab, chicken tikka, mutton barrah,  Amritsari macchi tikka as starters. The main course contained mutton biriyani, laccha paratha, mutton rogan josh,chicken kadai. It's definitely one of the best fine dine in Kolkata.

Zarang is like a an Matured Wine. As years pass by it matures with time. Love the Décor plush and Nice. Love the Water fall which has some what like a mini Lake and a well made Bridge to cross. 

Coming to the food Nawabhi Chicken Kebab was excellent nice and Juicy, Dahi Kebab was ok, Paneer Tikka was great, Tandoori Chicken finely done, Fish Amritsari need more fire. It was too bland.

Main Course Kali dal was superb Paneer Butter was nice gravy was rich Chicken Tikka was a put off Chana Masala good full of Spices which was awesome.

Over all a great Experience.

What an amazing place. We all came for our team lunch here. A beautiful restaurant with such soothing ambiance. We had got nearbuy vouchers for a five course meal. It was a delicious experience. Started of with a chicken shorba which was perfectly balanced and had really nice flavours. The fish kebab was out of the world..flaky fish with a really nice taste. The naan was another thing which had different taste. Coated with poppy seeds it was completely different from the regular ones we have. The dal makhani was flavourful with a tomato curry..the peas pulao and the chicken makhani were equally good. A must visit for everyone.

Ok so Zaranj is legendary, i didnt know about it till about 20 years of my existence in Kolkata. One day i chanced upon it for lunch. And my, i wasnt disappointed at all. 
Best appetizer: Dahi Kebab. Hands down. ive never had a better one. 
Best Main course: Tried the paneer butter masala, kali dal and lachha paratha. Their Lachha paratha is to die for. One of the best in town. If you visit Z, u need to have Lachha paratha. 
Keep up the good work. .
Cheers!

Purchased 5 course meal lunch coupon through nearbuy as the Deal was at a good price .went there for a lunch with my family 
The ambience of the restaurant is classic and it gives you feeling of a heritage hotel.
Our deal included tomato soup /dal makhani/ panner sashlik /panner butter masala /nan/veg pulao/ice cream
Starters and main course were good but the best thing was dal makhani which was smoky and very nicely made .
And the servers serving were also very courteous and  the service was good 

Had a very good experience heard good things about zaranj but never had a chance to go earlier ,regret that missed it for so many years 
One or the best north indian serving restaurant if not the best

A legendary place on sudder street opp. Indian museum. The food quality has been superb since its inception. 
The soups are all good and flavourful.
Machli masala kebab- extremely soft and delicious.
Murgh tangri kebab- tasted great
Dahi kebab- fresh, soft and yummy.
Love their chutney. They are very consistent. 
Hyderabadi biryani- flavourful and good. 

The amvbience is what it has always been. That makes it legendary....but they need to modernise. Furniture is old, sofa and chair covers look royal but are dirty and have not been cleaned for ages. The wall, ceiling, curtain....all are in bad condition. 

Staff is old and well trained but need to be more welcoming. 

The complimentary papad and salad they setve have scope of improvement w.r.t service given the current competitive market. 

Overall good quality food....ambience and presentation needs improvement since its highly priced. Over priced w.r.t service.

Insane food. Very very overpriced! I can't think of a better way to describe Zaranj! Their food is super tasty but the prices are even higher than a 5 star hotel which is quite shocking to see. The food in general is quite heavy and the abundant use of butter makes it really heavy. Even though I loved the food, I'd have to give it a 4 on 5 simply because of the value for money.

This place was on my list since long with a lot of expectations as it is one of the oldest and renowned Restaurant's in the city. Finally, i landed up there today!
I am totally delighted with their hospitality and great service and ofcourse the food..They have a separate Bar section! The ambience was not appealing to me, might be coz some renovation was going on(thy might b working on it)..but never mind, the food and the service makes it up for all..bt what i really liked was the water fall, the royal seating and the semi-oxidised steel plates in wch the food is served. They provide u with a complementary basket of papad and mint chutney. Everything we ordered was just perfect wch includes tomato shorba(soup)-i really liked it,dahi ke kabab- it was one time try,paneer makhani-delicious,kaali daal- one of the best, jeera rice,butter naan, chocolate ice cream and  mint tulip mocktail wch was really refreshing. Must try it. Although we had a voucher but it is otherwise expensive. And i got to hear tht ppl whu go thr with vouchers are not treated well.So i wanted a personal experience before believing to the rumours. And it indeed was a rumour. Their service and hospitality is commendable. And it feels good when u r served and treated well! :) 
I am very much satisfied with the place..So would visit again coz Its worth it :) And might be they get some new decor, so i wl surely check it out.:p
Once a must visit place for all foodies!

Just like this famous idiom, "Heart is where Home is".. Yes my maternal home is in Calcutta..:D Whenever moi gets time off, moi plans a short vacay to Kolkata.. And visiting to Zaranj is in my to-do-list.. Come what may i invariably have to go to Zaranj.. I repeat HAVE To go to Zaranj;) .. So lets get started:
First up is The Ambience: Its situated near new market area literally hidden.. Those who know will definitely pay a visit.. Just like me.. Upon entering this restaurant one will find the rose petal decorated in the biggest vase filled with water.. Then you are greeted with waterfall like sound.. Thats the Usp.. Slow soft water cascading over pebbled rocks.. Looks awesome.. Sounds enchanting! And the seating is royal as well.. 
Next up is The Food: Food is served in semi oxidised steel plate.. Unusually different from normal steel plates.. Greeted with complimentary Papads alongwith mint chutney.. And i have my fixed menu.. So without much delay my order from the menu is:
Paneer tikka: I love the Paneer tikka of this place.. Flavours oh soo fabulous.. I sometimes wish to ask the chef to teme the recipe;)
Laccha Paratha: This is the only place in kolkata that i love North indian Bread more than veggies.. Its simply crisp and very yummy.. I literally devour the paratha without any guilt of getting fat;) Must TRY this paratha!
Mix Vegetable: The gravy and veggies that are tossed in it make it delicious..
Maa ki Daal: finger lickingly yummilicious..
Moi is not a fan of north indian cuisine.. But this place is an exception.. Keep up the quality of the food!
Lastly, The Service and Pocket Pinch: The staff serves it properly.. The service is quick.. However it pinches hard on the pocket.. It is expensive and should be priced moderately! If in Kolkata please do visit Zaranj and youll be amazed to have tasty delicacies prepared by them.. Please do post your thoughts.. Would love to hear it from you guys.. Thanks!

I had visitors from USA come in and we decided to go to Zaranj. Even though this place is so old, I had never tried it myself but my friend who I came with was all praises. We went. The person who took the order was very considerate and suggested items that were safe to be consumed by foreigners. He even knew what americans would like and apparently europeans like something else.
We requested for lesser spice in everything and they complied with our request. I have not given 5 stars since the waiter who served us our food was a little unaware of a few basic rules while serving us but then its okay since he looked new and young.
Their gulab jamuns are so good that because of that night, the Americans had gulab jamuns throughout their stay in India and they still talk about it when I speak to them.
Keep it up Zaaranj.

Made a mistake buying a voucher from nearbuy for this place.
The classic case of promising the world and then delivering peanuts.

The positives : ambience,location and cutlery

Now comes the reasons for annoyance :

1.they serve starters,quite naturally the plate gets soiled;they serve soup on a bowl which is kept on the same soiled plate.after finishing the soup they dont have the courtesy or the common sense to change the plate before main course is served.Something so basic,that you'd never even notice this unless its not done.

2. coming to the deal itself.  The soup was woeful with little or no chicken .The Amritsari fish that we took as starter was well cooked,although only 2 pieces. Now coming to the main course ,we ordered chicken in white gravy ,dal,jeera rice and naan.Well,the chicken was served in a bowl as small as it can get.barely 2 or 3 tiny pieces of minced chicken.To put it into perspective ,the net chicken content was barely half of what you'd be given in a standard plate of biriyani. Now coming to the dish itself.The gravy was as watery as...yes,water. Simply put,it was horrendous.The dal was smelly and once again given in a bowl that would not do justice even to an infant's appetite.

3.Left the place hungry and dissatisfied,vowing never to return again.

Concluding,would like to say.. Please stop fooling around with customers Zaranj. Just because someone comes via nearbuy ,it doesnt mean you get a free pass at serving gibberish and getting away.Please stop offering "deals" when you know that you cant deliver on your inflated promises. A little bit of introspection and honesty can make you a much better enterprise . Peace out.

Would recommend it for any tandoor delicacies 
I wish if they can improve their offerings

Had been to this place after a long time. It's still the same, nothing has changed. The flavours are same too. Ordered dahi kebab, paneer tikka, black dal, kumbh hara dhania,  paneer makhani and assorted Indian breads.

Taste wise food is good and is Same as it is from years. But I was not at all satisfied with the service and the cleanliness of the place. In fact,  one of our plates was having cockroach, which was removed by us. So would request the management to please check into this.

Zaranj is one of the very old restaurants of Kolkata which have always been known for it good food and hospitality.
Very easy to locate near Indian Museum. Went for lunch with friends. It is quite spacious and we'll decorated.
Coming to the food. We ordered their tomato shorba which was quite good. For starters we had Paneer Tikka, Tandoori Aloo and Hara Bhara Kebab. I have to say the starters were quite good. They serve it with green chutney and their specialty the cream. I just love that cream, it goes very well with the starters and is very smooth.
For main course we ordered Dal Makhni, Paneer Makhni, Mixed Veg and the Mushroom dish. What I din like was the fact that the Paneer and Mixed Veg was in the same gravy and was almost the same thing. The person taking the order should have advised against it. Another thing is that the portion sizes is not very great. We ordered a assorted basket of breads. All were quite good.
The reason I gave 3.5 is that over the years I couldn't see any change in the menu or decor. The service also wasn't that great. All in all I would say the food is quite good, but compared to the many new restaurants in Kolkata it has nothing great to offer.

Yesterday, I went to have lunch at Zaranj, expecting to have a good time with good food. But alas, due to the rubbish latter, the whole experience was ruined. The waiters were all in a hurry, resulting in promt service but not good service. Starting with the soup murgh shorba , was bland. The fish tikka was good, but then the main course mutton that we ordered was terrible. The mutton pieces were stringy, rubbery and the gravy was just sad. It was watery, bland and just plain tasteless. The quality of food has obviously detoriated by miles and I wouldn't recommend Zaranj now, even to my enemy. At such high prices, Zaranj doesnt live upto the mark. No more zaranj for me.

I admired the decor for about an half an hour from the moment I entered. This place looks so beautiful, as far as I could decode the theme of the decor is medieval India. it has a artificial waterfall kinda thing in the middle. Everything around looks like a setup of a Sanjay Leela Bhansali movie and Im not even exaggerating .we ordered tomato shorba and tandoori aloo for starters. I generally am not very fond of tomato soup but surprisingly this one was impressive.  Tandoori aloo was heavenly! I anyway have a thing for potatoes. Served with mint curd chutney, sweet pickle and spicy mango pickle pickle along with salad. Next comes the Maa ki dal ( kali dal) , Navaratan kofta and Butter naan. 
the kali dal was yum-yum! the navaratan kofta is something i tried for the first time and can't deny that i loved it too. Butter naans were served hot and soft.we accompanied our meal with virgin mojito which was just average. we ended this experience with one scoop of ice cream each served in really fancy silver goblets.
Happy eating! :)

Despite everyone trying to convince me that Zaranj standards had dropped sharply & it wasn't what I remembered from years ago, we went ahead & booked ourselves for dinner one Sunday, two weeks ago.
While being led to our table, I desperately tried to ignore the worn out, musty, old carpet & over worked staff. Alas, the food was not a patch on the past glory. All I had gone back was the dahi ke kababs, which were a huge disappointment! They served the curd after 5 reminders only to tell me that its over, don't ask for more! The serving for dal was in the smallest bowl possible. 
Alas, it was an evening of grossly over priced, below average food.
The icing on the cake was seeing Marwari families gorging on the Sheermal, which Zaranj masquerades as Lachha Paratha! Wondering what the poor, unsuspecting folks would think knowing that egg is a key ingredient of the authentic recipe!
The not so amusing bit was the realisation that we'd lost a culinary gem from the Calcutta food scene.

Was there for Lunch in some weekday located near Park Street Metro, Once you enter in the restaurant you would feel like you are in 1970 film the interior are so well done. It will compensate all other flaws. Food was good in taste, overall it is one of the hidden gems in Kolkata.

This place needs to work on the old cutlery, chairs, the paint. It used to be the best indian restaurant in town. 

I am really disappointed with the outlook. Even though I have no complain against food but first impression has given a low low feeling. 

Staff very busy as do not have time to place spoon on the table. So when you reserve a table next time, make sure to reserve one full time staff to be present. Otherwise you will need one guest for calling them every 2 minutes.

We came here on an office dinner. A bunch of folks from Gurgaon, Bangalore and Cal.

It has a nice location, right next to the Indian museum. While the food is good (Kashmiri cuisine), the service better, there is nothing spectacular about the place. We sat in the main restaurant, there is also a pub/bar attached which I peeked inside but found quite a damp squib.

A visit to this place was totally unplanned. I went there to meet a couple of friends who were actually supposed to meet me somewhere else but ultimately landed up here. When outside, you generally tend to miss this entrance after taking the lane beside the Indian museum. Then finally when you're about the enter, you'll be awestruck with the classic uniform security, gigantic door and beautifully decorated lobby. Then I was asked to go straight and on reaching found me in this place with a lounge sort of a feeling, constant smell of hookah and a really big open bar. On meeting my friends, I found they had a couple of beers and some sides which they said was really well made. The service seemed to be really good. Another thing to be mentioned are their toilets, it is a beautifully decorated area and extremely clean. Alcohol is present in a really large stock and the pricing is not very high. 
Recommended place for sure.

Age old Kolkata institution serving great mughlai food. We went to Zaranj after ages the other day through a group on voucher. I was glad to know that the restaurant has still maintained its food standards. The dal was still very tasty and the breads were very good. I liked the chicken kebab and my wife liked her vegetarian food as well. However, the restaurant is in need of a face lift. Also, they should build some sort of a seperation at the entrance between zaranj and 1658 as the loud music at times disturbs the formal atmosphere of the restaurant. All in all, as always, you wont be dissapointed.

Stopped by Zaranj after almost 10 years. I am sorry to say that I was thoroughly disappointing. Here are the highlights:

-> Waiter took an order for an Indian Chai, brought us English Breakfast style tea. Would not take the order back on pointing out the mistake.
-> There was hair in the chicken reshmi
-> The mutton was extremely tough. Was almost impossible to tear it apart.
-> Zaranj did not adjust the charge for a single item above. They had offered to replace the chicken once our meal was finished but it was of no use then as the hair had killed our appetite anyway. 
-> We had to argue with them for almost 30 mins to get the (a) Chai and (b) Chicken removed from the bill. The way I see it, the meal should have been on the house with sincere apologies for ruining a fine dining experience.

-> Would never, ever go back to the place again.
REPEAT: Would never, ever go back to the place again.

I have a fifty-fifty opinion about this place. Recently visited with family on my sister's birthday. The decor and cutlery give u an old world charm. Especially the table layout and stuff. Food wasn't all that brilliant as per the rates charged. Kebabs were ordinary. Pindi chana, which is essentially a dry semi spicy item, was served in semi gravy and tasted like boiled. Prompt replacement was done but not much difference in taste.

My advice to go to Taj's sonar gaon where they will charge the same but give quality inindian food.
They did not have any other kababs apart from reshmi. Bad bad b'day experience.

Ambience - Classy, you start to fall in love with it from its very first glance...

Food - Great, we ordered Dal Makhani, Paneer Makhani and Pindi Channa in main course and all of them mouth watering and delicious... But the master stroke is there breads, specially lacha parathas... Starters and drinks are also really good...

Service - Very good, all the waiters are cordial and really nice...

All in all a wonderful fine dining restaurant... A must visit for people who like North Indian Food...

Valet parking makes your visit hassle free. The restaurant is a place to be, when you wish for an expensive meal. The full height ceiling makes this place look very spacious, the fountain pouring with water, the open tandoor area. Tye restaurant serves free salad bowl.

It was my visit after 14 years and I am happy to say they have maintained their standards. We ordered seekh kabab , murgh nawabi which was just delicious. Murgh tangri kebab was also tasty.For main course we had butter chicken, butter garlic naan, kulcha. Ambience is nice and the food is pretty good.
Ambience - 5/5
Service - 4/5
Food - 3.5/5
Overall experience -4/5
I would recommend it.

One of the historic legendary places of Kolkata, this beauty is serving amazing north Indian delacies from a very long time(and I mean it). Their interiors are good old huge chairs with very neat interiors and the Ambience is very soothing as you find very soft instrumental or melodies playing as you enjoy your evening with your family.. The food is as delicious as its presentation as well.
A definite visit with your family...

Dined there last week and let me tell u the place has lost its charm..the place needs a good restructuring as all the upholstery has stained and faded.. What zaranj used to be it no longer is tht way.. Coming to the food, that too has lost its taste.. A few items are worthy of mention which were the nawabi chicken and the jugalbandi kabab and the lasooni paratha . The amritsari dal which is the yellow dal was outright bland and u can make better dal at home than tht. Do try the almond drink- it's fabulous. Though over priced say 220(inclusive of taxes) for a small glass but that's what I go to this place for

The Place has a good ambiance & a very good feel to it & brother did give a very good review at the joint but the whole thing was quiet unsatisfactory for me as where price is concerned you guys are quiet pricey but the food was not up to it the fish we ordered was very salty but at the same time I loved the Virgin Mohito's & The Tandoori Aaloo. I hope that the next time I visit I get to taste a bit more of your delicacies with more zest.

Its situated near Fort william & GPO.Opulent, if a little over the top, with a fountain, ornate furniture, and red tablecloths and upholstery, Zaranj remains popular for its North Indian and tandoori classics. A major standout is the Zaranji raan, a whole leg of goat marinated in Indian spices and slowly grilled—it takes a good 30-40 minutes to prepare, but it melts in your mouth. Overall goo experience

1 of the oldest names in the city for north frontier cuisine. Limited variety for vegetarians but the options available are definitely well made. One of its signature item is 'laccha parantha'.  Wont get such a parantha anywhere else but zaranj. To relish the paranthas you definitely have to give the calories a miss that day. The best part they have maintained their taste over the years.

We landed up at Zaranj as the place we had initially planned was full and we had not made reservations. When we reached the restaurant, we encountered a person behind a computer screen who didn't bother to look up and greet us. The half occupied restaurant on a Saturday night also didn't inspire much confidence. But after approaching the person behind the computer and mentioning our last-minute reservation, we were seated. 
The ambience of the restaurant is quite good. Due to the high ceilings, there is a sense of space and openness which I miss in other modern places. The restaurant needs a renovation though. The upholstery on the chairs seem dated and faded ... more colours would brighten up the place which now looks quite pale and bland. The cutlery used is quite nice and good quality ... made of steel perhaps. 
The food though is mediocre. There are only two soup options, i,e. a tomato based and the other chicken based. We ate the chicken one and it was quite good. I ordered a Bloody Marry which tasted poor and I wasn't able to finish the drink. The Amritsari Fish we ordered for starters was completely bland and tasteless. We complained about it to our steward who offered better suggestions for the main course. We ordered their Dal Makhani and Chicken Kadhai both of which tasted good. 
This restaurant demands premium pricing but the food is average. An ITC restaurant would immediately waive the charge for a dish if we complained the way did about the fish or at the least offer a free desert. No such courtesies were on offer at Zaranj. This place is not much value for money. Would avoid in future.

One of the very old Indian restaurants in the middle of the commercial part of the city, at one point attracted a lot of foreigners staying around the area for Indian food. 

Though the food from what I remember is slightly above average nowadays, the serious let down is the ambience. The furnitures, crockery and cutlery are all so heavy which adds to the suffocation of this place. Personally, avoid! You have far better places to cherish

Peaceful place to spend time with friends n family away from the usual hustle bustle that one generally find in a restaurant on weekends.

The Machi Masala Kabab is a definite item to try. Was a lil disappointed with the Veg Kabab Platter though as it had sizeable amount of onion pieces in both Dahi Kabab and Hariyali Kabab which was very unusual but the tandoori aloo and paneer were out of the world. A lil heavy on ur pocket but still a place to go once in a while

Zaranj - a literally "heritage site" when it comes to restaurants in Kolkata. The place is located well, has valet service for car parking and beautiful interiors. I especially loved the flowers and the big giant mirror on the wall - only hope was that they used to have the water fountain which wasn't one working the day I went for dinner. The food is tasty - special mention for the masala papad and the dahi kabab with the absolutely yum hung curd dip. We also order paneer, dal and lacche paranthe. The pudina laccha parantha was good but the normal one was hard. The waiters were courteous and helpful while taking the order. The only drawback of this place is the pricing - Rs 1000-1100 per head for a vegetarian order having one side dish, two mains and two breads with two drinks. The quantity served does not justify the price point. All in all, a good place but reserved for special occasions when you plan to splurge.

Zaranj comes before the Indian Museum on the way to Park Street. This place is elegantly decorated and is quite big, with old styled furniture and neat interiors. The food here is quite delicious but the quantity is not enough and the charges are sky high.

This is a brilliant place but the biggest downside is the price. It's not justified for the quantity they serve.

Contributing to Kolkata's understanding growth of "bistronomy", Zaranj channels a chic restaurant vibe while serving you really, really good food expected of a far stiffer restaurant.

We begin with ‘Murg Shorba’ soup, it was exciting and startling in both texture and flavour combination. It had just the right amount of spice and savour; rich & flavourful chicken soup with a unique blend of aromatic herbs and cubes of chicken, you might find yourself gulping it all up before you even realise.

Complementary ‘Masala Papad’ accompanied with three kind of pickle was a nice idea. I specially enjoy the papad with sweet mango pickle. Nice munch out to cover up the waiting time for our starters. They also provided a huge bowl of complementary green salad.

To kick-start our meal, we opted for tandoor items ‘Murgh Nawabi’ and ‘Jugalbandi Seekh Kebab’. Murgh Nawabi was splendid, boneless chicken marinated in seasoned yoghurt, nuts and cream, broiled over a charcoal grill and served with dipped onion rings, green chilli, lemon slice and roasted capsicums. The murgh nawabi was very pleasing to the palate –extremely flavourful, juicy, tender and beautifully seared on the outside. Then we straight went for the Jugalbandi Seekh Kebab, a twin layered kebab of chicken and lamb mince, flavoured with handpicked Indian herbs and spices. It was succulent, flavoursome and tender; and served with a homemade pudina sauce. The jugalbandi seekh kebab was, however, good enough on its own.

If you need a drink to quell the spiciness, their ‘Fresh Lime Soda’ and ‘Virgin Mojito’ will do the trick. Fresh lime soda was wonderful, perfect blend of sweet and sour but this was the first time I saw Virgin Mojito mixed with blue lagoon, my friend said it was also surprising in taste.

Next we had ‘Tandoori Roti’, ‘Butter Nun’, ‘Maa Ki Dal’ and ‘Dal Amritsari’. Tandoori roti and butter nun both served warm, butter nun had the softness along with crunch. Maa Ki Dal was pleasant, black lentils slowly cooked for hours, finished with cream and white butter. Dal Amritsari was also enjoyable, yellow dal made in the typical Punjabi style with butter. Roti and dals were complementing each other, we devour them very quickly.

After finishing our dal – roti session we love to run through ‘Machli Begum Bahar’, ‘Murgh Makhani’, ‘Veg Pulao’, ‘Peas Pulao’ and ‘Green Salad’ in main. The service was extremely quick and everything looked scrumptious. Machli Begum Bahar was breath-taking, fresh bhetki sautéed in butter and cooked in light tomato gravy flavoured with jeera and ajwain. It tastes so awesome; it made me stay speechless for few seconds. The fish was fresh and sautéed to perfection, and the gravy was spicy and salty, this was certainly a feisty fish. Then I tried Murgh Makhani – boneless chicken with fresh tomatoes, enriched with cream and butter, chicken pieces were very tender and juicy; cooked to perfection. Murgh Makhani was equally top-notch and mind-blowing, hats off to the chef for making those dishes. Both Veg and Peas pulao was average but went well with overwhelming sides.

In desserts we enjoyed, ‘Gulab Jamun’, ‘Raaj Bhog’ and ‘Chocolate Ice Cream’. If you like sweets, be sure to end your meal with the Raaj Bhog! Though gulab jamun and chocolate ice cream were good but I found raaj bhog was better.

With its more relaxed vibe and quiet location beside Indian Museum, Zaranj makes for a nice hideout to chill and have good Indian food. If you're in the Esplanade area, this is the perfect place to dine with your loved ones.

One of my favourite restaurants. It's old and yet has maintained its standards. What I really like here is the tandoori aloo with the sour cream dip that they serve. They also serve complimentary salad and papad. Along with that , the mutton is good too. In the main course , I always have mirchi and lasuni paratha , the black dal is a must and paneer butter masala. I haven't tried the non vegetarian mains but I've heard the chicken is good. In the end , you can have the pista rabri because that's the only rabri I have liked in Kolkata. It's a good place for luxurious Indian dining

I had no idea that a place named Zaranj existed. The name itself gives you a royal feeling...Rajput feeling. I should thank to Groupon which is helping us to try out places at an affordable rates. The place is little too expensive but worth paying. You would be well greeted inside with staff always trying to help you out and guide you. The decor is little different from a normal restaurant. Fountain inside with canals carved inside. I am sure little children will find this place impressive. The cutlery are not like typical glassware but metal plates and glasses. The feeling of tradition.

The food is excellent. The kabab they had served was tender and juicy. The salads along with it was tangy yet spicy. The peas polau was not that heavy as we both do not prefer rice. The black dal with the rice tasted yum yum..mouth watering. The service was really good and we didn't had to wait long.

What I didn't like was the rajbhog, lacked it's authentic taste, was good. They should do something about the air conditioner. It was little hot inside and after you start filling yourself, you would feel your nose and upper lip filling up with water droplets.

Vegetarians, don't feel yourself left out. You too will have many options and so for the mutton lovers. Enjoy eating!

First visited this place almost two decades ago and then for sheer nostalgia again last year. At one point in time, it was the premier North Indian fine dining restaurant in the city but unfortunately it's not kept with the times. The food is still good but the overall experience needs a serious upgrade... However if you like old world dining of 70s Kolkata, then it's worth a visit.

This place is an utter heaven for a North Indian cuisine lover like me, situated very near to Indian museum and a walking distance from the very famous New Market, Zaranj used to dominate Kolkata with their super delicious kebabs and other delicious delicacies in the late 90's. I remember visiting this place when I was quite young, also I have Ben here a number of times with my school friends. 
The best and most important thing about this place is that they serve DELICIOUS QUALITY food. 
The decor and the interiors are very pretty and a visit to this place is definitely not cheap on the pockets but honestly I don't mind paying extra once in a while if the food served is this good. This is one of my favourite North Indian restaurants in the city and one shouldn't miss their Dahi kebabs, Dal Makhni, Murg Bharta & of course their super soft and buttery nuns. 
Last time I was there, I guess it was in the month of February 15' and it was with my sister and some friends of her who came from Mumbai. So apart from the usual dishes we also ordered Bhuna Ghosht Zaranj, Zaranji Raan, Ghosht Reshmi chap & their non veg tandoor platter. The portions are appropriate and as mentioned before there's no compromise with their quality over the years. 
As far as the desserts are concerned, after the starters & main course, it's rather difficult to order a dessert and finish it on my own, since we were a group of 6 we ordered for two Tutti Fruity ice creams which was again quite good. 
This place shouldn't be missed, it's one of a kind. And is highly recommended.

Old world charm with 70s heavy wood decor and old Kolkata uncle staff!

Food is average, although the regulars live it for no reason (just to boast socially). Service level is not great either and the place is expensive relative to other comparable outlets.

Avoid!!!

Suggestion:
Common guys - you have to do a better job of the prices on the menu and the goldmine location that you guys have!!! Improve food quality and staff service levels to match the newer restaurants in town!

Decent Food.Claustrophobic ambience.Out of place tables and chairs, not an inch to move around. Service is extremely slow even on not so crowded nights.Place needs serious makeover, so that there is more room to move around.

So finally I feel happy to review one of my favourites in town!
Zaranj has been the best place for fine family dining! 
I love the famous dahi kebabs which comes with an amazingly creamy dip! Another starter which is a must order is the stuffed tandoori paneer! :)
The black lentils for the main course is agn a must order along with any of the paneer dishes as per choice since all of them are equally good! 
A must mention bread is their famous lachha parathas ! Which is the best possible bread made!
The staff are warm and serve you well! It's always been a happy experience at zaranj! :)

Situated very close to The Indian Museum on Chowringhhe this is a great place which goes back to the late 70s/early 80s. It has a old world ambience,with heavy wood panelled walls reminicent of Gaylords in Connaught Place,Delhi in the 50s and 60s. Tables are well laid out and both cutlery and crockery are well maintained. Service is good and food comes with a 15/20 minute wait..Zaranj basically serves Tandoori and North Indian dishes. The kebabs are the forte here so stick to the popular choices. Rotis,nans,parathas are served hot and are soft and well baked.Its definately amongst the best outlets in calcutta for kebeb roti and certainly worth visits ,if you have a liking for frontier food.

Food quality needs to be improved at Zaranj. 

We have visited numerous times and my experience has been great. The last 2 times I visited the food quality did not seem up to the mark. The food was still good. It was just not the same as before. 

Dahi Ke Kabab was still top notch....!

Remember the time when you were kids and your parents would tell you that we are going out for dinner today and your eyes would wide with joy and by the time you are in the car, you are already fighting over the menu. Well this is one of the places that still makes me nostalgic every time I visit. The food never fails to please your culinary buds. And though the ambience remains the same over decades, it is neat and well maintained and classy. And their vegetarian dishes would surely give any non-veg kebab a run for their money, because even my non-veg friends dig into the veg kebabs here.

Some never to miss dishes here include-
Tomato shorba
Hara seekh kabab (dunno if healthier but surely tastier than their dahi kebab. And don't forget to get some extra bowl of their silken smooth whipped cream dip)
Tandoori aloo (Aah I love carbs)
Kaali daal is just heavenly so please do give it a shot
Mushroom dhaniya sabzi is divine
Lacha paratha- No one makes it like them. Crispy, textured and just melts in the mouth.
Veg Biryani is one of the best. Just full of flavour

By the time the meal is done, there is never really room for dessert so no comments on that. And yes even today we do fight about what we are going to order because some memories live on!

I had been visiting Zaranj more than 50 times in last several years and experience every time had been very satisfying. Their food quality - North Indian is just too delicious and I over feed myself every time I go there. I have various friends from India and abroad who love having food there. Pindi Chana, lachedaar paratha, paneer butter masala are my favourite dishes. Even their simple tandoori roti comes very crisp. All my friends who enjoy non veg dishes love chicken preparations. Their services are also very fast and they really take care. Only thing which i feel has room for improvement is their washroom. They have annual membership which does save us lot of money if you go there regularly. It's must visit for foodies who love North Indian cuisines.

An old time classic, though it can look forward for a change in ambience. At least the upholstery can add a little more vibrancy to the place. 
Food any day still maintains the taste and flavour from old times. You get the best dahi kabab here. That needs to be ordered. 
The soup had a little too much of salt, do the taste got spoiled. But paneer tikka and kali dal made up for ally the mistake. Super taste. Indian food is mind ogling. You can't miss even the roomali roti here. Though it is not available all days. 
Food calls for all the stars available for rating.

If there was one place in Cal I could eat as my last meal, I would close my eyes and walk till Zaranj. I have grown up eating here. Probably since I was a small kid, I have been here once every quarter atleast, so that makes it a huge number of visits, and the charm just grows.

 It's like wine, it just gets better with the competition.  In fact it's a standard for food, by which other restaurants are measured. Is the shorba like Zaranj's? Is the Paneer Tikka that possessive streak inducing? 

There can not be a better place for kebabs, and dal and the gravy stuff in the entire city, and it's at par with some of the best in the country, and believe me, I have been to a lot of them. But what tips it's scale is the lachcha parantha's. The flaky, the crispy, the drool-worthy, bread is a meal in itself, you can't stop at one. The bowlscomplimentary salad and papad just doesn't  stay empty, they refill it before you finish it! They know that the freebies can never curb the appetite of the patrons!!

I don't now how many times have the chef baked a special cake for me or my brother or a cousin, just to share our special occasions. It's actually a restaurant where the staff treats the guests as family, there is a smile, there are jokes, there is food and then there is pride.

This is a legend in legend. And I have never looked at the price column. Because this deserves every stinking bit of the burning hole in the pocket!

At a time when old places are disintegrating by service and taste, this place must be setting the benchmark.

And even the food, especially the breads, awesome stuff. Absolutely awesome!

A must visit place in Calcutta to get that fine dine experience for Indian food. It has the charm of the classic mid work day meal and a sorted dinner.
Tried few things off the menu

Kali Dal : phenomenal. Beautifully made and the best part is it's not too heavy on the stomach

Mushroom Sabzi : I am generally not fond of currys made with mushrooms but this is something else. It's so good

Dahi Ke Kebab : it's soft seek kebabs with a very lightly whipped curd.

Laccha Paratha : outstanding. Flaky and flavorful

Anyways to business.... The place is very decent I loved the ambience. It took them ages to gets us our drinks.. But then we were around 20 ppl i can give them that.... As for the drinks nothing special pretty basic stuff... Food was again something that can be called decent.... 
I loved the staff even when some of us were getting impatient they managed to keep their calm and served us well....
From ambience point of view very good from food decent and from drinks below average for all the three above I have had better.... Believe me... Still for ever calm and smiling serving staff they get the ranking.... 
Signing off for tonight....

We have been going to this restaurant since eons. with the five star standard pricing you would expect five star treatment as well. the last time we went there was 10 days ago. We order as usual. after some time we ordered a refill of the Salad and guess what we get; a COCKROACH complimentary. this is not all. i would have refrained from writing this had it not been for what followed next. the COCKROACH then flew onto my dads plate. He was only mid way through his dinner.. So the waiter brings a fresh plate. Ideally he should have out of courtesy refilled whatever was on his plate if not anything else, however, he had to be told to bring whatever my father was eating. so I had to tell him to bring the Malai Kofta and the Roti as thats what was on his plate when the ROACH flew on it. There was merely a sorry. There was no sign of remorse of apologies, then the waiter goes on to say "Sir it can happen in any place you go, its not our fault".... ummmmm it is your fault.... you obviously have roaches in your kitchen. We paid our bill and left never wanting to go back, not because of anything else but for the mere fact that they didnt even care.  my other friends were complaining of ROACHES on the walls etc but we still gave the benifit of the doubt.... I wish they would have taken care of the customers the way they should.... Anyways i dont wanna go back there for sure... If i am paying 5star rates i might as well go to a 5 star hotel ...

Chicken Tangri Kebab and Zaraanji Raan was just bad. 

Machhli Masala Kabab , Chicken Kadai was okay. 

Hyderabadi Biryani and Firni was good. 

Overall experience is not even 20% of what it used to be 3 years back.  

Will not recommend to anyone.

Slightly over-priced but doesnt make a difference the quality of the food is great tastes absolutely fresh quantity is kindoff sufficient enough for 3...The black dal is to die for,tandoori items are really nice...service is a little slow..staff is nice and friendly.

We went to Zaranj exactly a year back. My cousin who took me here was a regular here and hence we got reservation, otherwise its quite difficult to get reservation here on weekends. This place is a proper fine dining experience. Ancient style interiors. The staff was friendly to us because of my cousins popularity. We arrived early to take our table. The restaurant became packed soon. The food was very good. The best laccha parantha that we have ever had in our life. We rave about it to all. The one bad experience we had, my aunt pulled out a dead cockroach from the platter. What quality standards they maintain for such a fine place I don't know, but something like this is really unacceptable. I deduct two points for that, else it was a flawless 5.

The restaurant has small bridges everywhere with fountains n water flowing next to it..loved d experience. . service was also quick considering we were a group of 18 ..

 options in veg are enough.. loved d veg platter..navratan korma and dal makhani were cooked to perfection!!

The staff was extremely courteous, well-informed and efficient. 


Pricing is inclined towards the high but worth it!!
a 4.5 specifically due to the excellent staff service who kept us entertained thru out..

The place has its own loyal fan club and if you like the place on your first visit, you will be inclined for many more visits..

A very good restaurant in New Market Area. Perfect for family and business dinners. Great ambience and a fairly good location. The kebabs are great and you cannot stop eating them once you start. Other good starters include paneer tikka and tandoori aloo. The main is good but not as good as the starters. Roti or naam with kaali dal would be ideal. There is a variety in desserts too. Gulab jamum is a must if you are looking for hot desserts.

Well this is a fine dinning , one of the oldest and good willed restaurants of kolkata . Really high quality food , service is very good ( though sometimes it becomes irritating when the waiters continuously come and ask you for some new order or assistance ) , ambiance is good ( quite royally decorated well lit ; though I personally prefer a bit darker ones ) . They have two different sections , zaranj or indian and jong for oriental menus .  From indian menus peswari lamb kebab , machli masala kebab , zaranji raan ,  bharwan kulcha  along with rogan josh is a must . In oriental section go blindly for konji lamb and jasmine / sticky rice with thai red curry . The thai foods are really high quality and the fresh smells of kafir lime leafs , lemon grass and galangal are heavenly . These goes well with scotch or red wines . Almost all the food they offer and the way they serve it is just excellent . Its a true sense fine dinning . 
Costs 3500 to 4000 for two .

The food industry isn't like the conventional industry where mistakes are often forgiven or better,forgotten. 
Zaranj is a name so intricately woven in the history of the city of joy that it has become one of the pioneer restaurants of the city and a must visit for one and all
The quality of food is pristine and each item on the menu is better than the next. The staff is extremely courteous and one is treated like royalty.
The new menu is like a portal to a newer world and aptly called the world traveller menu. 
Words are not enough to explain zaranj,they don't sell food here,they offer you an experience, one that makes you always coming back for more.

Went to the restaurant with the whole family.  Along with the various dishes we ordered tandoori paneer tikka.



What we witnessed was something that leaves sour taste for long long time.



There was a cockroach in the dish fried along with the paneer tikka, when we raised the issue to the management, they took away the dish to show it to chef. Chef came along with the dish and said he doesnt know how this happened.



They did offer us a discount of 30% on the total billing, but the idea is not take discount from these restaurants. They simply get away and such things happen day in and day out.

It was a visit to the Indian Museum on a fine day after which we had decided to rendezvous with a couple of guests, at Zaranj.
This restaurant stands bang opposite the Indian Museum on a little alley that leads to New Market.
As the name suggests this restaurant refers to a place in Afghanistan, lately a part of the NWFP(North West Frontier Province).
The delicacies from this place form the most important part of the menu,at this restaurant.
Over here you find a range of kebabs which are vastly different from the ones served in the best of the local restaurants of Kolkata,like Arsalaan.
When I first went here I glances through the menu card and I was so much so confused that I literally questioned the waiter a 100 times before ordering the dish.
The ambience of this place is something that really hits the eye.It is spatial inside and the interior decorations are like those daring back to the Mughal era.There is soft music played at the background also.
I enjoyed the mutton kebabs and sipped in some Cola here.For the main course one can opt for the Rotisserie and chicken specialities.
The desserts section of this place requires to catch up a little more.
All in all Zaranj is the place to be on a Sunday afternoon with your family/friends and indulge in long discussions.
Even though there are other restaurants in the city which serve much better quality of NWFP cuisine at a more reasonable rate,I would go back to Zaranj for the Mutton Kebabs and the ambience.

Have been there number of times, but disappointed this time by its quality.
Zaranj has lost its charm by being over-priced as per its quality. Many other restaurants have better quality then this these days.
Management has to look seriously to get the same quality like before.

Whenever I wish to experience regal treatment I visit Zaranj. Best restaurant I've ever eaten at. The good, the staff is excellent. Have been going here since I was a child; the place is my dad's favourite. 
The Thai red curry, Chinese salad, paneer makhni, Laccha paratha and paneer tikka are my all time favourites. The tutti fruity ice cream and the almond drink are extremely tasty.
Highly recommended place. Do visit.

One of kolkata old joints which is serving north india food , which still taste good as it was in the beginning.

We ordered the veg plater which consist of the paneer tikka , baked aloo , dahi kebab ( which is awesome ) haryaali kebab green coloured dahi kebab served with salad and dahi . And for the main course dal makhani , mushrooms with lacha paratha .

One of the places to go for north indian kolkata on a budget , not very expensive on the pocket .

All over great meal .

Please don't ever go to this resturant. Food is worst. Starters are ok but main course is hopeless.
Hospitality is very poor. Staff and waiters are not of that standard they will serve you rotten stuff and when you will ask the manager to change it instead of changing that item he will argue with you and at last you have to pay for it. Quantity of the food is also very less and price is also very high . There are broken and torn sofas and chair.

Location: Near Indian Museum. 

Coming from the house of Amber, 
This place is one of my favorites in town. 
It has never disappointed me. 
Outstanding quality of food. 
Great ambiance. 

Being to the point, 
I have tried both cuisines it has to offer across the innumerable visits. 
And both were lip smackin'. 

Jong's Section- 
Chinese: 

Crispy Chilli Babycorn 
Absolute delicacy! 

Veg Hakka noodles 
Perfectly boiled noodles and tossed with juicy veggies. 
Great. 

Schezuan Fried Rice 
Spicy! 
Well cooked rice with the right amount of spice. 

Veg Manchurian 
The dumplings were tender and the sauce was flavorful. 


Zaranj Section- 
Indian: 

Paneer tikka 
Soft and succulent cubes of cottage cheese with the perfect spice mix. 
Great. 

Maa Ki Dal (Dal Makhani) 
Was great to taste. Perfectly cooked black lentils. 

Navratan Kofta 
The Kofta had a great filling to it. 
Complimented well with the flavorful gravy. 

Paneer Shabnam 
An absolute delicacy. 
Tossed with the right spice mix, spring onions, capsicum and tomato. 

Tandoori Roti 
Made to choice.
Happy. :-) 

Butter Naan 
Soft and buttery.  

The staff was extremely courteous, well-informed and efficient. 

Pricing is inclined towards the high. 

An excellent experience as far as food is considered. :-) 
No disappointments yet.

Overall a great experience, keeping in mind the money affairs. :-)

I have been to zarang a few times for dinner. The decor and ambience of the place reflects, to a large extent, modernity of the by gone years. I quite like the place for its atmosphere.
Talking about the food and the service offered at this place, I would say that the preparations have been quite consistent in taste over the visits I have had at this place. Being a vegetarian and a maru, my choice of preparations have been limited  to the staple dal, koftas and the paneer items. I found all of these tasteful. The service too, has been upto the mark.

The place has its own loyal fan club and if you like the place on your first visit, you will be inclined for many more visits.

Okay so I've been always hesitant about writing about this place but finally here I'm. 
My mom raved about this place and finally we went in there to celebrate my brother's gold medal. 
Upon entering the place I was transported into a different world. The interiors are amazing and nothing you'd find in any other restaurant. It has an old world charm to it with small bridges and fountains. Absolutely lovely. 
However, everything from here started going downhill. 
We ordered for veg kebab platter, jaljeera, veg gratin, naan, lacha paratha and mix veg (sabzi kadhaiwala I guess.)

The veg platter was strictly okay, minus the paneer which was marvelous. The other items however was average. 
The gratin was good too. 

However, the jaljeera was one of the worst I've ever had. It had more water and the boondiyas weren't really helping since they hadn't been dipped well. 
The mix veg and the breads were okayish- a little too sweet like the Bengali preparations which doesn't go well with us. 
We ended our mean with tooti frooti which acc to us was the best among everything. 

The service wasn't that great too. The waiters were pretty slow. 

I don't know why we had such a bitter experience given such wonderful reviews. However, one thing is for sure- I'm not coming back here anytime soon.

Best place for Indian vegetarian food.Lovely ambience and spot on service.Friendly staff. The potatoes kebab are to die for and my family favorite among with the lahsooni paratha. Good curries and spicey starters. A must visit for vegetarian foodies. Good Chinese food in Jong's as well. The mushroom and schezwan rice being the highlights of my meal along with the hearty manchow soup. My personal favourite.

Ok this is based on a distant memory. My uncle took our entire family to dine here and the ambiance was interesting from the start: Dark and calm. We ordered Indian food and the kebabs were at once very tasty. What was really interesting was a zaranj chutney to go with one of the chicken dishes we had ordered. However, since I am personally not fond of achars and chutneys I did not particularly enjoy it (was more of a murabba). I am certain that those with a tangy tongue will love this accompaniment to the main course. The overall quality of food was alright. I want to visit this place in the near future and I suggest you guys pay a visit as well.

It has been a while that I had visited Zaranj. This Sunday my parents wanted to dine-out given the cooled down weather in Kolkata, no matter what. I left the choice to my parents since I was dead tired and hungover from a hectic Saturday. My parents zeroed on Zaranj in unison, I nodded and complied. All I could think of was to watch the India vs West Indies match. On reaching Zaranj, we got a place immediately and I chose one near the waterfall. Just a childish wish so to say, I had to be near the prettiest looking part of the ambience and yet make sure I get my full view of the television. Happy to have gotten both, we brushed through the menu. 
My mother loves to start her meal with a warm soup, and therefore the chicken shorba was the undisputed choice. I decided to stick to a cool drink instead and egged on by the waiter serving us, I took the guava-strawberry flip. I sure flipped with one sip of the crazy, thick fresh fruit shake it was. To an extent the super thick shake did kill my appetite but I had no problems with that when India kept bringing on the fours and sixes. :D 
For appetisers we ordered peshawari burrah and machli masala kebab. My parents took butter nun by the side with the appetisers. The starters arrived within fifteen-twenty minutes. The fish kebab pieces were huge, perfectly marinated in spices but not overtly spicy. It tasted really good with the condiments served. Amongst the condiments, my favourite was the sweet mango pickle. It tasted so nice that I kept licking pieces of it with the kebabs. Probably sounds like a crazy combination but I am still salivating at the thought of it. The peshawari lamb kebab was as soft and juicy as it could be. I in fact liked that it was a little spicy compared to the fish one which helped maintain the balance on the taste buds with the pickled onion. But it would be a strictly no-no order for kids. 
Already full with the big pieces of juicy kebabs, we decided to give the main course a miss and move straight to desserts instead. My parents ordered a tutti-frutti each and me a rabri pista. My parents enjoyed their tutti-frutti well but I did not bother to taste it given the nice bowl full of cold rabri with sprinkled pista all over. I gobbled, literally gobbled for split few minutes to have realised thereafter that one over had already been played and India was a wicket down. Ah well, but we would still win and a 'sweet' one it would be. 
Satiated, my father and I decided to finish watching the match and then head our way back home. The joys of not having to pay yet be happy awe-wholesomely! ^_^

Some cities are also remembered for their restaurants, Calcutta being no exception! There was a time when people flocked to places like MAPLE, VINEET, ZARANJ. Some of the best and classiest restaurants this city had to offer. The former two shut down unfortunately. Thankfully, Zaranj is still there. 
I dont think  this restaurant needs a review. The food is simply gorgeous! Its been the same for more than 2 decades! 
Their tomato shorba is fanatastic...right consistency, flavour and no colour added to it. Their starters are to die for: Tandoori aloo,hariyaali kebab ( melts in your mouth), dahi ke kebab. Their whipped cream served with it makes you drool for more.

In main course their lacha parantha and mirchi parantha ( no one makes it like they do, Deep fried but what the heck!) alongwith black dal, Khumbh taka tak( mushrooms) is sinful. their paneer makhani and kofta is pretty good too.

Desserts is an area where they lack. If you have this inexplicable craving for eating good north indian food and really want to satiate it- this is the place; never disappoints ( unless its over crowded of course)

The last time I visited this place was 2 years back but the memory lingers on… For the excellent food, service and ambience!!
To be frank I had always sat on the Jong’s side and tried their oriental fare along with the heavenly Zaranji Rann and have been delighted with it!
This time was going to be a rude shock. First the good things:
1.	Willing to take a reservation on a Sunday evening
2.	Valet parking
3.	Took the advance order of the Rann as it usually takes about 30 minutes to serve
4.	The service
So, as soon as we entered we were taken to be seated and this was the first time I was sitting on the Zaranj side. The ambience I felt was better on the other side, however no complaints. We were hungry and witching 10 minutes they served us the Rann… And what a bitter disappointment!! It was completely burnt with the meat gone dry and a taste of coal / sand, I don’t know what!! After all that I had spoken about the dish to my family they were surprised at the taste and of course the price of it. We mentioned it to the order taker but there was no action taken on it, which was quite sad.
For the main course we ordered murgh methi malai & kadhai chicken, both of which were excellent. The roomali rotis were also extremely well made. We loved the salad, chutney and papad served as accompaniments.
So here’s my verdict, for the overall steep price, the Rann was a big disappointment, so I am not going back there soon…
It should have been 4 to 4.5 stars except for the Rann and the price :(

I have been to the chinese section, Jongs many times but never ended up trying the Indian section. I finally got to go when family members insisted on Indian food and am i glad. The ambience of this place is amazing. 

For starters we ordered Paneer Tikka. They were flavourful juicy n soft. Some of the best I have had till now. For our main course we ordered maa ki daal, paneer makhani and pindi cholle. The paneer makhani was the best version i have tasted in any restaurant. I personally never like pindi cholle as i find them chalk full of spices which in turn takes away the flavour of te cholle itself completely. But zaranj managed to impress me a lot with their pindi cholle. They were amazing and a must try even for non-vegetarians. The breads were also very well made, crisp on the outside and soft inside. 

The only place i would cut points is on the prices. They are steep. It will cost you close to a 1000 bucks per person without alcohol. But once in a while it is completely worth it. So next time you are in the mood to splurge please visit this place.

Zaranj has maintained the standard of being one of the best standalone Moghlai restaurants in Kolkata. Went there last week and the food was expectedly satisfying.

The zaranji raan is a must-have here. It's tender and succulent goat meat marinated well giving it a unique texture. It takes half an hour to order, but it's well worth the wait. Make sure to ask the chef to cook it a bit soft since authentic raan might be a bit too dry for most people. The Tengri kebab is really good. Just one thing, try to avoid the white gravy chicken items.

Wonderful decor and exemplary service.

Great experience every time, keep up the good work !

I loved the hyderabadi gosht biriyani here. That is what we went for anyway. There are very  few places (no matter how hyped) that actually has good food. This is one place where I loved the food, the service as well as the decor. I am surprised that more people don't recommend this place, I am sick of hearing the usual 4-5 names everyone loves touting these days, they are mostly disappointments. The gosht rogan josh was beautifully infused with spices, really loved the lachcha paratha as well. The jugalbandi seekh kabab was a bit dry for me, the chicken part was really nice though. I am not a fan of malai kulfi, but I shared it with my friend and it wasn't bad. I had an old fashion as well (not really sure why), it was okay. I love their biriyani and I am going back for it again.

Been going here for decades and never the food has been disappointing. 

This time it was no different.

What we ordered(Veg) -

Kebab Platter
Dahi ke Kebab
Paneer Makhni
Dal Makhni
Mix Veg Subzi
Kabuli Naan
Mirchi Ka Paratha
Gulab Jamun


Everything was lip smacking delicious. Mirchi Ka paraya made of red mirchi powder was interesting though smoking hot for my taste buds.

Gulab Jamun though I ordered with no expectations were wonderful! 

Some one else paid the tab so can't recall the bill. But should be around 700-800 INR per head!

The decor and the traditional setup of this place is what attracts a lot of people. The food is absolutely great! Definitely one of the best places to eat Mughlai food. You'll be served in Silver dishes and let me tell you, for a moment you'll feel like the king of the world! Try the kebabs here, they are really grand. And yeah, a ecstatic bar is also attached as you enter the restaurant. So, you have it all :)

The only catch is, this place is very expensive. But, it's worth it. Trust me, it is.

There are always a few places that have not just been restaurants, but milestones in the history of food in kolkata . Zaaranj  was the first outlet in kolkata which actually brought finesse to Indian food. They redefined how Kolkata saw its Indian food . 
This came as a welcome change to an average chicken bharta and rezala and gave interesting stuff like Dahi ke kebab , and for the first time mixed chicken and mutton together in the gulbadi kebab. 

I think i was in school when this place had opened and we as kids would eat kebabs with tomato ketchup . This was the first place that said they wont serve ketchup and served chutneys only . Yes ! my love for chutney started at Zaranj. This restaurant motivated me to become a chef some day and made me fall in love with Hospitality industry in general. 

The food was fine then and is finer now. Cant pick any particular dish in general but i have always loved their light as cloud dahi kebab and the fish dishes have always been nice. And what stands to be my favorite is the Methi Chicken. 

The ambiance was always beautiful . Serene whites and browns with high ceiling and little bridges connecting one section of the restaurant to another. very very forward for its time . 

Zaranj is from a family that has provided brilliant food to kolkata for generations and is still giving it . It comes from the house of Amber and they have been industry stalwarts, 

Thank you Zaranj, for giving not just good food, but also aspirations... 

Cheers !

This place serves quality food , which is equally  tasty in once taste bud. Though the prices are little bit on the higher side , by far this should not be a miss. The ambience is also good. This is one of my favorite north Indian restaurant in the city.
The try outs are:
The nans, dal makhni, murg bharta, bhuna ghost zaranj,zaranji raan,ghost reshmi chaap,the tanddori plater (non-veg).Well try the tuti fruiti ice cream too!

I have been going here since I was 5, absolutely LOVE the food. Its one of the best Indian food I have had in the city. The laccha paratha is a something you must have. So is the dahi ke kebab with the mint chutney. Its extremely consistent with quality and taste (amazing every time!). 

The ambiance is decent, has comfortable seating, has been the same for a very long time. The staff is very helpful. It is on the pricier side, but totally worth the food and experience.

Overall a great place if you want to have quality Indian food. A must visit for everyone visiting Calcutta.

The best North Indian food on offer in Calcutta for a decade and a half. I love the Paneer Tikka and Black Dal here. The price is a bit steep but it is fair as the food is extremely tasty. 

The decor needs refurbishing but that doesn't take away from the food or the experience. 5 star and a must visit restaurant when in Calcutta.

Zaranj is one of the oldest and dearest place when it comes to traditional royal Indian cuisine. The decor is grand with small fountains and bridges all around the restaurant. It is one place even the kids enjoy . You feel amazing even before ordering the food no matter how many times you may visit the place. The staff are warm and the service is fast.

One of the best kebabs in the city, my favorite being the seekh kebab with the amazing sour dip . paneer tikka served on the sizzler plates are crazy!! The main course preparations are amazing. The dal and malai koftas give you a finger licking experience to say the least. 

Pros:
1) Amazing decor
2) Amazing kebabs
3) Everything amazing about the place

Best North Indian food in Kolkata. Great ambiance. Good service. It is pricey but worth it. I have been here countless number of times and loved the food each time. 
There was this one particular time when we didn't like the Kali Dal so they asked us to give feedback along with our address. Surprisingly, the next day we received our ordered quantity of Dal delivered to our home. Never seen such response to a small feedback. 
Finally, I would say that it is one of the few places in Kolkata which over the years have been consistent with their quality.

'Zaranj' has everything that makes you feel 'ROYAL'

Be it the ambience, the food or the service, it is top notch in all the departments.

This was my 'N'th visit and like always i was spell bound by the quality of food they have on offer. The moment you have the first morsel of that overnight cooked Maa ki Daal with the succulent laccha paratha with Paneer makhani you feel transposed to some cosseted place in Afganistan. The food is made with love and I feel that love each time when I eat there.

Their service is top notch, they know their business of hospitality so very well.

The area is huge, with the open tandoor, water streaming, gigantic mirrors and the bridges around you feel as if time has stopped and you feel gratified sitting in one corner of the table, taking your own sweet laid back time enjoying and savoring your food.

I am a self proclaimed gourmand and Zaranj for me gives me complete sense of 'Gastronomic Nirvana' (a word which i use only for my favorite restaraunts serving exceptional food) each time i go there.

Fine rich royal dinning redefined ! A complete family dinning Heaven :)

Being a part of Kolkata for 21 years never visited this place but finally went to the place last week.... Went out on sunday evening for dinner.. First thing important please reserve a table as the place gets occupied quickly..  Being a vegetarian, you have options to order..

The ambiance of the place really blowed us.. Bridges, water streams very well designed and makes the visit memorable...  

The staff is very courteous and well knowleged about the menu.. They suggest you in case you are in confused about the food.. Serivce was quick 

Food was good... We ordered Paneer tikka as starter.. The presentation was unsual and taste was very good..  (One do gets papad and salads as complimentary)

Overall its a fine rich dining experience where you feel you being treated royally... A must place to go from my side...

Zaranj is one of those few restaurants that define the city of Kolkata. With its exceptionally rich and sophisticated ambience and its unchallenged presence in the New Market area, the restaurant boasts of excellent food, service and memories! It is not for the budget eater, given the price per item on the menu. It is for a connoisseur who is willing to spend the amount the food here deserves. The vegetarian food is par excellence, especially the Indian cuisine. The other cuisines are equally amazing. The staff is well mannered and courteous. Overall, it is a fantastic family fine dining experience!!!

The restaurant is a pure example of fine dining. The ambience and interiors are one of the best in Kolkata. The water bridges , streams etc makes your visit memorable. The food is good though overpriced. It is justified by the legacy of this old restaurant. One should only visit their in special occasions.

Zaranj is the place that you go for good food, service and fairly priced alcohol. The Kali dal is a must try, pineapple blossom is a great non-alcoholic beverage.

I visit this place quite often since my dad loves this place. The thing that compliment's the restaurant are the small bridges, water flowing and the viewable tandoor.

I always make sure that a prior reservation is made to avoid delay in services.

If fine dining, refined taste in ambiance and a royal treatment is how you would want to spend an evening or afternoon this place is definitely a place to be.  Their Kebabs are truly nawabi. Their Biriyani is the perfect blend of fluffy rice , perfectly cooked meat which melts in the mouth and assorted spices which arouse the senses and demands you put forkful of it in your mouth. Their Kulfi is rich, creamy and the perfect end to haute cuisine. Recommended for special occassions.

Starting from the ambience, it was a nice experience. The food was very tasty, we tried different dishes in prawn, mutton, chicken and Maa ki dal and all of them was extremly good. The complentary salads and papads were extremly enjoyable. My favorite dessert is the vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce. Best in Kolkata.
As already said,because of the extremly high prices the restaurant can only be visited on special occations.
The biggest negative point is the dirty washroom. For me an abosulty no go in a resaturant like this.

Went to this restaurant for the first time, this is one of the oldest and costliest restaurents of kolkata.. Ambience is absolutely gorgeous, fountains ,streams, semi open glass kitchen , big mirrors all add to the beauty of this restaurant..Waiters are extremely polite and well informed and they will guide you to choose food items according to your likings..we ordered machli masala kabab-this is the best bhetki kabab i have ever had, kabuli naan-very good in taste and size, kadai murg-a spicy chicken delicacy, bhuna mutton-a dry tawa fried mutton item, i have this item 1st time in my life and liked it.. complementary papad, salad and pickles were served along with food. Service was quick and prompt-contrary to the belief that zaranj has very slow and steady service!! only negative point is that every food item is very very costly-fish prawn items are above rs 650/-, chicken mutton items are above 500 & 550/- per plate and avg cost per head will be rs 1000/-  but if someone wants sumptuous meal then per head cost will be above 1500/-..  this kind of restaurants should be visited only on very special occasions...

Agreeably this place upholds a heritage. But something terrible has gone wrong with this place. We visited Zaranj last night. Had it not been for the affable and courteous staff the entire evening would have been a disaster. We ordered food from Jong's while sitting at Zaranj. Cantonese Chowmein was worse than what's available on the street side, Golden Fried Prawns was shrunk up and dry, prawns in Fried Rice was soggy, Chilly Potato with fried Vermicelli was made with near mashed potatos and no sign of vermicelli :) Lets not talk about the rest ....
Indian menu - visitors beware - prices have been jacked up so high, I wonder whether its the same place we walked into. Quality of Jongs kitchen if is any indicaton then we wonder how dreadful Indian cuisine would taste like.
****** WORST FEELING ******* Prices being jacked up still can be accepted provided ambience and decor is furbished. To make things worse there was not a bit of concern not care when we expressed our discontent with the food quality; nonchalance.
WON'T GO BACK and CERTAINLY WON'T REMOMMEND
After so many years of being there at Zaranj, its time to say adieu :(

These people have really maintained the quality of their food.... Great ambiance and an excellent location ... its the perfect place to take guests or celebrate a family occasion .... service is great as well. While almost all their dishes are good a special mention must be made of their Peshawari Barrah Kabab and the Zaranji Raan (both Mutton dishes). Usually I prefer not to eat mutton in restaurants because of the quality but at Zaranj it is excellent.

Zaranj.. Have been visiting this place since childhood and have many fond memories of it.. The number of items on the menu are very limited, especially for the Vegetarians (I, being one) .. Although there are some favorites like the Dahi Kebab and Dal Makhani with its scrumptious indian breads and few in the Thai section of Jongs, It has lately become very very expensive. The service too is very slow.
Two stars from me.

Zaranj, is was and will always remain one of my favourite restaurants not only in Calcutta but anywhere in the world. The food, the service, the ambience , the opulence of the place is just brilliant and I will always love the place as much as  I did as a kid. I don't get around to going there very often now as I'm mostly out of cal, but whenever I'm here, I make it a point to go at least once.

It's a heritage restaurant with an awesome ambiance. The dimly lit environment and the furnishing will surely impress you. The food is very good and the mock tails are nice as well. Servicing is okay and you will have a lot of privacy. You can order and have you courses of meal at your own time. A bit heavy on your pocket. An ideal place if you are asking your partner out. You can make prior reservations for Birthday/Anniversary celebrations. Overall, a very satisfactory experience.

Excellent. Love the Dahi ke Kebab, Lachha Parantha and Kali Dal. We are so frequent visitors, we don't need to order, the stewards just brings our staple order. Pricing is on the higher side but you can buy their Discount Card which is valid for 1 year, and it proces to be a Good Bargain if you want to frequently visit. I have attended atealst 1 Big Party/ Get Together every 2 months for the last few years. Excellent ambiance and Staff Service. Keep it Mr. Arup - Manager.

Our first marriage anniversary (18th April, 2012) got an extra dimension because of splendid dinner at Zaranj. We reached there by 7:00 PM. As they don't allow entering in dinning hall before 7:30 PM we were staying at waiting Lounge till that. Here (Waiting Lounge) you will be served Hard/ Soft drinks on demand. The decor was amazing with fountains, waterfalls and artificial streams flowing across the restaurant.

We took couple of drinks with Amritsari Machli Kebab as starter. We could not order their specialty Zaranji Raan (must have for non-vegetarians but it is huge and only recommended if you are in a group). In main course we ordered Butter Nan, Mutton Surkh Korma and Hyderabadi Gosht Biryani. The food was exceptionally good and would easily steal your mouth buds.  The staffs were cooperative and took extra attention to suggest right menu.
 
Salad platter they offered complementary and they won't charge for Cold Drinks/ Soda with Hard Drinks as well. Cutlery was made of Silver. Also it has Valet Parking.  But good thing comes in Price. It might be anything around Rs. 1000 per head (without alcohol) for average foodie. This is one of the most expensive restaurant in Kolkata and easily the BEST.

First the positive points - The ambiance is excellent. One have a lot of privacy during dinner. Have a laid back sort of charm. The kebbabs are very good. Overall food quality pleasing. Food is served in good quality plates. 

Now - why do it cost so much? The quality is not so different from other resturants. The serving too is not so much that you can call it a value. 

Overall experience is that I will again visit the place when any of my friends sponsor.... Won't like to pay so much off my own pocket.

The food is good, the service great, but let's face it - how far can you go with North West frontier cuisine? We are now so familiar with the Murgh Makhanis and the Seekh Kebabs, that if you are not willing to go beyond, to push the "frontier" and do something special, it will fail to excite.
Overall, a nice place for visiting once. Repeat visit - I will think again!

At one point of time, Zaranj served excellent North-West Frontier food: the raan and kebabs prepared by them were unbeatable. But times change, and with it change ideas, menu and chefs. One is left with no option but to cherish old memories.Zaranji Raan, Machhli Masala Kebab, Peshawari Burrah Kebab, Kandahari Jhinga, Machhli Chaman, Mutton Rogan Josh, Murgh Makhni, Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani, Dahi ke Kebab, Paneer Tikka, Malai Kofta, Bharwan Aloo and Vegetable Kashmiri Biryani are dishes that you could try from the elaborate menu. price seems to be the only factor that mar the rating of this restaurant.

Quest in search of good food is always a daunting task. Being a foodie myself and having all these years slurped on new venues as well as tried and tested ones, Zaranj was tried by me and my wife some years back. Since then, whenever we are unable to zero in on a mutual choice of venue, Zaranj is the answer to the problem.

On our order list, 2 items arfe always a "must order:.....their Nawabi Tikka and Bharwan Aloo Tikka. While the former is a treat with the meat being succulent and ready to melt in the mouth, the latter is served on a sizzler plate and is "just enjoyable" Do not forget to ask for the "sour cream" if the waiter forgets. Having the Aloo tikka with a dash of cream is just eternal.

Dining at Zaranj has always been a great experience. Though priced on the higher side, but the taste, quality and service balances the price factor.

Just a small request to the administration of Zaranj. Please ensure that the brass plates are warm.....food becomes cold very fast.

try this place and the experience will be worthwhile

As a foodie,i love to try out food in different places. This was the way i reached Zaranj,for dinner,all alone. for a single person. It can be a bit boring eating out alone, but it was the service and the ambience and also the quality of the food that did not let me get bored. For the food,its awesome.  And same goes for the service. It is a little pricey as compared to other restaurants in Kolkata,but the service balances it. If anyone wants a beautiful dinner with there loved one's, or a birthday treat,i would suggest Zaranj.
