Went yesterday for lunch...next to Dawat Restaurant on Marquis street. It's a corner building so takes a bit of patience to locate. Pros...extremely affordable prices...most main course items are below Rs.100...Authentic Bangladeshi cuisine that you would pay much more at more established names for. Loved Kochubata Chingri and Fried Pomfret with Dal Bharta. Came out paying less than 350 for 2 of us. I wish they would make the place brighter though.

Two points for starters - this review is for the CityCentre,SaltLake branch. And- this was my Very 1st BangaliBuffet- that too while IN kolkata itself ...and Amazing it was! Review comes in late- went there on Dashami- so being a Pujo special menu and themed - the place was done up beautifully in Durga faces and flowers and the authentic dhaak beats in the background - increased the Oomph of the place by hundreds! Slowly the place filled up too... Getting to food - excellent servers and really polite and updone (kurtis & all) .. Murghi bhaja (fry) and Gobhi pakoras , bhetki fries and the Best Posto bora (sesame seeds pakora rather) - with the side dish of authentic mustard (kashondi) (who does ketchup There?!)- Tasted Yum! You don't wanna waste too much of your appetite there - as tempting the bhaajas are... Pick up your plates and be ready for an enthralling journey through Kolkata - ESP if ur a NonBengali - starting with the plain rice (even that was sieved and cooked to HomeStyle) or the Pulao - which Must be enjoyed once with the local ghee,table salt and green chilly( my Fav home meal),the Dals, shukto, and mix veg and a methi Gobhi (delicious but tasted pretty Northern only) - Veg down and cleared- then pick up Non veg- the shrimp curried up with mustard and Alum / arbi - a local fish-authentically done up to become the Favourite I'd say! The chicken curry (HOME!) with hot hot luchi...I skipped the mutton curry (but that was Delicious too; the Star - Ilish Maach (hilsa fish) - if you be a true Banagali - you'd get when I'm saying - unlimited mustard cooked Fresh Hilsa -in a Buffet?!! WOW - true happiness! Dessert- Mishti doi and rajBhog- nice and sweet and the tomato chutney - was a little disappointing though - overall being a "Bong" place not so much for the sweet palate I'd say ...ohh Well I'm not such a dessert fan.. But heard that the paayesh (kheer) was not so good .. Each of my aunts and mom itself were the Best critics on aboard for the day! But Overall - lovely place, delicious food and definitely a Must visit - ESP during the Puja time to experience the vibes of Kolkata :)

Need your menu card for salt lake outlet. I guess your Taltala outlets is the owner of the Salt Lake City center outlet. Salt lake needed a Bengali outlet
