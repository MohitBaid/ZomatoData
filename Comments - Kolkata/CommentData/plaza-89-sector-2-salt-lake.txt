Nothing more to say. After reading the reviews I took the risk of eating here. The place may not look so attractive but offers good Chinese food. I ordered myself a plate of Singapuri Noodles and Crispy Chilli Babycorn. It cost me 145/- but the quantity which I got was enough for one single guy to eat for two times a day. The prices are low and the quantity is good. The food tastes medium.

Alas 'Plaza 89'...I am writing this review as if you don't exist...a mere '0' would be more for u...now what triggered negative about this place in my mind...Ummmm...let me think....EACH AND EVERY THING...really really poor food...served me stale fried rice twice with chicken gravy dishes as well...and when informed they dont even have the courtesy to apologis...never ever stop to have anything...and please dont recommend to anyone...not even your enemies. Plaza 89 please look into it if you wanna survive.

ordered from here thrice. they started off well, now they have drifted. 
neither quality nor quantity could they maintain. cost for two says 700, they should make it 1400 because you need to order double of everything to fill up. 
quality too deteriorated over time, spices go haywire, etc. 

nevertheless, hope they get better.
