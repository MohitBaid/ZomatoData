Why spend double the money (actually even more) on KFC when you get the exact same taste at half the price? This small takeaway place located very close to my place is a gem. Highly recommended!

YFC is really pocket friendly and great in taste. Today I've tried Fried Wings, its crispy, juicy n soft. I tried almost all their food items listed in menu card previously, all are fresh n real yumm.. in taste. Great quality with good quantity. I must say YFC is far better than costly KFC. Nice location. I love to visit again.

If you love chicken, please visit this little gem. Their chicken receipies are just too good. Cheap and best. You will lick your fingers. I ate almost all items of their menu card and I visit this place frequently. Truly speaking , this resteurent will give 10 goals to it's foreign competitors.
