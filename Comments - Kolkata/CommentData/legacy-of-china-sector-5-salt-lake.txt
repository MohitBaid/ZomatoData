Ordered fried rice with chicken Manchurian. Delivered before promised time. Fried rice was oily and rice undercooked. Manchurian was so so. Chicken pieces were cooked. Taste can improve vastly. Delivery awesome. 5 stars for delivery and the food brings it down to 2.5 stars.

This is the first time I home delivered food from Legacy of China. I ordered for One egg chicken roll and Egg Korean Rice. The food was well packed and arrived within scheduled time. The Egg Korean rice is green in colour and is mildly spicy. Whereas the egg chicken roll was well cooked and was not tight as I find most rolls to be. Everything cost all total Rs.205. This was a good experience.

Food's not bad, price is somewhat reasonable, generous quantity; but fuckall delivery time. It should not take more than 2 hours to deliver simple orders within a 2.5 km radius. They also refuse to deliver quite too often. If you can ignore that, then it's a decent place to order from if you have a relatively lower budget.

In my opinion, it's not worth the wait though. Order only in case of extreme financial crisis.

Surprisingly ¬†despite being ¬†a chinese outlet they make awesome rolls... which comes close to the Jabbr Afghani Rolls.... i ordered their Chicken cheese (egg) roll and it was awesome.... the chilli chicken melted in the mouth.... while the noodles were out of the world... those who prefer road side noodles they must surely try....

It remains open almost for the entire night. We ordered their noodles and rice, chilli chicken combo with 100 rupees each. The only good part about the food was it's quantity only. I agree with the price being reasonable but the quality is bad(only for their combos) the food was very oily. But they hardly had any options for combos though their soup and chicken wrap is good. Being the delivery very prompt. This review is based on cumulative orders on a whole. Thus if you are hungry just call and opt for anything apart from their french fries and combo. And you are good to go for the rest of the night.

This food joint is situated near Pantaloons,Sector 5. It's one of my basic choice if I want to have quick bites. Love their Chicken Cheese Roll & Combos. Prices are appropriate & the main thing is it stay open till 6 Am, so if you have the USA shift timing it would help you to sort out your belly needs! The negative perspective is Delivery! If you are going to have delivery by a call..God knows how much time they would take.You can die in starvation but the food won't come. So it's better to order via Swiggy.

If you really want to know how bad customer can be treated, you should really visit this place. If you are still thinking about give it a try, make sure you ordering a large number of dishes because if you are ordering lets say for two or three people. You order might just lost. Also, remember there is no refund if you cancel the order after waiting for 1 hour at 11 in night.

23rd July 2016, Saturday evening. Even you'll agree that it was a less crowed Salt Lake Sector V than Monday to Friday. It was Perfectly crowed I'd say. This was my 1st ever step in to #InfinityThinkTank building - I always wanted to enter this building.¬†
Anyways as suggested ordered Double Egg Roll and Veg roll. Yes they did take time to place our order BUT I APPRECIATE it. They were not at least in a hurry to deliver! In hurry the FOOD QUALITY does go down.
In Rs. 32 only the double egg roll was huge. Veg roll was also good. It was a windy evening. LOVED THE AMBIENCE. Much better than the #Ecospace New Town ka samne wala ambience!!!¬†
It was cheap. Else amar mote Salt Lake toh hi-fi borolok der jayga. Will try other items from here too next time. Will of course again come here. You have some seats nearby where you can actually seat and give a #LovelyAdda¬†
Later on that day (today) gave a lovely adda at Salt Lake. A wonderful day spent with quite a bit of Travelling. ¬†
Thanks to someone for taking me to a new shop and #InfinityThinkTank :)
            
Happy Saturday. These will be memories. Dhonnyobaad.

Situated in infinity think tank building courtyard,sector 5 , this is a small outlet like many other of its kind. Their service is very poor, I mean who takes 20 mins to make one chicken cheese sandwich when there were no prior orders. The sandwich tasted good but chicken pieces were dangerously meager. Not satisfied.

A 24 hours outlet in saltlake sector v area .Kolkata has two outlets of Legacy of china presently and this one is quite well known among office goers.

**Location**
At sector v saltlake near Infinity building.

**Experience**
Though the name suggested that it is a Chinese cuisine specialist but Biriyani to sandwich and pastas are also available. I had tried their pasta, Biriyani and noodles here. Best part is that the service is super quick. Also they deliver to your office as well. Food is a bit oily which is expected but quite tasty.

Was roaming around looking for lunch and luckily discovered this outlet in the Infinity Benchmark building - along with several other outlets in the same vicinity. The outlet is small and lacks in hygiene which calls for immediate attention from the management. A few seating arrangements have been made where customers of all the nearby outlets also have a seat. I struggled to find a seat and managed 1 after sometime.

I ordered a Veg Biryani which was served in just 10-12 minutes in a thermocol plate. It was a beauty, decorated with finely sliced vegetables, curry leaves and topped with some slices of raw onions. It had a very balanced content of paneer, elaichi, peas, corriander, carrots, onions, pod etc and overall, I was quite satisfied with the taste. But, I believe that complimentary raita should have been served ‚Äì as is the standard industry practice of serving biryani. 

Service is fine and pocket pinch is not high!
 Cheers!

This is an outlet for home delivery if you like street style spicy chinese food.Ordered an LoC special noodles and hunan chicken from here.The quantity was enough for two.The noodles had ample amount of chicken and mushroom and was more like chilly garlic noodles.The hunan chicken is not the authentic light base one.It has a sweet and sour taste not spicy.The chicken pieces were nice and moist.
Don't expect some authentic chinese food when you are ordering,but the food is tasty and yummy(oily too) to suffice your hunger.

If your office in Rajarhat or in sector v , and want to have something other than bread toast or maggi in late night then this place cab be a savior.

PROS:1. Open in the late hours of the night.2. Locations (the one in Salt Lake) is very convenient - ground floor, infinity tower.3. Prices are very reasonable.

CONS:2. Food. What we ordered was horrible. (Though, we are partly to blame for ordering Biriyani at a so-called Chinese restaurant. What we got would best be described as fried Biriyani, which was prepared literally by frying on a wok. The aloo was just plain boiled and added separately along with the chicken which seemed like it was soaked in Meetha Ator. They also added diced tomatoes and coriander, which was just wrong!)
3. Service. It would be fair to mention that they were not rude, but the concept of service with a smile is unknown to them it seemed.

VERDICT: Do not plan on visiting the place again for north indian food. Might try the Chinese there in the future, solely because it's open late at night.

Its the third time we dined here. It situated in the Infinity Towers Complex and serves conventional indo-chinese cuisines. The seating lies in an open space. The only problem in my opinion is that the place is not quite clean and hygienic as one would expect. The food is pretty good. The chowmein is really good and they serve combo meals with Chilly Chicken or Schezwan Chicken as side dish. The quantity is sufficiently filling for lunch. Overall its quite a place where you would like a bite if you are bored of your usual lunch schedule.

Your ultimate quest for midnight hunger ends here. Working in night shifts that is a common symptom. And this place offers you a wide range of choices and serves you generous portion of decently cooked meal. The food is greasy oily and yummy üòã no chance of a healthy diet. I love their chicken pasta, sandwich and paneer and kulcha. Only drawback delivery takes a long time. But still one of the best midnight hangouts.

Stop committing customers if you cannot live upto it!!

This place is right where I work. I have seen this place change names and owners . The place is located in the correct area in regards to the timing, 24x7 industry with a 24x7 food joint. The food is average but the prices do not justified, maybe its go to do with the availability and accessibility. Food delivery is done promptly so that's a plus.

Apart from the fact that here you will get to eat something round the clock, nothing else about this place excites me. It is a small take-away joint. You have got few common chairs and tables in front of the stall though which are shared with other food stalls at this place. The food has got somewhat average presentation and taste. We had tried Egg Hakka Noodles, Chicken Gravy Noodles and Chicken soup from this joint. As their menu itself claims, this is not a speciality food joint, they serve so many food items, starting from Sandwich to Biriyani to Chhole Bature to Chinese and I guess Pasta as well, maybe to get a huge spectrum of clientele. I personally go for specialized food joints, so didn't feel the urge to visit this place until one friend of mine decided to try this place out with me. The Hakka chow was Kolkata-style and tad too oily for me, the soup was okay and forgettable, the gravy noodles tasted nice but it was just the hakka noodles with gravy in it. The vegetables were not even diced (in big pieces and diagonally) for Cantonese noodles, anyway what we really liked about this place was the quantity of the food served. Reasonable price, good quantity, good variety and average taste - that's one line to sum this up.

Cheers!

This small shack located in the infinity building stands out for being open 24hours a day! They serve decent food and i have picked up food from here late in the night(read 2am ) they serve chinese and breakfast items along with regular snacks.The food is priced very apt considering the crowd of office goers or people coming in for a quick bite. I have tasted the manchurian here along with hakka noodles and it was good.The sandwiches are okay and i have usually seen people take pakodas too .

The owner a 40 something man is very friendly.This place functions 24hours a day because the owner along with the cook sleep in a small room inside the shack, so whenever youre hungry just knock they open up and take your order! 

I say bouquets to the 24hour concept( apart from fancy hotels or the dhabas serving north indian,nobody is open this late ).

GUILTY of going to this place at 2 o'clock in the night for some much-needed grub with friends, and ending up spending a lot of time just chatting with them in the relaxed seating, watching people go by. Two things I adore - they make oily, greasy roadside chowmien, which is probably one of the greatest guilty pleasures for me... and serve it with chilli and tomato sauce on the side. My last visit was with my friend A who wanted to go for a late meal, and we ended up ordering chow mien, chilli chicken and a chicken roll. The roll was a very "Bangali" one, well-prepared, and following exactly the instructions given - no sauce, extra chillies and lime. The chow mien was a generous portion and slightly difficult for a single person to finish, and A struggled with it in the end, till I magnanimously joined in. The gravy chilli chicken was the weak link - it was average and forgettable. However, what I liked was the relaxed ambiance and the nice and friendly behavior of the server, and the smile on his face even at 2.30 in the night.
