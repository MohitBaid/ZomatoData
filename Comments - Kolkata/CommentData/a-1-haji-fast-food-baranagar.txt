If extra calories dont make you feel bad, then this is a perfect place for quick bites. The biriyani, rolls, are really good. The tikka is my favourite. Nice place for take away food.

Biryani is must for me atleast once in a week and I keep trying Biryani at various places. Recently I was at Baranagar to visit one of my friend. For lunch we brought Chicken Biryani from A1 Haji. The Biryani was really very good. The rice was so fine and light. Also the chicken piece was big enough. The quality was sufficient for an adult.
My friend brought it from there, so can't tell you about the ambiance of the shop. But this is mostly delivery outlet.

Good enough for a road side eatery to offer if you don't cry for calories. I have eaten Biryani and Rolls both are good to eat, and reasonably priced but very heavy to digest because of their high content of greasy dalda. Highly popular in this area, and you can try once if you really have enormous love for Biryani.
I can rate nothing more than 3.

Food quality is excellent.. Biriyani is the must try out for foodies. It's a take away food stop. So the only way to enjoy food over here is to take it and have with your family and friends..

Good for local biriyani,kababs and roll. Open to road stall with ok taste. Proteins can be of better quality, specially mutton which is often very chewy.

I just vomitted after having the biryani. The biryani was full of salt no taste nothing. Should consider improving it's quality. I am a muglai food lover and a1 haji disappointed me.

Good food. Good taste. Located in a very congested place. Had biryani. It was good and cheap. Good for take aways. The roll section is good. Atleast I find some taste in their rolls unlike others. Its a yes outlet from my side.
