Bakingwali. A saviour. I m bad at gifts and a lot puzzled when it's planning a gift for my grl frnd. A day before her bday I was puzzled and thought of calling bakingwali. She gracefully took my order (at a short notice) and with her creativity delivered me with much more than my expectation. Those choco hazelnut treats were yummy, delicious, soft and made with love. I got it delivered yesterday... Had a couple of them today as well after keeping them in the refrigerator but they were still the same as I had it fresh yesternyt. Hassle free order and delivery. It became more special when I discovered that we were classmates. Thank you Poulami. A proud friend...
P.S. - Make your special days even more special with a touch of Bakingwali.
4.5 coz Bakingwali I know u have a long way to go and I will revise my ratings on my next order... So let's keep .5 for the next time.....

I had asked for a customised burger cake for my brother's birthday. To be very honest, I did not expect the outcome which I had received. The cake was marvellous and superbly done with all the detailing. It tasted pretty good too. The cupcakes were very creative and unique and stole all our hearts with it's taste. And when I went at her place to collect my order, she treated me to one of her homemade chocolates and it was heavenly. To summarise it all, I loved the entire thing. I loved what they had to offer and how they offered. Thank you so much BakingWali. :)

Bakingwali makes boutique cakes,cupcakes and chocolate. I ordered a few personalised cupcakes for my best friend's birthday and those made the birthday the most special one. Words will fall short to describe my experience. First of all the owner of Bakingwali is a sweetheart and she knows magic. I called and messaged her so many times but she always behaved so nicely. Even in her busy schedule the I received them on time. I ordered 12 cupcakes and wanted all my friend's hobbies to be customised and she did it absolutely perfectly. Everybody loved it. Taste was just great and yummy. Price is reasonable. Very eager to have more cakes from here in future. Lots of love to Bakingwali and keep going like this.

Since it was my dad's 51st Birthday so I really wanted to make the celebration a memorable one. Unlike every year this time I dint go for any cake shop but I approached this beautiful Girl and requested her to bake a theme cake for my dad. Every time I open Instagram, her every creation looks so beautiful and mouth watering.  And having a sweet tooth, I always wanted to taste one since months. I got the opportunity this time.
I told her my dad being a chem teacher and she baked the right one for me. As you can see , the 1st glance of this cake, was overwhelming one to me. The chocolaty taste was too good. (Not like the ones i taste often) Rather better than monginis or few others. May be because it's home baked with love. The softness and that heavenly creamy feel in each bite was mind blowing! Even there was nuts and raisins or tasteful dry fruits inside. Which added more to the overall taste. 
I am waiting once again for another such occasion to come so that I can reorder from her. 
Same will I suggest to anyone who is a cake lover, if you really want to taste something better or anything to change the daily taste of sweetness, go for BakingWali. I guarantee, it will suit your taste buds and every moods!

I used to be an avid reviewer even about a year ago, stopped due to my laziness, but came today to tell you guys how beautiful your cake will be once you place your order at BakingWali! 
I ordered a two-tier butterscotch cake for my father's 50th birthday, with toppings of everything he likes, which included- a Canon EOS 450D camera, two Iphones and and two pairs of spectacles! And I had also mentioned in my brief that it should elegant, nothing OTT. And well, the result was much, MUCH beyond my expectations! The camera was such a sight to behold, my guests exclaimed that Canon should feature BakingWali for that amazing replica! The spectacles were super cute and the phones were exactly what I wanted it to be! To add to this the cake without the toppings looked very elegant too, with the color combo being the highlight!
The taste of the cake was subtle, not too sweet yet perfect, with the strawberry cream providing an awesome contrast to the cake's butterscotch flavor! And importantly, it was the perfect quantity for my guests and far more importantly, the price was very reasonable! 
Also, the highlight for me, they home delivered the two tier cake! Saved me a LOT of trouble, a big thank you to BakingWali!

I was pretty much bored with the regular cakes that came to our house in birthdays from monginis, cakes, pattisserie etc., and so I wanted to order something different on my husband's birthday this year but the designer cakes that I got online would actually cut a hole in my pocket. At this point, Bakingwali came to my rescue. With heavenly taste, marvellous sense of decoration, intricate detailing, it was worth every penny. The cake was an eye candy to everyone looking at it and shutters went on clicking. Way to go Poulomi, the Bakingwali !!

Before you start reading this review, please note, It might feel like a biased one, not because Poulomi or rather, BakingWali is an old friend, but because I am a repeat customer and a happy one at that! Probably I am one of those rare people who saw her first heart shaped plain cakes to the work of wonder she churns out on a daily basis at present. I have tasted uncountable freshly baked goodies out of her oven and she is one person, I know and vouch for, who never considers compromising quality for gain. Connoisseurs of different variations of baked sweets, cake enthusiasts what ever you might consider yourself, I can bet on good money that until you try cakes from this lady, you don't get to claim that you have tasted fineries in life

I have ordered a Minion theme based designed cake from BakingWali. It was for my sister's bday. First of all, I wanna talk about the service BakinWali provided to me. In one word, AWESOME! Owner of the bakery called me, asked my preference. I just told her my idea for the cake. She listened and on the next day, came up with a nice idea. I didn't need to say a single word about the design. It was great. Now coming to the delivery part, I asked her to deliver it by 4 pm. She made the delivery on 2.30 pm. She was Super-fast in this category.
Now coming to the taste. My reaction was - WOW! Amazing! I am 100% sure that this is the best bakery in the town. All the best Bakingwali. Keep growing!

Oh!! what to say... this homemade cupcakes made my sunday. #Bakingwali thanks a ton. 
I came to know about this cute  creator from facebook & being a cake lover i couldn't resist myself from tasting it. And, guess what.. on a fine sunday morning it arrived in a little box in d shape of  cupcakes... it was pure love...with the mouthwatering feeling.  Cupcakes are always my favourite.. so I opted for two flavours & #bakingwali made a perfect choice for me with the knot of red velvet & chocolate flavour. 
Those little sweet candies just made my day...‚ù§ 
Thank you soooooo much poulomi. U r a magician ‚ù§

I've been following BakingWali's work religiously for the last one year. And, I must say, I'm amazed at how wonderfully she has evolved as one of the best bakers in the city. So, what better than ordering one's own birthday cake. Initially, it was supposed to be my all time favourite - Choco truffle cake. But on the designated day, as I waited eagerly for my cake to arrive, there it was in front of me, a cake I've only seen in pictures. A five-layered ice cream cake. It was perfectly done. Despite the sultry September heat, the ice cream hardly melted away even after being kept in the open for long. And yes, this perfectly frosted, baked, decorated ice cream chocolate cake served more than 25 people at a go. Needless to say, that this is one of the best cake I've had in ages. Thanks to BakingWali, my b'day was sorted for the year. I love the professionalism ane the hard work she puts in. And going by the social media popularity, all I can say is BakingWali, burning the midnight lamp is working wonders for you. Wishing her many more baking years of success.

My wife ordered a designer cake for my birthday from Bakingwali . It was prepared & delivered at our place punctually at the designated hour . The decoration was brilliant , icing really attractive while the garnishment with fruits etc made it look stunning . The chocolate truffle inside was of high quality making it mouthwateringly tasty . Price is quite reasonable considering the quality & amount of work that goes into it . Keep it up Bakingwali ...

Yesterday ordered another cake from Bakingwali to celebrate my wife's birthday . As my wife is a big fan of Prawn I decided to present her a cake themed after Prawns . We were  astonished by the design of the cake where Prawns were placed on a sigree grill . The feature & colour of the prawns was so natural that it was difficult to believe that it was actually made of fondants. Everyone was in unison in praising the innovative mind & the beautiful handiwork that went into making the cake . Tastewise was excellent as usual . That there was only one day's time between ordering and delivering of the cake made the work even more praiseworthy .

Post-Review :
ORDER, ORDER ! MUST ORDER DESIGNER CAKE'S !
As i did mentioned i will give a post review of the cake.
Taste - 9.9/10
Decoration - 9.9/10
Quality -9.9/10
Quantity -9.9/10
Delivery Service - 9.9/10
9.9 is given to make her bake n deliver better day by day. It's should be in continual process.
Out of her busy schedule and so much cooperation with such a nagging n fickle minded guy lyk me.
She did with ease and passionately.
She just made by day. I woke up in the morning she send me the picture i was messmerized.
The actual review was given by my parents as i gave them the surprise. They loved the cake taste wise and look wise. By looks it was hard to resist
Will be ordering from her forever.
@BAKINGWALI keep up the good work üòä
