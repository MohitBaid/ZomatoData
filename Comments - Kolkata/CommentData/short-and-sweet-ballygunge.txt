I had ordered 2 cakes for my husband's birthday. A one pound chocolate ganache and a two pound chocolate truffle. My husband being a fan of Star Was and Star Trek, I had asked for customised cakes. Everyone loved the cakes, they were fresh and absolutely delicious, though I'm partial to the chocolate ganache. The best thing is that I could order a one pound customised cake which is rare, you normally have to order 3-4 pounds if you want it customised. Looking forward to trying out the other flavours.

Short and Sweet captured the hearts of all the guests with their creation of a 50th anniversary cake for my aunt. The nostalgic theme of the cake " ei poth jodi na shesh hoi" was passionately created by Jayatri. The quality of the chocolate in the cake was superb. Thank you Short and Sweet for this masterpiece. 

Reading the other reviews, which are all 4+ and mostly 5, I am somewhat intrigued by the weighted average given.  Do not understand this " reviewer credibility" !

I think I have never experienced chocolate like Short and Sweet ever in my life.........it's an absolute dream come true for me. The ganache is to die for and so is the mousse and the tart. Every one, it's a must try.

I hardly have written reviews but was compelled to write for short and sweet food. Had ordered the mushroom and bandel cheese puffs and chicken vol~au~vent.. it was wonderful.. the crunch of the puffs was amazing and the chicken was juicy. Both the bases of the puffs were perfectly baked. The after taste was yumm..everyone in the family enjoyed the taste and presentation of the food. Top notch!  Kudos to Chef Jayatri for the hard work ..ur love for ur work speaks volumes through ur food.. way to go.. cheers to short and sweet....

In her short and sweetest gestures, she brilliantly pulled it through. Thank you Short and Sweet for withstanding my craziness and making this happen. The "traveller" birthday boy was in awe of his new found Chocolate and Coffee Flavoured Suitcase Cake. Both flavour and taste surpasses all our expectations. üòÉ Guys a must try for lip smacking delicacies. Else you would regret üòâ

I had ordered for a gym themed cake for a friend of mine. And each and every possible way of making it look as well as taste quintessential was taken care of. It came out just the way I wanted it to be. Thank You so much for making it happen. And all the best for your future endeavours. Keep rocking and rolling!! :D

The use of Bandel Cheese as well as Goan sausages in their savouries, struck me as being singularly innovative. I've had the good fortune of sampling both savoury and sweet delicacies of Short and Sweet and found them to be a tad 'hatke' from the usual run of the mill stuff.

Very seriously recommended.

We have ordered desserts from Short and Sweet several times and never been disappointed. Now have to try the savoury fare.
All the best for your enterprise.
