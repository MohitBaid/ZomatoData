This small joint is a new entrant in the food scene of Garia and is  very close to Garia More and Pantaloons. We ordered their Murg Pudina Kebab, Chicken Dopiaza, Tandoori Roti and Laccha Paratha. The kebabs were very soft and tasty . So were the Rotis and Parathas. Chicken Dopiyaza was okay though, nothing great but soft.
Ps. This is a sit-down diner and a take-away restaurant.

This is a small joint located near Garia more. I opted for takehome from here.
              We tried out lachcha paratha, chicken tandoori butter masala and paneer butter masala. The paratha was good and I felt that the chicken tandoori butter masala was great. The combination was absolutely lip smacking, but the paneer butter masala was really disappointing.

FINAL VERDICT- The place lacks consistency in quality across the dishes but I would again want to try out the Chicken dish mentioned above.

It's less of a restro and more of a takeaway counter. The tandoor items are pretty decent. Chinese was okay-ish too. The other items are not that great. All in all it's an above average place. PS, their service is pretty amateurish; guys need to work on that.
