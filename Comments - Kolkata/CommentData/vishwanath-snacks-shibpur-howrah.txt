This place amidst the crowd of Kolkata has its real taste and spice...This place introduced by my Bengali friend was a great one to have snacks and that too in a reasonable price... The rolls were really good. The chicken pakora was tasty n that too one piece for Rs.10...  The chowmein was in good quantity n one person can't eat alone...It also has ice creams n d one I liked was d mango ice cream in a mango shape container.....

One of the best and my favorite destination for dishes like Moghlai Paratha and egg rolls.... the food is great and the service is also good... the people working there are very humble towards their customers and overall a great roll destination in Howrah....
