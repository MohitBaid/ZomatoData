Very tasty and delicious items. 
But i'm afraid they are not so popular. Hence the low rating. 

Now i'm writing this just to get to the 140 character mark.

A tiny shop dishing out some top class fish items. The food served scores high on quality, especially the Fish Fries. They are delightfully tasty, crunchy on the outside and have a very healthy filling of juicy fish inside. The prawn items are also good. The mustard sauce they provide along with the fries is heavenly. On the downside they do not have home delivery, so you have to take pains to procure your order. . A nice place, but they need to be more ambitious....if not for themselves, then for their loyal customers.

I just saw that I have missed this place. A very small kiosk located beside the Tandoor Park, it was a lovely place to try the fries from IFB every Friday before I went to my Physics tuition. Very small place with only take away options or to stand and eat, I used to have the butterfly prawns and fish fingers and fries. All of them were very good. It was here where I first saw the electronic no fire fryer. The food was actually good over here. A throwback visit is long overdue. Happy Dining! :)

It's a small outlet just beside the take away counter of Tandoor park... I tried some of there stuffs... and undoubtedly each and every items are very tasty... only one condition you have to ate it piping hot... deco was nothing to say about... the staff was very talkative... but I liked his attitude... Will try there other items in future... pocket pinch was friendly...

This small outlet is located adjacent to Tandoor Park. It is an IFB initiative which tells you how good their ready-to-eat stuffs are. The person making and serving the food is very amicable and suggests the correct things to order. So,it's better you ask for his suggestions before ordering. We had ordered Cocktail Fish Finger and Fish Poppers. Both the items were very delicious and fresh. I can hardly recall when I had last relished any such tit-bit items involving fish. The ketchup provided along with the dish made the taste even better. The Fish Poppers were crunchy with soft fillings. It tasted superb with the ketchup. The Fish Fingers however tasted better without the ketchup. The Fish Fingers served were 5 in number along with 10-12 pieces of Fish Poppers. A must visit for fish lovers. Non fish lovers too should try this place. It might make you drool over it's fish items,it is that good. I would definitely visit this place again.

Located near the jodhpurpark bus stand this small outlet is an initiative by IFB.Its a tiny takeaway counter which also accepts bulk orders.The menu boasts of various fish items mainly (bekti and prawn) and the man at the counter is most helpful in suggesting products.On his suggestion we ordered Cocktail fish finger and fish poppers.Both the items were served in the same plate but that just made things easier for us as we had to stand and eat.Also the dish was served with a different type of a sauce.Zomato needs to update its menu as prices have increased in the new menu.
The fish poppers were just out of the world! I loved it's taste,texture,crunch-actually every part of it!It tasted even better with the sauce. After having this item the benchmark that fish bar had set for itself was high.
Then we tried the cocktail fish fingers. They were very fresh and tasted decent nothing special.They taste best when had without the sauce.
A must try for all fish lovers as items served is tasty and fresh! I am definitely coming back to try all their products!

'Fish Bar' is an eatery where you can get food items based on fish, prawn and shrimp. It is an initiative of IFB. This eatery is located in Dhakuria just opposite to the HDFC bank and beside 'Tandoor Park'. I was curious about this outlet for a long time, so I decided to go here yesterday. The eatery is very small, run by one man. He was very courteous and guided me through the menu. I ordered the fish poppers first. The food took five minutes to arrive. It was served with complimentary 100 gms of French fries. The fish poppers were little fish-stuffed balls which was fried to perfection. It was juicy and delicious. The French fries came with mustard sauce and the potato strips were perfectly fried. Next, I ordered 'Breaded Fish Fillet'. The food arrived in five minutes. This dish impressed me the post. There was so much fish in the thin coating of the batter, that I was impressed. It was delectable. The only con was that they did not have any seating arrangement. They must look into that. But, the food is great over here. I will definitely visit again.
