I did not realize Jaiswal Nimki House was even listed on Zomato until I saw my friend and fellow foodie Rahul's review ! 
 I love the crisp hot jalebis they serve up and have enjoyed them countless times. The samosa and kachori is pretty good as well. I also usually make a "mixture" of the gathias and bhujia and carry home  makes for a yummy snack. The dhokla is good but personally feel Saurashtra makes better Dhoklas.
However if the nibbles strike you and you don't want to burn a hole in your pocket this is a good place for a snack.

Anyone who has lived in park circus area will surely know this place. It's very near to the karaya police station. Having lived in that area for some time I have had the stuff from this place million times. In the recent days they aren't as good as they used to be a few years back. 

We love the piping hot kachoris, samosa and dhokla . They also make good namkeens like bhujia etc . 

I particularly like the jalebis and kachoris a lot. The Chutney they give with the samosa is not as great as it used to be . 

Value for money and very fresh .
