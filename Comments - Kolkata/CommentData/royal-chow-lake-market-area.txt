Just few hours ago me n my maternal aunt visited this place for dinner after a tired walking by watching puja pandals 
I ask one of the guard is there a table for two he said yes 
Staffs are nice and well behaved 
Outside it was too hot but still these guys kept the ac in low temp but never mind because its still cool from outside
So we ordered  mix hakka noodle n paneer shezwan 
I was really surprised n shocked that they are serving water in plaatic glass
Another shock was awating for me i cant belive my eyes
They provide us plastic plate n spoons for having our dinner  my aunt was laughing at that moment by watching this
the food was average but tasty 
Guys you can give a try once

Horrible taste of food. Quantity OK for the price but quality is just terrible. Half food wasted. Chili chicken seems like sweet gravy chicken. Vegetables in noodles unfried. Not ordering anymore from this vendor

Just by offering 15% discount while taking orders from zomato might make this place an attractive proposition while ordering when short on cash but it fails miserably when delivering on the food quality..we ordered two non veg chinese combo which consisted of a portion of veg chowmein,veg fried rice alongwith two pieces of garlic chicken and garlic fish each..while quantity is decent for the price its the quality which is a mighty let down..its utterly tasteless and doesn even bother to tickle ur buds which might make u think whether your buds have gone numb or not..my last order from this place..

We had visited today and ordered biryani combo. Three of us was there, two order biryani combo with chap and another with chicken salad. Biryani was tasting like pulao, chicken chap tastes like alur dom, and salad was worst in taste which i can't eat even. Two of the chicken pieces was not properly washed and contains blood. Service was good. Quantity was enough. Quality and taste was worst.

While Royal Lebanese is a good shawarma joint, their spinoff Royal Chow leaves a lot to be desired. It's kinda difficult to mess up Indian Chinese food, but Royal Chow somehow manages to do it. Their food is tasteless and poor in quality, and definitely not worth it. I would say you get better Chinese food in the nearby street stalls than you do in this particular restaurant. A bad experience food wise.

Yesterday we thought of having dinner here. This place serves both Chinese and Lebanese dishes but for yesterday we stuck to Chinese. As we entered the place it was empty but after some time other customers also came in. We ordered lat Mai Kai for the starter which tasted good but the service was a bit slow and once it arrived we devoured it. For the main course we ordered one moon fan rice, one Singapore rice and one Hakka noodles along with red cook chicken and fish In oyster sauce. The 3 of us underestimated the quantity but after eating both the rice dishes we didn't have any space for the noodles so we asked them to pack it for us. Coming to the taste the moon fan rice was the winner, it was nicely made and the red cook chicken complimented it well but the Singapore rice was not that good. I personally found that it had no taste of its own so I had to mix the chicken gravy and soy sauce to eat it. The fish was nicely made and the pieces were really tender. Another thing that I think was a little off for me was that both the rice dishes lacked salt.

But I must say that the staffs were courteous and answered to all our questions patiently and also helped us to serve each time. If I go next time I would surely like to taste their Lebanese items.

Visited this place yesterday. It is located right beside royal Lebanese on sarat bose road near desopriya park crossing. The food here is quite good. We had lat mai kai chicken starter, schewan egg fried rice and chilli fish. The@ schewan egg fried rice was really spicy but good in terms of quantity and plentiful vegetables. The chilli fish was tender and succulent with the exact amount of spices. The game changer was the lat mai kai chicken. Those chicken ball were oozing with flavours garnished with finely chopped spring onions. Really lovely. Overall decent place

'Royal Chow' is located in Sarat Bose Road just beside Royal Lebanese. We were walking down the street yesterday and suddenly their combo menu came into view. Intrigued by it, we entered this shop. 

The interior has minimalistic decor and there was an acute need of cleaning. Nevertheless, we ordered one Chinese combo and one chicken biryani combo. 

The food arrived in ten minutes. The chin combo had veg fried rice, veg noodles, chilli fish, chilli chicken and salad. All the items except the salad tasted average. The gravy was very runny. I was disappointed by the combo.. 

The chicken biryani combo was good. It had chicken biryani, chicken shwarma salad, and raita. The chicken biryani was good. The salad had more vegetables than chicken. The chicken of the biryani was soft, tender and juicy. The raita was good as well. 

This visit was a disappointment to me. I will not visit again.

A more than a decent place. A haven for school and college goers. Quality and quantity of food in such shocking low prices is really a bliss for foodie like us. 
I ordered their Chinese and chelo combo over the phone.
Both were satisfactory enough when pocket pinch us such low compare to its location. 
Great work guys. 
Will come someday for a dine in experience soon.

An ordinary chinese restaurant with ordinary decor and sitting arrangement. The chinese menu gives you a lot of options to choose from. There is also some Thai dishes and lebanese dishes in the menu.

Discovered this outlet close to my workplace and decided to try a Zomato delivery for a combo meal. The meal considered of veg Hakka noodles, veg fried rice, 2 pieces each of chilli Paneer and veg Manchurian and a kimchi Salad. 
All of this for 117/- only! ( Got a discount via zomato too)

The food came nearly packed and the portions were good. Quite liked the Hakka chow and Paneer chilli. The Manchurian coins were well made too.

Definitely gonna try this place again.

Ordered their non veg thali via zomato.It comes for only 99bucks.Consists of veg rice,veg noodles,garlic fish, chilli chicken and kimchi.For a price so low,I must say the quality of food was really good.Tasty stuff.The kimchi was disgusting though but it came as an extra so I'm overlooking that.Good flavours at a cheap price,what more does one need?

This one's right next to the Royal Lebanese shop. They even share the first name! They have seating arrangements and have quite an impressive menu. Sadly we were in a hurry and decided to wrap up some hakka noodles. It was moderately hot by the time we got it home but tasted awesome! Will be going back to try the other dishes. Quite impressive buffet price!

We stumbled upon this place by accident. The restaurant is small but gets a lot of traffic and has a good ambience in general.

About the food, we ordered Iranian Kay Kebab and Chicken Hot and Sour Soup. The kebab was something new for us, the spices were mild but prominent enough. The soup however, wasn't that good. Needed more heat and tang.

All in all, a good place to grab a few bites with friends. Be sure to spend a little bit of cash though but it's not stupidly expensive.

We went there for a quick dinner. A small place with good ambience. Its adjacent to royal Lebanese and a new initiative. We ordered crispy chilli baby corn as starter and it tasted awesome. For the main course we had red cook chicken and chicken hakka. Red cook chicken was an experimental dish which the waiter suggested and it was really delicious. At the price of 200 they serve 10 medium size chicken pieces. The noodle was more than enough for a single person. For two of us the bill was 460 and no extra charge till puja. Allover i was very very happy. Service speed is good. Rating 4
Next visit 2016: We visited this place again to have good chinese and biriyani combo at less price as were hungry with almost empty pockets. The combos costed 100 each so we were happy based on our previous experience. The biriyani combo was supposed to have chicken Biriyani and chicken chap. The chinese combo was supposed to have Veg fried rice, Veg hakka noodles, Chilli Chicken(2 pieces), Garlic fish(2 pieces) and kimchi salad. When we ordered we were informed that they do not have chicken chap. So we were little dissapointed. The combo is written on board outside then how can they say that it is not available at 8pm in the evening. So we thought of ordering two chinese combos. 10 mins later they came to say that they managed 1 chicken chap and it will be served so we got our hope back. When the food was served we felt the disaster. The amount was extremely less though it was reasonable according to the price but they used to serve enough food at low prices before. The noodle was oily and not at all tasty. I prefer noodle over rice still I had to eat rice which was atleast better. The chilli chicken had extremely less amount of chicken and full of crust. The garlic fish was soft but had a rotten smell. Coming to the biriyani combo it was horrible. Huge amount of oil and the taste was worse than homemade biriyani. The chicken chap tasted more like kashmiri dum aloo. The service also got worsen.

Small place but pretty good..gives you a nice homely feel. Skipping the popular chinese options, we decided to have their Lebanese speciality, which is Grilled Chicken served with Pita Bread and an add-on white sauce. The chicken had crispy skin and was grilled to perfection. We were two of us, yet we mamaged to eat one grilled chicken(full) and later on, another half of it..😁 But they don't accept cards, that's a con. Also, we had to order the white dip separately although Grilled Chicken always comes with a dip/sauce without even asking and paying extra for it. Nevertheless,its a good eating option, especially after a superhectic workout session at the gym! @

A decent place with minimalist ambiance. An economical restaurant adjacent to Royal Lebanese, they are known for their Chinese, Thai and Lebanese delicacies. 

I have tried their Grilled Chicken and Chilli Crab. Excellent taste for the price they offer. Would definitely come back here for more offerings.

Royal Chow is a small eatery adjacent to the Royal Lebanese outlet at the desapriyo park crossing.

Went for a quick dinner there which friends on a Saturday night and ordered very simple Hakka noodles and Chilli Chicken which took a long time to arrive at the table hence conclusion driven that the service is not organized at all. Food was average nothing extraordinary. Not satisfied.

We visited this place after watching a movie at priya cinema. This place is just adjacent to royal Lebanese. Their food is awesome. Both the chinese and lebanese delicacies are mouth watering. We had their grilled chicken and iranian sish kebab.. Labanese delicacies. Then cantonese noodles and sliced oyester sauce chicken from their chinese kitchen. Food were really good in quality and quantity. Interior is good and staffs are cooperative.

I would gladly add this to my latest discoveries, and man, I'm pleased! So very pleased. :D since my exams are over now, and my 'khai-khai'ness has started, I'm totally in the mood for gorging on good food, ALL THE TIME! This joint is the newest in the block, located exactly beside Royal Lebanese. In fact it's an extension of the same eating house, if I'm not mistaken. 
Now coming to the food. We ordered :
• Iranian Kay Kebab - a pleasure to the taste buds. 6 pieces of succulent chicken served with pita bread. Full marks for this.
• Chicken momo - 8 juicy momo's stuffed with minced chicken which were melting in my mouth. Ah! Delightful. 
• Chicken Chelo Kebab - I'm not really comparing this with the Chelo kebabs of the legendary eateries, but this priced at 160 bucks is competitive and well, it doesn't disappoint you in the least bit. At least I wasn't! There kebabs were tasteful and spicy, just the way I like it, and the portion of the herb rice was very good. Loved it!
Now talking of the interiors, this place has a cute ambience. The lighting and décor is minimalistic. The staff is courteous and the joint is centrally located on Sarat Bose Road.
The pricing is great - 6 of us ate for 1050 bucks, which according to me is a steal!
Definitely a place worth visiting for all those times when you're in a mood for some good food without burning a hole in your pocket! Coming back again and again.
