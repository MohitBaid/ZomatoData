Overall ambience is really nice. 
Service was good not the best. We had to repeat some orders 3 to 4 times to deliver.
Coming to the food we had
Rosemary shrimps
Chicken involtin
Sea bass
Lamb loin
Chicken milanese
Chicken pizza
Cafe latte
Kesar ice cream
Food and quantity was not upto the cost.
Sea bass and chicken involtin was delicious.
Lamb loin was hard to chew and was not at all upto the level.
Good for one time visit.

I visited La Cucina to get the taste of authentic Italian cuisine on a very special day- My wife's birthday. Observing my wife's craving over Italian food, we decided to go for one of the best Italian restaurant of the city. Truly it lived up to our expectations.

Ambience is pretty good. 
Service was excellent and prompt too. Staffs were super courteous and always took special care during our visit. 
Food - we ordered the preparation on Lamb Ravioli and the mushroom sauce was just out of the world!
Lamb Ravioli just melted in our mouth. Then we ordered Chicken aglio olio pizza with thin crust and it also was awesome in terms of taste. 
We then went for penne chicken paste in pink sauce. The pasta was tasty but I thought it was but too overpriced.
Lastly they had something in-store for us. When we were going to order our dessert - classic Tiramisu, they brought a special chocolate birthday cake for my wife. Honestly, we did not expect it but at the same time, loved the surprise and gesture. The cake was pure Bliss with it's triple layer chocolate.
I would love to visit the restaurant again.

Only thing to improve:- Add few more items in the menu.

Been here a lot of times and finally reviewing. Been here last on 09th Sept 2017. 
Minauti and her team do a fantastic job to make the amazing food an awesome experience. The reworked menu is as amazing as earlier. The miniestrone soup in pesto base was mind blowing. The dela casa pizza was again as amazing as always. The sundried tomoato rissoto was simply mmmm... and to top it all the chocolate bomb takes us to a different world all together. 
A visit worth repeating always.

La cucina serves a very different style of rustic yet refined Italian food. Dishes are usually served in the same pan that they are cooked in. They had an antipasti buffet, which wasn't very appetising. Service was very good. Though wine prices are quite high.

Thing crust pizzas will make you weak on your feet to have it.
Cheese sauce penne - less cooked and grazy - so damn perfect

We had recently visited the place to be a part of the Restaurant week 2017. The place was offering a variety of appetizers, main course and desert to choose from their set menu. 

The place is beautifully done and the open kitchen along with the wood fired stove at the Centre definitely adds to the charm. We ordered for a golden fried goat cheese medallion with slow roasted cherry tomatoes and Sfiziosa pizza as appetizers. The goat cheese was extremely rich and creamy and induced multilevel taste sensations in the head. The pizza was good too. For the main course we settled for bucatini tossed with cured pork meat and the beef tenderloin. The medium rare steak was extremely tender was oozing out taste. It was the show stealer for the night.  Finally for dessert we had Sicilian Cannoli and a melting chocolate tart with vanilla ice cream which were pretty much average. 

Overall a decent experience.  The place is good,  the staff courteous and some of the food delicious.

Had been there on 21st April at dinner time with my family and 1 of my friend's family. We had purchased the Nearbuy vouchers. The menu is different for Nearbuy.  But the food served was too good. The mocktails were also made to our request. The only concern little bit was there service which was slow and not up to Hyatt's standards.

We went for a Sunday brunch just the other day. Its not so much a brunch as a lunch since it starts at 1230. But that works fine with me. You can sit there for hours sipping your bottomless glass of very decent Proseco and take all the time in the world to have each course. 
So four hours later we were happily stuffed and quite drowsy ....... took some time to gather the bits and write a review that this place so deserves. 
The highlights for me: 
The beet root canape
The pesto pizza
The rotellini in smoke bell pepper sauce
The cold cuts - parma ham, prosciutto 
The generous platter of cheese
A perfect Margarita pizza
The experience at this price is quite a gift to the city.

It was the Easter evening, close to quarter to 8 when we walked in to a nearly empty La Cucina . 

Few words about the service :

We were shown our table, but no body 'sat' us at the table. Pulling and pushing the chairs was how it all began. 

We got our share of the complimentary bread pieces , but without a dip, is there really a point ? We ordered a cheese dip , which took its own sweet time to arrive. 

No change of cutlery for the appetiser and main dishes. We didn't make a fuss , but it would have been welcome. 

The dessert ( Tiramisu ) was served on a dessert plate , along with the spoons. But we were two, and we needed our own plates to eat from. Those plates came after attention was drawn to our table. 

It would be unfair of me to comment too much on the food, as I have rarely eaten authentic Italian food, either in Kolkata or anywhere else. We had Kalamata centred chicken roulade in mushroom sauce as the appetiser, which had a subtle taste. I had expected the chicken to be a little softer though. We had the Chicken Oglio Olio Pizza, which was nice, but served bit cold. After around 15 minutes the thin crust seemed to harden from the sides. 

I was expecting to get 'overwhelmed' considering I had gone through some generous Zomato reviews on the place. 
Sadly that didn't happen. 

The service level needs to go up a few notches higher , considering this is one of the very few fine dining places exclusively devoted to the Italian cuisine. A simple benchmark can be the services offered at any of the ' Mainland China ' group restaurants in Kolkata. Point to note is none of them are housed in star rated properties; they are present mostly in shopping malls. 

I would also look forward to some 
Italian touch to the music played at the restaurant. Speaking of me; the magical voice of Luciano Pavarotti would have certainly made the Chicken Pizza taste better , instead of the English melodies :).

Being a regular at Park Hyatt and Hyatt properties in Hyderbad and Hampi..wanted to celebrate my wedding anniversary at the much talked about La Cucinain Hyatt Kolkata..turned out it was one of the saddest experience in Calcutta.

Food was okay no complaints...service was a big big letdown...Drinks were not served for an hour..Dips not served at all with Antipasti...service super slow...pizzas served cold...menu provided for ordering desserts but no one came back to take the order...had requested a cake for our wedding anniversary which was not served at all...Double checked twice with the captain and waiters on whether its an off day or some issues with staff but the answer which I got was that the crowd aiddenly surged. 

I do expect fine dine restos to be able to handle crowd without affecting your guests at the table. Very average evening for the prices paid.

Cheers!

1. The deserts taste really awesome! Worth all the time and money!
2. Baked Cannelloni Pasta - Tastes good, served hot and nicely presented.
3. Pizza- Though thin crust pizza is available, even then it does not taste any better than a below average food joint/restaurant.

We did not order any other item apart from this as the service was below average (less of attention to individual tables). Service was just a little slow that too on a moderately filled restaurant, wasn't the rush hours exactly. Also, specially for ONLY VEG people, we found that there were very few options.

Ambiance - very good, decor very nice and sophisticated.
¬†
Overall, would not suggest for people looking for tasty and lip-smacking food, however, people searching for more of health-friendly food (less spicy and less of over-do in food), definitely a hit.

Like all average bongs, Italian food means pizza and pasta to me, and tha too, pizza from Dominos or Pizza Hut. It's not that we've not been exposed to a proper Italian food, but the lack of an Italian fine dining restaurant had made it difficult. So, this time, when I was invited for the Truffle festival in La Cucina, Hyatt Regency Kolkata, with chef Silvia Landucci from Boscovivo and the famed food writer Karen Anand, I was excited.

La cucina is the flagship Italian specialty restaurant in Hyatt Regency Kolkata and probably the only Italian fine dining restaurant in the luxury hotels in the city, so the expectation was pretty high. Though I've been to Gucci a number of times with family, but somehow this outlet was a new one for me and what could've been a better time to visit it than this promotion ?

The ambiance and service, as it should be, is top notch here but what differentiates this place from other joints, is the vast window that overlooks the salt lake stadium. And a window seat there can make even a sad person happy- was my first reaction, once I entered the outlet. Like all other outlets in the hotel, this one too, had an open kitchen- so interacting with the chefs and requesting them for the small special requirements is much easier.

Truffle is an under-used ingredient for the Italian food in India. And, considering the price factor and the acquired taste that it has, why shouldn't it be ? Mostly till now, it's been used for the high end banquets and specially curated super posh meals, but it seems this time, Karen Anand and Sylvia has got some special plans in mind for making it available for the mass market. So, the less costly products like truffle honey and truffle oil are getting introduced and I feel they're going to be the next in-thing for Kolkata.

However, enough of the non-food gyan and please stop cursing me. I am coming to the food. We were offered a specially curated pre-plated menu. The menu, though having lots of unknown terms (for an under-educated blogger like me...), seemed interesting and off we started the journey.

For the first course, I chose Burrata (as I louuuuuve cheese- period). The smell of Truffle was present prominently and one thing I'e noticed. all these places make this dish right and this was no exception. If you like subtlety, go for this dish- recommended. And, me being me, I was eyeing the dish ordered by my friend Debjani, who sat beside me. She went for the Scallops and before she could say anything, I hijacked one of those small diver scallops and put in my mouth. And pure foodgasm it was. Those small beauties were divine and the pure underneath (yellow pepper, green peas and pumpkin) had made the difference. Debjani was cursing me- but what the heck.....

Rice is a weakness for any bong and we're not ashamed of it. So, in an Italian meal also, I opted for the Risotto, which was closest to rice. cooked with duck liver and mushrooms and finished with truffle salsa, it was heaven. A dish with Fatty Duck Liver is rare to find in the city and loved this dish. Chef Sumeet Pryadarshi, with the consultation of Karen and Sylvia, had worked wonders. Again Debjani (with a square face) sacrificed some of her Fettuccine. But, after the Risotto, it didn't stand a chance.

The menu was designed for the bongs - I thought and my guess came into reality when the next dish was served. It was the Norwegian Salmon. Now, I always have a fancy for this thing (and a lot of other things though.....) and when the knife is passed through it , I feel a primal pleasure. The dish looked great and was a treat for the taste buds...

For dessert, a Pannacotta was served and the truffle honey was used subtly here, to give it a different finish.

Overall, the meal was awesome. And with the company of good friends, how can it go wrong ? La Cucina serves a sunday brunch with unlimited pouring at a very very cost effective price, but that's another story.....

Thanks Dineout!

Thanks to Dineout today we went to La Cucina. I usually end up going to this when there's a special occasion but today Dineout made it special. 50% off on the food bill. The food here was yum. Saffron sauce Ravioli was the dish of the day. It isn't available on the menu, but on special requests they do make it for you. The 7 cheese pizza was also crazy. Overall the food here is amazing. Service was spot on. Ambience was great. Feels great to eat here. One of the best places to eat Italian food for sure. Today we just got lucky thanks to the ads on the newspapers.

It was New Years day and the celebration had to be grand and opulent. And there couldn't have been better option than La Cucina. The ambience of the place was gorgeous and impressive. 
Coming to the food, it was Sunday brunch. The spread in the cold section was fascinating including prawn cocktail, asparagus ricotta, avocado salad, roasted beef, bacon and lamb salad to name a few. The green peas arancini, though veg, in the hot appetiser section was real tasty. 
All the pasta dishes were fabulous but the pigi pasta with orange pesto was enticing.
The pizzas were also worth mentioning.
The dessert spread was endless and each one was magnificent in taste.
With all good things, the only thing and an important one, which was disheartening is the set of dirty plates kept at the fresh plate area. And it was not just a single plate but multiple ones. Which is not at all expected from a 5 star hotel restaurant.

Dinner here for a special occasion. A special word for the bar. All our drinks were great, especially the perfectly made whisky sour. ¬†We stuck to vegetarian food so the asparagus salad was quite petite, to put it politely :) But it was delicious with the goats cheese. The latter featured in the pizza as well, also quite nice. The real disappointment for me was dessert. For a specialist Italian restaurant, the tiramisu should have been way better. Something not right about the texture there and not enough of a coffee hit. The chocolate tart was something a CCD could outdo.¬†Maybe part of the problem is you are watching the pastry chefs dish these up lovingly and your expectations are high :) Service was spotty. I feel like there is a lot of pressure on fine dining places like this to get the details right because they have to knock the socks off the customer. It isn't enough to just satisfy.

A tad bit expensive but then  you take the first bite and everything makes sense! The basket of assorted breads masala,plain etc are so good you want to keep munching and that basil butter is just delish! We started wih the asparagus soup with mascarpone .. An acquired taste shall I say.. Followed by the sumptuous  mushroom thin crust pizza ..and then you realise why this place is this place and Dominos is Dominos! Though I love Dominos! The canneloni was cheesiliciously yummy everything u expect it to be! 
The desserts we tried the pistachio icecream , their choco lava cake and tiramisu.
One bite of the pista icecream and we all went "mmmmm" orgasmic bliss shall I say! A must try something you would want to return to . The tiramisu is like a little bit of heaven on plate. Light fluffy and plain yumm . Best tiramisu till date. Dont get tricked into ordering a chocolate dessert just because it is chocolate .. It was passable below par ... Tiramisu and pistachio cannot be missed!
You wanna eat here!!

It is very easy to review this kind of a¬† restaurant. Just PERFECT. Everything tasted so good from amuse-bouche all the way to the desserts. The presentation and service was similar to what you expect of a Michelin star restaurant in London or Paris. 

The price is higher than what you typically expect of India, but such an amazing food and service is probably 3-4 times more expensive in Europe and US. If you appreciate food you have to visit this place. You will carry that tasty memory for the rest of your life. 
Cheers people !!!!!

La Cucina - thy name is perfection. One of the best places to eat italian. I am a big fan of their Ravioli in mixed sauce and the bread basket. Tiramisu also scores high up on my rankings for them. All the best !

Visited this place with friends. Nothing to say about the ambience and the warm staff, it was absolutely amazing. 
Coming to the food, really liked the pesto bread. We ordered cheese balls which were amazing. The 7 cheese pizza was just one of the best I had. 
In the end we had two portions of Tiramasu. It is a must try. Do try it.

La Cucina, it's simply amazing. I had been there with my friends for a dinner, and had an awesome experience. 
Every dish we ordered just one upped the other. Taste wise there's no complaints at all. We had ordered a goat cheese medallion for starters. It was extremely well marinated and left me wanting for more. Coming to the main course we ordered a Gnochhi Alla Norma, a goat cheese pizza, and the 6 cheese pizza. Whilst the immediate taste of the Gnocchi might be a little bland, but there's nothing some oregano, chilli flakes and olive oil can't fix. The thin crust pizzas were also a delight to have. Lastly for dessert, we had ordered a portion of Tiramisu, and it was so irresistible, that we ordered a second serving, despite being full. 
The staff was polite and courteous as well. However at times they took a bit too long to come to our table, despite calling for them. Still, it was hardly something to complain about after tasting the amazing delicacies.

On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being insanely out of the world, I'd give this baby a 12. Yes! That's how amazing they are. The seating arrangement, the candles, the service, the everything - I'm besotted. Their Kalamata Centered Chicken and Salmon wrapped in ham are delights conjured by God himself! Just go go go go go - drink away that intoxicating red wine ;-)

Went for our Anniversary ! With the candle lights, soft ambience and music it is perfect for those special occasions and first dates .
Stuff were super courteous and knowledgeable about the food & wines and the paring.

Wine list is global with collection to satisfy all tastes .

Started off with Minestrone Soup which was excellent and the bread was mind blowing. Probably the best I had in kolkata.

Had Spaghetti Farmer Style and the signature bhetki dish in the main course.

Finished it off with Tiramisu .

All in all a total 5 star experience !!!

The tenderloin steak here is probably the best in Kolkata. Perfectly marinated, cooked just enough to maintain the natural juiciness of the meat, it reminds me of a similar experience at the Capital Grille on Wall Street.¬†

"Italian food can never go wrong" - I heard someone say this at an awesome Italian restaurant in downtown Denver, Colorado. I belive that too. But then again perfect Italian food is pretty hard to get in most of India. In Kolkata we do have several Italian joints but the food is majorly "Kolkata-nized" - that is not a bad thing but what do you do when you have that craving to go all out "Forza Italia"? You go to La Cucina. That is what you do.
Today is my second wedding anniversary and my wife and I wanted to indulge in some Italian magic. She had visited La Cucina before and loved it. But for me this was my first time. This place is amazing - right from the ambience to the decor to the warm attendants. And lots of of good food. We had the sea food appetizer - deep fried prawns, squid and fish. It was fresh and tasty. Then in the main course we had Lasagne Bolognese and Grilled Chicken with Ratatouille. In dessert we had Chocolate Bomb. Everything was just perfect. The aroma, the texture, the taste, the purity - this place has it all.
I am not sure about all Italian food, but with La Cucina, you can never go wrong.
I will be back to La Cucina. Very soon.

Ordered a della casa pizza which came a bit soggy the first time. Wasn't crispy given it was thin crust and didn't feel like fresh out of the oven. But, all this was made up for as the chef personally came for a feedback and replaced it with the one just like it should have been.
The pizza had the authentic Italian taste, not the localized versions they pass off at Dominos.

However, I feel they could do well with more variety in the vegetarian fare.

Also, the waitress attending us was a bit rude. She was patronizing us as if we were out of place. She had the audacity to tell me that it will be strong when I ordered LIT. I will ask if I am in doubt. A star deducted for this. And half a star for the pizza we received the first time around.

I'm so in love with Italian food all the time that whenever I have a chance to grab a grub, I go for it............... The beautiful restaurant of La Cucina has really redefined the tastes of the classics. You might enjoy their improvised dishes of Bekti Crosta Di Sale, Spaghetti Alla Carbonara Di zZcchine and Deep Fried Squid Ring with Shrimp, among many other such varieties. The Pizzas and Insalatas (saldas) and zuppas (soups) are rich with flavors!!!¬†A 4/5, clean treat!

Posted on December 31, 2015.Elegance, decadence and deliciousness has a new address. As I sit down to write my experience at La Cucina at Hyatt Regency, Kolkata, I am reminded of quite a few ‚Äòaha‚Äô moments- an open kitchen with a bigg pizza oven to start with! While the Chicken Roulade and the Tossed mushrooms were rocambolesco (read incredible), we still had to wait for the Parma ham wrapped Salmon, Braised Lamb Shank and the classic Beef Tenderloin and mushroom combination to break us into a delicious rapture of ‚Äòaha‚Äôs!

Very selective menu but consistent. Have been there several times and will continue to. In fact, La Cucina, Waterside Cafe, Baan Thai and Dum Pukth are a few places I refer to and take my clients out very confidently as I know it is bound to be a great experience. And it has never disappointed. La Cucina's caprese with balsamic, asparagus mascapone soup and tenderloin steak with wine jus is heavenly, must try.

I expected so much more from La Cucina. There were a few of us so we could sample a range of items off their menu. The caprese was lovely. The balsamic reduction was such a perfect contrast with that richness of the mozarella. Simple and well done. The frittura was my favourite of the day. So beautifully light with absolutely lovely pieces of fish which were so flaky inside. The saffron mayonnaise went along splendidly with the squids and the fish. It was crisp and a joy to eat. The chicken roulade again was not there. There was too much of the tomato and too little to contrast with in terms of the flavour. It just seemed so repetitive once you had a few spoons of it. The chicken sadly with overdone. Not by much, but you expect higher standards if you pay a certain amount.

The contadina pizza was good. A good marinara base. Solid flavours.¬†

Then it started sort of going south. The tenderloin started that bit. So I asked for a medium well for my friend. I got handed something close to a medium rare. Add to that it was underseasoned and I am not quite sure where they source their meat from, but it was subpar in terms of flavour. Then the salmon wrapped in parma ham. You can't take a fish which is inherently that beautiful and then turn it into mush. That was so disappointing. The saltiness of the ham and the fish was supposed to work. It just did not because of how overcooked that piece of salmon was. The lemon potatoes were fine. I would have preferred a finer mash but that's okay. At least it did not leave me scratching my head.

Then the desserts. The tiramisu was tasty, make no mistake about that. But who plonks a large blob of tiramisu in front of you? At least make your desserts look pretty? Please? It was one large shapeless piece you pick out with a spoon and put it on a plate. Then you dust it with some cocoa. Why would you do that? Then the chocolate ball. It was just silly. Chocolate ball with a scoop of icecream inside and then hot chocolate poured into the plate. It looked impressive but that's about it.

The chocolate fondant was the only really redeeming aspect of the desserts. It was rich and the chocolate oozed out as it should. Thankfully.

Well, at least the place looked really pretty.

A smorgasbord for the senses; this is by far one of my favourite places!! Not only is the food good, the service is impeccable. Steep but worth it for the lush night out. 
Flavours are fresh and just right, not overpowering or Indianised for the local palate. And a place that gets the simple Caprese just the way it should be. Yes I've had some horrors elsewhere! 
Weirdly enough, I've been very lucky with Hyatt as far as desserts are concerned. They'll surprise you with seconds if the first serving wasn't up to par. Give you a free one just because you're having a jolly good time with friends. And bless me, be gifted with massive slices of cake for everyone on the table on your birthday. The tiramisu is a tad heavy though :(

Though Guchhi will always be my favourite Hyatt hangout, this one comes a close second.

Visited this place during Restaurant Week India (RWI) wherein restaurants offer a set three course meal for Rs 900++ per head. Was happy to see that they were offering their full menu from where one could choose the three dishes and not a separate restricted menu which is normally the case for RWI. So no dish was off limits and since we were three in number we could try out a wide range of dishes and I am happy to say that we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. 

Most of the dishes tasted great. Special mention is due to the fried fish platter offered as a starter, the ravioli and the melt in your mouth braised lamb shank. Their pizza is among the best in Kolkata and offers a very very welcome break from the usual Dominos pizza kind of stuff. To top it all off was the mind blowing Tiramisu, which was simply the best Tiramisu that I ever had among the 30 odd restaurants that I tried the dish in; in India as well as Italy. 

The only dish that was somewhat underwhelming was the mushroom, which was a bit bland according to my taste. Also I would have liked to see some pork on the menu as it is such a big part of Italian cuisine.

But that apart, it was one of best Italian meals that I ever had. The d√©cor of the restaurant, with the open air kitchen and wood fired pizza oven is very modern and the service was attentive and warm throughout.¬† Overall a great experience and at these prices, a real steal.

Its not everyday that you walk into Hyatt and have a grand dinner but when its that day u surely walk in with loads of expectations. 

Well so did I with a bunch of foodies! Hyatt served us plenty of food, just plenty. The starters looked beautiful but truthfully not all were that great.. Iv had better calamari in other restaurants but what i almost wouldv missed but didn was the mushroom! It was full of flavours that u want more and more..

The brie cheese went lovely with ratatouille and you will b surprised to know what it is after the film has already portrayed it so beautifully but maybe the chicken needed more juice.. The lamb shank was tender and genuine meat but needed salt, while their signature dish of bekti would definitely require u to acquire a taste for fish. But what blew us off was the pepperoni pizza, it could not have been more yummy!!!! 

At the end of it all, the kitchen made it all so complete with their desserts! The chocolate simply gets u.. Be it the bomb or the melting tart, and since we went Italian for the evening the Tiramisu sealed the deal! 

The experience was wholesome. Literally. But maybe the main course didn really live up to my expectations that much also. But i cant complain coz u clearly made up with the desserts! üòÑ

We went in a group of 4 yesterday using the promotional offer of citibank restaurant week! It was a 3course meal you choose from a preset menu for 1250‚Çπ. In no ways is that a small amount.. But it sounded very attractive as being promoted as a formal dinner in one of the top restaurants of kolkata!! 
Our experience.. If nothing else.. Was REALLY BAD!! Our bad luck we picked a day when during their first dinner rush at 8am, they were out of 1 of the 2 options in the non vegetarian appetisers. After a brief argument they agreed to give us something which wasnt part of the preset menu.. So while the vegetarians ate their appetiser the rest of the food took 45 mins to come.. Then also they got the order mixed up as one thing ordered didn't come only! The Prawn ordered was full of oil and had no flavor! The Other appetiser only arrived when everyone else was ready to order their main course! We were already disappointed and thought maybe it was a mistake coming all the way to a fancy restaurant like La Cucina for a nice sit down formal meal. The main course tasted good surprisingly. Dirty cutlery on the table, dirty plates.. Nothing was cleared unless asked and requested repeatedly.. Even clean plates had to be requested for! We all felt like we had gone to a casual, newly opened restaurant with teething problems! By this time they had probably got used to saying "sorry but that dish is not available" for a menu that was already limited.. But we had also become used to demanding and arguing over every part of our meal and repeatedly calling the manager who did not attend to our problems in the beginning! My husband actually got up and went and spoke to him regarding our experience! After issues over dessert as well, we left with a bitter experience and wondered why would people come to big fancy restaurants like La Cucina and pay a bomb for a meal which frankly can be enjoyed far more in a restaurant like Fire and Ice for half the price and good service! I dont think we would be returning there anytime soon.. Or using the restaurant week offer from citibank!

Took opportunity of the Restaurant Week of India to avail a sumptuous dinner here. Yesterday me and my wife visited the place with high expectation. We had prior reservation and we were seated in a nice comfortable corner. The ambience is nice without going overboard. The open kitchen and the pizza oven was interesting. After seeing so many seasons of Masterchef it was like entering into the masterchef kitchen. 
We were given the special menu for RWI and we ordered Kalamata centered chicken roulade and Deep fried seafood platter. We were first served some fresh bread with blue cheese. The chicken roulade was brilliant. The look of dish was half of the taste. The fried seafood was Ok but the accompanying saffron mayonnaise was amazing. Next for mains we ordered Parma ham wrapped Salmon with mashed lemon potatoes and saut√©ed spinach. The crispyness of the skin, the saltiness of the ham took the dish to a different level. The aromatic mashed potato and the spinach was a nice side. The other main was Brie cheese stuffed grilled chicken with polenta, ratatouille and thyme jus as side. The chicken was supper succulent with the cheese insight. Eating ratatouille was kind of a dream since I saw the movie. And it was amazing tasting with the Polenta. Up to this nothing was going wrong and we were full. But the best was still waiting. For desert we ordered Tiramisu and it was the best tiramisu I had in india. It was really the food of God. The other dessert of chocolate tart was also lip smacking. 
So it was one of the finest Italian food I ever had and the pricing of RWI made it doubly special. Look forward for another visit.

Was expecting a better service. 

Though the food was splendid and the flavors lingered on the palate for quite some time. Perfect place to enjoy Italian cuisine.

We were delighted with complimentary dessert, which was icecream and to our surprise, it was in-house creation.

Hats off to the chefs. A must visit if you love continental cuisine.

It is a beautifully done up place with a great ambience. We called for Della casa pizza and cannelloni. The cannelloni was brilliant, specially the basil sauce it was marinated in. The pizza was ok. It was my birthday, so they gave us a complimentary chocolate mousse cake which was really nice. The service was good too. All in all, a very good experience.

Was expecting a better service. 

Though the food was splendid and the flavors lingered on the palate for quite some time. Perfect place to enjoy Italian cuisine.

We were delighted with complimentary dessert, which was icecream and to our surprise, it was in-house creation.

Hats off to the chefs. A must visit if you love continental cuisine.

It is a beautifully done up place with a great ambience. We called for Della casa pizza and cannelloni. The cannelloni was brilliant, specially the basil sauce it was marinated in. The pizza was ok. It was my birthday, so they gave us a complimentary chocolate mousse cake which was really nice. The service was good too. All in all, a very good experience.

We went to la Cucina celebrating our special day.. I heard its the best Italian joint in kolkata. So we decided to give it a try for  the special dinner date. The ambiance was nice , there was an open kitchen and it had the pizza brick oven in the middle. We ordered Pepperoni pizza and chicken  Augli oli pizza. Both we're very good thin crust pizza. Then we ordered chessy bacon pasta ( malfatta con salsiccia etc etc.. ) it was too filling. For the dessert we ordered one scoop chocolate ice cream , one scoop strawberry vodka ice cream.. Both were in house ice creams.. Nd out of this world in taste.. I also wanted to try the Tiramisu. It was good but the taste was a bit blunt. Overall the food was really good.. Even after the billing i ordered another scoop of the strawberry vodka icecream scoop. I just can get over the sweet~tamarind~vodka~strawberry pulpish flavour.. Lovely!!

If you have tried the sunday brunch at La Piazza in Hyatt Delhi, this place is quite a let down. The charges are more or less same but the spread is just not upto the mark moreover the wine/drink selection is horrible. A fine dining restaurant in Delhi/Mumbai would have ¬†a better offering of wine and drinks than this 5 star hotel restaurant of Kolkata. ¬†Repeated requests to maintain the quality of food and drinks to the management has only fallen on deaf ears!

Zomato has categorized La Cucina in the romantic jonar.. however i find the ambience just soothing for family dining or rather corporate. The oval shaped open kitchen bar Will surely drag your notice. The Italian food which they specializes in.. the pizzas and pastas are made decently.. with pegs of absolute vodka, we savoured the Pizza Pepperoni and the Fetucinne in pesto sauce and loved both. Their homemade icecreams deserves mention!

Well speaking of decor and ambiance This what you expect from a 5 star hotel so full marks in that fonte!
We had ordered variety of food and as the name suggests that it specializes in Italian dishes Hence we went for mozrilla cheese pizza which had a complimentary buffet of salad full of assorted veggies!
We ordered panner tikka and some pastry which had exotic coffee taste!
(cant recall the name) and for the main course I decided to opt for chilli chicken but it came along with plain rice I mean who eats plain rice with CC!! Overall my experience was good and refreshing!

Went there couple of weeks back on my travel to Kolkata. I was staying in Hyatt and hence decided to call few friends to this Italian joint. 6 of us got a cozy place in a corner, they have a see through kitchen and¬†i tend to like this allways. Started with a red wine, we all tried and was ok - i am actually not a wine person and hence could not understand the taste much, my friends seemed to be liking this. We ordered pizzas,¬†two potion of pastas and varieties of breads (complimentary). It was a mix of veg and non vegetarian eaters and hence we ordered accordingly. While food was ok at the end, my limited impression was that the person taking the orders was not attentive - we asked him not to put mushrooms - he put that, we asked him to change our plates, he forgot etc etc. Overall, an ok experience. One great advice if you manage to visit this place - TRY Tiramisu over there - lovely dessert to end your dinner with. Cheers

1. My attendant was good with explaining the dish and accomodating requests
2. Very good pizza and pasta
3. I dont know the name of the basil used, but its not my favorite, and it lacks flavour. I like that sweet basil you get in Spencers. Maybe Hyatt should review their ingredients supply.

they are nice to you and not arrogant like alot of other places. Infact they accommodate ¬†tastes and respect consumer complaints. Food is always quite fresh and tastes good... they do a really good butter and sage sauce( have to pre order) ... and there food is GOOD compared to other crap available in the city. Atleast I can go there and know what is in my food. No trying to hide, pretend its " propriety" etc. Their goats cheese tart( i think of a special menu) was divine... i love their christmas dinner... esp the mulled wine... i love this space. ¬†But yes , they have off days too... and that makes me think, maybe just maybe the food is actually cooked and doesn't come from a factory kitchen?

We availed groupon offer and went to Hyatt's Italian Kitchen. Not to mention, I had high expectations and they were well addressed. Our set menu include -- 1 pizza, 1 pasta, 6 drinks, 2 desserts. I asked the Pasta to come before the pizza. Out of the options given we chose Pesto Pasta and i was happy with what came to our table. Perfect taste of pesto sauce on perfectly cooked pasta and right amount of cheese. Then came along the pizza with toppings of jalapenos, chicken and mushrooms and wallah! amazing pizza it was the base sauce and the cheese made it taste distinctly different than other pizzas i had. thin crust crispy and flavorsome satisfied our taste buds and our appetite both. The desserts had ice cream only and they were good as well. With amazing company and tastefully arranged evening meal , I had a gala time and am looking forward to more treats at La Cucina soon.

This is one of my favourite places for italian food. The restaurant has amazing ambience. It has a very candlelighty feel to it and is the best place for a romantic dinner date provided you are in the mood to splurge. 

The menu is amazing albeit a little limited. The tomato basil soup that they serve is sublime. I am sure people who are not into soups will also love this one. The pizzas are all amazing. Must tries in the pasta section are the gnochhi and ravioli. In fact every dish on the menu is worth trying. Although they dont have an elaborate menu, they serve all the general dishes like spaghetti aop, penne arrabiata, and the like on request. 

The tiramisu that they serve here is the best I have tasted in kolkata.  So next time anyone wants to take that special one out for a romantic dinner,  this is the place to be in.

We ordered pizzas, spaghetti with arabiatta sauce, fettucini with pesto cream sauce and the taste was worth dying for. The staff was very cooperative and the ambience was lavish. We had ice creams and a few drinks of Johnny Walker Black Label. The dining experience was sheer luxury. I look forward to visiting this place more than often.

The staff was courteous as expected out of Hyatt. Drinks we had were Red label n Smirnoff vodka. Pizza was a little bland, so ensure you tell them to make it spicy. Pasta was good. Chocolate ice cream was really nice. Overall had an amazing experience @1199 only.
A must for all couples out there!

A short and curt yet sophisticated evening - located on the 5th floor,with a view, an almost corporate set up with a sparse crowd - complimenting it's Sobre and introvert feel.
Food- with a crunch in hand- was able to 'taste' each item - from the salmons,to the chicken salads,the croutons,fresh lettuce based salad-counter... To the opposite side- few fresh breads basket, the Omnipresent 'Cheese&Nuts' tray,to my delight- veg mushroom quiche - soft and slim and tasty! There were 2 Indians- paneer tikka & the dal-based Fish pakoras (they turned out to be a Bit too hard) 
So a smart and light Eve dining this was - with amounts of a 5star's panache. 
Really courteous and well behaved staff and yes- my regrets - didn't get the chance to try out their lemon cake & walnuts based brownie muffin in the end.. Pujo Awaits na.

Went there for their acrobat pizza buffet special. They have a famous chef from Italy, can't remember the name. The show was brief but nice. The pizza, I started with something with an asparagus cream base and artichoke hearts. Thin crust pizza somewhat dry but the olive oil helped and I enjoyed my pizza. I ordered another with rocket, tomatoes and goat cheese. It was even better. I don't think I have had a better pizza. Wine was a major incentive for me to visit this place and they had a nice one with the buffet. I prefer red and the one they had was a pinot noir and merlot blend. It's a bit pricey but I might go again.

We snagged a meal for two coupon from Groupon for a pizza acrobatics show plus unlimited pizza and drinks for two. My friend and I were a few minutes early, so the nice server told us to wait in the lounge for a minute while they set our table up. He asked for our choice of drink. I chose a Soave because I like light bodied whites, while my partner went with the Soledero Sangiovese, a full bodied red with a suitably dry finish. 

We sat down and ordered our first set of pizza -¬† I chose one with slices of salami, handmade sausage, and mushrooms - fabulous, with a crust which was thin, but not paper-thin and chewy. Asparagus cream, grilled aubergine, thin bits of asparagus and artichoke hearts were what the other pizza was made of. It was nice, but nothing compared to mine. 

For our second pizza, I went for one stuffed with artichoke heart and topped with parma ham and parmesan shavings. The other pizza which I completely ignored was one with pesto, mozzarella and tomatoes, which was apparently very good, according to my partner. Meanwhile, the pizza acrobat, Pasqualino Barbasso came over, introduced himself to us, and we had a lovely chat. He performed exclusively for us, throwing pizza dough up and around, and we ended up chatting and talking about the food. 

He suggested we order a dessert pizza, even though we were both pretty full - and we ordered the tiramisu pizza which was all sort of amazing with a blistering hot crust and a sweet, cold coffee flavored marscapone cream topped with cocoa powder. A lovely way to end the meal. At this point, our time was up, and a lady server sort of shooed us off briskly. I would have given this experience 5/5 if not for that little glitch, but otherwise the meal was fantastic and left no space for any complaints.

Being the first five-star hotel in Salt Lake City, Hyatt Regency creates the feel of a private cocoon away from the complexities of modern living without giving up any of its luxuries. La Cucina include a floor-to-ceiling drinks library, homemade pasta and wood fire pizza, and a private dining space.¬† When the moon hits your eye like a big Pizza, then it's time for Pizzafest! Get set for a dazzling display of pizza acrobatics by Chef Pasqualino Barbassoto, treat your eyes and then your tummy to an array of gastronomical delights at La Cucina - Hyatt Regency. La Cucina is well known for serving its Italian buffet in the Pranzo-style but today Chef Pasqualino Barbasso catch all attraction with his free style acrobatic feats with the dough, to prepare pizza in the most eccentric ways and leave your palate with an unforgettable aftertaste. He dazzles the audience with his live shows featuring free style acrobatic feats with the dough and tease the taste buds with the flavours of authentic pizza from his hometown, Sicily. I wouldn't normally choose to eat in Italian restaurants, chiefly because I don't always have the appetite for Italian -sized portions, but this was a very pleasant surprise. We were eight people so, I ordered four large ‚ÄòLilly‚Äô pizza (pumpkin cream, lobster, shrimp, lemon zest), four large ‚ÄòGrand Fume‚Äô pizza (Stracciatella, smoked salmon, rocket, cherry tomato), four large ‚ÄòSapori di Bosco‚Äô pizza (Tomato, mozzarella, spicy salami, fresh sausage, mushrooms), four large ‚ÄòAsparagus and Salmon‚Äô pizza (Mozzarella, smoked salmon, asparagus, cream cheese), four large ‚ÄòZitto e Mangia‚Äô pizza (Mozzarella, spinach, sausage, smoked cheese), four large ‚ÄòTiarmisu‚Äô pizza & four large ‚ÄòFruit Salad‚Äô pizza. For drinks I opted for Soledoro Rubicone Sangiovese & my friends stuck with Johnnie Walker Black Level. The pizzas were cooked true to brick oven fashion with a thinner, crispy crust and fresh ingredients. The service was a bit slow, understandable with the influx, but the ambiance is good and nobody was in a rush so just sit back and enjoy when it arrives. However as soon as I got stuck into my Lilly pizza - a kind of compromise between the two extremes - I knew I would be back. Delicious combination of lemon zest and the classic shrimp -based dish; the lobster in pumpkin cream just melted in the mouth, the pizza cooked to perfection. Grand Fume brings another surprize, taste of smoked salmon and cherry tomato in soft crispy pizza just amaze me. Sapori di Bosco, Asparagus and Salmon & Zitto e Mangia perfectly matched with my wine and they tastes even better than others I polished them off in no time. Tiarmisu & Fruit Salad both were desserts pizza and both of them entertain my taste buds especially Tiarmisu, its soft vanilla cream with chocolate was just mouth-watering.¬† For final wash-down we choose ‚ÄòGinger Cola Rock Salt‚Äô & ‚ÄòSunrise‚Äô both mocktails were awesome and perfect to end our meal.¬† The pizza feast hosted by Hyatt gives complete value for our money. My special thanks to Chef Pasqualino Barbassoto for making this day memorable for us.

The most magnum opus spread ever seen yet during our today's Italian Sunday Pranzo (Brunch) visit at La Cucina. It's 5 star establishment so one will be spoiled and pampered like anything. Ambiance was class apart.
Once entered the restaurant started with a confusion as my reservation details were not available with them. The brunch offer was sold out. However they manage to get a table for us at a cosy corner full of privacy. While we were waiting for table they were so compassionate to offer mint mojito to help us relax.
I don't remember how many dishes were there but tried to take snaps of as many as possible. To me the pizza was a let down but all others were excellent starting from unlimited mocktails till tempting desserts.
The final bonus was Pizza Acrobat by International Chef Pasqualino Barbasso.
Taking away just .5 mark with an expectation that such reservation goof-ups doesn't happen again. Will recommend to every one reading my review and will surely visit again.

We ate here when staying at the hotel in the month of April 2014, and were most impressed by the quality and presentation of the food. It was very authentic and better than most of the food we have eaten in Italy itself! The waiters were very attentive and we had a very enjoyable evening. Special favorites are the unbeatable garlic bread with capsicum aioli and Rosemary roasted potato wedges for starters, and the homemade ice creams (esp. Orange- Basil and Coffee-Kahlua) are to die for! Pizzas and pretty much everything else are also good.

Great Italian food. We ordered fungi trifolati and chicken alio alio (not in the menu) for starters. Both were just yummy prompting us to go for another round of chicken. Main course included mushroom rivioli (which melted in the mouth), the penne ariabiatta and pizza tasted out of world. Superb service made it a great experience second time around. 
The menu can be spruced up and should include more chicken items and also a range of other risottos.

heavy on the pocket but definitely worth it. the menu though i found a bit limited especially the starters. the homemade ice cream was a big hit though.

The best italian that can be found in Kolkata has to be in this place... everything they serve is with finesse.. wood burn pizzas made in front of you in the open kitchen is another attraction to this place... everything tastes so fresh and great that another visit is guaranteed.... though i would love to i cannot give this place a 5 star for 2 reasons:

1. if you dine the way we do then you dine till late and sit and enjoy yourself... this restaurant has a habit of shutting down their air conditioning and then when you start feeling hot... you complain and they start it up again for some time and again close it down... its really irritating and we have complained of the same tooo many times...

2. have visited this place so many times for dinner but the caprese salad is NEVER available... anyway there are too few places that give this salad but this place is always out of stock to make it... which is really sad

all in all the food is just great and a good time is a must

Beautiful ambiance, awesome food, great reception. These are the first three things that came to my mind while writing about La Cucina in Hyatt. It was my husband‚Äôs birthday and we thought to celebrate the occasion in style. We were expecting a decent reception from the very beginning but what we got exceeded our expectation. It was difficult for us to decide from the menu, so we trusted the waiter to choose for us. And, after the food arrived we realized that we had shown faith in the right person for sure. The chicken pasta in white sauce was mind-blowing and in fact before serving the chef came down to ask about the taste and took our approval about the dish. This was a unique experience and certainly overwhelming. 

Next came the pan seared filetto bhetki and we knew that coming to this restaurant was completely worth it. From the quality of fish to the preparation, it was a fantastic display of culinary skills.  Then came the next dish and we were just bowled out. The slow cooked lamb shanks with lemon and thyme was one of the best mutton dishes I think I ever had. The tender meat along with the magic of spice and the tangy taste of lemon played the trick in creating one of the most sought after dishes on the menu. 

The ambiance needs a special mention. From the lighting to the decor, everything seemed just perfect. The place was not over-crowded and the tables were positioned in such a manner that the guests were assured of their own personal space. The waiters were always attentive and each time any one of us finished our drinks, our glasses were promptly re-filled without being told to do so.

However, I have saved the best for the last like the staff at La Cucina did for us. We had paid the bill and were about to leave when arrived the SURPRISE CAKE with a Happy Birthday written on top. We were clueless as to how these people had found out, and after a lot of speculation I recollected that while booking I had mentioned that it was my husband‚Äôs birthday and the staff were kind enough to remember it. And, instead of a candle there was a stick which burnt almost like a small firework! And, it goes without saying that the cake was as yummy as we expected. This last incident was so special that we will for sure remember it for long. The warmth the staff showed and their initiative in making the day special for us were simply priceless. 

So if you have a special day in your life to celebrate, do visit La Cucina in Hyatt, because as they say there are certain things in life that money surely can‚Äôt buy...

La Cucina for me at present serves the best Italian food in Kolkata . This is one of those places that are perfect to spend a quiet cozy evening with a small intimate group of friends or with your special someone. I usually start my meal with either the Cold Cut Platter which is excellent or the Deep Fried Sea Food Platter with Saffron Mayonnaise which I love.  The Calzone Prosciutto Darjeeling e Verdue is also delicious and makes for a nice change from the usual pizza if your so inclined. Their Ravioli with Crispy Bacon and Parmesan Fondue is sublime as is the Lasagna alla Bolognese. I have also sampled their Roasted Tenderloin and Slow Cooked Lamb Shanks which were both yummy but am so hung up on their Ravioli and Bolognese that I usually end up ordering those.Most of their deserts are great but I love the Coffe and Kahlua Homemade Ice-Cream preferring it over their Tiramisu. This has been a tough review to write because quite honestly am salivating so am gonna try and exert some self control and put a full stop here. ;-)

Italian food has become comfort food in India and every second place serves Pasta. However, getting that al dente spaghetti or that right mushroom cream sauce, fresh focaccia breads is not very easy. 

When I was in Kolkata this time, I felt like eating Italian and wouldn't settle for anything but the best, so we headed to La Cucina at Hyatt. The wine bottles displayed at the entrance makes my heart dance with joy! We reached rather late, around 11:30, but the staff was very courteous to take our orders and serve us with full enthusiasm. 

We started off with a bottle of wine. There was a wine connoisseur with us and he ordered the best wine I have ever had! Along with it, we asked for some specific bread which the chef very gladly made for us, rosemary and garlic focaccia. 

For main course we called for Spaghetti Carbonara and Fusilli pasta in Mushroom sauce. while the Carbonara was the best it could have been, Fusilli lacked the creaminess, something was amiss. We still polished off the whole plate! For desserts we called for Melting Chocolate and Hot Apple Cake. Desserts I would say was average. The portion size was very small, almost like they had to send something on plate so be it whatever! The wine inside us did the work for them, none of us cribbed about the size, we just licked off the chocolate and ice cream.

Staff here is very courteous, very humble and friendly. They kept coming back to us to take our order, gave us 10 reminders for last order, the chef came personally to ask what we wanted and then custom made all the dishes with our requirements!! 

I love this quiet place, nice music, amazing collection of wine, great staff and food is always fresh and brilliant. What else can someone ask for?!

La Cucina the best Italian restaurant in the city.  I have been going to this place since it opened. This place is a 5/5 in all aspects. The reason for me giving a 4.5 is only due to the fluctuating service quality. 
Ambience is elite and gives a true feel of fine dining. 

 Recommendations:- This is a long list...
Complimentary soft breads. You can make a dip yourself using olive oil with little bit of balsamic vinegar and typed with salt oregano and chilly flakes. 
Mushroom soup
Garlic bread
gnocchi in 4 cheese sauce
asparagus risotto
margarita pizza
pastas in all the sauces. 
The Molten mud pie. 

Try the Sunday brunch which is a set menu with unlimited serving of food and alcohol.

The best place for Italian in Kolkata is still La Cucina. Their cheesecake is melt in your mouth and is truly of international standards. Their selection is exquisite and classic. I had my first risotto here and have never been quite as satisfied with anything anywhere else. They have a mushroom antipasti which im a big fan of. They also serve octopus but i havnt been adventurous enough to try it. Their only minus point is actually their plus point. We think of an overdose of cheese when we think Italian but it is not so in reality. It is not so here either. Its great when you're counting the calories also. The decor and ambience is such that it makes you feel special. So when you wait for the food, you end up feeling as if you're waiting for something special.

La Cucina located at Hyatt is one of my fav. restaurants there. Ambience is great, food quality is delectable and staff is friendly. It is one of the best italian restaurants in city. 
The Asparagus Rissoto is well made and also the pastas. The Gnochhi is awesome too. Quantity is appropriate for 2 people. Service is slow. The Arrabiatta Pasata is my most favourie. Tiramisu is good too. 
I would rate 3.5 for LA CUCINA

La Cucina.. which is located in The Hyatt Regency Hotel in E M Bypass in Calcutta.. has to be one of the best Italian fine dining restaurant dining experience for me. Everything here is excellent - be it the top notch service, the blissful ambiance or the divine tasting food. We had the Ravioli in Gorgonzola Sauce, Gnocchi in Arrabbiata sauce, Asparagus Risotto and to finish it off on a sweet note, the Tiramisu. And trust me, there was not a single dish we were not happy. They were all SO good. I would definitely reccomend this to eveyone who likes Authentic Italian Food. We all returned with a huge smile on our face. And everything being so nice, you dont even mind paying the amount they charge. Four and a half stars from me :D

Service is good. Ambiance is awesome. They served really good Italian food. Pasta and Cannelloni was better than Risotto. Food quality is good, they always keep it fresh and serve hot. If you want a complete pleasure of mind, you'll get it with the place. Must visit this place. Its wonderful.
