I have never been here but I have tasted various items from here at my place through swiggy. In 1 word all foods are just "awesome". Non veg garlic rice gives a different taste into my taste buds with the combination of chicken in oyster sauce. Just give a relief to Ur taste bud from the daily food in your life and try varieties of food from this place. Quality with quantity never demotivate you...so near Dumdum station area this is a very nice restaurant with pocket friendly food serves with a mouth watering taste.

Food is so so... And I vl suggest don't order food from here.. coz they don't give the proper delivery... Last week I had ordered 1chili potato, 1 chilli mushroom and 2 pan fried momo... And they served me 1 pan fried momo instead of 2.. and when I called them they said they have no idea about it.. where I had already paid full for it..
M just giving 2.. coz there food was edible...

This place is located opposite to St.Mary's School. And when you are in dum dum road ,you do struggle to find good restaurants in this part of the city.This place serves your needs at a cheap rate. The quality of food served is good and I did not find any hygiene concernes. Do not expect much from the ambiance of this place, but they do have a variety of menu to offer.

Food : 2.5/5
Ambience : 2/5

I went once there just to taste the food. Tasted my all time favourite Chinese!
And I won't say it bad. :)
The only thing I didn't like of this place is : you can't see the outside.
But the best thing is you will get your food in very cheap rate. 😍

রাস্তা দিয়ে যেতে যেতে দাঁত আর হাত নিসপিস করলে এরম জায়গায় আসতে হয় । খুব বেশি খরচের ধাক্কা নেই । খাবারও খারাপ নয় । বসার জায়গাও মিলবে । পরিবেশও খারাপ না ।

A decent option for quick food. One shouldn't expect any high quality or standardized food however, the food here is just okay. The pricing here is pretty much affordable, so that makes up for the food.
