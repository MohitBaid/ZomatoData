This cafe serves good food and also has live music. The best part of this cafe is that you can borrow books while having your favourite dish which kind of makes it to the top of my list.The pocket pinch is a bit high but the food is worth it. The staffs are friendly as well.

A nice,cosy restaurant located in salt lake. A perfect place to spend time with yourself. They serve amazing desserts, though not many varieties. I tried their paneer pizza which was big and was sufficient, it was good. The chicken clear soup was amazing. Bad combination eh? I know I know. But cravings!! The chocolate shake wii ice-cream was good but could have been better. Hot cappuccino was perfectly brewed. The cheesecake and brownie was the best. But if you tell me to choose between the two desserts then clearly the cheesecake is the winner. A must visit place.

The place offers you a pretty, cozy ambience. The music collection is very satisfying to the ear. Coming to the food, it's decent, both in appearance and taste.
They did make a glitch in the bill, but the service and good food made up for it.
The Tiramisu needs special mention!

It was a weird experience here. The manager never admitted the fault of his staff who insulted us giving insulting comment. The commitments made were never fulfilled. Though the booking was done and confirmed thrice they said that we do not remember who took the booking. Devastating staff  ill-mannered behavior and no commitments are served here.

After months of planning, finally visited this cafe. Interiors are excellent. Cafe is spacious. Atmosphere is cool. Area where one side of wall is decked with books is superb. They have quite good collection of books. Staff are good. We ordered :-

1. Garlic Bread with Basil Butter :- Quantity was very good. Garlic bread was crispy and tasty. Eight pieces with tomato sauce.

2. Nutella Infused Coffee :- Coffee with Nutella Infused in it. Something new for me. Was perfect. Accompanied with cookie.

3. Flower Cooler :- Lemon and mint Infused cooler was good.

4. Veg Lasagna :- One of the best lasagna had till date. Pasta sheets were absolutely fabulous. Vegetables were quite properly cooked inside. Must recommend it.

5. Garden Fresh Pizza :-  Middle crust cheese pizza with onions, tomato, olives, green, red and yellow capsicum, pizza was perfect. Much better than usual pizza I had in other cafes

6. Creme Brulee :- Next was dessert time. Creme Brulee was excellent. Taste was excellent.

7. Three layered Mousse :- Had expected this to be better. It was ok. Quantity of caramel was too high.

Overall, the experience was quite good.

I went to this cafe in the early December. We ordered for a cup of Darjeeling Tea and a Pizza. The pizza was better and way more delicious than any other resto of the same class. Once we started having the pizza, it was 8:30 and there was a live band playing retro bollywood numbers. The ambience was phenomenal. In the weekends, there’s live band. There are comfy bean bags to sit and have a gala time. This cafe has also got a small library. If you are into books, this is the place for you. Considering all this, the charges are just nominal.

A very well decorated cafe. An Unique idea to make a cafe with books and board games. 
Perfect place to just sit and talk with your friends and spend some time. 

The service guys in there are very well behaved. They just needs to be a bit proactive. We cannot always call them for each and everything. Even to place an order. You need to attend every customer in a proactive manner. 

Chicken French fires, Cafe Latte and Frappe costed us around Rs 663.

I have tried hookah for the time in Oman. They call it sheesha and they serve with Tea. Terminal 11 did it right! When I have decided to pay a couple of bucks extra to have "chai" not from a stall but from a cafe, I expect to be served that way. Not just be served with hot water and tea bags. Unfortunately all cafes do that. Terminal 11 stands out here. I have attached pic of how they served tea. I loved the touch of strain-it-yourself and a small but tasty home made cookie. Also, their hookah is one of the best I had in Kolkata. The pizza was awesome, so were the garlic bread and chicken wings. I was not expecting such big sizes. Hence, we had ended up ordering so much for just two (LOL). And the price was quite reasonable, something which will always make me want to visit this place. About the ambiance, it is near perfect (I will come to that). You have books for the readers, a quiet zone too. The players can enjoy board games I heard although I did not try that. So why near perfect and why 0.5 deducted? The hookah section needs to be improved a lot. It can feel congested , mostly with all the smoke. It seems all the thought went into the non smoking area. You need to improve that fast as  that part is totally non-terminal 11. It feels like a cheap hookah parlor, totally unlike the library I just mentioned. Please don't let that ruin the amazing place you have created in terminal 11. But all in all, I would still encourage , smokers and non smokers both, do visit!

Live music on Sundays make the ambience realistic.
You have got free lancers section where you can read books, do your work and chill out.
Hot chocolate with Marshmallow is must have (not available in breakfast) 
French fries were prefect and crisp.
Pizzas lacked flavours
Service is slow at times, needs to be improved.
Most of the dishes in the menu are not available which pisses.
Overall a descent place to be.

We visited here on a Saturday afternoon almost a month ago and the place was started getting decorated for Christmas. The ambiance is very warm, cozy and beautiful and bright as well with walls full of book shelf and green cushions. We started with a mojito and a litchi based drink, both of them were unnecessarily chilly and not so tasty also. Next we had chicken lasgna which was only tasty dish of our meal. The baked fish was also flat. Same with the desert, not so good. All the dishes were presented beautifully but the taste needs to be improved. Price is on the higher side and also 10% extra service charge is there.

Went there on a Friday evening to find decently crowded. The fire and ice is just a mind blowing drink - perfect blend of pulpy orange , mango and jalapeño with crushed ice !! Coffee noir was well brewed too. The BBQ chicken pizza was too awesome ! Chicken ceaser wrap was another nice delicacy. The decor with lots of books will win your heart and the Christmas tree added the perfect vibe to the seasonal mood.
They have a hookah room too - the hokaah menu is served only there - and a nice selection of hookah as well.

Price is a bit on the higher side and 10% service charge is applied on the gross (before tax) amount.

Went to this place few days back along with my group of friends and spent a really lovely afternoon at Terminal_11❤️.
The moment we stepped inside there was a huge Christmas tree right in front, giving some actual Christmas vibes🎄🎊❄️.
Must say, this place has a really great ambience along with a pretty & cute decor. For all those who love reading books📚, they have a huge collection of books which along with providing a nice look to the docor also give its customers a chance to pick into any book and read while they get your food ready😍. They've also got board games and some live music to make your visit more fun. 
They have a really comfortable seating and you can also choose to sit on the bean bags which are put in a separate corner😀. The staffs are also very courteous and helpful✌🏻️.
Coming on to the food, they have various kinds of American, Fast Food, Continental and Italian food🍕🍝. 
What all did we order?
For drinks we had, 
-Choco nado
-Chocolate cookie shake
-Chilled lychee blast
-Blue Wave
Main Course:
-American Buffalo Wings which were delicately marinated chicken wings cooked in homemade BBQ sauce.
-Mexican Chicken with Stuffed Bell Pepper where they gave us a roast of pepper stuffed Mexican style rice & chicken, served with Nepolian sauce. 
-Barbeque Chicken Pizza🍕
Barbecue chicken chunks with caramelised onions, olives & cheese with BBQ sauce base. 
Loved the pizza❣
At last for desserts we had,
-Tiramisu 
-Creme Brule
All in all, this place will give you a really good feel and you'll surely love the ambience, food and everything😀❤️.

Food is really good but the rating is because of service and fraudulent charge. We waited for 30 mins without water even after telling them that we want mineral water. I had to go and remind them. Moreover though the mineral water is 65 they charged us 90 which they cannot do. Also even after charging GST they charged 10% service charge which is illegal. On demanding the owners phone number the staff rudely said they cannot contact him.

Now the food we ordered were Cheese chicken fries and Cajun French Fries. Both were of great quantity. Considering we were 7 of us, two appetizers were making us full. 
Would have loved to try more items but we made a plan to have dinner some other place.
Next time definitely will try their main course because looks promising to me! 😉

Went for breakfast with friends. The setting is very comfy with sofa seats, low seats as well as chair setting thrown together with cushions all around. They have a wall which is a bookshelf and they also sell knick knacks like funky/kitschy diaries, mugs, coasters which is quite an eye catcher and adds to the brightness of the cafe. 

Amongst the 3 of us, we ordered tea, hot chocolate, water poached eggs, jacket potatoes with chicken and mushroom and apple pancakes. Everything was quite delicious and sumptuous, and just right for one person - so not to be shared but no complaints there! The hot chocolate is not easy to pull off and I'm not easy to please, but this one was yum. To top it all off, the servers and the owner were very warm and friendly and made us feel welcome and connected to the place, which isn't a feeling very easy to achieve when you're visiting a joint for the first time. Would love to go back there!

Terminal 11 is one of the many new chain of cafes that have recently opened up outlets in our city. Situated on the first avenue of Saltlake near CAP camp island, the spacious joint boasts of a beautiful decorum and an infectious ambience. 
                     They have different sections to cater to the many needs of the foodies...
Are you a bibliophile and/or a recluse? They have got a vast collection of books and boardgames to keep you occupied, while you read on sipping your favourite coffee reclining on the bean bags...
 Are you with your Plus 1? They have got a private setting near the entry ready for you. They even have a hookah section.
We indulged in a modest menu with 2 coffees. American Buffalo Wings (marinated chicken wings cooked in BBQ sauce) impressed us...although not so high on the taste chart, the pieces were spicy and succulent. The Lasagna (layers of pasta   with creamy sauce stuffed with exotic green vegetables ) was served with garlic bread...and was palatable. We went for a hot and cold combo for our coffee treats. Cafe mocha (hot expresso with milk chocolate) was delightful and indeed a "turbo charge to our senses" as advertised. The Choco Frappe (chocolate and ice cream blended with rich coffee) was even better in terms of delectability.
The service is a bit slow. And I would like to detail one thing... they notified us of the 10% service charge only after we placed the order, while according to the rules they should have put up a board clearly displaying any additional charges. 
That being said...I am really looking forward to further visits to this cafe.

Location: Near the CAP Camp bus stoppage in Saltlake. It is absolutely on the side of the road which is heading from the CAP Camp to Baisakhi.

Ambience : Spaceous and crowd was good that time. On 7 O'Clock of the Sunday evening, a live band performance started. So overall it looked nice. Along with their usual offerings, they also have well set of book collection but only for selling purpose.

Food: We had Latte and Mocha, Buffalo Wings, Fried Fish and Chicken with Cheese Fried. Quantity and quality wise everything was satisfactory, apart from the last mentioned item. Though they took little extra time to serve the food to the table, but the service persons were prompt with well gesture.

..... Overall it was a nice visit.

This place has become my recent favourite to eat good food and to unwind with family or friends. Have been here with my family, including my 10month old daughter and also with friends and this place suits both categories perfectly. The menu is quite elaborate, a few more vegetarian options won't hurt though. Have tried most of the vegetarian options on my numerous visits to this place and the fact that i keep going back is enough to talk about the taste of the food. And the ambience of the place is also just what you need with different kinds of seating to suit one's mood. With live music, stand up comedy to a book read or even children's day special event..one is spoilt for choice under one roof. Very happy that such a place has opened up in Salt lake where there is a dearth of good places to even eat, let alone a place that gives you an experience also. So i will definitely keep going here like i already do.

situated on the main road of salt lake , it is easy to locate. the first impression one gets on entering this place is : VIBRANT. with colorful decor, nice seating area and live music, one does feel the place to be in. after settling ourselves in a corner next to book shelves we ordered spinach soup along with french fries as starter. both were tasty and nice. the fries could have been little spicy though. my little son wanted to have banana oreo shake and after being assured by the server that it tastes great, he ordered and indeed the server passed the taste test of my son. the main course was veg cannelloni which too was just as it should be.  the band playing live songs needs little more practise i guess and the speaker location needs to be readjusted. but nevertheless, one can surely book the tickets for this terminal. meal for too would be around 1300.

This cafe is quite spacious and divided into zones. Once you enter your mood is sure to be uplifted by the beautiful ambiance.... books lining the walls. They are for sale also.. There is also a corner selling nick nacks.. Handpainted kettles.. Costers.. Notepads and so on. We saw some bottled juices and ordered one with green apple and fennel and another orange carrot juice.. Both were deliciously refreshing. Then we had the classic fish and chips. Fresh fish in a crispy shell served on a bed of potato chips. It was very tasty.. Then we had grilled fish.. the fish was served on a bed of crispy potato wedges anf served with a cheese sauce on top. The food was very good and inspired us to order take aways... Fish and chips and pesto chkn fettuchini. The staff are well behaved but the price is a bit on the steeper side. We got compimentary cookie jars 😆 One thing they charged 10% service charge plus GST.

Have been to this place thrice and the visit each time was a great one. Being a heart core bookworm the ambience is very warming and soothing. The ambience is breathtaking. The service is nice and quick. The food is quite tasty. We tried caesar salad, spaghetti in meatball sauce, hawaiin style pizza and ginger ale. The price is a bit more than expected. But overall the experience was pretty good!

This place has become my recent favourite to eat good food and to unwind with family or friends. Have been here with my family, including my 10month old daughter and also with friends and this place suits both categories perfectly. The menu is quite elaborate, a few more vegetarian options won't hurt though. Have tried most of the vegetarian options on my numerous visits to this place and the fact that i keep going back is enough to talk about the taste of the food. And the ambience of the place is also just what you need with different kinds of seating to suit one's mood. With live music, stand up comedy to a book read or even children's day special event..one is spoilt for choice under one roof. Very happy that such a place has opened up in Salt lake where there is a dearth of good places to even eat, let alone a place that gives you an experience also. So i will definitely keep going here like i already do.

This cafe cum restaurant is situated at Sector I in Salt Lake just beside the HDFC Bank. The ambiance and decor of the place is truly amazing and as soon as one enters the place the mood and feel is automatically uplifted. Food is excellent both in terms of quality and quantity. A unique thing about the place is that it has got a huge collection of story books which can keep one engrossed and occupied when visited without company. There is a separate place for serving hookah which drastically needs improvement. We had planned for hookah only but seeing the condition of that particular area we changed our minds as to be honest the area where hookah is served seemed to be a misfit in the otherwise wonderful place. Pricing is a bit expensive which can be understood. Overall a must visit place.

Firstly the decor is too good.. a very differently themed restaurant.. there are many different kinds of seating arrangements from normal chair tables to bean bags..

Secondly the food is very very tasty...
● chicken lasagna- which was cooked well... the chicken the cheese the pasta and the sauce all were on point.. all over great taste.. and quantity was enough for 2...
●macaroni and cheese with bacon- damn another cheesy dish... perfectly cooked.. with lots and lots of cheese...it is a great dish for cheese lovers like us...

Overall a great restaurant to hangout...
But a bit costly compared to other cafes...
But food is worth the money...

Oh. 
I loved this place.
It's a Haven for those who just like their coffee in between books and good music.
Terminal is the best recluse to escape from your boring life, sip a little Irish Coffee, have some cookies and browse their collection of books.
What I loved - 
1. Staff was very sweet and courteous.
2. The Garden fresh pizza was delicious, though not the best. The taste was not smooth, though the vegetables were fresh and the crust remained crunchy till the end of the entire pizza.
3. Ambience. Books, lighting, seating arrangement, music, wallpapers, its got everything. You want a casual cafe sitting, sure. You want a haughty high chairs, there you go, you want to sit on the floor? we got you fam.
4. Coffee. The Irish coffee was exquisite to the last sip. The cream, the spike and the coffee have never felt so good on your soul before and even their chocolate cappucino and latte were different and better than what we have had before.

The only thing that i would like them to change would be their open timings. Please be open till 1 or at least till 12. I would request you to be open till 3 as there are lost souls like me who would like to spend some time at your place late at night when the world sleeps.

From ambience, to service, or food,there's absolutely nothing to complain about!
We ordered cream of chicken soup, grilled chicken steak, lasagna, French fries, washed down with some appletini. Apple crumble pie and Tiramisu made for great dessert options too. Not to mention,there's live music too!
Highly recommended!

My 1st experience here was with ny friend who is a non vegetarian and he ordered engish breakfast about which he told me is really good and me being a vegetarian and my personal favourite is pizza, I can visit this place again and again for the garden fresh pizza. Even their cannolini was amazing. Ambience is great . Fun to hangout with friends and family. What adds on is their board games. You can really have a gala time sitting,muching and playing board games with your loved ones.

1. The decor was pretty. Really pretty. Went there to fill the stomach and chat, so haven't checked out the books section, but the presence of books made the surroundings look cozy.

2. The service was great. Took around 20 mins or so for food to arrive.

3. Food was AMAZING. I'm a big fan of healthy eating, and it was great to see many items on their menu which were "cheat" worthy, but not extraordinarily unhealthy. We had chicken caesar wrap with guacamole. My friend tried to order ONE garlic toast, but they gave us a whole plate, but my friend loves garlic toast so it wasn't much of a problem. I loved the fact that they gave so many "leaves" with the wrap. I love salad-y stuff.

4. The price was a little on the higher side, though I guess that comes with exotic food. Still, a service charge of 10% is a little too much for students (being near a University, I imagine many students visit), and makes the place a very occassional hangout destination.

Overall, loved it. Might visit once every couple of months.

You can find a wall shelf filled with books, some are for sale, which makes it a booklover's paradise. There is a separate section for hookah.

I had reserved my review as my first experience was sort of okay as the english breakfast my friend had was amazing, but my chocolate waffles were rock hard, more like biscuits.
The ambience is beautiful but my experience has not been worthwhile.
First, the staff is slow. They also asked us to leave our seats at the bean bags to accommodate a larger group, never faced that before in any restaurant or cafe before. Not cool.
Second, the biscuit like waffles were pathetic, mocha was okay but not hot. Mac and cheese lacked taste, but the cheese content was good.
Not a cherished couple of visits. Most definitely not going back there again. Sad, it did not turn out to be as good as the ambience due to the less than decent staff.

Terminal 11, though a bit hard to find, but once found is an absolute jewel. We found the cafe through their #ExchangeBookForCoffee event.

The place is not only beautiful but serves some really tasty dishes. 

They have board games, books, and even at times live music. So, there is no way, one can get bored there.

We had coffee and a platter of cookies, before filling our tummies with some tasty sandwich and chicken wings.

The cookies when served were light and crispy and had a lovely buttery taste, that made my friend go gaga over them.

The Triple Decker Chicken Club Sandwich came with potato wedges and ketchup. 

Though I personally loved the American Buffalo Wings because it was not only spicy and greasy but also the chicken was really succulent and juicy. The plate contains 6 pieces, which is enough for 2 people.

I would like to visit Terminal 11 again very soon, and I recommend you visit it too.

One of the best cafes in Kolkata hands down. This would have been a five pointer but a point dropped due to a food hygiene issue which were reported and they compensated with a dessert as well. But I believe they will take care of it. Overall a cafe with variety books, a life stage, plenty of board games options and legendary musics and a cosy ambience with bean bags a stuff infuses the place. The food was awesome and quantity and quality was quite apt based on pricing. The staff was very amicable and service was prompt. Overall a terrific place to hangout alone if you are a bibliophile or in a group of friends. Very highly recommended.

The food here is pretty good. We ordered the mexican pizza with generous amount of toppings on a tortilla. Their caramelised onion and feta cheese sandwich is stellar! it comes accompanied by potato wedges and a coleslaw. 
We did meet a small disappointment though, they sell something called a "vegan delight" which is a cold coffee. But it is just another one of those places that use the term vegan without knowing it's meaning. they use whipped cream with espresso. 
But a great place to chill, they have  live music over the weekends and freelancers can work throughout the day by availing some sort of their monthly subscription.

I hate that they mandatorily charge 10% as service charge, because their food is to die for. I had taken my brother to lunch there, we ordered buffalo chicken wings and penne pasta in chicken white sauce, and that was probably the best pasta I've ever had. The wings were very tasty and well, quite big and the 2 of us couldn't finish 6 pieces in all :) So it's expensive, but the way their food tastes does kinda make it worth it.However, about that service charge, I wasn't very happy about it especially since we got no service except for the waiters just got our food to the table. Atleast, they could have asked whether they should serve it! We had to ask for water refills as well. That was rather disappointing.The ambience is a very casual, cafe-ish, you'll find yourself surrounded by books. There are some high chairs, some sofas, some seats. That was a nice experience as well.

My favourite cafe dissapointed me today ! Our breakfast went bad due to power cut. Surprisingly, the high-end cafe did not have a power backup. We had to cancel our remaining orders.

Interestingly, Terminal 11 charged me 18% GST even after having a cup of coffee in darkness and without AC. The poor staff did not have an answer.

This is poor service and a bad experience. How did you charge 18% GST?

A fortnight ago we had gone for dinner at #Terminal 11, a renowned restaurant in Salt Lake city. We were four people and ordered pizza and other stuffs. At the time of checking out I noticed that they had charged 10% as service charge on the gross bill amount. On being enquired they informed us, that is the standard billing procedure they are maintaining since their opening. Being a Chartered Accountant I do have some idea of Taxation and Other allied Laws so I had shown them a notification (obviously after googling) issued by Ministry of Consumer Affairs which clearly states that the service charge portion in the bill should be left blank and the consumer will decide whether or not and how much he or she will pay . To put it simply, its a discretion of the consumer to pay it or not. But they were arguing and telling that they would not waive it and that notification is wrong. On raising the voice again and again the Manager in charge waived our service charge but stated@ categorically that from next time onwards we must be prepared to pay the service charge. And he also challenged us that they will continue doing it and we don't have any power to stop that illegal practice. Now as a fellow foodie my question to all of you is do we allow them to charge us inappropriately? Do they have the power to override Govt. notifications? If the answer is 'No', then raise the voice against such illegal practice.

While they started off really well, they seemed to have lost their way lately. They used to have board games which they have removed. While the hookkah they make is very strong and they make it very nicely, the place where one can have it is too cornered and that becomes a big turn off. I suggest you bring back the board games, plan the performances in a better way and change the interiors of the hookkah area, making it a glass wall structure so that people can see the performances and with speakers set up, they will be able to enjoy it as well, without hampering the non-smoking area environment.

The restaurant is set up in café-style with a cozy décor. The electric green lights give a soothing effect. One can opt for the sofa, the chairs or the bean bags to relax with the delicious food. The music played in the background is soft and relaxing, mostly retro western songs and the country classics which complement the atmosphere of the place. Live musical performances are organized in the weekends or sometimes on the weekdays also. The café has interesting board games on the shelves which can be of great amusement for a bunch of friends or kids.

It’s a lovely place to catch up with friends. A solo visit to the café is also amazing as one can never get bored with all the books and magazines around kept for the readers. The café has also a separate zone for hookah lovers.

The food here is not so spicy however ‘cheese’ is the dominating ingredient in majority of the dishes along with herbs like oregano, thyme, rosemary etc. It’s a paradise for those who love Mexican, Italian and Continental cuisines. Some of the lip smacking items I recommend are -

i)	Cream of chicken soup with just the right blend of cream and shredded chicken served with a slice of garlic bread. 

ii)	Chicken cheese/veg cheese sandwiches served with coleslaw and potato wedges. 

iii)	Chicken Quesadillas – chicken filling wrapped in tortilla bread, grilled to perfection and served with homemade salsa. 

iv)	Stuffed chicken breasts with a dash of mashed potatoes and sorted vegetables on side. 

v)	Chicken/veg penne pasta with alfredo sauce

vi)	Chicken Lasagna – well can’t describe about it just never tasted something so lovely.  

vii)	Smoothies and cold coffee – Cold rush, café toffee Choco nado are some of the best.

viii)	Refreshers – Blue Wave, Green Apple Fizz and Lychee blast 

ix)	Desserts – Crème brulee

The service staff is friendly and serves your food in just couple of minutes. Given the ambience, comfort and the delicious food served, the price is perfectly reasonable and affordable. 

When you check, they give you mints in a cute little steel box with drawing and poem on it. And that is really eye catching! 
Everything about the place is wonderful and it is definitely one of the best restaurants in Kolkata worth visiting over and over again.

This place is my all time favourite. Its interior, seating arrangement, books all things makes me more attractive. 

We went for a girl's hangout. Coming to food, we ordered Chicken and cheese fries and American Buffalo Wings as starters and mango pana, hot chocklet and Virgin_Fire Ice as Refreshers. Must recommend Virgin_Fire Ice, its seriou@sly yammy.  

For the pizza, i have ordered Garden Fresh Pizza and Grilled Fish as Main course. Grilled Fish one is enough for 2people, so we ordered 2plates grilled fish.🦈. Overall all those are very good. The hookah zone is fully different. Overall this place is complete relaxation place with good food, music and ambience. Must try.

A little different kind of food joint providing warm ambience and good service.
We had chicken lasagna, margarita pizza and a tiramisu.
It was sufficient for three of us.
Everything was supper tasty and worth the prize.
Live performance is  an occasional thing in this cafe.

This is one of the newly opened cafe in Saltlake of recent times. Well built, nice interior and good place to chill out with friends. Seating arrangements of all kind is available from chairs & table, couches, seperate section for hookah lovers, etc which makes it convenient for us and thus don't have to face high waiting time.

Since we were running short of time so couldn't try much. Lasagna Veg., Choco Frappe is what we ordered. Serving time was normal. Both were good.
One quantity of this Italian dish can easily feed two people.

Choco Frappe you get served with Vanilla Icecream.

Pros - Environment, Interior, staff, Food.
Cons - Service charge added to your bill, Little expensive if you're more concerned about budget than quality.

Good luck !!

The place is quite good, I ordered a cilantro chicken which was the best I have tasted , with a pasta which was too saucy. The place is mainly good for Brunch as the breakfast menu is quite small, the coffee is ok type. The service is good and the ambience too is quite fabulous.

The last two visits to Terminal 11 were great which made me come for a third time. The last two times we ordered the Pesto cream chicken pasta and the Alfredo pasta which were great. But this time, the food was disappointing. 
We ordered the Cheese and Chicken Fries, which is something very hard to mess up but the chicken was dry, the fries were not crispy and the cheese on top was negligible. We were expecting cheese sauce drenched fries and juicy chicken. But it tasted nothing like cheese. 
We also ordered the créme brûlée which was nothing like a créme brûlée but in fact like a harder soufflé. The crust was caramelised and not bad but the rest of it was difficult to put down. 
Now the drinks we ordered were amazing. We got a Nutella infused coffee and a salted caramel milkshake. Both of them were quite good and the coffee cane with a cookie. 
The service is great but they don’t have board games on weekends because they have live acts, which was also a disappointment. 
Really want to come back for the breakfast menu which is served till 12, and the lunch, hoping they would be better next time

We ordered a margarita pizza and mixed sauce pasta. The staff was not at all interested in attending the customers. They were least interested in taking orders. The mineral water they serve in himalayan bottle is fake, they themselves add some filtered water in the bottle and serve it as a new bottle. The pasta was really tasty but the pizza was horrible. It was not at all baked properly and when they were told to bake it properly they said they will do so but the pizza will get burned and thin crust pizza according to them is “not crispy”. Pizza was a total waste whereas the pasta was really good.  Would not prefer wasting money on such place again.

Not the kind of experience I was looking for.. Poor service from the staff.. After ordering the Buffalo wings they told me after twenty minutes that the preparation time is too long so please change your order.. so basically they didn't want to prepare it .. if they had told me that twenty minutes earlier I wouldn't have had to wait an extra twenty minutes to order a plate of chicken and cheese fries.. Moreover the chocolate mousse was more milkmaid than mousse.. I big fat layer of milkmaid in the centre to just fill up the cup of mousse.. the rosemary chicken roast was okay.. not at all what Any food lovers would like.. overall I do think think the place deserves the rating that it has got... Disappointed..

Been here quite a few times and it's always been very good in terms of quality and service. My recent visit was about a week back with my friend when we had ordered for Bangers and Mash, 2 Tiramisus, and an Irish coffee and Cold choco smoothie. The Bangers and Mash was quite great in taste as I had it for the first time. Rest of the items were great. The Irish coffee has always been one of my favorites, and the one they make here is one of the best I've had.
Overall, it's always great to hangout at Terminal 11.

They charge a mandatory service charge of 10% on food served which is actually illegal as per govt rules.When we said this and convinced them that they cannot charge like this,the rude behavior they made was just unbelievable.This service charge was no where mentioned even in menu card.they just showed us later that they have given a notice outside shop which I attached.
Very unprofessional behavior by its staffs. Though the food n evironment is good..this bad practices of business must not be tollerated. Would request youball to raise voice against it.

This was my first visit to this place with friends. It was a bad experience. I cannot rate it in terms of food, ambience as I didnot have opportunity to enjoy them. 
While ordering the foods the waiter told us that they charge 10% extra as service charge n its mandate. We were utterly surprise, as nowadays service charge has either become obsolete or its optional. Nobody can tell that you have to pay service charge, where u are taking all GST. We asked for manager to speak with but noone came after waiting for 15 mins. We just walked out. Hence, thumbs down for this place.

I would have given then a negative rating if i could! Horrendous food! I haven't had worse chicken wings than theirs! The chicken wings were stale and smelling! To cover up, they had put the entire bottle of vinegar and salt in it! It was absolutely salty and had no other taste to it! The chicken wings which is supposed to be dry and sticky had turned into some messy gooey disgusting chicken! It tasted like stale 'mangsher jhol'!  Couldn't even have one piece of it! On asking to change it, they got me the same chicken  wings with some more sauces added to it! I just had to leave that place with disgust! I really am not coming back to this place again...for sure! Moreover...they also charge service charge of 10%! * god knows for what*

Went there tonight with no idea that there's gonna be a live stage. Kudos to Moksha Kolkata for the amazing performance. And thanks to Terminal 11 for arranging that.

As for the food, had Greek Salad and Irish Coffee. The salad was delicious, coffee was okay. Also cozy atmosphere, friendly staff etc etc. You know the drill. A really nice little cafe to just be on your own, with a good book by your side. And did I mention the live stage?!

Gonna revisit real soon!

LOCATION: It is situated on one of the main roads in saltlake. It is quite easy to locate with its big & bright hoarding announcement that coffee is being brewed here.
AMBIENCE: It is done is shades of eclectic green & black. There are huge bean bags on one side oozing out a comfortable weekend vibe while a Dias on the middle announces the list of the bands playing in the given week. A wall to wall bookshelf stocked with quite a good selection of books is available for both rent & sale. Old gramophone records, love locks gives the place a very breezy laid out feel.
SERVICE: This is mostly a one man army with a single server running hither tither to manage all the orders single handedly. Thus the speed is really really slow.
MENU: The breakfast menu doesn't have much choices but has varied selections of teas & coffees.
FOOD: The chicken bruschetta was wholesome & tasty though a little too high on salt. The Spanish omelette was okayish but could have been better with more varied no of vegetables in it. The toast was simple & crispy. The choco sin waffles were a bit soggy & was served cold rather than piping hot. The cafe Mocha was good & creamy .

This place is an all time favourite. The lovely interiors and seating make it all the more attractive. To add on that the live music on weekends is another special attraction. This place is ideal even if u want to go alone and spend some good time.

Coming to food, almost all of their dishes are great and you can try according to your choice.
I have tried their Lasagna, Spaghetti and meat balls, Caesar salad, Misone, Ginger ale and many more and never had any complaints with any of them. This place is a complete relaxant if you love food,drinks,music and books!

Whereas if you like novels and coffee with snacks it's the best place in Kolkata to be at!! They have a big collection of novels, you can even buy the book if you want to!

Located near the CAP island in Saltlake, this place is fab! 

Decor- spacious place, with a simple colourful Decor, book racks and board games ( not available on Saturday and  sunday) along with live music, it definitely is great spending time here. 

Food- Writing the collective review of my visits, 
I have tried White sauce penne pasta here and veg pesto penne (which I personally loved) . The Garlic bread is super delicious. I already miss it. 
For the pizza I have always ordered the Garden Fresh pizza all the 3 times coz in the vegetarian menu, it seems the best. 

Drinks- The cold coffee is great just like how coffee should be. I have also tried the Virgin Fire and ice which is a mango based drink, along with Mint coolers . Overall they are good. 

Dessert- Tried only 1 here- 3 layer mousse which is heaven for your taste buds!! So many yummy points!!! 

Overall great experience.

I had been waiting to write the review for many days, but never got the time. Finally, I have enough time to devote to this cafe's review. An ordinary review of such a cafe would be nothing short of blasphemy on my end.
Terminal 11 in the very true sense, I suppose is the only cafe in Kolkata. Be it ambience, food, service, crowd, or anything for that matter. 
I went there last Thursday, wherein they had organised a book festival. The bookshelf's are filled with timeless books, all being offered at rates cheaper than online websites. I don't think it was ever their intention to make money out these book sales. The smell of these pages while you wait for your food to arrive, is tantalizing. It seemed to engross me. 
I saw there was a gathering of ladies who were enjoying their kitty party, and a couple was sitting right next to them. What really impressed me was that neither of the people were even asked to order throughout the time I was sitting there. 
The cafe manager politely came and told us that they have board games if we wanted to have some gala time. And we surely did.
The cafe also boasts of a separate room for hookah lovers. The ventilation is very good as the odour DOES NOT creep into the non hookah zone. 
We ordered lasagna, and the servers ensured that it was served only when the same was called for. They were in no hurry to buzz us off the place, despite the cafe being almost full of customers. 
The food was hot. The cheese used was not sticky, unlike what we have been used to! Every ingredients retained it's original flavour, and it was mesmerizing to eat such well prepared "meal".
Please do visit for a experience.

Superb place. The food quality is absolutely awesome. Especially the broccoli and cheese omelette, grilled sandwiches, cheese sandwiches and almost any other thing that you order. I liked the restaurant especially because it has live performances every week, by some superb performers (I didn't get the chance to be at one such performance), the board games, the books, the music, all together combines to make it a wonderful place to be with friends. Coffee was a little behind the mark, but yeah you can deal with it. 
We had a great time here, I'm sure you'll have too.

I have been thinking of trying this place and did one evening. 

Ambience is interesting, has a homely feel.

Staff is prompt... they probably outnumber the number of tables.

Now the food. it is just ok... However extremely overpriced. 

The cappuccino was good, liked the art. 

Soup was fine...garlic bread was half a regular sandwich bread slice with a garlicy topic like what we do for kids at home..I guess this should have been the regular garlic bread Loaf we get in pizza hut or in restaurants..

Now the real disappointment was the chicken quesadilla. It was tasteless. The salsa was a holy tomato mess..Nothing like the advertised home made fresh salsa.

Overall an okish visit but will probably not do a revisit on current offering.... Too many options at way better value for money for this genre of food and taste.

10% service charge as well in the bill...

This place features in 'One of the few places to hang around' in Kolkata, and it truly is. Been there with my cousins two weeks back. An unique combination of flamboyance and great exhilaration and the live band performance is just like a cherry on top.The food is palatable and the prices are economical owing to the fact that the place has so much to offer.
The ambience is eye-catching and it is situated on the main road of the first avenue. The decor too of this place is quite innovative.
We had ordered Cafe Toffee, Chocolate Shake and Stuffed Chicken Breast Misone, and each of it has delicious.

Scrolling through the list of restaurants open around Salt Lake, Terminal 11 caught my eyes. I heard much raves about this cafe from many of my friends and this time I wanted to give it a try.

Honestly, I loved the food but ambience and decor stole the show for me. Its a heaven for any book or music lover. Surrounded with stacks of novels, soft music by two wonderful musicians, bean bags to relax with lovely food - I loved it all.

Me, along with my hubby ordered for grilled fish on bed of potato wedges, mexican chicken pizza, choco-nado and cafe frappe. To do justice to my sweet tooth, I couldn't resist ordering a Creme Brulee. The food was awesome.

Loved the whole experience and would love to visit again.

Just one thing I couldn't agree upon. They have a mandatory service charge of 10% levied which I didn't find to be acceptable. Service charge should be according to customer preference and not something to be forcefully levied.

Other than this 10 on 10 for Terminal 11.

Cool place with good ambience. Food is good with nice service gesture. Hookah was ok. Located in midst of sector 1 salt lake, the place is easy to find with good spacing and proper interiors. Music is not even in all corners and menu has limited but chosen items. Mineral water if charged more than MRP then it should not be taxed again, it's a common rule now that bottled water should not be charged above MRP. People do not know and are taken advantage

It is located opposite police housing complex at saltlake sector 1 nearby Bikash bhavan. Great interior, good music, with books to read and some for buying, good place for hangout. Staff were cordial and helpful, service was quick. Coming to the food, we found the pizza average, better quality can be found some others places. We liked spaghetti with meatballs, meatball size was big. Price wise a little higher side and they charge extra 10% service charge which is disappointing.

When eating out, food isnt the only thing that puts a smile on your face, does it? Visited the place last week, and the food was pretty good. Tried one of the sandwitches, brownie, coffee. What really pissed me off was the fact that apart from gst, they were charging us with service charge as well. On bringing this to their notice, instead of acknowledging their mistake, they kept arguing. Eventually, they did waive it off, but not before ruining the overall experience. To add to it, they charged us more for the cappuccino than what was mentioned in the manu card. When we brought this to their notice, what they said was ridiculous. The rates have changed and the new menu card hasnt been printed yet. They didnt care to say this when we ordered for the cappuccino. The ambience is good, but these small glitches really disappointed us and we arent going back there.

Wonderful place. Must visit for a casual and relaxed meal. The ambience and decor is lovely, the photos don't lie as it is really a pretty little place. They have a huge collection of books, some for sale and some for reading. So you can plan to spend more time here than just for the meal. Coming to the food, we totally loved it! Tried the chicken cheese sandwich, stuffed chicken and hot chocolate - all were amazing in quality and satisfactory in quantity. 
They seem to have an area for live music too, the place must be abuzz during any performances.

I'm ever so disappointed to see that a cafe of this repute would go down to this point. While paying up my bill today, I noticed an extra 10% service charge (apart from the 18% GST) was levied on my gross. While being questioned, I got a reply that said it was "service charge" and therefore I was liable to pay it. 
As per guidelines, I understand that charging extra "charges" without the customer's consent counts for malpractice. Very disappointed.

Terminal 11 is one of the new genre of eateries now cropping up all over Kolkata, the so called 'Reader's cafés', where one can spend some quiet time with a book over a cup of coffee or can hangout with friends. They also tend to offer a much wider variety of food compared to what is available at cafés of those large café chains. They have become quite a hit with the young hip crowd and I consider them to be a very welcome addition to the Kolkata food scene. This particular café is quite spacious and the décor modern. Of course there is a good collection of books. While I was there on one rainy afternoon, soft music was playing in the background. I learned that they organize live musical performances in the evenings. The beer batter fried fish and the cappuccino that I tried both tasted decent. But I felt that the food is significantly overpriced compared to similar places elsewhere. The bill for only those two items came out to be over Rs 800 including taxes. This is absolutely not pocket friendly, especially considering that those pockets mostly belong to the young crowd and so are not expected to be flush with cash.

Visited this place for quenching a desert craving one evening. At salt lake and quite easy to locate. The decor of the cafe is beautiful done in hues of greens and blues. There is a wide variety of dishes you may choose from. We, however, ordered some desserts. We ordered a cheese cake and a chocolate tart. The cheese cake tasted the way cheese cakes do. Thats nothing extraordinary. It was nice and simple. The tart however was not satisfactory and too chocolaty which will distaste your mouth. The pinch of pocket is unnecessarily high viz.a.viz the food. The two costed 320 bucks. Apart from the GST they added 10% on the gross amount as service charge which they shouldn't. Anybody would be fooled and pay the extra 32Rs. When asked they told that we may give if we wish. Be careful if you visit. Don't pay that extra charge. Its not legitimate.

A really nice place to hangout.Has a very nice ambience.The decor is beautiful.They often organise a number of events which are quite fun and innovative.Although a bit on the expensive side,the service,the food and the ambience makes up for it.The proportions are also quite ample.

I'm ever so disappointed to see that a cafe of this repute would go down to this point. While paying up my bill today, I noticed an extra 10% service charge (apart from the 18% GST) was levied on my gross. While being questioned, I got a reply that said it was "service charge" and therefore I was liable to pay it. 
As per guidelines, I understand that charging extra "charges" without the customer's consent counts for malpractice. Very disappointed.

The food is priced rather steeply...but its a "super-cool" place to hang out in...specially if you want to talk for a while....I've been about four times...partly because this is walking distance from my place and partly because everytime I'm here the musical lineup keeps changing!  I've heard carols, sufi-inspired fusion and bright young people playing here. Its the warm, welcoming interior that draws people in...despite there being loads of really cheap options all around.

They did not even let us seat at a place we wanted to. They kept saying it's booked. We were there for 2 hours and no one appeared to come and take the particular seat.
Simple strategic Frappe which is the same everywhere. Didn't feel like ordering anything cz wherever we went they kept chanting the same hymn that it's booked.
Not gonna visit again. Felt good coz of my companions.
Rest u people suck I say.

Went some time in june.. Awesome ambience.. the interior design and decoration kicked me up.. the staffs were comfortable..
Ordered macaroni and cheese, cream of asparagus, expresso and a cold coffee.. the macaroni and cheese felt good and lite.. the cream of asparagus was creamy indeed and soothing.. tasted great..  the expresso did gave a good kick even after having myself accustomed to caffeine for a long time.. so i would recomend for for those who dont have a habit of caffeine, not to take expresso in evening.. I forgot which cold coffee it was but it did tasted good..

Price was as expected.. not pocket friendly for everyone.. but if you can afford such places then do visit Terminal 11..

Garlic bread with cheese was cheesilicious.
Tiramisu was also perfect.
Ambience was soothing.
Service was excellent.
Staff people were great.
Each and everything was perfect.
Must visit.
The only negative point was after implementation of GST @ 18% , they charged additional SERVICE CHARGE @ 10% which was not justified.
I didn't check at the time of payment but I saw it after some time.
I'm hereby tagging that bill and will move to department for further actions against extra 10% service charge.

Ordered Cafe Machiato, Blue Wave , American Buffalo Wings and Chicken Spicy Cajun Rice . 
Cafe Machiato and Blue Wave was nicely made..and the taste were good . 
Buffalo Wings was the best dish I had after a long time , chicken was Crispy yet juicy and spicy ..loved it !!
Cajun Rice dissapointed us, I don't know whether it  should be like that or not, but we couldn't take the flavour and taste ..
Ambience is nice and cozy , you can read books and play games  ..there are many options.
Service was fine , staffs were courteous polite and helpful.
Though it's a highly priced cafe ,still I would love to visit it again..

Please beware of the fact that they add service charge on the bill , on top of the GST which is NOT mandatory for  consumers to pay.  I was not aware of this fact till a few days back. So we didnot pay the 10% service charge and asked them to round it off to the nearest figure. I have the bill with me and on returning back I noticed they charged Rs 80  for a bottle of water whose MRP was Rs 60 and again no restaurants, airports or hotels can charge you more than  the MRP of bottled water. As consumers its important that we are aware of our rights.We obviously had missed this  small detail. I have been trying to get in touch with them over phone to seek a clarification but no one is responding.  However, no complaints about food. I have visited this place quite a few times before and quite love their food and ambience.

Good cafe like interiors..with books.. food ordered was Chicken Lasagne, Spaghetti in Alfredo Sauce Brownies.. All seemed perfect.. Decor..Food..Staff...
Untill.. We found a feather in the Lasagne.. The staff just acknowledged and apologised.. When the manager was call for , he refused to accept it .. claiming it to be garlic shell.. Disappointing.. Though he reluctantly asked if the dish was to be changed..we refused as we were almost done with our course..
A more professional and courteous behaviour is expected from the manager.
Food( except the unwanted add-on) is 4/5
Service : nothing exceptional..but the manager and team need to understand how to deal if a mistake has been committed. 1/5

Went to Terminal 11 during a book sale and decided to go inside and try its shakes in the scorching heat with a friend. Tried the caramel hazelnut milkshake. It was totally amazing. The pie of the day that day was a lemon tart which was a big turn off. Never trying that again.
Really liked the well-lit ambience and the courteousness of the staff. Big thumbs up!

Terminal 11 hold a huge lot of memories for me. I've had amazing times here. It's one of the best spots to hangout in Kolkata. With pretty interiors and cozy vibe with a huge collection of books, this place is a paradise for someone, who wants to chill and just have a good time with themselves.
The food is also delicious. The pizza, bruchetta and pasta are on the top of my list. The summer cooler drinks too are very refreshing. 
The jam sessions, comedy nights and the daily events that keep happening make you want to visit everyday. Also the night market was a hit with a huge collection of pretty and quirky goods which I shopped like crazy.
All in all I would recommend this place if you want to spend good time with your friends or maybe just hangout with yourself. Then this is the place to be.

Located somewhere in the middle of a lost world called Salt Lake, thanks to navigation on gmaps, we reached rather quickly. As we entered we were greeted with loud live and not so melodious music which I personally feel was a pain. The music was good though loud but the vocalist was not fittting in. Firstly why would you have live Hindi music in a contemporary setup serving Cuisine from places miles away from India. It's not even fusion by any chance. 

Anyway, all that touches your taste buds matter and it's just that what's good here. Truly satisfied with taste and the perfectly cooked. Right from cream of mushroom to pesto to quesadilla to the desserts. Great!!!

Service is ok, not many of them respond in English in a non-Indian RestoCafe.

Won't stick out my neck to suggest for somebody to travel that far from South Calcutta, yet if you are keen for good food in the way back from somewhere nearby, it isn't gonna be bad idea.

This place is situated near CRP camp near no. 5 island in saltlake. Went to this place on a Saturday evening just for a coffee. The place was deserted with only few people around. We ordered a latte, a cinnamon cappuccino, hot chocolate and choco nado. Drinks came pretty quick and were quite good especially the hot ones. Decor is very good. They have a live Music setup but nothing was planned for that evening. Service is quick. Little pricey for the stuff they serve.

Located in Saltlake, Sector 1, Opposite to Police Residential Quarters.
The ambience is chic, with a section full of books. They also have a provision for a live musical evening.

For food we ordered - 

Hot Chocolate- Loved the presentation. The taste was normal. Not much on the sweet side.

Chicken Caesar Salad- The salad was lovely. The flavour of chicken added a nice dimension to the dish.

Chicken Lasagne - The sauce seemed to taste like an Indian Curry. Somehow felt the quantity was less compared to the price.

Chicken Cannelloni Florentine- The perfect blend of Chicken and Spinach. Felt less of Cheese or cheese sauce in this dish.

Smoked BBQ Chicken Pizza- The pizza was heaven. The perfect amount of cheese added to it. And the quantity of toppings was amazing.

Overall loved the experience. Courteous hospitality.

Heard alot abt this place..But it didn't meet our expectations.. the only saviour was the ambience... We ordered Veg Monte Cristo, Triple Decker sandwich and Lemon iced tea... Food was served after a long wait... Veg Monte Cristo was ok and so was Triple Decker sandwich.. the coleslaw served along with sandwich was stale & smelling...V did inform, however no one got back at all.... further they still levied service charges without even seeking our view... In all a bad experience and not worth the hype....

One of the best Cafes, i have ever been to. Ambience was excellent, staffs were very good. The turnaround time after placing the order was acceptable. I ordered terminal special pizza, Mexican rice burrito, Strawberry fizz and chocolate frappe. All tasted good to my buds, especially burritos, except strawberry fizz. I think because of that i would deduce half points. The very concept of live music and small library in there was a different experience all together. To conclude, I would say this has to be one of best places in Kolkata to spend some quality time with your friends. 

P.S. To add to your fun, there are board games as well.

Went to this place for a sweet afternoon and had some well prepared desserts. I would be specially mentioning the cold coffee brownie delight- not only the soft brownie chunks but a rich cold coffee, rarely i had in any place before- just fab. The choco tart is well made. Another dish that mesmerized me was the creme brulee- rich cream with a berry jam. Waiting to try their continental dishes.

The most unique thing about Terminal 11 is that its decor has everything to offer. As you walk in, you will walk into a wooden floored, cushy seating and a dimly lit sombre ambience that makes for a great dining experience. But as you walk further, the mood suddenly changes into a more brighter effervescent cafesque layout with a clunky floor seating area and a library of books and board games that will draw you and your gang to hangout all evening. And there is a third section further inwards meant for hookah. I don't know how that area is but I appreciate the fact that its completely segregated from the rest.

          Coming to the food, the menu offers the same wide range of dining options as the decor does. You will find everything from beverages and sandwiches to salads and platters.

We had chicken stroganoff w/ herb rice which was an absolute killer. The flavoured rice blended perfectly with the succulent pieces of chicken and made for a great eating. Also loved the Rosemary roast chicken, a perfect blend of chicken and red wine.

        There is also a stage area where live performances take place and I would love to witness that someday. I would definitely recommend everyone to give this place, especially for continental and american cuisine fanatics as it is one of the few joints in Salt Lake that offer such a wide variety. But most certainly it is one of the most coolest joints in the city

If you love continental, Italian food then Terminal 11 is the best place to visit. We went there only to hanging out with our friends. We ordered coffee there which was good. It was a great place. Awesome decor, cozy ambiance. They had a private dining area and a smoking zone too which were a plus. We loved their live music. Simply we loved their hospitality. It was a satisfactory experience for us.

Despite being one of the well rated cafe/hookah bar, i have been really disappointed in this place. I have heard a lot of good things about this place but sadly, it was not up to the mark, especially for me. My friend and I visited this place around 1pm and we wanted to have breakfast. In the menu it said "all day breakfast", but the servers said that they don't serve breakfast anymore. Then I questioned them that it says all day, which technically means you should be able to order them anytime you want. Then we were told that breakfast is only on selective items. That was the first disappointed. We then asked for vanilla hookah. It was so poorly made that we could taste the coal from it. For food, we ordered new York spaghetti with meat balls, carbonara, Caesar salad with bacon and cheese garlic bread. For drinks we ordered for blueberry choco cafe and cafe americano. For desserts we ordered for blueberry cheesecake. Spaghetti was really disappointing because you are supposed to serve it with marinara sauce, which was not. The meatballs were way too big. Carbonara was alright. Caesar salad had too much of dressings and they used cucumbers in Caesar salad. You never use cucumbers in Caesar salad. Cheesecake was so frozen that it felt like I was eating ice cream. Blueberry cafe was so sweet that it gave me a huge sugar rush. 
Not only that, the seats are awefully uncomfortable. It is just terrible, overall, and I wonder why this place got such great ratings. The service was nice but that is not enough for me to rate more than 2.5. I am definitely not looking to it.
Not only that, it is too expensive. All of this costed us rs3,300+. The tax itself was around rs700. Totally not worth it.

If i was to rate the place only on Ambience i would give it a 5. The decor is very trendy, vibrant and is bfully color coordinated. But the food was quite disappointing so i am giving it a 3.5. We ordered a veg Quisedella and it had a indian brown gravy tasting paste in the filling. Hazelnut shake was toooo sweet and the french onion soup tasted tangy. Also, i have never come across a French onion soup with chopped onions in it. The soup is classically made with sliced onions. The service too was not very impressive. Almost everytime i had to get up or wave hard to get the service staff to notice us.

Btw you can read books from thr collection while at the cafe and there is also an option to buy books.

The most unique thing about Terminal 11 is that its decor has everything to offer. As you walk in, you will walk into a wooden floored, cushy seating and a dimly lit sombre ambience that makes for a great dining experience. But as you walk further, the mood suddenly changes into a more brighter effervescent cafesque layout with a clunky floor seating area and a library of books and board games that will draw you and your gang to hangout all evening. And there is a third section further inwards meant for hookah. I don't know how that area is but I appreciate the fact that its completely segregated from the rest.

Visited this cafe on a lazy and hot Sunday afternoon and it was quite a good experience. I loved the concept of books and coffee out there. They have a separate shisha lounge inside the main cafe however the air conditioner was not working the day I visited. At 40 degrees, all they could do was open the window and serve us hookah and charged us service tax as well which was unjust. I did complain regarding the same before the payment was made and the manager promised to give me good discount on my next visit. Haha! A lawyer has been bribed. Apart from that, it's worth a visit if you're a book worm. :)

Well.. One of the best cafes I have been to in Kolkata.  I digged the food simply. We had proper English breakfast with bacon,  sausage,  scrambled eggs,  toast and some cheese based side dishes.  We both loves it.  And the ambience -  just awesome.  Surrounded by a huge collection of books in a beautifully decorated place and taking a sip at your coffee with a book in your lap and the nice aroma of the food in front of you - well that's something rare in Kolkata cafe circuit. I heard some bands perform on weekend evenings -  though I don't much like the idea of live band in such a leisurely atmosphere -  but would definitely want to visit here once during evening -  maybe they will play me a Judas Priest or Sepultura :)

Coming to the food, they have a long list of beverages and main course. The options for dessert were however very little. Altogether this is a perfect place to spend your lazy afternoon sitting on a bean bag and chatting with a friend

Stopped by this cafe, done in green, plenty of pop culture references and offers books + live gigs. I'd like to suggest softer music when there aren't gigs going on since reading becomes difficult. We ordered the following:

New York Spaghetti with Meatballs (₹425): The pasta was cooked in red sauce which tasted great. I was delighted to find the centre of the meat balls filled with cheese! The portion was filling.

Choco Frappé (₹165): Good!

Café Mocha (₹120): My cup of mocha was warm and not hot when it arrived but the presentation made up for it. The biscuit was buttery and light (and tiny, please work on the size).

Price wise this place is definitely on the steeper side (taxes aren't included in the above)! Service was slow although we visited on a weekday (but the place was packed!). Looking forward to trying out more at Terminal 11.

I don't know how it got so many good ratings. Did I miss something.

What I really enjoyed was the taste and quality of food. That is the only thing I can praise other than the ambience.

The staff are not attentive at all, I had to wave a lot or reach the counter to draw their attention. The bean bags are not very clean and neither comfortable. I had to complain about the AC twice.

Though the food was good but surely was overpriced and also very less in quantity. I ordered cold coffee, pasta and French fries and all of them was good to taste.

The ambience is great with so many books I just feel like spending all my day in there. There is also a section which has bean bags and some indoor board games which is quite good. And even if there's something which is not on the menu they will prepare it for you if asked . Like i had mixed sauce pasta craving that day and even if they didn't have it on the menu they made it for me and it tasted good. Only thing is they don't have liquor license yet. If they get it it's gonna be one of the most happening places in saltlake.

We also ordered three types of mocktails namely virgin fire and ice, mint julep and ice tea .virgin fire and ice was heavenly good. In the main course we took chicken alfredo pasta and fish and chips which was amazing. And finally in the desert section we took creme brulee. The texture of the upper crust of the creme brulee was absolutely perfect.Dipanjana Bose

I have mixed feelings about this restaurant..coz the very first time I went there it broke all my expectations..the cafe was not at all crowded but they took 55 mins to serve a pepperoni pizza where the pizza base and the pepperoni were hard enough to give my jaw a tough time..when I complained the staffs said that pepperoni pizza is supposed to b hard which blew off my mind!😅 With bad memories i thought of giving it another chance..Nd yes it was far better..the service was fairly quick..but the chicken wings were very average..the thing which I loved was hazelnut shake..it was perfect..so overall my lenient fingers give it a 3.5!

This is located in Salt lake , you can take an auto from Baishakhi heading towards 4no tank/Ultodanga,it will roughly take 3-4minutes from Baishakhi.

For a group of 4 people we ordered

1. English breakfast - it had an omlette, two potato hashes, baked beans,fried bacon(chickn is also available as an alternative option), 2 pieces bread and a generous amount of butter. Your day is bound to be great if it starts with this breakfast! Amazing portions and amazing taste.

2. Chicken Quesadilla - These are wraps with stuffings made of chicken. It might feel a tad bit dry sometimes but it has a good taste.

3. Beer batter fish and chips- This is a MUST HAVE in terminal 11!! Generous portion of fish fried in crispy batter ,served with lot of french fries and a tasty dip made of mayo and herbs n spices.

4. American Buffalo Chicken wings - Chicken wings cooked in a tasty sauce and served along with it. It has slight sticky gravy which is very delicious! 

Our bill was around Rs. 2000 

The decor is very laid back and chilled out with free wifi available, it usually has several live gigs lined up every now and then and has a good stock of board games and books to read too! 

The staff is very well behaved

However, the price is on the higher side! The beer batter fish n chips alone costs more than 500!
But if you want to have really good food and have a good time then Terminal 11 is the place to go to!

A set of friendly staff, good board games to sit back and relax after a tight schedule, watch live performances and then also get enough options to order and munch on. While you can sip on milk shakes and engage yourself in long conversation, you could also be the one sitting with a cup of coffee and finishing your pending work. You get ample books to read on while you keep munching. It's not heavy on the pocket either.

Terminal 11 truly defines the word "perfection".
Perhaps the only café I have come across in Kolkata that can be compared with the bistros of Europe. An absolutely brilliant eatery with fantastic decor, ambience, location, which offers you a myriad other activities apart from eating mundanely. The regular cultural performances are a huge turn on.

Now coming to their food, I must recommend Chicken Quesadilla and Chicken Lasagna, which are my all time favorites and hazelnut coffee which is simply out of the world. The dishes are awesome, diligently priced, perfectly complimenting with their ambience and topnotch service.
Way to go guys. :)

One of the better places for continental food with a fulfilling American breakfast with good sized portion which would leave an average patron well satiated. Have been to this place 4-5 times over the past 3 months . Discovered it when went here with friends for the first time . Average ambience with the usual board games and book section similar to other coffee shops . However where the similarity ends is the food. The Spanish omelet , the waffles, the pasta and the lasagna are really good and leave you craving for the taste long after the meal. The pizza however is the weak link here and I would like to avoid it in my next order . The bacon and sausages are cooked the right level of crispy without being overdone. The desserts are decent , the Creme brûlée I tried was excellent without the eggy vanilla aftertaste commonly seen with it. The blueberry shake was outstanding with the perfect slushy consistently and taste . Overall a breakfast / brunch kind of place which makes me want to visit it again .

Hi friends,
Giving a review after a long time, I searched restaurants in Zomato who serve healthy foods and it suggested many names, among them was the terminal 11. It's in BF 11 so the name goes well and the foods are really finger licking good😋. They are delicious, yummy and the ambience is very friendly and easy to be comfortable and enjoy your own zone. Classic pop songs are being played throughout and if u care for a hukka they also have that 
Overall nice place and should visit again!

So it was our second visit here after which we finally decided to review the place. 
Terminal 11 is a very lively place with good music and crowd! The interiors are done very nicely and matches the theme of this cafeteria. 
Moving over to food.. we tried the Coconut Sparkling Lemonade and the Chocolate Shake.

Lemonade was very mildly flavoured much to our distaste whereas the milkshake played it's game. Both the drinks were refreshing though..
Then we ordered for Veg Cannelloni and Spicy Mexican Rice with Cajun Spiced Vegetables.

Veg Cannelloni- This cannelloni won our hearts. Perfect to taste and rich in flavours. This dish was very creamy and the quantity was sufficient for two. Also it came with a small portion of salad.

Spicy Mexican Rice with Cajun Spiced Vegetables- This was like a platter of Mexican Rice and some bell peppers, cottage cheese and onion tossed in Cajun flavours for the side. The dish was delicious too and highly recommended!

Overall a nice place to chill out with friends and enjoy some good food. We would point out that the prices are a little in the higher side and services are not so prompt. These are some minor cons which can be managed and taken care of.

We ordered white sauce pasta(it was okay) mixed sauce(good), mexican spicy something pizza, cold coffee (normal like every other place), frappe with vanila ice cream(could have been better) and Barbeque chicken pizza! This pizza was superb tasty and better than a lot of places i been to...
There was something sparkling coconut with lemon...they need to work on it! Or just scrap it off!

The service is a bit slow but we didnt mind because we wanted to hang out for sometime!
I would love to visit again! Staff was very warm and i loved the decor! Especially using wooden trunks as tables! :)

I loved the ambience here and barbeque chicken pizza! We were a group of 7 people...wanted a place to chill for some hours...
We ordered white sauce pasta(it was okay) mixed sauce(good), mexican spicy something pizza, cold coffee (normal like every other place), frappe with vanila ice cream(could have been better) and Barbeque chicken pizza! This pizza was superb tasty and better than a lot of places i been to...
There was something sparkling coconut with lemon...they need to work on it! Or just scrap it off!

The service is a bit slow but we didnt mind because we wanted to hang out for sometime!
I would love to visit again! Staff was very warm and i loved the decor! Especially using wooden trunks as tables! :)

Came here for once as of yet. And I just fell in love with it....the ambience is so good.
They have a separate room for hookah. This place is beautifully decorated. I loved their shakes and dessert too. I'm looking forward to visit here again. And I recommend this place to everyone.

It's funny how I have practically lived in saltlake (considering how We end up there taking long drives most of the time) and haven't noticed this place before. The interior is something that you don't get everywhere. And the fact that they have a bookshelf right there for you to grab a book and read while sipping on coffee! Really! I mean park street and elgin road have them too. But the food here nothing like your ordinary cafe! I guess I was having a panic attack for so long after the worst mac and cheese I have had so I was quite nervous when I ordered it here. But to my suprise and absolute joy I must say, it was great to eat and know that someone out there understands mac and cheese. It was oozy and cheesy and a little crusty on top. We also had the garlic bread which was nice too. The mango shake is pretty good, and my cooler, all time fav I guess, the lemon ice tea was refeshing! 

I really like this place, so definately going to visit soon with a bunch of friends to play a board game or just stuff my face. Till then, keep it up :)

Nicely decorated cafe. It can be preferred place for the book lovers as this cafe is like a small library. It serves the purpose of reading  over a cup of coffee or refreshers.
Special mention : Menu card design is different and good and quite unique.
Who loves coffee must try the lychee nut latte. I loved it and the combo of lychee and coffee seems very innovative to me. But the price (Rs.205 + taxes) for a small cup of coffee is not justified. Virgin fire and ice is refreshing.
For rest of my orders, american buffalo wings is so so..not wao type. In desert, Tiramisu gave a smoothing touch to my mouth.
So, all together Terminal 11 is a very good place to hang out with yourself, along with your friends, partner with good food but not pocket friendly for the college teens.

The ambiance was nice with good music and also a place to shop. Loved the vibes.


We ordered American Buffalo Wings, Tirimasu and the cheesecake.

The wings were not much spicy as much as I was expecting it to. They gave six pieces and it was filling. They were okay.

In desserts, the Tirimasu was really good. Like really loved it. Soft and sweet. More like a pudding but a little heavy textured. But, the cheesecake was hard. Really hard. Perhaps the hardest I've ever had and that's not how a cheese cake should be. Anything but that.

So, it can be tried but am a tad disappointed as it's not very cheap. It's a decent place but.

INNOVATIVE DECORATION !!! 
The preparation of food is very good.  I tasted some drinks too.  They were also good.  The best part is that they have a separated hookah section and an exclusive sitting arrangement for big families and group of friends who enjoy board games and books.  
The starters are really good.  Average cost pp is rupees 400 . The service is also good.

This place is literally one of my favourite hangouts in Salt Lake. Why just Salt Lake, in the whole city I guess.

My boyfriend (who is now my husband) and I discovered this place when it had barely opened. We must have been one of the first customers, way back when they were serving only coffee and a couple of food items (even their menu cards had not been printed yet!).

I have been so glad to see this place evolve into just the kind of hangout I love.

The seats are comfortable, the decor is perfect, the ambience is cosy, the collection of books is quite engaging, and the staff is amazing. The coffee (especially the flavoured lattes and cappuccinos) is great, the food is pretty good, the desserts are amazing.

Special mention to the menu card - I find it damn cool!

Most importantly, since I am an introvert, I am always on the lookout for cafes where it will not be weird to be seen alone, drinking a cup of coffee and reading a book, may be. This is just my kind of place!

Recommended drink - Cinnamon Mocha, Blueberry with Choco Cafe, Himalaya Lemon Grass tea
Recommended food - Pasta with Spicy Lemon Sauce,
Recommended dessert - Tiramisu, Apple Crumble, Creme Brulee

Quite a happening place, specially for the youngsters. A menu which showcases some of the delicious dishes, which did make me think 'I wish I could have everything that's on the menu, excluding the green ones. It's definitely more than just a café. Yes it's expensive. But this place will make you bleed money. Can't comment on the ambience coz I was awestruck 👍

Coming to this cafe, the one thing which is the main attention here- if you are a pure coffee lover, this is the place you should never miss.

Location:
___________

It's in sector 1, salt lake. BF block. Just opposite to the police resedential quarter there. And if you search it in Google map just type Terminal_11.

Decoration:
_______________

They have two separate part like hookha zone and non hookha zone. We didn't take sisha , so there in non hookha zone. It was quite eye catchy. They have the single chair arrangements. They have normal table chair and sofa also for hanging around. They have the live band performance section and for the book lover they have a section for you also. With books. So, the decoration is very interesting.

Food
_________

Will start the review with the beverages. As i mentioned this is a perfect place for the coffee lover.

✓ Irish Coffee: very good.
✓ lychee nut latte : this is just unique and owssum. When lychee comes with coffee, it's sound that interesting and taste superb just.
✓ coconut sparkling lemonade: very very refreshing.

Now coming to food:

✓ chicken cheese lasange: owsum in taste.
✓ Rosemary roast chicken: served with boiled veg, Hamas, two pieces of chicken with mushroom sauce. It taste just superb.

It's a quiet a good experience. Service is prompt and good. A nice place to hangout.

It cost 1605 INR for two heads. price is on the higher side. but quality of food is excellent.

So, if you are a coffee lover do give a visit here. :)

Loved the ambience completely. It has a small Shisha room for people who love Shisha.
The staffs are very friendly and well behaved. 
Ordered a shisha, cold drinks and Alfredo chicken pasta. The food was amazing! One of the best pastas I've ever tasted. 
The pocket pinch is a little more than other hookah lounge but it's worth it. 
Definitely will visit this cafe again. 👌

We ordered the St. Patrick's Day special - coffee and tea shots. They were really good, and were served with delicious green butter cookies. Apart from this, we'd ordered the Banana Protein Shake, Chicken Caesar salad, Buffalo Wings, and Scampi Creole. All these dishes were simply amazing, and sufficient in quantity. The price is a little on the higher side, but would recommend.
Extra points to the décor and the well-stocked bookshelf.

I have been to this place a number of times and it never fails to impress.
They have a shelf of books for everyone to read, different board games to play and also live music to enjoy.
The ambience is awesome but the hookah section is too small and one can feel suffocated at times. 
The quality of foods and drinks are good. Hookahs are good too but not the best.
The price is a bit expensive. 
The service is prompt.
A must visit place for hangout with friends.

Second time I am writing a review for this place! This place never fail to amaze me.This time i tried ceaser salad,grilled fish and coffee frape.I would like to suggest a little cabbage in salad! Grilled fish was excellent!But people be alert with the bill.They add 8% GST and 10% service charge!That is actually not fair and it depends upon us whether we want to give it or not but they add it on bill!This thing disappoints me a lot!

The ambience is wonderful here. Usually , in the evening , karaoke and bands perform , but we went in the afternoon. There are different areas for seating , and one of them has bean bags. You can easily pass your time here by reading , playing games or just talking with your friends. 
The food was all in all good. We ordered the barbecue chicken pizza which had well cooked chicken although the crust was a bit thick for me. The cheese was in adequate quantity. Chicken lasagna was good too  , as it had a Cajun flavour to it. Soft lasagna sheets interspersed with chicken and topped with cheese on a bed of creamy , spicy sauce blend d the entire dish. The fettuccine carbonara was good with a variety of meat and the pasta cooked in white sauce. But the dish I loved was the chicken stroganoff. The herbed rice accompanied well with it and the chicken and vegetables with it tasted really good. The sauce they were cooked in was a mystery. It was very creamy and tasty and had a great burst of flavour in it. Each of these dishes was accompanied with garlic bread. There was also penne arabiatta which I liked because the sauce had a rich tomato flavour and was garlicky. 
The place is reasonable and has a very cozy feel to it.

Date of Visit – 12/01/2017

Location – Located near CRP camp,saltlake, also very near to famous swimming pool area of Saltlake.

Ambiance –  The interiors of this place is exciting. Seating arrangements includes from wooden chairs to sofas, bean bags etc.  There is also a podium for live music during weekends. A book shelf which holds a good collection. Also there are few board games that can be played while our food is prepared. Full marks for the decor.

Service – As most cafes, there was no one to greet and escort to our table. We chose our table and then waited for someone to give us the menu card. After a while had to call a waiter to help us with menu. The service time of preparing the food is reasonable. 

Food & Description – After hearing a lot of good reviews from lot of friends, really wanted to try this place. It was an occasion of meeting a foodie friend, so we decided to try this place. Food we ordered with description  :

Veg Burrito - Tortilla stuffed with mexican rice and was served with a salsa dip. It tasted good. Salsa went well with it.

Veg Strognoff with Herb Rice – Veg stroganoff has good amount of exotic vegetable. Its taste was excellent. A must try here.

Homemade Ginger Ale – It was refreshing but nothing that great.

Coconut Sparkling Lemonade – It tasted good and different. I liked it. But somehow I feel most people wont like it.

Overall the experience was good. It was good having good food with foodie friend over a chit chat. Good place for adda. Could be tried for people looking for new places

This place is located in sector 1. Very easy to locate. Went there in a lazy winter evening . As we entered the ambiance really amused me. It has these shelves full of books and also bean bags which were amazing. The music and those green theme color was also perfect.
All total it has that *adda* kind of atmosphere. Ordered for cafe mocha and latte. Though the coffee wasnt that great . I have had better in other coffee shops. 
The service wasnt that great either. Felt like the folks were relunctant to serve us.

Great food and ambience. But the hookah room was a disaster. Uncomfortable seats and lightning. Such a small room that after some time it was becoming suffocating to seat there. One of my friend got sick and we had to leave. The waiters were kind of rude. But hats off to the chef, amazing food.

Terminal 11 has established itself quite well in a very less time. Its become the favorite of youngsters. The music never lets you down, the service is brilliant and staff is humble. Try their mac & cheese and blackcurrent shake especially. They organise musical evenings on weekends. They have their own small  library,from which customers can pick their choice and enjoy reading with delicious food. There are also 8-9 variety of games in case you are +1 or more.

Lovely decor. Just everything about the decor n the ambience was perfect.
 There was a huge book shelf too filled with books. My only crib with that was the books could have been arranged in different sections Instead of just mixing all the different genres. But i guess thats the fun part- of finding your perfect book. 


The food was quite okay. Though if you want spicy food, skip this place. 
Don't know why the cold drink served here tasted different than regular drinks.. 
I may visit this place again, not so much for the food.. But for the books!!

Terminal 11 is my favourite place to hangout in Kolkata. Whenever I can't decide where to go, I invariably end up here. The ambiance is cozy and staff is hospitable. Although I haven't tried each dish on their menu, but having tried quite a few I can safely say all their food is delicious. Also they have books and board games and you can sit and work or study. I love this place, highly recommended!

Decor: Perfect is the word. Nice wood finish with decorative lights adding to the funky factor, Beautiful book shelves, live performance dias; in one word fantastic for a cafe setup. 5/5 for decor

Food: We had Irish Coffee and Rosemary roast chicken. The food was par excellence. The Rosemary roast chicken was served in black pepper sauce, along with sides of sautéed veggies and a yummilicious mash. The mash was one of the best I had had in Calcutta. The chicken was cooked to perfection. The black pepper sauce was perfectly balanced in terms of flavours. The Irish coffee was soulful with the right proportion of whiskey and whipped cream in it. Food decor was beautiful as well. 5/5 for food.

Now coming to my grievances.

The service needs a LOT, LOT of improvement. It was one of the worst I've had. On entering I was seated in the main cafe. The place was beautiful and I wanted to take pictures. A waiter came forward and said that I can't take pictures, it's their policy. I made him understand that the cafe is in partnership with Zomato and they can't deny a diner from taking pictures, but he was too ignorant to understand. He further added that I can take picture by being in the frame but not just the picture of the decor. How does that even make sense? If I can stand in the cafe and take picture with the cafe decor in the background, why not just the decor? Anyway I ordered for the Irish coffee. When it was served, I could see that the coffee spilled off the mug and dripped all the way down on the tray (visible in the picture). How much skill does it require to bring a cup of coffee to the table? While drinking the coffee, every time I was raising my head, 4-5 people from the waiters were staring at me, and they were looking elsewhere at the very moment of eye contact. This happened at least thrice. Dude, did not not see a person with coloured hair before? Do I look like a dinosaur? This was so far the better part of my experience. Now comes the real twist.

I ordered for hookah and they said that it is served in the other room. They directed me there and it was a bummer. Nothing better than a store room. Shabby, stuffy, and dumped with what not, starting from utensils to cables, to extension chords. The room had bean bags, beautiful wooden tables, stools, chairs and benches, however 80% of them were unorganized and stacked together. I wanted to sit on a stool by a low rise table and they told me that it's reserved. They made me sit at a high chair and my guest was sitting at a very low chair in front of me across the table, which made the communication awkward. The waiters were peeping every now and then, for no real reason.

At this point of time I put the rating on the Zomato portal with my initial impression (first paragraph of this review). The floor manager comes in immediately and apologizes for the inconvenience. However the damage was done pretty earlier. Then comes a host of other diners who starts to speak (read: howl) at a volume beyond the tolerance limit of human ears. The management did not say a word to them in spite of seeing that the other diners were hugely disturbed. We had to finish the meal quickly and leave to save us from the sonorous pandemonium.

With my first experience, I definitely would not have visited this place again. However as per my conversation with the floor manager, who'd promised to take care of all the grievances, I've promised him that I'd come back to see the improvements and then only I shall change the rating, and not before that, no matter how much he requests, because a good rating equals to recommendation, which I won't do with the current quality of the service.

The food is worth a huge recommendation, so is the decor, but the service needs a HUGE push.

It was a Sunday evening and we were looking for a place to hang out..So we went to this venture and had a somewhat mixed experience...The food was good and quite affordable...But the volume at which the live band was playing was deafening given how small the place is...It was difficult to communicate with the person sitting next to me...Honestly this place is much better of an option on the weekdays...

This place offers good food, with superb chilled out ambiance. You won't run out of options, when it comes to the eating options.  They offer delicious food at a very reasonable price. And the best part of this cafe is that the ambiance. Cool, comfy, impersonal, quality crowd, quality music. The food is freshly prepared and served with care. Pocket pinch reasonable.

A perfect place to unwind. Chilled out environment. Nice food, especially the salads section. Though wont suggest the bacon ceasar salad for the health enthusiasts. Otherwise the salads come with a lot of green and colored veggies, fresh lettuce. Theres an interesting  thing for the tea enthusiasts. Darjeeling fresh flush, with intact aroma. Personally wud prefer to be served in a tea pot, for that blast of flavour on opening. Loved their book section. Can spend hours waiting for your friends on  a Saturday afternoon. Then unwind with the live band playing. Overall nice place with decor n idea.

A nice place with amazing decor. The ambiance was also good. The place where they serve hookah is really small. We ordered hookah, hazelnut caramel shake which was good and canenolli which was also good. They also have live music. A good place to go out in salt lake. The total cost was 1200. The prices are on a bit higher side.

A cozy cafe with nice ambience.
For sitting one can choose from couches, chairs or bean bags, also they have a separate Shisha Lounge.
Two of the walls have huge shelves stacked with novels & magazines.
There is a stand in the middle decorated with old records.
They even have a small stage for live performance.
We missed the performance as we were a bit early and they were still setting it up.

We ordered:
Veg Burrito - Really Nice tortilla stuffed with mexican rice, served with a lip smacking salsa.
Veg Cannelonoi Florentine - Cannelonoi pasta stuffed with Spinach - Nice
Pain A Lail Con Gratin - Garlic Bread topped with veggies and Loads of Cheese - Good.
Chocolate Milkshake - Nice.
Cinnamon Roll Shake - Really strong flavour.

The food preparation was slow, but the staff was courteous and polite.
Overall a nice experience.

I had given this place a rave review as an initial find. Terminal 11 was never cheap, but popularity has made them unethical. We were charged a 10% service fee over 18% GST. Considering the price for two is 1000 bucks, a 28% markup is a bit much and uncalled for. I have been constantly recommending people to come here, and today when I walked in with a friend and found this it was actually slightly embarrassing. Very disappointed and not coming back.

A beautiful place with perfect ambiance and decor. The green lights calm you down and the bibliophile in you screams out in joy on looking at the marvellous bookshelf, filled with quality choices.

One of my friend suggested Terminal 11. And I agreed to his suggestion and visited this place. The first impression was - WOW! What an amazing decor this place has. The menu is interested and consists of almost everything a urban cafe should have. We ordered drinks and desserts, and everything turned out to be refreshing and delicious. The staffs are friendly and courteous. I recommend this place for a nice hangout with one's kith and kins.

Well after a long wait and searching through a long list of budding cafes in kolkata, we visited Terminal 11 on 31st December 2016, during the afternoon. We were looking for a place to sit and have a chat, a bit laid back without any rush or hurrying up to leave and that's exactly what we got! A big thumbs up to the ambience, and I'm one of those people who like a serene ambience with proper lighting and calmness and terminal 11 is just great for that. I saw all kind of seating arrangements from wooden chairs to sofas, bean bags, lifted chairs, almost everything for everyone. A great collection of books for bookworms, and nice music. Full points for the decorations and ambience. Now coming to the food it's good really, but the only con is the price being on the higher side. Well i guess that's for enjoying the ambience still i would say it's almost a hike of 15% over others, and on top of that a service charge of 10% is being added to the bill(well as per recent law you can deny paying that, but that time it was added), so we ordered chicken barbeque pizza which was delicious with its thin crust and perfect juicy chicken, it was sumptuous for two, we ordered an applemint refresher which was fine, and when i asked for a suggestion the waiter suggested mint julep which i was a bit disappointed with, as it was just kind of fresh lime soda, only a bit overpriced. Then for the dessert we ordered tiramisu and again it won our hearts! It tasted awesome, it had layers of cream, some brownie like stuff along with wine and the after taste of it was superb. Overall a nice place, would surely revisit.

Been there on multiple occasions and wouldn't mind to have another visit. Considering the fact that I am a bookworm, the idea of a book cafe interests and attracts me immensely. It has a lovely collection of books(and they give discounts) and some gift items (they are overpriced). I have never returned empty handed..Coming to the menu, Its definitely good..Chicken bruschetta was delicious, and served the purpose of the perfect Brunch. So were the pastas and salads-perfectly tasty. Definitely try the Choco Nado, thats my must have when I visit this place. The ambience is cozy and classy, supplemented with fine music or often live musicians. Good sitting arrangements-bean bags for your pefect adda or the formal setting for meeting-cum-brunch. I love the place. A little overpriced though, but worth it!

I had a very bad experience in the cafe today sometime back. Had gone alone to finish some work . I was not  given a table because I was alone and the table apparently is for 4 people. The cafe was empty and I see no reason why I should not be given the table when cafe was not even full. The courtesy of the staff is below average. Customer service is the most important aspect in this business and I was shocked with their rude behaviour. I think the matter needs a serious action to be taken. Have visited the cafe several times before and will not recommend it to anyone anymore. Rude staff, horrible behaviour.

Kind of like a cozy book café, what I liked about it is its shelves stacked with books. Being a bookworm and bibliophile I was impressed by it, not to mention the beanbags and Christmas tree décor.
Coming to the food, ordered Barbeque Chicken Pizza Smoked and Café Cappuccino; the pizza was delicious - better than many I've had, and the coffee was excellent, almost perfect, with a strong flavor, creamy and foamy to the right degree.
Ambiance is pretty chilled out as a café should be, with edgy music in the background.
The prices of food might appear a bit pricey but taste and quality are every bit worth the pocket pinch. Also staff behavior is polite and courteous, and service too is good and efficient. If you haven't visited it already do try out it soon!

Been to this place a couple of times now. A very over priced cafe, with fancy dècors and a good ambiance. We ordered cappuccino, hot chocolate, and chicken sandwiches. The cappuccino was good, but the hot chocolate was horrible. Almost felt like you're having a cup of bournvita -_-
The chicken sandwiches were served with potato wedges. To be honest, the wedges were more tasty than the sandwich. It was dry and chewy. And for 195 bucks,this is not the quality of sandwich you want for. 
Over all, 
Amniance- 4/5
Presentation- 4/5
Sandwich quality- 2/5 ( the wedges would get 4/5)
Sandwich quantity- 3/5( 4 small sandwiches were served, but still 195 bucks plus tax is quite high)
cappuccino -4/5
Hot chocolate- 1/5(totally a waste of money)

Its one of the classiest, coziest and a bit costly cafe in north kolkata.This ambiance is wonderful,there are board games,books and seperate place for sheesha.
Thoughs staffs have to pay a bit attention to the customer..most of the time they divert from the original order.Visited twice, both of the time we ordered brownie with ice cream and ended up having brownie shake for which they have charged extra.
But the food is amazing,the drinks are yummilacious..and the place is that much attractive that you will not want to leave!
Nice place to hang out with friends..though they need to pay a bit attention to the price they are charging.
Otherwise perfect 😊

Terminal 11 is one of the newest cafes opened up in salt lake, sector 1..To start off, it is probably the best cafe i've been too in salt lake...the decor is out and out creative..they have quite a large seating area comprising of couches, chairs and bean bags as well...you can have a seat wherever you want...there is a separate sheesha lounge too...this cafe also ensures that it is not just about you having food over there but also that you spend some quality time with your family and friends..they have activities for the customers , in which they are free to participate..there is a huge collection of board games, magazines,books and novels which you can enjoy besides having a sip on your coffee or having a bite at your wrap...the service is really good...coming to the food,though they might take some time to prepare it, it is every bit worth the wait...food is fresh and very tasty and wholesome too..I have visited the place twice, on both occasions with my girl...we had chicken lasagnia the first time we went there...and this time went for the chicken caesar wrap...both tasted as good as they looked..i must admit that the presentation of dishes are a treat to watch as well...i have just cut 0.5 owing to the price,which i think is not at all pocket friendly...however this cafe is a must try for all the foodies out there purely coz of the fact that it is a top quality cafe..

Once on a sunday morning i discovered this place.

Like its unusual name this cafe is also out of the common lot.

Live musical performance 

The  casual seating arena

The bean bags 

The smoky arena

The wall

All are smashing. 


Specially liked the menu book

So well crafted.

Food is bit costly but overall a very good place

You would really enjoy the ambience and the food......The place has a good collection of books as well...which you can purchase as well as enjoy reading there.....but I guess in duration of an hour or 2 of  visiting the place  you would hardly care about reading a book.....specially when you are when with friends....ND here comes the sport spoiler...besides the 20% of Vat nd service tax they charge 10% service charge for the music , books nd board games which are available there but not everyone reads or plays.....so you end up paying 30% tax......

It's so heartening to see that Salt Lake, Kolkata finally has a place that offers the perfect cafe ambiance. Everything about Terminal 11 - food, decor, service, interiors - is TOP NOTCH. 

The best parts: - separate room for hookah and a beautiful bookshelf. The washroom is very well maintained (yes I am a liitle OCD about clean washrooms). 

Coming to the food:
1) Choco Mocha - Absolute bliss. Perfect balance of coffee and chocolate; I would have ordered a second round had there been space in my tummy. 
2) Choco Frappe - Yummy cold coffee, but a little too sweet for my taste as I prefer my coffee to be on the bitter side. 
3) Veg Quesadillaa - Good, but too spicy. (Note to self - Why order spicy food when you don't do spicy!)
4) Veg Pasta with Pesto Sauce - This, my friend, was FOODGASM ON A PLATE. I loved it and I will order it on my next visit (which I hope will be soon). 

Overall, Terminal 11 is a godsend for a person like me who is always on the lookout for good cafes in Kolkata.

A very cosy place in a quite neighbourhood where one can sit down for just a good cup of coffee or have a nice quiet meal. It has arrangements for live band performance during weekends, though I haven't seen it as I had been there on a Tuesday.
The food is good and has a good menu selection. A simple pasta is well made and that makes me score this place high on food ratings. This is a place worth spending your evening at, provided one can endure being a teetoller that evening.

The ice tea, hot chocolate, chicken lasagna and both veg and non veg pizzas are fabulous and it's roughly Rs 400 per person.
The brownie too is good! The service tax and other taxes add up to 15.60% which is very reasonable. And there are loads of board games and books that you can rely on if you're going there alone!

I had been a regular customer of Terminal 11 since 10 months. Being a food blogger and reviewer, I am bound to take down my previous review where I rated them 5.0, and now posting this review rating them 1.0.
It was at 10:30 at night, which is the usual time I generally visit this place. But today (tuesday dec 13) the staff who were present were illiterate and obnoxious. I heard them discussing among themselves "isko kuch bol k bhaga dete hain kaun rahega itna der aur".. as soon as i asked for the menu, they declined to give saying they r closed and i should leave. I was surprised as they generally serve everyday at this time to me. I was an ardent fan of this place, but this place is a major turn down now. Especially with the illiterate and rude staff this place surely will go down in ratings. I will take absolute care of this fact that I spread the word more among the foodie community and take steps to turn the cafe down. Let me see how it runs when it has no kind of customer respect and hospitality.

I really like this place. First of all the decor is very warm and inviting. There are lots of books around. Music is very good and there's a place for life music. So thumbs up to that. To top it all, they gave free pumpkin lights on Halloween. 😊
Food is also really good. I've had many things here... Chicken lasagna, rosemary roast chicken, grilled fish caper butter, stuffed chicken breast misone, veg stroganoff... And i loved each of the items i had. The garlic bread is also delicious. This place also serves very good coffee...hot or cold. Only the ice tea is average.
Overall i love going to this place and strongly recommend it.

Terminal 11 is one of my favourite spots in Saltlake, since Peace of mind is absolutely necessary in a world like today. And this place gives just that.

The cafe has a small stage for mini events to happen, be it music, stand up comedy etc. And they do host them as well. It also has a wall filled with books to read and books to purchase. They have a lot of fun games to play to, like Scrabble, UNO, Jenga etc. Nobody can actually get bored here. There is something for everybody to do.

Terminal 11 serves Sheesha as well and there is a different room for it since a lot of people can get uncomfortable with smoke and such places attract more than just Sheesha smokers. The room has various seating arrangements plus dim lights. The main section is bright and lively.

The food that we have ordered here in our various visits are-

Excellent place to chill out and have some Gus time with ur friends.The interior is wat looked appealing to me.One can play various board games or read books of different genres.On top of it they even have live music shows in weekends.Best Part is that they have a separate hookah section.
Coming to food they mainly offer continental which are to be savoured as they are good both in terms of quality and quantity.
A must go place fr all cafe lovers.

Wanted to go here for a long time and finally got the chance to. Just near C.A.P Camp it's a fairly spacious cafe. The ambience was beautiful it had stacks of books and a variety of board games. There's also a small stage for live performances. Now, the food. We ordered Strawberry fizz, French fries, Mac and cheese, Creme brulee and Tiramisu. The food was well up to the mark but the mac and cheese was the best I'v had in a while. Would love to go there a second time. :)

Really fun place and the staff are very helpful. Try take great measures to ensure a happy meal is had. The quantity of food you get with each order is humongous and impossible to finish by just one. We had the BBQ chicken wings, chicken sandwiches, Cajun rice with chicken and Caesar salad wrap. Everything was delicious and filling. Also, there are games and books which make your visit even more worthwhile.

OUR FOOD FLIGHT TOOK OFF FROM HERE...

The wait at Terminal 11 was worth it. The intellectual cafe cum restro bar smelt of books and music, benches and bean bags. The whole ambiance simulated the coffee house culture where people could meet and talk, and this place stimulated the same to create some meaningful conversation over some lip smacking tongue twisters. This time we were there for our Mahalaya Dinner and the dishes ordered including a Chicken delicacy stuffed with spinach and a dish containing cheesy pasta rolls were just awesome.

What an amazing place this is!! 
The ambience itself is so much heart melting. With green lights setting the atmosphere to bean bags, cushions with quirky writings and beautifully crafted racks on the wall that looks great! 
They have a pretty good collection of story books and board games. So irrespective of whether you come here with a gang or alone, you're sure to have a good time. 
They also have live band performances in the evenings. 
We had ordered Choco Nado, Chicken lasagna and fish and chips. 
Choco Nado was a chocolate shake topped with cream, delicious!
Lasagna was one of the best I've had. 
Fish and Chips has always been a saviour to me and this was no less either. Battered fillets served with fries and tartar sauce. Each and every item happened to be highly impressive. 
The price however is a little steep. The bill was over 1200, as far as I remember. As for the food, ambience and spending good time here, surely recommended.

I have hardly had any better pasta than this great place offers. I could even eat the plates up! And the chicken lasagna? This place is all comfy and kinda cool, especially the evening music bands. Somebody take me back to this place. Please.

Absolutely disastrous food!!full of shit we ordered only three itmes and the quality waa horrible they charged us 1600 rs. And also service charge which is not at all applicable(at 10%) as per the regulations.the soup was horrible and like a medicine,the pizza was stale it was thin crust but it was hard to chew and the rosemary roast chicken uhh..very bad..they promised that the chicken would roasted and spicy but it like boiled and of bad taste..
Please lower your prices and improve the quality of your food.

Considering the most famous coffee place in the city is right in the middle of the city's book district, why don't more cafes focus on "books" as a theme?

Terminal 11 does. The cafe came to our notice as the site of a book sale a few days ago. Anemic though the sale turned out to be (as a friend attested to), it did its job and got the place noticed by book lovers like us. And so, on a warm-ish Sunday evening, four of us headed to Salt Lake for a late tea/early dinner kind of a deal. And now, onto the review.

Ambiance: While the decor is not as "bookish" as I expected to be, it's certainly eclectic, with sofas, hard-backed chairs, padded bar stools, as well as some cube stools and bean bags. On the whole, the effect is like someone went to a really classy garage sale and came back with whatever he could, synchronisation be damned. It works though. Because everything clashes, it approaches a kind of bohemian harmony until nothing looks out of place anymore.  Oh, and the books, of course. A wall is dominated by a giant bookshelf with a few hundred books lying about. There's no organisation, and purists may shudder to see TS Eliot on top of EL James, but it's fun, and makes for a good visual. You are free to pick up and read anything, although let's face it, if you are going to go to a cafe to read, you're probably bringing your own book. The centrepiece of the cafe is a small stage where live music is occasionally performed. It's a fun addition to the experience, but definitely not a huge deal if you miss out. On the whole, the place had a fun, laid back, atmosphere. It became fairly buzzy by dinnertime, so if  you are looking for some peace and quiet though, go in, and leave early. I'd give the ambiance a 4.5/5.

Service: The service was disappointing. There's no point sugarcoating it, but the servers seemed distracted and always in a hurry, even when there weren't too many people around. We were gently prodded to order multiple times, which I am never comfortable with, and there were considerable delays between entrees, a major no-no in my book. When a party comes in together, they want to eat together. Serving one person's entree a good ten minutes before the others get theirs makes for a very awkward ten minutes, and you don't want people to describe their dining experience at your restaurant as awkward. No bones about it, service was poor. 2/5

Food: Standard, overpriced cafe food here. For starters, we ordered garlic bread, which was good, and chicken wings, which most definitely was not. The wings were clearly pulled out of a freezer right before being cooked. Meat on bone is not supposed to be so tough and gritty. The sauce was scarcely better - a weird, sweet concoction that seemed like a cross between American BBQ, Chinese and Indian. 
For the main course, we ordered Chicken Pasta with Pesto Sauce, Chicken Cannelloni Florentine, Spaghetti (spelled Spagetti in the menu) and Meatballs and Grilled Fish in Caper Butter Sauce. Other than the Meatballs, which were flavourful, everything was middle-of-the-road. They tasted exactly as they are supposed to, but with no extra zing that makes you go "This is good!". The sauce the Canelloni was baked in was spectacularly bland though, so I'd avoid that one. However, the drinks we ordered - a selection of coffees and shakes, were fine and quite tasty.

On the whole, Terminal 11 is a good place to go for a cup of coffee and a chat with friends, but definitely not one I'd suggest for dinner. The food is unremarkable and dull at the price, so save your money, savour the ambiance, and dine somewhere else.

It's been a while since I've been to a place deserving a 5 on the rating scale. Great ambience. Great service. More importantly, great food. Genuinely pleased by how personalised it seems. Someone apparently took time out to choose the books for the shelves(they have an admirable collection) and the music thats playing. The menu seems pretty extensive too. 
Recommend: Buffalo wings, chicken quesadillas.

My love for cafés comes only a close second to my love for bookstores. I love exploring quaint little cafés where you can sit and read for hours or catch up with friends. Of late, I have been trying out new cafés, only to be sorely disappointed because most of them have hookah parlors on the side and by default, loud music and oppressive smoke. This makes it difficult to have a proper conversation, leave alone reading. So when I heard of Terminal 11, a cafe that has bookshelves lining the wall annnnd musical performances every weekend, I had my hopes quite high!
It was this Sunday that our group of four decided to check out Terminal 11. Right from the moment we entered, the décor made us all go Whoa!! I've been to a lot of cafés in Kolkata and décorwise, this is probably the best. Warm and inviting, this cafe in Salt Lake has art written all over it.
Seating was an eclectic mix of comfy bean bags, stools, chairs of both the plastic and wooden variety and sofas. Some of the chairs were bright green and matched the décor, which was predominantly green. Close to the entrance, there was a performance area along one of the side walls, and the staff told us there would be live English covers later that evening. In just 5 minutes, it felt like this would actually be a different experience altogether because this was so unlike any café I have been to.
The first thing I did was to browse through the books section. Robin Cook, Salman Rushdie, Alex Rutherford, Ruskin Bond - the collection was as eclectic as the seats. You could borrow a book for some on-the-spot reading and buy as well, if you liked what you read. Towards the back of the cafe was a spacious lounge area with bean bags and jute bean bags all over the floor. So interesting was the décor that we took a good 5-10 minutes to explore before focusing on the menu.
The menu had a large variety of hot and cold beverages, appetizers, main course and desserts. The available options were alternated with photos celebrating artists, writers and musicians, with the hashtag #One__To__. 1984 (#OneNovelToRead), William Blake (#OnePoetToRead), Elton John (#OneArtistToHear), We the Living (#OneBookToRead), Friends (#OneShowToRevisit) - there were mentions many art lovers would warm up to.
The beverages we ordered - 2 Irish Coffees, Cinnamon Mocha and Blueberry with Choco café - were served promptly, as were the appetizers - garlic bread with cheese and American Buffalo wings. While the drinks were top-notch, the appetizers were good but not exactly rare stuff; look around and you can spot such quite easily.
Dinner an hour later was a good, hearty meal. Chicken Pasta Alfredo, Grilled Fish Caper Butter, New York Spaghetti and Meatballs, Chicken Cannelloni Florentine - all were good but again, not really stuff to go ga ga over. Decentish in taste and quality, the food was a bit overpriced and not really top of the line.
While the attendants were polite, they were not always attentive, and we had to request for menu/water twice or more before being served. The pocket pinch was definitely on the higher side, but considering the unique experience this was, we didn't really mind.
My Ratings:Ambience - 5/5 Drinks/beverages - 4/5Food - 3/5Service - 3/5
If not for anything else, you should visit Terminal 11 for the ambiance. Definitely the first of its kind in Kolkata.
P.S. This one, too, has a hookah parlor but none of the repercussions mentioned above.

When I suggested that i wanted to spend a quite evening with him , my boyfriend drove me to this cafe ... situated somewhere in sector 1 salt lake ...this place provides a very romantic ambience with a jazzy touch. It's has a classy look and feel with the simple decor and the floor to ceiling library on one of their walls adds to their elegance. We visited on nabami evening and received a surprise treat of a live band performance on a makeshift Dias/stage they created right before us. The food is tasty but portions are not up to the mark. Pocket pinch ... slightly on the higher side.

Terminal 11 has been creating quite a buzz for some time now in the city. Finally ticked this one off my wishlist with a heavy lunch on Ashtami afternoon. Though they were having a Pujo special menu going on which had very few options of appetizers there, we went for the buffalo wings, I.e., chicken wings cooked in Spicey bbq sauce. The wings tasted fine, but the gravy was a tad bit thick for an appetizer and the wings were surprisingly big in size. The main course was the best part of what they offered. The chicken lasagna was mouthwatering & cheesy. We had the chicken burrito. The stuffed noodles and chicken wrapped in a thin crust of bread. Absolutely delicious. Loved their hazelnut hot Latte. The service was decent. But it could have been warmer. Terminal 11 has got a nice ambience, good food and good music. Do visit this trending cafe at salt lake.

Terminal 11 is an unique restaurant. The decor itself is exquisite and completely different from anything I've seen so far. From the circuit board like ceiling to the old tin box containing your bill, everything about the decor leaves you lost for words. The ambience is also on par with the decor with books & board games to pass time while waiting for your food. The service matches upto your expectations from such a place. The food is good but, to be honest, relatively expensive. I'd the waffles with cold coffee (Tropical Storm) & both the items tasted fine. I'd rate them higher but I'm just waiting to try out other items on the menu & to see how the service holds up during busier times.

This place was on my wishlist for quiet sometime and today i finally visited today. 
The decor is very cool. It just feels like you have entered a different world with all the books and the posters and lights .
A perfect place to hang out be it friends or family.
Comming to the food 
Vanilla Cappuccino - It was excellent. The coffee had the perfect amount of sugar and vanilla essence with a strong coffee base and accompanied with a small but very delicious cookie. 
Chicken Canneloni Florentine - I ordered this dish after reading a lot of praises in the reviews and genuinely the praises are worth giving. Minced chicken rolled inside pasta sheets and baked with sauce of tomatoes and cheese with a small boul of mixed salad, this dish was pure bliss.
Stuff Chicken Breast Misone - This was the star dish of the day. I just picked it out suddenly and i was glad that i did. Tender chicken breast stuffed with spinach and cheese and sautéed in mushroom sauce and served with boiled veggies and a heavenly dollop of mashed potato. This dish was HEAVEN.
Masapone Cheesecake - With a main course like that my expectations for dessert really went up and yet i was not disappointed. One of the best cheesecake i ever had in kolkata. Soft cheesecake with a hard crust and a dollop of strawberry coulis and a thinly cut kiwi. Beauty with taste as i have named it.
The servers are friendly and the ambience is top notch. 
This place is a must visit ...
CHEERS !!

Terminal 11 is a very well decorated cafe cum restaurant. I liked its interiors and the overall concept behind this specially themed outlet. Not impressed at all with the food though. The taste was average while the presentation was quite catchy. The waiters were somewhat cold in their behaviour. The music was loud. The pricing was exorbitant. The service charge was a part of the bill (service tax was also charged as normal), which kind of answers the indifferent behaviour of the waiters. I, actually liked nothing except the decor. They need a long way to go in terms of service and skills.

Make sure you got a lot of time on your hand, coz u will feel so much comfortable at this place that you might not wanna come back. 
Tastefully done interiors with a nice seating arrangement. Also they have separate hookah section. If you are not very active kinda person, take a book from the shelf and have  a good time. Board games a re also an option.

Service is a tad bit slow though but that can be overlooked since everything else makes up for it. In fact I am sitting here right now, listening to the band Moksha playing Bollywood numbers, over great cappuccino and delicious club sandwiches. Looking forward to many more such awesome evenings.

We didn't even realise that we spent hours sitting, enjoying there. Also, the food is tasty. The service is prompt. The men at work are really helpful and good. Yea it's on a little expensive side but is a pretty cool place to hangout with friends and to never get bored. :D

Such an awesome place, like how many restaurants have live show? Tastefully done ambience (I'm a bookworm and nothing beats those books stacked so tastefully rather in some usual vintage stack). Food was good specially their coffee. Also, I judge the hygiene of a restaurant mostly by the way they keep their washroom, Terminal 11 is not only squeaky clean but also well stocked. And lastly the management is extremely well behaved specially it's owner who not only is a warm host but also indulges in conversations that can range from politics to art.

Keep up the good work guys

But i wouldn't recommend third pizza.. because almost every single time I have had complaints against it.. n every single time they say that they will replace it.. but they never do.. they just go in2 the kitchen and bake it once again and give it back you.. and the staff are like.. sir have it now.. trust us.. it'll taste fine.. but it never does.. 

So I'll never recommend their pizza..

I have been to this place quite often and love the ambience, music and those who loves books will surely enjoy this place.. The food is good . The waiters are frenly and always have greeted us with a smile. I always take Mint Julep its my fav but lately I miss that THING , I hope Terminal takes a note and fixes the drink. Otherwise everything about this place is awesome... I prolly tried almost everything from the menu. Cream of Chicken (soup) is yummy! One of my fav.. The sandwiches, Pizzas are excellent.. Cesear salad, Buffalo wings , Beer batter fish , Chicken Lasanga, chicken pasta Alfredo, garlic bread with cheese, to name few are all Delicious.. Every weekend they have a live stage performance which is great but yes sometime it gets to loud and it becomes difficult to communicate with the person you are with.. The prices have been increased recently but nevertheless its a must place to visit if you want to hang out with your frens, read books, smoke hookah, want to watch a live band performance... 

ATTENTION : Terminal is charging additional 10% on Gross total as Service Charges which i feel is totally on the Customer's decision as to how much he wants to pay as a Tip. 
Restaurants can't force you to pay 'service charge' on food bill. Totally up to the customer to pay or not afaik..

Located at BF-11 beside HDFC bank, it's comfy & cozy, with well-balanced decor & nice music. The food is pretty good. We ordered coconut lemonade, fire & ice, mint julep as drinks. Fire & ice is fruit juice with a lovely spicy aftertaste. Mint julep is balanced but coconut lemonade tasted artificial. For starters, we had chicken burritos, which was absolutely lip-smacking, & buffalo chicken wings where the wings were somewhat dry. For main course we ordered spicy Cajun rice, which was pretty spicy, but tasted really good. And we took stuffed chicken breast misoni, which had 3 big stuffed pieces stuffed with cheese and spinach and other veggies. It tasted pretty nice. After all this, there was no space for any dessert. Will try to visit this place to taste the other dishes as well. Good service.

This place is absolutely fantastic. The ambience is really nice, with a very rustic feel and lively environment. In particular the food is just out of this world.

Everything that was made was made with fantastic ingredients. The quesadillas and lasagna were out of this world. You should also give their coffee a try. Their desserts are also really nice.

Just a note for fellow wheelchair users, this place is not wheelchair accessible and you would need help moving up a short flight of stairs.

Super cool cafe..loved the set up..from stage for performance by live bands to the bean bags and smoking zone for shisha lovers and also the bookshelf that holds loads of books(most of which are for sale)... absolutely well done in terms of ambience.. ordered couple of drinks and Brownie... didn't disappoint in that sector as well.. lovely service and pretty neat way to bring the bill at the end... experience was awesome..just that the broad games should also be presented as and in a menu form as soon as the guests enter to let them know what all games are available and it will also help keep  the customer involved while the food is being served and play simultaneously(I gave this suggestion in their feedback form as well)

Terminal 11 is the only food joint in saltalke which provides such a great ambience. Firtsly there are a variety of board games you can choose from.Secondly the seating arrangement is great. There is a separate room for hookah and a separate arena for dining and another arena for munching over coffee and snacks.You will not understand how time flies in this place. It has an extremely comfortable and friendly atmosphere. The food is quite tasty as well.The pasta in white sauce and chicken lasagna were extremely tasty. On some of the weekends there are live bands which is a cherry on the cake. Good food and good music go hand in hand. Perfect place to chill with friends. A must visit :)

Being a vegetarian it's difficult to find good vegetarian food in calcutta but this is an exception.  Have tried almost every thing in the vegetarian section and the American macaroni and cheese is out of the world. Coffee served with cookie is the best mood buster.  Should go with friends, family or alone. To add on they play excellent music

Terminal 11 is amazing - One of the best cafes i've come across in Salt Lake. Quality food, diverse, delicious. The ambience is really cosy and you feel like sitting there with friends & chill for hours. Love the evening live performances. The music is beautiful. From the menu, I will highly recommend their shakes (cafe toffee is a personal favourite) and pastas.

I was recommended to visit the restaurent but the food is not veey delicious as the reviews suggest. In my opinion the place is a bit overpriced compared to the food. But I must say that the interior was marvellous and very beautifully decorated. The place is also quite spacious and extraordinarily impressive. Food presentation is also very good but restaurents are meant for delicious food so interiors or presentations come second after the quality of the food.
We ordered
1. Lemon tea
2. Mango and ginger tea
3. Chicken lasagna
4. Triple decker chicken sandwich
Except chicken lasagna i didnt find any other item that good or yummy. If i visit the place again i would just because their decoration and hospitality.

The interior is done quite aesthetically which I ❤️... They have a really great collection of books which makes this place even more attractive for me . ... We have tried the American Buffalo wings and lasagna. Both the dishes were really delicious .   Considering  the quality and quantity of the food the price is really affordable..

Let me first start by saying the place is buit in a grand fashion, and does not tend to be claustophobic like other coffee shops.
secondly, huge variety on the menu which had me confused and impressed at the same time
thirdly, tried the veg lasagne which was just outstanding and won my heart, the blueberry and chocolate coffee was delicious too

Right from the time you enter this place you feel attracted to it. There is a station where the host live music shows. The staff is nice. But what catches your attention is the book shelf. Books kept are of different genres if I am correct some are for sale as well. You can simply sit there enjoy a cup of coffee ( in my case tea) while reading and listening to music. We ordered for choco frappe, ceasar salad, chicken sandwiches ( which was served with French fries)The salad was good but the sandwiches didnot live upto the mark. But what lacked in the taste got compensated by the ambience. There is a cosy corner with bean bags. All in all a lovely place.

This place is perfect for going out with friends and family alike. The ambience is appealing and the concept is well executed. The bookshelves have a wide array of books, and the games are a plus point. I went there to give a treat to my friends on my birthday. The staff was very courteous and service was fast, inspite of the café being fairly empty. The food is looks and tastes awesome! We tried the Lasagna, which was flavourful, yet light, the garlic bread, the mojito which was a bit disappointing due to lack of mint in it, two café frappes, which were good, a splendid thin crust pizza baked to perfection, vegetable quesadilla which was quite flavourful, and lastly a brownie with ice cream and a bad tiramisu. 

Overall, the experience was very good and I look forward to visiting it many times in the future.

Bookshelves stacked with writings from Ayn Rand to Leo Tolstoy. Live Music. Friendly Staff. Sheesha
This spacious, well lit place has seemed to hit a formula for success amongst the youth of Kolkata. I had visited Terminal 11 with friends on a Sunday and fortunately caught the Girl with the beautiful voice crooning some of my favourite songs. 
Ordered the Kiwi Mint flavoured sheesha. It was nothing special. Could have been made better. 
The bbq Chicken pizza smoked, on the other hand, was delicious. Thin crust and loaded with goodies. 
Being a hot chocolate fanatic, I asked for the hot chocolate which left me unimpressed. 
Although it has average food, the decor and helpful staff(my friend thought she lost her wallet and they seemed really helpful and concerned- she found it in the back seat of her car :p) are very inviting and I would like to visit Terminal on a rainy evening for a cuppa and a chat with my friends.

Ambience

This place is a cutely decorated restaurant using books for adoring it's interiors. Additionally there is free Wi-Fi service.

Service

The servers are very courteous and they made it a point to cater to all our needs.

Food

First of all we ordered for Chicken Callenoli Florentine which was marvellously delicious. Minced chicken was stuffed in pasta along with spinach; the sauce along with it had been generously punched with grilled cheese. Overall the dish was just the perfect thing we could have asked for. We strongly recommend this dish to all the foodies out there.

Next we ordered for Barbeque Chicken Pizza Smoked. The crust was thin, the cheese was abundant, the chicken perfectly smoked, the onions gracefully caramelized and the jalapenos well cooked. This dish too, left a great impact on us.

Beverages

We ordered for two mocktails, Sour Power and Coconut Sparkling Lemonade. Both of them tasted average, and were definitely lagging behind the pizza and pasta we had.

Nice place.
Had a dinner last night.
The area inside is spacious.
Located in the sector 1.
The games and book section was awesome and really liked it.

The food is, well, ok.
I expected much more from it than what I got. The quantity was good though.
I may be fussy about my food but that comes from experience and this one didn't met my expectations atleast this time.

Will try again for sure to have a different opinion.

Loved it the first time I visited- many board games were available n good food. But on my second visit, all the board games had been removed. When asked for it, the staff informed us that the board games have been piled up and locked in a separate room and will not be available for our use. On being asked the reason, we were told that they had noticed that customers mainly play games, while away time and leave. Only uno cards was given to us. Really disappointed by this attitude of the staff although the food was decent enough. My point being, if they do not want their customers to have access to board games then they should remove this tag from their zomato page.

Great ambience. Lovely decor.
With open library, games & contemporary seating arrangement - its just a perfect hub for young people to spend time with friends on the bean bags playing games. Or one can simple nestle in a corner with a book in hand from the shelves . 
The food is amazing. Must have items-  Chinese Pasta with Pesto Sauce
Price range is very reasonable. 
Good choice of music and that too at a decent volume, quite important for people who have low tolerance for loud music.

This place was on my wishlist from a very long time specially because of the rave reviews in zomato and their beautiful decor. I finally had a chance to visit there yesterday evening and my experience was fantastic. Now since its in salt lake, finding it might be a little difficult, unless one is completely aware of all the salt lake areas. The easiest way to understand is that it is just situated just opposite to the police quarters in bf block( the CAP camp).  The best thing about terminal 11 is of couse their decor. It is a coming off age cafe which has an extreme young look and feel to it.Its fresh, new, with wall decors, beautiful lights, and a lot of splashes of green colour. I specially loved the entire wall dedicated to books. Being a bookworm I just loved this section to the core. Coming to the service, the staff were quite courteous and friendly, however, i and my friend was very attracted to the bean bags arrangement and wanted a seat there, but we were 'politely' declined as we were in a group of two. Now this i found very silly as the place was almost empty. Nevertheless,we got a small table(a little too small for two people). For the food we opted for a chicken canelloni florentine and chicken quesadillas. The canelloni florentine was amazingly good. I really enjoyed the stuffing with ample amount of chicken, corn and veggies. The presentation of the dish was also very enticing.  The quesadillas also were quite filling. I enjoyed the bellpapers and chicken combination which tasted very nice. I particulaly enjoyed the salsa dip with the quesadillas.. Hence full marks to them for the two dishes. For dessert we opted for a cheesecake(But this was a miss. The taste of the cheesecake was no doubt good and it was very soft with a extremely cute kiwi on top and blueberries on the side but the cake was so huge ( as in the size of the cake was much larger than a normal cheese cake) that it contained a huge part of cheese and this overpowered the entire flavour and taste of the cake. It was soft but it was difficult to gulp it after two spoons. Hence 1 marks deduction for missing out on the dessert. The price of the food is on the higher side but then it is justified when quality of the food is judged. One more thing which was a turnoff for me was their loud music. A place so beautiful and with so many books around should have a soothing choice of music which just sets the mood right. But in here the music was too loud   and not at all a suitable one for reading. Hence a little change here could just add up to the beauty of the place. But despite all this small glitches, this place is a must visit for all food lovers and of course for all book lovers too. Nothing can be better than the combination of good food and even better books.

Great ambience , plenty of open space , nice decor , music played could have been better...we got a good welcome from the service personal.

Just a personal thought,
But i suppose if u have a habbit to be served fast and looked upon quickly then u may get a lil frustrated sometimes. From the way it looks they know u shud be lazying first enuf then would be ordering. 

Nice add ons : plenty of books to choose from and spend a leisure day with comfortable sofa , bean bags sipping coffee or tea or ur fav mocktail.
In weekends u can also enjoy live music , yet to be part of such events myself.

I can just say cafe coffe day in a refurbished format, u can spend as much time on a table u can , gossiping with friends , studing with friends..

Plenty to order from nicely crafted menu....
Today we tried , 

Mint julep 
Another form of frsh lime soda

Choco frappe 
Simple Cold coffee with ice cream nothing to die for...

French fries with honey mustard dip 
The fries could have a bit more fried but the dip was awesome yummy

Rosemary roast chicken
Nicely cooked with perfect flavour of the gravy and vegies as side on..


Overall it is nice to be place but the only thing to stop u can be the price tag going to pinch ur pocket.

Another note important atleast for me , Keeping board games attract childrens to a certain area which can make a noisy affair for u, it can be irritating sometimes....

While the concept and the décor are great, the execution is not actually that good.
On a regular day, without the live music and the rush, not only is the food better, but, believe it or not, also the ambience.
Their live music is way too loud, and annoying. Honestly, it gave me a headache and we actually left the place because of it.
The food is average. The service too. The ambience and the décor, when there is no live music playing, are it's high points. What I go back for, are the books.

Visited yesterday dinner time for an unplanned meal and the experience was more than satisfactory. This cafe in one of the prominent locations of sector one , with hookah and non hookah zones is very well decorated with all bright green blue and white lights, book shelves and a small stage for life performances thats held on weekends. We ordered our dinner for two :

Cream of Chicken soup
Stuffed chicken breast misone
Chicken lasagna

The prices have been increased a bit than whats uploaded in zomato. But each of the main course portions were very generous to fill up one person. Both the dishes were very delicious and well presented and our tummies satisfied . The only flaw was the mashed potato tasted bland and saltless and also the soup still has scope for improvement. Thumbs up for the rest 👍

You an play games with friends and have fun..or chill on a date. The ambience is lovely and you're sure to have fun here. The food was also great though I feel the prices are a bit on the higher side. We ordered Pasta with Pesto sauce and Choco Frappe. Both were good and we had a really good time.

This was my second visit. On a rain soaked morning my wife craved for waffles and we drove here amid heavy rains. It's very near the 4 no island Saltlake. We ordered egg Benedict and waffles along with coffee and milkshake. Both the dishes were great and the cream served with the waffle was yum. We went on to have two desserts after than - a lemon pie and a mascarpone cheesecake. Though it was too much for the tummy but everything tastes so good. 

This is fast becoming my favorite cafe and will revisit soon.

This one definitely belongs to the list of "cool" places, we have in Salt Lake. Easy to locate, brilliantly used space.

Live gigs, superb book collections...this place is a delight to be in! Board games, comfy seating arrangements...good waiters...must visit!

Staff service is really bad here. I think they should be more courteous to the customers. We had sandwiches and chocolate cappuccino. The food was good,nice hot chocolatey yummy cappuccinoes..and the sandwiches in decent amount,tasted really good. Their decor is what I loved most about this place..nice sitting arrangements,good ambiance. 👍

Well this place is pathetic due to the staff members( waiters) , if you want more customers please get rid off people like Abhijeet and Somnath as soon as possible. 
Lets start by saying usually when I enter a restaurant , cafe the first thing I do is take pictures and the personnel of the restaurants often tell me Please take that picture as well , they always greet me with a smile  but here as I started clicking pictures , Somnath comes and tells me you cannot any kind of pictures except for the food you order , which totally freaked me out and shocked me , I asked him you guys are associated with zomato right! he is like yes we are but you can't take pictures , even if you are an employee of zomato we won't allow you to take pictures , wohooo! He was really rude and ignorant indeed , but I told him you are with zomato I have the right to take pictures you can't stop me , then his colleague joined in (Abhijeet) , he told the same thing we don't allow anyone to take pictures its our company policy. I hope the owners of Terminal 11 looks into this , it was really ignorant of the staff to be so rude and later on when we decided to leave the place , they did not even stop us by saying please come back try our food , With this attitude I don't think Terminal 11 will survive  , trained personnel is required with man management skills.
Anyway here are the pics I took before the staff members stopped me.
I hope zomato also looks into the matter and inform/educate such restaurants that customers are allowed to take pictures without harassment and if  they don't like people taking pictures they should mention that in their respective pages, link or website.

Went today. Being a Sunday live band was playing. The artists were playing some nice hindi songs. The lead singer had a good voice. Now coming on to the other things - ambiance was ok, tables placed too close and were cramped for space. The food was descent but the prices were really high notwithstanding the fact that its a cafe. Service was poor, the person who took our order was bit uncourteous. Further we had to wait for around 20 minutes for the brownie with ice cream to be served. Now coming to the shocking part - They charged for the brownie, chocolate sauce and ice cream separately in the bill (photo enclosed). None in my group had ever experienced such a bizarre thing. Overall an ok outing, certainly not in parity with the high ratings this place has got in here. Go there just for the live band, ignoring of course some other things.

I visited this café on a Friday evening and it was moderately full. In terms of taste, I would mark this place an 8/10. The portions, too, were fairly decent. Oh and I also loved how their menu is just about perfectly sized! The service was slightly slow, but that's the only glitch that I can think of. The staff was pretty friendly too. And I would definitely recommend their "Stuffed Chicken Breast Misone".

The ambience and decor of the place is quite pleasant and laid-back. The music wasn't bad either. The board games and the quaint li'l bookshop are indeed a plus point (they also sell some of their merchandise as well as a few art 'n' craft items, I believe). 

Overall, we had a really good time at this place. And I would certainly love to visit it again soon!

Quite nice place.. Although the chicken wings were really not fresh as evident from the stale marrow. However the place has been nicely done up and the management is quite nice. I have been to this place about 3-4 times and my experience other than the buffalo wings had been really nice. Lots of things on their menu are definitely worth trying. A nice place to hangout with friends.

Very chilled vibe, would have loved to catch one of the live performances
The food is stupendous - had the Greek salad, grilled fish and the veg stroganoff - generous, well played and packed with freshness and flavour
Drinks could do with a bit of love and maybe the service could be sharpened with respect to staging and cleaning up in table turnover - but all in all a great food experience

Been to the place two weeks ago after being swayed by the excellent ratings and reviews on Zomato. Unfortunately, the decor of the place didn't seem to be in sync with the mannerism of the staff. Firstly, coming to the food - very few non-veg items and overpriced. We ordered chicken lasagne and fish and chips apart from a few mocktails.
When asked to serve the "Fish" which were two in number and were to be served to three. To my surprise, this guy came and gave two pieces to each of my friends leaving me with an empty plate.

A word of advice to the management:
You should either hang a "Self-Service" board or train yout staff well so as to your customers properly.

Could they have been any more annoying? Yes! they were.
As i said, we were 3 in number and the place was crowded, we were given a not so comfortable place to sit, with the assurance of better seats as soon as one got emptied. They intentionally overlooked the seat that got empty. We took the seat as soon as it got empty and guess what, out of thin air, the place was tagged as "Reserved" and we were given the bill even though we didn't ask for it, we were about to stay for a while and enjoy the live performance (the only good part) of the band.

It was very offensive and wouldn't recommend   any group with less than 5 members to go there.

An unique combination of panache and exuberance is portrayed by the terminal 11, the  bands performing add another dimension to this place. The food is palatable and the prices are economical for a place that offers this much.  All in all a good place to unwind and relax.

Today was my 3rd visit to this place, this itself means its a lovely place to be. However, today's visit was a disappointment and all the credit goes to the band that was playing today. They only sang bengali songs and that also too loud. We did request for quite a few hindi numbers but probably they dint bother. My visit earlier was amazing and for that the other band that was playing that day deserves the credit. All hindi numbers were sung beautifully. Its a request to please look into the songs being sung and the singer too.. The food, however, is excellent..

This Café is situated right beside the main road, just opposite to the CAP campus.

An eye-catching ambience that will amuse you every moment you spend there, pretty innovative decors and set-up. Bean Bags, Book-shelfs with vast collection of books from different genre. No one will complain if they serve the foods a bit late, because you can spend your time by reading books, playing board games, chatting and listening to the very soothing background music.

We've ordered Blue Wave drink, American Buffalo Wings and Tripple decker chicken sandwich with cheese. Three of them were as good as the ambience was. One of the best Sandwiches I've ever had, properly served with French Fries. Quality-Quantity ratio was better than I expected. The food is not so expensive because they do not take extra charges except 10% service charge which is fair. Service was prompt.
Definitely coming back again to spend some quality time and try other things.

I like this place.

Have been there many a times. I last went with a friend of mine with whom I spent around 3-4 hours of time sipping hookah, tasting different coffee's and trying different items. The plus point of this place is that time can easily be spent here playing jenga and board games.

Although I didn't like the ambiance of the hookah room compared to the main sitting. 
Coming to the food, it's pretty nice. All the coffee's we had were great. Kolkata needed a place like this. 

Thank you management for opening up with such a place.

Terminal 11, a nice, cozy Cafe in Saltlake. Interesting collection of books which either u can buy or read in all casual manner with a cup of Coffee and Sandwich. You can find stand up shows in each weekends in the little podium inside that can relieve your mind with the source of energy. Having a taste of American Cafe flavour although it belongs to some different genre that must make your mind well. Try it don't make late.

My sister and i decided to visit this place no matter what! On a rainy Saturday like today after getting totally drenched we landed in Terminal 11..... since we decided no matter what!!😁😁
A green atmosphere welcomed us with open arms...the sitting arrangements was spacious, environment was cozy, and hush hush atmosphere. Sold! The showstopper was the wall with the books..and being a book lover myself..this place bought me!! Amazing interiors!!! 👌🏻👌🏻
After making ourselves comfortable we decided to warm us up so we ordered a chocolate Cappuccino  and Caramel Sin.. both were good and then we drooled over New York Spaghetti with Meat Balls. It was yum!! Totally pocket friendly!!! 
 Later a live band  'Moksha' started their performance ..it was soothing like an icing to this rainy evening.. so we decided on another round of masala tea !
A total worth it rainy evening at terminal 11 ! Another visit is a must... this time dry!!😉

Nice ambience and appealing atmosphere, but exactly opposite staff. No etiquettes, not at all a welcoming experience. 
Cold coffee- Cafe toffee, tastes good but very poor quantity. Most part of the glass was filled foam and whipped cream
After a bad coffee experience, couldn't go ahead to order food. Anyway menu also not very good. 
Only plus point is the interiors and availability of board games.

Nicely decorated with live music performance by Bands on Sunday Evening. I went for Shisha, well Shisha we ordered was Teen pan grape, it was good with a bit less smoky. The smoking area is very small and less decorated. Pasta with mix sauce and garlic bread was good.  Overall the ambience is nice and staff were polite Average cost for two people is Rs.1200

Coming to food, had cream of asparagus soup and veg pizza. Both were very rich in taste, in pizza corners were very hard though. The cafe panna for first time for me, and didn't like it because its a shot of coffee with cream it gets cold soon.

Would love to visit again

One of the best late evening-outs for me. The Café Toffee was great, so were the Beer Batter Fish and Chips and Eskimo Friend. What impressed me and my friend the most was their hospitality and care for their patrons. We were the last ones left, and the staff took care to wait for our cab to come which seemed to be taking forever, and saw us off, when it was already past 11pm and past their closing time. It is touching to see the concern and efforts of the people running the place for their customers.
Smooth running, smart food and safe environs. What more can we want? Scrabble on people! 😃

There is much hype in the city about Terminal 11. I for one was awefully excited about visiting this place and did so this week, immediately after my exams got over. The interiors are well done up, with a dining area,with a podium for live music during weekends; a book shelf which holds a good collection, which are up for sale too ; a casual sitting area with some bean bags thrown in as well as a private hookah area.
                                                                ...

You can spend the perfect time over here even if you're alone...thanks to all those books. While for a group of friends, there are various board games to keep you entertained and having a good time. The decor is very lively and vibrant. Food was decent though I feel they should increase the varieties in their menu card...ample of choices when it comes to drinks but not so much in the food section. Overall, a nice place toh chill out with your friends. :)

You can just grab one of those many board games - scrabble, monopoly, etc or the usual snakes and ladder and spend hours. Not bad if you want to just sit and chat as well as the music is not very loud. The coffee was good but the sandwich and the tart could have been much better and hence a slightly lower rating. Pricing is ok. Overall - definitely worth a visit!

Do you prefer fun ambiance to hangout with friends ?
Do you love coffee ?
And lastly , do you like to have some live music ( yeah you have to be little bit lucky ) or read from your favorite author(s) while taking a sip of your coffee?
If your answers are yes , Yes and YES . then this a great place for you. The ideas are different . from menu cards to the bookshelves ( yes. You can buy books from there as well) . we ordered Irish coffee and Chicken Hawaiian pizza . the service was quick and the prices were moderate . and the coffee came with tiny handmade(probably) cookies which was great. The pizza was OK. But the ambiance was much more convenient and comfortable for long hour chit chats . Well I loved this place and definitely go there again.

Fantastic decor, great ambience. The perfect place to hang out with friends!
The board games and the choice of books to browse are pretty extensive, and the karaoke singing is a good concept!
did't try the Hookah, but the rest of the food is Fantastic and their proportions are really healthy!
the pizzas are wonderful, (i've tried the pepperoni and the chicken hawaiian)
the spaghetti and pastas are good
the sandwiches are a bit lack lustre, but nothing too bad to complain!
the grilled prawns, fish and other mains are good too
the only dish which is a potential disaster is the Beer Batter fish, terribly oily coating . that's the only bad dish i've had there .
excellent stuff
yes, a bit on the expensive side! But worth it

Unfortunately no photos this time. Went for a very short period. Decent place, cool decor. Full of modern arts. Seating is organized though however not cool as the decor. College going kids around. Small but quite happening. We just ordered a cappuccino and long island tea. Don't know much about the cappuccino  <i don't drink coffee>. The mocktai was very okay. I found it more on the sour side. Not very appealing. However the presentation is pretty nice. Next time I'm gonna try their food too.

If you're living in north calcutta and looking for a cafe where you can sit without ordering hookah(cause hookah section is separate), then its the place you can go to! I loved the interiors and its huge. If you are a bookworm, you'll love this place. So so many books to read and you can buy them too 😏.  The food is okay. Nothing too great but the beverages are good.

Excellent place for hangout. Unbelievably good decorations with lot of options for indoor games and books. Live music is something which takes it to a level above. Food options are quite nice and quality is good. Service should be little faster. I will really visit this place quite often from now.

Talk about innovative decor  , and you have to mention this place. It hits all the right chords with the colourful walls adorned with bookshelves and the ceiling have a design of its own. I found their pizzas delicious. To pass your time , you even have a wide array of board games to choose from.

Nice good ambience with a live band (not sure if they play on week days) !

A perfect place to catch up with friends and family .

But the deco is really good ....got for it guys ...!!!

Well decored cafe. But if u want hookah you'll be shifted to a small room in which AC seems to be in non working condition. Service slow, staffs are rude. Ordered Garden fresh pizza, lasagne, pan supari hookah, strawberry shake. Except hookah nothing was good. All the items are brought 25/30 min after order isn't is fast?? Well first and last visit. Not to be recommended to anyone.

This place has always been my favorite. 
Lovely ambiance, on weekends live music. The food they make here is so good that it'll make you visit over and over again. The main course is a bit pricey. Otherwise the cost for coffee, and other snacks is okay. 
They have a separate room for the hookah lovers. The hookah over here is a bit pricey too. It's around 400. But nothing beats the ambiance here. They have board games and books as well which you can read and spend your time. You can come here and chill as long as you can.

The Terminal 11 is somewhere in salt lake that I would rather let my salt lake friends tell you. We reached the place with a lot of help from google maps and friendly auto kakus. Anyone who reviews the place shall speak of the ambience.
It has a very laidback feel with a stage for live music and board games lying around.
We were pretty full and were just looking to while away some time.
The lasagnia was a 3.5/5.
Bill will be around 1200 for 2 for a 3 course meal.
They give their bill in a cutesy box. Unfortunately the staff has no idea from where they bought said box.
Until the next time.

After hearing a lot of rave reviews and pictures about this place, finally decided to pay it a visit! Loved the ambience of the place! Especially the decor-my fav part was the corner where there were couches with little pillows and treasure-chest themed tables! Loads of books and pictures adorn their walls with a live music set-up!
The service is good.. really friendly. Disappointed with one of the staff though- one of our order items was mixed up!
Coming to the food, we ordered Mint Julep and Green Apple Fizz as Refreshers. Both of these were bang! Loved both.
Then we ordered a caesar salad, chicken spicy cajun rice and the third item we ordered was their chicken breast which they mixed up with the fetuccini pasta!
The salad was great! Extremely delicious with just the right taste. The Cajun Rice was nice, especially the chicken preparation accompanying it!
Coming to the Fetuccini Pasta, it tastes good when you have the first bite, at subsequent bites it does nothing other than ruin your palette and leave a weird aftertaste!
The meal was finished off with a steaming cup of black coffee.
The bill total came upto about Rs 1200 including the service tax.
Overall, nice place with a nice ambience. Worth Visiting! Price is slightly on the higher side as opposed to the food!

5/5 for this awesome cool place. Interiors are cool. They have bean chairs, live screening, books, board games and a day separate area for hookah. Would have got more famous if was somewhere in south kolkata. Its one of its kind in North Kolkata. 

My second visit here - bringing down stars to 4.5. May be because we were sitting in hookah section inside, but it was so damn stuffy, ventilation issue bad, waiters not even giving water if u don't ask for it, plates not given wd food. One good thing that came to know they don't charge for a coal change. And tried terminal special pizza which was yumm. And live singing performance was great too. So if you can let go of hookah, sit outside when live performance going on

Well this place has been making rave reviews for its ambiance and live music throughout the town. I must admit that it has got a nice vibe going inside. Though the concept of spending playful time in a cafe is not new but it was refreshing never the less. 
Well the staff are hospitable, the decor is aesthetically pleasing and the music is soothing (though it was not live music). We ordered for a Cheese Garlic Bread and a Veg Cajun Rice the later being a little spicy yet totally palatable. 
So, I would say a refreshing place to have conversations, enjoy board games and emerging music !!!

I have passed this cafe on my way to college many a times, and finally I visited this today morning with a bunch of college mates. 
*Decor & Ambience*
Truly pleased with how they have decorated the place. There are different kinds of seating arrangements. Sofas, bean bags, high tools,  etc. The entire are has been divided into many sections keeping in mind the varieties of crowd it attracts. Intelligently designed I must say. Those who are going in for hookah, have a separate hookah parlor zone too. Add to all this, there's numerous board games like jenga, Taboo, Scotland yard, monopoly, ludo and almost every other game you have heard of.
*Food* 
Now since I went in the early hours, there was the breakfast menu which I could choose from. I opted for a // Grilled Bacon Sandwich with French fries and coleslaw salad //in the sides.. The sandwich was grilled well, bacon strips were something to die for. I have never had such a great bacon sandwich before. The salad was good. French fries were very crisp. It was a lovely dish. 
Then we ordered Muesli with chocolate milk and maple syrup. A kind of healthy food option, it was nice. In drinks we took a Lichee Blast, which tasted very similar to Pran Litchi drink, I liked it . A cappuccino was also ordered. 
The prices are inclusive of vat but they charge a 10% service tax on the bill, which is reasonable.  
I didn't take any hookah this time, but I look forward to having it here .

Really good decor. The place looks extremely welcoming, a good place to hang out with friends and family. I tried the Margherita Pizza and Virgin Long Island Ice Tea. The pizza tasted fresh, but sauce was a bit too tangy.  The Virgin Long Island tea was refreshing. The open mic bands are an attraction. The band performing on a Sunday evening was not that great. It will make one almost feel nauseous. So, that was a let down. Having said that Id love to go back there and try out something more in the menu with a good band playing some good music. Good concept. Needs some work.

Terminal 11 located in Salt Lake is one of the new culinary experiences in the city of joy. A joy for the bibliophile, it's decoration consists of an enormous book collection. It exudes a very intellectual lounge feel. Terminal 11 is a place with good food and substandard service. It's service quality needs to keep up with its food quality. But apart from from that a place worth going to.

This is one of the best cafes I have been to in town. The ambience is just superb, perfect for today's youth. It's a spacious cafe with a brilliant decor. The idea of having a book shelf, indoor game chest, live music, cafe under the same roof is simply fantastic. Their playlist is soothing. All bibliophiles will have a turn on as soon as they enter the cafe seeing the shelf stacked with books from various authors. They are for sale as well. Then there are the board games to keep you busy. And music is always there. Well now coming to the food, it was really good. We had ordered Chicken Lasagne. The serving had a garlic bread as well. The quantity is apt for two. The black current shake was refreshing in this heat. Pocket pinch is moderate. Overall a brilliant cafe.

Was in the area today so thought of checking this place out. It's a well done up place with lots of space. Sofas,cushions, wooden chests as makeshift tables, bean bags. One wall is aligned with shelves filled with books and mugs and other merchandise meant for sale. This place is known for storing board games, but m sry to say it's not well stacked. U will find many pieces missing from the games or parts misplaced or broken. That was disappointing :-(. We couldn't play battleship or monopoly ncs of this reason. we managed to play some ludo and connect4. Had ordered cafe Vienna and American macaroni n cheese. The Mac n cheese came with a slice of garlic bread and was amazing and filled with cheese.... It was getting difficult to eat so much cheese :D the cafe Vienna is an espresso shot with whipped cream. Had it with some sugar. It ws nice but I guess I didn't get the coffee kick I needed from it bcs it got cold very fast :( maybe bcs it ws kept right below the ac... Nothing to complain about the ambience or the staff... There is also a stage for hosting live music events.Pocket pinch won't be too much if ur out with a few friends... The bill comes in a tin container shaped like a book which I found very cute :)

One of the Poshest Cafe in the Tinsel town.Though not much advertised as it is new.Located in Salt Lake Sector1 near Baishakhi this cafe has some mouth watering chocolate tarts ,Some cheesy penne past and some fingerlicking sandwiches . Ordering one plate will suffice for 2 persons easily as the quantity they served is more than enough.Well litted decor with a couch ..board games are available for you. Since my friend is a Chef there . We availed a special discount too 😉 you can also book if you are planning a private party This cafe satisfied us in all aspects.
 Reccomend all the followers to Visit this.places once.☺

Terminal 11, one of the best decor cafe I've seen recently. I don't think i need to step out of saltlake for awesome cafes.  Located near 5  no tank, near swimming pool this place amazed me with everything. We ordered Margherita pizza, cafe toffee and chocolate milkshake. I must say all these we've ordered are much pocket friendly and with less taxes. You can read books, play there and live music plays there too.

Nicely decorated place situated bang opposite police headquarters near CAP camp, salt lake.
We were just 4 people looking for a cafe to hangout for an hour or so and found this on Zomato! I had been hearing a lot about it lately as well, so decided to give it a try !
To talk about their service, it's really good and prompt. We had ordered the lemon ice tea which turned out to be a little flat in taste. On conveying the same to their staff they made sure they understood what exactly we wanted to be changed in it and so they did. 
As informed by them, they do not use preservatives or flavouring agents in the ice tea. Rather, they brew Assam tea and serve to their customers. If you are a tea lover, ask them to brew it strong otherwise which it might taste bland.
Apart from that we had ordered Garden Fresh pizza : a perfectly cooked thin crust one. Delicious as well.
Hukka was well made too. 

I look forward to visit it again n try their varied range of breakfast items.

Jumped in to this impromptu expecting nice ambience and good dinner..Good ambience...took 30 mins to get the chicken sandwich, rosemary roasted chicken, stuffed chicken...coming to the taste....the chef or whoever operating the oven, otg etc..needs a manual for the same first. Then comes learning for the food. It seems some hotel management college drop out who has failed in his / her first term itself prepared the food..DISGUSTING is the only word. Would rather go to a library to read books and will go to a concert to listen to live band..didnot get any rating less than 1.0..so unfortunate..

After coming across a lot of praises about this particular place, I was quite excited to visit it. But it turned to be a disappointment. The decor was pleasing & the location was quite convinient to reach to. But I would mention that the service was not up to the mark. They delayed with almost each dish that we ordered. The pizza was tasteless. (Guess, the salt was missing). The Lichi blast tasted real bad (if one asks me). But yes, the mixed sauce pasta was delicious so as was the garlic bread. I cannot comment about the hookah cz i am not a shisha lover. My first experince was not satisfying. Hoping to visit the place again to see if my opinion changes.

Though a bit hard to locate,this is one of the better of innumerable joints that throng the area. The ambience is absolutely rad,without trying too hard. This place has something for everyone. From boardgames,to books to occasional live performances.
Coming to the food,the buffalo wings are absolutely delectable and so was the lasagne. However they should up their beverage game a bit. 
The staff is friendly and helpful,sometimes a bit too friendly for comfort some may say. But then that's totally subjective. Overall a good place to chill.

Yesterday visited this cafe for my bday lunch....the interior of this cafe is lovely...with mixed array of posters of musicians and beach babes😉..A glass wall with hand written notes all over...a coffee cup engraved wall decor...a casual and relaxed environment. There are different seating areas...tables overlooking the glass window and besides a book shelf for those who love to read...A separate area for hookah also. The staffs are cordial. Now coming to the food....Ordered simple cappucino(rs.100), Choco frappe(Rs.155) and Cajun-spiced french fries(Rs.145) and a Cottage cheese pizza(rs 390)..bill amount of 870 including 10% tax.
The coffee came with a nice butter cookie. The choco frappe was usual. And the French fries....Oh my God...the best I had so far...it was so crispy and crunchy...perfect shape...perfectly seasoned and spiced. Came with spicy mayo and at Rs.145 the portion size was huge.
Then came the Pizza...big 8-slice thin crust pizza...with bell peppers,olives,sweet corn and paneer pieces and loads of mozarella cheese. Me and my friend couldn't finish it and had to pack the 2 slices.
Overall,the food was of good quality and fresh...they had a nice,concise menu which is easy to choose from. They charge 10% service charge over the prices mentioned in the menu....so you don't get a mini shock on seeing the bill😰
And lastly...I will visit this cafe again and again for those tasty french fries...just hope they remain the same and Terminal 11 never close their business.
I don't know if it was my bday that got me so excited about this place...But they truly impressed me on my 1st visit.
09.5.16...My 2nd visit review...
I went there for breakfast today...The place was completely empty when we entered. We took our seats in the bean bag area. Orderes for Grilled Veg cheese sandwich and French toast with Cappucino and Cafe machiato. 
1st of all...The service was very slow. Our coffee was served within 15mins. I found the machiato to be warm not hot. Then we waited for 30mins considering we were the only customers present. Finally when our food was served....I was shocked to see The French toast as 2 pieces of bread cut into 4 squares served with mint mayo side...at Rs.185 it's simply overpriced. The veg cheese sandwich was grilled properly and came with a side of fries and salad. 
I also ordered their Belgian waffle...it was my 1st waffle tasting...I found it to be a bit over baked. And at Rs.225 I found the portion size small. They charge 10% as tax (instead of 14.5+5%) which in a way is a plus though the prices are on the higher side if you look at it.
Anyways...I like the ambience of this place and will visit again for sure.

Continuing my streak with places that made me happy, I landed up at terminal_11. Located on the Salt Lake first avenue, a few plots after CAP camp island when headed towards Baisakhi, it would be on your right. This happens to be on my daily commute path, and the name and the facade along with the green lighting inside intrigued me.

This was my second visit here, this one for breakfast, a meal that we quite rarely have outside. They have this display outside, saying that they serve breakfast. I entered an almost empty restaurant, barring a couple occupying a table, on a summer morning and was welcomed to some good music playing on. The place was literally chilled. After waiting for some time, I realized that morning visitors are rare and had to ask for the menu. I was impressed with the special breakfast menu with wide options, from cereals, to toast, sandwiches, hot and cold beverages and many other options. I decided on the grilled chicken sandwich with salad and a cup of darjelling tea.

The USP of the place is it's decor. With a large seating capacity and a small separate enclosure for sheesha, they provide wide options. The decor is done well with one section housing board games, a separate book shelf (with books on sale) with wide options adorns one one of the walls. Then there is a small dais with a mic and speakers and guitars ready for a live gig. I am not in the knowledge if they do have live gigs here, but the front section with a pillar decorated with vinyl records it looks like a music cafe. They have done well with playing with different elements like music, books and board games and used them well with the colour green to give this place a young vibrant feel. And for my this particular visit early in the morning, I must make a special mention of their playlist. It was super with jazz and blues and folk genre from the '60s and '70s. I wish I could borrow their playlist.

Now coming to the food, it was presented well. The sandwich was well filled up, grilled a bit too tough, served hot along with a small dollop of salad and lots of fries. I wonder if I had ordered the option of fries instead of the salad what would they have served me. The tea was a fresh brew, flavorful and served hot. One feeling that I get every time am there at a place alone is the lack of options far single portion servings. They served me four sandwiches and it was a lot. Even there pasta (which I had last time) portion is a lot for one person. I hope that places come up with small portion sizes for single serving. At least if the management is listening, the breakfast does need single serving portions. I was there for a long time, as there were hardly any tables occupied, listening to the music. I wrapped up my breakfast with a hot brownie. The brownie was a bit disappointing, it was brittle and the texture did not hold up.

Coming to the other aspects, the cleanliness is well maintained. The prices are on the higher side. The service is quick and the stewards are friendly, but they need to be more attentive to the customers present.

Overall it was a happy experience, especially for the playlist. I would love to come again hopefully for breakfast and wish that they do work up something for single servings.

Happy eating!!!

When you meet your school bench-mate after 6 years and there is a lot of gossip and reminiscence to do terminal 11 is the best hangout. As we reached early in the afternoon we got the best spot on the floor and the choosiest selection of board games. And the bookshelf was my personal heaven. The ambience gets a 10/10 and so does the service. For a bunch of noisy girls the staff was very tolerant. Hehe!! As for the food i have just one complain that the chips served with beer batter fish and chips was over fried and tasted a bit woody. And our bad luck we didnt get chocolate chips pancakes. To end with am going back many more times. This kind of place is what the adda loving people of Kolkata needed. Kudos!!

A very well done up place with staffs who would not be able to guide you with directions on the phone! We took our seats on reaching. The servuce was fast but the staffs were not hospitable. I ordered a cold coffee which overtly sweet, a Irish coffee which was just palatable. A pesto sauce pasta with some stinky pesto and that's about it. Would not revisit!

Location- it is located on the main road between swimming pool island and baishaki island.
ambiance- excellent with innovative decor. Live band performance adds on to its glory.mane sorts of card and board games are available and the bean bags just adds on to its show and comfort.

staff- polite but service time is too long as this cafe is meant for long addas and chat sessions. no one is in a hurry out there. so order beforehand if u have time constraints

food- very much led down by the spagetti with meat balls. chicken pasta with pesto sauce was delicious. we also ordered for apple fizz n cold coffee along with brownie and ice cream. these items are just like other good cafes...nothing exceptional. price is high but keeping in mind of the ambiance,its ok

We ordered chocolate shake and chicken pasta with pesto sauce. The people attending the customers are quite decent and their service was also upto the mark. Keep up the good work!!

I had been hearing a lot about this place and infact being suggested by frnd.
Great place to hangout with frnds, u got many games to play, best place for the book lovers...The most happening part about teminal 11 is THE LIVE SINGING BAND..
Coming to food n drinks, I had there coffee frappe, appy Mocktail n four topping pizza which was good..
The only sad part about terminal 11 they serve hookah in a room which quite boring n not an organised way..

Its a cafe/bistro in sector 1, saltlake. The place is well done with lots of books from writers from east to west and is a perfect place for readers and foodies. The hookah served was okay but pocket pinch was darn high. Food offered was not worth the money actually.

Wow! Complete gem of a place. Bean bags, and low casual settings. Board games and books that you can't even imagine. Decor is perfect. They even have vinyl CDs in the place. Missed out on the live band but better luck next time. Cafe Frappe, Mango Shake and Cottage Cheese Pizza, all was good. Even the service was friendly and quick. Will visit again for sure.

Dear Food Lovers , 

Although this is a special shout out for the foodies living and loving in Salt Lake , i don't think i need to step out of my little city anymore for awesome cafes ! I can land on Terminal 11 ! 
I have nearly tried most of the items on their menu. What i love about the menu is that its concise and easy to decide. I hate it when variety overshadows my choice for what to order. The buffalo wings are to die for ! Love love Loooove the garlic grilled prawns, pasta, lasagne and before i forget -- to the chef of Terminal 11-- youade me fall back in love with lemon Butter Garlic sauce on Grilled Fish. I can have that for breakfast, lunch and dinner EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY LIFE. Although i am not that much into desserts, you must try the blueberry cheesecake and their brownie ! Its divine . 
What is also very nice about this place is that the service staff here is absolutely sweet and caring . It feels like home to me . Most of the times i visit this place with my mom when she comes back from a very tiring day and so do i ! So we just go sit on one corner and sip on some coffee and tea(darjeeling first flush) which by the way is also very good ! 
To sum it up ... I basically love this place ! Thank you for coming to town and lightening all our lives! @terminal11 @lovelytimes

I loved this place. Calcutta needs more places like these. Games and comfortable places to sit in for an evening of adda: quite a pleasant atmosphere. Had the pizza which was a good thin crust one. And the drinks were quite nice! Hoping to visit on a musical evening. 

P.S.: Love the Pink Floyd poster near the entrance, as well as the paper cup goodies!

Great food..lovely ambience...n then..there is live music too...best way to end a week..
This was my second time here and I must say I have not found a single thing abt which I can complain. The quality and the quantity of the food is amazing. New York spaghetti with meatballs is a must try. If one is up for dessert...do have the brownie wit ice-cream..also try the Irish coffee, hot chocolate and blue bull if you are a fan of red bull.

Went to this place, that too accidentally. Initially I had set out to go to Fly Kozina, which is located nearby, but they said it wasn't open and that they don't serve breakfast even when it was written on Zomato that it's open. Anyway their lose became this restaurant's gain and mine too. 

I was totally floored by the decor and ambience of the place. Terminal 11 has fully got it right when it comes to decor. They've got a live music section, a huge collection of books, board games and a huge seating area. They had a very good music playlist too which added to the overall ambience.

Now coming on to the food, I ordered a veg cheese grilled sandwich with some salad and a cafe frappe.

The Sandwich : it was perfect. The butter grilled bread was of perfect texture and the filling was dominated by the flavour of cheese and somewhere maybe a tinge of mustard. I'm not really sure of that thou. Overall it tasted perfect. Even better was thr salad they gave with the sandwich, which was wholesome. Some baked beans wouldve added proteins to it thou.

Cafe frappe: it was good. On the menu, it was given it has icecream in it but somehow i didn't quite get the taste. It could be a bit thicker too.

Pros:
1. Good food
2. Great ambience
3. Lively decor
4. Perfect for a gang of friends meeting up

Cons:
1. Nothing yet ! I'll add if i find something in the next visit ;-)
Great place to visit !

Location: BF Block Salt Lake, beside Salt Lake swimming pool area

Decor and ambience: the decor is by far one of the very fresh and vibrant decors I have seen in a cafe for a long time, the small looking tables and seats can house more than they look they can, there is this whle library of books on wall attached shelves and then there is a diagonally checkered wall
The use of energetic shades of yellow green blue and white add to the glamour of the place

Food and menu: ok what have we got here, we have soups to coffees and lasagnas to fried prawns, what u cn say is a little more than a cafe menu and a little less than a full fledged restaurant
The food I wud say is a bit tricky to comment on, we had ordered a soup, a mocha and a beer batter fish
The soup and mocha impressed me big time but the third part of the meal spoilt what I had liked before, but as they say majority wins so two out of three dishes scoring high shall.hold good for the place

Service: this place has a very nice and courteous staff and they surely makw u feel comfortable and the service time is also quite quick 

Extras: one of those places where u have to tok alot about extras cz it really is more about these
Its a live music cafe wid books to read and buy and games to play alongwith a private hookah section
The concept of live music cafe is a bit absent in our city nd that is where terminal 11 scores big with its soothing music and the touch of hard rock cafes around the country

Final review: do pay a visit wid ur friends and ur partners cz u may not get as gud places as this to hangout wid dem and for the food try and be wise in picking ur dishes

Chheers!!!!

A place to hangout in Saltlake where you get to hear live music along with food and beverages. 
Let me list down the pros and cons of this place as per my first visit with my friends:

Pros:
1) Live music. Good music.
2) Very good ambience.
3) Hospitality worth mentioning.

Cons:
1) Foods are very costly. A plate of chicken cheese sandwich costs 250 bucks. Even CCD doesnt charge so much. 
2) Please introduce booze alongside good food.

The place is in BF block in Saltlake and after repeated attempts to spend an evening here, we finally got our chance yesterday. After office both of us i.e me & my fiance were hungry and decided to visit the outlet. 

The place looks very hip n happening from the outside and it sure didn't disappoint from the inside. The place is the must go place for any and every time you are in the mood for quick bites and are looking to have fun. 

They have beautiful décor and ambience with a book outlet in the premises. The interiors are young and hip and also the crowd is decent. They have board games for the guests to play along with hookah and a delicious spread of quick bites and coffee.

We had ordered the Barbeque Chicken Pizza along with Lemon Iced Tea and Coke. The pizza was a thin crust pizza and it was delicious. I mean I don't mind coming here and having pizza instead of the brands. The serving was generous and one pizza is enough for two people. Also the staff are very polite and friendly. 

I am eager to try the hookah and the breakfast menu at this place. Would definitely visit again and recommend the place.

Wassup fellas?? Hoping that you Foodies are rocking your tinseltown.. Am back from holidaying at City of Joy.. And leme tell you that this city never ceases to amaze me.. So heres my gupshup on Terminal 11!
Terminal 11 located in Saltlake in proximity to my home.. All foodies like the idea of wonderfully beautiful atmospheric restaurant in addition comes perfect food.. I paid a visit to this place on Sunday morning for breakfast.. Was fascinated by the stack of books on the shelf.. This is not it there are loads of games if you are into it.. Just play on while your food is being prepared.. Found a very cute corner with bean bags around.. Plus theres a mini stage for live performers be it band rock performers or be it funny laughter show! To sum it up, the Ambience is perfect culmination of books, games, food, live performers and decor!
Next up is the Food:
Twas English breakfast that i was craving. So heres the list:
Bruschetta: I really dont get the concept of bland tomatoes on roasted toast with some seasonings. I m always wary of ordering Bruschetta but this dish was a knockout.. I loved the way twas prepared.. Must must try it guys! Excellent!
Veg. Cheese Grilled Sandwich: This was just a normal sandwich with lots of veggies..
The Roasty Toast with saunted Mushrooms: This dish was oki dokey.. Felt more like aloo halwa salted and wasnt seeming like proper Roasty.. If one goes by the name in the menu! Mushrooms were not that enticing.. Twas tasting like a pickled mushroom..so please improve on this one!
Cafe Latte: Cafe was okayish..
I wanted more options in vegetarian.. Sadly theres few options in breakfast particularly.. 
Finally comes Service and Pocket Pinch: There was just one staff catering to everybody in the restaurant.. So obvious the service was tad slow.. And it took more time than was required for preparation.. Other than that the staff was courteous! The food is priced moderately.. Do visit this place if one is in Calcutta.. Loved it absolutly!! Also please post in your views on this place and recommendations on more places like these.. Thanks!

It is located in saltlake bf block which is a 5mins walking distance from baisakhi island.

Nice decor and ambience. Different kinds of seating arrangements are available for a smaller group as well as larger groups. A lot of great stuff can be seen on each wall. What caught my eye was a glass wall filled with comments from satisfied customers. One wall had a good collection books as well as board games. You could choose any and spend your time. Even if you don't have anyone to accompany to you, i can assure you that you won't be bored here. Pick up a good book and grab on some sandwiches. Live music is also another attraction of this place.

The service was prompt and was available at beck and call. Even the washrooms were being cleaned at frequent intervals.

I had ordered a mango panna and a choco frappe both of them were a good thirst quencher. They also have a completely separate smoking area. I choose the vanilla and mint flavoured hookah which was up to the mark. You could enjoy board games or live cricket matches alongwith it. From the food menu I ordered the chicken sandwich which is sufficient for 2 served with sauce, salad and potato wedges.

I had a really great time there and assure you that you won't be disappointed too.

This is another good joint in Salt Lake and must say that I had no inkling about it till I heard from my friend who happens to stay close to this happening place!
I was thrilled to try their menu, though short & crisp!
The asparagus soup was awesome, though I would have liked it more hot & piping!The Fish & chips was the most amazing one..........Bhetki dipped in beer batter & served hot on a bed of french fries & rounded it with roasted coffee!
Wow!Worked out for a little lees than 800!

Terminal 11 located in BF 11, salt lake city, Kolkata is lending much distinction to the till very recently quiet neighbourhood.... Now every evening the place is streaming with youngsters and not so youngsters... For some nice chats and decent food and more then anything else... To sit around a plush seat.... Playing board games.... Or perhaps reading a book if you prefer being solitary... The food is decent... Though the fish in our fish and chips was tad over fried and over seasoned... The pepperoni pizza was great!!! The coffee was very average... The Darjeeling tea was good... The virgin long island iced tea was too sweet for my palate and the green apple fizz was just fair.... The entertainment for last evening was stand up comedy... And few young lads cracking goofy jokes.... And trying to be a smart ass... Well it worked... and some were actually hilarious!!!
Pocket pinch is moderate.... It is a great haunt... And I am glad it is so close to my nest!!!!

Situated near CAP camp island, this is one of the best places to hangout for any age group. This place has the most popular board games, bean bag chairs, books for bookworms(and you can even buy some of them) live music on certain days- all the schizz. As for service, the staff is very polite and I totally love the tall glasses they serve water in! Food arrives around 15-30mins after being ordered. The food is good but not extraordinary. Not to worry because the ambience totally ups the awesomeness quotient of this place and you'll leave a happy satisfied customer. Pocket pinch - around 500 bucks. Last but not the least - the lavatories are very clean and smell fresh. Super thumbs up to this place 👍.

Terminal 11 turned out to be a wonderful surprise. It has been a while since I came across a place so bright, alive and throbbing with possibilities. They have somehow managed to inject multiple divergent personalities into the place and yet, nothing is jarring. There are games, books, wine & dine and cafe sections. 

We settled down in the restaurant as we were famished. Cajun fries, cheese garlic bread, fettucini alfredo, cheesy penne with broccoli, a  glorious chocolate shake and mint juleps. Each dish delivered. The portions were adequate though I found the main course a tad expensive. There was a touch of accomplishment in each dish, like they knew they had gone the extra mile and it had worked. Great service too. Why it does not have a higher rating, I don't know. Why I had missed this place so far, I don't know. Well done Terminal 11. Now, please work on the desserts menu :)

Terminal 11 really impressed me on my first visit here, which was on Christmas Eve last year with my gang of girlfriends. The interior decoration is really nice, especially the place where the wall has been made a board-game storage place with the diamond shaped shelves. The bean bags added to the cheerful ambience of that section. They have stacks of books on shelves, and a huge variety of board games, which ensure that you get to spend your time here having loads of fun.

During the three hours we spent here, we whiled our time away by chatting, and playing UNO & Ludo.. The food that we had ordered included a Garden Fresh Pizza and a Veg Sicilian Risotto. The pizza was decent enough, while the risotto was excellent. I had had a Cafe Toffee, which was nice, and two of my friends had had the Chocolate Cappuccino, which they had liked as well.

The biggest disappointment of the day was their Live Music. Live Music is something that should be soothing, with a single soulful instrument being played (with or without a singer). But their version of Live Music consisted of a few guys playing the drums very very loudly, which disrupted our mood and made it difficult to hear what the others were saying. My suggestion to them is to please improve on their Live Music, coz if they do that, then Terminal 11 will be a new hangout place with almost no negatives.

Nice cafe. Decent food, cool decor and the waiting staff is well mannered. We order a french fries and a chicken lasagna(which lacked cheese) for two. Both of us were quite full after the meal.
We went there on the valentines day, there was a live band playing, it was a nice!

Saturday is a must visit for music /stand up comedy lovers.  Avid readers can drop down anytime. Have been loyal towards Irish coffee,  be rest assured you are gonna fall in love with this place if you are coffee person who is tired of regular ambience of ccd and batista.

The place had just opened up when I visited..
Went there in the afternoon and there was nobody else, so we were at our leisure to take any place we wanted to.. We chose the most spacious couches which was for more than 10 people.. We ordered for white sauce pasta and lasagna..
I am very particular about lasagna so I asked the chef to prepare it the best way.. And yes both the dish was perfect.. The staff were very courteous and the place is great.. I am looking forward to visit again cause they have live band too!! Must visit..

The ambience and the food both are awesome.. I never liked strawberries before but the strawberry shake out here was really gud and the mango shake is one of the best i ever had.
We also tried pizzas they were pretty awesome atleast for a change from Dominozos and Pizza Hut.. Garlic bread was just okay. So many board games r their(Frankly i didnt knw how play some of them :p), so many books to read. Cafe is our playground :)
Overall wonderful experience i would recomend you to go out there..

I am a cafe-lover & when my boyfriend took me to this place, I was in love. First the ambience, great place to hangout with friends, u get many games to play, the best place for the book lovers with a small platform for the live singing. Second the food, well.. we just ordered chicken lasagna which was quite tasty & we ordered blue-bull, chocolate milk shake, vanila ice-cream. The quantity is moderately good. My boyfriend loved the blue-bull & he ordered that for 2 times 😁. The foods are well-prepared & tasty too. Third the service, the service was quite good & the staffs are well mannered. Fourth the price, it's a pocket-friendly place.
I loved the decorations, the ambience, the concept of a book-cafe where you also can sit with friends & play games & hangout or read the books & enjoy good music. Sure to visit this place again.

First thing is that the food is really good and well prepared, secondly the place is full of life with books to read, games to play and it even has a small platform for live singing and stand up comedy. You can really enjoy the place with friends & family. The staff is also well mannered and the place is moderately priced. The quantity of food is very good and overall I am very happy. Sure to come back again.

Located in salt lake, this cafe gives good vibes.
I was here with friends for some board games and since we were famished we ordered some food.
Toffee caramel coffee, fresh lime, chocolate cuppachino
The Caesar salad was amazing and the pesto pasta was divine!
We played scrabble and smoked some sheesha and had a pretty good time

Cheers to the concept and food, jeers to the service! The staff needs to be attentive and hospitable.

Amazing place. Amazing ambience. Perfect lighting. Good music. Very beautiful menu and an extremely warm staff. 
I don't know why people write the location and the time of visit. The location is very nice. Thanks for opening up in salt lake, there are very few places which are such good bistros. Will definitely visit again on a day with live music. Overall totally lives up to the hype it has generated. 

Thank you for making such a good pizza and coffee toffee

I really enjoyed terminal 11. The concept of live music and board games really fascinate me. Food is good and I would definitely recommend it to people living in salt lake area to pay a visit here. The board games like ludo and jenga really bring back your childhood days as well.

Discovered this place recently. A much needed book café in Saltlake. The ambience really laid back and cosy. They have a very well stocked collection of books and games. There's a stage for live performances too. Coming to the food. We had Cappuccino, French Fries, Cheese Garlic Bread and Margherita Pizza. The coffee was decent, the garlic bread was good too. The pizza had a thin crust with lots of cheese and a really nice topping. The staff were polite. Considering the really great ambience and the food, I found the place to be very decently priced. Loved the place. Would love to try out their Continental main course, and breakfast soon.

After a few attempts, I finally made it to this awesome place!
The ambiance is amazing, very nice collection of songs and the staff is also very polite n friendly.
Even though the food isn't extraordinary, the ambiance and the collection of games will make you visit the place again n again.
One thing I can't go without saying is that I simply loved the cute lil green bean bags!!

Regards,
A happy n satisfied foodie.

I like the place... love there interior it's excellent... staffs are friendly too... service was also very good... i just think that the music was little loud and due to which the communications of  a large group of young follows, who are enjoying in themselves seems to be a noise to me... however coming to the food, I had there 1. Coffee toffee... believe me guys it's just awesome, perfect blend of coffee, toffee and cream... 2. Caesar chicken salad... very good both in scenes of quality and quantity... and 3. Chicken sandwich... ok type, served with potato wedges and coleslaw... the potatoes are little under fried... my overall experience was good... next time definitely will try there hookahs... pocket pinch here was quite reasonable...

the place is very pretty, no doubt about that....but i didn't like the food at all. Went there with a friend, it was our first visit there. We had ordered for a cheesecake and a brownie with ice-cream & chocolate sauce.
The cheesecake didn't taste like a cheesecake while the scoop of vanilla ice-cream was too small and the brownie, though large yet was hard and seemed stale.
The items were certainly over-priced.

Had a wonderful time at Terminal 11... 

The Location-- is near to my office just a few meters from No.4 tank and Quality more. Very easy location to find for anyone in Kolkata.

The Coffee-- is sensational and there are different choices of beans to choose from, which are of good quality. 
I did not have all of the coffees but most of them... and all are good. Perfect even. 

The Food--  I had chicken ceasar salad, which was one of the best I've had, though I haven't tried all the places in Kolkata but many places for sure, the salad is comparatively of optimal quality. And had barbecue chicken pizza which come in a thin crust and is a tad overpriced, which is still reasonable. It was as decent as I had at more than one Luxury Italian Restaurants in Kolkata.

The Ambiance--  is really nice. All the times I went to attend the live music attraction in the evening. I wish they hosted any kind of events in the daytime as well. Never saw this place in daytime, which I think would look even more pleasant.

The Service-- is warm and courteous. As much as one can expect in a restaurant. 
But one thing.... 
They didn't serve all the order at once at all the times I have ordered, which too was not a big order, but of 2-3items including drinks. What happened with me is they brought out whatever is ready first, and as I went with some company. I didn't have the pleasure to eat and drink together with friends as my order wasn't served yet. My friend offered me some coffee from her cup, which is cool among friends but adds to the awkwardness in a shy date.

The Price-- reasonable to me... worth it!

PS: Washroom worth mentioning--- is most luxurious I have seen in a cafe in Kolkata, but have seen in luxury restaurants for sure. Spacious, deep mirror,, hygienic and super sleek with good lighting.

Why had I never been here before! Im always in the search for a good coffee shop that serves yummy bites and provides some form of entertainment that allows me to get absorbed for a few hours atleast. Sunday evening happened to be impromptu date night, in search of good chocolate milkshake that I had been craving. We came across this place near the swimming pool area and decided to try it out. Cute, nicely done up and the best part were the games and books available for patrons! We grabbed our copies, ordered a milkshake and iced tea along with cajun fries ( since pancakes were unavailable then :( ) and settled down for some good read. The drinks were good and the milkshake better than expected, ticked all the boxes for me! Cajun fries were super yummy, cant wait to go explore more of their menu. Special mention must be made of the live acts that they do over the weekend, we were fortunate enough to listen to Durjoy Chowdhury and were floored with his music and voice! Super amazing! Im going to follow their fb page and pop into terminal 11 next time these guys are up on stage! Ps. The only drawback was that the servers were not very efficient, it took half an hour and 3 prompts to 3 different servers till our glasses of water arrived....! Else the place truly rocks!

Normally I dont do a post partum reviews...but I guess this place needs it. Service as mentioned above wasnt anything to write home about from the get go and now it just plain...for the lack of a better adjective...sucks. A shout out to the T 11 management....your servers need an overhaul badly, forget serving food on time, repeatedly on 2 occassions now I have been served wrong orders...why because they chose not to pay attention when I was ordering. They ignore requests for change of seat and even if you die of thirst they wont get you water. If they do a table of 5 will get a single glass after 35 hours. I see the owners running around constantly trying their service recovery tactics, but seriously is this how you plan to run this place? Let me specify how messed up the servers are.... in a breakfast platter we chose our omlette to be a mushroom omlette, what does he do, gets us a breakfast platter with plain omlette and another order of mushroom omlette insisting that we misordered. The last time around i ordered some grilled chicken misone that is stuffed with spinach et al. I get roast chicken, that to with dry bland pieces of chicken. I had asked for a hot chocolate post dinner. They plonked a cup 2 mins after serving me the chicken. We ordered fish and chips. The fried fish was rotten and fried in putrid oil. Not to mention ive had the worst pancake stack here, that too i ordered plain ones and got choco chips. I mean quality has for sure gone down the drain but how hard is it to lisssten and write it down properly! Its like a constant barrage of wrong orders everytime we go and tht too such poor quality. Restaurants in India need to realise that the average consumer is also much educated about the food he or she wishes to eat, what it should look and taste like, so please dont dish up just anything. Im so sorry, im pulling down my rating for this place because I am super super dissapointed. The rating stays because last time around I thoroughly enjoyed Mokshas performance.

A hidden place located close to city centre 1, this place is a complete package for hanging out with your buddies. The name sounds similar to airport terminals but instead it actually mean computer terminal but however the interior failed to depict why its named so . still the interior is quite spacious and filled with ample of books and games to spend a great time . The foods were also quiet good and tasty . Special mention to the chicken barbequed pizza. Overall nice place with great ambience and food to spend quality time with your gang.

Never had so much pleasure in paying the bill in any restaurant. Fell in love with the ambience and tasteful, functional and effective decor of the place. We seated ourselves at the corner.kids immediately bought out chess and scrabble boards. Ordered some mushroom soup, ceaser salad, lasagne and veg pizzas. Munched on the food while the live music played on.It was a heady combination which hit it high when the crooner bought on Paul Simons boxer. Pity could not get coffee to finish off the meal. A hidden gem in salt lake.

Loved the interiors, the decor specially... the concept of a reading cafe is pretty good.. the live music is fantastic.. the hookah parlour is incredible too... Coming to the food, it is great to taste, and garnished very well... You do not get alcohol here which is great actually.... Would love to visit this place every week from now onwards...

Happy Munchin :)

A new cafe in Salt Lake. Easily accessible. A really cool place to hangout with friends. Loads of books to look into, various board games to play and good quality food. This is just the perfect combination. It's a little expensive though but it has become one of my favourite places to hangout at. Real good service adds to the experience.

Terminal 11 has such an amazing concept that once you go there you would wanna go time and again!
Apart from the delicious food, you have a collection of popular board games(viz Scotland Yard,Uno,Scrabbles etc) to indulge in with your buddies. If that also isn't enough you have tons of books of varied genre to keep you company.
We had gone there for a small college reunion and frankly there couldnt have been a better place for such an occasion. We had ordered Chicken Lasagna, Mexican Chicken Pizza, Strawberry Iced Tea and Lemon Iced Tea. Everything was amazing apart from lasagna which was abit too salty. The staff is very friendly and nice. After finishing our meal we sat for almost 1 hr playing Scotland Yard yet they didn't budge and only helped in enriching our experience 

It's honestly a great endeavour and I wish Team Terminal 11 all the best!

One of a kind cafe with books and music surrounding you.If you are a reader,its your place.
Take a coffee and pick any book you want and read(free of cost).
I went there when it started initially. They used to serve only coffee then but now they have improved their menu and a lot of things are there to offer mostly pizzas,pastas and other snacks.

For some gathering, hangout with friends or sometime for your own...visit it.Its now super awesome but you will surely like it.
Try the coffee and yes..books too

Visited terminal 11 with friends for lunch. It is located near Salt lake Swimming Pool. To start off the place was really well made and the ambience was quite good. We ordered Veg Quesadilla for starters. It is a must try. Really good combination of vegetables, sauces and cheese. For starters we ordered Veg Lasagne and a mixed sauce pasta both were really good. I would say the place is definitely a must try. One suggestion though that the staff need a little more training. Though courteous they are not able to help with the menu or serve properly.

A great place for book lovers. They have a huge collection of books and the prefect seating to just relax and read books.
Also they have live music performance once in a while.

Terminal 11, in Sector 1 Salt Lake brings along a new twist to the list of the numerous Cafes appearing in Salt Lake. There is a fair chance you could miss this cafe as it is not located in any of the corner plots. 

The unique characteristic about this cafe is the decor and the interiors. You don't usually get a "cafe with a theme", do you? The entire shop is designed around an electronic chip (look up the ceiling, and you'd know what I'm talking about). There is a cool library and a game corner as well. So you could borrow a book or a board game and enjoy with your coffee. 

The choice of coffee is good here, my most favourites being the Cafe Cappuccino and the Cafe Machiato. 

Sandwiches are quite fresh, as they serve it absolutely fresh (instead of the wrapped sandwiches you find in your usual cafes). 

I'd highly recommend this to anyone in and around Salt Lake. The interior itself should make you feel the difference.

The ambience was very good and since we entered the place pretty late in the night, at about 10pm, so we had the place to ourselves. I really like the decor, the way the books are stacked up and the collection of books. The presence of board games made it fun. We play jenga! The coffee was ok and I liked the Mac n cheese. Since we were the only ones there the service was prompt and the servers looked genuinely happy serving us. All in all, we needed this kind of a cafe in Calcutta and finally it is here in a rather calm and peaceful locality but they can do well by improving the food.

I wanted to write a review while I was sitting there.

I loved the live music. And the food (always judge a place by their soup). Loved the little biscuits they serve with tea.

AND THE BOOKS. OH MY GOD.

FOOD + MUSIC + BOOKS = WIN.

5 star rating for the books and the really nice staff.

P.S: A BIG thank you for letting me buy a book which wasn't even on sale. I owe you guys big time :')

Also. Put up the full menu on Zomato. I was of the opinion that you guys lacked a good menu and only have vegetarian offerings, looking at the Zomato menu.

To begin with, people may find it dificult to locate this place especially the ones who are not "saltlake-friendly". Otherwise the place is really cool enough! The food is great and so are the beverages. They have the best green apple fizz in town. I can bet you on that! The prices are higher than the other usual cafes! Infact quite high! But the decor, the staff, the place overall you can really go to if you just want to kill time particularly in the afternoon. You wont find another soul but you. Probably the best place for ones who love to spend with themselves :D

My working place is nearby to d cafe,so i went there when they started n again recently. yes,their ambience is good sumhow hatke. but many people i was watching,didn't like the performer wid guiter,it was some kind of noise pollution to them may b. Definitely it breaks d privacy,very few people pay attention to d music.
now in food part, o always try cold coffees n compare those items mentally with CCD. I really didn't get d thickness of coffee flavour in cafe frappe or in cafe toffee. For food items i would rate more...vegetarian lasagna is price worthy. but what they gave description for cheese shots,i didn't find anything good. it was a type of cheese pakora....no good quality of cheese inside. French fries r avg type. If u r alone,go there,ur time ll pass finely,but if u want a bit silence around,its not d right place.

I am always a cafe-lover. & Salt lake is nearby place of mine. So when my husband found this junction, he took me over there. I like the name very much.

Ambiance is good, rather it attracts me so much. I always like a book-cafe as I am a book and coffee worm. The price is reasonable as per the place. Dishes are tasty too. We had Pasta, French Fry, Cappuccino, and Hot Chocolate. the last one was just yummy.

Service and behavior are also very good. I surely want to go there once again.

I had heard about this new place called 'Terminal 11' with a great ambience, since then i thought of visiting the place. When I actually went there it lived upto my expectation. It was a cozy and comfortable place, there isn't a lot of variety in food, though whatever is there is good. They have a live performance at 7 (if I remember right). I went there with my friends and spent 3hrs playing games and munching. It is a great place if you want to just chill with friends.

This cafe has an upmarket feel and the live music setup and the entrance was attractive enough to plan a evening adda with friends. But what followed was disastrous. We ordered flavored iced tea which was just syrup water. On asking, the waiters had no clue but were at least courteous enough to replace them. The cafe mocha had no chocolate in it. We left in haste dropping the idea of ordering any food. Salt Lake has much better options than this. As incredulous as it may sound this is probably worse than the ever growing chains of CCD outlets. Disappointed.

The place looked quite interesting from outside with it's vibrant colours and a grand entrance. The decor of the interior is very nicely done with shades of green and white. The bookshelves with various books from different genre looked interesting along with various indoor games. The dias where band performance takes place is just near the entrance and gives a good feel on entering. That's about it. All the good things end here.
 Too much importance has been given to the look and feel of the cafe,  whereas the two most crucial aspects of running a food joint has been ignored completely. Food quality and service. One word to describe both is 'Pathetic'. We ordered for cheese garlic bread caramel sin and a cappuccino. There was no tissue paper kept on the table. We had to ask for tissues couple of times. The garlic bread tasted average and there's nothing special to mention. Normal bread loaves were cut in triangular shape and served with cheese on top. There was no chilly flakes provided. Again we had to ask for it.
The worst experience I had here is when the waiter served me the caramel sin coffee. First he held the mouth of the cup with his fingers instead of holding the handle. This shows that he's not a trained waiter who serves in such places. Secondly the waiter put the cup on the plate in which I was having the garlic bread. I mean how could he do that??? You are serving coffee and you do not have a saucer with the cup. Later on telling him the waiter gets me a saucer. Oh wait the ordeal doesn't stop here. The waiter forgot to serve us the sugar container along with the coffee. Again we got it after asking. Drinking The caramel sin coffee and cappuccino was a sin in the true sense... Home made coffee is much better than what we tasted here. And the worst thing was the pinch in the pocket after all this. Paying Rs. 500 is not a big deal but paying for such pathetic food and service really pricks me. The management should really take some measure in providing customers with satisfactory food and service at least if not a great one. It's hard earned money we go to spend on some relaxation in such places... The owners should really not take customers for granted.
Very unsatisfactory experience is what I can describe about this place.

A one of a kind cafe in Kolkata.... Completely different from all those similar hookah cafes... One would just want to sit there the whole day with their such a positive Ambience... Their Cafe Toffee and garlic bread is to die for and an added advantage is they host a stage for live performances from various artists...

This place scored all its points because of its ambience, being different, live shows and the energy... Beautiful place with amazing interiors.. Its one the first young crowd oriented cafe in Kolkata which intends to attract intelligent young crowd of saltlake and all around.. The food with the desserts need to improve because the ambience and shows can only attract so much..

Place is very nice but then not much variety or options to choose from the menu. Staff is quite slow. Will turn up for a cup of coffee mostly.

A newly opened cafe that been said I'm waiting to see/try out there food items because as of now the fooding is not that good so I hope they intend to change there menu soon (physically and figuratively)! 
The coffee is well made , the thickness of the foam is just perfect so well done for achieving that. 
The decor is extremely good , a complete pleasure to sit and enjoy a cuppa 
This cafe has the capability to be grand , I hope they achieve it . 
We finally got a decent cafe in salt lake so thank you very much ! I ain't have to drag my hubby across to 8th day for my coffee cravings! Lol.

Good ambience, good food though the menu is very limited. Egg on toast is different here and very very nice.  I often go to this place with friends and play scrabble. A nice peaceful cafe.

I went to this place with a friend. Located on the main road. Just after entering one will find this place a lot different than other cafes. There r tons of books to rid from and also they are board and cards games that one can play. Great to hang out with frnds. If anyone is a FRIENDS fan, thia could be your Central perk!! We ordered coffee and they were good. Pricing was moderate and cheaper than ccd

While it's good to finally see a non-chain, non-CCD coffee shop in the area, Terminal 11 is a little confused about what it wants to be (coffee shop, restaurant, live performance space, library, hookah bar, video game lounge), and they've had a few ups and downs since they've started.

Ups: Great cold coffee, very consistent. I've had these several times. Haven't tried their protein shakes yet, but this is probably the only place in town that serves them. Spicy french fries in honey mustard are good to munch on if you just need a snack. 

Downs: There was a hair in my pasta. A pizza we tried was far, far too spicy, to the point where it wasn't enjoyable (I was with a friend who has a much higher spice tolerance than I do, and she agreed). 

Overall, they've got potential, but they're not 8th Day. We'll see how it goes; I'll likely be back when I'm in the mood for a cold coffee and don't feel like leaving the neighborhood.

A nice and clean place. Catchy interior and comfortable seatig arrangement. A break from blues and reds. Green light rocks. Service was fast. Staff was friendly. We ordered cheese shots, lasagne, Mexican rice. Cheese shots were nice, lasagne could be better and mexican rice taste a nice blend of kidney beans n rice served with spicy vegetables in some gravy. We tried cafe toffee, a blend of cold coffee and caramel. That was superb. All in all, a nice place to hangout and chill. You also have a book shelf and some indoor games. A special area is designated in the cafe for the same but that was full throughout. A place that is recommended, uf you want to spend quality time with friends.

Now this is an interesting joint. It tries to bring in different worlds together. The decor is uplifting at the same time it's calming. Great use of props like the guitar station and the library with bean bags.

However, the only thing I'm interested in is the food. The coffee bit has me enthralled because this place has an amazing variety of beans that you can choose from. 

Aditya Agarwal take a bow. You have done good. The food menu has been revamped and I ENJOYED the dishes I ordered.

Just one feedback, cut down on the mayo in the caesar's salad and throw in crispy bacon bits as a garnish. This should enhance the textural appeal.

Personally I would provide something like an all day tapas platter or a munchies buffet all day at a portioned price.

This place genuinely has great potential to be one of the most sought after hangout places in salt lake. All it needs is a liquor license, an improvised and refurbished menu for more nibbles you usually get at a pub and a slightly less cluttered interior. Great job with the mini stage for various gigs. Decent food, but quite "jugaadu" in the approach (I mean, its not that difficult to prepare most of the nibbles you have by a slightly trained cook). Good staff, but not quite knowledgeable about a lot of stuff. Good coffee menu, but again something that can be easily nipped up at home. Also, a better looking menu card that compliments the interiors is really needed right now. Other than these, good luck with turning yourself into a celebrity location in salt lake! Again, kudos to food entrepreneurs!

A new book cafe in town..

Catchy, green coloured interiors. Full of books. They have some amazing collection. The couches add a homely feel.

Very new. Hardly a month old. It seems the kitchen has not started functioning yet. The food and beverages options were very Ltd. Tho the service was good. They were seeking feedback.. If they improve their kitchen, the place is gonna b a hit.

The decent rating is fr d concept and the potential. Beginner's luck.

For a group of friends who are looking for a good hangout place, this is an option... The interior and the decoration was really up to the mark.. Keeping up with the theme, the music they played was good and doesn't disturbs your chit-chat, infact starts a conversation or two... The coffee, its aroma and the presentation will make you love this place.. However, as good as they were with the coffee, the lasagna didn't do that well.. It tasted good, but quite not what we can expect from authentic lasagnas. Didn't try much from the menus, but maybe they can improve some of their dishes.. The service and the staffs  were an excellent bunch.. Overall, pretty good café

Nowadays cafe in saltlake is opening all with shisha, this one is exceptional. Loved the concept of the cafe. Coffee are too good. You can get books to read. Flavors they make it by their own, nothing artificial... One of the manager told about these. Food was delicious. Quality and quantity both were served nicely. All type of crowd can visit, kids--teenagers--elders--old people. We had ordered for cajun French fries, Veg. Lasagne, Veg. Cheese sandwich, coffee toffee, lemon ice tea. Worth visiting here.

Terminal 11
It is located in BF Block of Saltlake City particularly near swimming pool .its a coffee parlour with fast food as foodies..Their ambience is their USP.
As soon as you enter the cafe the lightining and the book and cd shelf will attract you..They have kept the Cd of old movies &Old Songs as their display and those kinda work as an attraction of the cafe as you move forward you can see a small podium which as explained to us by the owner is being kept for live performances which keeps happening over there like comedy shows and live music.You can see a very beautiful guitar which is being kept over their for the live shows & is giving a nice look to the cafe.
Again as you move forward you can see book shelves where several books are being kept which is for sale ..
They have a seperate section beautifully designed with couches and bean bags for the young crowd which is called a library section where you can sit chill out with you friends and read your favourite novels..
Again you have several games kept in this section where you can play scrabble,chess,housie,LUDO housie and several other games ..
Coming to the food we just went their for coffee and they suggested us to try CHOCO NADO when asked for their speciality.It was a nice coffee with choco chips and cream just like cafe frappe of ccd.But the taste was quiet different from the regular CCD,which is their plus point..
Overall had a great experience..
This is a different place then a normal CCDs & it may attract coffee lovers to visit the cafe again and again because of their amazing ambience.

Visited there thrice and below are my observations : 1st visit - (a) thumbs up for the deco but felt some places especially the book shelves were vacant . (B) the staff was courteous (c) thumbs down to the menu card which was only print outs of the list of food and drinks  ( c ) cafe is not running to full fledged in terms of food (d) they asked for a ₹ 10 change at the time of billing.

2nd visit : (a) very noisy environment (b) long wait for the ordered food and meanwhile the staffs are not trained enough to offer glasses of water (c) when our food arrived which was a garden fresh pizza , we have to keep searching for the staffs to help us provide seasoning , plates and cutlery .(d) the staff were unable to talk in English or understand the language (e) we have to again look for the staff for drafting our bill.                                                                       

3rd visit : At 11 am on 7 th September we were there but to our surprise the shutters were down . We were a group of 7 ladies and we literally made an effort to woke up the support staffs of them.  The staffs were not keen enough to allow us the space to sit and were constantly stating the excuse that the AC is not on and the cleaning has started just now . So we headed to another good cafe in salt lake which actually maintain their timings .  

Note : if it names terminal 11 they should set the table by 11 am. Would suggest not to include hookahs .

In one word...Dissapointing.

Access: On the main road, so finding the place and access is easy. Adequate on-road parking.

Decor: According to my personal opinion, its overdone, with too many things ( concepts) thrown into the floor area. Overlit and an almost non-funtional AC when we visited.
80% of rack space (allocated for books, CDs and games etc) were empty.

Food Quality: Ordered for 2 Espresso Double Shots and a Latte.
Latte was okay'ish.
However the 2 Espresso Doppios were served as 4 single shots. Strange.
The quality of coffee was just about average, considering the positioning of the Café.
The complimentary cookies were nice though.

Service: Average...however wish they were a little more aware of what's what and what's available and what's not.

Caution: On receiving the bill, it was observed that Extra is charged on account of two heads, namely "Tax" and "Services".
HOWEVER, the Bill neither carried the VAT or Service Tax Registration Nos.
The calculations also ddnt match....
So kinda feel Unscrupulously Ripped.

Shall I ..go back again..?
Well NO for sure.

Visited this place today, they've taken part in Dineout's new offer of 50% discount but were not wanting to give it. 
After a lot of argument they gave it, however they have a huge wring thing in their billing, they are charging tax on gross amount and not on discounted amount. 

According to the federation of restaurants tax should be charged on discounted amount and not on gross amount, which is very wrong.

If you are planning to hook up and have a nice chit chat with your loved ones this is the best place to be in. I just loved the ambience and the music was good the place is very well decorated and i found it very innovating and the concept is very promising only thing that I would suggest is to bring up some fusion of nice munchies and other dishes. Otherwise a perfect place for reunion......😀😀
