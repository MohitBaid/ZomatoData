The only thing eatable(!) here is the biriyani. Rest everything absolutely bogus. The attitude of the man at counter is disgusting. Oversmart and rude. No doubt it goes empty most of the time.

I am visiting this restaurant since childhood with lots of memories. This restaurant serves the best best chicken tandoori in town. I tried tandoori in lots of places this restaurant makes the perfect one with proper grill timing and soft chickens. Better refrain from ordering biryanis but other item are mouth watering. Moreover this is a really budget friendly restaurant.

This place is very close to my house and I have been going here since my childhood. This place is located very close to the tollygunj metro station, very easy to locate. It has very less seating capacity, can accommodate around 20 people. Majorly famous and good for takeaways. Rolls, mughlai paranthas are good . Intact one should try the mughlai paranthas of this place. Apart from that, biryani, breads like tandoori roti, naan, etc, kebabs are average, and one can try them because they are pretty affordable.

Located near tollygunj metro, opposite to uttam kumar statue. As my office is in behala, I go via tollygunj and I pass this restora every day. I have eaten their rolls and biriyanis unlimited number of times. This saturday, I ordered for a chicken roll (because it is manti's special) and it was very tasty.¬† All the items are really good. Must visit place for roll & biriyani lovers and yes, the hole will be very small in your pocket.

Manti has been my all time favourite place to have biryani. Whenever I have biryani craving my go to place is Manti. Moreover the people working there are very cordial and amicable. Manti definitely deserves a thumbs up from my side. But, because there is always room for improvement for all the things, I have rated it as 4.5. Maybe they can improve on their interiors

Located in Tollygunge and is probably one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata. The ambience is nothing fancy and the sitting arrangements are average but the food here is really good especially the rolls, biryani and the kebabs. So if you want to satisfy your tummy with a good meal and if you are a fan of North Indian cuisine then this is the right place for you.

Being a resident of tollygunge, i have had the chance to dine in Manti numerous times. Like most other mughlai joints, it has the same issue which is 'dalda' / 'vanaspati'. Their chief cooking medium is dalda, be it biryani or chanp or even rolls. It only tastes good till they are hot; but once it loses its warmth, it feels really bad on the tongue.
Have had biryani, chanp, rezala, chicken tandoori, kebabs and tikia on many occasions. It's okayish.
Have had all the rolls on the menu. Worth a try, if u dont mind having dalda.

Their rolls and biriyani are quite famous, and at times ,people stand in queues to buy their rolls; tandoori roti and dal makkhani do taste good too!!!

Needs to improve to stay a chance playing the game !!!

An excellent Biriyani place right on Tollygunge and super access-able.¬†
My favourite from this place is, Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Roll and Mutton Kasha.¬†
One of the best places in Kolkata, according to me.¬†
If I am sad, angry, happy, excited, tensed or nervous, Mutton Kasha and Tandoori Roti from this place calms me down.¬†
Visit this once in your life.¬†
The place is very basic and no air conditioning and no fancy waiters, they will make you feel like home.

I had been here once and that too some time back. So I have to write about it mostly from memory.
My friends and I had mutton biryani along with mutton kosha and let me tell you that it wasn't disappointing at all. The portions were quite enormous. The meat chunk was a large one with a healthy layer of fat which was simply a delight for me. It also had an egg and an aloo which are all the more reasons why I liked the biryani as much as I did. The mutton kosha too had a very dense earthen flavour and had the perfect dark, brown colour and a very thivk and oily gravy.
I have not had the opportunity to dine there again but I'd love to given a chance to do so.

Had their chicken roll and paneer roll on a hungry tired day. The chicken roll was bad and completely pissed me off. My friend with me tried the paneer roll which was unusually costlier than the chicken roll and didn't taste good either. Also, they kept us waiting for quite some time, around 20-25 mins for the rolls. Altogether, a really bad experience.

A quiet little place opposite tollygunge metro station. If you are looking for a fancy restaurant then this is not the place for you. I have been seeing this restaurant since my childhood but never got the opportunity to dine here. So finally thought of giving it a try.
The decor is nothing to mention about, just basic decor, some tables and chairs. It has got a open kitchen which was kinda unique. Ordered tandori roti and mutton masala. The roti was soft and perfect and the mutton was also quite good. Heard a lot about their biriyani so will give it a try soon.

Went to this place today, ordered Tandoori chicken, chicken biriyani, butter nun and chicken handi kebab. The tandoori chicken was quite tasty, the chutney was tasty too but a bit too sweet. The nun was very heavy and fulfilling, the handi kebab was not so good in taste, just average, the chicken pieces being small. Atlast the biriyani, it was okay, the rice was not so good in quality but okay at this price, the chicken piece they gave was horrible. It was really bad and bony, wish they would just improve the quality of their biriyani a bit. :/ Overall had a nice experience.

P.s. their special chicken roll is veeery yummy!

A place located very near to tollygunge metro station.It was once a specialist for biriyani.But recent visit to this place was utter disappointment.I had mutton biriyani and chicken masala.Mutton piece could have been more cooked as it was very hard to chew.The potato in biriyani was not boiled properly.Chicken masala tasted pathetic and both of dishes were very oily.Quantity is less.Only plus point is their cheap price for the dishes.

This place hold an eyeconic importance..although its been long since I went there but I believe a special mention should be main in the gastro diaries while living in south Kolkata,manti's chicken rezalla still hold the aroma and succulence very much still fresh in my minds eye and in my palatine memory,the biryani does it right by it too..its cheap busy bustling and tasty that's what food in Kolkata surmises as!

Once popular for its biriyani..this place has seen a downward curve over years..well i used to visit this place time and again in the past..based on the recent visit..i would say..the mutton liver curry was the only item i liked from this place..the chicken biriyani was not at all up to the mark..the potato was undercooked.the chicken was very fibrous..the rumali rotis were as usual..

Have been here a hell lot of times as there was a time when Manti was considered to be among the most decent biriyani joints in tollygunge. Anyways gone are the good old days. I have tried various dishes on offer here like chicken biriyani, mutton biriyani, chicken rezala, chicken chap, reshmi kabab, even some of the rolls. I will only recommend this place if u are in tollygunge for some work etc and you are really hungry you can try this place out. Go for the biriyani or rolls.

This is the place, very close to my residence, from where I would always prefer to order Biriyanis and Kebabs and other tandoori items. Frankly speaking, they have maintained the taste of Biriyani and Kebabs over the years, when there used to be no other places like Aminia and Zeeshan in the vicinity. And the pocket pinch is also relatively low without compromising for the Royal taste. Try out anything from here, Manti would not dishearten you. Never. The staffs over here are very polite, and experienced.
The only drawback for which I have deducted points is that the place becomes stuffy during summer days, and its high time Manti needs to install an AC for better comfort of their customers. Nevertheless, Kudos to Manti. You will always be special in the South Kolkata region.

I took a stroll down memory lane yesterday as I stepped into Manti again after a long time. Being close to my college, it was one of my favourite hang out place. We ordered two mutton biriyanis. I was initially reluctant as I did not have fond memories of their biriyani. But, the biriyani was great and can give Dada Boudi's hotel and Aminia a serious run for their money. In fact, Manti was far better than them. The mutton piece was also very soft and succulent. A little work on the mutton is needed and they are all good to go. I did not find the potato that tasty. I noticed considerable improvement in their biriyani. Recently they have started charging VAT. I would not recommend their rolls as their dough is not properly prepared. But do try their mutton biriyani, you will love it.

One of the most budget friendly places I know. Also, delicious food. Tollygunge has become a frequently visited spot now and I really cannot jot down how many times Manti has been to the aid. I'm very much fond of their biryani and kebabs.
Price is very reasonable.
Keeping in mind the good food at less price, I'd ignore the seating area. Recommended if you're low on budget.

If you want good quality biriyani , this is the place you should visit. Moreover, the kebabs are just way too good.
 But the quality of meat and chicken served ¬†in the chicken and mutton section as in the men card are not so good. More over for some couple of visit they are also lacking in the menu card section. A slightly off bit order is not available with them though those things are there in the menu card.¬†

Good quality food at a very reasonable price. However not a very good pace for dining. It's always better to take parcel and enjoy the kebabs at home. It used to be our Biryani destination 10 years ago when Biryani was not available at every corner of the road. They are consistent about the good quality and taste throughout these years and I believe they will continue to be so.

If u have planned a romantic date or a nice family dinner outside this is not the place to visit... But if its just about the food, and if you r up for a fun party at ur place with friends grab a handful from this restaurant and u won't be disappointed.. the quantity and taste they provide for such cheap prices are remarkable. The tandoori chicken is really good and so is the naan with mutton kasha... For mutton liver lovers they have this gravy dish made of mutton liver which is good... The biriyani is average..but overall a great place to visit for good food... preferably take it home guys and u would love it

After eating here, I was a bit surprised to see a few negative reviews of this place to be honest. Guess everyone does not have the stomach for spicy food. Yes that's what they have to offer. The biriyani I heard is famous, so tried it. It tasted fantastic, a bit spicier than most others. Loved it.... the mutton in it was great, tender, well cooked.... the kolkata biriyani's heart throb Aloo tasted pretty good and well cooked as well. Some places mess up the aloo. The rice was textured okay, only thing that can be bettered is that it was way too greasy, dalda if I am not wrong. Now, coming to the tikka kebab, absolutely brilliant. The spices, the taste they were perfect. Again, if you are not into spicy food, you probably wouldn't like it. It is filled with spices and made my friend gulp a lot of water afterwards. I loved it, definitely worth a try. A moderate rating as there wasn't anything what you would call an ambiance, very congested.
In a nutshell, definitely a place worth eating at.

This week ...this is second time I am adding a bad review...so , let me put it simply...biriyani is a food loved in Bengal and found everywhere ...there might be more biriyani makers than chai walas in Kolkata.
And there are some really good ones. This one's not.
I could have spared if it tasted good too... Or maybe again it's not my taste. Too much dalda ...it's mostly kewra that you get for spices, while you munch.
Sorry guys but I couldn't help. I have had better Street side biriyani. And there is no need to add pics.

Okay , I know I'm very critical with rating .. But the place ambience is not good .. There's an man there , who's a waiter .. He's always rude for no reason .. :3 they boy who sweeps the floor , cleans the floor with phenyl all the time , so its like we have to see the floor getting cleaned and take in our food .. The phenyl stinks. Whatever , I've tried out malai kabab. It tastes good , the chutney is quite good . we also had an egg chicken roll as we've heard that the place is well known for the rolls it serves.. The roll was okay ..nothing special.. We requested the man quite a number of times to add chilly and ketchups when we gave the order , but the man didn't convey our message . -_- whatever , the only goof thing about manti's is the kababs are good , and the rates are really low.

MANTI....a food joint eligible to satisfy your hunger prangs while avoiding a major pocket pinch. Food is average and they really need to work on their service. Sitting is absurd. They pull in chairs from another table to accommodate an unknown person or gang with you just because the later is not getting a fair share of the fan (its a Non A/C restaurant by the way).Just a hint of warning....order salad.....they bring it to you on a plate.....squeeze a fat lemon wedge on it without you asking.....sprinkle salt & pepper on it....and as you are about to thank the guy....mixes up the ingredients with his bare hands...!! Would recommend to take away the food rather than having it on spot. But I must admit, the rolls are really GOOD if you overlook the oily part. Chicken Handi was delicious but the Biryani was a bit dry and lacked flavor. Tandoori roti was really good and goes well with most of the side dishes.

PROS:- Cheap & affordable. Fast kitchen to table service. Proper quantity of food. ¬†Rolls. Perfect for takeaways.

CONS:- Ambience is odd. Service is too casual. Sitting comfort is a concern. Personally did not like the hygiene.

A very, very old place in Tollygunge mostly preferred for the Biriyani. However their Biriyani is a little to oily and spicy for which they've become my second preference now coz of another famous Biriyani joint nearby which is way healthier than this place. The bread spread is mostly North Indian, sides are tasty, like spicy oily and tasty. However, to each their own and I guess I still prefer this place for Biriyani many a times. It'll always remain an 'Old is Gold' for me. Peace. :)

Manti..located across the tollyganj metro station...serves good tasting mughlai dishes at reasonable prices..starting from biriyani ..to chaaps or kebabs..manti is the first name that comes to mind when a tollyganj localite decides to order food from a nearby mughal restaurant.. Variety of kebabs r their specialty along with biriyani..Portion size is generous and fast service...Only complain about their food is that it's prepared with dalda (if I'm not wrong).because of which the food here is quite rich.

"Manti restaurant" happens to be one of the oldest restaurant of Tollygunge, and a noted landmark of the area as well. In fact every resident of Tollygunge is well aware of this place.
Located bang opposite to the Uttam Kumar Statue, outside Tollygunge metro station, this restaurant is a crowd puller because of its locational advantage and its acquired popularity, being an old establishment of the area. The interior is very ordinary and it is a Non AC place. Adding up to it, the live kitchen inside adds heat and smoke whiffs to the dining area, being situated right in front of it.
So if you are okay with a college canteen kind of ambience, you can chose to dine in, or else it is advisable to pack your food as take away.
However, the food is tasty for sure. In fact Manti is popular for its delicious Biryani and other tasty dishes, specially the non veg ones. The service is prompt, and the price is absolutely reasonable.
Though some of their dishes contain an excess of oil which may disappoint the health conscious segment. But that does not affect the taste anyway, and people looking for a tasty and sumptuous meal at reasonable price will not regret eating here.
Happy eating!!

Been a great fan for many years now.small eating joint which needs for cleanliness and tidiness.apart from that the food is quite good.liver curries are awesome.. a bit spicy but cheap on pockets. Biriyani is also rich in flavours along with tender meat.lastly the kebabs are too good.

A place I've frequented since school days - Manti has been a lifesaver for students and working individuals around Tollygunge for a long time. Mouth watering food, prompt service and easy on the pocket - It has always been a wonderful gastronomic journey and still maintains it's old charm albeit the quality, in my opinion, has taken a minor detour recently. Manti has always been one of my favorites for a quick bite or a heavy meal at throwaway rates around this area. It's just an eatery and don't expect fancy dine-in quality, ambiance or service! I'm writing about the most recent experience which left me slightly disappointed, unlike other times.

I usually opt for rolls, mutton tikka, chicken liver or other gravy dishes paired with tandoori roti or lachha paratha. More often than not, I leave satisfied. This one time I opted for biriyani and reshmi kebabs along with mutton tikia.¬†I was disheartened - The biriyani does not taste anything similar to what I remember and the reshmi kebab was not at all up to the mark. It was extremely chewy and dry, contradicting my memories of amazing reshmi and tikka kebabs they used to serve once. Based on this experience I would recommend first timers to avoid biriyani and stick to gravy items or quick bites.¬†

Service is extremely quick, the staff is friendly but don't be alarmed if you find them being more prompt with service to regulars.¬†

I have been frequenting Manti since I started going to college and ¬†would end up eating chicken rolls from there atleast thrice a week. This is a place which has no a.c or an ambiance as such and it is just an eatery. If there is a rush, you might end up sharing your table. I like their chicken biryani and kebabs a lot. The chicken handi kebab, one of their boneless chicken gravy dishes is worth a try. The servers ¬†are really polite to regular customers who often leave behind tips but its better to not expect very good service if you are a first time visitor. They don't serve cold drinks but they will it for you from the nearby shops if you ask them.

I have had manti's exquisite Biriyani a few times before, but today it was awesome. Ordered chicken tandoori which was very tasty but a little too small. The tandoori rotis were very soft and went well with chicken handi kebab and the biriyani was undescribable. Would really recommend it to everyone. Deducted half a point for their lackluster service. They really need to improve it.

A congested yet reasonably priced eatery is Manti. Situated exactly near the gate of Tollygunge Tram Depot, this has been a place, I have been visiting for years. Although I am a vegetarian, still prefer to have egg dishes, fast food like Egg roll is pretty good. Apart from rolls, there is a decent menu and varieties of foods for the liking of non vegetarians. There is lesser varieties available for vegetarians. The ambiance is extremely stuffy, and that maybe a concern during summers but nevertheless, it is worth trying.

Manti is famous for its delicious North Indian cuisine at Tollygunge area. I visited the restaurant twice. First time i went there around 11.30 A.M.. I  ordered Tandoori Roti, Palak Paneer and Salad. They said paneer was not prepared yet. Salad was not ready also. All they could provide were tandoori roti, daal fry and onion. Taste wise the food was okay. Second time I went there and ordered biryani, chicken handi kebab and salad. Fortunately this time, they were able to serve my order . The biryani was very tasty and the kebab was finger licking good. Over all Manti is not a bad option when you look for a Biriyani joint at Tollygunge area.

I've been here since my childhood days! When mum decided a non cooking day, manti came to the rescue. The biryani they serve and it tastes the best with mutton tikka! I've always been a fan of their spicy mutton tikka. The chicken reshmi kebab is tenderly soft and flavourful. The green (hariyali) kebab has a dash of green chilli heat. Chicken tikka kebab has never been the less. The kathi Kebab yum yum. I've never been disappointed with Manti. I hope they'll always keep up to the expectations of their customers.

I still recollect those almost faded days when any occassion meant food from Manti. Being a Biriyani Fan since my tender days,Manti has always been one of my favourite. Their chicken chap, Mutton Biriyani and Mutton masala were lipsmackingly good. With time the quality of the food has detoriated but this place is filled with nostalgia and it will always remain a favourite place for me

A very popular moghlai restaurant located beside tollygunge tram depot. I have been visiting this restaurant since my childhood. A plate of mutton kasha or mutton handi kabab with tandoori roti is worth trying. The mutton biriyani is also appreciable. Take away is a better option than having it there as its noisy and the waiters are not cordial enough.

Interiors have been renovated and now you can check out the kebabs being cooked from the newly structured glass wall on one side of their kitchen... Chicken Tandoori's are really yummy....

This outlet has been there at the Tollygunge More since the ages! Visited this place innumerable number of times. Portions are good, prices are really on the lower side. Taste of the Biriyani is good too when they are served hot. But they use dalda I guess because the food items develop a thin oily little hard coating once they get cold, specially the Biriyani. Side dishes and kebabs they serve are good too. One drawback they have is that the restaurant doesn't have an AC in place.

What we ordered - Chicken Biriyani, Mutton Biriyani, Laccha Parantha, Mutton Handi Kebab, Mutton Tikia, Chicken Tangri Kebab, Chicken Tikka Kebab, Mutton Rezala, Chicken Kasha, Chicken Chap

A very popular food joint just overlooking uttam kumar's statue in the bustling tollygunge tram depot. I grew up savouring their finger licking biriyanis. There was a time when any occasion.meant Manti's biriyani. Its unlike the swank biriyani joints that have mushroomed throughout the city. The decor, the interiors are very basic. The service is also very "tip" oriented but if you are a lover of biriyani i think all these will be pardonable. A for the other dishes, i think you can opt for rezala. But i love their kabaabs. The rest of the side dishes have very high oil content thus mostly avoidable.

People who have lived in and around Tollygunge area are well aware of the name Manti. It has been around forever. We have been gorging on Manti's chicken and mutton biriyani's since a tender age and have always loved it.

There was a time, when crossing the Tollygunge Metro Station meant, picking up a couple of packets of Biriyani from Manti. The two things defining the Manti Biriyanis were the quality and the flavor.

Like many other landmarks in the city, Manti's quality too has taken a plunge, and it is specially saddening for people who used to be regulars. One thing that still makes their Biriyani appealing to me is that it is not dry. It is moist with ghee and there is enough in a packet to satiate two hungry souls. 

The best accompaniments with the Biriyanis are Chaps and the Handi Kebabs. If you have a sudden Biriyani craving and are looking forward to a Biriyani Night with family, Manti shall not disappoint.

Expect no ambience, great presentation..., taste, taste and taste is the only and best USP of this joint
Have been dining there for more than a decade now and I can bet on their biriyani, rezala and chaap....and not to forget the crispy-soft parantha!!!!!!
I highly recommend 2 things for this joint: 1. Please visit this place before 9pm as the biriyani gets sold out when before that 2. Generally go for take away option (beware: if your residence is far away, you may die out of the temptation and smell)
The food is little more than greasy and will shoot your calorie counter high.....but don't be guilt-stricken....you can once pamper your gastronomical desires.
Price is economical....very economical!
Staff and service is average like any old 'Calcuttan Classical restaurant'.

Apparently Manti r biriyani is quite iconic. This place is located very conveniently, right next to the Tollygunge tram depot. I've had biriyani here, and it's good, but nothing to truly fawn over. However the kosha mangsho is priced at rupees 100, and the meat is tasty and tender. I love a good kosha mangsho, so this place gets a nod of approval from my side.

One of the famous and popular eateries in this area, often being referred to as a landmark. Located conveniently, opposite to the Tollygunge Metro Station, this place is an easy find. Mostly due to the flock of people gathering in front of the outlet to collect on freshly prepared rolls.

Much alike many institutions, food is something, which used to define Manti for ages. It probably still does, but the quality has surely degraded over the years. All that remains how are few realms of forgotten memories. There was a time, I could go crazy for their Biryani. Lachcha and Rezala also used to be one of my favorite here. Now is a time, I need to think a couple of times before making my way here.

The ambiance here isn't much to speak about. The waiters are mostly courteous and the pocket pinch is also low. Their rolls however, are still a hit among the locals and the passer-by! If you are looking for a decent meal at a low cost, try dropping in here once!

One of the oldest food joint of Tollygunge.Nothing special about their decoration. But they serves quite a good food according to their very cheap price. l had there biriyani a long time ago and ,the taste wasn't like aminia or arsalan.But it had its own way which was good enough.

Have been a loyal customer of this restaurant for years. It was a pall-bearer among all  eateries in Tollygunge. Yet the quality of food has deteriorated so much. Their biriyani is bland , they splash sugar in everything from Naan to Chicken Handi Kabab. Felt like throwing up. The food is extremely disappointing. They direly need to get their act together.

A pocket friendly tandoori food place, which will serve your purpose everytime you are in search of cheap hunger!:üòù Although there menu is quite limited and repititive but then the bill will satisfy you for you will barely get it above 300+ for 2!

The answer to my hungry stomach after a hectic college day. Be it rolls or kebabs or tandoori roti with chicken/mutton or biriyani, I have tasted almost everything here and none of them are disappointing. Although, I do not prefer having biriyani from here. Pocket pinch for two immensely hungry people: never beyond 200-250 bucks. Tangri kebabs are awesome!

well knowned biriyani centre at the heart of tollygunge. Mostly prefer biriyani n chicken chap from this restro. I always go for a parcel bcoz the seat limit and the chaotic ambience out there. Not air conditioned, very hot there coz of cooking in front of the seating arraangement. Space is very little between one table to another. so better to go for a parcel. No complaint with the foods except the quantity. Now a days quantity is a bit low. But Overall Good restaurant :)

Manti is a small eatery with a fast food counter selling one of the best rolls I've had.
‚Ä¢
Let's be specific. This small place is located just beside the Tollygunge tram depot in Tollygunge More and is quite noticeable. I've been munching on their rolls and biryanis for quite some time now and I love them. People may have different opinions about this place but I like it. This is not a place where the restaurant attendants will do all the hospitality. If you are hungry and don't want to spend too much, this is a good place. Come, sit, eat and pay. Their Biryanis are good but not the best I've had. The mutton biryani is mostly preferable here with a perfectly cooked mutton and good amount of rice. Also try out the rezala here. Somehow I love it & had it innumerable times with tandoori roti.
‚Ä¢
Let me talk about their rolls. They are quite big. Few roll counters and fast food chains near this area serve rolls like them with good amount of stuffings in them.
‚Ä¢
Manti is a good place for a quick bite without putting a hole in your pocket. One should try this place if they are nearby Tollygunge.

Manti, located opposite to Tolly metro adjacent to Tollugunge Tram Depot has been around for ages satiating the hunger of the locals for decent Biriyani and other Mughlai dishes..Nothing much to vouch about this place, if you are looking for adecent ambiance I would suggest you to opt for take-away.. Service is pretty lackluster and devoid of any care.. Also I feel this place has big time issue with hygeine.. 
Biriyani is the focal point of this joint, apart from that Mutton Chap, Mutton Handi and Chicken/Mutton Rezala scores high enough on taste and proportions..Apart from that the reasonable pricing is definitely a big plus..
Roaming around tollygunge area, feeling hungry,looking for a quick grub, do try their Rolls, you won't be dissappointed..
Food: 3/5
Pricing: 4/5
Service: 2.5/5
Ambiance: 1.5/5

This is an age old restaurant situated just besides tollygung tram depot. They have a very small sitting arrangements and non ac. Inspite of this the food quality is good. You can try their tandoor and the biriyani. Price is also reasonable. As it is located in a crowded place you could have to wait sometimes for a table.

It is pretty cheap and the food is pretty tasty.
But the place is just about clean, let alone any kind of atmosphere.
I recommend:
# Chicken Rezala
# Laccha Paratha
other than the usual #Biryani which everyone goes there. In fact, it is "Mantir Biryani" which is more famous than the eating house otherwise.

Small but nice place....tasty food, reasonable price, friendly but odd behaving staff (kept on calling some chotu continuosly while we were ordering).....we had chicken handi kabab (which was a gravy dish), butter naan and salad....which roughly cost 300...316 to be precise....naan was partly crisp and partly soft...and nicely butterd....chicken was 100 rupees per plate.... 5 boneless pices.....which is more than efficent for one person.....over all...well paid 300 bucks

Tikia, the only good thing perhaps. Kababs, Chicken kasha and matar paneer are okay. The quality of oil they use is quite suspicious. However the quality of kababs have faltered. Still it is okay to obtain takeaway once a week

Location is the best part about this restaurant. Going to a friend's place, and need to pack some food, this used to be the most frequented place. Want to grab a quick lunch? Manti again. But even then, I was never able to completely love the Biryani here - it is very oily, and though the basic taste is as good as any such place, the grease is too much.

I actually preferred their sides like Mutton Liver, Mutton Handi and Chicken Rezala with their Tandoori Rotis. But their quality has declined over time.

I really like their Rolls and Kababs, but then again, there are hundreds of restaurants that serve better rolls and kababs. So nothing to rave about this place, but yes, was quite a regular during college days.

Anyone who is from around Tollygunge has eaten in Manti Restaurant. Come occasion or just dining casually, Manti has been the hot spot for people for more than a decade and a half. Be it the Biriyani, or simply the kebabs, the place is well known for their Mughlai cuisine. Located on the main road, just opposite the statue of Uttam Kumar, it also boasts of a great location advantage. The only disadvantage is its lack of a proper ambiance, which makes it nearly impossible to sit there and enjoy a nice meal.

Though not very well known, this place serves excellent biriyani, chicken/mutton handi kabab, chicken do piaza and chicken rezala! I haven't tried anything else. The tandoori roti and naans are very soft and well cooked! The ambience isn't good and you also won't get a table separately for your group (unless you happen to be six people :p). I recommend take-away from here. However the quality has downgraded a bit over the years.

Manti, a small food joint located in tollygunge tram depot is a place of delight.
Went there on a friend's treat few days back. The most engaging thing about this place is dat every dish has got a unique texture & taste. Be it chicken masala, rezala, kasha, handi chicken, tikka everything is different from one another. The rotis & naans are super soft & melts in the mouth. The mutton tikia is its signature dish. Biriyani is not so good. Manti is more famous for its kebabs. I liked the malai murgh kebab the most.
Food quantity & quality are good.
Cheap prices & quick service are its other highlights. 
Dont go there expecting a saima but u'll surely be satisfied by the food.

Located just opposite Tollygunge metro station, this place might look good enough with all those kebabs on the show in front of the outlet, but it's not good at all. We ordered Mutton Kasha with tandoori rotis, and the rotis were as hard as stones. Even Kasha was like roadside normal. Quite frustrating since we were very hungry and just wanted a peaceful filling dinner, but it wasn't to be. I highly discourage to go in this one.

My first memory for this restaurant takes me back to the 90's decade when I was introduced to this place by my cousin. Back then there was no elaborate decor, waiters dressed in navy blue uniforms who were not equipped with the mordern day era of servicing a customer. But the food was as delicious as it is now. Although, I have only tried a handful of items over there but I became sort of a patron of their food after having Tandoori Roti and Mutton Tikia. Back then the prices were in single digits and you could have a gala meal at just 20 bucks which I am sure is not the case today. The tikia was something that had blown me off ! The mutton cooked to perfection. Apart from that I had dishes like Biryani, Rezala, Chaap, Rolls all of which are average. All in all I can say that in case you are craving for having mughlai dishes and at the same time don't want the 'bapu' to fly out of your pocket and into the cash box of the restaurant, then go visit this once. This place will always remain special to me as I had taken my, then girlfriend, now wife, on our very first date ;-) Location is very good. Just beside Tolly Tram Depot.

Located at the busy Tollygunge Tram Depot, this joint is never short of customers. The food is pretty decent out here, with satisfactory quantity. Biryani tastes fine and the Kebabs too. The service time is a huge problem, specially if you are visiting during evening. You might have to wait upto 20 to 25 mins just to get your rolls done. Although they have a pretty okayish seating arrangement inside the restaurant, but it's difficult to sit and have your food over here, as there is no air-conditioning and it's too crowded. Best used as a take away counter.

Visited quite a lot of times. Ambiance isn't that impressive but the food is. The biriyanis are really delicious. The chicken and mutton dishes are spicy and rich but yummy and pocket friendly. Taking into account the service, food and ambiance, this restro earns an average rating.

This is one of those restaurants which draws in most of its customers because of a prime location. Probably one of the most inconsistent restaurants in the city. There are times that i loved their Biriyani and there are also instances when i had a hard time gulping it down. However, it depends on which hour of the day you are visiting and whether the Biriyani is fresh and hot or not. You can always ask the waiter, they have the honesty of guiding you well or alternatively they don't really care much since the sale is so high. The side dishes and kababs here are standard.

Very nice dishes also at a very cheap rate.. Often visit there. It is also placed at very good position hence easy to find. Love the moglai dishes very much of Manti.. Restaurant is also very nice. But a major problem is that they dont offer much garvy dish. So it will be nice if they increase some dishes in the future...

Not good service. Quality of food is neither good either. The place is usually congested due to its prime location. Usually at lunch hours u need to share seats with other people. Very irritating and a horrible eating experience. Even they make only tandoori roti at lunch hours and those turn into solid rocks by 10mins. Awful place.

This place is my messiah when I am extremely hungry & run short of money. Just opposite the Tollygunge metro station, this place serves some good mughlai dish at very limited price. The biriyani is very good though the taste differs everyday. The mutton chaap, chicken do piyaza, mutton handi kebab, chicken rezala is extremely good. The reshmi, tikka & hariyali kebab is ok. Its a bit chewy but you can go with it. The rolls are extremely fulfilling & good. The staff is very polite & good. In all a very good place with good food at a minimum amount :)

If you wanna have biriyanis and kababs with high fat content this is the right place for you. The rolls are not upto the mark. The person in billing counter seems like he is favouring you by serving you the food. The waiters become deaf as soon as you call them. The chicken chap, masala, dopiaza every dish taste the same. Only pro is that it is located in tollyguange opposite metro station

But they make very tasty rolls. Though much oily.

Located right in front of tollygunje metro, this place has a very advantegeous location. A restaurant without ac or any ambience, just simple mughlai food and nothing else. As soon as you see this place, u can see their sticks of kebabs hanging. Chicken malai kebab is good along with a decent biriyani. But only one complaint- the serving style. The waiters literally throw the plate on the table and this sometimes is very irritating. A mixed review for an average place

The zomato account just depicts my name and photo. I decided to start with an amazing restaurant where i feel great to a part of... Just next to the Tollygaunje tram depot... lies the aroma of amazing food, decent crowd and pocket friendly menu of Manti Restaurant. I think nostalgia is a good ride for one who loves food. Have been going there past 20 years. The food always amazed me by the standard and consistency they have maintained over the years.A yummy bite... reminds me first time i ate the mutton chaap, and mutton rezala. One must know, they are typical north kolkata food (jeta sahebi south kolkata te paoa jai na)Their food is amazing. The chicken and mutton is actually chaap, not a piece of abrupt flesh in tomato gravy. The aromatic, tender, juicy meat just falls out of the bone, melts in the mouth. It is like french "comme cela - as it should be". Accompanied by the pillow soft tandoori rotis... Baby !!! Dinner is served just right..They open with the same menu from 11 in the morning to 10 pm( if you want to eat a nice dinner, go before 9 or else the Chaap or Rezala is over)...hence tasty biryani for brunch in moderate rates, may suit you fine.The other items on the menu are great, as mentioned their rezala is great and their freshly grilled kababs. The proper north indian kababs are served next to hustle and bustle. Served with mint-yoghurt chutney, the chargrilled aroma kicks the nose and taste buds... Another few¬†signature item i can state is Mutton Tikia Kabab, Liver Curry. It does melt in the mouth. Sumtuous !!!!One shouldnt expect amazing decor when decent priced food is served right and perfected over 20 years.The Joy of Goodfood is the Joy in Kolkata.

Reaching Manti is never a problem. As soon as you get out of Mahanayak Uttam Kumar Metro and cross the road, the great aroma of biriyani just attracts you to this shop. Though the outlet is most conveniently located but the taste of the food just okay types. 
Have been staying at Tollygunge since the past 3 years and have visited this place quite often but am mostly dissatisfied with the food being served. The mutton in mutton biriyani is not soft enough, the chicken in chicken chaap was hard and dry. Seemed that it had been kept out for long. 
However, the rolls are good and so are the chicken tikkas, kababs. 
Service too is quick with the waiters cordial. Non availability of a/c is also a major concern when you're eating such rich and oily food. My suggestion would be to eat at Aminia nearMalancha cinema nearby. 
Not recommended, sorry.

Conveniently located just opposite to the Tollygunge Metro Station, this place is very well known among the locals for their North Indian dishes. The seating area is really small and can accommodate hardly 15-20 people at max. Plastic Chairs are there and can get really stuffy and hot during summers. Hygiene is also an issue as it is not well maintained. So i would recommend this joint for home delivery and take away only. Coming to food, they make awesome Mutton Chap which is my personal favorite here. Biriyani is also really good but a bit oily. Among Tandoori Items Tangri Kebab is the one which they prepare really well. but all other Kebabs are good and can be had. The thing that they sell the most is Rolls. Pretty decent but nothing extra ordinary about it. Maybe they can consider lowering the level of dalda that goes in one such roll. The place remains really crowdy during rush hours and hence waiting time is an issue out here.

The chairs are also old type and not that much comfortable for sitting.

Food:
The briyani is good in this restaurant .and in all the dishes ¬†the quantity of oil you will find very much.
The egg roll and chicken roll is also good in this restaurant.

Staff:
The staff is not that much of cooperative ,for every time you have ask 2-3 times for any help.

For Biriyani & Kebab lovers. Huge quantity served with quality. Price is reasonable as far based on the huge quantity and quality and the location is good too. However the waiting time is a bit extra than expected. The staffs were friendly too. If you are hungry with a little short in budget and you are near this place I strongly suggest to visit this place. The kebab, tandoori almost everything I ate there was yummy. The place is crowded, well most of the time so before deciding going there have to gather a little patience.

Manti is the place for Biryani lovers in Tollygunge...i have gone to this place many times...i have tried nearly all of their dishes... Biryani is their USP.. And i like it.. Their tandoori roti is awesome.. I think it serves the best tandoori roti in Kolkata... The mutton liver is good as well... Their mutton tikka needs a bit of improvement.. Saima beats them here...their rolls are not good.. Itz wayyyyy tooo oily..... And the paratha is not good at all... Sometimes u feel like throwing it away in the drain.....the meat of the roll is juicy but the other parts of the roll fails big time. And the waiters are not well behaved.. And one of the cashiers is particularly the worst persons that i have ever seen. He treats customers badly.. Go for the food but do not expect good behaviour from them.

To stay in Tollygunge and not know about Manti is a sin. A small eatery situated right at the intersection of tram depot, the patrons here can be seen trudging in right as the sun sets, and the place remains crowded till the very closing minute. I don't remember having ever crossed this eatery without spotting the crowd spilling over on to the pavement.

The place doesn't really offer the best dining experience. In fact, I have never had a meal inside Manti, and it has always been a take-away affair - it seems stuffy and smoky and way too small. But taste their biriyani once and you'll come back for more. Though not well known outside its little comfort zone, Manti can hold its own again the Aminias and the Nizams.

Apart from the biriyani here, I have had their rolls on a couple of occasions, and they are pretty well prepared as well. Unfortunately, I can't recommend it to people who stay outside Tollygunge, since its effectively a take-away joint, and people here are sure to know about this place. But if you are in the vicinity, visiting a friend or a relative, do make sure to pester your hosts to treat you to their mutton biriyani and chicken rezalla.

This place is overall a good place for having food. Located at the busy intersection of Tollygunge tram depot more its an easily locatable place and is right on the main road. The strategic position of the eatery earns it many a customer and is busy most of the time. They cook North Indian food and are good at it I should say. I have had their rolls,kebabs,tandoori chicken,chicken chaap,chicken rezala,rotis,naans and their biryanis and must say all were overall quite good to taste and was value for money. The prices are reasonable here and service is fast. I remember a friend once telling one of their elderly servers to find him a good leg piece for the chicken biryani he ordered, and he was really served a big chunk that I can still remember. The biryani is good to taste, and the breads-specially the tandoori roti is good. They also make good kebabs with haryali kebab being the special mention.
I have often got my food parceled from this place and service was quick in this case also.To sum up,this is a good restro.
But I have a little message-I have seen little boys (surely below 14 years) serving,cleaning and washing throughout the day at this place,which is a sore sight. Please STOP CHILD LABOUR over here.

Had a horrible experience.. food was OK. but the service is worst.¬†
I went there long tym back, and was totally dissatisfied due to the service and dats y never went there again...
¬†I had ordered a Mughlai paratha , & after a long wait, ¬† oNe of the waiter ¬†came an banged the plate on the table. As if he is doing me a gr8 favor , by getting the food for me... ¬†Its a big NO NO if u want to dine in.. ¬†
Take away is recommended.

I was introduced to this place by one of my friend. Being a north Kolkata resident i did not know much about south. We went there to get a grab of their kebabs and trust me they are delicious. Big pieces of chicken cooked nicely with right amount of spices. And the green chutney. I just loved it. We tried reshmi kebab, hariyali kebab and another kebab i forgot the name. We liked it so much that we re ordered the hariyali kebabs. I just love their kebabs. Recommended!!

Horrible reception, especially the person at the parcel counter is particularly ill mannered at all times .. serving food to someone must be done with gr8 courtesy and respect, something thats totally lacking here ..the food is not as bad though..however my take, it doesnt help the image in any way.

I went to this joint to parcel a family dinner(for 3 members). ¬†I ordered 3 Butter nan, Hariyali kebabs, Chicken Rezalla, Handi Chicken. It took nearly 30 minutes to get the food parceled.
The food quality was average, but the quality of Rezalla was poor, indeed a disaster.
The waiters were quite rude and were abusing each other and having mock fights among themselves, in front of all customers.
Many children were also working in this joint, which I personally felt very ¬†bad.

WILL NOT RECOMMEND TO ANYONE !

Being just opposite the Mahanayak Uttam Kumar Metro station, Manti was one of the places which I would get to see quite often but never remember to eat at! (sigh)
Finally had the opportunity to try it out after college. 
Well, the two of us were really hungry, and our taste buds were screaming for kebabs. Ordered tandoori chicken and chicken malai kebab. They were right in front of us in less than 15 minutes. 
Though I was a little apprehensive of the food in the beginning, the fare tasted good enough, given its pocket-friendly prices. The overdose of spices on top made the chicken tandoori interesting.

The small seating area doesn't have much of an ambiance, for it is mostly a takeaway joint. 
3.5/5.

This joint is located in Tollygunge opp to the Metro station. This is a very small place but food is quite good here. I specially love their Mutton biryani and chicken chap combo or chicken chap with soft tandoori rotis. Have not tried their Kebabs though but food is good compared to the prices they charge. Service is fast. Dont expect an ambience just go for the food.

The restaurant should only be famous for TASTE. The ambiance is not at all sober sometimes. But the food can cover any cons it has. Great handi kabab, hariyalli kabab(yummm), or tikka kabab, nun, tandoori roti... well, biriyanis are a bit oily, and can leave the stains of dalda or banaspati, but the side dishes are good. The quality falters sometime, and that is where it fails to maintain its regularity. A reasonable dine out or a pick up option for budget conscious people.

Whenever we have sleepovers, parties and movie dates in friends places, there is only one place the food comes from- Manti!

And the reason why this happens is because me and my friends, being a gang of 'wannabe' health conscious girls, love the fact that the biryani from here doesn't feel dry after a while but isn't oily at all.¬†
It is probably the way they prepare it- a well kept secret!¬†

One has to try their chicken chaap, which is a personal favourite. Moreover the kebabs are yum- and here I repeat the 'not looking oily but not tasting dry' bit again.¬†

Easy on your pocket, and the location is so convenient- one can't really have more reasons to hop over to this quaint little restaurant and give their food a try- and subsequently the nod of approval!

It is well connected, just outside Tollygunge metro station hence always great for a take away after a long day's work. The biriyani is fantastic, very light. My favourite is the chicken chaap, chicken malai kebab and liver tikka. A big thumbs up, would definitely recommend. Hope they had branches around the city.

Location : Opposite to tollygunge metro station.
Ambience : to be frank...this joint focusses solely on food and the quality.Not a great ambience

Food : I found the food to be average.We ordered for hariyali kabab,chicken handi kabab and nan.The hariyali kabab was not properly grilled and thus failed to impress.
Chicken handi was good with right amount of safron and mix of masalas.....

Price : Very very economical.A pocket friendly place.The cost for two people should be around two -three hundred.

Suggestion: kababs need to be taken care off.The restaurant has an tremendous potential to grow if they fix these few departments.

This was one of my favorite food joints during my college days. It still beckons me whenever I'm nearby. What it lacks in ambiance lustre, makes up in the location and delicacies.
Biriyani has always been Manti's speciality and it's arguably one of the best in that locality. The price is damn reasonable, the quantity is ample and the quality has been progressively standard for almost a decade now. I would like to see them expand their business and provide better sitting arrangements & home delivery, if possible.
Apart from biriyani, they have expertise in cooking chicken/mutton liver dishes. For those who would like to try something other than biriyani, I would personally recommend roomali roti and mutton kasha. But you might wanna hit the gym after you lick your fingers clean!

A well known restaurant in Tollygunge area for serving north indian dishes at reasonable price. Visited this place quite a few times for birthday treats and dinners. A very average place. 

I'm leaving the ambiance part bcoz it has not got one.

Coming to food, personally my favourite is Mutton liver curry and Tandoori roti, liver curry may be a bit oily but it is tasty. Once tried their Mutton Biriyani and I found it to be extremely oily, rice were undercooked and the meat was not tender at all. Rolls are decent and try to avoid their kebabs.
Its better to Take-away your food as the dine-in place small and crampy.

FOOD-- like any other north indian restaurants it offers you known dishes. Foods are not so bad or not so good that it will force u to ho there once again.  We opt for chicken biriyani,  chicken tandoori and mutton handi kabab. Foods were decent in terms of quality! 

ATMOSPHERE-- generally take away orders are more. Their is a small  dine in area also but congested. So as a whole you can try once!

Decent little place. Not the best ambience but good for a quick meal on the go. Avoid the biryani as it gets too oily at times. Try the side dishes with the parathas or rotis and that combo would be better. Used to be the best biryani place in the vicinity a few years back, now the nearby Aminia and Azad Hind are better. But still it is a decent enough place to go to if you are in the area and in need of a quick bite.

Extremely crampy, good food. The place is always overcrowded and you will hardly ever get your choice of item if you are late. The biriyani is the best in the Tollygunge area. The chicken sides are also okay. Also, this is a good place for evening snacks. I am particularly fond of their Double Egg Roll.

P.S. I am not too fond of their kababs. I find them too dry for my liking.

Located bang opposite to Mahanayak Uttam Kumar Metro Station, Manti is a very average restaurant which hardly leaves any mark on one's memory except for it being disappointing.The food is disappointing though cheap.It is not a place to try out vegetarian or chinese food and what can be still edible is the mughlai food even where I think one should not venture  beyond the biriyani.The biriyani though spicy is average. The breads section or the side dishes are equally inedible especially the chicken rezala or  the chaap.The rolls however require special mention because the it is the only thing except the biriyani which is eatable.Hygiene is a word which is not known here and the ambiance is pathetic.If one was truly broke I would still recommend any restaurant but Manti.

Vegeterians please avoid. They have matar paneer ,dal and palak paneer in the menu.But allof them are too bad..Now talk of non vegeterian.Their food is really good at that price.Everything is fresh because they have a huge turnover. Its quite old and is maintainting the same standard . Tasty undoubtedly.But  everything is cooked in vegetable oil . Drain the oil, it may come to other use.. The rating is only for food. They have sitting arrangement but its not pleasant at all. All in all a cooman man's eatery. Take parcels, go home and finish it while hot. You'll love the  food. Else.....

regular visitor since the time manti opened its doors. during those days, manti was the best and only option for mughlai food for people beyond tolly tram depot if you didnt want to go far. the taste, quality and quantity has remained the same good all these years however i must say the chicken piece in their chaanp and biriyani is real small and bony...i mean the chicken they source are really small (has been like this always)...wish they used larger chicken for the meat. 
never tried their rolls as this is basically a dining place for us. however the other day i tried tikia roll which i found was too overpriced. each tikia costs Rs. 30/- which is OK by itself for good quality and each paratha costs Rs 15/- so together they charge Rs. 46/- for each tikia roll which is just exorbitant...you get excellent quality egg-chicken roll for that amount...

To start. it is a very NORMAL restaurant situated very near to Mahanayak Uttam Kumar a.k.a Tollygunj Metro Station.
Food is not very good. Its average. But it is pocket Friendly. Special mutton biriyani is good, though there is a huge room for development. Lachha Paratha Tandoor with Mutton tikia is a good combo. The place is not very good for kebabs, I only kind of liked the chicken hariyali kebab. 
This place is good for rolls. Mutton tikia roll, double chicken roll, double mutton roll and paneer roll deserves special mention.

Some places however simple leave a lingering mark on ones memory.. I will always remember Manti for for my first taste of Kolkata Biryani. Time has moved on and Kolkata has seen a lot of famous Biryani houses come up but the Biryani at Manti's though not as famous is still very good and true to the Kolkata spirit.
The chicken rezala and the mutton kosha are also must haves at this place. A truly value for money place. You will leave with a satisfied grin and a smiling pocket. That's a promise.

This joint located adjacent to the Tolly tram depot has been around for quite some time.A strictly junta /VFM (Value for Money) joint which serves decent Kolkata style mughlai food.
Now on to the salient features:
Food: Stick to the Indian section ONLY although they do serve Chinese dishes.Items like the Biriyani,rezala,kebab masala curry and the recently introduced Murg Masallam are good.The array of bread/roti items are also pretty decent.However their major hit is the rolls and kebab section which functions usually in the evenings.I have found their rolls even better than "Hot Kati" at Park Street.Yes, sounds unbelievable but true.The parathas are crispy and not chewy like in most joints.Size of the helpings in every dish is adequate at pocket friendly prices.The double chicken double egg roll is gigantic and meant only for a person with a gargantuan appetite.
On the flip side, this joint is not for people who are calorie-conscious.They do use liberal amount of dalda in their dishes like in most old-school Mughlai joints of Kolkata. Sit-in ambiance is pathetic.One has to share tables with strangers,tables are untidy .Waiters are rude and filthy too.The drinking water served in the restaurant is suspect and is perhaps straight from the tap.Take-away is advised strictly.The joint is heaviliy crowded most of the time and one has to be patient to get the food packed.
P.S. Prices have been jacked up from the 1st of August.Request Zomato to upload the revised menu.

Manti,located very conviniently bang opposite Tollugunje metro station is a very popular place among the locals and for good reason to.I was introduced to this place by my friends who reside nearby.Ever since,this has been one of my favourites and if I pass by I generally drop by for a meal.
The food quality is excellent.The kebabs,chicken tandoori,chap and the biryani are worth recommending.They also offer Chinese dishes which I dont think is any where near as good.The rolls are also nice.The quantity is also good.The service is fast and the prices are very much affordable.
The disadvantage is that the place is crowded almost any time you visit.You will probably have to wait to get a seat.The place offers seating facility for about 15-20 people only.You may have to share the table with others.Then the place is not even air conditioned.The hygiene and cleanliness is also not the greatest.
Overall if you like your North Indian food and you dont mind sacrificing ambience for tasty food,then this place is worth a try.

This place is THE PLACE TO GO if you are near Tollygunge Tram Depot and are just itching for something to eat. Its known to generations of Tollygunge residents, who fondly recall the time when this was the only option for decent food in the area. This small restaurant has been serving quality food at affordable prices for decades. Even now, nearly every item on the menu is under priced or averagely priced at the least. The menu in itself is huge and offers a large variety of popular cuisines. 
The food let me say doesn't require reviewing. It's just good as a matter of fact. The old favourites such as Chicken Biryani, Chicken Tikka Butter masala and Shahi Paneer still rule the roost. However the newer introductions such as the Hariyali kabab and Mutton Tikia Fry are also a hit. The section in the menu comprising the " Kababs in Butter Masala ", is not only a wordplay. It is genuine stuff and tastes great. This place was never known for its Veg and don't go looking for it. The veg dishes are probably the only drag. The waiters themselves don't know what a green salad is. Same goes for the bland and boring Chinese. My personal favourite in the menu would be : Fish Schezwan and Prawn Chilly. Avoid also the snacks. Go for the soups. Service is fast and the waiters are nice.
The fast food section is popular with the quantity of every roll utterly satisfying. You could try the Double Chicken Double Egg roll if you dare. Also maybe the recenly added special Murg Musallam which takes 3 hours to cook apparently, as displayed on the menu. :)

Chakrabrty Tip : Its better if you decide to takeaway. Getting a seat inside is like winning a lottery. :)

Do not ever get food from this place. We got kababs from here and once we started warming it up in the microwave there was a smell of rotten flesh and it took us a while to resalise it was the kabab so just stay away from this one.

Some places however simple leave a lingering mark on ones memory.. I will always remember Manti for for my first taste of Kolkata Biryani. Time has moved on and Kolkata has seen a lot of famous Biryani houses come up but the Biryani at Manti's though not as famous is still very good and true to the Kolkata spirit.
The chicken rezala and the mutton kosha are also must haves at this place. A truly value for money place. You will leave with a satisfied grin and a smiling pocket. That's a promise.

This joint located adjacent to the Tolly tram depot has been around for quite some time.A strictly junta /VFM (Value for Money) joint which serves decent Kolkata style mughlai food.
Now on to the salient features:
Food: Stick to the Indian section ONLY although they do serve Chinese dishes.Items like the Biriyani,rezala,kebab masala curry and the recently introduced Murg Masallam are good.The array of bread/roti items are also pretty decent.However their major hit is the rolls and kebab section which functions usually in the evenings.I have found their rolls even better than "Hot Kati" at Park Street.Yes, sounds unbelievable but true.The parathas are crispy and not chewy like in most joints.Size of the helpings in every dish is adequate at pocket friendly prices.The double chicken double egg roll is gigantic and meant only for a person with a gargantuan appetite.
On the flip side, this joint is not for people who are calorie-conscious.They do use liberal amount of dalda in their dishes like in most old-school Mughlai joints of Kolkata. Sit-in ambiance is pathetic.One has to share tables with strangers,tables are untidy .Waiters are rude and filthy too.The drinking water served in the restaurant is suspect and is perhaps straight from the tap.Take-away is advised strictly.The joint is heaviliy crowded most of the time and one has to be patient to get the food packed.
P.S. Prices have been jacked up from the 1st of August.Request Zomato to upload the revised menu.

This place is my all time favourite for the food and specially the price. but if someone looking for a great ambiance this is not a place for him.
The restro located opposite of tolly metro is a good place for having a lunch. they have a variety of kebabs and other mutton and chicken dishes. love their mutton kasha and mutton handi. and the kebabs are also just fine. Service is good and prompt. but the staffs are not that good. The best part of this restro is thrir price.. Any kebabs ewill cost between 100-110 . mutton side dishes will cost 70-80 which is really wonderful although the 4pieces of mutton are a bit small in size. But at the end it will cost not morr than 300 for two with a full stomach of food.

Manti is a tiny Mughlai restaurant tucked beside Tollygaunge tram depot and has been around for a long time, almost ever since the cocept of Biriyani became really popular among the general population of Kolkata.
I have been having the Chicken Biriyani from Manti since time immemorial and till date,I have never been disappointed.  The rice is always moist and aromatic and the chicken well cooked.
Apart from that, they also do quite a good job with their tandoori roti, chicken/mutton chap, normal kebabs(like sheekh, hariyali, reshmi etc.). I also have a soft spot for their handi kababs. It is one of the rare mutton preparations that I enjoy.
But the best dish at Manti will have to be the Rezala both Chicken and Mutton.The aroma, the texture and the taste of that dish is cooked to perfection. It actually is better than most Rezalas served at other much costlier outlets.
This is a place where you will always get value for money.
The one downside of this restaurant is the ambiance. The tables are often dirty, and you will have to share your tables. I always prefer to parcel my food from there, rather than sit and eat there. Also it is almost always crowded, so be prepared to wait, for your parcel or for a chance to find an empty table.

firstly the bad things:
1)the ambience: noisy, hot, cramped
2)The tables and the floor: dirty.They often spill some grains of biryani on the floor and tables while bringing the plates to the table. While the table gets a customary swish with a wiping cloth, the floor remains that way.
3)The tables often have to be shared.
4)the people at the counter are rude, and mostly disinterested in taking takeaway orders.

Now the good thing, ie, FOOD.
They have consistently been making the BEST rezala in Kolkata. I have tasted rezala in most mughlai eateries of Kolkata, from the famed Sabir to aminia to shiraz, and arsalan, but this nondescript eatery is a notch above all of them, in my humble opinion.They have never, even on a single occassion failed to make me happy with their rezala, chicken or mutton. The gravy is light, full of flavours, and simply orgasmic.It is the first thing to get over at this place.
And oh, they make very good biryani as well, as an accompaniment with the rezala :)

Manti is a standard restaurant for Mughlai food in Calcutta. It is cheap and the quantities served are good. I have always found the waiters polite. The service varies depending on the kind of item ordered. I have found that they can bring standard items like Tandoori Rotis and Chaaps very quickly, while the more exotic kebabs and main dishes might take more time.

The low level of cleanliness is a factor, and the quality of the water is suspect. However, I have drunk it once or twice and suffered no ill effects till date. Still, an Aquaguard, especially in Tollygunge, would make a world of difference.

I like their Mutton Biriyani (whenever I have eaten it, the mutton has been very soft to the point of many of the bones becoming edible) and their Parathas. Most of the chicken and mutton dishes on the menu are standard, so appreciation will depend on individual preferences for specific dishes. The fancier kebabs on the list should be avoided - in fact, many of them cannot be made well anywhere in Calcutta.

Like another reviewer here, I too regret that they don't serve Firni. I think that keeping the place clean would be enough to attract more customers, though it is quite crowded most of the time.

This place scores for its value-for-money index. The service is so-so and the less said about the ambience, the better. The tables are not maintained properly and the entire place is not inviting visually. However, you can and we do sometimes take our food home from here.

Like other Mughlai low-budget restaurants, Manti is not for your culinary adventures. If you stick to the popular items like the Reshmi and Seekh Kebab, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Bharta, Mutton Chaanp and Laccha Paratha and other items from the bread section, you will find it quite filling and tasty. The biriyani is more on the spicier side, but is acceptable and the meat is usually well-cooked, though not as tender as it could be at some other places. They don't make firni, which is a disappointment for me. The helpings are substantial and even if you have some criticism to offer on the quality, the quantity will impress you. One plate of biriyani with or without a gravy item is enough to last you for a long time.

Verdict: Located in an excellent position just opposite the Mahanayak Uttam Kumar or Tollygunge Metro Station, Manti offers reasonably tasty food at throw-away prices. Not especially recommended, but it's not bad either.

If you do not give a damn about ambiance and are willing to set aside health concerns (which people generally do while going for traditional 'Kolkata biryani') then this is not such a bad place. You may have to share the tables and the waiters may be ill mannered, but the biryani, chicken masala, handi mutton, etc. tastes much better compared to other similarly priced food joints like Bedwin, Alibaba etc.

Have remained as a regular customer of this place for more than 15 years. Have seen the restaurant grow with me. It is a great place to enjoy food for a real foodie, who does not see anything but a plate of good tasty food when served. For people with short pockets and over-hungry bellies it is absolutely a heaven. Mutton biriyani with chicken chap is highly suggested. Nothing is better if you consider it as a takeaway restaurant.

Forget everything if you want some good dishes and not looking for the ambiance.
I Really Love Manty for their Dishes. This is a Mughlai Restro and its food is awesome.
Both Mutton and Chicken Biriyani is awesome. Mutton Kasha, Chicken kabab is really tasty.
Tandoori chicken is very good. Must try their Lachcha Parathas with Chicken's item.
All the dishes always satisfied me.
Ambiance is poor. Few seats and dirty oily place. Staffs are okay.
Price is very very reasonable compare to its food's quality and quantity. 
Overall 4 stars for its food and 2 stars for their Ambiance.

Probably not the place if you want a nice looking restaurant with well dressed staffs, but it scores with their excellent food and cheap pricing! Lachha parathas and chicken kormas are very tasty, and so are the kebabs! Food is served hot, and you'll absolutely love it! It's not a fancy restaurant, but if you're hungry, and want a nice mughlai platter, its a value-for-money!

It's A Fantastic Restaurant, although it might not look from outside as you pass by. they specialise in tandoor and moghlai cuisines. from my point of view they are one of the best in calcutta, only drawbacks are 

1. They Dnt Accept Cards
2. They Dont Have Home Delivery

Prices are reasonable, Location Is Outstanding..and FOOD is Just Yummy
