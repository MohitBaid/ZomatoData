Mainly fav of office goer , interior is spacious but sm peculiar smelly might b due to damp effect in ac part! Clean n tidy with good cutlery , regarding food quality is nothing remarcable quantity also good as per price, liquor stock is mainly for regular boozer but cheap in comparison to d establishment.Stewards r polite n efficient overall not bad for be a patron for a while

I used to be a regular here when my office was near it, now I have shifted to park street and I miss Cecil. It is a bar for people with tight budgets. It has friendly waiters, good north indian food(specially tandoor items) and cheap alchohol. My favorite is Chicken Tikka Masala. The ambience is good too, you can enjoy your drink without anyone disturbing you.

Quite regular here now-a-days as it is near to my office. They have drinks & food at quite low price..Service is good enough..Ambiance is good enough for one or two drinks...Obviously I don't consider it as a family restaurant..But for a drink or snacks it is really good..
