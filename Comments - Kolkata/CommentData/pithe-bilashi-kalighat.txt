Today I visited here. It's very near to kalighat metro station. The ambience is good. Well decorated. 
We ordered ghee khichdi, gondhoraj chicken with basmati rice, for dessert baked patisapta & kheer patisapta. 
Khichdi was awesome. Quantity was quite good. 
Gondhoraj chicken was YUMMM .. 
Patisaptas were blessing....(specially kheer one)
Must try..
Totally worth it.
Wanna try more items. 
Loved it

A very nice concept shop. In fact one of the most unique concept shops that I have come across, blending the traditional Bengali Pancakes and sweet Pithe with non vegetarian food, giving it the ultimate taste of fusion food.

Pithe Bilashi, with its superb variety is the actual FUSION FOOD restaurant that everyone is talking about these days.

Do go and grab a bite at this house of delectable delicacies. Will be worth the money.

Located very near to Deshbandhu college,a five minutes walk from Rashbehari Avenue, Pithe Bilashi is a true gem.
A concept so unique that I could not wait to try it out.So here I am writing a review just 10mins after returning from the place.
On entering one would get a Durga Puja kind of feeling with all the pretty decorations that welcome you.Inside it is quite simple, nothing much to say.
After going through the menu we decided to order-
1.Gondhoraj Fish Patisapta- This was something my mother tried and according to her it was the amazing with ample amount of bhetki fillings bursting with gandharaj flavour.
2.Chicken Cheese Patisapta- I tried this one and it simply impressed me!It had a blanket of cheese over it and the chicken stuffing was oozing with deliciousness!!!
Both of them were served with a bowl of yogurt and kasundi mix chutney and ketchup.
3.Mango Patisapta- My grandmom tried this and when she praises a traditional dish be sure it tastes perfect!She is talking about it even now!
4.Chocolate Patisapta-Got this one parcelled for my daddy and he is enjoying it right now.A thumbs up from him!yay!
5.Diabetic lassi-Well the 0.5 marks that I have deducted was for this one.Failed to impress us.
Will surely visit again!
HappyEating!

Ordered chicken khichuri for delivery and review is based only on that...delivery was prompt but tastewise was nothing great...the khichuri was average, the coconut posto bora was mostly coconut and hardly any posto...they shud have known how fussy bengalis are about their posto...the chutney and doi was missing from the home delivery...nwoadays when people are even delivering sambar and all no excuse is acceptable for not including chutney and doi from khichuri combo as mentioned in menu card...still would like to try out their patisaptas if that can improve my experience about the place

A beautifully decorated joint located near the Lake Mall, Kalighat.. A stone's throw from Deshbandhu College for Girls run by a very passionate lady Nabanita Chatterjee. The food they make has been a favourite of mine since ages when I 1st met Nabanita at a food fest in Nandan. The Mango, Orange and Chocolate patishapta has been my favourite since then. With the arrival of their 2nd branch at Kalighat its easier to access anytime as its near my vicinity. The ambience is neat and clean.. Little tribal decoration, nothing OTT.. The waiters are courteous and serves well. Coming to the food, its unlike any restaurant I ate before cuz it has an array of excellent unique dishes carefully made to perfection. From pahari chicken to chicken pallana & from ellish khichuri to Gandharaj chicken patisapta.. Every dish is unique and a treasure for us Bengalis. 
My personal favourite is Gandharaj fish patisapta, Mango Patisapta & Gabdharaj soda. This place is perfect for a family get together or if you simply love good food. A must try for every food lover!

Take the lane adjacent to Rashbehari metro station gate (where the Gariahat going autos wait for passengers). It's a minute's walk.

I love pithe. So it's natural I'll visit a restaurant with this unique name. Arrived at around 7pm and ordered a prawn malai Kari pithe (mains) and coconut kheer patisapta (dessert). The prawn was good but not brilliant. It was undeniably delicious but there was one element missing. I'm not a cook and so can't put a figure on it.

The star of the show was the coconut pithe. It was wonderful. A dish to remember.

Definitely worth multiple visits.

Pithe Bilashi is a simple restaurant with homely atmosphere. They serve some fusion food. The idea of this fusion food is just great. I have visited the Kalighat Outlet. The decor of the restaurant is very simple but sober. The behaviour of the staff member is very polite.
About food: I have ordered a Chicken cheese baked patishapta, and it was just awesome in taste. The idea of this fusion of chicken and patishapta is just great. 
Gandhoraj chicken Patisapta: Not much different in taste from cheese chicken baked patishapta. It Must not named 'Gandhoraj' because there is no flavour or smell of Gondhoraj Lemon in it.
Gandhoraj Fish baked patisapta: the fish was fresh and tasty. Tastes much better than chicken patisapta. It was too good. 
I have also ordered a baked patishapta, which was too much rich but tasty. The richness of kheer is not easy to digest. But those who love to eat sweets will like it very much. 
Kheer gokul: it was very soft and tasty. But I expected some liquide nolen gur over it. Anyway not bad. 
Quality and quantity of the food is very good and also pocket friendly. I wish to taste the Khichdi plate on my next visit. You must visit this this restaurant at least one if you love Patishapta, Pithe and obviously Bengali Fusion food.

LOCATION-just 500 mitre from Kalighat metro.very easy to find out. INTERIOR-From outside it goes exactly like its name.the tagline is very remembering.but,when we enter inside, interior gives us little bit disappointment.its does not go like exterior look. STAFF-they are good but the little bit over reacting in everything.i think they should be within their limit.but,it's ok. FOOD-lets come the most important point. We ordered mutton kichudi,gondhoraj patisapta and bolen gurer ice cream gokul.kichudi is excellent.till today,it is the best tasted khichudi ever for me.quantity is also good.one plate is over enough for two people.mutton amount in khichudi is good and well cooked.narkel bora is also mouth watering.next come gondhoraj patisapta.i think it is the must tasted dish.specially their yellow sauce.lastly ice cream,it is the best dessert with those yummy food. IT IS THE BEST RESTAURENT TILL NOW I VISITED FOR TYPICAL BENGALI DISH.MUST VISITED PLACE

Patishapta is a yummy and super scrumptious dessert recipe and everyone at your home will like this for sure, especially kids. These crepes are prepared with refined flour, rice flour and semolina, stuffed with tempting and delectable coconut and mawa filling and are served like a roll. But our Nabanita Madam, owner of Pithebilashi has taken it to an another level. Yes ! Patishapta is no more dessert only dish !

Kudos to the creative head & proprietor Nabanita Chatterjee for serving eccentric foods such as Hinghshuti kachuri, mango/chocolate patishapta, chicken/mutton patishapta, chicken/mutton Polanno & not to forget Nolen Ice-cream Gokul for desert... It simply awesome....

Ordered in via swiggy seeing their unique menu.we ordered a cheese chicken patishapta,a butter fish patishapta and a plate of gondhoraj chicken.

To our utter surprise,they delivered us a gondhoraj chicken patishapta instead of the chicken dish.points definitely deducted for that.

Tastewise,the stuffings were quite similar in taste,though nice.but each different patishapta lacked a unique or distinctive flavour.quality was good,amount was more than sufficient,but tastewise lacked the wow factor.the youghurt musturd dip served with it was quite runny,the other was just ketchup.

Was keen on trying the khichuri platters too before ordering,but not too sure now

The food reminds me of my grandmother's kitchen! Amazing traditional and forgotten Bengali food available here. The ambience is peaceful and it is a complete value for money since the quantity of food is more than enough to fill you up till the next meal (in my case I don't need the next meal after eating here). Hospitality at it's best, with polite and ever smiling staff and a very sweet and cheerful hostess ❤️ 
This is my favourite Bengali food destination, so is my family's. I wish Zomato had the option of giving +2 extra for food presentation skills, then I could've gave 7 out if 5 😋

Penning down this blog is making me extremely excited. ‘Maa r kotha mone pore’ (reminds me of my mom) in the below picture, you can see is the one written during their entrance and this is what exactly one will feel. Pithebilashi will take you to the your grandparents and parents era. The period when food where cooked with extreme care and love, with no fancy techniques and ingredients; only with homely elements.

Craving for some unusual yet good quality Bengali food? Head straight to Pithe Bilashi for some traditional & authentic bengali food that is sure to remind you of your grandmothers. They cater dishes which are so unconventional yet mind-blowingly delicious; some of which would be Gondhoraj fish patishapta, Mutton khichuri, Paneer vapa, Chocolate patishapta. Well, continue reading to know more!

Some things are so special and so close to heart that a rating can't express your feelings adequately. Move over Kabirajis and Cutlets and Kosha Mangshos that one associate with typical Bengali cuisine because Pithe Bilashi has come up with an innovative concept of giving our good ol' pithes and patishaptas an unique twist that will make your mouths water just by listening to it. They have converted our traditional sweet dishes into savoury ones which are an instant hit among all foodies.
Here are some of the dishes that we tasted each is which are capable of transporting you to a different era of nostalgia.
*Gondhoraj Lassi- This came as a relief to our hungry stomachs. The light creamy chaas was delicious to say the least.

*Magic touch-This one was one the sweeter side. Ice-cream with milk powder mixed with it and rose syrup made it a beautiful as well as tasty.

*Chicken cheese baked Patishapta- This is basically a crepe with a filling of minced meat and coated with cheese. The minced meat was very moist and tasted amazing. The cheese enhanced it's taste. This was served with ketchup and a mustard sauce. The sauce tasted tad sweet to me.

*Bhetki Gondhoraj Baked Patishapta- This was one of my favourites. The Bhetki tasted heavenly. The lime zest gave a much needed zing to the taste. I was very much impressed by this dish. Highly recommended.

*Mutton khichuri- This was my absolute favourite among all the dishes that I tasted. Khichuri mixed with minced meat served with chutney, raita, papad and posto-markel bora. It also had two very succulent pieces of Mutton. The khichuri itself was mind blowing. I plan to go back again just for that khichuri. It was just THAT good. The Mutton pieces were soft and juicy and very well-cooked. The bora made of coconut and poppy seeds was crispy and crunchy. The mango chutney was pretty good. It was a bit spicy which added to the taste. The raita was great too.

*Chicken Palanna- It is actually a Pulao but much more tastier. Pal means meat and Anna is rice. So, it's rice mixed with minced meat. It had a strong smell of saffron which was really unique. And the taste was marvellous.

*Pahari Chicken- Chicken cooked in paste of Spinach. I loved the taste, though it pales in comparison to Mutton Khichuri. I could really taste the spinach in it as well as the chicken. The amount of oil could be a bit less. Otherwise it was perfect.

*Paratha- These were made of Atta which was softer and easier to digest.

*Bhapa Paneer- Steamed Cottage cheese in coconut paste taste superb. Me, being a coconut lover, couldn't get enough of it. Sadly I was already too full to enjoy more of it.

*Mango Patishapta-The crepe was made of mango pulp and the filling was of kheer. This one was one of my favourites. I loved the crepe. It felt like I was actually having mango. The filling was great too. But the outside part was just too delicious.

*Chocolate Patishapta- Here the the crepe had the flavour of chocolate. The filling was kheer. The patishapta was served in chocolate sauce which doubled the taste. The innovations were really unique and praise-worthy. They have succeeded in commercialising a mostly seasonal dish.

*Baked Patishapta-It was a great dessert as well, but it was a bit too sweet for my taste. But it was delicious nonetheless.

*Nolengur icecream Gokul-This one was an absolute favourite too. Highly recommended from my side. It has Gokul pithe submerged in Nolengur icecream. Just looking at it made me salivate. The Gokul pithe was soft and crunchy. The Nolengur icecream was out of the world.

We were also served Gondhoraj soda and masala cold drinks. Both of them were good. One thing that is worth mentioning here is that they don't use any added sugar in any of the desserts which is really a big thing.
Thank you Nabanita chatterjee for hosting us so warmly.
And thank you

True to its tag, one will be reminiscing their mum's food. Very cozy atmosphere and very delicious food.
The hostess was generous with each plate. Nothing that you ordered was not capable of filling you till the brim!

Often we leave out the dips and sauces and accompaniments with the main dishes but here I would mention the "mustard and curd sauce" that was served was A Star in itself.
The "coconut and post bora" was something so different yet very traditionally put together. The papads, salads, chutneys and raita, all of it together made each dish complete.

Moving towards the dishes, we had quite an array!
The passion in their making was evident in their taste!

The chicken and cheese crepe and the cilantro fish crepe (a western version of a patisapta) was a savoury take on the classical patisapta dessert in all its glory!! Filling and sumptuous!

We also tasted the "chicken polanno" (if that's how it's pronounced) a borderline dish between a Biryani and pulao with essence of kewra water and saffron probably ; and "the mutton khichdi" this honestly made me think of my mother. Beauty on plate...full of flavours and very easily available ingredients were chosen to create something so tasteful!
As a career choice I have to play with complicated ingredients on a daily basis but to see the household stuff that lie around ,create such magic at this outlet, was fascinating.

We also tasted the "pahari chicken" ,a cilantro rich meat preparation, along with paratha.
Another star to the whole platter was the "Paneer infused beautifully with mustard and coconut", a break from the makhnis and butter masala, this was something very new!

For Desserts we had 3 variations of patisapta "chocolate, mango and baked", along with a gokul pithe nolen gur tinted ice cream. This couldn't go wrong! The very authentic and rooted dish of Bengali's with a very innovative approach.

Also must mention the drinks which included gondhoraj lemon lassi and lemonade and magic touch. Very refreshing!

I wish all the luck to this eatery and abundance of wishes for future success !

Cheers! :)
Thanking

Recently ordered pahadi paneer and mango patishapta from here just to try out the food on hearing only good things about this place. 
The food did not fail to amaze me. The paneer used was fresh paneer which tasted sublime in the green coriander based gravy and the patishapta was soft and delicious. 
I've been on the lookout for tasty and healthy Bengali food for a while now, and I've finally found it.
Thank you Pithe Bilashi!

Chicken vapa : tastes ordinary.
Baked patisapta : tastes good, innovative one.
Nolen ice cream gokul : sooo tasty, like to have it again and again.
Plus point : good rustic decoration, calm atmosphere, earthen utensils.
Minus point : have to wait long after order, uniform of the staff little shabby.

Went there today. Beautiful decoration, good seating arrangement. Available parking space. Was overwhelmed with the presence of both veg and non veg pithes.
Very alert staff.
Though I am always game for experiments, I was not in mood today for trying out the non veg series of pithes. Instead I opted to choose baked patisapta, mango puli and Nolen gur ice cream Gokul.
Mango puli arrived first. It was in a custard form with the puli submerged in it.  Delicious. Then arrived nolen gur ice cream Gokul. Heavenly. Lastly baked patisapta. It was not so good as the previous ones. Sticky and very sweet. 
Aromatic Gandhoraj soda completed the course.

Chanced upon this restaurant while passing that way. The concept, based on pithes and pulis is unique. 
The ambience is pleasant.
We ordered butter fish patishapta, chicken mug pull, masla paratha and chicken khichuri.
The butter fish patishapta tasted good but was too pricey. The mug chicken puli were also tasty. 
The masala parathas did not make their mark.
The Chicken khichuri was good. The piston board were very small. And the green doi, yellow sauce and the chutney were too watery.
It was a nice experience but not overwhelming.

Located near Rashbehari metro., this place serves Bengali food. We had there :
Chicken khichuri : everything about it is awesome. Posto narkol bora green doi as accompaniment tastes very good.
Pahari chicken : the best. Very different taste.
Butter masala paratha : tastes good. Vegetables are nicely blended. 
Chicken vapa : tastes ordinary.
Baked patisapta : tastes good, innovative one.
Nolen ice cream gokul : sooo tasty, like to have it again and again.
Plus point : good rustic decoration, calm atmosphere, earthen utensils.
Minus point : have to wait long after order, uniform of the staff little shabby.

পিঠে বিলাসী একটু অন্য মাত্রা!  অন্য স্বাদ! অন্য রকম। বাঙালী তার নিজস্ব স্বাদ হারাতে বসেছে যে সময়ে সেই সময়ে দাড়িয়ে পিঠে বিলাসী বাঙালীকে তার অতীত মনে করিয়ে দিতে, মা ঠাকুমার স্বাদ, প্রকরণ আমাদের জীবন থেকে যখন প্রায় নিশ্চিহ্ন তখন সেই মন ভিজিয়ে দেওয়া স্বাদ, গন্ধে, স্পর্শে ফেলে আসা দুর্মূল্য সেই সব স্মৃতি খুরে জাগিয়ে মন এলোমেলো করে দেয়!

Went there today. Beautiful decoration, good seating arrangement. Available parking space. Was overwhelmed with the presence of both veg and non veg pithes.
Very alert staff.
Though I am always game for experiments, I was not in mood today for trying out the non veg series of pithes. Instead I opted to choose baked patisapta, mango puli and Nolen gur ice cream Gokul.
Mango puli arrived first. It was in a custard form with the puli submerged in it.  Delicious. Then arrived nolen gur ice cream Gokul. Heavenly. Lastly baked patisapta. It was not so good as the previous ones. Sticky and very sweet. 
Aromatic Gandhoraj soda completed the course.

Chanced upon this restaurant while passing that way. The concept, based on pithes and pulis is unique. 
The ambience is pleasant.
We ordered butter fish patishapta, chicken mug pull, masla paratha and chicken khichuri.
The butter fish patishapta tasted good but was too pricey. The mug chicken puli were also tasty. 
The masala parathas did not make their mark.
The Chicken khichuri was good. The piston board were very small. And the green doi, yellow sauce and the chutney were too watery.
It was a nice experience but not overwhelming.

We have been following Pithe Bilashi's journey from almost the beginning. We were at first a bit unsure about their new venture near Kalighat. However, it turned out to be the best place for Bengali food in Calcutta and we are EXTREMELY DELIGHTED to have savoured their delicacies! The meat Khichuri is one of the bests you will get anywhere - at traditional houses or restaurants. The quantity is more than expected (and I hope it remains that way - the quality of ingredients are great, healthy. The Gokul Pithe with Nolan gur ice cream is a must! The palanna is also very very tasty. The accompanying green doi and the mango/amshotto chutney and the posto-ccconut bora are superb as well. The space will be filled with people in the days to come, home delivery apps will be collaborating as well.
