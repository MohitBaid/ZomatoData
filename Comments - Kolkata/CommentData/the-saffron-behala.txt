This restau is located few minutes from my place still I didn't know about this. Thanks to Zomato for letting me know about the restaurant. The taste of foods are soo good, so their are so much varieties of dishes. Prices are ok. Very nice ambience and extremely impressed by the hospitality of the staffs. I liked the postbox style billing system very much. It's really unique. 
I hope they ll keep it up and develop more in coming days

Ordered dinner from saffron on 1st jan. Got the delivery on time. I had ordered for mutton biryani with egg , murg tikka masala and butter naan.. The mutton biryani was really delicious and very lite. The mutton was also very tender and flavourful.. Murg tikka butter masala was very good in taste... Butter naan was also very soft and flavourful.. Prices are pocket friendly.. Only i have one complain is that they haven't given the egg of the mutton biryani as i had ordered.. Otherwise  no complaint really very much satisfied with the food.. Looking forward to try some more dishes of The saffron..
Really u r justifying the name 'The saffron' with ur flavourful dishes at very pocket friendly price and with the awesome decor of the restaurant along with the music..

So, I was bored of the food available in Joka and Saffron was courteous enough to deliver at IIMC. Ordered Veg Kadhai and Roti. What is with Calcutta, Spice and oil? There was a small bowl full of oil the kadhai was swimming in. The spice was so sharp that i couldnt figure out the taste of the food. Roti was perfect!

I wanted to visit this place from long time since I tasted their food couple of times through Swiggy. Eventually, we paid a visit and the ambience was decent and also a special look was there with the Christmas decorations around. We ordered Bread basket along with Delhi Chicken and Gosth keema masala and Virgin Mojitos. The keema was outstanding as usual and the Bread basket was good too. But I would recommend that the Bread basket is a bit heavy for two people as the size of all the breads are in XLs. The Delhi Chicken was their special dish for the day, which was ok-ok by means of taste. The staffs are very courteous and friendly which definitely increases your comfort zone. Overall, its a spice lovers joint and reasonable as well. Will visit soon.

Had a great time at The Saffron.
Good hospitality.
Great decor.
Excellent and quick serving.
Great taste.
Reasonable price.
Went to have dinner with my mom. Ordered Regular chicken manchow soup, pan fried chilli fish, chicken chinese chopsuey, mushroom in sauce of your choice (our choice was dry chilli mushroom with schezwan sauce) and fresh lime soda. Returned home being fully satisfied and fuller belly.
Only one negative point is in the serving of chinese chosuey in that the gravy of the chopsuey was served with the crispy fried noodles so the crispiness was lost while serving it. It must be served in two different bowls to retain the crunchiness and authentic style of chopsuey.

Was hearing a lot about this place so thought of ordering online. 

The order was mixed noodles and murg tandoor butter masala.

The quantity was very good. But the chicken pieces were stiff and chewy. It could have tasted much nicer if the pieces of chicken were a bit soft. But on the other hand the mixed noodles was quite nice and tasty. 

It was just two of the regular dishes. Will visit soon and taste the other delicacies.

I had a horrible experience from this restaurant. I don't know how people are rating this restaurant 3 or 4. I will give rather negative rating. I ordered 2 Mutton Biriyani and 1 Salt and Pepper chicken through Zomato. Firstly the order was delivered 30 minutes late. The delivery guy was a dumb person. He had no idea about even prominent locations in Barisha (like Silpara). The restaurant even after confirming my address sent this dumb person, which clearly shows their damn care attitude towards customers. Coming to food, it was already cold by the time it was delivered to me. The potato in the biriyani was raw. In short the food quality is deteriorating day by day. The biriyani rice was bland and tasteless. If i compare my first order from saffron with this order, it is heaven and hell difference. Thanks Saffron for such a nice experience. This is probably my last order from this restaurant.¬†
One more thing I would like to inform saffron, I am not going to pay for this order. Since my order was through Simpl Pay app, let saffron make mutual understanding with Simpl pay. I am not going to pay my hard earned money to have some junk stale cold food with horrible delivery experience.

We were in search for a decent delivery option and found this place at zomato. We have not seen this restaurant yet and was little skeptical about the quality. However, their menu card and other pictures at zomato looked pretty good. We ordered for peas pulao, gosht handi and macchi makhni masala. The delivery was super-fast and the packaging was well done. In addition, quantity of food was a big plus. Now coming to food quality, each item scored really high. Peas pulao had good numbers of peas with cashew-nut and raisin and was aromatic. We really liked the macchi makhni masala; a perfectly cooked basa fish in a semi-spicy gravy with adequate proportions of spices. Handi gosht, too, tasted very well and it had succulent pieces of mutton with a tomato and half a boiled egg in a gravy. Importantly, both the gravies were quite distinct, taste- as well as preparation-wise; unlike of a food-joint offering different animal proteins in a similar gravy while naming the items ornamental. We enjoyed our meal and would love to visit this restaurant for a dine-out.

We ordered Mutton Bryani and Gosht Rara. Food was packed with utmost care. The Biryani was spicier than what we usually have. It was yummy anyways. It came with two juicy pieces of mutton. Gosht Rara was bursting with flavors. Food quantity was huge. Price is quite pocket friendly.

Went to this place for casual dining with 2 other friends. To be frank, I was actually shocked to see this type of ambiance. Didn't expect it to be too good. Soft music was playing in the background. Ordered 1 tandoori chicken full, 1 cheese chicken kebab, 2 butter naan, 1 chicken Biryani, 1 Reshmi Butter masala. Every item is pretty tasty. The service is also very nice. Now comes the best part, the cost of these items is pretty low. It was kind of a shock when all these items came for just 835 rs. I recommend it to everyone.

The ambience was really nice. The chicken Reshmi kabab and the Murg tandoor was really succulent, creamy and delicious. The chicken afghani pulao was the best. Don't go by it's bland looks as it has a really subtle flavour and it is very much enjoyable on its own. The chicken butter masala had creamy and well cooked pieces of chicken. The gosht kasha was really nice, both sweet and savoury. Was too full to try desserts!

A restaurant which could give Barbecue and Peter Cat a run for their money.
Ambience - Just the right amount of light with the retro feel. Loved the cars on the wall. bet most people can't even tell their names. a great idea to start conversations. the decor was perfect to my taste. 5 out 5
Service - For a place tucked away on Biren Roy Road west, it is more than a surprise when you are greeted with warmth and courtesy. I mean we didnt expect to be treated as specials but they did it. 5 out of 5
Time - The saffron ensured that we did not have to wait for long nor was it so quick that we doubted the quality of food. so don't expect fast food service but enjoy your time with the special ones without hurry. 4 out of 5
Menu - the menu is exhaustive and the chef seemed to be confident enough to dish out anything. I stuck to the basic though and it was just yum... 4 out of 5
Food - The most important thing about a restaurant is the food and The Saffron has nailed it here for sure. Wherever you may have dined but surely the food here is comparable and maybe better than the best. 5 out of 5
Verdict - if you are not the alcoholic types but want to enjoy the genuinely authentic tastes of India then the Saffron is indeed the place.

This is by far the best decorated eatery in Behala. You cannot satisfy your eyes until you drop by this place. The chess board like flooring, the hanging lights, the colorful seaters, the big colorful sketch, the wall decorations everything just sums up to create an extraordinary interior. However, talking about satisfying the belly, the food is 'wow' too. We ordered all Chinese items from the bulky menu. The mixed fried rice and mixed hakka chow mein were great. There were good enough amount of veggies and shredded chicken, egg and prawn. Then in the side dish we ordered hunan chicken gravy and mandarin chicken gravy. Though the hunan chicken tasted a bit bland it was nice too. The mandarin chicken was very delicious. The gravy was rich and varied in its components. 
The washroom was clean and even it was decorated with eclectic designs. The service was little bit slow.

In the neighbourhood comes this new eatery. As I have not been to the place I cannot comment on the interiors. I have ordered food from there a couple of times (thru zomato and swiggy) and surprisingly found the food to be decent for a quick bite in the night of sudden food pangs..i have ordered Chinese and Indian from this joint. Both the cuisines tasted fine. I found the food to be a bit more oily to my liking. I shall not recommend the biryani from here and soup needs to be worked upon. But overall I found it good enough to include in my list of joints to be ordered from in the locality.

Located just opposite to the end of East India Pharmaceuticals in Jhautala, this new restaurant is one of the gems you can find along Biren Roy Road. Because a beautiful ambience, comfortable seating with cozy corners and good music made me feel right at home after ordering Mutton Biryani and American Chopsuey which was easily the best I have ever had. The mutton of the biryani could've been a bit more tender but it managed to satisfy the taste buds so no complains. Their service was good enough to make me give this restaurant a well deserved full score and my first Zomato review. I'll surely be back again! :)

It was an unplanned visit to this place. We searched for many restaurants in Zomato and found this hidden outlet.
On checking the pictures out we found it a decent place.
It took us a little time to search this place.
For the sake of reaching here in a jiffy kindly locate diamond plaza Apartment on Biren Roy Road Behala. This restaurant falls just opposite to the landmark mentioned above.
We were taken to the second floor and the room was vacant but the ambience attracted us the most.
It was like a music room with proper lights and colour of the wall was very soothing to the eyes.
They had very modern lightning all over the room.
The staff who attended was very nice and humble.
I asked him for suggestion and he added that whatever we choose the chef will prepare it to our choice.
That is exactly what happened.
We ordered for Chicken Manchow Soup. It had the tinge of authentic asian cuisine. We enjoyed every bite.
Next after searching the menu(that had gallons of options) our eyes got stuck to the name Chello Kabab. On our mind we went back to Peter Cat.
Here they had the option of chicken,mutton and veg Chello kabab.
When it arrived the aroma filled the room.
The plating was amazing.
The rice was perfectly cooked and the butter was just perfect.
We shared one plate of chello kabab since we were planning to research some more options.
The mutton kababs were melting in the mouth. It was heavenly. For a minute i couldnot compare the authentic chello kabab of peter cat. A must try!
Next we ordered for chicken tikka butter masala and requested to avoid any sweet flavours.
It was delivered as promised. Big chunks of chicken tikka in creamy gravy was simply PERFECT.
The tandoor butter roti and the garlic nun was just perfect to the 'T'.
We both were over satisfied with the food they served.
Lastly we ordered for a mocktail. It was virgin pinacolada. That was soothing and refreshing.
The food was fresh and it truly tantalized our tastes buds.
Looking forward to visit this place again. Would love to try their prawns and gravy noodles.
The menu was huge. To cover all our favourite dishes a one time visit will never be enough.
Lastly,the bill came to Rs 745. We were simply shocked. A food like that is worth every penny..
I simply say it to all food lovers..... no one can eat just once‚ò∫

The Saffron is a newly opened multi cuisine in my locality. Even though the restaurant has started taking baby steps in the food industry, it has showed that it might become a strong contender. 
I've ordered biriyani and kebabs and kulcha for dinner on dusherra. They did not disappoint. The masala kulcha was a treat. Even though I thought the kebabs and tandoori could've been bettered they were edible. The biriyani was a little dry for me and my family but it was nearly at par and better than the contemporary multi cuisine restaurants I've dined at. 
The service was prompt and swift. Which was a joy.

Ordering food from this place was one of my worst experiences on Zomato. The Durga Puja rush is understable but when you get the delivery at 11 pm after placing the order at 7:30 pm after repeated follow ups, it is simply not done. On top of that, I had to debate with the delivery boy that my payment was already completed while the order was placed.
I was too frustrated to judge the food quality by the time the order arrived, thanks to Zomato, they were courteous enough to provide a refund of my order.
As they say, you never get a second chance to create a first impression, hence, I would discourage people from ordering food from this restaurant.

Location : One has to follow the address given and use GPS to reach here,since it is located a bit far from the DH Road,tucked in Biren Roy Road and close to Jhautala More.
Ambience : The most classy interior among all the restaurants across Kolkata.Well mannered and informative stuffs are worth a special mention.So ambience wise 10/10.
Food : We ordered,
1.Fish Tikka Kebab : Pretty huge tender fish fillets smeared with spices and grilled to perfection,served with a green chutney,baby onions and achaar.
2.Plain naan : Soft,fresh and sweet.
3.Chicken Tikka Butter Masala : One of the best I've tasted so far.The creamy texture is unmatched.
So food wise,a 10/10 too.
A must must visit if you like your dining experience fancy yet pocket friendly üòá 
Oh btw,NO ADDED TAX ! 
So when are you planning your dine at THE SAFFRON? 
And thank me later. üòÅ

Can someone tell WHR this restaurant is  actually located? Is it near sakher bazar?
Difficult to find through maps. And how's the quality of food?

New restaurant just opened a couple of weeks back.
Nice ambiance. I like the way they have designed the interior. Perfectly an eye catcher for the youth. 
The food as expected was amazing. Chicken raza was the best so do try it. Overall an amazing restaurant.

This is a new place which came up in my Nearby options in Zomato. So will only talk about food as I ordered through Zomato.
Stir Fried Crispy Chicken in Red Sauce - This was normal shredded crispy chicken which was rightly done and the crispiness was intact in spite of the fact that it was delivered to home.

Red Hot Pepper Fish - This was delicious. The red hot pepper sauce was just awesome.

Chicken Chelo Kebab - Given the fact that I am a big fan of Peter Cat's Chelo Kebab, firstly thumbs up to the restaurant for making Chelo Kebab available in Behala. The Seekh kebab was bit dry but the other kebab was good which was served with omelette and rice.

Salt N Pepper Chicken - This was good too.

It's a request that please don't show your restaurant open when it's not because today we went there and found that the restaurant was closed. We were extremely disappointed and it was an utter waste of time..
