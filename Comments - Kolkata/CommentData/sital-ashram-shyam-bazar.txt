This very old yet unassuming joint serves cheifly breakfast items at a moderate price.

It is a small but crowded place;hence accommodation sometimes becomes a problem.

Staffs are friendly and super fast.

Recommendation:yes.

A small eatery at shyambazar five point crossing. Popular among the locals, mostly middle aged people. Breakfast and snacks items are served along with tea, coffee, cold coffe, milk shakes etc. Grilled sandwich, varieties of omelette and toasts are served in a comparatively lower rate. Though the place is small and kitchen area is not appealing few experienced staffs try their best to maintain cleanliness and prompt service.
Conclusion: some decent breakfast items in a pocket friendly rate.

Located just near to the 5 point crossing of Shyambazar. One of the best and cheapest place for breakfast. It can be said as the joint for bengali's ''Sosta jolkhabar''. Cheese omlet is just awesome. Don't expect any ambience for this outlet. Good for small adda and breakfast and light foods.  Cheers... ‚úåÔ∏è

A very popular place in shyambzar area for regular office goers and Students. Darjeeling tea is one of the best in the town. Sandwiches are a bit okayish. But the best thing had there is cheese chicken omlet. Ohh that's very cool stuff should try once..
PS: very little space is there u may have to wait some minutes to get a seat.

Sital Ashram is located smack in the middle of the bustling Shyambazar 5 point crossing beside the Dhaka Biriyani House. It is a very unassuming and old joint which serves good quality food at a very reasonable price. 

For quick breakfast or an evening snack, Sital Ashram is one of the go to places in Shyambazar. The seating arrangements are less, so often you will see people having tea or coffee while standing at the road. The featured dish here are Chicken Sandwich, Corn Sandwich and Tea. If someone is feeling particularly indulgent, Chicken Sandwich with extra chicken and mayonnaise is a luxurious delicacy for the tastebuds.

Overall, if someone is looking for a quick bite at a minimum pocket pinch, this is the restaurant for you. Do not expect much regarding ambience though.

This place is located at shyambazar five points crossing.. if you are walking from R.G.Kar Road to A.P.C Road this place will be one of the first shops you can see. I went there few days back.. I ordered French toast and tea.. The price is very reasonable and the service is quick.. If you want to eat some tasty sandwiches,milkshakes or tea in Shyambazar,I will recommend this place..

One of my favourite breakfast place. I visit there frequently. I have tasted all the items in their menu. Food is cheap here. My favourite chicken cheese omelette and chicken toast. Their cold coffee is also delicious. Service is fast.  Their only drawback is a cramped eating space and ordinary decor.

Location is close to Shyam Bazar 5 point crossing. Sital Ashram is good place to have snacks. I tried their Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Grilled Corn Sandwich sharing with my friend. Both the Sandwich was really good in taste and very well made. Prices were also very reasonable.
They didn't take much time to prepare them so service is also decent.

Today I went there for breakfast. I ordered plain sandwich ,egg poch and tea. Food are so fresh and healthy. But sitting arrangement is quite problematic. Whatever I love this place for healthy breakfast at affordable cost. Here I upload the new menu chart.

4 star because for the category of this place. Located on shyambazar 5 point, i think its very old and may be favorite of localities.. I am a foodie who eats everywhere. My recent posts are for places like smokehouse deli, irish house, tgif, pour house, n so on and am not hesitant to write a review of this place.. We wre in shyambazar, wd no idea about place, were we spotted this shabby n small looking, Bathroom tiled place, which had sandwiches and coffee. So we went in. Its a very small place, n very simple roadside eatery kind. But . The toast, the sandwiches, cold coffee, was soo good. I couldn't believe how can they afford to serve u tea in china, and charge just 6rs for that! Breads they use is of good quality. So for foodies, who don't care about the place, hygiene, and just want to spend less and care for sm 'adda' , this local place u can go to.. cold coffee is 30rs, Sandwiches 40rs, Toast 12rs.. many varieties of poached eggs, omelettes etc too

a teeny tiny foot joint at a very well known location i.e. Shyambazar 5 point Crossing.. if you are at this location, ¬†hungry and wanna grab a bite of sandwich or omlette withhout a hole in your pocket this is the place you are looking for.. the grilled egg sandwich is a real treat to the taste buds of your tongue.. the tea is also mindblowing.. this is surely recommended..

Good place for a nice, cheap hangout and good, crunchy food. The location, right near the famous Netaji Statue at Shyambazar, is ideal for office goers to take a sip of the tea and the gorgeous brunch they offer. I would specially recommend to check out the Paneer Sandwich they serve, which is about as good as it gets.

Really easy on the pocket when you are trying to save up, or a chronically broke person with an appetite ( read: me :P ). A small variety of veg and chicken sandwiches to choose from, a few good breakfast items, together with reasonable prices, an alright service and little seating space makes this place like any other food cabin in Kolkata. But the considerable generous amount of the sandwiches means I'm definitely going to go back again :P

As the name suggests, this place has a 80's charm to it. Situated at shyambazar five point crossing, it serves tea, coffee, toast and other snacks stuff in a typical north Calcutta style. 
             Grilled vegetable and corn sandwiches are good. Well stuffed and can be shared by two. But I found the milkshakes ordinary. Can try it if you're hungry but a bit tight on the pocket.

Located near Shyambazar Five Point Crossing (APC Road).
It has no special decor. Has seating arrangements for 20 people(approximately). 
Tried the Cheese Corn Sandwich. It's great and Pocket friendly. Tea is good too.
Service is quick and Staffs are friendly.

Overall, a nice visit. Since this place serves breakfast items mostly, it remains crowded BUT it's worth the wait ! :)

A very small old school cafe, not very decorated.
Yet it can overshadow the footfalls of any fancy cafe.
Bread and butter, French Toast, Sandwiches, Coffees are great.
Price is very pocket friendly.

This was literally a discovery.. I like the grilled corn sandwiches here, after college filling good which is easy on pocket. But tea and coffee tastes like college canteen. Extra price for ketchup is a turn off. The place small, hot and a bit shabby.. But still a last resort when pocket is empty and I need to suffice my appetite

Tiny 5 tables and 20 seater place to have old calcutta type tea, coffee, grilled sandwiches, omelettes etc. in a small budget. This place is old but food is good comparing to the price and quality. Its not easy to spend few hundreds to have snacks every time. We ordered tea, omelettes and butter toast at 9pm. They took 10 minutes to arrive only. Previously, I had grilled chicken, corn, egg sandwiches. They were really good. Sandwiches are easy to get shared between two. However, serving plates and dishes need real change to attract some more customers. Dont you go if you find dirt at every corner even in a tidy place. This place is really Not For All place. You get a quick bite within budget only. Dont expect and complaint.
