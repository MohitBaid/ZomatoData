কলকাতার বড় বাজার এলাকায় অবস্থিত ফাস্ট ফুডের দোকান।  পরিবেশন বেশ দ্রুত।  ব্যবহার ঠিক ঠাক।  খাবারের দাম খুবই কম।  এগ চিকেন রোল নিয়েছিলাম।  স্বাদে সাধারণ মানের।

A small road side food shop, serves Street food and snacks located in bara bazar. Perfect place for quick bite. Tried egg chicken roll, it was quite tasty. Very much pocket friendly.

A small eatery located at Barabazar mainly serving quick bites at a low price.

Service is good.

Tried  Egg Chicken Roll , which was decent with tasty fillings, crispy paratha,  a bit oily though.

Chicken is very good taste. Very good fragrance they use. I m very fond of their chicken fry. A cheap and best item and moreover its among very few restaurants who serve non veg in this area. Street Food at its best !!
