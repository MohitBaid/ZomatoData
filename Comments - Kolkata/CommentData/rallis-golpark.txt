The service is not very good like the Esplannade branch , but the food quality is pretty much the same and as good as the Esplannade's .This place is famous for it's varieties of juices and milkshakes and also famous for it's North Indian and South Indian dishes.
Amongst all according to my opinion , the "Kesar badam lassi" has a unique and incredible taste , it is served in a designer Rallies' glass . Costs only Rs 40. Much reasonable I guess.
Other than this, the "Chocolate cold coffee" also deserves much wows and a unique Rallies preparation.
Apart from this , "Rallies speacial fruit juice" is also a good one.

Been to this place sometime back with a friend of mine. We were craving for kulfi so we bulged in here. The place looks like a mini coop. We ordered for kulfi and paid in the counter. We headed upstairs and sat. The place is small and lit with few tubelights. The kulfi was served in steel plates which I personally didn't like. It tasted a bit salty and was upto the expectation. It was an average experience here. @

A very old shop in golpark. I came here when I was in school. That's like 7 years back. It's just beside the Golpark Aminia. The ground floor sells fruit juice and all types of lassis and syrups. We decided to go upstairs and taste their chats. 
Ordered for one masala dosa, mixed chat, rose syrup and green mango syrup. The dosa was crisp. Chat tasted really good. The syrups were okay. 
The chats and fruit juice are their specialities. I don't know how they taste now. Back then it was one of the best places to munch since there weren't so many cafes except for a CCD which was pretty expensive for school students.

I have been to this place umpteenth times and never been disappointed. The place is located in Golpark area just opposite to Koshe Kosha. It runs really busy during holi. There's a small seating area on the mezzanine floor accommodating about 18 people at a time. The kulfi is really good. Other than that I would recommend Paw bhaji, Chole bhature, any kind of Dosa, Mixed chat. All kinds of syrups, fruit juice and lassi taste heavenly. But there is a policy that you can't only order beverages if you take a table. Pocket pinch is really low. So keeping the decor and ambience aside you might give this place a try for its yummy food and 'oh-so-awesome' lassi and fruit juice.

I have been to ralli's esplanade and trust me..this branch of theirs's is not even close. Space shortage is not the only problem. Although the menu at both branches is same but the availability is not. I went to this place today around 5pm n ordered cheese masala dosa n kulfi. The boy who took our orders informed that there is no kulfi available. We were very disappointed because my mother came only for the kulfi. Service was quick but the dosa that came was burnt partially, not enough cheese was there. Very disappointed.

This is literally a very small eatery, best for unplanned dates. That's exactly why my partner and I ended up here this evening.
He ordered a Cheese Masala Dosa and I ordered a chhola bhatura.
The dosa cost Rs.110 and the chhola bhatura came for Rs.85. It was value for money as the food was really filling and tasted great.
The service was very personal and efficient.
Definitely coming back for the beverages which we couldn't have today because of a cold.

Although this place gets a huge hype during Holi, I think it needs to be on everyone's summer special list! I haven't ever tried their Holi special bhaang so can't comment on that.

But yesterday, in the scorching heat, Ralli's turned out to be my saviour. My friend and I had dropped in to try out their Lassi, and we were surprised on seeing that they had a seating area in the mezzanine floor! I've been living in South Calcutta all my life, crossing Ralli's atleast twice a week and I was unaware of this fact! I should totally die.

Anyway I was overjoyed that we had gotten an AC outlet to relax over glasses of chilled Lassi. There's one rule that needs to be followed and that is, you can't just order a beverage and sit up. Well, we were quite broke and on seeing the menu we were relieved. It is soooooo cheap!

So without wasting much time, we ordered for a Masala Dosa and two glasses of Mango Lassi. The masala dosa came in no time and tasted brilliant at only 80 bucks. My only complain is the amount of masala served. It was very less compared to the enormous size of the dosa. Plus the sambhar tasted slightly bland. So maybe that needs to be rectified.

Coming to the Lassi, it was divine!! I haven't tasted such amazing Lassi and that too at only Rs. 35. I swear I couldn't believe it. You gotta try their lassis to believe me. Having loved the Mango Lassi so much, we quickly ordered 2 glasses of Strawberry Lassi! And this was another stunner. How I loved it!!!

Bill - 215. Perfect value for money!

My suggestion is, order some small grub and keep ordering the lassis! They'll blow your mind. My summer saviour is here, what about you?

Location- Situated beside aminia and opposite to koshe  kosha stands Ralli's-  my one stop destination for light foods. 
Ambience- Small yet not congested, simple decorations, calm and quite environment. At first I could never think that it has got a sitting arrangement at the top. Nice. 
Food- Okay. Pau bhaji was good. Green mango lassi was refreshing. Kesar lassi was best. üòä
Attendants were polite and so good. 
It was a nice experience.

This place deserves a 4.0 rating, if you judge them for value-for-money. They are very good at what they offer. The dosas, be it rava masala or simply masala, are huge and extremely filling. The Jaljeera sweet and salted go well with the main course. Their lassis are good as well, but are appetite-killers, as milk products usually are.

Whenever I think of Ralli's, it only reminds of Holi every year. After playing with colours with friends, we always visit this place for their Bhaang which is exclusively available during that time. Along with Bhaang, they have a wide range of other drinks too. I mostly go with their Lassi.

Forget the fancy summer mocktails with this and that ingredients that you have never heard of, ¬†and relish a bit of the summer in desi style with bright coloured syrup + soda + sugar syrup quenchers, a lot like those enticing soda-walas thelas outside Victoria Memorial, except served in a much more hygienic and clean manner.¬†

My khus soda drink was vibrantly green, and equally refreshing. Maa's Mango Lassi, was basically mango syrup lassi, and it was a bit sweet, but still quite nice.¬†

We also sat on a table set out on the footpath since their interiors were getting repaired and had a Paw Bhaji. The Paw was decent, but the bhaji was more masala than sabji, and hence didn't win my heart over as much as MIssion Cafe's Pau Bhaji does, which is located a stone's throw away from Ralli's.

The pocket pinch was very reasonable and I loved the experience, sans sitting on the footpath, which I am guessing won't be a repeat experience.

In verdict : Drinks that cause colour riots always win our "young" hearts, bringing back memories of childhood when parents would prohibit us from having them since they were not served clean. But, don't you remember how your heads turned with desire to try those bright orange, yellow,green and blue drinks, with the secret determination that when you grow old, you will try them all ¬†? For that, come to Ralli's.

This is a small eatery located on one of the lanes close to Mouchak, Golpark. It was a Saturday afternoon in the month of June, when I stepped into this place and I was really surprised to find that it's air conditioned, which is totally a shocking fact, if judged from the exterior look. Coming to the food, I ordered for a plate of pav bhaji and a mango lassi. The pav was well buttered and the mashed pototao masala was tasty, though a little watery. The lassi, though inconsistent, had the chill to provide the required refreshment from the hot summer. The pocket pinch was too less. Hence, this place deserves a second visit !

If you are in golpark and you want to have dosa and quench your thirst for lassi then Ralli's is an appropriate joint. The place is just sufficient to fit a handful of people. 

Location- mouchak and aminia is the landmark. Its beside aminia opposite kose kosha

Food: coming to the food, we had cheese masala dosa,kesar lassi and cool blue/blue lagoon.

Cheese masala dosa- it was okhayish. Not the good. I  found grated cheese above the dosa and a bit mixed with the filling(alu poor). Personally i didnt like it.

Lassi- i loved it. It was not too sweet. Yummy.

Cool blue/blue lagoon- not good. It doesnt have that refreshing element in it neither contains that fizziness. 

Ralli's is known mainly for its variety of lassi, kulfi and various types of drinks. One should definately try their lassis but i wont recommend cool blue.

diverse options for coolers and shakes

does justice to your pocket.¬†
cons-
not a place for hungry bellies

¬†i found mocktails and syrups very ordinary.¬†

recommended- lassi, shakes, pao bhaji, and dosa.
we ordered ¬†pao bhaji, blue lagoon syrup and green mango with soda. somehow the combination didnot work. sometime experiment doesnot conclude a positive result though :p¬†

try it. get yourself some good meal. :)

One of the most popular places in Golpark. Chaats and Dahi vadas are just so amazing. Apparently most at demand during Holi.  When you go low on the pocket, give it a try..

Ralli's is one of the popular places in Golpark and everyone knows about this hub quiet well. The place is located in Golpark, in the opposite street to the famous sweet shop Mouchak. It has been many times I visited this place. The place is small and nothing to talk about its ambience as such. 
Service:
Pretty good, well behaved , fast

Food & Drinks
This place is known for its Lassi , Mocktails and Milkshakes. They also make good South Indian dishes. The Masala Dosa ans Sambar Vada is what I like the most. The lassi is more on the liquid side and can be lil thicker.

Last words:
Good food in very minimum price. This place is worth the price you will pay. A very pocket friendly place to have some good snacks and drinks.

3.5/5 for this place

Tried their kesar kulfi with falooda. Absolutely yum! I am a huge kulfi fan, and this ticked so many boxes for me. I only wish the size was a little bigger, because it is smaller than the usual ones I have had. But the kulfi absolutely cuts like butter and tastes brilliant.

If you are looking for a place to quench your thirst in this hot scorching heat of summer, at a reasonable and affordable rates, this is the place to come to. Located in one of the bylanes at Golpark, very close to the iconic Mouchak, this place has been serving delicious South Indian staples and cool refreshment since ages now. I have never had the opportunity to try their Dosas or Idlis, but did come here a couple of time to enjoy their drinks.

Tried their Sweet & Salted Lassi, Rose Lassi, Strawberry Lassi, Mango Lassi, Green Mango Soda, Green Mango (Lemon) with Soda, Soda Masala Syrup and many other things. All of them deserves special praise, but one requires to stir them well before putting in the first sip. The owner here is very courteous and interactive. Pocket pinch is definitely less.

Okay so in the busy atmosphere of Golpark where so many restaurants are located you have one place to have a nice ending to your wholesome meal . So how about you have a nice dinner or lunch at any of the superstar restaurants there and then have a cooler at Ralli's ? 

Trust me, it is one hell of an amazing idea. Very well known for coolers, juice, floats, mocktails, kulfi and lassi. Today we had "Kesar Badam Lassi" and gosh it was so good . It was cool , yummy and fulfilling . Bole to ekdum "Paisa wasool " . A gem for 35 rupees. Wish we had an outlet close to my house. But will really go back for more refreshing stuff. :)

South Indian food is an all time craving and Ralli's at Golpark is the place to be during such cravings. The place may seem small and crammed but the food served here is delicious. The interior is lit by yellow lights and there are solid chairs and tables. The menu is versatile and try their Masala Dosa, Chana Batura, Dahi Vada, Mixed Chaat and basically all the tasty tangy items on the menu. The Lassi and milkshakes are quite tasty and refreshing as well.

What do you do when you have hunger pangs and not much moolah in your purse?
You go to Ralli's. Suggested by my friend, we went there mad with hunger. 
And the end of our meal we have had 3 sweet lassi, 2 paw bhaji and 1 plate cheese dosa for just 340 rupees.

The food was of great taste. The paw of the law bhaji had good amount of butter and the bhaji was well mixed. Had cheese dosa sans the filling and it was great. The sambar was of the perfect consistency. Neither too sour nor too plain.

Great place to have good food at reasonable prices.

It is a small and cozy place hidden from the hustle and bustle of Golpark.They serve excellent South-Indian and North-Indian food.I would personally recommend the "Onion Cheese Uttapam" , a must-have.Only improvement they need to make is in service,order delivery is very late,sometimes the waiters forget to bring a part of the order.
I have been here so many times,evenings,and Ralli's is going to hold a very special place in my heart for a very special reason....

A nice little place to let the summer heat down, Rallis has been quenching thirsts since like forever. A veg restaurant, they use to serve excellent chole bhature if you keep aside their excellence in shakes and stuff.
Mango milk shake and Chocolate shake are my personal favourites though. 

P S if your height is towering over 6'0" or so avoid their seating space. You may have to crawl.

The ambiance isn't that great, rather on the cramped up side. But it's situated at a good location, right at the heart of Golpark near Mouchak.
Been here many times during my college days. Perfect place to eat chaats n South Indian dishes. When one can get tasty food at pocket friendly prices then who cares about the ambiance! :D

A cosy little joint with a small winding staircase & accomodative capacity of approximately 18 people has been a very happy hunting ground for school goers and college teens.That is where the main business comes for the owner.Being very pocket friendly in nature this place has witnessed many group gatherings,patch up & break up's over syrup.
Ralli's is not only a restaurant but also manufacturers of syrups.The variety includes orange,mango,blue lagoon,aam panna,kesar,badam,pineapple & rose with my favourite being green mango.Now a days they have introduced a few mocktails & section for syrups with milk .The syrups are moderately priced from rs15 to 40.
Food varities ranges from 30 to 90 with primary focus being south indian.Few noteable being Rawa dosa,Plain & Masala dosa,Mixed chaat,Cheese utthapam and Chana batoora.
The prices they charge are inclusive of taxes but the service at times might be little sloppy.I am a frequent visitor here not only because i stay nearby but also due to the fact that this place brings back many childhood and school day memories which i cherish.

Beware!!!!!! 
This is the worst possible place ( can't even call it a " restaurant ") you can ever visit. It is a small dark shabby place.The waiters  don't have any sort of decency or manners. When i entered i saw 2-3 cockroaches running here and there on the table and the waiters didn't seem bothered about that as well. I ordered a blue lagoon syrup along with a rava masala dosa. The syrup tasted like a medicine and I couldn't have more than a sip of it. When i complained they didn't do anything about it. The dosa was okay but nothing great. So overall a horrible experience. 
P.S :- having food from this place can be given as a " dare " task to do in a game of " truth and dare ". I would have given a negative rating had zomato not stopped me.

I have not been there quite many times but the times i have i remember having amazing milk shakes and koolfi. So itvwas no surprise when we were passing this joint after a heavy dinner and decided to drop in for some refreshments.  We ordered rose milk, green apple soda, badam milk, lassi and the special koolfi. The dining area was cramped but we managed to squeeze through. The service was quick enough and the milk items were great but we didn't quite like the green apple soda which was too sweet. The koolfi was the icing of the whole evening because of its unique texture and the oodles of faluda on top. The total bill didn't quite burn a hole in our pockets!

Good south indian food, dosas are quite crispy and the stuffings are good. The fruit juices are excellent, the guys don't put excess sugar. Can improve a little bit on the chaats though. And improve the servicing. Too much waiting time.

I have not been there quite many times but the times i have i remember having amazing milk shakes and koolfi. So itvwas no surprise when we were passing this joint after a heavy dinner and decided to drop in for some refreshments.  We ordered rose milk, green apple soda, badam milk, lassi and the special koolfi. The dining area was cramped but we managed to squeeze through. The service was quick enough and the milk items were great but we didn't quite like the green apple soda which was too sweet. The koolfi was the icing of the whole evening because of its unique texture and the oodles of faluda on top. The total bill didn't quite burn a hole in our pockets!

I have been visiting this place for over a decade now, ever since my childhood. The place is tiny, yet cozy. There is something about the low ceiling which tall people might bang their heads against, but i somehow feel it adds to their charm. The dosas and Utthapams and idlis and vadas here absolutely delicious and value for money. So are all the sherbets, especially the rose sherbet. Every year around Holi, they also serve Thandai and i head there every time as it is one the best Thandai that i've had.

This joint is very small. Approx 16 seats are there. If you are tall then your head will definitely tough the ceiling. Ac were working perfect. The staff behavior is very good but you will not ind all items available. i tried to order vada , tikka which were not available. so have to satisfy my tummy with chola batura. In juice we tried pineapple juice, strawberry milk shake, green mango syrup, mango juice. pineapple and green apple juice was fine. strawberry milk shake was also tasty but i don't like mango juice as it taste don't good. water quantity was greater than mango. Chole batura was the best.

have been visiting there for years now..be it the refreshing sodas(have tried almost all of them) or the special kulfi or the cheese dosa, rallis have been quite a pocket friendly zone. their bhang is a must have on holi as well.¬†
though i have complains about the staircase that leads to the restaurant.

Ralli's has been a great place to freshen up during the summer times since the time I was in school. Over the years, This place has great syrups which are very tasty. I am not much of a south indian fan so cannot comment on that. I mostly went there for refreshing drinks at very little price. Also they make a great Thandai during Holi which is something to look forward to.

If you are looking for authentic south Indian Rallis is not for you but amalgamation of tasty street food and south Indian would make UR day. To refresh you mood beverages rock... Grab rose soda its fab..various floats also are impressive

Fhaluda is the word when its rallis. A late night after meal stop for kulfi phaluda. Not many places in kolkata offer phaluda. Have been a visitor to the place for 3 years now and the taste remains the same.

A nice cosy place on the first floor.... The place is packed with a few tables and chairs. Air conditioning is available. The dishes are sufficient for more than one people. The Chhola Bhatura and Masala Dosas are absolutely huge ! A full dish makes you feel like you've had too much! The food is great . A nice place for catching up with people over light vegetarian food. :)

I have been to this place since I was a child as this one is in my neighborhood. Ralli's meant Sharbat's and syrup's for me but unfortunately they do not allow to Sit and have drinks , you must definitely order food items or they will not allow you to sit which is absolutely disgusting!! They have hiked the price a lot...... a lot!!!!!! and that's why I don't prefer to come here anymore. Anyways, the food quality is still good and they still make amazing drinks like always. During holi, a bhang Sharbat is a must here !!

Well every time I have been here,I have caught a cold the very next day almost.
Ralli's is a brand one would generally associate with syrups and sherbets.
I have visited this place many a times coz of my relatives living in the same locality.
The Rose Khus syrup is a Ralli's special and more commonly known as the Ralli's Rose Syrup.
For some food one must go for the Pav Bhaji,Kachori and dahi phuchka.End your food fiesta with the special kulfi and falooda.
This place serves some really great food at a reasonable cost.Be it friends/family/first timers this place will simply add some more spice to your taste buds....

During my school days we friends used to flock to this place as we were really hungry after a tiring day.. located in the lane beside Mouchak just after Aminia.. a very small place but offers very good Dahi phuchka, Chana batura, Dosas and Kulfi.. I just loved the food here.. Have not visited this place for quite long as I dont live in Kolkata now.. But i really miss the food there..

Ralli's is a name I associate with syrups and sherbets since as a kid I always saw the Rose , Khus and Kalakhatta Syrups at our place ..... I am not a fan of rose but the other two remain favourites of mine right to this day. I think the colours fascinated me as a kid and there is still that happy feeling when I visit and my glass of whatever I have ordered is placed in front of me :-) The Khus Lemon with Soda is the perfect summer cooler for me still. I am not a big fan of the south indian fare but the Chole Bhature , Pav Bhaji , Dahi Kachori and Mixed Chaat are yummy. Their Kulfi's are not bad but give the falooda , the kulfi by itself tastes a lot nicer.

Ralli's - Name always reminds me of soda's like Rose and Khus!
=======================================================
Brief:
I had been roaming around in Golpark and planned to visit Ralli's. What made me visit? Well, my eyes caught on food. Yes, i had just thought that they just serve you with soda's and drinks. However, food made me visit inside. As i went inside, they had a small type of entrance from which when you go up through a very narrow staircase you reach on top. I feel its the inadequate space which made them make like this. The ceilings were very low. 
=======================================================
Food and Drinks: 

I had ordered: - 

1) Sambhar Vada (45 bucks inc. taxes) - The sambhar vada was served to me with additional chutney. However, two things did not make me like the dish:- 
 i) The presentation. I did not personally like vadas being served in a small plate which inturn was in a big plate. 
 ii) The vada were not crunchy at all. It seemed like it was made from before and just served for the sake. 

2) Rose Soda ( 25 bucks inc. taxes) - It was pretty cheap. The soda was presented to me in a much better way. The rose soda had pinch of rose water mixed to enhance the taste. However, little crushed ice on top would have been an add on. 
=======================================================
Summary:- 

1) Ambience 3.5/5
2) Food quality 3.5/5
3) Food quantity 3.5/5
4) VFM 4/5
5) Taste 3.5/5 
=======================================================
Conclusion:

A nice place to visit when you are low on pocket and when you want to eat light. :) 
Please see the attached pictures below. Thank you. :)

Ralli's in Golpark was our favorite haunt in Uni for a long, cold drink and some chaats. Yesterday, we were roaming around Gariahat when suddenly I had the brilliant plan of going to Ralli's and tasting their Thandai and some pao bhaji. It was around 6 pm, and when we entered, we saw that "special" Kesariya Thandai was being sold for 70/- a glass and we ordered two glasses, along with a rose soda (25/-) for me, a special kulfi (50/-) for K, pao bhaji and Chola Batura. 

The kulfi came in first... I thought the size was a bit too small, but K was not complaining. There was a generous portion of falooda on it, which she liked and I didn't. The rose soda was not too fizzy, but I did not mind it. However, the Pao Bhaji (75/-) and Chola Batura (75/-) were both very tasty and served piping hot. Even K decided that the pao bhaji was very good! However by the end of our meal, our glasses of thandai came in, and we loved them so much we downed every drop. K ordered a second glass. 

As far as I remember, our bill was slightly over 400/- for all this.

situated next to aminia golpark,we opted this joint for spending an hour of waiting time for getting in their next door.Needless to say, we didnt only wait,we ate :-)
the ground floor provides minimal seating with few chairs outside the shop,upstairs being air conditioned provides the basic dining amenities i.e. the tables of four and six, the low ceiling height and the lack of space makes it bit cramped.
Our orders- idly ,paper masala dhosa , and kulfi arrived soon.the manager and the staff were very courteous. the south indian items, the idly and dosa with the sambar chutney was well-made,nothing extra ordinary came up.prices were rather a bit high. the must have in ralli's is their kulfi. i didnot really expect it to be THAT good ,the one i used to have from their esplanade outlet, but this one was mindblowing! the faluda topped with rose syrup was just what i look for whenever i opt kulfi. trust me, it should not be missed! 
3 out of 5 just for their kulfi (y)

Ralli‚Äôs would leave one with mixed feelings about the price. While the cold coffee is surprisingly cheap, the rava dosa-s are not. The food served is moderately well cooked. The prices of most of the items are pocket friendly; however, they have recently increased their rates for every food item. 

One can always go grab their moderate tasting and moderately priced dosas and idlys. However, most of the items of the chat section (which obviously are the ones which are cheaper than others) would always be unavailable. 

The lassi-s and kulfi-s are tasty but one must always avoid the floats served here. The entire float would always taste like protein syrup and it would take a person to be from Mars to gulp in the entire terrible float. However, the ambience is friendly and this place could be visited quite often, keeping in mind, to order anything but the float!

If you want to sit and relax with your friend or somebody special for long hours with a glass of refreshing drink in a cozy little restaurant or cafe, then nothing can be better than the Ralli's at Golpark. Situated at 56 Ballygunge Gardens, Kolkata, Ralli's is one of my favorite destinations to hang out with friends. I have been here a number of times but recently, I was there in the last week on Sunday evening. The interior space is very limited with only four dining tables on the 1st floor and only seating arrangement in the ground floor. 

We were five all total and so we moved upstairs to occupy the table for six. The waiter knows us as we are frequent visitors. He offered us the menu chart. As it was Sunday evening, there was a heavy rush at this restaurant. So, after we placed our order, it took some time to serve our orders and hence we got enough time for our friendly chit-chats. Firstly we ordered five types of refreshing syrups; Sweet Lime Syrup, Rose Syrup, Badam Syrup, Mango Syrup and Blue Lagoon Syrup. My choice was Badam Syrup and it is always very tasty and refreshing. I mostly prefer this one but often I opt for Sweet Lime Syrup also. I don't prefer the other choices in syrup but when the same syrups come in Shakes, the taste becomes more lip smacking. These were served almost instantly but the later orders took some time to appear in our table. Apart from syrups, we ordered Singara Chat, Plain Kachori Chat, Mixed Chat, Plain Dosa and Masala Dosa. Mixed Chat was my preference but we all shared each other's choices. As always, Ralli's never disappoints me because of its simplicity and mouth watering preparations. So, if you are planning to hang out with friends, don't miss the name, Ralli's.

Its located in a prime area and the food mainly south indian and a few north indian dishes is great.. During holi time they serve "bhaang", and the price is well fitted within the college students pockets.. Its a neat and clean place but the place is short in height, a big problem for 6 footers! Anyways its good value for money..
