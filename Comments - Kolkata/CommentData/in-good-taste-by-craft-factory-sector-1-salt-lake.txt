Got to know about craft factory from zomato and how people claimed it to be the best customised cake providers,so I thought maybe i should give them a try,well I must say I wasnt disappointed as they delivered on the right time and the final product was unparalleled in both looks and quality and lets not forget the taste,it was awesome and my special one liked it alot,it was a black forest cake with a 3d design panda on the top.

Thanks to aditi,she is awesome and she gave the cake a nice finish and got the job done wonderfully.

I would prefer craft factory everytime I decide to gift someone  a cake in the future.

A lifesaver... Wanted a cake for a friend's bachelorette... I really had no idea custom cakes of this quality are available around... And with the ease of arranging it while in Delhi... I found this page on Zomato I got talking with Ms Aditi and she took over the whole thing with finesse and so much enthusiasm and the end result left us completely awestruck... Converted a rough idea into a a beautiful cake... And may I say your cake was way better looking than the reference photo I got online of a foreign bakery's cake... The edible George Clooney and Gerard Butler was mind blowing... And the cake itself was super delicious... Kudos and best wishes... You made a group of nostalgic girls very very happy...

Thank you IN GOOD TASTE for baking and delivering our 40th wedding anniversary cake 4 hours in advance on a completely water logged Kolkata morning in such immense downpour! Our carrot/cinnamon/walnut cake with the sour cream icing was such a great hit among 10 friends & family that even 2kg we had ordered was over in a matter of minutes!! Aditi professional as always..thank you so much for the love and hard work you put in even on the icing and piping of a cake as simple as ours ! IN GOOD TASTE has never let us down in the last 3 years <3

Not really happy with quality of the work as well as design concept...it was also a big pinch over the pocket whereas the quality was totally compromised. ..i am no where satisfied with the quality of cakes delivered to me..wouldn't be recommended anyways from me..since each cakes determines a very specific time and love for anyone..but couldnt made sense to me ...getting the cake from her...make sure you care for quality when you are paying almost 2 times more than the normal market price..cheers..will not use...

It was my dad's 60th birthday and came across Craft factory on zomato. From the first phone call till the delivery of the cake,  Aditi was very cooperative. She gives immense attention to the client's requirements and customizes accordingly. Loved the finesse of the decoration and the taste was perfect. Highly recommended.

Now this is a place which served as a life saver for me and my bestie...the woman, Aditi is a very helpful person.
She agreed to making a customised cake within 6 hours for my birthday....and delivered it at my place personally. The cake was marvellous, not just to look at but also to taste.
For my bestie's birthday, i had ordered a red velvet cake. It was within our final exams and she literally took my headache away and delivered it in time. The cakes are always fresh and the cost is quite manageable compared to some other similar establishments.
Kudos for the good work.

Late one november evening,sitting far away from home in mumbai,I was almost in tears.Had my sister's bday the next day and none of the big bakeries were willing to custom make a cake.Should have though of it earlier,I know,but when you have broken your foot not even a week back and cancelled your plans of going home for a surprise visit,these things do tend to get pushed to the last minute.  
I found out about the craft factory through a facebook like by a school friend.Gave it a last shot and called them up.Aditi,who owns the place,was such a godsend,she not only agreed to customise the cake,she also delivered it the next day and took an online payment.Everyone at home was delighted with how cute the cake was.I proceeded to order another cake in the next ten days for my mum and another boozy one on xmas.
All the cakes were so rich and absolutely delicious.We even got a complimentary box of chocolates with my mum's cake.Definitely one of my favourite bakeries and am ordering from here for sure:) fabulous work!

First, let me thank you Aditi, you have truely been helpful. 

I wanted to order a Birthday cake for my Fiancee and had no idea which cake would be best from what "In Good Taste" offers. Aditi was a great guide. She took an order for cutomised cake in short notice for same day delivery. With due respect had it been other more "professional confectionaries" they plainful would have refused. 

She helped me with flavours I should go for keeping my budget in mind (I already mentioned her). With all her patience and sweetness she suggested Gourmet flavours I can take in 2D (as I needed one pound cake) and we finalized Chocolate mint flavoured cake with Choco chips. Best part of all was I kept discussing my ideas and she came out with all of them really well. Each element was perfect, the cake looked perfect, tasted perfect.  Also Aditi personally dropped the cake at my door in 3-4 hours from the time of order. 

I really appreciate her effort and would recommend this bakery to my mates and relatives. You are the best Aditi. Thanks, thank you soo much for making our evening such great...

When almost every place turned us down for an eggless cake last minute they not only agreed to do it for us. But they gave us one of the best Black Forest cakes ever! 

It was freshly prepared from the scratch and delivered to within two hours of our order which was commendable. The cake was just perfect.

It is a pleasure to see craft factory here..awesome designer cake s and awesome taste..u just have to tell Aditi what kind of design u want and there she will make it with perfection.i had ordered a bday cake for my husband and since he is crazy abt cameras just mentioned abt his fav brand for cameras..so the research was done by craft factory and got a perfect cake which seemed like a real camera..and my husband actually felt bad while cutting the cake coz it looked so perfect. .. the chocolates made by craft factory is also good..
great going..keep baking just beautiful cakes and let us sit back and enjoy the taste..

Exemplary cake shop! If you are looking for ideas for wedding, birthdays, anniversary, or any other celebrations/reasons and you have cake in mind – This is “The” Place!!. Creativity is the unlimited and quality is always the 1st Priority. 

The cakes here are so yummy! They're light and fluffy when you eat them but still full of flavour. The walnut sponge cakes are my usual because the amounts of walnuts they use add just enough moisture to the sponge. The rich layered chocolate is something which any chocolate lover would flip for ! I love them as they are pure chocolate. 

The butter sticks and the one which people I think generally miss as most of the people walk in here with “Cake” in mind….one must try and order them the shelf life is awesome – I guess the credit goes to the “purity” of ingredients used.  

They also have variety of small cupcakes to order a great “on-the-go” comes with cream as per your requirement. I love the ones with choco chips !! 

I saw some of the party orders with state of art finesse. The best part was every part of the cake was edible  

The prices are quite reasonable for the quality served…….. 

“In good taste” – Indeed !!

Had a taste at a friends Birthday. It was good enough for me to scout her out. My daughter ordered for her mother. Umpteen designs. Delivered next day. Result ?

Most Deliciously, Scrumptiously, Yummily, Lickably, Awesomely, Wonderful Cake.

Not the gooey stuff you get in most "cake" shops. Will never order from the Local cake shops any more. With the quantuty and quality, the cost is also very reasonable.

Your Permenant client.

Thank You.

Really glad that In Good Taste is finally up there on Zomato. This is the best cake shop in Kolkata.

It was a very close friend's birthday and book launch ceremony. We have ordered the Cake (Replica of the book) from Good Taste by Craft Factory. When we saw the cake at first glance no one able to recognize that it’s a cake. It was awesome. I my office everybody was appreciated the work. Cost the cake was also very nominal compared to other conventional cake shops in Kolkata.

It was my cousin’s (lives in London) wedding ceremony. My brother asked me for a good cake shop in Kolkata. I have blindly referred Good Taste by Craft Factory. Everybody including foreign guest liked the cake so much. Everybody was so delighted.

Keep up the good work.

So finally, it's on zomato. :) before you read further...just a little information.... it is THE BEST CAKE SHOP in Kolkata...from texture to taste....you get it all here.
It just has one drawback...i.e. Its so good, you tend to get addicted to it. You will get customized cakes, muffins, cup cakes...from the warm customer service to excellent final product, in good taste is a master of all these tactics.
I hope they open up more branches.
This was the cake for my birthday... It was delivered to my house...and the chocolate cubes too.
Its a must try for all you people with a sweet tooth like mine. :)

full marks for creativity, taste and customer satisfaction. aditi has made someone very special to me very happy. i was rueing the fact that my sick aunt could not join my daughter's birthday. so we decided to have an impromptu party at her place in barrackpore. while writing a review for rubi's grill i came across IGT. it was good news for people like us who like to experiment and think out of the box. now my aunt, incidently and surprisingly, is not a chocolate lover. i asked aditi if she could do something in the matter. aditi made a wonderful butter cream and orange cake and packed it to ensure safe transport. this creator is so caring of her babies that she smsed me asking to refrigerate the cake the moment i reach my destination, given the oven like weather. what's noteworthy, is that my aunt actually had a second helping of the cake. kudos to you aditi. looking forward to your creation for the 20th. thanks a lot dear. hope you make many many more people happy like you did my aunt.

My son wished for an Iron man cake on his 4th birthday and how could I not fulfill his little dream? 
What I thought might be a trivial case of hopping into a cake shop to get a tailor made cake turned out to be a real challenge. The conventional cake shops declined and the specialised ones could not quite understand what I wanted. Some of them suggested inserting a plastic iron man toy on top of a cake(duh!).
Finally, I phoned up Aditi(In Good Taste) to see if an iron man cake could be custom made. Aditi quickly turned my idea into visuals so that I had different options to choose from. What I finally decided for the birthday cake was a mish mash of many ideas and was very nervous about the final outcome.
When the cake arrived at the birthday venue, I got an instant approval from my son for he  had the widest smile on his face. The  best part was the rich chocolate truffle cake inside which was luxuriously moist and  heavenly silky and just vanished in few minutes. How I wish I had ordered double the size.

Keep up the good work and  I am so glad I discovered you. My son is now looking forward to his next birthday and is making note of his super heroes!

This place is synonymous to joy. The taste, the aesthetic sense with which the cake is designed and the whole concept of customized cake is just out of the world experience. This is a first of a kind experience that I have had in this city.  If you are looking forward to surprise your taste buds it is this place. "Betcha can't eat just one"

Really glad that In Good Taste is finally up there on Zomato. This is one bakehouse that can easily give the kingpin confectioners in Kolkata a run for their money. Frankly speaking, Nuttin-better and Better than Sex are the two cupcakes you may try out when you have a craving for heaven. The fresh, moist and warm cupcakes seduce your sense of taste. Really looking forward to try out their other flavors.

What's more? The cupcakes are actually cheaper than the contemporary bakehouses. So not just you, even your wallet goes home happy.

Oh, and if you're looking for a cake of your own design, be it Dusty the Crophopper or a cute pair of twin babies, IGT is the only place in Kolkata you can call.
