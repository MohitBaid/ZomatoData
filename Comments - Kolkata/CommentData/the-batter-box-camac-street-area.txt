The cake was so beautiful that we didn't feel like cutting it. Need I say more? The cake was extremely moist and dense. Every tiny detail was given the utmost attention and I got exactly what I had asked for. The best place to get cakes from. Hands down.

Hello Everyone.. 

I ordered a three tier cake today from Batter Box... 

Not only the cake looked good, Tasted amazing but even more than that what took me by surprise was with the effort, love, care 

Rachita Kothari she brought the cake to salt Lake all the way from south Kolkata.. 

This shows immense love towards her job. 

I wish you luck and success... I will keep ordering and referring you.. 

And don't worry you will get the next big order I was talking about..

It was an absolute delight, to choose The Batter Box. The cake was simply heaven on earth. Not only did she suggest the best options for the cake, but also added everything we wanted in the most amazing way possible. I would recommend all my acquaintances without any second thoughts, CHOOSE 'THE BATTER BOX' any day. Thank you so much.
