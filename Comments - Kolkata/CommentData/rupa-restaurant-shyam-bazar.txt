Situated on Shyambazar patch matha more.This is the best place to try kosha mangsho (meat), be it the mutton or chicken.it is the best.The place is small with hardly any decoration for ambience.so 1 out of 5.service is a normal one 2 out of 5. But the Food is a 5 out 5.

Located near the Shyambazar five point crossing, this little eatery serves delicious kosha mangsho. The food quality is amazing but it will be a good option to get the food packed if you are finicky because the place doesn't have a great ambiance, it's more of a roadside eatery.

Paid Rs 180 for Mutton Keema , brought it home to enjoy the Sunday dinner. It turned out to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had. I love Rupa but if this is what they do for business , I'm sorry as I've lot other options next time.
There was no Mutton at all, just the smell. The mutton was overcooked and there was a burnt smell all over nd the worst part is when I got a female hair from the food. I almost puked. Sorry but this is just a waste of money. 
I gave rating 2, the reason being food was delivered fast and money was taken fast.

This small eatery situated at Shyam Bazar came as a pleasant surprise to me. The kosha mangsho tasted yummy. It is very similar to the kosha mangsho available at another famous eatery located nearby. The taste, Quality is excellent and the taste kind of lingers in your mouth. Do not expect to sit and eat if you are finicky. Best option would be to get the mangsho packed and eat at home.

While golbari has lost its charm and the quality of food completely. This outlet really does justice with the kasha mutton. Beautifully made. No one goes for ambience or service there but full marks for the food.

Small eatery near to Shyambazar five point crossing.

Interior and ambience: Little bit shabby. Sitting arrangement is congested, no air conditioning. Ambience is like a road side hotel.

Food: During day time they serve typical Bengali lunch including plain rice, average quality dal, few options for bhajas, decent quality fish and Mutton and some vegetarian dishes like sukto et al.
For Dinner, they serve hand made ruti, chicken and Mutton kosha. MUTTON KOSHA deserves special mention. At first sight the black colour gravy is non appealing but once you start eating you will love the taste and aroma. Though it's spicy and bit oily, it usually doesn't give much trouble to  stomach.

Staffs: Previously there were two experienced and friendly staffs but on my recent visit four days back, I found some teenagers as staff who are bit confused and not efficient. I do not like the attitude of the manager/ owner here.

Located near the Shyambazar 5 point crossing this restaurant brings back the old flavours of Kolkata . Have been visiting this place since the days when Kolkata was Calcutta . .There is nothing to talk about the decor of this place but the ambience , smell of this place is nostalgic. I come back here again & again for my favourite Mutton Kasha . The dish is oily & rich in spices &  tastes amazing . Not a dish for the so called diet loving , oil free health freaks . But if you love Mutton Kasha then you will love their preparation . I mainly prefer to pack my food to enjoy back at home . But if you are going for the takeaway option then it is better to carry your own container as their packaging is still primitive .

Golbari was closed when we visited to have the famous mutton kasha, so we came to this place. 
You cannot expect a clean and hygienic place, warning you at the onset. But the food will be finger licking good. We had haath roti, kasha mangsho and alongside they give a  chutney which is mind blowing. No clue about the other items they have.

A decent place with a few good dishes, namely the mutton kasha and the egg tarka-rumali roti combo. One thing I do like about the place is that the staff here welcome everyone very generously and give out a warm feeling

Their mutton kasha is really good. Some say even better than Golbari. Better or not, I'm not that into mutton but theirs I've tasted once or twice on casual whims. One should opt for Rupa chiefly for their mutton.

Location is also very good.

Situated opposite to the famous Golbari, it is exactly on the first left corner of the road that head towards Khanna Cinema. If you find it difficult to locate it, just ask around.
The place might look a little shabby and old but the food is not. Mutton Kosha costs around 160 and will ignite your taste buds beyond all doubts. Roti and Mutton Kosha here is way more pleasant than what you get at Golbari.
Tip: Always ask for the extra gravy of the Kosha. It energises people. Always. :)

Went there in the evening. The restaurant was almost empty, made me wondering what I am going to experience in quality of food. Ordered for mutton kasa, after reading the reviews on zomato and paratha, but came to know that they don't serve paratha, so had to take roti. The mutton was good. Though, in my opinion, not at par with golbari, but not far below. Ambience as bad as golbari, or may be little worse. But for mutton kasa only am giving this rating.

I HAVE HAD THEIR MUTTON KASHA AND MUTTON LIVER A FEW TIMES.
MUTTON KASHA IS JUST GREAT AND AS IT SHOULD BE.
MUTTON LIVER IS EXCELLANT,THOUGH LIVER PIECES ARE BIG I WOULD RATHER PREFER MEDIUM OR SMALL PIECES.
EVERYTIME I HAVE PARCELED THE FOOD SO I AM UNAWARE OF THE SERVICES IF I DINE THEIR.

Rupa, located near Shyambazar 5 point crossing, serves quality Bengali lunch and few other items like Biryani, Kosha Mangsho etc. The Kosha Mangsho here, in my opinion, is better than its famous neighbour Golbari. But what I love this place for is the Bengali lunch they serve.

During lunch hours (except for weekends) expect to be greeted by a queue as this place is extremely popular due to its pocket-friendly and delicious menu. Its a small place, so during lunch you are expected to order fast, eat and leave. Post lunch however the place remains mostly empty, so you can go slow. Service is prompt and friendly.

My personal favourites here are the Shukto, Jhuri alu bhaja and Murighonto. Though everything else I tried here were also good.

A must try place if you are around and want to have a good Bengali lunch.

Thanks to my man for taking me at this place for that plate of mutton kosha and roti. Ufff. They were really tasty, even more than famous Golbari. This is a small place just beside Rahmania and opposite right of Golbari. The cost is real cheap and the serving boys are real cute. They are always on their toes to give you us the best possible services. This is an AGAIN AND AGAIN visitable place for me. I forgot to take pictures, will do once i go there again. My 5 star on basis of the service, behavior, taste, quality of the food. Dont miss this place if you are here.

I usually avoid this place. It is a tiny,dingy eatery with an equally tiny menu - mostly rotis,and some generic items like mutton kasha,tarka etc.
The rotis are thick,and the mutton kasha and liver fry taste and look identical...almost black gravy with an excess of ginger.
Not really impressive.

AWESOME Tasty FOOD SERVED BY THEIR NICE BEHAVIOR STAFF. BUT MY friends its a NON.A.C restaurant. Go for the taste guys.

This is definitely the place that will go in my good books and for the right reason. Unlike   golbari the mutton kasa here is delicious and those rotis compliment them completely. Anybody who wants to try that dish should not go by the hype of other places and head directly towards this joint. At least now I know why mutton kasa is popular in these parts. Thank you for the lovely meal.

Rupa.......a moderately known place at Shyambazar Crossing.....dishes out its specialty.....Kosha Mangsho and Roti. I am a regular visitor since my childhood days....and during those days, to me, a good restaurant started and ended with the name of "Rupa". The dark toned Kosha Mangsho served with softest of Roti and tasty Tamarind sauce will smack your taste buds. But sorry to say that, my favorite restaurant of my childhood time.....can't continue to pull enough customers for various reasons like deteriorating quantity and quality of food, poor hygienic condition with worst service.....if I put aside pressure of competition from Golbari situated around the corner. Price is moderate going alongside of its quality. I would say, have a taste only for its dark toned Kosha Mangsho.
