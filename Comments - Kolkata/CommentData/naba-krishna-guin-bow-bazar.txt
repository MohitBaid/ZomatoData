Had their khirer chop which were good. Owned by a friend of dad's, their sweets are nice and sweetly satisfying. Their big-sized 'bonde' are also very tasty.

Golap Sandesh , Chocolate Sandesh , Pesta Sandesh and Sankh Sandesh are the items I tasted here and yes all were good no doubt about it , but needs to keep the place clean.

Went for pandal hopping around Central Kolkata on this maha-saptami and what did I discover? This excellent place for a nice and lite breakfast. Naba Krishna Guin is one of the several traditional sweet shops of the area. Don't ask me the location as I have poor knowledge of Central and North Kolkata, all I can say is it's located just beside Bhim Chandra Nag sweet shop.

The place serves excellent luchi with dal in the morning which we had for breakfast. We also had their special bonde as they had run out of mihidana that day. It very tasty and non sticky unlike other bondes I have tasted.

Pricing was cheap, just â‚¹5 per those mini luchis and dal was complementary. Bonde was priced as per weight.

The boro bonde , the victoria sandesh ,the butterscotch sandesh all r just yum yums . One of the oldest shops in kolkata , very neat and tidy ,staff behaviour is an average , on several occassions I have seen an empty counter with no staff and customers frantically searching for them .. but the heavenly taste of their sweets are sure to bring the sweet smile to your face..no place to seat yourself , just takeaway and enjoy..

You cannot miss the Boro Bonde of this traditional shop. The very tasty Ghee Poha during holi & Khaja on bhai phonta are bonus for every sweet lover. The best thing is that you can get these two sweets even 10 days post their respective occasion. It has turned out to be a brand for its unique taste.
