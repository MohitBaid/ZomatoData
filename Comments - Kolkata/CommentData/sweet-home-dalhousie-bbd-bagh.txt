After a long and agony filled day at high court, i was drained of all bodily fluids and desperately needed to replenish. Straight headed to the this place and ordered a chocolate shake, and a summer cooler. The chocolate shake was heavenly and so was the summer cooler.

Everyone knows this place opposite the high Court fire is expensive sweets....  They have stated a veg place where they see kachoris and thalis.  The food is tasty and hygienic which is a great thing in the high Court area

The major problem they have is that you yourself have to carry the food upstairs. They don't even serve juice upstairs which is a drawback of this place.
