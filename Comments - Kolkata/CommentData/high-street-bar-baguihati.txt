The best thing is the staffs of this restaurant are very co-operative, we visited this place during Durga Puja this year and we are highly satisfied. Foods and drinks cost are appropriate. Also, the ambience is very good. Desserts not taken, hence not included in ratings.

Had been crossing this place quite often so one final day decided to check it out. Came with a guest who had a late night flight to catch. This place is located close to Big Bazar in Baguihati on the first of Celesta Hotel. Place was pretty much empty even on a Friday night. After getting seated we ordered a couple of beers and starters like chicken and paneer tikka. Drinks came quickly but starters took more than 30 mins to come. Never mind if the place is more than 50% vacant even on a Friday night then you would expect it to be understaffed. Food quality was quite average nothing worth mentioning. We thought of having main course but skipped - just had another beer, chilli pepper chicken and decided to leave. Not very expensive, average food, poor service and decent ambience.

Never noticed hotel celesta until recently. Thought of giving it a booze try. It's located on the 1 St floor of the building and u can take the twirly staircase to reach the bar.
Ambience is more of a fine dine restaurant rather than a bar, with extremely.good quality food.
Price is standard ,a signature large would cost u around 300inr .
We had chilli fish that costs around 300 inr and a veg chowmein with a chicken side dish would pocket pinch u around 250 to 300 inr.
They have a separate smoking room and very polite staff. Overall a good place to booze.

Had an office party hence couldn't interact much ..

Well ambience is good. 
I have a question to ask "unlimited hour is applicable for all the 7days??" 
Can I have a clarity on that ??

First of all the drinks menu they have, the pricing is quite different from that of the menu in zomato..A heneiken is Rs195 in zomato and in the actual bar menu it was Rs250,so you can see the difference and after bringing this issue to the supervisor/manager over there they did not do anythning about it.
For this I would blame zomato and the hotel itself.
Secondly, the service was pathetic, we actually needed to shout out for anything required as there were no focus on the guests and the bar was quite empty even.
Pretty sad with experience.

Firstly though they said that they have 1:1 offer on domestic alcohol and 2:1 on imported ones, but the fact is the statement is totally bluff.

They were providing 2:1 offer only that too on selected brand (Antiquity, Black & White, KF Beer).

Food was also not good, and rates are sky High.

In same area you will find better places with much better food and better pricing.

Utterly disappointed. PLEASE DONT BE THERE.

The restaurant is totally scrap. Only the look is somewhat better, but staffs are untrained. Food is not so good. They have given me some tandoori roti, which I can't tear down. Even after complaining about the same, they don't change the same. So I have left the food without any option.

I dined and wined this thursday with my freind at this place. Let me try to give a detail overview.

Ambience: Ambience is so so.. not that great but nicely and neatly set up. We sat on a small table for 2 which could barely accomodate platters, glasses and spoons.

Food: quality and variety was good. We had ordered roasted chicken in barbeque sauce which was good but not great. Fish finger and french fries served was average and lesser in quantity than other joints of simmilar category.

Service: Service stood out to be the only great thing we witnessed. Waiters were cordial and prompt.

Price: too high for the overall offerings.

Crowd: Not a place for family as we found our fellow guests usinv slangs etc over drinks.

Overall an oveehyped and overpriced placed. Same kind of a food and drinks with better ambience at a better price are available plenty in Rajarhat area.

I ordered a Greek salad which didn't come with any breads, which was a bummer. The taste was okay, like there was no Olive oil, and tons of lemon juice.

And oh! They give you a free cocktail for a review

High Street Bar is the boozing zone of the beautiful looking Hotel Celesta. As much as it looks beautiful it is not at all gives you the desired output. Over priced yet not the best of the quality they serve. Not the impressive indeed.

I have been there once and probably that'd be it. In my rating 2.0 is for the ambience and 0.5 for the rest of it. They show something and charge something else. For example i was told that i would get 10% off the foodbill if I liked them on facebook. So i did it but when the bill came there was no 10% off. On enquiring they said the discount is valid on the next bill.  I had a very bad experience and i would definitely not suggest this place to anyone.

Great Place to chill !!!!!.
The Happy Days concept is killing. 6 person with starters, dinner and lots of alcohol, we just paid 7000 !!!!!.
Ask Shanu to create the magic cocktails, Palash to cook up a surprise palate of delicious starters. Surojit is the guy to talk to if you want some real advice on what to eat and Daniel is the guy who can help you with everything !!!! Ambience is top notch (sorry could not upload snaps as my phone has conked)
I rated 4.5 just because of the lack of variety in menu. However, fret not, they are coming up with a new and vibrant Menu for all kinds of food lovers.
Visit the place, drink and eat the fullest and you will like it !!!!!

Exquisite interiors, ambient atmosphere, cordial hospitality, good food. A great selection of whisky. Service could be a bit quicker. Also could have a larger collection of wine, keeping in mind the growing population of wine drinkers. All in all a great place to be in, and given the fact that it is situated on vip road(a cluster of dance bars), it provides respite to family and classy mass.

Let's cut the gibberish and get to the point

Ambience - 10/10
Prices - 10/10
Brands - 10/10
Service - 10/10
Food - 10/10

That makes drinking at High Street 10/10. So go get drunk
