Radhuni is Specialist in preparing Katla Fish Curry that has an essence of home-made fish curry. Bookmarking it for home-delivery orders next time. üëåüëå‚úå

2nd Review:- ordered Kodaishutir Kochuri and luchi-Aloo dum via Zomato for evening snacks. Both the dishes were trademark of Radhuni as they presented the dishes in their own innovative way. Moreover it was healthy and not at all rich and that too pocket friendly. Best food joint near my home providing healthy & delicious food . Kudos! Keep it up. üëåüëåüëçüëç

3rd Review:- Tried Veg and Egg Fried Rice alongwith Chicken Kosha for lunch via Zomato . Both the fried rice dishes were yummy . Special credit to Radhuni for preparing veg fried rice with seasonal veggies and that 2 less oily. But chicken kosha needs to be taken care of as the curry was bit oily and rich.

***n.b:---And one small request to Radhuni:- please reintroduce "Kodaishutir Kochuri " in your food menu as It is one of yr bestseller and one of my fav , don't know why it is missing from your food menu card.

One lazy afternoon pushed us to order lunch from this new place, reasonable prices and huge options lured us to order from here. We ordered two non-vegetarian thalis one with fish and one with chicken. And one fish finger. 
Talking about the thali, it had rice, moong daal, aalu poshto, aalu vaja and chicken curry, plastic chutney and papad. It came out totally perfect for me in 150/-. Rice was perfect for one person in quantity. Daal was totally homely like how my mother makes everyday. Aalu vaja was crispy and good to munch on. Aalu poshto was the best of all , full of chilli and filled with Bengali flavours. Chicken was again great, quantity was a little less however that‚Äôs totally understandable. Chutney and papad were good too. I didn‚Äôt try the fish so cannot comment on it. One set back was the fish finger, it was very disappointing. It was full of fish but totally bland like it was infused with no flavour at all. I‚Äôm still very impressed with the food. Will try their other items too.

Pathetic service. Came 2 hours later with worst and cold food. While waiting for 2 hours, zomato support continuously asked me to wait and wait and wait. AND MIND IT, NEVER EVER ORDER FROM ZOMATO, THEIR SERVICE IS WORST OR ATLEAST FROM THIS RESTAURANT.

The food quality was awesome but the quantity was less. If you can increase your quantity a bit more, it will be great. Looking forward to dine again.

Food was good, I ordered Basanti Pulao, Chanar Kofta and Chicken Sandwich. Pulao's quantity was more than enough for a single person, taste was descent, rice need a little more cooking. Chanar Kofta was four small Kofta balls, portion was small, but quality & quantity justifies the price tag. Now comes the Chicken Sandwich, I had to microwave it, since I ate it little later, and the taste was great, two triangular non grilled brown bread, stuffed with freshly cooked chicken with a seductive gravy, and all for just Rs.25/-. Overall value for money and good taste. What more, they didn't charged me for the delivery service.

I loved the food i ordered ,specially fish kachori and dhokar dalna was amazing , it has a taste of homemade food. Not so rich or spicy. And the quantity of thali is really good.

Very bad service and the food also not good. The moong dal was tasteless.  And the prawn chop was not fully fried. Order delivery took more than 1 hour.

Radhuni is a home delivery service located in Dumdum. Their ordering and delivery service are prompt & efficient. The thali we ordered had portions large enough for two people to share. The quality of the rice was good, the dal (kalai or biuli) was fine, the aloo bhaja was very crispy and the fish size big (in the thali). The most disappointing item was the fish finger which hardly had any fish in it!. Also the chicken curry provided in the thali was very bland. They need to work hard on the taste of their food items.

Ok so we all spend most of the time outside our home nowadays and eat outside a lot. And the thought of having food which can combine hygine of home but at the same time can offer taste of a restaurant comes to all of our mind. This is exactly where Radhuni scores high. Plus it offers wide variety. Be it chinese/snacks or full course meal in the form of thali. All of these you get without burning a hole in your pocket. Having tasted chowmein earlier from my colleague I came to know about this hidden gem and thought of ordering chicken sandwich. The taste was simply out of the world. There was so much chicken in the sandwich that it was really unexpected that too only for a price of 25. I don't think any where I can get this amazing sandwich at such affordable price. I will be again ordering and trying other items and recommend this to my friends as well.

Its seems that "Rahuni" has been started with a fresh and innovative concept. There is a purely Home Made food available. While I ordered for "Chicken Chowmin", after having the same, I was completely satisfied and got a fresh flavour of Home, hence if you guys like me, who used to miss some home dishes along with its Delicacy, surely go for these without having any hesitation in mind.
