Visited this place for lunch a few days ago. A small joint in the lanes of deshapriya park. This place is seriously parantha goals on a whole new level. They serve you a large variety of paranthas you have never heard of. And they taste absolutely delicious. The chicken cheese parantha and badam kesari rabdi lassi is a must have. And if you have a combo of these two for lunch you'll be feeling full until dinner.
And they serve hot fresh paranthas with yoghurt and an onion achaar. The cheese and chicken parantha has a balanced amount of the two not making it too cheesy which doesn't taste good. The keema chawal is also a must have which is a combination of spices which will leave your eyes watery.

This is one amazing place to be. One of my regular visits. 

The cheese chicken paratha is an absolute winner. Apart from that the garlic chicken one is really good. The people there are very courteous.

Appetizers and desserts are nice.

To add on to that, the interior gives you an amazing north Indian charm as well as the Calcutta feel together.

This small, piquant, inexpensive eatery deserves to be better known. The Parathas are hefty and succulent, both. The Ghee Mutton Paratha was high on both calorie and taste. The accompanying Pineapple Lassi made them a full meal together. Also tasted the Nawabi Chicken Paratha, which was bit dry for my palate but was quite good othewise. I couldn't proceed to the sweet varieties because I had no room to do so. Another visit is due soon. Wish this place all the luck for closing an important gap on the Calcutta food scene.

A 'tiny' copy of the Delhi spot by the bon-appetit group so surely it was not meant to disappoint. Infact it exceeded expectations. We ordered 'cheese chicken Parantha' and 'swarg ka dwar'. The Parantha was filled with chicken and cheese along with pickle and curd. The dessert took all the points and quite heavenly indeed. The staff was good and the Punjabi style decor was tidy and innovative. Don't miss the quotes on the walls.. Overall a must visit spot.

Went there during the rush hours of puja. It is located in the lanes nearing to the Bullygunje Cultural Puja which is eventually given wrong in zomato .Its very small in size so we had to wait for some time as we were huge in number :p . But the staffs coordinate with us in every possible ways.The ambiance was okay to my liking, nothing that special about it.Coming to the foods, we had ordered different types of parantha along with chicken keema ,rice bowls and some types of lassis.I personally had green apple lassi, which was amazing <3¬†
We had anchari chicken paratha, wai wai parantha, chicken cheese parantha and one veg parantha.Although the paranthas were very nice but they served the chicken keema after so much delay that we had almost finished our parathas tilll then. It tasted good though. But the rice bowls were not at all good. It almost had no taste in it.¬†So overall its a mixed kind of experience. Hope to visit here again and have some other types of paranthas.

First things first, upon entering we tried suggesting in a very subtle tone that the location marked in zomato, as per the map i.e. was wrong and we had a hard time finding our way to the place. Much to our surprise, we were met with complete denial by a serving staff and were told that, we got lost because google maps is problematic so we've used the map on Zomato instead. When we tried explaining to him that, Zomato uses Google maps api and it has no map of it's own, we were still being met with denial and resistance to the suggestion.

Ohh, well. Looking past this, we ordered a chicken cheese paratha, a cheese mushroom paratha and badam rabri lassi. While waiting food to arrive, the decor of this place caught our eyes. It's a fairly small place with lovely indian decor, has that North-western Indian vibe to it. We reieved our and started munching down on our parathas. Now, let me be frank, the stuffing inside the parathas were quite heavy so they actually shifted to one side. So, now my paratha had all the stuffing in the world on one side and barely any on another. That is something I'll like them to improve upon. That said, the paratha was pretty good, though and heavy as well, enough to fill a big guy like me up.
The badam rabri lassi was equally good. A perfect complimentary drink with the parantha. It was pretty thick as well.(That's what she said). 

Anyhow, I'd love to give place another go but only after they fix the stuffing issue. Management, kindly look into the matter, please. :)

Don't know which word is perfect for describing the taste of badam rabri lassi and classic avalanche!!!

Badam rabri lassi was not too much sweet nd cold(filled with crashed nuts nd ranbi).perfect taste which your taste buds want.highly recommended.

Classic avalanche is a dessert like sizzling ice cream.

Parathas are also mouth watering.special mention for chicken parathas.

Everything is just to the point...a small nice decorated restaurant with innovative ideas.
They charge only 5%extra tax and the food items are also affordable...
Love the restaurant ,want to visit more nd more.

A rising small joint in the city to get your fetish for Paranthas satisfied. This miniature joint serves you a wide varieties of Parantha starting from Cheese, Chicken, Mushroom, Garlic, Fenugreek and what not!
Truly serves upto the name, when compared to Delhi‚Äôs Paranthe Wali Galli.

Food:
‚Ä¢Chicken Cheese Parantha: Every inch of the Parantha was covered with lipsmacking cheese, accompanied by minced Chicken.

‚Ä¢ Cheese Mushroom Parantha: The best among the all and a must try. Mushroom and Cheese always serves as the best duo, be it Pizza or stuffed Parantha.

‚Ä¢Chilli Garlic Chicken: Too much of garlic ruined it, not at all recommended.

‚Ä¢ Red Velvet Chocolate Parantha: This was served as dessert, and won the heart of all. From presentation to taste what‚Äôs there not to praise! Imagine the taste of paratha stuffed with sponge cake and lots of jam, coated with red velvet cream, choco chips, and hot chocolate. (Highly recommended)

Drinks:
Badam Rabdi Lassi: The best lassi I‚Äôve had in town, and a must try.

Pocket pinch:
‚Çπ500 for two.

Highly Recommended.

Ordered a Thai Chilli paratha, cheese aloo paratha, panner paratha and choco avalanche. Cheese aloo being the cliche in parathas was obviously good. I liked the Thai Chilli paratha although the paneer paratha wasn't worth a second time order. Choco avalanche was worth the money, both in quality and quantity.

First of all the listing on the map for the place is wrong. Kept going round in circles but it was hard to find. Its next to the lane of the lake terrace CCD. If u see the jac olivol house, go till the end of the lane and take a right.
The name of the place is written in small fonts.
The place itself, is quite small, though its nicely decorated. It was moderately crowded.
Coming to the service, i understand they had loads of order for home deliveries but they did take time to present the menu and serve the food, etc.
Staff is not too friendly.
The food however is good. Tried the cheese chicken paratha and achari aloo paratha. Cheese chicken paratha was delicious. Achari aloo paratha was okay-ish in comparison to the cheese chicken paratha.

The location is near deshapriya park. A small food joint venture from bon appetite caf√©. The decor is quite impressive. They offer a variety of paranthe and a wide range of lassi. Not to miss the list that satisfies your sweet tooth. We ordered aloo cheese and achari chicken parantha, gandharaj and aam lassi. That aloo cheese parantha was oozing of cheese. Achari chicken was okay. Lassis were good, not sure about their experiments with the other lassis but sure those will be great too. The paranthas were accompanied by curd and pickle. Though they take gst but the service is not upto the mark. But they'll offer you some spiced candies along with the bill. Overall if you're missing the Paranthe wali gali from Delhi, you can visit this place for a little touch.

The location is not near the main road. 
The interior had a Punjabi ambience but the restaurant is very small.
I ordered gobhi classic and chicken cheese. There were few staffs. So the service was late. 
I hated the gobhi paratha so much that I could finish it.
The chicken cheese was not upto the mark but still eatable.
Overall I would never go to that restaurant again.

The place has a simple Desi ambience that sort of sets in the mood. As the name goes, the place serves you with an usual variety of paranthas. Apart from that, some delicious rice dishes are also available. After any meal one HAS TO go to the desserts that entails some Desi mithai and damn yumm lassis. And yes, not to mention, the service there is on point. Folks there are always on their toes to cater to needs. Besides these, the best part is... Wait for it.. THE BILL. The prices there are damn reasonable so you ought to leave the place happy. So folks, grab a meal there soon, cause it's definitely worth it.

Located near deshapriya park this unit of bon appetit cafe really impressed me with it's speciality food paratha and decor.
A funky decor with cool Hindi quote plates hanging and the multiple wall hangings about Desi food and culture was really impressive. A small cozy place which gives you the feeling of eating parathas sitting in a nice colourful dhaba.
The service was real quick and cooperative. The staffs guided well which best delicacies to try for.
Now coming to food, I took cheese chicken paratha (people who are cheese lovers is a must try for
 them) and red velvet paratha with red velvet cake stuffing and Choco and strawberry syrup and ice cream served as a whole. For drinks I took an aam lassi which was yumm  smooth and thick.
The quantity is real good and having one paratha is enough to feel half your appetite.
The next cute thing I liked was the graphic kettle in which the bill was given.
It was a warm experience in chilly winter and people who love Desi food is a must try of this place.

New in the town & small place but a pocket size power house.Located in lake terrace road 5 minutes walking from deshapriya park.Those who want to relish over a wide variety of mouth watering parathas this is the place for you.
Ambience-ambience decent enough with some unique taglines scattered all over the interior.
Food-
Chicken cheese paratha-this is absolute stunner soft & cheesy this will certainly satisfy your taste buds.
Chocolate paratha-this is also too good & so picture perfect dish.
Badam lassi-this is rejuvenating & delicious
Murg achari lasun-this is also lip smacking
Mustard chilly chicken wings-this i
Chicken cheese paratha-this is absoluts served in a unique way in a small stainless steel box & this also is perfect starter.
But I found staffs are not smart enough or may be not well informed.
Food-4.5/5

Ambience and decor is the only good thing bout the place. Unlike most of us, I didnot find anything pleasing bout the food. They were running out of cheese..so most of the dishes were unavailable.

Today, me and my friend has visited the place for the love of parathas at the outlet near Deshapriya Park (to be exact Sartaj Basar road) .

Yes little difficult to spot the place. we took help of Google maps and found it.

Had a wonderful experience there. It has very small place but the ambience is nice with cute decoration. and stuffs are well behaved. overall nice.

We have ordered :
1. Chicken cheese parantha.
2. Pahaari paneeer parantha.
3. Chicken tandoori wings.
All the dishes are wonderful. very good in taste.

As they are specialist in making flavoured parathas, you will definitely come over here again and again if you are real parantha lover. planning to go there again to taste their (other) various types of paranthas.

Went to this little food joint with lots of expectations and even though it was easy on the pocket, I didnt like the food much. I had a chicken cheese paratha but it was very bland. Even the mango lassi was nothing extraordinary. The only saving grace was the box of chicken wings. The chicken was soft and juicy.

Perhaps a second visit might change my opinion.

Well my fetish for paratha's kinda a got satisfied after i dropped to this joint. 
Stationed closely to lake terrace, this miniature joint serves you delightful paratha's for a lot of varities.
It kind of brings you down the essence of that lane delhi. 
The decor is amazing and whacky , perfect for a food and fun kind of setting. 
Well we tried 
Classic aloo: Had to try this beacuse i just couldn't let this go. 
Cheese aloo and Cheese mushroom.
I also tried the paneer burji.
Well the food was good where. I got back the taste o found in delhi. The paratha's tasted amazing. 
For me the cheese aloo was undoubtedly the star performer here. 
I would love to come back here to try out the rest of the variants.
If you got a bunch of some real bunch of crazzy buddies ready to spend quality time over these paratha's you should be here.
This place definetly gets a must try tag.

A little hard to spot the little entrance with the name written in small fonts if you don't know the ins and outs of the area but thanks to google maps, we located the cafe on lake terrace road conveniently.
The interior is small but brightly coloured with snippets of Kolkatan life and funny hindi lines. The food is served in steel plates and the water is served in clean plastic cups. Has anyone noticed they have used a kadai for the washbasin? I found that hilarious and pretty well concepted! 
I'd asked for the must try dishes here in a food group in FB from where Rahul Arora(big thanks to him for letting us make correct decision) from the cafe recommended me some dishes of which we chose
1.achari paneer paratha- impressive at the 1st bite, filled with mashed paneer and onions but the chicken and cheese paratha absolutely stole the show.

2.chicken and cheese paratha-a complete showstopper, generously filled with chicken and a must have! Looking forward to try other chicken parathas next time.

3. Red velvet paratha-now this is interesting and unconventional. I love red velvet cakes and I wanted to try it in paratha format as well and it won me over in the first bite itself. Filled with red velvet cake crumbs and topped with vanilla ice cream,chocolate and strawberry syrup, this is another must have which I'm not forgetting soon.

4.classic avalanche- the good old chocolate avalanche, a signature dish of bon appetit which has been my staple since college days. This time,however, I felt the brownie too hard. Otherwise it was delicious, full of ice cream and chocochips and choco syrup and of course the signature wafer sticks!

More generally, I loved the curd served with the parathas but the pickle can be better. The parathas are butter coated giving them a beautiful glaze. The staff are very well mannered. They even cut our red velvet paratha in 4 pieces, even before we said to, for our convenience as we were two. Big thumbs up for that! And the gst is only 5% and who doesn't love that? Thanks for making our sunday evening great!

I wish it was nearer to where I stay. I'd have gone every weekend.

Now we were in a big group of 7-8 people, how can one say of the bat what all we want. We may wish to try different stuff. Moreover during billing we were initially charged stuff we didn't order. However on pointing out, he did try to correct it but apparently once a bill is printed you can't change it or some such thing he told us. Nonetheless we insisted that we billed correctly and after some crossing of words he did give us a correct bill. But overall, much too hyped, but didn't live up to expectation.

The only good thing about this place was the decor..I went to this place just today and I had to write a review on this place.When I entered there were no empty table in the outer seating so we were taken to the inner seating where there were 3 tables out of which we were asked to sit on a table for two.The table was not balanced and shaky we informed the staff and asked them to shift us to some other table Since all the tables were packed they asked us to wait which was obviously fine but even after the tables outside got empty(even when we left the place) they did not inform us and when I told them again they said us that is not possible as it was their rush hour.
The behaviour of the staff was cold and rude.
Now let's come to the food. We ordered 2 aloo cheese parantha,1 pahari paneer paratha and chicken achari keema.It took them more than 40 minutes just to deliver aloo cheese parantha.We had to wait another 15-20 minutes for chicken keema and pahari paneer parantha.By the time we got what we ordered cheese paratha was cold.The paranthas were served with curd and onions dipped in vinegar I guess and full of red chilli powder which was bad.
Parathas were good but not worth the price.Chicken achari keema was horrible, it was too salty and the achari taste overpowered the entire dish that we thought we were having just achar and not chicken.

Lastly on asking them the bill they just handed us the bill..Worst behaviour of the staffs.
Overall a very bad experience.

We literally need more places like Paranthe Wali Galli in Kolkata. The location might be a little difficult to understand since it is situated in the inner lanes, but once you reach the place, you will only be delighted! It has a super menu with a huge parantha spread. This restuarant has a very Indian set-uo, starting from the seating arrangements, the decor and the food. To add to that, the prices are too reasonable. We tried a few paranthe dishes with Tandoori Chicken Wings and they are an absolute delight!¬†

Would definitely recommend this place :)

I have visited this place.... located in residential area.... easy to locate....
Ambience is good but this place is not spacious..... too noisy to talk or listen only because of congested spacing....
Creative fancy decor resemble to northen style colorful Truck decoration because of glass bangles, paranda and funny quotes......:-)) one wall is dedicated to framed images....
Well behaved staff
I ordered Aloo matar parantha & Dhaniya Pyaj Parantha.....
Big in size.... heavily stuff....less oily..... served with curd & red spicy pickle. Taste was awsome....(Dhaniya pyaj paratha feels like sand under my tongue) but could be more better if dhaniya washed off twice or thrice........

Must visit place for heavy Breakfast.........

Dear PWG Team,
Please wash all veggies before preparations.

I have visited this place thrice.
We have tried the following items:
‚óáLassi
‚Ä¢Gandharaj: This Lassi flavour was to die for, the goodness of lassi with the flavour of the king of lemon.
‚Ä¢Motichur: It has the crushed motichur laddoo so it was a bit too sweet for my liking, but otherwise it was delicious.
‚Ä¢Sitaphal: This was simply heavenly. It was creamy, mildly favoured and sweet.
‚óáParantha
‚Ä¢Chicken Nawabi: It has shredded chicken cooked in spices as the stuffing, tastes fine.
‚Ä¢Thai Chilli Corn: It has an extremely spicy filling. The corn is crushed. We liked it.
‚Ä¢Chilli Garlic Paneer: Although it had loads of paneer stuffed but the chilli garlic flavour was thoroughly lacking.
‚Ä¢Chocolate: It has a generous stuffing of brownie cake inside but the sauce is less, so it tasted quite dry.
‚óáWings
‚Ä¢Chettinad: They serve this in steel Tiffin boxes to give that dhaba feel. It tasted distinctly south Indian, quite good for a one time try.
‚óáPhuchka
‚Ä¢Phuchkizza: Being an avid Phuchka lover, this is one of the worst food mistakes. Charging so much for some cheese and oregano sprinkled over roadside phuchkas is too bad.
Btw, I like the pickled onions and curd that they serve with the paranthas.
¬§Ambience; the perfect Delhi style dhaba ambience. The decor is very quirky, I love it.
¬§Service; this is fine too. They make efforts in maintaining courtesy.

Been there last week. Those who craves for deshi food must try this place. Decor is colourful and with innovative funny quotes. There variations in parantha brings the ambience of old Delhi. Coming to the taste, food is very chatpata made with Indian spices. And they also serve food in deshi style like paranthe with pickels and curd etc. Chicken cheese parantha and tandoori chicken wings are my personal favourite. Will surely visit this place again.

We were searching for sube good north Indian food place which is pocket friendly as well when we came across this place.
Tiny place with a very Desi vibe(the door, the decor, the photographs). It ll give you a North India's highway side dhaba feeling. 5/5 to ambience and concept 
The place closes pretty early at 9pm. Since we reached there after 8.30, we had to wind up our order pretty quickly. We ordered 1. lehsuni Paratha(stuffed with sattu pyaz and lehsun mixture, medium spicy and tasty)
2. chatpata paneer Paratha, chilli garlic paneer Paratha( both the parathas were similar in taste and lacked a Lil but of salt) 3. chocolate Paratha- this was a pleasant surprise as the Paratha was stuffed with chocolate brownie and topped with chocolate syrup and choco chips. Must try if you are a chocolate fan. 
4. classic Aloo Paratha- the regular aloo Paratha 
All the parathas were stuffed heavily and were very thick. One should be enough for one( girls at least :p) 
The parathas were accompanied with seasoned onions and pickle and curd which were a great combination. 
We also ordered Lassi. It was a sweet one flavored wit vanilla essence which is what I didn't like. 
4/5 to food overall. 
One more thing, the staff there didn't help us with how much food would be sufficient for us as it was our first visit and were only concerned about wrapping up the last order of the day. Service could be improved. 3/5
Overall a nice place and must visit if you are fond of stuffed parathas.

Such a relief to find a good parantha place in kolkata! On top of that, it's super pocket friendly, it's located at a very accessible place and the decor is catchy. We tried the mirch aloo, gobi and chicken cheese paranthas. The aloo and gobi ones were amazing and the chicken one was a bit chewy but tasted super good. They are not miserly with the stuffing and the food is served piping hot. Only one, tiny complaint - why does this place have to close at 9pm :/ It would be great if they could extend their timings at least on three weekends.

Today I visited for the 4th time.¬† But today's experience is very bad. We were four. At first Order Cheese Chicken Paratha, Cheese Mutton Paratha, Dhania Mirch Chicken Paratha and Achari Keema. The mutton paratha was salty in taste. Now the best part, I order cheese mutton paratha again, but served me cheese chicken. I asked the person served, that you have served me wrong, this is cheese chicken not mutton, then the person told me not this is mutton. Then they gave me the bill and charged for two cheese mutton paratha. I then told them that you have served chicken instead of mutton, two person came and then said not that was mutton, shredded mutton and i dont know the difference between mutton and chicken. Then the second person said " You want rebate of will give rebate and stuff", like he is doing a favour . I then asked please behave properly will review bad, then he said do what ever you want to doesn't matter. Seriously never expected this kind of stuff from this restaurant. Heard a lot, been there so many times and was planning to give a good review. But today's incident end up me giving 1 stars. This one stars is for my precious experience with this restaurant which was good.

Over all i think this place need some more improvements in the ground of taste of some dish...  u should try this place atleast once...

Paranthe Wali Galli -- brings back the memories of that Old Delhi charm and some mouthwatering paranthas. This joint does justice to its name when it comes to a wide variety of paranthas that they serve.
Last week, I visited this place with my Mom as we really liked their food when we had got home delivery from them earlier.
The place is small but very bright and colourful. One let down is that the seating arrangement is kind of uncomfortable.
Coming to food, I have to say that their paranthas are incredible. We tried the Dhaniya peyaz parantha and Cheese mushroom parantha. Any cheese parantha here is highly recommended. Along with that, we had the Achari Chicken wings which we didn't like that much. For dessert, we opted for the Laddoo parantha which was, again, awesome.
Service was nothing great, kind of okayish.
So as to conclude, I must say that this place serves the best paranthas in town!!

A place where you can get the feel of punjabin dhaba. The decor is really nice and eye-soothing with full of freezing moments of punjabi culture. We ordered Chiclen Chettinaad which tasted awesome. Then we ordered cheese classic paratha which is there well-known dish but i found it just okay and Chili Garlic Paratha which was good to taste, a little different but nothing special. They give a bowl of curd and puckle with every paratha. With paratga we tried paneer bhujiya which was good. Then as a dessert I ordered Santra Kulfi which was excellent to see but just good to taste. My friend took Mango lasii which was average

And to top ut up we soent half hour to find the place as the lication was wrong , when to reached there we thought to inform them so they can do the needful but we got a cold response!

After planning for several weeks finally gave a visit to this restaurant. When you enter the restaurant you will see number of photos of Street food on the wall and also some catchy food quotes.Loved the interior decoration. They serve varieties of parathas and who doesn't love parathas. 
We had ordered
1.Chicken cheese paratha
2.Cheese garlic paratha
3.Achari aloo paratha
4. Dhania mirch paratha
5.Badam rabri lassi
6.Classic avalanche
All the parathas were yummy. Specially chicken cheese paratha and cheese garlic paratha. Badam rabri lassi was also good, it was thick and tasty. We found Classic avalanche not up to the mark because the brownie was not properly done. Otherwise the service was excellent.

This place serves amazing varieties of paratha, lassis & other chicken sides. Starting from the food menu to the decor, everything has got this desi vibe to it.

AMBIENCE/DECOR - This is a cosy small place, accommodation capacity of around 24 people. Beautifully decorated with witty one liners, pictures of food & people capturing the desi essence of India & kaanch ke churis. The ambience immediately captures your heart with its colorful & vibrant decor. They have a kadhai in place of the wash basin, innovation at its best. 

FOOD- They serve the best parathas in Kolkata. My favorites are cheese mushroom paratha, chicken cheese paratha, chettinad chicken, chocolate paratha & chocolate avalanche.

SERVICE - Service is good. The bill is served in a kettle & as mouth freshners candies are given.

POCKET PINCH- 400 for two!

Wish to find a piece of punjabi dhaba in Kolkata.. look no further than this. Located close to Southern Avenue, this place is a small shop hidden away in one of the by-lanes of lake terrace road. It has a rustic charm to it but the food is more than just charming. They have both the traditional type of paranthas as well as westernised ones. We ordered for a cheese mushroom parantha and an aloo mirchi one. Along with chicken wings. The cheese mushroom one felt like a pizza with a desi feel. It had gooey cheese and loads of mushroom. Served hot with curd and masala onion (which didn‚Äôt go well with this particular kind), but still made me feel as if I was on cloud nine. Aloo mirchi one was thick hot and delicious. We then ordered for a cheese mutton. The base was the same as cheese mushroom but the meat lifted the taste to another level. Although the paranthas were a bit greasy, we didn‚Äôt quite mind it.. what‚Äôs a parantha that‚Äôs dry? Chicken wings were served hot with semi gravy but they were too sour for my taste. It could‚Äôve complimented the cheese parantha had it been a little less sour. We finished it off with badaam rabri lassi - pure delight. A piece of heaven on earth. Bliss. I‚Äôm running out of adjectives. It was thick, sweet tasty and had cashew, almond crushed and sprinkled on top. Love this place and I think I will keep going back till I‚Äôve tried all the paranthas.

Went to this place on a saturday. We did not have to wait as it was not that crowded. A small joint which can accomodate about 30 people at a go. The theme and decor is really nice, the staffs are helpful and courteous. We ordered chocolate paratha (as per recommendation), but this was too sweet. People who have a craving for sweet or chocolate can try this one. This one is filled witb brownie and topped with chocolate sauce and white and black choco chips. Other than this we ordered achari chicken, which was also nice. The one that took our heart away is cheese mutton paratha. This tasted too good-  a must try. If not mutton, then chicken cheese paratha or the cheese  mushroom paratha. The preparation is really awesome.
To make it a complete one, we also ordered lassi which was yummilocious. All the three variants that we have tried - plain lassi, badam rabdi lassi and mango lassi. All three were yummy. A paratha and a glass of lassi is too kuch for a person to have in a full course meal. Very filling.

A punjabi restaurant with  Unique concept of specializing in parathas and there was a varied collection of lassi too..can improve in hospitality.

I did not even know a place like this existed in Kolkata (maybe I am not quite the foodie that I consider myself to be) . This restaurant is a small cozy place located at Deshapriya Park (not too far from Jugal's Sweets) . As the name suggests ,they serve paranthas and a wide variety of them . The menu card suggests that they serve rice as well ; but people don't go there to eat rajma-chawal ! Ok , back to paranthas. So they prepare veg and non-veg and cheese and chocolate and what not paranthas. They also prepare side dishes but you will find that a side-dish is not even required (like we found out). The paranthas come along with curd and onions ; and are very very tasty ! We ordered cheese and chicken paranthas . The cheese parantha had enough stuffing to feed a family of 4 (yes , not for the weak-hearted) . We also ordered chicken keema which was kind of ok-ish . We didn't order any desserts but did take lassi ; they were absolutely awesome ! The 3 of us had 3 paranthas , a dish of keema and 3 lassis) and paid around 900 ! Well, to summarize, a great place to hangout !

After hearing a lot of good reviews finally visited Parathe wali gali in october...though went there is march also but cudn't get a seat at that time as it was full with already people waiting...but surprisingly in october i found the place to be completely empty...the decor was really colorful with all the belans and churis and all...we ordered chicken cheese paratha,chicken achari paratha,chilli garlic paratha and schezwan chicken wings...apart from the chicken cheese paratha the others were pretty much....disappointing...schezwan wings being sweet most probably a mix up with honey chicken wings...but we passed that of thinking shit happens sometimes but what really shocked us was the service....when we asked the paratha to be sliced into 5 pieces (since there were 5 of us) the waiter coldly replied they won't be able to slice it, they will provide butter knife with which we will have to slice ot ourselves...when asked for extra spoons and plates they were so reluctant as if we have committed a crime...now the most shocking part...we were served water is plastic glasses that we see in roadside stalls...even if we believe that is done to go with the theme...the people un the adjacent table (only 2 tables were occupied including ours during our stay there) were served water in cheap use and throw plastic glasses...this definitely doesnot go with the decor but rather than the lack of diners...the rating here is based on the decor and the chicken cheese parathas the only 2 positives we found about the place
P.S. those who are expecting candies with the bill reading from the previous reviews cut down your expectations.

Probably the best food we‚Äôve had in Kolkata and for the price it‚Äôs an outrageous deal. We got the classic aloo and some chicken & rice. The classic aloo was fantastic! 

The lassi was also great. Orange tasted like sherbet and the strawberry was solid.

It justifies the name. I just loved the decor - the tussles, bangles, quirky quotes, pictures and bright colors. Chicken cheese paratha is a must try. Chicken chettinad was also tasty. Don't forget to order Lassi. I surely recommend it to all the foodies out there.

Today i visited this place .i have heard a lot about this place and finally i had been there.we ordered classic alu paratha and tandoori chicken keema and chai.
Keema was nice but the alu paratha was less paratha more dosha...üôÑ .
I kinda liked the interior ;stuffs were decent .
Just what i expected to be the best was worst the alu paratha. :-(

Paranthe wali galli is a famous street in Chandni chowk delhi,where you can find series of shops selling paranthas. Bon Apetit has successfully brought a flavour of that in this well decorated small eatery in kolkata .
Located very near to deshapriya park , it is close to sai baba mandir.
The decor is nice,colorful and innovative. You can find aluminium buckets with cushions on them as outdoor seating arrangements .
Inside they have intelligently decorated the the walls with sarees , 'belans' ,bangles and painted thalis with cheesy quotes on them. Most importantly the ambience was very calm and quiet which i liked.
We had cheese alu parantha, lehsuni parantha , honey chilli chicken wings , green apple lassi and masala coke.
Quantity- One parantha is suffiently stomach stuffing for one. Chicken wings come in 4 pieces in an aluminium box.(which i find unique).
Quality- Just two words. Mindblowingly yummy.
The cheese aloo paratha reminds me of indian version of cheese burst pizza with enough stuffing. Chicken wings was soft and tasty. Green apple lassi was also soothing to taste buds.
Hospitality- the staffs were nice and well behaved. The service was fast.

Ps.- You will find a iron kadhai as a wash basin üòÇüòÇ and bill is served in a painted kettle..

Located at the heart of Deshopriya park near the CCD, this place sure brings the taste of the original paranthe wali galli from delhi to kolkata.

The service is fab and the staff are very well behaved and communicative.

Coming to the decor quirky messages adorn the walls with desi props and for people who enjoy photography you'll love the frames on display.

Food is 100 percent shuddh desi bole toh khana Ekdum changa hai ji...

Quantity and quality is very much complimented by the charges of the same.

Served in typical thalis each parantha is dish to savour and relish.

Went for Achari Chicken along with Cheese Chicken and if you're going for desi food then definitely Lassi had to be there, also packed their chocolate parantha which is a must try also.

Surely coming back for round two.
Billing came Upto 550+ taxes.

Ask for a Desi feel and you get it here instantly. Right from the door your enter to the tables and chairs to the decor, it is quite Indian. We ordered a chicken cheese paratha and an aloo paratha with chicken keema alongwith a mango lassi and kesar malai lassi. By the time we had half eaten each of the parathas, we were full. Chicken keema could have been a bit little oily and the mango lassi could have been a little sugary. All in all, a good outing,  a filling one!

Paranthe Wali galli.,as we know is a well known place in Delhi.This place is a piece of it.And they quite well fulfill your expectations of enjoying the feeling of Delhi. Well its easy to locate if you follow Google map.Small outlet decorated nicely.They have various parantha items on menu.We ordered cheese and Achari Parantha which were served along with Dahi and Acchar. Besides parantha we ordered one chicken keema dish and Egg bhujia.Well the keema dish was not that satisfactory but the bhujia was good.Overall a good place for us to hangout often and spend some lazy hours and that to within a limited budget. üòâ

I simply loved Paranthe wali galli. Everything about thid place is so good.

Starting from the entrance to the interiors are so colourful and well decorated. The staffs serving food were wearing gloves which indicated the care taked for preparation and serving of food.

We took chicken cheese parantha. It was so delicious! ‚ù§ Parantha stuffed with good amount of chicken and cheese.

The red velevet parantha look so cuteüòä‚ù§ and tasted awsome though a little too sweet for my taste. Prices are affordable.

After reading some good reviews on zomato, I've decided to check in this restaurant but it was a very horrible experience for me..

They have many variety of parantha's and one get confused which Parantha is best for one.. I've decided to have "Classic Aloo" but the staff has guided me wrong and I placed my order of "Mirch Aloo"

Now come to the food, the order which I placed was simply horrible, the salt content was very high in the parantha and the mirch was red which I thought would be green..

But somehow, I've completed it and just fill my stomach.. The ambience is good different types of wall paintings, slogans you can find in this restaurant..

I think I have placed a wrong order due to some sort of confusion but the content of salt and chilly should be low..

I recommend this restaurant to those who know which parantha they serve best bcoz I know if I would placed the order of chicken cheese, chocolate or classic the result would might had been better..

I am not sure of my next visit untill and unless I am completely sure which parantha they serve best bcoz they have a huge variety of paranthas..

Located near deshopriyo park this restaurant had created a lot of buzz... On entering the joint one would definitely get impressed by the decor.... With bangles and Hindi quotes written, it gives a feel of Delhi....
Coming to the staff we were fortunate enough to be attended by the owner himself who was very humble n cooperative...
For the food we ordered chicken cheese parantha,chicken dhania mirch  parantha n chilli chicken parantha... While the latter two tasted quite decent,the chicken cheese parantha was more than heavenly....we simply loved the impeccable balance of cheese and chicken...i can go the restaurant over and over again to have this...they serve the paranthas with pickle n curd... We also ordered chettinad chicken keema n tandoori chicken wings(here to be noted that they have 5 different flavours in this category)... Though one hardly needs any side dish yet they tasted really finger licking... Their lassi is too good as well ..but the icing on the cake was the red velvet parantha....it is in the dessert section n though it's very sweet but nonetheless it is out of the world. It tasted somewhat like the hot choco lava cake.(p.s. do share it as a single parantha will be too much for one to consume)
But what i liked the most was in spite of having so many dishes the bill was quiet pocket pinch...hence strongly recommended to the parantha lovers...

Firstly, the place is small and beautifully decorated. The ambience deserves a 10/10!
We ordered aam lassi, which was extremely chilled and heavy. The taste was heavenly! If we weren't full, we could have ordered one more.
We ordered aloo mirch paratha and masaledar sattu paratha which was quite large and extremely heavy! One entire paratha can actually make you full!
The chicken wings achaari lasoon was extremely tasty with the right amount of sourness!
Overall the experience was a good one!
And not to forget, the staff is really nice and quite courteous!

Motichur lassi will be a must try, being lil different from normal lassis.

We were looking for some budget lunchn on the day of Asthami around the Gariahat area and we came across this restaurant with 4.2 rating on zomato and also strictly within budget range. Place was located inside the streets. But the wait was worth it. Its paranthas were the best that I have eaten. And Badam Lassi was equally good as well. Staff members were also polite and helpful. Do try the Cheese Garlic Parantha here. Its simply mouth watering.

But this quite joint really helped me to get acquainted with paranthas better. The food in one word is delicious. My friend and I had a chicken cheese and a classic aloo parantha and boy they tasted so good especially the chicken cheese one. The size of the parantha is enough to fill you. Well the very innovative and bright decor also deserve a very special mention!

the wooden bench,thaali,quotes on the wall,a kadai as the basin every single thing is well thought of,very very creative.
now coming to the food,we had cheese mushroom and cheese chicken paratha,both tasted yummy and one patatha is enough to fill your tummy.
masala thumps too deserve a thumbs up.
plus.. you will find a or two hot guys there serving you hotter parathas  ;) just keep your eyes open! *winks*

The most overhyped place in the city. Their customer service is the worst. They take 40-50 mins to serve your order. The staffs are full of attitude. They should learn how to behave with customers.

Coming to their food we tried their classic aloo parantha and chocolate parantha. The aloo parantha was okay however the chocolate parantha is too sweet and one can die of diabetes after having it.

Their lassi are the only thing which can be termed as good.

Paranthe Wali Gali was from same owner of Bon Apetit.
Located very near to the Codfather restaurant.

We took Mango Lassi which was very good.
Also we ordered Achari Chicken Paranthe which had too much of pickle. Not liked at all.

Cheese chicken paranthe was good. Tried their chettinad chicken keema which was very good and yummy.

Ambiance was good. Decoration was like dhaba style. Overal a nice experience.

Both were exceptionally good. But I was not happy with the chicken chettinaad wings we ordered. However their chocolate avalanche made me forget everything. That was the best among all. Their service was a little slow. Overall it was a good experience.

I took home a chili honey keema from here. It should be chili keema because regardless of the balance, there wasn't even a drop of honey and it was extremely spicy. The quantity of the meat was just 30% while in the rest 70% I was just chewing onions. If my first experience is so bad, why should I recommend anyone or go back at all?

It was an fantastic experience .We ordered chicken cheese paratha and pudina mutton Partha along with tandoori chicken wings,here to be mentioned they have 7 types of chicken wings in their menu. The tandoori chicken wings were finger licking. In the dessert the restaurant guy suggested us to have red velvet paratha and I don't have any words to say how heavenly it was.I am surely going back there soon to dig into another flavoured parathas. Kudos to the whole team.

Another over hyped restaurant...the experience was little disappointing. But not entirely because their prices are really cheap. You can have a dinner within just 200 bucks. You can two paranthas or one parantha and rice dish, and that is enough for two people. 
That's how we played
I was little overwhelmed by seeing that many types of paranthas. It was like a child in a candy shop. After spending half and hour arguing, we settle on to achari aloo parantha, chicken rice and badam kesar lassi. 
Sadly, the service was little sloth and was not that efficient. Paranthas came out of the kitchen real quick, but had to wait for the rice for long half and hour. Then a little change of plans and we ended up ordering Rajma chawal too. 
Taste - 
Parantha was accompanied by plain yogurt and achar. It tasted ok. But it was little bitter, I don't know was it methi or some other spices that overpowered the real taste. However it was good tummy filler. Eat one whole parantha and you are done for the night. 
Then comes the chicken rice. It was streamed basmati rice with well cooked chicken keema gravy. The taste is not worth remembering. But I do remember that the quantity was something to brag about. It was more than enough for me or anyone. Similar to parantha, it also tasted little bitter. After taking four to five spoons, that bitter starts taking its tolls. 
Ok now coming to badam kesar lassi, I have only one word for that. It was out of the world delicious. I am not a big fan of lassis. But I did like this.
And finally our last ordered dish rajma chawal. All I can say is it was nothing like I expected. I expected pack full of flavours and mouth watering delicacy. But it was OK. Again the quantity was huge. And we regretted after ordering it because there is no in stomach to dumb it. So we got it packed. 
All in one it was an average experience. I am not sure whether I would this place ever again. But I do want to try their various types of parantha. In my final words, I would like to say, this place is surely serving something different. But  I would like to see them serving good quality food accompanied with good quantity

How a restaurant loses a faithful customer? 

Ans: Billing rules at 'owner's  discretion'.

I've been almost regular to PWG and have split the bill with whoever I have visited. Today, when I asked them to split the same between two cards, a staffer said: "The owner has asked us not to use two cards for one bill." 

Almost all joints in the city allow it's customers with freedom of payment - which includes many other cafes to pubs and small-time joints.  And moreover, the bank also doesn't charge differently. 

I guess the owner, Rahul Arora,  just has different plans for its faithful diners.

My first line should be DO NOT MISS OUT THE BADAM RABRI LASSIüòáüòáüòá The reason for not giving 0.5  is that the paranthas can be little more tastier. Had chicken cheese parantha and Aloo cheese parantha. It's heavy 1.5 parantha and a Lassi will fill your appetite. Will visit soon.

On saptami morning during the Durga Puja I went to this place with 3 of my friends.It is on one of the lanes of Deshapriyo Park.This place has a desi quirky ambience which is pretty cool.We ordered chicken Chettinad wings for starters.They were cooked well and tastes absolutely fine.Next we had cheese chicken parathas.They were loaded with melted cheese and shredded chicken.The food was awesome and were delicious ! The parathas were pretty big too.The picket pinch is reasonable and totally worth it ! I would love to visit this place again and really soon.

Loved every bit of the food ordered today....food was sensational enough to tinkle your tastebuds...too good..we ordered chicken cheese paratha, mutton cheese paratha, strawberry lassi, pan lassi, nimbu pani, achari lehsun chicken wings. For me the showstopper was strawberry lassi..it had me asking for more. The pan lassi gave strawberry lassi a tough competition. The parathas dont need any separate applause..they were cheesy chickeny full of stuffing. Not to forget the achari lehsun chicken wings tasted awesome, were juicy and had the right amount of spices and were finger lickable. Thanks fir making our day after a long tiring day of pandal hopping. Kudos, looking forward to visiting you more often.

What needs to be improved - lights are too bright, if one is prone to attacks of migraine it may cause troubles. 
place is too small, if 2 people are only going, u have to sit on small stools. 
Locating the place is a bit difficult if you dn't know the area well.

Amazing food and very pocket friendly. A rustic ambience that makes it best for hanging out with your close ones. Their lassis are delicious plus freshly made and not put in your glasses from cartons. So this place is a must try!

Had plans of visiting this place for a real long time and finally we managed to drop in today... The ambience is good, only I wish they were open till at least 10.30pm as paranthas that are sold is good for dinner but unfortunately they close by 9pm which is a bit disappointing... We ordered for chicken cheese parantha, chilly garlic chicken parantha, paneer parantha and 3 varieties of Lassi... The paranthas had perfect filing of the stuffing... The Lassi needs little improvement as I had Sitafal Lassi n there was hardly any taste of Sitafal... That .5 less is only Coz of the Lassi and the timings..

Great place for all Paratha Lovers. They have unique varieties of parathas. We ordered Lehsuni Paratha and Dhaniya Mirch Chicken Paratha both tasted yummy, they serve parathas with curd, onion pickle and mixed pickle. 
They need to extend the time..its open only till 9p.m.

Superb ambience..nice and interesting decor. Now coming to food we ordered chicken cheese paratha, aloo corn paratha, dhania mirch paratha and badam rabri lassi.. All the stuffings were made with the right hint of spices. I loved the Chicken cheese paratha and aloo corn paratha. One paratha is just like a medium sized pan pizza. The melting cheese was simply superr in it. Lassi was creamy and delicious.Would love to visit the place again soon. You might find it a bit costly but the heavenly taste of the dishes will make you forget it..

One hungry evening, I decided to try paranthas from this place. We had ordered via Swiggy. Our food arrived on time, all neatly packed. The paranthas were accompanied by pickle and curd. They had also sent disposable plates along with out order (how thoughtful of them).¬†

We had ordered 3 paranthas that were more than sufficient for 2 people. The chocolate parantha (that came in a pizza box), achaari paneer parantha and chicken cheese parantha. Their chicken cheese parantha is to die for! Seriously. Such soft paranthas with oodles of cheese, it tasted yummy! The chocolate parantha is also a must have for all chocolate lovers. As for me, though initially it tasted very nice, but over the time I felt it was a little too chocolaty for my taste. The achaari paneer parantha was just okay.¬†

Try this place for their variety of paranthas. You will not be disappointed. Pocket pinch is moderate. We ordered a take-away, so cannot really comment about the decor and service. Will definitely visit their outlet sometime.

I am totally impressed ! This place is my one of the most favourite place right now.
The decor is wondeful. The food menu is brief and simple. 
We tried achari aloo parantha and achari chicken parantha. Both were amazing. The achari chicken parntha was the best. 
For dessert we tried chocolate parantha and that was huge ! If you like sweets and chocolates , you are going to loveeee chocolate parantha otherwise it can be too heavy for someone. We had coffee and that was also very good. You can have enough food under Rs. 500, it is that affordable ! 5 stars for this place.

Located in desopriyo Park. Gives u very Punjabi vibe, which is really cool. We ordered paneer paratha and onion garlic paratha, chicken keema and a glass of lassi. Both the paratha's tasted same and it was filled with onions, even in cheese paratha. I didn't find any keema in chicken though and the Lassi was like normal lassi. I found the price to be higher compared to the taste.

It is an ideal place for all paratha lovers..though it is little bit  difficult to identify the xct location yet it will surely change one's mood after visiting.
It is near Desopriya Park..the road leading to golpark.
Now come to the food..i usually love to taste some different dishes.hence it has been in my bucket list since a very long time..The place is little bit cozy bt the decoor was really soothing..We ordered
1. CHICKEN CHEESE PARANTHA--It was loaded with cheese chicken..too good in taste..the main attraction was hidden in the serving manner.It was served with dahi and anchar..
2.CHICKEN TANDOORI WINGS--It looked too catchy when served.it was within a little box..It was well coocked mouth watering.
3.MOTICHUR LASSI-- really mind blowing.
4.PUCHK IZZA--Puchka in a differnt way.recomended for all puchka lovers 
5.RED VELVET PARANTHA--It was a desert like dish for us..though it looked good yet for me it was okayish in taste..
Service was prompt nd quite good..would like to visit again to taste the rest menu ss..üòä

Cosy & quirky are the words to describe this place approximately.The decor with some catchy lines are bound to draw attention.That doesn't mean the culinary skill is any less.Badam rabri lassi is creamy.Kali daal is tangy.Keema chawal is served in a cool steel tiffin box & it is yum.Now the paranthas.Dhania mirch chicken parantha & the dessert dish Orange chocolate parantha are lovely & filling.Wish they served the latter with gelatinous candies instead of the hard ones.A beautiful place to savour the warm paranthas in a rainy afternoon.Recommended!

Memories of travelling and eating in eateries nearby highways of Delhi, Jaipur and Punjab comes into mind as soon as you indulge a bite of paranthas of this joint. Situated in tiny lane near Deshapriya Park, this food joint offers wide variety of lip smacking parantha and lassi. After getting review from a friend,  visited the joint.  We ordered :-

1. Cheese Classic Parantha :- Tiny parts of cheese melts in your mouth as soon as you intake the very first bite of this parantha. Definitely a must try!!! 

2. Sattu Parantha :- New item. Tried. Taste was excellent. 

3. Chocolate Parantha :- Don't try to miss this one,  if you are a chocolate lover. No words to describe. Absolutely fabulous. 

4. Sitafal and Pan Lassi :- Quite refreshing and flavours were very tasty. 

Each of these parantha was accompanied by curd and pickle.  We even had Dal Makhani in vegetable. 

Bill was accompanied by Black Toffee. 

Overall Experience :- 5/5
Staff :- 5/5
Cleanliness :- 5/5

Will surely come back and try other varieties.

It's located in Southern Avenue. The interior space of this restaurant is not so big, but it's small and cozy.
 The interior decoration and the ambience was quite nice. The service was good but one waiter didn't allow us to enter the interior section of the restaurant and he was quite rude to me.

Now coming to the food they served. We ordered

Honey chilli chicken wings - The sauce was awesome. They served 4 soft and delicious chicken wings.

Chicken Cheese Paratha - This was the best paratha I ever tasted in my life. It was a treat to the taste buds.

Chicken Achari Paratha - I found this one a little bit sour, so I didn't enjoy it to that extent. But my Friend who loves aachar loved this one.

Overall the experience was good.

It is a restaurant located near Southern Avenue. Their specialty is parhatha of different types which are stuffed with different unique varieties. They even have some international parhatha types which sounds interesting. The parhatha we had was good in taste with curd and achar as the side help. They make awesome lassies too. The mango lassi was a treat to the tastebuds.A must visit place in kolkata as it is a restaurant of different concept.

Another hidden gem to explore... A very small place giving a dhaba type of ambiance.. 
Food was good. Never tried chicken cheese paratha anywhere... Ordered that.. Tastes good.. But the chilli corn paratha blowed our mind... Exact amount of flavours with chillies corns and cheese is simply awesome. 
Service is bit on a slower but good food will overcome all the negativities.. Definitely worth a visit.

I have never been to this place but I got a home delivery from them. I miss not going to this lovely place as seen in photos, it has a great interior.
I ordered one chicken cheese parantha and one chocolate parantha (which I heard for the first time and couldn't wait to try).
Coming to the food, chicken parantha was delicious it came with Dahi and pickles with raw onions. But one chicken parantha wasn't enough to meet my hunger (don't know about you). Chicken cheese parantha was just as expected.
Chocolate parantha was a real new dish for me. It came is a really cool packaging. The parantha was topped with chocolate sauce and white and dark chocolate chips. That looked like a chocolate pizza. The parantha was hot and it had a brownie type of filling inside it and it was too sweet for me (I don't have a sweet tooth though). It was really filling and you will get tired completing it as I was. May we cauldron eat it as a dessert, because it's too sweet for a main course.
I Wish, I could personally visit this place and have the food there but next time I will visit Kolkata, this place will be in my bucket list.

This is a really good place for parathe lovers. Went there a week ago.
The interior is impressive. Staffs were courteous.
We had ordered achari chicken paratha,
tandoori chicken keema,
gulabi gulkand lassi &
badam rabri lassi.
The achari chicken paratha is a must try dish. They served the paratha with achar & curd. It tasted yummy. The stuffing was great. This paratha is itself enough to give you satiety.
The keema was average.
Badam rabri lassi & gulabi gulkand lassi were awesome with true punjabi flavours.
Overall our experience was nice. And it was pocket friendly. 
Looking forward to further visits.

I had been wanting to visit this place for a long time after hearing so many rave reviews about it. We ordered the Cheese Chicken Paratha, The Mutton Dhania Paratha as well as Dhania Mirch Chicken. 

The cheese chicken and Dhani mirch chicken were amazing, though I would not advise anyone to get the mutton paratha.

We also had the Gulabi Gulkand Lassi, which I would recommend everyone to try, and the badam rabri Lassi and motichhor Lassi, which I would ask you to avoid. 



The service was prompt and friendly and the ambience even more so, with funny quotes on the wall.

The place was not a disappointment, and was quite pocket friendly, but we will not be visitingit again till it fixes it's biggest issue. Ventilation.

The ventilationneeds to be dealt with immediately as the sulphur from the onions being cut and the fumes of the masala being fried in the kitchen made its way to the outer sittingarea, and actuallymade the experience painful. I would advise anyone with sensitive eyes to stay away till they fix it up.

The very name of this joint brings back to your mind the phenomenal flavours of " Delhi ki Parathe Wali Gali" and this place actually not will disappointed you at all.... ‚ò∫Ô∏è
A good venture by "Bon Appetite"... Paranthe Wali Gali is absolutely unique in it's ambiance,decor,staffs and definitely in its relishing flavours though finding this place is little tricky... The joint is located at the by-lane of Monalisha guest house near Deshopriyo Park..
Ambiance is pretty nice with photographs and quotations hanging onthe both side of the wall... Creative indeed...  Now coming to the food we ordered Badam rabri lassi...Gulabo gulkand lassi..Honey chili and Achari lasun Chicken wings...in paratha Chane ki daal..Chicken cheese...Chili garlic chicken...Red velvet...
Well it's delicacy lies entirely on the paranthes so we get 35-36 different lip smacking flavours of it.. The best according to me obviously the Chicken Cheese Paranthe.. üòã The paranthe serves with dahi and pyaz wala pickle...
I'll visit this place again and again to have their delicious and fingering licking good food... Service was good and the members too....
Overall good experience...

These guys are mastering culinary experimentation. With the insane variety of new-age remakes of the classical Indian dishes, Paranthe Wali Galli, will definitely make you come back for more. Our hearty lunch included:

1. Aloo Methi parantha - 4.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[The "safe bet" didn't disappoint at all. Tender as they are supposed to be]

2. Achari Chicken parantha - 4.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[Paranthas always went well achar (pickles) and chicken, when its clubbed in together, its a whole different ball game. A little drier, went amazingly well with Honey Chili, standalone, the achari flavour might become a bit overwhelming after some time]

3. Honey Chili - 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[Shredded chicken cooked in a hot and sweet sauce, being more inclined towards sweet. Standalone tasting almost made us regret ordering it, but was a brilliant companion to the tangy and salty Achari Chicken parantha]

The decor has a colourful rustic look, with snippets of "desi" images framed up on the wall. A good job done by the team of Bon Appetite, I actually liked this better than their cafes. A well deserved 4.5‚≠êÔ∏è

P.S. Every paratha comes with a free serving of curd and onion pickles. The paranthas are around 8" in diameter, about the size of a medium pizza, so make sure you order accordingly. You'd really hate wasting something this tasty.

I have heard a lot about their out of the box paranthas for a long time and finally gave it a try on last evening.  The decor is a delight to the eyes; it was so colourful and must have been done by a true blue Punjabi. We ordered rooh gulab sarbat and kaala khatta sarbat to quench our thirst. Then we took their much famous chicken cheese parantha and ghugni. Parantha came with aachar and dahi and did 100% justice to its fame and ghugni was a perfect side. Then we took Keema pav and chocolate parantha. Keema was spicy and delicious but I will visit this restaurant again to have their chocolate parantha. It was so tasty that it deserves to be eaten again. Overall experience- 
Decor- 5/5

Amidst the plethora of Paranthes, the Aloo Corn one caught my eye and is definitely worth a try. The Badam lassi is a sure go too but the dessert made my day-Red Velvet Paranthe: a heavenly creation!

Probably one of the best places in the city to have paranthas the way it's meant to be had. I had ordered the achaari chicken paratha, and chicken keema along with rabri laddu ki lassi and orange kulfi. And every single item was mind blowing. The courtesy of the staff, the taste, the freshness, the ambience, the prices were all perfect. I would highly recommend people in the city to binge eat here if you are not calorie conscious. Because, the food is extremely rich, and that's the way it is supposed to be. A 6 star rating from my side. I am definitely going there again soon.

I was eager to visit this place due to its interesting name..well yes it turned out to be good...very significant location,just opposite just baked near deshopriyo park.
what struck me most was it's amazing decor...the sitting arrangement consisted of benches ..dhaba style...the walls were decorated with multiple colored parandis and glass bangles of vibrant colours really makes u feel as if u r in delhi.
coming to food we ordere
badami rabri lassi ..which was rich and tasted yummy
mango lassi..tasty
chilli garlic chicken paranthe and chicken cheese paranthe..both looked similar but stuffings made them differ....both were too good
keema rice was rice ina Tiffin box with a layer of keema gravy...didn't like much..
staff were polite..nice ambience.

Its an experience being there..!! Located just a few metres away from sarat bose rd after the rashbehari avenue crossing.. an aesthetically pleasurableüòçlittle place accomodating 35-40 people at a time is what u first see going there. The space utility hand-in-hand with the decor was really pleasing to me.
Now the food... We ordered cheese chicken parantha,chatpata paneer,gulab gulkhand lassi and masala thumbs up.
Cheese chicken parantha is heavenly üòçüòçüòç I would recommend everyone to try it.
Chatpata paneer parantha was good.
Paranthas was served with dahi and aachar. Dahi was very nice.
Lassi was really good..it was thick which i dont generally find out here. Could have been a little less sweet..this is personal.
And lastly masala thumbs up was ok. There was no fizz..i missed the fizz.
 Over and all...it is a really really good place which is also light on your pocket.
Will be visiting this place again. 0.5 is more improvement,for which i believe there's always a scope.

A full five star! 
The decor. 
The food. 
The staffs. 
It was a bit difficult for us to locate the joint. It is beautifully decorated! The pictures, the quotes, the dhaba feel! Everything is amazing. 
We ordered the Honey Chilli Chicken wings and Achari Lassun Chicken Wings, Chicken Cheese parantha, Badam Rabri Lassi and Chocolate Parantha! 
The Honey Chilli Wings tasted awesome. It came in a steel box which was attractive! 
The Achari Lassun Chicken Wings is not something we loved because we found it overwhelmingly salty! :( 
Chicken Cheese Parantha was the best parantha I have ever tasted! It had beautiful cheese oozing out when torn! (Yum!)
The Badam Rabri Lassi was plain sinful. It tasted so well that we wanted to lick the glass too! 
And saving the best for the last, Chocolate Parantha! 
What a creativity! Brownie stuffing with chocolate sauce and White chocolate chips! Wow. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Everyone Must must go!

Firstly it was difficult for us to locate, as the person over the phone confused us with the address but once we reached the destination we found out to be a familiar one. Ambiance is pretty nice with photographs and quotations hanging on the both sides of the wall. Creative indeed! Coming to food we had ordered green apple lassi which was really yummy and tasty, then we had phuch--izza which was unique and had that combined flavour of both phuchka and pizza. For desserts we tried red velvet paratha which was heavenly. Service was good and the members too.

This has been one of the best paranthas catering shop tried the Alu corn aa Hari paneer and the Dhaniya peyaaz paranthas try out the lassi there they have a whole lot of stuffs which are pure North Indian


Sitting in the shop you could actually taste or get a feel of actual parantha wali gali at Chandni Chowk Delhi. 
Definitely try the wide variety of lassi they have got lots in the menu but the USP is parathas 

The place is well decorated the  ambience is also good and it is in one of the bye lane next to Lake market SBI

A bit tough to find this place if you don't live nearby , but once you discover this little joint you will come back again very soon just for the sake of those PARANTHAS . üíü
The con is that the place is just too small . The seatings are not quite comfortable. By the way loved those funny quotes hanging on the walls ‚úî

We ordered the Achari Aloo Paratha which was very very flavorful . Very fitting and sumptuous .
Next we ordered the Classic Cheese Paratha and OMG . This was so brilliant just because of the amount of cheese in it . Loved it .

We ended our short stay at the place with the basket full of happiness - The Chocolate Avalanche . üòç

VFM : The prices are a bit high than what it should have been taking the place into consideration .

Loved it overall :)

It's a great place to satisfy your stomach. Not so pocket friendly but their finger licking stuffed parathas makes a great smile on your face. Special mention to their chocolate parathas, for the first time eaters, it's feel like heaven. Nice and simple decor justify its ambience.

Located near the Deshapriya Park Crossing,this is a small joint, with max. accommodation for just about 20-25 people at a time.
As the name suggests,they serve a variety of paranthas which of course, is the main attraction here !!
The ambience is decent,decor is pretty interesting but all of it is let down a bit simply due to it's small size.Service is pretty quick,the waiters are courteous except for that 1 person who talks pretty rudely & has a really harsh tone.
Now,coming to the really delicious food they serve. We took the following -

1)Chicken & Cheese Parantha - Was a delightful surprise.Served along with curd and pickle, they were literally finger-licking.Considerably filling, A MUST TRY !!
2)Mutton & Cheese Parantha - This was even better.Stuffed with mutton crumps & cheese, it was extremely filling and fantastic. You'll have to taste it to feel the true essence of it's beautiful taste on your taste buds.. DON'T MISS THIS !!

3)Motichoor Lassi - THE BEST LASSI Iv tasted so far in Kolkata.1 glass is good enough for 2 people,the motichoor inside this really well-made,accurately thick,superbly tasty modification of milk, is probably the best thing to have ever existed.Give it a try, you'll remember this one for a long, long time !! :D

**Missed out on the Chocolate Parantha this time, have heard a lot about it, will try it on my next visit**

All in all, a wonderful place for true food lovers, specially if you're a Punjabi like me, who craves Parantha !! A really nice experience, will definitely visit again !! :)

For everyone who craves for paranthas from Delhi's iconic 'Paranthewali Gali' this is surely the place to be. The interiors has a Desi essence and typical roadside Dhaba ambience. Paranthas starting from ‚Çπ 59 has a range of choices. My personal favorites are 'Corn aloo' and 'Achari Chicken'. However Rajma Chawal in a bowl gives you enough calories for a couple of days ;). Service is sublime. The interesting manner of presenting the bill and added perks with it steals the day. 
Food - 4.8 /5
Service - 4.8/5
Interiors - 5.0/5

The very name of this joint brings back to your mind the phenomenal flavours of 'Delhi ki paranthe-wale galli' and this place actually will not disappoint you at all!! üòç
A good venture by 'bon appetite'... paranthe wali Galli is absolutely unique in it's ambience, decor, staffs and definitely in its relishing flavours,üòçüòç though finding this place was a little tricky but all thanks to the Google map!ü§ì
The place is however not very spacious but the way it has been decorated and furnished is worth mentioning.ü§ì There are small benches and tables for the visitors with witty rhymes glued on the walls. The place is quite colourful and gives you the feel of a real dhaba! Intact they serve their 'paranthes' in steel plates and 'katauris' with a fork and a knife and the 'chawal' (rice) in steel Tiffin boxes. The drinks are served in fatty steel glasses.ü§ì The chicken wings and other side dishes are also served in a different steel box-- quite different from the stereotyped serving bowls.üòç
Coming to the food---- well it's delicacy lies entirely on the PARANTHEs and so we get 34-35 different lip smacking flavoures of it. The best according to me is definitely the Chicken Cheese Parantheüòç. It serves the paranthes with dahi and 'pyaz-wala-pickle'(very tasty), and a single paratha actually will make you quite full ü§ìü§ì. We also tried Dhaniya mirch chicken, garlic Chicken, achaari aloo, classic alu paranthes and the best part is you will get the taste of the stuffings in it's every nibbleüòç. The chawals are good too specially the Chicken chawal and keema chawalü§ì. The honey chilly chicken wings were delicious too. Regarding the LASSIs, the strawberry lassi was extraordinarily tasty with balanced amount of all the flavoures. üòçüòç

The place do have quite a reasonable price list and this 'GALLI' will completely satiates your 'PARANTHE WALE HUNGER'üòúüòú. Another quite a distinct feature of this joint is the way they present you theire bills--- in a colourful kettle along with a small bowl full of candies!üòçüòç A must try for all the foodies out there and I can give an assurance that you will come out of this place being extremely satisfied and pleased vowing to visit it again and again!!üòçüòçüòç

Good food but bad experience. Went with my sister for a paranthe sharanthe experience but was very upset with the service. The staffs were not friendly and very delayed service. Ordered chicken cheese parantha and classic cheese parantha and both were delicious. On the side we had motichoor lassi and chachh lassi which tasted‚Äã good on their own way.
They actually gave us two classic cheese parantha and after complaining they took the half eaten parantha and gave us a chicken cheese parantha for which they didn't charged and this won my heart. And finally the chocolate parantha which we ordered but had to pack it since we were full.
Overall a bad experience with the staffs and bad service. They didn't even gave the toffee in the end which I was looking forward to. Low pocket pinch. One parantha is good for one person. Good decorations with funky writings and picture wall.
Would visit again to try the food and hope for a good and friendly service.

The location of this place is not at all easy to locate. I went there with two of my friends. We really had a very bad time looking for it. But once we finally reached we were really surprised. This tiny place is very well decorated, you get that typical Punjabi feel once you enter. It has approx 8-9 tables which can accommodate around 20-25 people.

As the name tells you they serve you various varieties of Parathas. We ordered Cheese Chicken Paratha, Dhania Mirch Chicken Paratha, Mutton Paratha, Keema Rice and Chhash Lassi. All the parathas were tasty specially the Cheese Chicken one. They serve you the parathas with Dahi and Onion achar which is something I really liked. I will surely recommend the Cheese Chicken paratha . Keema Rice was normal. The quantity was good but it tasted pretty basic just like typical Mangsho Bhaat. Lassi was very very tasty.

All in all a good experience. Good food, good staff and good decor. Thumbs up to this place!

Very small outlet and an offbeat venue. Not that easy to locate but yes, its worth my time trying to find its location. Thank you for the wonderful meal I had. Awesome chicken cheese paranthe and the pickled onion with complimentary curd thali. No need of any side dish but we tried paneer bhurji which was okay. The orange stuffed with kulfi was real good man! Would definitely visit again for other paranthes. üòäüòä

We had mixed experience in our first visit here. What we liked - chicken cheese paratha, we liked most -  chocolate paratha, a very popular and signature dish here, one must try it. What we didn't like much - achari paneer paratha and so many flies all around (seems those are also fond of their chocolate paratha). Also its a small restaurant, the smell from kitchen sometimes bring tears in eyes, not sure about the proper ventillation of this property.

It's been in my bucket list for so long and finally made it yesterday. First entering the restaurant the quircky decor just changed my mood instantly. It made the perfect ambience of dhaba with all those wall hangings with catchy hindi quotes, colourful windows and benches, bangles, even a Kadhai has been used to make the basin here! It can accomodate approx 20-25 people at a time. Mainly crowded with youngsters they have a good variety of Parathas along with many kind of yummy Lassi, chawal and a fee starters and of course being an initiative of Bon Appetit some delicious deserts. We had Cheese Chicken Paratha, Dhania Chicken Paratha and Achari Chicken Paratha. All of them were very good stuffed with ample amount of chicken and served with curd and achar. But the best among all was Chicken Cheese Paratha. For the desert we had Classic Avalanche which is a famous one from Bon and ofcourse it was great! Staffs are courteous but not much attentive. Overall it was a great experience!

I went here with one of my friends post watching a film at cinepolis .
Google Maps made it easy to locate the place.
We ordered :
Aloo Parantha
Cheese Aloo Parantha
Chicken Achari lasuni Keema
Service was moderate.Food was pretty good and the decor is beautiful.
The Paranthas are yummy and the side dish though a bit wattery is yum.
The waiter wasn't too courteous and hence disappointment 1 
Secondly , the entire place became very very smoky and all the customers eyes started burning and it was a very bad experience .
Moreover the waiter put room freshner to get rid of smoke :(
The food was beautiful but the entire experience was brought down due to not so good atmosphere .

As the name suggest this eatery has various kind of paranthes in the menu list.i had achari chicken paranthe & the chicken cheese paranthe.both the item   had a bowl of curd  as a compliment.the paranthes were stuffed with chicken.i had motichur lassi along with the paranthes.it was magnificent.the glass full of lassi with added motichur.
The eatery has an adequate space for sitting.pricing was appropiate.

Now this was unplanned.. But it was a dear friend's birthday and he suggested this place and there we were..
A small and cosy place, it really delighted me at the first sight. A rainy day as it was, the place was to us only (which I kind of always like). So there was the menu and the five hungry us. Well the order is a long one so I'm writing as a list:

1.Cheese Aloo parantha: Unnecessary to mention being a Bengali Aloo is a quintessential part of my everyday diet, and this parantha justified every bit of my "potato" and "cheese" love.
2. Masala Chicken parantha: A tad bit spicy this one was really a treat to the taste buds. We even wanted to order a second one but our tummies had quit by then.
3. Cheese Chicken parantha: My favourite. The cheese totally complemented the chicken. And the warm parantha just stole my heart.
4. Tangy Thai Corn parantha: Well this one was a suggestion from the staff. Although I didn't quite like the flavours but it seemed a unique option for the vegetarians.
5. Mutton Cheese parantha: This was another delicacy. I mean mutton with cheese is not something you have everyday. But it was every bit tasty.
6. Pork Choy and Garlic parantha: Yes I like garlic. No I didn't like Pork Choy. Overall the combination could not win my heart.
7. Paneer Bhurji: A suggested side dish. It definitely was a good partner to the paranthas.
8. Chettinad Chicken Wings: Not something as the expectation. Blant but definitely a healthy choice. Also we thought it was undercooked as there was a smell of raw meat.
9. Keema with Chawal: A rice based dish with a chicken Keema gravy served on top. It was nice but it was just nice. Nothing extraordinary.
10. Gulab Gulkand Lassi: A must try for Lassi lovers. Take a sip and you will know.
11. Motichur Lassi: A wrong choice by me. Motichur good, Lassi good but motichur Lassi not very good.
12. Mirch Aloo parantha: Although nearly full to the brim, this somehow won our hearts in unison. I suggest please do try.
13. Classic Avalanche: Dessert lovers and non-dessert budget maker lovers please have it. The dessert was and always is my choice and mostly just for me. But this first time I got to taste it last as the four almost forgot my existence and took the liberty to indulge themselves in it completely and I was warned to snatch my "right to dessert" or else I would be at a loss.

So overall a must go to place for parantha as well as non-parantha lovers. Thanks Pintu for an awesome evening.

Location- Deshapriyo Park, move to Sarat Bose Road towards lake, 1st you will get Monalisa Guest house and then the next left turn of Hotel Victrece. Go straight for 50 mtrs and Voila... on the right haned side. Please dont expenct to be a 3 star category restaurant. its a well planned, well conceptualized joint. Parking on the road side only.
Inside its very compact, Those who love to try and Hop around different cuisine and outlets, will never mind. 
Interior =¬† very well decorated and improvised
ambience = its a different flavour , so please forget the ambience, adore the Concept of the restaurant.
food = 5/5, I am shocked how they can prepare and serve the paranthas so fast.
Service¬† =¬† VERY FAST.
Pocket Pinch =¬† much reasonable.
We have tried nearly 6 types of parathas and all are 10/10. And on top of that the Lassis.. yammmm.
i am not putting any picutres as there are many in the Zomato. but Must recommend that if you want to try wide range of parathas, then this is the place for you. Most important, every item of the menu is available.¬† The table, chairs, basin, wall hanging are beautifully conceptualized. 
And to mention its my 1st GST bill in any restaurant, and very happy to pay the same. I am not giving 5/5 as there is always a chance to improve. 
Thankyou Team Paranthey Wali Galli.

I went here with two of my friends..
As it was not on the main road, I called on the number given on Zomato, the staff came out to see us.. üòÅ
When we went, there were no other customers, it was a weekday evening üòã
We ordered the following :
 - Cheese garlic paratha : it was really tasty. We loved it.
 - Chocolate paratha : Unexpectedly, the paratha was really great.. The expectations were high with the paratha, but as all the chcolaty stuff didn't turn out to be tasty, we were not sure about this ! But, the chocolate paratha was really yuuumm üòç .. Filled with chocolate stuffing with chocolate chips and chocolate sauce on the top.. we liked it !

The ambience is not so much wow here..

Will definitely visit to try other parathas too..

Had cheese mushroom and cheese garlic paratha here today alongwith badam rabdi lassi and puchkizza.
Paranthas were awesome, but the lassi was too sweet for me.
The restaurant was very small, people going with a big group can face problems cause of lack of space, but the biggest turn of was that there was a lot of flies, flying around the table, who wants to eat their food with flies flying around. Guys you must have pest control!
Full marks for creativity.

My experience of visiting this place was one that of pleasant surprise from the very start. The interior is simple yet themed to capture bits and pieces of the famed Parantha Wali Gali of Delhi; the wash basin is made out of a huge Kadai, the ceiling lights are encased in truck headlights, catchy messages in colourful fonts, you get the gist. Paranthe Wali Gali, shows how much fun can be put inside a simple unassuming Parantha.

The first one I laid my hands on was the Cheese Chicken parantha. Shredded chicken and cheese stuffed filling enhanced the taste of Parantha unbelievably. The onion pickle was also a treat for the tastebuds. By the time I was halfway through enjoying this cheesey delight, the Dhaniya chicken Parantha was served. Shredded chicken mixed in spicey masala was nothing less than heaven.

We also ordered a bowl of Keemah Chawal (with white rice), a bowl half filled with rice and the remaining with Keemah gravy. It was a warm and tasty tummy filler. In lassi, we ordered Gulabi Gulkand, basically lassi with strawberry-rose water flavor. Compared to the rest of the ordered items, it was plain and simple

So what is the single most definitive factor that ensures a restaurant deserves a perfect 5* ??? There is no right answer, it depends on the tastebuds of the foodie. To me, these simple paranthas with lovely filling will always be sure-shot 5*. The staff were courteous enough and there was nothing to complain at all.

Overall I would love to give ths place a perfect 5*, but I will keep back a 0.5 till my next visit. There were 2-3 flies wheezing around and disturbing, the staff were trying to get rid of em using electrical swatters, if those can be dealt its a full on 5* hands down.

Veri unique restaurant. Small but very well decorated. Ambience is well according to the theme. They dont have a much variety in menu but whatever they serve is finger licking. The paranthes are just mind blowingly awesome. The service is also good and didnt take much time to deliver. And the rates in which they serve is unbelievably cheap. So if you are a foodie you must be here atleast once. You might not be a fan of parantha but you will definitely love the food here

Went there last month with a friend..the place is tucked behind one of those lanes behind the prominently landmarked sweet shop of Jugal's in Deshopriyo Park..

The place is quite small but adequately yet subtlely decorated with benches and tables giving a desi touch...taking a seat for two we asked the executive out there to suggest a parantha for us as we had been visiting the place for the very first time...a glass of water each almost immediately reached our table even before we asked for...really appreciate this gesture as it scorching hot outside on a June afternoon... finally ordered a Paneer Parantha and a Ginger-garlic Parantha...

Both the paranthas were served with a small bowl of dahi and a mixed pickle comprising of onion on a steel dish...

Simply loved savouring both the paranthas served hot...it was soo soft with the right blend of spices stuffed within...yum it was!

The food was quite filling..pocket pinch slightly high but quality was commendable..service was prompt..

My friend also parceled a Paneer Parantha for her mother which was impressively packed..At the end our bill came inside a pretty kettle with an earthen bowl full of those black jelly candies that instantly transferred our minds back to our childhood days...simply amazing!

Overall thumbs up! Eagerly waiting for my next visit to try more..

Just amazing.  Very pocket friendly and it's simplicity at its best.  Just do not forget to order garlic cheese parantha and the Gulabi Gulkand Lassi. Mind blowing.  It's very close to the deshapriya crossing.  Just the lane after the saibaba Mandir lane,  when you walk towards the lake gardens flyover from deshapriya park

Ok to start with the parathas are yummy. 
Went there recently and tried the Thai corn paratha, the achari paratha and cheese garlic. 
To start with the Thai corn paratha was amazing. The paratha was spicy and served with onions and curd. The paratha was well stuffed with corn n every bite you took, you could only end up appreciating the perfect mix of all the ingredients in this dish. 
Next up was achari paratha, again it was true to its name and the paratha had mirchi ka achar in it which gave it the achari flavour. A bit spicy but i would put it in the list of must haves. 
The last one was cheese and garlic paratha. The combination didn't go well with me but the taste was again true to its name. I felt there was less of cheese and more of garlic in it which gave it a not so good taste. 
I also tried the rajma chawal and channa chawal. Both these dishes will remind you of the good old days when your mom use to cook these delicious dishes and all you did was gorge into it. They serve it in a traditional tiffin and both the rice and the chaana/Rajma were well cooked and adequately spicy. Personally I have never had Rajma chawal in a restaurant but I loved my first experience. Highly recommend dish. 
Once done with all this food one has to try to various lassi in the menu. I tried the gulabi gulkand lassi which was thick and had an amazing gulkand flavour to it making it a really refreshing drink. Lastly I tried the famous Pan Lassi. Again what I loved here was the thickness of the lassi and the amazing pan flavour that added such an amazing taste to the normal lassi one has. 
Guys I would highly recommend this place.

It is a beautiful place for having the favourite kind of your parantha. The place is beautifully decorated with funny quotes and photographs.The ambience is extremely good. The look was amazing.
Coming to the food. The paranthas were big and were served with curd and achar. We had ordered cheese chicken parantha which didn't taste that good and masala chicken parantha which had saved the day for us. It was very good to taste. Then we had ordered badam rabri lassi which was thick and so amazing.
The place is nice and hence do give it a visit.

Oh this place is a wonder to me!! Its a small one but the food here is amazing. Parathe wali Galli as the name suggests, they make awesome parathas. There are variety of parathas in the menu to choose from. 
They also have a list of different lassis which tastes really yumm! We ordered cheese mushroom paratha, badam n rabri lassi and puchkizza! Puckizza has a different feeling where u r eating golgappa /phucka with a taste of pizza toppings in it!! The ambience is nice with all the photographs hanging.. kind of desi ambience .To sum it all worth the money!

Interesting decor with many funny quotes on walls. Although I have been here only once I love this place already. Coming back soon.

Has been on the hit list for centuries I assume and the day finally came to visit this place! The one drawback is its small interiors , you can literally hear the conversations of people around you and it really gets unconventional at times! Now coming to food! We ordered their chocolate paratha and their badam rabri lassi! Lassi was too sweet for my sweet tooth but the paratha was really fresh out of the oven and it was awesome in one word! The service was quick and apt as well!

Paranthe Wali Gaali- the name is suggestive enough to imagine the decor and the food. And boy, do they not live up to the expectation. Retaining the flavour of a dhaba's interior but tweaking it to fit the urban crowd, the place has quirky quotes, photographs and a cauldron in the place of a basin. So, expect the unexpected as they say.

Coming to the food, I think PWG (excuse the abbreviation) serves one of the best chicken wings fusion ever. Comes in a tiffin box of Tin and the mustard twist is what makes it stand out. Cheese chicken paratha has become our staple diet, but do try out their achari chicken too! Last time we tried, it was brilliant. 

But their masterpiece is not limited to Chicken wings; rather, count lassi in its repertoire. They serve amazing mango lassi and a host of other Lassis and we cannot have enough of them. There's the usual chocolate avalanche which is terrific, but surely, not the showstopper like Lassi. 

During winter, Dim bhujji accompanies you for breakfast. An absolute delight, you will be left licking your hands. 

The staffs are brilliant, efficient and prompt. Three cheers for them for such service. We often forget giving them a nod. 

If you believe we are done with our visits, well, hold my crown! We're coming in a few days! 

Food-4.5 Service-5 Decor- 4.5
So, 4.5*3+5*2+4.5*1= 28
Divide by 6, you get 4.66, so rounding up to 4.5.

This place was in my bucket for sometimes now, so on this Friday evening we visited the place. At around 6 the place was not so full. Now the light focuses on the key items.

Ambience:- the place has a really good vibe of desi culture. In that small space they will give you the feeling of Delhi's Galli.

Food:- OMG! that's the best part of this place. We ordered mustard chili wings, garlic chicken parantha, cheese garlic parantha and topper of the show chocolate parantha. The chicken wings with the strong mustard kick was so unexpectable though it turned out superb, and those two paranthe were so much stuffed with chicken and cheese respectively which made our day and then the chocolate parantha which was stuffed with brownie and overflowing chocolate sauce on the top and choco chips...yummy!!

Interior:- That Galli Galli wali feeling. Their were benches instead of chairs, the walls were colourful with bright lights and lots of cool stuffs were used to decorate like the hand basin as kadai and belan as wall hanging.

This place is a complete mood changer from the westo indian fusion to total desi one. The staffs were really good, courteous. Expecting this place will see me again soon.

I have a special weakness for parathas sonce my early childhood. I remember savoring hot parathas with sugar as a kid. My first stuffed parantha experience was in Nainital. The generous stuffing of alu, gobi, methi within the soft layers of flour, served with hot pickle and curd is still remembered as a happy memory of the past.
I visited this place last week to revive my love for parathas.
Ambience and interior- The interior will surely give you the perfect desi vibe that you need while savoring the parathas. The colour blocked doors, street good pictures hanging on the walls, colorful wooden tables and chairs... all together creates a very cheerful ambience. The place is quite small. So a fully crowded place may become suffocating.
Service- The service is pretty fast. The waiters are very polite and will make you feel at home.
Food- we had 4 varieties of paratha- cheesy chicken, methi chicken, achari chicken and dhania chicken. There is generous stuffing and the parathas are warm and soft. One paratha is big enough for one person. The tastes are unique and you will definitely get the "ma ki haath ka khana" wala feel. They are served with dahi and pickled onion. Also it's a good idea to keep the fork and knife aside and feel the food with your bare hands 

We also had the aam raas and badam malai lassi. The second one was perfect. The mango one was too sweet and aartificial mango juice is used which I felt killed the taste.
Lastly we had the aachari lehsun chicken wings. The presentation in a steel tiffin box looked unique. The wings were soft, juicy and succulent. However it was a little too salty for my taste buds.

Overall it was a satisfying experience. I will go back for some classic parathas like the gobi and alu varieties. Will update then again

If you love Parathas, this is your paradise. With a very desi style decor, this place has a great variety of Parathas suitable for both veg / non-veg people. We orders chicken cheese Parathas, dhania chicken Paratha, masala thumbs up, chicken chettinand wings and also decided to try the chocolate avalanche.
The Parathas came with the usual onion pickle, & curd. I savoured every bite. There is nothing to say about Masala Thumbs up, the chettinand wings were okay-ish as I expected skinless chicken but the chocolate avalanche disappointed me as the chocolate sauce was not as much as that given in Bon appetit, also they gave strawberry sticks instead of chocolate..
.
Overall it lives up to its name. Will definitely visit again to try other Parathas.

All thanks to my buddy for else I wouldn't have visited this place anytime soon. One of it's kind this cute joint is solely offering parathas. Of all kinds. Yes you heard right, all kind of parathas!
Mostly veg parathas, ranging from classic aloo gobi to fusion parathas. I feel they could provide more sides to go along with their parathas, they do serve complementary curd and pickled onions alongside. Moving on, our order comprised of thai sweetcorn paratha, achari paneer, cheese garlic, cheese mushroom paratha. The decoration is extremely unique n quirky. Quite captures the mood of the present generation. Coming to the food, it was lip smackingly good. I had expected the parathas to be pretty thick given to my idea about the dhaba ka parathas. But these were soft and the filling was buttery and oh so delicious. We were all lost in our respective plates. And at last we wrapped it with a chocolate brownie dish which was absolutely heavenly. Pure bliss. Oh and it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket either. ‚ù§

This place reminds me of paranthe Wali Gali of Delhi where you get varieties of paranthas. This outlet is situated in desapriya park. We order puchkizza- 5 phuchkas stuffed with cheese and olives, very spicyy.chicken cheese parantha- chicken keema with cheese stuffed parantha. Anchari chicken paratha. All the parathas were served with curd and anchar. At last we ordered chocolate parantha which was stuffed with mashed chocolate brownie and chocochips and chocolate sauce on top. It was a heavenly delight. For drinks we ordered chacch Lassi and masala thums-up. A piece of Delhi in Kolkata to surprise you with varieties of paranthas

It is a good place for paratha lovers as u get various options for paratha. We had one chicken cheese parantha and one peanut butter chocofudge paratha as well as one mango lassi nd strawberry lassi. Lassi s were too good and quite filling. Now let's come to parathas. Chicken cheese paratha was good...peanut butter parantha was a new concept but one is enuf for 2 people as it is too sweet.Ambience wise it's normal and nice .

Never thought paranthe could be cooked in such various and delectable ways. We tried achari paneer parantha, cheese mushroom parantha, cheese garlic parantha, thai corn parantha and a classic avalanche for dessert. Each parantha was unique in its own way, as delicious as the other. The dessert was mind blowing. The paranthe are served with dahi and pickled onions. The staff is well mannered and attends you courteously . This place is a must visit absolutely. Well done guys. You deserve 5 points totally .

Today I went here with a friend for lunch. The ambience is fine. It's a small place. The inside was decorated with funny one-liners and pictures. It had 6 tables. 
We ordered Nawabi Parantha which was served with onion pickles and curd. The filling was of chicken, cashews, almonds and raisins. I love cashews and almonds so I liked it a lot. However my friend felt it was sweet-ish from the raisins. For dessert we ordered the popular Classic Avalanche. It sure tastes heavenly. It's basically cake topped with dense rich chocolate and choco chips along with molten ice cream and wafers, a bit different from brownie. It was fine but as it's summer the ice cream melted a bit too much and mixed with the molten chocolate at the end and that was kind of messy and disappointing. But it's a must try! 
At the end they serve kala toffees with the bill üòã 
Service is fine. Ambience is good though Punjabi music would have been perfect. :P

Another feather in the cap of Mr. Rahul Arora of Bon Appetit and Pranah fame, Paranthe Wali Galli is an unapologetically ode to the Dilli way of "dining-shining" with the hearty paranthes as their mainstay. Starting off with the ambience. The place is colourfully setup in the true-blue over-the-top bling of Delhi. Witty shayaris, colourful bangles and snapshots of what I presume to be Delhi (I hear these are personal snaps clicked by the owner himself!). The area is divided into two, one for seating smaller groups and the other for one large group. The menu boasts a whopping variety of Paranthes, right from traditional ones to funky fusion concepts (there is a chocolate parantha too! :P)

Coming to what we ordered and the experience:

Gondhoraj Lassi - The thick milky drink had a more than adequate amount of gondhoraj which gives it a very off-kilter bitter taste. Not something that will suit the palate of most. I liked it nonetheless for the innovation.

Puchkizza - The star of the show without a doubt. Aptly placed under the heading of golgappa "bombs" in the menu, this dish which is essentially a host of pizza toppings filled to the brim inside the puchka is an explosion of the various ingredients of a traditional pizza. You go from start to finish in your journey to eat a pizza in just a mouthful! A must-try.

Mozzarella Tomato Olive Parantha - Straight from the top of the "Swag Waale Paranthe" menu, this fusion parantha looks deceptively inviting to imagine. However, the flavours weren't as strong as I expected them to be. Coupled with dahi and aachaar though, the taste is enhanced considerably making it a enjoyable dish. Would like to try the other paranthas which I feel will be even better.

Rajama Chawal - Comfort food for most if not all, this delectable favourite was served in a "steel ka tiffin" with the generous amount of rice covered in the aromatic rajma. The dish was filling to say the least and the taste was almost exactly like that of home. A worthy option if having a hearty meal is what you're looking for.

To conclude, I don't really know how many trips will it take to truly try all the varieties of paranthas but a revisit is definitely something on the cards!

Well. This particular place was in my bookmark for a long time. I was eagerly waiting to visit this place hearing some good remarks from my fellow friends in zomato, so much that I literally dragged my boyfriend to come here while we were just casually roaming along the lake side. If you are not that much familier with the lanes and bylanes of Southern Avenue, it will take you some time to find this exact place. But once you are here, the surrounding and the ambience will definitely make you feel better specially the cool fusion art that is very unusual and photogenic at the same time. Now coming back to the most important part the food. We were a little tight on budget and at the same time not too much hungry, so ordered only 2 item's. 
1.The chicken cheese paratha 2. chocolate avalanche. While the paratha was served quickly it was also good it taste with sufficient amount of cheese and chicken inside. (4/5).
 2. Been a chocolate avalanche lover I am already aware of the taste of this particular one. The best one can ever get at such affordable price with perfect balance of brownie chocolate syrup and ice cream. (5/5). Only this time they served us this dish a little bit late after reminding them once about our order. Overall the experience was quite great, definitely recommended and am surely visiting back to try out their lassis üôÇüôÇüôÇüôÇ

Definitely a new concept. A huge variety of parathas available. Had the chicken cheese paratha on the recommendation of the staff - it was quite tasty and filling. The peanut butter and chocolate fudge paratha was a bit too much. Could not finish it as it was very heavy and sweet. The peanut butter could be served as a condiment on the side though. The lassis (Aam and strawberry) were good too. The ambience was good and price was affordable. Location is easy to find. However, the low rating goes because of two reasons - the glasses in which water was served were not clean. Also expectations were very high, owing to the fact that this is another of Rahul Arora's restaurants‚Äã, and I am already a huge fan of Pranah and Bon Appetit and this one did not quite live up to that! Good concept though. Would like to try the other parathas next time.

Yes, you heard it right 'Delhi Wala paranthe wali galli' is now in Kolkata serving people's appetit with delicious extravaganza paranthas. Couldnt have asked more from Mr Rahul Arora, his thoughtful idea of opening this small flavorsome food joint.
A cool place for hangouts, don't expect much from the decor. It's simple but the one liners hung on the wall will keep you busy.Google maps recommended to reach the location.

We ordered chicken wings in honey lemon, navaabi‚Äã chicken paratha(little sweet), chicken cheese paratha .To quench our thirst we had badam rabadi lassi, motichoor lassi. Just had a mouthwatering experience. Chocolate paratha was a perfect end to our meal.
Ps: be aware of the size of lassi's glass ;)

A perfect Penny pinch. All the 'paratha lovers' wanna try some different tasteful parathas do make a visit soon.Rahul Arora

A place dedicated to parathas! Only Rahul Arora can come up with such amazing ideas :D 
The decor is quirky and bright. There are frames capturing different basic spices and dishes and street views associated with the culinary scene of a dhaba. And they have a kadhai as a basin :D
The phuchk-izza is absolutely not worth the price. They serve 5 small phuchkas dressed with cheese, olives and paprika. 
But you should taste the paranthas! The chicken and cheese paratha was beautiful. It was loaded with shredded chicken and cheese and every bite would  enrich your taste buds. We packed home some dhaniya mirch chicken paratha and laddu ka paratha. Both were great too. I'll surely come back to try the others.

Delightful little joint near Desapriya Park, dedicated to Parathas, like the Banarasi or Lucknowi parathewale galis. 

It is decorated to resemble some roadside dhaba in North India, complete with wooden benches and long tables, coloured glass walls, wind chimes and plastic bangles and cloth dolls - the whole yard. The place is filles with a cheerful colourful light, and the colourful plastic glasses, steel plates and bowls and colourful painted kettles in which they bring the bill - really very sweet.

I did not know this belongs to the Bon Apetit franchise, but it is very evident, from the attention to detail in the decor, and the beautiful framed pictures of actual parathewali galis - the pictures of malai jalebi, lassi in clay glasses, basket chats and kesar chais make you wish you were transpored there.

Food was good. The Chhanch Lassi and Aam Lassi was thick and undiluted. We had three kinds of parathas - Gobhi Paratha for me, as I am not a massive fan of experimenting with Parathas; Achari Chicken Paratha and Chinese Bokchoi with Garlic Paratha for the hubby, for he experiments with literally everything. All parathas come with a lemon and onion pickle and curd, and the variety can leave you very confused. Aside from the chocolate paratha and nutella/choco fudge paratha in the desserts section, what caught my attention was the Red Velvet Cake paratha. Really? Will experiment with this next time, may be!

Must try joint!!

To reminisce over my past visit to the famous Paranthe wali gali in Chandni Chowk ( Delhi) which is a famous narrow lane selling parathe or Indian flatbread, we visited this cafe to try out their wide range of parathas.

The interior of this restaurant is very attractive. The bangles, parandas, posters and pictures of the original parathe wali gali, the seating arrangement adds to the desi factor and is quite impressive. But one thing I disliked about this place is the space issue. As this place is small, with increasing people, you can suffocate. The smoke coming out of the kitchen was burning my eyes and was a let down

Now coming to the food. We wanted to try out some different parathas so we settled for the fusion parathas.
We ordered
1) ROSEMARY AND LAMB PARATHA
2) HAWAIAN CHICKEN PARATHA
3) PESTO CHICKEN PARATHA
4) KEEMA CHAWAL( WITH WHITE RICE)
and for drinks we ordered
1) RABRI BADAM LASSI
2) CHHACHH LASSI
AND 3) AAM LASSI..

All the parathas came with dahi( curd) and aachar (pickle) and were stuffed with ingredients..
Didn't like the rosemary and lamb paratha that much
But loved the other two as they were stuffed with chicken, cheese and spices irrespective of the varient we took..

Well, we didnt like the keema chawal. Although it was served in a tiffin box giving a homely feel to it, but the dish was disappointing..
The amount of keema was less as compared to rice and was kinda okayish. Nothing special..

But we really liked the lassis. The lassis came in big glasses and were quite filling..
The pocket pinch for four people was around 900..
Overall, had a good experience and would recommend this restaurant to others.. Debarpan

Yes, you heard it right 'Delhi Wala paranthe wali galli' is now in Kolkata serving people's appetit with delicious extravaganza paranthas. Couldnt have asked more from Mr Rahul Arora, his thoughtful idea of opening this small flavorsome food joint.
A cool place for hangouts, don't expect much from the decor. It's simple but the one liners hung on the wall will keep you busy.Google maps recommended to reach the location.

We ordered chicken wings in honey lemon, navaabi‚Äã chicken paratha(little sweet), chicken cheese paratha .To quench our thirst we had badam rabadi lassi, motichoor lassi. Just had a mouthwatering experience. Chocolate paratha was a perfect end to our meal.
Ps: be aware of the size of lassi's glass ;)

A perfect Penny pinch. All the 'paratha lovers' wanna try some different tasteful parathas do make a visit soon.Rahul Arora

The place seemed shady but the food was great. I loved the concept of stuffed parathas and especial mention should be made for the cake stuffed paratha. I never thought that cake and paratha can go together but I was proved wrong. Price was okay considering the stuffing..

A place dedicated to parathas! Only Rahul Arora can come up with such amazing ideas :D 
The decor is quirky and bright. There are frames capturing different basic spices and dishes and street views associated with the culinary scene of a dhaba. And they have a kadhai as a basin :D
The phuchk-izza is absolutely not worth the price. They serve 5 small phuchkas dressed with cheese, olives and paprika. 
But you should taste the paranthas! The chicken and cheese paratha was beautiful. It was loaded with shredded chicken and cheese and every bite would  enrich your taste buds. We packed home some dhaniya mirch chicken paratha and laddu ka paratha. Both were great too. I'll surely come back to try the others.

Delightful little joint near Desapriya Park, dedicated to Parathas, like the Banarasi or Lucknowi parathewale galis. 

It is decorated to resemble some roadside dhaba in North India, complete with wooden benches and long tables, coloured glass walls, wind chimes and plastic bangles and cloth dolls - the whole yard. The place is filles with a cheerful colourful light, and the colourful plastic glasses, steel plates and bowls and colourful painted kettles in which they bring the bill - really very sweet.

I did not know this belongs to the Bon Apetit franchise, but it is very evident, from the attention to detail in the decor, and the beautiful framed pictures of actual parathewali galis - the pictures of malai jalebi, lassi in clay glasses, basket chats and kesar chais make you wish you were transpored there.

Food was good. The Chhanch Lassi and Aam Lassi was thick and undiluted. We had three kinds of parathas - Gobhi Paratha for me, as I am not a massive fan of experimenting with Parathas; Achari Chicken Paratha and Chinese Bokchoi with Garlic Paratha for the hubby, for he experiments with literally everything. All parathas come with a lemon and onion pickle and curd, and the variety can leave you very confused. Aside from the chocolate paratha and nutella/choco fudge paratha in the desserts section, what caught my attention was the Red Velvet Cake paratha. Really? Will experiment with this next time, may be!

Must try joint!!

Had been to this place with family... 7 of us and we actually ate a lot like a lot, comparatively the bill was nothing. ¬†The place is extremely pocket friendly. ¬†Very well made, colourful interiors, loved their 1 liners all over the joint, the seating system was nice as well. though it is too small for little kids, but they do enjoy their fair share. Coming to the food, the Cheese Chicken Paratha was the show stopper. Delicious, gooey, melt in mouth and had a good amount of filling. which we hardly get in most restaurants. The Tandoori Chicken wings was super, absolutely heavenly, the only thing was that there was more bone and less chicken.We loved their variety of tangy Golgappa bombs. they were a treat to the ¬†tastebuds, different and delicious. ¬†we had ordered, chicken cheese, paneer, aloo cheese, and 2-3 more veg parathas all were delicious and absolutely loved by each and every one..¬†Coming to the ambiance it is ok types. some of the glasses were stinking so they replaced it with plastic ones. apart from that we were seating in the closed corner of the joint next to the kitchen door so all the smoke from the kitchen was getting built up there, hence an exhaust fan installation is recommended. also given the summer season, most prefer ice and cold water which is not available. something to work on as well..¬†All over it was a lovely family luncheon and good experience. definitely visiting again. If one wants authentic and delicious paratha's that too in a huge list to choose from this is the place to go.

Best Paratha's in Kolkata! I had bookmarked this place long back. Finally, I had gone for lunch today with my family. We were a group of 8. Upon arrival we immediately got seated inside. 
The place is small but wonderfully done up, I loved the entire concept. The food coming in different steel containers just wow! 
We ordered the following items:-
. Chicken Cheese Paratha
. Panner Chatpatha Paratha
. Aloo Cheese Paratha
. Sathu Paratha 
. Masala Chicken Paratha 
. Aloo Paratha 
. Mozzarella Tomato Olive Paratha 
. Chicken Chawal
. Nacho's Bomb
. Dahi Puchka 
. Tandoori Chicken wings
. Badam Rabri Lassi
All of us loved the food. Our favourite was the Chicken Cheese Paratha, Sathu Paratha, Nacho's Bomb, Dahi Puchka and Chicken wings! 
The service was impeccable, the staff was prompt and extremely helpful. 
The only con was they don't serve mineral water and they didn't have any soft drinks available, nor did they have cold water. Which makes it very difficult during the summers. 
Otherwise a wonderful place to visit. Overall had an excellent lunch! Highly recommended. üòÇ

It's a small joint walking distance from deshapriya park. Easy to locate. 
Interior decor is minimal and colourful, reminds me of a dhaba with various filmy lines and framed photographs. Staffs are cooperative and well behaved. There is a Paratha festival going on right now.
Ordered Red Velvet and Cream Cheese Paratha with Happus aam Ka sherbat. The Paratha was blissfully delicious. Sherbet was okeyish. 
Looking forward to come here again.

We have been contemplating a visit for quite some time now. Finally we made it last night for dinner. The ambiance is super cool; loaded with quirks; and for people who like to click, there are loads of photo opps. Simple table and bench style seating makes you reminisce of college canteen. 

Now coming to food --
We tried --

Gandhoraj Lassi
Badam Lassi
Sattu paratha
Muli paratha
Dhania mirch chicken paratha
Red velvet paratha from their swag series. 

We enjoyed the food. All parathas came with dahi and pickled onions. 

Total pocket pinch was around ‚Çπ1200. 

Caution: The place closes early. Do take your seat by 8 pm for in all probability last order is at 9.

An essence of a good dhaba and the taste of typical dhaba foods along with various kinds of refreshing lassis are to be found altogether at Paranthe Wali Galli. Their unique and mindblowing decorating ideas would leave an individual awestruck. Are you a student? So pocket money has to be taken a great care of.Thus, Paranthe Wali Galli would be an ideal place. Different types of paranthas having amazingly amazing tastes would really make an individual's day great. Cheese Aloo Parantha and Strawberry Lassi should be tried to make one fall in love with them. Paranthe Wali Galli is a great place to hangout with friends or family and be left with adoring their creative decorations and the ambience inside. Paranthe Wali Galli is to be remembered for its mesmerising taste of the foods served too.

Just when we were bored with too much of Chinese & Biriyanis, we discovered this wonderful place near Deshapriyo Park.
Ambiance- Wonderfully done interiors with hatke ideas & items, filmy quotes & photographs. They use a kadai in place of the wash basin.. how cool is that!!
Coming to food, we stuffed ourselves with half a dozen varieties of paranthas-
Cheese chicken, Hawaiian chicken, Achari chicken, Baby corn with basil, Rosemary lamb & Pesto chicken parantha with complimentary dahi & achar!
Chettinaad chicken wings
& Lassi- badam rabri lassi, aam lassi & pineapple lassi.
Food was totally yum & we literally ate till we could no more!
To add to our delight, this place is even pocket friendly.
The only thing I missed is the yum looking brownie (I was helplessly too full) which I will definitely have on my next visit WHICH i am sure will be soon enough!!
Provided this cuisine suits your tastebuds, do give this place a visit guys.. it is totally worth it!
P.S- They serve kala khatta candies with the bill üòäüòã

Paranthewali galli is another gem by the creator of bon appetit.
Ambience is so much inspired from bollywood and vibrant that you will love being in that place altogether .
Coming to the food :
Chicken and cheese parantha : There is absolutely nothing to un-love about this . Chicken, cheese stuffed in your favorite parantha .
Classic aloo parantha : Its one of the most staple indian food, and its really good here.
Classic aloo and cheese parantha:  This combination also tastes great.
Mango lassi : Not too runny , not too thick , simply good stuff and blends well with your parantha.
Pocket pinch was around 500 for quite a lot of food.

I was so eager to visit this place for a long time. Finaly got to go. This place is locted  near deshapriya park...we didnot have problem to find out as we called them nd got a friendly response. The place is very small...a bit congested sitting arrangements  i found. It is nicely decorated. Looks attractive. I ordered Thai chilli corn parantha (spicy), chettinaad chicken wings, green mango lassi and classic avalanche. Food tastes really good specialy the parantha nd the avalanche was delicious. Serving was good. But there was managemnt problm which i didnt like. There was not a single chickn preparation parantha available when we ordered. There were plenty of things from the menu which was not available. The waiter was confused. It took a lot of time for every action to be executed from giving water to food till giving the bill. Staffs are less...the glass had a foul smell. But the staffs were polite. Food tasted nice. Pocket friendly for students. A good hang out joint.

Located in the bylanes of Jugals,opposite Deshapriya park its a small place.The interiors are decorated on one side with vibrant frames and on other side with shayeris.
Coming to the food we initially ordered chicken items, and coming to our dismay only to tge fact that those were no available.We ordered then the bombs which were literally golgappas and again the waiter said it was not available.Ordering items and being let down by the fact that was not available was a big big letdown.Anyway we finally ordered panner paratha and baby corn paratha and badam lassi along with chach lassi.
The parathas were stuffed well and tasted okayish.
Value for money was good..however the lack of professionalism of waiters was a let down.
Ps- One complaint only..there were no windows or exhaust to let go off the smoke which after a certain time became too bad.
Hoping for a better experience the next time!! Priyadarshini Bhattacharjee

The ambiance of this place has a distinct rajasthani and Gujarat feel to it. Situated in the street behind Lake Road ccd, this place is cozy and small yet it has a plethora of stuffed parathas to satisfy one's hunger. Apart from the many different types of delicious parathas, there are different types of Lassi as well. In the paratha festival that is going on, the star attraction is the red velvet paratha,which I will recommend to everyone going there.

There's this colleague I have who's from Delhi and the first time that I heard about our capital's Paranthe wali gali was from her ... she talks about that place becoming all dreamy eyed! Since I havent been to the original Paranthe wali gali I cant say what the food there is like, but I can vouch for our local Kolkata one for sure!
My friend and I had ordered for a Chicken Cheese Parantha, Rajma chawal and Pinneaple Lassi. The parantha was awesome .. with lots of cheese and chicken. I was initially sceptical about the cheese n parantha combination, but the chef gave me no reason to complain after having it.
The rajma chawal had a traditional touch to it since it was served in a tiffin box with loads of butter. The pinneaple lassi was absolutely delectable, serving as the perfect end to our meal. 
My Delhiite friend says that these people have done justice to the name which has actually become kind of a brand! I must say I loved the place too! More so because it isnt too heavy on the pockets.
Do go and check this place out guys .. the first of its kind in Kolkata.

The interiors are really nicely done, with brilliant frames on one side and shayeris bringing in a desi vibe on another wall. 
Coming to the food, this place is great bang for your buck. Tried their achari chicken paratha, green apple lassi, masala thumbs up, Chettinad chicken wings and chocolate avalanche. Needless to say, we were too stuffed to walk after that meal. 
The chicken wings were tender, juicy and brilliantly flavoured, slight sweet with the gravy just adding to the flavour. The pieces were large and filling. 
The paratha was obviously the main attraction here. Stuffed with chicken, tangy, and beautifully tender, it was everything you hoped it would be. We washed it down with the lassi and thumbs up. 
The dessert is the Bon Appetit classic, only bigger in portion. The brownie was even better than I remember. 
The only downside was the service. The waiters were impatient, and extremely casual in the way they went about their work. Really unprofessional and it did mar the experience to an extent. Otherwise this would have been a 5/5.

First experience in this new and innovative joint was great. Cheese chicken parantha was really different and worth a try. I found the lassi specially badam rabdi lassi was best among the lot. The Lassi was so thick and creamy that it cam claim to be the best lassi in Kolkata. Nice and innovative interior and courteous staff made the whole experience really wonderful.

Located near Deshapriya Park, this joint has changed concept of 'Paranthas' in kolkata.
The place is small but very colourful with green and yellow benches and wall art. The place has a 'Dhaba' feel.
They serve paranthas with curd and pickle.
We ordered Dhania Mirch Chicken Parantha, Cheese Chicken Parantha, Motichoor Lassi and Aam Lassi.
Both the paranthas were amazing. Cooked with less oil, not at all greasy. Loved the motichoor lassi, aam lassi was also good.
Overall the food was really good. Will visit again soon :)

This place is sheer love. Being an ardent lover of parathas, this place is definitely heaven for me. Came here on May Day with my friend at evening and found this place empty. You may find it difficult if you are coming from golpark-southern avenue, however Google map is extremely helpful in finding the place. If you are coming from Lake View Road, it's easier to find this restaurant. Coming to the decor, it's all colourful. Starting from the pretty quirky entrance door to the various photoframes on the wall and the churas and jhumkas used as decorative materials will light up your mood, I assure. Now coming to the main part that is food, anyone who is not even a lover of NorthIndian cuisine will gorge on these delicious parathas. We ordered a chilli garlic chicken parantha and cheese chicken parantha, and rabri lassi, and needless to say, we were not at all disappointed. I would recommend everyone to try their badam rabri lassi. Extremely happy after visiting this place. Happy dining üòä

And it would be needless to mention the amazing and unique lines creating an ambiance, one of a kind!!

Will definitely look forward for a Lassi here on oure next visit!!¬†

And atlast a tick mark to a place in the wish list.
'Paranthe wali galli'

Took only 3 dishes:
Dhaniya mirch chicken (as chicken is must for non-veg like us), Cajun spiced paneer parantha (as something have to be there from the 'swag waale parantha), and khoya gulkand parantha(as misti mukh necessary after a nice dinner)
All of them were just too good.. chicken parntha is soo good and just perfectly spiced.. paneer one is well stuffed and very soft too.
But have to mention about khoya gulkand parantha. Oh my god!! Still can feel that taste in my mouth! MUST MUST MUST TRY...

Some words about the ambiance is soo good. And the way of presentation unique!!!  
Overall a must try restaurant...

P.S : have a look at those lines in the wall! It will made your day for sure! XD XD XD

Visited this food outlet today with my friends. First of all, the location is quite fishy and difficult to find out. Better call them up and take proper directions. Coming to the ambience, its just WOW! The decor, servings, the kettle (u need to visit the place to understand what I mean) are superb! Had gulabi gulkand lassi, aam lassi, cheese aloo paratha, chicken cheese paratha, dhania chicken paratha, achari chicken paratha and mustard chilli chicken wings. Each and every dish was worth ordering. Thanks to the staff for giving wonderful suggestions. Would definitely visit this place again and again!!!!

My first visit to this place. Suggested and acompanied by friend and fellow foodie Luna. The Classic Aloo Paranthe is perfect. Am even packing  one for home. The chaas is slightly unusual....it's thicker than usual and the fresh mint gives it a twist. The dhania Pyaz paranthe is spicy and is quite a  pleasant departure from the regular paranthe stuffing. The lunch ended with Motichoor Lassi- something unheard. A delightfully smooth lassi with a generous amount of motichoor that creates magic on the buds. Take your time to relish this interesting concoction. Folks, do drop in to this place. Highly recommended. The service is quick- kitchen to table is 10-12 minutes. Kudos to Mr. Rahul Arora and his team of wonderful staff.

Lassi yes and the mango lassi for sure! The Interior and the ambience is absolutely brilliant so as the staffs. The ecstatic wall with street photographs and sitting beside it having pure cheese or aloo parathas could be a brilliant experience with your loved ones.
The food is GOOD. Its pocket friendly so you can easily go there with your friends to chill over some good food and conversations.
And this place compels you to visit again and again!

Had been waiting like forever to visit this new place which is a unit of my all time favourite cafe,Bon Appetit.Finally, I got the chance yesterday !!

Located in desapriya park,it is 5 min away from Priya Cinema Hall.The place is small but cozy and cutely decorated.You will get a punjabi dhaba feeling once you go past the entrance. The ambience pretty much stole our heart.

Coming to the food,we ordered :

‚ñ™ Chicken Cheese Paratha - Filled with chicken and ample amount of cheese, the paratha is amazing.Highly recommended !!

‚ñ™ Dhaniya Mirch Chicken Paratha - This is also amazing.The paratha stufffing is a spicy one,but with the exact amount of spice to satisfy our tongue.

‚ñ™ Badam Rabri Lassi - The drink was really good.It is quite heavy,so one glass is enough for two.Though I personally felt it was a bit too sweet.Could have been better.

‚ñ™ Chocolate Paratha - This is heaven. The paratha is topped with chocolate brownie and choco chips.A unique dessert and it really is mouth watering and hopelessly fantastic.

Service was good and fast enough.I only have one complaint about this place, there was a big fly which was sitting on our glass of lassi.Flies are really unhygienic,so I hope they would do something about it.

Apart from that,it was a truely worthy visit.And the pocket pinch is also on the lower side. ‚ù§

Wanted to visit this place for so long and today I finally got the chance. Went there with few of my friends and the experience was one of the worst. It's been long since I've added a descriptive review on Zomato because all of my experiences have been good. I have a lot of complaints.

Firstly,this place is extremely suffocating. It doesn't appear in the photos, but it's actually very small. The ceiling is low as well. Seating is not that comfortable. Customers from a table at one corner of the restaurant were laughing & clapping and the whole place was echoing with that noise.

Secondly, ventilation is a problem. The smoke from the kitchen was making our eyes burn. Since there is a small window through which the food is passed from the kitchen, the smoke was easily passing through that window.

Thirdly, Pathetic Service. Jhuma was managing our table and she was doing a pathetic job. It's not that the restaurant was over crowded or something like that. When we entered, we were the only customers. After that one or two tables filled up. But that's no excuse anyway. We kept on asking for disposable cups, she kept bringing us glasses of water. After a couple of times, she served us with a frown on her face. However, good thing is the kitchen was pushing out food at a very nice pace.

Fourthly,the Food. Yes the most important part. The food is extremely over hyped. There's nothing special that'll blow you away. We ordered :

*Strawberry lassi
*Motichur lassi
*Paan lassi

The strawberry lassi was the decent one of the lot. The motichur lassi tasted like a mixture of curd and laddoo. Didn't blend well at all. The paan lassi tasted exactly like meetha paan and that's why didn't go well with the food.

*Achari Aloo paratha
*Achari chicken paratha
*Classic Aloo paratha
*Classic gobi paratha

Both the achari Parathas were not achari at all. Lacked in flavour. The Aloo paratha was decent. The potato filling tatsed of south Indian spices.

The GOBI PARATHA was too bad to eat. It was unbelievably tasteless. No taste of gobi whatsoever.

Each paratha was served with curd and a pickle.

*Honey chilli Chicken wings : the chicken skin was not cripsy and absolutely soggy. If you're serving chicken wings with skin, don't serve soggy skin. Okay? The sauce was overtly sweet.There wasnt even a slight hint of chilli. It tasted like chicken tossed in our homemade Bengali sweet tomato chutney. The chicken was cooked nicely and served hot, though.

Lastly, I didn't get to try the puchkizza or any of their cheese parathas. Guess why? Because apparently cheese was not available. Happens, right? But then we overheard a different waiter taking orders of cheese parathas from another table. When we asked him, he said cheese was just brought in. Jhuma didn't feel the need to come back and inform us that cheese was back in stock. And in a place like this where crappy parathas are served, better serve cheese parathas. Because cheese anyway makes everything taste good.

Our bill came to a total of 850. The best thing about our meal was the old school candies they give complementary with the bill. This might have been a bad day in office for them, but with so many new and cool places opening up in this city, I Don't think I'll ever go back.

This restaurant is located in the lanes of Deshapriya Park near Lake Terrace. It's a small restaurant designed in such a way which takes you to the streets of Punjab but with a twist. It's pretty colourful and soothing from outside but it does have space issues.
Now, coming to the main part, the menu seems interesting but the food will disappoint you big time. Initially we ordered cheese paratha but their cheese was not in stock so we had to order aloo paratha, achari chicken paratha, Gobi paratha and achari aloo paratha. Not being able to serve something that a customer wishes for is a big disappointment. Moreover, the Gobi paratha tasted horrible with the gobis, uncooked. The achari chicken paratha and the aloo paratha were somewhat edible. 
The honey chicken wings were too sweet with excessive amount of honey but the chicken tasted good.  We also ordered pan and strawberry lassi- strawberry lassi was fine but I didn't quite like the pan lassi. 
One lady namer Jhuma was at our service but her performance needs improvement. The price is over the top and food is not worth the price.
My overall experience was bitter and I would like to rate the following -
Ambience- 3.5
Service- 2
Food-2
Price- 1.5
Presentation- 2.5
I would consider it a bad choice on my part to have chosen this restaurant.

Im not gonna visit 2nd time... Food's quantity is quite small respective of its price... We had chicken masala paratha, chicken cheese paratha, classic aloo paratha, chicken rice and keema rice 
I would recommend not to order any rice item... If u really wanna have something try out their parathas...
One more thing, their waiters need to maintain hygiene...don't wanna be rude but they stink...üò∞üò®üòß

A quaint little place nestled in the vicinity of Deshapriya Park. This place can easily be referred as a hidden gem for parantha lovers. Simple, desi decor , vibrant paintings and awesome paranthas! The chocolate parantha ¬†is to die for! Full marks to the innovator of this yummy dish. The ingredients used in each of the parantha is carefully thought of and cleverly blended to add a twist to your palate. Aam lassi was delicious. The menu is fascinating. The only recommendation, however, would be to keep multiple credit card machines. For plastic money lovers who also tend to order and eat more, that's a feasible option. Will be good if the timings could be extended a bit. Will recommend to family, friends and colleagues.

The food, ambience, staff service everything is excellent. Barring the space problem, the food is typically of North Indian top notch standard. The parathas are extremely delectable,  the pineapple and badam rabdi lassi is cool and refreshing. If u miss being at Delhi's original paratha galli, this place can partly satisfy the craving soul in u. Above all, the prices are superbly pocket friendly. Drop in ASAP.

This place is in road just opposite to Samsung Galaxy centre or just baked near desopriyo park. It is a small joint with cozy ambience. The decor is prettily done with vibrant colors. On our visit this afternoon my friends and I spent fun time there.
To comment on food that we ordered
Chicken cheese paratha was cheesy and tasty.
Chilli garlic chicken paratha also tasted good. The parathas look exactly the same when served but the stuffing makes all the difference.
Keema rice was disappointing. It was some plain rice with a layer of keema gravy on it.
Aam lassi was great and the badami rabri lassi was quite filing while masala thums up tasted as usual.
The staff was poliete and helpful.
It is a pocket friendly eating place.

Dragged my parents there after reading the superb reviews on zomato! I really wanted to check out the Desi Pizzeria.. ¬†What stroke me first was their innovative decor. It was inspired by truck art. Parandas, bangles , rolling pins are the decorative items completed by cheesy one liners. ;) ¬†All was done in a small garage. Impressive indeed.¬†
Coming to the food, we orderded, DHANIYA MIRCH CHICKEN, ACHARI CHICKEN, CHICKEN CHEESE and CHOCOLATE PARANTHA!¬†
THE CHICKEN CHEESE PARANTHA was a good order. It was stuffed with ample chicken and cheese. It was kind of dry, and that added to the texture. Enjoyable one.
DHANIYA MIRCH CHICKEN PARANTHA was extremely flavourful. The dhaniya mirchi taste really came through, and you could taste bites of onion, which enhances the texture. One thing I must point out, there was ample amount of chicken in it.
ACHARI CHICKEN PARANTHA was the typical tangy achari taste. But this one wasn't very filling. It really for the people who enjoy the tangy acidic taste.
CHOCOLATE PARANTHA was a thin pastry filled with chocolate fudge covered in chocolate sauce and nuts. This dish was outstanding ! It was decadent yet very desi. You just cannot miss out on this one.¬†
The staff was very courteous and the service was quite fast.Overall this desi place deserves a visit.
#ThumbsUp #WillVisitAgain.

A re-creation of the legendary paranthe wali galli of Delhi, this cosy little place is sure to satiate your sudden dhaba food cravings. Blessed with a courteous and homely staff, it specialises in paranthas of all kinds, from aloo to chicken and cheese to chocolate. Also, this place serves some of the best lassis one can ever have - they are thick and creamy, and a glass would probably suffice for a breakfast for one. The interiors have been put up with a lot of care, with photographs and colourful boards carrying quirky one-liners. The beautiful kettle in which the bill is given as well as the toffees that accompany it, demand special mention. Prices here are extremely reasonable, and one can satisfy one's tummy without giving the purse a headache.

Finally a trip to the second outlet of the Bon appetit venture. Poila boisakh marks the beginning of the Bengali new yr so we wanted to eat out at some place with a traditional touch yet with a modern finesse and Parathe Wali Galli seemed to b the exact place we wanted. We ordered Phuck-izza and one Dhaniya mirch chicken paratha to start with. The taste was so overwhelming we wanted another round of non veg parathas and ordered Garlic chicken paratha along with one Badam rabri lassi and one motichoor lassi. The lassis were okayish. One lassi would suffice for two ppl as it's quite heavy. But Sadly both lassis were almost the same, which I felt the staffs should have informed because I clearly stated that we would like something different. Nevertheless non veg parathas were yum to say the least and served with achar and yogurt exactly in north indian style. Food is served in steel plates which gives the typical retro feeling and benches in place of chairs completes the feeling of dhaba. I didnt like the Phuck-izza. Somehow the combination of pizza and fuchka didn't go well. Lastly Chocolate paratha. It came with molten chocolate over the paratha with a topping of white chocolate and filling of brownie. Mostly a dessert than a food item and generously stuffed this is going to blow u away. A word of caution - If you r planning to have this cut down on that lassis or it would be a difficult task managing both due to the overpowering sweet taste. Overall I found the place to be overpriced. A big thumbs up for the ambiance though! The quirky kadhai as wash basin, brightly done interiors and cute way of presenting the bill in a kettle are little gestures sure to bring a smile on your face.

Another gem of a place from Rahul Arora.M quite frequent out here.The decor is quirky with red tables and green benches to sit.Coming to the food cheese garlic paratha,achari alu,achari chicken,chilli garlic chicken ,anda pocket,cheese aloo,you name it i loved it.But my heart goes to the chocolate paratha-with chocolate sponge in the centre topped with chocolate sauce and pearls of white and dark chocolate chips.A must have out here. The lassis are great too.A glass can fill your tummy well.Do visit.The bill comes in a kettle and what more the meal ends with our good old jhaal lozenge or komlalebu lozenge üòä.

A bit tough to find this place if you don't live nearby...but once you discover this place you won't forget it again...
Had the achaari aloo paratha which was very fitting and sumptuous...
Followed by 
The Cheese Classic Parantha and OH MY GOD.! üòç , This was so yummy and finger licking....
We ended our short meal with the basket full of happiness - " The Chocolate Avalanche " üòç‚ù§

The prices according to me is just a notch high than it should have been . Expecting the management to launch some new combos too ..

Will visit very soon again..!!

Paranthe Wali Gali is the latest offering by chef Rahul Arora, who owns Bon Appetite and Cafe Pranah. The new food joint is located at Lake Terrace. The place brings you the flavors of old Delhi street food in your very own City of Joy. The chef, however, terms it his own ‚Äúghar ka khana.‚Äù
Visited this place on multiple occasions since its inception last year. The menu boasts of interesting and innovative paratha combinations and out-of-the-box beverages.
The lassis are the big highlight of the place and are better than the hot drinks served, which includes Tulsi Wali Chai and Hajmola Lemon Tea. The best of all were the Motichoor Lassi and Badam Rabri Lassi, the flavor of which still lingers on my taste buds.

¬†Coming to the Parathas, they will definitely remind you of a proper Punjabi household. The ideas behind the combinations stand out. Tried out the Chicken Cheese paratha, which is my favorite.
The Chicken Wings is one of the best I have had in a long time. They come in different flavors and I loved the Honey Chili. This is a must try
While the name may give a feeling that this place only serves paratha that is definitely not the case. The place also impresses with its array of North Indian dishes, including Kadhi Chawal, Anda Pocket and Keema Chawal.
In desserts, the must tries are the Chocolate Paratha and the Khoya Gulkand Paratha.
A dedicated place for parathas, especially a range of non-veg ones, is what Kolkata needed for a long time and Paranthe Wali Gali makes that happen.
A disappointment is that the place closes early, by 9pm, and their last order is by 8.30pm.
The idea behind the ambience also stands out as you will find some quirky one liners on the walls and what brings a personal touch are the photos clicked by the owner himself during his personal tours.
My recommendation to the place would be that they hire some efficient staff as I noticed on a recent visit that the service was average and the number of staff failed to catch up with the orders.

Awesome parathas. Cheese garlic paratha & Sitafal Lassi are must haves.¬†
I would not recommend puchkizza though it is very famous and over hyped, it is not at all worth the money.
However, puchkizza aside, the service & food is amazing. Must Visit.

Located in Lake Terrace ( deshapriya park) this restaurant brings the charm of old Delhi to our Kolkata. The place is decorated with eye catching quirky stuffs like belan, glass bangles, latkan, post boxes etc. One of the wall has different pictures of old Delhi. The ambience was very nice. Coming to the menu this place serves 40 types of parathas and many more other things as well. We had ordered chicken cheese paratha, dhania mirch chicken paratha, keema chawal, badam rabri lassi and classic avalanche. Chicken cheese paratha is a must try for all. It was stuffed with ample amount of cheese and chicken. Classic avalanche was a bowl full of heavenly pleasure. The quantity was quite large so two people can easily share it. Those hand painted kettle in which they serve the bill was so beautifull. Overall it was a very good experience. Staff were very helpful. ¬†Looking forward for another visit.

Have been meaning to drop by to this place since seeing good reviews by my fellow foodies. Also I am a big fan of Bon Appetit cafe and wanted to try out this new venture by the same team. I liked the quirky and Desi decorations. The hilarious one liners on the wall are a nice touch. Me and my friend decided to order some the Chicken and cheese paratha, keema chawal and Gulabi Gulkhand lassi. The paratha was very good. Loaded with shredded chicken and cheese , it was delicious. I love the condiments served with the paratha,especially the pickle and onions. My friend loved them too and decided to pack 2 for takeaway. The keema chawal was tasty too. I liked the use of steel tiffin box for presentation, it gave a retro feel and also kept the food hot. The lassi was so much better than I expected it to be. Extremely thick and frothy, one glass is enough for two. The rose flavour was subtle and refreshing. Me and my friend were very happy with out lunch at this cute little place and would be revisiting again for the love of their parathas...!

When your tummy is satisfied, your mood is set! This is what Paranthe Wali Gali is all about. The way they satisfy one's hunger and cravings for something really good, is praiseworthy. 
Coming to the main part, we had Chicken Cheese Parantha and Chilli Garlic Chicken Parantha. And both just fulfilled our expectations. The filling was just perfect! The 'achaar' and 'dahi' along with the Paranthas were an added joy to our taste buds.
We also ordered Strawberry Lassi and Masala Thumsup which again quenched our 'summer' thirst.  
The decor is beautifully done. And the service is also worth mentioning. You just have to wait for 5-7 minutes before devouring the delicacies. 
To sum up, a pocket friendly eatery, serving super good food and satisfying all the food lovers. üòä

A sudden urge to have 'aloo porota' brought me to this quaint little place tucked in one of the bylanes of lake terrace all the way from sealdah.
The d√©cor was perfect...Very vibrant and quirky... But i felt a bit stuffy due to poor ventilation.
We had chicken chettinad wings which was a bit too salty and reeked of garlic.
But the paranthe compensated. Achari chicken , egg pocket , garlic chicken paranthe were what we had and they tasted amazing with the curd and pickle!
However what made me rate this place a 4 is their lassi. Heavenly.....
The motichoor ki lassi and the Rabri badam lassi were undoubtedly the üåü of the day!
I could sip at them till eternity and yet want more!
Go and taste.... They can conjure up anything into a parantha i guess!

3 trips in two weeks is enough to suggest how much I enjoy the food there. Never of the opinion that cheese and parantha go together, I loved their garlic cheese parantha so much so that I ordered in once after and went back for more. Unlike a lot of places, their stuffing is wholesome and you can taste it in every bite. However they don't always have everything on the menu available and that can be a let down. Their variety to lassi though varied was too sweet for my taste. Pocket friendly and definitely worth a visit.

Located in Deshapriya park, this themed restaurant is perfect for a hangout joint with friends! We tried the following items-

1) chicken cheese parantha(4/5)- An amazing parantha with ample amount of both cheese and chicken served with curd and achar! Honestly it is best had by itself this one is surely a must try!

2)chicken dhania mirchi parantha(4.5/5)-As the name suggests the filling comprises of spiced chicken with chillies and coriander. It is somewhat spicy and has a very strong flavour quotient! Its the best parantha we tried that afternoon! If spicy is the flavour you look for, then this is the dish u can't be leaving out on! Recommended!

3)Achari chicken parantha(2.5/5)- The chicken had a very sour mango achar flavour with a distinct smell of mustard oil- it failed to impress me!

4)chhetinad chicken wings(1/5)- We had ordered this on a friend's recommendation,but what was served was ratger depressing!The flavour was bad-the chicken pieces hardly had meat! This dish came as a punishment! He too admited that it tasted better on his previous visit! I guess we were unlucky with this dish!

5) achari-lasooni chicken wings(1.5/5)- I somehow feel paranthe walli galli doesnt do justice with chicken wings at all! This was slightly better than the previous one yet so disappointing! The same problem with the chicken pieces that had a very thin layer of mean sticking on to the bones- the sauce was as liquid as curry!It had no coating as such! I don't find the reason of serving such a "bad" dish and lowering the rating when the other dishes served are doing great job!

6)Chocolate parantha(3.5/5)- Now that we had experimented with the other variants ,we wanted to stick to paranthas! So that's what we ended up ordering and weren't disappointed at all! It had a thick layer of chocolate sauce on the paratha topped with chocolate and white chocolate chips! Somehow I felt that parantha and chocolate didn't go that well together but still a decent dish to try!!

7) classic avalanche(4.5/5)- this is the best dish you could end your meal with! Chocolate cake, vanilla icecream,chocolate sauce,choco chips and chocolate wafer sticks!! Should I say more!! The quanitity is so huge that it can easily be shared by 2-3 people depending upon their appetite! This being an outlet of Bon appetite could Never go wrong with this one! Recommended!

Overall a fun place to try paranthas of different variant and ofcourse the classic avalanche is to die for!! However on my next visit I would stay away from those chicken wings!!

This place is one of the recent addition to the wide array of restaurants in the Desapriya Park area. The ground floor of an apartment, the roof of which is unusually low, is made into this amazing food joint. It might be a little difficult for first-timers to locate this place and hence, using Google Maps is advisable. The adjacent Cafe Coffee Day outlet might serve as a landmark for this place. The decor is simple and somewhat banal creating a typical eastern ambience. It is a wing of Bon Appetit group and consequently, you get amazing desserts here too apart from the delectable paranthas. We had ordered Achari Chicken Parantha, Dhania Mirch Chicken Parantha, Chicken Cheese Parantha, Chettinaad Chicken Wings, Achari Lassun Chicken Wings, Chocolate Parantha, Classic Avalanche.


Chicken Cheese Parantha: A must-try dish for all. It was deftly prepared with proper proportions of cheese and chicken and was extremely delicious. Highly recommended!


Dhania Mirch Chicken Parantha: This dish too is a must-try. It was very spicy and tastes heavenly. Highly recommended!


Achari Chicken Parantha: This parantha was slightly disappointing. It was definitely not bad, but the previous two paranthas we had had were a class apart. Hence, our expectations were higher from this dish too. Nevertheless, it tasted so-so.


The Chicken Wings were not good at all. Both the wings we had tried were not good and we were cursing ourselves for ordering that. The Paranthas were getting over in a minute whereas we took around 15 minutes to finish the wings. We were literally struggling to finish having all the wings. I hope this analogy is enough to give you the clear idea about the taste of the Chicken Wings.


Chocolate Parantha: An innovative fusion of parantha and chocolate with nuts sprinkled on top. The parantha had fillings of chocolate cake and the taste was good. Recommended!



Classic Avalanche: As I have mentioned above, this place being a wing of Bon Appetit, will definitely serve amazing desserts. This dish was out of the world. The taste, the presentation, the quantity, everything was so perfect. After having the toothsome paranthas make sure you try this dessert, otherwise, you will lose out on one of their special dishes. Highly recommended!


A very good place with awesome food served. Other than the Chicken Wings nothing was disappointing. Infact, all the dishes except the Wings were top-notch. I would love to visit this place again for trying out the other items. A must visit place for every parantha and dessert lover.

The new restaurant which pledges to give you a taste of Purani Delhi falls a tad bit short of the mark. I haven't tried all the parathas but then I would not recommend the Achari Aloo paratha, neither the ladoo paratha, I know you guys are wondering what I was thinking. However the reason for the visit has to be the wings, they are light and not fried and suits and soothes the palate which yearns for a hint of spice. The Aachari Lasoon Chicken wings steal the and would definitely be the reason behind my second visit. I was a tad bit disappointed about the fact they didn't have the special Jalebis which are oh so amazing in Delhi. All said and burped, the achari lasoon chicken wings are definitely worth a visit.

Paranthe Wali Gali is the new Gem in the Town. It is located at 104, Lake Terrace at Desapriya Park. 

The place is not difficult to locate as Google will guide you through quite easily.

Like they say "Don't Judge the book by its cover", which is true with Paranthe Wali Gali. You cant imagine the experience you are upto just by looking at it.
 We reached there in the evening and we were lucky to get the table even during the rush hour.¬†

The interiors are that of a typical Dhaba and everything is placed really well so as to provide a perfect ambience. 
The quotes on the walls are witty and will definitely make you smile.¬†

This place has a lot of variety in Parantha and Lassi. We started with Sattu Ka Parantha, Thai Chilli Parantha and Dhaniya Pyaaz Paranthas. ¬†Along with this we ordered Chachh Lassi, Mango Lassi and Green Apple Lassi. ¬†We got served real quick and we didn't have to wait for long to wait for the order.

Sattu Parantha had a proper filling of Sattu and the other ingredients were properly mixed. 
The Thai Chilli Corn Parantha had a slight spicy taste along with the corn in it. ¬†The taste of the paranthas are quite similar to the ones you get at the Paramthe Wali Gali (The lane) in Delhi.
¬†¬†
The Thai Chilli Corn Parantha was even better than the ones you get in Delhi. The paranthas were stuffed really well and hence are filling. ¬†They provide you with Curd and Pickle plus onion along with Parantha. We later ordered Aloo Matar parantha which was also good. ¬†But the Thai Chilli Corn Parantha was the best among all the paranthas we ordered. ¬†

Talking about the Lassi now, the Chachh Lassi is pretty good with added masala in it. 
The mango Lassi was thick and yummy but it had sugar slightly on the higher side otherwise. It's a good option. Green Apple Lassi is a must have. It will delight your taste buds.

The service is pretty good. The place is well maintained and kept neat & clean. The staff is courteous. This is a place which is pocket friendly and value for money. 

There are other items which definitely needs to be tried and I am going to this place again for sure. 
I hope they maintain their qulaity of food and services in the near future. ¬†

P.S. This place is a unit of Bon Appetit which again is a must try !!

A dainty place beautifully and smartly decorated.
The colour combination is done just right for the quirky set up. 

Cheese Paratha wasn't as per the expectations as the one I had in Bon Appetite seemed to set a benchmark. Nevertheless, it had cheese üòç

Chocolate Paratha was love. Towards the end, one can't just finish the awesome thing. PS: the brownie as the filling could be reduced a bit.

This place gets a high rating for it's beautifully done interiors. The vibe that you get when you enter this restaurant will totally uplift your mood.

We ordered Mirch Aloo Parantha, Cheese Classic Parantha, Dhania Mirch Chicken Parantha Tandoori Chicken wings, Badam Rabri Lassi and Strawberry Lassi.
The Mirch Aloo Parantha was tangy in taste whereas the Cheesy one was rich in flavor. If you prefer spicy dishes then the Dhania Mirchi Parantha is a must try. It is a wonderful classic. 

The Chicken Tandoori wings came in a tiffin box. I liked the presentation but the taste didn‚Äôt impress us much. It was a bit undercooked. Both the lassi‚Äôs were tasty but I would recommend you the Badam one. 
 

All in all, Paranthe Wali Galli managed to impress our tummies.

** Location = Lake Terrace, zomato maps are very much convenient to reach there.

**Brief = On a hot sultry afternoon, I was accompanied by Triasha Banerjee¬†to have some tasty food there.

** Ambiance = Very much spacious, colourful benches to sit on, walls ordained with funny one-liners and photographs, in short its a very beautifully decorated place, with friendly servers.

** Things tried = Aloo Cheese Paratha, Chicken Cheese Paratha, Chaanch Lassi, Orange Lassi, Keema Chawal.

The Chicken Cheese Pizza was just too good to be true, so cheesy that one an indulge into something heavenly. The Aloo Cheese Paratha was also very tasty, they were accompanied with curd and onion pickle.

The Chaanch Lassi and Orange Lassi quenched our thirst considerably.

The Keema Chawal was served in a tiffin container and made me remember my school days.

Their menu contained some new varieties like Puch-kizza, Nachos Bomb, Wai Wai Bomb etc. I am sure we shall try them out soon.

The bill was served in a kettle along with hajmi lozenges, a big thumbs up to this idea.

**Recommended = Chicken Cheese Paratha, Keema Chawal, Chaanch Lassi.

** Purse Check = Our bill was about Rs. 555/-, rupees 600/- would be enough for two.

**Overall = One of the best places I have been to in a recent times. Keep rocking guys :)

Colorful joint with quirky quotes and ethnic decor. Was craving for Rajma chawal and was pretty excited to see it on the menu. Served hot with a dollop of butter. The cheese aloo paratha was also amazing but the gobi paratha was a let down so was the chicken rice.

Reaaallly reallly disappointed with THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE STAFF
we felt like THEY WERE KEEPING WATCH ON US...WHICH WAS DAA√ÄAMN DISGUSTING
will never ever visit again
Anyways the food is good
Nothing extremely tasty
But good
We ordered only 2 parathas
We already have been into other places for trying out new dishes on that day so was already full n not at all hungry
Even if that was not the case its completely upto us how much we will order.
We heard them talking OFFENSIVE craps about us
Anyway
We ordered
‚óè chicken dhania mirch paratha-good.a bit spicy.
‚óèchicken cheese paratha-it was also good
Both the parathas were served with dahi and pickle
WILL NEVER VISIT AGAIN ONLY BECAUSE OF THE BEHAVIOUR

'Paranthe Wali Galli' waa opened a few months bacj in Sarat Bose Road but I was unable to visit for such a long time.I visited it once but at that time they did not have any chicken so I went out.I again visited a few days back to satisfy my cravings for some good paranthas.

The decor is really beautiful with bangles,pictures of Delhi,quirky walls and lighting. We went for one 'Chicken Cheese Parantha' with extra cheese first. The parantha came within 10 minutes. The parantha was delectable to say the cheese.I have had the cheese parantha of 'Bon Appetit''but this parantha waa far superior to that one.The combination of tender and juicy chicken along with cheese made it a perfect dish.

Up next,we ordered one 'Keema Rice'. The food came within ten minutes. It was served in a steel tiffin box. The 'keema rice' was delicious,even though my friend found this dish mediocre. The spicy minced chicken along with white rice made a perfect dish.

The only about this restaurant is its service. One particular female waiter seemed like a fish out of the water. She was mixing up orders, dropped our spoon and came out as a bit arrogant. The management should look into this. All in all, a great restaurant and I will visit again.

I visited Parathe Wali Galli with my friends and I was super satisfied by the decor, service and most importantly the food. The decor is so beautiful and attractive that as soon as you enter you can feel the coziness and smell delicious Parathas being made.
We ordered Cheese garlic paranthe which stole the show and then in order to try non-veg, we ordered Masala Chicken which was masaledar and non-oily.
Next we had Chettinad chicken wings which was tangy in taste. Last but not the least, we had strawberry lassi which was lovely. Thumbs up to their innovation.

As I've given 5 stars you can already imagine how much I'm impressed by the restaurant. First come to the location, it was very easy to locate just 5 minutes walk from Rash behari avenue... We didn't had much difficulty to find it...
AMBIENCE :Come to the decor..they've done an excellent decor..with pretty little things like churi(bangles),house decors etc and everybody would the shayari nd funny quotes written on the walls...they were so catchy nd it offered a great ambience overall.
So me and my friend went on a Sunny day and we're too much hungry so at first we ordered some refreshing lassi me strawberry lassi and my friend tried aam lassi...both just blown our mind...both lassis had their own flavor blending in correct proportion... After a long time I got such satisfying lassi...then we were just too confused to order because they have a huge collection of paranthaa (as the name suggests) If u love north Indian food,this restaurant is just for you and even if u don't love then this restaurant is here to make you fall in love with....
THE FOOD : We ordered cheese aloo paratha,anda pocket and achari paneer parantha...the quantity and quality both were up to the mark..I loved the achari paneer most and the best thing is u can get the taste in every bite u want.....In desert we chose chocolate parantha...which was a great choice... It was stuffed with choco muffin cake and coated with hot chocolate... And nobody can deny that it may b the best creation they've ever ate on parantha.No complain with service... Staffs were helpful and the food is neither overpriced nor less...after this long order we managed a bill under 500 so one can imagine it's completely pocket friendly.. I'd like vist again nd again nd again üòäüòä

Ambiance is good as well the inside decorations. 
Bt disappointment starts with not availability of their special badam rabri lassi. So ultimately We ordered chatpata paneer paratha, chicken cheese paratha, corn aloo paratha, chas and mango lassi.
Chicken cheese paratha and chas is too good. But the chatpata paneer paratha is not good rather we both didn't liked it as well the mango lassi is also average  in taste. All total an average experience.. 
Would like to go again to taste the badam rabri lassi...

New in town and getting the buzz that it deserves. This place certainly is one of the better restaurants to have spawned in recent times. Simple theme, doesn't scream for attention yet has everyone talking about it. The reason being those wonderful paranthas. People might argue that the price is slightly on the heavier side but fact is one parantha that costs about 130 bucks is enough to fill one's stomach. Not only paranthas, they also serve some great desserts and lassis. People having sweet tooth can visit this place for the sake of the desserts only if paranthas are not your thing. I've been here and I was seriously impressed.

Went to this place today. The things excited me are the ambience, the decor, the concept and obviously the menu. It was great to find colorful kettles and stainless steel utensils used for service. Ordered one cheese aloo paratha and Dahi Phuchka. The paratha was amazing and very filling. The Dahi Phuchka did not excite me much as I expected it to be more interesting. The prices are perfect and overall a good experience. Would like to come on one of my non veg day to try some non veg dishes.

Paranthe Wali Gali ingeniously sketched the menu to encompass a variety of veg, non-veg and fusion parathas. For the decoration they chose the theme of dhaba and it is inspired by Delhi‚Äôs famous Paranthe Wali Gali. The wall is decorated with several wonderful pictures of the country‚Äôs famous street-foods, shops, spices and, of course, faces. The interior is adorned with Bailan (rolling pin), colourful bangles, hair tassels etc. From door to seats everything was very colourful.

Their parathas are abundantly stuffed and well seasoned. We tried one non veg chicken cheese paratha and one veg channe ki dal paratha and both were equally delightful. But I really wish that they provide some more choices for side dish. Any paneer item was not available. The motichur lassi just melted in my mouth. The bill was given in a nicely painted kettle. My experience here was a little unusual than other regular restaurant visits and I must say it was really fulfilling.

Two weeks back I visited this place........and it was Sunday soo there was a huge rush ....we had to wait in a queue for near about half an hour..as we entered after 8.30 in the restaurant so most of the items were unavailable so we ordered chicken chesse Partha and keema chawal.Both of the item tasted just superb but Staffs are not properly trained though they are good in terms of behavior...my suggestion will be there must be an attendant who can actually manage queue of the customer out side of this food joint and also communicate with the customer and as well as Waiters.Otherwise it's a great place. Ambience is also good .I would love to visit this place again and again to try their other dishesüòÉ

This was on my wishlist for a few months till last week when we finally managed to visit Paranthe Wali Galli. PWG aka Paranthe Wali Galli is a place no less than home. The restaurant is the most informal place ever. They have tried to retain the essence of the dhaba and have been successful. A place that serves over 40 varieties of paratha. The place is known for it's innovative lassis - Gulkand, Motichur Lassi to name a few. The parathas are the perfect grease you would want to have, accompanied with some flavour full bhurjis. I am personally in love with their chatpate chane ka masala paratha and paneer bhurji! Try their rose kulfi too. And such reasonable rates. You will be full yet your eyes will not believe the bill kept in front of you, you'd wish you could pack some more food in your body :)

Commendable job by the owner. One can see the hard work gone into designing the menu and the quality of food achieved. A place I would love to go back. Please open an outlet in Salt lake. I assure you of my loyalty, I promise to visit everyday!!! :D

This was our first visit to this Kolkata version of the famous Paranthe Wali Gali of Delhi, packed in a small room in one of the by lanes of Desapriya Park. As you enter, the quirky colour combination of panels in the door will instantly grab your attention. The decor is eye catching with walls adorned with rows of bangles and funny quotes as can be seen in trucks and lorries. The wooden tables and benches are bound to take you down the memory lane. Overall, the decor will create a lasting impression in your mind.

Coming to the food, we had ordered:

Chicken Cheese Parantha- served with mixed veg pickle and yogurt, I really liked the taste. The right amount of cheese was used, not overshadowing the overall taste of the preparation.

Achari Chicken Parantha- served with mixed veg pickle and yogurt, it left a lingering tangy taste.

Achari Lassun Chicken Wings- 4 pieces of chicken wings served in an old school small tin box which many of us might have used for storing/carrying small items during school days, again a trip down the memory lane. The taste was good, a bit too salty though.

Badam Rabri Lassi- served in dhaba style steel glass, I really liked this thick and full of badam version of lassi. This is definitely a must try.

The bill was placed in a beautifully painted colourful kettle accompanied by black lozenges which are usually sold in Kolkata buses and trains.

One area of improvement could be the ventilation inside the restaurant. At times the room was smoky from the kitchen which affected the eyes. Overall, the prices are quite reasonable and service is fast. This place is definitely a must visit.

Since it's inception on November 2016, Paranthe Wali Galli has always intrigued me for a visit and why not? A place bustling with over 40 flavours of Paranthas and over 20 varieties of lassi is reason enough for me.

Yeah being a Punjabi myself, I owe my allegiance to food like this but let me assure you,  PWG (As I abbreviate) is NOT your regular Dhaba food haunt. 

Have you ever thought you could devour Rajma or Kadhi or Choley with Brown rice? Or have Pizza inside a Puchka?  No na! Then that's reason enough to start heading out here.

The show stoppers for me were the Mango Lassi, Benarasi Aaloo, Gud ki Thandai, Keema Chawal and Laddoo Parantha. I still have loads to try off the menu so couple of visits are in order.

A meal at PWG is much more than just good food. It's an experience being surrounded by a quintessential highway styled decor- colourful doors, a montage of wanderlust clicked by the owner Rahul Arora himself, Parandi's, bangles and my favourite Truck Quotes.

A typical meal for 2 would approximately cost you within INR 500 including tax and that my friend, is a steal deal.

So next time, don't "Dekho magar pyar see"...Eat pyar se too! There's a whole lot love out here!

I was craving to go eat at this place ever since this opened up. A tiny place under the bon appetite unit put my hopes quite high. And they did not fail. The cheese garlic parantha is absolutely heaven. I teamed that up with a sweet lassi, yes, keeping it basic, and I had the best food experience ever. My friend ordered a Chilli Garlic Paneer parantha and a Badaam-rabri lassi. Well, it wasn't bad but let's just say that my choice was better. 
One major rule when you go out to eat any were try and stick to the basics unless you really wanna experiment. The cheese parantha here earned itself a good name and it was a must try so I went ahead with that. 
Nevertheless, this place is a must must must visit and after satisfying your tummy you can even go and chill along the lake at Sarobar if you want to. 
Bon appetite guys :D

What can one say about ParantheWali Galli that hasn't been said before?
This was my first visit to this warm and homely restaurant where the decor is so quirky yet so warm that it will grab your attention. With colourful kettles , gods and goddesses, brass bells and last but not the least the long gone ambassador headlight... this will stay in your mind.
I had the privilege of being invited to taste their spring menu exclusively crafted by the complete genius Rahul Arora. In fact after having a sip at his gulabi gulkand lassi... I had to get up and hold his chubby hands and exclaim at his sheer genius!
That's for later. We started with the much famed Phuchkizza. This is our teekha phuchka married to the vilayati pizza. Baked together, this is something you have to eat one at one go and trust me the taste just bursts like an atom bomb inside your mouth!
We had the chatpate chane ka paratha, the chicken paratha and the hare pyaaz aur lassoon ka paratha. These were accompanied by the Paneer Bhurji and the Ande ki Bhurji. I personally loved the Hare Pyaaz aur lassoon ka paratha. The sweetness of the onions were a perfect compliment to the ande and the Paneer Bhurji. That a humble Bhurji could be so exciting was also beyond me.
Quenching our thirst we had the Gur ki Thandai. Again that the simple nolen Gur could be blended with the zingy lemon and a dash of salt which can produce this result was unimaginable. You won't be able to stop at one. And it's the perfect cooler for this harvesting season too.
The Dessert is the most difficult part. I was spoilt silly in drooling and feeling decidedly gluttony after the Gur ki Thandi Dahi. I actually wanted to bring back some home. No no... not for my sonüòÜ but for myself. You can call me a glutton. I don't much care.
There was also the Gulab Elaichi ki Kulfi. And what a Kulfi it was! Perfectly done without the additional binding agents that sometimes make the kulfi s hard to break... this was melt in your mouth.
Rahul tempted us further with the chocolate paratha... with dark and white chocolate chips sprinkled all over. Decidedly decadent and sinfully delicious!
I am going to go back without a doubt and those who haven't should . Without fail.

I love how these little innovative eateries are coming up in Kolkata. We had a sumptuous lunch here. The paranthas were obviously finger-licking delicious. We had nimbu Pani which I wasn't very happy about. And I would have really loved to see some Jalebi like desserts instead of desserts stuffed inside paranthas.

Being an unit of Bon Appetit Cafe this was ought to be good and trust me it lives upto the expectations. Similar to it's parent outlet this also is a small place with two sections, one for small groups while another dedicated for big groups.
The interiors are so catchy that you just want to discover the whole place once you are there. May it be those 'Funny one liners' on plates hanging all around the place, or may it be a rod running filled with Glass-bangles running across one wall, or still photos from places of Lucknow, that makes this place to attractive and worth a visit even with keeping the food aside. 
Coming to the food, we ordered :-

Chilli Garlic Panner Paratha- A Paratha is a must when coming to this place. The taste of the paratha was good and tasted like a homemade one. Although there wasn't any chili in the chili cheese paratha, the staff was courteous enough to offer us a replacement, which we denied. 

Motichur Lassi- The name itself is so catchy that being a sweet lover I couldn't resist myself from ordering it. It's a lassi with Motichur Laddu crushed in it, with every sip you get crumps of the Laddu in your mouth which in a way I liked. The taste is good and is worth trying for all the sweet lovers. 

Classic Avalanche- This is Bon Appetit's Chocolate Avalanche renamed. There's a lot said in favour of it already and it need no more introduction. It's just one thing that I observed, the quantity of the same at this place is more than that at Bon appetit, you'll notice it once you have been to both places. 

All in all it's a good place to be with some catchy interiors, tasty food, courteous staff and pocket-friendly prices.

Paranthe Wali Gali is a cozy food joint near Deshopriyo Park and one can expect awesome food at affordable prices. We ordered an Aloo methi paratha,  Dhania mirch chicken parantha and Masaledar sattu parantha. I would say that the chicken parantha tasted the best followed by sattu parantha. The keema rice was pure bliss and the fact that it was served in a tiffin box made it feel more like home. However we expected the rice to be a bit more in quantity.We also ordered Aam lassi- it was amazing! The lassi had this perfect flavour of mango to it- everything was just in the right  proportions. 
The service was satisfactory, however i felt that the place needs a better ventilation system. We practically arrived into a smoke filled room and I intially found it hard to make myself comfortable. The place is otnerwise very comfortable and the food is absolutely amazing. The interior is very eye catchy the vibrantly coloured walls and decor lift up the mood in a jiffy! 
I enjoyed being at the place and would recommend going there if you want to have amazing paranthas at very affordable prices.

The restruant although looks small but the decor inside is nice. Now coming to the food we had ordered chicken cheese paratha and chili garlic paneer paratha. The parathas were a bit oily but the taste was awesome with the onion aachar n dahi they had served. We ordered kesari badami lassi which was equally good

In short it was goodexperience. I recommend everyone to try it once

It is little tough to find this place, one can even pass by and miss the entrance. Inside, their d√©cor is done in dhaba style,  they chose bright colors and some funny poems, which really entertained us. üòÅ
We order GOBI PARANTHA, CHOLEY CHAWAL, BADAM LASSI,  CLASSIC AVALANCHE.

When Rahul opens up anything new, it‚Äôs bound to be different, be it Bon Appetite or the soul caf√© Pranaah. Now with Paranthe wali Galli it‚Äôs opened up an all new pandora‚Äôs box.

Being invited to the place before the opening up was something definitely special. Very close to Deshapriya Park and two lanes from Xrong Place it is too much to miss out upon.

It is the charm of the place that makes it so different, a small outlet efficiently managed, and a place which can take you places‚Ä¶ With pictures captured by Rahul and writings on the wall made on plates, it has certain elements which takes you away, to a faraway place, in the bylanes of Delhi, all the way to Paranthe Wali Galli.

The food now presented was mind-blowing, we were first presented with the nacho puchka and the dahi puchka. While the dahi puchka was just about right with the flavors and was without doubt awesome, the nacho puchka was different, with the flavor of refried beans teamed up with curd giving a totally varied flavor to your daily puchka.

The drinks were different and the rose Gulkand Lassi was great, a lot similar to the average rose flavored lassi but a lot different due to the thickness and the flavor. The motichoor lassi was very good and exactly what you can expect from the name. The awesomeness of the masala thums up however was something which you gotta appreciate and that I why I ended up with two glasses of the same. Served in stainless steel dhaba glasses it is a force to reckon with.

Coming to the parathas the Aloo Methi paratha was good with the methi nicely balancing the taste of the potatoes which go into it. The Cheese Paratha was good with the chees not overriding the taste of the paratha and that is what makes it a beautiful combination and clearly highlights the hard work which has gone in it.

The next set of parathas stole the show, between the Olive Jalapeno Paratha which had the correct amount of fire to team with the flavor of olives and the Achari Paneer one where the blandness of single flavor of paneer was negated by the flavor of pickles, I loved the latter one more where I would have had atleast 3 pieces and had there not been the onslaught of menu pending I would have had an entire one myself.

The Dhania Mirch Chicken Paratha was different to say the least and spicy with shredded chicken which gave it an altogether different feel.

The quick bites served in between were really good and between the Chettinad Paneer Skewers where I felt maybe the flavor was a little less and could have been a little bit more significant and the honey Garlic wings I would any day ask everyone to try the wings. It was awesomeness redefined, with the sweetness of honey and the fried flavor of the wings it was a taste like no other. It was served in metal boxes like the ones they use for keeping cash in small shops and it was like a treat waiting to be relished.

If this was not enough what came next was a surprise altogether. The curry with rice combos are awesome while the smell for the chicken and the egg curry is similar to the ones you get in long train journeys and reminds you of visit to far distant lands, the flavor is what they have been trying to achieve but have always failed. The kadhi rice was really good, light and enjoyable. I was huffing and puffing with breath trying to find a place to lie down and rest.

The final thing awaiting were desserts and guess what, yes, paratha based desserts. The chocolate paratha with chocolate sauce and choco chips is surely something you would not want to miss and I had three pieces, but what came next was equally if not even ¬†better. Thus presenting the khoya kheer paratha. It was a beauty, a taste to reckon with.

While I was leaving I took one of each back for the roads. All in all an awesome experience.

Be there, enjoy the magic, live the fun, relish the taste‚Ä¶..

Colorful decor, checked! Rammers with tiny bells, checked! Balti chairs, checked! Steel utensils and BIG lassi glasses, checked! Welcome to Paranthe Wali Galli! a small place for mouthful options. How many paranthas did you have so far! They have huge options with unique varieties - like who else would serve you Cheese Mushroom Parantha, Anda pockets and achari dhania parantha!!!! Even the chocolate paratha is irresistible. Feeling thirsty after a plateful of savory parantha ? Drink Lassis and how! choose from Motichoor ka lassi or Kishmish Rabri sherbet. Options are sweet, innovative and endless. The khatta-mitha toffee that comes with the bill is certainly not to miss! 

In Kolkata, if you want to get the authenticness in the taste and dig into the richness of Delhi's Khao Gali cuisine. Please dine at Paranthe Wali Gali. 

Baki toh Rab Rakha!

Visited this place with friends. We ordered the chilli cheese paratha and dhania pyaaz paratha. We tried ordering the kebabs but they weren't available.
The chilli cheese parantha wasn't very good, we couldn't find any cheese in it.
Overall the experience was quite mediocre.

Well saw this place first in TOI , then searched it in Zomato . Instantly I was in love and I had to visit , they have opened up recently . Decoration -5 ,food- it's  more than foodgasam , holy moly please try their mustard chili Chicken wings , the taste the taste . I m a huge chicken lover but never in my life I had tasted chicken in kasundi preparation, it transported to a different world . They are famous for paranthe taste any of it they are  good (as was assured by the waitress) , lassi is chumu (pure love ) , then had chicken chawal (I can only say this 'i had a great taste food attack yesterday ) . The points where you need to develop is hospitality . When we entered the hotel it was pretty empty , we sat according to our choice but later when people started pouring in they asked us to shift . Also for the address they pretty messed us up and food suggestions were not given properly . That is why I rated 4.5 but for food , decor and price it's more than 100

Located in Southern avenue amidst the various other outlets of different resturants, Paranthe Wali Galli will sure catch your eyes or rather drag your eyes with its quirky decor. The entrance door with its myriad colours promises to offer you something great inside and once you step in a beautiful brick red wall with pictures will greet you with warmth and nostalgia. Apart from this the decor is quite bling and shine and everything nice.Now coming to food,  the chocolate paranthe was a tad bit hyped is what i feel because after few bites it doesn't quite make your taste bud feel better. We also had honey chicken which in contrast was far far better .
And college peeps they do charge tax.
I found the staff a bit weird. 
Month end and in Southern Avenue?
Head to this joint without second thoughts.

Having lived in Delhi, I get cravings for its street food. I particularly liked the paranthes, specially on cold cold winter mornings.¬†

¬†Paranthe Wali Galli
 fills that void ( food wise, Calcutta will never be as cold as Delhi, sigh), and then some.¬†

My favorite are the golgappa bombs, ¬†particularly the Chole Chatpate Bomb. Is so door that after the first one my mouth refused to stop drooling, ¬†the only way I can remotely describe it is ..... if you have ever seen an Alpenlibe advertisement, 'jeeb lap-lapaying' stuff ¬†!!

The pranthes are on point, they bring back so many warm memories. I am always a classic alu fan, but the cheesy ones are a surprise. Somewhere in between a pizza and so moist. That mixed pickle onion thingy which is served alongside is just awesome.¬†

And do try the khoya gulkand variety, it sounds whack.
Don't think, just have. It will make sense. Just the right bit of sweet and a minor guilty feeling.¬†

There are surprises too, the wings that is. So succulent.¬†

And then comes the tiffin boxes full of keema/rajma/kadhi/chicken/egg with rice. I loooooove the rajma and keema rice.¬†

I must inform you not to have all this at once, as I did.¬†

You can try. (if you do, make sure your company is strong, mine definitely was)

The only thing that this place has any resemblance is that it is in a ‚ÄòGalli‚Äô.

It‚Äôs in the lane parallel to the Lake road ‚Äì essentially behind the lake road Caf√© Coffee Day. Here the similarity ends, the ‚ÄòGali‚Äô itself is nothing like the bustling Parathewali Gali in Delhi. As you get in the d√©cor hits you with the variety of colors ‚Äì  those looking for ironies will not fail to notice that the restaurant is housed in a building dominated by an Electronics showroom that‚Äôs all blue and white. A little like walking into Sanjay Leela Bansalis ‚ÄòRangoli‚Äô straight after watching his ‚ÄòSanware‚Äô And yes get Old Delhi out of your head, neither this nor any other can come close‚Ä¶. 

The place does not need to imitate anyone. Its unique and stands out on its own strengths. The mainstay of the menu are the Parathas and are better than many places that claim to specialize in Parathas (Not sure if Kolkata has any other have not checked the Parantha Plaza in Santoshpur, but Bangalore has a few). 

The pricing is slightly on the higher side - enough to keep out riff raff. The menu has interesting variations even in the Lassi served.

Well! What a place!
Its located in Deshopriya park and can be difficult to spot if you're nt using your navigator.

Ambience and Decor: a small cozy colourful joint. It has beautiful street photographed pictures of Delhi's "Paranthe wali galli". They 've kept hilarous hindi lines on the walls. Also, the stools were made out of Baltis which looked so cute . On the whole they made the entire restaurant very bright with addition of proper wit and punjabee flavour.

Food: We ordered dhaniya mirch chicken paratha which was spicy and tasty but the cheese chicken paratha blew my mind! Paranthas were served with curd and pickles which were equally tasty and made the meal even more worth having.
Chettinad chicken wings having being served in steel box was terribly tasty. I swear they ll make you lick your fingers.
Lastly, the chocolate parantha was something that i can never forget. It was heavenly and was an out of the world experience to have. It was stuffed with brownie and had molten chocolate and white and black chocolate chips being spreaded on.

I would highly recomend this place if you re a big time indian food lover! Every dish is lip smacking.
Visit ASAP :)

The name will give u a feel of Delhi but the paranthas are not Delhiwala. ¬†I missed the Punjabi touch both in Parantha and Lassi ,just an opinion though. Pocket friendly of course and wide range of paranthas you will get here but no complementary Butter . Common man! I hope to be delighted next time.
FYI: Slow service and lack of management.

The price is cheap, food is excellent, well decorate with good stuffs. 

Want to visit here again and try to taste different parathas.

Parathe Wali Gali is a small joint but it will definitely catch your eye on account of its bright colours. Once you enter, you are transported to another place altogether. Bright, garish decor with funny quotes (the sign outside the loo reads "yahaan peshaab karna hai") and pictures of Old Delhi and the original Parathewali Gali of Chandni Chowk on the walls, you know you are in for a treat.

For drinks we ordered a Gulabi Gulkand Lassi. Thick and creamy with a distinct hint of rose, it was absolutely spot on. We moved on to two varieties of chicken wings, the honey chilli and chettinad. Served in tin boxes wrapped in aluminium foil, they were pretty delicious but it has hard to distinguish between the two varieties in terms of flavour. ¬†The keema chawal came next and it was pure bliss : the rice, the minced chicken and the butter (there was a LOT of it, which is not a bad thing btw), spices and herbs blended together to create a simple yet marvellous creation. Comfort food at its very best, the sense of which was heightened by the fact that we ere eating it out of a steel tiffin box. No pretentious plating here, just good food in the appropriate package.

Then we moved on the main attraction : the parathas. We ordered 3 varieties from the savoury section and one from the sweet. The Jhaal Beet Paratha was red on the inside and deliciously spicy. The Dhania Mirch Chicken was delicious, the chicken stuffing was extremely flavourful. The best of the savoury parathas however was the Chicken Cheese paratha : not a full-on cheese overload (which I had been a bit concerned about), but just the right amount to satiate your taste-buds. I liked the use of shredded chicken instead of mince in the filling which greatly added to the textural dimension of the dishes. All parathas were served alongside a yoghurt raita and a delicious concoction made with pickles and onions, which complemented the parathas perfectly. However, it would be nice to see a couple more condiments in the future, for the sake of variety.

From the dessert section we ordered the crowd-pleasing chocolate paratha. People had been raving about it ever since the joint had opened and I, honestly, had been a tad skeptical about the combo. But one bite into this creation and I was sold. Filled with a brownie cake-pop type ¬†filling which will most certainly warm your heart and stain your teeth (as if I care about that whilst eating something this good) and topped with chocolate sauce and two varieties of chocolate chips, the paratha serves as a humble vehicle for a real chocolate overload. Highly recommended for all chocoholics like myself.

The service was prompt and the value for money was excellent. The complimentary kala khatta candies served at the end brought back a lot of memories.

I like Mr. Rahul Arora's menus, which have a distinct theme and variations feel to it. He takes something simple like a bowl of maggi, a salad, phuchka or a paratha and creates an amazing number of variations on it, from classic to downright quirky. Well, I certainly was spoiled for choice in this case and I will most certainly go back to try out more of the flavours of paratha and also the phuchkas. Kudos to the team at Parathe Wali Gali. Hope to see more quirky paratha flavours in the future.

A Sunday morning wasted. 

A parathe joint near Deshapriya Park where the owners give you wrong directions. 

A parathe joint with a very half-hearted decor, where the 'Mirch Masala' vibe is misplaced, mostly due to the unrelated and sub-par photographs. 

A parathe joint that has no straws. 

A parathe joint where you can hear the cook argue and shout over the phone regarding mushrooms that haven't arrived yet. 

And finally, a parathe joint, where we spent 316/- for one muli paratha, one gobi paratha and two lassis. We ended up somewhat enjoying the packet Amul lassi (they don't hide the fact, kudos to them for doing it in front of you - open the pack and squeeze) as the parathas were abysmal. I mean they were a concoction of all the Indian spices known to the world   and exactly one strand of the actual ingredient ordered (i.e. muli and gobi). Both parathas were sour, dry and unpalatable. 

1 star for the lassi, though that should go to Amul. 

Verdict: Not recommended. Ever.

Hunted down this place via zomato..and what a place..the catchy ambience with colours and decorated walls..photos and the seats..a good attempt to dig out the desi feel..ambience wise pretty impressive...
We ordered chicken wings achari lasooni...and this dish made my day..soft juicy piece of meat well marinated with the spice..oozing flavour..the skin was so well done...awesome indeed..The parathas are served with a bowl of dahi and a super tangy pickle..desi flavours...tasty indeed..
Next..the chilli garlic paneer paratha..a tad bit setback after the chicken...i couldnt feel the garlic much..it was average..
The cheese aloo paratha was bang on...generous amount of cheese made me drool...lovely indeed..
The dhania pyaz paratha was not that good but still i liked it...
Good initiative..a tad bit lower price would have made this place super pocket friendly..otherwise...above average..any day.

Ah! Dilli and Parantha. Nothing can go wrong. Here you get stuffing which you can never imagine. If you are a desi and lyk authentic flavours den you should try their masaledaar sattu parantha. Its worth.  Chicken and cheese parantha is just oozing cheese and soft chicken which will crave you for more. The size of parantha is very good and a single parantha will make fill your stomach. Along with parantha the lassis are amazing. We had stawberry, paan, motichur lassi. Each one was very flavourful and thick. Flavours of dilli in kolkata!

Had heard a lot about this place so thought of trying it on a Sunday evening at 7pm.. the first impression was a quirky dhaba with an interesting decor! What was shocking was the cold behaviour of the staff... the lady purser could not care less and the expression on her face showed that she's definitely not enjoying her work! We were made to wait for 39 minutes and while waiting I had asked for the menu so that we could decide on what to order. Although I was handed over a menu, it was taken back in less than five minutes .. after being seated, it was a task to gather eye contact with the staff to place the order. We ordered for the chilli honey wings, chicken n cheese paratha, keema chawal and onion dhania paratha ...  the brownie stuffed paratha would be our perfect dessert. The chicken n cheese paratha was fantastic with the home style pickle.. curd was sloppily squeezed out from plastic bag, not quite desired from a dhaba style joint .. the keema chawal was a let down. First, it's chicken mince and not meat .. neither did the menu say it was chicken keema nor the staff sensitise us.. the Keema Chawal was salt deficient and flavourless .. the chicken wings were delicately flavoured, soft n juicy served in a metal box .. we waited around for another 20 minutes for the onion Dhania paratha which was missed by the kitchen .. the lady purser did not place the order at all and she was not even apologetic for missing an item . She said it's not made .. we can make it if you want .. I asked her for the bill so that we could finish our meal else where ..  She happily produced the bill so that we could leave! I spoke to the manager who's apparently the chef.. he apologised and said there was nothing else that he could do .. 
Is this service?? When missed, no recovery? Is this hospitality?

So , you can never replicate the original Parathe wali gali in Delhi and this outlet proved it right! We went there at around 7.15 pm and the staff was very cold in their behaviour. They made us sit for fifteen minutes and no one came to take the order. I had to get up and ask them to atleast take the order as we had been sitting for long.

The food was served quickly . We ordered Pahadi Paneer paratha and Aloo Cheese Paratha and Strawberry Lassi. Truth be told, Lassi was very sour instead of being sweet and Pahadi Paneer paratha was horrible. Aloo Cheese Paratha was pretty good and was perhaps the only edible thing on the entire platter!

I really love Bon Appetit and this was not expected from the same franchise. 

The decors are pretty uptown dhaba style but the food was really the one that put the mood off instantly. In one word , Disappointed!

It's a venture of Bon Appetit group, and it's well thought through. Housing approx 10 tables, it is decorated in a 'Desi' way, with Slogans, photographs and Truck Decorations ! 
The menu limits itself to parathas and Side dishes apart from a few shakes. But don't worry as the varieties of Parathas here will blow your mind away. 

We tried the #Chicken&Cheese Paratha which was served with Onions and a spicy achar. It was quite filling.  Also took a #ChickenChettinadWings. Subtle spices and tangy, served in a tin box !
For Dessert we took the Brownie chocolate paratha. This had to be one of the best desserts out there. Filled with soft brownie, topped with choco sauce and white chocolate bits. Lovely :) 
We also managed to take an Apple+Cinnamon Lassi, which we couldn't finish as we were too full.

With a menu like no other in the city, Paranthe Wali Gali is a small, colorful place to go to and sample their myriad variations of India's favorite bread : parantha.¬†¬†
We opted for the Cheese Chicken, Dhaniya Murg and Jhaal Beet Parantha. Served with a small bowl of freshly made pickle and curd, all three of them hit the right cord. The standout, though, was the cheese chicken parantha. The creamy, very cheesy pieces of chicken along with the flaky parantha and a mouthful of pickle and curd is what can aptly be described as true foodgasm!¬†

The gulabi gulkand lassi was thick and well prepared and my only complain : the glass being too small. Next up were the chicken wings. Hot, bony and juicy, the wings were perfect but for a minor fiasco. We had ordered honey chilly wings and chettinad wings, but the chettinad wings tasted kind of like the honey chilly variety as well..!¬†
¬†
The keema chawal was pure love, though. Soft, buttery rice with smooth keema and the right amount of spices, Paranthe Wale Gali proved itself to be much more than just paranthas with this! The chocolate parantha in the end was purely indulgent. Stuffed with a brownie, the crispy parantha was topped or rather smothered with chocolate sauce and sprinkled with dark and white chocolate chips. Yummy!¬†
¬†
Reasonably priced, quick service and good food : this gali sure won my heart.

We ordered online today. The best thing about this place is its chocolate parantha and mushroom and cheese parantha. The chocolate parantha had brownie fillings with chocolate sauce and choco chips on top. Mushroom and cheese had the absolute right amount of cheese and mushroom. And we also ordered the chicken cheese parantha, chilly garlic paneer parantha and the cheese aloo parantha. These paneer and the aloo parantha were standard. Only the cheese aloo parantha did not have much cheese. Altogether I am totally happy and full. The price is also pocket friendly. The chocolate parantha and the mushroom cheese parantha much recommended.

Named after the legendary parathe  wali gali of Chandni Chowk, the place justifies the name. The original place would not be desirable by many if it comes to cleanliness and ambience. This place also like the original, difficult to locate if you are not from South Kolkata. Getting into the place, you will like the colourful decor and graphitis on the walls, the picture gallery giving you the feel of Old Delhi. 
There is a elaborate list of parathas with stuffing, both veg and non-veg varieties and also in the dessert section. We ordered Aloo matar , Gobi, pyaaz dhania, paneer, and the cheese garlic. My personal favorite was the cheese garlic,panner and the aloo matar. Unlike in Delhi where the parathas come with two different sabzi and raita, here they only serve curd and achar which was a little disappointing. Taste wise, parathas were really nice. Didn't have the space to try their dessert but will definitely give it a try next week.

Went to this famous food joint last day. Ordered their Chicken Cheese Parantha, Honey Chilli chicken Wings, Achari Lassun chicken Wings, chocolate parantha and raabri badam lassi. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Chicken cheese parantha was yum!
I loved the Honey Chilli Chicken Wings even though it was a bit on the sweeter side. 
The kheer badam lassi was thick and lip-smacking! 
The chocolate parantha needs a special mention!! The idea of Stuffing the parantha with brownie is out-of-the-world!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I loved loved loved it and any kind of appreciation will be too small for it. 
But we did not quite like the Achari Lassun Chicken Wings. It was a bit salty but was definitely edible. The toffee they served in the end was tasty too! 


The staffs were really nice to us! We loved the interior decoration a lot! The kadhai used as a sink, the kettle used to serve the bill are some great ideas! Lovely place. Lovely vibe. üòç

Old Delhi charm within Kolkata, that's how you can sum up this place. I have been to the actual Parathewali Gali in Chandni Chowk and trust me though the food there is good by its a really shabby place. Cut to our very own cities Parathewali Gali, has the same taste and with a better ambience. We orderd the Classic Aloo, Chane Ke Dal and Dhania Peyaz Parathe, Chicken wings and Badam Rabri Lassi food was good, and really brings back memory of my stay in Delhi. If you are not worried about the carbs this place is a must visit.

I would recommend you to try this restaurant if you're a fan of North Indian cuisine... Delicious parathas,I must say,we tried achari and dhaniya Mirchi...Both were equally good,a great place to go out with friends.. Coming to the ambience...Not bad I would say... Behavior of the staff is good...I would say this restaurant is a bit different and you can surely try it once.

Flamboyant decor. Pocket friendly. Had the best paranthas *_*
Chocolate parantha n cheese chicken parantha are the must tries.  Coming to the chicken wings. Had both honey chilli n rasun achari but I loved honey chilli over the achari one. Now coming to sweet tooth, had badam rabri lassi. Its heavy n equally mouth watering.

The chicken and cheese parantha is just amazing because if the sheer amount of cheese. They have wide and unique variety of paranthas and their tastes do live up to their name. The price is reasonable and people from North who miss the delhi wale paranthas do need to try this place.

Unique and a new concept.... perfect 'punjabi' theme with a suitable cultural decor.... any festive occasion can lead you to this place.... staffs are well and good to help you with your taste buds and the food needs no comments.... fabulous delicacy.... we ordered for chicken masala and dhania paratha which just melted into our mouths adding for extra appetite! Mustard, lasooni and the chilly honey chicken just gave me shiverings with dahi to look after your digestion! The badam rabri lassi one full glass can tackle your tummy wid just two sips to finish your eatings in a quite smooth form.... moreover u can have the feeling of having a mini Punjab here in Kolkata itself! Very pocket friendly!!!! I would like to go again and again!!!!!!

We ordered parathas from this joint today through Swiggy. The parathas were chilli garlic, chicken cheese and achari chicken. They were well stuffed succulent and soft. Special mention must be made of the yummy chicken cheese paratha. The price was also reasonable. My only grievance is that they didn't provide the curd and the pickle with the parathas even though we specially asked Swiggy for them. Dunno whether this was an oversight of the eatery or the delivery system.
Would love to visit this food joint. The decor looks very interesting.

If anyone wants to have a dilliwala meal, you can have it in here. They serve all kinds of paratha starting from spices to chocolate with great taste in it. The ambience will give you some fun facts about India and some fantastic snapshots captured. The only thing that dissapointed is their service as they are very unorganised in serving. Thumbs up for a quick dinner!!

In one word... too good. Please come if you are a paratha lover. You will find various types of paratha here and guess what!! Not at all expensive. The best one is chicken cheese paratha. Ambiance, decor and warm hospitality add extra brownies for the eatery. Do visit after a hectic day for the home made parathas and I am sure you will be delighted.

Parantha Wali Gali is about 5min walk from Rash Bihari Avenue. I never knew Parntha could taste so well untill i visited here. The ambiance was good. Wooden table and chair beautifully painted.
So coming to the food directly.
Chicken and Cheese Parantha here is a must try. The best of their making. Chicken stuffed inside the Parantha with cheese. Excellent to taste. 
Next we had the Chicken wings comes in 4 piece and very good. Their presentation was attractive. The Chicken came in a metal box.
The Chicken Keema Rice we took next. It was also very tasty.
Prices are very reasonable.
Service is good.

I was really excited for my visit to Paranthe Wali Galli, as this was a new outlet from our very own Mr Rahul Arora, who is also maintaining two outlets of our ever favourite Bon Appetit and Cafe Pranah.

The ambiance of the place is really worked upon well, a wall full of pictures, a wall full of quirky quotes, and the decor is also pretty cool.

On my first visit I really enjoyed the Cheese Mushroom Paratha, and the Chocolate Paratha, and their Rose Gulkand lassi and was looking forward to visit again soon.

I visited again on 26th January, when everything was looking unhygienic, the staff was not very cordial, and the food was not well prepared. I may of not mentioned a bad experience after a good one as there can be some bad days, but after having things here, I had an upset stomach, so thought it important to bring this to the notice.

Located near sai baba mandir in desapriya park , this vibrant place is a real eye-catcher. Decorated like a funky dhaba  with all good vibes in it. We, group of five, went there on saraswati pujo and managed a place pretty easily. We ordered chicken cheese parathas , chicken chettinad and mustard chilly chicken along with masala thumbs up. The food was delicious. Beautifully presented , the parathas were tender and juicy , mustard chilly has a ' bangaliana ' in it , but chicken Chettinad definitely stole the show. And pocket pinch was also not much. Definitely recommended.

Tiny little place decorated like a dhaba, very vibrant very colorful.. reminds you of THE paranthe waali gali in Purani Delhi. 
The place is brightly lit unlike most restaurants these days. The decoration is interesting and very catchy. It's been decorated with colorful bangles, utensils. The color pop glass door just adds to the vibrant image of the place. It also has extremely funny Hindi quotes hung up on the walls which are quirky enough to grab one's attention. 
We had tried the chhese chicken parantha, Cheese mushroom paratha, chocolate paratha and honey Chicken wings. 
The parathas were amazing with generous amount of cheese. Served hot and service was prompt. The chicken wings however was a let down but I'm ready to let that go since the paranthas were top notch.
Pocket pinch is reasonable which is a bonus. 
Would love to visit is again! üòä

Located in the bylanes of deshapriya park this is a gem if you want to eat some hot parathas and a glass of lassi. A bright and colourful theme, it's vibrant and cosy. The walls adorn some quotes which are such Indian thingsüòù . Coming to the food we ordered cheese chicken paratha after reading a lot of good reviews abour it, cheese garlic paratha,pahadi paneer paratha, mootichor lassi and masala thumbsup. The chicken cheese paratha was indeed a good one. Stuffed well enough with shredded chicken and cheese. Cheese garlic paratha was a bit salty for me though. Pahadi paneer paratha was okay with paneer and lots of masala. Indeed a good one to try if you like paneee. Mootichor lassi was the star. With right amount of sugar,it wasn't that heavy but at the same time very refreshing. Usually the masala thumbs up that I had in other places had too much masala in it which made the taste not so good. But here it was just perfect. The staffs are good but needs a bit training. Overall it's a good place to satisfy your paratha cravings.

This is a hidden gem in the bylanes of Desapriyo Park. I couldn't stress more on how authentic an ambience this place has. This place has a beautifully done dhaba ambience, with beautiful props all around. You will have to be there to feel it. The staff, though amateurs, are warm and courteous. And the place is a real steal with very low prices compared to the quality and quantity of food provided. Now coming to the food - we ordered the garlic chicken Parantha, honey chili chicken wings, garlic paneer Parantha and the motichur lassi. All of these are authentic Punjabi delicacies and taste absolutely delicious. A special mention must be made of the honey chili chicken wings, with its unique and delicious taste. This place is a must-visit.

Went here with two other friends.
Really liked the d√©cor. We ordered one classic aloo, one gobhi aloo, one chicken curry with white rice and one Motichoor lassi

Truth be told, I was disappointed. The paeaNthas were made of atta and there wasn't any ghee or butter slathered on top (like I had expected, given the price and 'Punjabi' tag)
The thickness of the ParaNtha is also nothing to write home about.
The chicken curry and rice tasted quite good.
The motichoor lassi was okay in taste but really good in quantity.
The extreme sourness of the two condiments, namely the house pickle and the curd was a shock to my palate.
Also, had expected a little extra than what mum makes at home.
Not going back.

Coming to the food, we ordered 1. Chicken cheese parantha , 2. Chicken chawal 3. Gur ki lassi & 4. Hajmola lemon tea , everything was too good, parantha was soft , flavourful, chawal was awesome, the lassi was well balanced & not too sweet, lastly the hajmola lemon tea was very refreshing but I think the price of it is a little on higher side, you only get a small cup of tea for 59 bucks ..  the bill came in a cute colourful tea kettle with masala candies .. 
Overall experience was very good ... You should definitely try this out ..  üëåüëåüëåüëå

Paranthe wali galli topped our wishlist right from the day it opened.After going through each picture and review given on Zomato for what feels like ages,finally our tastebuds turned out to be lucky today.
So coming to the point,
Ambience : A li'l colourful and vibrant joint with handpicked bangles,pretty pictures clicked by the owner himself and unmatched warmth radiates the perfect Dilli vibes.A complete 10/10 for the hues and quirk.
Food : 1.Chicken Cheese Parantha : One bite and the melting cheese and spiced shredded chicken lifts you straight to heaven.9/10.
2.Pahari Paneer Paratha : A good one. 8/10.
3.Tandoori Chicken Wings : *Think of all the positive adjectives that can be used to describe a yummazing dish* English dressed chicken wings baked to perfection with tandoori masala. 
4.Motichoor Lassi : The first sip will soothe tip to toe in a way you've never been soothed before,I bet. üòç
The paranthas are served with dahi and onion pickle.
The food contains the least oil and the highest taste quotient.The food has a complete homely feel üíú
Certainly going back to tick off the whole menu card.

Service : The service was pretty fast but the staffs need to work on their skills.
Overall a great experience. ‚ò∫

Paranthe Wali Galli popped up into my search feed and after looking at the menu, I thought to give it a try. Today I had lunch there and thankfully I gave it a try. 

Paranthe Wali Galli is located on the lane beside Monalisa Guest House. It is a small and sweet place to dine. The decor is bursting with colours everywhere. Bangles, pictures and dough rollers are use creatively to decorate this place. Automobiles lights in the ceiling make Paranthe Wali Galli well lit.

The menu is great. I had aaloo parantha. It came with a bowl of yogurt and an amazing onion pickle. The parantha was hot, full with potato fillings. I also had chicken masala parantha, and my Gosh, it was finger licking good. The sweet lassi was chilled and refreshing. I really recommend this place to all the foodies.

This place is just perfect to go whenever you feel solid craze of gulping hot, soft, buttery parantha that melts in mouth. We went there nearly 11 in the morning and found they have almost all kind of paranthas in their menu you can ever think of. We settled for cheese aloo and cheese mushroom parantha with chaas.
Coming to decoration they tried to set up a colorful Delhi street food kind ambience and that was nice. They don't have any side dish in their menu.

The service was fast. Tastewise both the paranthas were awesome. The chaas could be a little less salty otherwise it was also good. Another interesting part they offer some kala khatta logence as mouth freshener with the bill.
Would definitely love to go there again to try some new paranthas.

Paranthe Wali Gali takes you down the memory lane,Packed in a small room with the wooden benches planted orderly except the quirky color combination in quite Bon Appetite signature style! 
As the name suggests, they serve quality fast "desi" food and God!! they have a wide range of paranthas to choose from!
We had-
- Pahadi Paneer Parantha- Bland. A bit disappointing.
- Cheese Garlic Parantha- A perfect combination with the smell of cheese permeating the air. Tastes best with yogurt accompanying it. Must Try!
- Motichur Lassi- An odd twist to the desi refreshment drink and is indeed a must have!
Overall, the prices are quite reasonable and service is fast!

This is a very new restaurant and I was keen to visit it mainly because the interiors attracted me a lot.
And when I saw this restaurant in real,it seemed even more prettier and the food here made me fall for it.
The prices are very reasonable.
We had a chicken keema paratha which was served with pickled onions and dahi.Tasted superb.
Then we had Chawal aur chicken which came in a tiffin box.The chicken tasted very nice.
The motichoor lassi is love.
There are lots of options of paratha stuffings for both veg and non veg lover.
Staffs are friendly.
Surely,this restaurant has a long way to go.

Paranthe Wali Gali was on my wish list from long and today I finally paid a visit there. And I can say it was satisfactory.
So here are the things I had and can tell about them to you.
‚Ä¢ Lasun Paratha : Well I didn't order it. They brought it to me by mistake. This was average. Didn't like it much.
‚Ä¢ Chicken and Cheese Paratha : This one is excellent. Shredded Chicken with Cheese layer inside a paratha. You must try it here.
‚Ä¢ Keema Rice : Rice with Onion and Kemma Chicken in a layer above it. Taste was good.
‚Ä¢ Lasun Wings : This was again wonderful. The dish came in a steel Box. Had 4 pieces of Chicken Wings with lot of Lasun below. Moderate spicy. Bit sweet. I liker it.
‚Ä¢ Masala Thumsup : A 200ml bottle of Thumsup in the regular masala with few cubes of Ice. Good to have with food.
.
Overall experience was good. Service was average but the person who attended us was polite.
And value for money is exact.

After receiving fantastic feedback from all over, finally got to visit this place for a late lunch. Locating the restaurant was pretty easy as it is very near to Lake Road CCD.

The decor is very vibrant and impressive, starting from the entrance. Yellow, Red and Green are the dominant colours. A funky street like getup is given with simple accessorization using pictures, tassels, rolling pins, decorative kettles. The sitting arrangement consists of wooden benches and tables. The utensils are primarily made of steel, to recreate the street food feeling. Even the cheque came attached to a decorative kettle.The staffs were courteous and helpful. The kitchen being right beside the sitting area with no door in between, the place becomes a bit noisy with the chatter of the waiters, however I'd overlook that as this place is recreating street food experience.

Coming to the food. The cheese chicken parantha was delicious. It came with the accompaniments of curd and pickle. Heavenly experience. The parantha was stuffed perfectly, and not an extra droplet of oil dripped from the parantha. The Mango lassi felt delicious for the first few gulps, however with passing time, it appeared to be too sweet for my taste. As they are using synthetic mango syrup, which already contains sugar, extra sugar could be just chucked off. I ended my lunch with a starter (mainly to cleanse my palette off the extra sweetness). The dish was chili-honey chicken wings, and it was served in a beautiful mini stainless steel chest. The preparation was tasty, however the honey was predominant, could barely feel any chili.

Would have given a 4.5 if the flavor balance in the various dishes were spot on. A 4 as of now. Recommend.

Location: Not very difficult to find but i would still suggest one to take help of google maps. 
Otherwise just keep walking straight from monalisa guest house towards the petrol pump and then take the left after it. Keep walking straight and you will find this cute place on your right. 
Ambiance: loved the decor and the wall hangings with funny sayings. Table, chairs resembled that of a dhaba only more colorful and cleaner! 
Food: Lets just be straight and say the paranthes are to die for. There are loads of option so just explore. I personally have tried 5.. but my favs were mushroom cheese (veg) And dhaniya mirch chicken (non veg) . The lassi's are great too. Basically this will easily become a hangout joint of me and my friends just like bon. A plate of parantha can surely fill your appetite. 
Special mention to the toffee served at the end of our meal surely brings back childhood memories!
Great place for both lunch and eveninh snacks. 
A big thumbs Yum! üëçüèº

They live up to their name of bringing the freshness and the quirkyness to our taste buds. Writing about you guys makes me realy happy because its food from the heart and the soul.Do not count the calories just dig in...This small joint is what I have heard a new venture from the makers of Bon apetite .They serve 40 types of savoury parathas and some sweet as well.I wish i could have just taken a bite from all of them at one go twirling around.Nevertheless i was lucky enough to try the chicken cheese paratha,the cheese paratha and the keema chawal.There is an side of a very tangy chutney that accompanies the thali of that delicious paratha wd a dollop of butter melting.Its reminds me of the delhi mornings of my childhood,the glow of dat melting butter right under my nose as the sun came up.The keema chawal is served in a steel tiffin box and the motichoor ki lassi right next to it..The frothy thick lassi is enough for one meal.The decor is quirky with pictures and wall decorations made of glass bangles and amusing ne liner cutouts.The staff is very polite and catered to all our needs.The bill came in a vibrant painted "ketli" bringing an end to my perfect evening.Well done guys

Finding This place was quite an adventurous for me.. as I was at kalighat with my friend and we decided to try out a new place for desserts . . 
And then after referring Zomato.. I got through this new place Parantha wali Gali.. near deshapriya park! Near to Monalisa hotel.. where the movie Kahani was shoot!

This place had such funky interiors.. bangles.. and all such Punjabi type stuffs will remind you of Delhi.. the stewards were quite knowledgeable and helped alot in suggestions!

Their menu has got many varieties of parantha.. both veg nonveg .. paneer dhania sattu Allu cheese and what not!

So as I said I was their for desserts so.. couldn't resist myself from ordering chocolate parantha. . which reminded me of Chocolate pizza rather.. 

Then we had paneer meva parantha.. which was parantha stuffed with paneer and dry fruits.. tasted brilliant!

We had floating ice cream which was okay.. infact a bad experience!

The most beautiful end was having classic avalanche.. wow it was beautiful 
Brownie and chocolate vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate sauce.. this one sure made my visit a worth one.. as dessert was on top of the list...
Loved the way they served those kala khatta toffee in d end . . Quite affordable 
And good service.. music and ambience!

A perfect adda place with frnds..

Located in southern avenue.. very difficult to locate as the board due to the way it's written on their board. The concept and food both are good in quality and to taste..

We ordered Sattu parantha, cheese aloo paratha, Thai chilli paratha and Baden Dabri lassi which was quite filling. 

On the negative side the place is very very small and not meant for a group of more than 4 ppl.. The qty of curd given along with paratha is too small which is not enough for a full paratha and expected more varieties of pickles, they did not have any choice apart from onion pickle which isn't my choice.

Overall a good concept..

Lovely ambience, a delectable range of paranthas (both veg and non veg) and some hospitable service makes the #ParantheWaliGali in Kolkata a must visit. Paranthas apart, their range of lassis, skewers and rice items deserve a dig into. So look no further. Paranthas you crave for, head to this Gali near Deshapriya Park :)

The name is as Delhi as it can get. The restaurant is located in southern avenue, which has become this hub of great restaurants now. Its inside a lane, so it's a bit difficult to locate. Had heard a lot about this latest venture of "bon appetit" and it surely does live up to its name.

----------
----------
We had the "basic aloo paratha" , "phuchkizza", "anda pocket" and "rajma chawal". All the dishes were amazing. The place is air conditioned with very well behaved and attentive staff.

Phuchk-izza : decided to have this dish after reading some reviews on Zomato. It's everything other than your regular phuchka. Its like a phuchka made love to a pizza and how!! You can taste the sauce, the olives and jalapenos and cheese oozes out from the phuchkaas. I loved this dish... Though it was a bit too tangy for my friends taste..I absolutely loved it. 


Aloo-ka-paratha : I didn't enjoy this as much. It was very plain... Like the ones we usually have at home... But maybe that's the point. It's for people who don't like to experiment much with their food. The taste was good and the quantity is just right.

Anda-pocket : This was also a highly recommended dish by my fellow foodies. This paratha absolutely stole my heart. It was spicy and tangy and also had a beautiful flavor of egg and masala. It's called an anda pocket because a mixture of egg with masala and chillies is poured inside the paratha. Don't be afraid when I say chillies... It's not that spicy. 

Rajma-chawal : In other words, the comfort food. I love my ghar-ka daal chawal and so I decided to have it here as well. They serve this in a steel tiffin boz. It comes in two varieties, one with brown rice as the chosen "chawal" option and the other one with white rice. The rajma is served on a bed of rice that's already fried and flavoured with coriander and other spices... With generous dollops of butter on top. It's greasy and tasty and it's comfort food for the soul.

I wanted to try out some other dishes as well like the chocolate paratha and chicken keema paratha as well some other time. I plan on visiting this once again.
The staff was kind enough to guide us through all the dishes and suggest us some of them. A bowl of curd and achaar was given as gratis with every paratha. And we could have as much as we wanted. The decor of this place is very quirky and has a bit of a dhaba feel to it.. you are transported to a part of North India.  

Do give this place a try. I hope you find it amazing too!
Cheers! ‚úåüçª

Just tried out the Chicken Cheese Parantha from this new joint - totally loved it! A tad bit overpriced maybe. Ordered 1 plate (serving 1 parantha) for lunch - since I am not a heavy eater, but now craving for something more.
Pocket pinch:
INR 129 + Vat + Delivery Charge
(total = INR 179)

Till now I've been to Paranthe wali gali once and had take away twice and all three times I was superbly satisfied. The place might be a bit difficult to find given the location but Google maps are always there to the rescue ;) It's a little comfy place done up in a quirky decor with classic pictures, belans , glass bangles and what not. They have benches as chairs and dhaabe wali tables and the colours instantly light up your mood. Now coming to the paranthas. Till now I've tasted 7 different types of their paranthas which include classic aloo, cheese mushroom, chatpata paneer, masala chicken, achaari chicken, chilly garlic chicken and dhaniya Mirch chicken and I loved all of them. The paranthas are really light on the stomach, non oily and stuffed plentifully. Their lassi's also deserve special mention and I've tried the chanch and the strawberry lassi and both were really good and not those runny types that we get normally. The only thing left for me to try are their chicken wings, which I've heard are also really good. So overall a must visit place for all you parantha lovers and for anyone else who is willing to try something different for other than our regular Indian or Chinese food.
Happy Dining Peeps :)

Located at the Lake Terrace road in Desapriya Park.The walls of the restaurant were amazingly done and you could feel that its a part of the Bon Appetit cafe.They serve forty varieties of paranthas along with few more kebab and rice dishes and lassis.

We Ordered : Chicken Chili garlic parantha,Chettinad Chicken wings,Keema Chawal and Chocolate parantha.

Wings was served inside a metal box wrapped in aluminum foil.4 pieces of chicken wings were soft,juicy and beautifully flavoured with chettinad spices which wasn't overpowering.
The parantha was cooked in very less oil and was very tasty with ample amount of chicken stuffing in it.It was yummy.They serve pickles and curd complimentary with the parantha.
Then we had keema chawal which came in a steel tiffin box.Minced chicken cooked in a mild spicy curry and served on the top of rice.It was decent not great.
At last came the chocolate parantha and it was delicious with huge portion of chocolate,choco chips and Chocolate syrup on it.

Service was bit slow but the staffs were very friendly.Prices are also reasonable.
Will definitely visit again to try out their other paranths.

How have you been? I know the look on your face right now and I know exactly what you are thinking. Yes, I could have¬†called or even whatsapped but it‚Äôs been ages since I‚Äôve written a letter so¬†here I am, doing it the old-fashioned way. Can you believe that it‚Äôs been more than 10 years since those days in Delhi? The 9 a.m classes, the trips to Kamla Nagar to buy cotton fabric, the excursions to Gwalior and Sariska,¬†catching up at Khan Market, watching movies, momos and fruit beer at Dilli Haat and so much more. Remember how I used to pester you to take me to Chandni Chowk? To the famed Paranthe Wali Galli? You guys used to constantly talk about the amazing food that you get there and I would be salivating even thinking about the paranthas. I was in Delhi¬†for two years and you did not get the time to take me there. Well, guess what? We have a Paranthe Wali Galli now in Kolkata too and there, you get 40 types of parantha and 15 types of lassi!¬†Yes, close your mouth now.

Ordered three parathas from this place today through Swiggy - a Mooli paratha, an Aloo Methi paratha and a Gobi Paratha. Loved the taste of each one of them. They were hot and delicious. Very sensibly packed and marked. They are accompanied by curd and a mango-onion pickle. It was fun.

I was so disappointed :(
Wanted to end the year with a great lunch but that didn't happen!!
Since the past few days there has been such hype about this new place that I really wanted to visit.
My friend n I entered the restaurant at 3 ( its little difficult to find since it's a very small place n not many ppl in the neighbourhood know about this place)
Coming to the food...
I had already decided what to order before even stepping in.wanted to have chettinad chicken wings but unfortunately it wasn't available rather none of the chicken wing items were available!! Sad!! Had Thai chilli corn paratha ( good) n mango lassi ( very good) that's it!
Place is very small. It was noisy too.
But deserves one visit!
N if I visit the next time hopefully all the items in the menu will b available! :/

Location : 2 min walk from Sai Baba Mandir Deshapriya park.

This was my 2nd visit to the place and was very very dissapointing.  
1stly,  the seating are very uncomfartable.
 Then
We ere not informed about the insufficient stock of cheese and mushroom.  
So we had to change our orders to 
Aloo achari parantha,  chicken achari parantha , Classic Gobi Parantha. 
Aloo paranthas we nothing special .
Chicken Achari parantha was decent. 
Gobi Parantha was ridiculous. Very bad. Gobi were not fresh and the quality of parantha was too bad.  
Lassi -
The drinks were still good.  
Strawberry lassi - tasted good but very sweet.  
@Pan lassi - Nothing good. Tasted dull.  
The honey Chicken Wings was again very sweet for anyones taste.  
Lastly, the Service
I haven't came across this inattentive and bad service in my recent times. 
The place is total dissapointment.

Inaugurated on 1st December, 2016 this place is already picking up the pace.. Tried masala chicken paratha and dhaniya chicken parantha with chettinad chicken.. Rose gulkand and mint chhanch were a pleasant delight.. The filmy dhaba decor, including bangles, latkans, wall plates and abstract photos on the walls added to the ambience! The staff were cordial and service was quick.. Overall a filling meal, worth the money you pay for!

Located in the lane beside monalisa guest house it is a small place,at first u may even pass by without even noticing.But the interiors are done very tastefully and the decor is so vibrant and colourful.Even the food was exceptionally good.had motichoor lassi,phuckizza,chettinad chicken wings,rajma chawal and in paranthas we had cheese chicken,chilli garlic chicken,dhania chicken,achari paneer and chocolate one.cheese chicken was the bestm of the lot..an ultimate delight for cheese lovers.dhania murg and chilli garlic chicken were also amazing.but the achari paneer parantha had a dominant achhar flavour and it was okayish.now the chettinad chicken wings highly satisfied our tastebuds and left us longing for more.it was the star of the meal.motichoor lassi was good ,it had a bit of sour taste and was thick..others liked it but not something i would like to have again.chocolate parantha was also heavenly..loved it to the last bit..it even had brownie as the filling of the parantha.overall had a gala time and would like to visit again.Only sad part is at last they didnt give us their trademark ' jhaal lojens' which they usually give with the bill instead of the ' mouri'...as they didnt have it in stock.üòîBut kudos to their plating ideas..starting from 'steeler tiffin suitcase to dabba ' they have used it all.even their basin where you wash your hands is a kadai and some chairs are 'steeler baltis ' turned into seat!
P.s.they only charge vat on the gross amount and no service charge.

A little bit difficult to trace if someone doesnot belong to South Kolkata. But after entering the funky punjabi joint,one can uplift the mood üòâ Being an initiative of Bon Apetite, the decor is obviously something that will catch ur eyes! The eatery is not so large but cosy . Staffs are cordial and helpful.
Its even better when such an ambience perfectly match with your tastebuds. Foods are really tasty. I am not a parantha lover, still I wud highly recommend this joint. We ordered Cheese mushroom parantha which was just melting in our mouth unanimously, Achari Chicken Parantha was also good with the dominating achari flavour..But to me the best was Chilly garlic chicken parantha..u wont need any other side dish with these thats the best thing!
Then we had hajmola lemon tea , tulsi chai ( dint get much tulsi fragnance though) and special coffee.
We really liked the kettle in which they serve the bill .

**A note to the management**
We would love to see its branch in Salt Lake for mass access!

Paranthe Wali Galli is a very famous lane in Chandni Chowk, Old Delhi which has small eateries/shops that sell almost all the combinations of Paranthas one can think of!. Today, the creator of Bon Appetite and Cafe Pranah brings to us the most celebrated Delhi Parantha Galli in Kolkata - Paranthe Wali Galli (the restaurant).So being an ardent fan of ¬†North Indian Cuisine, we decided to visit this new place on a fine Sunday evening and were delighted to be there!

If one travels from rashbehari to deshapriya, the place is situated in the third lane on the left after taking a right at the deshapriya crossing onto sarat bose road.¬†
The decor is quirky and this venture by the owners of Bon Appetite score high on ambiance.¬†
We ordered

1. Cheese Chicken Parantha- The star of our meal. Reminded me of the cheese parantha served at the sister outlet. The stuffing was generous and the cheese piping hot. It was served with dahi and achaar

2. Chettinad Chicken Wings - The wings were crunchy yet succulent. The flavours were well balanced. However it tastes nothing like authentic chettinad chicken. The dish should be promptly renamed. However I can keep going back just for these wings. They were served in a cute metal box.

3. Kaju Badam Parantha- With milkmaid on top and filled heavily with kaju, this was a sweet affair. This dish needs more milkmaid on top or something liquid to gulp it down. It is very heavy and a little difficult to finish.

The staff is hospitable and extremely friendly. The bill for two of us was 455/-.

Being a paratha lover we had to try out this place as it also reminded me of old delhi. We started with the most innovative item named puchkizza..it was amazing. We then tried various types of parathas like classic aloo, paneer , gobi,motichur, and chicken cheese.. all of them were cooked in very less oil and were very tasty but the best of all the parathas was the chicken cheese. It was yummy. We then has rajma chawal which was great. They serve pickles and curd complimentary with any food u have. Thats great. Lastly we had the chicken wings which was superb. About the ambience..its a very cozy place and has really been done up well. Now I dont need to miss parathe wali gali of delhi as we have it all here. Cheers to the team of PWG..keep up the good work.

A sinful treat..

Started with phuchka bombs.. Dahi phuchka and phuchkizza

The phuchkizza was stuffed with salsa and finished with cheese and grilled

Chicken cheese paratha, gobhi paratha and dhaniamirchi chicken parathas were out of the world.

The Thai chilli corn paratha and the mooli paratha were not the same class... 

Laddu paratha was a surprise and a sweet one at that

Paranthe Wali Galli....the name itself is a magic and I could not have waited more to visit this place. It was a lazy Monday and there there is no quirkier a place to spend it. Though I was in a hurry I took the paranthas as a takeaway meal. 

The moment I stepped in the interiors grabbed my attention...the walls were amazingly done and I could feel that its a franchise of the Bon Appetit cafe. The first thing I ordered was the phuch-izza. As the same suggests...it's the taste of pizza in a phuchka and I have never tasted such a unique dish.

I ordered three types of paranthas- the classic aloo, cheese and garlic and anchari aloo...and trust me...when I had them for dinner....I bet nothing could have been yummier than those which was served with dahi and pickle.

Next time I promise to visit with more time in hand so that I can sit there and taste the desserts and take in the feel of the place.

Early closing is fine but at least make up with early opening, so that we can drop in for breakfasttttttttttttttt.

To all foodies, try all varieties, as each of them are good

This new venture from the franchise that owns Bon appetit cafe is dedicated to serving varieties of paranthas inspired from Paranthe wali gali of New Delhi.They serve forty varieties of paranthas along with few more 'hatke' dishes and lassis.The place looks so very colourful and the decor is quirked up with looks of dhaba.All those vibrant shades seen together is a mood lifter.

I came here with a friend this evening.We ordered a Dhania Mirch Chicken Parantha,Chettinad Chicken wings and Badam Rabdi Lassi.Food is served in steel plates maintaining the authenticity of serving Dhaba style food.

‚Ä¢Dhania mirch chicken paratha-Took it on recommendation of the server.There was no disappointment.Paratha wasn't too oily which is a plus.The filling was so full of flavours.The amount of chicken in it was adequate,there was right amount of heat from the chilli and aroma from the coriander..it was a well bound together dish.The accompaniments with it..yogurt(unsweetened) and pickle made the experience even better.

‚Ä¢Chettinad Chicken-We went a bit south from the galis of north with this choice.It was served inside a metal box wrapped in aluminium foil.The moment you lift the lid..the smoke coming out from the chicken and it's aroma will captivate your senses.And then you see 4 chicken wings with a lovely sticky glaze on them.The looks weren't deceiving.The chicken was soft,b beautifully flavoured with chettinad spices which wasn't overpowering.

‚Ä¢Badam Rabdi lassi-Perfect ending to a hearty Indian meal.Lassi was thick and had a good amount of badam and rabdi in it.Taste was fantastic.

Pocket pinch is very reasonable.Definitely the buzz this place has created is for right reasons.

This is a small joint (tucked in the lane after Jatin das road towards southern avenue) serving some damn exclusive type of (40+ to be precise) paranthas and 15+ types of lassi. I've tasted their Olive-Jalapeno parantha, anda pocket (egg stuffed inside one half-cooked parantha and finished) and classic aloo parantha. All the good, but I like the classic one most. For Lassi, I've tried the motichoor lassi and it was damn heavy (tasty though). For starters, I'd recommend their hajmola- lemon chai, and with parantha, ask the server for their in-house sweet saunf chutney (tastes a lot better). Go for this. Definitely recommended.

Well starting with the location, it was bit difficult for us to find, as this place is located in a small lane and it doesn't show up in google maps as well. Keeping this apart, as it is a part of the famous 'Bon Appetit' some of the chefs were from there as well. Coming to the food, it was mouth-watering, each and every item tasted so good.¬†
Ordered 'Cheese Aloo', 'Cheese Mushroom', ' Dhania Mirch Chicken', 'Rajama Chawal' and 'Motichoor Lassi'. The paranthes were as usual served with achar and curd and found a similar taste like the paranthes that are there at Bon Appetit, but overall it was worth going here.

Quite a catchy name for a restaurant, this place is located in the lane beside Monalisa guest house at Deshapriya park. The decor is very pretty with interesting wall hangings. About the food, I kinda didn't like the Dhania mirch chicken paratha, though it was a recommended one. But the Achari paneer paratha was quite tasty. And then, the chocolate paratha is a real treat for all chocolate lovers.
I feel one or two more varieties of pickle should be served with the parathas. Will visit again for sure, to taste the puchkizza.

Well the new bee which is creating loudest buzz in Kolkata is Rahul's Paranthas Wali Gali. Located in the lane preceding the lake CCD, this place with it's quirky decor and finger licking paranthas is something you foodies must visit.
The best fusion in food that i have witnessed of late are those puchkizzas , puchkas with pizza fillings, a sheer delight!! The hajmola lemon tea was really  refreshing.
Now coming to the paranthas, well ,tried 3 types of paranthas. 
An olive jalape√±o paratha which was innovative and tasty.
An egg wrapped aloo ka parantha which was bliss to say the least!!
The classic aloo ka parantha which was delicious to the core.
What made the paranthas all the more palatable were the condiments served along with them, especially the home-made sweet chutney that augmented the taste.
The motichur lassi was heavenly and a befitting conclusion to an ode dedicated to Indian food.
 I am eagerly looking forward to the next visit.

When one of your dear friends happens to be a very talented Chef and you‚Äôre a foodie it‚Äôs always a happy situation to be in. Rahul Arora is as passionate about food as I am, has already gifted Kolkata with Bon Apetite the Caf√© (Salt Lake and Hazra) and Caf√© Pranah (Ballygunge) both of which I frequent and wholeheartedly endorse. Naturally when he told me he was starting Paranthe Wali Galli I was thrilled. Having grown up in North India I am totally seduced by a good paratha and with Rahul at the helm I knew I would not going to be disappointed.

Being there in Northern part of the country for around 6 years has taught me to not to be shocked to see Parantha prepared with anything and everything¬†that is edible! I have had some weirdest and yummiest Parantha over there in Delhi and I am not talking about the parantha from the famous Paranthe wali Gali but the homemade ones. Well, now that I have mentioned the name of the iconic Parantha place; I have to mention that we now have a miniature of the same in the city of joy thanks to Rahul Arora. One fine afternoon (last week in fact) I received a call from Rahul ‚Äúsee I am going to share something confidential‚Äù( Errrrr why confidential and why me! I mean I know he can make some damn good cake and I have been there in Bon Appetite¬†several times but that has nothing to do with him! Okey he made Mehebub‚Äôs birthday cake and we had a riot over the last piece of that obnoxiously good cake at my¬†place but why he wanted to share something confidential with me!). However, what I finally understand from Rahul‚Äôs call that he has opened a place dedicated to Parantha in Kolkata and that is confidential!¬†Hmmm, what better can you expect from a Punjabi by the way (meanwhile in my mind; total ‚Äúladdu phuta‚Äù). Rahul‚Äôs call ended with a detail (a very important one in fact) that they will be having 40 types of Parantha there at Paranthe Wali Galli!

Location-Desapriya Park,Kolkata.

Though the concept has been derived from Delhi's paranthe wali gali but let me admit that the taste they serve is far more superior than that place.This place was bookmarked by us since we saw some pre-opening post on facebook and later on,its menu on zomato.We went to this place on 2nd day of its opening and were extremely satisfied with our experience at that place.The owner Rahul Arora along with his staff will leave no stones unturned to make your visit a delightful one.

Service-The service at this place was extremely fast and reliable.The owner and staff was really interactive with us during our whole plenary.They also recommended us some of their best dishes and we were with it .

Ambiance-The space at this place has been utilised very well.The interiors have been kept entact with the theme,especially those filmy slogans and colorful decoration which just adds to the beauty of this place.This place seats about 35-40 but the benches are too short in width which makes it uncomfortable to sit.

Food-As the name suggests this place mainly deals in both sweet and savory parantha along with some side snacks and dessert.We had-
1:Cheese Garlic Parantha
2:Achaari Paneer Parantha
3:Motichoor Lassi
4:Paan Lassi
5:Gulabi gulkand lassi
6:Puchkizza
7:Hajmola Lemon Tea

Among them the must try was "Cheese Garlic Parantha" and "Puchkizza".A lassi is sufficient for two but "Motichoor Lassi"still needs to be improvised.

Food-4/5
Service-4.5/5
Ambiance-4/5

Located at lake terrace nearby deshapriya , this joint has introduced a whole new concept in kolkata , the place is all about 'garmaa garam' heavy ghee paranthas with curd and pickle and thick lassis everything coming in stainless steel cutleries . The space is fairly small but has colourful dhaba style decor with red and green bench seatings and bright yellow lights and wall arts , looks like a slice of punjab in kolkata. Carry cash as there are not yet swiping cards.

We ordered one DHANIA CHICKEN PARANTHA something we loved , midly spicy , thus recommended. The other CHICKEN NAWABI PARATHA had a sweet taste not much liked by us. The PHUCHKIZZA were tad disappointing as 5 small phuchkas came with some 'chakna' stuffing with olives and cheese , for Rs 139 definitely noy worth a try. The sweet KHOYA GULKAND PARANTHA was basically a khoya stuffed parartha topped with kind of mithaimate , just a quarter of it is sufficient meet ones sweetness threshold. The MOTICHOOR LASSI is a treat for lassi lovers ,very thick and creamy with lots of motichoor . The pricing seemed a bit on the higher side though the food was qualitatively satisfactory.

Now few things to improve :

Looking at the present scenario and cash crunch ; till the day you dont get the swiping machine , a provision should be made to accept any other way of electronic money for example via paytm.

Secondly , a restaurant is either open for dinner or not. Indian dinner time is mostly from 8:30 to 10pm . And these people take the last order till 9 really makes no sense.

Thirdly , Few more options in pickles and/or chutneys should be made available. Eating all the parathas with the same pickle tastes monotonous after a while.

Paranthe Wale Galli is the newest restaurant from Chef Rahul Arora of Bon Appetit and Cafe Pranah. Team Hungry Hallows were proud to be a part of the grand inaugural meal. Located in Lake Terrace in the lane beside Hotel Monalisa, this place done up with wooden benches, pictures of Delhi‚Äôs Chandni Chowk clicked by the owner himself , humorous wall posters has a colourful and vibrant feel to it.

I had wishlisted Paranthe Wali Galli today morning and visited the place for dinner.
A small place where the space utilization is optimum and the walls are quite thoughtfully done.
We ordered:
1. Dhania Murg Paranthe : Adequate filling of chicken in the parantha, served with curd and pickle. Liked it.
2. Motichoor Lassi : Thick, heavy lassi with motichoor base. Liked it too. Sufficient for 2.
3. Puchkizza : Extremely dissapointing. 5 tiny fuchkas with some olive stuffing, tasted terrible. And this for Rs.139? Absolutely not worth it.
4. Khoya Gulkand Parantha : Too heavy this one. A sweet stuffing of khoya made this parantha quite tasty but after few bites, we did not feel like having it anymore.
5. Navaabi Chicken Parantha : This one was also sweet and tasted okayish. Nothing great about it.

Service: Good! They take the last order at 9pm (Too early) but we requested a new order at 9:30pm and after initial refusal, they obliged.

Price : Little overpriced.

Cute and cosy place.I went their with a friend and we tried Pander mewedar paratha and Dhania Mirchi Paratha.Both of them was lipsmackingüôÇ.I would suggest them to start accepting card.We also Chole bomb it was good but I think puchka items are overpriced.Rs 140 for 5 Piece is hell expensive.Hajmola lemon tea was perfect to complete the Meal.üòÉ

My recommendations would be the supremely comforting Aloo Methi Paratha, which is filled with a potato and fenugreek leaf mixture, flavoured with coriander, cumin, and ginger. The Achaari Paneer paratha is another hit - its for those who love paneer - perfect for sticking it in some plain yogurt before consumption. The Dhaniya Mirch Chicken would be my favourite from the non-vegetarian galore - its got a very pronounced flavour of coriander and lemon, and yes, it is spicy, so tread cautiously.

Paranthe Wali galli.. the name will attract everyone to go and taste their variety of paranthas. But let me tell you if u r a pure vegetarian i.e. Jain or Agarwal or any other then guys i dont think you can try their paranthas as they cook veg and non-veg parantha in the same pan. This was not acceptable for me, so we didn't tried their parantha. But yes we tried their mootichur lassi and it was super tasty. The taste was kinda blossom viz is mostly served in wedding parties.
Apart from the food, the interior was super creative. Every bit of punjabi thing was there. Its a small n compact place.
On the price side, it is pocket friendly.

I want to suggest Rahul Arora (the owner of Paranthe Wali gali) kindly look after the veg and non-veg cooking and try to cook veg n non-veg separately and instead of using paper glass, use steel glass for serving lassi.

Wow finally a place for Paratha lovers :) Just loved every Paratha we had starting from  Chilli Garlic Paneer, Cheese Garlic, Olive Jalapeno and Panner Mewedaar. All the Parathas were served with curd and onion achaar. Though I am lassi fan but was not able to taste due to cold but they surely suggested to have motichoor lassi. And then we had Golgappa without water and they were yummy - Chole Chatpate Bomb - really tasty they were. I had a hajmola lemon tea which was really refreshing. And then comes the dessert and you will be surprised to hear that I had Khoya Gulkand Sweet Paratha. It was heaven. Every Staff is very friendly and would love to help you according to your preference. Luckily Rahul, the owner was present there and it was great interacting with him and discussing about his vision about creating Paratha Wali Gali. You will find the place interior done very beautifully with ambassador lights, the whole colour is based out of two colours green and orange. All photos which are framed and put on wall are been clicked by Rahul himself. The place has its vibrance and food is very delicious. So a must go.

For once I shall be unapologetic about being openly biased. All my 'prefered' comfort foods at one place. Parantha combinations that guarantee a gastronomic high, lassis that fill up your senses more than the Annie's Song even. Do try the khajoor lassi, nawabi chicken parantha and it would be a crime to miss the motichur parantha for dessert. And the decor, kitsch heaven!!

Thanks Rahul, you are indeed a sweetheart.
Best wishes!
