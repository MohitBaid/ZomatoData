It was one of the most crowded outlet in CC2 Food Court and I was craving for some North Indian food to decided to check it out. Ordered Methi Mattar Malai and it was one of the best I had, exceeding the preparations of any authentic north indian restaurant also. We ordered a chicken dish too which was okeish. The Naan was made well.

Ever since I go to this joint to exclusively eat Methi Matar Malai and the 2 more times i went, they managed to make it as good as the first time. Shall post about other dishes as and when i try it. Value for money ofcourse as the quantity is quite decent.

Flavour's, though one of the most popular joints in the food court, City Centre 2 the standard of food here is very inconsistent. I have had their food from time to time. Sometimes they serve decent enough kebabs on regular prices and the next day they serve ice cold tandoori chicken. Haven't tried their biryani yet, the kebabs are okaish over all.

Their chicken tikka kebab is awesome also mugh reshmi kabab......infused with good wholesome spice.......but their tandoori roti is not up to the mark....that was the only thing that disappointed me.....

Flavour's is a part of the food court of the City Centre II, Rajarhat, so do not expect much regarding the ambience. It is just like your every other 'In mall food-court outlet'.

On the plus side - the rates are reasonable, Kabab platter is recommended and tastes good, the biriyani is above average. Do try the Kabab Biriyani to taste the best of both worlds. Staff behaviour is also good, have ordered multiple times on multiple occasions, nothing to complain.

On the downside - Apart from the kababs, nothing on the menu is worthwhile. Overall quality is good, but nothing extraordinary. Service is slow, if you order biriyani at lunch time rush hour, rest assured it would take 30 - 40 mins atleast.

Overall - it is cheap, easy on the pockets, so if you are out for a quick bite or just aiming to fill your stomach, definitely give this place a try. Go for kabab, steer clear from anything else.

Ordered a Reshmi kebab platter. They served chicken kebab which was too much salty with salad and green chutney. The entire dish was bit flat for me.

Service was however quite good bt won't cme back.

Certainly very below average. If you are a specialist in serving Mughali food, please atleast serve us food with proper spices. I had the one of the worst Dal Makhani- bland with overly boiled lentils and beans. Kadai Panner was totally reeling in oil while the butter naan was highly inelastic and chewy. The veg pulao served shouldn't be considered as food. Low quality semi cooked rice with dry peas. 

Certainly the management needs to take note of such low quality food being served which dissuades crowd  from coming.

Took their veg combo and the items in it - the paneer, the raita etc. - were extremely pleasant tasting. After a long day when one's hungry one can opt for their food once in a while when one's willing to eat at the food court of City Centre 2.

If you want to grab a quick bite before the movie you can give this place a shot. Located at the right corner for the Hang Out food court of City Center 2, Flavors offers Mughlai and Indian Cusine with a decent taste and cost. We ordered the Kadhai murgh, Butter nun and a Chicken Biryani. The Biryani was a bit too oily and ok in taste but the Murgh preparation was really good. A must try if you visit here. Service was quick enough.

Tried out their Chicken steak sizzler which was reasonably good.¬†Grilled fish with lemon butter sauce was something new, the sauce was really acidic and did wonders once it went inside the mouth.Baked fish was also pretty much up on the higher average although the seasoning was what they were lacking inOverall on the outset, a pretty decent eatery, with little value for money, when you are bored of the stupid food the office canteen suffices you with

Such a horrible experience I had here. All the stuffs are so rude to believe, including the manager himself. I just wished this restuarant to be closed as soon as possible, so that at least we can at least get a chance to have a better dining experience from some different vendor. I have been here for a couple of times and most of the time I have ended up with my stomach upset. Now, you can imagine how worse it is! They also try too fool you and simetimes charge you wrongly. So it's a BIG NO for me. I wished to give it a negative rating but Zomato didn't allow you to do so. So I am rating it the lowest. Now, go to this place at your own risk!

It is inside the unitech info space office buildings. Good quality is good but a bit expensive. Every weekend we try something or other as I work there so last weekend I tried chicken burger n believe me it was very tasty than kfc n Macdi. Then pasta is ok and North Indian also average. As a whole it's quite good n hygienic.

It is inside the unitech office premises.. Having 4-5 food counters.. Indian,Chinese , continental ,south Indian and Mughlai food... Also some dessert counters... I would recommend their keema platter, chicken stroganoff with spaghetti.. Spaghetti with meat balls, Baked fish and other Chinese platters are also nice... Only hope for the unitech going office people to have some good food..
