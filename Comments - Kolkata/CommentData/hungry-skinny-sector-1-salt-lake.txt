Ordered a bacon jam and it was quite amazing. A little too much sweet but you sort of like the aftermath taste. The cupcakes are amazing and it does taste like love!

Awesomest red velvet cupcakes with a surprise chocolate centre. I won't be trying the signature bacon flavored ones but sounds super interesting. Even the regular chocolate, nutella and vanilla cupcakes have been great. I wish this was a regular store you could just walk into!

Ordered the bacon cupcakes from her. Priced at 500 /- for 6 cupcakes, they are pretty reasonable. But after tasting, I can say that it was worth every penny! The cakes were soft even after few hours. The saltiness of the bacon and the sweetness of the cake went perfectly with each other! 
Do give it a try. 
Verdict : AWESOME!!!

I was looking everywhere in Salt Lake to make sugar free treats, but wanted them customised as I was gifting them to a very dear Aunt and Uncle as a way of saying thanks(they're diabetic, but love cupcakes). 
Dishari made two sets of amazing cupcakes- 6 chocolate and 6 coffee flavoured and they were simply yum! The whipped cream just melted in my mouth! Although, I made the stupid mistake of keeping them in the fridge so they were a tad bit dry. Her advice was to keep them at room temp before eating them! Otherwise the cupcakes were brilliant! :)

Dishari is so cool! She will take your order and you won't have to worry about anything post that. I requested her to make me her famous bacon jam and customised Manchester United cupcakes (red-velvet), pictures of which have already been uploaded by her. They were an absolute delight; the cupcakes were soft and tasted so delicious and the bacon jam was a really different experience as well. Not to mention, the way she decorates everything makes it so presentable. Her products make for really good presents! You can reach her at all times and she's willing to customise everything your way. This place is a definite must-visit!

I had ordered a set of 6 red velvet cupcakes after reading all the great reviews. Unfortunately for me, I received a box of squashed and trampled cake, that were in no condition to be consumed. I was shocked to say the least. It looked as if the cupcakes had been mishandled and dropped and then picked up again to be kept in the box. Complete negligence on the part of the delivery person. I immediately informed the owner about this who apologised profusely and said she'll personally hand over another batch of cupcakes without any additional cost. We decided on a day and place to meet. However, beyond that point, neither did she show up on the designated day, nor did she respond to my messages asking about her status. Extremely unprofessional and disappointing behaviour. Definitely never ordering again..

Hands down the best red velvet cupcakes i've had in a long time. This is surely the best there is in Kolkata. After trying these, a friend of mine very generously (god bless him) gave me a red velvet cupcake for free, which tasted even better than what I had here at Hungry & Skinny. I should have known better though, when I asked him where it was from, it turned out to be from Hungry & Skinny itself :)

We also tried the mini cheesecake cups - plain, strawberry, and nutella - which were all very very good as well. Can't wait to try out different things from this place.
