I'd give this place 0/5

Location - Right on the main road you just can't miss it 
The decor is dark and old you can see the owner family sitting  on the cash counter
 
Now coming on the food which  according to me is substandard 

Crispy Chilli baby corn-it was full of oil - felt like a oil bath of my mouth and had no taste or flavor and even the baby corns were soggy and not Crispy 

Peaking chicken- it's sauce was nice had a sweet and tangy taste to it but the chicken pieces were terrible it was full of fat(charbi) and when put in mouth it was pathetic

After these two I didn't feel like ordering any thing else

I am a regular visitor to this place , located on the EM bypass connector opposite to the large water body and on the side of Milan Mela .The location is bit awkward. 
The hotel is shabby and the ambience is quite on the down side . The worst part is the rest rooms and hand wash areas . 
It's a predominantly Chinese restaurant. I generally try with the fish chips , baby corn , chicken fry , mixed Chowmin , chilli and hunan chicken . The taste of the food is good and quite authentic. The quantity served is also sufficient. 
People who are interested in drinking can purchase a bottle and enjoy it at your will instead of buying at pegs .

If you are not very picky about swanky ambiance and besuited staff but value for money is your top priority then you may visit Fung Fa and you would definitely leave with a happy stomach and a happy wallet. 

Located on the main road right beside the huge Chinese gate, my first visit to Fung Fa was a couple of months back after almost a year of contemplation. 

They have a big area for stags and a small section on the left for family dining. The ambiance is minimal and might appear to be shabby to certain guests used to fine dining.  The stag area has a  tv which usually airs live sports. 

Over my several visits I have never been disappointed with the food. I have tried their Mandarin Chicken, Dragon Chicken, Lemon chicken, Chicken with vegetables, Crispy fried fish, veg spring roll and few other starters from the appetizer section. For main course I have tried their Cantonese noodles and Mixed fried rice. The only dish I did not like was the lemon chicken as it was tad too sweet for my taste. The quantity served is quite impressive for the price point

Alcohol is available by the bottle and again priced very reasonably (in fact cheaper than other restaurants nearby) 

The service is good. The staff is polite and happy to suggest chef's special items. For fish lovers - you can order Bhetki variant at a slight premium over the standard menu pricing. 

Over all I feel, Fung Fa is great for big college groups and boys night out drinking :)

The food was amazing especially the satay, Kung pao chicken and hakka noodles, but expect some improvements...

The location if this place is very good . Just on the bypass and easy to identify.  The ambience is ordinary. We ordered drums of heaven which was good. In main course we ordered gravy chicken chowmein and hakka chicken chowmein. Both the dishes was good and the quantity was also generous.
The price of the drinks was very low and the service was good.

Food : The number of options on the menu is really less. But whatever they have on the meny, they make it good. Dragon Chicken/Prawn remains my favorite. 

The noodles options are better than fried rice options.

No momos on menu!

Drinks: Fantastically cheap. Cheapest of any Chinatown restaurant. This place is a boozers paradise.
But options are limited to IMFL

Ambience: Minimal. The decor makes it look like a mess house rather than a restaurant. Not at all a place for romantic sojourns. Ideal place for friends to hang out. 
May look a bit creepy from.outside, but it's very female friendly. No bad stares, which is not the case about most cheap chinatown eateries.

But like most of the chinatown places, cleanliness is poor. Plates and glasses are clean, floora and toilet, not so much.

Music: None

Location: Amazing location. Just on the main road. If you are an Ola Uber guy, this place is an ideal choice rather than going deep inside chinatown

The quality and quantity of the food is fairly good compared to what the other Chinese restaurants in Chinatown serve. In the outskirts of the main Chinatown,it stills manages to bag the crowd with their simple decor and delicious Chinese food. Their Korean chicken stick and hot and sour soup is very good. Also,I personally know and have been Informed from an inside source that they serve fresh food as they buy fresh seafood and vegetables and meat everyday,which is always a plus point. All in all highly recommended.

This is probably the most well located restaurants in China Town, easily located while heading from Park Circus side towards Parama Island on your left just after the China Town gate. Food is okay. Ambience okay. Mostly common for liquor. Overall an okay bar cum restaurant in China Town.

I have been here a couple of times and I forgot to write a review about it each time. Let me now talk about this chinese restaurant, situated near the big chinese gate in tangra  ( close to science city )

The food price is really reasonable. It's pocket friendly and for alcohol lover, this is haven for you! I recommend cantonese noodles if you like gravy texture noodles. One section is a smoking zone and the other is none.

Would definitely bring my friends here. Thank you so much!

This place is located adjacent to the grounds of Milan Mela, at a stone's throw distance from Science City. It is at the entrance to Chinatown and offers parking space.
It is basically a cheap pub, which offers good food. To be fair, the atmosphere is quite family friendly, atleast during dayhours.
The food is commendable. Their specialities are Dragon Chicken and Honey Chicken. The former, is a dry chicken dish with a spicy, flavourful sauce, garnished with cashew nuts. It is amazing and very hot, so it is advised to ask them to tone down the spice. The latter, on the other hand, is sweet without being overbearing, and soothes the palate after the dragon chicken's spicy blast. The other items are quite okay.
The grumpy staff, and the depressing atmosphere dampen the dining experience, but the good food and cheap booze totally make up for them.
In all, a place worthy of visit.

Drinks comes in cheap price but the food is bad. Don't go there for nice foods rather go there to booze with friends when you have a tight pocket. it is not a restaurant it is a BAR.

Definitely match the billed items, there have to be a extra item added by them. 

Never Going to Visit there again.

Often, while driving back to New Town from the city from the Park Circus side, we drop into Fung Fa for a quick bite. We don't have to enter Tangra as this place is right on the Park Circus - Science City connector. Nice and secure parking is always available and during the day time we usually find the place almost empty. My wife and I had lunch there today (Sunday) at 2 PM and we were the only 2 people in the whole restaurant which is quite big.

Food is typically Tangra, as the restaurant is run by Chinese folk. Portions are generous and preparations are tasty. Today for the two of us we just ordered 1 Thai Soup and 1 Chinese Chop Suey and we were full. The bill came to ₹348. Real value for money!

Now this is one place I'm sure your eyes are gonna come across, every time you travel to Science City Kolkata.
The entrance is like the typical Chinese houses that I had found abroad and the parking area is dimly lit.
Belonging to the famous Chinatown of Kolkata the getup is quite decent.

This bar cum restaurant is one place where you can smoke up,drink and enjoy.As simple as that,it is pocket friendly also.

A hard day's work followed by some good whisky and snacks is more than sufficient that this place can provide.
Ambience is very noisy on weekends.Mid weeks are good enough for chilling out at this corner.
Lemon chicken and chilli chicken will always be there no matter how good or bad a Chinese restaurant you visit in Kolkata.

If you're looking for some pot belly diets then the Mein Foon and Kung Pau are a good option.
Pork dishes served here are a delicacy indeed.Chicken and egg are decent as well.

The biggest draw of this restaurant is the location.I'm sure you're not going to miss even the signboard also.
But this place has got a lot to catch up with specially when it comes to the food.
I'm sure you have better places to go to for a drink or two,until you are really penniless.

I had the misfortune of visiting this place once with few friends on a sunday evening for a drinking session. This place is very easy to locate, got sufficient place for parking.

Ambiance: nothing fancy, pretty ordinary, spacious...decor is zilch. They have tried something to give this place a chinese kind of a feel to it...pheww which flopped terribly, seating arrangements not comfortable.

Now coming to food, we ordered crispy chilly babycorn, dry chilli chicken, korean fish stick and red pepper chicken to go with drinks. Quality wise food was poor, except the korean fish stick and quanitity wise okayish, dry chilli chicken and crispy chilli babycorn was overcooked. Comparing the food quality this place is over-priced.
Waiters were well behaved but amateurs.
In my opinion, there are far better restaurants in Tangra area, hence not recommended.

It is basically for those going in a group for some lunch and dinner fun.  It is nothing great and doesnt have any exceptions. Has a family room which is appreciated.
Food here doesnt count much. Variety is lesser than the others located around. Many in the Menu, is not served. Has a shabby stink. Pocket-pinch is real high compared to the food quality. Look for better options !!

You must try the chicken fried rice here. It is the best among all the places I have eaten in at chinatown. It is just amazing and this rice itself made me go back for more. The noodles are good but then are not most of the good places in chinaown famous for their noodles, chicken and other dishes? 

The ambience is just average and nothing to be proud of. You can take people there and have a good time of course and you will simply enjoy the food there.

If you stay in Kolkata and need a new place to try, I suggest you go there!

This place is just beside the milanmela fairgrounds, so if you are hungry after a day of fair ground fiesta and love good chinese food be sure to drop in. The decor of this place is very predictable with lots of "Chinese" wall hangings and dragons and stuff but the place is dimly lit and stays dark even in broad daylight. The seating is very cramped together though most of the tables (there are plenty) remain empty most of the time.
The food served is very well made Chinese. Authentic and tasty. The portions are filling too. My favourites are the Hong Kong and Malaysian varieties of the chicken and fish. The fried rice has a nice smokey feel to it which i like.
The service is a bit slow but the waiters are decent enough.

this is the only restaurant I have been to, in the so called China Town of kolkata or the Tangra area (sadly, very sadly). This is more easily approachable as it is right over bypass opposite the science city. The restautant is spacious but not anything classy or very fancy about it. Does have a chinese/oriental feel to it (obviously! I know :) ) There are two sections of the restaurant ones the area you see right when you enter where its more a friend's place to dine and wine and another is like a family section to the left. Now the food here is darn good and very authentic. Try the crispy chicken gravy which isnt soaked in gravy but a semi dry dish with crispy chicken and a spicy gravy around it very yum and also the fried rice any of them is a delight and to go with it you could choose good old chilly chicken, dragon chicken etc. This place also has a bar so and it itsnt very highly priced. A must try if you love Chinese food :)

Regular over here due to courteousness of the staff. Specially of Subrata, the Stewart. Food is good. Must try their Dragon chicken and shezwan rice. Decor needs to be a bit more uplifted and the owner's behavior needs to be rectified. Booze is quite reasonable where you get peg wise and per bottle wise too. Overall, good place to feel like home due to the excellent courtesy by the servers and staff. Food - 8/10, Atmosphere - 5/10, Service - 9.5/10, Price - 8/10.
