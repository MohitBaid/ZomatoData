The quality of Chicken Biriyani and Mutton Biriyani is not so good. Thought of trying Biriyani from different restaurant, but disappointed with the taste of Biriyani.

Heard and read reviews of this place on Zomato . Ordered online today through swiggy . My order was chicken chap and tandoori roti . The chap was average and the roti burnt . Pic attached . Not a good experience at all . So many people has written good about this place even then my experience was bad . May be my bad luck . But one thing I know is that good places never serve burnt roti . I DON'T RECOMEND .

A good restaurant for biriyani lovers located at motijheel area, nagerbazar. On entering through the mughal style gate you will feel something special.
Though the restaurant is not big, they have utilised the place nicely. Ambience is simple and adorable.
The mughal style gate, chandelier, presentation of food everything justify the name 'mughal khan'.
Coming to the food. Menu card is small and simple having limited items. Non availability of desert like firni etc is a drawback for this type of restaurant.Anyway the main plus point of the restaurant is their BIRIYANI. I have had their MUTTON BIRIYANI. It was very nice. Rice quality was great. Not too oily or greasy. Potato was perfectly soft and tasty. And the MUTTON PIECE was one of the best. It was soft, tender, juicy and tasty. They didnot compromise with the size of the mutton.
ÇHICKEN CHAP: Unfortunately it was not good. The colour and taste of the gravy is different from usual CHANP which did not suit my taste bud. Also I did not like the use of artificial colour on gravy.
Staffs are friendly and helpful.
Reasonable price. Pocket friendly.
Conclusion: Cute little place for having Biriyani in a very resonable price.

Found it in zomato and thought to give it a try. Reached there at 12:15 and found it closed. After giving a call they opened at 12:40 and managed to provide us table within few minutes. We had chicken reshmi malai kebab and special chicken biryani. The kebab could have been better in taste. The biryani was fine. The space is very small but nicely decorated. Service could have been better. The price in menu is tax inclusive and reasonable.

Despite reading negative reviews about this place I mustered courage to order a special mutton biriyani from this place today and I must tell you the biriyani was worst than those sold in foothpaths of Dalhousie area.. Around 12.45 in the noon I visited their restaurant and the front shutter was down. The side gate was open and one of their staff was sneaking from that. I asked him if the place is closed today and he said that they are about to open and will take delivery order as fresh biriyani is being made some where else. I came back home and checked Swiggy and they said that the place is closed in the morning. However at around 1.45 they delivered the biriyani and as soon as I opened the container a stale smell of stale mutton and keora stuck me. anyways as i started eating it, I realised how fool i were to order fro them. The mutton was so hard that I had to cut it with a knife. The biriyani was full of oil and the stale smell of keora water was all over. As a biriyani lover I can tell this was not a freshly made biriyani. I would not suggest this place to anybody and will definitly write about it in all social media. The restaurant person called me from: 8240587270. They did not even provide a bill. A must avoid place and its much like the defamed India Lord restaurant.

What Dum- Dum needs is a couple of good places to dine in and new places like this fill this need. Located near the surer maath which is pretty famous by itself, this place has a "Mughal" feel to it.
Starting from the decor and ambience and the music playing to even the utensils make you feel like being in the mughal age. The service is prompt and courteous.
Coming to the food the mutton and the chicken biriyani hits all the right notes especially with the mutton chaap.  The chicken tikka kebab and the mutton boti kebab taste superb. The quantity of the food was pretty decent.
I would recommend all biriyani lovers to visit this place.

I just surprisingly went there for a taste change procedure. I found one offer from a website and went that restaurant. Very small and decent restaurant. I think 6 or 7 tables were there. I reach near 8 o'clock and found total empty. I ordered 2 mutton biryani for parcel. They give me water and I found nice hospitality at there. Now come to the biryani part. The taste is above average and the mutton pieces were little bit hard. Overall taste was good. I give them 3.5 out of 5 for the biryani.

The place was very good. The ambience and the background music reminded of the traditional mughal darbaar.the behaviour of the waiters was very  hospitable.the crockery in which the food was served and the interior carried with it the 'Mughaliyana'.
We ordered kebab platter, tandoori chicken, mutton biriyani and chicken chaap.
Kebab platter : 4 types of kebab was here each kebab was nicely cooked.bt l personally prefer malai kebab.
They sprinkle freshly chopped corriender leaves on
 the kebabs which enhance there teaste.
Tandoori chicken : nice and juicy. Pieces was also good.
Mutton biriyani : 1 plate was sufficient for 2 people. Biriyani was less spicy and can be easily taken by 8 to 80.the piece of mutton was solid.
Chicken chaap : the chaap was completely different from other places.it was just awesome. 
I want to go there again definitely.

After hearing a lot about them and as it is near my home, me and my friend decided to give it a try.Well first coming to the decoration and interior part, we were amazed by the ambience. Frankly speaking the decor was classy. Now coming to the food part, we ordered chicken reshmi malai kebab and special mutton biryani with green salad. The kebab pieces were really delicious and the mutton biryani was good too, with soft and succulent mutton pieces.Overall a very good experience for us, definitely going to visit again.

Mughaal Khan has bagged quite a promising rating on Zomato in a small span of time. Dumdum is in dire need of some good dining places and this one suits just fine. I ordered their Special Murgh Biriyani today. The biryani was really light, non-oily and the amount was quite generous. I liked the taste but I won't say it can blow the mind of any Biriyani lover. Though tastes just fine somehow the biriyani of Mughaal khan fails to have a taste good enough to linger on for times to come. I would love to visit the place in person and try their mouth watering kebabs in future.

After reading the reviews and descriptions from Zomato, and seeing the 'Hidden Gems' category went to Mughal Khaan with a high expectation. But it hurts when the expectation does not get fulfilled. Such a disappointment I had over there.
The decor and ambience was nice and it can be a precursor for the nawabi feeling too. But the food we had there were not so graceful.
At first there were no attendants to greet us. And just after entering the restaurant one attendant asked us that what will we take, he did not offer us any seat and make arrangement for five people in a four seater table. We did that ourselves!
However when we said our preferences he informed us that Biryani is finished. If we wait for 'some time' they can serve us. After waiting for 'just' 75 minutes when we have been served the Biryanis, it was not up to the mark though!
The rice was cooked with a plenty of oil and the piece of mutton was not so finely cooked. From the piece of mutton we got a bit of smell of raw flesh. And the side dishes Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala were not so impressive. It was garnished with dhaniapata, which was not suitable for the cuisine though. Only the Reshmi Butter Masala was the saviour for that day.
According to my view it can be a destination as an one time restaurant. But not for the connoisseurs.

Quite liked it for a first-timer. 
But I can't help but complain. 
Waiting for exactly an hour for your parcel even as you see people who are ordering after you but eating in the restaurant, getting their orders before you. That's simply not done. Same with people who order on swiggy, they get their orders first.
The food is tasty and the location is okayish but overall, from serving adequate amount to not charging VAT and anything extra, this place can be visited again. 
Reasonable price too, what more can you ask for?

First time from this restaurant. I ordered mutton biriyani only. Delivery part was okay, kind!

Biriyani was good, actually the rice part. Adequate quantity for a big Appetite. While the rice part, I liked it better than Aminia, but the meat was very disappointing. It wasn't a good piece (more of a big bone) and not at all tender! It was very very poorly tender!

There was very much less salt it in but can't complain it as I was asked by the delivery guy to add salt as per your requirement. Tho, for the aloo and meat, it was hard to get the right about of salt in every inch.

Lastly, I would have rated it 4.5, if it wasn't for the meat piece which ruined it all.

The mutton biryani was good.The quantity of the food was good but the taste could be enhanced more .The good point of the food was that it was not oily ,hence it is a must place of visit for the health conscious and people who wish to keep a check on their weight and cholesterol levels .The great part was the ambience and aesthetic and scenic beauty of that place ,it gave me a so called "Mughal feeling".The plates and glasses especially the chandeliers .A great place to visit.
Suggestions- the place can be more decorated with scriptures and other arts.
It's a great place and I hope everyone will become engrossed and delve deeper into the ancient ages of the Mughals .😊😊😊😊😊😊

Had some food ordered from this restaurant. Was overwhelmed by the softness of the naans. But, was very disheartened by the gravy dishes that I ordered.

The Chicken Tikka gravy seemed to taste like some other gravy (Maybe into Paneer Tikka Gravy) in which the chicken pieces have been forcedly dropped off, but to no avail, as the gravy tastes awful.

Next, the Chicken Biriyaani - You can very well say that the chicken is not cooked along with the rice. The rice seemed to have been cooked at least one day earlier.

Overall, good restaurant if you want to have Naans and Rotis, but the problem arrives when you look for side dishes.

I have read quite a few good reviews and set to try a special chicken biriyani a lil late at night and I must say I have done it right. The biriyani was less spicy balanced and chicken properly cooked and fitted to my requirement as iam mostly into veg food and hardly have nonveg and not used to having too much spicy rice or food late night. I shared the dish with my dad and we really liked the taste. Also I had no odd feelings after consuming so much so late night as iam not used to having rice and often have problems if eaten spicy food late night . Also the delivery was within the time . So I will order again from here this place someday again. Well done and keep up the tasty and quality.

After a long hectic day, when you tired and looking for food to fill your empty tummy, then some good quality Mughlai food is really a blessing. So after a few search on Zomato, we found this place. Location is quiet bit difficult to explain. It is between Nager Bazar Bus stop and Hanuman Mandir Bus Stop. So it will be better, if you follow the google map. The restaurant offers some great combo deals of Nearbuy, so we purchased one combo meal deal. Now let come and explore this place.

Positive Points –
1.	Ambiance & Decoration – In one word, wonderful. Dim ceiling lighting, little dark-light ambiance is something, that will surely catch your eyes. Basic Table chair sitting and MK tag on their chair shows, how they take care of each single details.

2.	Food & Pricing – The restaurant offers some great quality food with really affordable pricing tag. Foods are made with great skills.

3.	Service & managements – The stuffs were all polite and helpful. They ask you about the quality of the food after having it. Serving time is quiet slow but could ignore it.


Negative Points –
Although everything is almost perfect here, but they had lack of variation in food menu. With limited items, you don’t get variation in all item. Expect this, we don’t get anything negative here.

We bought meal coupon from Nearbuy, which includes –
1.	Rumali roti – Thin, soft roti was served in a decent way. It was large in size and goes well with any kinda gravy item.

2.	Chicken Chaap – A big pieces chicken pieces was served in a well-cooked gravy. The chicken piece was soft in nature, tender and juicy. The item was not so oily in nature unlike other places. Goes well with any kinda roti or bread.

3.	Green Salad – Well shaped chopped veggies were served in a plate with pepper sprinkles on top. Veggies like cucumber, carrot and tomato were in such way, which draw your attention.

4.	Mutton Biriyani – It is the main attractive item here, whether it is chicken or mutton. The biriyani was served in a copper based plate. Rice was a bit salty in nature but cooked well and not so oily in nature. Mutton pieces were soft and juicy. Quantity is good for one person. Overall a must try item, if you are bored with traditional biriyani.

5.	Chicken Tikka Butter masala - We were so satisfied with the above mentioned items. We ordered this one, as it was not included in our meal voucher. Six pieces boneless chicken pieces were served in a less oily gravy. The chicken pieces were too soft and the gravy goes well with the biriyani. Overall a perfect side dish for any kinda rice or roti.


With all the food mentioned above it costs around 600INR. Really cheap, isn’t it? But the best part is, they don’t add any kinda Service taxes or VAT, which take out the extra pricing tension from the mind. So in conclusion, I will say, Mughal Khaan is one of the Hidden gems restaurant in South Dumdum area. Just have your food here, it will surely melts your heart with some great quality food and low pricing. Overall a great dining experiences.

We had no idea about this restaurant thanks to Zomato Search.
Me & my husband resides in Bangalore for work purpose thus on our Parents Anniversary generally want to do something but due to distance only we can do through online whatever we want to do. This tym our plan was to order food, we choose Mughal Khan and we r super happy.
The food was delicious enjoyed by everyone . Most importantly staff behaviour is too good. Even the owner didn't get angry for once ehen we called him multiple time for changing menu and also out of panic as well.
Next tym this restaurant in my bucket list have to visit whenever I  go to Kolkata.

Tried their "Chicken Tandoori", " Mutton Biryani" and "Chicken Chanp". Food was good and adequet amount, but could be much better tasted. Biryani was ok, but their chicken chanp needs improvement, because its gravy didnt taste authentic. They use a lot of 'meetha attar' in their tandoori, which didnt match the sobarness of tandoori. Overall, it was an average experience for me.

I was planning to visit this place for a long time and finally went there with my friends. And definitely I don't regret going there. Ambience is nice and great hospitality. Interiors can be improved though. Now the food , we ordered potli kebab and mutton biryani. Kebab was very good. And the biryani was not at all spicy and very tasty. The mutton was soft and tender. Overall very nice experience and surely will visit again.

Mughal Khaan, a definite hidden gem of a restaurant! Went there with friends for a weekend dinner, the staffs were very well behaved and extremely courteous. There are rooms for improvement in the interiors, although the ambience was nice with ghazals playing around.
Now the main review, the food. We ordered one of their specialty, Chicken Potli kebab as the starter. Wow, it was one of the best kebabs i had ever tasted, this was my first time trying potli kebab though. Then comes the biriyani, we ordered mutton biriyanis, they were perfectly spiced, overall a great experience for my taste buds. Will definitely visit again.

Last night, I ordered Chicken Hazari Kabab & Mutton Chaap from Mughal Khaan. Both the dishes were totally up to the mark! The only regret that I have with the chaap is that there was too little meat & way too much bones in it. Next time I'll wouldn't expect the same... Otherwise I was totally satisfied with the food!!!

My review is only based on the quality of biriany and paneer tikka butter masala.
The biriany was great; it was spiicy and flavoursome. The chicken in the biriany was juicy and perfectly cooked.
The paneer tikka butter masala was tasteless. May be it was one bad dish.
But i will surely return for their biriany.

Ordered food through swiggy. Food was delivered later than the expected time but not too much. 
Ordered chicken biriyani, mutton biriyani, chicken tikka butter masala and chicken reshmi butter masala. None of the mutton side dishes were available so that was a let down. Coming to the food, the biriyani was okayish. A little too bland for my taste. The chicken and mutton pieces in the biriyanis were good and on the whole it wasn't "bad" but neither was it very good. The biriyani lacked the typical biriyani aroma. The side dishes were better. Liked both the tikka butter masala and the reshmi butter masala. Infact the sides tasted better than many of the sides I have had from aminia and arsalaan. But the biriyani was a little disappointing.

Again home delivery, this time the reviews of this place seemed appealing. So we went for rumali rotis 1 mutton biriyani chicken tikka butter masala and green salad. Mutton biriyani was sufficient for one person I loved the mutton, very succulent, tender and well cooked. Masala of the biriyani was well balanced too. Rotis were well made too. Chicken was well cooked, balanced flavours but it had a little too much oil. However it was a good experience and will order more from here.

Now the food.. Trust me this is a hidden gem of south dum dum.. biriyani is really delish... And there mutton chap is of royal style... One thing i will say .. they does not have a very highly aromatic biriyani.. which sometimes.. does nit feel good.. and make me feel nauseous... But there biriyani is light and tasty and good to digest... There other dishes are also good... Amount is enough for two... Worthy for pocket

As the name suggests this food joint should be delivering something special on the mughal dishes.I was in search for a different place serving mughal dishes in my area.So on a sunday night keeping big names(aminia and arsalan) aside hoping for a lovely dinner ordered 3plates of mutton biryani.The quantity was sufficient for a single person.But the quality of Biryani was not up to the mark.The pieces of mutton was not at all good.I expected much more from this food joint.I think my experiments didn't worked out.:(

Mughal Khaan is truly a hidden gem. Situated near Art college this small food joint serves Mughlai food as its name suggests. The ambience is nice with the thumri songs playing at the backdrop justifying the theme. We ordered Chicken Tikka Kebab and Chicken Pahari Kebab as starters. While the Tikke Kebab was just superb Hazari kEbab was a bit stiff. For main course we opted for Mutton Biryani. It just took away my heart. From the taste to quantity- it was perfect. Price is very reasonable here. Staffs here are very friendly.

I think people don't know this place much because of Aminia and Arsalan, but trust me this is hidden gem. The decor is very good and food is awesome. I liked the briyani which is less oily and great in taste. You should try their chicken chaap with their briyani. We booked the package from little app. Person handling the restaurant is really a nice guy and does his best to take care of guests requirements. Keep it up. I will surely visit soon and will recommend.

The restaurant was so simple but decorated..Their design of utensils are very unique than any other restaurant....We ordered 3 items- mutton biriyani and two types of kabab...Every foods were just awsome...but I love chicken tikka kabab...uff!!!

Heard a lot about this restaurant but not that much good rather its quite normal. Place is quite congested and not that much decorated. It will hardly have 4 to 5 seating arrangement. Lighting was not too good. Place is rather peaceful. Tried mutton biriyani, reshmi kebab, chicken reshmi masala and many more. Quality is average mutton pieces are really soft, tender but rest of the dishes are quite normal. So overall the restaurant is average one but not worthy enough to visit again.

Coming to the food, I had ordered a Chicken Biryani, Chicken Chaap and Tandoori Roti each.The taste was not bad, although a little more flavour wouldn't have  hurt.Quantity was sufficient and the delivery was very swift(since I had ordered from Swiggy).Overall, not bad.Keep up!

Went through a lot of good feedbacks in zomato regarding this restaurant, so thought of giving it a try. We ordered only Paneer Butter Masala and Butter Naan. Paneer was absolutely blant in taste with actually zero gravy and a hell lot of oil running in place of gravy. It was feeling like they have simply dipped the paneer pieces in oil with no taste at all. Naan was not at all that fluffy that it is suppose to be, it was more like a normal roti with butter on it. Pathetic experience. Never gonna order from here again.

Mughal Khaan is another hidden gem found in a lane of Dum Dum Road, but this time it's a North Indian hidden gem. It's bit difficult to find the lane if you're not following the Google Maps here.

Decorations : From the Mughal stylized gate of Mughal Khan it starts to feel there's something good inside. The ambience of Mughal Khan is very simple but adorable. The restaurant itself is not very big but the space has been utilized very well that doesn't make it very cozy. Footprints like MK symbol on chairs shows that how decently they have taken care of small things. Old style chandelier is the main eye catcher here.

Staffs & Management : This is one of the very few restaurants where the server guy asked us how was the food? Not only that when we complained about bit higher salt present on Biryani he also apologize for the same. While taking the order we also understood that they make food after ordering​ it unlike other places. Behaviour & service of the server guy was very good & management do gets a thumps up for all this.

Food : Their menu card is very basic & simple. That offers very less item to choose from, but everything is from their best. We ordered the following...

Rumali Roti : Rumali Roti was served soft, hot & folded just like a new handkerchief. It felt well with their gravy side dishes.

Chicken Chaap : Chicken Chap was served with a big chicken piece & very well balanced gravy. Unlike other places this Chaap tasted totally different because of the very lite spices that have been used. Also it was less oily than other places. Also chicken piece was soft & well cooked. But it could have been better if the taste of the gravy could have reached inside of the chicken. However it tasted well with the Rumali Roti.

Green Salad : Big pieces of decently cut vegitables was seved in a well garnished way to make the table complete.

Mutton Biryani : Mutton Biryani was served in a copper based mughal style plate. The first impression was the great quality of the rice. Secondly the lite fragrance of it felt nice. One big sized potato was there in well cooked condition. Coming to the main mutton piece, it was very soft & tendered. It was extremely well cooked & the mutton itseft showed the perfection of that Biryani. Taste wise it was very lite & very well balanced. Every spoon of that Biryani was enjoyable.

Chicken Tikka Butter Masala : There was six big boneless pieces of chicken with the lite gravy as expected. Chicken pieces were well cooked & delicious as well. The quantity & garnishing of this dish was impressive. The gravy merged well with the Biryani but it tasted kind of the chaap. That means the same pinch of spices was used here too. Different taste could have made it much better.

Pricing : Pricing of the dishes were also well balanced just like the taste of their dishes. They also accept food vouchers from Nearbuy & Little. Loving advantage is they don't add VAT & Service Tax.

Conclusion : It's a true hidden gem that offers great overall experience for an affordable rate. Food quality was impressive but a bit more work could've help them to compete the Mughal Kings of the city.

Very prompt delivery and extremely polite service, The food over here comes as a much needed but a refreshing break from the regular biryani giants in the Dum Dum locality. Spices and the rendering of the meat are on point, minus the excessive oil which other biryani joints serve. The pieces are quite large and justify the nominal price. Do give it a try!

Tried Mughal Khaan today. I had bought a Nearbuy voucher and had ordered a Tandoori chicken on the side. The tandoor will make you remember old Delhi, and the biryani was so very different from the ones we get at aminia and arsalan. Definitely lighter and a little intricately spiced. Very different ,must say.liked the chicken chaap too. One negative thing is that the service though polite needs to be more professional.

One of the best in this area. Food quality & quantity is   
pretty good. Everyone must tryout the biryani.
Haven't been in the restaurant yet, ordered home delivery many times. Every time got the delivery on or before time, till date.

Had ordered mutton biryani from here and mutton chaap. The food was delivered earlier than promised. And the food was really good . The biryani is quite different from the other branded shops and the fragnance gives a whiff of the spices and not of aatar which I really loved. The mutton pieces were good in size though not the best , but the meat quality was very good. One of the best mutton I have tasted. The mutton chap is a very different version again , which they call petano chaap and the taste is very good. Goes very well with the biryani. Will order again.

Felt like giving a skip to Aminia & Arsanal and try something new. Ordered a Special Chef's Mutton Biryani. The quantity provided was awesome, 2 pieces of Mutton & Potatoes were provided. The quality of the rice was OK.the size of the Mutton pieces were not satisfying at all too small to be true. Rs 260 for a biryani and size so small not worth it. Also the taste of the biryani is not worth the money. I prefer to stay with Aminia & Arsanal at least for quality biryani.

Recently visited this restaurant near surir math stoppage..a small restaurant with good arrangements and decor.The name Mughal khaan is just perfect with their ambiance..soft music makes it divine..
Coming to food.. We took chicken reshmi kabab, chicken tikka masala, and their special mutton beryani with green salad.. 
From taste.. All the item was good.. Kabab was soft and yum with dhaniya chatni.. Mutton in the beryani was also tender and tasty.. 
Staffs are well behaved and humble.. We reached there before 12:30.. Before the opening time.. But they took a little time and served us within 15 minutes... 
But one suggestion.. There is no dessert item in the Manu.. Please include some of it.. You are already good.. That will make u perfect..

Visited this small restaurant today for having our lunch. It's located at walkable distance from surer math stoppage on the way from Dum dum to Nagerbazar. The restaurant has a mughal touch in their ambiance. Though the dining place is not so big but well arranged. We had a little coupon worth 499rs. Our meal includes following items :
STARTER: Chicken Reshmi Kebab
MAIN COURSE: Special Mutton Biryani
Chicken tikka butter masala
Green salad
The foods came within 15 minutes. Starting from the kebabs to the biryani everything was decent. Soft pieces of kebabs were served with coriander chatni and onion salad. Then coming to the biryani, it tasted good also with less oil and mutton pieces served were very tender. Chicken tikka butter masala tasted good also. As we told them that we didn't need the two rumali rotis mentioned in the deal, they served us extra pieces of chicken tikka masala. Service was pretty good and worth mentioning. Definitely recommended. Only one issue with this place that there is less variety of items in their menu. No sweet section at all and that's one drawback. They must enlarge their service with some good variety in desserts.

Well, After a decade I found an awesome restaurant in Dumdum. Though the restaurant is a bit hard to find but we managed through Google Maps! :D

Now coming to the reviewing part,
Positive Points:
1. Food - They have the Mughlai Taste! Quantity is quite good for two people!
2. Ambience - Mughal Ambience, Decorated well!
3. Behaviours of the waiters are good enough!
4. Serving time is 15-20 minutes as they will cook your order and will serve you!
5. No tax included and Paytm payment is accepted!

Negative Points:
1. They don't have much negative point except their varieties in food menu! They have lack of varieties in food which is a concern who doesn't love Biriyani but Breads!

We orderd:
1. Mutton Biriyani - Mughal Khaan's Speciality is Biriyani whether it is Mutton or Chicken! A must try if you are a Biriyani Freak and bored with Arsalan! :P
2. Chicken Tikka Butter Masala - As usual Signtaure Chicken Dishes for North Indian Lovers, here taste and quantity both were good!
3. Rumali Roti - Soft, thin and enough large!
4. Onion Salad

And we made a bill of 386, which is very cheap! Isn't it?
I will recommend you to please have a visit here, if you are a Biriyani Lover! :)

Their ambience is really great and not something you will find in Dum Dum . The service is also quite fast and the people are quite warm enquiring about your experience and food. Now coming to their food. We had chicken tandoori , a mutton biryani, chicken Reshmi butter masala and butter naan.
 Chicken Tandoori - Soft , succulent, well infused spices and great taste.
Mutton Biryani - my husband had the biryani and he was really amazed by the taste and lightness of it. The mutton he mentioned to be of great quality.
Reshmi butter masala - I was just simply blown away by the taste , so creamy with a hint of tanginess and a little sweet. And the naan was so soft you could tear it apart using just two fingers.
 Over in all a great experience.

This is a newly opened restaurant near surer math. It's a little inside the alley. Most of the times I call for a biryani, they are generally sold out. They generally make a little less than the usual biryani shops you find and hence the fast sell out. The biryani here is top notch. It's one of the best in the city after Royal hotel.Intact imho it's the second best.The rice is great, the mutton which might displease a lot of people who hanker for big size,a tad little small, but the quality is unmatched.The mutton here is one of the best I have had personally ,including the one we have back at home. The quantity is more than sufficient for one,and the aloo is one of the softest and tastiest that is there. I had also tried their Tikka butter masala and Malai kebab. Their Malai kebab is really succulent and mouth melting soft. And the tikka butter masala is really mouth watering ,though it could be a little hotter.The service is really good and the people really hospitable and warm.

Visited this place in afternoon around 2. The place was empty. Ordered one chicken tikka butter masala and naan. Waiter said it will take some time to cook. On asking he said 20min. After 25 min he came back and said they can't serve chicken tikka butter masala because there is some issue . Instead he asked me we can give u chicken kasha which was not even listed on there menu .I was hungry and didn't had any option after waiting this long . I said "OK" bring it. After 20min they served . Chicken kasha was bad as they prepared it in hurry .Anyhow ate . At time of paying bill they offered 10% discount, because they served late. I denied and paid full amount and left. Take swear never to visit this place. #Disappointed #WorstService

There is no doubt about the service which is provided by Zomato but when you are going to order a biryani from this restaurant then you have to think first about the quantity. About the quantity it's really deserve the word "Inferior". I thought that the taste will be bang on but not like that great. The earth-shattering potato taking a good size of that parcel.

I had tried their Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. The biriyani was surprisingly light in taste and was good but nothing exceptional. I personally didn't like the gravy of the chicken.
The decor of the restaurant is really amazing for a small place like this one. It really gives you a royal feel.
They do not offer much variety in food either and it is a NO GO Zone for vegetarian people.

Takes back to the ghazal era with the sweet music flowing through the room and the lip smacking kabab platter whose taste won't leave your tongue. If you are a foodie visit this place and you sure won't be disappointed. People who love yellow lights which will lift up your mood in no time,this is the place people. Biryani could'nt be any better.

We ordered online from this place so I am unable to talk about the ambience. However, as we ordered mutton biryani, I was pretty satisfied with the food. For the price, the quality and quantity that they serve is pretty good. Adding to that, the delivery is very fast. The taste may not be very different from the others but it will definitely satisfy you. Great for a low budget. Looking forward to a visit the next time.

A very beautifully decorated small place that alas fails to translate the charm of its environment to its food.
The service is slow. We had mutton biryani,mutton chap,tikka kabab and salad. Mutton biryani lacked subtlety in terms of flavour...it contained too much spice which ruined my palate,especially considering the lack of a raita or salan. The mutton chap is the one dish I liked. The tikka kabab was again unbalanced in terms of flavour.
Good as a takeaway option for hunger pangs,not worth travelling all the way to it for.

First of all thanks to the staffs of this food joint to let us enter the restaurant even they were closed at that time on knowing that we wanted to have lunch at a very odd time at 4.30 pm.
Coming to the food part tasted chicken tikka kabab and chicken malai kebab as starter,chicken biriyani ,chicken chap and mutton chap  for main course.Tikka kabab was one of the best I have ever tasted.Meat was soft ,tender and succulent.Biriyani tastes marvelous and mutton chap was equally good.
Chicken chap was average. Chicken malai kebab tasted delicious.Atmosphere and ambience of this food joint is very cosy.Apt for Mughal like environment.
Their staffs ,their food ,atomosphere and affordable price make this a must try for all foodies.

A nice mughlai restaurant located  near Motijheel Arts College in Dum Dum area. Visited there with friends for lunch. Ambiance was nice with beautiful decor. The menu card was quite simple only few items were there. We ordered mutton boti kebab and mutton tunday kebab for starter and special mutton biryani with mutton chap for main course. Kebabs were superb. Had a nice aroma, and the meat was nicely cooked, soft very tasty. Biryani was also good,  nicely cooked and quantity was huge. But we didn't like the chap. Too oily and spicy.  Service was fast and pocket pinch was reasonable.

Chaap was tasty but nothing fantastic.

Came to know abt this place after seeing suggestion from  Zomato under best biriyani places in Kolkata section. This place is located at chatakol stoppage  near motijheel science college.its a small place with a sitting arrangement for 20-22 people.Bt the place was empty (yes we were there during pick lunch hour).We got a warm welcome from d server. Water was served in  copper glasses. We opted for two mutton biriyani with green salad (we redeemed our little coupon). D biriyani was served after 15 min. Bt it was worth waiting. Biriyani was light,aromatic ,less oily bt d flavours were uncompromised. Meat was tender (though we expected bigger meat pieces).Salad was fresh. And we enjoyed our meals thoroughly. Planning to visit them soon

Recently visited mughal khaan wid my family.Firstly i would describe about the interior of the restaurant which was simple yet elegant n classy, next behaviour of the staff was commendable and their service was also very quick .Now coming to the food we ordered mutton biryani,chicken chaap and romali roti.
Mutton biryani-One of the best mutton biryani i hav evr tasted.Mutton pieces were soft and was perfectly cooked and the rice was very aromatic and it was less oily too.A must try for everyone 👍.
Chicken chaap- chicken pieces were very well cooked and the gravy went very well with the roomali roti.
Though it is a small restaurant but they serve some of the most delectable dishes you will ever have .
Overall a very good experience ,will surely visit to try the other dishes too.

A bit hard to find. It's inside surer math just opposite Indian art college. It's generally a little empty at times. So we were a little hesitant before entering. But the ambiance and decor seemed really nice and we thought of trying out the food. We had ordered the Malai kebab and Tandoori chicken . For main course we had gone for mutton biryani and mutton chaap, tikka butter masala and butter naan. 
Malai kebab - they are just heavenly . They are so soft that you can literally break them with your tongue only. And the flavours were so good. Though I would have loved it a little smoky. I am quite sure they serve the biggest piece of kebabs in the city.
Tandoori Chicken - simply delicious. The masalas had all penetrated every nook and corner and it was cooked to perfection .
Mutton biryani- I must say they are one of the best in the city. I am quite sure very few restaurants serve this quality of mutton in the city. The mutton was the best qualitymutton I had in any restaurant without any fibres and a great texture. The biryani rice was full of flavours . Here is a thing I have to say, the biryani hardly smelt of aatar. Generally everywhere we get the strong smell of biryani because of the aatar , but here the smell was just off spices cooked together. The way it's supposed to be. And the aloo , it was soft and the spices had entered the deepest part of the aloo something you don't find everywhere.
Mutton chaap- well it's a little bony , but I guess that's why the taste. I am having petano chaap for the first time. I learnt it first hand from the manager over there that it is first smashed and then slices are mixed, and the smashing of the bones makes the food so good. And it was very good. 
Tikka butter masala - we were almost full by the time we had finished the biryani because of the huge quantity. None the less we dipped our arms into this one too and the butter masala was really good. It could have been a little spicier though. The chicken pieces were really soft and the thick gravy tasted very good. 

I was surprised at the end of it. They serve such great food and yet this place is hardly full. They deserve so much more. The pocket pinch was very less compared to the quality of food. I wonder how they sustain themselves. I suggest everyone to give them a try.

I ordered 2 chicken and 1 special mutton biriyani. The  delivery took around 100 minutes compared to estimated 77 minutes.  The quality and quantity was good.  But the biriyani from one container was spilled.  The delivery guy did offer me extra rice within another 10-15 minutes but it was around 23.15 and we could not wait any longer.  Over all in my opinion it is an average mughlai food joint.

The place had an awesome ambience. Worth a try. I visited with my family for dinner and enjoyed the experience very much. They had kept everything from interior decoration to the cutlery appropriate to their theme. We ordered Tandoori chicken , chicken chaap , and Chicken biriyani. The biriyani was superb, really tasty dish they prepared. The chicken chaap was good too. But I personally found the Tandoori was not up to the mark. Hope it would get better .  Also I would love if the management would take notice of the fact that the restaurant is under managed. More people are required as time before taking order or serving is really long. What I found more surprising was that there was no "tissue paper" and "salt pepper" on each table. You have to ask for it everytime . Which I found pretty annoying. Nonetheless, I am definitely visiting again for the Biriyani. Hope the management takes notice and clarifies these minor problems.

N.B. Anyone reading this and considering to visit with your partner , It is the best place for a date , as the place is very romantic. I haven't found a cosier place in nearby area. Thank me later.  ;)

This place is a stone's throw away from my work place. I had seen this place before, but was never sure about going in and trying the food. Then I saw them featured in Zomato's hidden gem and decided to visit the place with a friend who is a die-hard foodie. 

Food: The food was really good. We had mutton biriyani, chicken tikka kebab, chicken butter masala, green salad and thumbs up. We could tell that the ingredients used were premium from the taste of the food. The meat was succulent and tender. The flavour invigorating and a delight to the senses. The biriyani here makes Arsalan look crap. 
It could be that we caught them on a good day. The dishes were mind blowing. 

Service: The staff was friendly and courteous. They were prompt and helpful. The starter came straight away and was served with onion rings and a green sauce. The biriyani, butter masala and salad came after sometime. The presentation of the food was lovely
 - artistic and visually pleasing. 
Ambiance: The place is a cosy and small place. Brightly lit. The furniture had an ancient touch with a very modern finish. The cutlery was very classy and loved the brass goblets with carvings on the sides. There was old classy hindi music playing which went well with the decor and the ambience. 

The prices are reasonable too since they include taxes. 

This place surely has the potential to go a long away if they maintain their quality and service. I would surely come here again.

This place is undoubtedly a gem among Kolkata eateries. You need to go towards Nagerbazar from Dumdum station and get down at 'chhatakol'. It's located in a lane, but pretty easy to locate in general. 

We've been there many times now (being located in North Calcutta certainly helps) and they are probably the best biriyani-makers around. Their quality surpasses that of the more renowned arsalan (please don't kill me for saying this). Their menu is a little short, but quality makes up for that. They are also very co-operative and always ask how the food was. 

Upon entering you're greeted by ghazal music and ambient lighting. The decor of the place is done in authentic mughal style, starting from the lighting to utensils. They also have a surprisingly clean washroom. However, coming to the food, highly recommended items are Mutton biriyani, Chicken Chaap and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. Words fall short about their quality of food, they are spoonfuls of heaven. The only reason to complain is that the quantity of the special biriyani could be better. 

Whenever we are there, we usually see the place pretty empty. Which is odd because they more than deserve to have their restaurant packed with customers at all times. Speaking for myself, will definitely visit again and again, and looking forward to see some added desserts on the menu too.

In school, History was never my favourite subject you know, but saying NO to d opportunity of getting a royal treatment is a crime! Talking about which, reminds me of d ambience of this place, filled with the glimpse of the Mughal architecture in every piece- be it the lights,  the furniture or the platter!

Though they have few other dishes too, This place mainly serves Biriyani, of exquisite delicacy. The hospitality and customer service is highly appreciated :) I would like to visit again!

Having read a lot of good reviews in zomato, I had ordered mutton biryani and chicken reshmi masala.
But both the dishes were disappointing. With the same rate as that of Aminia.. the taste of the biryani was not even close to that served in Aminia. It was tasteless and oily. The mutton pieces were very small. The reshmi masala was a little better. The chicken was perfectly cooked.. but the taste could have been a lot better. 
   In short, I'll never have biryani from this joint. Again.

Firstly the ambience was superb.. Hospitality and courteous behavior are something you look for whenever you dine out. The quality of mutton/chicken was superb.  If you like dry biriyani with less oil you should try it out here. A place you can go with friends family or you special one.

Mughal khaan was a pleasant surprise! Have tasted biriyani at a number of well-known joints now.... And let me tell you this restaurant can give all of them a run for their money. My friend and I are both voracious eaters....him.... Wee bit more than I am. The reason for stating the previous sentence was because we were stuffed by the time we finished what we ordered. As the restaurant is offering a 10% discount on online orders and another 15% for ordering from them, this alongwith the fact that the restaurant scores a rating of 4.2, made us plain and simple, greedy! We ordered:-
1. Chicken tandoori-half a plate
2. Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala-1
3. Mutton biriyani-2
Here I would like to request the owners, to make the Chef's special biriyani to be made available for online orders.... Although we did understand the reluctance in adding that to the menu was possibly because of the arrangement of a much bigger container. 
The order arrived in an hour and a half... We were also called to be intimated that there can be a delay as the chicken tandoori was being freshly prepared as they pervious batch was sold out. And we preferred to wait and taste our original pick. And it was worth it. 
Coming to the quality of the food, let's start from the main course and move up the order ladder. 
1. The biriyani was way more than sufficient, although egg was not served with it, we had no qualms about it. The mutton pieces were adequately sized and juicy and fleshy. The entire dish was cooked in very little oil. There was no grease at all which made it very light and extremely tasty. (4.5/5)
2. The reshmi butter masala came with 6-7 big pieces of succulent chicken. The gravy tasted really great and a fresh new tang for the palate. We really liked it. (4.5/5)
3. But the show stopper was the chicken tandoori. Huge pieces. Juicy. And extremely well marinated and cooked. The spices used for the marinade were amazing but mind it, not over the edge tangy. And there was a lovely aroma of burnt meat, pudina chutney and the onions they provided with it. (6/5) 😜 (yes I am being biased! ) 
Our original bill came upto ₹670 which got reduced to ₹503 after all the discounts and codes. 
Overall this is a place I would really like to visit over and over again if they manage to hold on to the quality of their offerings.

I am not going to lie. First time I ordered from this place, the biriyani didnot taste anything special. It was bland and without any flavour. But I guess that was some sort of mistake and they were generous enough to rectify it. They sent another biriyani for free and wow, that was great. Me along with a friend of mine, we ordered biriyani from aminia that day, and they were almost better than aminia. Keep it up.

After reading good review and ratings I decided to order from Mughal khan...mutton biriyani and mutton chap. The biriyani was good but the chap dissapointed me....it was undercooked, tasteless, bland and there was a heavy taste of raw besan..so I am giving 3 only for the biriyani and prompt delivery.

Mughal Khan is a great conceptual dinning restaurant in Dumdum area near Surer Math. Perfect Mughlai ambience will give you a true majestic feelings. Royal chandeliers , copper made glasses and plates with background gazal music will definitely remind you of imperial time.

Food : Choice of food is very limited. We had Mutton Biryani and Chicken Chanp.
Biryani was excellent with nice portion of mutton and a buttery soft potato. Quantity could have been better. Miss the egg as well. Chicken chaap was a perfect companion for Biryani. Huge portion of chicken in rustic delicious red gravy was lip smacking delicacy.
Lastly it was a very nice experience to dine in this Resturant as there is no concept dinning restro near by and service was very courtesies. Will be return very soon and as always hungry for more.
Mutton Biryani - 160
Chicken Chaap -145

In the time of demonetization, when we were searching for some cheap good restaurants where we can use card, we found this biriyani joint. I must say its a hidden gem of Kolkata, where you can have very good yummy biriyanis with kebabs at very pocket friendly price. We have ordered 1 plate malai reshmi kebab+ 1 Chicken Spl. Biriyani + Mutton Chap + 1 Green Salad, and the total bill amount was only 610. Its a must try place for all the Biriyani Lovers. 

Pros: 
+ Location: 2 mins walking from Chata Kol stoppage near Nager Bazar.
+ Good Interior and artistic cutlery
+ Very friendly behavior
+ Unique kebab pieces. Larger than normal kebab pieces
+ Very Good Quantity at low price
+ Taxes are included in the menu, which is very helpful.

Cons:
- Less variety
- Moderate service. Long waiting time.
- Biriyani chicken pieces are very big, but not that much juicy. May be they should divide the big one into 2 small pieces, so that the flavor can reach all the parts.

So I visited this place very recently after one of my friends recommended saying the biriyani is as good as any other 'big' place in Kolkata. I can vouch that it is in fact better than most of the big biriyani chains in Kolkata, and mind you there are quite a lot of them. Even though most people would think (those who live in southern part of the city), that it is quite far and not worth it, let me assure you that it is totally worth it. And it is not too much of a hassle. All you need to do is hop on a metro, get down at Dum Dum and take an auto for like 5-6 minutes. When you enter the place, you will be a little taken aback. With Begum Akhtar's Ghazal's playing in the background, and a calm soothing ambiance, Mughal Khaan scores 10/10 on revving up the place and delivering the perfect atmosphere for dining. We ordered for Chicken Malai Kebab, Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Mutton Biriyani and the famed Mutton Chaanp. I can say that it was THE BEST dining experience and THE BEST food I have had recently. The kebabs were cooked perfectly, not too tender not too tough, and the spices were all in the right amount. then came the biriyani and the chaanp. Having quite a bit of experience is having biriyanis in most of the places in the city, I was totally blown away by the biriyani and the chaanp. The biriyani is a bit different from what Kolkatans are usually habituated to, and that seemed a good change. The mutton chaanp delivered to all the hype surrounding it. Tender mutton pieces cooked perfectly complimented by the brilliant gravy. I cannot even begin to describe how good it was. And to top it off, the bill was well within our budget. I thoroughly recommend this  place to all the foodies out here and express my thanks to Mughal Khaan for the brilliant work they are doing.

Very good experience..it was my 1st time visit to this place nd m looking forward to go there again.. Now come to the menu they offered us.. We bought little coupon of 499 which includes chicken reshmi kebab(6 pcs), 2 roomali roti, chicken tikka masala(6pcs), green salad and one special mutton biryani! 2 mutton pieces and 2 potatoes were there.. Mutton was tender n juicy! Biryani was less oily bt balance of spices was really good! Enough for 2 person to share. Now, the star of the menu was reshmi kebab.. So juicy nd soft it was! Much better than some of renowned restaurant! But lil disappointed bcoz of the chicken tikka masala.. Taste of gravy was a bit off! Dnt knw wht was missing in it.! anyway, overall a good deal to grab! Decor n behavior of the staff were commendable!

We were having a house party near dumdum and wanted to have biriyani for dinner. Confused between Arsalan or mughal khaan. But after seeing so many good reviews about Mughal Khaan went for it . We placed order around 8.15 pm and got delivery around 9 pm. Nice peeping hot biriyani and chaps. 
Food consists of:-
1. Chicken biriyani : Nice aromatic biriyani with decent chunks of chicken and one medium sized potato. Overall good one.
2. Mutton biriyani : 1 pc of mutton which is on smaller  side. One pc of potato. Good but not outstanding.
3. Chicken chap : I felt it's a bit too oily and having dalda and loads of gulap jol. Not that good for my taste buds.
4. Mutton chap : small bony chunks of mutton. Far better than its chicken counter part. 

Over all decent option for people staying around this area. I believe they have the potential to serve even better food. 

Cheers!

The only thing that not good on this list is their service. This may be because we visited the restaurant during rush hour.

A group of young enthusiasts run the place. The interior looks very nice. The biriyani can give any established place a run for their money! But, possibly the best thing about Mughal Khaan is the warm behaviour you get from the stakeholders. The first time we ordered, there was a small goof up in the delivery content. We were amazed how responsibly and sympathetically, these people responded to our cause. We made it a point to go back there during the Pujo and trust us...we came back even happier!!!  Keep up the good work Mughal Khaan.

I went here with my girlfriend buri here... But she ate nothing... I had to bring back half of the food in parcel... We ordered half tandoori chicken... One plate special chicken biriyani... Mutton chaap one plate (this is a note to the owner this dish had no mutton only bones... Next time I visit I would surely notify you that...it was a complete loss for me...don't do that from the next time)... Overall the cost is standard not too cheap but food is quality... Biriyani is really very good undoubtedly... Overall it's a 4/5 but 0.5 more for good service...

Pre-planned visit. Mesmerizing behavior of their staffs so as the food. I planned for special mutton biryani and chicken rezala but mutton was not available. Even most of the items were not there. Still we enjoyed a lot with special chicken biryani, chicken chap, chicken tikka kabab. Very fresh food. I must recommend people for a visit here. Perfect ambience. Very simple decorations but very clean.  The mughal music, the utensils are special touch. Lastly I must mention that I pleased so much when a man( most likely the owner) came to us and asked about our feedback and required changes (if any).
Very much pocket friendly also.

Horrible Experience. Ordered food around 7:30pm & was informed that I would get food by  9pm. They took 4 hours to reach Teghoria. After getting frustrated, I informed Zomato & they decided to refund & gave my order as free meal. After waiting till 10 pm, i called them up again to get to know that my order has returned back to the restaurant, since my money was refunded. !!! CONFUSION !!! Finally it reached around 11:30 pm.
I ordered a Mutton Biryani & Onion Salad. The Onion Salad was not delivered. The Mutton Biryani was cold, dry & tasteless. The Mutton Piece was small & under cooked. My Durga Puja (Shasti Dinner) turned out to be a Major Disaster. 1 out of 5.

Following day( Saptami) i ordered a Mutton Biryani, Chicken Chap & Onion Salad.The delivery was within time.The Biryani was cold and not seasoned well.The quantity was less but slightly better than the previous one. The Onion Salad was delivered.The Chicken Chap was nothing but a medium-sized chicken piece dipped in a bowl of chicken soup.The masala was missing.The taste of the Biryani completely fell off on mixing with the gravy, which was not properly seasoned. "Disgusting Cooking". 1.5/5.

Frankly speaking I've read A LOT about this joint in Zomato. So, I was really curious to try out their biriyani and know what the hype is about. But that turned out to be a MAJOR disappointment.
We order their mutton biryani, but since that wasn't available, they called us up and gave us one mutton and one chicken and everything was okay till then. But then they took 1hr 25mins to deliver that from DumDum to Lake Town. -_-
And the biriyani wasn't just as good either. It was a really dry and tasteless biriyani; Given that the price is on the higher side.
I'd prefer Arsalan anyday!

Went on saptami with mom for dinner. 
It's a very small restaurant with only 16 seats. Interior has got a royal look. Very neat and clean. 
Ordered one starter, rumali rotis and 2 side dishes and salad. Food was okay (can be better) but the service was too slow. There was only one guy for all the tables, he was taking the orders, serving the food, making the food, cleaning the tables. We had to wait for really a long time.

I generally don't eat during pujas in places which I have never visited before, but as I was resting after visiting the surer math pandal, i got the whiff of tandoor which was really good and decided to dine there. We had to wait as it's a very small place and as it being their first puja, they were finding things to be a little difficult. We got a seat in 20 mins . Order the tandoori chicken, mutton chaap and tikka butter masala. What really surprised was that despite they being at full stretch, they still offered us amazing food. Generally places take a nosedive in quality during puja, but the food was simply delicious.

Horrible experience. We ordered dinner at 7pm and we were promised that we would get food at 8pm. The delivery boy gives us a call at 8:30pm and we start giving him directions. He does not understand any language be it Bengali or hindi. He behaved rudely and yells at me. He is not willing to hear my full sentence and does not want to understand what I am saying. He cut the phone saying that he would throw the food on my face. I suggest never order food from this restaurant. Horrible experience

The ambience of this place was very good. Mughal ambience at all! Plates, glasses, musics of mughal style would make you feel very nice. The behaviour of the staffs were also special. Now comes the main thing i.e. taste of food items. I ordered chicken tanduri which was delicious! Then I took chicken reshmi kabab. That too tasted very good. Then I ordered chicken biriyani. This time also the biriyani passed with later marks! Please go there & have the taste...

Very good food. Service was fast. Specially liked their mutton chaap and tikka butter masala. The muuton chaap was very soft and juicy and the taste was really good with a lot of spices. The tikka was spicy and had a thick and creamy gravy and was very tasty.

I ordered food for home delivery .....Mutton biryani (2 plate) and mutton chaap (1 plate). The biryani was good (though I had better biryani), only issue was the potato seemed under-cook (hard at the middle). On the other hand the mutton chaap totally disappointed me. The mutton was well cooked but there was a lot of oil and I didn't like the taste. Finally come to the price ........ While famous joints like Arsalan, Aminia, Royal are serving Biryani @ Rs. 165 - 175, being a new restaurant their pricing is on the higher side. The take-away price should be less than the dine-in. Thanks to the "Mughal Khan" for giving me an opportunity to taste and review their food.

Visited this place today after a brisk puja shopping ... This place has been on my radar for the last 2 months or so... lets get down to the review....
1. Ambience - The interiors of this place is quite neat and clean and decorated with heavy wooden furniture...only has a limited sitting capacity though ... about 4 tables of four ... with soft music playing and brass cutlery and utensils... has an old world charm to it.
2.Food - Since I was a little short of cash after shopping at pantaloons couldnt try their kebab section... ordered mutton biriyani and chicken chaap... (chose chicken biriyani but the young and pleasant guy there said they were out of chicken biriyani ) ....Well the biriyani here ... I wont say lot ... just want to say ... it ranks among the top 3 biriyani i have tasted in kolkata in my own rankings... and i want to urge the people rushing to places with big names like arsalan and aminia and shiraz for biriyani to give this place a fair judgement ... leave alone the cost which is definitely 30-40 rupees less than the big name biriyani outlets in the city ... 
Coming to the chaap ... just the perfect amount of spice and flavour with just a perfect amount of oil... and i havent seen a bigger chicken piece in a chaap plate anywhere else...the chicken piece was huge.

Coming back to the biriyani again... i was told the place is just 4 months old....so it is understandable that they cook their food in a very limited amount... so they were out of chicken biriyani...it is perfectly understandable...this wont happen once the restaurant kicks off well ...
A lightly cooked healthy biriyani with the perfect blend of spice and aroma... 
Just one thing ...i dont know if its just me ...but i should say... the quantity... its  good enough for an average individual i agree...but i think it could have been a little more... maybe they can increase ur prices 10-20 rupees ... and provide a little more per plate... this can easily be done... because chicken biriyani 150 rupees inclusive of taxes is more on the cheaper side... 

I am coming back definitely to try out their kebab section... 
Again...as they are new ...they dont have a very extensive menu to browse from...but that i hope will grow as the restaurant grows... 

Deducting 0.5 points from a perfect 5 ... just for the quantity ... sorry guys...

This is a small restaurant pushed in a corner in Dum Dum, Kolkata. The dexor inside is regal. The chandeliers, the paintings, the doors, the bathroom, everything is mughal royal. We were a little late and being a holiday, their stock got over fast. We had come from quite far so we requested them to cook for us and they did. We had a starter- malai kebabs, which was a little undercooked, but the taste was smooth and sweet. The biryani was an authentic kolkata biryani, and the taste was on point, though it could have been better with the quantity and the cooking of chicken, specifically, coz on getting cold, it became a little chewy. The music continuously was classical, kavvalis, ragas, folk music, music of the times old to us now. The ambience was a 5/5 but even though the preparation was a little hurried, food could have been better. I am assured that the food is not as bad on regular timings. Loved eating here, would like to come here again if nearby. :)

Went to their Outlet today.. Located in a short distance from Dum Dum Hanuman Temple, This is their First Ever Restaurant serving only Dedicated Mughlai Food.. I mean as Majority of Mughlai Restaurant are Hybrid Mixtures of Chinese and Mughal Cuisine side by side which is really irritating.. One should only have a dedicated cuisine typed Restaurant in a City.. Anyway.. This Small yet quite Spacious Outlet is really Impressive and Innovative with their Worth Amazing Interior Decorations with Typical Old Mughal style framed Chairs and Tables with Old Metallic Glasses served with Water.. Soothing your Ears with a Splendid Mughlai Gharana Songs and Gazals.. You will truly feel amazing about the Culture and Heritage with a Twist of Technology to the Old Style.. There are few staffs but they are Well Behaved and Cooperative in Professional Style. Having a look at their Small Menu may surprise you because of its very limited items available but yes it's a dedicated Mughal Menu though can be increased in items if they want..!! I went to order their Biryani out of which Mutton Biryani as always my favourite but was unfortunate enough to have not got it since it had finished by that time and they make very less quantity of Biryani limitedly.. Option was the Chicken Biryani and I went forward with it along with a Side Dish of Chicken Reshmi Butter Kebab and Onion Salad.. The thing that I liked the most is that they told that they use Fresh Quantities of Meat for Kebabs and they don't keep the Biryani leftovers for the next day as instead they make fresh ones so they make limited quantities of it.. I wish They Continue This lifelong.. The takeaway took somewhat time but packaging was perfect..!! Coming about the Taste.. I was simply amazed by their Sufficient Quantity of Biryani for the Parcel with a Huge Drumstick of Chicken and a Huge Aloo in it.. It looked really appetizing and delicious.. The Kebabs were simply amazing and Awesome because of its perfectly cooked aroma and less burning effects.. It just melted in the Mouth..!! Coming to the Biryani.. It is truly the Best Biryani so far I have tasted in Dum Dum Area.. Chicken was very good and the Aloo was superb and soft.. The Rice was perfectly cooked and the delicious aroma made it felt more hungry as I was.. Though Honest being a Strict Biryani Freak and Critic.. I would like to say something so that they maintain this quality.. The Biryani was almost excellent but would have been the Bestest.. had it been a little pinch of less Spicy.. Also the Chicken Drumstick needed to be Tender just a bit with some few Organic Flavours would have added the Best Biryani Meat out of anything.. Rest is everything Superb.. Overall if you are Mughal Food Freak living in Dum Dum Area looking for a Cheap yet Best Biryani outlet.. You can always choose this Mughal Khaan outlet in Motijheel as according to me.. it is one of the best Mughal Cuisine Restaurants in Kolkata..!! Do give it a Try Everyone..!!

Today i ordered chicken reshmi butter masala, paneer butter masala, chicken biriyani and rumali rotis. The biriyani was superb, no complains at all. The reshmi butter masala could have been better i would rate this preparation 6 out of 10 as i have tasted better reshmi butter masala elsewhere. The rumali rotis were soft and melted in our mouth would give it a 9 out of 10 taking 1 as the size was smaller compared to the usual diameter of rumalis. Now coming to the veg preparation that we had ordered. The paneer butter masala was tasteless, i felt pity on my vegetarian hubby! He said the name "PANEER WATER NON MASALA" would have been apt for this one. Well if i could give  a minus mark for this one. I wish every biriyani specialised restro could prepare an eatable veg item. I have tasted okaish veg preparation from these kind of restaurants but what i tasted today from Mughal Khaan was worst veg preparation i have ever eaten.

tip for the foodies: Everybody have different likings but according to me their non veg items are good specially the biriyani, donot waste your money on paneer water masala OOPs i meant butter masala :D.

Happy Fooding... Readers if you find this post helpful then do followback :D. tadaa

My first order from Zomato and m pretty much excited after finding this hidden restaurant.Initially thought to visit this place but due to busy weekend later plan to opt home delivery.
I have ordered one mutton biryani and got a call from the center that mutton biryani will take little longer to serve as it is finished and they can serve a chicken biryani if I am interested.  The person asked to wait a little longer for my order or else. I said I am ok as I had just completed my snacks. The order delivered with exactly one hour late to the mentioned time. Once I open the pack am super happy as  it looks very good with too less oil n ghee.Once I had it I am satisfied with this and convinced.On that night I have experienced one of the finest biryani. Now m planning to visit to taste other dish.

Nice little startup, the ambiance is not bad. The service was satsfactory, the food was pretty good, not the best, but for the price, it exceeds one's expectations. I would recommend starting with the, chicken reshmi malai kabab it was wonderful, the chicken was juicy and tender. Then move on to mutton biryani with chicken chaap.

A nice little place where you can go in and have a good time with your friends, partner or any other human being you fancy taking with you. As the name suggests, they only serve Mughlai food which, according to the price, is delicious per se. Specialities are their Malai Reshmi Kabab, mutton biriyani(less oil; as many of you would fancy) and chicken chap. Location is a bit off though. Nonetheless,the food is something to be reckoned with. People living in Dum Dum or in nearby area can have a try at this place.

Mughal khaan has a self-explanatory name. While the decor would remind you of Oudh 1590, the mutton curry would remind you of Royal. Had special mutton biryani, special chicken biryani, mutton chap and chicken reshmi malai kebab. Since it is in dumdum, this may well be the biryani destination of this portion of the suburb in near future. The mutton in the biryani could've been a bit juicier, however I tasted the chicken and it was fantastic. The kebab is just perfect, slightly less softness wouldn't have hurt though. But the mutton curry was absolutely masterclass. They can develop it into a signature dish if they wish to. The only bad thing, although I won't call it bad, was that biryani was over by the time we reached so we had to wait for 40 mins. However, this is not their fault. Overall a nice experience.

It was a lovely experience. We went with our gang of friends for a birthday party celebration. since the restaurant was new we didn't expected much but we were really surprised by their hospitality. The ambience is good. they have good staff. food quality and quantity both are standard. Overall we enjoyed the evening.

People who are fond of Mughal cuisines will love Mughal Khaan for sure. Well, being a foodie, I keep on exploring newly opened  eateries for good quality and quirky taste. So I came to know about this place from a friend and after trying their forte I must say that they certainly serve one of the finest biriyani in kolkata. 
The soothing aroma of the biriyani and the texture of the mutton chaap is just mouth watering. 
No, the house doesn't cover a large area but the neatly decorated interiors and the wonderful classical playlist will set your mood for the MUGHAL food.
The warm greeting and  the expeditious service by the people are immensely satisfying and appreciating.
I would suggest the  mutton biriyani and the mutton/chicken chaap.
So do visit and enjoy the meal with your loved ones.
I didn't regret but you ll definitely do if you don't give it a shot...

And yes, revisit the place before you review it.

Being a Bengali, biryani along with chicken tandoori is all one can expect on a Sunday afternoon. I had order a chicken biryani and tandoori chicken and reshmi butter masala and rumali roti.. along with the low cost the quality was also adequate. The reshmi butter chicken were perfectly cooked, juicy and succulent. Overall it was worth a try.

👍better than darao prothik bor. The biryani here was very good. The rice was soft and the meat was tender and juicy. Wil definitely recommend this over all the other biryani places in and around dum dum, nagerbazar.

I had seen their high rating in zomato and had ordered their mutton biryani and chicken tandoori delivered. The delivery was prompt  and the food was hot. Now onto the quality. First of all the tandoori was really tender and succulent, and the spices had penetrated well inside the meat. Their chutney is worth a mention and the biryani rice literally melted in the mouth and wasn't very oily ,neither it had very strong essence which I really liked.  The mutton was soft and very tender and they had given a good size of mutton too. I would definitely recommend the biryani and tandoor.

Last Saturday I along with my foodie pals dropped in... the first impression of the place was 'wOw'... the ambience/decoration was stupendous.
Coming to the food.... Mughlai is all about Biriyani (for me at least), despite of having such limited options on the list, Biriyani was unavailable which was annoying... however, for starters we ordered Chicken Malai Kabab and Chicken Tikka Kabab; unlike random 'para' restaurants the meat was juicy and tender.. the spices were well proportionate.. limited oil used... loved it...
In main course we had Rumali roti, chicken tikka butter masala and reshmi butter masala... yeah u heard it right... we had to make the same choices all over again as very few options were available by then...
My expectation was to get the same gravy with different colours into it :D
Keeping the prediction aside when I gave them a try... I was awestruck as both were very good... though the oil quantity in that tikka masala was a bit on the higher side which didn't cause acidity surprisingly!! The size of the Rumali roti was not up to the mark.. so my suggestion would be, make the circumference a bit bigger ;)
Coming to the service: to the managers, dude you need it to do a serious improvement on this part! We had to wait for 20 mins on average for each course to begin... which was really annoying but this can be improved any day... this is considerable for a newly started restaurant! !
Moreover, great job guys... keep up the spirit!! I wud love to come back for that Biriyani :P
p.s. the 10% discount added a red cherry on the top of our satisfaction level...
Would rate 3.8 this plc... which is gr8 but there s always a room for improvement

The restaurant is in a small road near motijheel art college. The decoration inside this place is very good and they give the food in copper plates and glasses. Old era music is played inside the shop. The people there are very nice and warm.We had started with tandoori chicken. It was very well marinated and very soft .Then wehad the biryani. The mutton was very soft and nice, the rice was also very soft and well spiced , but very light and had hardly any scent of aatar. and the staff's had suggested the chaap , which I really liked very much. It was really very good. Will come again.

Mughal Khaan is not just another restaurant, it is an ineffable experience for all your senses. As you step into the restaurant, treat your eyes to the beautifully themed colour coordinated interior decor or lend an ear to the soothing gazals that floats in the air, even touch the thoughtfully designed wooden furnishing or the attentive selection of cutlery, or dip yourself in the inviting smell of the tandoor. When you step into Mughal Khaan, you actually leave the hustle and bustle of big city and enter an enchanted relm, reminisce of a golden era.
Then when the food arrives to your table, served with a smile, you will realise the essential promise of this restaurant, it's cuisine which singularly is enough for you to frequent the place. 
Thanks for an wonderful evening. Here is to wishing a lot more visits!

Located near motijheel art college , surer math. This is a very new restaurant. They serve only Michal cuisine. Their signature dish is the mutton biryani. The mutton is really soft and juicy and the rice melts in your mouth. Try the mutton cheap along with this and you will simply love it.

We bumped into this place near surer math while searching for a decent mughal restaurant. On entering, one will draw parallel with the famous oudh. It has taken a lot of inspiration from it for creating its decor and ambience. Coming to the food, we had ordered for mutton chap, chicken tikka butter masala and rumali ruti. The quantity and quality were great, especially the mutton chap had a delicious gravy. However being a newbie in this sector they dont hv an elaborate menu. We said this to the owner also. Staffs were courteous and took our review about the food which was a warm gesture. Will surely visit this place again.

Update: just had lunch yesterday,used a little voucher,they have good deals on little.check them out.

Had mutton biriani which was very good as usual the softest mutton pc , though i found the the quality of rice a little low from last time, the chicken chap had big chicken pc,soft but the gravy was kind of low on taste, compared to other places like aminia and arsalan or dada boudi.it needs some improvement.


Lovely little place.nice setup, fantastic food.went there on my lunch break,it right in the ally of dumdum arts clg,i didn't see any sign but recognized it by the door,they should put a big sign.
Now coming to the food,i ordered a mutton biriani and mutton chap,it took about 10-15 mins but it was worth the wait.the biriani was fantastic.perfect amount of rice flavor aloo and soft mutton pc,the chap was very tasty too,the mutton was very soft again,i was full by the end of it.will visit again to try some kababs also.keep up the good work

I had bookmarked this place after seeing them in zomatos newly opened collection.  The place is very nearby to my home so decided to drop in today for our dinner.  The place is situated very near to motijheel art college inside surer math. Its like a 2 mins walk from the main road. First of all i was really impressed by the decor and ambiance . They have put a lot of thought into the decor to match with the mughal period, if not completely but definitely most of it. From the wooden door to lion sigils as door knockers to intricately carved chairs to great looking tables with a feel , the chandeliers and warm yellow lights , to the thoughtfully selected floor and wall tiles, from the thumris and sufi songs of past to the copper utensils .  But the most beautiful section i found was the washroom with its marvellous selection of tiles and that golden sunflower mirror, everything added to the feel and ambiance of this place.  Now coming to the food , we had ordered a mutton biryani, chicken tandoori and chicken tikka kebabs. The kebabs were tender and moist and you could feel the spices deep inside the meat.  The tandoor was also well burnt and very tender. But i would say its the biryani which takes the cake. The biryani rice literally melted in our mouths. And despite being light the biryani had thoroughly mixed spices and the mutton was so tender and juicy that you hardly had to work to break the mutton . And most importantly it was neither oily nor did it give a bad burp suggesting that they dont possibly use dalda. The biryani was sufficient in quantity so was the kebab(6pcs) and the size of tandoors. The price for this quality of food is quite definitely underpriced, moreover they are offering 10%off for this month.  And now to the service, well it seems the young owner himself looks after the service and was very polite and warm. He had even suggested the mutton chaap along with the biryani which we hope to try the next time.  And most importantly unlike other times after having a biryani, i walked back home which is like15 mins away with feeling bloated or lethargic. All i have to say is that maybe they can fill up the walls with something , they look a tad bit empty. Hope to visit soon.

Very nice food. Biriyani does have a Mughal Flavour. Home delivery was swift and fast. Food was warm and quantity was also great. Got a surprise 10% off also. 
Something to value add would be a light fried boiled egg and Thick raita with pepper. With this taste definitely 10-15 rs can be paid extra. Good going.

Just had food in Mughal Khaan. The ambience is real nice with a very royal look. The place looks beautiful. I had the mutton biryani and the chicken cheap. The biryani was cooked well.  And the meat was soft. The chaap was good and goes well with the rice. The service should become better with time.

Mughal Khaan - the name defines the place itself. Right from the main entrance door, the design of chair tables, the plates, glasses everything has got a nice touch of "রাজবাড়ি". I came to know about this place from a very close school friend of mine and was planning to experience the local "oudh 1590". Finally this evening we dropped in here. Tried mutton biriyani and chicken chap. Well, I will not be biassed because the place is in my locality, but definitely the biriyani was really nice - Generally the other famous biriyani joints focus more on keeping the preparation light and as a result the taste for the rice of the biriyani is somehow compromised. And here is the catch of Mughal Khan's biriyani - even if I keep aside the mutton pc, there was a succulent north indian ecstacy in the rice.
Coming to the mutton - very nicely boiled pc - which is for me the very first criteria to get appreciated. The chicken chaap was very oily but I would go with the taste because no one has ever experienced a "diet chicken chaap" ever in the world!! Definitely worth a try!!
Few points to highlight -
1. There should be a hoarding with the name of the restaurant in front of the entrance - I understand that they are the new kid in the town and they have plenty of learnings ahead but this is basic bro!!😎😎
2. They have to start serving kebabs very soon - whenever an item is in the menu and when being asked, the customer gets a negative answer, it automatically creates a not so good impression
3. Car parking is an issue, better you park the car on dum dum road and walk thru the lane just opposite to Grihasree.
4. Price of the items are standard and they don't charge the vat yet.

Overall, I would say its a good place to try north indian cuisine and I wish them all the very best for their growth in ensuing times.

Though a newly-started venture, the people behind the place sure do know about what they want and their research strikes all the right chords.

If you are a true-blue foodie who boast of their Mughlai preferences, you have to pay a visit here. The mutton biryani that they serve is definitely the highlight of the menu. Not to forget the kebabs, which is the perfect start to your gastronomical journey here!

One can't help but admire the minutest detail that has been kept in mind for the decor of the place. Everything has been carefully hand-picked to set the temper of the place. So, this little gem of a place should be the next destination if you are looking for a memorable dining experience in DumDum!!

Cheers to the Team!

Looking forward to visit again.
