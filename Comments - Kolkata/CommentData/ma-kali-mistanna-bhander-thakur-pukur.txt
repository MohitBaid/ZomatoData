This is the probaby the best sweet shop in our locality till this day. We are a regular customer of this shop. Tried various items namely Mishti Doi, Raj Bhog, Rosogolla, Milk cake, Nolen Gurer Sandesh, Lord Chom Chom, Laddu, Goja, Patishipta etc. all are my favorites. To me they serve the best Doi.

This is quite an old sweet shop located in Thakurpukur area. Today my father brought the Joynogor'er moya from there which is a traditional Bengali sweet for this season. The moyas tasted awesome. Wasn't too sweet, which is a positive thing. Had the perfect blend of everything. The pati-shaptas didn't taste good. The coconut filling inside was good but not the outer wrap. And there were narkel narus too. Didn't like them much. Too much jaggery was used.

One of the oldest and best sweet shops in the thakurpukur area,with good rasogollas and bengali sweets. The samosas are good too. Staff, being proud of the popularity of the place, is a little haughty.

It is located at 3A bus stand. Most of the sweets we eat comes from this shop. have been their customer from the past decade and there's not even a single instance of poor quality issues...price is on the higher side which is a bit of negativity...

One of the best sweet selling shops in this area. It's a small sweet shop with zero ambience but I can assure you that you won't get any complaints. The quality is superb no doubt about it, yes the price is little bit higher but the food will never disappoint you. I have tried their all items from my childhood till date and all of them are my favourite. So 4.5 for it.
