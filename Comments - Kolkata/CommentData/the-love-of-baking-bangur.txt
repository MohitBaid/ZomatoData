The love of baking is something very close to me. Because of its quality, because the kind of hygiene they maintain. Located in bangur , this place would surely win your heart.

Well i ordered for a blueberry cheesecake for my mom's birthday. Ordering was super easy and done on whatsapp. 
The cake was just awesome and one of the best cheesecakes i have had. Loved the addition of the blueberries in the cheese layer. 
Cant wait to try out the other cakes and cupcakes.

Okay, so here goes my first review on Zomato! (I have always been an avid user of Zomato as I am a connoisseur of food but never had that in me to write reviews, maybe because of the fact that I am not poised to be a writer, just a foodie ;)! I have always also been on the other side of the table while on Zomato, but off course times change and so does your point of views!

Ummmm....I think, it's been a long time since you started reading this review to know about "The Love of Baking" but instead you came to know about my junk more than that. 

Alright, then, let's start! So...I have been knowing this place since they were buds and there was no intent of getting to Zomato and were a small scale home run unit (it still is run from home, though)

I have been a fan of their Cakes and chocolates forever! The first time, I tried them was when I went to a friend's party and the cake was done by them. With the first pop into the mouth, I completely fell in love with the cake. Baked totally to the perfection and the right amount of each of the Ingredients. 

As such, Ordered one cake for a party of about 200 people (my daughter's first). The picture of the cake is also on the photos. Tagged as #candyland #customizedcake. Although, they were not experienced for this large scale cake (at that time), it turned out to be perfect!

Tell you what, will keep ordering cakes from here. Keep Going!

PS: Must Try ---- Fruit Cakes

Well, what can u say about this awesome little home bakery... The Fruit Gateau that they make is out of the world and me and my friends keep ordering it almost every other weekend just to eat it as an aftermeal desert (sometime b4 meals, and sometimes that is the only meal that v have for the day as v order atleast a 2 pounder) Their cakes are viciously delicious and are sure to put weight on all your efforts of getting that perfect body or even a 2 pack, forget 6 or 8.
*drools while writing review, wipes saliva from the side of the mouth, picks up the phone and orders the cake*
