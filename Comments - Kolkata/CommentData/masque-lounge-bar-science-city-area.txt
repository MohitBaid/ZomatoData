the worst place i have ever been to in kolkata.. it dont deserve any rating.. totally low grade place and full of shit people.. in the morning i called them up and asked them if there was any entry fee and they said "no".., bit after we reached there they said we have to pay 1000per head.. we were sorting out the problem with the staff and suddenly the manager (he is a piece of shit) came up to us and instead of sorting out the problem he started misbehaving... he straight came up to me and soo close to my face and was arguing with me.. when i asked him to step back n behave properly he started shouting and was really misbehaving... totally a low grade place.. the manager is mannerless and behaves like an uneducated loafer. Dont visit ever..!!!

I had organised office party of 30-40 people twice there. The place lives up in terms of a place where we can gather to have booze with a medium sized office gathering.

Too less lighting. And the place doesn't feel very upmarket. Food is okay....6/10. Price per person with unlimited specified drinks is also okay. Snacks that comes along with the package is decent. Except that you don't see those guys circulating around very too often and you end up with nothing but peanuts.

Overall a fair enough place to do incentive dinner for office.

It's a okay place to go. We went there reading a good reviews from zomato. But sadly it was Saturday and they don't go as zomato bill on Saturdays. Prices are little bit higher . Staffs are friendly and polite. The best thing is the DJ over there. There is a pool table which we thought is free to play but per shot they charge Rs 100. For girls the entry is free and for boys and couple it's 1000 stag. The crowd mainly happens after 11pm.

Decor is cool with dinning arrangement on one corner and the dance floor, pool games spreaded across rest of the area of the lounge. Tried their chocolate martini served in a molecular equipment which is really amazing. Service is fast.

The pub is located at a posh area. But the overall experience was below average. It was a corporate party, the pub being shared by 2 different parties. The starters seemed a bit uncooked, especially baby corn. Chicken tikka kebab was perhaps the only dish which was making rounds regularly, but even that wasn't too impressive. Choices in main course were very limited. The best dish was probably gulab jamun. Since it was a corporate party, it was an open bar. However the whisky seemed to be diluted as even large pegs weren't able to give the kick. The song selection of the DJ was good, playing a good combination of Bollywood new releases and English beats. But he lacked DJ'ing skills a big time. Mainland China on the same floor is a better option if you are planning to spend 2000 for dinner.

On a recent trip to Kolkata, we decided to pop over to the silver springs arcade for dinner. Trying to find something other than MC or Sigree led us into this place. Shady, seedy and absolutely avoidable is the best way to describe this place. I suspect it caters to a slightly dubious clientele. Needless to say we scampered out pretty fast!

The first impression was that of a rundown place selling corona pint for 700 bucks ! Looked conveniently overpriced...convenient for the management as they claimed that they had no other beer than budweiser and corona !

A bit of name dropping and threat to write a review on zomato led to sudden discovery of Fosters by the waiter...such serendipity!

Having said that, the food was good especially the hara bhara kabab, the service as such was good but the music and the ambience (including the roach on the table) was not that good...

Overall not a place i would like to return to...

Even at half past 8, there were only 5 of us present here on a New Year's eve. I think that's terribly sad and here's why.

Finding this place is simple. Silver spring arcade is well-connected by E. M. Bypass.It's a small but spacious 2-storeyed lounge/bar/disc with decor & music that displays fine taste. The manager is a courteous man who showed us around and the staff is very well-behaved.

We started our meal with a non-veg kebab platter. The kebabs were juicy and had right amount of spices and it complemented our Bloody Mary and Blue Lagoon perfectly. The main course comprised of Cantonese chowmein, which was slightly bland but the Sweet & Sour Chicken gave us nothing to complain about. We ordered the Masque Special Sundae for dessert and although the promised strawberry was missing, the food was sumptuous. The cheque came to Rs.2500 approx.

The only thing that is a bit of a concern here is the serving time, but again you cannot really blame them because they cook everything fresh from scratch which is obviously time consuming. There is the pool table where you can spend your time while your dish arrives.

I had a really good time here at a reasonable cost. I have no complaints and I see absolutely no reason why this place does not deserve to be crowded on a NYE. I'm looking forward to visiting again soon.

I went there for a party! It was a masked party!¬†
I liked the DJ n music out there. The dance floor is very spacious and gives a nice area for 15-odd people to move around freely.
It's a good family lounge but considering its location, it could be much more improved and publicized...
The food was good. The lamb and fish was great and the darsan rocked! The waiters were courteous and served us well.
It should be promoted better coz it loses in the battle of the silver arcade restaurants.¬†
Also I happened to see the menu card and considering its a pub, its pretty affordable.
Overall it's a nice place that has huge potential it's main plus being the location,dance floor and good food!!

I have mixed reviews about this place. Will have to admit that the lounge is very spacious with good seating arrangements. They have a dj but somehow failed to impress me with his collection. Old remixes was a let down. To be honest considering its location , ambiance, space,decor they could actually do more and add more spark to draw more crowd. The waiters were little dumb and seemed unprofessional. this place really lacks good publicity. I think they shud have better management and PR to promote the club.

Coming to the food. Surprisingly good. Their dry chilly chicken and tangri kebabs were really nice. They have good offers but slow service. At one point we had to remind them of the order. Price was okay but when the place fails to impress you, the bill feels like a pain. The crowd was just okay.

Overall an average 50-50 experience.

Though the night club is also cool ;) They have pool dancers too for saturday nights and remain open till 6 a.m. moring. Btw, the quality of food is quiet good. Though the serving time for tandoor items are quiet high it is a nice place and have perfect value for money. I'm gonna visit the restaurant again. Its very good :)

This place has lotsss to improve upon. Being a restopub,it has a dance floor and a proper bar,a dj and also a dining area. Ita located in the Silver Arcade building on E M Bypass. 
The interiors of this place are above average and the music is okay. The dance floor attracts the crowd to this place. The pocket pinch also wont be much (500-700) considering its a restopub,which are generally quite expensive.
But this place lacks the x-factor. Maybe it loses out because of competition from one of the best reatraus in the same building (mainland china,sigree). 
Overall, a place which has potential,but really has to work hard for a makeover.

On Ashtami, we had booked a cab for the entire night to drive down the roads of Kolkata and enjoy some pandal hopping. Food is an essential part of the festivity and fun. Munching on some savories and tidbits like Puchka and Egg roll and having dinner on the way, were an important part of the plan. We had dropped the idea of going to Park Street for dinner since we had the faintest hope of getting a table for eight on the most important and popular day of Bengali's biggest festival. We headed to Salt Lake instead.

Masque, a Restopub was located in Silver Arcade on EM Bypass next to Bartaman Office. It was a great discovery by us on that particular day. It was a lounge with a dance floor, playing some of the latest top Bollywood numbers and the biggest draw for us was that it was not at all crowded. The staff were also very courteous and attentive.

We ordered two plates each of Malai Kebab, Reshmi Kebab and Tangri Kebab. We did not order any drinks since Ashtami is a dry day in Kolkata. While the food was prepared and served, we made our way to the dance floor and grooved to the music. All the dishes were typical but good. I liked Malai Kebab the most since it is my personal favorite. For main course we ordered one Jeera Rice, one Chicken Bharta, two Chicken Chowmein and two Chicken Fried Rice. I enjoyed the Jeera Rice and Chicken Bharta. The Chowmein and Fried Rice were quite juicy and could be eaten without a side dish though some had it with Chicken Bharta.

Our total bill came to a paltry sum of Rs. 2450 for eight. Though we did not order a lot of items, the quantity was good. The service and the ambiance were also worth mentioning. We came out fully satisfied and happy.

P.S. - Masque probably gets overshadowed by other bigger restaurants like Mainland China, Oh! Calcutta and Sigree, in the same building. But this is definitely worth trying out especially for party nights.

I went to this place when my cousin brother decided to treat me. The Silver Arcade building looked nice and i was hoping the interiors would be good too. The interiors were nice looking and the employees were polite and behaved well with us too.
The amount in starters ordered were very paltry for the given price.  I had to face very bad service that day. The rice we ordered at intervals came very late. we joked that when we place ordeer for rice, its as if it is being bought from outside and so the time lag. Other than that the food quality was quite good and served well. Just improve service time and food quantity, then this would be a very different Masque
