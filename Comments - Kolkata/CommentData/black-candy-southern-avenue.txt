The food tastes pretty good! Feels just like home. The owner is really sweet and it’s a pretty cool place to chill with your friends. Service could be faster though.

Just sitting here for a dinner... Very romantic ambiance... Though the rating is poor in zomato, expecting something better, let's check this out , ordered momo, it was okay since thick layer of maida and spicy, well we'll well, there is no mistake to come here, but having food is a disaster...we ordered simple Chili chicken and Hakka fried rice... Oppps what a terrible taste... Avoid..

I regret the day we went in to this place for a quick snack. Forget quick... they served our first dish after 1 hour and the other one after 1.5 hours. They have both outdoor and indoor seating. The outdoor seating is better. The staffs are practically clueless. Coming to the food, we ordered American chicken chopsuey which was too sweet and dry. The roast chicken was shit... Plain Shit. The sunny side up egg was cold, the chicken raw. When we complained, the manager said this is how roast chicken is cooked. Yeah right! May be in his eatery. Never ever visit this place if you don't want to waste your money. I wish I could give them negative rating.

A ground floor of a house. Only bean-bags available. Food takes an eternity to arrive. And then tastes horrible. They call this place a "Hookah Bar" , but it's a total misnomer. Never coming here again.

One of the most horrible hookah parlours I have been to recently. I didn't like anything about this hookah parlour. This is sitauted somewhere near VP. Nothing extra ordinary to mention. It's the ground floor of a house which has been turned into cafe. Ordered their dry chilli chicken and to my utter disappointment it tasted absolutely rubbish. They were burnt and tasted too bitter, when complained the manager, he in return said that, that was the exact taste of dry chilli chicken. The manager wasn't cooperative at all.

Went there a few months back with friends... . M not a very hookah person but I really liked it there... but what I liked the most was the pan fried momo... my mouth becomes watery when I still think of it.... I could find not a single place where the momo is as tasty, not even near it...
Best part they have an outdoor seating.

Need some serious management. The place is well decorated. You can sit outdoor as well as indoor. But the food was not upto the mark. Only one person is there to take care of everything. They can work on it and make it a better place

Horrible place, all dusty, the one who happens to be the waiter is the cook himself as well as the cashier. The owner is sometimes seen flocking around trying to help out in choosing from the menu. I had chicken steamed and pan fried momos which was horrible. The stuffing was minimum n chicken was almost just an odour! The pan fried momo was soooo spicy that it burnt our taste buds! Over all its just a horrible place to visit..!!!!

This is the place I always like to visit everytime I come to Calcutta. The place is small but tastefully done interior add quite a character to it . Momos , Chinese & thai soups are my favourite there , a must try and offcourse the hookah .
I personally like sitting in the lawn enjoying my food in the summer evening n chatting with friends for hours. So folks if you like great food at an unbelievable pocket friendly budget with homely environment , this is the place to be..

All I can say is wierd. God! I was happy that I could come out of the cafe. Wierd sitting arrangements with equally wierd decor and lighting. Momo was the only food which was palatable. Service was waylaid. At times the waiter cum cook seemed clueless. Never ever again.

Its possibly the worst place you can ever go to. The cook/waiter roams around in his knickers trying to control the general public from not using his restroom rather than serving us food. And to top it all coming to customers and gossiping about those restroom users. 

And even if we ignore all this.. The food is crap! Quite bad! Except the wai wai.. Coz they dont have to do cook it much! Its kinda ready made!!

So guys come here if you are really bored and want to take ur frustration out on someone else. 

Cheers!!

This is the place where i had the first hookah of my life. Yes, it holds some nostalgia therefore. Back in those days, there werent many hookah parlours in kolkata. My first experience was a tuition bunking one after school. I was, thus, in my uniform and was apprehensive of going for a hookah in it (read: i was young and scared). But on reaching i saw there were hardly many people. It was a small place, mostly the drawing room turned into a sheesha cafe. Very dimly lit and sheesha at just 150rs? Whoa! Then onwards i kept frequenting the place for quite sometime. The owner Prithvi was very sweet and his attendant was a bit rude but tolerable. Never tried any finger food. We were new to the sheesha experience and thats what only mattered. A bit difficult to locate as it is discreetly tucked away in one of the by lanes of triangular park near gariahat. I havent been there for quite some time and dont know if they have changed anything or not. For a quiet evening, im sure black candy is a place you would like to visit. Cheerie!
