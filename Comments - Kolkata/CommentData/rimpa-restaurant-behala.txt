Very Poor service and no proper system in order receive and delivery... Poor and very unprofessional behaviour with customers.... We are so much disappointed....

We had nothing to do so had to search for food here. It was decent but too oily. Hope to have better from here sometime soon.
This is near Behala.

Located near the muchipara auto stand beside Sugar and Spices. Taste of food is just average. Ordered chicken roll - the paratha was just dipped in oil with no taste with very limited chicken filling.

Given that this place is 5mins from my place and I have had a 100 odd meals from this place maybe am a bit biased.. but I feel this is a decent food joint given the price quality ratio. The kebabs and Indian food are okayish... the Chinese items do need improvement but then they do have an amazing dry chilly chicken. Overall as long as you don't sit there to eat u wnt hate the restaurant..

Well finally Rimpa is on zomato.  I don't know exactly how many I have been there.  They serve very good food at a reasonable price. I love their mixed fried rice very , both quantity and quality wise. Rolls and moghlai parathas are also very good. And tikkas . tikkas are very good and too too reasonable .

I think they  use a whole packet of sugar to prepare a chicken dish . Not all preparations are worse here . I ate noodles once and it was quite good. But it is quite unexpected that it have managed a place in zomato.

This place is just 15 min away from my home(I am talking about walking)..I have very few options nearby my area and this is one of them.
Food quantity is good..price is moderate.
Their momos are good and rest of the Chinese dishes are average and above average in some cases.they also make rolls and parathas..overall a good joint.and I think it is best to take away food from this place.

I just dont believe this place is on zomato.. I mean i have been to this place only once in my life and that too last durga ashtami. I know its too long ago but the experience i had was soo disastrous that i cant control myself from writing the review..

Location ---- this place is located at muchipara , behala chowrasta . This place is located on the road from chowrasta to tollygunje.

Ambience ------ no ambience, just a road side stall type in the front. And a small room with some plastic table chairs..

Food ----- ohh horrible!! Actually i had ordered chicken reshmi kebab, chicken do piyaza, chowmin. The kebab was not upto the mark and to some extent over cooked ( burnt to be precise ).. Next the chicken gravy item was sweet.. I mean as if they had put loads and loads of sugar in it. And there was no piyaz in do piyaza. :-P
The chowmin was nothing less.. The dish was oily and sticky. No vegies and a smell came from that item. Soo in my opinion absolutely horrendous..

I dont know if this horrible thing happened because of excessive load during pujas or what but my eating experience was not good at all.

Not recommended guys!! Trust me. Be a little hungry. Opt for panipuri but not this... Please. Sorry but a harsh truth.
