Too much bad place to eat.. Specially when you are hungry..!! Quality as well as quantity..both are bad.. It's not a hygenic place too..you can see house-flies moving around your food..even though you seat in AC..!!!! Lastly behavior of the manager is not good.. Totally depressed with this restaurant..ðŸ˜¤

Quality of biriyani has very much detoriated over the past year though the quantity is fair enough and the price is pocket friendly. Once ordered chilly paneer which was horrible so after that never ordered any other item.

Pros.

1. Food quality is good.
2. Lots of variety in food menu.
3. Best chilly chicken/paneer/mashroom ever. Better than silver chimney.

Cons.

1. Usually they say it will take 15 minutes. It means 40 Minutes minimum. Hence its better to get it deliver at home then to stand there like a fool.

Had a very bad experience, with pathetic food quality and disastrous time management.
