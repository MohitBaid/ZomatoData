Tried the white sauce chicken pasta. Took too long to serve. The owner/manager/cook were all the same as it seems. The pasta was too runny and had microscopic pieces of chicken in it. The penne were undercooked. There is no seating arrangement on top of it. Didn't like it all.

Pizza Kolkata provides pizza at a very low price compared to other junctions like Dominos, Pizza Hut or Eagle Boys.
But they take a very long time to deliver food (more than 1hour ) unlike other junctions
The crust of the pizza is not that good and the choice of crust is also limited.

We ordered one chicken farm house pizzaâ€‹. It was delivered within thirty minutes. The taste was awesome, full of chicken and the pizza sauce they used is lit ðŸ”¥. The pizza was full of flavours and good quality cheese. This is one of the best pizza I had in Kolkata. Comparison with other pizza giants this shop totally stands out great. It's cheap tasty and service is top notch. Will order soon. Would have given it a 5 but I haven't tasted all their dishes so I'll save that marks for the later . It's a must ordering place for the students and a hidden gem in garia.

The farmhouse pizza and paneer tandoori pizza are good..I used to order from here as the seating arrangement is not good..they always do deliver on time...but recently I ordered chicken lasagne and it was too bad and the ingredients they used were soo poor... I am seriously disappointed and will not order again..

I've ordered a lot of pizzas from this place, they are really good, each with distinct tastes and I love them all.
Today I ordered a Double Chk Lasagna and a Shawarma roll. Utterly disappointed with the Shawarma! Pita bread was rock hard, filling is less and not good at all.
The Lasagne was good, pretty generous amount!
The main disadvantage of this place, after placing so many orders is their delivery time! They are always late, even sometimes, an hour!!

I found this restaurant while searching in Zomato and after seeing favorable reviews, decided to try it out. Placed an home delivery order for Sunday lunch at 11-10am, originally scheduled at 12-30pm. The guy at phone was pretty helpful and suggestive. Food was delivered at around 1-10pm, around 40 min late. Considering the place is not so far from my house, I could say there's a scope for improvement. 

For the lunch, we decided not to go for pizza and instead had ordered other dishes. The fish and chips had been good, though it was not traditionally fried battered fish. It was more of breadcrumbed fish fry we find in Kolkata but tasted pretty good, which mattered. 2 big sized fried fish with french fries complemented by mayo sauce... 

I personally liked their Meifoon. They had egg and chicken in it, filled in with mushroom and corn as well. The guy at phone told me that they are currently out of prawn supply so ideally there may have been some prawn also in it. The amount was generous and would have been good for 2. The Cantonese Noodles was good taste-wise and again the amount had been pretty generous. The side dish, which was Chicken Manchurian was taste-wise OK. But a side dish containing 10 pieces of boneless chicken, not very commonly seen elsewhere. Surely a deal at this price. The meifoon and noodles were all light and less oily. Overall I am pretty satisfied with the food. Good to have a convenient delivery option nearby. For all the above-mentioned food, the bill was ony Rs 690 with no mockery of VAT or any other taxes. 

So lets put my rating point-wise:

Location: Near Garia which is a prime location in this part of the city, haven't visited personally so cannot comment.

Environment: Again, haven't visited so cannot comment. 

Food Quantity: Quite generous. (5)

Food Quality: Pretty good. As a less-known restaurant, didn't have much expectation originally but was not disappointed. Every item was spot on. Quality was good, light on stomach and quality of ingredients quite high. The chicken side dish, 10 big pieces of boneless chicken, was definitely beyond my expectation. (5)

Delivery Time: Could have been better but on a leisurely Sunday afternoon, it was sort of OK. (4)

Overall Rating: 4.5

Recommendation: Worth a visit or home delivery.

worst Pizaa of my life!!Â Â Â  tyhey are very hard working people with no idea how to make a pizza, i ordered kolkata special pizza cosr 190 rs , chose "pizza Brust"Â  ( its not a typo , Brust they wrote) , for additional 80, so it costed 280Â Â  , they do not use mozarella cheese , and the dough was bitter , the upper crust was like skin , could not eat whole , wasted ,Â Â Â  for this amount you will get much better at dominos, pizzahut , 

also earlier i chose double chicken burger, chicken patty was dry, bun was ok, but portion of mayonese was little , so the overall burger was very dry, it costed 150 rs, and we get kFC burger with extra chese for 145 which is juicy and far better , this shgop is a dissapointment ,

The variety in menu is amazing.
On four different occasions, I tried their different pizzas and is impressed with the toppings.
The 'creamy folded lasagne' is amazing and so is 'double chicken lasagne' and Shepherds pie.

So this was on my mind for a long time. Finally ordered home delivery. The person who picked up the phone, was very friendly. Food was delivered about 50 min late, which is acceptable. Faster would have been better.Â 
Coming to the food, there was huge quantity of toppings. We ordered Large Chicken Extravagenia and Medium Chicken Bolognese, both with extra cheese and also Boneless Dry Chilli Chicken. The chilli chicken had 10 small sized pieces, but it was quite spicy and we liked it. The pizza was good with toppings and all, but when I ordered extra cheese, I expected a bit more cheese to come along. Oh well. No cheese burst. Size was good.
But very pocket friendly for a college student like me, to order when friends come along. And when you are not in mind for ordering from the Dominoses, and the large loot you incur.
Keep it up!

I have the experience of their home deliveries. It was very promptly delivered in Garia. The owner is really very down to earth.
We order a Kolkata special pizza medium sized. It was very yummy with ample toppings and cheese. And the Italian bangla punch was that it was provided with kasundi instead of oregano sachets and trust me people pizza with kasundi was really awesome.
The ordered chicken shepherd pie was also great with a top layer of mashed potatoes and the bottom layer full of chicken with tangy tomatoes. We really loved that.
The ordered double layer chicken lasagna was beyond our gastric capacity so that was eaten at some other time the next day. I rate it the next best lasagna after spaghetti kitchen!! I loved the lasagna.
And all these at 725â‚¹ inclusive of all taxes!!!
Next time we ordered a farmhouse chicken pizzas which arrived with salamis and much more. It was good.
Their pizzas are better than dominoes.
Their Chinese is also great. Simple and tasty. With lots of fresh veggies and less in oil. There were too many chicken pieces in a plate of chilli chicken. Their veg noodles was good. Best was the Kolkata special fried rice which came with all assortment and tasted unique.
Way to go...
Keep the reputation up.

Good to see this little joint on Zomato. I've never been to this place but have had food delivered from here countless number of times and the one dish that stands out is the Double chicken lasagne. It's amazing how such a tiny joint serves literally the best lasagne I've ever had. It's an absolutely delightful dish with minced chicken that tastes heavenly, in between two layers of pasta sheets and the perfect sauce. Sheer perfection. Also love their Grilled bhetki with lemon sauce and the Spaghetti mexicana. The chinese is pretty decent too. Yet to try out their pizzas.

A nice place to try for a change from regular pizza outlets.Good for home delivery. The pizza was mediocre, although the crust should improve. A softer, butter or cheese crust would have made it better. Hope to see improvements soon. Overall, a value for money place.

I'v nvr tried ne pizzas bt mixed fri-rice, thai fr-rice, hongkon chnk, sweet corn soup, gravy noodles nd yes of course burger n they were pretty gud . Quality n quantity was gud enough bt a li'l expensive. So many time we'v orderd all these menu and were satisfied . 
Must try the pasta (spaghetti).

I have had pizzas delivered from this place countless times. Their quality has improved over the months and they do make decent pizzas. 
The point where this place scores over the dominoes and the pizza huts is their ample toppings. No complaints there. But unfortunately their toppings are oily sometimes. 
Service is pretty average and fluctuates. Try their chilli chicken pizza and their bacon pizzas. A very decent no frills place with decent pricing for your every day pizza cravings! 
P.s. I haven't felt like ordering anything else from this place ever.
