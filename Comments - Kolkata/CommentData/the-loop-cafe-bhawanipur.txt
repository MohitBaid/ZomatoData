Located in the Bhawanipur area, this cafe is a pretty good choice for eating out in the area. The cafe is large enough to fit big groups of people and I instantly liked the ambience of the place. But it is a bit dark inside with dim lights so if you prefer well lit places, this is not even close.

The quality of the food here is great as well, and the food is presented beautifully.

During my visit, I tried the Chicken Stroganoff and the Loaded BBQ Chicken Sandwich, both of which were absolutely delicious.
But my main gripe with the place is their pizza. I tried the BBQ Chicken Pizza and it was too thin, and while it didn't taste bad, it wasn't something extraordinary. I would recommend against trying the pizza from here. Otherwise the rest of the food were great.

For beverages I had the Oreo Shake which was good. I've had better ones but this one was not bad by any means and if you want to you can definitely try it out.

The pricing here is reasonable enough, and the staffs here are competent enough so no complaints on that front.

Overall, if not for a bad experience with the pizza, I really enjoyed my time and the quality of food here and would recommend this place to anyone.

Yes.. you will keep getting back to this place..on a "loop"..üòç
Not very difficult to locate if you have reached Lansdowne market, just a 3minutes walk.
Crispy chilli Baby corn..is the crispiest and the chilli-est baby corn I have ever tried.. followed by a super dooooper cheeeeeeeejy lasagna! üòç The "sone par suhaaga" dish is undoubtedly the paan mojito, refreshing and helps you to go non stop on the food front! üòã
If that's not enough, you get a chocolate freak shake to freak everything out of you topped with a ferrero rocher!üòç
Happiness, thee have been defined this evening ! üòö

Situated in  an odd location, this cafe has a weird ambience. In fact, very rarely have I been so disappointed with the ambience of any place I visit. The interiors are too dark, the seating arrangement is illogical, the wallpapers look so dull and boring. How can one not mention the loud music if one mentions loop cafe, it just makes matters worse especially when on the tv screen there is some other music video playing.
Coming to the food;
~Freak Shake- The taste of this shake was superb bit the presentation was really dull for a proper freak shake.
~Roasted Chicken salad- This was quite impressive because the chicken was really roasted to perfection.
~Cheese Chicken sandwich- This had a perfect filling and well toasted pieces of bread but I hated the fact the fries were fried in mustard oil. That's an utter let-down.
~Chicken Lollipop- It was fine except that the crust was too salty.
~Blue Lagoon- This was the winner of the day for me, so much of it was served and in a pretty way. It had the best taste too.
Except for the freak shakes all the other items are bought under happy hours menu @155 INR (increased price)
The service was okay, but there was too much delay in providing the bill and the handwritten bill looked bad. Also, they don't accept cards or Paytm.

Ambience :- pretty decent Ambience.. good wall decor.. comfy sofas with glass tables.. loud music.. perfectly lit.. and a big led TV..

Food:- 1) brownie shake :- it was simply yummylicious.. lipsmacking.. üòç üòç  one of the best shakes o have had.. really really good.. The crushed brownie on top of it was really yummy.. A must try..

2) Chicken and mayo sandwich :- 4 pieces of sandwiches loaded with chicken and mayo will give you a complete foodgasm..üòç it was overloaded with mayo and the French fries accompanying takes the dish to another level.. There was also a spicy mayo dip..

3) aussie chicken pizza :- It was really crunchy and tasty.. lots of cheese.. sundried tomatoes.. really huge in size.. can be easily shared by 3 to 4 persons..üòÄ

New cafe in the city! Located in Bhawanipur, few minutes walk from Hazra, this place is a must try! They have amazing food at extremely pocket friendly rates. We had ordered for White Sauce Pasta and Garlic Bread. Their garlic bread was supposedly handmade which was thin and crispy and quite different from the normal garlic bread. We also had the Mexican Chicken Salad and Cheese Chicken Sandwich served with fries. Great quantity and delicious! 
This is a great place to hang out with friends and enjoy good music and ambience with awesome food without making a hole in the pocket. I would recommend everyone to try out this place and I would surely visit again! üòä

This is a relatively new cafe located near Raj Banquet Hall. The place is not that large but it's not clumsy either, rather it's quite well spaced in my opinion. The Food we ordered were of good quality, it was though a bit delayed, was well cooked, well presented and tasted delicious. The staff were also friendly and attended us immediately. The ambience or the decoration of this place is nothing to ride home about but nevertheless it's not bland and is fairly okay I'd say. The music was a bit loud and didn't quite go well with the place's ambience but if you ignore these little facts, facts which can always be fixed in time, this place is definitely worth a try if you're looking for good food.

Beautiful cafe, great ambiance, quick service, good food! This is one of the most spacious cafes I've seen in Kolkata , and it's maintained very neatly. Good place to hang out with friends. Located at Ramesh Mitra Road, Near Ladies Park, Bhawanipur, Kolkata.

But It‚Äôs a new place neat and good ambiance with chill music which really sets the mood. They have a very healthy and interesting organic food menu.¬†

Foods and Beverages:¬†

DRINKS:

1) Cold Coffee :
This is a blended-coffee shake much like an iced cappuccino you might buy at this super restaurant.

2) Virgin Mojito :
This sweet taste accompanied by fragrance of mint and tangy lime makes you a really refreshing.

3) Paan Mojito :
Being a Bengali I sometimes enjoy meetha paan after dinner. As now a days lots of innovation is seen in food so just tried this mojito with lemon.

4) Brownie Shakes :
A double-chocolate shake becomes even more decadent with the addition of a brownie and Its Very good. One of my favorite.

Coming to food, I ordered

FOODS:

1) Fish Finger :
Marinated fish fingers dipped coated with bread crumbs and deep fried, this is their good starter.

2) Chicken Drumsticks :
These Chicken drumsticks are finger-lickin' good! They are tender and flavorful with a crisp salty skin.

3) Chicken Mayo Sandwich :
This are like comfort food but it's just good.

4) Chicken Alfredo Pasta:
This is a rich and creamy Alfredo sauce of butter, ricotta cheese, cream and Parmesan cheese. Extremely tasty and good.

5) Aussie Chicken Pizza :
¬†I love pizza. You're probably thinking, 'who doesn't?' but really, I'm pretty sure I love this pizza and their crust is thin and it's very good.

6) Roasted Fish In lemon butter :
This Baked fish with a delicious Lemon-Garlic butter sauce, served with mashed potatoes and herbed butter rice. Delicious and absolutely perfect for Summer.

Overall, It's great and awesome. This has got to be one of the prettiest cafe in this city. I love coming here precisely because of their ambiance and decor.
                    

Highly Recommended.

Located amidst the busy Lanes of bhawanipore, this newly opened Cafe is striking the right chord among the youth mainly due to it's vibrant decor, lively music and a diverse menu so if you are a fussy/choosy eater then you wouldn't be disappointed! 

Now coming to the focal point of this review, this place surely knows how to prepare and present their mojitos and shake's,they were unparalleled in taste and quality . The paan mojito, The virjin mojito and the brownie shake is highly recommend along with the cold coffee. 

Some of the must haves of this place are :

The drums of heaven: 4 humongous chicken legs are surely going to give you a heavenly feeling! Highly recommended! 

Aussie chicken pizza- Authentic and soul satisfying! Serves 3-4 comfortably! 

Chicken Mayo sandwich- The presentation of this dish was highly impressive and the quality and the taste complemented the beautiful presentation.

Fish finger- A good bargain if snack's are your fortay while visiting this place. 

Chicken Alfredo pasta- I was happy with the presentation and the taste though i felt that the proportion of chicken could have been slightly increased. 

Being relatively New, this place did manage to tick all the correct boxes. Looking forward to my next visit!

This cafe is located in Bhawanipore near the famous Raj Banquet Hall. This is a new cafe so I wanted to tick it off my list.
I went with a group of friends. We had:
1. Pan mojito - never tried pan flavoured mojito before. This was a unique one and it turned out to be great.
2. Cold coffee - the usual cold coffee was served in a beautiful way in a long hour glass. 
3. Brownie shake- I love brownie shakes and I had to order this. This is a thick chocolatey shake and I had one all by myself.
4. Fish finger- 6-8 pieces of fish fingers with mayo dip served in an unique way on a chariot like thing.
5. Chicken drumsticks- they have 4 leg pieces in each dish. The drumsticks were crisp and juicy and the sauce made it taste heavenly.
6. Chicken mayo sandwich - chicken and mayonnaise filled sandwiches with French fries and served with ketchup dip on three decks is a really good way to present a dish 
7. Chicken Alfredo pasta- a wholesome chicken pasta with Alfredo sauce garnished with basil leaves. It's creamy and good to taste.
8. Aussie chicken Pizza- a good portion of pizza preferably family sized with thin crust and a ketchup dip is really great to taste.
9. Hot brownie with wafer , ice cream and hot chocolate- my favourite dessert, brownie and ice cream with hot chocolate is beyond any criticism.
This place is a newly opened cafe and has quite a big space to sit. Good ambience and a nice place to hang out with friends. The food is good, quality and quantity of it is also commendable. The service is good. The price is pretty reasonable. This place is expected to grow better in the coming days.

Puja is round the corner n I'm sure you don't wanna mess with your tastebuds while standing in a long queue for hours!
Here's why you should drop by this cafe.
It's a newly opened cafe so easy for you to book seats plus the location won't be a problem for you.
Walk straight taking the opposite lane of Poorna cinema hall, Bhawanipur and you'll reach there soon.
Well coming to the food I would say its decent.
Paan mojito is the best among all the drinks.
 It has the flavour of paan and mint which is refreshing.
Chicken mayo sandwiches are super tasty. Stuffed with ample amount of chicken and well dressed with mayonnaise the sandwiches tasted heavenly!
Aussie chicken pizza could have tasted better though!
My personal favourite is Chicken Alfredo pasta. Neatly cooked I must say.üëç
One can also try out their roasted fish in lemon butter. Basa fish fillet evenly roasted and served with mashed potatoes and herbed rice. Loved it.üëå
Last but not the least, is the hot brownie with ice cream.
The hot chocolate on it made it more YUM.
Woof! It was bliss!

Visited this place with a group of friends tonight . Had a good experience at this recently opened cafe cum restaurant .

Location : Not very tough to locate . Situated at Ramesh Mitra Road opposite Ladies Park adjacent to Raj Banquets .

Ambience : Pretty much OK . Nothing fancy . Dim lighting as all cafes tend to have . Interiors are just the regular types . Comfortable seating arrangements for a huge group of people though . Thumbs up for that :)

Coming to the food , we started off with the mocktails first .

‚óº Virgin Mojito - This can never go wrong . Ever refreshing and tasted perfect .

‚óº Cold Coffee - Decent . The regular cold Coffee you get at CCD and other places .

‚óº Brownie Shake - This was very good . Thick , Tasty , Creamy , Chocolaty . It ticked all the boxes .

‚óº Paan Mojito - This was new . And was the showstopper . Loved this particular drink . The flavours of paan in the drink will be loved for sure .

Coming to the rescue for us hungry bunch were :

‚óº Fish Fingers - Very nice . Soft and tasty . Exactly the way it should be . Served with tartar sauce .

‚óº Chicken Drumsticks - This was a Chinese preparation. Huge chicken pieces were prepared in the right amount of spices was a delight .

‚óº Aussie Chicken Pizza - Thin Crust Pizza . Well prepared with chicken chunks and sundried tomatoes . Liked it .

‚óº Chicken Mayo Sandwich - Sandwiches are my favourite . They satiate my hunger more than anything . And when you get a beautiful tasty blend of Mayo and Chicken , you are bound to love it . The presentation was bang on too .

‚óº Roasted Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce - Marinated fish followed by roasting was served . It was a huge Basa Fish Fillet with the lemon butter sauce . Served with Herb Rice and Mashed Potatoes . Instant favourite ‚ù§

Service : A little slow , but I hope soon they'll improve in this area .

Recommended :)
