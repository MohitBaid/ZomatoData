Apparently the shop looks shabby, but if you believe in the principle of not to judge a book by its cover, walk in for some delicious bites at "Rayaz".
And if you are a beef lover, then this place is sure to impress you with the royal dishes of beef served here. The ambience and interiors are out and out average(and a bit shabby) but food is really delicious and priced reasonably. A good place to have lunch or dinner.
And even if you are looking for some quick bites, you can treat your taste buds with some amazing beef rolls and kebabs.
A place worth giving a try.
