The food was good and the ambience was nice but the service was a bit slow. The pocket pinch isn't much. Over all a decent place to go with your family and friends.

One of the best joint to dig in for the best Punjabi food in Byepass near science city. Though all types of cuisines are available in this place but they make the best Punjabi cuisines. The quantity served by them is enough for 3 people. The average cost for two will be near about ₹700 . The food service was really very quick and the staffs were well behaved and well mannered. We ordered a lot of food there starting from butter naan to Biriyani. The butter naan is really soft and not that tough or hard as compared to some other restaurants.  The Biriyani has a very soft still strong mughlai essence, the mutton was very soft and was easy to eat. The side dishes were equally good. The dessert we ordered was chocolate mousse where everything starting from the chocolate cup to the spoon was made of chocolate. The food was really good and tasty. Chinese cuisine is also available here.

Ambience is truly impressive & good to get photographed with classy backgroud. But their food ? Okay, not a big thumbs up from me. Below average quality.

Hits :
🔸Starters are amazing
I had the most amazing Dragon chicken here, it was better than even some good Chinese restaurants and tangri kebab was finger licking good. It was accompanied by pickled onions and green chutney. Most starters I have had here earlier were good. Priced decently and good portion size.
🔸Huge seating area and good ambiance
It's suitable for get together. Couples would prefer a quiter place. Reach by 7:30 to secure a good seat. It's overcrowded by 8:30.
🔸Diverse menu and decent service till 8 PM. It gets a little botchy afterwards. Breads are considerably priced. Try their BP cheese naan.

Miss :
🔸Desserts
Don't try them. The portion size, price point even choice of desserts is bad.
🔸Main course was okayish.
I actually didn't find any mattar in my Mattar mutton keema. The chicken kaasa had cashew nut gravy with tasty like butter masala. It wasn't chicken kassa for sure.
🔸No finger bowl.
🔸Music was horrible. Somehow they thought a wedding song would fit a fine dining restaurant. It was actually funny.

Loved the ambience and the speed of service. The kitchen is equally good with Indian and Chinese dishes. Highly recommend the Pan fried chilli fish. Heard a lot about their kebabs but the Murgh Sholay kebab was kind of disappointing. But the best thing was the aloo in their biryani, (which i guess they pre-sweeten in something) it was heavenly! Overall, loved it!

Last night we visit there for one of my brother's birthday, the decor was outstanding located just after Bartaman bhavan, before Chingrighata fly over, having a big parking space.
Comming on food we took mutton Biriyanni, mutton sekh kabab and tandori chicken, Trooty Fruity and Gulab Jamun. It is a bit costly resturant comparing with others but all of the item are mind blowing specially the Kababs. The size of the mutton was a bit poor, except this we had an outstanding dinner.

I went on a Sunday afternoon to this place. The restaurant was packed. I ordered Tangdi Chicken, Kashmiri Pulao, chinese fish, Chicken Chap, Biryani and Garlic Naan. All the dishes tasted fantastic but the Biryani didn't match my expectations. The biryani was blunt and something was missing. The staff who were taking the orders didn't pay attention to our calls. Overally, a great place to eat in the Byepass road.

Visited Bypass dhaba on 31st night and as one can expect its a new year eve there is huge que for table. They have a huge parking lot which makes space for lot of cars. We tried tandoori chicken which had a nice smoky flavour. Biriyani, Kulcha and Mutton chap in main course. Biriyani was bit spicy but mutton chap had nice mughlai flavour. We also tried tuttie fruity in desert which we thought bit over priced but the desert was awesome and worth of price, mixed with different exotic fruits with ice cream. 
Overall food was nice..

Been there on new year eve 2k17. Loved the place. 

The location is probably the best. Situated at Metropolitan. Looks more like an upgraded dhaba. The interior is decorated in such a couthy manner.

We definitely had to wait to get a table because the dhaba was overcrowded. But that was okayish.

We ordered Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Mutton Biriyani , Butter nan , Butter Tandoori Roti , Paneer Butter Masala , Chilli Chicken, Chocolate Mousse Cake. Was awestruck by the price. If there is any term better than "very much reasonable" then I would had used that term to describe the price. 

Each and every item tasted pretty good. 
One of the best places to hit , won't bother your pocket much , but definitely satisfy your taste buds.
The behaviour of the staffs was also okayish.

Came here on Christmas Eve for family supper.
Decor is good and there was a lot of Christmas decorations. Food is good, quality and quantity both. Price is not too high. But fish items were highly priced as compared other similar kind restaurants.
Though it was ok.
But staff were real slow. They took a lot of tym to take order and they made mistake in that too. Though there was not much crowd at all.
In order to get rid of complain from customers, they were pushing responsibility upon each other which seemed quite unusual for a restro like it.

Anyways overall an okayish experience.

This has even broken my trust on Zomato that what you show us and what we get. This is really sad. Don't think I'll recommend this or Zomato

Location and ambience wise probably this is the best restaurant. But food wise I'm little disappointed. We  ordered lots of items, some of them were so good while some were pretty average like mutton rara. I didn't find any flavor in the gravy. Chiken Malai kabab was average, but chiken hariali kebab and chiken lababdar was awesome. But I got stuck when I tasted the biriyani, because there was no wow factor in it. So overall this food place is ok for me.

While passing beside this dhaba, always I wanted to visit here, but I'm unable to give more than 2.5 rating.

Yesterday we went there for our dinner party. First we ordered tandoori murg and fresh lime, the taste was okay type.

In the main course we had 6 types of naan, the plain naan was not good at all. Even the cheese nun was equally tasteless. Next we ordered Fish lababdar, Murga da Bharta and Mutton keema matar.
In Mutton keema matar, there was only matar, mutton was just in name only, the Murg bharta was okay types and lababdar fish was not tasted good at all.
Lastly we ordered Special mutton biryani, that was not that much up to the level.

In desert we ordered Firni, brownie with ice cream and hot gulab jamun with icecream, the firni was totally tasteless and rest two are okay types. 
Overall food was below average.
Only look, feel and staff courtesy were good.
It was really disappoint me. May be next time we will have better experience here.

Now coming to the point we orderd tandoori murg..and fresh lime and in the main course 6 types of nun.the plain nun was not good at all.even the cheese nun was not good with respect to the price.next come to the MATAR MUTTON where we hardly found mutton as such only  MATAR were there.next chicken bharta which was ok types and lababdar fish was not tasted good .all the dishes tasted almost same..Even special mutton biriyani was not that much up to the level.Along with these we ordered 3 types of deserts (Firni..browni with ice cream..hot gulab jamun with icecream) where firni was not good at all.overall food was below average.look and feel..staff courtesy all were ok.and somehow i felt service was slow but that was ok for us.I really hope we will have a better experience  in our next visit 🙂

Ok! First of all the position of this place is really nice. Parking area is spacious. 
After that coming to the food. We ordered 3 kind of kebabs- sholay kabab, chicken reshmi kabab and malai murg kabab. Sholay kabab was one among their special dishes! The corn nibbles used were chewy. The kababs tasted good anyways. Reshmi kabab wasn't up to the mark. Flavours lacked balance and the chicken pieces were a lil chewy. Murgh malai was really tasty. From the Chinese course, we took chicken noodles and general tso's chicken. Both were simple and delicious. From among the mughlai, we took double mutton biriyani. Flavour was nice and comforting .
After that coming to the hospitality. The waiters and staff were generous and courteous.
Overall it was a nice experience. Folks can give a visit once !

It was the occasion of Birthday of a very dear friend.. She told us about this restaurant on EM Bypass.. I had never heard of this before and was excited indeed to try something new.. i accompanied my other friends for lunch to this place and the initial impression was of the very feasible location.. Right on the highway with a big parking lot.. The area is quite big with a handsome sitting capacity.. Stepping inside what we noticed was the ambience and yes it was quite amazing.. the staff were quite welcoming with polite behaviour and good service.. coming to the food we ordered two starters by the name Punjabi Tikkhi Machhi, made of good quality kolkata bhetki and chicken tangri kabab.. both comprises of 8 pieces served with tossed onions and pudina chutney.. the dishes were very tasty and a must try.. pieces were soft and melted in the mouth.. specially the fish kabab.. in the main course we ordered for mutton biryani, murgh handi lababdar and butter nuns.. Murgh handi lababdar is their special dish.. its mildly spicy in a red creamy gravy and mouth watering.. the biriyani was good.. the mutton piece and aloo size were the positives but it lacked the proper essence a bit and the butter nun was little thin compared to other places.. the prices were reasonable and overall its a very good place for a family gathering or stooping by for dinner n lunch while travelling..

Outstanding ambience. Great food. Good parking space. Hara bara kebab, tandoori roti, veg jhalfrezi, green peas pulao, chicken dum biryani, lahori murg. The spiciness was on the higher side, but I love spicy food, that's why, I would give full marks to the chef. Not giving 5 stars only because the service should be a bit more prompt. Anyway, a must visit place for those who love spicy, north Indian (veg or non veg) food!

The service is really really slow. It took 10 mins for the waiter to arrive at the table and take the order. Also we had to ask the waiter to give us the menu after 5 mins of waiting. It took more than half an hour for the order to come to the table. 
Was a really bad experience.

Situated in bypass , this dhaba definitely relishes the monopoly market in the bypass side . Always overtly crowded , but the food is terrible . Ordered biryani which tasted really bad . The chicken chaap not only had oil floating all over it but was also stale .

After a long tiring journey of 8 hours we reached Howrah . We booked Ola for 4 hours and asked our driver to help us to discover the city. After visiting some places, we felt hungry and asked him to take us to a nice place. This place is located at the main road and the order was served really fast to us. Staffs were good and so was the food. Bit less spicy but nicely cooked food you will get here .

It's location, though far from my residence, is easily visible and has lots of parking space.. I have tried the Nans, the kababs, and the Biriyani. The Dal Makhani is delicious.. I would love to visit this place again..

From the time bypass dhaba started, they have improved a lot considering the taste of food and quality. But still their management and service is poor. If you are a late night person, bypass dhaba can be your saviour. Parking space is quite huge.

Had dinner with family and enjoyed the food a lot. But was a little disappointment as the waiters looked very confused and slow. And cutlery was funny. Spoons were heavy for small bowl of dips used during eating kebab. For every dish spoon size are same. Please see, if you can make it classy. Food is excellent

Dropped in for a late night Hogging spree. The ambience is okayish, brightly lit with comfy seating arrangements. Staff are polite too, and service fast.
We ordered chicken tikka kebabs, chicken lasooni kebabs, kadhai paneer, murgh lababdar,and butter garlic naan. Tasted pretty good! Tutti-frutti ended the meal on a sweet note, and was a delight to the senses.

Located at a very happening area of the city and very distinctively visible while driving past, this place draws a good amount of crowd and being me, I had to be one of them. It was somewhat a better than average experience, but noting extraordinary. The food was good. I liked the malai kebab the best. The stuffed kulcha was pretty good, but the lahori murg was disheartening as the result of the chicken being too tough probably because of being the freezer before going into the fire. Anyway, overall satisfying. Although I should not judge a Dhaba on the basis of how they make their salty fresh lime sodas, but this was something like I never tasted before, like gulping down some sea water. The amount of salt made us squirm and we couldn't have any of it after a few sips. A not so pleasant end apparently

Had such a bitter experience today that i dont feel like rating this place....may be i would have if they could be rated in the negative. We were denied table at 8.45 in the evening bcos 5 out of my 17 guests had still not arrived.....12 of us were standing right in front of their eyes....my sister in law carrying her 1 yr old kid....our presence and requests were ignored with such rudeness that we actually lost our appetite. Over the years we have been to some restaurant or the other almost every weekend but i hv never witnessed such rudeness and highhandedness in any other place. There were atleast 4 empty tables visible clearly from outside....2 of them were large ones....there was not a single waiting...no body was in the que....then what s the cause of not letting us in was just beyond me. Such things happen during the pujas or other occassions when there is a lot of rush. But then also the restaurant people are never so rude in there ways. What on earth is the matter with this place. We assured that the remaining 5 would be there within the next 10 mins at the most but they said that all of us would have to be present for them to let us in. Besides, these people are extremely ill-mannered....they dont know how to talk politely...they are unfit to be in the hospitality industry. Another hillarious thing....they have written on their door that outside cakes are not allowed....but on enquiring they asked for 100 bucks whereby they will allow our cake to go in. This is so cheap. The whole thing was intolerable. We moved off to Arsalan...Ruby which was definitely much much more decent and welcoming inspite of being much much more crowded. Waiting for sometime does not really matter...especially to us ...the inhabitants of Kolkata...
but behaviour definitely matters. Remember we r buying food and ambience from u...u r not doing charity.

You will get well behaviour from stuffs.
Nice food. You will get Chinese and few bengali fish items too. But few items are  bit over priced compare to same quality food. Quantity of food is bit less compare to the price.
Pocket pinch: minimum ₹1100 for two.

The resturant is situated on the EM Byepass (near Science City) and offers quality food. The family resturant though  called a "dhaba" not only serves North Indian delicacies but also some awesome Chinese food. The interior has a nice decor and is also very spacious with a nice car parking area. It is ideal for family or friends' get -togethers. We were eleven of us and still did not face any problem in getting a table as soon as we reached. 
We ordered some tasty Chicken Reshmi Kebab,   Singing Chicken (basically a  Chinese sizzler) , Chicken Malai Kebab and Chicken Hariyali kebab. All of the starters were just heavenly. I simply loved them all. Especially (being a kebab lover),  Chicken Malai Kebab is something to die for. 
For the Main course we ordered Biryani, Chicken Tikka Masala,  Murg Lababdar, Rarah Mutton and Lahori Murg. In selection of breads,  we had  Cheese Garlic Naan and Butter Naan which were pretty awesome. The mutton in gravy had the perfect taste and the Chicken gravies were lip smacking. 
For desserts we had brownie with vanilla ice cream and it was just way too perfect. It was love in the purest form. It is a must try for people visiting there. 
It was a fine dining experience and pocket friendly as well. Our bill was of Rs 7000 approx for 11 of us .
The food there can give you serious foodgasm goals. A must visit for all food lovers.

Went in a group of ten. The usual menu wasn't in play, they had a rather short puja menu instead. Couldn't try some of the recommended things because of that.
Crispy chilly mushrooms for starters, it was okayish, i couldn't taste mushroom at all though.Dal makhani was delicious! No extra oil floating on top. Very creamy. Kadai paneer was good.
Masala coke was a complete disaster. Watered down. Wasn't even chilled. Bland.
Soda lime was really good.
Brownie was amazing, kulfi was okayish, came half melted.
The puja menu had very few veg mains, mostly paneer dishes.
Service was mixed, they were promt at reception, food was served fast mostly, but not consistently.

This is my 2nd time here. I was looking for a place for lunch with my family and actually I want to avoid such places where alcohol serverd so I choose Byepass Dhaba. 
1st we ordered Drums of heaven Beijing Style and Chicken Reshmi Kabab with Fresh Lime Soda 
both was quite good but Drums of Heaven and Fresh Lime Soda was delicious.
2nd we orderd Veg Pulao with Mutton Roganjosh and kadai Mutton Pulao was undercooked and u can feel the raw smell of vegetables , Kadai Mutton was good but Roganjosh was not up to the mark.
3rd we orderd Hot brownie with Vanilla ice cream.
First brownie was not hot Second I don't understand whether that was ice cream or they just put cream on ice because I can feel the ice pieces in my mouth.
Just because my dad don't eat brownie so I orderd Mango juice for him but Mango Juice was not taste like a mango juice it feels like it's a Pumpkin juice.
and the last thing is that they don't ask us  whether they should bring the bill or not, they just bring the bill and hand over to me. 
Authority should teach them atleast ask the people's before bringing the bill.

Everytime I passed the road next to this restaurant during pujo I saw a huge crowd in waiting and filled car parking area.  So thought of trying this out. It's a very average family restaurant which gives u quality food. We tried reshmi chicken tikka, chicken biriyani, tandoor Roti, chicken butter masala, fresh lime soda and one choco truffle. Tikka was superb 
Chicken biriyani was good chicken piece was good.  The tandoor roti is the only thing which was not up-to the mark. U can get btr rotis in other places. And the fresh lime soda was not chilled.  I gave it 4 as the overall quality was not effectd due to excessive crowd.

Somebody suggested it to me and it was 1 'o clock. So I thought, what the hell, let's try it. This is by far my worst experience in Kolkata. When we entered, they tried giving us seats near the dustbin. Ugh!! Ordered some chicken dish that I can't even remember. It was so bland that I couldn't eat. Asked them their specialty. Two people pointed to Lahori Murg Masala. Yet another disappointment. The mocktail was bad as well. I'm never going back to that place.

 It was a family nightout and dinner. We ordered both Indian and chinese cuisine. Mutton biriyani , butter naan, paneer butter masala, chillychicken and chicken fried rice. Food tasted good,chicken was soft and tender. Overall a good place to dine , late at night.

We visited the place just after the Puja... The management of waiting queue wasn't great. 
Coming to the dishes... We ordered Chicken Kakori Kebab, Chicken Dum Biryani, Tandoori Aloo Masala, Paneer Tikka, Murgh Methi Masala and Butter Nan. 
1. Chicken Kakori Kebab - The Chicken size was ok but was not cooked well. Tasted like Haryali.. guess they don't have a different masala for Kakori.
2. Chicken Biryani - Taste was not great... never had a feeling that we were having Biryani. Chicken piece was also too small.
3. Tandoori Aloo Masala- Aloo was spoiled. Smelled bad. Gravy was good. Guess they used butter and red gravy. 
4. Paneer Tikka Kabab - Taste was good but size of the Paneer was really small... looked like panned cut for butter masala etc...
5. Murgh Methi Masala was good in taste but quantity wise it could be more for the price they charge.
6. Butter Naan - Thin and small... Rs. 60 per piece is no deal for butter Nan.  

Overall, not a good experience. .. was my first visit. Don't recommend unless u are short of options.

Thanks.

I had been suggested to try this one for a longtime. So went there to have lunch. My experience with Kadhai chicken was sad. It was little sweet and pieces were very hard. The veg food was good. I must compliment the manager who apologised for the bad dish and also took the feedback very positively.

Altogether a good restaurant but not great. The Indian dishes tasted quite average. Houses a lot of staff however service is a bit slow. Based on quality the cost is a bit on higher side. Seating arrangement is good. Cannot give explicit recommendation for any particular item.

Dont know why this dhaba is underratng. Whatevr, my exprience here is up to the mark in all aspects. 1st comes about the ambience,. Its beautiful, well decorated nd its area is very big inside.we have ordered mutton booti kabab which was just beyond our expctatn, realy realy good in taste. Then we hv ordered laccha parota, butter tandoori rooti nd raahra mutton. I wld like to write some words about this dish. Its an spicy prepration of mutton whch contains 4pcs of mutton nd the main feature of this dish is the gravy contains mutton kima. Ovarall a beautiful preprtn of muttn which can fully satisfty your tastebuds. Their 🍉 mojito was also too good.

The place is situated at a very pleasant spot. The ambience of this place is absolutely stunning , it's spacious and can accommodate many, including large groups. It serves both Indian and Chinese so you'll have a lot to pick from. The staff are competent as well and I faced no issues to complain about.
Now coming to Food, it was absolutely delicious, whatever we had was amazing and worth every penny. Each main course and it's side dishes can easily suffice two. The Desserts too were great, especially the Gulab Jamun and their Fried Ice Cream.
What we had :-
1. Indian - a. Murgh Biryani, b. Steamed Rice, c. Jeera Rice, d. Dal Makhani, e. Murgh Lababdar, f. Murgh da Bharta, g. Kadhai Murgh.
2. Chinese - a. Chicken Fried Rice, b. Chicken Korian Rice, c. Lemon Chicken
3. Desserts - a. Chocolate Ice Cream, b. Sizzling Brownie, c. Gulab Jamun, d. BD's Special Fried Ice Cream, e. Tutti Fruti

In conclusion, this place is absolutely worth a visit, for it's Food and Service. Do follow me on Instagram with username @foodieraja for daily food pictures from Kolkata !

Although i see this place on regular basis, I finally managed to visit this place only during the puja days & it was a complete disappointment. The staffs were so busy in getting in more customers that they were hardly interested to attend the people already eating there, infact the manager was coming up after every order to check on whether we are done so that they can empty a table & bring in more people. The billing experience & the people dealing with cash should also adequately train themselves to handle bills in a rush( we have paid the bill in cash & were to get a change of 1005/- bucks but to our utter dismay they returned only a change of 5 bucks & the rest of the change only came back after we reminded them about it).The service is also slack, the staffs who are serving are recklessly spilling the stuff & they are too laidback to even give a menu card.  Coming to the food, we had ordered for the tandoori chicken, chicken hyderabadi biriyani, butter garlic naan & mutton roganjosh. The mutton roganjosh was half cooked & the mutton was too hard. the rest of the items were just ok ok kinds. All in all a miserable experience.

Dhaba food is supposed to be all north indian but this fancy dhaba serves chinese as well, but the north indian food is the winner. Although the chinese isn't bad.

Their kebabs are amazing. The meat is tender, their flavours and spices are correct. Their mutton rogan josh is absolutely brilliant. Their biriyani is good. But their kebabs will steal your heart. 

PS : Their service is really good.

As it says better late than never,uploading review after 5 days as visited this place on Panchami during puja.Rushes to every restaurant around South Kolkata made us visit the place though came across many a times while passing by Byepass.
Modern form of dhaba with huge space,air-conditioned and nice interior.It's appealing.
Went with 8 family members and ordered diverse variety.
To start with Chicken reshmi kebab and tangdi kebab as non-veg starters and paneer tikka for the vegetarians.
Chicken reshmi kebab was too good and melted in mouth being the chicken pieces were succulent enough and large as well.Tangdi kebab was no less and a spicier one.
Coming to main course,order was chicken dum biryani,chicken butter masala,veg fried rice and schezwan fish beckti,masala kulcha,butter naan,murg tikka lababdar and veggie members ordered tandoori butter aloo masala and paneer butter masala as side dish though they praised the tandoori one rather than the paneer.
Being a hard core foodie I tried all the non-veg main course and side dishes apart from Masala kulcha,Chicken dum biryani seems very less spicy but had the flavour in it but found the chicken piece small enough.Schezwan fish was also good but doubts whether it was Beckti though it priced 400 bucks.
Masala kulcha was another worth mentioning as tried it earlier at different places.The inner stuffs was appropriate and not too heavy to carry out with taste in it.Murg tikka lababdar was my main side dish and extremely well carried off.
Apart from food,the staff service is the worst part to be mentioned over here.Least prompt not if something worse than that.Seeking for mineral water every time made us wait not less than 10 minutes even after reminding them times.This surely slows down the rating.
Price was appropriate for a group of 8 members.
(No photo as was much hungry around 5.30 having that as lunch).

I have been to this place thrice now and i think its one the best pocket friendly places serving more than OK food. At the money they charge for the dishes and the fact that they are open quite late in the night - this is a must visit place if, you are out with friends late in the night and want to hog on to as much food as possible in a budget.

I would definitely advise against trying chinese dishes they serve- its based on the notion that like you dont go for eating tandoori items at a chinese restaurant similarly you don't visit a tandoori restaurant to eat chinese dishes.

Here is how i will rate the items -

Biryani - 3 /5
Tandoori roti - 2.5/5
Roomali roti - 3/5
Raita - 4/5
Butter chicken - 3.5 /5
Kadai paneer - 4/5
Chicken tikka masala - 4/5
Lassi - 3/5
Tandoori chicken - 4/5

Overall rating - can't complain and would definitely visit again.

Note : place was filled to its brim during the pujas and they managed the crowd very efficiently. Good job.

It was on a dead tired shoptomi night that we went in for a bite at byepass dhaba... The first point that impressed us was that we had to wait for exactly two minutes before we were spared seats... On a busy pujo night this is sumthing to appreciate about at a bustling restaurant. Without further ado, to the food then...
We went for,
Butter naan-- The naans were soft and smooth and lapped up with a generous amount of butter... Perfectly sumptuous.
Murgh Lababdar-- I almost felt an explosion of tangy and spicy flavours in my mouth from the first bite. This dish is most recommended at byepass dhaba...a perfect side to go with the perfect naans.
Handiwala Murgh Methi-- This was a dish which had an out of the box taste and won our hearts... It is loaded with a perfect balance of methi and malai which is lip smacking to the last morsel...
Paneer Butter Masala -- This dish tasted quite well though the centre of the dish, that is the paneer was harder in texture than they should have been.
Chicken biriyani -- Again, very satisfied with the quantity as well as the quality of the biriyani... Both the aroma and taste were light and pleasing and not overpowering at all.
Now if every item was so great, then the question arises why I didn't rate this restaurant a bit higher. Well that simply attributes to the poor quality of the service... Throughout the time we waited till we were served our food, we asked them almost like a hundred times to serve us some water but sadly we failed to get it... It was only when we were irritated to our wits' end that they served us water. Moreover the staff didn't serve us the food and we had to serve it by ourselves which was really cumbersome for so many people sitting across such a long table. The service again was very slow.
The pocket pinch is perfectly reasonable though.
As for the ambience, it is quaint enough for a decent family meal and the restaurant is quite spacious with enough seating arrangements. If they notch up their service, there really is nothing to complain about this gem of a dhaba on byepass☺

Everyday I would see this restaurant on em bypass road and wonder why it was so crowded. This place is open until pretty late at night. So thought would give it a try. Landed here on a friday night after work around 11pm and had the tandoori chicken which really surprised me. It was juicy n real yum. Then had butter chicken n naan and this too was yum. Now i realized why this place is crowded. Good food and good seating arrangement. Definitely a place one can return to for a meal.

Please don't get too carried away by the word 'Dhaba', since it is a multi cuisine restaurant in true sense. I tried Indian & Chinese simultaneously, both were equally well made. To be a bit biased I would give Chinese an extra point for shattering all the inhibitions about the restaurant being only a good North Indian hub. Especially the Crispy Chilli Mushroom, Prawn Fried Rice & Fish Manchurian must be tried. In this world of growing usage of Basa, I was delighted to find Bekti! Dishes were a bit costly, ambience was amazing, & service was decent. A huge parking area gives it an additional advantage in attracting customers.

Finally ticked off bucket list. 
I pass by this place each day and always wanted to visit and finally gave it a shot yesterday for lunch. 
Place is always pretty crowded and finding a seat is tough, had to wait for a while and finally we got a seat, we were a group of 4! 
Ordered Mutton biriyani Nd Murgh Lahori masala, later ordered chicken noodles and chicken fried rice! 
Ended the meal with chocolate icecream and Phirni. 
Mutton biriyani had huge quantity with a tender mutton piece. 
Murgh Lahori needs special mention, never had a better preparation of chicken. 
Fried rice and noodles were pretty average. Phirni tasted great. 
Loved the food, staffs were courteous and service was prompt. 
Will visit again soon.

For the first time ever, i decided to try Chinese food at an Indian restaurant. Trust me, i was skeptical but thank you for not letting me down. The ambience as always was extremely lively, the lighting perfect inside the restaurant. I decided to order the signature dishes so i started off with "The Singing Chicken". Truly, it lived upto its name as the buzzing sound of the sizzler plate really made the chicken sing. The consistency of the gravy was amazing, the chicken tender and soft. I loved it to the core.Down to the main course, the "Hot Garlic Fish" along with the "General Tso's Chicken" (one of the signature dishes) blended perfectly with the Mixed Rice and Mixed Noodles (Hakka). The food indeed was delicious, the flavour of garlic was perfect and i truly loved the joy it brought to my taste buds. I would surely be there soon to try the indian cuisine. The experience has been awesome.

Have been on my bucket list for quite sometime.
Started off with "Drums of heaven" which was very tasty, and did more than a good job of an appetizer for the two of us who were there.

Next we went on a different track, and got "Chicken Hyderabadi Biryani". Needless to say it was very tasty. Quite different from what I am used to having fun the usual Biryani eateries of the city. The chicken pace in the Biryani especially deserves mention, for begin perfectly cooked, soft and worth every penny.

Lastly we thought of signing off with "Patron's Fav" in dessert. While that was tasty too, and served well - we found bits of paper in the drink. At least 4 - 5 bits of paper (more in the mould of tissue) were found.
We contacted the Waiter regarding this, but unfortunately we were not briefed on this any further, and directly given the bill for the meal. No one from the authorities followed up on my complaint nor offered even one word on the matter, choosing to remain oblivious to the whole occasion.

This last episode really dampened what was turning out to be one 5 star rated lunch, one to remember forever. Alas, it had to end in a sour fashion, and hence the reduced rating.

Situated near science city, this place doesn't disappoint you if you are a food lover. Staffs are very polite, u can choose variety of food from their menu which by the way is excellent. We ordered lemon coriander soup and kebab as starters, for the main course we had tandoori roti, biryani, chicken tikka masala . The food didn't disappoint us at all, it was very tasty, with right amount of spices, for the dessert we had kulfi. There is a good parking space just outside the restaurant. The place gets crowded after 8. Do visit this place. It won't disappoint you, overall it was a good experience.

Went to this place yesterday for dinner. Located near metropolitan junction,EM bypass,this place is getting more popular day by day.
From outside the brightly lit building attracts you. Gorgeous interior and comfortable seating arrangements are big plus points. As we went on a Sunday evening,the place was bustling with people. 
Now coming to the food...
We were six hungry souls,so we ordered-
Tandoori chicken
Cheese naan
Tandoori roti
Chicken dum biriyani
Mutton pasinda
Tandoori chicken butter masala
North East frontier chicken curry

I personally loved the naan,pasinda and chicken butter masala.. both the butter masala and frontier curry were on the sweeter side little bit.. but all the food tasted great. 
The service was good. 
Overall,had a nice experience...

Have been eagerly waiting to visit this place that always catches our eyes while travelling on the Bypass road.  Finally, made it on a not-so-busy weekday evening. 
Location- Eastern Metropolitan Bypass, close to JW Marriott. Accessible by bus, app cabs. 

Ambience- Pretty good! The decor is pleasing and the service is prompt and satisfactory. 

Starters- Chicken Tandoori. It was served hot and delicious with the pudina chutney and pickled onion salad. 

Mains- Chicken Dum Biryani, Mutton Dum Biryani, Masala Kulcha, Cheese Garlic Naan, Murg Tikka Butter Masala, Murg Lababdar. The Biryanis were good, especially the mutton one. Personally, preferred the Murg Lababdar while many vouched for the Tikka butter masala as the better dish. The Cheese Garlic Naan was delicious! 

Dessert- The BD special dessert which was sort of a fried ice cream, came with fruits and was just the right amount after the very filling main course.

Ok....the first advantage is the timing. It's open till 2:30. So after morning anytime when u are hungry just drive in. However, you have to have 1000 bucks for 2 heads. We were there at 2:00 am with the office group. Good food, prompt service and the ambiance was fair.. orerall a good experience.

Looking for some late night inspiration while driving through Byepass.. The brightly lit up entrance and the array of cars parked in front convinced us to try it out since we have also heard rave reviews about the food.. They have ample car parking space which is definitely a positive.. After entering we were impressed with the gorgeous décor and the royal look of this place.. The place is huge with comfortable seating arrangements and is an ideal spot for large groups eyeing a sophisticated yet economical meal.. Service was extremely courteous and sober, unlike any other Dhaba type joints.. Although it is named as a Dhaba, they serve a huge array of Chinese dishes too but my personal experience says the Indian dishes get the upper hand.. We savored the following:
Dragon Chicken: Tangy, sweet, spicy.. The cashew nuts added a crunchiness to the dish while the bell peppers were also tasteful..
Mutton Seekh Kebab: Smoothly minced meat kebab fried to perfection.. The mutton was flavorsome and the kebabs were aptly spiced..
BD Special Fried Rice: A nice assortment of colors and components.. Looked like a carnival to me.. Served with Prawn chips, the entire dish was wrapped in an omlette.. They literally used every possible component in the dish.. The rice was tossed with schezwan sauce which added the punch..
Chicken Dum Biryani: One of the best dishes of the evening.. The meat was soft and tender and the dish tasted delectable.. I am literally drooling now at the very thought of it..
Mutton Dum Biryani: The mutton piece was not as soft and enjoyable as compared to the chicken counterpart..
Mutton Chaap: Unusual taste and recipe for a chaap.. This dish tasted sweeter than the chaaps served in famed Mughlai joints and the mutton pieces were bit too boned to my liking..
Mutton Bhuna Masala: Delicious slow cooked mutton flavored with shahi spices.. The brownish gravy was full of fried onions, creamy and spicy and goes well with the rice.. Pick of the evening..
Butter Nan: Creamy, flaky and tasted just perfect..
Firni: Thick, condensed Indian desert cooked as good as any other place will serve..
Kesar Kulfi with Mango Crush: One of the best kulfis I had till date.. A royal touch from the kesar while the mango jelly imparted an unusually good taste to the dish.. Passionately Recommended..
Overall, it was a gala affair to say the least.. Looking at the menu the prices may look a bit high for a dhaba, but rest assured the quantity in each portion will make up for the price.. Our total cheque was Rs. 2300 (all incl.) for 5 people..
Food: 4/5

Food did not leave any remarkable impression. Quantity was upto the mark. Roti was hard. Chicken was soft. We ordered Chicken Malai Kebab, Tandoori Roti, Palak Paneer and  Chicken Lasooni Handi and Masala Coke. Overall a good experience. Can b a weekend lunch destination for family. 
Ambience : 4. Ample parking space is a @plus. Restroom was clean. 
Service was prompt and helpful. No wifi.

Good food great quality good atmosphere.. 
We had steamed rice chicken curry tandoori roti salad and fresh lime soda (sweet+salt).
All was very good.and the quality is so good at that price range..waohh!! So light foods... Awesome experience.
Talking about bad... I did not like ta service..they took quite long time..but service men and their behave was good. If it took little shorter time then it would be pefect.. 
Mostly value for money.

Situated at the Metropolitan junction of the fast paced E.M.Bypass road, Bypass Dhaba is a very favorite place to Kolkatans as it is always bustling with with crowd. I would summarise my experience as below -

The good -
Ambience - Simple, neat, nothing fancy but no doubt it is good.
Staff behavior - Very courteous.
Food - We ordered Mutton Seekh Kebab for starters, it was truly well prepared. In main course we ordered a Mutton Hyderabadi Biriyani, which was good too. But the main highlight dish for me was the Bypass Dhaba Special Chicken Biriyani. This Biriyani had been a perfect balance of spices and could be considered as an authentic awadhi Biriyani. Since we visited post Independence day, a special tricolor beverage was available. The staff recommended it and it was not a disappointment. The three layers had three distinct tastes, kudos to the bartender.

The bad-
The service was slow, but since the entire place was packed, it can be considered.

Overall-
I would surely be visiting this place again, for the BD special Biriyani and mutton Seekh Kebab. If the service can be hastened, Bypass Dhaba can become truly a 5* dining experience.

LOCATION: It is situated in EM Bypass thus the name. It is quite near to salt lake connector. The front promenade has huge space for parking.
AMBIENCE: The walls are done up in muted tones. The place evokes almost a canteenish feel. Though the glass wall provides a great view of the EM Bypass but the plastic bottles of tomato sauce on the table looks kinda tacky.
SERVICE: The staff does suffer from a lack of coordination. They seemed thoroughly bothered with the huge crowd inside the restaurant premises.
MENU: It doesn't exactly serve dhaba food. It serves everything from Chinese to North West Frontier cuisine. The menu seems never ending but the prices are a little too high for the place.
FOOD: The Khumb e byepass dhaba was just a mush of cheese & mushroom. It didn't have quite a definitive taste & lacked body. The butter nun was good, soft & flaky smothered with dollops of butter. The dal makhanwala was bland & nothing out of the box. The paneer dhania adraki was the only saving grace. It had a quite bitterness of ginger in it which acted as a palate cleanser.

Me and my family went for sunday lunch to Byepass Dhaba. Really nice place beside em bypass road. Recommended for all who wants to taste a slight of dhaba experience. We ordered as usual fresh lime soda with sweet taste which i could term as one of the best in Kolkata. Next on the platter was Tangri Kebab well cooked and smokey flavoured. Next on line was Veg Dum Biriyani, Butter Garlic Naan, along  with Chicken Do Piaza and Butter Chicken Tikka Masala. All dishes were really good , fresh and tasty. Highly recommended. Staff knows customer service and helpful.

The Doorman to the Manager to the Supervisor to the Waiter to the Intern - very courteous indeed. 

The sweet corn vegetable soup was excellent. 

The Yellow Dal Tadka and the Laccha Paranthas cooked to perfection. 

The salad onions utterly fresh. 

This restaurant is a must go. 

To top it all open till 2.30am.

Byepass dhaba located... Well as it suggests albeit with a spelling mistake beside the EM Bypass. And as we make our daily trips to and from the main city we residents of salt lake can't help but notice it's growing popularity with the masses... We have tasted their food and we think it is quite delicious, though the take away service is a little slow. Their dum biryani which we got home yesterday was nice... With the rice and the aloo tasting like heaven but unfortunately we were not happy with the mutton pieces that they gave. They were sinewy and tough and hardly had any lean meat.... So please make sure the mutton pieces that you put in the table and in the takeaway boxes are of the same quality... It is disheartening to see that you would give the pieces that cannot be served at the table in the takeaway boxes.

Bypass dhaba is a standard dhaba style restaurant located on EM Bypass. Have always seen this place crowded while passing by and finally decided to try it out. When we reached there around 3 on a weekend afternoon the place was buzzing with people. We had to wait for 15-20 mins to get seated. As far as cleanliness and interiors are concerned - these are ok and get 3/5. We ordered black dal tadka, veg jhal farezi, kulchas and jeera rice. All were really good and spicy the way we wanted. Absolutely warm food served in 15 mins. Worth the money.

A very good pocket friendly restaurant located in bypass. You can always find crowd at this place. Sometimes maybe you have to wait a bit before getting a table but its really worth it. I tried chicken biriyani, roti, chicken chaap and firni. All of them tasted amazing. The biriyani was a lot in quantity, tasted fantastic and very much recommended. The firni was really good and a must try.

Food was okayish. Tandoori and kebabs are the only good things to have over there otherwise the biryani mutton was half boiled and even the other foods were also average compared to the price. I would only recommend chicken tandoori as the best food available there. Looks of the restaurant was good but the place was crowded with lots of noise. It's an one time visit if you're not a tandoori lover.

Mutton 'FLY' Biryani at Byepass Dhaba, Kolkata :  July 14, 2017 we had quite an experience at the Byepass Dhaba, Kolkata where three of us went for lunch at around 3 pm. This was our first visit to the restaurant after we had a reasonably good feedback about the restaurant from some of our friends and relatives. Among other dishes, which we must admit were well cooked, we had ordered a Special Mutton Biryani to be shared by three of us. However we had to put a brake to our saliva when we located a full size fly in the biryani when one us took her second helping. When we showed it to one of the attendants, they were ready to change the dish. The manager, we were told, was not present at that time to address our complaint. However, we did not want it to be replaced and wanted to call it a day after paying what we had except the biryani, as one of us was feeling pukish at the thought that she had some portion of the biryani already. An officer came and claimed that they will replace the dish but we have to pay for the biryani. We noticed that none of the attendants were empathetic or apologetic for what had happened, rather more interested to settle the deal. When we denied taking replacement/ paying for the biryani,  the chef came from the kitchen and examined the fly on the plate. While he accepted that we pay for the dishes other than the biryani, his casual attitude shocked us. He immediately judged that the biryani was not cooked with the fly as the fly had its full shape. He also claimed that there is very little for them to do as it is very usual and natural. He claimed what we could have done if the fly had dropped while we were eating at the restaurant ; as if it was not their duty to keep it clean. When we questioned his attitude he blatantly told that we also might have brought it with us to con the restaurant. When a war of words followed, a couple having lunch at the same time just adjacent to our table supported us saying that even they had a fly in one of their dishes which was quickly replaced by the attendant. This was enough for the chef to retreat who kept on arguing on his way back to the kitchen. We were issued the bill except the biryani which we paid and left the restaurant. It was the attitude of the restaurant people than the fly that shocked us more. While we do not get to know the level of hygiene maintained in the kitchen of the restaurants, we take food based on trust. However this trust is blown away when some of the r@estaurants refuse to accept their mistakes, rather tr@y their heart out to shirk their responsibility and instead accuse the customers of wrong doing as their defence. This is a learning for us Kolkatans who throng restaurants every week. And for any of you planning for a meal at the Byepass Dhaba, god save u. Be ready for a sumptuous 'FLY' biryani.

It also has a proper open air parking place near the restaurant only which can be viewed while you are having your food inside. The food was good but it took a long time and the service was avg I'd say. Not too pocket friendly I would say though :P

This was in my bucket lisg for quite a long time. And suddenly one day when most of the restaurant in kolkata were close @ 1am I remember this one. It is near science city wid awesome ambience. The food was great and the service was good too. We ordered tandoor butter naan and one chicken reshmi butter masala. Both the dishes were mouth watering. Will visit this place soon :)

Awesome and Affordable place. I simply liked the menu and the preparation. I have been to this place twice both late night and ordered fish finger , chicken butter masala , naan and raita etc. I Loved every dish at this place. We were 3 people and cost came around Rs. 2000.

I would recommend this place for good food .

*This place was good, but not anymore.*
Service and food quality has been degraded with time.
-No one cared to attend us after we took the table. Water was served 20 minutes later when we  requested the waiter twice.
-These people have started to serve cold(room temperature) food(Naan) and then try to fool you by arguing that it has become cold because of central air conditioning.
-They did change the Naan later, but after spoiling our mood.
----Lemon Soda----
-Had complained about the quality of lemon soda two months ago.
-Noticed the group of 14 sitting on the table near us, returning lemon soda twice. All 14 of them.
-Clearly they don't care to act on complaints.
-We did not order lemon soda. Obviously.

An excellent place  for a perfect family dinner.The typical dhaba type feeling aroused  by the interior atmosphere.The service provided was average since they didn't even care ti give water after the glass was empty.Now coming to food it is very good especially the masala kulcha.Tastes so soft and inside fillings were just great.We orderd chicken bharta which was very mouthwatering one.The only improvement they need is for Biriyani which is too dry to have it.Though dhaba's are not appropriate for biriyani lovers.Talking about the desert it was good.Overall experience was good.

The location is very convenient. Was here twice. Once when we were returning from a road trip and hunting for dhabas on the road (hence, location). Apart from that, the food is good. The service could be a bit better; they were a tad lazy from my experience. Recommended for a casual dining out experience.

Went there with my family and friends for a dinner. The restaurant is located near Metropolitan on E.M Bypass. I was very excited for this place as I really wanted to try their dishes for a long time. We arrived there near around 9 PM and there was a long queue of 9-10 people. After 15-20 minutes they provided us our table. This is a huge place with all glass decoration.

Overall food was good. Could have been more better based on price. Expectations were high, however only 3 has been satisfied out of 5. Will try something different next time. Let's hope for the best for next time.

We ordered Veg platter, some were good but rest i found them less cooked, chicken was good.

Happy food hunting,, happy tummy.... :)

I dont know about their food quality as i did not get the chance to have it ,i am writing this review only on account of their hospitality which is worst.  Three of us went there on the occasion of Eid at around 1 : 10.
We sat on the window side as suggested but after 2mins we decided to change the place due to some personal problem. As and when the guy was called he refused to let us sit anywhere else but the restaurant was almost empty. Then we ordered  2 fresh lime soda and asked him to divide it and make it 3. While the other restaurants offer this choice of dividing it they dont , so once again we were refused. Then coming to food ordering we were ording tandoori items but he said even that was unavailable. So overall a very bad experience we had to face and had no other option but walk out.

Not so happy with the hygiene and service.regular Water had particles floating. Plates were untidy. They do not allow outside water. So please order mineral water only. Coming to order - dahi ke kebab was excessively spicy however the sweet dip saved the diah. Chicken reshmi tikka, naan and butter chicken was good. Daal makhni was below average and so was kulfi. 2.5 is for food.

Went here last night for my birthday treat...The place was jam packed.

I ordered Subz miloni kurkure and drums of heaven for starters, super yummy, I am a vegetarian so I just ate subz miloni kurkure but as per my friends drums of heaven was pretty good too.

Coming to main course, I ate american choupsey, the gravy was extremely sweet though good in taste, a little less sweetness would have been perfect.

Now coming to the best thing I had, it was Kumbh hara dhaniya pyaz wala, which was a spicy mushroom dish with coriander and spring onion, it was the best mushroom dish I ever had, delicious, though I was full I ate every bite of it, it was sooo good.

We ordered for fresh lime soda, even it was too sweet, but when we asked them to rectify it, they took all the 5 glasses and redone it and sent it back.

Food was good, even affordable too, we were six people, and we ate so much, and the bill came around 2380, which was fair enough.

Now coming to the part where they lost 1.5 rating for me, when we asked to take away the plates after starters, one of the waiter spoke so rudely to my sister to pass the plate to him, I understand the place was jam packed and he has to serve a lot of people, but Mr. this is not the way to talk.

Secondly, the same waiter kept on serving wrong dishes to us, first he served us chicken bharta which we didn't even order, then second he served a paneer dish to me and said it was "kumbh hara dhaniya pyaz wala" and went away. I looked at it, and wondered this doesn't look like mushroom, and called him back that this is paneer, he took it away, and then my dish was served 15 mins later.

The waiter was a big turn off. And I think they tend to make things a little too sweet.

Apart from that food was extremely good and affordable.

High price. Low food quality and tasteless food. Disgusting management forces you to buy containers from them even when you don't require it or have your own. They charge a lot for nothing.

Perhaps the best dhaba food I had in long time. It was recommended by one of my friends to try out their awesome delicacies. It is located on EM Byepass road after Bartaman Bhavan(after science city) at Metropolitan area. 

It has ample space for parking at outside and there are long queues of people waiting on weekdays too. So when we went there on a Monday afternoon it was fully packed but luckily we got seats.

The interior is good and spacious and it can accomodate many people. 
Though the main USP of this place is the FOOD itself and that's the thing delighted me.

Quality and quantity of the food was soo good and it tasted soo awesome.

We ordered Butter nun and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. The Butter nun were good and soft. The dish that stole my heart is Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala--it was full of butter and the big chunks of chicken just melted in my mouth and the taste was perfect. It was too good. We have also ordered for masala cold drinks which were also okay.

Service was quick. Staffs were courteous but still they need a bit of training(may be there were soo many people they themselves were a bit confused). Had to call a lot of times for water.

Otherwise all in all an awesome place and I am sure to drop in there anytime soon. Highly recommended for all foodies.

Bypass Dhaba is located in E M Bypass,it opens till midnight. Ambience is pleasant.
They have different cuisines from North Indian to Oriental.In starter we have tried Murgh Da Bharta with Butter Nan,Bharta is enjoyable,taste is as usual the taste of contemporary chicken bhartas. Tandoori Murgh is delicious,you can try their Murgh Malai kebab,it's soft,juicy and excellent in taste.One can try Mutton Do Pyaza with rumali roti in main course.Mutton was properly cooked and amazingly tasty.We ordered Mutton Dum Biriyani,must say they have to improve a lot in their Biriyanis,it needs to be little juicy too.You can enjoy it but will not get the typical biriyani flavour of Kolkata. Expecting from them to improve their quality a bit and will love to visit again.

Another great place for night owls like us,jokes apart it's a very popular place among midnight foodies.wanted to go there from a long time,finally got the chance last week.it was almost 12am,but no can tell from the rush,the place was really crowded,it has a big parking place,the place is well decorated with many lights and all..quite a fancy place..
Now coming to the food-we ordered           
chicken tandoori-big,juicy,soft chunks of chicken,with masala salad and a lot of green chutney..good.
Masala khulcha it was really good and paneer khulcha was good,not great.
The winner,the star of the night was-tandoori chicken butter masala-it was music to my tongue,hihi,nice pieces of tandoori chicken,in a silky,butter gravy,perfect balance of taste.loved it.p pocket pinch was near rs.750.
I wanted to give 4.5 for the chicken gravy only,but deducted the .5 for the service..the service very slow and improper.every time we had to ask them to give us water,and wait for it...the food comes very late to the table,many customers had the same problem..we had to wait for 30mins for our paneer khulcha,i started eating the gravy alone,hope they will improve there service to match up with the food..

Food was fine but ill trained staff, lack of proper service. Waiters banging things on the table. No provision of finger bowls, that too at an Indian restaurant. No provision of booking a table in advance. Lastly, for a large group, say of 10 people, they did not allow the people who reached earlier, to enter, saying they would allow the whole group together. Shocking behaviour for the service industry.

It was in my hitlist since a long tym. Atlast visited the place. This restro is so popular that it's hard to get a seat in weekends easily. We had to wait for some time outside.
The location of the restro is apt for the tourists and visitors. It's located near chingrighata area.
Ordered nun,reshmi kebab masala,and masapa cold drinks. Food is awsm. Chicken pieces were soft and tasty. Food is enough in quantity and quality. 
Interior was well decorated and specious. 
The service was not so satisfied though..but overall a nyc experience!

We arrived there near around 12am and there was a long queue of 9-10 people. After 15-20 minutes they provided us our table. This is a huge place with all glass decoration. 

We Ordered : Byepass Dhaba Special chicken Biryani(Mutton Biryani was finished),Plain Rice, Chicken Kosha, Mutton Rogan Josh, Murg Lababdar, Mix raita and Kesar Kulfi.

# Biryani was very dry and we had to eat that with the gravy preparation. Pieces of chicken was huge though.
# Mutton Rogan Josh seemed to me as Mutton Curry. Pathetic.
# Chicken Tikka Lababdar was way too sweet. 
# The only good thing we had was that Kesar Kulfi. It   was nicely made and tasted Devine.

Staffs were not that attentive and had to ask them repeatedly for the water and our food. Prices would be justified if they provided good quality food.
Overall an average experience.........

Looks quite like a bypass dhaba style amidst city traffic, located near to science city and Marriot, it's a good enough place for a stop and have a dinner. They have a wide car park, hence no worries for your parking woes unless filled up. Coming to food , ordered special mutton biryani, chicken do pyaza and tandoori roti. Biriyani was nice, chicken was not too bad either. Price pinch - reasonable for the quantity.

Went to this lovely place on a Friday night.
Expecting a wait of around half an hour, I was pleasantly surprised to get a table as soon as we got there.
Service was very fast(considering how busy the place was), food was excellent and reasonably priced. Only negative would be that the AC was not working as well as it should've.
Here's a list of what we had:

Portobello Milagu (4/5)- Good dish. Nothing very special, considering it was their signature dish
But tasty nonetheless.

Let Me Kai (5/5)- Crispy, flavourful chicken stir fry dish. Huge quantity, considering the price point

Waldoorf Salad (4.5/5) - Ideal Waldorf Salad, very light and delicious.

Tandoori Murgh (5/5) - Classic dish. They gave us two big pieces in a half plate.

Chilli Garlic Noodles (4/5) - Good, but why was it not available with egg?

Hakka Chilli Chicken(4.5/5)- Evergreen. Great quantity and quality.

Overall, an amazing experience.
Would definitely recommend this place to all diners looking for good, hearty food cooked with lots of love.

This place has deteriorated to a great extend. Had visited Byepass Dhaba for lunch today. We're lucky to get a table instantly but the place was quite crowded. We had ordered Murg Reshmi kebab and Punjabi Teekhi Machhi for starters. They tasted really good. And the service was quick too. Then for the main course we had ordered Butter nan, Murg Lababdar, Steamed Rice, Daal fry, Mixed Fried Rice and Schzwan Fish Gravy. Firstly, the spoon and fork given to us was not properly cleaned. On complaining about it, they changed the cutlery. Secondly,  the Steamed Rice served on the table was cold. We complained about it and they replaced it with a hot Rice bowl. Then, keeping calm we kept on consuming the food. Then to our utter surprise, we found that instead of serving Fish Schzwan Gravy, they gave a Chicken item. We called up the manager for clarification and they refused to admit that it was chicken and kept on saying that the dish was made of Fish. Even a lay man could understand the difference between Fish and chicken. This is cheating the customers and nothing else. We were charged for fish and fed Chicken.
It's high time you maintain your standards and stop cheating the customers.

Today I went there. I was very pleased with the kind of food and total thing. Being impressed bought Biryani (special) for my parents and brother. But to my utter surprise they gave me one Mutton and one Chicken Biryani (special) instead of my order for two Mutton Biryani (special). Now I tell you not to go there further, so that they can stop this mal practice of cheating customers. If there was any rating in negative I would love to give them.

Last night went to this place for dinner, as this place was in my wish list from long time...😊and whenever going through bypass I would see people eating there through the big mirrors....☺ So always wanted to get that view and obviously taste their food..🤗
As it was Sunday, we planned to reach there a bit early to avoid the queue....but to our surprise it was just 8.30 pm and they told us to wait 45mints..😐😐 Every table was full, and a looooonnng queue was waitung outside...so we enlisted our name,and went to visit the nearby Durgabari temple,just 2mints walking distance from Bypass Dhaba..which was really beautiful by d way..😍
And then around 9.15 - 9.20 pm we got our seat atlast ..😌😌

Their interior seemed to be like a wedding hall to me...lots of lights,bright colors,flowers,nice sitting arrangements...familes,children..couples all are there...everyone is laughing,gossiping,watching the match on tv..enjoying their food..and oviously having a great time indeed..🤗

Ok so now coming to the main part..food..😍
Fr starter we ordered tandoori chicken, tandoori roti and handiwala methi murg as main course..and we asked them to suggest a refreshing mocktail..and as they said we ordered one "special anniversary with mandrin".

Their tandoori chicken was served within 10minutes..☺
Well the chicken pieces were decent, not at all dry,like most of the other restros serve...the meat was juicy,hot and tasted just amazing with the mint-yougurt chutney and salad. 🤗

The mocktail was really refreshing, served in a big thick glass with lots of mints and orange chunks..🍹
Super chilled, tasted great ..👍

Next comes the handiwala murg methi..which is one if their signature dish..cooked with lots of methi,..the gravy was so creamy but light..I just loved it..but the big surprise was the chicken pieces,which I thought would be just boneless chicken cubes cooked in the gravy...but NOOOO...they cooked the chicken with love also..😍 Basically it was maybe malai kawabs..or some juicy,soft decent sized kawabs, which had a light brownish colour outside with it's own flavor and taste...and it just tasted so better with the gravy...😇🤗 Tandoori roti accompanied well with this dish...👌👌

Lastly we ordered gulabjamun with ice cream and butterscotch ice cream as dessert. Butterscotch was as it has to be...but loved the gulabjamun with vanilla one..😍😍 The hot gulabjamun with keshari flavor,had a stuffing of pista and saffron inside..with the melting vanilla ice cream on top....just bliss.😇😇🤗

So I had one wounderful experiance there on my first visit...highly recommend to everyone.👍👍

We finally visited the most talked about Byepass Dhaba wondering what makes it so famous..
The basic reason is its location and timing.. located right on the E M Bypass, it is a restaurant open till quite late at night. Then comes the ambience.. with good music and light the ambience is pretty classy..
And then, finally, the food... We just loved it.. We had ordered a chicken biriyani, aloo paratha nd lahori chicken and chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream for dessert.! The food was nothing less than just awsome.. probably one of the best biriyanis available in the city.. the paratha was mouth melting.. and the lahori chicken with it just made it all too heavenly..!! The dessert was perfect in its taste..!
And the service is also very prompt and quick..
Simply cudnt ask for anything more..
Keep up the good work guys!!👏👏

We ordered Mutton Biryani,Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala and Butter Tandoori Roti.
Biryani and Butter Masala was simply delicious,though I was disappointed with the Tandoori roti. It was dry and not soft at all.
The decor was quite good and the service was quick.

Poor service. U wont get a response after 12. Most of the time all category foods wont be available. Food quality is also not like before. You have to wait long time after your food order.

Was here for a late night meal,we decided to visit this place because it one of the few good places which is open till 3 AM,it is located on the EM Bypass Near Science City.The ambience is that of a modern dhaba,well lit and really neat and clean.Coming to the food we ordered the Tandoori Chicken for starters which was really tasty and crisp,it was a little different from most of the tandoori chickens I have had but really tasty,for the main course we decided to keep it simple and opted for butter naans and handiwala methi murg,the naans were fine quite soft and the handiwala methi murg was also great it had soft pieces of chicken and the gravy was really tasty.All in all great food.

We had been here more than a month back. This is on By-pass, hence easy to locate. 

The food is good, but little overpriced. A bit congested place, maybe because of its location. 

The most amazing part was the lassi glasses. I don't know what it should be called, probably giant glasses. Those were huge. Service was satisfactory, nothing exceptional. Funny part was, when asked for desert, the staff member suggested to take mocktails. I believe, the staff needs a bit more training. 


Overall, the place is good to visit.

Tired day, as usual what we all become after a hectic work. Anyway decided to visit here from Christmas, however, couldn't​ get a seat that day and later on couldn't have time so finally visited.

Thanks to dad for the treat. It's like a 'genie' wish as being a working man you still get a trest, anyway we ordered Fish Do pyaza, mutton Dum biryani, Kashmiri polao, Mutton Roganjosh, and Hot brownie with vanilla ice cream.
Quantity was enough, however on taste it could have been more delicious like soul touching. 

Overall food was good. Could have been more better based on price. Expectations were high, however only 3.5 has been satisfied out of 5. Will try something different next time. Let's hope for the best for next time.

Went there for the first time. I know it's a busy restaurant but they should focus on service as it was really disappointing. Had to call the waiters many times to get their attention. The food was good. Ordered peas polao, garlic naan and murgh da bharta and also virgin mojito and watermelon mojito. Ordered one garlic naan for the second time but instead, they gave two and when we asked about it, they had a blank expression and it looked like that they don't have any idea. 
All in all, not bad.

This place is easy to locate, visible from the main road. The restaurant is spacious enough but feels congested. Staffs and hospitality is ok. Coming to the food, the kebabs did touch my soul. Biryani, nan, chicken were mouth watering. Chicken Hyderabadi biryani wasn't very spicy but the flavours were perfectly balanced. Chicken dum biryani was good too. Lastly we ordered desserts, and I absolutely loved them. Looking forward to visit again soon!

Food is expensive and not upto the mark is what I had felt in my maiden visit to the place. We had gone for a family lunch on a Sunday. We had ordered fish finger, Murg tandoori, Chicken biriyani and methi chicken. Fish finger costed 320 excl of T&D and seemed was like from some roadside stall. Tandoor pieces also were not as we had expected to be. The main course was fine, though the methi chicken pieces were stiff and did not seem like fresh.

BYEPASS DHABA 
 
Food - 4.5/5 
Ambience - 3.5/5
Service - 4/5

Location : The Byepass Dhaba is a restaurant situated in the heart of Salt Lake at the EM Bypass Road, just after crossing the Bartaman Bahavan. It is a favourite spot for the kebab and biryani lovers. 

Atmosphere/ Decor : As you enter the place, your are welcomed by the smell of mouthwatering food, though the decor is not that eye-catching. It is like any other restaurant. You get an ample free vehicle parking space in front of the restaurant. 

Cuisines : This restia offers well- cooked Oriental along with Chinese cuisines. It has variety of veg as well as non-veg dishes. It also has variety of cocktails. 

Dishes : The menu here offers a wide variety of mouth-watering starters. Murg Malai Kebab (in the pic) consists of tender boneless chicken in a yoghurt marinated with cariander, mint and spinach Indian spices and herbs and is roasted in tandoor. This melts in your mouth almost. 
Murg Tikka (in the pic) consists of tender boneless chicken marinated with spicy hung curd and cooked in tandoor. This is exquisite. 
The main course consist of many choices. But surely, try their Hyderabadi Biryani or even the only Chicken or Mutton Biryani or the Dum Biryani. The taste will surely thrill you. It's one of the best in town. Now, if this is followed by a Firni, it completes your dining experience. 

Price/ Quality of Food : All the products here are fresh and all the dishes have warmth of home-made food. The prices are quite affordable here. The Kebabs have 6 pieces in one plate and the cost for all of them range from Rs.200 to Rs.280. The Hyderabadi Biryani here is only Rs.240 and the Chicken Biryani and the Mutton Biryani is Rs. 160 and Rs. 180 respectively. 

Service : The service also accompanies the high quality of food. The waiters here are very much responsive always and the timing to serve food is also not at all slow. 

Recommendations : People here will have great dining experience with food and most exquisite flavours. But the restaurant should also add more choices for beverages.

Had lunch here today with my wife and daughter. Decent enough restaurant with ample parking space. Baby corn starters, aam panna and manchow soup were very good. But bhuna mutton, highly recommended by the waiter taking the order, was disappointing with a bland taste. Furthermore, I had told the waiter that we planned to have tandoori rotis with our mutton and so we wanted a preparation with gravy and he recommended bhuna mutton. When it arrived we found that it was a dry preparation with minimal gravy. 

The waiter did one more goof up by bringing the mutton and tandoori rotis well before we finished our starters and soup. I asked him to take the main course back and bring it 10 minutes later. He brought the same tandoori rotis (cold and hard by then) back after 10 minutes! 

On the whole, a mixed experience.

Located right at the Metropolitan More beside the E.M. Bypass, this restaurant is sure to impress you. The lighting of the restaurant and the amazing view of the rotating wheels on the busiest road will keep you looking for more. Take your loved ones to this amazing place for a delicious meal, especially during the evening or night time. We ordered BD Special Fried Rice and General Tso's Chicken. The fried rice being full of shrimps, chicken, mutton and egg was simply delicious; and the omelette on top made it look so attractive! The side dish too was very tasty since the pan fried chicken was cooked with oyster sauce and dry chilli. The quantity of each of these dishes is pretty much enough for two people. Friends, visit the place once and you will really crave to be there again!

I visited late in the night for some take away on last week. The behaviour of the staff was extremely poor. They were behaving that they were doing us a favour by serving us. Do not have the basic hospitality sense. They were very arrogant. Moreover the food was horrible, the fish was smelling. Had to throw away the entire lot. If someone from the management side of the restaurant reads this, please tech your staff the meaning of behaviour. They are insane even the restaurant in charge of that time as well. I will never suggest anyone to go there. Please feel free to get in touch with me for any further clarification -- 9830615065.

So during my stay in calcutta.
At 1.30 am me and my friend had a sudden craving for food but we were helpless looking around what to gulp in.
Booked a cab for ccd in salt lake ,calcutta.But twist in the story was that we were not aware that even ccd would be open or not.Without further ado we sat and headed towards salt lake.
While passing by we saw this stop byepass dhaba .My cravings began to double up now.
We stopped and entered and it was nice family type restaurant..NEAT AND CLEAN.
We ordered a matar panner ,boneless chicken with tandoor roti and butter naan.
Panner was normal tasting good but boneless chicken was chopped so much that you couldn't differentiate between gravy and chicken.
But it's better to have something than to have nothing.
Thanks to god we got place ..our saviour seriously 💃🏻
Nice good midnight meal it was😍

But no matter what, the food was absolutely excellent.

serve time is good.. service was also...  but end of the day the the quantity disappointed us.. 
and also have to mention that they messed up one of the order -we orderd mutton bhuna but found out that they must have forgot that the pieces were suppose to be shredded...  😑 not junk of meats...  
overall can't give a go for hungry bellies...

Your Chinese delicacy is not as good as ur Punjabi ones. That's ur area of improvement. 

And shockingly I got my tongue colored after having a mocktail. I hope it wasn't any harmful cheap color u used. May refer my pic.. lol

I found this place a bit overhyped. We ordered fish finger, tandoori chicken, chicken and mutton biriyani and handi methi chicken. The fish fingers were too small. The tandoori chicken was too lean. The mutton in the biriyani was stiff. But I really liked the methi chicken. The tables are placed too close to each other thus hampering the privacy. However the glass walls offer a good view.

I don't know why but I feel like I have found One Place where I can take my father proudly and dare him to critic on Indian and Punjabi dishes...... Loved the taste of everything I tasted.....and believe me I did order many a dishes .....

We (my family) ordered lemon coriander soup, cheese malai tikka, some masala papad, pan fried fish, handiwala methi murg with tandoori roti and egg hakka noodles. This was well complemented with sweet line soda and one mock tail based on fresh orange juice I guess..... forgot the name ...... but it was good though.

Location, parking space, entrance, low height set up of the restaurant giving a fantastic front view of kolkata rushing on wheels, courteous and suggestive staff, food quality, freshness, serving size......... you have won it all for me...
And the best part is serving time.......GUYS YOU ARE QUICK.....VERY QUICK...... just like what we expect when we visit a Dhaba on a highway..... will visit again..... with a bigger group.

It is situated at E.M. Bypass, as per the location it is very easy to find.

Ambience is good enough. The name is not matched with the ambiance they are providing. It is very good for a family dinning.

Service is prompt.

We ordered #murg_tambuk #murg_lababdar #raarha_meat #cheese_garlic_naan #kashmiri_pulao #kaju_firni #fried_ice_cream.

We were looking for some great Punjabi culinary, and we met with our dreams. Every dishes are bang on without any doubt. But that "Raarha meet" not on the mark as per my opinion but if you order then you can take once that cheese garlic naan.

Had gone thr to had dinner with my friends. Had kebabs which was good. The dahi kebab was awesome. My friend just loved the chilis cheese naan. It's was really cheesy. The raarha mutton was excellent. Perfectly cooked and and tender.chicken was equally good. 
But few items which was to up to the mark were the chicken biryani. Though the quantity was good but the quanlity was poor. Completely dry. The brownie was equally bad, I guess the brownie was not fresh.
Service was good and quick can't really say about the ambience...😎

Reasonably good food, courteous staff and nice ambience define this place. Located right on the bypass near to the Metropolitan more this place has become quite a rage now a days. We ordered Dahi kebab, portobello migalu, kabuli nun, cheese garlic nun,veg jhalfarezi and malai kofta.
Dahi ke kebab disappointed us as it was made of besan and they just gave us a dip of Dahi.
Portobello migalu is a discovery and we reordered that dish. 
Size of the nun was small but tasty.
Vegetables were well cooked.
Will love to visit again to taste the non veg dishes.

One of the most good restaurants along the highways of Calcutta as visited there with my family ...As we entered the first thing captured was the interior of the restaurant ... Secondly we ordered food like tandoori . Biryani chicken reshmi masala .. mutton keema and chicken Bharta .. the food took nearly 10 to 15 minutes to came .. The food was tasty but I was very disappointed with the biryani as it was not good as expected as all over my experience was good ...They have maintained the place very nicely ...AND I AM WRITING THE REVIEW OVER MY PERSONAL VISIT AND experience to the place😐

Sooo finally I visited this place and I had very high expectations from this place, and it stood up to my expectations very well. It is located near Science City on the EM Bypass. This place looks soo good from the outside and the ambience is also very good. The staffs are very well behaved. The service is also very quick and we got out food within 10mins of ordering. 
Now coming to the food we ordered Murg Lababdar,  Byepass Dhaba Chicken Biryani, Butter Garlic Naan and Pineapple Raita. Murg Lababdar was very good and the taste was very good. Chicken Biryani was good and the quantity was also good. The naans were soft and the pineapple raita was just okay.
Overall a very nice place to have some good food at a very reasonable price. Would surely visit this place again to try the other items in the menu  ! 😀

Convinient restaurant for a late night meal on the eastern by pass.. the others options being the live bars where you can't take your family. Polite staff and a clean place (apart from the mosquitoes in the area.) But honestly didn't find the taste of the food to go all WOW .. I liked the bhoona mutton and a cheese chicken kabab.

What attracts such huge crowd to this place is its location and working hours (yes open till 2am)..

To cater to the never ending queue and to ensure they keep coming back, the management is extremely efficient and the staff-very prompt!

Coming to food, there is nothing extravagant or delightful, but good quality and quantity at a reasonable price. Kebabs and Naan need a special mention.

This is definitely not a fine-dining experience nor a dhaba but make sure you don't 'bypass' this ;-)

Overall, you can try this place for once with your family but you cannot avert the long queue and the constant hustle-bustle.

A decent place to dine at. I liked the ambience,  the decor and the service overall. The food was not extraordinary but it did taste good, flavours were balanced and stuff. We ordered a couple of mocktails - mine was mojito and it wasn't really anything special...just a basic mint mojito that you probably can make at home too. For main course we ordered butter naan, chicken lahori and khumb dhania masala something....The naan was ok, the chicken was fine, the khumb masala was what I liked the most, they made the thing really creamy indeed and the punjabi flavours and aroma was right there. Overall the experience was pretty satisfactory.

This place was in my wishlist from a very long time .The Byepass Dhaba near Science City is surely gives you a red signal while passing that road which will turn green only after enjoying it's food .
People who have cravings for desi khana , north indian cuisine  this is your destination . Comfortable parking space and they don't keep you waiting for a long time when it's crowded.
Talking about the food we had started our dinner with starters crispy chilli baby corn and dahi ke kabab with a hunk curd dip  - Bang on !! Can't point out any mistakes .Followed by sabz lipta dhania ( seasonal choice), paneer tikka makhni - the cashew paste gives a richness to it ,Black dal tadka (must try). The bread/roti's was normal. Garlic nan/masala kulcha are the good ones .
Overall a happy experience since good food makes me happy.😃😃

The restaurant cannot skip your attention while passing through the e m bypass stretch (near ITC Hotel), as the restaurant has a very swanky appearance from the outside and is pretty decent and comfortable from inside as well. Though just a suggestion that guests should avoid sitting next to the the tables laid on the right side of the entrance and next to the gents toilet section which is in the adjoining area, as the constant flow of waiters and guests can spoil the eating experience of the diners. Hence avoid sitting on those tables.

The seats are reasonably comfortable and it can get a little noisy inside as it houses about 180 to 200 guests at a time. There is a constant flow of guests too, so book your table in advance as you might be required to stand outside and if you are here for dinner, then the mosquitoes outside are going to feast on you before you start your feast :).

However, one thing that just takes the cake away is the service. They are very prompt to execute your order, no matter, how much the rush or the different type of cuisine ordered (by the way they serve both Indian and Chinese)

On our first visit, we loved the thai soup, crispy chilli baby corn, fish tikka lababdar, handiwala methi murg and fresh lime soda (sweet). Must visit if you are a food lover as the food is great and its not too heavy on the pocket. So i am sure to visit them again and try Chinese next time round.

Visited today with family. Ambience  is ok.
 Food was good but not that extra ordinary or tasty as expecting while visiting a dhaba unlike other dhaba in city. 
Service is very slow. 
Breads are generally served 20 - 25 minutes after ordered while eating and when asked repeatedly they say that they have enquired inside the kitchen thrice leaving us wondering how much time it takes for a simple masala kulcha to be prepared that they are 'enquiring' about it in kitchen.  Moreover, when asked about fingerbowl, one of the waiters showed us basin. 
Imagine, frequently dining in best restaurants in the city and never had this type of experience - its worst .

This place is centrally located on EM Byepass near Science City with huge parking space, great lighting and average decor. The restaurant is spacious and does not seem like people are bumping into each other or staring at other's food. Staff is courteous and portions served is ok. We had ordered for Dahi Kebab, Largo La Havana, Paneer Tikka Makhani, Raarha Meat and Plain Garlic Naan. Food was delicious but nothing to mention in terms of presentation. Prices are at par with other similar restaurants and they do not charge mandatory 'Service Charge'. The place remains busy on all days and remains open till 2:00 am at night. 

Special mention to the pan shop just outside the Dhaba. This guy makes great Mitha Paans and has also kept a dustbin outside his shop to help keep the city clean. Kudos.

If you’re love to eat North Indian foods specially varieties in kebabs then this joint is the must visit place.now a days there are so many places where you can eat these types of foods,but in my opinion this is much much better.this place located 1/A,Sector B,Metropolitan CHS,near Science City area.from the outside to inside it’s looks fabulous which looks even more better in the night while the whole restaurant illuminated by the lovely lights.lovely ambience along with quite spacious around 60-68 people can seat and eat together.serves varieties of foods like Inidan,Chinese and specially the North Indian foods.i would like to suggest if you’re a great lover of kebabs then you have to try their famous kebabs.another thing which i found quite good,this restaurant serves foods till midnight 2.30 a.m.life saving for those people who works in the office till midnight.apart from the normal dishes you can try their signature dishes too like Reshmi butter masala,Tandoori chicken.i went there with my fellow friends for a dinner session.we had some really good lip-smacking dishes.
                                          ...

This place is located along the EM byepass road.This place does not have the ambience of a Dhaba.It's pretty spacious with an ambience of a nice dining restaurant.Dishes are really awesome.They have a big parking space outside.

Pathetic service. If u bring a birthday cake along with They will charge you Rs 150 so that you can cut the cake. Food is served cold. Staff are not taking responsibility. Too much handover thus food which is served wrong.  Will never visit again.I will not recommend this place  to any one

This place does not have the ambience of a Dhaba. It's pretty spacious with an ambience of a nice dining restaurant. They have a big parking space outside, which is an added advantage. 

We ordered the Chicken Tandoori, Chicken butter masala and tandoori roti. This place has good appetizing food which is flavoursome like a dhaba food,only having a better quality.

A long craving for punjabi food, I ended up at this place. Located exactly beside the byepass, the place is quite nice and comfy. Coming to the food, I along with my friend opted for sunheri tandoori jhinga (Prawns), Lahori chicken along with paneer kulcha, butter garlic naan and pineapple raita. The prawns where my favorite though I faced a slight glitch, the chicken was medium spicy and the raita was quite good.

I have only tried dishes from the indian cuisine cause who would try anything else from a place which calls itself a dhaba? Anyway, the food is amazing. Their kebabs and tikka butter masala rock! And I love the biriyani! Quantity is good. They have a huge aloo in it too. ..thats always a treat for me! The price is also pretty reasonable. The staff is nice. Ambience is cool too. What's not to like?

As the name suggests the place is located on bypass in sector b metropolitan stretch. The interiors are nice for a Dhaba.
I stopped here for a lunch with my colleagues.
We ordered for chilli mushroom as a starter due to unavailability of their signature mushroom dish.
The mushroom was crispy and okay, didn't find chilli in it :/
Then ordered for Jeera rice and kadhai Paneer. The paneer was okay to taste but somehow a lot of flavours were missing.
Overall found the place to have very average food.
The service was nice hence a rating of 3!
Prices are not worth when compared to the food!

Giving it a miss next time!

Went here on a Christmas Eve. This restaurant can be spotted easily every time you try to get into the city from Airport.! The restaurant is well lit and that's what makes it shine among its dark surroundings.! There is always appreciable crowd during the evenings, talking about our food, it was great.! We ordered Butter Naan, with Panneer butter masala and Chicken Tandoori Starters. The Tandoori starters were excellent.! Then we ordered Veg Schezwaan Fried Rice and Chicken Fired Rice.! Both were good.! The negative point is that the restaurant burns a hole in your pocket.! But sometimes you feel it is worth the price.! A Great Restaurant indeed.!

Something that happened today , I can't stop myself to write. 

7:20 pm evening Today , Me , my wife & child entered the place for a light Snack. Place was OK, we ordered .Food was good which severed with little elongated time. At the end when we are about to settle the bills , a staffer asked for a feedback from my wife with a feedback form.

As we are regular fine dine hopper , she generally gives a candid feedback.She marked "Satisfactory" in the Service Option of the Feedback form and handed it over to the staffer. 

Within 2 min , the guy who took our order ( A tall Man in white shirt) rushed to our table. Quite rude in asking my wife ," Why you have rated 'Satisfactory'?" My wife coolly explained the reason - this is due to the long service time of dishes. The guy started defending his position , again with a very aggressive voice . For a moment , I was speechless .  
We were not in a mood to escalate it to the manager. We closed the chapter and moved on. 

Awkward.... Food was good ... But the staffer may ruin this place very soon. More surprisingly a Manager type guy in formal dress (Black suit & tie) was seeing the whole indecent.

Again very Awkward....

It's amazing when you walk into a restaurant- dhaba in this case, during lunch in a working day, the captain who comes to take the order says everything will take minimum 25 minutes. So we left. I am not even getting into the food, atleast the behaviour should be amicable or friendly. Moreover when asked if Tadka is available, he replies....yes kaali daal with anda can be made. Seriously? You call yourself a dhaba in west bengal and there isn't Tadka on the menu. All the best!

So I finally visited this place on the 25th of December for dinner.Being a Sunday as well as Christmas it was super crowded.had to wait fr over an hour to be finally seated.But no complaints the wait was worth it.
Before I talk about the food I should mention about the staffs they were so courteous n ever smiling.that really won our hearts now coming to the food it definitely won our tastebuds.we had fish tikka(4 pcs fr 400.lil pricey), masala kulcha(awesome),butter naan(ok),kaali dal(ok)paneer tikka Masala(awesome) chilli prawn dry(awesome) and kulfi(awesome).
Though the menu was limited (maybe due to 25th)nonetheless the food n the staffs were to the point.hope to be back soon.

The dhaba was moderately filled and had no problem finding a parking space. The interiors were good (but nothing like a dhaba), not yet finished,had to change the table mid lunch due to faulty air conditioning. 
They had both Mughlai and Chinese food on the menu(!). We had reshmi kabab, kashmiri pulao and chicken bharta. The quantity was good for the two of us and were quite tasty.

The mutton rogan josh was suggested & it was a delight with the awesum Butter Naan

Always well lit 

Full of visitors. 

When i visited i understood why its so awesome. 

The food is the main usp here .

I liked the tandoori here very much. 

Fascinating masalas and a grabbing aroma is the main attraction. 

I  know next time when i will ctoss the bypass again this place is going to stop me

Certainly a fresh approach on making food amazing and dishes just to perfect.
Available plenty parking space for time being free of cost.
Nothing much in design or interiors of this one, simple to go with!!!
Located in a new developing heart of the city bypass.
A rather a small one with limited table arrangements. 
Food just too good well cooked and on time.
Tikkas and Chinese dishes are all well and main course dishes smell and taste just great.
Chicken kabab just steal the show for me i mean it was just "wow".
Sizzler,one in particular not exactly a sizzler but prepared somewhat like a sizzler "Singing Chicken" is good and should be tried.!!!
Quite crowded just explains why the food is just awesome!!!!
Well price is just on the bar it is slightly a bit expensive but still anything for that great taste !!!!
Recommended surely with any companions!!!
Do like or comment if the comment was usefull!!!

We went there on a Saturday afternoon. The place was not overly crowded. We ordered chicken malai kebab, chicken reshmi butter masala, and tandoori roti. It took them a really long time and two reminders to get the food for two to our plate. Definitely needs to buck up on service. 
Coming to the food, the chicken kebab was really nice. It not have an overwhelming amount of cheese on it and the chicken was tender and well cooked. Will definitely recommend it. The gravy was okay-ish and no complaints on that either. The rotis could have been better. They were on the verge of being crispy papads. A big no-no on that. 
Overall, the price range is okay compared to the food quality and quantity. But they definitely need to improve their timing.

AAMBIENCE :  
The restaurant is not that well maintained . 
Some of the walls has color scraped out. 
Some wall decors are put together with the help of cello- tapes.
Utensils are good , sitting arrangemrnts are good though . 
The Ladies washroom didn't have tissue, towel or soap. 

FOOD :
We ordered MUTTON PASINDA, METHI CHICKEN ,  TANDOORI ROTI & RAITA for dessert .
The roti was very thin compared to the thickness of a tandoori roti . 
Chicken & Mutton dishes were really very tasty. 
Quantity is also pretty good . 

PRICE :
A bit high priced . 
They are taking good advantage of their location.
Tandoori costs 28/- each but was not worth it . 

SERVICE: 
A bit slow .
We wen there at 3:15 pm .
The place was not crowded much & it took 20minsb to serve the food .
One thing is good that the person who took our order told us that food will be served in 20mins & it was served eexactly in that time only .

Good Ambience, overall great space but food very below average, open at late hours is the only unique thing. Courteous staff, but need to get more trained to handle such a huge F&B space. Value for money very low, overall cost component perfect. Simply elevating tge quality of food and portions quantity could make this place beyond competition in its segment. Bottomline : Food Quality needs miles of improvement. Hope this gets better.

we tried a large no of dishes... Among those... Vestal mojito, Anti colada n knock the door were good from the drinks part... and in food... murgh hariyali, murgh malai, punjabi teekhi machi, chicken biryani, murgh tikka butter masala, dal makhni, butter garlic nan n masala kulcha... are must try from here...

Now the most importantly... yes the pocket pinch was light in the pocket...

We visited this place on Saturday... it was bit crowded.. ambience was quite perfect.. Food was also okayish... But the service was pathetic...

Hospitality is below zero.. Improfessional and mannerless staff.

Everyhing was going good. After the main courese we asked for Firni and Trutty Fruty.

For that we had waited around 15 to 20 minutes. Nobody was there to look after this. Utterly careless Captain. .

When we shouted for that then one captain came to us and replied with annoying that you can cancel the order insted of saying sorry and apologies. ..

Then he directly went to the counter and interact with a gentleman to cancel the order. .
Then The gentleman just looked the order ticket and simply slipped away instead of taking any proper action..

Dont know who was the incharge at that time.
And awfully sorry to say that i called a black shirt boy to know the name of concerned person. . He told me sir, the peson who was standing near the counter is our owner. ..

Dear Owner,
Thank you so much for the way you are running the restaurant is completely inadjective... Never Visit this place...

Coming to the food, i had ordered chicken biriyani, butter nun, chicken bharta and butter paneer. The nonveg items were not as good as the butter paneer. 
Overall you get to eat a lot of stuff,within reasonable price.

Finally we had the chance today to visit Byepass Dhaba. Had a lot of expectations but it was very short lived. The food we ordered was ok. But I personally would suggest not to go for the Chinese which was not tasty at all. The drums of heaven we order was not properly made. The tandoori items was ok.

Dined there last Saturday in a group of 4, without any prior feedback and had a mixed experience. 

It is big, bright and clean. In fact Dhaba is a misnomer as it is more a multi cuisine restaurant that stays open late. A Dhaba serving Chinese ... well !

Ample & supervised parking. Good table management, quick order and service. In food - the Egg Tarka was homestyle, mutton chaap came surrounded in oil, mutton rara was good, the green salad was dry & the rotis were okay. Not having rumali rotis was disappointing. 

The challenge was with Garlic butter king prawns. While the 1st plate was succulent the 2nd that we ordered was dry and had obviously been rustled up in a hurry & quite inedible. On pointing this out to our table attendant, he first brought the Manager who then brought the Chef ! So we had to explain the same issue thrice, deal with some counter argument before the dish was redone and sent - by when we had finished dining and could only take it away packed. 

Learning - why order Chinese (which was also the most expensive item on the menu) at a Dhaba & 2nd the restaurant should empower their staff to deal with Customer complaint at 1st contact - we gained nothing by repeating the same problem thrice and actually eroded some pleasure of dining. 

As a late night option, this addition is welcome. But price wise, not very pocket friendly.

I went for lunch here yesterday i.e sunday still the services n the food was upto the mark... The decor is great n the ambience is good too. Large place with ample of parking spaces.
We had mutton Hyderabadi biriyani which not so spicy n without aalu so it tasted just like Hyderabadi biriyani n had chicken tikka butter masala was also great in taste. Manchow soup was perfect.

When you enter this place it gives you the theme of a fish market without the smell but exactly the same ambience. Tables are so nicely arranged i think its better to be in a political meeting rather than here. Coming to the service, well not worth mentioning. For food we ordered the byepass dhaba special mojito which is the only really nice drink here. For food we had masala kulcha, butter naan, mutton dopyaza , murgh da bharta. Well the naan was burnt out badly which i didnt expect. Chicken bharta was nice but mutton do pyaza lacked the taste. Better to bypass this place and try something else somewhere.

Midway into the week, after a long drive, me and my friends were searching for a decent place to have lunch along the EM Bypass. That's when we came across Byepass Dhaba.

This place doesn't resemble anything close to your clichéd dhaba scene. Rather its a well furnished diner with a seating capacity of around 80 people. The decor doesn't look stupendous during the day but its much better later towards the evening, when the lights are turned on.

Coming to the food, we had Crispy Chilli Babycorn as  a starter. For the main course, we ordered Paneer Butter Masala, Veg Jhaal Farezi and Kadai Paneer along with some Butter Naans. I found the food to be quite satisfying in terms of both quality and quantity.

Service tends to be a tad bit slow but given the number of customers, that can be overlooked. Pricing is also proper. There's plenty of parking space just outside the restaurant, so there's a plus point.

A bad experience.

I called them up yesterday at 9pm to place my order. Over and above, I wanted to know whether I could place my order in advance. I return home late and this place happens to be placed on my route to home.

The order was a plate of Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and 2 Butter Naans.

They informed me that the restaurant would be empty at the hour I would be passing by them and I could easily have my food inside. They also mentioned that they do not accept orders over phone calls. I explained that I would be travelling in a private taxi and the taxi wouldn't wait for me if I had to have my dinner inside. It would be easy for me if I could collect my parcel and scoot away.

After hearing the status they mentioned that I could order my food 10 mins prior to the pick up time. I did so. And that's where they messed up. They said that they cannot process the order. And the behaviour was extremely rude. Certain street side places might have their set of rules but why behave badly?

If they are incapable of processing orders 10 mins prior to the pick up time, they should not have said that at the outset. Extremely rude and unprofessional.

We visited for lunch on the day of Kali Pujo. So they were still continuing the festive menu and not the regular menu. Though we couldn't order a lot of stuff we wanted to but what was available was good enough. We ordered the day's special "Mongolian chicken" ( it's cost was Rs.300 and had around 12 pieces. It was really well cooked and wasn't chewy at all). We also ordered hariyali kebab and it was cooked well too. For main course we ordered butter naan, masala kulcha,  chicken reshmi butter masala and one murg methi handi.  The chicken reshmi butter masala was very delicate and light which was good. But the biggest disappointment was the methi murg. There was no flavour whatsoever and it felt like  that boiled chicken pieces are dunked into a gravy. 
The ambience was good , Very spacious and hardly any chances of waiting outside. Though the waiters initially weren't very proactive the did pick up pace afterwards.
But all said and done we will definitely visit this place again.

Location: 5/5 Right on the mainroad beside silver spring bypass. Parking space is huge which is another plus point.
Ambience 3/5 Though the ambience is good but it definitely does not have the feel of a dhaba. It looks like a fine dining restaurant.
Food: 2/5 They had a fix puja menu even though I went 3 weeks after puja got over. So the options were quite limited. The food was a huge disappointment as it definitely did not taste like a roadside dhaba food. Jai hind and azad hind are much better that way.
Service: 4/5 At 12 in the night, it was jam packed but the service was fast.
Value for money: 2.5/5 as it's quite overpriced for a dhaba and also the taste and quality of the food do not do a justice.

The restaurant is beautifully located right on the main road however has been strategically made which gives ample parking space for few cars. Regarding the cleanliness and upkeep of the restaurant that's all fine however if you're expecting some politeness be prepared for some opposite. Not saying that the everyone is rude however few of them are. Quiet rude. It's about the intonation and the way certain things are said. After waiting for exactly 13 mins without being acknowledged when I asked someone to take my order I got a rude reply In loud voice expressing his frustration (of a long day maybe)' "AASCHI AASCHI" it was extremely rude the way it was said. None of the staves were alert and the restaurant is filled with certain people wearing the steward uniform which gives an outlook that it's quite well manned however they are only for clearance or just to pour water. Actual order takers are less and impolite. In fact these assistants are better.  

And as I was typing this shocked by the behaviour I received the biryani which to my surprise had a piece of ribs and when I say ribs it was actually ribs because there was no meat attached to it and there was half a piece of the breast. On raising the concern there was some mockery by the same order taker. However someone agreed to change the piece. Saving grace was Mr Chanchal who politely checked on the situation and offered his apology. He was polite and respectful. 

And the gentleman named Kiran was the man behind it. So I would request the team to check into his behaviour and demeanour on how to interact with guests and how to work in hospitality industry. There's a reason why it's called hospitality. .

I visited Bypass Dhaba last week only. Its on my way from Office to home.. The crowd and the exterior of restaurant pushed me to the place.  Loved the interior aswell but food for me was average but yes service was really very fast. But for water I had to call up waiter every time which was quite annoying part. and somehow while leaving the place I left my water bottle there for which I went other day to the restaurant to collect as the place is not so far from mine but staff said they thew that away...... I agree that leaving my stuff there was my fault but I would have felt really very good if I would have got a call from the restaurant that I left my stuff there and can come collect it anytime (this is short of possible because waiter take all the detail of customer) . A small gesture is enough for making one feel close or far from you. So If any body from customer wold have called me I would have felt really good that the staffs are really very concerned about their customers.... This is just a suggestion to the team So if something like this happens henceforth management should act little different way from other places to make one time customer to the customer of life time...

Dear Byepass Dhaba Management...
Kindly note this text.. 
We attended in your restaurant with our family on Saturday.. 
Everything was really superb. We are Sooooo happy with the food, ambience..
But so sorry to say that your staff doesn't know how to talk with the guest,  how to behave with the guest. 
Our mistake:::: We asked to change the TV channel,  
Fist the manager came and told very gently that it is not possible. As another guests are watching the sports channel.. 
We were happy with his behavior with smile. 
After ten minutes we called another person, named Swapan. Honestly saying, the way he was behaving with us,  we spoiled our evening. Then again we called the another person named Sujay. He was also very soft with nice hospitality. For the time time being Manager came again and said sorry to us for Mr. Swapan's Royal Hospitality. 
Dear Mr. Swapan.. Please keep it in your mind,  you are in hospitality industry.. So please be polite..

I have been able to visit this restaurant only twice, given the fact it's 10 minutes away from my home, but the sheer crowd every point of the time, just makes it impossible for us to gain entry!! But anyway, just 2 days back, I cam here for a lunch and as usual the crowd was there. It's really good to see when a nearby restaurant is fairing so well within such a short span of time. But I was quite surprised when the waiters gave me the "Special Puja Menu" since Durga Puja was over almost a week ago and yet the menu cards weren't changed. We had ordered for a non veg soup, Hyderabadi Biriyani, 2 butter Naan and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala; along with that we had also ordered for a fresh lime soda and a masala Coke. The bill was around 1000 for two people which seemed a bit pricey for me.
Coming to the food, the taste was great and the service was pretty fast (although we had to ask for water and our drinks a few times!) but the quantity was a bit less compared to the price. The staff were cordial but as they were occupied with other diners, I really can't complain about their delay.
Looking forward to another lunch...sometime soon!

I went there with 3 of my friends, we ordered for Butter naan, Kadhai Chicken and Reshmi murgh masala. All the items tasted great! The gravy was lip-smackingly delicious. Service was a bit slow, but the waiters were cordial.
The bill stood at 1200 (inc. Taxes)

I'm quite a night bird and late night dhabas are my delight.
But the delight ended right there.
The staff is rude and couple that with ignorance.They are unable to inform you about the items on the menu of their very restaurant ,and head out into nowhere without bothering to answer your queries.Amusing?
We were served food first and the plates and spoons followed on request!
We ordered vegetarian Chinese which was average and so seemed overpriced.
Overall a below average experience.I wouldn't go there again.

Guys plz visit this place If u can afford to buy mineral water as the regular water was filthy. The highlight is there is no proper management even. If u speak to anyone out there they just nod there head and walk away. We were served food but without quarter plates and spoon. Do u guys expect us to carry it next time we visit. Certainly 1st and last visit. Very poorly managed.

I will keep it very simple and honest as per the taste and price 

1.) Ambience - Good
2.) Food - Ok
3.) Service - Ok
4.) Price - Expensive 

May be because of Durga Puja the food was not upto the expectation but service and prices are not as per the expectation . This is not I am saying because of the above 2 reasons but being an biryani lover , it was too dearer to pay Rs 240 for a normal mutton biryani where you can get a damn good normal mutton biryani in Arsalan or Indian Restaurant within Rs 200 bucks . 

Overall I was neither satisfied with the food nor with the prices that I had to pay for it . 2.5 stars only for the Murgh Tikka Butter Masala . Instead of biryani try out Murgh Tikka Butter Masala it was really good and that is the only reason I am going with 2.5 😉

Not bad but not even good.
The food was good but the quantity wasn't sufficient. Moreover the service wasn't up to the mark. A well lit air conditioned restaurant in the middle of the town requires good food and service, but this restaurant lacks service.  The waiter wont pay any heed to your call once u placed the order. The attitude of the stewards were very harsh. I don't know its because of the this festive time or not but i somehow felt that it wasn't upto to the expectation.

Well.. This is the first time I have visited the place. Though the name is bypass dhaba but it is far away from being a typical Punjabi dhaba. Let's talk about the food. We have ordered chicken hakka noodles, fried rice, chilli chicken, chicken handi, and tandoori roti. The quality of food is good. Well coocked.  But the quantity is not at per the mark. This might be because of the puja rush. However the hospitality is good. But for the original review I might have to pay another visit soon after puja to understand the original quality and quantity of the dhaba. But as of now the quality is good only within the budget range.

It was pretty crowded. Luckily we didn't have to wait long outside for table. Had tandoori chicken in starters which was pretty good, chicken reshmi butter masala, chicken tikka butter masala, mutton chaap and butter naan in main course. All tasted awesome.
Nice interior. Prices are not too much.

I'd heard a lot about this place, so I decided to pay a visit since I was in the same area. But, I was pretty let down. We ordered dahi kebab (quite nice), cheese naan (with just a hint of cheese), dal makhni (so so) and tawa subzi. I was expecting better food.

This place is on of the newest addition to the dhaba culture of this city(which though is not a very lot of it) and one good thing about this place is it stays open till late nights (approx 2am in the morning). 

The place does not have a very large parking area, so it gets very crowded and the waiting line is a lot at rush hours (ideally between 8 and 10.30 pm). However, the ambiance of this place is very good, very class look to it and very nice sitting and dining area with comfortable air-conditioning. 

Coming to the food, at late nights (12.30am when we went), nuns are very scarce. Also, only tandoori rotis are available. We ordered Tandoori Roti with Murg Mussalam and Mutton Biriyani. The Tandoori roti, even at that late hour, took at about 15-20 minutes to reach the table which was like very strange. Also, the Murg Mussalam was not hot enough. The Mutton Biriyani was the first to arrive and it was moderately hot. The quantity of the biriyani was not huge enough, and the piece of the mutton that was supplied was not big and satisfactory enough. The quality of the  biriyani was not at all up-to the mark. Too much rose water and dalda just scarred the very authenticity of the biriyani.  Murg Mussalam was good enough, spicy and buttery enough to my liking, though the quantity was not enough to suffice one. There were 6 small pieces of chicken dipped in a very well prepared and exotic curry which was a much awaited relief in contrast to the biriyani. The tandoori rotis were nothing exceptional to notice about. 

The service at this place is good, though the food took time to reach the table, but still, the service was friendly and prompt and the food was properly served at the table. 

All in all, the service, ambiance is good, but the biriyani is poor, and the rest of the food was good, however, not enough quantity wise.

Just went to this place a few days ago. Saw the recommendation of Chicken reshmi butter masala in zomato and ordered the same but I must say I m disappointed. The chicken pieces are small and a bit costly judging the quantity. The veg pulao is good. Chicken kasha was again very bad. Also the size of the nuns and tandoori rotis were not at all satisfactory. Service is okkaayish.

Known as Flavours of Highway.. We went to this Outlet which is the Only One of their Kind located just before Chingrihata Flyover towards Sector-5 in EM Bypass.. Location is perfect and this place is always Full and Jam-packed even in Off Season due to its Well Maintained Infrastructure and Hygiene..!! The Interior is just Splendid and I can say it's one of the Best Roadside Professional Dhaba that you may easily tryout.. Their Outlet is quite Spacious and a good facility of Car Parking is also there outside the Dhaba.. As we entered, Staffs were quite good in behaviour and with their professional attitude and customs which is a must needed suited up the Ambience inside the outlet eventually.. The Cooling was gentle and perfect with an essence of Room Freshener not too harsh made this environment more friendly.. Coming to the Food Joint.. They have a Huge More than Enough variety of Menu Booklet of about 12 Pages out of which you have to decide which one to choose.. We Ordered Butter Tandoori Roti, Saffron Pulao and Mutton Bhuna Masala along with their Signature Special Mojito as Drinks.. Service was quite fast and in no time our Table was served with the Hot Delicious Food.. The Butter Tandoori Roti was superb and Unbelievable as the adequate Butter toppings brushed over it was so good that it just melted in our mouths.. Pulao was very good though could have a little more better if it was a little more garnished.. The quantity of Pulao was more than One Person sufficiently.. Coming to their Mutton Bhuna Masala.. This is One of the Best Bhuna Masala that I have ever tasted honestly. The Gravy was neither too oily nor too dry.. neither too spicy nor too dull but yes it was just amazing.. The extremely soft and perfectly cooked Mutton pieces was superb.. Everything went well Fantastically though We were a bit disappointed with their Signature Special Mojito that was nothing so amazing honestly.. Yes it was beautifully garnished with fruits and veggies but the taste was nothing amazing that made me giving a drop in their Rating.. But if you ignore that Mojito or could have taken Any Other Drinks.. You would have surely be a Fan of this Outlet.. Overall A Must Visit and Recommended Place for Food Lovers to visit here and I would say this is one of the best roadside Dhaba that you will ever get in Kolkata..

This is quite a new addition to the list of restaurants. 
Best part being that it stays open till quite late at night to satisfy your midnight hunger crave ;)

We ordered for Murg Tengri Tikka n Reshmi Prawn Kebab as starter and it was an absolute delight to my taste buds. Hyderabadi Dum Biryani and Chicken Lajawab are worth a try.

Had been for dinner around 21:00 hrs and found it to be almost full; and believe me, its huge. It feels you are eating in some marriage hall. The sound around was annoying but got used after some time. This was only a minus I felt of.

The ambience was decent, though nothing near to a dhaba to justify its name. It's just a standardized form of a dhaba. The service was just less than great in several aspects. Nothing earthshaking, but small things like Naan becoming hard in the first serving, and wait for the extra ordered Naan, etc. overall a pleasant enough experience. And yes, parking was another plus, for me atleast. 

In nutshell, you can give a try to this byepass restaurant !!

Saw this place while travelling via EM byepass,so as the name Byepass Dhaba.
First thing that stands out is the look of the restaurant. Pretty much u can see the beautiful interior of the place and people having food from outside and thats attacts u to dine in the place atleast it did for me.It has a huge car parking space which gives the DHABA look.
Price is moderate and service is pretty nice.People are quite friendly and tend to help you choose the food of your choice.
The resturant serves both indian and chinese food, but i recommend trying the indian items.
I was told to try Reshmi Butter Masala and Naan but i tried something else as i knew the former tastes nice.
I tried Tanduri Chicken which was good and fresh.
The Dum Chicken briyani was ordinary, nothing special and please dnt expect it to be in kolkata's best briyani list.
Now the thing that makes the rating go high was the Chicken items.The Handi Methi Chicken was awesome.
A must with tanduri roti or Naan or even with simple plain rice. i request the management to make it a resturant special.
So overall the place is nice to try and for late night dinner a ideal as it is open till 2.30 am.
Please try the traditional items in a dhaba like roti with a chicken items and i guaranty you wont be disheartened.

What a nice restaurant we have in Kolkata. I'm sure the tastes will leave you wanting for more. 
The restaurant is huge and has a classy parking lot. The staffs are courteous and food is very very tasty. The pomp and glamour of the Facade is truly justified with the food quality.  
This was a veggie evening. We ordered platter which had dahi kebab, hara bhara kebab, tandoori aloo and paneer tikka. They were all very good. The baby corn didn't turn up pretty good. I'd also tried the sweet corn soup which was delicious. 
For the main course, it was kadhai paneer and dal makhani. They were awesome. You'll keep licking your plate till it is swiped clean. The cheese garlic naan was not good at all. The cheese was missing. Any how i had a nice experience. Definitely a must go.

A very good well decorated eatery welcomes with the bright yellow ambiance. The food quality is quite good and it has a perfect blend of various taste . The location made it difficult for people to miss it while passing by. I really like the mock-tail which i have never had.The manager comes directly to escort the customers with royal hospitality.It has become such a wonderful place to have supper or dine with which you can easily find out with its long queue .The flavor of the highway,the finger licking taste of the food and the polite behavior of the employers add up to it. Really love to be a frequent customer in this restaurant.

Go to this place only if you want to eat good food and not looking for anything else...be it the service or the ambience..best avoided on weekends cause the service gets only worse. The maddening noise inside the dhaba was a big turn off. I guess they need more efficient staff to handle this big a crowd.
Once the food comes..no complaints though cause the food was not bad. 
But in order to make this place more customer friendly something should be done with the service part.

The service and the ambience of the place is really good. So is the space. The restaurant is quite spacious. The food quality and taste is also good. Since I did not try out the chinese items I will not comment about the chinese menu. But the Indian items are really good, including the biryani. Overall satisfied. And the cost is also reasonable, not too costly. It was a good experience. Looking forward to visit Byepass Dhaba again.

Went there with a lots of expectation but disappointed. The food quality is so average. The only good thing is the parking and the quick delivery(15 minutes only). We ordered a plate of Tanduri chicken, a plate of Reshmi kebab, butter nun, kadhai panneer and a mutton biriyani. Better nun was made out of white flour like road side food joint. Most of the famous restaurants are using Atta mixed with flour nowadays.  Tanduri chicken was good but the Reshmi kebab was below average. Biriyani won't come anywhere near the quality of Arsalan , Shiraz.

We placed 3 order of curry and 5 garlic naan for 5 people which was sufficient for us. Everything we tried was great especially Navratna Korma. Probably the best I have had in Kolkata.

Went there on a Friday evening at around 8 pm. The place was filled within an hour and there was a long queue outside. The restaurant is quite spacious with lot of seating arrangements. I have been to restaurants with very dim lights which I do not like at all but this one is very well lit with comfortable seating. Service is good. We ordered Tandoori Aloo, Hara Bhara Kebab, Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, Tangdi Kebab, Murg Hariyali Kebab, Mutton Boti Kebab, Punjabi Teekhi Macchi, Rawalpindi De Chole, Malai Kofta, Butter Nan, Kashmiri Pulao, Murg Tikka Butter Masala, Murg Tikka Lababdar, Rara Meat, Firni. Taste and quality was average to good. The one's that are worth to mention are Tangdi Kebab, Murg Hariyali Kebab, Punjabi Teekhi Machhi, Malai Kofta. Rest all were average. Do not try Rara Meat. Water was dripping from the AC vent at the place where we were sitting.

Went there after getting down at airport. It provides parking area, hence no problem. Can easily be seen from road.

Usually there's queue to get a table, but in rainy weather, it was not much crowded. 

Big space , vibrant ambiance, a perfect place for family dinners.

Chicken soup with mushroom was good. 
Their signature prep cheese nan was very tasty , ordered one more later. Black dal tadka was accompanied with, it was tasty as well. 
Signature dish mutton biriyani didn't make me happy, i had great expectation seeing this marked as signature one. It's average in quality. Potatoes were not tasty also. :( Heavy amount with 2 pieces of mutton is there. 

Their service was pretty quick. Loved the ambiance. As clock ticks towards night , restaurant keeps on getting full . Had a nice dinner , I'd say.

I was planning since a long time to visit this dhaba. Finally got a chance on 20th evening with family and friends. 

Well, my take on this modern dhaba is

1. It's very conveniently located. 
2. Eye catcher.
3. Decor - decent enough for us. 
4. Food - great, both in terms of quality and quantity. 
5. Pricing - decently priced, doesn't pinch the pocket. 
6. Staff - courteous, but not able to cater quickly.. probably due to Saturday crowd. 

What else you want. You can give it a try guys..

This sprawling new restaurant came up on E M Bypass near metropolitan crossing some time back. Was long time planning to visit the place as it.looks so good during night. Had a bit much expectation from it but was disappointed. The food was just average and service was poor. Their special chicken lababdar isn't tasty at all but the mutton biriyani and mutton rogan josh will balance out. The lime soda was another let down also. The mix kebab platter was ok so was the chicken tandoori. A mediocre experience overall .

A good decorated place to spend time with friends and family,advantage is that you will get enough space to park your car even in a rush day. Went there with friends and tried Murg Malai kabab and Murg Reshmi Kabab as a starter and it was mouthwatering tasty and that excited us to taste more food over here so we ordered Mix Fried Rice and Schezewan chicken ... Fried rice was good but Schezewan Chicken was not up to the mark but that's ok it happen sometime we understand that and so we continued to order more foods which were Butter Naan,Tandoori Butter Roti,Murg da Bharta,Murg Tikka Butter Masala and Murg Tikka Lababdar but let me tell you both Butter Naan and Tandoori Butter Roti were disaster,I mean I have never eaten that kind of hard and crispy Tandoori Butter Roti and Butter Naan in my life.. I mean It was very hard to eat and Murg da Bharta was equally disaster, I have tried many famous restaurant of Kolkata but never came across that kind of Butter Naan and Tandoori butter Roti and Murg Da Bharta is my fav dish were ever I go but today you have disappointed me completely and ruined all the good vibes which were started blooming as we enter your restaurant...
The service was also slow and below average. Need to be more quick and active. 
I hope that you will consider the complain seriously and work it out as soon as possible. 
So that in case 2nd time when I visit I don't have to go disappointed from your place.

Nice outlet with good environment and one of the best thing is the location with big parking space..
Now about for food, I tried Murg Reshmi Kabab, Murg Malai Kabab, Murg da Bharta, Schezewan Chicken Gravy, Mixed Fried Rice, Tandoori Butter Roti and Butter Naam. Murg Reshmi Kabab and Murg Malai Kabab were marvellous and mouth watering. Starting with these two mouth watering dish me and my friends thought that the food are tasty n may be all the item will be as good as these two. But the both naans and Murg da bharta were disaster. Murg da Bharta didn't worth the amount of Rs 220.
Naans were hard and crispy so the restaurant disappointed us over here. But Mixed Fried Rice and Schezawan Chicken Gravy was above the average quality.
The service is quite slow. Waiter /server needs to work systematically. As I noticed, some of them were confused.

Good food, nice ambience, swift service. One should try mutton achari there. It's too good! The price is a little bit on the higher side, but not as much as the other famous restaurants nearby.

I went there for dinner on sunday 
The place is over crowded and the hospitality of the waiters are really poor, 
A very bad experience
The food was also not upto the mark.
The waiter was asked about the dishes which they were not aware of any of them
Poor quality of food
Poor service
And very bad experience.

Mark my words this is the worst place to have mughlai food. First of all they will take at least half an hour to serve whatever you order and after that you'll find something which wouldn't taste good all. I popped in here on a Friday for lunch with two of my colleagues. Non veg starters where good but veg starter especially dahi ke kebab was horrible. It was too sour to eat. In main course butter naan was average and mutton keema was full of garlic instead of minced mutton. In veg kadhai paneer had too much onion and the taste was pathetic. We shelled out ₹450 each and in return we got just bad experience. I wouldn't recommend anyone to have food there. And finally the sweet and salt lime soda was only sweetness and that too unbearable. That's all I had to say. Happy eating :)

Many of you might have noticed the stunning gigantic building of "Byepass Dhaba", while crossing the metropolitan stoppage at EM Bypass, and kept it in your wish list to plan for a feast in this modernised version of Dhaba.
Honestly, the moment you step inside, the shining and bright interiors create an immediate power vibe on you, welcoming your way to a powerpacked sumptuous experience. And being located in a bustling area, it attracts huge footfall, which eventually makes the place crowded most of the time.

However, should like to point out some flaws in maintaining hygiene that should be taken care upon. Firstly the water purifier should be cleaned frequently so that the guests walking in are not served with turbid house water. It creates a repulsion then and there for sure. Moreover, it kills the appetite of a guest to see a dead fly lying on the spoon kept on table.
The service persons are polite and courteous, but need more training to be prompt in their duty.

To discuss about the food and beverage, it will be a sheer dishonesty to mark it bad/pathetic, but at the same time the discussion will be incomplete if the scopes of improvement are not mentioned. The drinks are refreshing enough and good in taste for sure. Among the wide range, some noted names are "Vestal Mojito", "Anti Colada" and "Knock the Door" which is worth giving a try.

The restaurant houses a wide range of kebabs in its starter list of which "Murgh tikka kebab", "Murgh malai kebab", "Murgh haryali kebab" and "Punjabi teekhi machhi", are the ones that any kebab lover will fall for. But, it is advised to concentrate a bit more to take care of making the kebab chunks more soft and supple in texture. Though the kebabs are genuinely delicious, the texture turned out to be a bit chewy.

Coming to the main course, the dishes that are worth trying includes "Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani", "Chicken Biryani", "Murgh Tikka Butter Masala", "Butter Garlic naan", "Butter naan", "Masala Kulcha", "Mutton keema matar" and "Dal Makhani". To be honest, in comparison to the starters, the main course dishes seems to be compromised to some extent on taste. Specially, if the price of the dishes are taken into consideration, the taste is not at all justified and that is the place where "Byepass Dhaba"(BD) needs to work hard seriously to improve.

And like any other promising restaurant, BD will surely glow with all of its pride, once they take their shortcomings into note and rectify them accordingly.

Wishing team BD a successful journey ahead.

Thanks to

Hmm..being my first review,i want to be nice while doing it. So ...let me put it simply...as the name suggests ..it's a dhaba on the bypass... food is typically like dhabas around you ...the tandoori items are really good but not that good when it comes to the main course. The biriyani is typically what we have in arsalans and aminiyas around. Presentation and ambience is just not up to the mark...the drink served was spilled..and I the guy serving had his finger dipped in the rayta .. which is like Yuk!! for me. I will make it easy for you by giving points on 5 . Food-3.5. service-2. Ambience -2.5. So...happy eating !!  and I hope I was of some help.

This place is located right on the E.M bypass. The location is very good and very hard to miss this restaurant cause it is in the road. 

Coming to the food, we ordered chicken Biryani to vegetable noodles. It was all very yummy. Totally worth it. One Biryani is sufficient for one person though. The Biryani was less oily.

The interior decoration and the presentation of the food is average though. 

The service was a bit slow. But we had gone in a big group, so that might be the reason.

Overall a big thumbs up from me...

Located at a very convenient place, you cannot miss it. Interior is good, service is good and we were happy with the food as well. We ordered Mutton Hyderabadi Biriyani, it was a delight! Also chicken lababdar should be tried if you are here! Best part is its open quite late in the night so suits your wish for a late night drive and dinner!

It was always told and known by me that Big surprises comes in small packages but after coming to this place i got to know that sometimes Big surprises comes in Big as well. With the fast running city like Kolkata where Food is just like worship for most of the Foodies and Bloggers and to some ordinary human beings who loves to eat good food and explore new places. Byepass Dhaba is one from them which is a small dynamite at the E.M Bypass to serve the fast running people on the go.  Indian Dishes are always been my preferable one and why not to have it when you get all at one place.

I tried food here in one of the weekdays with my family and it is a thumbs up for me. This restaurant is located right at the metropolitan bus stand on EM bypass. You just cant miss it. Very easy to locate. 

I tried Tandoori chicken. Very juicy, delicious ones. You might have read that other people have recommended it too. 
Naan and lachcha paratha both are very good. Chicken lababdar was great in quantity as well as taste. 
I didnt find any point to complain about. 

The staff, I must say, are very polite. They are busy and they have to be as this place is always very full. But they manage to pay complete attention to your need.

Ambience is very nice. Lot of space inside the dining hall. Ample parking space outside. 

Price wise it is cheap. 

Since it is such a popular place, crowd is mixed. Office goers, families and also some people who create noise while eating :-)

I recommend. I will visit again.

Located at a very convenient place at the metropolitan bus stop.The name is visible from a distance and has a huge parking area with is a plus.Interior decor was plush but for me the light was a bit too bright.The interior is quite large and is well maintained.
We went with a huge group as it was a birthday treat and they placed us right in the center.
The murg tikka and the murg reshmi kebab were average and so was the pan fried chilli fish, but a special mention must be made of the butter garlic prawn which was the highlight of the night.The mutton dum biryani  was good,but nothing special.The mutton was a tad too chewy.The chicken masala was rich and tasted good.The mix raita was creamy and tasted fine.
Coming to the service it was a disappointment for me. The waiters often kept dropping forks and spoons.They had to be told to clean the table before serving the main course and after the appetizers.  
The pricing and quantity is quite good and is an ideal place for a sudden late night outing as it remains opoen late into the night.

One of the most beautifully located restaurant, it is clearly visible on the right if you are arriving from beleghata area and to your left if you are coming from Science City area..... Have a good group, take a car and you will definitely enjoy this....

Location(4.5/5): The big yellow hoarding with it's name is quite visible from a distance of 500 meters.... They have a huge open parking space for cars and bike.... You can easily roam around,chit chat after your meal...One of the best locations iv come across till date...

Food(4/5): It was my friend's bday treat so the plan was to hog and hog 😉....We were 7 friends and we ended up with both Indian and Chinese cuisines....
We started of with 2 kinds of soups:-
**Hot n Sour Chicken Soup: One of the finest soups I had, not watery(had bad experience before), and not too many vegetables...Spice was just right... Definitely worth trying even if you are not a soup lover....
**Chicken clear soup: It was okay , won't say perfect.... quantity of chicken could be increased considering its a chicken soup....

Moving on to appetizers:-
**Golden Fried Prawns : A big no or if you are ready to take the risk then let me warn you, it was very oily.... If you are having more than 1 piece you might soon start having a giddy feeling... I am not sure whether it was only for that day or it is regular....
**Butter Garlic Fish : Presented beautifully, it tasted heavenly...Fish was so soft and juicy inside...The blend of spices was just right...I am sure you won't be satisfied with only 1 piece....
**Pan Fried Chilli Oyster Chicken :  Delicious and crispy, a must try appetizer it is... 

Divine Main course :-
1. Chinese 
**Mixed Fried Rice : Very nice flavours and rice granules were well separated...Quantity of chicken and seafood items were just perfect... The best part was overall quantity.... More than enough for 2 persons , pretty much unexpected.....
**Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce : This was the best dish of the night.... It was mind blowing.... No doubt the chicken was very soft, very juicy but the gravy just surpassed everything....That 'garlicky' taste was amazing.... A must try for Chinese lovers....

2. Indian
**Murgh da bharta : I had a very bad experience previously with this kind of dish but this just changed my feeling.... Very strong flavours and chicken diced very smartly...Just loved it...Thick gravy that blended well in the chicken pieces..
**Murgh Tikka Butter Masala : To be Frank, I did not like it much... I could not get that buttery taste with any bite... Chicken pieces were also quite big.... Should have diced a little smaller...Taste wise it was okay...Won't say superb.....
**Dal Makhani : It was good and simple...Nothing extraordinary... Just like we get in other restaurants... 
**Butter Garlic Naan : Very tasty.... Complimented quite well with the side dishes ordered.... 
**BD special Biriyani : You would want to compare it with Arsalan's but please don't else you won't b able to enjoy it... We had to had it as and when it was served because it was a little greasy...With time greasiness was increasing...But it was quite delicious.

Dessert and Drink :-
**Phirni : As per my knowledge phirni is supposed to be very soft when we dig in but it was quite hard... Texture just resembled of a mousse.... Taste was divine...Sweetness at its best.....
**Sweet lime soda : An amazing drink to go with starting from appetizers....

Service(3.5/5): Initially servicing was very quick but when we ordered again they kept on delaying. So the rating decreases in that area.. Other than that they were very courteous and nice people...

Ambience(5/5): Though servicing was not quite up to the mark but ambience and location did compensate for this.... Loved the interior design....Very classy....Keep it up...

VFM(4/5) : The total bill came upto 3800 for 7 people which was pretty much decent considering we ordered around 9 items....

All in all it was an amazing place...worth trying once...I'm sure you would definitely visit it again!!!!!

Its a new restaurant near science city crossing exactly after crossing Silver Spring. Found this place to be clean and well maintained (including the wash room). Ordered Kebabs which were very well cooked and succulent. So was the Handiwali Methi Murg. Service was fast enough, however for a repeat order you have to wait till a server comes to your table provided you are able to attract his attention. So was the case while asking for the tab. Very reasonably priced restaurant. I guess they will pick up the speed as they spend more and more time. The Chairs  lined up at the entrance was an eyesore. Please remove them. Instead try to replace them with 'Charpoi's just to bring 'that' Dhaba feel. Good initiative...carry on.

I’ve always had a soft corner in my heart for this place. Most of it has got to do with the fact that it welcomed me well, when most others wrote it off on social media siting various reasons. Another reason for me to like Byepass Dhaba is, it never lets be go home with an empty stomach, even if its 2:30am.
                                                                ...

Quite a decent and extremely spacious eatery with very well-behaved staff.
This place had welcomed us with open arms when we stepped inside after walking over 3 kms on the Paroma Flyover, due to bike-breakdown in the unforgiving 12 PM sun. 

First of all, we had ordered sweet lime soda after the scorching heat, and it was a life-saver; hands-down it was THE BEST sweet lime soda ever, with the exact amount of sweetness; and also masala cold drinks. Up next we had mixed chicken hakka noodles which had ample amounts of egg, chicken and prawns and enough for two. To kill the time needed to mend our bike, we found ourselves digging into some chicken tikka kebabs which were quite pleasing to the tongue too.

Pretty reasonable and worth giving it a try.

This place was a surprise discovery for us. After indulging ourselves into food tasting events, it was high time for us to have a laid back moment. We were originally supposed to go elsewhere but our plans got cancelled and we finally decided to hit upon this place for a quick meal. Located between Science City and Chingrighata, at Metropolitan bus stand, this place cannot be missed easily. With the excellent view from the main road, the ambiance and décor inside, instantly tempts people to make their way inside and enjoy a lavish and sumptuous meal.

I must admit, that the place has been very well thought. The interior is well decorated, and the sitting spaces are quite comfortable. The tables aren’t brushed together and lets you enjoy your meal. The place is a laid back, and inspite of being called a Dhaba, it gives you the comfort of a well thought up restaurant. There are also sufficient chairs placed outside for the convenience of the people who might be waiting to enter the restaurant on the event the place runs full. We made our way inside and occupied a table which was shown to us. After a lot of chit-chats, we finally decided to order for the following.  

1) Mixed Kebab Platter

2) Butter Garlic Fish

3) Tandoori Roti

4) Chicken Biryani

5) Mutton Biryani

6) Chicken Butter Masala

7) Mutton Rezala

The Kebab Platter was an assortment of various kinds of Kebabs, including Reshmi, Tikka, Seekh, Prawn, Hariyali and Malai Kebabs. The Fish Kebab and the Prawns were the highlight here and got consumed within seconds. The Seekh had a fine texture and the minced meat wasn’t course. The rest of the Kebabs were a bit stiff and wasn’t much to my liking. Perhaps a bit more of marination could have done the trick. These people needs to work on their Biryani. Maybe something of a finer consistency would do the trick.

Butter Garlic Fish was an absolute delight. Crispy fish fried in a thin batter tossed in Butter Garlic Sauce, neither the Butter nor the Garlic overpowered each other. The batter wasn't unnecessarily thick and hence did not mask the fish. One of the better dishes for the evening.

Tandoori Roti: Probably made out of Maida, this was crisp and fluffy. A perfect staple to pair with the side dishes.

Biryani: Resembled the early Rahmania. A bit on the greasy side, one needs to have it instantaneously. The greasiness would start growing on you as time passes by. The Mutton was a bit small in size but was soft to the core. The potato was a delight to have as well.

Chicken Butter Tikka Masala: Soft chunks of chicken with a perfect Kebab texture cooked in aromatic spices. The gravy was flavorful and was topped with garlic and cream. Recommended to have this with both Roti and Biryani.

Mutton Rezala: Had a Mughlai Texture to it. Cooked in a luscious yellow gravy, the mutton portions were soft and simply melted in our mouth. Definitely a step ahead than the Mutton Rezala available at Shiraz, Arsalan or Rahmania. 

The bill came up to somewhere around 2800 rupees. Definitely not a cheap place but the location and ambiance makes up for it. The service however was on the down side and we had expected better from a place like this. However, it might be a rare incident and might be improved or changed with time. The taxes were a bit high and some of those components can be done away with. Furthermore, the consistency if a big issue here. The quality of the food keeps on varying and I have seen people providing both good and bad reviews about this place. This is something that should be worked upon. Looking to drop here once again in a couple of months.

I visited this place about 2 weeks ago after reading Zomato reviews and I must say I was impressed. Fabulous ambience and interior, its surprising the pocket pinch is in the 500 range for this. We had the malai kabab and special biryani. The kababs were soft and oozing with flavors. The Biryani was one with 2 chicken pieces so that was ample for 2 people. The service was a bit slow but the waiters came to my table twice or thrice after that asking if we would need anything else and was the food okay, so a mixed feeling on that part. Also, there was a dedicated parking space so thats another plus from my side

A Big restaurant! Lovely decor. Lighting is bright indeed, and it gives you kind of a royal feeling, although the decor and aesthetics are quite modern. Food over here is very commendable. Me and my brother's friend were in the area for some work. So we deopped in for dinner.
We had ordered Chicken Biryani which was very good in taste indeed. Thr rice was soft and tender, the masala was perfectly blended with the rice, retained the chicken and the typical biryani flavour. The piece of the chicken was soft, well-cooked. 
I had ordered one Butter Garlic Prawns for me which is one of my favourite sea food items. The gravy was tasty. The prawns were tender and well cooked and the gravy was perfectly blended with the lbutter-fried prawns. It tasted really well.
Also had ordered a mocktail, the name of which I dont remember exactly. But it was a mango and litchi flavoured drink with soda. It was fruity, tangy and pulpy. Loved it!
The prices are little heavy on the pocket as they have various taxes to be levied on it.
Good place! Lovely ambience! Would visit soon. 
( my phone's battery was dead, so could manage to take only two pictures of the dishes)

This place is located in bypass where people would want to expect a great taste of food.. I visited bypass dhaba on a sunday and it was crowded.. ambience is good.. we got our place after 15 mins of waiting.. we ordered malai kofta and butter tandoori roti, the kofta was sweet in taste but the food was not so great, we enjoyed the mocktail which was kitkat shake more than the food.. At the end we ordered for kesaria kulfi which made our dinner feel great.. The place is average in compared to the expectation that we had the taste of dhaba food but overall the service and the location was pretty good

HEADED TO BYPASS DHABA on E.M Bypass - BEWARE

A Perfect Recipe for a Disastrous Meal Experience.

I visited the place on 12/06/16 at around 6.45 pm with friends & family, hoping to have an early dinner. Even though the place was relatively empty at that hour, we were not attended to, for a long time. Vegetarian Starters that we ordered were probably the only good part of the meal. Our ordeal started with the main course - Soggy Breads arriving much before the side dishes, chunks of foreign matter in Black Dal, Soft Drinks & Fresh Lime Soda's without any fizz and a strand of hair in Vegetable Jhal Frazie. On complaining, they took back the Dal and the Drinks, refused any action on Breads, saying they are perfectly fine, but when we complained of the Hair Strand in the Vegetable, the Manager and a Senior Gentleman standing near the Cash Counter refused to accept their fault and insisted that one of the ladies in our group must have put the strand in it and it was our ploy of not paying the bill. On protesting, we were asked to "Get Out" of the place and threatened that they will call the Police.

Having dined at innumerable places in Kolkata and other places all over the Country, over so many years, we have never been more insulted and humiliated. Coincidentally, the family dining on the next table were also complaining of a spider in their meal, but seeing us being insulted and humiliated, they moved out without a protest. It was a Nightmare of a Sunday evening that we had and it surely is going to HAUNT us for a long time to come. Our kids got so scared seeing us being threatened that we had to quickly pay the Bill and leave the place at the earliest. After this experience when we checked up about this place on Zomato and Facebook, we came to know that other people have had similar experiences too. I wonder how this place is still running and attracting customers in hordes.

After this experience, I suggest everyone to steer clear of this place. You would probably get much more hygienic food and better courtesy even at a roadside food stall.

Located on the metropolitan bye-pass crossing rightly named as the Bye-pass dhaba, though there is no specialty dhaba food in the menu it is regular North Indian stuff.

Visited this place twice and had different experience:

The 1st time was when it had just opened before the pujas and it was quiet a negative experience, presumably because of the teething issues when any restaurant opens and probably cos of the rush of Durga puja!!!

2nd time got some packed food paneer tikka. dal makhni, masala kulcha and green peas pulao, which was decent.

I like the decor of the place,  gives a feel of those  restaurants in tier 2 cities where you come to dine out during the weekend, it is spacious and can accommodate up to 200 guests at a time.

Pricing is moderate not so high and not so low.

Overall a good place for Late night goers and family dinner.

Went to have dinner with office  colleagues but unfortunately had a very sorry and harrowing experience with the service being pathetically poor and food lacking quality. The outlet was run by some extremely crass staff without any Manager. The rude attitude and insolent behaviour of the staff was disgusting. Moreover they refused to give any Complaint Book too. They behaved more like anti-socials. Needless to say the food wasn't even anywhere close to good. Just ordinary.

Location is really nice, just near the Chingrighata crossing, very easy to find. Neat and clean decor, well lighted. Spacious car parking area. 
Food is good. We ordered Mango Milk shake as Mocktail. 
Fish finger and chicken malai kabab as starter.
Chicken fried rice and chicken lababdar as main dish. All are good and tasty. We enjoyed the food.
And the most important thing is the place is open till 2:30 a.m. Which is sometimes like life-saver.

By far, it's the most non-promising restaurant I've been in a decade. The decor and outlook of the place would try to fool you and I admit they were successful in fooling me as well. The only pros will be the place is open till late night, and I will not talk about the cons coz it will give me a ache in my fingers. The place was half full when it was 1AM in my watch because there was no food joint nearby. Now coming to the experience, the waiters do not pay heed weather you are sitting or standing or littering or loitering. The manager is a tough guy to break, he will stare at you for long, but will not pay attention if you call him for order. We waited more than 30 mins to order 6 Biriyanis. After some time the manager came and said only Chinese will be available. We changed the order, but found out after some time the waiters are serving the Tandoor and Mughlai dishes along with the Biriyani to young and beautiful ladies only(Iam not faking a word). Nevermind, we waited another hour to get our Chinese. Needless to say, the roadside Chinese tastes better than those. Dying to get out of there, we followed up a minimum 10 times for our bill and promised together that we will die hungry rather than checking in here.

Another one of those places in Kolkata for late night dining. This one is located on EM Bypass and hence the name (I m guessing!). It is no where near a Dhaba and hence if you wish to visit this place for the Dhaba food experience, then please avoid it completely. Seating area inside the restaurant is huge and the service is not bad. Good ample parking space as well. However, what really disappoints is the quality of the food. Not sure I will be going there anytime again unless it is late night and i have no other options.

Located at the middle.of the stretch from Science city to chingrighata, this so called "dhaba" stays more or less full throughout the evening.

Decor and ambience: Nice. 

Food: Well this is a controversial topic. Some of the dishes turned out great. Some not so great. And some I wish I hadn't ordered.

Chicken tandoori: Awesome. Juicy and succulent chicken legs grilled to perfection.

Chicken chaanp: Very average. Plus, to make matters worse, the chicken was slightly undercooked.

Handi wala methi murg: This was okayish I would say.

And we had naan and laccha paratha which tasted good.

My suggestion would be just have their kebabs. Fish tikka and reshmi kebabs are pretty good too.

Staff was quite polite and courteous to us(unlike other reviewers,who have mentioned otherwise).

Prices are very affordable. Cheers!

Yesterday i checked in this dhaba for dinner.from outside it was so attractive for it's  name , lighting, huge space and sitting arrangement  service is good .all are attending  each and every table . But cleanliness not up to the mark .table was sticky even after cleaning. I ordered chicken malai kebab for appetizer.  It was good. For main course I took butter naan, laccha paratha , Motton special biriyani, chicken reshmi malai tikka masala with fresh lime soda.taste of food was  not so special. Lime soda was served so full of glass threre 
was no space to sip the drinks nighther to put sugar syrup in the drinks. We ordered sugar syrup separately for lime soda. Otherwise good for family  meet.

Finally.. they served us water. (RELIEF.)(ITS 12:20)
Order? "Wait for another ten minutes Sir. "( Worst waiters!)
12:30. About to leave. A waiter follows us. " Sir. Please give the order". 
We did give the order. Worst Decision Ever.
*plates got served in one minute but food served after 40 mins* Damn..clever waiters!
It was almost 2:30 and we got the bill.

One of the few places in Kolkata which allows a LATE night dinnig with your family and friends. True spirit of dhaba-ness in bypass road. Good ambience with polite staffs. Food is good in quality & quantity both. We tried with Hyderabadi biriyani which is quite different from the regular biriyani. Murgh malai Kebab and Punjabi teekhi Maachi kebab, was average which requires an overall improvement. Garlic butter naan, kadai mutton, murgh tikka labbabdar were the other dishes tasted which was good enough. Overall a great experience.
Drop in after a long drive in midnight :)

Recently visited on a family dinner. And had no idea that this place serves such good food. We ordered almost everything ranging from kabab, tandoori to rice to parantha and liked everything that was put on the table. The place is a huge area and I found a lill lack in service. Guess they do not have much ppl to attain more tables and thus one have wait for an unfair amount of time for their turn to get the food on the table. But it is rather a good joint for late night dinner and since the service is lill delayed u get to spend more time with your group, well that the positive part I guess.. hehe. But otherwise well done Byepass Dhaba and I'm sure gonna hit the place real soon. :)

Today i along with my wife visited this dhaba for dinner. After a long waiting of 1.5 hours we got the table. Few positive and negative reviews about this dhaba:-
Positives:-
1) Car Parking Available
2) Prime Location
3) Spacious place

Negatives:-
1) Table doesnt have tissue paper/handkerchief
2) Staff were disorganised. Lack of communication skills among staff. 
3) Food was not good
4) Service very poor
5) If you order something then wait for another 30 minutes to execute the order

Overall our experience was very poor and will not recommend.

Verdict - during late midnight..most of the time it runs out of biryani..so you can gobble upon the endless rotis and butter nan.

Located in an absolute sweet spot - Metropolitan bus stand. Connectivity is very good - be it for Ola/Uber, or for bus. Coming to the crucial point now; Ambiance is standard, soft yellow lighting almost everywhere, sometimes 'on' your face from the top around centre tables - (felt like god :P ). Anyway, we ordered Fresh lime soda (they put too much sweetener in the drink compared to lime composition, sweetness should be diluted a little bit), Butter naan with mutton korma, followed by Khazana E Tandoor and Special Dum Biryani. Khazana E tandoor was an absolute delight though the prawn was a little undercooked. Interestingly, a slice of cheeze was garnished on top of some reshmi kebabs - tasted better.
Overall, a decent place to hop in to recharge your tastebuds.
While you are at it, try their Aam panna to beat the heat.
Recomended.

Byepass Dhaba
The Dhaba-ness of this diner stops at it's name. From outside it is a typical family restaurant. It is quite spacious inside. Now, the best thing about this restaurant is that it's good to visit with your family. The staff is cordial and polite. Coming to the food: since it was our first visit, we went for known basics. We ordered Butter Nan, Paneer Butter masala, Mixed Fried Rice, Sweet N Sour Chicken; and Vestal Mojito's and Fresh lime soda's for drinks. The Fried Rice was predictable. They really need to work on their Sweet N Sour Chicken. The taste of the gravy was too sweet and sourness was almost nil. But the Paneer Butter Masala and Butter Naan was absolutely delicious. Hot buttery naan dipped in buttery gravy with soft paneer chunks, it was a delight to experience. The fresh lime soda was okay-ish. The Vestal Mojito was really good: hint of sprite with fresh mint leaves and lots of ice, this is a must-try on a hot sultry day. It was a good experience overall. Ting! :-)

But to my surprise, it was of normal temperature and when asked, they just put couple of ice cubes! Shrimp soup was of bad taste with hell lot of shredded ginger. I let them know about my dissatisfaction about all foods. I would rate them -5 out of 10. Won't recommend to go there. Total waste of money.

Food: Nothing great. I would say tasteless

Service: Should be rated negative on service. staff keeps cracking jokes while customers wait and watch. Took them 10 minutes to get me a bottle of mineral water. Food was served in over 15 minutes.

Ambiance: restaurant plays loud music. perfect for office parties and brats. People sitting on the table next to me were shouting and screaming at the top of their voice. NOT A PLACE for people who like to have their food peacefully. 

Location: quite good. Easily reachable since it is situated on the main EM Byepass. Although taxi drivers still don't know about the location of this restaurant

All in all an awful experience. Been to this place twice out of compulsion. I thought the cuisine would predominantly be North Indian. But every single North Indian dish I ordered had a Bengali touch to it. Not worth going again.

This place was in my bucket list from quite a long time. So I was much excited to visit this Dhaba located near Chingrighata. But this place turned out to be disappointing. Starting from the service to the quality of food. Everything is just below average. The service there in this place is very slow. The tables aren't that clean, looks like the whole of this restaurant is in a mess. Out of all the quality of food is just like some roadside stall, maybe even those roadside stalls cook better. 
The ambience is just average. 
To start with the food we had ordered for the below things:
• Stuffed Tandoori Alu - This dish was kind of okey. The potatoes were well cooked but the filling inside the potato tasted like some kachori filling. It was totally popping out of the potatoes. My vegan friend didn't like  the dish. 
• Chicken Malai Kabab - It tasted awful! Sliced cheese were placed over the reshmi tikka and served to us. The cheese was raw, it wasn't even properly melted. The quality of chicken was bad since I had to literally cut those malai tikkis with knife putting a lot of effort. It was dry and difficult to chew.
• Paneer Butter Masala - This gravy literally had no taste. All the flavors were sort of missing from this gravy. The paneer was rubbery.
• Butter Naan - This butter nan was exceptional since it had no butter in it. It was cold and chewy. We had to put so much of effort eating those naans . Literally we had a jawdrop. 
• Veg Biriyani - The veg biriyani had no vegetables in it and was extremely spicy. It wasn't that warm as well. 
• Sweet Lime Soda - Well this was the only thing which we liked out of all the dishes. It was refreshing and proportionate. 

Overall the experience was disappointing. We had so much of leftovers since the food was bad. Would request the management to improvise over the quality and taste of food.

Been there on my wife's b'day. Had a great experience. The place has all glass walls and you have the view of the speeding cars over the Bypass, which is great. The food was good. I think the fish kebabs in here are a must try. Foods are reasonably priced. I read some reviews complaining about the service time. But to my surprise, the food were served within 10 mins max. The staff were courteous. In all we had a great time.

While crossing the road near science city, everytime I thought of giving it a shot. Firstly speaking of the decor it is very neat and nicely decorated with very well behaved managers and staffs. The dhaba was real spacious.

Since it was named as " dhaba" so we tried to taste dhaba style dishes like the sweet corn soup, tandoori murg as starters. Then came cheese nan,garlic butter nan and a plain nan with chicken lababdar and chicken jhal frezi as main course.We had tutti fruity ,vanilla with hot choclate and kaju firni as desserts. Now coming to the taste of starters and main course were very good. The tandoori was good but it could have been a bit softer. our spoon did not go well and so we had to eat with our hands .I have tried the cheese nan for the first time and it was too good. Its a must try.Chicken lababdar being their signature dish , it was wonderful, creamy and will melt  in your mouth. 
Now while ordering desserts , we asked for the sizzling brownie which was their signature dish. But to my surprise they said they did not have that. I would have given a point 4 score, but not having your signature dish on the restaurant. Who does that even?
But the kaju firni n tootti fruity were very well made and served very quickly. But dont try out the vanilla icecream with hot chocolate. becoz they forgot to squeeze the choclate i think. It was thin strip of hershey's syrup on two scoops of icecream.

Overall , a nice experience . One of the buzzing restaurants in near future.
I will be there to try out their more dishes. Till then, this is it.

Heard about this from few of my friends and colleagues..so gave it a try as an offc party..

Location-20 minutes from ulatadanga..cross the chingrighata stop and then in the next signal take a right there u go..

Ambience-spacious and the decoration is simple and soothing

Food-we ordered for Knock the door,BD special Vestal Mandarin mojito,Tandoori Murg,Mixed fried rice,Garlic chkn gravy,Trutty fruity,Hot Gulab jamun,Kaju phirni.

Knock the door-it contained milk,kiwi,cherry.it was average and on a personal basis I found it to be a bit sour.

BD special Vestal Mandarin mojito-served with a lemon slice and with mint leaves along with the lemon pulp with fresh Mandarin,this was good and looks nice as well.

Tandoori Murg (4pc)-the pieces that we were provided with was good and was nicely cooked.the chicken inside was soft and juicy.

Mixed fried rice-the quantity compared to the price was good,plenty of chicken and egg were there however prawns were like a lucky draw. The taste was good.

Garlic chkn gravy- This was tasty as well and the chicken was soft and had the taste of gravy inside it.. 

Trutty fruity-the rose syrup that was applied was on excess and there were hardly any fresh fruits.

Hot Gulab jamun-it was good and hot as well.

Kaju phirni--the taste was good a bit different from the normal phirni that we generally have.

In a nut-shell a pocket friendly dhaba with parl quantity and I was happy the way the staffs took care of us rather 17 of us with a par service time.

Me with my daughter and  two other friends went to Bypass Dhaba for dinner to celebrate the Women's Day 8th March 2016.

Our experience was over all OK. We paid the bill without checking it.

After Eight days I was checking the bill just like that and found that they have billed for one Vanila Icecream which we have not ordered and have charged Service Tax of 5.8% which they said that they don’t charge. 

This is a SHEER FROUD.

I therefore will Request all the foodies who wants to go there that PLEASE CHECK YOUR BILL PROPERLY BEFORE PAYING IT.

Location wise a nice place specially for family outing. Ambience is A- class but no alcohol served which is a disappointment. Service is nothing to complain about, fast , courteous and always ready to serve. Quality of food is not so great. We ordered a kebab platter which had prawn and fish along with chicken. The prawn and fish were both smelly and the chicken was very chewy and not fresh. Special Biryani was good with two pieces of mutton, one egg and one potato. Mutton chaap was the worst. It was soo sweert as if they have added some sugar syrup into it. Lastly the tutti frutti, dreadful. I have never had such a dreadful dessert in my whole life.  Would not recommend this place if u r a mughlai fan but u can give it a try once because opinion differs man to man.

Been here for dinner. The place is well lit. Simple basic interior. The food was good. The fish starter was amazing. Mutton biriyani was undercooked. The Chinese was bad. The service awfull. The order was served after 45 mins and had to say the waiter three four times before they filled our glasses with water or bought in knives and fork.  I would have given two stars but extra just for the fish starter.

Have been to Bypass Dhaba a few months ago to celebrate the birthday of a dear one. We were a group of 9 people and we entered at around 7:45 pm on Tuesday (3rd November,2015). The place was brightly lit with nice ambience and ample space for people to sit. They were prompt in making us sit and serving water quickly. But, I feel that the whole staff there need more training to deal with their customers. They were not rude, but they looked confused all the time.
The ambience gets a 4/5 from me.

Note: I have lost the bill and hence won't be able to provide you all with the exact price details. Sorry. :)

So we started with,
1) Tandoori Chicken (4/5) : It was well charred, not very tough to tear apart. Soft and succulent with all the Tandoori flavours hitting the right note.

2) Fish Kebab (2.5/5) : There were not many choices for fish lovers. Only panfried chillifish and fish tikka was available. So we went for fish tikka. They promised us bhetki fish but I doubt if it was bhetki. The kebabs were good to taste but not flaky and the fish inside was not cooked properly. It was still translucent pink in the middle.

Next we moved on to the main course,

3) Palak Mutton 3.5/5 : The palak mutton tasted usual, nothing exceptional. The mutton used was of okayish quality. I personally feel that the dish would have stood out if it would have been a bit dry than the runny texture, we had.

4) Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala (4/5) : Sweetish silky buttery gravy with reshmi chicken tikkas! Went great with butter naan!

5) Biryani (3.5/5) : Both the chicken and mutton biryanis were well prepared with a soft succulent potato, an egg and a good big piece of juicy chicken/mutton.

6) Nawabi naan (4.7/5) : I hope I have got the name right. The naan was absolutely stunning. The naan was topped with nuts and that what made it nawabi. The naan had a crunchy texture and was sweet, hence tasted amazing when paired with spicy curries/gravies like the palak mutton.

7) Butter naan (3.5/5) : Tasted fine.

They had no desserts available and hence we had to settle for the matka koolfi which neither came in a matka nor was it made by them. It was normal store bought koolfi.

The total cheque for 9 came up to something close to Rs.4000.

Recommended ( not wholeheartedly though).

Happy eating. ✌🏻

This place is located near EM Bypass. It has got a nicely done decor. 

The ambience seems to be quite family type! 

To begin with the starters, we ordered, 
Manchow Soup - tasted appropriate 
Paneer Tikka - superb in taste
Dahi Kabab - average on taste 

Heading towards Main Course, we ordered, 
Dal Makhani - very tasty
Kadhai Paneer - average
Malai Kofta - the Koftas were a little harder but taste was nice! 

The Breads included Masala Kulcha, Butter Naan and Cheese Naan all of which was good!

The Schezwan Fried Rice was good but had very less quantity! 

The seating availability is also quite sufficient for the place. 

This place isn't too expensive too.. We were 7 guys and we had a bill of Rs.2700

P.S. The non veg food was also remarkable as per my non veg eating friends!

Just came back from the place after a family dinner. I guess the best part of the place is the location, even a few relatives who came from new alipore reached in a ziffy thanks to the Maa flyover. Anyways enough about the location, you never go back to a diner because of the location. What matters is the food...and yes it was good enough to go back again and again.

Thanks to big family we did get a chance to try a good variety of food... Both the veg n non veg platters were very good, food was tasty n served hot n fast. Personal favorites - egg tadka, chicken barta n peas masala. 

Yes now the reason I gave only a average rating... Poor desert choices and the billing took ages. Somehow spoiled the experience a Lil, but do try the place for sure.

It's well located, well priced and good food.

Had visited the place on 27th of February at 1:00 am. I had gone along with a group of friends. The only thing dhaba about the restaurant is its name and nothing else. The interiors are very modern and beautiful. The restaurant is located as soon as you get down from the parama flyover. 

We ordered for crispy chilli baby corn as starters. It was good except for the fact that it was quite spicy. 
For main course we ordered dal makhani , paneer makhani, chicken tikka butter masala, butter naan , masala kulcha and tandoori roti. All the items were quite average, nothing out of the ordinary. I was quite disappointed with the tandoori roti. It was very soft and not at all crispy. 
The service was slow and the waiters took a lot of time to respond specially when asking for the bill. It took around 15 mins just to get the bill. 

Overall the place is okay if you are looking for a late night eatery. One plus point about the place is that the prices are very moderate and the prices on the menu are all inclusive of taxes.

The restaurant is situated at a prominent location on the EM Bypass. The bus stop is Metropolitan between Chingrighata & Science City. I went there with my group of friends. The ambience of the restaurant is very very attractive & beautiful with its excellent food & service. One should order Biriyani or Butter Nun along with Side Dishes there. Overall, very nice experience! Visit there once.

This restaurant is easy to spot with the bright decor from the EM Bypass. The food is good both taste wise and quality wise. The best part of it being the private spacious car parking infront of the restaurant. The service I would say is a bit speedy (very contrary to the other reviews that I had read before visiting the place!! )..the waiters were in a hurry to pick up plates and bowls & clean the table  (which had honestly irritated us). Keeping aside this one point the restaurant deserves appreciation. The food quantity was OK, the butter naan and Chicken Korma were absolutely yum.

The place is prominently visible to anybody traveling by the e.m. bypass flank leading to ultadanga . The restaurant is located right next to the bypass near science city  ,hence the name . The interiors are snazzy , with a lot of space , warm hues, perfect decor , leather seats , polished tables , concealed lighting , giving it a shiny look and feel . Sadly however , the service is nothing close to what one expects by looking at the exterior . The waiters are few , and on a busy Sunday night when all the tables are full , they struggle to manage the crowd . Many therefore are left complaining about the slowness of service , and I was served food 40 minutes after ordering , which is strange in a proper restaurant such as this ! The food however is not bad , not amazing either .  The amount served is just about enough , not ample. I liked the cheese naan ,and  the garlic naan . The masala kulcha was not bad ,the butter naan was good . The chicken bharta here tastes bland , has an overpowering flavour coriander  , whereas the mutton masala ( boneless ) had a dominant taste of tomatoes and onions . Both were served in tiny serving bowls and were just about enough for three people to share . I asked for lassi but they said it was unavailable , so I had to opt for the lime soda , which came in a pretty mocktail glass , with a cherry at the bottom ! All said and done, the place wouldn't seem so bad if they just improved on the service , maybe increased the number of waiters , took less time to serve the food . After all , you get the added bonus of  a wonderful view of life moving on outside through the glass window as you tuck into a good time .

Visited this place with my friends for dinner, was two minds to go there after reading most of the reviews but still tried my luck. The ambience and location of this place have always scored good grades but I also found out that the food is not as bad as mentioned in the reviews. We ordered Indian food coz that's what I do usually when visiting a dhaba and I found out that the food was good enough, we ordered lasooni dhania chicken, dahi kebab for starters, dahi kebab was good enough though the chicken could have been better, for the main course we sticked to veg. We ordered aloo do piyaza, dal makhani, pindi chana, gobhi matar, butter naan, tandoori roti and the food was pretty good, the staff was very polite and prompt though they should be a little more trained. Pocket friendly also, compared to other popular dhabas in town. I wish to say thank you to the staff for a pretty good dinner. Will surely visit again

Wonderful location, beautiful decor, seems like a fine dining and not dhaba. Service is good, people don't delay, they keep coming to the guests. But the quality of food and hygiene needs to be worked on seriously. 
Last week we went to this place in a mood to have lunch. Ordered chicken malai kebab and fish peshawari kebab. Both tasted bad! The choicken is not at all soft, not at all juicy. The fish was a pure Bangali mach bhaja which had no special flavours or texture. Both the dishes served did not at all look tempting. More importantly, while we sat, all the plates already displayed had dust everywhere, we had to change the plates. The table was dusty!

The place needs a lot of improvement!

With a very flashy exterior and bright clean interior, this place catches the eye easily. The food was OK.. now a little improved.. Nothing out of the ordinary this place provides u an option other than a few famous dhabhas if Ur tummy craves for some food late in the night. Did not meet with bad service as mentioned by most in their review. Maybe they've worked upon it. Good cheap option after a late night party. However, they don't serve vinegar onions or onions with the food and u need to order a plate for which they happily charge 70/- bucks. BIZZARE

The location is good but frankly, there is nothing different or special about this place. You have to know what to order. You cannot just order anything. They have Chinese but I suggest you don't order them pure 'dhaba' kind of food is good though, but I repeat, nothing special about it. You may visit it's the kibd of place one would want to go if they were extremely hungry and had nowhere else to go.

Driving through bypass you can't help but notice this place. After an event in science city 15 of us decided to visit this place. The place is decently located and has a parking lot so that was a plus. We got our table fairly quickly considering we were a group of 15 people. The ambience is OK and the place is very loud. It is a family place and the decor is decent. The first turn off about this restaurant was the menu card the very fact that it did not have any and had printed sheets of paper stapled together in place of the menu card. The menu is less than plain basic as it did not even have fresh lime soda. What kind of restaurant has a sheet of A4 paper instead of menu and does not even serve fresh lime soda. We decided to order paneer tikka as starters and after that placed the order for main course. Placing the order was not pleasant as the staff is highly untrained. It took some time to place our order. After that we had to wait 30 minutes for our food and surprise main course was served before appetizers and what is more surpring was that the main course that was not even complete it was half the number of rotis we ordered and just the dal. The two sabzis paneer and alok do pyaza was missing. On enquiring with the waters they told us that it was coming and by the time the sabzis came which was another 10 minutes the rotis and dal was cold. And on saying this to waiter he said aa gya sab. And then came out appetizers really unique of them to serve appetizers after main course. The restaurant badly needs trained staff and the food is just average. I would not recommend this place until they train their staff and improve their food. A forgettable experience.

The service is good and so is the food. Had chicken tikka butter masala, paneer do pyaza, cheese chicken kabab , butter naan etc.. The only disadvantage is that there is one toilet for male and that too sometimes it's occupied by staffs and the guest has to wait 10 minutes before he can freshen up. The overall experience was good but can definitely be much better.

Since Zomato doesn't allow negative rating. And also, since there's something about the decor of this restaurant that attracts people in general. That apart, there's nothing tasty or enjoyable in this outlet. Bad food served by unfriendly staff.

It was really a bad experience on first time visit. Ordered mutton biriyani. Road side biriyani is far better than here. Plz dnt order biriyani here. Staff behaviour was also not good. Expect interior design nothing is good. Observed every one was not happy with food. That was my first time visit as well as last time.. :(

Worst in most of the dishes.... have to improve a lot.... better opt for another restaurants nearby if not in hurry... service is pathetic and have to improve a  lot, in many ways. Very week in crowd management. Quantity and quality is food served is substandard, clean and attractive from inside though.

Lit up brightly from outside, but the ambience inside is just average. We ordered for starters n the waiter told us it would take minimum 30 mins so we directly orederd the main course.
The food was tasteless. The dal tarka fry that we ordered had no tarka fry, it was a regular home made dal. I would never go back there unless i am starved and wants to quench the hunger.

Had been to this plase even after going through awful reviews in a hope that people might be wrong about this place but they were actually right. Waiters are actually not responsive and dont care about the customers. The food is good but they dont have the full variety all time. Being a vegetarian i already have very less options left for me to choose from and the only thing they had was paneer and aalu. No koftas, no corn,  no palak, no peas. I request everyone not to go to this place ever. Trust me you are gonna regret it.

Bye pass dhaba, located at one of the iconic places of bypass. Caught my attention and specially my moms. She insisted on trying something new and we landed on byepass Dhaba.  The exteriors were done up well enough. 
The food: the food was substandard as the menu is found everywhere. The simple Indian food. The food is okay, one can try if one feels like. 
The service: The starter was served properly, but the main course was served 20 minutes later, no I'm not exaggerating. We had to serve the food by ourselves as the waiters did not be courteous. The manager proved to be not well in control of the situation. The order was messed up too. I wouldn't recommend someone to go all the way to byepass dhaba when one can order or eat the same at any local restaurant. Much improvement needed.

This Dhaba has everything good except the serving of food takes too long than expected. At one point of time you feel like getting into the kitchen & check what exactly is being cooked :p ? But the wait is worth it. Food is real good & what more the bill is extremely pocket friendly. If you order more on a Roti or Nun meal than rice it is even cheaper. We went on Durga Puja saptami with a gang of 8, so there was rush. Some customers (couples) were complaining of availability of dining on early basis. Overall location, food & ambience of Byepass Dhaba gets a thumbs up from me.

Going into this one is what you call a bad ending to a good evening. Disgustingly bad service. They don't even care whether you have been waiting for long or ended up cancelling the order.

A roadside quality restaurant with classy ambiance with attract anyone's attention who travel frequently on Bypass Roads of Kolkata. The interior is lit up with fantastic lighting and glass decor makes a class apart from dhaba category.
Huge free parking at bypass road side is unimaginable. We were in hurry so had to settle for take away.
Ordered Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken, Pan Fried Chilli Fish and Mutton Rarra. I can say they are standard with respect to both Mughlai and Chinese cuisine.
Chili Garlic Pepper Chicken has touch of Chinatown taste but Pan Fried Chilli Fish was an excellent item. It has huge fillet of bhetki more than enough for 2 adults. Must be tried here.
In main course Mutton Rarra wouldn't disappoint you. Boneless mutton pieces goes excellent with naan and roti. Price was reasonable cost us only INR 660. Location is perfect as melting point. They don't have liquor license.

This SUnday, 6th December, on the insistence of my friends, ours being a group of 9 people, decided to try Byepass Dhaba....but that was a BIG MISTAKE on our part. Reasons are as follows:
1. Upon reaching @ 7.30pm, we told the manager to arrange a table for us and were told we need to wait. Sat outside but were under attack from mosquitoes. Even after 40 mins of waiting when tables were not alloted to us and people who came after us were ushered inside and accomodated, enquired and were told that they are waiting for a particular table to get over and cannot accomodate us by combining two vacant adjacent tables. groups of uotp 8 ppl were accomodated but a group of 9 pax could not be accomodated. Phew!!!!
2. After finally securing a table, ordered food which included a masala papad.....the papad had turned soggy by the time it arrived at our table. is that how a masala papad is served?
3. while consuming food there was an argument going on the adjacent table regarding some extra items billed. Thought it to be a one off case. BUt we were wrong. WHen our bill finally arrived, we found we were also wrongly billed for items we had not consumed.....and that too after the stewart took 5 mins to check our bill. These XTRA items were not printed in the bill but hand written. now that was 2 cases of wrong billing within 10 mins.....AWFULL
Train the guys at the gate to do proper crown management. do not resort to these wrong trade practices. in a city like kolkata, it takes a lot of effort for a restaurant to establish its name. Do you ppl want to leave KOlkata for ever!!!!

Byepass dhaba is a new addition to the restaurants coming up around the Bypass road on the eastern fringes of the city. Situated in close proximity to the Chingrighata crossing this place is very brightly lighted up and has a very attractive feel to it. Because of it being very new the inside of the restaurant is in excellent condition and extremely neat and well managed. Seats are comfy, and ambiance is good. Food is also decent here...we had ordered chicken biriyanis and a portion of Chicken Bharta. The Biriyani tasted really well, much better than what we had expected and the bharta was also decent enough. Overall a good place with quality food served at reasonable prices..and a welcome addition to its locality which perhaps lacked decent places to eat out.

The first time i visited Bypass Dhaba, was on its opening day. The first thing that would come to anyone's mind about this place is its location, and its perfect! It is a brightly lit restaurant on the main road and the interior gets even better.:)

I had tasted a wide variety of north indian food items which included many starters followed by the main course and dessert. I loved each and every item! And I was amazed to see the way so many guests on the very first day were so easily attended to. Everyone seemed to be satisfied.

I have become a frequent visitor of the place now!

Great going Bypass Dhaba!:)

This is a new (less than three-month old) Multi cuisine  restaurant located at the lovely space on EM Bypass.I ate there last evening with friends, and the food was truly excellent: authentic flavors, yet innovative, and beautifully presented.And the  décor is sophisticated and delightful. All in all, Byepass Dhaba  is a really high class experience—yet the prices are moderate.Service is a bit slow for which the generous GM apologized as they are having some renovation or alteration in their kitchen.Chinese is too good,next time will try Moghlai and Tandoor items!! Overall it was a Classy Experience!!

And the surprising thing is they have opened the Restro till 2:30am.so..food lovers if u r hungry and want to taste something good in cheap price, plz go and give it a try.its really worth it.

Firstly the menu. Which Dhaba does not have butter chicken, serves COLD KABABS & have chinese food?
Now...the food...Kababs are atleast 24 hours old and tastes like rubber. 
Butter naan is as good as having a shoe without any hint of lather i.e. to say u hv to figure out where the butter is...The best dish was the Coke which they did not cook. In one word Horrible...BYPASS DHABA SHOULD BE SERIOUSLY BYPASSED. KINDLY AVOID OR TREAT PEOPLE THERE AGAINST WHOM YOU HAVE IMMENSE GRUDGE :)

Went on a sunday,  Free 4 wheeler Parking was available, it was fairly crowded but we didnt have to wait. Got a place to sit, The waiters seemed terribly busy with other things and overlooked the fact that there are new guests who were left unattanded for at least 10-12 minutes and finally the menu card drops in our table upon asking... we chose to have biriyani and chicken handi. Again, had to sit with the menu and literally scream to call the waiter and place my order. There seemed an utter chaos. To add on there were hell lot of flies inside the resturant which kept bugging, hence we decided to change the place but without any end result coz flies were everywhere. Finally, arrived our dishes. Food is good. We relaized there was hair in the biriyani plate, conveyed the same to the waiters who did want to change the dish but I refused. Overall experience was not good at all. Wishing the management takes into account my feedback and starts working on it.
All the best .

Bad service, idiot staff and pathetic food, the only reason I rate this "dhaba" 1/5 because zomato does not allow negative rating. Me and my friends went there on 22nd October, 2015 and faced the nightmare of restaurants in Kolkata. Firstly no one attended us promptly and the bad service of ignorance continued throughout. Then stupidity of staff...
Me: "How many pieces of mutton are there in Mutton Masala?"
Waiter: "2 or 4 pieces"
Me: "Or? Why such a dynamic range of quantity?"
Waiter: "Main kaise jaanu sir, maine kabhi khaya nahi hain yaha par" #How would I know Sir, I have never eater here.#

Then there was a small hair in the mutton masala. When reported at first the staff there just acknowledged the fact and did nothing. Then when we forced the manager "Just" Bobby changed and gave us a fresh plate.

After meal we asked for fingerbowl and the idiot staff said "Sir, fingerbowl khatam ho gaya hain" #Sir, we are out of fingerbowls#

Q: When do you know that you should close down your restaurant?
A: When you are out fingerbowls.

I have visited several restaurants covering both posh and roadside, and this one of the top worst ones I have been to. I will never be visiting this place again and strongly suggest everyone I can to not go here.

Yesterday(on Kali Puja day) I went to Byepass Dhaba with my family.  Food was good. Service was quick. Parking was nice and easy to find location. We didn’t have to wait. We ordered Tandoori Prawn, Kadhai chicken, Mutton kasa and butter tandoori roti. Tandoori Prawn was good; Mutton kasa was also good and quality of mutton very good. Kadhai chicken was ok. Personally I prefer chicken a bit soft. Overall I liked food and ambiance. Interior is bright and beautiful.

We had to wait for around 45-50 minutes. Even though empty seats were available but they wouldn't let us in (accompanied with a friend of mine). Location is decent. 
Crowded place and noisy too. Frankly speaking chaotic. Waiters are responsive but sometimes they forget about small groups. I wish they had taken more care. 
Coming to the food we ordered reshmi kebab and haryali kebab first descent recipe but what we found was that chicken pieces were not all fresh some were.
That made a foul taste obviously.
We ordered chicken tikka butter masala and garlic and butter nun. Good. On a scale of 5, 3 I think should be the score. 
We ended up with lassi. It was good.
On an whole it was okay. Not great. Not a place you would like to visit often in the given price range.

Hopeless to the core is what I can say about this. Whenever we pass thru this place it is always over crowded..Even after reading about it in zomato we gave a chance to try after the much crowded Durga Puja rush was over ,thinking that maybe it was a diaaster because of the puja rush..But must say its highly disappointing..Staff courtesy, presentation, ambience nil.. Coming to the main concern which is food ,we being veg  can say the best part was mineral water n chilled cold drink n papad..Other than this paner tikka was still decent.. Chinese is a big no no.. Would def not recommend it further

Worst restaurant I had every visited in this city. It has opened newly on VIP Road near metropolitan, so it is obvious to come everyone's eyes. I have visited this place on this Durga Puja restaurant is filled up with customers that are usual. The first thing that I came across they don't accept the card. 

That is ok as I am also carrying cash. But the worst part of it, the hospitality of their staff. One guy had called my name from the waiting queue and asked me to share a table with other as they don't have the table for 2 available at this time. I asked them I am ok to wait till I get the table for 2 as I don't like sharing. Again after 10-15 mins their manager called my name and when we came in they again asked me the same thing. When I requested them that I can't do that they simply ask me to wait for more in very rude manner.  

By visiting a restaurant first thing come to my preference are ambience and hospitality. But they are 0 in both departments. I don't know about the food as I left that place calmly after that. I find this is the right place to express my grievance so that they take this thing seriously for their future customers.

Pathetic restaurant.. Few points
1. 1st gate keeper take bribe and give entry
2. Quality of food is pathetic
3. I have asked for veg option in menu, 1st of all after being asked for veg he was very rude, he told that only paneer tikka is available, we order for that, but quality of that was so worst that I can even think about it.
4. I have asked why don't u have veg items in main course, he told its non veg restaurant and they hardly serve veg food..and very frankly he told if I u want too eat, eat else u can decide...

Awesome service .. Keep it up guys...

It's a new restaurant which is situated between spring club and Chingrighata and very much visible from bypass road . There's a mad rush to get into the restaurant. At least 25-30 people are waiting outside. However  the wait time is normal as with in 10 mins we are able to get a table. We order chicken malai kebab , butter Naan , mutton kaara , mixed raita and cold drinks & all this costs me 610/-. No service tax wowwwww!! That's something unexpected . Overall food quality is good , decor and ambience is nice and crowd is also good . Definitely worth a try . Ull get Chinese as well ..

Located exactly at the midway point between Spring Club and Chingrihata, Byepass Dhaba is the newest addition to this area. It's made up in a prominent place beside the EM Bypass and is easily visible to everybody passing along it. The place has been decorated quite nicely and has bright and neat interiors with good parking space which is a huge plus.

The food served was decent to my taste and the rates are as reasonable as it's anywhere else in town at a Dhaba.

The biggest challenge seem to be their ability in coping up with the huge inflow of customers and their orders. The service suffers due to that with misplaced orders and somewhat chaotic environment inside.

I'm quite sure and confident that they will sort that out cause any new place has its goods and bads. To me however, Byepass Dhaba has more goods than the bad and that's enough for me to visit this place again.

This place is just off where I stay, hence dropped by for a post-dashami dinner. Nice, classy decor. Good interiors.
I guess they were still using the puja menu, hence it showed little more than 15 items on it.
Anyway, we ordered two plates reshmi malai kebab, chicken biryani and a couple of salads.
The kebabs were good. The biryani was even better. It did lack a spot of seasoning though, but nvm.
The service was pretty efficient, the waiters friendly enough to click a couple of pictures for us too. 
This place is definitely something to watch out for in the near future. I hope they only up their standards here on. 
Would I recommend? If you're passing by the area and you're not loaded enough for lunch at pricy locations in the Silver Arcade, FOR SURE!

This restaurant is located in such a place, everyone taking the EM bypass route can see.
Location 5/5.
I visited this place on 21/10/2015, lunch, and it was a mess. We were getting dished which we did not order even, the food actually had no taste at all.
One of my chicken dishes was not fresh and smelled very bad, the manager did not bill it to me.
I feel this place has great potential, but if they continue like this, it will be very difficult..

One of the most horrible joint iv been to...tasteless,salt less,sweet North Indian food...a menu consisting of 10 items in total and that too took 35 mins to serve(despite being precooked & ready)...worst of all they over invoiced the bill by 350 Rs & never bothered to apologise...this place is at best avoided...BEWARE...!!!

Worst food. Worst management. Waiters have no proper knowledge about the menu and the contents. I don't think any of the waiters are professional. They don't know how to behave with the customers or treat their guests. I visited Byepass Dhaba with my friends during Durga puja. After waiting for one and half hours, they suddenly presented a stupid menu with a very limited choice of food items. And the main thing I would like to mention, there was a HAIR in the food . we complaint about it to the manager but he was also good for nothing. I must say , we had a Very bad experience.

Very bad food. We ordered chicken masala and they served us home style chicken full of oil in it. My house maid serves better chicken then this. Peas polao was stiff with chef's hair in it. Veg jhal frez was full of onions and capsicum. There were no vegetables. Butter nun was plain nun. I think they didn't bother to apply butter. Green salad but it was full for carrot.. They should name it carrot salad rather. Horrible food.

The only thing that was good was the decor...
Service was just disgusting like we ordered for one Reshmi kebab and one Fish tikka kebab and it took arnd 47 mins to come...
Then agn was the biriyani i.e the preparation was white and yellow rice cooked with potato and a piece of mutton and a BUCKET of keora jol (a an ingredient of the preparation)...
The fish tikka was not atall up to the mark i.e under cooked like anything...
Off all these the The Reshmi kebab was atleast eatable...
In other words it's like a place where people thinks of going only when you don't get place in any other hotel...
And one more thing the took arnd 27mins to bring the bill...

Two words for the experience here - highly disappointing !
Since it is near our place ,it was convenient to go there for our Ashtami Dinner and we had also heard decent reviews about it.But Oh My,was I in for a shock!
We had ordered Tandoori Chicken,Dal Makhani,Mix veg for our dinner.We also wanted to order Chkn. Biryani as a takeway.So the waiter said that he has to see whether Biryani is available.
Our first dish the chkn. tandoori arrived and the taste was just good but it wasnt well done.

Now the rest of the food arrived almost 50 minutes later.And meanwhile the waiter had still not responded on the availability of the Biryani. So we got our food almost after an hour and then we get to know that the Biryani isnt available.The Biryani was supposed to be for my Grandfather who was waiting for his dinner at home.And what kind of service is this where a waiter dsnt even know which dishes are available and which are not ?
Not only that the waiter just simply forgets to respond to a customer's query !
I am completely disgusted and disappointed by the service ,not that the food was anything to talk about.
The daal was not bad,but the Mix Veg had pieces of black gobi (seemed burnt) and I could not have it.
Moreover,even the tandoori roti was not well done !
How can a dhaba expect to do well when it cannot even do the basics well ?
It was that bad an experience that I do not even want to give this place a second chance.

Travelling along the vast spaces of half constructed edifices in an otherwise nondescript bypass, one simply cannot miss the bright golden structure of considerable size situated at the Metropolitan crossing. The Byepass Dhaba (don’t get misled by the name as it is a fine dining restaurant serving food from two specific cuisines) stands sturdy as a savior from the dearth of good eateries along the tiresome stretch of a never ending road. 

I was happy to be one of their guests on the opening day at the onset of Durga Puja.  Arriving with a friend for dinner a bit before 9, we found the place bustling with activity as customers came pouring in and curious passersby in cars pulled in to pack some items for take away. While the polished, mirrored interiors and bright lighting blended perfectly with the festive spirit all around, the tantalizing aroma from the kitchen couldn’t help but heighten our famished state. So we ordered our food which consisted of Fish Pepper Salt, Kebab Platter, Cheese Naan, Chicken Do Piyaza and Mutton Biryani.

The fish came on a bed of chopped onions and greens and had the least amount of a batter coating on it. Even though I couldn’t exactly recognize which type of fish they’d used, it was extremely fresh and tasted quite nice with the flavorsome sauce.  Next in line was the kebab platter with all sorts of items made using charcoal. It had chicken tandoori, chicken malai kebab, chicken tikka kebab, prawn tandoori and fish kebab in it. I LOVED the chicken tandoori best. The outside looked pretty charred but as I took the first bite, I couldn’t help but fall for the smooth and moist texture of the meat with a distinct flavor of ghee and smoke. The next best item was the malai kebab which was soft, full of flavor and had perfect seasoning. The prawn and chicken tikka kebab could have been softer but they all tasted nice nonetheless. 

We had teamed the cheese naan with chicken do piyaza and were happy to taste how the two had mingled with each other so nicely. The naan was what we had wanted it to be; extremely soft and cheesy. Smoke and cheese can never go wrong and the thick gravy in the chicken dish was completely yum! Then we had the biryani and I was slightly disappointed with it. Being an ardent biryani lover, I happen to be very finicky about its flavor. While the aroma and quality of rice was perfect, this one had too much cinnamon for my liking. The perfectly boiled potato, egg and mutton made up for my dismay however. 

The staff was extremely polite and their service was commendable. The manager took special care of his guests. He even asked about my views on the food and attended to my suggestion for changes earnestly. Overall we had a pleasant experience and I would love to go back to this place and try out their other items on offer. 

P.S.: The chicken tandoori is highly recommended!

One of the worst places I had food recently.....apparently this was their first day and surprisingly half of the items on the menu were missing......the staff had no clue on how to run a restaurant (we ordered for a coke and were told its not available, however the table next to us ordered the same 5 minutes later and suddenly it was available)...... Hopefully they will get better as they get old

PS - This was a Dhaba without Black Dal and Papad:(
