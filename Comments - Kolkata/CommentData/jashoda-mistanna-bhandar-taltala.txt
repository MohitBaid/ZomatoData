I like the tok as in sour curd the rosogolla is not that good. Although we visit quite often as it is near to my house but the sweets were stale when i bought

One of the famous sweet outlets near taltala, offers a huge variety of sweets. The mishti doi here tastes amazing, a must try for people residing in this locality.

Jashoda Mistanna Bhandar has been one of the oldest sweet shops in central Kolkata. Their sweets are one of a kind. Mishti doi, rasgulla, cake Sandesh, khirer Sandesh, everything is to die for. The service is really good and the prices very reasonable. Trust me when I ask you to visit this shop. This is coming from a foodie who prefers quality over quantity. You're welcome. ðŸ˜Š

I have grown up on their sweets and trust me the growing up has been awesome...
And please don't limit yourself to the sweets, you will do yourself a world of good if you try their samosa and kachori. During evening/afternoon, typically they would run out of samosa and kachori by 6PM
