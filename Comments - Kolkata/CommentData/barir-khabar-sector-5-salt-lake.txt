Hi I am a  customer of this canteen The Food quality here is worst, anyone could get  better quality food from footpath canteen in Salt lake sector 5. The price they put on every food item is very high than other food canteen. The chicken pieces here are mostly small and they do not have other recipes other than chicken curry. I do not recommend any of the customers to take food from this canteen.If not proper measure taken from the owners of the canteen then its impossible to take food from here.

Today we have placed order 8 plates for lunch. These include veg thali, fish thali, chk thali and egg thali. Reasonable rate, food is good and tasty and they maintain food hygiene. Sufficient food for an adult.

Last week tried non veg thali over there, delivery was on time. 
We ordered fish thali, which consists of rice, dal, one veg dry, one veg gravy, one fish, two roti, salad, papad, chutti and one sweet dish. 
Rice quality was very very bad and below average,  dal, roti, veg gravy and fish was average in taste, dry veg was raw, sweet dish also very bad in taste. 
Overall below average experience, not recommended for foodies.

Today we have placed order around 10-15 plates for our lunch. But unfortunate totally disappoint about quantity. Our stomach only fill 50-60%. Side dish quantity ok, but they should consider about main dish like Rice, roti. Only 1 Roti delivered with Rice. No complain about taste and quality.

It's a great place for lunch with reasonable rate. You would find it great if you like bengali food. The food is good. I've lunched here everyday at office lunch time more than one year.
