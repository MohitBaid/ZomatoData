Awesome Christmas Eve dinner, the spread was huge with big number of options. They had some awesome meat delicacies and deserts all inspired by Christmas. Service was too good and the ambiance was fantastic. Only thing that pinches is the price. But for such an awesome food and service its worth.

Food-5/5
Service-5/5
Price-4/5

Had an awesome fine dining experience in pre christmas eve.Enjoyed their bright & glorious decoration, Live music & delectable brunch with an array of sumptuous & mouth watering items.Their dessert counter was as delicious as the main course & starter. Alfresco is no doubt one of the best choice for a buffet dinner.

I caught up with my friend and decided you explore the renovated icon of Kolkata - The Great Eastern. We both residing out of Kolkata, we were nostalgic about the idea of dropping in at this legendary place, now managed by Lalit group.

The new modern entry from the side and the lobby, would not give you the feel of the Victorian architecture tucked at different sides. We chose to have dinner at their restaurant at Alfrescos.

The decor and ambience was all whites. The narrow alley type seating appears cramped up.

We ordered Soya Ki Shammi Kebab for starters. The portion was nice and the taste was succulent, pretty much near to its original non veg avtaar.

My friend ordered Bhaja Muger Daal with steam rice and Aloo Bhaja Bengali style. Though i must admit, it was surprising that it took a lot of coaxing and pushing the staff as well as the sous chef to prepare the Aloo Bhaja, something which is not expected at a 5-Star. The food was cooked in very appropriate Bengali style.

I ordered a Chicken a la Kiev. It was awesome. The parsley butter moistened the chicken so amazingly. The crust outside was perfectly done.  It was very delicately prepared, exactly the way it should be.

On the sides we ordered Virgin Mojito, which was prepared just the way it should be. 

Need to have friendlier staff and responsive service.

Well to be frank, except for the decor and the ambiance nothing was good here. Extremely disappointing experience! Food was bad but the service was horrible! The most horrible service we have ever experienced. There was no one to serve properly. We were expected to have unlimited beverage and a beer according to an offer. But there were nothing and nobody to ask for anything. At the end there was one guy who did come up but we were left with no interest and was extremely disappointed. It was absolutely not worth paying so much.

Me & my wife visited there on 20th August' 2017 for lunch buffet after telephonic confirmation. Got warm welcome from their staffs and ambience was very very good, specially glasstop roof and long glass wall decoration was beautiful.. The behaviour and co-operation of the staffs was rememberable, specially Mr. Avik and one girl who taken a review on tab from me.... After all about Food - Extreamly good.. Too much variety and spreading of the buffet, salads-starter-main courses and all was very very good - fresh - tasty & well cooked.. Dessert section was also good but need to add some bengali items,, we had visited other places but here we got a Complete Satisfaction from all angle at all. I thanks to Alfresco-Great Estern Hotel's food and breverage section.. To the Cooks and all other staffs,, thanks again to Mr. Avik - who taken care of our lunch..

The ambience is great. The interiors and decor is also tasteful and niche. The staff is friendly too. But the food doesn't excites the taste buds. I feel a huge revamp is needed there. The buffet refilling is not done which is not a good sign in such a reputed place. The staff also forgets and have no marked responsibility which makes it difficult for us to enjoy the experience. So a good place but a major revamp needed would be my opinion for the place to survive the emerging upended competition.

Good restaurant very nice ambience. Staff is excellent. Food is good. Buffet menu should consist of at least one or two chinese main course. We five of us were having lunch f&b staff was not allowing us to sit according to our choice of table they were telling all tables are reserved you can sit on this table. Don’t know why, buffet time was about to close more than half of the restaurant was empty.

Heard enough of alfresco and thus decided to give their buffet a try. We had nearbuy vouchers and value for money is great at this price. The starters were amazing especially the chicken kabab and achari paneer. They also have a live pasta counter. Nd pasta in red sauce is a must try. Main course was little bit disappointing though the star of d show was the noodles. They had 7-10 varieties of deserts. They certainly looked good. But didn't taste as they looked. All in all it was a good experience. Ambience is wonderful. Nd d waiters were very helpful. Nd if you have nearbuy vouchers this is certainly a place worth giving a try.

I visited this place last Saturday for a lunch buffet.  Even before prior reservations i had to wait. Never the less after a certain time i got my seat. Ambience is good. Coming to the food it did have a lot of variety. The chart section was really good and we could customise our own ingredients there. I liked their north- indian dishes. Somehow they could have come across better dessert options.

I went in alfresco today with my friends for a pre-kali puja dinner. As booking was recommended, i booked ahead of my visit. As usual, being a star property, the welcome on arrival was great on the premises. Then we entered the restaurant, and enquired about our reservation. To my surprise, they said i did not had  any booking. On further enquiry, it was found out that the person who took my booking did it in lunch instead of dinner( though i specified my booking timing many times at 9.30 pm during my call). Anyways we proceeded to the table and we started off with the starters which included 2 vegetarian n 2 non-vegetarian items. The fish starter was the most amazing. The buffet spread had a very elaborate menu, so that you never get out of choice. The food was very light, not very rich. The taste was good but nothing out of extra ordinary. One thing i would suggest is to be a little pro-active on the service. Most of the times, whenever we tried to locate the service associate, they were not there and after requesting for any item, it took quite a lot of time. At times we actually had to sit and chat for 10-15 mins to get the refill. Overall, the visit was quite ordinary. Maybe being a star property, i expected a bit more.

Had the lousiest breakfast in a long time. Thick rubbery pancakes and stale, hard meat (bacon and sausages) were the lowest point. Despite sending feedback and requesting for a change this is what came back even a second time. Was celebrating a friend's birthday and here's the icing - the house cake they sent to the table was stale and rancid, smelling of vegetable oil in the way desserts from budget bakeries do. Please clean up your act. Was there after 3 years because I had loved it the first time around. Just soaked in the ambience and got through on fried eggs and fruits. The food was a very poor starting point to my friends bday.

We were lucky to get a table here on a very busy afternoon of nabami , since the place was mostly reserved.. coming to the food, the starters were just bad, just bad, with all aloo pakora, sabji pakora n all craps! Then comes the mains , sabji biriyani, mutton biriyani, ok i agree it tasted really excellent. Then normal rice,  patay pora fulpoki , mutton kosha, chicken, Prawn which were just average... they even had crabs which was just hard to break n have the flesh inside ( total dissapointment) !  They had other breads , buns , which was just a waste, bcz people came their to have bengali bhoj, they were just there to add on the number of items on the menu, n nothing else, noone was actually eating them, they had the live counter for pasta, noodles... then comes the desert where they had several assorted sandesh, baked rosogolla, lyangcha, fruits etc.  Service were not prompt ! We had to wait a lot for them to clean our waste plates! N one more very very crucial thing is that their lids are too heavy to actually open them in one hand and serve yourself with the other . Alfresco was a total dissapointment i had with a pocket ponch of 2500 per person.. things could have been better

I targeted The Bakery but unfortunately due to festive season it was not serving breakfast, so opted for this unit. Food was great had a good  breakfast buffet spread. 
Now coming to the service, one person came and said both hot and cold coffees are available, we were served the hot coffee unfortunately asking twice for the cold coffee it did not arrive. This is not expected from such a place . Otherwise staffs were friendly and attentive.
Overall a good experience.

Splendous ambiance with awesome customer service. All the staffs were very well behaved and providing prompt service. Warm welcome with greetings and same goes when you leave. Soft instrumental music behind perfectly compliments the atmosphere. Staffs were very well mannered and dressed. At times they do remind us about the items available and one should try for. Whenever needed they were always there with a smile. Never had such an awesome experience being a customer.

Food was yummylicious including desserts. Had good variety of food and desserts. Few bakery items were also available. Salads were very fresh. One can also have prapri chat, all items are available, one just need to fix it up as desirable. The presentation was very nice.

Must visit for food lovers.

One of the best buffet spreads in town where you can stuff yourself to the gills and then feel bad that you couldn't stuff yourself some more. 

If you're looking for an elaborate spread, with a soothing ambience and eating to your heart's content then the Sunday Brunch at Alfresco, The Lalit is something you will absolutely cherish. The spread is lavishing and they've got lots and lots of variety. The only thing they lack is a live pizza/pasta counter, other than that they're food & service would surely steal your heart away. Not just that, they have live music playing which adds up to the mood. 

Coming to the food we had - beginning with the salads, which were enormous in number. From baby corn to fish salad they had it all. It'll be hard to let go of salads for a change. Then there was 2 veg & 2non veg starters which tasted decent. Adding up to the healthy food, there is Make your own Chaat counter that boosts up your creative skills to mix and match some sprouts raita and chutney together and to create some colorful Chaat. Next, the soup was alright, it was more like a broth though. Along with that there were choices if about 10-12 kinds of breads. From croissant to buns to sweet breads, they had it all and they tasted delicious. There was a spread to make our own falafels with 4 different kinds of hummus. Then comes the Gujarati dishes, which had chakri, soya sticks, Dahi Vada, Rasam Vada, and added with various kinds of Achaar. There's also a live Kalappam counter for the south Indian food lovers. 

For the meat lovers, there's a separate carving station and this is a must must try. Do not leave this, as they serve the best meat with the best barbeque sauces. That's not it, there's a treat for the street food lovers too. They've got 3kinds of Puchka and Mumbai's  special Ragda Pattice. Now the main course too is gonna leave you spoilt for choices, with 4 kinds of biriyani rice, and about 5-6 kinds of gravies from each part of India. From rajasthani to manipuri they had it all. Also another fascinating dish was the gulab jamun ki subzi with tasted astonishingly good. There's also noodles and Manchurian for the Chinese food savvy. 

The most awaited course of the meal - the desserts. The only expression that define that - WOW. Red velvet to cham cham, doughnuts and walnut brownies, they had it all. It was really hard to gobble up anymore yet they look so good that you can't say no. Again don't miss out on the waffles with ice cream. Overall they truly stole my heart and they deserve a great shoutout as one of the great buffets in Kolkata. 

The service was really good and also the chef personally comes up to ask if they serve you better. Very generous behaviour and also attentive. The glasshouse decor is definitely mesmerising and it adds up if it's raining outside. 

Next time if you're looking for a great place to hog some delicious delicacies, without a second thought, head to Alfresco. 

Food : 4.5/5
Ambience : 5/5
Staff : 5/5

It had different sorts of salads, Chinese and  indian. Since it was my friend's birthday they also gave us a small cake. 
Coming  to food , the taste was good. It had a good number of dishes for both vegetarians and non vegetarians . Fish however could have been better. 
The service was excellent.  Waiters were good. Overall  a thumbs-up 👍

We went for buffet dinner a couple of days back and had a wonderful experience. The food was sumptuous both in the veg and non-veg categories. The chicken stew and baked fish were delectable. The staff were courteous and could well read our needs. But the dessert section was not that impressive. One or two items were good, particularly the caramel custard was very tasteful, but the other items were pretty ordinary. Another plus was the pan masala they offered at the end of the meal which I love to have, but sadly most of the bigger restaurants don't offer. I would have given a 5 but deducted 0.5 for the desserts.....with

Ambiance and interiors of Alfresco restaurant are jaw dropping beautiful. The service was good and the staff friendly. The buffet had a variety of North Indian, Continental & few Chinese dishes. The starters were surprisingly unimpressive & off the mark. But the main course was nice. Continental dishes were very good. The baked fish was superb. Desserts were extremely yummy probably because Great Eastern excels in bakery products. Its definitely worth a visit.

My rating is primarily on the basis of value for money. I had lunch buffet here, which costed almost 2k and in that amount, the only good thing i got here was ambience.
The servers are courteous but majority of the time they are absent and sometimes they are absent minded too. I was also not offered the welcome drink as part of buffet until i checked the same and asked one of them, if there is any welcome drink part of the buffet.
Coming on to food, they only have 1 veg and 1 non-veg starter. The main course spread and its taste, both were extremely ordinary.
I was eagerly waiting to jump on to the desert spread but i was utterly disappointed. I love sweets and still probably for the 1st time ever, i left half eaten sweets on my plate. Only 2 dishes which i loved are their blueberry cheese cake and baked boondi raita, for which i rated them 2.5 instead of 1.5.
I will not recommend their buffet if you are paying the full price. Go only if you have discounted vouchers / coupons.

Came here along with my family to celebrate my sister's birthday. Had heard so much about this place that my expectations were sky high. The ambience was beautiful. An all white furniture thing is so soothing to your eyes always. Service was slow and needs a little improvement on efficiency. 
Now, regarding the food spread - I wasn't satisfied. We were availing Nearbuy vouchers worth 999 INR for that meal. It was very limited and the cooking too, was very mediocre. The variety of cold cuts was so limited. There were no pork, beef or turkey variety. Only the Indian section of the main course was good. Starters were too oily, enough to kill your appetite not to have the rest of it. Desserts looked delicious but didn't taste so. Only think I absolutely loved was the live crêpe section. It was very ver good. 
That was my experience in a nutshell at Alfresco. Going to come back? Never.

Pathetic service from a 5star bakery. Had ordered yesterday 1kg eggless chocolate truffle cake for my daughter's birthday and received the cake today with no greetings written on it. The staff had assured that it will be done. Initially, they were reluctant to take orders citing reasons that I had to come in person. And also that they take only 2pound orders. LOL, I had ordered thrice earlier over telephone only and that too 1 pound cake. Moreover, last order bill of 30/5/2017 had 13/- INR due and today they denied including the amount in the current bill. Price of cake also increased post GST.KUDOS! Great response from a 5star hotel! We customers pay hefty amount of product and taxes and then what we get is not up-to-the-mark. Attaching both bills too. Really disappointed. Spoilt my day. Will never order again. Please anyone else also avoid it. Better bake it at home and rejoice. # Alfresco Never expected this from a renowned hotel chain.

On enquiring,Staff tells dat v hv mentioned in our menu dt " We levy service charge"..
On the other hand in menu it is clearly mentioned that "we DON'T levy service charge"....

Today was my first visit to Alfresco to celebrate my wife's birthday. 
The decor and ambience was quite mesmerising.  Touch of elegance everywhere. The roof top is made of glass and fortunately it was raining that time and we felt to seat under rain. 
The buffet lunch was really good with lots of variety starting from salads main course and dessert. The dessert portion was really impressive one. 
All the dishes found well cooked and delicious too. 
Staffs were very spontaneous and we'll behaved. 
They served the starters on your table and after that you need to carry on with your choice. 
Overall experience  was really nice. 
But as per the standard of a 5star hotel and compare to other buffet junctions at the town, the starters were really less with only one veg and one non veg dish. Which need to be increased. 
My package was inclusive of unlimited soft drinks where I find the problem. 
The first glass of coke was good with lemon but when we asked for 2nd glass the taste of coke got changed and same too on 3rd glass. We realised from 2nd glass onward they mixed water most coke less. 
It's my request to the management please don't follow this practice when you have announced unlimited drinks with the deal. The hotel belong 5star category and being a customer we don't deserve it. 
All though a good experience.

Hopeless and bland food ,very poor service , none of the staff is aware of what's in menu. Vegetarian and Non Vegetarian food kept together. 
We have totally wasted our money and time , will never dine at LALIT. 

Very very pathetic and great eastern has brought shame to the LALIT group.

We had gone for a weekday lunch buffet there. I shall write the review what I told them when they have asked for feedback.
Ambiance - 4.5/5
Hospitality of staffs - 5/5 
Cleanliness - 4.5/5

Still I am bound to give lower rating overall due to the food quality.(2.5/5).
Options for items were lot but most of them did not taste properly.
We missed out the welcome drinks which was supposed to be there - as we forget we did not ask for it; however should have been served by them.
The non-veg starter was of fish and good one but the veg starter was a sort of mashed potato in bread crumb coating - when you are serving 1 veg starter the item should have been better may be in baby corn/mushroom/paneer tikka type.
Salad spread and chat items were good.
The chicken coriander soup was not much better than the quality of soup provided by roadside momo stalls.
Out of the 5 veg items - the dahi aloo, dhokar dalna and one gobi item were there which did not taste good at all. I have often observed that many restaurants try to serve few pure Bengali food items in the buffet - not sure of the intention may be to pacify the mindset of the bengalees. Whatever the reason is there is no harm in it till the time you server bengali food with enriched taste and quality. If you serve this quality dhokar dalna to people , i bet outside world will have a misconception regarding bengali food.
The rice items were there -steamed rice,  chicken biryani and one polao - which were really good.
But the gravy items - the kerala mutton curry, forgot the chicken dish name and bori diye macher jhol were not at all upto the mark.
The mutton curry was the worst - neither the gravy was tasty nor the mutton pieces were succulent.
The chicken pieces tasted like boiled pieces immersed in water directly.
The fish was good only do not know why they had added drumsticks in the gravy item , may be the bengali "katwar data" is of low category for a 5 star restaurant item. Ideally data begun bori diye macher jhol does not include drumsticks while cooked in bengali houses.
The desserts were just ok type - the sweets could have been better and varieties shoukd have been more.
One more surprise they served cold drinks with ice floating in it. This was not expected that they do not keep enough cold drinks in their chiller to be served without ice.
The icecream was also very ordinary without and toppings on it.
One thing I am bound to say that at discounted rate of Rs 899/- , the buffet spread was good , however the quality of food have gone for a toss.
Will request the management not to compromise food quality due to low buffet price because at lower or equal rate we have much better food available in Kolkata like Barbeque nation, chai break, ocean grill in sector 5 even in other 5 stars like Hyatt or Marriot.

Lalit Great Eastern is another popular name in 5 star catagory. After trying a lot of buffets in competitive 5 stars, Alfresco located on the ground floor of Lalit was very impressive to me.

Its classic iconic ambience create an impression from the very first. Glass rooftop & beautiful decorations by some art pieces make this place much more elegant. Small lotus filled pond beside the dining space gives a snoothing effect to your dining experience. But this beautiful ambience has some disadvantages also. If you visit this place for lunch in summer days this glass room kind of make green house effect inside. So in sunny days it may feel kind of suffocating. Beside all of this wonderful service is something you can expect from this place.

If you've tried some more premium buffets before then it might feel a bit small to you but the items were choosen very preciously over here. Started with the salad & cheese counter, only three kind of cheese was available but Gouda was my favourite. Unlike other places fresh fruit juice was available in salad section. Grilled & gravy Fish, Chicken & Mutton items were equally good. With this a lot of options were available in bread section but rice dishes felt very ordinary. The true luxury impression was their dessert counter. Liked most of the items but found Red Velvet Cake to be extraordinary delicious. It was one of the best I've ever tried in a buffet.

This place definitely gets recommendation for its superior fine dining experience & very good food quality. Pricing was comparatively cheaper than other 5 star buffets, that makes this place a super deal.

Alfresco is one of best departments of The Great Eastern. They serve numerous foods from different cuisines specially when you come to the buffet junction you can make your own choice at a reasonable rate during the lunch time. The ambience inside the hotel is no doubt fabulous with calm sweet music played in the piano. Just two three feets ahead are the foods and seating arrangements are marvellous.

SubStandard restaurant in an Iconic Hotel

Food: The food is okayish. We had a buffet dinner here. It included coffee in the beginning with cookies and sami kabab. The cookies were nice but the sami kabab was shit. The main course included a sweet corn soup which I didn’t have, so cannot comment. Then there was club kachori, some potato side dish followed by 2 types of salad and papri chat. Salad was ok, but the curd in the papri chat wasn’t good. This was followed with Polao, Nun, a chicken preparation, Barishali Fish, Paneer lababdar and Subzi Vaganza. Of the entire lot, only the fish and the paneer saved us. The fish was well cooked and the paneer was also tasty. Chicken was dry and the filled with oil. Desserts had baked rosogolla and Chocolate ice cream with choco sause and other toppings. The baked rosogolla was nice and the icecream was fine as well.

Ambience: Having been located in one of the most iconic hotels of Kolkata, they enjoy the most accessible location as well as a wonderfully decorated interior. The small lotus filled pond beside the eating area gives as a soothing effect. Even the glass roof above the café space is a wonderful concept. The place is filled with nice paintings and is very well maintained. 

Service: Since it was a buffet, so not much service was needed. But the servers were prompt in clearing the plates and the staffs were overall helpful in nature. Cash and card both accepted. Valet parking is available as well. However, we had to wait for some time after our dinner before we got our car. But given the rush, it was totally fine.

Overall: Nice place to visit once, for the sake of the Great Eastern nostalgia. But if they do not improve their food quality, the nostalgia won’t help them in the long run.

Been to this place a few times now, love the decor and the silence in the ambiance. The buffet dinner is very well laid out. The only thing that concerns me on my last visit is that the service standard is falling not up to the mark of a 5 star and is quite slow and sloppy.

Alfresco, the Italian word means to dine in open air.
Though not really, but quite literally it transforms the dining experience, as the dining hall is covered by glass so the diner gets to see the panoramic view of The Lalit Great Eastern.

It has wide array of savouries and desserts but the choice of starters is limited both in terms of variety and quantity.

Starters :
We had Egg Pakoras and Manchurian Idli as starters which were quite tasty.
The sweet corn soup was good and there was an assortment of Cheese as well.

Salad :
The salads included - Chicken Salami, Corn Salad, Smoked Salmon and more. The smoked salmon was amazing.

Main Course :
From the main course platter, I tried the Chicken Roast, Jeera Rice, Chicken Biryani, Railway Mutton Curry, Bengali Fish Curry, Baby Potatoes in Cheddar Cheese, Paneer in Saffron based gravy, Mixed Vegetables and a Spinach curry.

All of the savouries were excellent and I particularly loved the Baby Potatoes in Cheddar Cheese Sauce.
There is a station for Indian Chaat and Pizza as well. The Chaat station helps you get a customised chaat according to your taste. The Live Pizza station gives you deliciously​ fresh pizzas.

Dessert :
The Dessert station is gigantic.
There was multiple fruit cuts, cheesecakes, tarts and Indian sweets. I was in awe of the Baked Rasgulla, which was the best baked Rasgulla I ever tasted. There are many ice-cream options too, to choose from.

Staff and Service : The staff is very cordial and the service is very quick. One of the staff members gave us Coca-Cola from which was not included in buffet.

To sum up Alfresco serves an extravagant buffet, and the cordial staff make the dining experience at this Luxury Hotel ecstatic.

Food - 5/5
Service - 5/5
Ambience - 5/5

Food~ Well at times when we dine at a 5 star we are more often than not unsatisfied with the food. But Alfresco is an exception. One of the finest 5 star dine in the city. The tomato basil soup was flavoursome. The mutton rogan josh was succulent and so was chicken butter masala, bursting with flavours.
Decor~ Nothing much to say if its a 5 star :) The ambiance was relaxing.
Service~ Very attentive and polite staff . Special mention for Chef Tiwari who personally comes up and exchanges a word or two regarding the food experience. Much appreciated.
Alfresco is a must must visit for a delightful fine dine.

It was time to try another 5 star buffet in Kolkata.
Alfresco however, truly disappointed me.
At a steep price, this buffet serves a lot less than other similar hotels like the Marriott.
The absence of Continental dishes was also very prominent.
The menu had a veg and a nonveg soup. The soup was absolutely dreadful to taste.
The veg section had Veg augratin which was very nice, a gravy dish which mainly had babycorn and an aubergine dish and a saag dish which were extremely generic and didnt taste well. There were two lentil items as well. The rice counter had sabz pulao, plain rice and chicken biryani.
They serve a veg and a nonveg starter at the table, which were very tasty.
The nonveg section was slightly better as the chicken roulade, the fish cooked in a south indian style and the lamb were rather nice. So was the chicken roast even though the servers had some issue carving it up.
The cold cuts counter and salad counter were at par.
There was a minty watermelon juice and a blueberry shake which was awesome with all the different toppings
The dessert counter had just 8-9 desserts which extremely less. There were a lot of desserts which were just for show.
Extremely disappointed with this buffet.

Went there with family fr buffet lunch. The welcoming was top notch. The main downside was the AC was not working where we got our seat, and it was a bit hot. Coming to the food, it's delicious. Each and every item on the menu was very tasty. From the starters, soup, to breads and biriyani - everything was very gd. The fish item was the show stealer for me. They also had a huge dessert section - from cake to sweets to tart and moose. They also served icecreams and cold drinks. Overall a great experience. Fine dining indeed!! :)

Probably you think BBQ Nation is unmatched when it comes to buffet but let me tell you will not be doing justice by comparing it with The Lalit. These star hotels are different, food wise yes but what standout is their service. Great effort by their server Mr Sanjib. He was exceptional throughout. Coming to Food would be their unlimited spread. Pretty much all in it. Would be visiting soon.

Visited Alfresco for lunch on 01.05.17, the day being my birthday.. Had high expectations.. But really had to sweat it out as the air conditioning was of poor quality.. Coming to the food.. Salads, starters and the desserts were good but the main course was pretty ordinary.. In spite of repeated complaints from the customers the establishment has not tried to make any amendments regarding the poor air-conditioning.. So think twice before going to have lunch at Alfresco in this sweltering heat..

বাঙালির বারো মাসে তেরো পার্বণ । আর তার সুত্রপাত বচ্ছরকার পয়লা দিন থেকেই । হালখাতার দিনে মিষ্টিমুখ , তার আলাদাই সুখ । আর বাড়িতে বসে রাজকীয় বাঙালি রান্নার সুঘ্রাণ , পরে পূর্ণ ভোজনের পালা । এমনই নতুন বছরের গন্ধলাগা এক দিনে ললিতে আয়োজিত হল স্বাদ পরীক্ষণের অনুষ্ঠান । পাঁচফোড়নের গর্বিত সদস্য হিসেবে সামিল হলাম আমিও । 

এমন সুন্দর দেকোর যে কোন হোটেলের সম্পদ । বিস্তৃত কাঁচের মহাল , সূর্যের আলোকছটায় ভেসে যাচ্ছে । বাইরে কৃত্রিম পুকুরে মাছেরা লাফাচ্ছে মনের আনন্দে । বাতাসে খাবারের গন্ধ !! আর কি চাই ?? 

খাবার শুরু হল পাঁচ মিশেলি ভাজা দিয়ে । বেগুন , পটল , কুমড়ো , পাঁপড় আর বড়ি । থালির মধ্যে বাসমতী চালের ভাত , শুক্তো , মোচার ঘণ্ট , পনির পাতুরি , পোলাও , মাটন কষা , কাঁকড়া কষা এবং এঁচোর চিংড়ি । শেষ পাতে মিষ্টির এলাহি আয়োজন । পাটিসাপটা , অমৃতি , রসগোল্লা , গুড়ের সন্দেশ , কোকোনাট চকলেট ব্রাউনি , রাইস ক্ষীর সন্দেশ , মালাই স্যান্ডুইচ । 

নববর্ষ নতুন এক জমকালো কায়দায় উদযাপন করতে চাইলে আর কি চাই ?? দরজা ঠেলে ঢুকে পড়ার অপেক্ষা টুকু ছাড়া ??

Naba Barsha is the celebration of Bengali New Year !! Naba Barsha in Bengal marks the first day of Baisakh - the first month of Bengali Calendar. The festival usually falls on the 13th or 14th day of April according to English Calendar Year. Naba Barsha festival is known as Poila Baisakh in West Bengal & Bangladesh.

For Bengalis, Naba Barsha is the beginning of all business activities. Businessmen and traders purchase new accounting books and start new account known as Haalkhata. People also worship Lord Ganesha by chanting mantras.

Naba Barsha celebrations are marked with joy, enthusiasm and hope. Songs, dance, games besides reciting of poems are organized in various parts of the West Bengal to mark the occasion. Enthusiastic people of Bengal also celebrate the eve of Naba Varsha as Chaitra-Sankranti and bid farewell to the past year.

Early in the morning of Naba Barsha, Bengalis take out processions known as Prabhat Pheries. To participate in Prabhat Pheris ladies clad themselves in traditional Bengali sari (white sari with red border) and flowers in hair while men wear dhoti kurta. The day is spent in feasting and participating in cultural activities. People also visit friends and dear ones to wish each other "Shubho Nabo Barsho !!"

Hotels and restaurants all across Kolkata launch their special Poila Boisakh menu  mainly Bengali cuisine.

We Panchphoron team went on a food tasting event in the eve of Bengali New year Menu launch.

Ambience - luxary ambience with milky interior, glass ceilings with an outdoor feel, sophistically decorated, and cozy seating arrangements.

Staffs & Service - Staffs are well trained and very courteous with good service and arrangements.

The special menu ( Thali ) consisted of the following - 

 1) Panch misali bhaja – Primary Bengali starter consisted  of begun bhaja,potol bhaja, kumro bhaja, papor bhaja & Bori bhaja. 

The special Thali comprised of Bash kati chaler bhat,Sobji diye sukto,Mochar ghonto, Paneer/ chanar paturi,Pulau,Mutton Kosha,Kakra Kosha,Echor chingri. Delicious desserts included Patisapta,Amriti,Rosogolla,Gurer sondesh,Coconut chocolate brownie,rice kheer sondesh,Malai sandwich, Aam Doi.

All the dish were yummy and well cooked, but my top picks are - 

1) Paneer/Chanar  Paturi - Chanar Paturi is an authentic Bengali recipe of paneer that is flavored with mustard, coconut and green chillies and steamed in pumpkin leaves. Paneer is called as Chanar in Bengali language. This recipe is a vegetarian adoption of popular Bengali fish recipe paturi, one of the royal dishes of Bengali cuisine. Pumpkin leaves wrapped parcels of mustard-coated paneer is steamed to make the delicious dish.The basic idea is to cook the paneer in a wilted pumpkin-leaf envelope. A must try .....!!

2) Mutton Kasha - This Spicy Bengali Mutton Curry aka Kosha Mangsho is a perfect lunch recipe that would be loved by all. Lick your fingers to Kosha Mangsho's velvety gravy and biting into the juicy pieces of the meat. Try this curry recipe made with mutton, potato, bay leaf, and yoghurt, this main dish recipe is a true delight.

3) Kakra Jhaal-  mouthwatering, spicy, chili curry, that will literally make you go down to your knees. Even we can skip the mutton for this crab curry. Its that much tasty and fiery.

3) Aam Doi - was thick , topped with dry fruits , and was heavenly.

4)Coconut Chocolate Brownie - a fusion dessert, was highly enjoyable and perfect for sweet lovers.

So what are you waiting for ?? 

Come here and enjoy the delicious Bengali dishes on any day or on any special occasion with your loved ones and relish.

Thanks to the management for their hospitality and warm reception and special thanks to Madhumita Di for her attention .

Pahela Baishakh (Bengali: পহেলা বৈশাখ) or Bengali New Year (Bengali: বাংলা নববর্ষ, Bangla Nôbobôrsho), also called Pohela Boishakh,is the traditional new year day of the Bengali people. It is celebrated on 14 April as a national holiday in Bangladesh, and on 14 or 15 April in the Indian states of West Bengal and Tripura and elsewhere by people of Bengali heritage, irrespective of their religious faith.

The festival date is set according to the lunisolar Bengali calendar as the first day of its first month Baishakh. It therefore almost always falls on or about 14 April every year on the Gregorian calendar.The same day is observed elsewhere as the traditional solar new year and a harvest festival by Hindus and Sikhs, and is known by other names such as Vaisakhi in central and north India, Vishu in Kerala and Puthandu in Tamil Nadu.

The festival is celebrated with processions, fairs and family time. The traditional greeting for Bengali New Year is শুভ নববর্ষ "Shubho Nabobarsho" which is literally "Happy New Year". The festive Mangal Shobhajatra is organized in Bangladesh. In 2016, the UNESCO declared this festivity organized by the Dhaka University as a cultural heritage of humanity.[9]

Location -  This is a legendary place located at Old court house street, Dalhousie Square , Esplanade , Kolkata.

Ambience - Amazing ambience with white interior, glass ceilings which gives an outdoor feel, soberly decorated, cozy seating arrangements and last but not the least it boasts impressive arrangements.

Staffs & Service - Staffs are extremely polite and service is prompt.

We Panchphoron group went for a food tasting event on the eve of Poila Boisakh menu launch, and they did serve authentic Bengali dishes, which are listed as follows - 

 1) Panch misali bhaja – consist with begun bhaja,potol bhaja and kumro bhaja as well as papor bhaja & very famous Bori bhaja. It tasted authentic and was well cooked.

For the thali section they have Bash kati chaler bhat,Sobji diye sukto,Mochar ghonto,Paneer paturi,Pulau,Mutton Kosha,Kakra Kosha,Echor chingri.

Last but not in the list delicious desserts like Patisapta,Amriti,Rosogolla,Gurer sondesh,Coconut chocolate brownie,rice kheer sondesh,Malai sandwich, Aam Doi.

All the dish were delicious and authentically cooked, but my top picks are - 

1) Paneer Paturi - Extremely soft, tasty and highly recommended.

2) Mutton Kasha - Was nicely cooked and was very tasty . The meat pieces were soft and gravy was very delicious.

3) Aam Doi - was highly enjoyable and pleasant.

4)Coconut Chocolate Brownie - a fusion dessert, was well made and very presentable and tasted heavenly.

If you’re planning where to go and where to eat on Poila Boisakh Eve or on any other day , come here to taste their grand and tasty Bengali menu with an amazing ambience. 

Thanks to the management for their hospitality and warm treatment and special thanks to Madhumita Di for her pleasant treatment.

A perfect blend of class and elegance. The place is soberly decorated with the glass ceilings, white interiors and the cozy seating arrangements providing it a classy look. We tried the dinner buffet and it was good. It had 2 starters , 3 main course rice dishes, 5 main course side dishes, 3 chinese sides, 1 chinese main and lots of desserts and fruits. The quality and taste both were perfect. The staff is extremely polite and helpful.

The place was quite beautiful and ideal for spending quality time with your near and dear ones. I had been to their buffet dinner, and i must say that the staff was way too courteous and polite. The spread was humongous too. The quality of food varied from dish to dish, but could have been better. But definitely worth revisiting.

Visited Alfresco for Holi special brunch.Food quality was very poor and spread was very limited .The service was amateurish and confused , with multiple servers who knew nothing.Most of the items were finished in the buffet.The Lalit seriously needs to revamp the quality and spread or re rate itself to a lower category.To top it all the valet damaged our A6 and conveniently did not inform.Will never visit again

Highly disappointed. One expects a top quality service and overall experience when you visit a place like this.. Being a vegetarian I was highly disappointed by the display of food.. The veg and non veg food was displayed all together and one had to go through every non veg dish to get the veg dishes. The floor manager and the support staff were hopeless and don't even have the basic ethics of asking before clearing the table.. I went to get a side dish and when I returned I saw my main plate was gone.. They don't even bother to ask before clearing the table. What a waste of food.. For deserts there was only 4 veg deserts and rest all the deserts were with egg with a red dot.. Hopeless..

Visited Alfresco on a lazy Sunday Evening. I had the buffet . 
In starters there was not much of options, 2 veg and 2 non-veg.
6 main courses was really delicious.  Loved the Cheese platter and the desserts.
Overwhelming service and the ambiance was up to the mark.
Overall it a great place to be.

Visited Alfresco on Valentine's day to try their special Valentine's dinner buffet. To start with, the ambience was amazing, the arrangements were really impressive. The food was good, they had loads of varieties, starting from cheese to turkey. They had provided two glasses of complimentary wine with unlimited mocktails. The food was good, staffs are well behaved. The dessert section was good but could have been better. But overall a very good experience.

Visited this place on Valentine's day, located at a very prime location. The white colored chairs n walls give the place an elegant look with a glass ceiling. Special mention are the services of the staffs and the quality of the food. Repeatedly the staffs were attending us, asking about the quality and serving warm foods. We tried the buffet lunch. The dessert section was full of different flavoured cakes, what we like the most: gur er payesh( can't help, being a bong) and a pot creme brulee.

** Location = BBD Bagh. The Great Eastern is a legendary place in Kolkata.

**Brief = I have been there on several occassions, the latest visit was with parents.

** Ambiance = The milk white decor and glass ceiling would give an outdoor feel. Very well attended by the servers and are very much cordial.

** Things Tried = Opted for the sunday brunch(lunch), the cheese omlettes, both veg and non veg starters were classic. Loved the strawberry drink. They have live sandwich, chaat and south indian counters. I gorged upon the fried chicken as well.
The dal was special and the lamb was tasty as well. A large variety of desserts and a dedicated counter for kids as well.
In short we loved the whole spread :)

** Purse Check = Rs.6,300/- for 3 to be precise.

** Overall = A classic place that lives up to its expectations. Keep it up Great Eastern

Went for the lunch buffet with family. Overall a decent outing, but considering the brand and reputation of Lalit Great Eastern, I must admit that it was not that great.
1) Ambiance - excellent decor all in pristine white
2) Service - again excellent. Here I must mention of Sayantan for his attention and prompt service
3) Food - here the disappointment starts. First the menu - it's predominantly Indian with limited choices. Starters were served on table and we never knew what to expect. Cold cuts (only Chicken Salami & Fish roulade) were Ok type, but no ham/ bacon. Choice of cheese was limited too. In main course, it was Indian all the way and that too pretty ordinary. There was a a Chicken Pulao (Bangladeshi style), which was average. Then, a south Indian chicken dish, which was poor. The mutton dish was ordinary too with too much use of tomato. The grilled Basa fish was perhaps the best thing available in the entire buffet. In desserts, chocolate cake and Mango Lassi  were good. 

Overall, decent value for money considering it costs less than 1000 per head. But nothing great about it.

This is a multi cuisine restaurant at the Lalit Great Eastern good for breakfast buffet and dinner buffet.

The breakfast spread is simply outstanding. Huge spread of pastries, South Indian, Gujarati, North Indian, Oriental, English and Continental. breakfasts. Live egg station and a variety of dosa on request. Drinks include but are not limited to Teas, coffees, juices, shakes, Lassi, tender coconut water.  
Dinner buffet is good as well but consists of mainly Indian cuisine with a lamb, chicken and fish curries with biryani rice, a nice tandoori basa carving, and a variety of Indian vegetarian dishes along with non veg and veg kebabs for starters. The only peeve would be a lack of continental and Oriental dishes and no pizza for the kids. Would be nice if the management installs a pizza oven as almost all hotels now serve a good wood fired pizza. 

Overall this is a good hotel restaurant with accommodating staff and I would not hesitate to visit here again.

Ok, so my customary little birthday party, and this time we chose The Lalit Great Eastern. We went without prior reservation to Alfresco, having already decided what we would have with the help of Zomato, but we reached only to find Alfresco was booked for an event and were told to eat at The Legacy Grill on the second floor.

At The Legacy Grill, while we were busy selecting the food from the menu, the attendant came up to us and said they could offer us the Alfresco menu up there in case we wanted it. That was a touch of class!! We accepted immediately, since we had already made up our mind on what to eat, and this unexpected menu was not what we wanted.

So we ordered Alfresco food, while sitting at a different place, that it The Legacy Grill. We ordered the Mutton Tikia Kabab for starters, and that was the best thing we had that night. Minced, and not overly spicy, so soft that it melts in the mouth, served with some standard green chutney. For mains, we had the Chicken a la Kiev, and Pan seared Norwegian Salmon. The a la Kiev was good, but to be honest, the one served at Mocambo is a tad bit better.

This was the first time I had Salmon, and so I am not sure how much justification they could do to the dish, but I liked what I had. Finally we had the Bakery Pastry Platter, which was an assortment of 3 pastries from their bakery. Don't know the individual names, but tasted good.

Having grown up on literary fare largely comprising British classics, it's unsurprising that I grew up loving all things Brit. And what fascinated me immensely was that meal - nay, that social event - that hungry children and aristocrats alike hastened to gather together for. In other words, afternoon tea. A holiday in England being a lamentably remote possibility, I was thrilled when I found out that the Lalit dishes up a version of afternoon tea that is apparently rated highly by food critics. So of course, I had to go. My parents, while not wannabe Anglophiles like me, were by no means reluctant to have a chance to gorge on cakes of all description. 
We ordered two, a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian option, correctly guessing that that would be enough food for three people. The teas took a little while to appear, but then did so on the three-tiered cake stands beloved of fiction, and I perked up with excitement. For each tea there was an assortment of breads, cakes, pastries and cookies, along with three kinds of sandwiches. We duly helped ourselves. 
I'll start with the good part. There was a plain tea cake that was rich and sweet, and was even better when enhanced with butter (we had to ask for butter separately, though). The mini croissant was good too. The non-vegetarian option featured a very tasty chicken puff I wish there were more of, and the cookies were basically plain ladyfingers and chocolate biscuits that tasted good with tea. There was also a rich creamy pastry of sorts that I liked. 
Now the not-so-good part. The other two sandwiches on the non-vegetarian plate were quite poor in quality. One contained Norwegian smoked salmon which I took one whiff of only to realise that it was stale. Yes, stale. Spoilt. Needless to say, I stayed away like it was the plague. There was a fruit cake that I found quite dry, though my mother liked it. My biggest peeve was the tea itself. Afternoon tea is not complete without a big, boiling hot pot of strong tea that is replenished at frequent intervals. What we got were three teacups of lukewarm, bland tea. And on asking, we were informed that ordering more tea would involve an extra charge. Excuse me? And here I had read a food blog that spoke enthusiastically of how the critic was allowed to sample and select her own variety of tea! No sign of that here - we got teabags that created a brew that was nondescript to say the least! And - last but not least - everything on the cake stand seemed somehow...fusty. As though they had been prepared years ago and were only being dished up now. Very, very unlike the freshness and delight of a true afternoon tea. 
I wouldn't recommend this option for anyone. In fact, I think they have removed it from the menu, as I don't see it online. You are far better off ordering cakes and beverages of your choice a la carte. At least those are likelier to be fresh. And for afternoon tea - well, go to England, where they do it best.

Having heard so much about the recently opened Lalit in Kolkata I decided to check it out for lunch. I booked myself a table on nearby and got what I think was a fairly good deal. Happy I set off for this place expecting a festive atmosphere as it was just 4 days to Christmas. But was quite surprised at the so so subdued atmosphere bordering on dullness at this time of the year. Anyway eagerly I approached the buffet area. The first impression was quite ok, the all white facade and interiors give a feeling of space and lightness and the waterbody alongside the buffet area is very pleasing. As far as the food goes, the buffet was not very elaborate. The cheese section was best avoided. The soups were tasty and wholesome and the starters were few but good. The food on the whole was ok, nothing to really go wow about. The Bengali sweets were a total disappointment but the western sweets were good, as expected from a good hotel in Kolkata. The service I would say should be improved, as I had to repeatedly ask for the used dishes to be cleared from the table and my request for the fish to be warmed. On the whole a mediocre experience.

Went for the dinner last Saturday. We opted for their buffet thanks to nearby vouchers where I could get @999 per person. Coming to food , they had two soups and wide varieties of bread to start with. Loved the soup (chicken corn soup) and breads which was butter toasted was really yummy to begin. Starters was served on table which was of 5 types. Starters was okay nothing to boast about. Coming to main course it was huge on display. I tried to taste each of them little bit still missed many. Lamb curry was one of the best i tasted lately. Main course each and every item was top notch. Deserts were okay. I expected ice cream which was missing. They had 2 welcome drinks which had mojito and mixed fruit shake which refreshing. All in all if you are not too much craving for kebabs and want a fine dining experience you can opt for this. Recommended for special occasions with special one. Ambience is very much romantic and you get a fine dining luxurious experience.

Well what do you say when you visit a great and heritage hotel recently opened to public..one which you've only heard from your parents..but never got the chance to visit?

Food: We hadn't tried the buffet since it was the same old..same old. A la carte was the decision. 
Fish and chips: Cooked and fried to near perfection. Tasty and worth having.
Norwegian salmon: This was a surprise package. I can't stress how well they had steamed and smoked the salmon...and this is from a person who hates fish. It is definitely a must try. 

Expense: Very..but then this isn't your regular "theka". This IS the Great Eastern...so be wary of thinking of giving a treat here.

Verdict: Must visit for anyone looking to splurge a little on good Continental food.

Durga Puja these days has become synonymous to having great food, pandal hopping and having a good time with friends, family and loved ones. It is one such occasion which a Bengali looks forward to, waits and plans for all through out the year. So, it is quite natural that we want the best to happen during these few days, especially when it comes to food. This is one occasion when the overdose of footfall ruins the quality of service and food even in most of the renowned restaurants, so surely you must be looking for some place which is not affected even by this mad rush. At least I am very concerned about this all the while, I surely want to have some great dining experience on such special days. So, here is one such place which can assure you premium service and great food quality even during these Puja days, they are none other than the iconic Lalit Great Eastern Hotel. In fact, they are all set to tickle your taste buds with some awesome Puja special menu. I was invited at their Durga Puja Menu launch along with other Panchphoron food bloggers at Alfresco, their restaurant, which introduced me to their lavish buffet spread that had loads of uniqueness and oomph to bring you to this grandiose hotel just opposite the Raj Bhavan. The amazing majestic structure of the property surely will impress you and pamper you beyond the extent you can imagine. The Alfresco at Lalit Great Eastern has out of the world pristine white interiors with diffused natural sunlight kissing down the guests and patrons while they are engrossed in enjoying the lavish buffet spread. This buffet will be there during the Durga Puja days starting from Shasthi, so there is really no reason to think twice before pampering your taste buds and giving them the treat they deserve! Also, not to forget during these days there will be live band playing at their premises, so that gives you an additional reason to visit this amazing place.

We purchased vouchers from nearbuy for the unlimited Shashti buffet lunch. The lunch was meant to be at Alfresco but upon reaching the Lalit we were escorted out to the bakery and told that the bakery is where the pujo Mahaboj was being served. That was strange.

The spread was varied in the menu on nearbuy.
We were welcomed with a sweet yogurt drink. The menu promised gondhoraj ghol and unlimited mocktails however only the sweet yogurt drink was served and upon asking we were told that that's the only thing available. So that was uncalled for and disappointing. We had to ask for cola even though it was mentioned in the menu. The starter was a fish patisapta and tasted good. Moving on to the main course, there were a variety of bengali dishes like chorchori, chingri, mangsher jhol, dhokar dalna, radhaballavi, chholar dal etc. However, the food was barely warm and wpuld have tasted better had it been warmer.
The highlight was the parshe aam kashundi, which was a tangy parshe dish with fragrant mustard sauce. We were expecting chingri malai curry but it was a different preparation with water lilly. Desserts were good and I especially loved the baked nolen gur yogurt. There were two live counters, for pasta and crepes. The menu also promised 3 non veg salads but I only saw veg salads There was a live baul performance going on when we entered which added an extra touch to the pujo ambiance.
The servers did their job well and were very welcoming.
We had an intimate magician Prince Shil come to our table and show us some amazing magic tricks and it was a good experience interacting with him.
Even though we had a good meal, we had gone in expecting more, as promised in the menu.

If you are looking for that breathtaking and cozy ambiance, where every details is strategically artistic and aesthetically appealing then you have to land in Alfresco. Its the multicuisine 24x7 outlet of The Lalit. Wine served with cheese was how its supposed to be. The braised lamb is served with any 2 choices of side orders. We ordered sauteed mushrooms n steamed rice on the side. Fish n chips was another classic of my choice. To grade the food, guess I tasted better fish n chips! The fish wasnt juicy rather a bit on the dry side. To match the price and the food, guess I expected something better. The only thing that i loved about the whole meal was the dessert. The panna cotta was garnished with finesse and taste equally good. It delighted my taste buds!

​Alfresco – The Lalit Great Eastern is ready to celebrate Durga Pujo with their customers in a grand way. This year, Alfresco, has come up with a lavish buffet spread. The menu is unique and diverse. The Bengali spread includes authentic dishes like Sapla Chingrir ghonto, Phulkopir paturi, parser aam kasundi, Goalondo steamer mangshor jhol, Murshidabadi chicken biryani, etc. Apart from the Bengali dishes, the buffet menu isn’t devoid of their regular Tangra style Chinese and Mughlai ( Pillars of Bengal ). There’s also a wide variety of salads, breads and desserts that would make you cherish your meal.

Recently I was invited to the launch of Puja Special menu at Alfresco, the all day multi cuisine diner. Located at the ground level of the hotel behind the reception this is one fine dining restaurants I’d absolutely look forward to visiting again & I’m not even talking about the food. The restaurant overlooks the carefully maintained lilypool which is magnificent to look at as you enjoy your meal. Add to that the charm of the glass tiled ceiling which lets in the natural light during the day & night. The whole place is bathed in white, the woven cane tables & couches with white leather seats et all. The buffet & live counters are done in black granite giving it a stark reflection. The ambience is sober & nothing loud & feels like a place to have your quiet lunch. For the Surface Puja Celebrations, the restaurant has been decorated with some traditional ghot (painted earthen pots) & chandmalas (traditional Puja decorations) but nothing over the top.

As we are set to welcome Maa Durga withing few days, Kolkata's fine dines are also set to welcome us with Bong food and Alfresco - The Lalit Great Eastern
 is no exception. I was invited by the management to sample the Durga Puja special menu and there are so many choices and I am kind of confused what to list and what not to pick from the buffet menu that The Lalit Great Eastern Kolkata is coming up with this Puja...However "Phulkopir Paturi", "Murshidabadi Chicken Biriyani", "Goalondo Mutton Curry" and "Kasundi Parshe" are just to name a few from the Bong buffet menu that will available all through Durga puja and the best part is they are having a midnight buffet as well at a moderate cost of 999 per person though the rate is on the higher side for lunch! 
I am however not much commenting on the ambience of the place given Great Eastern is known for the classic decor and classy ambience!

Very poor service..there are 10 people dining in the restaurant & it took them 30mins to serve starters..we were so hungry waiting for starters that we went ahead with the main course..disgusting for such a high end restaurant..I had finished with the main course when the Nan arrived just in time for dessert..
Only positive was the dessert..the Belgian pastry was exquisite..

Had been there today with my son. Both foodies. Loved the food there. We were targeting continental. Hence, the buffet had no appeal to us. Lovely food - exactly done as it should have been. 
Will go there again during Pujas with the rest of my family .

Recently I was invited to the launch of Puja Special menu at Alfresco, the all day multi cuisine diner. Located at the ground level of the hotel behind the reception this is one fine dining restaurants I’d absolutely look forward to visiting again & I’m not even talking about the food. The restaurant overlooks the carefully maintained lilypool which is magnificent to look at as you enjoy your meal. Add to that the charm of the glass tiled ceiling which lets in the natural light during the day & night. The whole place is bathed in white, the woven cane tables & couches with white leather seats et all. The buffet & live counters are done in black granite giving it a stark reflection. The ambience is sober & nothing loud & feels like a place to have your quiet lunch. For the Surface Puja Celebrations, the restaurant has been decorated with some traditional ghot (painted earthen pots) & chandmalas (traditional Puja decorations) but nothing over the top.
                                          ...

As we are set to welcome Maa Durga withing few days, Kolkata's fine dines are also set to welcome us with Bong food and Alfresco - The Lalit Great Eastern
 is no exception. I was invited by the management to sample the Durga Puja special menu and there are so many choices and I am kind of confused what to list and what not to pick from the buffet menu that The Lalit Great Eastern Kolkata is coming up with this Puja...However "Phulkopir Paturi", "Murshidabadi Chicken Biriyani", "Goalondo Mutton Curry" and "Kasundi Parshe" are just to name a few from the Bong buffet menu that will available all through Durga puja and the best part is they are having a midnight buffet as well at a moderate cost of 999 per person though the rate is on the higher side for lunch! 
I am however not much commenting on the ambience of the place given Great Eastern is known for the classic decor and classy ambience!

Very poor service..there are 10 people dining in the restaurant & it took them 30mins to serve starters..we were so hungry waiting for starters that we went ahead with the main course..disgusting for such a high end restaurant..I had finished with the main course when the Nan arrived just in time for dessert..
Only positive was the dessert..the Belgian pastry was exquisite..

I visited the place for sunday brunch. The ambience and decor are what you can expect from a reputed hotel.
The starters were brought to our table. There were potato and cheese croquettes, veg shami kabab, a fish and a chicken starter. The starters were good and quite enjoyable.
For the brunch, they had a live dosa counter, sandwich counter, chat counter, pasta counter, salad bar, cheese board, juice corner and roast corner along with the main course. The food was good and enjoyable. 
The one sore point is their sloppy service. They need to improve their service if they are to make a name for themselves.

A Buffet Lunch at an iconic place like The Great Eastern Hotel is an event in itself.
The Alfresco is situated on the ground floor and has a glass roof-top. It was a bit bothering that the afternoon sun was tearing through the glass roof-top making it uncomfortable to sit despite the AC running. So had to change seats for a shadowy place.
The Buffet was a good mix of Indian & Continental varieties of food. However, unlike some other top buffets, this did not include too many starters; there were just 4 varieties ( 2 veg & 2 Non-veg). However, the variety of Snacks ( read Chaats), Salads, Main Courses and Desserts was too good. 
The cost is high considering the importance of the place; However, the buffet is certainly not worth repeating because there are much better Buffet options at the same price.

I was at this place on 24th August along with my wife for lunch. Although this place is just 100 meters from my office I never tried or thought of trying but on my wife's suggestion I gave it a try and I was quiet impressed. The decor , the ambience , the staff and the food ... Just awesome. One of the best places in Kolkata I would say.keep it up

Went on regular buffet on Nearbuy coupon,costed 845 each. Only two starters is a low point. Rest of the spread is good,the cheese and cold cuts on a lunch buffet were new things to try. Was too lazy to make a sandwich. Main course was okay. Desserts were many and delicious,missed ice cream though. Hospitality is good.

The ambience is really good and the food at the price point is just about ok . Would not rate it very high .
I went there on a sunday brunch on a GroupOn coupon ( highly recommend you do the same ) . 
The service is not that great , neither is the spread of the dishes in the menu . Very confusing way of laying out the items . Not a lot of variety but the food is tasty. 
Generally you have the bearers attending to you during the course of the meal . Not the case here . Constantly having to remind them of our presence was a tad disappointing . 
But i would have expected much more out of the jewel of calcutta . Can do much better .

I went there on valentines day with my husband, we had planned a candel light dinner out there. They gave us the best tabel. Its a five star hotel and ineed have all its qualities in terms of ambience, employees behavior, food and even the price 😉. They offered us the buffet food but as i asked for jain food which i mentioned previously while booking the hotel, they made whope new preparatiin for me. The chef was extremely courteous, i m very pleased with the staff behaviour. Jain food we had palak kebab, vegetable soup in starter. Then we had lacha paratha, dal makhni, aalo posto in dinner followed by rasgulla and brownie. Food is suberb.

Somehow I’ve seen there are two types of people who crave for Ramzan food. The first type who flocks out to Chitpur and gorge on the street Haleem, bakarkhani and what not….. and the second variety (and much much larger a number), who craves for the ramzan haleem (among other items) but does not venture out with on streets due to hygienic reasons. But this post is solely dedicated for the second variety – an iftar party in one of Kolkata’s finest hotels, The Lalit Great Eastern- in its Alfresco outlet.

We were invited to the Alfresco, the beautiful ground-floor outlet at The Lalit Great Eastern for their iftar menu launch. Starting now, it’ll be held every friday 6 PM onwards for June and July. Moderately priced at 1550/- per head for a gala spread, its definitely worth a try. Behold and we’ll gorge in the details shortly.

There’s no use describing the ambience of a 5 star hotel. Its basically almost the same everywhere. Posh, suave, subtle- waiters are well-mannered and ready to help. The moment we entered, we saw a nice sit-out with some interesting live counters.

As we settled down, we were served on table the usual deep-fried items (which are used to break the fast) which consisted of Dal bara, Egg-devil, mini mutton chop, piyazi and cumin-flavored aloo-chop. Being a religiously non-veg bong, I skipped most of them, but the ones which were tasted, were great.

We went for the soup counter and happily discovered my favorite one, Yakhni mutton shorba. This is one particularl mild, subtle version of mutton soup cooked with the juice from mutton shanks- here it also had mini mutton moti (small mutton balls) dipped in it. “The evening is going to be well” I said to myself.

For the live counters, the first one was having Mutton-Ghugni and pau-bhaji and the adjacent counter was having 2 types of haleem- Mutton and veg. “Veg-haleem ? Never heard of them…” And I freaked out (how wrong was I). We got our portions of each of the items (just I personally skipped the bhaji part and only opted for the pau). It was being heated and was sprinkled with chopped coriander, fried onion, lemon wedges and fried nuts and lots of ghee.

The haleem is great (a little sticky) and the meat paste was brilliantly cooked with different dals, wheat and barley. Many a sad souls, who’re deprived of haleem during this period due to hygienic reason, rush for this. Its brilliant. A little spicy than the usual stuff that we’re used to, I loved it. But the revelation was Ghugni with solid mutton chunks. Paired with Pau, its pure heaven….

Next was Keema-pau. A slightly less-flavored dry mutton-keema paired with butter-fried pau- liked it.

After the good-start, we went for the main course. Now, let me clarify one thing. There was a nicely laid spread of many a things, but I concentrated only on the non-veg items and desserts. Hence, won’t be able to comment much on other items. Even having so many items for one person, is an extremely difficult task.

Frankly, I was expecting a biryani in the main course- any sort. But, here it was different. They made a khichda with chunks of mutton and I can’t say how happy I was. This made my day and happily just the next item was Baghara baigan. Now, for the lesser-known mortals, baghara baigan is one heavily spicy til and tamarind flavored dish with whole baby-brinjals. Both made a great pair. The third item was mutton balls cooked in herb-flavored tomato gravy- personally which I didn’t like.

The set of items consisted of mutton nihari and dry-fruit-stuffed paneer roll cooked in saffron gravy. This thing I could not understand. As per my knowledge, nihari was a breakfast dish and not a dinner item. But, a good mutton dish is welcome any time of the day and we gladly went for it. The nihari is slightly thick in texture (unlike the variety we normally see during winter breakfast). It was extremely tasty when paired with some naan. 

The paneer item was surprisingly subtle. Finely chopped dry-nut stuffed paneer roll was cooked in saffron flavored mild gravy, which gave our palette a welcoming rest from the spicy meat dishes.

We were full but on the chef’s special recommendation, we had veg-haleem coocked with soyabean keema. It was brilliant to say the least. A must-try and a definite recommendation.

Now, was time for the dessert counter. This spread was the best thing that happened to us in the whole evening. All the regular items were present like the anjeer ki halwa, khubani kameetha, semiya, phirnee and THE baklava. “Baklava in Kolkata ?” I jumped on it. And it definitely did not disappoint me. The baklava they made here is of roll-shaped, stuffed with dry fruits as usual and was good. The anjeer-ki halwa was heavy and royally smeared with ghee, wherein the khubani ka meetha was slightly tangy in nature- enjoyable.

We were full- and that too to the heart’s content. And its time to take the mandatory group photo and bid a good-bye.

We went there with a lot of expectations for a Buffet Lunch at Alfresco. The first disappointment was that, I booked a table for 3 person over phone, But after reaching there the staff told us that No reservation was found. They also informed that this was not a problem as most of the tables were available. After that they gave us a table. The decoration and ambience were really nice. The behaviour of stuff was really good.
Now coming to the food.
At first they served 1 veg and 1 Non veg starter. Both the starter was not good. Fish starter was very bad. Veg starter was just okay.
They served the starters on the table. Rest of the items were on the buffet. Even the Mocktails/ juices were on the buffet. 
Next I tried their Chicken clear soup which was very plain with big pieces of chicken. Chat counter and sandwich were also present which I didn't try.
There were also two types of juices present. One was mixed fruit juice and another strawberry shake. Only the strawberry shake was tasty. There were also present different types of cheeses. In Main Course they had Chicken Biryani, jeera rice with one chicken dish, one lamb dish, and one fish dish. The taste of the main course was below average. None of the items were tasty. The lamb was not boiled properly. Fish is worst. In veg they had a Paneer dish along with other vegetable dishes. I tried only their Paneer dish which was not good. The food was just average. Nothing special which I expected from a five star.
In Dessert they had some Indian sweets with fruits and Brownie and small pastries along with a hot Dessert.
Only the Desserts were tasty and good.
Conclusion : Normally the buffet cost 1300+ tax. We had nearbuy vouchers which cost Rs 849 per head.
But it's really not worth it. The Buffet is below average. Other than the food everything was okay from service to ambience. Lots of improvement needed specially in starter and Main Course.

The staff is courteous and the food is awesome. They have a large spread with multiple items. Their cheesecake was simply out of the the world. I had been there on my mother's birthday and was quite impressed. Good one would recommend this place to others.
I loved this place and keep going back whenever I can. In fact for most family dinners and lunch I prefer this place over others. The smorgasbord of dishes, quick and efficient service, the ambience (though during lunch hours if it gets a little too sunny it becomes uncomfortable, but the staff is helpful they draw the blinds when told). Overall I love this place.

I have always believed that memories and associations play a great role in our choice of food. My earliest years and fond memories are of my maternal Grandparent’s home in Dharamtolla Street where the call of the muezzins would herald daybreak and Eid would mean standing on the balcony of their home looking down at the devout in their prayers and for a child it was a fascinating canvas. This child was also however a foodie and Ramzan would mean daily treats of the delicious Pakoras of all kinds or if we were lucky the highly prized Mutton Pati Samosa that we would gobble down with glasses of Khus Sherbet. On other occasions came the Haleem which was devoured with equal gusto.
                                                                ...

I fell in love with this place the moment I'd hopped in for lunch. The charming classy ambiance and welcoming staff were enough to melt my heart. This multicuisine eatery known for its presentation and quality food serves not only Italian but also international, ethnic and regional specialities and even comes up with an alluring Poila Boishakh menu. They also offer a kids' menu.

We lunched on classic Caesar salad - with iceberg lettuce, turkey bites, garlic croutons, caesar dressing with shaved parmigiano reggiano - and smoked salmon with caper berry, lettuce heart and chive cream cheese  for the appetizer; followed by braised lamb shank served with crispy potato wedges and pan-seared polenta, with choice of sauce which for us I think had been thyme and garlic sauteed mushroom; the iconic fish-and-chips - served with tartar sauce, french fries and onion rings - in the mains, topping it up with vanilla bean panna cotta which is a velvety creme anglaise and peppered banana, and chocolate terrine made of sesame, matcha green tea, apricot compote, and signature Belgian dark chocolate mousse for dessert.

The food were excellent, and superbly prepared and presented. If you fancy some good food without worrying about pinch in the pocket, then head straight to Alfresco, which literally means in the open air.

Went there with my parents for lunch buffet as part of their anniversary gift. I loved the place, can rate it perfect 5 just for the amazing layout,ambience and super polite service. Food as expected was good. I was not impressed by the starters though idli Manchurian n egg pakora.the wide range of salads n main courses made up for it. The desserts were lipsmacking. Didn't enjoy the live pizza station as well. The simple n elegant furnishing, white decor,  glass roof, and the pool just outside the glass wall makes it a perfect place for a very romantic first date. ;)

First of all good food. Couple of times had to search for a service guy but nothing very serious as you will get someone within a min to two wait. Decor is of course very good. I remember a very old Great Eastern when I was a kid and went with my dad. The nostalgia remains. Had buffet dinner with my family and all of us enjoyed the outing.

The best buffet I ever tasted.  Well , today on ds rainy afternoon went for lunch our there. Basically m in love with the place, its ambience, its decor, the music, everything! The glass rooftop is the special attraction of Alfresco. Luckily as it was raining so we were actually comfortable or else in the summer days it would be difficult sitting under the glass roof top! Anyways now coming to the food! The buffet was huge. I couldn't taste all of them or else could have burst out 😂! For the staters we only had tasted  veg shammi kabab and peri peri chicken and some papri chat . In the main courses we tried Rajasthani basmati rice, fish steak, Chicken biriyani, and a chicken and a lamb preparation. There were also counters for veg items. For the dessert, we tasted a misti, rice kheer and some watermelon. All tasted fantastic. Loved the day out. Servers were also very humble. Thumbs up for the place! Love to visit again!

But as the rooftop is made of glass so during summer it's bit difficult and locating this place was bit difficult too. Otherwise I loved it.

We wen there on Holi with lot of expectations. The buffet spread was good and the staff was attentive. What shocked us was the lack of attention towards hygiene. We found a strand of hair in a mutton dish and one of the glasses in which a desert was serves had a crack right across. Though they tried making it up with two complimentary pastries, but we felt that such lapses were unacceptable.

Loved their Sunday Brunch spread. 

While the main course mainly spans the flavours of North Indian cuisine, there is no dearth of options in the form of Hakka Noodles, vegetables in spicy sauce and several DIY counters across the length of the restaurant.

The ‘make your own chat’ counter was appetizing with several options of what you choose to do with the spicy chutneys. I made myself a small portion of papri chat, and relished the spicy concoction all by myself.

Mexican is my favourite cuisine, second only to dhaba food. And this spread drew on a delicacy from the Mexican best. A live counter for grilled tortillas had me salivating as I picked the pepper, jalapenos and beans to fill it.

They bring in Cheese Nuggets and Paneer Tikka – steaming hot from the magic kitchens if you though the spread of cold cuts, salads, finger food et al weren’t enough.

Had high expectations for this place. It takes real guts to go to a place which has been receiving horrible reviews for sometime now. We had a little hope but that got washed away too.
The demeanor of the staff puts you off in the first instance, followed by the drab service when you ask for help.
The live dessert counter was left unattended!
The Indian preparations were pretty basic and nothing seemed to stand out. The carving station housed a huge chunk of Bassa fillet (all cold and hardened), and no one was present to help us 'carve' it out too!

Options options options.... U r completely spoilt for Options here! There is SO MUCH variety u don't know what to eat :)
Good taste, total value for money if u have TIME to sit and relish the food. I won't even start on the starters and salads! Had to go easy on those to leave space for the food. The desserts.. Mama Mia! A definite recommendation, if u are a good eater and have time to sit and spend time enjoying everything!

Don't know where to start from - food or service. You bet you won't get worse food anywhere in this world or for that matter feel like a beggar for both food and service. Staff are too untrained and slow, body language puts you off at the first instance. 

Suggest - don't order anything, fresh line soda came after shouting on the waiter. Papads came after deserts, you can imagine how serious they are about having guests. 

Request the management to call me instead of replying to this message, would like to slap some complains on their face directly. 

After visiting Taj or hyatt and ITC, this place is no more than a road side joint.

Seriously AVOID!!! 
Insanely PATHETIC!!!
Depressing MENU!!!

Oh yes!!! Change your chef guys!!!

Alfresco is a nice all day dining cafe that has a top notch feel to it but a bit pricey.

Located in the Lalit great eastern hotel, cafe has a nice and elegant decor. Glass roof adds a premium feel to it. The staff service is decent but could improve. Menu is extensive but a bit pricey.

Coming to food I tried their buffet in my last visit and it was great. Cheese was nice and fresh, juices were available to drink. Preplated salads were average though. Sandwiches and chaats were also available that tasted good. I just loved their north Indian main course that was superb. Daal as well as paneer makhani were exceptional. There were no pasta preparation on menu which felt weird. Oriental spread was limited but well made. Desserts were decent. Buffet was great but could be exceptional for a few changes.

Overall I love this place but at the same time I feel their service needs to improve.

Located at corner of busy BBD Bagh area - a challenge to find the entrance inside a narrow lane.

Went for lunch. The place looks good - interiors are posh & exquisite, but the food was average considering the fact that it's a renowned place. Average service.

Presentation was tempting for everyone but as they say never judge a book by its cover.  They lack variety in main course for vegetarians. In starters somehow liked Papri chaat and salad counter will definitely drag your attention. In main course, there were 4-5 varieties of veg dishes. Service is very slow. Things in totality are no way closer to 5 star standards.

For buffet price of around Rs. 1700, lots of improvement is expected from them, especially on kind of dish and taste they are serving in spread. 

Not recommended if you are a food lover. 
Will recommend to take historical tour of the hotel.

It was my bday nd we went to alfresco for lunch. We opted for the buffet which was mainly an indian spread. I didnt like the food so much. The ambience and the staff were very good. Buffet costed us 1300+taxes. Not fairly priced but if you want a 5star ambience then its a good choice. Their pool side in the 1st floor is a very nice place for taking pictures. Overall a descent place but not recommended if u r a food lover.

ok lets see - New Year? Check, Special Family Dinner? Check, Legendary Star Hotel? Check, New and improved? Check, Highly recommended by friends and colleagues? Check - That was the checklist used to be at this nostalgic place. Once a legend in the city which has lost its charm has came back with a bang, thoroughly new and improved. The interior is superbly decorated and at par with any Big brand chain of hotels. The buffet spread was large and never ending. If I am not mistaken then approx from salad to dessert there was around 40 items. Great collection of exotic salads to begin with and appetizers served at table till your fill. Special mention of two fish items, one basa tandoori and the other steamed fish was terribly awesomely good. Apart from that mutton this and that, chicken this and that was also very good. Special mention of mutton biriyani -succulent and aromatic. All in all every item is worth trying. But the best part was the dessert which was expected as Great Eastern has a legendary bakery history. The spread had chocolate mousse, cheese cake, double chocolate cake, sor bhaja, rossogolla, kesar payesh, tart and fresh fruits and few more hanky panky pastry and sweets. Thoroughly enjoyed a great new year evening with family comprising a sumptuous dinner, an exotic ambiance and gala chit chat. On a closing note, pocket pinch Rs 2000 per head approx.

Very nice restaurant. Although when we reached they had a regular brunch happening, we asked for they chef and requested him to prepare us a authentic Bengali spread. He got us betki macher jhol, jinge aloo posto, Bengali daal and ghee rice which was amazing. Then he got us misti doi on the house ... Lovely and was so inexpensive . Just 4000 for 2 people.

Full 5 stars to them for their breakfast buffet not for the variety (have seen much more expansive laid out buffet spreads), but for the service experience and the delicious spread. The sambhar is one of the best that I have ever tasted, so is the coconut chutney with just the right amount of green chilies. All this coupled with the idli variations everyday and the vada/ dosa are terrific. The cheese omelette is just perfect with enough gooey cheese filled inside. Makes a smashing combination with the heated soft plain croissant baked perfectly. They have a lot of pastries available but am not the sweet inclined types so did not try. The masala tea with the omelette & croissant is just heavenly. The paranthas are average though.

Though after complaining they tried to make up for the services and improved by giving total thorough attention..but the bottom line is I was not at all happy with the experience.. Disappointed

A little expensive, but that is understandable considering this restaurant is in a 5 star hotel. However, the portion size of the pasta that we ordered was significant and it was actually sufficient for two people fighting the midnight hunger pangs. One disappointment however was that they did not serve any liquor past 11pm even though the restaurant is open 24/7. A pint of beer would have be nice :)

After having a sumptuous breakfast in lalit Bangalore, I decided to visit the much hyped lalit Great Eastern in Kolkata with my parents. I chose alfresco to taste their various spreads and arguably alfresco is termed as the best restaurant of Great Eastern.
Again we went for a breakfast only and everyone along with me was surprised to see the variety of food served as part of buffet. It was bigger and better than that of lalit Bangalore.
The staffs were courteous enough and provided prompt service whenever requested for anything. The ambience was a real delight. Creamy white interiors with little sunlight allowed to come in was the mood setter. Staff and ambience truly deserve 5/5.
Now let's talk about food. Around 10-12 noon veg items, 15-16 veg items, variety of juice, curd, lassi, cereals, fruits, Kolkata style radha ballavi aloo dum were a part of the spread. A nice surprise was the inclusion of Gujarati items as well. The variety of food is the biggest I have ever seen. And every item was cooked to perfection and left us with no choice but to appreciate them. Food variety 5/5, quality 5/5.
I recommend this restaurant to every food lover.

I went to this restaurant on 14/10/2015. I had a Groupon coupon for buffet lunch by which I got a discount of 50%. I booked a table for two through phone which was well attended. When we entered the hotel we were well escorted from the entry gate of hotel to our table. 
The first thing that catches your eyes as you enter the restaurant is its ambience. It has a glass wall and glass roof. I can just imagine how romantic this place would be if its raining.
Coming to food.. In starters.. They served crispy chili babycorn.. It was very good.. I asked them for extra veg starter as I am pure vegetarian.. They simply denied.. Which I found strange.. As most of the restaurants do give..
Soup.. Bell pepper sour.. Tasted gud.. It had high flavours.. It was hitting on my throat.. But liked it.. There were varieties of bread rolls served with soup.. There was a make your own chat counter and make ur own raita counter.. U can make papri chat n Raj kachori.. They gave almost all items required.. So I loved making it and eat it. There was a make your own sandwich counter also but dnt felt like making it for myself. There were live dosa counter n live malpua counter but in my 2.5 hrs stay there dnt find any1 serving it or having it. 
Main course.. Subz hariyali kofta.. Bhune hue alu dam.. Paneer.. Kali dal.. yellow dal.. Jeera rice.. steam rice.. All were decent.. Nothing exceptional.. Breads ordered were garlic bread and lacha paratha.. Both were good.. One thing which I saw and could not believe was that there was a item named stir fried Chinese greens with mushroom.. It is supposed to be a chinese side dish but could not find any supporting dish with it.. When I asked the management they said you can have it with breads or steam rice.. I was shocked to hear that.. How can this be said in a 5 star restaurant like this.. After lot of discussion they did provided me with a complimentary Hakka noodles..
There were salad counter and cheese platter too which had good enough varieties.. In drinks there were mix fruit juice and lassi.. Both tasted good..
Coming to the best part of my lunch.. Deserts.. Just loved it.. They were varieties of cut fruits.. In sweets they offered.. Gulab jamun, sandesh, tarts.. All tasted very good.. Dnt liked vanilla cherry parfait.. Orange cheese cake was yummy.. But the best thing was Belgian cake.. One of the better cakes I have ever had.. Fantastic..
Overall.. Lovely ambience.. Service was good.. Food was very good in parts.. The Chinese side dish incident just pissed me off but they compensated well by offering complimentary noodles and giving extra care to our table..

I had the pleasure of having a buffet breakfast here with a large number of friends. The spread was great - much more than the standard hotel spread and the live counters were excellent. 

The food was fresh and cooked well. All the items on the buffet were well prepared and refreshed quickly. I would highly recommend the omelet station as also the puri sabzi.

Buffet lunch at Alfresco, The Lalit Great Eastern is really a nice experience. The ambience is superb with friendly staff members. Food is good with lots of varieties though prawn and sea food were lacking. In dessert section the cakes and pastries requires special mention. Great Eastern is always remembered for its superior quality bakery products. The buffet lunch is expensive, over Rs. 1700 INR but adequate for a five star hotel. However few more items should be added to make it a memorable buffet experience for food lovers. Recommended.

What sets this place apart is the decor.......its wow!The predominance of the colour white,the pergolas,the glass all combine together to make this place an Architectural marvel and it's worth visiting this place for the ambience alone.

But.......the buffet is nothing exceptional.Even ordinary.Though the range is elaborate where they fail is not being authentic to the original taste especially for the local dishes.

Also service can improve a whole lot.

Also if buffet is the mainstay it should stay on longer and the servers should not be seen in a hurry to leave.

A long wait ends finally. I badly wanted to visit this restaurant after i heard it has been handed over to private groups and undergone a huge make over. I still remember those days when i used to come here with my parents since it was my father's favourite. A 174 years old Asia's oldest and longest operating hotel has its own essence no doubt. The manager welcomed us at the entrance of the restaurant and allotted us a table for two just beside the small water pool. The ceiling is covered with glass and that day it was raining which gave a beautiful view and experience all together.
  Coming to the food, it was a lavish buffet spread. The waiter informed us that starters would be served at table others are arranged in the middle of the room. After 10 minutes, we were served with tandoori paneer and chicken nuggets. Paneer was served with green pudina(mint) chutni where as chicken was served with mayonnaise. Both tasted good. Then we went for our main course and discovered that there were soups and salads in the starter which were placed along with the main course at one corner. Chicken lung fung soup and mixed vegetables with sweet corn soup were really awesome. Several types of breads and buns were there with soup. The one i took was a bun made of brown bread but it was too hard and i didn't like it. A 'make-your-own-sandwich' corner was also there with sandwich maker. Salads were good too specially the chicken salad.
  In main course, they have a wide spread of vegetable dishes among which i tasted few namely- exotic vegetables with ginger wine sauce, potato spinach masala, kofta and a recipe with ladies finger. I loved potato and mixed vegetable dishes, it was light and tasted great. In non-veg section, they have chicken biriyani, spicy chicken, mutton ghooghni and fish florentine. Fish florentine was so much in demand that i couldn't even taste properly since they took a long time to refill the container and it took seconds to finish. Biriyani was really nice but light whereas spicy chicken tasted fantastic. Ghooghni was also good. 
  Two types of indian drinks were there- kesari thandai and muskmelon lassi. I just loved kesaria thandai. It was so yummy refreshing and soothing and smelt great.
  In dessert, we had fresh fruits-papaya, pine apple, apple, water melon,Mishti doi, kala jamun, chom chom and chandrakut were there in Indian section. But mousse, brownie, pineapple tart, pastry were also there. 
   That day it was too crowded and the staffs face difficulties to attend everyone. Also there was space crunch and food items arrangement were very confusing.

After a period of closure the "oldest luxury hotel in India" has re-opened in a new avatar under a new management. Understandably, they are eager to increase foot-fall and are offering various discounts. I got hold of some coupons (Rs. 850 per head instead of the usual 1700+) from Groupon and went there for a Sunday lunch buffet at Alfresco.
              The setting of this particular restaurant is indeed beautiful. It has glass walls and roof and is set by the side of the lily-pool. Now coming to the food. Most buffets are hit and miss affairs with some things that you like and some that's not up to the mark. This one is no exception. The spread was decent but nothing exceptional. I liked the chicken soup, the paneer offered as a starter and also the fish in the mustard gravy. Most of the rest of the items were average. There was no prawn, crab or other exotic stuff on the menu.
           The service was warm and friendly throughout, but not always most efficient. For example, there was nobody stationed at the carving station. Overall it is OK for the reduced price but will definitely not be so for the full price. For that the buffet needs to improve a lot in all departments.

Went here since I wanted to see how he Great Eastern Hotel was looking after the renovation. The restaurant, however, was located in the new building. Overall we were quite disappointed with Alfresco. The quality of food was really sub par.  The prices were also quite steep. One just cannot compare this with the Great Eastern of its heydays. The Ala carte had limited choice especially in the Continental section. We, however, tried one Indian starter, Zafrani Murg tikka, since it was supposed to be a speciality dish but was it was more like any standard run of the mill malai kabab and it wasn't special at all. What was most shocking was the compulsory 10% Service Charge which is never charged in 5 Stars. It has only ensured that I won't visit the hotel again.

Except for the beautiful seating area, I can't say much positive things about this place. For starters, there was only a veg and a non veg dish for starter, where other buffet places serves a variety of dishes. 

But they do have a variety in main course, lots of chaats, lots of soups, lots of breads and some delicious Indian preparations too. I really liked the lamb and the gobi dish. They also served a complimentary soda drink apart from the orange drink and lassi. We didn't like the complimentary drink  so they were courteous enough to change it. The dessert station was very pretty but I was too full to taste them all.

It was definitely a nice place to visit but taste wise I have had better.

A very disappointing experience. I reached around 9:30PM to dine with my family and probably the waiters change their shift during that hour hence hell broke loose.

Firstly we ordered Grilled Chicken but the bill came for Tandory Chooza and we were informed that the prices are same hence it doesnt matter.
Next, the waiter missed charging us for our Ceaser Salad. When we told him so , he said thats okay its on the house. Some one who gave him the handover of his duty didnt tell him about our first order. While we were boarding our car, the waiter came running with another bill stating that he found the bill for the salad and he will have to pay for if we would have left. Pathetic.

We ordered from the International food section we wanted some garlic bread on the side and I was asked around 5 times by 3 different people if I am asking for Tandoori Roti with garlic on it. LOL. 

Such communication gaps and pathetic services are not expected from a five star group. I am never recommending this place to anybody. 

note- My bills are numbered 8031 and 8029.

So my friend and I were very hungry and decided to indulge! So we dropped in at this joint for a quick meal and my my was it worth it. I asked for a beef steak medium rare cooked rare to medium and it was perfection. The sauce I had gotten was brilliant too. The grilled chicken my friend had was also very good.
Service is courteous but slow. Prices are at par with completion but I know they're a five star but shouldn't charge 320 for a bottle of water.
All in all excellent food.
Will definitely visit again and I think you guys should go too!

The Lalit Great Eastern is like gem in the area where there is no other 5 star establishments. Tucked at corner of busy BBD Bag area will be a challenge to find the entrance inside a narrow lane. Interiors are posh and exquisite. Good to see the hotel been revamped to its best. Will recommend to take historical tour of the hotel. Many things about this historical hotel still unknown to many.

Took my better half to Valentine’s date at Alfresco. Ambiance is sophisticated yet kept to minimal. Lunch buffet was in offer. In drinks Minty Orange juice was interesting. Mango Martini was not interesting. In starters somehow liked Papri Chaat and Dahi Phuchka Chaat though amount of spices and tanginess was missing. Crispy Baby Corn was not soggy but crispy and Murgh Malai Tikka was delicately soft. Thyme Chicken Soup was excellent.

Salad counter will surely drag your attention. Decoration in presentation will make you feel as if you are in Master Chef show.

In main course there were 5 to 6 varieties of veg and non-veg dishes respectively. But I feel taste wise and choice on the spread this is paradise for veg lovers. In non-veg main course only Lamb Shepherds Pie worth a mention. For biriyani lovers will get a heart attack on tasting their version of Murg Biriyani. In the special dish of the day Herb Marinated Fish Roulade was a disaster. Was kind of mood spoiler in the course. Was bone dry, stone cold and horrible smell of fish. Presentation was tempting for everyone but as they say never judge a book by its cover. Looks like trainees are working at kitchen to prepare these dishes and novices had responsibility to run the show. An example, the display at counter says Mutter Pulao but they served Kaju Kismish Pulao. Servers don't know what cocktail in over in the buffet or if starters will be served at table.

Thank god the dessert course came in the rescue. No wonder bakery is one of the strengths of the establishment and was evident here too. Couldn’t pick a single favourite as all scored high as per my taste buds.

Service is very slow and always found they are clueless what on offer. Very dilly-dally in cleaning up used plates from table and you have to call them to get their attention. Things in total no way closer to 5 star standards. For buffet price of around INR 1700 lots of improvement is expected from them. Especially on kind of dish and taste they are serving in the spread.

I am a vegetarian but my colleagues tried non veg and where overwhelmed. Veg dishes were great and the salad bar chat bar was also good . Lot of varieties of main course dishes from Bengali Rajasthani Punjabi and South Indian cuisine. Lots of Bengali desserts if you have sweet tooth like me.

Nice decor inside. We took the midnight buffet. Main food items are nice, however the desserts can be little better in quantity and quality. Want to visit for the dinner buffet. It offers 'Paturi' too. Would like to visit again.

Beautiful resto in the erstwhile hotel The Lalit.. The interiors here are pure white.. Space is also quite large.. Roofless place so you get sunlight and vit D with breakfast..
Coming to food.. I loved the waffles with maple syrup and cream, cheese omlette was no less and so was sada dosa with chatnis and sambar.. 
It was extremely relaxing and best start of the day to start with a cup of coffee here.. 
Idlis upma semiya vada were ok.. Chole batura were also ok.. Nothing great abt it..
For buffet breakfast u will find bakery juices cereals farsans and lot more.. Choose items wisely.. To ensure u have tasted the best served items at alfresco

Just came out after having dinner for 1500 plus tax. We were three of us thr food was not upto the mark at all.
The white sause pasta was hard not cooked well, the fish was more for lunch not dinner. Not good choice of spread at all.
Never to go again.

Buffet on a Saturday dinner.
The Indian dishes wasn't bad, although the continental dishes could've been better.

And the starters & desert platter was a plus.
Ambiance - 4
Food - 3.5
Service - 3.5 (this is only coz I like to be asked less questions while I'm having my food) except it this was a 4.

I had an excellent meal at the Alfresco which is the Multi-cuisine Coffee Shop of The Lalit Great Eastern. I visited for Lunch and immediately saw that they had a very good buffet spread where the guest was spoilt for choice. I also loved that they had an Idiapam Counter , a Patishapta Counter and along with the other usual Indian and Continental Buffet Spread they had choice items that were hand-picked from local Bengali Cuisine and showcased with pride as befits this heritage hotel and the special place it has in the history of the City of Joy . Check out the Local Connection Menu for some brilliant local food.
I won't dwell on the usual stuff needless to say it was pretty good .... for me the runaway hit was the local cuisine that I sampled ... Fish Chop and Mutton Chop both of which were absolutely brilliant .... fried to a perfect degree ... golden brown and crisp they were lovely .... served up with a fantastic Kashundi ( a local mustard ) .... made in-house which was excellent and paired up beautifully with the chops. This was followed up by some excellent Haleem .... both Non Vegetarian made with mutton and Vegetarian made with Soya .... served up roti (flatbread). The Haleem had perfect depth of flavour and was very good however I was pleasantly surprised by the vegetarian version which was lovely too. My very first vegetarian Haleem !!! Two other stand-out dishes followed Borishali Bhekti which was my dish of the day .... fish cooked to perfection flaky but not dry .... cooked with onion , tomato , coriander , coconut .... I would go back for it anytime, I believe it is a speciality that is a family recepie of the Executive Chef Madhumita Mohanta. This was followed up with an old style Mutton Stew served with Pav (Bread Rolls). The stew had potatoes and carrot ... a lovely gravy perfect to soak the bread in and the mutton so soft that it was falling of the bone ...... sighhhhh! .... sheer delight I tell you ! 
This sinful meal ended with Patishapta (crepes) stuffed with Kheer and garnished with Honey and Almonds and the signature dessert of their bakery the Belgian Hazelnut Crunch with Chocolate Sauce and a dollop of Orange Marmalade ! Happiness is made of this. And the only problem was getting myself home after this wonderful culinary experience. 
To Chef Madhumita Mohanta who was wonderful to talk to and kind enough to take the time to patiently answered all my questions and her very sweet and talented team thankyou very much for a delicious and wonderful meal. I look forward to many more :-)

Had the most exceptional Birthday Breakfast gifted to me by my Best Friend of 17 years. It was out of the blue and boy was it a pleasant surprise!! I was given two options one the eternal Flurys which is almost the synonym for Breakfast in Kolkata  and the 2nd Was The Alfresco at Lalit Great eastern. Not let me tell you a lil secret i am a foodie and i have been inculcated into being so by my Grand Mum Maestro Gita Ghatak...... She used to tell me about the Grandeur of The Great Eastern which was then the biggest in India.Let me give an introduction to the Lalit Great eastern's History. This Hotel was the 1st Five Star hotel in India built by the British somewhere around 1860. Then it was called "The Aukland Hotel" . If someone was seen going to this hotel that person was nothing less than a king. My Grandmother used to tell me that iot's grandeur,poise and Magnitude is unparalleled. So For me It was The Lalit Great eastern. As soon as we entered the Palatial property we felt that the staffs where there to serve us only. You suddenly get detached from the noise and cacophony of Kolkata and you will be transmitted to a majestic avenue with the calm and soothing environment of an exotic virgin island. The decor was In Tuscany Yellow and Pale white which was like a French reverie for me.... The roof was of glass and the divine coincidence emulsified my dream morning when it started to drizzle...Huge French windows overlooked a water body and i was suddenly attaining my nirvana. The buffet Spread was huge..and if i start writing muse after muse about each and every dish i plated it would become a novel or two. In short everything was just perfect to the T. Specially the dessert spread was fit for a king and i was blown away by their Apple Pie and Banana Tea cake....Service was out of this world. I don't know from where they got to know that it was my bday and suddenly i was presented with a mint chocolate cake gladdened with candle and a lot of love. 
Rating: Food: 4.5/5
Ambiance :5/5
Service: 5/5
Price: 5/5

Dishes to look forward to: Spinach and Corn in Cream Sauce,
Smoked Salmon ( The best i had in kolkata)
Cheese Platter
Omelets
Tea and Banana Cake
Apple Pie
Plum Croissant.

Ever since we heard the news of Great Eastern re-opening, it was in our wishlist to visit the new avatar. Finally, this Father's day we saw the special Sunday Brunch offer and could not resist ourselves. Four of us and my 2yr old son visited the place at around 2pm.

Right from the point we stepped out of our car till the very moment we stepped in back into the car again, it was a delightful experience in totality.

To start with, it was a great sitting experience in an area that was covered yet exposed to nature on a beautiful rainy afternoon. 

The array of food had great variety from bengali to goanese to north indian to south indian to continental to turkish delicacies. Live counters were serving pan cakes, pau bhaji and some south indian dishes. Loved the roasted lamb, prawn cocktail and turkish halwa amongst the 15-20 items that we tasted. 2 glasses of beers were also complimentary...what more could we ask for!

However, the most amazing part of the buffet experience was indeed the warm & personal care of the staff. I was flattered when the lady took me out on a tour of the long buffet herself, followed by one of the chefs, Anirban, coming and serving the vindaloo himself on our table and there was this guy standing almost permanently next to our table for any order so that we didn't have to walk to the table at all. The numerous breads and tikkas and drinks and ice creams were all served as per choice right on the table in quantities more than we asked for! I cannot express enough in words how bonded we felt with Lalit on this day. 

After the brunch, we requested for a tour of the newly renovated hotel. Trust me, the lady took us so seriously as guests and showed us every beautiful corner of the property including the heritage building and confectionery. We're so glad to witness the original oven & staircases & pillars & bricks of the British era....it was truly fascinating.

Lalit truly lives in everyone inside the premise! Thank you all.
