Its nearby my office...If we wish to have some 'mukhorochak' we used to go outside...I went here 2times...Its nearby topsia mor...
Regarding the food quality I had pav vaji nd paneer pakora here...pav vaji was ok,paneer pakora was not.good at all...paneer wid besan.fry with no taste...
Main point lots of flies there,not so clean place...so called ac outlet,bt they don't use ac ever...
Sry for such negative review but I can't wish to go again...

Veg rolls are just amazing. üòça must try for roll lovers.  Tikia chola is also worth it. Overall a nice place for evening veg snacks. Good food with reasonable pricing.

Quite a few vegan options in the menu.
Pocket friendly pricing.
The delivery is made in proper packets.
The quantity of food is reasonable and the taste is good too.
Friendly staff.
No points for ambience.

Situated in an area where either very expensive Chinese restaurants ‚ÄúChina Town- Tangra‚Äù or street food are available; makes a lot of difference to those in the hunt for good, yet reasonable food. They specialize in grilled sandwiches and is a purely vegetarian outlet. I, not being a lover of vegetarian food would still like to recommend the Grilled Sandwiches for those who would like to have quick and sumptuous meals. Given the price and location, it is tough to get anything better.

Where do they deliver if not in and around Topsia?? Ridiculous!! The last time I called for delivery they said there's nobody available to do so since it was a Saturday and today they just said they can't.

No ambience at all. Quantity of food is good but quality is average. There is no place to sit and eat. Good for people working in offices nearby as not many choices are there in the vicinity.

I used to visit this small restaurant when I used to go Topsia at a client's office, near Vishwakarma building.
This was the go to place for our everyday lunch as wasn't any better or rather cheaper place around in that area.

So we used to have Paw Bhaji, Paneer and Dal preparations with Kachori. For some south indian craving you could have Idly or Butter Masala Dosa. For we would have Jalebi or Gulab Jamun which were nice. All this coupled with a glass of Lassi was quite filling.

All in all the food was average but still decent. Given the price and location its tough to get anything better.

Food served here are hygienic, good and tasty. Whenever I visit Topia I have my lunch here. Grilled Cheese Sandwich is great and Chole Bhature is awesome. In the evening I prefer Masala Tea and Onion Pakora are great combination. Must try.
