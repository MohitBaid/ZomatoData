Bad experience. Although they have chinese quisine in their menu they hardly serve it. Many a times we went through this. We asked for momo and the answer was "sorry we don't have it". Neither in the lunch nor in the dinner. So, guys my advice is to enquire on phone before you waste your precious time and money to drive all the way to this place

Too big to be restaurant.
Very near to IIM-C. If u want to eat just near to IIM-C, this place can offer good variety and just fine ambience. 
From outside you will feel it is just a take away restaurant, but as you enter inside you will see huge place, a single big hall. The ambience is just ok.
Food is better than the places around and specially better than the mess food, or it was just we got bored of mess food. 
To my surprise service was swift and they served well.
On all points just crossing the mark, the problem is about prices. At the fag end of Kolkata they were charging exorbitant prices.

So cant give more than 3/5.

So...this is a newly opened restaurant at Joka
Quite spacious...perfect for going in a large group.
As we were sceptical about the food quality here, so we preferred to go by the Zomato reviews. 
We stuck to the basics and ordered Biryani and Chilli chicken...the menu varied as we were in a group.
An extra .5 rating for the accompaniments that they served with Biryani like Raita and Green salad. 
The place has good scope for improvement as it is the only decent place to eat in that area.

I have rated 1, because one can't rate a zero to any restaurant sadly. My order was placed via Zomato at 7:52 PM. The restaurant was expected to deliver by 8:52 PM. When I didn't get it by 9:15 PM I made a call to Urban Kitchen and someone from the management told me that my food is almost prepared and it will reach in a couple of minutes. By 9:30 PM, I asked Zomato's management to intervene and let me know the status of the order. At 9:40 PM, the restaurant cancelled my order and on calling them again they told me that the order was never received. I wonder how conveniently they lie and give absolutely zero consideration to customers. After waiting for almost two hours, I have deep regrets from Zomato team, extra Rs 150 in my wallet (Yayy!!) to make me get over the whole incident by Zomato and a hungry stomach. Pathetic!!

A good retreat from the otherwise mess food! Good food. The Chinese menu and the food needs improvement though. Kashmiri Pulao is a special mention and a must have! :-)

Nice place ; near joka IIM;&ESI hospital. From outside it may look like a small roadside restaurant; but the inside is spacious; and decor is simple but elegant.
Coming to food; its good..  served timely.. especially the Malai kabab was really great.. we became really fan of this menu.. have tasted malai kabab in other places too but this was sumthing special; it is a kabab served like a sizzler dish.. and the chicken were served with malai and was extremely well marinated... 
well behaved waiters..
Only thing that bothered us was unnecessary time taken to produce the bill at the end of our lunch..
Overall a 4*

Just a 5 minute walk away from IIM Calcutta, Urban Kitchen is one place we look upto for last minute plans with regard to dining. Well kept space- beautiful furnishing and golden ambience. The kababs are great down here, we tried most of them when they installed a stall in our campus. Though I am not a great fan of Urban spcl.Sultani kabab (chicken with mutton) but when you ask the waiters to help you with the kebabs, they shall suggest this to you for sure. My personal favourite is Hot grilled chicken tikka kebab.

The Kebabs are just perfectly priced. Especially the chicken Sheekh kebab..I couldn't complete the whole plate myself given the main course too.
The biryani is also ok here (Hyderabadi at heart I will always have issues with the biryani at Kolkata :P).

Though the price may seem expensive in the beginning, it is justified by the content. You shall be fully fed at this place.

Kind of magical. From outside this one looks like a normal restaurant with a medium level seating capacity but once you get inside it feel like a huge playground where you can fit a crowd. Really a big one with so much space and they have utilised it well. It even has a private room for a group with good privacy. everything is tip top clean, starting from dining area to washroom. Seating arrangement is really good such that even if the restaurant is fully packed u won't get the suffocating feeling. Giant screens are there so that u can enjoy your food along with ongoing live sports. 
Coming to food , only the tandoori chicken we ordered felt a bit undercooked. Everything else was fine.

This place is now the heartthrob of Joka as I don't think there are any other restaurants in that area serving such amazing Indian and Chinese food. 
The location is very easy, it's on the main road , just beside the Genexx Complex. 
I more than love this place now and has become my go-to place especially for the North Indian delicacies. 
My first experience was extraordinarily wonderful. I went with my family to dine. I was amazed  by the ambience, the dining area is just perfect for an ambient evening food with your family. They even have a private dining space in case if you want to throw a private party. 
The food styling here is exquisite, they were served with elegant decorations. 
We had ordered the following: 
1. Starters: they have decent varieties of starters. The reshmi kebab is a must try. They just melt in your mouth simultaneously melting your heart. We had even ordered cheese stuffed mushrooms...they were lip-smackingly amazing. 
2. Mains- As we all had different choices regarding cuisines, therefore our table was diversely decorated. We had ordered butter naan and sheesh Mahal butter chicken which tasted exactly like a chicken butter masala, I did not find any difference. Urban kitchen special non veg fried rice with babycorn and mushroom in Hong Kong style was a superb combo, it might sound weird but trust me the amazing rice blended well with the Hong Kong style gravy. The best of all was the urban kitchen special shahi biriyani 😍....the decoration will amaze you and the best part is it has both mutton and chicken. Biriyani with a perfect potato(aloo), pieces of boiled eggs with both mutton and chicken, what else do you need? It's like heaven served in a bowl. 
They even have good varieties of mocktails and shakes. We had ordered a Choco shake, which was okay-ish. 
It's a perfect place for a lavish dinner with your family without much of a pocket pinch. Definitely worth many visits.

Urban kitchen is the biggest restraurant in Joka serving Chinese and  North Indian dishes. Went there with my friends  and ordered  their chicken kacchi chapti kebab and chicken sultani kebab stuffed with mutton which is their speciality. Both the kebabs were served as sizzlers and were visually appealing. Chapti proved to be disastrous. It was bland and had no taste. Sultani was better however even though stuffed with mutton, its taste was missing. Next we ordered butter tandoori rotis , Lucknawi khulcha, seesh mahal chicken tikka butter masala and creamy reshmi chicken butter masala. Khulcha was great. The rotis were ok and both the chicken dishes were quite good especially the creamy reshmi chicken butter masala which never dissapoints me. Ambience and decor is nicely done with a golden theme. Prices are not inclusive of tax.

This was again one of our planned visit to this place with my other foodie buds. Well a A star to their amazing ambience and the way they utilized the huge size of this place, we don't expect much of decorations from restaurants of this locality, they have a added private section also. For starters we ordered Urban Kitchen Special Chicken Sultani Kebab(stuffed with mutton), Chicken Kacchi Chapti Kebab, for main course Masala Kulcha, Tandoori Roti, Sheesh Mahal Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Creamy Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. The service time was long almost around 45 minutes. The kebabs were served in sizzler form. The Sultani Kebab was very good, Chapti Kebab didn't taste like Chicken at all none of us liked it. The gravy dishes were good, the Kulcha tasted heavenly and for me it was the best part of the whole meal.

Visited to this restaurant today with my friends. The place is situated near to the Genex Valley Residential Complex. The restaurant is very spacious and has a seating capacity over 100. The ambiance is too good. No restaurant in this area have such kind of ambience. The place also have a special private dining section. 

Now coming to the food, so let's start with the starters-

1. Urban Kitchen Special Chicken Sultani Kebab (stuffed with Mutton)-

This was a very innovative dish for me. The chicken kebabs were too good and stuffing enhanced its taste. There were six pieces of it and I recommend everyone to try this.

2. Chicken Kachi Chapti Kebab-

Actually I never heard the name of such kebab so we thought to try it. It also consisted of six pieces but it tasted so bad. It was too spicy and I didn't felt any presence of chicken in this kebab. People who don't like spicy food should not try this kebab at all.

Both the Kebabs were served like sizzlers and was presentation was also very nice.

Coming to the Main Course-

1. Tandoori Roti and Masala Kulcha-

Usually tandoori rotis are made up of maida and are very soft. But here  the Rotis seemed like it was made up of Atta and maida. It was not soft at all. One of my friend tasted the masala kulcha and he told that it was good.

2. Sheesh Mahal Chicken Tikka Butter Masala- 

Usually any kind of Butter Masala don't disappoint and the same thing happened here. The sheesh Mahal chicken was too good. It consisted of four pieces. The size of chicken was nice and the taste was great.

3. Creamy Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala-

As I said you before butter masala don't disappoint so this item also consisted of four pieces and gravy was very tasty.

But for me the Sheesh Mahal Chicken was much better than this one. Still I recommend everyone to try both this items.

Now some negativities of the restaurant the service time is too much we nearly waited for 45 minutes to get all these items. There are lack of choices in the Curry dishes. The price is on the higher side. The management should look after the negativities mentioned above, so a 3.5 for it.

Commendable for the managers to put up such an attractive and seemingly nice food joint at not so demanding location. The place is just few metres ahead from Genexx Valley. I had a paneer roll which was okayish. They had put fresh vegetables inside the roll. Moreover, the paneer was also cold. Only thing good about it was it's size, which was huge compared to other places. The restaurant looked vacant and was not worth trying.

From outside this place looks okay though! Now coming to the food.. their Biriyani is awesome.  The normal Biriyani will suffice two people. And most interestingly the complementary raita is delicious. When they deliver food at our office, the packaging is worth praising. :) Overall a good eatery and hence recommended.

Chicken in chicken roll is uncooked and cold. Chicken tandori is tasteless and almost burnt. The worst I ever had...I don't like to waste food and this have to ate it. The chicken was not cooked well and they rolled cold chicken inside the roll. Will prefer going to azad hind dhaba for the same.
They don't have updated price in menu chart. Price is on higher side and quality if on worst side.

Worst ever experience.

Bland mocktails, pedestrian food quality (served under cooked chicken), & clueless staff (on being asked for the best chicken gravy, was pointed towards dhaniya murgh, which turned out to be a disaster).
Never visiting again.

The food is good but beware if you are ordering from home, they'll overcharge you in the bill itself. I ordered 2 Yellow dal fry and 2 jeera rice yesterday night and they charged me for 8 (Rs 10 each) containers in total whereas the package had only 4 of them. When I confronted the delivery boy he shamelessly started grinning. These guys are very casual about cheating people and won't even apologise, let alone refunding the excess money wrongly charged by them.

This new restaurant is just a few minutes walking from IIM Calcutta (locally known as Joka Management), this place provides a good option for the hostelers of the college which is situated south to even south Calcutta, and therefore lacks good restaurants in its vicinity. The ambience is good and the staff quite courteous. The price is reasonable too considering that most of the customers would be the students from IIMC.

We ordered Sheesh Mahal Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Chicken Do Pyaaza and Dal Makhani in the main course along with tandoori rotis and naans. Lucknawi Masala Kulcha was quite heavy. The taste is okay according to the price, but it can be improved.

Good Ambience, cordial staff and service but the one of the most aweful food i have ever tasted. We ordered spring rolls, drums of heaven and crispy baby corn for starters. Did not have the courage to finish the main course there so got it packed.
