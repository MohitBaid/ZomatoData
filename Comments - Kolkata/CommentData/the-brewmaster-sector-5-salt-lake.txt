Everything here is just amazing starting from food to their service. Since I am a vegetarian so tried the veg items. Everything I ate had an awesome taste and ambience is so cool that it refreshes you in no time. This is also a must visit place in sector 5.

It was an office party for us. So we went there on a Friday night to have some booze, good food and to dance.

The place was nice. But food was not great. For starters we were served crispy potato, crispy chilli baby corn, chicken kabab and barbeque chicken wings. The baby corn was too spicy, no one liked potato and the waiter didn't bring chicken kabab for the next round. Only good things were the wings.

In the main course there was butter naan, daal makhani, paneer labaddar, veg biryani for vegetarians. In the non veg section there was only Butter Chicken and Chicken Kasha. I was dissapointed and a little angry to see that they didn't have any mutton dish. At least, they could have kept chicken biryani.

In the desserts also there wasn't much. It was the usual vanilla ice-cream and gulab jamuns.

So overall I would say that this place is only good for a bar and nothing else. Even the DJ was playing terrible songs.

This place is must go, for the people who work for the whole day , wants to enjoy rest of the evening and end it on a happy note.  As the place has a dance floor and DJ's to play song, the songs they play will automatically pull you towards the dance floor.

Pitting the evening for a cool hangout place, we were hopping near RDB boulevard. Searching through zomato, we found this place offering happy hours. The place is at the ground floor opposite RDB boulevard and allows stag entry which is a plus. There is a private dining space near entrance which provides a cosy environment for couples. The bar is sophistically decorated with appalling furnitures, lounge and high chairs. Dance floor is a plus allowing to club with live DJ under lights. Food is quite good but the quantity is less. So its a no go if anyone looks for quantity food for the corresponding rates. Also the service is quite slow in response time. So it is a turn off. Management please look into the matter and try to improve service quality.

Visited this new addition to sec V on a Sunday night with couple of my friends. This place is in the heart of sec V, so it's very easy to locate. We entered the pub on around 6:30. That time it was very quite n empty. Slowly the DJ increased its volume n was full with a decent crowd. the DJ was playing some very good tracks, but at some point it became too hard to have a conversation with friends due to the loud music. Apart from that this place possess a large dance area, dj lights, comfortable seating, giant display screen, cozy couple corners,  dim lighting, everything a pub demands.
Now coming to the food we ordered chicken Ceasar salad, smoked barbequed winglet, jerk chicken burchetta and chicken lasagne. All the food items were too yummy. Specially the jerk chicken was awesome. Coming to the drink we ordered 3 pitchers of draught beer as the microbrewery has not opened yet. They have their happy hour till 8'o clock but do not have such discounts on liquor. Only discount was on old monk. This is the only con I found out. Our total bill was 3421/- for 3 people which was quite reasonable. Will strongly recommend this place.

Went in for a lunch here, to find myself the only ones at this outlet, the staff seriously need proper training, they don't respond to calls and have to grab their attention after many calls. Tried north Indian from this place, the mocktails we tried, blue lagoon and Virgin mojito were very refreshing and cool.
The panner tikka we tried was also good.
But the main course disappointed us, I guess we choose the wrong set of main course at this place.

The naan was thin, non-rubbery, the sahi panner we tried was okiesh, lacked cream to be called a sahi panner.
Will hop in again for some non meal items at peak hours to enjoy the ambiance of this place

A new addition at Sec V RDB Zone.

This was the perfect match for our requirements,
A late night pub, who serves cheap alcohol preferably beer tower and hookah with some delicious food. So nine of us gave a try.

I booked though zomato apps, very quick response. The manager personally called me to confirm the booking, nice gesture.

Comfortable seating arena with great wooden dance floor.
A special thanks to the manager, who held our place upto 10pm.

DJ Veer was mind blowing, every song was superb and exactly matching with the tempo of the crowd.

Now coming to the part of food. Two plates of Non Veg Platter and Beer crafted Fish finger. Taste of the kebabs was distinct from each types of kebabs, a must try for this place. And nothing new for fish finger, good and accompanying tartare sauce and french fries.

Pan flavoured hookah was smooth to smoke, but little less in term of flavours.

4L tower, Cranberry Brezzar, Cosmopolitan, Smirnoff, Brewmaster' Mocktail.

Then Main course Mutton Biriyani and Mutton Rarha, yummy and mouth watering. They served in uniquely inside of a 3storied tiffin container. First one contains Raita and other two Biriyani. biriyani was good in taste, mutton pieces was medium in size and soft tasty.

They took the last order at 11.30pm and open till 12am.

We are very happy with the experience, definitely we want to give a visit in near future.

Special Mention, we got corporate discounts.
And this place is super cheap and pocket friendly compared to the other places near by.

Great DJ and ambience! The whole place was quite happening on a Friday night! The staff were courteous and the food was decent. They have got amazing hookahs. However the service was super slow and we had to wait for the waiter for 15 min after being seated. I bet they can do more with such competition in sector 5! But I bet I'll visit again.

One of the most pocket friendly pubs in Kolkata. Supercool ambience, lipsmacking food, addictive sisha and music and drinks at economic rate made my Friday evening rocking!!!
Highly recommended 

NB : They need to extend their food menu a little bit as it lacks variety 
And also stop luring people as the microbrewery is yet to open

A Good Pub with a budget friendly rate-chart..

We went there during Puja time, it was the Panchami night...Didn't knew about this place before, we we were deciding for the place to hangout standing outside..Suddenly some sales boy came with their promotional lieflets.. and we went with him...

by location it was great, inside Inifinity BenchMark Building, Sec V.. right opposite to Bar-B-Q Nation..

Not much specious but arranged adequately.. 
A good Disc cum Pub environment.. made our day.. and that too within less amount than other places...

Foods are also good.. We had some starters and stakes as main course with Beer and Hookah ..
the "JERK CHICKEN BRUSHCETTA" is a must try..
One thing disappoint me that I haven't got the Drought Beer.. they said the stock was finished for the day.. it shouldn't be like this within the festive time..

Located beside bytes food court within infinity benchmark Brewmaster came up with lot of expectations as it promises to have a microbrewery. First disappointment, microbrewery is not yet open. Second, we went on a Friday evening, they were playing LOUD music. When we requested to tone down the volume, they flatly refused. Third, we asked for a pitcher of draught beer and after 15 minutes they informed that draught beer was already out of stock. Then we ordered 2 vodka based cocktails and chicken drumsticks and fried chicken cajun strips. Cocktails were not very impressive and food was not adequate in quantity especially chicken strips. Price is on a higher side. Overall not a great experience.

And the alcohol is absolutely jaali here.. we have 9 cocktails.. a mixture of sex on the beach and cosmopolitan.. 3 large BP.. 4 jagerbomb.. and we walked out straight! the sangria that we ordered was served warm to us.. and later they did change it, but the sangria tasted like some utopian horrible sangria we have never had before.. they probably used some cheap wine or mixed water to dilute it! And oh the Caesar Salad.. It was dressed in too much of mayo.. so, it was croutons, lettuce, chicken and mayo! Never had Caesar salad covered in sooooo much of mayo! We enjoyed but paid too much for shit!

Nice place to hangout in sector 5. The decoration is beautiful, with a dance floor. Food is beautiful but bit costly. We asked for bira white, they said bira was not available in market! I informed last night I went to opium and had bira. They said that they had bira till yesterday !! Next we asked for draught and the answer was same as before!! So unprofessional attitude from their end. Service is prompt, food quality is good, people must try kabab platter.

Brewmaster are not start drewing till now. We mainly go there for drought beer but they didnt get the licence of that so little dissapointment. Otherwise ambience is very good with good taste in music will surely charge your mood up. And they also serve sisha. We didnt taste their main course bt there starter was very good, tasty and nicly served. Highly recommded after they serve drought beer. Coz now they dnt even have variety in beer. They only serve one or 2 brand so u hv no choice for beer.

I would have actually started with "yet another place with micro brewery in the coming soon section" but guess I ll refrain from that. Coz the day I visited this place I was actually off alcohol. Now that's a different question as to why should one visit a place named Brewmaster on such a day. Nonetheless I had my reasons.

It was Saturday night and I happened to be in the sector 5 area. With almost zero expectations entered this place. Probably I was looking for some loud music to unwind. I am glad I entered this place. Not sure about other days and other DJs but the female playing there that day was doing an awesome job. Not too sure if she was there in house or a guest.

Just ordered a crispy chilly mushroom which had nothing to complain about. The sheeshah was not bad either and the waiters were quite responsive and hospitable.

They do have an in-house smoking room but that's tooooo small and cramped.

Unfortunately not in a position to comment upon the skills of the guy at the bar counter for obvious reasons.

A place has to really impress me for it to feature in my "Visit Again" list and this one has been quite successful in it.

Forget the food or drink, u wna groove at some real awesome numbers... Hit the place

Do zomato have a rating point less than 1??
One of the worst and disappointing pubs I have been to.

First and foremost, you call it "Microbrewery", but where the hell is it? Country Roads is way ahead.

You have options for 1ltr and 3ltr draught beer on your menu, and you never have this available.

Moreover you do not offer pitcher/tower options for other beers as well, and you insist on having a goddamn beer which costs Rs650 for a pint (taxes exclusive). Really, pints starting from 229-649??

Coming to the food, we ordered Amritsari Ragada Chicken Chaat. I want to ask where was the CHICKEN. It was a mixture of Chicken:Capsicum in the ratio 1:10.

You left no stones unturned to fool and loot your customers and give them every reason never to visit the place again.

This place has been my favourite off late.....they serve amazing food and play the best of music which will compel you to leave your seat and hit the dance floor....their manager Mr. Rishi is an extremely hospitable guy...he is always in charge of things and is extremely helpful....the rest of the staffs are also well behaved....you must try this one for an amazing experience!

We were led to believe that this is a microbrewery but alas, to our misfortune we discovered this it's not yet operational. With the disappointment in hand, we stuck to kingfisher draught and food and I am happily surprised to report that it was indeed a fine evening inspite of the initial disappointment. The food is rather interesting and it tastes well, the service isn't bad either and with the large screens playing sports, it's alright for a nice evening with mates.

The wooden interior with dark ambience, to begin with, is amazing. The seating is very comfortable and the music is excellent. The entire place is rather small, with very small dance floor but it's every inch is very impressive. 
The staff is very friendly and warm. If only they just paid a little more attention to every table, otherwise they're very good and really swift in their service. 
We had ordered french wedges and veg lasagna. Neither of which failed to impress. Lip smacking with appreciable quantity. 
Hands down, I became a fan of their sheesha. Flavour was rich and it lasted longer than most of the other I have had. Very happening place to spend weekend.

So I finally visited this place and found it pretty cosy and nice.
The ambiance is pretty good and the staff are friendly.
They list in those few places who serve draught beer and it pretty reasonable.
The food quality was also pretty good. The music played by the DJ was also good but then they had some issues and the music stopped. The overall experience was good.

I gave it a 3.5 but it is a must try place for its interior and food
Reason behind low rating is bcoz it didnot have any beer as they recently got alcohol licence and will take another 1month for the fresh bee
We wanted to have pizza and even that was not present so hence 3.5
They had preety good offer till 7pm i.e few cocktails 199 and @99 few alcohol (I wrote few as they did not have any dedicater menu for that,you need to ask them for the items on which they have happy hour offer)

It was a weakend day out, we, group of girls were searching for a place where all of our taste buds would be satisfied. The Brewmaster is one of the places where we could find North indian, Continental, Chinese under one roof with a variety of Seesha. This place is located at the ground floor of Infinity building. The decor is similar to other microbrewery in Kolkata. Good collection of music they were playing which would  lighten up your mood. When we reached there, Indian Women's final cricket match was shown to the television and some other​ music was being played in the background.The best part was when our National Anthem was shown to t.v they stopped the background music and increased the tv volume, everyone stood and sung together. It gave goose bump.We ordered greek style chicken, bhatti da kukkar as starter. Then we moved to the main course and we ordered chicken stroganoff, butter nun and motihari butter chicken. Must say our taste buds got satisfied..

Otherwise, decent place with decent crowd with very average service. They dont serve brewed beer, which is a surprise! The sheesha is good, but they kept us waiting for long and we had to provide lot of reminders. 
I believe they would pay attention to zomato reviews & improve the service.

Though I have been to this place only once and that too on a Saturday afternoon but I will not deny the fact that the people their knows how to treat a customer. I am big fan of continental cuisine and was really happy to see the selection of continental dishes on a micro-brewery menu card. I ordered for their Hawaiian chicken steak and found it to be perfectly fine. The best thing about this place is it's happy hours. It is never going to make you feel the pinch in your pocket. I am eagerly waiting to visit the place in the evening to feel the vibe.

This is the kind of place you can look forward to chilling with your friends after a hectic working day. Food is good. Cheese garlic bread and strawberry shake are two of the "value for money item". Mojito is a let down. So is the booze simply because we found it a bit overpriced. Rest of food is reasonably priced though. Decor and the staff are the cookie points. It is quiet spacious. Ambience is good. There is a separate smoking room. Staff is well-mannered and friendly. 👍

This is the 2nd time I have visited this place last sunday, which is right beside One sport lounge on that same building nd it was not at ol crowded!

Ambiance is good, spacious, decor is very upscale.

Sheesha was just made ri8,food tasted really good, but you don't get much options for beer🍺 that too they have not yet started their microbrewery operations,Which is a big  letdown.

Overall amazingly awesome experience. Ll surely visit again 

P.S- They need to start their microbrewery asap.

Rambled upon this place while scouting for options to celebrate our Saturday night! The place is big, and the crowd is checked. The music is good too. The food is recommended, we opted for their kebab platter. In addition to that, on Saturdays they have offers on their drinks menu 2:1 till 9:00 p.m. 
The ambiance was electrifying with the DJ belting out dance numbers, got the crowd grooving. Their hookah is their hottest seller with the place was not smoky at all. Recommended for friends night out!

The place is dead, if you go and don't find anyone sitting there don't panic it's open you'll find few waiters sitting in a corner.
The decoration and the ambiance of the place is pretty nice they tried to copy beer republic but thought they have a nice decoration and nice deem lights.
3.5/5 for decoration and ambiance
The staff over there aren't that friendly, they won't treat you with a smile and it's obvious the place is dead what you expect from that place and from the people over there.
1.5/5 for service
Now coming to the food and shisha the food was good and also the shisha the menu have a variety to serve, I didn't had beer because I was not carrying my ID card.
3.5/5 for food and shisha.
All over the place isn't the place where you can go have fun with your friends... If you're lonely and introvert it's the place were you can go and sit alone with few people around with DJ floor with no one dancing.

With an ambience similar to almost every microbrewery in Kolkata, The Brewmaster is the place to be if you want to chill out with your friends over a couple of drinks and some good food. The place was nice, but it didn’t ‘WOW’ me.

For the ‘sheesha’ lovers out there, they have a good variety there as well. We ordered dahi kebab, crispy chili American corn, salt and pepper chicken and nachos with chicken. In a group of five, where one guy was vegetarian, we specifically asked for the kebabs to not have any onion/garlic..and they complied so nicely. Our server was smart and rather nice, giving us excellent suggestions which turned out to be pocket friendly. The only glitch with this place is the lazer lighting, which hits your face and can make it rather uncomfortable.

P.S.: Their microbrewery hasn’t started yet, which was a letdown. Ah well, all the more reason to go back and try it out.

Situated at Infinity Benchmark (ground floor), The Brewmaster stands just opposite to Bar-B-Q Nation.

Ambience is simply awesome over there!!! Music is great. I just loved the laser lights which adds extra filters to the already super cool atmosphere!! A perfect place to party with friends!!

Coming to food! Although didn't try a wide variety due to lack of time, but whatever we had, it was pretty decent. I liked their Mixed Sauce Penne.

Sure gonna visit again to spend some extra minutes which I missed last time!!

This place has disappointed me a lot. I was amazed by the posh décor and the space. Trust me, they have a huge place. But there is more than just one thing that I didn't like about this place. 

Firstly, they call it Brewmaster still they don't serve you brewed beer. Basically there is nothing from there brewery. I don't understand then why the name in first place? Maybe to attract crowd?

Speaking of crowd, it a Friday evening when I hopped in. I was hoping to see the place with the weekend hustle bustle but unfortunately there was not much people. There were people on only 5 tables including us. It was 9.15 pm when we took off. Still no sign o good dance number or proper music handling. I was wanting to spend some more time but we were just short o enthusiasm.

The booze is simply overpriced to a great extent. Maybe this is one of the chief reasons why people don't come here. Well, in Zomato the price range that is mentioned has nothing to do with the actual menu there. Dude a pint o Kingfisher Lager was like 275 bucks! I ve been to better places in south Calcutta at much just price. 

We'd ordered Lamb Dumplings, Tandoori chaat and a quarter o BP along with 2 beers still the price stood at somewhere close to  Rs. 1900. Yaar abhi tak to GST bhi nahi aya! The only good thing was that they make the food really tasty and classic. 

I was offended by the service as well well. There were more than 10 people working and only 3 tables occupied still you don't get attented in the first call. Reason : all busy watching what's playing in the projector. Dude, you get paid to work there, not watch TV. So definitely the quality o service was beyond poor. 

It was simply a bad investment. I would ve given 2 or below but the food they serve deserves a mention. That's all. I won't visit that place second time.

Brewmaster is located at the same place where erstwhile Troya Club was located, i.e. opposite RDB Boulevard in Sector V. I recently heppen to go to this place on a Friday evening when the crowd hasn't still filled up yet. The ambiance was posh and the decor with wooden interiors and the microbrewery distillation set up added the extra bit of glamour to it.
Coming to the food, I couldn't stay there for long so could have around 3 pegs of whisky and Tandoori Chicken. The Tandoori was nicely done and hence full marks to it. However, one minor observation - the liquor glasses and bottles had HIndi Dhaba-style scripts on them which didn't went well with the posh look of the place.
All in all, Brewmaster could hold on my zeal to visit the place twice, and I would definitely visit again to try out some more of their food. Till then, cheers to the team !

I went in with big hopes but they don't serve brew beer (yet). They have all the equipments inside tough. So the ambience is quite good. Music is loud (really a bit strange to have loud music in a brew pub). Food is really good so hi five for that. Again beer options are limited and they don't have good options for strong beer. No drought beer (opps!). Will moderately recommend for a try. But really waiting for the brewing to start and will definitely go for some fresh beer.

What a great find! Right next to rdb in sec v. On a weekday evening the place was totally empty but we were a big gang and made up for it. The food is excellent as is the presentation. The place doesn't serve alcohol on Mondays and Thursday which is ridiculous because it's called brew master and you can't have beer. The mocktails are average . The service is good but the servets need to be better versed with the menu. The place is spacious and is well designed. Recommend the veg kebab platter , honey chilly potatoes , chicken wings and chilly baby corn.

Went on a thursday night when they dont serve drinks as they have license for serving alcoholic drinks only for 5 days a week (that is exluding monday and thursday). 

We ordered a Silver Fox Hookah , Mixed Sauce Spaghetti, Spring Rolls and 2 mocktails of different kind.

While talking abt the hookah , food and mocktails, everything was upto the mark. Hookah is really great at this place. I visited this place again after this visit. 

Little staff presence can be improved.

It has a DJ a dance floor (not sure) and a good ambience.

It also has micro brewery (self production of beer) but it is not yet started.

Overall lovely in terms of quality of food and everything.

Visited the brewmaster during lunch hours few days back, it was empty on a weekday! Certainly because of their microbrewery operations, which have'nt yet started.
From the entrance to the interiors, decor is very upscale, organized and gives a classy brewery pub feel. I loved everything about it also they have a big screen setup with DJ console.
We had ordered for a sheesha, brewmaster special mocktail and jerk chicken bruschetta. Food tasted really good but jerk chicken wasn't supposed to be the way they made it but probably that's how brewmaster does it! The mocktail was seriously good with orange based flavor along with some mint and a slight hint of ginger, kudos to the mixer. Sheesha was just made right, all in all it was a wonderful experience out there would like to go back for their happy hours someday!
Also for corporates they have added advantage of getting a discount on placing of their cards before billing.

Situated just beside one sports lounge, its a nice restaurant. Well a happening one actually. The staffs are well behaved but its very expensive. I tried the beer battered fish which was good, chicken stroganoff and fish in lemon butter sauce. They provided rice with the lemon butter sauce which was a new thing for me as no restaurant puts rice in fish with lemon butter sauce preparation. Both the chicken and fish were okayish. Pinacolada was amazing. It is expensive than the other similar restaurants which are situated in the same locality. Many items were even unavailable from the menu.

It was a great experience...we were 8 people in the group...we had hookah...there were plenty of flavours available...the added advantage was the DJ and the awesome ambience...its a great place to hangout with friends and have a great time...they also have a dance floor to show some steps if u want... The food was good but too much overpriced...thats y cant give full marks...service is good...also the liqours are costly enough compared to other places...but the music and ambience make up the cost somewhat...overall a great experience...as such no special dishes to mention...if u are looking for having fun time its a recommended venue...AWESOME!!!

Will never visit again. Good ambient but no decency in serving and way to expensive than same segment pubs. Didn't even courtesy to provide some snacks (peanut or cheesing) with drinks. DJ is like sleeping. Beer Republic is awesome I must say as we used to visit every week. The BrewMaster is 1/10 in everything. Totally disappointed from this place.

Visited the pub today afternoon, only to come out disappointed. They don't serve alcohol on all the days of the week. They do not mention this anywhere on their page. They mention happy days with special offers on alcohol, but no where is it mentioned that those are the only days where they serve alcohol. Please call them up before heading to the place.

I loved the Bollywood numbers being played because we enjoyed dancing there.. Service and decor is yet to come up to the mark. Food is fine, needs some more zest.

Ambience good,  food good,  service very good,  offer good... Ambience is not cozy,  but classy,  food quality is good,  specially tandoori chicken, didnt like the babycorn that much as i sm hard core non vegetarian...  Service is fabulous as the service boys were on their foot to help us and serve us,  we were dancing for a quite a long time,  they themselve offered to make the food warm,  offer of 2:1 for beers is really cool...

Nice place to chill out with your friends. Nice music, the DJ was shelling out some real nice music. The decor is also uber cool. a huge shoutout to Rishi Verma who was super helpful and helped us choose the apt dish. Had ordered a kiwi+supari hookah which was really well made. Overall, a superbly amazingly awesome experience.

We have been here for a good drink and good food. Well, we were satisfied, though not overjoyed. The dance floor was good, DJ was playing bollywood tadka songs and was provoking us to dance. It is costly and doesn't have that value for money. People do get bore here because find very few or no people dancing on the floor. Apart from it everything was satisfying.

Brewmaster is a hookah bar located across barbq nation near rdb in sector v. We went there on a Saturday evening. Place was quite full with dj playing good Bollywood numbers. They had couple of big screens playing ipl matches. Their brewery hadn't started yet so we decided to order whiskey, beer pints, kafir and lime chicken and patiala pakora. Starters were not that great - pakoras were crispy but stuffing was not good. Chicken was tender but not properly marinated. We decided to stop it there and move out. 3/5 for music, ambience and service. No points whatsoever for food. Pricey compared to its standards.

Situated at a prime location... The moment you enter this place,  it instills a sense of happiness in you.  But gradually this fades out as they have limited options of liquor... To add to that...  The offers are extremely vague and applicable on a marginal number of products.  Food on the contrary is very good indeed.  The onset of microbrewery will definitely add a zing to this place though. Early days and hence this place gets a benefit of doubt... Way to go...  Much to improve on the offerings...!!

Well they don't have the brewery started yet!! But ya couldn't resist visiting with the music playing after 6pm. It's in my office building so happened to b le there this weekend. Was all Bollywood with DJ. They've got a dance floor sort of area and it's cool by the way. "Desi being cool" that their USP.. Will visit again once brewery opens..

Well starting with the decor it is none other than the common Pubs of Sector 5, the Micro brewery is about to start in 3months time as said by the Manager. The creativity and what looks really impressive the dishes in which they are served - The British Scooter, The shovel then the Trolley is innovative. Coming to the food we had disappointment as they forgot our last order to place with the kitchen and we had to wait for 30mins for that instead we cancelled it, the Crispy chilli baby corn was perfect, The English Fish & Chips was not authentically prepared rather the fish had a coating of All purpose flour and Cornflour. About the Alcohol we ordered Quarter Vat 69 as it was savings the bunch but we didn't like that it was served in a cheap bottle,hope management improve this system. They have limited stocks Liqueurs as I opted for Malibu and Kahlua both were not in stock instead I was served with Jagermeister obviously with my concern. There was birthday party going on for two groups and people were dancing which was really merry to watch as there is no designated Dance floor. 
Lastly the management has to look after the waiter's training part and I'm pretty sure service will improve. Long way to go.. Hopefully visit again as the Micro brewery commences.

The biggest disappointment was the fact that the Microbrewery isn't functional yet. Then pizzas were not available, so was Mezze Platter :( 
We had a pitcher of Long Island Tea and some starters (Kaafir Lime Chicken, Veg Tandoori Platter and Delhi 6 Style Golgappa) which were not great but not too bad either. I liked their nachos and Golgappas.  
One of their sections had Air Conditioning issues.. 
Loved the music they played and overall ambiance was good. 
Maybe, we can try once again when their microbrewery is operational.

Dunno why Zomato has listed this place into microbrewery section. The brewery service hasn't started and your miss guiding people.

Make sure you guys carry Cash when you go to this place. When you ask them if they accept cards the answer you'll get will be YES but the moment you ask them to pay by card they'll start giving out lame reasons.

The music in this place is a mess. Speakers are not placed properly and the DJ will play with the full volume when your the only one inside.

Not worth trying.

It seems like all the new eateries in Kolkata belong to the same segment- hookah+lounge+music! This is one of those, with the added benefit of it serving quite an extensive menu. 
Went to The Brewmaster last weekend with my hubby. Its located on the ground floor of the building opposite Rdb. 
Its newly opened hence all the liqour brands weren't available on the day of our visit. 
Its a beautiful place with live dj music n a dance floor. Nive ambience. 
We had ordered Sphagetti which was great. Yummy! 
The butter naan was soft, paneer tikka masala was full of masala n yummy too! 
We availed thr 2-for-1 offer on drinks n ordered whiskey. Service was prompt, waiters were attentive. 

The music in this place, though extremely good, was quite loud n we found it impossible to talk to each other 🙁. It starts grating on your nerves after some time. 
But if you are in a large group, you can surely visit this place n enjoy tasty food along with some dance n music
May visit here again with a large group next time!!

Will be waiting for it to start & will visit again
That day we only ordered for a shisha & food
Shisha - like any other pub was nice
Food - we ordered for American corn - which was very different from other restaurants.
Like everywhere, i had expected here also to be in a normal size - like small corn types but here its like in huge size
Atleast for 3 people 😃 - it was tasty though but too heavy

The brewmaster Kolkata is nothing like the one in Ludhiana or anywhere else you'd ever visited.. these guys don't yet have the license for freshly brewed or atleast that's what they'll tell you... 
Their most unique USP !  Freshly brewed beer is not available !! God knows why did are they open !! 
I don't know I mean... With regards to the sardarji (am sure the owner is from Punjab) who thought of opening the pub in Kolkata.. my first visit here was pretty much unsatisfactory... 
Regards.

Visited this place last week.. the home brewed beer was not available yet.. so we had the long island iced tea.. calamari peri peri(which was not upto my expectations) and anglio olio chicken tikka( yumm yumm yumm).
Bollywood and international music was on and there is a dance floor as well if you wanna shake a leg.. they have 2:1 on liquor at happy hours and hookah is also available.. we also received complementary shooters.. the staff was helpful and courteous.. overall a great place.. deducting a point coz the home brewed beer was not available.
Will definitely visit this place again though..
