Ordered items from here via Zomato as well as Swiggy.

The packing is good...Items like sambar, vada re packed in metallic film pouches. Normally served hot.

Taste was ok for the items which I tried - uttapam, vada sambhar, plain dosa etc.

Small south Indian food joint ,located just opposite ajantha cinema hall .ordered one  butter plain dosa and one cheese plain dosa .. while food was average , the dosas were infested with  dead ants .not the kind of non veg I m into. Coconut chutney was little stale.so thumbs down for hygiene and freshness.

We opted for home-delivery from this restaurant and this review is restricted to this part only. We liked the packaging as well as the delivery person's behavior. Coming to food, we ordered for uttapam and idly. The uttapam tasted perfect and the portion size is more than sufficient for a hungry soul. Sambar and chutney were well made and complemented the main dish. the idly was good too. Notably, the prices of the items are quite reasonable while the quality and quantity both were pretty good. We will definitely try this place again to satisfy our South Indian food cravings.

Delivery boy was worse. Don't understand any language. I had to give my location a 100 times. 
Still was arguing when he came to deliver the order.
And all the meal got mixed up because the plastic was torn.
Very very poor service.

Situated opposite to Ajanta cinema. Due to its small space I decided to take parcel which included 3 masala dosa. All the items were properly packed. It was good in taste but the potato stuff could have been tastier.

Well one of the best south indian outlets in the locality. Small place,can accommodate around 10-15 persons. But the food here is delicious. Onion masala dosa is the stand out dish. And the prices are really pocket friendly. A place for snacks u can rely on.

So it was south Indian food...Not much to write about as it was home delivery so not aware of the ambience and behaviour of the staffs. However , the guy who came for delivery was polite and humble. Coming to the food, we ordered 3 masala dosas only. The dosas were perfectly cooked along with sufficient stuffing inside. The chutneys and sambhars that were served along with the dosas were also of abundant quantity. Food tastes good. The only con I found was the presence of onion in the stuffing was way to much. Otherwise , nice experience. Looking forward to order some medu vada and cheese dosa soon.. thank you.

The name of the restaurant just might trick you into stepping in but it tastes nothing like south indian...be it dosa, uttapam, idli, wada, sambhar or chutni....everything was of poor taste and quality....please avoid it if you are looking for an authentic south indian food

Well for some reason every time I have food from here, I fall sick. The quality is really questionable as it has happened to some other people also.The taste is definitely not very exceptional. Not recommend.

I have rated them 4.5 instead of 5 only for the presentation part. Otherwise its a nice small cozy and pocket friendly eatery. Staffs are really well behaved and at your service. I had ordered for Cheese Masala Dosa and Lassi which was really good in taste and cooked perfectly, though sambar was not that great. They also home deliver in the nearby areas, that too free of cost with no minimum order amount. I loved the place personally, will visit again whenever I crave for South Indian cuisine.

I ordered combo 2 with masala dosha with customise extra butter.
Just waooo. Best taste I ever had in recent time in south Indian food. Very nice less oil prepare. They served very well with foils and tresing paper with heavy quantity.
Thanks for such a nice delivery. Great going...
So... Chennai Express rocks.

The masala dosa was pretty good but the chutney was received as stale. We could not eat the chutney properly as there was coming smell. The restaurant needs to be better in the quality of food.

Although I have never visited the restaurant but I have ordered food quite a lot of time. The quality of food has been deteriorating with every order. 
Once I ordered for cheese masala dosa, and I received plain masala dosa. Upon raising a query, the restaurant told that due to high temperature the cheese would have melted. The question what arises here is that even after melting the cheese should have appeared, if not visually, then atleast in taste. 
Anyways, I ordered for masala dosa again after few days and it was not upto the mark. The dosa was sour as if the ingredients have fermented more than what is required.

Located on the lane exactly opposite Ajanta cinema hall adjacent to Marufaz..Went for some work over there and by the time I was done, I felt hungry..Now as I came across this new corner, I felt I should give it a go. I ain't that much of a fan when it comes to south Indian dishes but I just went to explore the corner..One of my frnd ordered dhaniya dosa and I ordered onion masala dosa..The service was quick and spontaneous...The quality and quant was very good and I say it without a doubt its one of the very best veg restaurant in behala region...Space is on the lower side that accommodates 12-15 ppl at a time.

I ordered Cheese Masala Dosa from this place.The amount of cheese was very less and it tasted like a normal Masala Dosa.The coconut chutney could have been thicker.I don't know about the ambience as I ordered the food from Swiggy.

Chennai Xpress, a place where I wasn't really expecting to get impressed much but I was delightfully proved wrong. 

So I ordered in Sada Vada today, allow me to tell you that the packing of the item and its elements were done well and neat.

The vada was delicious. It was light, fluffy and of just the right colour. The coconut chutney given was of the right consistency. The sambar, amazing. 

But what really impressed me was the tomato chutney that was I was served. Not all South Indian restaurants serve this. So when you get it, that too at the rate of forty bucks, it feels pretty good. And if you have to ask me about its flavour, let me tell you that it was very well done. Three point five points to this place!
