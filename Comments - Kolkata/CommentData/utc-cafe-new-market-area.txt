Worst cafe ever visited. I've visited a lot of cafe and I am not the kind of person who gives review, but I am compelled to give for this one. They haven't given their menu on zomato, the menu card is very much different from the one given and only 10% of the item given in the menu are actually available for you to order. We ordered pasta, nachos, mojito, brownie shake, none of which were available. Finally we just ordered 2 cold coffee (thankfully which was available), overpriced, 160 plus tax for a cold Coffee which wasn't worth 60 bucks plus you have to wait for 45 mins just to get this amazing coffee. The staffs are equally amazing.

Had been in this place 2-3 months ago and had Chinese but the foods were disgusting in taste and less in quantities , staffs were OK not very good at their service, the rooftop of hotel aura was the location of the cafe so it was good place for dinner not lunch at all. THE plates and spoons were very dirty too so not recommended anyone
