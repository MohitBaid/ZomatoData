Dreamland restaurant has redone itself. Become more classier and welcoming specially towards the younger generation. The ground floor restaurant is the only place where ladies are allowed, so makes it more secure. The drinks are reasonable, the quality of food has improved tremendously. The only flaw is that they use the same kind of sauce for all kinds of main course dishes even the starters. Other than that, everything is excellent. Place has improved by leaps and bounds, which includes the ambiance also. College going students should visit this place. Recommended!

Any person from St Xavier's knows the importance of this place. After the hectic days with all sorts of pressure this place is one hell of a stress remover. Food is amazing here , but the main attraction is drinks at a very reasonable price. But don't forget to carry your ID. XD

One of the simplest and most cost effective eateries in Park St., Dreamland Restaurant & Bar has two distinct facades. In the afternoon one can find thaali meals, which is quite good and economical. But climb a flight of stairs and you will reach the bar - restaurant segment. 

The restaurant offers good simple food, but do not experience much in this regard. Recommended dishes are - Chicken chowmein, Chicken Schezwan, Chicken Pokora and Chicken Fry. When it comes to drinks, this place is much more cost effective compared to nearby bars. 

But that is all their is, Dreamland is your simple average eatery which has work-at-front-party-at-back outlook. Expect simple food and cheap drinks, nothing more.

It was quite affordable, specially for a bar and restaurant being in a Park Street area.
Ambience was not bad.

If u r not bothered of ambience , jst want to hv some booze nd boost up urslf, then u cn try this restaurant. U cn chilax here nd fresh ur mood wid a can of chilled beer or a bottle of ur fvrt alcohol accompanied wid a crispy nd spicy side dish in an absolutely pocket friendly price. Besides the alcohol we hv ordered here dry chilly chicken , chicken tandoori and egg chop which were nice in taste nd enough in quantity. More over it must nt be a perfect dinning place bt it is a good option fr boozing in low budget wid good foods.

On 19th May 2017 I Visited This Place Dreamland Restaurant & Bar, Park Street Area For The 6th Time. And I Ordered 1 Plate Paneer Butter Masala For Rs. 150/- And 1 Plate Chicken Do Piaza For Rs. 150/- As Well. With Container Charges Rs. 5/- Each. We Ate These Sabji's With Leftover Rice At My Office Room No. 27 For Lunch. And Then I Kept Some Sabji For My Home Dinner And I Ate It With Roti's As Well. Thank you Dreamland Restaurant & Bar For Making Our Day Fabulous.

Knowing this place since 2007 when got admitted to college.. It has served as our saviour during late hours in college with its takeaway rolls or the super affordable multi cuisine food.. Taste was not great but good n quantity enough for 2 people.. What else students can ask for within their pocket money.. After completing college in 2010, spotted it again in late 2011 when it turned to a bar cum restaurant.. N comparing the price of alcohol n the Food options available it soon became one of our favourite.. It still continues to serve alcohols at a much lesser price than most of the other bars in Park Street. We never miss out on dry chilli fish n chicken lollypop tossed in sauce over here.. 
. Ambience is just nothing special . Previously only students used to visit, after getting a bit fame as a bar, people of older age group is also visiting for affordable alcohol, which according to me has disturbed the student favourite ambience a bit.. But it continues to be my n my group's favourite joint and have celebrated many occasions out here n continue to do so..

An unknown place to many, hidden in one of lanes of park street well to the opposite of xaviers(rafi ahmed kidwai road). So on the eve of christmas where people were fighting for booze spots my group quietly headed for dreamland since we expected to get our sits easily & in fact we did manage to get a table for 6 with ease without any waiting delay.

Dreamland has both dining cum bar facility. Ground floor is for family section while the upper section is primarily for booze. The ambience is like any other bar where people were enjoying the hustle-bustle of xmas with their booze.

So we quickly placed the following items:-

1. 1 tuborg & 3 carlsberg

2. Crispy chilli babycorn- A plate of crispy babycorn served with fried onions & capsicums. Tastewise it was good & the babycorn had a good crisp upon every bite.

3. Mutton biriyani- This was taken by our friend. It had an egg, medium sized chunk of mutton & a potato. The quantity looked a bit on the lower side in my opinion but it was thoroughly enjoyed by our friend.

4. Chicken friedrice- Normal usual chicken rice which was very average. The quantity was ok for a person.

5. Chicken chow- Same as the rice item.

6. Chilli chicken- This was surprisingly good. It had 8pcs but the size of the chicken were uneven. The chickens were tasty & was nicely cooked. We ended up ordering another plate of it.

The service was good considering the rush. The pocket pinch was standard. They charge vat & service tax separately. So overall if you are looking to avoid the rush of olypub,magnolia etc you could try this place for a change.

Mostly known as the shady college student bar, it is a hub for most people looking for food and conversation and alcohol at a cheap place. Ambience and stuff must not be considered, dreamland is park street shady bar nostalgia. And im rating it a five for the memories and nothing more. Thats all

This restaurant is located in park Street 7mins walking distance from the metro station.. It's a bar cum restaurant....good place for friends meet up..we ordered fish fry and chicken lollipop... Chicken lollipop was very delicious bt did not liked the fish fry.. The main disadvantage of this place it's decoration...I personally think a proper decoration is needed....tasty food and good decoration are the basic criteria of a good restaurant.

Great economic place to grab a Beer after work - complimentary Chanachur they serve is really tasty - dimly lit - hygienic ambience - courteous & friendly stewards - food preparations are generally on hot-n-spicy note though...

Recommend for those evening hang-outs when you don't want to spend too much at fancy joints on Park Street yet relish your food & drinks over casual chit-chats !!!

Not  much  ambiance  here , but  good value  for money , one have to admit .

went  there  with  my friends on  a february evening  & Wasn't disappointed. 

Old  monk  large  peg  ( 60 ml ) would cost you around 85  , which is a fair  deal  , given the prices of  newly  opened lounges  &  bars , it is rather affordable. Food  is  good  too , if you know  what to choose .

Good place for  adda addicts  . make  sure you  go  there in a  group  of 5  or more , to  enjoy   to  the  limit  .

Coming  to  the  bill  .

2X (60 ml ) Old monk : 85 X 2 = Rs 170
1X (30ml ) Old monk  : 50 X  1 = Rs 50
3X (200ml ) cold drink : 30 X 3  = Rs 90
2X (650 ml ) Heineken : 190 X 2 = Rs 380
1 plate fish finger (6 pcs) : 150 X 1 = Rs 150
1 plate Chilli Fish  ( 6 pcs) : 170 X 1 = Rs 170 
-----------------------------------------------------------                                                      = Rs 1010  + Tax 
                                                    = Rs 1070

Hic ! hic  !

Dreamland isn't exactly as brilliant the name suggests but it isn't bad either. What I mean is, if you're a student - or you're in your mid-20s with a light wallet or purse, Dreamland fits the bill. I don't drink much, if at all, but my friends who frequent this place (because it's right next to college) swear by their alcohol. I've been led to believe it's because of their prices - and their nonchalant attitude towards the drinking age. The decor is nothing special, and quite frankly if you're with friends, you won't care. The service is a little slow, although the staff are very friendly. You never know, you might see them drinking out of a bottle from the reception desk.

As far as the food is concerned, it's standard. It's all edible and it's all cheap. There never was an eatery quite so perfectly made for a college-goer. Nor one so perfectly placed. It's easy enough to locate. As far as the entire package goes, it's far better than Olypub - which to be honest, has seen a major decline in standards. 

Chinese - Standard and cheap. Nothing fancy, nothing inedible.
Mughlai - Standard. Their biryani is a little on the oilier side though.
North Indian - Probably the best option because their Kebabs are nice and succulent. Priced reasonably.

I haven't come here too often, twice, maybe thrice. But the word is that they'll give you enough at an eye-catching rate to make sure you come back.

Update (7/6/16): Food has gotten better, and the staff are more courteous. Problem was the restroom facilities -- no water. Alcohol was fine, and their service has improved. The place looks cleaner too. Pricing is similar, and great value for money.

Ambience/Interior: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Food: 3.5/5
Value for Money: 3.5/5

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made. :)

Located near Bata More , Royd Street. 
Opposite ICICI Bank.
Ambience is nice . Not much of any kind of decor present. Food was good ordered Chicken Gravy Noodles , Chicken Pakora & Imperial Blue for a friend of mine who tagged along with me. Staff are friendly. Had a good time.

It will be easier for people if you provide the bar menu in zomato...so that people can get an idea about the price if alcohol ...many people have reviewed it as pocket friendly....but it will be easier if we get to know the exact price

Dreamland isn't exactly as brilliant the name suggests but it isn't bad either. What I mean is, if you're a student - or you're in your mid-20s with a light wallet or purse, Dreamland fits the bill. I don't drink much, if at all, but my friends who frequent this place (because it's right next to college) swear by their alcohol. I've been led to believe it's because of their prices - and their nonchalant attitude towards the drinking age. The decor is nothing special, and quite frankly if you're with friends, you won't care. The service is a little slow, although the staff are very friendly. You never know, you might see them drinking out of a bottle from the reception desk.

As far as the food is concerned, it's standard. It's all edible and it's all cheap. There never was an eatery quite so perfectly made for a college-goer. Nor one so perfectly placed. It's easy enough to locate. As far as the entire package goes, it's far better than Olypub - which to be honest, has seen a major decline in standards. 

Chinese - Standard and cheap. Nothing fancy, nothing inedible.
Mughlai - Standard. Their biryani is a little on the oilier side though.
North Indian - Probably the best option because their Kebabs are nice and succulent. Priced reasonably.

I haven't come here too often, twice, maybe thrice. But the word is that they'll give you enough at an eye-catching rate to make sure you come back.

Update (7/6/16): Food has gotten better, and the staff are more courteous. Problem was the restroom facilities -- no water. Alcohol was fine, and their service has improved. The place looks cleaner too. Pricing is similar, and great value for money.

Ambience/Interior: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Food: 3.5/5
Value for Money: 3.5/5

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made. :)

Location: It's one of the hottest destination for park street office goers, being located near to St. Xavier's college just opposite Madhya Shikha parshadoffice and beside sandvik.
Food: Typical Bengali home style. Rice, dal, fish,alu bhaaja, chicken, mutton, chutney.
Price: Quite reasonable, though the price has been hiked after recent renovations of the place.

Dreamland. Sigh! What do I say about this place? I call this place my third home, St. Xavier's being second. It has been there for me whenever I have been hungry while in college. Be it bunking classes and chilling at Dreamland or be it having a scrumptious meal to satisfy our hunger, dreamland has always been the place to go to.  Located at Park Street-Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road Crossing, it is a favourite amonsgt College students of the area (St. Xavier's/Loreto) and also office goers. 

This place smells of nostalgia. From having my first beer with friends while in college right over here to coming here almost every other day for a doze of desi chinese. Dreamland and I, go a long long way. This place has always been a savior, be it when I wanted to cry, laugh, drink, eat, grumble, plan college fests, fight, or simply when I needed peace. 

Both Indian and Chinese are good here. More points to chinese ofcourse. Just a note to fellow foodies- this is a very simple, air-conditioned, no-frills restaurant which has a seperate dining area for the smokers. It is an ideal place for simple people who look for an affordable dining experience with friends and loved ones accompanied by alcohol. After a long tiring day, one can sit here with a beer or maybe a vodka/whiskey/scotch along with any of their starters and have a heart-to-heart with their bestie. Their staff are couteous and well behaved. I like their Chinese better and mostly go for a crispy chiken or a pan fried chilli fish (sometimes both) to accompany my beer/vodka. Go there if you aren't the "only posh places" type. This place will always make me happy. Even if college is over, my connection with Dreamland would stay forever.
Would be happy if they work on their renovation plans.

Bon Appétit

A good alternative whenever Oly Pub turns us down (which happens pretty often), we head straight to this place where just like Oly, drinks are tad cheap and food is decent! They make good Chinese rice and noodles. For sideys with alcohol, try their semi gravy chilly chicken or ginger chicken! Now now I have let a secret out bet next time around you'll crowd around Dreamland and I won't get a seat huh! ;-)

Pros:- 

Kabab was good and juicy
fish finger was also good..
Drinks are also cheap with ac seating arrangement.

Cons:- 

Waiters please rise up. We are customers and we are always looking for you.We dont have to go to the service desk again and again and ask for someone.

Chili chiken was pathetic.

A very reasonable place for college-goers like me,bang in park street!
The place is a no-frills one with basic air-conditioned interiors.
A variety of dishes are on offer,though i've tried their kebabs as snacks and they are pretty good given the price.The tikka kebab is especially spicy amd yum.
The booze is unbelievably cheap as well( it is remarkable that the place is NOT creepy for a girl,contrary to what i have come to expect from cheap booze bars where they admit all sorts of people).
Also,the prices,including that of the liquors,are inclusive of taxes,with just a 4.94% sevice tax extra levied.
This is the kind of place to go if you are aching for some fun but light on your pockets.

A small place which doesn't look inviting from the outside. But the food is very satisfactory as it feels like you are at home. The service is excellent and it is a very old and famous place among the regulars. Very pocket-friendly but definitely not recommended for the hygiene nazis.

I love this place from my childhood days.. Its very reasonable on your pocket and the taste is pretty nice. I have never tried their bengali menu and have always opted for their noth indian and chinese which is pretty good considering the price at which they offer. They have recently changed their top seating area into a closed room otherwise that was my favorite hangout as there were few tables with an open terrace like feel. I am in love with some of their dishes which are
Fish Finger :Crispy fingers with good amount of fish and less of coating
Chicken Reshmi Kebab : Soft juicy chicken pieces cooked to perfection.
Malai Kofta : The best malai kofta I have ever had in Kolkata
Masala Kulcha :Soft paratha with generous amount of filling. Worth the price
Chicken Bharta : The gravy is nice and mild.
Veg Hot Sour Soup: I find this soup exceptional over here. They do not put much of soy sauce neither it is too spicy its got a nice different flavor which I am fond of.

I love love love this place. Its like a hidden paradise in Kolkata's culinary map. We used to go there from college, completely broke and scrambling for change notes in our pockets when the bill arrived. But it never pinched our pockets. The food is cheap, simple, unpretentious and mighty tasty!

This place is definitely a thing from my past - we used to go there a lot when we were all broke, and ordered the chicken hakka noodles and/or gravy chowmien, and a nice side dish like chilli chicken. 

you would also get indian food here, and the quality of the food is quite good. although the place is super-crowded during lunch hour, it is still worth packing some food back for the family to gorge on. Recently I went there and packed away the chow and chicken, and realized that the taste was the same, and the quantity was good for the price. A lovely place if you are on a budget and want to go eat filling, tasty food.
