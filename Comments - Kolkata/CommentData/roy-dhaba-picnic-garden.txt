My early order was full of oil and oil which had least hint of restaurant preparation. But still was commendable.
This time it was a fulltoo bakwas chicken biryaniüò¨üò¨üò¨ .Would you believe, the rice was miniket rice. It was prepared like fried rice. Too much of black pepper was in the biryani. No hint of biryani taste. 
Just the size of the piece of chicken was really good which was a piece of wing. üçóüçó
Rest was awful. Even some shops near ruby hospital deliver awesome biryani at a less price.

Dhaba manager should look into these things.

Review update - Had given them much better rating earlier but after ordering for couple of times I have realized that they cant get anything right.. doing deliveries for them is like moving mountains because they would promise you that they will deliver and then after one hour refuse to deliver because suddenly place became too far for them.. Also they act like crooks because I ordered same things on three consequtive days. The first day there was not container charge and the dish was for 50. The next day they added container charge. The third day even though on menu dish is for 50 they charged me 70 for dish and container charge. Long and short of it they just cant be trusted and no one should order from them

___________________________________Previous review___________________________

                        Ordered ¬†food last night from this place. The first thing that pulled me towards the restaurant were obviously the steal deal prices. This is one of those places where you can have one wholesome meal for less than 150 delivered to your place and tax burden included. So, against my better judgement I did decide to give it a try. I ordered a butter naan (25), butter roomali roti (12) and butter paneer (90).¬†

Now although they did take a lot of time (1.5 hrs) to deliver the food and it was not hot when it was delivered, yet the quality of food was satisfactory. I did enjoy the meal and the taste was as good as a north Indian restaurant. They definitely need to improve on their service quality and make sure food is delivered hot. Rest everything was upto the level. Since, it was a first time and owner assured me that it wouldnt happen again, I will give them another chance and giving them a rating of 3.5.

This gives you guys a bad name (ZOMATO). I hope some stern  action is taken... how did they even accept my order in the first place if they were going to cancel it...

I have a mixed feeling about this place. Its one of those small,non-ac 'jalpan' stops that cater veg or.non veg meals mostly, but also has a few other items available. The seating arrangement is okay and people from varied occupations seat together.However if home delivery order is placed,the items like egg tarka or chana paneer or egg masala are delivered in a very small container.Although the price is economical,the above items costing 50,80 and 40 respectively, the quantity is rather disappointing. They will do good to increase the price a bit but deliver a more satisfying proportion.
