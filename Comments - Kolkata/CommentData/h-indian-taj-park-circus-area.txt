Nice food...
I ordered for chicken reshmi kebab, mutton Britain n some tandoori butter naam.. the kebab was really good.. completely tender n well cooked.. biryani was not bad either. Price and quantity was reasonable..

Being a new restaurant, it's seems to b doing good..
Cheers to H-indian taj...
