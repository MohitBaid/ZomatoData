In very short I can say absolutely not upto the mark. Disappointed. There are many items on the menu but 30% of them are not available. Typical type of environment. Not worth going.

One of d worst restuarent I hv visited recently. It was a Sunday so we knew we hv to wait as dere was a long queue.And after waiting for almost 1.5hrs we got the table.And what we hv seen lights were switched off.We were 9 people and we hv got d table for 6only and dey said u hv to adjust.We pay for our food so hw dey can expect dis from us.I know it's a Sunday dere was a rush all d staffs were in a hurry.But dere is a word called management and I think dey don't know dat. After dat we hv waited for our order for more den 45min and at last got d food which was not at all yum. Babycorn was soggy.Naan was not at all hot.Never ever go to dis restuarent on Sunday.

Notoriously good vegetarian fair. I must say that the food that they deliver is actually quite consistently tasty. The Dal Makhani is creamy, the sabji's are rich, rotis soft and the rice is fragrant. Generally decent food which is up to the mark in all respects. They also deliiver on time.

But I have to give you a word of caution, their packaging is .... not up to grade at all. The Thalis come in sealed packages which are atrociously hard to open. You can imagine yourself trying by hook and crook to open the Thali packaging, trying to get under thickly stuck plastic which just won't give way! It seems that they have bought some sophisticated equipment to package the Thalis but not trained their employees to use them satisfactorily. It is ridiculous and really takes away from the experience. So if you order Thalis from here, caveat emptor!

Their timings are also odd. I often find the restaurant as being "Currently unavailable" or "Not taking orders at the moment" when I want to order from them. They only start taking evening orders after 7 p.m. which is late compared to other restuarants! They were also randomly shut without any explanation for quite a few days in the last month.

These are things that stand in the way of this restaurant being one of my consistent picks for vegetarian Thalis in Salt Lake Sector 1. I still like ordering from here though, their good food isn't prejudiced by their poor management and I will likely order from here once in a while, at least.

So I went to this restaurant for my brother's birthday and I totally loved it. The restaurant is cozy and family friendly. A great option for vegetarians,  the atmosphere is fantastic and the staffs are cordial. We ordered Mexican sizzler(that too without onion and garlic. How great is that!)for starters and Amritsar kulcha, paneer makhani and hariyali something? for dinner and they were tasty, especially, the Mexican sizzler. It's decently prized and you get a generous amount for the prize.  I absolutely loved it and would recommend everyone to visit and if you're a vegetarian like me then you should definitely go there.

The first time I went there, when the restaurant had newly opened, the food was great and so was the service! But the next time, the food did not taste good at all and the servo was pathetically slow, and since the prices had also risen, I found it totally overpriced for the food and treatment!

Located above Namotsav, Saltlake city. Decor and Ambience is very cool. Green is predominant, from furniture, chairs, staff members as well as crockery. Food is hygienic. Quantity and quality both were good. We had ordered for Tomato Shorba and Manchow in Soup. Veg. Haka noodles, Fried rice, Machurian in Chinese Cuisine. Kebab platter in Starters. Watermelon Mojito, Fresh lime soda, and blue lagoon in beverages.

The Green Mark is a fabulous place to eat. The food is hygienic. Chinese sizzler is a big time yes. Daal makhni is out of the world. The sabzi could be a little not so spicy for the spice lovers but the starters are amazing be it tandoori alu, paneer tikka, gratine, etc. You can go multiple times and try new dishes each time. Though, the shop below may overcharge for dry fruits than what is prevalent in the market for the same quality.

I really don't care whatever be the quality of theother dishes are because whenever I want to have some veg thalis for some good dinner, ai always found this one reasonable than other outlets around. Just have a small complain regarding why they don't offer daal or daahi in thalis. Besides that nice experience I cherished with you guys and with some good nourishing meals.

Just finished our lunch for 3. Excellent ambience, friendly people, and most importantly Good Food. It lives up to its name of veg restaurant. Intact on ordering , they even asked if it can have Garlic and Onions. We decided against it , so a food without garlic and onions and we're wondering how it would taste. It was really tasty. We ordered masala kulcha, paneer capsicum and peas polou. Total bill for 3 was around 800rs. Quantity was sufficient. 
Booked our table through Zomato. Thanks to The Green Mark for food and Zomato to help me choose this one.

The thing I would like to mention is their sense of decency, courtesy and efficient packaging and delivery. The delivery man politely apologised for being late in delivering the ordered food - though I found it had arrived on time indeed!
Also the food came parcelled neatly in an attractive looking box and the items were intact inside.
Coming to the food, had ordered Masala Kulcha and Paneer Chatpata via Zomato.
The kulcha was one of the nicest I've tasted, soft and stuffed with delicious filling.
The paneer - diced cottage cheese cooked in a tempting looking red gravy with "chatpata" masala - was flavorsome as well.
Vegetarians and foodies do check out The Green Mark if you haven't already. 👍👌

Since we have mandatory veg special days, we went there one such saturday and had our plate of masala kulcha with shahi paneer & daal makhani. Zeera rice was awesome and ended with fresh lime soda for the day. Undoubtedly recommended to all veggies.

The Green Mark is a pure veg restaurant located near CA island on the first floor above Namotsav. We went there on a Thursday night. The place was quite empty       As soon as you enter the place gives you a decent vibe with the interior that's not too much flashy. We got seated immediately and since It was a bit late we decided to go with the main course only. We ordered masala kulcha, Dal Makhani, tarkari masla (mix veg) and jeera rice along with couple of lemonades. Lemonades were bad. Portions of main course were quite small. Dal Makhani was good but not the mix veg. It lacked the veggies and only stuff we could taste were peas and beans in tomato sauce. Masala kulchas get 5/5 - though the stuffing was not sufficient but they were really crispy and nicely made. Jeera rice was very ordinary as usual. Service was quick. Staff was ok, we were the last Ones to leave so they sort of hurried a bit towards the end. Prices are affordable.

The place is very near to City Centre 1 in Saltlake. Was there last Saturday with my fiance as it was a day for Veg and I was thinking of trying out this place for a long time. 

It's a great place. The decor and ambience is very cool. Green Mark takes the whole green thing very seriously, like from the furniture to the staff uniform, Green Is Predominant. 

Coming to the food , The Achari Paneer Tikka, The Chilli Baby Corn as starters were amazing. The quantity and taste was beautiful. Veg food tasting so good is a pleasant surprise. 

Now coming to the Main course, the food is tasty to the core. We had Pindi Chana, Paneer Jhalfreizi and Garlic Nan. All the dishes are great. I loved each of the items. 

The service is great. I had a great time and experience here.

This place is located near CA island, also its opposite my work place! I've only tried the North Indian food- paneer butter masala, kaali daal and garlic naan. Till date it hasn't failed in its taste, it's been consistent. The South Indian dishes are also good, the idli, dosa are the favourites in my office. The ambience is good, although I've only done take away from there, the service is good, the manager upstairs is very friendly, the staff there are also very friendly! A must try and it's located above Namostav.

It's located near CA island. Huge. Lovely ambiance. Friendly staff. We went during the afternoon and ordered a few Cheese Masala Dosa, Onion Butter Masala Dosa and Dahi Vada. Service is a bit slow. The dosas were very filling but not upto the mark. Since I recently visited Banana Leaf, I was disappointed by the taste of dosas at the Green Mark. But all the dips were awesome and served in huge quantities. The sabji, sambar, coconut chutney, everything were delicious. I personally loved the onion dosa and the dahi vada the most. In cheese dosa I was expecting some molten cheese inside but found none. Looked like they mixed a little cheese with the batter itself. Overall a lovely experience.

We went there last Sunday, there menu include range of north indian, south indian and chat food. Theyvalso serve thali for individual meals. The ambience is okay, spaceous. I think staff needs to be more trained. They also serve jain food. In terms of taste I would give three out of five.

Managed n owned by Kolkata's top caterer. None can have any doubt after this fact. Outside decor n chamak dhamak at night are gr8. It was easy to get a table even on a Sunday at around 7:30 pm. This restaurant is followed by good ambience n nice interiors as table size was somewhat small n the best it was having one CHARGING POINT at each table.

To sip we ordered Munchow soup which was awesome, Pesto soup as similar as Tomato soup vut with extra sugar n Virgin Mojito was too tasty with flavour of Pudhiba.

To eat we ordered Tarkari masaledar n dal makhani which were gr8. In bread section we ordered varities of Kulcha which was good n its special GREEN MARK KULCHA was also gr8. One must try is Italian CHEESE FONDUE which was tooo delicious n tasty.

The restaurant is not expensive at all. It is also well suited for middle class people. Service was good n honest as they gave prior intimation it would be difficult to reach the last person seating at a table which is one side open.

We came here for lunch on a hot and humid Sunday. Seating was aplenty and it wasn't difficult to get a table. We ordered The Green Mark Platter, Mexican sizzler and masala papad to munch along. To sip we asked for vegetable raita, sweet lime soda and a mocktail. The portions were decent, though I felt that the quality of food could be better. The platter has a variety to offer and tasted good, the sizzler was also decent. The masala papad was served differently, the veggies and papad were served separately so that the papad didn't turn soggy. The raita was also appreciated by all. The only major letdown was the mocktail which was too sweet. The service was prompt and the staff was on its feet. Overall a decent dining experience.
