Ordered dinner from here via swiggy and the food arrived right on time with good packaging. I ordered for kaju kismis pulao and dhonepata kanchakanka bata murgi. Though not extraordinary, it was very well prepared. Also don't forget to try their baked mihidana with rabdi from dessert section.

The food here is amazing! Definitely ordering from here again.

I have ordered from here via Swiggy today. The Chicken Keema Pulao is very similar as chicken biriyani, only the chicken pieces are small keema pieces, also the quantity is very less, nothing special in it. And the Kasha Murgi is good, tasty but the chicken pieces are very small and the gravy is very very rich and oily. The Murgh Puli Pitha is good and tasty. And the Baked Mihidana with Rabri is really awesome tasty.

I went this place on 28th Septemver of 2017. I ordered mutton biryani (parcel). It costed 145. 1st thing about biryani is it tasted like other cheap roadside biryani costs 70-90. 2nd thing the mutton piece was not cooked well and barely chewable. We are human not dogs. Aloo was not good at all. Rice was full of oil and tasteless. I don't know why you guys gave your restaurant a pemium look when the food is below poor quality. I came here eralier ordered their basnti pulao and kosha mangsho which was average by taste and too expensive buy quantity. I'm not going there anymore and won't recommend anyone.

A food joint with a nostalgic essence of our gastronomic past! The price being within a reasonable margin doesn't necessarily compromise with the quality. Loved it!

In search of an authentic bengali Mahalaya lunch in
Office, we picked up Darchini suggested by a colleague which supposedly specialises in Bengali cuisines. The menu included Basanti Polao priced at 100 for a plate and Murgir Ghee Roast priced at 165 a plate which came with 4 pieces. The prices are quite on the cheaper side but so is the food. Their Basanti polao , though sufficient in amount tasted quite dull and too sweet and I would like to mention the lack of kaju and kishmish in the rice which are the fundamental jewels of a good polao. The chicken was even worse, too small pieces, too hard to chew which I solemnly swear had 'Ghee' only in its name and not in real, tasted too ordinary. Overall Darchini was not an experience which will let me want to try them out ever again.

I had ordered from food panda from this restaurant. I ordered basanti polao, chicken keema polao and chicke kasha!
The price was decently pocket friendly ! Delivered right on time to my doorstep! 
Food and quantity and quality at that price is 5/5 from me! 
Keep up the good work!

We were looking for a food outlet anywhere near Lake Town, walked all the way down Kalindi and bumped into this place. The name of the outlet grabbed our attention and we ordered a plate of chicken pakora (you may find some fancy name for it in the menu card but honestly it was absolutely nothing more than the lame chicken pakoras or chicken balls, boneless though). When the food got served, to our awe we kept staring at those eight tennis-ball sized chicken pakoras, that cost us a mighty 100 bucks. And moreover, they did not taste any different than the regular pakoras. I would suggest people not to get deceived by the classy look of this place, its an eatery and not a gift shop. Looking for good affordable food, this place is a strict NO!

Taste and quality  of the food  is really  good.  Specially  basonti  polau , chicken  is really  a great  combination.  Two  people  can  easily  share  one  dish. Within  everyone's budget.

Ordered evening snacks from this place on 21st May 2017 as there was a 10% off going on their swiggy handle.List of items seemed interesting and we ordered the  following things:
1. Fish fingers
2. Dimer Devil
3. Gondhoraj Mangsher Chop
4. Rabri with mihidana baked.
Swiggy delivery was fast and no complains regarding that.Now coming to the food.One word to describe it was a disaster.The mangsher chop was stale and smelled pretty bad.the fish finger was low on salt and lacked taste so was the dimer devil only difference is that it had a little bit more salt.The desert oh it was so bad that words fail me.It tasted sour and the texture was that of crumbly chena(or cottage cheese) .Over all a very bad experience with this place.All they have got are the fancy names for not so fancy food.Though the menu attracted me and I was contemplating on ordering again soon but this was well before my order arrived home.I will not make the blunder of doing so again and wasting the money.Here is my small caution for the prospective people wanting to order from this place: oder only if you have a gut strong enough to digest stale food!

I tried their mutton kasha through home delivery. The preparation was good but the quality of the mutton was superb.
I have not tried any other item but looking forward to taste those soon.

Tried the snacks here. Gondhoraj mangsher chop is a standout. Rest are also good but this specific item will blow your mind away. Looking forward to taste other items listed here.

With Huge expectations ordered through Swiggy, 8 pieces of Bhetki Paturi and 2 plates of Chicken Dhonepata with kachalanka, But the most unfortunate part is the size of the each pieces, I have never seen and ate this kind of tiny Paturi and chicken pieces are the tiniest, I have shelled out approx 1200 Bucks for it ! I made bad investment. Hugely disappointed and feeling robbed, No way it should cost more than 500 Rs, the quantity they gave, Food lovers beware of the size and quantity of this outlet. It was so embarrassing in front of those people for whom I ordered.

One of the best food I had in recent past. I ordered online and hence didn't get the chance to personally visit the place but so far as food is concerned is awesome. Ordered for Chicken keema polao, fish fry, Dhonepata kachalanka Murgi, baked mihidana with rabri.  The fry had pure bhetki in it with a single crumb and hence every bite talks of the quality fish in it. The Dhonepata kachalanka Murgi was not at all spicy but has its own special taste of the blend. The chicken was well cooked. Keema was only in the name but it is not the dust in the name of keema. It has small pieces of chicken. Last but not the list the dessert. The blanket of rabri on the underlying baked mihidana is tempting not only in looks but when the two marries each other the result gives a "more to have" feelings. In short will order again to enjoy the delicacy.

Small outlet with sitting arrangement for 6 person approx. This is more of a take away joint. The quality of food is excellent ! The fish items are pure Kolkata bhetki with great taste( fish finger in particular) . The basanti pulao and mutton combo is all good so is dhokar dalna .
Recommended eatery and they accept party order to...!
Good going !

The outlet is small and has a sitting arrangement for 6 person approx. So plan accordingly, preferably for a takeaway. The menu is very interesting,since it targets evening snacks and dinner. The items are really innovative plus a few traditional ones. Till now tasted murgi r puli and dimer devil, both reflected the quality in general. Will surely try the other items as well. Keep the good work going and it would turn out to be a hidden gem soon!

So far so good. This is turning out to be a good takeaway joint serving Bengali cuisine. The menu, though short, keeps its promise. The Baked Mihidana was surprisingly good. Hopefully the quality remains with time and gets better.

Good food at really affordable price. Tried their pulao, mutton and chicken. Chicken preparation was average. But both mutton and pulao preparations were really good.
