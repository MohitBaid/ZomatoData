Had visited this place during Durga puja and though the seating space is not that big I still prefer this place because of the Desi Indian food they serve .
I love the breads and the chicken dishes they have which you will absolutely love .
My personal favorite is Chicken Dopiyaza here and k recommend you to try this item.

It was a late night dinner nd thankfully this place caters to the midnight crowd.. Had a decent meal of Mutton Do Piaza, Mutton Masala Tandoori Rotiand Nun.. 2 pieces each of succulent mutton pieces with bone.. It was tasty.. The nun was soft and the tandoori roti was crispy... I liked the mutton masala more as it had a sweet nuance... And had a garnish of cream which i prefer.. Overall nice place for a late night dinner

This dhaba has been sorts of a legend for so many years for the people of Kolkata and for the ones visiting. Even serving till late hours of the night,the experience of parking your car on the road and being served hot and delicious food in your car is fantastic.

What we ordered:

Tandoori Aloo : very well cooked and succulent

Dal Makhni : *STAR DISH* Just this and the roti could have made my meal

Paneer Tikka Masala : this was average ,although I have been told they are better generally

The service is super quick and the above was like Rs200 per head.

I absolutely loved the dal makhni and paneer dishes. They were extremely tasty, well priced and the quantity was filling as well. The naans were soft and hot. The quality of the food was great.
However, what I really wished they would have paid attention to is the hygiene. One of the plates offered to us was greasy. The glasses were also the same. The staff was a mixture. One was very friendly but the next one was a little too sassy for my taste.

This place is my favourite just for its Mutton Roganjosh . I can visit this place anytime to have that tender pieces of mutton beautifully prepared with the right amount of spices . 

Recommendations : 

Chicken Do piaza 
Mutton Roganjosh 
Chicken Korma 
Shahi paneer 
Mutton biryani . 


You have to eat here atleast once :)

Its is great place to have Indian food and especially if you have midnight cravings. This place remains open till 2 o clock in the morning and offers delicious food. The tandoori chicken, the chicken bharta, varies of tadka and nun are some of my favourite food preparations at this restaurant. Besides good food, the courteous service of the workers is a big plus.

Last night we entered here at about 11:45 pm for dinner. Both of us were starving and were looking forward to the famous dhaba food. The place was jam packed, with a small crowd waiting outside to get in. We were seated in about 15 minutes time. We ordered the chicken malai tikka kebab, chicken reshmi kebab, dal makhani, butter nun and roomali roti. We had a lot of expectations from the food but it was a bit of a disappointment. The dal makhani could have been a lot better, I have had much tastier varieties in roadside Kolkata stalls. The chicken kebabs were not even just okay. They were overcooked, and the chicken turned out to be fibrous. There was nothing juicy or tender about the chicken pieces. We were famished and had no option but to gulp down the food. We ended the meal with kesar pista koofie with falooda, which was pretty great and the only good thing about the entire meal. Whatever ratings I give it today is on the basis of my past experience with food from this joint, but I doubt they maintain the same standards anymore. It is sad to see such a legendary joint churning out such below ordinary fare on a saturday night when the place is absolutely brimming with late nighters. I just hope it was a bad day and such state of affairs is not permanent.

Now the food is decent n good... the non veg dishes are worth a try giving u a feel of an actual DHABA ! Plus taste is spicy yet tasty ..! 
Would recommend dis over BALWANT SINGH KA DHABA any day for several reasons.. first on HYGIENE basis.. den FOOD ...! lastly the restaurant also offers good NON VEG !

This eatery open till late night and you get authentic Punjabi North Indian Cuisine at a reasonable price. Tandoori chicken and egg tadka will bowl you out completely.  I also love chicken bharta. Kolkata kathi roll is also very popular.Tea fully loaded with creamy milk and lot of sugar also very popular. You must visit this simple decor place. There is a AC family room as well.

Food- 
Tandoori Chicken - My absolute favourite dish from this place! It's a must have!  The Chicken is flavoursome and tender. 
Saag chicken- Best to be eaten hot and in winters.  Expected it to be more creamer but it was good. 
Tandoori roti and Rumali Roti.

Azad Hind Dhaba is a nice choice for a quick north Indian bite on a smaller budget. Whilst I'm not a fan of the (famous) rolls here, I do like the Aloo do piaza, Dal makhani and the paneer. An area of complain is the breads. They are generally too thick, and I prefer having the sabzi with home cooked breads rather than ordering the Nan or kulchas. Still, that's not a deal breaker, and one can try this place out.

Post my MMB class a bunch of us dropped down here for lunch. The place is a no frill ac dhaba. 
Coming straight to the food we ordered. The chicken tandoori was good. Cooked well and soft pieces. Although the 4 pieces were not evenly sized. 2 were chunky pieces while the other 2 barely had any meat to it. But it was prepared well so no complaints. After this everything was a down hill.
The butter naan and chicken bharta came first. The bharta was a huge disappointment. It tasted no where near to how chicken bharta tastes and the boiled egg that is always given on top or in chopped version was not there. The naan was more oily than buttery. 1 plate of basmati rice at 100 is highly over priced for the quantity they give. The chicken malai kebab tasted just about fine. 
Not really worth the prices they charge.

This is the place you visit when it is very late at night and you have to have restaurant food. It is oldest and the best outlet among others. It serves dhaba food in its true sense. The ambiance isn't very good, though they have made it fully air conditioned recently. The tangri kebab, the hariyali kebab and fish tikka kebab is a must try. The biriyani is average. One should definitely try peeli daal and tandoori roti. Also, they have the seasonal makkai ki roti and sarson da saag, which is good. The quality of food is okay, but it is degrading. The chicken bharta is disastrous. It has turned into more of a sweet dish.¬†They need to pay a bit more attention to the quality and cleanliness.

If you want the taste in food then you must surely visit, don't look by its ambience. "Don't judge the book by it's cover".

One of the best places for having biryani and Chicken dishes. The taste is always the same and the serving time is also less. Chicken biryani and mutton Biryani are must haves if you in Azad Hind Dhaba.

This address doesn't need recognition or review to judge it's food serving capabilities. The food is just awesome. Be it anything, from paneer tikka, to double egg chicken rolls, paranthe, sabzi and what not. The taste will surely linger in your tongues. The only off-thing here is the cleanliness and the crowd. It is a small turndown. Thoroughly enjoy the time spent here.

This is the place you visit when it is very late at night and you have to have restaurant food. It is oldest and the best outlet among others. It serves dhaba food in its true sense. The ambiance isn't very good, though they have made it fully air conditioned recently. The tangri kebab, the hariyali kebab and fish tikka kebab is a must try. The biriyani is average. One should definitely try peeli daal and tandoori roti. Also, they have the seasonal makkai ki roti and sarson da saag, which is good. The quality of food is okay, but it is degrading. The chicken bharta is disastrous. It has turned into more of a sweet dish.¬†They need to pay a bit more attention to the quality and cleanliness.

Some of the best tandoori chicken you can have in the city, although the greatness ends there. The rotis were hard and chewy, the Biriyani below average. Azad Hind is one of those places which has gone down in quality over the years !!

Had recently visited the restaurant, possibly after a gap of about 15 years. Was really looking forward to the food. But sadly it turned out to be very disappointed. The food was very average. None of the dishes stood out. Definitely the place has changed a lot in the last decade but sadly so has the food. Somewhere on the path of expansion and modernisation the taste of this restaurant took a hit. The Dal Tarka was served with a pool of oil above it, but the over cooked or stale Chicken kababs were the biggest let down.

I have got home delivery done from here many a times, I love the dal tarka they make. 
We used to earlier go for breakfast; chai, samosas and kachori sabzi. The kachori sabzi here is superb. Though I haven't eaten it for a while now. So are the rolls. 

Last week we landed here for dinner around 10:30 post watching a movie. The sit down eatery is divided into the Ac and non ac part. We got a table in the latter.
We ordered
Paneer Tikka ( it's an old favourite)

Aloo Do pyaza ( big chunks of potato shallow fried in oil , topped with loads of  fried onion strands in a creamy and well spiced gravy )

Dal Tadka ( A mix of lentils cooked to perfection with added tomatoes and onions, a must try )

Veg tadka ( Minced veggies are added to the normal dal tadka, it increases the crunch factor as well as makes me happy I'm eating healthy)

Malai kofta ( Cottage cheese, cream and potato roundels in a subtle butter gravy )

Paneer Butter Masala ( paneer cut into small cubes in a light yellow gravy dominated by the taste of butter and cream)

Assorted Breads 
( naan, Masala kulcha, garlic naan, tandoori roti, roomali roti)
Onion salad

All the vegetables were really good. Just the Paneer and Malai Kofta gravies were just too similar almost ditto. I wished the server had informed about this when we placed our order. We ended up wasting quite a bit of kofta cause of monotonous taste.
 Overall it was a good experience.

 Behind the cash counter is a large painting by  the the great MF Hussain. Otherwise the interiors are simple and basic. The food is really good and service is quick. And specially the aftermovie hunger made us attack the food as soon as it reached the table. 

The vegetable Tadka  and the aloo do pyaza were the best and will definitely feature in my future orders

The oldest of the Azad hind dhaba as far as I remember. The location of this place need not be mentioned is on the Ballygunj circular road and infact many people use this as the landmark.

In terms of the ambiance, very basic do not expect anything more on this place. ¬†

Tried their tandoori chicken ¬†which was on a dry side and I did not like it. However the mutton kadai was good and spicy enough to go with hot tandoori roti's. Green salad and a lassi. Its just basic green salad and an OK lassi for me.

Not the best of decors but the best of foods for sure...
As their franchise is divided among two brothers lately this outlet got neglected for whatever reasons...
Still doesn't matter as the taste remained same...
Their Chicken Tandoori is a favourite and even the Chicken Tikka...
Kaali Dal and Soft Butter Nuns...
Uff nothing like it...
Just a message for the management to please maintain the standard and keep the place neat and hygienic as that's been missing these days...

Seriously , the Chicken Rolls are to die for here. Tandoori Chicken is another major draw as the flavouring is done to perfection. Personally found the Tandoori Kebabs slightly disappointing. Naans are done thick and tasty. All in all , the personification of the Comfort Joint !

Azad hind dhaba gives u d azaadi of paying service tax on bill value+vat+swacch bharat cess+packing charges+azaadi tax (0.2%!) even on takeaways! Also by ordering through Zomato they Rs.10 - 30 extra per item in comparison to their published rates on normal takeaways( Zomato seems to be okay wid it ). They take care not to deliver fast ( they are pretty meticulous about it!). 
The food quantity and quality decreases exponentially while orderinng thru zomato!

Used to enjoy their tandoori chicken which has down over the last few months. Their biriyani lacks a normal biriyani's taste! They have remembered to increase the prices of their dishes but forgotten to improve or remain consistent in their taste and quality!

When I use to stay in Kolkata, the place was a favorite of mine for late night dinning, so on my recent visit when I wanted to dine at 1 am I called for their Home Delivery. My favorite dish is double mirchi tarka (not on the menu) but being summer I opted for the normal tarka along with chana masala and romali roti. The food was good but not as great as it used to be, probably I was missing my favorite dish. Still very satisfying having dhaba food  late at night.

As a tourist in the city, it's a reasonable place for a meal. You get most of the desi items. I ordered a palak paneer with rice. It tasted good and the best part was the quantity of oil in the item. It did not have a layer of oil floating over the gravy. The ambience is something to mention about. Water was dripping down from the AC on some of the tables. If you can avoid such tables, then you can have 1 reasonable meal there.

This place was walking distance from my school and I used to visit often. So did my dad in his college days. Azad Hind of Ballygunge Circular Road was more of a nostalgia to me than a mere restaurant. My penultimate visit was about 2 years back and the place didn't fail to impress me. But unfortunately, my last Saturday's visit was a disaster.
Went there with one of my friend for a quick lunch. It was around 3'o clock in the afternoon and the restaurant was pretty empty. We went to the AC section on the right hand side. Chose the best (read nearest to the fan) table and the waiter gave us the menu card in no time. We ordered one plate of Chicken-Egg Tarka with couple of Tandoori rotis, a green salad and a sweet Lassi.
The Lassi was the best of the lot. Salad was ok as it should be. Rotis were fresh and hot. But the Tarka which, once Azad Hind was famous for, was a tasteless slippery lump of chicken and daal. The whole thing did not have any taste or any flavor. My taste buds and olfactory lobe, both were confused... and so was I. At one point I seriously started thinking that perhaps I had lost my sense of taste. I tried to improvise (to make it edible) with salt, then with lime, with onions, green chilies... but everything was in vain.
I was shattered in torment when the glimpses of remembrance of the good ol' days passed by.
The only happy part of the afternoon was the bill, which was only Rs. 411 all inclusive.
Every good thing in our short life has got an expiry date and Azad Hind is no exception. The best days are past. Azad Hind now needs a Melisandre who can¬† bring back the lost soul. After all, we know that's not an impossible task... ask John Snow.

Now this place is pretty legendary, dont know how many times i have been there in the early 2000 when i was in college....you will see long queues of cars and motorbikes outside coming after late night parties to hogg on some good cheap food (back then)....the fun here is to get the food served in your car, either on the bonnet or on the roof....their best is the creamy, cheesy, gooey chicken bharta with butter naan and onion salad and thumps up....heavenly....dont expect otherwise typical resturant type ambience or service, but its unique in its own way....

Azad Hind is definitely a restaurant that has got a potential to be a whole lot better. The food was quite average, the ambience is quite sub standard. The staff is okayish. As a whole everything is quite average! I ordered a Masala Cold Drink, Chicken Tadka Boneless and Rumali Roti.
The Masala Cold Drink was quite nice. I quite enjoyed it.
The Rumali Roti was not really hot. Its looked like something cooked quite a while back. Disappointing is the word.
The Chicken Tadka was more like Chicken Dal! I felt like it was some dal with some pieces of shredded chicken. The taste was fine but definitely tasted more of dal than the chicken.
To sum it up, it was quite an average experience. The only thing that is fine is the price. The meal cost less than 300 rupees and hence I think the meal wasn't that bad for the price. I definitely think this place has a lot more to offer and perhaps the other items are better and with that hope I will be back to this place sometime in the near future!
Happy Dining!

I have eaten a meal at this place may be once or twice and I don't remember anything in particular about the food here.. but what we come here regularly for is their kulfi. It's creamy and just yumm... They have it in different flavours but I am totally fond of the simple kesar pista one. even the rose syrup they pour on the top is addictive.. the 4.5 rating is based just on their kulfi and not food..

There are very few places in Kolkata which serves late night food and this is one of them. A favorite hotspot for people of all ages, this outlet has been serving quality North Indian food at an affordable rates. And rightly so, most of the items here are worth trying and won't leave you with a pinch of regret.

Although, far from my place, I try and drop in here whenever am round, mostly for their Chicken Rolls. Besides, I like their Bharta and Tikka Butter Masala. Get them with Tandoori Roti, or may be 'butter marke' and you will have a sumptuous meal. The waiters are courteous and have no hesitation to deliver the food right in your car.

So, you need not even pull out yourselves and undertake the hassles of standing in the queue and order for your food. The service is superfast. The quality here is pretty decent, although people mostly say that it has not been like what is was originally. But, if you consider their USP's, it mostly shadows their negative points.

The oldest azad hind I suppose or maybe the first azad hind I went to as a kid.
Location-GREAT, right in circular road..
Servuce- super quick 
Food- typical dhaba food.... Always mention less oil to still get considerable amount of oil.
My picks... Chicken bharta, butter paneer, masala kulcha and keema matar.
 You get food right in your car,even late night so that's pretty much a cherry in the cake.

Dinner In The Car @ Azad Hind, Ballygunge, Kolkata :)

There is high end food, and then, there is dhaba food. Both have their own charm.

Late hours return from a mega meet or event, you look forward to some readymade hot and filling food, to soothe your senses, and you really don't want to bestow much time in dining, then what is the best option?

Answer is - Dhaba Food, that gets served in your car. Moment you park, they take your order, and within 5-10 mins, they present the food with enough crockeries, tissue napkins and hospitality.

We ordered - Dal Makhnani, Aloo Do Pyaza, Butter Naan, Masala Kulcha and Papads (not in pic).

All items were fresh, tasty and filling. The butter naan needs special mentioning, as nothing compares to a well made, fresh out of tandoor, dhaba naan.

The pricing for the aforesaid meal would be Rs. 400/- plus.

Amazing food. Amazing place. Reasonably priced. I have been to this place umpteen times and it's food is amazing each time.  Our all time fav is dal tadka, rumali roti and spicy paneer gravy. Ambience is that of a typical dhaba so if you going for posh set up this isn't the right place. But if you looking forward  to treat  your taste buds this is the place.

When in Kolkata or if you hungry ar 2 AM this is where you head to. Having car parked there and having food is no less than an experience in itself. Colllege going young crowd, middle aged group, families you can see here all of them at weird hours queing for food. Located in posh Ballygunge locality next to also popular Sharma Dhaba this is a crowded joint at night. Food what you get is good to okeish. Nothing really great. But one need to soak into the aura of this place. If you lucky enough can even catch a glimpse of few fancy cars parked in for food. The waiters would help you first park your car and then serve tou food super fast. 2 gravies, 8 rotis, 2 starters- all it took was 15 mins to lack and bring. On a good dat it takes less than 10 mins. Can give McD run for super service. I like the Tandoori Chicken, Butter Roti,  Keema Matar, Tikka Butter Masala here. In veggies can try Paneer which is good too.

It might be my 100th visit to this place....love the food...loved the ambience...a must try is the palak paneer & chicken bharta. The service is quick...I feel like home.Its a legendary place for Punjabi food in kolkata

**Although once I had a bad experience, The palak paneer had pieces of burnt charcoal.

I love Punjabi food and I love this place. We normally come here to eat spicy kulchas along with spicy, garlicky, creamy and mouthwatering Saag Tarka, my favorite. I love their yummy creamy and chunky Chicken Bharta. Always along with Saag Tarka, I order my favorite side, Garlic Naan which is basically Butter Naan with shredded burnt garlic on top. Ooh yummy.

I don't think I need to point out the location of this place. No one can miss it. And well I would say every time I have been to it. It's a great experience. Specially having their "egg chicken roll" me and my friend usually walk from my house to the place for the rolls and they never ever disappoint. Tadka and mixed veg and chicken bharta are definitely a good dishes, their kebabs I would say need some work. They are usually a hit and miss. But still they go down very well. Just like the traditional dhaba. They have an sitting area with AC and non AC and also service the cars with the food of ya want that. I do think that they should stop putting massive pieces of green chilli pepper in tadka and chicken curry dishes. Other then that. All in all a great place to have a late night fulfilling supper. BUT beware of the massive chilli pepper pieces in their dishes.

Like how can some go wrong in making dal makhni like how. Its the safest dish to have in any place. Food was bad and so was the service although its a dhaba service wont matter. They should improve their food...

I HAVE BEEN VISITING THIS PLACE FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS,A VERY POPULAR JOINT FOR PARTY ANIMALS .
THEY SERVE GOOD TANDOORI PREPARATIONS AS WELL HAS A VARIETY OF NORTH INDIAN FARE IN THEIR MENU.
BUT OFF LATE THE QUALITY OF FOOD PREPARATION HAS DETORIATED VERY MUCH AND IS NOT ALWAYS GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY.
THOUGH SERVICE STAFF IS COURTEOUS AND QUICK TO SERVE ANYTHING.

Started going here with my parents as a kid, whenever we had to get some late night dinner outside. Their rolls are good, and so are the other dishes. But now they have a lot more competition, with many other new joints staying open late into the night.
However, this place still has its loyal clientele and remains a favourite of mine.

It is quite good. Maybe not the best in town. But it is quite tasty and some dishes are really good.
As goes the trend, it is customary to bring your car and eat in it. You needn't get out of your car to place your order. And the delivery shall be done at your car. It has got its own charm.
Alternatively you can eat inside: just some tables and fans, no attention to anything else but what just serves the purpose of eating.
And you can always take it home.

Their home delivery is not so good. I have has some bad experience in having to wait much more than usual for the food to arrive. This has happened with me two times, and I have taken home delivery from them no more than twice!

I recommend:
# Tandoori Chicken
# Chicken Malai Kebab
# Malai tea
# Lassi (the 40 rupees which is the cheapest one is quite large)

It's been almost a month now, Mr manager, that the soap holder in wash basin is broken. If we are paying rs217 for half chicken tandoori at least give us a decent place to wash hand. You can put a small soap in a little box and make it look OK. But a punctured bottle that's substituting the hand wash is a tad below your standard. Food is good though ..

I live right next to Azad Hind and I've always been interested in how the place has evolved. There are things that it still does well but then there are so many things that have just faded.¬†

For instance, in my most recent visit, I ordered the Tandoori Chicken, the Chicken Bharta, the Dal Tadka and Rotis and Nan. The Tandoori Chicken was decent as in it tasted like Tandoori Chicken but it lacked the juiciness and the flavor that would make it outstanding. The Bharta was a disappointment and it has been for a while.¬†

There was a time you could stop by Azad Hind and have the Chicken Bharta with Roti and the Chicken Bharta would come fresh off the kitchen, hot and flavorful with the juices of the chicken adding to the gravy. I think now it is dry shredded chicken added to the gravy and it doesn't taste as good.

Nowadays, the stuff I like the most at Azad Hind is the Chai and the Rolls. Surprisingly, the rolls at Azad Hind are really good and they go so well with the Chai. Their rolls are simple and uncomplicated and the Paratha is crispy and fresh.¬†

Azad Hind is the best place for late night food but there was a time when I would just stop by for dinner but that isn't the case anymore.

The best Dhaba in Kolkata. They have taken the Dhaba food to a different level. They have their outlets all over Kolkata but the main branch cooks the best food as they still follow old school tandoor cooking which gives the food its unique taste. Tried most of their dishes and all taste awesome.

Me and my friends order food from here for home delivery. I love to have extra spicy food, but many of their main course non-veg gravy item are so so much spicy that it's almost impossible to eat the gravy. The gravy is thick and course containing only full of coursely chopped garlic and ginger. And also their chicken size for chicken tandoori is small in comparison to any other restaurant. Rest of the items okey. Overall it's a good renowned restaurant for north Indian cuisine.

This place food is very good . Only the thing is their staffs are very ill mannered , talks in a loud voice and virtually you have to shout at them to keep them quiet . In terms of food they are just like any other dhaba. The egg tarka taste little different from other places but tastes really good. Love their Tandoori and Chicken bharta as well. They may not be the best but certainly calls for visit. Hard to find a place at this cost that tastes well. Azad Hind certainly is worth a try :)

They are like fallen heroes. Once we use to fight to get our orders first but now people hardly goes there. The reason is only because of drastic low quality and taste of the food.

Azad Hind is a place where I have ordered from my office and for quick treat with my friends.
Tandoori aloo is yummy and our all time favourite. Kashmiri aloo dum is delicious and saag tarka needs acquired taste for you to like it. 
What you should not do is to order naan and tandoori breads from here....and if you do....you will experience eating chewing gum instead of bread along with various curries. So it's strongly not recommended unless you are eating at Azand Hind itself and not getting it parcelled. Try roomali roti instead.
Azad Hind is good to go where you have no place to eat and you want quick reasonable food :)

Azad hind restaurant is the den where we always hangout after the long night drive in astami or nabami's during the durga Puja.. It has been a kind of our college tradition of doing that. Coming the main topic, THE FOOD - Azad Hind provides one of the best Punjabi delicacies in KOLKATA, the very food style could be compared to the dhaba style of Punjab. The crown platter is the tandori chicken. Served with salad and green Purina chutney along with the touch of sour lemon just brings out the best Punjabi tandoori taste. The other food that they serve are all around good or can be just marked over fairly good.
Indian breads such as naan and roti's are fairly the same that you could find at any restaurants. A particular thing to notice that most of the prepared curries that they provide are almost same in taste. 
Pros - good seasoning in food, servings in time, remains open all throughout the night during durga puja
Cons - a bit overpriced, no bathroom facility in the restaurant.

Finally I paid a visit to this joint for lunch. We had a disappointing experience. Food was just usual and butter naan was rubbery. Chicken tikka kebab was not smoky and was over cooked. Paneer tikka kebab with those big chunks was awful. Order came in after quite a lot of waiting. Not going again. Not recommending to anyone.

I have seen M.F.Hussain paintings in three hospitality establishments in India.A huge one above the reception at the Lalit,New Delhi,Another wide combo of 3 paintings at the Taj,Apollo Bunder,Mumbai and oddly the third at Azad Hind,B.C.Road,Kolkata.
Of the innumerable times I've been at this place my choice has been limited to Tandoori Chicken,Chicken Bharta,Mutton Korma,Dal fry and tandoori rotis followed by a kickass kulfi.
So was it this scorching summer afternoon and the result as always was a happy mind and a full stomach.My only issue is their cooking medium which solidifies in case of packing leftovers but they have never made bones about this place being a Health food joint.And if the "Hussain" liked this place,who are we ordinary mortals to disagree?

They have a very quick service, and quite nice place to drop in after Puja shopping.

A good place to sit and eat in your car after late night party. Their tandoori roti and dal was good.  A decent place but maybe not very hygienic.

One of the oldest dhaba restaurants in the city. The food is mainly punjabi style so expect little oily and spicy food. They have not worked much for the amibience. Its just an alright place to have decent Indian cuisine. Service is good.

Midnight meals, MF Hussein, Institution, Nostalgia - some of the myriad reasons to visit this place. Probably has the most expensive wall in the city with the Hussein painting, and comes alive in the evenings only. Went there again after a while in the wee hours and found not much has changed. The dal and roti is still good, the service simple and the place still packed! One of those iconic places that are there in each city.

This outlet of Azad Hind Dhaba is located close to Army School on Ballygunge Circular Road..this place remains open till late at night,certainly one of tis usp..Last time I visited this place I found the food to be pretty average,lacking in flavours,though they are known to serve delicious punjabi cuisine..The ambiance here is pretty ordinary,nothing elegant or classy,and I found the servers to be bit rude at times..seems they don't even have time to listen your orders carefully..A few weeks ago it was a bit late,so we decided to crash on this place:
Tandoori Chicken: Nice as usual,still the chicken was a bit stiff,should have been better..
Chicken Bharta: I didn't like this at all..it was bland, lacked seasoning..not expected from a place known for its bharta..
Mutton Keema Tadka: This was better,tasted good,but it was unnecessary oily,still blends well with tandoori roti..
Overall it was an average experience..don't know whether I would want to go back..Overall cheque comes to Rs.920/-(approx) for 3 of us..
Food: 3/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 2/5
Ambiance: 2.5/5

This restaurant is a true punjabi and tandoori food lovers delight.I have had the best punjabi food of my life here.Sarson ka saag,makki ki roti,tandoori chicken ,chicken bharta,butter chicken and rotis ,name it and you get it.Each and every punjabi item you have here is cooked in the most authentic way with loads of butter and masala.The ambience is complete dhaba type though its air-conditioned and mind you its not for the swanky type.Service is prompt and pricing unbelieveable.
I recently visited this restaurant and ordered the Tandoori chicken,Chicken Bharta and tandoori roti.As usual the tandoori chicken was cooked to perfection with a liitle overdone at the edges which i really love.This restaurant is a complete foodie paradise and much better in terms of both taste and quality than the other Azad Hind Dhaba franchises mushrooming here and there.

My maiden visit to this joint with my group of childhood friends. Dropped in at a late hour of 4;00PM for lunch. The place was relatively empty, thus staff were attentive. We ordered tandoori roti, paneer butter masala, egg tadka, masala papad, salad. Food was served promptly within 15 minutes flat. Rotis were piping hot and crispy. The tadka was decent enough but the paneer dish disappointed us. Ambiance is shabby, air conditioner works-that is the only consolation. This is a purely no-frills place to satiate one's hunger pangs and make a move. Prices are average and so is the food. Not impressive. Only thing that makes an impression is the MF Hussain painting that adorns the wall-guess he was a regular during his Kolkata days ages ago.

This place is quite old and has its own identity in the are and the city. The best part about it is that it's air-conditioned and the food is delicious with reasonable prices. The ambiance is not that great with usual dhaba styled wooden tables and chairs and some might not find it soothing. It works well for me though. Good place to either order from or get into for a quick meal.

As dhabas go this place has survived over the years all thanks to its connection with MF Hussain who patronised this place when he was a struggling artist in his early years. His gift was a painting on the wall which still adorns the place and much of the Mercedes,BMW etal crowd come to see and indulge in some non veg stuff on the quiet!! The food is nothing great ,generally a bit greasy/oily,the seating is hard and not comfy. Service is erratic and hygene (pop in and see the kitchen---and youll never eat here again) !!! There is a big stinky garbage dump close by(a real killer of appetite. So go ,see the painting and ¬†eat at the dhaba further down the road if you must.Incidentally it is also known as the Madhuri dhaba--MFHs passion at the time .

1.Lacks good ambience.
2.Lack of parking space (during the peak hours)

This is one of the oldest Dhabas in the city and also located at a very posh area of Calcutta. Running at almost a 24x7 mode, the interiors of the Dhaba hasn't undergone a lot of changes and is in desperate need for an upgrade. Certainly deserves a better decor considering the posh locality that houses this one. 

The key point to remember when you visit this Dhaba is the MF Hussain painting (gifted by the legend himself) that stands right at the checkout counter. Do not miss!

Undoubtedly the best and most fluffiest naans you will get anywhere. Must not miss the kullad pepsi ;)

Only thing to be careful about - better to have dinner there instead of lunch. Chances are u will be served overnight leftover dishes in lunch. 

Dont expect it to be a fancy restaurant. It is a dhaba only and cleanliness is not something u will find here. Don't get surprised if a baby cockroach joins ur table as a guest.

Went for a Sunday lunch. This place never ceases to amaze me. We get the best tandoori roti here in the whole town. The quality, texture and taste of special butter tarka is just splendid! 
The perfect dhaba! 
Though a little congested in seating, this place has a lot of vegetarian options and makes superb paneer tikkas. The service is quick. 
This place justifies being called one of the best "dhaba" in Kolkata. 
I would definitely visit again. 
Vegetarians do order spl butter tarka, veg korma, paneer butter masala and ofcourse Tandoori Roti(butter and crisp).

A popular restaurant among both the classes and the masses of Calcutta, this restaurants symbolises the love for food amongst the locals. It is a late night joint where people come to enjoy their post midnight drinks with the famous kebabs. You can blindly order any dish from the Kebab section and trust me you'll not be disappointed. But the Malai tikka and the Reshmi Kebab with butter nan are simply delicious.It is a very busy and cosy place so waiting times can be a problem. But if you are with friends looking to enjoy some late night delicacies in the city, you cannot find a better place.

Ordered today and received the worst tandoori rotis. Made of leather I think. Couldn't break it with my fingers OR teeth. That's fine. But when we complained, the guy on phone said this is how maida tandoori rotis are (of course, what do I know about rotis in 26 years of my existence, right?) 
He refused to send fresh ones, obviously. And was unapologetic.
I guess they feel that people will order no matter what and hence are unfazed by complaints. 
Bottom line- hard rotis, hard attitude, hard rating.

Been here today for dinner with friends. We had ordered for Butter Roti, Rumali Roti, Kaali Daal and Paneer butter Masala. The food was served hot and it seemed to look delicious. But the Rumali roti was not upto the mark. The daal was spicy though we had specifically ordered him not to make it spicy. The paneer was good though. The Butter Roti had butter on the higher side as if a dullop full of butter has been put to it. The onion salad was the best part. Liked it and it made the dinner edible. There is definitely much scope for improvement in an otherwise mist visit place for North indian cuisine lovers :)

The vibrancy of late-night hours at this Dhaba has always struck me. You would always find people eating outside on the bonnet of their cars as well as inside at uneven hours. The food is truly delicious and quite affordable. I have often tried their Naan Roti , Chicken butter Masala , Mint Onion salad , Dal Tadka on more than one ocassion and I always want to keep coming back again. To conclude it all , I would  recommend a Paan from the make-shift Paanwala whose right there outside the Dhaba.

When undecided, one should quietly walk in to Azad Hind, have one's meal and walk off. The most featured menu across people is dal makhani, paneer butter masala, chicken bharta or dahi chicken along with tandoori rotis.

This joint has always been the fall back option whenever I am out with friends. We end up here quite often bcoz of the availability of parking, late night food and overall when we want to hog on chicken.

The great thing about a good dhaba is that a dhaba never sleeps. There's always the bustle of customers and staff combined that defies the etiquette or table manners of other kinds of restaurants, making it ideal for a meal out with friends. The fact that the food is good and relatively cheap is an added bonus.

The menu, strictly North Indian, doesn't offer too many options. Seeing as they didn't have mutton, we were left with a choice of three kinds of chicken. The dopiaza was particularly good, the fried onions added quite a zing to it. The butter masala and chicken kasa were passably good too.

They do have quite a few options ion the vegetarian section. The aloo dopiaza and kashmiri aloo were both surprisingly well made.¬†

The staff was friendly and the place big enough for large parties and clean, if only reeking a little of dettol.
For student budgets especially, this place packs quite a good deal.

Food quality is good, some specific dishes are delicious enough but service needs to improve. Yesterday I went to have lunch there along with my colleagues, had chicken & mutton biriyani, chicken tikka butter masala & chicken reshmi butter masala, quality of food was good but service was a bit poor! Price is not at all reasonable during festive time as they almost double the price of food items compared to that of what they actually charge round the year!!

We were taken here by an uncle who lives in Kolkata. Were quite surprised when we entered the place. It felt kinda shady. But then came the story of how it used to be a truck drivers' eatery, and now turned into a hangout place for all. They serve food until late in the night. Customers have the option of eating in their own car. The food is extremely rick and tasty. Almost feels like an exotic treat that you wanna indulge more often. When I go back to Kolkata, I'll surely visit them!

We have always asked for take away rolls from Azad Hind. Their chicken rolls are outstanding. With the legendary roll becoming a standard of snacking in the city, Azad Hind does a stellar job of doing these rools just right. The meat is soft and tasty ‚Äì not over spiced or under done, and the parathas are melt in your mouth good, without being overly oily.

The place is great for families as well as gang of friends as they have separate dining areas. The service is largely aligned to a typical Punjabi dhaba and so is the staff. The tandoori chicken is great and so is the curd-dhania chutney that goes with it. A standard order would be egg bhurjee , dal and roti if one isn't up for chicken. The masala cold drinks in earthen cups(kulhad) gives the feel of a dhaba all the more!

This is one of the old legendary places in Ballygunge Curcular road. None other than  MF Husssain has painted on one of the walls in appreciation of the food. The food here is very differently tasting - especially the "do-piazza" stuff. But please do not peep into the kitchen - you will be hugely disappointed with the poor hygeine. Service is good and the ambience on AC are is ok ok - though only families are allowed. Overall a must try for food taste but beware of Hygeine issues.

Azad Hind Dhaba was a highly frequented place for quite sometime but the inconsistent food quality replaced the same with excellent food at jai hind dhaba. Located on ballygunge circular road, the place is pretty popular especially during late hours in the night. The place went down the sack in last few years when jai hind dhaba took the edge over it but i find these people uplifting themselves now with better service and food quality.

This was the first of the places in Kolkata to serve you in the car. The restaurant inside has an AC section as well. The decor is minimal but the painting by M F Hussain on wall behind billing desk only thing worth of a mention. The staff service is prompt. The prices are reasonable with good serving sizes.

The food is served hot and fresh, though hygiene has always been a concern to me here. The kebabs are well grilled and are good. The dal makhani, aloo do pyaza and some extra crisp butter naan are always a delight to have. Never been fond of their rice dishes though which are average. Overall a good place to go and eat your heart out, especially post midnight with not many options around.

Undoubtedly,this is one of the most popular dhabas in kolkata...at all odd hours of nyt,you will find rows of cars parked in front,with people standing out and gorging on the food...Despite the innumerable occasions wen iv had food from this joint,i daresay im not much of a fan of stand-while-you-eat...so its always been takeaway for me....where i can savour the flavours in the comfort of my home...my staple order here includes chicken reshmi kabab,rumali roti,egg tadka,mixed veg,palak paneer....most of the dishes are standard and verry tasty...but the hands down winner is the tadka...im yet to taste a better preparation of egg tadka newhere in kolkata...the consistency,spice,evrything is a perfect balance culminating into this mouth watering dish...no wonder then,that a non veggie like me, prefers this to ne meat dish...
Recently iv had a few complaints though..once the food was verry spicy and this time,my eyes watered instead of mouth...another time,it seemed they had emptied a whole packet of salt into the dal...apart from this however,wenever we hv ordered food from here,it has always been satisfying...both for my taste buds and my pockets... A must try is the lassi, thick and served in a 'bhaar', one of the best in Kolkata... 
I will keep coming back here...but unless they scrap tadka from their menu,i dont know how i am ever gonna try ne of their other dishes... 

P.S. An absolute no for health freaks...food is very oily !!

Awesome north indian "punjabi"food at pocket friendly price.d best time to savour d lip smacking robust menu along with d ambience is after 12 in d night.liver curry nd keema tadka r a must try.lassi is ok, nothing xceptional.serving portions r quite generous, so order less than what u usually do at other restaurants.  hustle n bustle makes u feel at d peak hours even at 2am.highly recomended.

The old is Gold Concept of Azad Hind Dhaba... Earlier in Kolkata this was THE place to hit after going pubbing and was open through the night... however it closes early these days due to various issues which makes us not go to this place very often... the food has also gone down big big time... and with the likes of 24 joints and JAI HIND DHABA in the picture this place is no more a go go place... 

its a dhaba and we dont go there for the ambiance and feel... the food is served fast as in a dhaba and the service is quick but the people there are not very friendly and the orders can not be fined tune as per your request... you eat what you get... like i like my rotis extra crispy but that not a possibility in Azad Hind... 

all together this place still shines from its previous glory days but the food in other places is much much better,,,

Azad Hind Dhaba Ballygunje holds a special place in my heart. It has been a regular visiting joint since my first visit during my school days almost 17 years back. My menu is always fixed, I never deviate. Starting of with Paneer Tikka and Tandoori Aloo, Papad and Onion salad. The main course follows which is always Kali Dal Tarka - extra spicy , Paneer Butter Masala, Aloo Do Pyaza with Crisp Tandoori Roti followed by their Crisp Butter (extra butter) Nan with Onion salad and papad. We mostly eat in our car and get excellent service every time. The only reason I hold back the 0.5 points is the varying taste they dish out on the Aloo do Pyaza. Otherwise, it's a must visit every Month.

Azad Hind Dhaba, Kolkata

The quintessential Dhaba of Kolkata remains the Azad Hind Dhaba and an endearing one too! Since the influx of hardy and hearty Sardars in Kolkata many Azad Hind or Hind or Dhaba clones have sprung up in the length and breadth of the City of joy!

Azad Hind Dhaba is located in 7 locations and quite serve the same menu and maintain the same recipe to success! My all time favourites have been Azad Hind Dhaba on Ballygunge Circular road ( known as MF Hussain Dhaba) and the other is located on National Highway 6 enroute to Kolaghat! Since I ordered and tasted the same identical dishes it becomes imperative that i give my honest from the stomach one single review. 

As i have committed, selected and undertaken everytime i ordered for 6 of us , 2 chicken Makai Tikka at Rs 155/- per plate (Rs 125/- at NH6) and 2 chicken Lasuni at Rs 155/- per plate. Test of a Dhaba is the proof of the Dal Tadka so we ordered 3 plates at Rs 80/- ( Rs 75/-) per plate and 2 plates of Chicken Do Piaza at Rs 140/- ( 125/- at NH6) and 2 Mutton Liver Masala at Rs 165/- and 2 plates of Mutton Kheema matar at Rs 150/- per plate! 

Food Taste & Experience: the chicken tikka was well done with excellent masala pre marinate as it almost vanishes  as it melts in the mouth. The chicken lasuni was indeed a bit garliccy but never the less good. The Dal tadka has remained the key signature dish of this dhaba and remains amazing in taste and flavour! So much so most of us kept licking the serving dish clean.  Mutton liver masala was spicy chilli hot but Yum, whilst the Mutton Kheema matar was super with the well cooked texture of the kheema mixed with fresh peas! 

Slight deviation in NH6 in the menu was the addition of Mutton Barra at Rs 125/- per plate instead if chicken lasuni and chicken rashmi kebab at Rs 140/- per plate! 

Story of the M F Hussains painting is the fact that one long hair dis shrivelled gentleman used to frequent the ballygunge circular road joint in the 70's and not have enough money to pay for his immense lot of chai! So he painted up one of the walls! This painting is worth millions more than the property today!!

Overall the experience has been great year after year in this iconic place inspite of what most kolkatiian say about its present standard!  

Taste: 4/5 Excellent!!

Ambience : 2/5 even though there is a dripping AC whilst the NH6 is more presentable!!

Cost: 5/5  in comparison to any city

Value of Money: 4/5

Recommend: MUST VISIT whilst in Kolkata

Location: A few minutes away from Sharma Dhaba. 

This place has been here for so many years and has been serving good quality food consistently.¬† 
Being a Dhaba, one can't expect much from the ambiance. It's just simply done up. 
And the best part, you are served in your car as well.

Have been here for umpteen number of times.
Coming straight to the food, 

Achari Paneer Tikka 
Great to taste!

Special Dal Butter Tarka 
One of my personal favorites! 
Absolutely delicious.¬† 

Dal Makhani 
Lip-Smackin'! 
Delicious. 

Paneer Butter Masala 
Soft and succulent chunks of Paneer tossed into a creamy tomato gravy. 
Delectable! 

Paneer Tikka Butter Masala
Tandoored cubes of Paneer tossed into the creamy tomato gravy! 
Delicious. 

Vegetable Do Pyaza 
Simply awesome. 

Tandoori Butter Roti 
Made to choice! 
Served dripping with butter. 

Masala Kulcha 
The filling tasted great! 
Delicious. 

Butter Naan 
Soft and served with a dollop of butter. 

Garlic Naan 
Perfect amount of garlic on the bread! 

The service has always been super-quick! 
Prices smile at your wallet. 

Overall has been a great experience. :-)

I remember the days when this Dhaba was one of the very few places that kept open all night.Now my family is as fun loving and crazy as I am,and more often than not we used to go out for long drives at late night and drop in at this place at 2am in the morning for Daal makhani,Roti and chilled Lassi.Or sometimes just chai and samosa at 4am.It used to be super fun.Now with the new time restraints we don't have the same oportunities.However last month,we went for a late night show at Mani Square and by the time it ended,it was almost 1 am.All the cheese popcorn we had eaten were long gone and our tummies were grumbling loudly.Almost all the restaurants and diners were already closed,even the ones near Rash Behari.So my dad suggested we check Azad Hind Dhaba once.When we reached the place,it was almost empty with the last customers walking out.They were already pulling down the shutters but when they saw us and our faces must have shown that we were starving,they smiled warmly and welcomed us inside.We apologised about the inconvenience that we were causing them but they brushed it aside.They were so courteous and patient while we placed our order.We ordered Butter Naan,Daal Makhani,Chicken Do Piaza,Mutton Biryani and masala cold drink.The food arrived pretty quickly and as we tucked in,we couldn't help but relish the food.The daal makhani was so tasty,we kept reaching out for more.The chicken Do Piaza was average but the Biryani unexpectedly turned out to be great.There were two pieces of soft and succulent mutton and the rice was done just right with the right amount of spices.Just writing about it is making my mouth water and mind you,I am a big biryani fan.The price of the dishes were very reasonable as should be in a Dhaba.So all in all it was a good experience and a perfect end to our happy day.Since then,I have been there many a times with my friends,but instead of sitting in the AC section we enjoy our food outside,sitting on the bonnet of our car in the cool evening air.

My verdict - So if you are looking for Dhaba style food that tingles your taste buds and leaves you wanting for more,this is your place.

This is one amazing eatery. You can order food and enjoy it in your car but we prefer to go eat eat inside. It is often very crowded but the food is totally worth it. You should order butter naan, chicken tandoor, reshmi kebab and chicken reshmi butter masala. My North Indian tongue was refreshed when I was in Dehradun (speaking of which why doesnt Zomato have a Dehradun edition???) but this place can match North Indian restaurants as well. I totally stand by a 4.0 rating as it is worth it. Try this place for dinner with a group of friends for a raucous adda and eating chicken with your hands! Hughly reommended.

Did visit this place a couple of times and wasn't impressed nor disappointed. Tried out their Chicken and Mutton Biriyani, which is a bit reddish tastes good (not perfect), but was not satisfied with the quantity,rice was good,did not have much of the biriyani smell,the chicken and mutton pieces were good,well cooked. Chicken Kassa was good, rish and tasty, the chicken was moist,soft and tender. Their Kadhai Murg is a blunder and in case u keep it in the refrigerator/winter, after it cools, ull find a layer of dalda(white) on top, in order to remove it, u lose quite amount of curry. Chicken Tandoori is worth a try for starters you can also go for Chicken sheekh or Murg Malai Tengri.

A dhaba that has stood the test of time, you'll see a "gajagamini" hanging proudly on their wall as soon as you enter. (M.F.Hussain used to frequent this place and gifted it to them) or the food, typical dhaba spicy fare. You can't extremely like or dislike any of their food. In the end, you'll come out with a good taste in your mouth. Go for chicken tandoori and whatever else comes to your mind. No disappointments here.

At 11.3 night when ur hungry and there is boring dinner waiting for you at ur house then there is just one way to escape out of this situation . That way leads u towArds Azad hind dhabha... It's a dhabha so I don't expect much from the ambiance but we got piping got food served to is within 10 mins of our order. 
Veg dal makhani: awesome
Paneer butter masala : better than dal
Chicken tikka butter masala: few pieces of chicken cooked in a tasty gravy 
Jeera rice and dal fry: simple yet tasty 
Price : pretty kind on our pockets 

To top it all an awesome pan awaited us outside the dhabha .. 
Great experience which was expected out of this place ..

This popular eatery on Ballygunge Circular Road shot to fame because it would remain open late into the night. There would be a multitude of cars parked outside, some with people eating inside. The dhaba itself has a AC as well as a non-AC section. Another shot to fame happened when MF Hussain created a painting on its wall. It is still there, surrounded by a large frame.

The food is standard dhaba stuff. A lot of people have harped about the tarkas served here. Nothing extraordinary. No one particular dish comes to mind that I have liked. In fact I have stopped visiting as I would often get a bad stomach after a meal here.

General attitude around is not the best.

They would do nice chicken rolls though. Thin rolls, but pretty tasty.

Azad Hind dhaba is a very old place serving delicious food in calcutta since very long.I remember driving there with my family,ordering food in the car and sitting on top of the car while devouring butter nan with dal makhni and paneer butter masala.(ofcourse i was 7 then:p ) .
Over the years the place expanded and bettered the interiors to encourage family dine-inns.The paneer veg roll is a hit among office goers there.For dinner you have to order mushroom tikka and achari paneer tikka.Main course has to be paneer tikka butter masala, or paneer butter masala,dal makhni,vegetable do pyaaza.The special butter dal tadka transports you to some dhaba in punjab,couple all this with butter nan or masala kulcha and youre in for a feast.I particularly prefer my north indian dining with pinapple raita which adds bit of sweetness to the palate.

So when your heart says" rotti shotti ho jaaye" do not think twice,come hear and im sure it will be love at first  bite( in my case,im committed,very much,love at every bite! )

Azad Hind disappoints quite a bit for some one who has grown up on dhaba food on weekends. The veg biryani and paneer butter masala aren't up to the mark. The kebabs can be much much better. Hope they so something about the food quality cause 'else, soon the place will have only the huge name to boast about.

You can never go wrong with THIS place ! If you call yourself a foodie .. You need to come here ! Absolutely amazing food !!!!
It is absolutely necessary that you eat here at least once in your life. 
Punjabi food is a total bliss here!! 
The last time I was here we ordered, rumali roti and chicken bharta which came along with achar and salad 
Rumali roti - perfectly made , soft enough not very chewy and most importantly not excessively BIG 
Chicken bharta - THIS ONE WAS WAY TO GOOD !! 
One of the BEST chicken bharta I've ever had !! 
From the spice to the rich butter taste everything was just too good ! 
It was perfectly cooked ! 
I shall thank Avik da for bringing me here.

Azad hind Dhaba - Looking for tasty food? This is definitely your place specially if you are a non vegetarian.
-------------
Brief:
I have been a regular here a long time and i probably love this Azad Hind much more than the other joints in the City of Kolkata. Probably, the oldest and the best is here. The only problem i have with the food out here is the use of Dalda. However, the lovely taste makes up for it. Be it middle class, low class or high class families or friends, All come here and eat either in the car or in the Dhaba itself. 
------------- 
Food:
My parents got me a takeaway of Special Dal Tadka and Chicken Malai Butter Masala yesterday and believe me the Dal was perfect and Chicken Malai Kabab in the greavy was mouth melting. I really loved the food and it's preparation out here. It's Lovely. I even had the Special Chicken Kabab's in Roomali Roti earlier which is somewhat different to try if you are bored of the usual indian food. 
-------------
Pros:
1) Prime Location.
2) Works till late night.
3) Very prompt service.
4) Food Tastes lovely.
5) Food quantity is good.
6) Staffs are courteous.
7) Ambience is moderate.
8) Value For money.
9) Serves in car too..
10) The Special Dal Tadka is a unique out here and tastes better than few of the Dhaba's. 

Cons:-
1) Dalda spoils the food quality.
2) Food becomes cold very fast in like 10 minutes. So, an advice is whenever its served start eating then and there.
3) The Tip system still prevails here.
4) Staff area - Unhygienic
5) Ambience requires a lot of improvement
-------------
Suggestions:-
1) Some new items can be adopted easily. 
2) The dish can be prepared more excellently with little research and development work. 
3) Hygiene can be maintained with extra care.

Ahhh!! My favourite!! Situated at ballygunge circular road and not Ballygunge :| zomato people please take this into consideration. Located 5 mins walking from Sharma Dhaba or Punjab Club. 

Basically has four divisions: 
1) the outer area Which had no AC but I think it has been air conditioned too.
2) the inner area is also totally AC.
3) staff area
4) the roll area and takeaways

Azad hind dhaba staffs also serves in car. The best part is when you visit you will see a painting inside. Tell me about it. Don't wanna kill suspense. 
I have been visiting it for years and more.

Coming to the pros and cons of this place:-
Pros:-
1) located at the posh area
2) serves the tastiest special dal tarka according to me.
3) service is lighting speed
4) staffs are polite
5) prices are reasonable
6) ambience is okayish. 
7) food is very delicious.

Cons:-
1) unhygienic staff area- I peeped in one day.
2) use of dalda- very bad for health. Consume the food fast otherwise no use eating. Eat when it's hot.
3) ambience needs to be improved 

Rest I have no complaints. Even beverages such as mineral water and cold drinks are served in cheap prices. 

Must try: Veg: special dal tarka, paneer butter masala, aloo do piyaza.

Nonveg : special dal tarka, chicken bharta, chicken Reshmi butter masala, chicken malai butter masala, chicken bharta, chicken tikka. 

=====
Visit on 2nd October: Now they are not a DHABA. They are AZAD HIND HOTEL. Lol Are you kidding me? The services are the same of the Dhaba. The prices have gone sky high due to puja. When i came there to sit, the steward told me that you have to sit on that particular place only because of the puja rush. There are ways to say it but how he said was rude.¬†

Food quality remains same. However, don't go during day time. The dal taste changes. I have noticed this quite often. The evening time or the night time is the best time to come here and enjoy the meal. I had ordered Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Dal Tadka with Tandoori Butter Roti and Roomali Roti. The Roomali roti is decent but not as great as jai hind. The butter Tandoori Roti is the best here. So crispy greased with butter!! It makes your night. :)

The place to go, post clubbing, for a deliciously priced, punjabi dhaba food.

End up, post 2am and there will be a waiting. This is the usual hangout when hungry after clubbing in central kolkata. Grab that quick bite before you hit the bed.

The food is simple & tasty.
Service is fast & uncomplicated - typical dhaba style as the name suggests.

In summers, one can opt for the airconditioned dining area. Understand, the same food costs more, when served in there.

USP - open till late hours & easy on the pocket.

This was my first visit to this place after hearing quite a few rave reviews.We ordered Dal makhni.Panner Tikka Butter masala and Husain's special chicken.All three were quite good and the service too was reasonably fast.
Slapped right on the road this place is easy to locate and the food quality is more than decent.

The Azad Hind Dhaba at Purna Das Road is a curious case - somedays their food is brilliant and on other days their food is completely average. Take for example their rolls. On their day, I find their rolls (chicken/mutton) unparalleled in Calcutta, on other days the paratha is average, the chicken under done and completely bland!

Try out their Amritsari tadka - that's something novel - the only thing to be kept in mind that it's quite hot. The makki da roti is also quite good along with their sarson da saag.

What I take from them regularly is their chicken bharta which is quite good along with their chicken butter masala. Their banjara kababs is renowned but somedays like I said, it's not so good.

Overall a place good to have around your house but also a place which has a lot of scope of improvements.

Azad Hind Dhaba was a joint that the legend M.F. Hussain used to frequent whenever he was in town. Why he used to do that is beyond me but the fact remains that he did. One can also spot one of his painting on one of the walls inside. The food here is good there is no doubt about that and the service is quick and efficient. Nothing much to complain about. One may try the butter masalas and kebabs in butter masalas here with piping hot tandoori rotis. Also the chicken kebabs are pretty decent here but the mutton dishes fall well short of expectations. Their best dish in my opinion is the kadai chicken which does not have much curry but is hot and spicy and combines really well with the tandoori rotis. But ensure that you eat them then and there while they are hot if you really want to enjoy them. Also worth trying is the Hussain Special Chicken which comes with a piece of egg. It is not very different from a butter masala but just the name Hussain lends some value perhaps. Oh and the piece of chicken is a bit bigger than the normal ones. Overall a pretty good joint for typical dhaba food, one of the many good ones found all over town. Drop in if you are passing by.

Azad hind Dhaba - Looking for tasty food? This is definitely your place specially if you are a non vegetarian.
-------------
Brief:
I have been a regular here a long time and i probably love this Azad Hind much more than the other joints in the City of Kolkata. Probably, the oldest and the best is here. The only problem i have with the food out here is the use of Dalda. However, the lovely taste makes up for it. Be it middle class, low class or high class families or friends, All come here and eat either in the car or in the Dhaba itself. 
------------- 
Food:
My parents got me a takeaway of Special Dal Tadka and Chicken Malai Butter Masala yesterday and believe me the Dal was perfect and Chicken Malai Kabab in the greavy was mouth melting. I really loved the food and it's preparation out here. It's Lovely. I even had the Special Chicken Kabab's in Roomali Roti earlier which is somewhat different to try if you are bored of the usual indian food. 
-------------
Pros:
1) Prime Location.
2) Works till late night.
3) Very prompt service.
4) Food Tastes lovely.
5) Food quantity is good.
6) Staffs are courteous.
7) Ambience is moderate.
8) Value For money.
9) Serves in car too..
10) The Special Dal Tadka is a unique out here and tastes better than few of the Dhaba's. 

Cons:-
1) Dalda spoils the food quality.
2) Food becomes cold very fast in like 10 minutes. So, an advice is whenever its served start eating then and there.
3) The Tip system still prevails here.
4) Staff area - Unhygienic
5) Ambience requires a lot of improvement
-------------
Suggestions:-
1) Some new items can be adopted easily. 
2) The dish can be prepared more excellently with little research and development work. 
3) Hygiene can be maintained with extra care. 
-------------
Summary
Presentation 3.5/5
Quality 3/5
Quantity 4/5
Taste 4.5/5
Not much pocket pinching though.

Ahhh!! My favourite!! Situated at ballygunge circular road and not Ballygunge :| zomato people please take this into consideration. Located 5 mins walking from Sharma Dhaba or Punjab Club. 

Basically has four divisions: 
1) the outer area Which had no AC but I think it has been air conditioned too.
2) the inner area is also totally AC.
3) staff area
4) the roll area and takeaways

Azad hind dhaba staffs also serves in car. The best part is when you visit you will see a painting inside. Tell me about it. Don't wanna kill suspense. 
I have been visiting it for years and more.

Coming to the pros and cons of this place:-
Pros:-
1) located at the posh area
2) serves the tastiest special dal tarka according to me.
3) service is lighting speed
4) staffs are polite
5) prices are reasonable
6) ambience is okayish. 
7) food is very delicious.

Cons:-
1) unhygienic staff area- I peeped in one day.
2) use of dalda- very bad for health. Consume the food fast otherwise no use eating. Eat when it's hot.
3) ambience needs to be improved 

Rest I have no complaints. Even beverages such as mineral water and cold drinks are served in cheap prices. 

Must try: Veg: special dal tarka, paneer butter masala, aloo do piyaza.

Nonveg : special dal tarka, chicken bharta, chicken Reshmi butter masala, chicken malai butter masala, chicken bharta, chicken tikka. 

=====
Visit on 2nd October: Now they are not a DHABA. They are AZAD HIND HOTEL. Lol Are you kidding me? The services are the same of the Dhaba. The prices have gone sky high due to puja. When i came there to sit, the steward told me that you have to sit on that particular place only because of the puja rush. There are ways to say it but how he said was rude.¬†

Food quality remains same. However, don't go during day time. The dal taste changes. I have noticed this quite often. The evening time or the night time is the best time to come here and enjoy the meal. I had ordered Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Dal Tadka with Tandoori Butter Roti and Roomali Roti. The Roomali roti is decent but not as great as jai hind. The butter Tandoori Roti is the best here. So crispy greased with butter!! It makes your night. :)

The place to go, post clubbing, for a deliciously priced, punjabi dhaba food.

End up, post 2am and there will be a waiting. This is the usual hangout when hungry after clubbing in central kolkata. Grab that quick bite before you hit the bed.

The food is simple & tasty.
Service is fast & uncomplicated - typical dhaba style as the name suggests.

In summers, one can opt for the airconditioned dining area. Understand, the same food costs more, when served in there.

USP - open till late hours & easy on the pocket.

This was my first visit to this place after hearing quite a few rave reviews.We ordered Dal makhni.Panner Tikka Butter masala and Husain's special chicken.All three were quite good and the service too was reasonably fast.
Slapped right on the road this place is easy to locate and the food quality is more than decent.

The Azad Hind Dhaba at Purna Das Road is a curious case - somedays their food is brilliant and on other days their food is completely average. Take for example their rolls. On their day, I find their rolls (chicken/mutton) unparalleled in Calcutta, on other days the paratha is average, the chicken under done and completely bland!

Try out their Amritsari tadka - that's something novel - the only thing to be kept in mind that it's quite hot. The makki da roti is also quite good along with their sarson da saag.

What I take from them regularly is their chicken bharta which is quite good along with their chicken butter masala. Their banjara kababs is renowned but somedays like I said, it's not so good.

Overall a place good to have around your house but also a place which has a lot of scope of improvements.

Azad Hind Dhaba was a joint that the legend M.F. Hussain used to frequent whenever he was in town. Why he used to do that is beyond me but the fact remains that he did. One can also spot one of his painting on one of the walls inside. The food here is good there is no doubt about that and the service is quick and efficient. Nothing much to complain about. One may try the butter masalas and kebabs in butter masalas here with piping hot tandoori rotis. Also the chicken kebabs are pretty decent here but the mutton dishes fall well short of expectations. Their best dish in my opinion is the kadai chicken which does not have much curry but is hot and spicy and combines really well with the tandoori rotis. But ensure that you eat them then and there while they are hot if you really want to enjoy them. Also worth trying is the Hussain Special Chicken which comes with a piece of egg. It is not very different from a butter masala but just the name Hussain lends some value perhaps. Oh and the piece of chicken is a bit bigger than the normal ones.

The tandoori roti they will give you will take you 5 min to chew one bite. And even then be sure of stomach upset!! Worst experience among all dhabas ever! I ordered home delivery on ballygunge circular road on 18th Jan 2014.

Azad Hind is one of the three major favorites in this area (the other two being Jai Hind and Sharma) which stays open till around 12-12.30 am now but previously it used to stay open till around 1 am and even after that would not hesitate to serve food to our cars when we went there. Now it shuts up fast, but when the three of us turned up around 11 pm late last week, the place was half-empty. We did not mind and sat down in the AC section.Food wise, this place is good, especially their Saag Chicken and Chicken Bharta. I generally evaluate a Dhaba in Kolkata with these two dishes, along with the Tadka, and all three are pretty tasty, served up with lovely, white tandoori rotis. 

The decor and service are both average - you would have brisk waiters taking your orders fast, and then run around to get them for you. I ordered a paalak paneer this time, since I was in the mood to eat paneer, and it was quite tasty. Lassi also came in after dinner, and it was thick and creamy, and perfectly sweetened. Our bill, after all this food, for three people, was reasonably under 800/-  which was fine by us.

I would like you to travel back in time with me when it comes to this place say 16 - 17 years ago. When i first when here. Azad Hind used to be thsi DHABA in the literal sense. It wasn't air conditioned. The food was served in those thin oval dishes and there was not much to see except food.  The food was fresh and finger licking good. The essence of dhabas are its crowds and an empty dhaba is nothing but a shame. 

Hot crisp tandoori rotis with spicy kadai chicken, creamy chicken bharta and  robust keema  was what made this place ( and still does ) an all time favorite joint. Coming from a vegetarian family and still being a hard core non vegetarian this place came as my savior for after school meals with friends and also a brilliant place for  treating friends for birthday treats. The in your face blue oil paint on the walls was what we laughed about but still loved the place, 

The chicken tikka and the fish tikka and tangri kebabas  were a regular feature in each meal ( even now ). Although I had issues with hygiene even then and I have them now . But there was never a complaint about food taste. The rotis and naans were always crisp. 

As we aged a little it was after party hours where they would serve the food on the car and they were open to 3 am , Serving some piping hot food to late night eaters. 

then came the phase when a certain artist who patronized the place made a movie GAJAGAMINI .... and suddenly everyone knew the dhaba on ballugunj circular road and that the artist loved the place and he pained a masterpiece on their wall that depicted Madhuri. Till then azad hind was a humble dhaba . And then there was no looking back . Azad hind is now a brand in the punjabi food scene of kolkata, and thankfully so the food still tastes  nice and i still love the keema and tangri kebab . 

p.S. liver is not always available but when ever it is... it is mind blowing .

A "Dhaba" as we generelly mean it sounds quite out of place in a very posh area like Ballygunj Circular Road.But thankfully it only "sounds" out of place and by no means does it "taste" out of place!! 
I have been to this place 3 or 4 times and each time I have been satisifed with the food.This is one of those restaurants which serve good tasty food at reasonable prices.The place offers Indian Cuisine and the food here is very tasty to say the least.Among the items that I really like are the tandoori chicken,dal tarka,palak paneer and the chicken butter masala.The butter nan is also very good.It is nice soft and buttery.
To add to the tasty food,the service is very fast and the prices are quite reasonable.Another advantage of this place is that it remains open till midnight.So if you are looking for a late night dinner then there are very few better options.
The place has both an ac and a non ac section.There is even a facility to have your food outside in your own car.But there is nothing to write about ambience and decor.The place is always crowded and it is quite noisy.The cleanliness and hygiene is also not the best.If you are concerned about hygiene and ambience,then this is probably not the place for you.
In short this is no place for fine dining.But the quality of the food will not let you down and it will not be heavy on your pocket.

I am very frequent here. At times, going several times in a week. We go there for their food. Crispy tandoori roti, anda Tarka, chicken hussaini, lacha onion (not sure about the hygiene of the onions, though), channa, paneer tikka, and their ultra quick service (which makes me believe that most of the stuff is pre-made). Lot of times my family order for soda sikanji and masala cola. 

I am not sure about the place's overall hygiene, though. Also, they are not the cheapest dhabha in the town. 250 per head would be easy if any non-veg item is on your order.

a few days back i revisited azad hind dhaba and we ordered chicken bharta, butter naan, paneer butter masala, chana masala, I must say the food was great, the standard has been good. The food prices are also economical and hight affordable by all. I only have one thing to point out that one should be careful with the salad that they serve at times the onions in it are a bit off, since the salad is cut long time, the salad most of the times is off and should be avoided. Even the deco should be done up a bit  as compared to the other good restaurants the interiors of the restaurant is shabby.



----- 17 Sep, 2013 -----

On saturday lot of friends visited Azad Hind Dhaba, in terms of deco its not so chick like the other restros but certainly when it comes to the food its just awesome, we ordered the nan rotis and the aloo dum and the dal, keema and a glass of fresh lime juice. I simply loved the food. One thing for sure if at 1am i am hungry and need a place to satisfy my hunger certainly azad hind is the place to be in. The food is certainly economical. 

There was no soap near the basin neither any hand towels were available so these needs to be seen by the management.



----- 07 Jul, 2013 -----

I have tasted the grub at azad hind dhaba many times, although the place is nothing to rave about but certainly the food is good. I must tell you that the chicken bharta, butter nans, channa masala, aloo mutter, chicken kebab masala, dal makhani, and palak paneer... thinking about all these food items will certainly make your mouth water, and these were the items that i ordered and are highly recommended to taste at azad hind dhaba. 

The one thing good about azad hind is that the production time is so fast that people do not have to wait for long to get a look into the restaurant. More so if people have their own cards then they need to have to sit and eat the food in the restaurant and they can easily sit in their own cars and turn on the ac and enjoy meals on wheels.

But if you are person a stickler for health and hygiene then this is not the place for you to try eating because you may not like get the up and neither is the place spic and span like the other restaurants that you get in the city.

Naan kababs and any chicken dish is my patent order, each time I come here. Sometimes I add some veg dish. You will get "A typical dhaba" like food with urban touch in it. u cannot miss veg item here. its as equal as non veg item serve here. Staffs are well manner. But had a bad experience once so as a friendly suggestion just check your bill once  before paying.

Too good a dhaba! Located in a posh Ballygunge Circular Rd area & easily accessible from most parts of Kolkata. I come here very often, as this is located at a very close proximity from my residence and offcourse due to its economical charges. The best part is, its open till midnight, which makes it a very versatile restaurant for people like me!

Reason I am rating it 'four', is firstly due to its excellent serving punctuality. Secondly, the food which I consider 'awesome' according to its price- the Chicken butter masala & palak paneer are my all time favourite picks. Also to a certain extent, I feel their service is extremely good. I always find the waiters very faithful & has always accepted every tip ranging from ten to fifty rupees in a happy manner. Also the provision for dining in your own car outside gives you an opportunity to dine in private and off course it keeps you away from the noisy interiors. That reminds me; the ambience didnt please me much. However that wont bother much as long as you let the food compensate it all.

In overall, like I mentioned, its a very versatile restaurant. Ideal for hanging out with people late at night over dinner. The only drawback I found is its lack of car park vacany despite of having abundance of park spaces. Otherwise, this place is worth it. Must try folks!! :)

Been here only once during the Pujas, and was still served good food at the middle of the night with prompt service. The quality of food is good and it's all that you would expect at a place serving North Indian. They have an option of serving the food in your car, and that can be very convenient. A good place for a eat in the dead of the night.

Azad Hind Dhaba lacks a good ambience but I the food is a feast to the tongue. It tastes great but doesn't give good facilities to the diners. The Hussain masterpiece that you see on entering the place shows its elegance. The food is great(I wish someone would make that food for me regularly). We had some Rolls which were outstanding and the North-Indian main course was obviously the best you could find in the area. It lacks a proper washroom, a waiting area and some basic necessities. Overall its a great place to eat.

If I'm not wrong this is the very first restaurant that got the 'Dhaba' culture to Kolkata. The place is located just before rainy park opposite Dominos Ballygunge. Firstly the ambience is very very ordinary and definitely doesn't attract you. The food is not bad but quite spicy and seems unhygienic. I don't understand how come this place is always so crowded I guess its good fate. I would not come here on purpose but maybe if there is no other option left then I would consider going to Azad Hind Dhaba. I'm definitely not in love with this place but still will give it 3 because you see I'm not that mean. But It deserves around 2 according to me.

Azad Hind Dhaba - just the dhaba to go down to when travelling in the  the long dusty highways.
This place is too much modernised to be called a dhaba because regular dhabas don't have air
-conditioning and such stuff and thus, I don't know why these people call it a dhaba. This place gives average food(very oily food which is of course what all dhabas offer , so don't come here on a diet) in good quantity but nothing exceptional. The butter naan  is very oily and tasty, the dal makhani and the chicken dishes especially  the chicken bharta is really good though I wouldn't reccomend  the pakoras or the biriyani. The Biriyani is good in quantity but not good in taste; lacks flavour .The prices are cheap . The food all in all almost value for money.

Well, as someone who has grown up in Kolkata, the name Azad Hind is synonymous with amazingly tasty, 'dumdaar' dhaba food. This is the 'original' Azad Hind in Kolkata, and believe me the taste at the various Azad Hinds is still a bit different from this one.

I'm a vegetarian, so cannot comment on the non-veg dishes (Although everyone I know loves it). The Paneer Tikka and Tandoori Alu are tops, and so are dishes like Palak Paneer, Paneer Butter Masala, Alu do Pyaza and Paneer do Pyaza. The Butter Naans are simply fantastic, and fresh rotis and Rumaali Rotis are well done too. The rolls here are extremely popular too. The veg roll here is still the tastiest I've had in Kolkata.

But my absolute favourite here has to be the Dal Makhani, which is definitely the best dhaba-style Dal in town. While dhabas like Jai Hind might be slightly less oily or a touch lighter on the stomach, going here for the dal alone is worth it.The Dal Tadka is really good too.

On the negative side, If you're ordering from home, the rotis' quality suffers a bit, and the restaurant could definitely be slightly cleaner, especially since they've jacked up the prices in recent years.

If you are the type of a person who would rather travel on the highway just to stop by the odd dhaba and gorge in on the local cuisine, you will like this place. I have always been charmed by dhabas, and this is no exception. The freshness quotient of the food is very high, which is something I love.

The quality is also very good, although it is slightly more oily. But this is not a place where you go with your physician! The naan is soft and fantastic to taste. The chicken bharta is also yummy. The biriyani though not one of the best is definitely much above average. The quantity and helpings are huge. Even a foodie like me is satisfied with just one helping usually! The service and ambience are not so great. But the food is compelling. It is served piping hot and fresh, which I reiterate, is one of their biggest positives.

Verdict: Cheap and affordable rates against pretty good food!

Good food, authentic taste. After the first time I ordered from here I have been a fan of their food. I have tried fish tikkas, rolls, gravies from here in a span of a week and I am glad to say it all tasted great. Just one con is that they dont serve onions with the food..

I am a pure dhaba food lover. It is located very near to my house and almost all the time i ask them for home delivery. In dhabas i mostly eat tandooris and kababs followed by Indian recipes. No special ambiance is present here. it is just located opposite of Domino'z pizza and beside Shimla Tailors. Service is well and food quality is wonderful. Here,I like their chicken tandooris,and partially the Chinese dishes. I also love their Tarkas and Chicken Rogan Josh. I am not a mutton lover so most of the time i have chicken. The best thing here is that it is air-conditioned and pricing is reasonable. The Rumali rotis and naan are fantastic here and i have felt that having rotis and naans in the restaurant than having in homes tastes better. I love going there but i also like this dhaba's name-"AZAD HIND". But still i think that Jai hind Dhaba is better than this. Now time for marks:
service-3on5
food quality-4on5
quantity-4on5
ambience-2on5
Folks you must have food here if you are crazy about Dhaba foods. 4 stars from me.

Been a Dhaba fan for over 20 years ..... and this is one place am always ready to go eat at. They make a good tandoori chicken .... and a good reshmi kebab. Their Dal Tadka is really excellent as is their Alu do Piaza ... I also recommend their Chicken Bharta and Paneer Butter Masala. Both the naan and tandoori rotis are really good as well. Their rolls are decent not the best I have had but a special mention should be made for their Cheese Roll. All the guys out there who love cheese should try it.

Azad Hind Dhaba.. Located in Ballygunj Circular Road.. 
I am not at all impressed with the food provided here :/
At least not with the vegetarian fare - I found them pretty tasteless.. given the hype. the food is highly on the oily side (punjabi food doesn't need to be drenched in oil to be tasty, believe me i have tasted some).. but yes the naan are soft probably one of the better ones I've had. The service is moderately efficient. Although it is very affordable but taste comes first. I've had much better food at other dhabas. 
One and a Half Stars from Me.

I think its safe to say that I am their biggest new-age fan, given that I had first been to this place as a little boy some 12 years ago. Back then, there was no indoor air conditioned room like there is today and one had to basically pop their car's bonnet to double up as the dining table.

The Palak Paneer and the Dal Makhani are out of this world and go well with the big fat Butter Naans they serve. Its good to see this place doing so well today. It has become a part of the city in itself and if you ever do find yourself in the city of joy, Azand Hind is where you will truly find it.

Best dhaba-style punjabi food I have had till date. Their double-mirch tarka is a must-have along with rumali roti(s). Do not leave without trying Hussain's chicken, which is a kind of chicken bharta prepared as per M. F. Hussain's personalized specifications. Their lassi, kathi rolls, kebabs are reasonably good.
