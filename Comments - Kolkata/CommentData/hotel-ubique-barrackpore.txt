Located opposite to the Administrative Building of Barrackpore, Ubique has been serving good food since a long time. But on my recent visit found that not only the service has derogated, but also the quantity of the food they serve won’t suffice a kid.
Ambience is pretty good, but to us i.e Foodies, Food comes first, and then everything else.
Loved their Prawn noodles.
Price is on the higher side, compared to the food they serve.

Abience only good.food quality bad. I have taken pure vetki: they told pure, but it is not so good at all.so be aware about that. As from my side it is not at all recommended. 

One more thing they don't add GST on liqueur but on food they add GST  18%. Remember it.

I'm resident near Barrackpore it's been a good place near to visit with your loved ones. The day I had been here with my friends was the best place I figured out among all the others just because of the behaviour they given to us, was indeed a good experience and the food we ordered was Starter: Chilly Baby Corn taste good but standard in quantity, Main Course: Hot Garlic Mix Fried Rice, Mix Hakka Noodles, Mix Gravy Noodles, Sweet n Sour chicken, Masala Kulcha, Dal Makhni etc. All food quite tasty and quality food except the gravy noodles that was a little too light gravy I don't know what goes wrong and the MASALA KULCHA with DAL MAKHNI you must try if you been there. If you order any alcohol be specific while they add water and ice, and the chat with your beer is totally free to put your calories up so eat less to stay fit ha ha ! Beer is cheap
Not to Clean Not to dirty !
Overall 6 out of 10

Many people may not know of this place but the quality of food may put renowned restaurants of kolkata to shame. Located in the outskirts if city this place offers a calm and serene atmosphere. One who visits this place must try fish with veg garden.

You guys must try their fish fry. I loved that. But their chicken tandoori was not so good. And then I ordered hakka chow.. that was okaish. I want to go there again just for fish fry.

Had a horrendous experience arranging a wedding at the venue.  The owner is a conman and hustles money by any means. Fraud, avoid at all cost.
