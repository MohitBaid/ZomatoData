I think this restaurant doesn't know what a "Food Court" actually means.I ordered food in their food court section and it took 30 minutes to arrive.Coming to the food cheese corn garlic bread was okayish and wrap was like a kathi roll cut into half and tasted nothing great.I'm giving them two stars because i left my bag in the outlet and the guys kept that safely and returned it to me.

The only items that I have tried here are Chilli Paneer Roll, Paneer Tikka Roll and Veg Noodles. In terms of taste and preparation the Rolls were super but the Noodles could have been better.

Well if you go by the rating..then you may never Visit it...but I would suggest..just go and try once...the food there is more than what is expected from what they are rated...
Had a b'day celebration there....
Over all experience was good....
Humble staff... Average interior...
Biggest let down was their spaghetti sizzler and tiranga rice...worst thing was that they served cold drink in plastic glasses...
When we talk about food..
It was up to the mark...no complain as such...aloo dum...kofta...Dal Makhni...naan...masala Kulcha...spring roll..babaycorn...shahi bharwa aloo...
The Best was Paan Ice Cream...it was way too delicious... amazing... overall average experience..!!

It's for vegetarians only... The place is good... Quick service... The quantity of food provided was not enough as its price... By the price was fare... Everything was good good... Nt that like awesome... 

The main thing I saw in the restuarant that at the washroom gate it was written that the washroom can be used by guest only no outsiders are allowed n if someone else use a fine of Rs 500 will be charged...

This is the state of India wherein restaurant charge penalty for using washrooms that too a ladies also. I would like to share the incident that happened with me today wherein I requested the manager of Go Foodiezz restaurant in bangur Avenue kolkata to use washroom wherein he upfront rejected saying that he cannot allow outsiders to use washrooms. I said I will purchase something it's urgent please allow me to use it,but he was very arrogant and denied access to the same. They also have pasted a notice outside the washroom stating that it is strictly prohibited for outsiders to use toilet and a penalty of 500 would be charged for the same. I had earlier read an article on scoopwhoop.com wherein they have mentioned that as per Indian Sarais Act 1867 you can ask for drinking water and use the washroom for free from any hotel at any time,  I don't know whether we have this right or not. Check the below evidences and conversation with the management.

Today I had sent our driver for bringing vada pao from Pepperz in Bangur and chowmin from Bangur Veg Dhaba. Everything was mentioned in a piece of paper which I gave it to him. He mistakenly went to a restaurant right beside Pepperz in bangur named "Veg Foodies" because he doesn't know how to read and he had no mobile phone so that I could guide him. In spite of reading everything on the paper Veg foodies owner did not guide our driver that he was in a wrong restaurant rather just placed the order and handed over the stuff to him. Shame on the restaurant owner, he denies that he did not see the paper in his hands but had given exactly one plain vada pao,one cheese vada pao and a vegetable chowmin which was mentioned in that paper and which our driver did not know.
Cheap tricks won't get you good business, good food and right attitude will.

This restaurant is the worst restaurant I have ever been to.. the staff is totally unskilled and it seems that they are just out of some hangover!  The owner- I think he is the most rude person I have ever met! He is devoid of sense and hospitality!  This stupid restaurant makes customers seated and then make them wait fr around 1 or more hour without even serving water! Then after an hour they take the order and behave as if nothing happened!  Moreover it seemed that they forgot to actually place the order to the chef ... Sadly after all this nuisance they ask customers to wait for another half n hour for food ( already having waited for 1.5 hours) because surprisingly They Are Running A Fine Dine Restaurant which will and obviously can take such long time to prepare food as proclaimed by the Owner! The most unexpected behaviour of them was that -they forcefully pushed  a reputed family with kids and ladies out of the restaurant( after keeping then waited fr 2 or more hours)  when they asked for an explanation regarding the food !   They are just a bunch of lazy lads trying to earn money by doing nothing!

Ps - I was the fourth customer on the row to leave the place!

Note- There are no food reviews since I couldn't eat anything there!

Got food delivered to my home. Placed the order on Zomato. Food was delivered on time. And surprisingly the food was very well packed. Coming to the taste. Veg platter was good, that shami was my fav. Paneer Makhani was also good. Paneer was amazingly soft and moist. Tasted good and wasn't oily at all. So thumbs up for that. Butter naan, Masala kulcha and pyazzi missi; all three were worth the money spent. All in all, I'll recommend this place to people.

Ok, never ever going back again to this place
I really was hungry but ended up being highly disappointed
Ordered for idli and dosa.
The idli was cold leave apart it being soft
The dosa looked at if it has been just somehow given to us since we have ordered it
The coconut chutney, very very thin, and tasted bland even a basic salt was missing
The sambhar is what is giving u guys 1.5 otherwise would have given u 0 on the ratings
Definitely not coming back again..!!

Located near supermarket, bangur. This place is easy to find with decent interiors, but food lack proper cooking. The management is extra friendly, more than what makes us comfortable. They come to take back plates even before one is done eating and stand there till the person takes their last 2-3 bites, what makes it horrible is when you have 3-4 people to take that plates and blocking the whole table.

We ordered the most basics things:
1. Crispy chilli babycorn was sluggy, minimal sauce 2/5.

2. Mixed sauce pasta, which had only pasta, seriously no vegetables, as you serve a toddler who picks out vegetables to throw out. Over that the sauce was as thin as the water served. Seriously the worst pasta we all ever had.

3. Then we tried something new, which was called papad tacos, but the waiters could call it just papad, the papad was over fried with oil comming up in our hands, the filling was basically something sort of rajma, eating which tasted as if left over vegetables are completed with papad at home. Over it there was no sause or chutneys in it this time, had to complete it with ketchup.

Was very hungry yesterday night, still didn't dare to order anything more, we then switch to another restaurant nearby and completed our meal.

“The best experience on that area, dare to say the best vegetarian option on the whole avenue.”

Veg Foodiez is a place that is divided in two, an small fresh eatery where I have been countless of times and a formal dinning room, which of course also serves lunches. The place is impeccable, the food is superb, the service is excellent. The prices are affordable and the whole experience is just well worthy. Is an smart business too, since they have options more informal in the fresh eatery, like doshas and soft drinks and wraps, they were pretty smart to have an small but very cool place on the whole VIP road, where you can order the food on the ground floor and eat on the top of the very well designed terrace tree with a nice view of the recently beautified area. The quality does not decrease, on top of all? they have also delivery. Amazing place.

One of the rare occasions when I tried a veg restaurant. Quite counter- intuitively, this restaurant turned out to be rather a good one. Despite having only vegetarian food, the quality and taste were worth savouring. 
I ordered a Manchow soup and a Garlic Hakka Noodles. The soup was very well made, the quantity was just about perfect and the different flavours in my mouth were an added bonus. 
The noodles were great too, however, the quantity was a bit on the downside. A single person can definitely eat through a full plate easily. 
The service and the decor were pleasant. Not exceptional, not dreadful.

Located near supermarket area in bangur it is a pure veg joint offering north Indian , south Indian and Chinese cuisine. I went to this place, with my friends, for a late lunch. The interiors were bright and soothing and the seating arrangement was convenient. 

We ordered paneer makhni Punjabi, frontier dal makhni and mix vegetable. 
The dal makhni was insipid , which was a major drawback as this is one of the most common dishes ordered at veg joints and they  should have done better to keep it up to the mark.
The Paneer was soft, which is unlikely nowadays in restaurants. The gravy was delectable with perfect spices. But the winner was, unexpectedly, the mix veg. The dish was prepared without gravy which made it possible to relish the taste of each and every bit which had gone into its making. The vegetables were fresh and properly cooked.

Among breads, we ordered- garlic naan , tandoori roti and masala kulcha. Apart from the kulcha , the other breads arrived cold and had become a bit hard. A big error. However, the second helping was just fine.
Coming to the service , it was not satisfactory at all. Although we were the only customers at the time we placed the order , we had to wait quite a bit before the food was served. Overall it was an OK experience. 
Decent food ,delightful ambience but poor service. Hope it gets better.

I  have to vote this  one for the worst restaurants visited in 2014. They should rename their restaurant as go fooling. They fool their customers , that's what they are good at and not in cooking food.  They have opened a restaurant and a coffee hut both located in bangur. 

The go foodiez coffee hut is just opposite to bangur dominos. It's serves sandwhiches, pakoras, garlic bread, coffee. The machine coffee looks nice but the rest is all average. Plus their chef who are totally amateurs are not consistent in preparing food, every day you get a new taste, I mean every day the food quantity and quality is degrading.  I also had a talk with its owner who claims that their vada pao are really awesome , but turned out to be a crap. I have tasted around 75% of their menu items in the coffee hut , but nothing new.  The pakoras were not fresh, it was made before and kept openly. Later I complained to the owner, a Maru who tried every thing to defend his coffee hut and his restaurant when I complained  regarding the food . And the way he was telling as if he was proud of his restaurant. 

I would rate the go foodiez coffee hut as 3.5 . I'm just being lenient here , theres nothing new except for the packaging of the pakoras which is in a Chinese kinda noodle box.

Second the restaurant. Main center of attraction. Now this is the reason why I rated it the worst restaurant of the year.  Prices of the main course , naan , kulcha are overpriced.  The naan was hard , you can instantly feel it when you try to break it into 2 halfs. After eating few bites I complained to the waiter about the naan being not fresh and food quality not according to our expectation. In return they said our food is totally fresh sir, i mean do you think I will buy that.plus the service is pretty average. You have to ask for water every time. The waiter don't take proper care of you while your eating. They all gather in one side and gossip while you eat. It's a pretty low class restaurant with high prices. 
Talking about individual dishes, you won't find half the items in the menu. After reading the reviews below, thank god we didn't went for their pizza. Even the desert are also disappointing.  

I think the owner needs to rethink otherwise this restaurant is not surviving for sure. Even though they try hard with their mini van advertising all over Bangur and lake town in the evening. They have been advertising since past 6 months,  so that ppl like us can be their victim.

I'd  say avoid the restaurant if you can. Also the ratings given below as 4.5 and 5 are all fake reviews.

The service is very slow, the staff are untrained and the food is overpriced with small serving portions. We ordered a sabz bahar pizza but it had mostly carrots and beans in it and tasted terrible. We complained to the chef and manager but they were pretty arrogant and we got billed for it even though we had not eaten it.
