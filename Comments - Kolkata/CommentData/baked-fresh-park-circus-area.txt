Situated right behind the quest, it has the position at its advantage with an ice cream parlour beside. Had dropped to catch a birthday cake. In choice was a butterscotch flavoured which was quintessential both in flavour and representation. Besides , the mousse and the apricot delicacies were well savoured. A definite pit stop for your sweet tooth

As the name includes" Fresh", the confectionery items are actually very fresh . I love the burgers that are on offer. Also I liked all the desserts and pastries. Never been disappointed with the menu. Only thing which lacks in this place is the space. It's very narrow. There could have been a sitting area as well.

Too often I grab a bite in this place. They have good collection of Pestry. Snacks are of average quality though. Overall it's nice place...

You will find it just as you move out from the parking lot qwest mall gate-6. Crossed this shop many times but this time I decided to enter after a friend suggested it to be a good. Its actually good tried three things Choco delight, coco piramid and choco mousse as these were the only 3 vegetarian options available. They have a friendly staff and highly courteous. Will try cakes from here next time.
Earnest request to add more vegetarian options

Located right behind Quest Mall, this is a tiny shop. Air conditioned and clean, it has a variety of cakes, pastries and other savory items. The blueberry cheescake is very very soft and very very delicious. It, quite literally, melts in your mouth. Another favorite is the choco bite, which is a chocolate pastry loaded with chocolate goodness. The chocolate mousse deserves a special mention. It is served on a chocolate bowl, topped with chocolate ganache and chocolate chips. There were also a few chocolate pound cakes on display.
Coming to the savoury items, the cheese chicken puff is my favorite, along with the chicken cutlet. The chicken is soft and very flavorful.
The cons of this place are that it is really very small. There is just enough space to stand. Also, the prices are a little on the higher side but considering the taste, totally worth it. A slice of cheesecake and chocolate bite were for Rupees 45, the Chocolate mousse was for 50.
Definitely good enough for all those sudden chocolate cake cravings.
