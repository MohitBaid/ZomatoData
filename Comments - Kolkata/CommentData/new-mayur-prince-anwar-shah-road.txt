We often order food from this place. They have a seating arrangement but it is too small and no ac so the best option is home delivery or a takeaway.. there portions are enormous. One plate of chowmein or fried rice is sufficient for two people and you will not be disappointment considering the price! Extremely affordable.

Awesome restaurant for Chinese food.Probably best Chinese u can get at lake gardens.You can dine in their but the space is very little and has only 2table and very congested.So I would prefer to takeaway from there.Giving 4star only because some items are highly overpriced.

A small takeaway joint located in the bylanes near the Super Market off Prince Anwar Shah Road. Seating arrangement consists of only 2 tables with 4 chairs each. In view of this limited seating capacity, home delivery or takeaways are preferable.

As far as the food is concerned, it's very good and consistent (even during Durga Puja rush) in terms of both quality and quantity. Delivery is also prompt. The menu provides a wide selection of dishes. The food is tasty and always seems fresh. Prices are affordable too.Umesh Sharma

Simple good food. You wanna have Bengali Chinese this is the place. Try stuff like manchurian fried rice, hot garlic chicken and the standard chilly chicken.

Mayur is a old joint in new location in Lake Gardens. The now restaurant is a 8 seater setup but they primarily it remains a take away and home delivery setup. Like many small Chinese outlets they have managed to Indianise the flavours which works. I recommend the chilly chicken. Portions of whatever they serve are handsome.

A shack of a place near lake gardens supermarket, this is a foodies delight. You won't get good tables or nice glasses or even a very nice ambience here BUT what you will get here is amazing food at very cheap price. They serve pretty huge quantities and they don't even compromise on quality. The people working here are nice and this is probably the one place where I can go undecided, just tell the cook to give me something nice and  fresh and NOT be disappointed at all. A must for all foodies. Look out especially for the starters and soups. The dragon chicken is a speciality.

Don't judge the book by its cover" this quote goes with this restro. Situated in the bylane jst beside the habibs while ur heading towards lords from anwarsha crossing. Truely speaking its difficult to find. But once u visit there u jst can't resist urself from revisiting this small joint again and again. Dining here is a little difficult bcoz they only have 2tables and 8chairs. Bt still we found this joint empty in an evening and ordered dragon chicken,mixed noodles and mixed schezwan rice. After almost 10 mints..they served us the piping hot noodles first and later the starter dragon chicken followed by the rice. Coming to taste the noodles was over loaded with small bits of egg and chicken. Rice was little spicy but the sauce that went into it was tasty. It was served hot with loads of shredded eggs and chicken. Now coming to the dragon chicken it was the star of the evening...soft long tender pieces of chicken Stringed in skewers and cooked in a spicy sauce. The taste is jst out of the world. Pocket pinch was 400 bucks. Its truely a hidden gem. 

P.s-Everyone must try The dragon chicken. Thanks to my partner for ordering that dish.

This small Chinese restaurant is located between lake gardens and dhaka kalibari stoppage on the prince anwarshah road beside the lane of habib's hair salon.

Now coming to their ambience i must say it is mainly a take away joint where 6-8 people can dine in too. Hence nothing special with their interior decoration. I had always brought the foods to my place so never dined in there.

The quality and also the quantity of the foods they served at that rate of price is really impressive. I had been having their dishes since ages but the quality never dropped which is so good to see in the modern days.

I am writing this review based on my recent experience at this restro so i must share all in details.

I had brought mixed fried rice along with chilli chicken and hongkong chicken.
The mixed fried rice was very tasty. I was full of chicken pieces and prawns.
The chilli chicken was as usually superb. But what surprised me the most was hong kong chicken. I was not sure how it would taste but having it i must thank myself for buying it. It was just mind blowing.
Their packaging was also very good. Hence some good rating for their efforts...

This joint is located near Lake gardens super market . It's pretty tiny with just 2 tables in there.But they serve amazing chinese dishes.I have ordered gazillions of times from this joint.Their red pepper chilli garlic chicken,crispy fried fish and dragon chicken are the dishes to die for . Other items are great as well.And they serve huge portions.Undoubtedly,this is a hidden gem.

This is a very tiny joint with a seating capacity of around 8 people and they mostly cater to takeaways and to bulk orders. Now coming to the food... It serves brilliant Chinese food at such reasonable price so hats off to them. Don't judge this place by its looks. Just go for it :-D.

We have always been chinese food freaks. And this place offers you the best in terms of quantity, quality and price. A group of seven people can have a good dinner within 900 bucks. It is mainly a takeaway joint, although they do have a sitting area (two tables, perhaps). But it's a dial-a-Chinese corner for us. The food they dish out are really delicious. We specially love their manchurian and szechuan chicken preps, sweet corn chicken soup, and mixed fried rice. They don't have fancy chinese stuff but if you guys want to have basic chinese preps (if you want to spend and, or, don't want to spend), get food and eat at home in peace!

This take away joint has been around Prince Anwar Shah Road for quite some time now. They have a small dine in area. But the quality of food is quite good compared to the rest of the take aways . The prices are quite reasonable. They do home delivery and party orders as well.  They are a regular in our parties . And my friends really like their food. Try out if you are staying in the area.
