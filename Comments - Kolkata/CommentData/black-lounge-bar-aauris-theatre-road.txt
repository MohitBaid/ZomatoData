Have visited twice here with my friends and last time with my mother. The first time i been there was amazed by the decor . Staffs are very attentive and quick service. Loved the music,dj xavier and dj felix took the vibes to a different level üòç !! I‚Äôd recommend their hip-hop night definitely as it‚Äôs also a ladies night!! And big thanks to the hotel manager Souraj , for taking care of us!!

Went here few days ago for a party where DJ Xavier was playing. They have a strict dress code and does not allow random people to enter. For girls, the drinks was free and since it was a party night, there was a lot of crowd inside. We didn't eat anything but we had a lot of alcoholic drinks. The place is small and it's full of smoke which makes it difficult for people to open their eyes even. Nevertheless the crowd was nice and I had a nice time over there.

Terrible service, no knowledge of menu...very few options in the restaurant. Waiters not sure of menu either. Open air place had a stink... very displeased, unfortunately so much could be done with a beautiful roof top

Located on top of Auris.This place has a really cool decor,a nice dance floor and overall a nice place to Lounge and Party with friends.The drinks are well constructed.Has good Punch and food is good,They only serve starters,variety is a little limited.However the quality of food they make is worth the price.
The menu on the Tab is a good idea.Hookah is made well too.The Washrooms are neat and we'll maintained.Will be revisiting it with friends for sure...

I went with my best friend/Husband

One of my favorite place. Wednesdays are the best to visit as outside Dj s hits up along with the in-house. Cool ambience along with loud music and obviously with great food.

visited Black lounge bar on being suggested by someone.It is within the Aureus hotel and so they have vallet parking.It seemed to be a cool place with a total black interior but the music was very dull.The happy hours are from 5pm-9 but strangely enough the bar opens at 7pm ! Did not understand the policy ! The staff are well-behaved,polite but not adequately informed about the menu and the food option is extremely limited to hardly 10 items including both veg and non-veg.The menu card which is actually saved digitally in a tablet had  few mistakes in it which made it very difficult to place the order.The schezwan dry chilly chicken tasted somewhat ok but could have been much better although the portion and presentation was nice.The margerita pizza was ordered with three toppings namely onions,sweet corn and chicken tikia and it took more than an hour and repeated reminders to get the pizza served.Finally when it arrived the sweet corn was replaced by tomatoes which was intimated earlier and the waiter stated that they ended up burning the sweet corn hence the replacement with capsicum ! But only tomatoes were seen no capsicum ! Funny enough ! Good thing is the alcoholic beverages,cocktails and mocktails are reasonably priced and even tasted good.The Plum passion had a spicy side to it may be due to chillies added although it was not mentioned in the menu but never mind the spicy taste location there are much better options available.

This review was long pending. The waitors are ill-informed and ill-mannered. When we said that we will give bad review on social media, this guy unabashedly said "do whatever you want". I did not visit this place since then....also thanks to monkey bar, botega and grid. I did not have the need to visit the place also. 
To the management, 
This will continue to happen when you employ uneducated and uncouth staff.

Amazing decor, music is trendy. But what caught my attention was service by in house attendants and the treatment by the manager. Specifically Suresh, his amazing skill behind the bar kept it alive for me, his cocktails are a must try. A place that makes you enjoy a moment? Black it is.

Well after my second visit on 25.06.16,I want to share my experience. Black is spacious, interior seems nice,decent dance floor, crowd was good,limited options in food and beer. They had only 2 options in beer.
In my  view DJ was little cold,he was playing tracks in abrupt manner,the crowd and personally my set of friends were waiting for some good music to dance. 
People serving there seems nice. You should get some good DJ to play during weekends at least who can interact with crowd.

Black located at Robinson street ¬†near to the Shakespeare sarani PS.They have a separate entry to the lounge from the hotel,an elevator take you to the 6th floor ,as you step in you are welcomed with rich black and red interiors with a dash of steel to add to the class and rich taste of its decor. Spacious dance floor must say which can easily accommodate a medium sized crowd.Seating arrangements are done in a section where you can chill and enjoy the music with your group and then step on the dance floor.¬†Crowd profile is good which is a plus and the DJ has the right choice of music to entertain you.The visit was for a birthday bash of a friend ¬†of mine,would suggest the food that I found appealing Lasooni murg tikka, basil sundried hinted murg tikka and jamaican grilled jerk chicken. Coming to the drinks you'll be spoilt for choice to keep it that way...they have cellar which caters to all varieties.Staff are really well trained and are attentive alongside being apt to look into your needs. Price tag is on the higher side keeping in mind the brand value and service you will receive along with the quality of it.Must visit for those who like to party hard and keep it classy at the same time.

Liked the place, but didn't find Crowd so well, I believe to run the club one have to c the crowd, or entry by invitation or proper couple entry, if stag started coming, couple will step backward...
One thing I found best that is Dj raj roy, he was playing awesome...,drinks r quite expensive ....rest all well....

Black lounge is all about shoddy service, minimal choices to eat, mediocre food and incorrect billing. It's not worth the pricing. They are relatively new, so may be given time, they may pull up their sock.

Black lounge has an amazing interior. Everything in black and red, and nicely decorated. Talking about the food, they just had 5 veg dishes. We had Chilli potato, paneer tikka, Mongolian platter and Italian platter. Food was average. Hookah was good. Unless the food menu is properly done, the place loses all the magnetism. Score is solely for the chic black interiors, that is justifying their name.

Black is a great place to enjoy ur evening with lively and fun loving crowd. It had trendy live music and DJ - spun tunes made the place more happening . Lounge is innovative ly designed with the high celienged aircraft, red dark lights, steal metal chairs sitting nicely arranged and outside area has patio which gives a impressive view of Kolkata city. Drinks were creative and nicely made specially the signature cosmopolitan and appetizers were fantastic, very courteous, welcoming and hardworking staff. Overall this place is spectacular, MUST VISIT ..üç∑üëØüíÉ
