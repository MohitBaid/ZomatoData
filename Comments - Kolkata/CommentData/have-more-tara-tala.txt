Have More-This is the first multicuisine restaurant in Garden Reach,Kolkata as per my knowledge.

Well I've been there many times because it's just few minutes walking distance from my home.I like the the decor and the interior design which catches me most of the time when I visit there...

Now coming to the food they have many varieties of kebas. I preferred to try those kebabs but there biriyani quality is decreasing day by day when it comes to compare to the other restaurants of the locality and if you are in "have more" u must try the *chicken schewan noodles * I think this is the best dish in have more...

Staffs and Management - Service is good as well as the staffs but in the occasion time they are little bit slow.

I was amazed by the quality of biryani they served during the initial days. But nowadays,¬†their biryani quality is worst among all other Mughlai restaurants. First time I noticed the bad quality when I tried biryani during kali puja, 2016. Again the same quality I found when I tried biryani for the second time in February 2017. The flavour in the biryani is completely gone. I don't think I shall do the same mistake again. I say big NO to biryani of HAVEMORE.

In a place where people rarely understand the concept of fine dining, Have More is the closest they can go to luxury food. And that is the reason the restaurant is doing such good business. Compared to the better restaurants of the city, it hardly stands a chance but for the amazing portions they serve, and naturally, the place where it's located. The decor deserves mention for the simple but elegant look. They also have a side snacks shop that make rolls and likes for take aways. The main restaurant serves Chinese, Indian both and the portions, as I said, are plentiful and the taste is quite good for the money that they charge. I especially love their Momos - the size is enormous and there's 8 pieces of it  - almost good enough to pass off as dinner and the accompanying broth is as good! Overall, a good place to drop in if you're a local resident or are around for some work (there's a high chance you won't find anything better) to have a filling meal without much burn to the pocket.
