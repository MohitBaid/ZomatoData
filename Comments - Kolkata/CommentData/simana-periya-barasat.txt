It's a pocket friendly restaurant. Their food quality is very good. But it's ambiance could be better. I won't say it bad, it can be justified for the pricing.

One of the tastiest Biriyani makers in the locality. I visit this place just for that. The amount and taste is totally worth the price.
Location is good. Services are okay.

One of the tasty biriyani maker in Barasat area. Me and my colleagues tasted chicken biriyani some days ago. You can easily found this outlet. In the puja and kalipuja season you can taste this for once.
