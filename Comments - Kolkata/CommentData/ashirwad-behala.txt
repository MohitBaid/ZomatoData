Ordered food (maharaja thali, aaloo dum & methi paratha) for the first time through Swiggy.. Very bad experience.. Requested for onions and green chillies which wasn't delivered and all the veggies were in the same gravy.. Pathetic experience.. Seems left over food was delivered.. The methi paratha was smelly.. Overall a very unpleasant experience.. Wouldn't recommend..

Food quality and ambience is so so. But quantity is really good. Service is so so but really affordable. Price worthy in one word. One can try for a casual dining.

Ordered online and was delighted with the quality and quantity delivered. This is a must try for thali eaters as you wont miss anything in your diet.

I didn't like the vegetables they served. Taste was not as per expectations. I do not have anything else to say, just increasing characters upto 140.

I ordered a dal makhani, malai kofta, rumali roti and laccha paratha.
The food wasnt good at all. Malai kofta was too spicy. The sweetness was lacking.

My #100thReview
ordered 1 Mini Meals & 1 Maharaja Combo through swiggy!

starting off with the Mini Meals it contained...
Mix vegetable, aloo dum, dal tadka, choice of naan or roti, rice, salad, pickle & papad.

Maharaja contained...
Mix vegetable, corn palak, paneer of the day or malai kofta, dal makhani, 1 missi roti, stuffed paratha or naan, pulao or biryani, sweet, raita, pickle & papad.

we took Naan (2) from Mini Meals & from Maharaja we took Malai Kofta , Stuffed Paratha (2) & PulaoÂ 

food was fresh but somehow we didn't like it!! as there was no taste! the food was way too spicy and it had no taste! aloo dum was somewhat red in colour , malai kofta had no malai or kofta , didn't got dal makhani , missi roti was worst!! hard like hell tastes like red chilli roti , pulao worst!! we saw the menu card it says they don't use onion or garlic in food.. but there was no masala also.. anyways out of all we loved the Stuffed Paratha it was awesome!! other than that leaving the 1 piece gulab jamun nothing tasted yummy!! quantity was huge we couldn't finish all at last.......

2 from my side!

Good place for vegetarians to order, especially thali! Food is not that spicy and one can avail Jain thali as well. The quantity is not much and the price for the thali is okayish.
