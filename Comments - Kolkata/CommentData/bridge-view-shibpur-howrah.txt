I like their chicken rolls really .. Good size , great quantity ..lovly taste ..but the other food not so good ..i like to eat their rolls ..they are not cheap but pocket friendly as well . The ambiance is very bad . .. It is better to pack your food and eat after going home ðŸ˜‚.. As the taste of the rolls are really good .. I would like to rate it 3.5 .. ðŸ˜Š

I am in just love to eat the foods of this place. It is very near to my place. I usually eat the foods from here almost twice or thrice a month. 
Roll is one of the famous item. But I love to eat chicken kabab, mixed fried rice, chili chicken, tandoori ruti, rumali ruti. For chicken kabab, they served with green chutney and salads. Mixed fried having so many veggies and shrimps, shredded chicken,eggs, It's taste like heaven.They usually don't make it so spicy, so combination with the chili chicken and it's gravy enhanced the taste. But yes I don't like the chili paneer here, basically it is tasteless. 
Ambience I can't rate because, I always use to purchase and eat their food at home. But yes they make the food fresh. 
So overall I can rate 4 out of 5.

It's take away food is good. The food quality for dine in not so much. Only once dined in this restaurant during Durga Puja and the experience was not very satisfying. The rolls are great though and I would highly recommend it. The price of the rolls may seem a bit high but they are worth it in terms of taste and quantity.

Its a very old place in the Mandirtala Bus Stand area. It started its journey long back when 2nd Hooghly bridge just opened or about to open. Lots of childhood memories are attached with this joint. A small place with not much to describe about interiors or service. But the food quality is decent and pocket friendly. Specially their rolls are one of best in the locality. Recommended for take out.

This place was a hit during it's initial days but now the standard has fallen.Â 
An extremely narrow staircase will lead you to the restaurant is on the 1st floor. Interior is semi dark and gloomy. Service is okayish, there's much scope of improvement.Â 
They make decent Chinese dishes and average kebabs.Â 
Price is on the lower side.

The korma, kasha, bharta, butter masala, all taste almost the same. Food quality is good. Taste is not bad, but, the mughlai side dishes need to vary in taste. It feels like the gravy is the same for all, same color and same taste. They should definitely add biryani. Based on the location and my personal judgement, if they serve biryani, their sales will get a big boost cause people love biryani and the location is a very busy place with no decent biryani shops nearby.

For many people this may not be the restaurant they would give 3.5 rating but for me It's pure nostalgia. Located in Mandirtala this small joint has been around since my childhood. This is the place where i still come to have some delicious outside food without burning my pocket.Â 
The place has no AC, the ambiance is not good at all and the waiters are not up to the mark but the food is awesome to say the least. I would recommend any noodles preparation and kebabs for everyone to try out. Their rolls are also the best in the locality. The prices are very cheap.Â 

Overall rating ..... Not good for the ambiance and service but Great for the food... Try Take Out.. Â  :)

I am an occasional visitor of this restaurant. Food scores high both in terms of quality and quantity. The speciality of this restaurant is The Mixed Chowmein is a Speciality here, and I would recommend anyone to try out the same along with Reshmi Kebab as a starter. But the ambience and overall maintenance of the restaurant is quite poor. Even once I got stinky plate. But the food is among the top in Howrah.

Food quality is good, but they lack professionalism. The restaurant's ambience in the first floor did not seem to appeal much. Constant bells and utensils clutter makes it a Average place overall.
I really like their take away counters under the restaurant, broadly due to their fast service.

This review is totally dependent on the Roll and tandoors they sell. The best ever chicken roll. The famous roll corner of Mandirtala. The taste is soooo good. They also have seating arrangements, but those are really poor and ambience is not so nice.

Not good to dine in. Great for a take out.
Small place on hearts on mandirtala.
Considering all the other restuarants around mandirtala this place is high on the food charts.
I ordered for a take away dinner few days ago. Mixed fried rice and chili chicken. Service was slow but the bill impressed me. All came within 500 bucks.
The fried rice was enough quantity for two hungry souls.chilli chicken was as expected too spicy , but quite tasty. 
Bridge view is one of the oldest restuarants here, not too rich not too low. 
Good enough for me!

This used to be the first restaurant at Mandirtala when the bridge started operating way back in 1993-94. Actually, Mandurtala was not a popular place at that time because the G.T. Road used to be the main arterial road in Howrah and most movie halls and eateries were around there. However, Mandirtala quickly gained prominence and ghe restaurant also started pucking up.

The view used to be quite nice and a cup of coffee / tea with some fish fry etc used to be nice. They served some Indianised Chinese dishes too.

Mainly serve chinese dishes. Though a dishes are a bit over priced than quality wise it would have. I tried mixed chowmin amd red pepper chicken here. Quantity is up to the mark. Recommended Only if you live nearby of this place.

Well, for any kind of rolls and tandoor, it is one of the best places to go.  Price is reasonable according to quality of food.  Due to small place it cannot accomodate many people.  It is the best restaurant in mandirtala area by far.

A very small restaurant outlet, located at the heart of mandirtala bus stand, can hardly accommodate 25 to 30 heads. We ordered tandoori roti and chicken buyer masala from here. Taste of the food was okayish; the butter masala was bit spicy. Price was reasonable according to the taste and quantity.

One suggestion... They could start to include desserts in their menu!

The ambience of this place kind of resembles a miniature version of the India coffee house (though you can't smoke over here). I tried out fish fry with some coffee, the fish fry was good with nice mustard sauce.
Apart from not having a bridge in view, it's a nice place to hang out with friends in the evening. Definitely will visit again.

Once it used to be the centre of attraction of mandirtala area. Now people are more interested in their roll items at the take away counter rather than going for the dine-in. Yesterday I tried the mixed noodles. It was more or less on the okay side. But, the service and the attendees are very laid back. They dont even expect any guests in the place. The ambience is also dull.
