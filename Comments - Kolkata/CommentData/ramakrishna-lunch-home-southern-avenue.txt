If any1 is a South Indian lover den I don't think anybody needs to read it's review n check it's ratings.. Famous among the south Indian restaurants... Vada, Idli, dosa, utapams all r really good n it's sambar chutney are equally tasty... It's masala vada is really crispy... It's managed by the team of Jyoti vihar which is one of the legendary restaurant of kol so no complaints at all... Yes during Sunday evening for packing have to wait in a long que n one of d most preferred break fast place.. Definitely a must visit place...

This is a late upload.  Went there for breakfast with my brother on Kalipujo. Luckily we went there early the queuing started 9.30 am onwards only. Not much to talk about ambience and decor. It has got a plain seating arrangement. 
We ordered sada dhosa and onion sada dhosa and then coffee. Dosa was good . I loved the white chutney. The coffee was served in the south Indian style.
Service is prompt but for parcel they took lots of time. Since we ordered that at the end of our dine . Took more than half an hour because of the rush. They need to work on that, else all good.  
If you want to have yummy south indian dishes at moderate price, do come here.

People also know this place by bhupendra mansion
It is one of the restaurants where the tables are actually occupied by 6:30am
On sunday‚Äôs if you are not in by 6:30am then you got to wait.
The charm of this place is only & only because of its chutney & sambar.
Pure legend of south Indian cuisine.

One of the best south Indian restaurant in kolkata.
It opens at 6 am and is best for breakfast.
The cost of food is also cheap. Our bill was less than 200.

I ordered:
*GHEE MASALA DOSA : This is the best dosa I had in kolkata. Do order this.
*SAMBAR VADA : VADA was also delicious.

P.S This two item was more than enough for two people.

People know this place as Bhupendra Mansion, which is actually the name of the building. One of the most famous South Indian places in Kolkata. It‚Äôs crowded even at 6 in the morning and you might just struggle finding a table. 

We were lucky as we went on a weekday at about 8 in the morning and found a table. 

Ambience: Very, very simple. 

Food: We had ordered 3 Idly-Vadas, 3 Masala Dosas, 2 Onion Uttapams, 2 Filter Coffees and special chutneys. Everything tasted amazing. Food was really good. Idli was softand vadas were perfectly cooked and one of the best I‚Äôve had in Kolkata, the dosas were also really nice but the best thing for me was the Uttapam. Very few places can match the taste. 

Service: Something needs to be done about this. Although the food is great, the waiter brought only 2 dosas instead of 3...upon asking he questions back, ‚Äùthere were three?‚Äù My chair was one of those plastic chairs of really low quality and it was on the verge of breaking. When I asked the steward to replace it, he says nothing will happen. Upon pressing, he finally changed it. 

Price: Slightly higher compared to other South Indian options. 

If you ignore the small issues, it‚Äôs really a must-try though. Just because of the food.

Make a pool of sambhar and chutni in ur plate with idly dipped in it..it only tastes delicious then. And d idlies so soft, it just melts in d mouth..also I love d coffee here. Please open a branch here in beliaghata

Landed up here for those quintessential south Indian breakfast cravings you have living in a hostel. Must say, it was not a bad decision at all. Initially was a bit skeptical of trying this place, considering the variety and options in the menu are limited and a restaurant named 'Rao's Udipi Home'nearby has many more options at a cheaper price. Nonetheless, was not disappointed after dominating Idli, Ghee Paper Plain Dosa, Utthapam, Vada and filter coffee. These were accompanied with unlimited refills of sambar and coconut chutney. The idli was freshly made, almost melt in the mouth. The vada was crispy from the outside and well cooked on the inside and went really well when inundated in sambar. The was well prepared too and you could taste that it was made in ghee. Prompt service, ambience is that of an old house converted to a breakfast serving restaurant, something that you find mainly in South India. Giving it four stars for the relatively high prices and less choices in the menu. Satisfied though.

Ghee masala dosa- I ordered it as I didn't get it anywhere. It was awesome. The aroma of the ghee. With the sambar which was so well prepared and simple. The masala had potatoes in it. The dosage was crispy and simply wow. The coconut chutney was very delicious.

Idly and sambar vada was simple and its simplicity was a sign of authenticity of its recipe.

Uttapam with mixed vegetables and onion- this was another stomach filling delicious dish for our breakfast.

Coffee- strong but not bitter coffee. This was genuine filter coffee. I ordered it twice....

This canteen can easily be overlooked from the streets. But it's a great find.

My workplace is nearby and I need to hit this place quite often.

Perfect place was super melting idlis. It opens at 6 am and is one of my favourite places for South Indian food. The filter coffee is a must try. Though the place is mostly occupied on weekends but hey, there isn't any problem in waiting. The only draw back is that they do not of enough varieties of dosas. Though my fav is the onion masala dosa. Mondays are off days for them so never go to bhupi on a Monday morning you'll be disheartened üòû

The south indian food taste is quite standard, nothing extra ordinary. (Infact I found one South Indian thelawala near ballygunge flyover with fantastic & much better masala dosa).¬†
The price of food items are really on higher side. Coffee is good. If someone don't bother about having Dosa with high price & AC this is the place.

After a very long time decided to go for a South Indian breakfast. A quick search in zomato suggested this place.

Typing bhupendra mansion points out this place in Google. Reached the place without any incident.
A non-descriptive door worth a barely noticeable placard announces it's entry. The place was brimming with people as we made our way inside.The ambience and decor is that of any udipi restaurant.

The food:
The Isis
Idlis were soft and light on the stomach. The vadas crunchy and mouth-watering.The filter coffee one of the best I have ever had. This comes from a guy who has spent a sizeable chunk of his life in Chennai. So I know what an talking about.
The masala dosa and onion uttapam were a bit of a disappointment though.

A must visit for south Indian stuff.

The very fact that there is a queue by 7:30 every Sunday evening says a lot about the place. 
It's an eatery which serves, I believe, not more than 60-70,customers at a time. Maybe less. 
But whatever it serves is mm..mm...(just get the jist.) 
I am not a fan of South Indian cuisine. The only 2 things which I end up having at these eateries is either Vada or Dosa. Yet, after having the usuals at the place I'll accept that this place serves amazing S.I food. 
We had ordered :-
* vada
*dosa
*uttapam
*coffee
Each and everything was amazing. 
The dosa and the vada were crisp, the coffee brewed perfectly. The uttapam was well, nice , considering the fact that I am not a big fan of it. The sambar was good , better than the other places in cal. The coconut chutney was the best I've hat till now. Perfect is the word. Overall an amazing cuisine. 
Moreover, it was affordable. 660 for 8 vadas, 1dosa, 1 uttapam, 6 idlis, 3 coffee. A little to the up side but then there's no compromise with quality or service. 
Anyways, happy dining.

I had been planning to visit this place for a long time. Missed out on the chance once cos it was a Monday and the place was closed. This place is pretty famous , and is infested by the morning walkers and other upmarket crowd of South Kolkata. The main attraction is the tasty and cheap food. Cheap, not as in dirt cheap, but definitely worth the buck.
We had idlys, vada, ghee dosa, masala dosa and filter coffee.
Idli: so soft and tasty!
Vada: perfection. Smooth fluffy interior and crisp exterior. Yum
Masala dosa : average. Masala couldve been much better 
Ghee roast ; pretty standard- crisp and tasty
Filter coffee : yum. Totally refreshing
Special mention : the best of the lot was the piping hot sambar. Yumyum ! We were literally sipping the sambar and ordering more of it.

Pros:
1. Tasty food, amazing sambar
2. Fast and courteous service
3. Hygenic 
4. Well managed q system
5. Pretty good crowd
Cons :
1. Not much of an ambience
2. Expect some waiting time
3. Masala dosa can be way better, like the mylari masala dosas. That would be amazing

If you like south indian, this is the best one. Nothing can beat the Idli, Sambhar, Chutney, Dosa, Onion Uttapam not to miss. End with a traditional coffee.  

Hhmm, just incase you go there do not forget to check hair on dosa. Hahah true :p

The best part is the look is same as it was 20 years back with minor changes. It will recall your teenage days if you were here in those days. 
I wish it remains the same as there should be some places you can recall your old memories with you friends. 
Hats off to it totally.

I had once been here wid my father. Though m very fond of South Indian food, my father was more enthusiastic about this place. 
I took a masala dosa. As heard from my father that it was one of the oldest places serving south indian cuisine and very renowned among the south indians settled here, i was very disappointed with the taste of the food. The mashed potatoes in da masala dosa was tasteless and the sambhar n coconut chutney was very ordinary. I had expected some typical authentic touch to the chutneys atleast.
Another fact that irked me was dat da containers in which dey serve the chutneys n sambhar dal were so tiny. How many times could a person ask for a refill?
My father loves sambhar dal but couldn't satisfy himself. V had to finish our dosa widout da chutneys at the end as v wer embarassed to ask 4 a refill so often.
V decided never to return to this place as Kolkata now offers many places where sumptuous south indian dishes are served.

Good food at good price. Swift service. Highly recommended. Have visited only once, but planning to go soon. Dosa and idli are a must try...

An extremely popular place among the locals and a premier South Indian restaurant in this city, this outlet has been in operation for quite some time now. Although, I have been here only once, I can hardly find any issue to provide negative opinions about this place.

The restaurant is air-conditioned which can be a blessing in disguise in this scorching heat of summer. The tables have marble-tops and has plastic chairs to go along with it. People here mostly drop by knowing what they have to order so the taking order part to delivering the food part is usually quick. Loved the Masala Dosa here and the Sambhar served with it. The Filter Coffee was also quite nice.

The waiters are courteous and humble and usually gives you no chance to dish out a complain. Pocket pinch is acceptable. Recommended to all who would like to taste a South Indian bite!

One of my favourite breakfast places! They serve certain simple south indian food and that's what attracts me till date :) located in one of the bylanes of southern avenue, looks like an old shabby building from outside. The interiors are simple and my favourites here are the upma,idli,vada and plain dosa with some awesome filter coffee. Take away is a pain cus the que is too long always!

When it comes to South Indian food my idli and dosa need to be bang on. By bang on I'd say -- Idlis need to be soft enough and dosas need to be crisp enough. For all those who crave the above mentioned can pay innumerable visits to Ramakrishna Lunch Home. There is quite a possibility that you might have difficulties locating this joint, but I guess a little asking around people in and around Deshapriya Park will lead you there. Do not expect an extravagant ambience because it literally resembles an old Zamindar bangaali baari from outside. Once you've stepped in it fulfills your needs for air conditioning and cleanliness. Other than the extra aspects I'd say I have been overwhelmed by every meal I have had here. From the softest idlis that melt in your mouth to a bitter coffee 'glass', everything goes with my definition of 'perfect'. As a frequent visitor to this place I'd suggest that one MUST NOT MISS OUT ON THE IDLIS. As for the prices, they did not slit my pockets.¬†
P.S. - Apologies for bad imagery. Quick photographing from cell phone cameras result in this. I'll carry a ¬†DSLR next time. :D

Another South Indian food joint in the Lake Market area which I've been frequenting since  the 80s. But of late had stopped going there. So when I got a chance to visit again I grabbed the opportunity. But I must say that I was slightly disappointed. They've converted the place into an AC environment( which was a blessing in this heat.) Some marble topped tables are there(ah nostalgia) but there is a lot of plastic as well( big no no ). The waiters dressed in crisp white(plus plus) but the cleaning boys weren't in any sort of uniform!! Coming to the food...the sada dosa ( too good)reminded me of the by gone days. The Idli too was fluffy and extremely soft.(great). But the real disappointment were the coconut chutney(bland and watery)  and the sambaar( didn't like it at all). The dosa and Idli experience was spoiled by the substandard chutney and sambaar. (If only they had maintained the earlier standards). The filter coffee served in the steel glass and katori was OK,( not as strong as I like it). With the passage of time they have compromised on the quality( which is sad). Still a good enough and pocket friendly place to go to for South Indian delicacies like dosas,idlus,vadas and uttapams. ( they do not serve meals,again this makes me sad).

Nondescript place, very likely to be missed. But it is a hidden gem. A frill-free restaurant serving authentic south Indian Tiffin, dosai, idli vada, uthappam accompanied by super tasty chutney and Sambhar.. flavorful, crisp, soft as required and as prescribed. Being an area which boasts of a sizable population of people from southern part of India, this place maintains a classical southern ambience.

The unassuming and most amazing south Indian restaurant in this part of Kolkata. The food is authentic Tamil Iyer style. The idlis, wadas come steaming hot in your plate, add a dollop of white butter and relish it with the unlimited chutney, podi and sambhar. The dosas are great too. It's a great place for a weekend breakfast. And the best part,  the food is so pocket friendly! 
The place is a little difficult to find, it's actually a home converted to a restaurant. Also they are shut once a week and in afternoons. So do check the timings in advance to avoid disappointment. 
I have moved from Kolkata but I would surely try to squeeze in a visit when I am in the city next.

Our go to place for South Indian food. The sambar and chutney are superb. Even the masala in the masala dosa is exquisite. Another plus is that the kitchen staff has stayed the same since the last 15 or so years so we get a near consistent taste throughout.¬†
However one complaint that we have is that the idlis sometimes - not always - are under-cooked which leads to a bit of a turn off from the overall food experience.

Ordered a plate of idli and Wada can't complain about it , it was pretty good and soft . The sambhar was a let down , didn't exactly give the taste of sambhar. I would recommend going for the special chutney over the regular one , it is far better and the coffee to accompany your meal.

Kolkata is a city of early risers and morning walkers. None of which is considered complete without an immediate sumptuous indulgence of breakfast calories as soon as a few have been burnt. So we head to Ramakrishna Lunch home in Bhupendra mansion. This joint is extremely popular and more so on the weekends; not only because of its close proximity to the Lakes but also for the quality of the food served. Be prepared for long queues; but the wait is totally worth it! If you think this has got you worried and you would rather pack your order for take-away, the queue inside can be even longer as they pack humongous orders to serve large families breakfast daily. Tip: carry your own containers for the sambar and chutney.

Now the restaurant consisting of three halls is fully air conditioned so no worries about sweating while over eating here ;-P ¬†Basic marble top table and plastic/wooden chairs ensure a no fuss environment that resonates with the simple charm of service and menu of this place. With limited options on the menu to try, the chefs ensure maximum quality for each dish.¬†

A must try is their idli - warm, soft, moist - no where have I eaten idlis that have come near to these in flavour or texture. Their vadas are crispy and not too spicy. The dosas (plain or maslaas served on the side) and crispy. The meal is accompanied with unlimited refills of their sambar and coconut chutney. If you find the chutney too liquidy, you can ask for their speacial chutney which is thicker and topped with dal (personally i prefer the thinner one). They also serve a smabar that has been prepared without onion or garlic is someone is particular about the same. You must end the meal with some filter coffee.¬†

The staff is very active, super busy and pleasant so make sure to tip them for their efforts!

They have strict service timings, so make sure you call before you head here.

Being near to my residence I am a frequent visitor to this place, specifically in the Saturday/Sunday evening.

They don't serve meals - hence you need to make your order either from Idly / Dosas / Vada / Utthapam...

Vada here is always fresh & hot...very crispy as well. 

Onion Utthapam, one of my most savoured South Indian preparations is a safe try here, however their Utthapam is not the best one I had ...out of the other South Indian joints I have tried so far.

Filter coffee would give you the true flavour of 'nostalgic South'...

Price point vis-a-vis quantity / quality is acceptable. 

Inside the eatery, Hygiene is maintained...still scope of improvement is always there...

Stewards are well behaved & attentive.

On Sundays & Holidays - be extra patient if planning a dinner here- at least 20-30 minutes waiting time might make you restless & inquisitive to know "what's happening inside ???" There are no waiting Hall or place to seat while you are in the queue...

I have been visiting this place since my childhood. The ambience of this place itself was never outstanding nor has it gotten a big overhaul but it gives you the feeling of a small cafe from a time long ago. The smell of the chutney, sambhar and filter coffee greets you as you open the door and find yourself a seating space. A waiter comes in soon with a notepad and takes your order. They will give you a menu if you ask for one but a look around and you'll see that most people already know what they're having and some don't even need to order being staunch regulars at the place.

The charm of this place lies in it being mostly undiscovered despite being an open secret. Also inspite of having a loyal following it has remained largely unchanged.

The white soft idlis with steam coming out of them greet your plate and you take a split second decisiin to stop your hand from reaching out and use a spoon to scoop out a piece and dip it in the piping hot sambhar in those small katoris which barely fit your spoon. Hungry, you do not waste time and put the idli dipped in sambhar in your mouth and almost scream as the combination is scalding hot but a scant second later realise that it has melted away and another spoon is waiting outside your mouth , as if asking permission to enter. The idlis disappears in moments and you reach out to the crispy delectable vadas which should now be edibly cold. One crunching swoop of the spoon to take out a bite lets out some pent up steam and you reconsider putting it in your mouth. A dip in the chutney later as it enters your mouth the crunchy exterior with a few bites gives way to the taste of the chutney and the goodness of coconut mixing with the dal of the vada lends a wonderful combination of tastes.

This can be the description of any of your favorite south Indian joints but for me it remains this small place which is the benchmark for all similar places.

If you're a first timer and are looking for a can't go wrong menu I've listed mine below.
Start with a idli vada plate (1+1) and a special chutney
Ask for repeats
Order a ghee masala dosa/onion uttapam or both
End it with a filter coffee

Food had order idlii and onion dosa idlii was very authentic in taste & nariyal chutney was quite OK and sambar was very ordinary ,I have visited south India there is much better idlii dosa chutney and sambar .
Scope of quality can be improved.

One of the best south Indian restaurant in the city, in terms of quality of food. The service is excellent. Parking is a concern at busy hours and weekends. However filter coffee is the best to try out with south Indian food instead of soft drink.

I have been visiting this place since my childhood. The ambience of this place itself was never outstanding nor has it gotten a big overhaul but it gives you the feeling of a small cafe from a time long ago. The smell of the chutney, sambhar and filter coffee greets you as you open the door and find yourself a seating space. A waiter comes in soon with a notepad and takes your order. They will give you a menu if you ask for one but a look around and you'll see that most people already know what they're having and some don't even need to order being staunch regulars at the place.

The charm of this place lies in it being mostly undiscovered despite being an open secret. Also inspite of having a loyal following it has remained largely unchanged.

The white soft idlis with steam coming out of them greet your plate and you take a split second decisiin to stop your hand from reaching out and use a spoon to scoop out a piece and dip it in the piping hot sambhar in those small katoris which barely fit your spoon. Hungry, you do not waste time and put the idli dipped in sambhar in your mouth and almost scream as the combination is scalding hot but a scant second later realise that it has melted away and another spoon is waiting outside your mouth , as if asking permission to enter. The idlis disappears in moments and you reach out to the crispy delectable vadas which should now be edibly cold. One crunching swoop of the spoon to take out a bite lets out some pent up steam and you reconsider putting it in your mouth. A dip in the chutney later as it enters your mouth the crunchy exterior with a few bites gives way to the taste of the chutney and the goodness of coconut mixing with the dal of the vada lends a wonderful combination of tastes.

This can be the description of any of your favorite south Indian joints but for me it remains this small place which is the benchmark for all similar places.

If you're a first timer and are looking for a can't go wrong menu I've listed mine below.
Start with a idli vada plate (1+1) and a special chutney
Ask for repeats
Order a ghee masala dosa/onion uttapam or both
End it with a filter coffee

Ambience - a very ordinary looking place without any decoration
Food had order idlii and onion dosa idlii was very authentic in taste & nariyal chutney was quite OK and sambar was very ordinary ,I have visited south India there is much better idlii dosa chutney and sambar .
Scope of quality can be improved.

One of the best south Indian restaurant in the city, in terms of quality of food. The service is excellent. Parking is a concern at busy hours and weekends. However filter coffee is the best to try out with south Indian food instead of soft drink.

Between Jyoti Vihar and Bhupendra Mansion, we decided to try out the latter for a change. My second visit after more than 10 years, but my experience made sure that I select Jyoti Vihar next time.

The Good :-
========
1. Medu Vada.
2. Soft Idlies.
3. The service.

The Bad :-
=======
1. The Chutney
2. The Sambhar
3. The Upma. (I have never tasted such a terrible upma.)
4. The furniture on which we were made to sit.

The Worst :-¬†
========
The sky-high prices. I don't mind paying money but sorry to say what I ate in the morning was simply not worth it. I had an average coffee worth Rs. 35/-. I am sorry to say I have had better for Rs. 20/-.

Overall:
======
Food - 4/10 (because of the poor chutney, sambhar and upma)
Ambience - 6/10
Service - 8/10
Value for Money - 2/10
Would I recommend to someone : NO

Very neat and clean. Typical south Indian menu. Order a plain dosa with a side of vada. Accompanying sambar was piping hot and chilled coconut chutney, it was quite filling. Being as old as this establishment is, it has been maintained quite nicely. @Tanuj NoodleGuy Ravichandran

According Its the best south Indian Resturant in kolkata We have the idly and the medu vada every Saturday morning. Its been so many years that the Saturday morning breakfast is here only. If we cannot go we make sure it is brought home in Tiffin. Great to see the maintenance of same quality for so many years. Superb service and great mouth watering food. The sambhar here takes the award.  I really miss my idly on Saturday morning if i am travelling.  Also the jyoti vihar belonging to the same owner the food is awesome.

I visited this place on a Sunday morning...we weren't surprised to see it full considering its popularity...coming to the ambiance of the place...i find it absurd when people complain about the ambiance of such places...i have visited a number of south Indian joints in south India and almost all of them (specially lunch houses) have the same kind of feel..coming to the quality of the food..hugely disappointed..nothing exceptional, infact below average it was...the idlis were soft..super soft, without a doubt...but the sambar was terrible...literally "terrible" is the word...the chutney wasnt great either..was very happy to see "malkapuri" on the menu though...it was awesome..!!! Coming to the butter masala dosa...well, the dosa wasnt crispy..thicker than needed...the butter on it was put on one corner of the dosa, so it didnt work for me!
The service was pretty impressive, the waiters were very prompt and the food served was hot! The prices were on the higher side for the quality they serve!
Overall, dont go if your expectations are high, drop in if you are really hungry and near that place!

Had visited this place at 10 am Sunday morning and there was a 30 minutes waiting. I was on a short visit to Kolkata, my friend from Kolkata had build high hopes about this place. All that I was expecting is 'Ramashray' in Kolkata. I was soon proved wrong when I had the first bite of that idli sambar. It was just another wannabe authentic south indian restaurant. I wanted those 30 minutes back which I had spent waiting for a seat here.

Gone are the days veg food was only associated with a man serving sambhar in a bucket ......kolkata has expanded with its reach for veg foods.... From conti to even South Indian... And even South Indian has non veg options like aminia and it's sad to see you not invest in the interiors and the overall experience at this joint ... Your food is the good and yet no one will choose you as a family outing ...

Idlis best in kolkata

Vadas very good

Onion Uttapam v good

Mixed uttampam ok

Paper dosa also v good

I went there at 9.30 am. Greatly disappointed by the interiors. Coming to the Food,ordered Butter Paper Masala Dosa , Sada Paper Dosa and a plate of Idli. Idli was good. Real soft and served with tasty sambhar and Chutney. Dosa was a huge disappointment. Dosa on the other hand was some what next to horrible. No Cheese variants available. Dosa had a dullop of butter on one corner and it was not even butter. Some cheap cream. Tasted like a burnt one. 2.5 For the Idly. 0 for Dosa and Ambience. Also overpriced,keeping in mind the interiors and food and everything else.

Not worth. The vada, though it is crispy, but it is not having any taste like before it used to be. Idly is good but the sambar is not upto the mark. The sambar taste  does not match any level. Moreover the price is on higher side. They know how to fool people. Just try the special chutney. It is thick. But they charge u xtra. No other south indian restaurants charge you for chutneys. The person sitting in the counter is very very rude. Udipi house opposite to this hotel is much better restaurant than this one.

This place came into my notice on a Saturday evening when around 30 people were waiting outside for their turn. I visited to check whether it is really worth it to stand for an hour to fill your belly. The food was finger licking good but not very exceptional. Almost same as that of prema vilas or banana leaf, but what makes it difference is the ambience. Pure south Indian style serving with waiters in white dhoti kurta and a piece of cloth on their shoulder. The other reason is the name itself. Must visit with family. Try not to visit on weekends.

Ramakrishna Lunch Home was somewhat difficult to find on a rainy evening. But made it a point to visit this place this evening itself .. no matter what, as I had promised my mom and wife to have dinner there. Well it was worth the toil. On Sarat Bose road, near to the R.B. Ave junction, look out for Canara Bank. in the adjacent alley, look out for the second building called 'Bhupendra Mansion', Ramakrishna Lunch home sits at the ground floor of this mansion. While I thought Banana Leaf was serving some great South Indian cuisine (and well I still do) , Ramakrishna is more authentic to say the least... the chutney and sambhar are just very tasty.. We tried the special oothappam, Butter masala dosa , their famed idly and sambhar vada. Well, the idly and the vada are to die for. The server suggested to dip the sambhar vada in sambhar, and he literally drowned it in the main sambhar bucket for 2/3 mins before serving it.. the taste was just amaziiingg !! The idlies are buttery smooth - the best idly I had had... the dosa potato masala and the batter is just perfect. Oothappam is perfection implemented.. all in all so far it has touched me to the core... BUT, well this had to be reviewed unfortunately.. the hygienic sense of the servers has to be improved.. also the restrooms are in dire straits... It is a sure turn off ... Would make sure to finish the restroom rituals before stepping in to this great South Indian restaurant...
So overall -¬†

Food 5/5
0.5 deduction for hygiene
0.5 deduction for service

Well, this place serves the bestest idly, vada in the world! The standard has been the same for the last 20 years or more. The food is always prepared fresh as per order. As a result, not a chance of getting a semi warm idly or a soggy vada. It's as fresh as it can get. My home visits are never complete without a trip to this iconic place. Some might find the price to be a bit high. As far as I am concerned, I am more than willing to shell out a bit extra for such heavenly food!

We went to this South Indian joint on 21st June 2015. If you go early i.e by 7.30 am you need not wait in the queue. But post¬†8 am there is minimum¬†around 15-30 minute waiting time which one should take into consideration while visiting this place. It is a small place with very basic d√©cor but food is simply awesome. We loved the soft piping hot idlis served with equally hot sambar.The baras were very crisp and hot. We also ordered for butter paper roast dosa and Ghee Masala Dosa. Paper roasts are for those who want a very crisp texture of the outer cover of the dosa otherwise one can order masala dosa. The filling of the dosa is mildly spicy made of potato. We ended the breakfast with filter coffee. It was a nice Sunday morning feast , a much welcome break for all of us from luchi and torkari ! :) The place is quite reasonable as well. Four of us could fill our tummy in around Rs.450 bucks.

I came here thinking at last this will be introduction to give a 5/5 in Kolkata.
From the 1960's lake road,lake market and the surrounding half a km area ¬†had been populated by a large population of Tamilians,mostly working as trusted accountants and secretaries in the then booming Calcutta corporate world.So to cater to this populace,locally and nationally known as madrassis,a whole microsystem of stores came up selling everything from flowers,spices,magazines and food which has been even chronicled by Satyajit Roy,then a resident of this area in one of his 'feluda' novels.Best amongst these was Ramakrishna Lunch Home along with Prema Vilas a little away.
They opened early and while studying for joint entrance many a times I have had a hearty breakfast here at 6 30 am.The look was always 'stark' but clean and the service was no nonsense,terms strictly cash.
They became hugely popular in the late 90's with the changing demography and sadly modernised their looks with plastic chairs etc.
As one knows the idli will be an idli,what differentiates one idli from the other,freshness kept aside is the Sambar and the chutney.I can say with authority,having tasted the above everywhere from MTR Bangalore to Nampally,Andhra Pradesh and Egmore in Chennai,that Ramakrishna lunch home had the best Sambar in India.
Hence what I tasted today seemed a pale,watery version of the fiery concoction I expected and the idly,medu vada and masala vada as well as the sada dosa nothing extraordinary.Another huge let down compared to the taste stored in memory and disappointment at a great eatery becoming just a place serving 'South Indian food'.Sad.

Went here after a early morning walk at Victoria, we were lucky to get a table empty. Simple south Indian menu. Authentic south Indian food . service was good. But by the time we were having food, people were standing beside wait ing for the table, that makes one little uncomfortable when having food. The place had really got crowded with their fans. Worth visiting if you like south Indian food.

Legendary South Indian Veg Food in South Kolkata. Nothing great about this place other then the idli, dosa, vada etc. Zero on ambience and decor.

Whenever there is a craving for South Indian food I end up going to Ram Krishna Lunch home. The idli and the vada here are to die for.. The idli melts in ur mouth,it's so fresh. The masala dosa is also very good. It's not a fancy restaurant, it's a simple restaurant which serves quality food. The menu is simple and traditional.. Didn't like the butter masala dosa as according to me the butter had the flavour of coconut in it.

This place is very difficult to find when you are going for the first time. It is a old building with a board but no fancy light and stuff. But just go inside and you will find a very busy restaurant. It is a simple place with a simple menu. 
Do not miss the idli and vada. That's the best part. They'll serve it hot and fresh. The uttapam is also very good. The waiters are good. This is a simple place for a light south Indian meal.

Just like any other famous eatery in calcutta, this one has poor infrastructure and limited seating.
On good side, it is considered one of the best South restro in city. Great Idlis, Dal Vadas and Sambar.
The USP was light and crispy dosas, one of the best I have eaten after long time.
Also tea/coffee at end will be perfect dine out.
Price is no longer dirt cheap but still offers value for money.

Unpretentious, authentic and delicious are the three words that I feel best describe this place. ¬†Time seems to have pretty much stopped still in the 50s or 60s inside this fastidiously clean place, and the food - we had the paper masala dosa &onion utthapam - is remarkably crisp, non-greasy/oily and tasty. The filter coffe is just as delicious. ¬†Certainly one of Calcutta's best South Indian places, and much better than some over-hyped ones.

South Indian Food is popular in Lake Road/ Rashbehari Avenue/ Gariahat Road area. Long queues are there sometimes for weekend breakfast or at Lunch or Dinner time at such outlets. Quite a few outlets have come up in this area recently. Among the earlier ones in this area are Hotel Homely Raj at Manoharpukur Road Banana Leaf on Rashbehari Avenue Udipi Home near Deshapriya Park South India Club on Hindusthan Park etc. For a quick bite of good food in a reasonably clean environment at ok cost Ramakrishna Lunch Home at Lake Road is a recommended place.
The place was given a facelift recently. Visited this place three times recently at tiffin time in the afternoon and had their snacks - Dosa Idli Vada Sambar and filter coffee. The rates are very reasonable. Service is quick in lean periods such as in the late afternoon/ early evening times. Food was very fresh served hot and tasty. Average cost for one person for a filling breakfast/ tiffin is around Rs 100/- only.
I would rate it at Zomato Average Rating at 3.8. They have 0.5 increments in Rating options - so I have rated them at 4.0
BY THE WAY ZOMATO MAY CORRECT THE NAME OF THIS PLACE IN THEIR SITE. THE CORRECT NAME IS 'RAMAKRISHNA LUNCH HOME'.

This one afternoon my dad took me for lunch here when I accompanied him to Southern Avenue. WE used to live there earlier ad my dad knows every nook and cranny of the place. We had ordered Masala Dosa and later Sambhar Vada and I fell in love with authentic South Indian awesomeness. I get a certain good vibe in the place. It is not a hotshot fine dining restaurant but it is truly awesome. This other time my cousin brought food from there when he went to play a cricket match at C4 and this time also the food was simply amazing. I totally recommend this place. But do not expect sophisticated luxury. Do expect good hospitality.

Location: Lake road 

Also known as Bhupendra Mansion (since, this place is located on the ground floor of the building named Bhupendra Mansion). 
This south Indian joint is also one amongst my childhood memories... Have been frequenting to this place on alternate weekends for takeaways.

Haven't got a chance to sit out here and dine.. 
But, has been recently renovated into an air-conditioned eatery from the old plastered place. The takeaways are quickly packed and are made sure that they are hot for a decent time span (say, twenty minutes).

- The dosas out here, may it be masala, plain or butter; are simply amazing. 
- The idlis are soft and simply melt in the mouth.
- The vadas, may it be masala or plain are crisp, but oily. :-( 
- The chutney earlier, used to be pretty low on salt, but, now the salt levels are maintained at a certain level which isn't too high for people who have a preference of low salt levels. :)
- The Sambhar used to be really delicious, but of late has slightly turned sweet in taste.

The staff out here is prompt and efficient enough in their work. 
Quick packing of take aways as well as quick catering to orders from the tables (could see the catering while I waited for my takeaway). Perfecto! 

Overall a good place for fooding, but now slightly losing the charm.
South Indian lovers must not miss out on this! Worth a try. :)

Ramakrishna mission is the typical south Indian food joint. No frills and quality food. Jyoti vihar and R.K. mission share the same management and it shows. The idlis are quick and delightful, vadas have a melt in your mouth feel and th onion and green chillies uttapam is absolutely gorgeous. It's probably th only place where I need a sambar refill. The decor is nothing to talk about and they don't even provide basics like tissue papers. But if you are ready to overlook it all for some delicious south Indian fare then u jus may have discovered one of your favourite breakfast places in Calcutta.
Ps: the coffee's brilliant but if you don't like your coffee overtly sweet then ask for th sugar separately or else it 'll be a highly unpleasant experience as its super sweet :)

It is needless to say that it is one of the oldest restaurants In calcutta. I have heard a lot that it is a branch of jyoti vihar and when I ate the food there, I could feel the same soft idlies. The food is delicious.. In fact that'd be an understatement. 
I personally do not like idlies but when I had it there, I simply loved it. 
The dosa was such that when u put it in your mouth, it instantly melts.
I was full but even then I couldnt resist myself from having one more vada! Hah so is the food! So hungry and busy eating and I Infact forgot clicking pictures! :P

Also, it is very clean and is not conjusted unlike jyoti vihar. Planning to have south indian? Go here or jyoti vihar.

Yesterday i was taken there by my partner. I always love to taste their sambar..it is such a great mood lifter for me. this time too, it was no exception. Over our previous visits we have had dosas. They are good. This time we had masala vada and onion masala oothappam. Both tasted good. But the sambar here is amazing. Taste..texture.. consistency .. nothing to complain and the best sambar for me in Kolkata. We are yet to try the idly and some other dishes, but this is a good eating place altogether, decent staff, pocket friendly. Worth a visit, multiple ones for me ;)

One of the best south Indian restaurants in Kolkata, a very small place and there is hardly any decor, just chairs and tables, but the food is very delicious. 
The food, be it idlis, vadas, dosas or uttapam, everything is served hot and fresh.
The special chutney is awesome.
Takeaway available. 
There's generally a bevy of cars outside the place and is crowded during the breakfast hours on weekends. 

I'll keep visiting for the superb south Indian taste.:)

No frills no ostentation. A super clean place with almost no decorations. Once seated you can make out its flocked by regulars. Visiting all the South Indian eateries in that area for the  last 25 years or more . Wonder how come I missed this place . Regret it thoroughly.
Now the food..Had breakfast. The idlis soft and succulent. The sambar excellent. Vadas  awesome. The ghee masala dosa was not that good.I should have ordered a crispy one..But the masala filling was great.. The potato was mashed finely , no lumps.The masala was perfect. And the cafi .The best degree coffee I ever had. The service .....very prompt. The boy understands what exactly you want and presents it in a jiffy. Thank you dear. Forgot to ask your name .Sorry Banana Leaf you lost a regular.The best part is the bill. Rs 60 for the dosa,Rs 24 for each idli or vada and coffee Rs30. All in all a not to be missed place.

This place is legend for all lovers of South Indian Food and I know some friends who swear by it so much that they crib if we suggest a visit to any other South Indian Joint. There is no taking away from the fact that they serve up superb fluffy Idli's among the best the city has to offer. The Coconut Chutney and Sambar are good but I still prefer Jyoti Vihar Sambar. The Dosa's are good with the Paper Masala Dosa being my favorite. If you feel like a change the Masala Vada is not bad either as is the Onion Uttapam.



----- 12 Mar, 2014 -----

One of the best places for South Indian Food in Kolkata .... the Idli's are soft and melt in your mouth .... the veda's crunchy and tasty and the Plain and Masala Dosa are both very good , as is the sambar and chutney .... the place is humble and the menu basic but all the regulars swear by it and keep going back for more !

R.K. lunch Home- How could i not review this? This place attracts a large amount of crowd in southern avenue and not much people are aware of this place. Previously, like 2 years back and during my father's time, it was totally the same with no difference.  The south indian people in their usual casual lungi serve you with the best of South Indian dishes. It has a very calm environment where you can relax, grab a bite, fill your stomach and then move on.

 Early in the morning, this place remains much crowded because the morning walkers like to have something light so they drop here in. However, recently, when my brother packed the food from here, he said the whole system has been changed and even the ambience. I was pretty amazed to get this change after so long. 

This is a must place to visit for those who love south indian. Probably, one of the best i have ever had. They also serve you with beverages like slice. In short, this place feels like home. 
------------------------------------
Food: 

This place serves you with the best chutney. The sambhar out here is also my favorite. I have tried the following items out here: 

1) Masala Dosa - The dosa was perfect! The masala's were made to pinch the tastebuds as per the requirement. 
2) Onion Uttapam - The uttapam tasted nice. With the chutney, it tasted even better. I don't usually like chutney but here, its too good. 
3) Sambhar Vada  - This is my favorite out here. A must try to all of the people out here. 

This place does not have a very high fy ambience. However, this place is a plain and simple place probably serving the best south indian food at the cheapest price out in the City of Joy. 
------------------------------------
Service: 
I must talk about the service and hospitality issues seperately. The service out here is prompt. The staffs are very courteous, active and friendly. However, the menu out here is short, but they serve you the best quality in the lowest price. 
------------------------------------
Summary: 

Food quality 5/5
Food quantity 4.5/5
Hospitality 5/5
Food presentation 3/5 ( Usual same :|)
Costly affair? Not at all. Very very reasonable. 
------------------------------------
Pros:
1) Located at prime area.
2) Courteous staffs
3) Quality food at cheap price
4) Food quantity is good too.
5) Simple ambience.

Cons:
1) Limited menu
2) Ambience isn't very great. Some people may not like it. However, they had recently developed it. No idea as i haven't been personally there.
------------------------------------
Conclusion:
For those who love south indian and want fast service at a low price (Probably everybody wants :P) can give this lunch home a try.  :) Will come back again for sure.

A place that serves authentic south Indian food, with a decent set up of place offers light on stomach and mouth watering south Indian delicacies. Masala wada - a pulse (chana dal)  based wada with masala nd coriander leaves are to die for. Special chutney is thick, nd that is the specialty. Idli, medu wada and dosa is very good. Sambar was not up to the mark. Filter coffee won praises. Over all its a great breakfast place. Prices are a little high when compared to south Indian food.

This place would have got a 4 from me had it not changed its system of sitting on a low marble slab and  serving the food in banana leaves . The South Indian food here is still one of the best,but for me,the place lost out on its charm after the changes.
Every possible south indian dish on the menu card is authentic and possibly the best you could get,along with the strong coffee.
The staff is veryyyy fast with their hands and serve in a jiffy. Experience can be seen once u enter the place.
Easily of the leaders in this particular cuisine !

‚ÄúExcellent south Indian food at an authentic south Indian lunch home‚Äù

3.5 out of 5

Being a die-hard fan of South Indian cuisine, I have explored most of the South Indian food joints in Kolkata over the years, but Ramkrishna Mission Lunch Home at Sarat Bose Road, near Deshpriya Park has been an old haunt for many ‚Äì my tryst with it began over two decades back in school. Famous among early morning walkers, and more prominently, among young early morning college bunkers, RM Lunch home has been a regular favourite for many of us and continues to serve quality south Indian food at honest prices. 

Ramkrishna Mission Lunch home has been a basic eating house serving authentic South Indian food. The place is noticeably clean and hygienic. The interiors are simple with tables fitted with marble tops. While entering the building it does give you a feeling of being in a lunch home. With a calm and peaceful atmosphere this place has a homely feeling. They have polite and friendly staff with quick and courteous service.

They have a short and simple menu with fewer varieties of dosa when compared to other lavish restaurants. However, their butter masala dosa has a tantalizing aroma of being freshly baked and urges you to gorge on it without stopping. The crust was crispy and perfect. Their idlis are soft and fresh ‚Äì and if I may commit some culinary Calcutta South Indian blasphemy ‚Äì probably better than its cousin Jyoti Vihar on its day (yes, JV lovers - boo me now!). The medu vadas are crispy outside and soft inside. Their uttapams are also tasty and nice to eat though uttapam is not one of my favourite dishes to order. Their USP is their special chutney with the special tadka on top. It is a must try at Ramkrishna Mission Lunch House. They also serve excellent South Indian filter coffee to complete your meal.

To sum up ‚Äì Good food to pamper your taste buds at pocket friendly prices. You will leave this place with a happy stomach every time.

Though I am fan of regular South Indian fare of dosas,idlis and vadas, I never knew of this place till couple of days when another restaurant owner shared this. I must admit - one great help done.
I have tasted similar food in many other places in Kolkata but the quality of food along with a pinch of authenticity in service, decor makes it a worth while experience.
I was there for take-away and ordered Uthapam, Ghee Masala dosa, sada vadas and paper masala dosas and I must admit each tasted to perfection.

Best is surely the Ghee Masala Dosa. Service was prompt and in a Saturday evening, found the place to be nearly full.
This is placed just in the next lane of Marco Polo in Sarat Bose Road and in the non-descriptive building , this AC restaurant is placed. Its clean, well-spaced out and very peaceful ambience.

So if you are looking for nice South Indian food, then surely visit this place and you won't be disappointed.

We are talking about a very old and vintage restaurant located in the bhupendra mansion in the lane beside Marco Polo restaurant on Sarat Bose Road serving some very amazing south indian food since ages. It has been our favorite for breakfast since generations be it after a nice morning walk or while your college. They serve the chutneys and sambhars from their not so small steel vessel or buckets which gives me a very nice and authentic feel. They wont serve you idly after 9 a.m. which one should be careful about. The pricing is parallel to Anand, Jyoti Vihar. The place has been renovated a bit but i would prefer the older version. 

The food has been top notch since forever. The idly is always hot and fresh. I love their ghee butter masala dosa which i feel is their best dosa. Upma is really nice and my dad's favorite. South indian thalis are good.

Pros:
1) Peaceful
2) Amazing food quality
3) hot and fresh food, always
4) Upma and ghee butter masala dosa are must haves

Cons:
1) If you want a royal dining experience, definitely not a place for you
2) Has lost that authentic feel to some extent after the renovation
3) The problem with any south indian restaurant in kolkata is the lack of options in menu and the absence of classic murugan (chennai) experience.

Please follow me to read my other reviews.

I have been frequenting this place since the last 20 years and a big fan of the place. However I am saddened by the transformation and commercialization this place has seen over the last few years
This restaurant had been a basic eating house serving authentic South Indian food. The place was clean and had a simple look with single seated tables fitted with marble tops. While the items in the menu (not a lot of variety there) have remained the same , the prices have surmounted over the years particularly after the restaurant has been air-conditioned recently.
The single seater tables have been replaced with 4 seater proper restaurant tables to accommodate more people.
The good thing however is the quality of the food is still great and look as authentic as earlier. The use of all original and good  ingredients is very much evident from the taste and aroma of the food. Make sure to try their filter coffee after a sumptuous meal.

I discovered this place just one month back and after seeing the entrance and ambience...i was in a fix whether to order food or not. But the aroma of the fresh dosas , idlis, vadas was so good that i could not resist myself.
From that day onwards i have visited the place many times, and can confidently say that one of the best places in kolkata that serves south indian food.
Very affordable prices...waiters are friendly and service is quick.
Overall, nice place to have good south indian food

I was going through the review of the place where I grew up eating dosas and vadas and had my first hand experience of what south indian food means. I still remember the late night pandal hopping and breakfast at bhupendra. over time they air conditioned it and made it a lot cleaner but its still a bit shabby. but they make up for the food they serve. the dosas and vadas are too good. the idlis are pretty great. the filter coffee is a bit sweet but aren't all filter coffees so?? the best time to be there is early morning and am sure you won't be disappointed!

This restaurant has been done up slightly. It's certainly cleaner than it was, and the air-conditioning helps.

However, the food was a bit of a disappointment. The idlis and vadas are excellent, but the sambar, chutney and special chutney seemed bland. Moreover, the pricing seems odd - a single idli or vada costs 20/-, which seems to be too much. The filter coffee served was good, though. The fact that this is a "lunch home" but no meals are available on what clearly looks like a revised menu is also strange.

The service was prompt and the waiters friendly. Barring the prices, a good place to go to.

The place which houses the Ramakrishna Mission Lunch Home is the ancient Bhupendra Mansion (1948) located in a by lane of Sarat Bose Road. A must Visit if you're a true fan of authentic South Indian food. A good place for breakfast or a light snack in the early evening.

When you enter, the building does give you the feeling of being inside a lunch "home". Starting from simple decor, calm atmosphere, homely food and polite staff to a squeaky clean washroom (a rare sight nowadays), this place has all that is needed to make one feel good.

The menu is short and simple with much lesser varieties of dosas than that of other South Indian restaurants. Being here for the first time, I was quite unsure about the taste, so opted for a butter masala dosa. After a few minutes, the huge fermented crepe called dosa arrived in front of us. The tantalizing aroma of the golden brown, freshly baked dosa immediately made me break up a crispy thin portion and gorge on it. The crust was perfectly baked with just the right amount of flavour. 
Sadly, I was disappointed with the small dollop of butter on the lump of masala tucked into the dosa. My idea of a butter masala dosa was quite different from what I was served with. Another setback was the butter itself which had a strong odor of coconut oil (totally against my taste). I assume, they used some sort of homemade butter. Though the coconut and lentil chutney was really good, I somewhat found the sambhar to be a bit diluted.

Overall, this is a pretty decent place for a light meal at a low cost.
P.S: Avoid any kind of butter dosa if you're not fond of the stench of coconut oil.

I just happened to land up at this place and i can tell you that i got the aromo of dosa's freshly cooked being served on the table to a guest, thats the time i decided that i would also order a masala dosa and also taste the vedas, which i did, both the food items were very good and i could feel the freshness in the dosa and the vadas too. The coconut chutney and samba dal was also of a good standard too it was indeed moneys worth and i quiet enjoyed by south Indian meal.

I was schocked to see this place when I had my first visit-"Is this the much talked about Bhupendra Mansion..! Whats so great in this place?"

But now since Iv visited this place for a dozen of times now I can assertively say that this place is a perfect example of how good food can just outshine every possible aspect that we think of. At times-ambience,service , decor doesnt matter at all because its the Food that Rules..!
One of the best places to have simple South Indian in Calcutta..!
Located near Desapriya Park-this a a really popular eating joint when it comes to Breakfast and Lunch..!
Very Simple decor-just chairs and tables, all you can get is-An  assurance that good quality food will be served to you at every time of ur visit...!
Idlis are soft and fresh,Medu Wadas are crispy and the dosas are good and quite a filler.  
Thier Uttapams are average but you can still give it a try. 
The problem is they do not have too much option in thier Dosas.
Thier USP is thier special chutney with the special tadka on the top-a must try..!! 
Also go in for the hot filter cofee-the waiter serves that to you very well after giving the milk a perfect mix..!

Thier waiters are quick and prompt..no complaints..!
If you're hungry and really wanna have something good, you can visit this place without a thought.
But yes..you need to be careful of the timings:
In weedays its operational upto 10 am in the morning and after 3 pm in Noon, however at weekends they are operational upto 1 pm in the afternoon..!

To sum up- Good food and a happy stomach when Im at this place..!
Cheers..!

I would call this place another one of those overrated old snack houses which are ample in number in Kolkata. People mostly go there cuz it's an old house converted into a (mostly) breakfast joint and it's "cool" to be seen there on a Sunday morning. The dilapidated, filthy old building is supposed to be charming to some but to me it's hard to imagine sitting down and eating in a place so filthy. There are century old cobwebs and grime stuck to the walls. Service is blah at best. It's super crowded most times. The dosas are standard. The uttapam is blah. The upma is blah. The sambhar is blah. The only genuinely good things you get here are soft idlis and crispy vadas. I prefer takeaway any time. There are other places to go if you're south Indian food connoisseurs. They have changed their seating arrangement so it's a tad more bearable now. Blah.
