Its a nice place to dine or have some quick bites.They offer good south indian food nd various other veg items. We had eaten masala dosa...dosa was crisp nd warm, the sambar was pretty good. We were the only customers when we entered...this place has less crowd. The ambience was ok...but not great. The service was fair.

Very good place to get south Indian food. Dahi vada, sambhar vada, dosas are really good. There is a mention of this place in a Feluda novel.

It is located just behind Metro cinema in Esplanade. Went their and tried the onion and plain masala dosa...the quality and quantity is very good and the pricing is also reasonable. It is better than dosas of some more fancy outlets. Ambience is normal.

After a long & weary afternoon of shopping, we finally decided to grab a quick bite but were unable to find a decent restaurant. All of a sudden, my dad remembered this place and was quite eager to take a trip down memory lane. Trust me, the lip-smacking Special Butter Masala Dosa was to die for! The hot dal and luscious sambar left me craving for more! I couldn't make out why my mom's dosa was a bit cold although ours turned out to be perfectly fresh and hot. While the staff was wonderful, I also enjoyed the peaceful ambiance of the place. If you love South Indian dishes, this place is a must go!

'Unplanned' yet 'Organized' - Yes that's the folder name I gave when I collected all the photos of the day when I went to this restaurant back in 2013 with Jeet and Satish for the 1st time!!

I'll come to the review later. Took a DP inside the restaurant which then had the highest number of likes if compared to my  other Profile Pictures. Image courtesy goes to Jeet.

BTW that DP is also very special.

Coming to the food, I toh loved it. I still remember it was a rainy day. Chiranjeet showed me this hidden place in a Galli/goli that is both of Us's favorite, Metro Gali. A place for photographers!! He He.
We enjoyed the whole day with random photography. Also watched a pathetic movie but had fun!!

I loved it so much that even after some Dhosha & Utthapam, Me and Satish again ordered for another Utthapam!!! Rest was all the struggle to finish it.
Hujug e pore order diye diyechilam. Asole roj bhaat daal alu posto khai toh tai 'For a Change' South Indian food oshombhob tasty lege giyechilo!!!
Shedin bujhechilam Chennai Bangalore e job kore khawa Kotto kosto.

Anyways went there today as well and remembering Nostalgia. Loved the Dosha. Cheese masala Dhosha. Loved the Utthapam (Thank God didn't ordered one more 'Hujug e Pore') and the veg pakora was so so.
It's South Indian food is actually better then the one near CiTi Mart at Esplanade. (Which is pretty close to this one)

Will visit here again. As time passes by weather their food taste has degraded or not, I'll say it's still the similar if compared between 2013 & 2016.


* Postscript - It was a very special day today as it was #TheMothersDay along with #PonchisheBoishaakh and Eden Gardens e IPL e KKR er match o chilo plus a Sunday.
Thanks.

Used to visit here often when they served delicious Dhosas. However, with time, there quality has degraded substantially and they have literally spoiled their reputation. Decent looking place, with average ambiance, they happen to serve North Indian cuisine as well. Although, I never really tried the same here.

It was an indian fast food restaurant which serves south indian and north indian cuisine. This place was average looking but clean all the time. Not much crowded. Good place to dine in. Ambitious and hospitality was good. Service was nice and also staff were decent and mannered. I liked the most their south indian cuisine they were tasty and true south indian taste. North indian cuisine was also good and close touch. Their side dishes was not good enough. Price was affordable. Must try place. Not the best but still good enough to visit one more time.

This place is very special to me. I have been going here since I was a kid as my mom loves to eat here. The sambar is out if the world. Though it is not what it used to be but still very much better than many costlier restaurants. Mysore butter masala dosa is a must try. The waiters are very attentive. One thing they really have to improve though is the washroom. That place is worse than hell.

A good place to sit down for a casual meal. It's one of the rare places in Esplanade where you can get a place to sit without being in a queue. Food is decent.. I go here because of the decent crowd and place to sit and relax.

This South Indian restaurant used to be very good a couple of years back. Now, its food quality has degraded quite. Dosas are fine but the sambars and chatnis are not so very yummy, like it used to be. Vadas are also okay-okay types. Still, if one is hungry and wants to grab a South Indian bite, one can opt for the same on the 2nd floor in the lane beside Metro Cinemas.

This place is not what it used to be. I often visited here for yummy south indian delicacies from my childhood. 
-> Nowadays the foods simply lack the flavours and freshness. There was no trace of butter in my butter paper masala dosa. The dosa filling was also bad and felt like cheap samosa's filling. I even could not finish a single plate and left it half a way. Also the chutney and sambar was 'yuck' and sour. 
-> Pricing wise its at par with other south indian joints. AVOID THIS PLACE TILL THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION.. better still walk a few steps to Anand or Sitala tiffin house.

The food here is quite decent, but the dish that I really enjoy is 'Veg Hydrabadi Pulao with Raita and Papad', where the raita is really good(actually great) and the service is not bad at all, though the foods are served after a while from the moment of ordering which for some people may be a bit of a negative mark, otherwise its a good place to dine in for vegan people.

This place is located in the famous Metro galli. People who have been to this place for footpath shopping should face no difficulty in locating this joint. It is adjacent to another famous non-veg joint named "Anarkali".The restaurant is located in the first floor and there are adequate signs/billboards to show you the way.The ambiance and decor is spartan and minimal and the place is pretty clean too. It is a pure veg joint serving the staple north and south Indian dishes.Though it is more well-known for the south Indian fare especially the dosas.They also serve thalis which are very filling and economical.I tried out the North Indian thali and it was decent though nothing extraordinary.The thali comprises of rice,chapati, dal , two subzis,curd,pickle and salad.All this at Rs 70 !!! What more can one ask for!!!Ideal place to fill yourself up if one is in the vicinity and in the mood to have simple,homely vegetarian fare.I intend to sample the dosa and the much famed Madrasi filter "caapi" (coffee) in my next visit. Cheers!!

Their special dosas are excellent. They serve so many chutneys with them that the overall experience becomes richer.
Authentic south Indian dishes served, and with guests from down south availing the accommodation service that's on offer, leaves no doubt about the authenticity of everything, from dosas to filter coffees.
 
A must visit for foodies who like south Indian dishes.
The location is fantastic too.
Gets a 3.5/5
