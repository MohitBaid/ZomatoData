Right now, it is one of most over hyped place in the the city. Frankly speaking decor and location is all good along with the legendary name but the most important aspect of a restaurant is its food, which is not that great. I would rather say the food is not even average. In Kolkata one can get n number of better options for excellent kebabs and biryani. Kareem's is not worth a try. This is definitely not Delhi wala Kareem's...

The Murgh Malai kebab is must try in here. The ambience is good, as well as the food quality. Expect decency because this is a family restaurant and drinks are not available. Overall a slightly-budget restaurant for food lovers.

The newest addition to the Salt-lake Sector-5 restaurants- Kareem’s. The mocktails are bery soothing with the proper flavour of the fruit that has been used in the mocktails. Kareem’s is famous for its kebabs and biriyani. The veg and non veg starters are equally good. We ordered tandoori aloo and murg chapli kebab, and they taste heavenly. We also ordered garlic naan, gosht nihari and murg dum biriyani; and all of them are awesome in taste. The spices are perfectly cooked giving proper taste and aroma. The location of the restaurant is apt as it is the IT hub of Kolkata and crowd can be expected always. The ambience is perfect for a romantic as well as a family dinner, the service is good as well.

Recommended- Dum Biriyani(must have)
                            Murg Chapli Kebab

Took Kareem special kebab that ruin the mood of dinner..personally i didn't like this one..then kareem special biriyani was good..the best was malai firni..queen of the night..this place is famous for kebab..but not satisfied with rheir version of kebab..hopefully when i will go again, will get a better service of the kebab platter.

We went there on Christmas and luckily we got seats on that day.. anyway we had ordered:-
 Kareem special Afghan murgh tandoori -which was so juicy and so yum that I would recommend everyone to try.
Kareem special murgh dum biriyani and gosht biriyani- both biriyani's was good but it wasn't spicy which was lacking the most and though they were different biriyanis bt they taste quite same. 
Anyway staff member was kind and service was good.

One of my favs. Its typically north Indian restaurant. Food is awesome here specially mutton biryani. We order special Rann biryani which was more than sufficient 6 people. This is only place where I liked veg dishes also, apart from pure veg restaurants. Good ambience and good staff makes it a great place.

This restaurant is in sector 5 srijan park. Just beside the 10 downing street. Loved the ambiance and the decor. Ordered biriyani,soup,kebabs. Though price a bit high,food is of good taste and nicely served. They should improve the serving time,it's a bit slow. We had to wait quite a few time after we placed order.

On 5th January we ordered 8CP corporate lunch boxes to ecospace, trust me it had been a long time since we had such delicious Indian food. The assortment of the lunch box was perfect and very cheap Costing only 380. Initially we had to order this and we enquired about the deliverables but Kareem's associates were confused if they deliver or not. Finally they agreed on delivering it. The ala carte dishes are way to costly for office lunch, but we shall definitely try and recommend all to visit there and have their meals as we are mesmerised by the taste. All the items in the lunch box covered a full coarse lunch meal comprising of 2 tandoori rotis probably wheat made that was best part, daal fry loved that too, paneer masala a top notch one, chicken masala  this could have been better but it was boneless, 2 kebabs along with salad was the show stopper. We also had raita and firni accompanied in the lunch box and last but not the least chicken dum biryani..... So many things in n just ₹380. We got all the taste assorted in a box. The packaging was amazing customised for the corporate lunch box covered and delivered by their personal cab. We liked the hospitality too. I highly recommend to visit this place and experience the ambiance too along with the delicious food.

Nothing special cuisine.. Went yesterday with friend for some decent mughlai treat but their Kebab and Biryani was disappointing..Also the place was a bit too loud.. It wasn't that special as the Kareem's generally brings.. Staff behavior is courteous but somehow the quality of food hasn't been that stunning as the reputation goes..

This is one of the most royal places of Sector V which serves delicious Afghani dishes. The behaviour of the people are way too good. Everybody is so professional. My recommendation to all the Tandoori Lovers would be Kareem's special Murgh Afghani Tandoori. This is one of the unique Tandooris where the chicken is dipped in dahi. I even liked the mocktails Virgin Mojito and Green Apple Mojito.

There is a huge hue and cry about Kareem's opening its branch here in my city of joy. Okay, it's not the Kareem's from Delhi, but Mumbai. And it's only yesterday, that I visited this place... 

The service is good, nothing extraordinary and definitely not bad. We had Mutton Karachi, which is basically a variant of Kosha Mangsho, ith different spice combo. The meat pieces were extremely soft and had the perfect balance of flavors. Recommended. But, Mutton Biryani was slightly disappointing. Being from Mumbai gharana, I expected it to be more spicy, but it was s lightly spicy .... and off course the Aloo was there. Not sure, it was Kolkata Biryani or Mumbai Biryani. 

However, an okay-ish experience. The good part ? Portion sizes are pretty huge.

All items were avg. the whole thing was not, what we were expecting. After getting so much of good feedbacks, our expectations were very high. But the food was average. The extraordinary thing was not there. Service is very slow. They didn't even changed our starter plates when we were about to have main course. Some kind of mismanagement was there. I am not gonna visit it again.

This place was in my wishlist from many days... Atlast i went there with my friends for lunch this weekend
Ambience was ok with soft & boring music 😂
 
We ordered
1-Murgh platter which includes Murgh tikka, Murgh hai mirch tikka, Murgh malai kebab and Murgh Seekh kebab..
I don't find any extra ordinary taste in Murgh tikka or in hari mirch tikka
Seekh kebab was good
Malai kebab was brilliant.. you can find the taste of malai very well..

2- Murgh mussallam
Ok. I was trying to have it from many days in different mughlai restaurants but in many places we have to order it atleast 2 hrs prior. But here they took the order and we didn't have to wait for long.. and the best part was it was finger licking good.. bit of pulao was with it but We tried it with butter naan and cheese chilli naan.. let me mention this too.. CHEESE CHILLI NAAN is a bliss for cheese lovers and who loves spicy food

Beverages were fine

And the best thing was MALAI FIRNI
Perfect taste of malai in firni which was not too sweet. We liked it so much that we packed it for our house too

I highly recommend this restaurant and will visit again soon In'sha'Allah

First time tried tatkhan a little sweet based naan type thing and i liked it... it goes very well with daal makhani and paneer makhanwala. Mushrooms lover like me will love their mushroom tikka.. Tried orange mojito too... it was refreshing and very well go with hvy main course like biriyani.

One of the best place to have mughlai nd Indian food near saltlake sec 5. It's a place owned by one of my college friend Sayantan Saha. Really proud of his work. Ambience is top notch starting from the main entrance which is huge , the chandeliers, and the seating arrangement. Service is also prompt and cordial. Apart from the Kareem special biryani I liked all the dishes. Galauti kebab, chicken pankhudi kebab, lahori chicken, shahi chicken, ghost Karachi, cheese garlic nan, all were fantastic. Not to forget the mocktails- virgin mojito, green apple sparkle, Orange mojito, watermelon mojito. Dessert also looked good. I didn't try them , my friends did, malai firni and caramel custard. Cost wise very reasonably priced menu.Overall a definite place to visit again with Family and friends.

Wow..Was the word uttered from all of us at the table as we saw the Rann Biryani.
It is a dish which all should taste atleast for once. 
Their kebabs are the best among all the other kebab places in kolkata.
But their sides are a dissappointment- the butter chicken was too sweet.

Yesterday, on the first day of new year I had lunch with my friends in Kareem's. It's near RDB boulevard. 
Interior was really good and cozy . We ordered Murgh Musallam and Gosht Dum Biryani. It took sometimes for the preparation of the Musallam, but it's worthy of waiting. It was more than just delicious. But the Biryani was average (and one of my friends told me later that a piece of mutton had foul smell). Service was good. Would love to visit again.

This restaurant is located in 10 downing street opposite barbecue nation. The sitting area was cozy, spacious with soothing music in background.. Ordered murg malai tikka kebab, vetki tandoori and jhinga tandoori in starters... It took around 20 minutes to be delivered on table..but taste of those each starter was impeccable..in main course we had chicken dum biriyani, nihari gost and tandoori roti.. Nihari gost was irresistible, biriyani was above average

Had the last lunch of the year at  Kareem's . With elegant ambience this place  is located opposite to barbeque nation and right beside 10 Downing Street. Even on a day like 31st December their service was commendable as they didn't make us wait for the food for a long time . started with hari mirch chicken kabab which was way too good . in main course ordered tikka dum chicken biriyani which tasted very very different from the mainstream Kolkata type chicken biriyani because it was more masaledar and spicy yet  in no way less in taste when compared to Kolkata type chicken biriyani ; though the potato in the biriyani was not totally cooked .  in desserts we ordered malai phirni which was nice too. Kareem's was definitely worth the visit and looking forward to taste other varities of kababs and side dishes here .

Located at Sector 5, serves good Hyderabadi dishes. I visited this place twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. They serve better quality food for dinner compared to lunch. The Biryani might not be liked all. The Murgh Tangri Kulfi Kabab , Ghost Nihari and Karachi , and Raan Masala are few of the best they prepare.

Mouth watering and lip smacking Biriyani...wayyyyyyy different than typical Kolkata styled *Rose water scented white chicken rice"!! Loved it, 1 pint less because of the complementary Raita which was way too sweet, like dahivada chutney!

Great taste. Kareem's Special Raan Biryani is the show stopper dish...!! We had to wait almost an hour because the biryani was being prepared but when the dish reached us finally, it was absolutely worth the wait...!! It was a huge platter held by 2 persons, being brought to us...!! The dishes are a bit expensive but the Raan Biryani should be tried once...it is a wholesome experience...guaranteed!!

Ambience- 3/5- quite loud on weekends and busy days because of the crowd, otherwise the interiors are good 
Service- 4/5- service is more or less on time, and managers are attentive.
Food-4.5/5- food is not doubt the USP of the restaurant. The biriyani, different from the Kolkata style biriyani but still comes with potato, is pretty good. We have also tried the 30 piece non veg platter, which is very good for a big group. The prawns are especially good. The dal makhani is also good. The murgh Lahori was very good, and so was the Keema.

This is a place I had heard / read loads of positive reviews about. Then I was disappointed. I visited on a weekday with my entire team. Serving À la carte to 13 people turned out to be a difficult task for them. The quality of food went down. the mutton Galoti started smelling. The 3.5 review is just because of the phirni that stood out among all the other dishes

Went there with couple of my friends. Had murgh potli kebab, gosth nalli burra kebab and tandoori prawn as starter. The potli kebab was splendid. The other two starters were also good. Had gosth dum biryani which was simply awesome. Taste was super and there were three succulent piece of mutton in a single portion and which was ample for two persons. In deserts, malai firni was superb and saahi tukra was also good. Looking forward to visit again.

Just right blend of spices, mouth watering delicacy. Absolutely the place to be in to try Kebabs and Mutton dishes.The space inside the restaurant is quite open and gives a feeling of openness.

Disappointed at Kareem's : Mainly because we ordered Murg Dum Biriyani ~Kareem's Special but what we were served was Chicken Tikka Biriyani . When was asked the Waiter tried to convince us that the difference is this is just same biriyani with boneless chicken! Finally he admitted that chicken pieces of the dum biriyani are not available so they served with the chicken tikka pieces along with left over rice. The worst excuse one could give ! They could simply inform us about the unavailability so that we could order something else. Anyway the biriyani tasted awful. Kebab( Peshawari  Tikka) was just  good ,main course ( Lahori Chicken) nothing special. This was my third visit here and I really doubt if I ever want to come again.

This is the third time I visited this restaurant.. 
now in the starters the item which entirely stands out is the Murg Kulfi kabab..  it came wrapped in an aluminium foil... now being a cheese lover.. it was an absolute delight...  inside the foil there is a chicken tangri kabab that is wrapped and packed wid loads of liquids cheese..  apart from this we also had the tandoori chicken...  which was quiet okayish..
Their murg mussalam in the main course is a must try... very tasty.. but the quantity is way too much ..  so its better to order it when visiting in a group..  apart from that we tried the cheese garlic naan and butter chicken.. the butter chicken had a very creamy taste and consists of shredded pieces of chicken..

The ambience is lovely
Spacious enough for group of people
The pricing is bit on the higher side
Tried their Kareem special gosht biriyani
It was nice nothing special but ok
The staff tried being courteous but being puja time overloaded with amount of customer and already being late was a little confused 
But it's ok the crowd was excessive
But yes I would probably give it a try once more before the verdict being it the puja time

For quality & taste of food Kareem’s will get 5* for sure. All the dishes that we tried  were excellent, Murg Mussalman, Ghosht Karachi & Dal tadka. They made us wait for about 15 mins, which is also fine since restaurant can be busy. But service of food has to be better, one dish was served almost after we finished our meal.

This is another great addition to Sec 5 after Oudh.I went with my family and the staff was extremely courteous. They themselves noticed that my mom had a slight knee problem and arranged a table for 5 in the ground floor.To all other customers, they were politely asking to have a table in the first floor.They decor is very soothing - with paintings, designer furniture, lighting and soft indian music.We ordered a kebab platter- it was the best kebab platter I have had-the malai kebab was delicious with a generous amount of malai coating on the chicken pieces.The sheekh kebab was also very tasty.In the main course I loved the Dal Makhani and Gosht Nihari.They serve a surprising 8-10 pieces of chicken/mutton in the biriyani and they are soft and nicely cooked.The flavour of the biriyani is very different from the other Mughlai food chains.I liked it..my mom found it a little spicy.Chicken, mutton and paneer side dishes were excellent both quality and quantitywise.The phirni is midly sweet and the texture is smooth and creamy which makes it the perfect thing to end your meal with.The only thing that bugged me a little bit was everything was very rich and heavy, so you can't possibly enjoy it for long because you feel heavy very fast.Their dinnerware is also very unique and adds to the overall aesthetics of this place.This is a must visit place for every reason possible.🙂

Amazing food but horrible experience there.. I am a regular customer there and I visit almost twice/thrice a month.. Their service is pretty disappointing, it takes ages to deliver, you can not get water even after calling the waiter 5/6 times.. But all these FORGIVEN because the taste is good. But today when we visited there.. We had a team lunch worth Rs. 8700 and then I requested a Mutton Rang Biryani to pack for my family. It was around 3pm. By 6pm I reached home and when I opened the box I was SHOCKED! They packed someone's leftover food which was rotten by then. Rice was all messed rice (looked like dusted by hand), broken potatoes and all the mutton pieces was half bitten, partly chewed and mostly leftover bones!! It was smelling like hell.. I was in fury and when I called them back they said it's the first time they're receiving such complaints and they're very sorry. That's it. END OF STORY. No compensation and no sorrow on the manager's voice!! Unbelievable. Never going to visit again!

Service was good every time. They can take care your problem regarding food and table.

Food was delicious. Kareem's biriyani was Awasome. Chicken and mutton both. I tested Murg Akbari there with rumali roti and tandoori roti. Both are 5 star. I tested 2types of kabab there kalimiri kabab and malai kabab. Just Awesome to have. 

Overall I suggest please visit Kareem's if you want to test a delicious dishes.

This was my 2nd visit to Kareem's and both the times the experience was nothing short of absolutely delicious.

The decor is nice and the staff courteous. They have two floors and the service on the upper floor is a bit slow. 

The choice of non-veg soups is limited to Murgh Yakhni Shorba and Paya Shorba. We had ordered both but we liked the latter more. For starters we had  ordered Chapli Kabab and Murgh Platter. The Murgh Platter contained 3 different types of Kababs and all tasted good. Our main course consisted of Taftan and Garlic Naan with Bheja Fry, and Gosht Keema Biriyani and Gosht Dum Biriyani. Taftan was soft and tasted  somewhat like Shirmal - it would go really nicely with any spicy dish. Bheja Fry was kinda okay. Both the Biriyanis were nice but Keema Biriyani was just perfect.
We ended the dinner with Mango Delight and Caramel Custard and I ended up loving Caramel Custard.

Much awaited visit to this restaurant happens. Just a fortnight back I was there at Kareem's. The food was good but not that great to be honest. I expected a lot better from them. We took Tandoori Murgh and Galouti Kebabs for starters. They were decent. Murgh lababdar and garlic naan was also okayish. Only food I found amazing is the Shahi Tukda. Awesome and must try for all. 

Special mention about the service and the staff. They were too homely and couteous. I am very happy with their service.

Located just beside 10 Downing Street, a little ahead of RDB it is relatively easy to spot. We, however, had ordered for a home delivery to our workplace nearby. The delivery was prompt by normal standards. We had ordered Murgh platter as the starter and thereafter Mutton Keema Biryani and Murgh Dum Biryani alongside Murgh Korma, Shahi Murgh and assorted breads of Butter, Garlic Naan and Tandoori Roti. The platter was really good, just wished for more Mutton Boti kebab peices in the overall proportion. In the main course, the Mutton Biryani was a disappointment, Chicken Biryani was good, so was the Korma. Among the breads the Tandoori Roti was overdone and had become distinctly hard by the time we had it, the butter and the garlic naan were ready good. 
Overall a good experience but there is a scope of much improvement. However, since that day I have heard only good stuff about the place and probably deserves another try sometime soon.

With multi cuisines popping up everywhere in Kolkata, it is increasingly difficult to find a satiating Indian and Mughlai place. This may sound bizarre, but there are only handful of places where you can have delectable dishes without feeling bloated. With the entry of Kareem's this could be seen as a ray of hope, and Sector 5 has added another feather in its cap. 

If Oudh 1590 had Royal décor, same can be said for Kareem's albeit a more modernized version of it. We dig places with high ceilings and with such a magnificent front gate flanked by random pattern windows will make you fall for this place. 

Such delightful décor should and was complemented with extremely chivalrous staff. We had a fair idea of their best items and got going with the Murgh Pankhudi Kebab- Kareem's special. The buzz around Pankhudi Kebab is justifiable as the 6 succulent pieces of chicken were covered in tangy and a little spicy layer of sauce. Followed by Murgh Dum Biryani- Kareem's special, this dish needs special mention. Quite different from the conventional Kolkata Biryani, this one is a tad muggy but not in a gross kind of way. With the spices well cooked you will also find fried onions alongside the usual clove and cardamom. What made it mouthwatering was the fact that somewhere around 8-10 mid-sized pieces of Chicken. For sides we went for Murgh Tikka Masala, and it was stupendous. The gravy was pretty thick, but can't complain. 

There is no need to give this place a second thought, and the recent tax reforms have maximised affordability. Will be looking to grab few Gosht items on our next visit.

Last Friday we went for lunch from office. We ordered their signature item "Murgh potli kabab" which took almost 1 hr. to arrive that too after several follow-ups. So that is the darker side but the quality of the item was really good and I would recommend to try this item. The butter tandoori roti was not al all soft rather kind of pappad type. We also had "Ghost Nihari" which is again a famous item of them, and also recommendable.The staffs are well behaved.

The best place to have nawabi delicacies and Biryani.
The decor is very enchanting and the service is great too.
We had nawabi murgh kebab and it was the ultimate kebab I ever had.
The mutton biryani and lahori murgh was perfect with the right amount of spices and hotness.
The meat melts in your mouth with each bite youll feel like a true nawab!
Absolutely in love with this place.
Highly recommended.

A place you just can't miss.
Our being there was just a coincidence and a lovely one.
Though I went in with couple of vegetarian friends but can't eat at kareems without ordering a Non Vegetarian dish if you are into one. 
The Mutton korma was yummmm.
@jaagrit Jain.   @ketan Bhuwania 
Two vegetarians ordered for Dal Makhani and Paneer Do pyazaa. Very well cooked and good serving too.
The breads served hot and cooked well.

I take away .5 just for the drinks. They were something that could be improved. Orange Mojito and Watermelon Mojito.

Biryani is like rice sauted with chicken gravy or in Bengali bhaat ar mangsho jhol makha.
The mutton side dish was also too bland

A grand restaurant with brilliant food.

The restaurant has a royal get up. The food, service and ambience is praiseworthy.

Things which I tried -

1. Murgh Malai Tikka: Soft and fresh chicken pieces served with chutney and salad. A very good starter to start things with. 

2. Garlic Naan: Nicely baked dough. Soft and hot.

3. Butter Chicken: Chicken served in gravy. One of my all time favourites.

4. Mutton Biryani: The Biryani is amazing. I really enjoyed it. Biryani lovers must try it. 

5. Firni: The firni was so-so.

6. Caramel Custard: A brilliant dessert. This dis stole my heart although I never expected that. This dish came as a surprise.

Overall, a nice experience at Kareem's.

It was my first time being in Kareem's. The foods were delicious. We have ordered for Murgh platter,  chicken Lahori, Murgh tikka biriyani,  gosht Keema biriyani, butter nun and paneer Sia mirch.. specially the scrumptious murgh tikka biriyani must be tasted... I guess Lahori chicken is the best spicy item that goes exactly with biriyani.. nd the quantity is also enough to share. Overall the ambience and the quality of food made Kareem's a must try restaurant...

Kareems is situated near Rdb cinema hall  salt lake, sector- v ...just behind the Infinity Benchmark Building...
Firstly the decoration of the restaurant is quite soothing....and the behaviour of the people is so good..
Now I come to the food...less I can speak is better for all...I just request everyone to visit hear just for one time to taste the flavour of  food...mainly dum biriyani and Malai kabab....the foods are very much familiar with its price....I want to visit here again for more other dishes

Kareem's has always been in my wishlist. They are basically renowned for their scrumptious Mughlai and Hydrabadi dishes. It's located near RDB cinemas, Sector 5. A great place for a family or group lunch.
The interior decor and ambience was just perfect.
We ordered -
1.Watermelon and Orange Mojito : Both of them were so refreshing, sweet and frizzy with the essence of watermelon and orange.
2. Kareem's Special Afghani Murgh Tandoori : The best starter I ever had. The chicken was properly grilled and tasted so buttery and cheesey
3. Kareem's Special Dum Biryani : It was so delicious, not so oily or rich in spices. It contains two large pieces of chicken. The biryani was enough for two people.
4. Murgh Lahori : This dish absolutely go along with the biryani. It contains 4 pieces of chicken. This dish was little bit spicy but tasted so good.

I had this place on my radar for the next family event and what could be better than having 3 birthdays in the same month? :) So today on a fine Sunday afternoon went there for lunch with my Mom and Dad.So we started off with the Murgh Yakhni Shorba, which is the North Indian name for Soup as we know it. And let me tell you it'll redefine your idea of soup and how it can be perfected with an Indian touch. For the starters, we took the Murgh Peshawari Tikka because I have had the Peshawari flavor before and Kareem's made it even better! Along with this, we took the Gosht Barra Chaap, with the mutton ribs, it was just perfect with the dahi topping over it and brought out a unique flavor within itself. Well, to be frank, we were a bit full of these but still, I knew I had to try out the main course. So I already checked out the menu before choosing this place and I had the Gosht Karachi in mind which claims to have been made with spices brought straight from Karachi, later I come to know this is their specialty! The tender mutton on this dish just blew me away and this dish is perfect to be had with Garlic Naan. So we took one Garlic Naan and one Plain Naan (when the health conscious person in Mom woke up! :D). I'm fond of Biriyanis so had to try from Kareem's, so I went ahead and ordered the Gosht Dum Biriyani, Kareem's special. It had 4 pieces of mutton, two big potatoes, and the Biriyani looked very healthy with no heavy oil and it was very light, just one thing to note here is that the mutton was very spicy and was loaded with chilies, just have in little bits and you'll be fine. After the last spoonful (or handful) of biriyani, I knew I was completely full. But just to cover the entire spectrum Kareem's had to offer and a little craving for the sweet tooth I ordered the Malai Firni for me and Dad and an Orange Mojito for my mom. The firni was just out of this world! It'll melt in your mouth the moment you put it in, just amazing. The Mojito was perfect, no extra sweetness and the soda was just perfect.So, as they say, all's well that ends well. I loved Kareem's and would definitely recommend everyone to go there. I'm rating it a 4.5/5 and couldn't give full marks for the Mutton in the Biriyani. Overall a great place to go with family and friends as the ambiance is soothing and calm with good music and just enough for my liking. :)
Thanks for reading my review!

This Sunday thought of tasting some Mughal khana. With this thought we paid a visit to the much heard kareem's. Here is the report card
Ambience- 4/5
Nothing lavish but simple and sober. loved their dishes and glasses:-p
Quality- 5/5
We ordered
Watermelon mojito- it was mind-blowing. Too refreshing. Little tangy little sweet. Perfect for the start
Orange mojito- it also was perfect. Right amount of tanginess coupled with minty flavour
Sweet lassi- it came in a tall glass which was a little too sweet which was unnecessary. Medium consistency
Virgin mojito- normal
Peshawari chicken- best starter I had till now
It came in combo of flavours. The chicken was tender and the yoghurt melted in the mouth
Murg dum biriyani- typical Hyderabadi biriyani with the aloo:-). It was a little spicy quite flavourful with 4 huge chicken pieces which is not soggy like found in other biriyanis. Came with complimentary raita
Gosht karachi- gravy was from the paste of brown onions. On tasting first it tasted sweet then tangy and finally hot. This a unique dish of gosht and a must dry. Came in 4 huge pieces of mutton
Butter naan- absolutely soft and buttery
Quantity- 4/5. I feel the biriyani was a little less in qty
Staff - 4/5
They out of misunderstanding first provided me with mutton biriyani. But upon telling they immediately changed and brought chicken biriyani. I got to taste both:-p
Price- 5/5. Not too expensive. 
Overall a good visit. Highly recommended.

Fabulous decor and ambience.. when you enter the restaurant two storey restaurant and it's decor gives you immediate good impression. Waiter are very courteous.. 

we ordered chicken platter first it consists chicken malai tikka 3pc (really cheesy), chicken sheek kebab 6pc , and two more types of kebab each type 3 types. It was tender and juicy and taste of each and every preparation is 10 on 10. I would suggest please accompany the kebabs with green mint chutney. 

Next come to waiter's suggestion.. chicken kulfi kebab sounds interesting.. well taste is out of the world.. cream and cheese wrapped chicken tengri packed in aluminum foil and roasted.. Omg!!! Onw of the best kebab so far.. really worth it. 3pcs per plate. We had already placed main course order but this kulfi kebab made us almost full. So we requested to cancel some order.

 We cancelled chicken tikka biryani (next time ;) and had chees naan , cheese chili naan , chicken dahiwala and and and another best dish for the evening ghost karachi.

 Cheese!! Literally the used chunks of cheese cube in the naan instead of greeted cheese. That's a treat for cheese lover. 

Chicken dahiwala white gravy was good consists 4 pcs.

 But ghost Karachi was something u should crave for. The thick brown gravy have unique taste ( sure I'm gonna try that again ). 

We were so full there lime soda helped us in that situation!! 

And yes so far lemon water handwash bowl is a rare great now a days!! Fully satisfying.. worth a multiple visit to this place.. :)

Maybe we were the persons with worst luck that day. I saw many great reviews both before and afterwards, but our afternoon date at Kareem's went horribly wrong. One of my friends have come from Bangalore, so we selected this place over many others for a lunch. To start with, the galawti kebabs tasted alright, though I have had softer and tastier versions in other places. The murgh potli kebab was not soft and to make the matter worse, had hairs in it. When reported, they only replaced it partly. Then we ordered mutton biryani and a chicken dish, but were served a chicken biryani and a mutton dish. And above all, the staff were never apologetic or even helpful. They seemed to be more concerned with speaking English than doing their duty properly. And this all came with prices on higher side.
Not going back anytime soon!

Went last night with a group of  friends.3 veg and 3 of us were non -veg.well the ambiance was really plush and nice,courteous staff.ordered the following.
GOSHT BARRAH,MURGH SEEKH KEBAB,GOSHT KARACHI,MIX VEG,PANEER LAHORI ,BRAIN MASALA AND DUM KI DAL WITH BUTTER NANS AND ROOMALI ROTIS.Well the gosht barrahs and seekh kebabs were with a thick creamy white dressing--Very strange and weird,because no flavour of the meat was there,then came gosht karachi with 2 roomali rotis
Our veg friends were salivating.
after 15 min came the brain masala and dum ki daal
and in the end came the paneer dish and the mix veg.very strange how a paneer dish took 20 min more than burrahs??Anyway..the highlights were the dum ki dal and the brain masala--Really Superbly done!!!The rest of the food was average.Roomali rotis were excellent!!All in all a nice evening but vegetarians be ready to wait for a long time...yes the Dum ki dal is worth waiting for!!

We had ordered for a lunch party at office from here. Pretty decent variety of North India delicacies. Rates are OK-ush but slightly in the expensive side. But given the decor, quality and location the price seems justified. Had biriyani, mutton chapli kebab, murgh malai kebab, paneer butter masala, kadai chicken, tandoori roti, dal fry and shahi firni. They have packed that in a nice lunch box and delivered to office. Very convinient, I must admit. Taste wise, too good.

Now coming to the food, we had Murgh Tikka, Galauti Kebab, Garlic nun with Mirg Lahori. All dishes we tried was okay. Disappointed about servers those who are not well trained & our table was swarming with flies which the management did not do anything about.

I absolutely loved this place. We had mutton shammi kebabs, mutton biriyani, lahori chicken and soda sikhanji. I loved the way they made there biriyani, so less oil and really flavourful. Infact the same goes for the rest of the dishes as well. Coming to the restaurant, the ambience was good, set ups were new and tidy and the staffs were really well behaved. Overall had a great food.

Short version: By far the best Mughal meal I have ever eaten! We didn't go for the biryani - but chose starter, roti and gravy. All of which were amazing! Go for the Garlic Naan and Murgh Lahori, you won't be disappointed. The Watermelon Mojito (mocktail) is refreshing and the shahi tukda is nice way to round off the meal.Long version: Considering the nationwide reputation of Kareems but trying it during my visit to Kolkata was a must. I wasn't in the mood for rice, so we decided to go with a roti gravy as you get to try more dishes.
For starters we tried to Chaap Fry (Mutton Chops fried in an egg-crumb coating). I've had a lot of Mutton chaap in my life (rib of the goat, where the meat is tender), but this style of chaap was new to me. I didn't expect it to be good, the combination of the lightly fried egg and soft mutton of the chaap was divine. For those who are sick of the standard chicken kabab fry and it's variants should give this a try.I wasn't interested in the mocktails, but the Watermelon mojito gave us some much needed respite from the heat of Kolkata's winter.For the main course, we went with the Lachcha Paratha and Murgh Lahori. On the insistence of a friend, we tried one Garlic Naan. The gravy was amazing - it's reddish brown in colour and has a rich taste that I can only describe as "Mughal". What we did realise is that the Garlic Naan really adds to the flavour of the gravies offsetting their spiciness or sweetness, depending on which gravies you chooseWe closed off with the Shahi Tukda. If you've had it in weddings, you probably remember it as soggy slices of bread in a mish-mash of sweet liquid. But this shahi tukda was elegent - almost presented like a Tiramisu. Despite being full, I couldn't resist going for this again and again, spoon after spoon. Overall, easily the best Mughal meal i've ever eaten. Don't miss Kareems when you're in Kolkata

After long waiting finaly today I visit Kareem's, and the food experience was amazing. There is so much option on kebab and the "murg kulfi kebab " is one of the iconic dish. Also the"chaap fry" which is also a good option in starter. " gosht dum biryani " their speciality but its doesnt taste like that. Hospitality is 10/10 . Service guys are very polite and helpful. 
Drinks which they are served its good but over priced .
Overall its a good restaurant. Must visit
Thank you

Let me be very clear about one thing. Those who have gone to Karim's at Old Delhi Jama Masjid, they will visit there every time they go to Delhi. And being a Karim's fan, when I heard about this restaurant, I went to have a try, thinking that this is its branch. It is infact no. It is KarEEms something quiet different, and probably exploiting the brand name of KarIms of Delhi. 

The food is ok, but we get this kind of food at many places in Kolkata. Also probably, I entered with too much expectations, to taste the Shirmal and Nihari of Karim's, what I got was average. Just want to warn fellow foodies.

AMBIENCE: Done up in shades of blue & cream white, it oozes charm & elegance.
SERVICE: It was good.
MENU: Has a wide variety of kebabs curries & biriyanis. 
FOOD: The Afghani murgh tandoori was good & had quite a similarity with chicken reshmi kebab. The mushroom tikka was disastrous. It was sour & the mushrooms were overboiled. The butter naan was okay. The paneer Lahori was okay but a little too oily. The gosht Karachi was stringy, chewy & overdone. The respite came in the form of doodhi halwa which was good & innovative.

Located at  sector v salt lake .. with a huge entrance opening to well organised lobby and courteous staff. it was our first visit for family dinner,  for starter we ordered MURG CHARGA, MURGH PESHAWARI  AND MUTTON GALAUTI KEBAB...MURGH CHARGA WAS NOTHING MORE THAN DEEP FRIED CHICKEN SOLD AROUND COLOOTOLA, murg peshawari was bit raw.. Galauti kebab was ok sort. for the main course we had Murgh Lahori, and Gosht karachi..wit butter naan and KAREEMS SPECIAL GHOST DUM BIRYANI, the quantity is not great it was just enough to serve  two  people.. our theme of dinner was pakistani food... but i wondered if this is the way the cook their food.. but ek visit to banta hai...enjoy

We ordered Kareem's Signature Gosht bara Chap for starters along with Potli and Peshawari Kebabs. Bara Chaap was good to taste but the mutton was no way lean. It was hard and rubbery. Potli and peshawari kebabs were okay deserving no special mention. The rann biriyani for main course was cancelled as we were told they could not serve that anymore. It's substitute of Murgh Tikka biriyani arrived after 50 mins of waiting. A lot of items in the menu card were not available. To sum up, a Friday at Kareems is not a very good idea.

I have heard about Kareem's brand but this is my first time experience here. No other better place for kebabs. I haven't tried all the kebabs. Special mention about the Murgh Malai Tikka, Murgh Hari Mirch Tikka. Next time definitely going to try all others.

Well, I was targeting to be here for several months now. So this weekend when I happened to visit Sector V I headed start to Kareem's. 
The order comprised of Murg Peshawari Tikka Kebab, Murg Lahori, Murg Dum Biryani "Kareem's Special" served with complementary Raita, Chaas and Malai Firni. 
The Peshawari Tikka was too good to be true! I wanted to cancel the rest of the order and try something more from the Kebab section but by then the main course was ready to be served. Sad, I waited for the Biryani to be served. It was nice, had a mild tangy after taste, which as a lover for Kolkata Biryani did not make happy.... But I must confess, if my love for Kolkata Biryani is set aside it tasted nice. The Murg Lahori was very good. It would have been great if I could have had had it with some Indian breads on the menu. 
The Chaas too was very refreshing and my friends went gaga over the creamy texture of the Malai Firni.
With tummy's full, we promised to come back again and try all the Kebabs....

Superb service showed by the staff Bijoy. We were informed in the beginning that the Kufli kebab will take around 20-25 mins and then after 15-20 mins the staff came to inform that it will take another 5-7 mins and brought roasted papad as complimentary as he said till the time the starter is ready we can have that. After the starter was served in a unique way as it was wrapped in aluminium foil. It was completely delicious, the cheese were grilled perfectly. The Kulfi kebab is a must try. Also ordered Murgh Sia Mirch which tasty and Gosht Dum Biryani Kareem's special where the mutton was juicy but biryani rice was okay. Ordered Green Apple Mohito which was good and Cucumber Cooler as recommended by the staff. However, we replaced the Cucumber Cooler with Orange magic as it was not up to the mark.

So the location of this outlet is perfect , just opposite barbeque nation.

Has a really nice decor and seating .

Now coming to the food , Afghani Chicken Tandoori was perfect . Mutton Korma could not match the Delhi Branch's taste though. 
Service was prompt . Overall , worth a visit for sure!

Good ambience, good food. Definitely worth the money. Tried the melt in ur mouth galouti kebab and murgh lasooni tikka. The cheese garlic butter nun was fully loaded with goodness of yummy cheese but their murgh lahori side, recommended by our server, was bland and lacked seasoning. The moctails are good watermelon virgin mojito and fresh lime soda are pretty good as thirst quenchers. They deserve a 2nd visit soon.

I just loved this place. First time went to celebrate a friend's birthday and ordered mutton biriyani. The biriyani was light and tasty with good portion size. It was very dry though. The chciken tikka was quite good. On my next visit with family ordered for chicken hariyali kebab. I speciafically mentioned that my kid is going to have it. But they made it spicy with lot of green chilli. The chicken potli kebab was good though. The mabience is nice and spacous. It is also good for large groups.

This is a great restaurant that I tried on the eve of Eid Ul Fitar. A muslim name that is well known around India for great mughlai cuisine, and did not let us down. We ordered a tandoori starter. Mutton Biriyani (special kind). I don't remember the exact names as i am reviewing this after very long time. But trust me when i say that even if u forget the names of the dishes u won't forget the wonderful taste and presentation of them. We definitely tried the Mutton Halim. A dish prepared with mutton chunks and different dals and spices cooked slowly, a special dish for the occasion of Eid. And lastly we tried the firni. Not overwhelming fragrances but a mild dessert smell that is indicative of a great firni. A great restaurant at Sector V. A must visit place. Cheers!!

First of all kudos to the decor team for giving such a stunning outlook to this restaurant 
Located just opp to the RDB cinemas 
This out and out food joint is a must for people who want to some good mughlai dishes 
Though it was a sunday afternoon and we had to wait for about 15-20 mine for our turn
The wait was worth the while 
We settled in for 
Watermelon mojito and virgin mojito 
Mocktails are seldom well made and this was really well tossed up 
For starters we had chicken pankhudi kebab , the pieces were of moderate size but the taste was brilliant  
For mains we had kareems dum gosht biryani and gosht karachi . 
The handi biryani was brilliant the amount is good and its not stuffed with heavy spices making it good for your tummy :P

The restaurant staff were extremely courteous and service was really prompt

Nice place with a great setting. Came here during  Nabami with friends since we heard a lot about this place and were pretty excited about the experience. The place has a great ambience. Staff were ok but the crowning jewel of the place which should be the food was a letdown. We placed an order for Murgh Malai Kebabs , Galauti Kebab in starters Ghosth Biriyani in the main and Firni as dessert with Salads in the side. The Murgh kebabs looked great coming off the kitchen juicy and delicious topped off with thick cream but once they arrived on the plate and entered our mouths all that buttery butterfly feeling kind of went pop. The pieces were soft but burnt and felt like we had ordered for charcoal malai kebab. Well, we got over that; hoping that the Biriyani and Galauti Kebabs would take away that Titanic feeling that were running thorough our heads. But alas the Biryani was dry and somehow it became apparent why the waiter asked us to take a side dish while ordering... We somehow got it down our throats and waited for the Galauti Kebabs and desserts to come in. The minutes ticked and when neither arrived we asked and found that they had completely forgotten about the Kebab order itself. Disappointed that the Galauti Kebabs were now in a land of the unreachable since that would mean a 45 min more wait we asked for our desserts before that option got exhausted as well.   Anyway when they finally brought the Firni it was okish at best, our minds still munching on the kebabs we could not have. All in all it wasn’t what we had expected but considering it was Puja time and the Puja rush was on I am willing to give this place a second go and see if it is able to live up to its praises in the second try.. Till the next visit.. For now visit this place at Pujas at your own risk.. U may or may not have a good experience.

Located in sector 5 i decided to visit this place on a normal weekday since heard that the service was slpw on special days and festivals.

Lovely interiors....huge space. Service was good and food was WOW.

#raan tandoori- A must try. Good portion. Really tasty. Loved it.
#murgh potli kebab- flavourful.
# shabnami kumbh- quite surprising but even the vegetarian dishes were extraordinary.
# gosht dum biryani- usually biryanis ate not that good in fine dining restaurants but this one was yummy. Not disappointing at all.
#paneer lahori- out of the world
#dum ki dal- equally good
# roomali roti- this needs a special mention. It was just perfect. The softness n quality. WOW.
#the mocktails were all good...
Peach and raspberry iced teas and mojito.

Overall great. Would be visiting again soon.

I was hearing a lot of noise about this place and all for good reasons and so this was in my wish list for quite sometime. 

This is located just beside 10 Downing Street and it has two floors. We were taken to the first floor. There is some grandeur in its decor with large mirrors, carpeted staircase, chandeliers and also they have very comfortable sofas in the waiting area.

We ordered - will go back to this place for only kebabs next time ;)

Murgh Potli Kebab (Minced Chicken stuffed in a fillet of chicken marinated with chef's special spices) - This was just awesome
Murgh Dum Biriyani - 'Kareem's Special'
Gosht Dum Biriyani - 'Kareem's Special'
-- Firstly, this is not Kolkata Biriyani, so if you want to try something different - Hyderabadi / Lucknow / Awadhi Style biriyani then go ahead and try it. The Gosht Dum Biriyani is preferable among the two.
Gosht Karachi - Gosht cooked in a brown onion gravy with masalas specially imported from Karachi - The gravy was bit on a the sweeter side but the overall dish was good.

Good Ambulance, Very good food quality. Especially their kababs and biriyani is blissfull. Not to forget their special malai firni. You will never want to taste any other firni again. Only thing that made me a little annoyed was that their waiters were in extreme hurry to take away the plates from our table just the moment we finished with that dish. So Kareem’s please be a little patient. Otherwise good place for visit with both family and friends.

This is one of the best mughlai cuisines in Kolkata.I along with a friend came to this place today for lunch. We  were greatly impressed by the ambience. The staffs are very good. I liked the hospitality. Coming to the food,we ordered a half murg mussallam,lahori chicken & butter-naan in the main course. The briyani rice in that mussallam tastes amazing. The chicken in both mussallam and lahori was spicy,tender and was cooked so well that a juicy feel comes out on each and every bite.
In the desert, we ordered a shahi tukda and a malai firni. Both of them tastes awesome. Only the quantity of shahi tukda was huge. 
Had a great lunch today. Thanks to Kareem's. Lots of love.

Yet another overrated place in the heart of the city. 

Visited this place for lunch, and we had got very good reviews about this place, the expectation was so high that we drove from park street to Salt lake sector 5 to have some authentic north indian food. I think you have already got the hint how much we regretted our decision . Now let's have some details-

We entered and the receptionist asked for details like number of members etc and asked us to go upstairs. I can't say if she was very hospitable. I will still discount that here. Only point is, i have seen staffs to be more courteous at other places.

Ambiance- the seating area upstair got too crowded and noisy within few minutes. I would say if they reduce the number of tables that could make it little better. But again priorities might differ, may be majority folks are not bothered about the ambiance, they only care about food.

So let's talk about that, food. We ordered chiken potli kebab and mutton galauti. My apologies if i have misspelled those two delicacies. Mutton galauti was ok. But as soon as I cut open the chicken potli, guess what I found there? A human hair, entangled with the casews and keemas. Well, we showed this miracle to the waiter and he changed that. But this is not something you would expect in a fine dinning  restaurant.
Now comes the main course- we order gosht biriyani (mutton)  and lahori murg and butter naan. The waiter comes with the order and serves the order - yes you guessed it right, he served us chicken biriyani. Again we raise this with the waiter,  he picks up the biriyani pot and also the chicken leg piece from one of our plates and put that back in the biriyani pot. Only they know what are they going to do with that. We got our gosht biriyani after 2 to 5 mins of wait, can't reject the possibility of it coming from another table who ordered chicken biriyani and got our gosht biriyani.

By this time all the enthusiasm was gone and we were cursing those who lured us into this place. But it seems the food lover spirit within us was not dead yet, we gathered all our courage to go for desserts and ordered firni. The firni was nothing like firni, the texture that you should be able to  feel in your tongue was not there. But given the previous episodes it was ok. 

Bottomline, don't repeat our mistake, there are plenty of places which specialize in this cuisine with a better service , food quality and taste and better ambiance.

The decor was really good. The Kareem's special kebab was moist and juicy really nice. The Chicken butter masala was a little sweetish tasted not like normal ones. The gosht dum biriyani didn't taste like normal biriyani it was a bit Hyderabadi style but you can't call it Hyderabadi. One thing I've noticed, all the dishes I had it didn't had proper salt I had to add salt in all of them.

Had galauti kebab.. gost dum Biriyani and Lahori murgh.. the only dish that was satisfactory was Lahori murgh.. I had galauti kebab in Oudh 1590.. and it was far better.. the spice itself was different and added a very different taste.. here the kebab was not that tasty and aromatic.. now come to the Biriyani, honestly speaking it was really disappointing.. it seemed like I am having some basmati rice with some mutton pieces and decorated with fried onion and coriander leaves.. no flavour and taste at all.. as per restaurant it is Lucknow style dum biryani but I had dum biryani before as well and it can be flavourful and much more tasty.. service is good as per expectation..
Overall much more improvement is required in terms of food.

Ambience wise: beautiful decor, comfortable seats, clean toilets, well behaved and well dressed waiters. To be frank, too many waiters milling around you. Kind of a bit intrusive privacy wise. 

Food: we were three people and we ordered Potli kebebs, kulfi kebebs and murgh mussallan whole. Along with two rounds of watermelon iced tea (this is out of this world good) and green apple mojito and watermelon mojito. We tried the Shahi tukra too and it was amazing. I liked the watermelon version of both more. The Potli kebebs were very good, the cheesy kulfi kebebs were amazing. Murgh mussallam was a tad too strong on the tongue. Overall good. Though they can improve a lot on the variety of flavours. Try it out. You won't feel bad. I'll be going there again to try out their mutton and fish dishes.

1. Gosht dum biryani: there isn't any biryani in town as bad as this one. Cook at home and you will do better.
2. Afghani murgh tandoori: passable
3. Mutton nalli barra kebab: meat was hard/chewy. You'll need someone to chew it for you!
4. Mutton istew: 3rd rate preparation, not worth talking about.

One of the best places in Kolkata to try some amazing awadhi cuisine. I ordered the murgh platter, cheese garlic naan, murgh akbari. The murgh platter had an assortment of kebabs, the flavours were so imminent that every bite of the chicken felt awesome. A special mention to the murgh akbari this place serves. This is the best murgh akbari one can find in Kolkata. The chicken pieces were cooked to perfection and the gravy was adequately spiced. The naan was too good.

Adding to its value is the splendid decor, the spacious arrangement of seats, prompt service and friendly staff. Overall a nice place to have a quality time with friends and family.

We ordered murgh lasuni kebab. It was mouth watering. We didn't like the tandoori chicken. It was average. We also ordered peshawari chicken. This was very spicy and the chicken was less cooked. We has dahi murgh and jeera rice. Dahi murg was awesome and jeera rice was okay.  We also ordered keema biriyani.  Keema biriyani was too good and the quantity was huge. We also has gost karachi , and it was stunning. At last shahi tukda was awesome. It had a heavenly taste. 
Price was reasonable. We were 6 and the bill was 3800 whoch includes starter main course as well as desert. A must mughlai restaurant.

Good place to take a break from your work and indulge into some good kabebs.  Of all the kabebs tried, my favorite has to be the ghost Barra n galuati. I had also tried the biriyani but it didn't match with my taste buds.  Services are here.  Tried out the kabebs

The city have waited long for a fine dining mughlai cuisine restaurant. Kareem's has tried to answer that. The ambiance will leave you awestruck. The grandure and pompous can be witnessed the moment you step-in. Seats were comfortable but table decor was average.
We ordered Murgh Pankhudi Kebab and Murgh Potli Kebab for starters. Potli Kebab has minced chicken and cashew stuff inside chicken kebab. Oh my God what a taste!
Pankhudi Kebab is chicken wing marinated with their special sauce also tastes heavenly. Though they claimed this one of their specialties but to me Potli Kebab has to be their specialities and a must try.
Wanted to try few more kebab dishes but thought to keep space for their much talked-about biriyanis, hence tried Murgh Dum Biriyani. But to be honest this not the biriyani taste which bongs can swear about. This is mix of Hyderabadi and Lucknowi biriyani. Sorry if I have disappointed gastonomers who had this Kareem's biriyanis is their wishlist. I would give it a skip if I revisit the property again. There are much better alternatives available.
However for running a restaurant the most important is the service and hygiene. These both parameters where Kareem's failed badly. Their servers are not at all trained. They kept on dropping food while serving or dropping cutlery while cleaning table. We also found traces of hair in their food which they promptly changed it. The servers also not aware about dishes' availability. They take order and then come back after few minutes with disappointment.
I will highly recommend this restaurant for kebabs with side dishes and bread. Price is at par standard neither cheap or exorbitant. They still have a long way to go unless management takes table service and hygiene seriously. 

Update on 21st Dec'17:
Things have improved since then. This time went for only kebabs. Ordered Murg Malai Kebab, Murg Peshwari Kebab and Murg Seekh Kebab. All 3 were excellent in taste and texture. Rating increased to 4.

I had heard a lot about this place, had a  chance to visit this place for an office lunch out. The decor is nice and vibrant, the staff are also well mannered and nice. It took some time for them to accommodate us but that's OK.

Coming to the food, we asked for raan biryani which was not available so we went ahead and ordered for Ghost Dum biryani, they give raita with Biryani and along with it we went for Murg lahori, which was boneless chicken cooked with spices. On the starters we went for Murg platter 30 pieces. I liked the murg platter which was an assortment of various murg kebab's. The ghost biryani was really good, raita did its job to make it more soothing and the mutton pieces were well cooked and juicy.

Overall, it was nice experience, will be looking forward to have the raan biryani.

I was eagerly interested to visit Kareem since i heard about its launch at Kolkata.. As there are very famous Kareem at Mumbai and Delhi.. I thought it will maintain a standard quality.. I went there for lunch at Astami ie on 28th Sept 2017, as during puja they dont reserve seat so we were expecting a long wait.. But we reached there around 3:15. And the concerned person asked us to wait for 30 mins.. But after 15min they said call other member ur table is ready and we r closing to u have to order very fast... So few of my friends loitering outside came in hurriedly but then also we haf to wait 15 more mins...Anyway we got a cosy place to seat..
As they r closing and for Durga puja most of the dishes were unavailable.We ordered :

1. Chicken Pankhudi Kebab (2.5 /5) : Chicken was not fresh, otherwise taste was good.. 6pcs of small lolipop not full wing...

2. Mutton barra Chaap (4.5 /5) : This was excellent in taste.. I would give full marks if the quantity was good.. They serve 3 small pcs in a plate..

3. Fish Tandoori ( 4/5) : 4 pcs.of soft basa fish .. Good at taste. But they missed this order first when we asked for the fish they said u didn't order it.. But when we all insisted server said kitchen is closed let me check if we can make it.. Finally we got it, it was served not as starter but as main course,along with biriyani..

4. Chicken Tikka biriyani ( 4/5) : Hyderabadi biriyani with potato and small pcs of chicken tikka.. We couldn't count the no of chicken pcs as it was served approx. 4 pcs in a plate.. Good in taste, light spicy and potato pcs adds to its taste..

To conclude , Food quality is not that great, Overall Good but they should think about the quanity served.. And sply the service we had to ask 5 times or more to get a glass of water.. Then finger bowl they served was almost cold and they put lemon peel instead of lemon ring....
But I'll definitely visit this restaurant again as during puja most of them compromise in their quality...

Located in the hub of sector V, Kareem marks the distinction & brings to you flavours different from all the North Indian // Mughlai joints of Calcutta. The place is spacious (it spreads over two floors) & the decor is wonderful. 
The starters, Gosht Seekh Kebab & Nalli Boti Kebab are the best of the lot. The dum ki chaap is also good & their naan’s are huge in size as compared to its contemporaries. The Gosht Biryani is a different kind of good & brownie points to the quantity & portions of mutton they serve in a single plate. Overall, a must visit.

Kolkata just got another place to munch kebabs biryanis and Tandoori North Indian delicacies. In the last two months I have visited this place twice and eventually this place is turning into a corporate sector's favorite.
The first thing you notice when you step inside is a large reception cum waiting area. The space could have been used for dining but Kudos to the management to keep the space for customers waiting, thereby not overcrowding the dining area. The restaurant has two huge floors of dining area with large Tv screens and abundant seating space. 
The menu is extended to every corner of the rich Indian food history. Kebabs, Biryanis, Mussallans and elaborated vegetarian delicacies engages any foodie to satiate one's tastebuds.
As a vegetarian this might be a biased review but i must recommend this place for any foodie. 
I loved the Butter Garlic Mushroom because these were cooked nicely and were crispy. A sauté of curd enhanced the taste of the mushroom and was a complete surprise. 
We ordered Watermelon Mohito Orange Mohito, Yuzu and Elderflower sparkler and Peach Sparkler. All were syrup based and were sweeter than expected. 
I must say that comparing the food, the drinks were below average and did not meet the standards. All the drinks can be prepared better if they add fruit base to it.
Coming to the order of the main course, Paneer Lahori is a spicy dish with rich gravy and Paneer Tawa Se is a better option in main course. 
After observing and noting the experience of my non vegetarian friends, i would suggest the management to look into the preparation of Murgh Mussallan since the taste did not meet the expectations. 
The place is a modern day eatery with a exotic spread of tandoor dishes with comparable service standards. I would just recommend that the points stated can be rectified to take the restaurant to the next level.

After hearing a lot about the place decided to visit it during Puja with friends. We ordered Chicken Kebab Platter, Raan Biryani, Murg Lahori, Shahi Tukda, Fresh Lime Soda. Starting with the kebabs, the portions were generous, chicken was juicy and the masala used was perfect. The rain biryani was a revelation. Although they clajm it can serve 3-4 people, it served 6 of us very well. The mutton was tender, good portions, perfect use of spices, the biryani is unique and oil free. Teamed it with Murg Lahori which is also very nicely done. The shahi tukda was very nice. To wrap up all this we had Fresh Lime Soda to ensure the perfect burp!! Highly recommended.

After a gruelling exam session, I was craving for some mouth watering food and hence decided to give the Kolkata counterpart of the famous Kareem's a try. And no it did not disappoint.
Ambience-- grand yet subtle..its not too on your face. Comfortable sofas and chairs with beautiful furnishings. I've fallen in love with the tasteful flower motifs on them!
Order-- we ordered virgin mojito, watermelon mojito, chicken pankhudi kebabs, Kareem's special gosht biriyani, lachhedar paratha and gosht Karachi.( one of each)
Food- mojitos were excellent specially the watermelon although I wish the glasses were bigger.
Chicken pankhudi kebab was a riot of flavours! Tender delicate chicken pieces cooked with rich aromatic spices! There were six pieces in one plate.
Biriyani-- Kolkata people are emotional when it comes to biriyani and I'm no exception. And when I say this biriyani is one of the best I've ever had, it means something. It came in a large pot and the quantity was pretty good. There were many small to medium mutton pieces with two amazingly soft alus (potato). For us Bengalis, a biriyani without Alu is not a biriyani :p. Also it was not oily at all ( I hate oily biriyanis) and yet so tasty! It was served with a complementary wonderful raita!
The mutton side we took was equally yummy. The gravy was rich and spicy and what I really liked was the quality of the mutton they served. All the pieces were so well cooked and the meat was so tender! There were around 6 medium mutton pieces in this dish.
Pocket pinch-- 1500 for two including 18% gst.
So yes its a bit on the costlier side.
Overall-- a big thank you to Kareem's for opening over here and for such amazing gastronomic experience!

I have been here with my friend's on sashti day. Food quality is good. I liked the firni they serve.
But hotel staff are not good with customer, they were just standing in front of us,waiting for us to complete, so, that they can just pick up the plate. They were not even waiting for us to complete. The waiter didn't let me keep the firni container on table, he just took it from my hand. None of us liked their ways.

We can understand that there is huge crowd at times of puja  but they need to take care of customer hospitality.

Why say 12 when hungry customers are almost denied entry at 11 59AM with nonchalant staff reporting no food would be available before 1.
Hope the food,if & when we try some other time,is as delicious as was the lady in charge's disgusting attitude!It seemed we did a crime coming in a minute earlier,only because we respect Zomato.Strutting in were the staff 10 minutes later & making us feel..somehow..it was our fault!

Located just near of pantaloons in sector 5...
A spacious restaurant...
Serves probably the best butter chicken in the city...

Food: We ordered tandoori toti, butter chicken, chicken akbari, galwati kebabs and malauli firni..
Galwati kebabs were soft and tender... no words can describe the awesomeness of butter chicken... chicken akbari was not upto the mark..
The last but not the least the awesome malai firni... I am not sure if this are available in any places of the city.. but this is purelylove... i never ate a phirni like this...
A big thumbs up..

Ambience: Excellent and dtaffs are also good...

Thank you for tge experience... highly recommended...

When my friend told me at 9 pm about this place at sector 5 that she really wanted to try, I didn't give it much of a thought and left for Kareem's hoping to return after a quiet dinner and spend some time with her. But I was in for a surprise. On walking in, the first thing you spot is it's grandeur. It has this palatial feel to it and immediately our expectations raised ten fold. 
We started our sojourn with their chaap fry, lamb ribs enveloped in a nest of fried egg that tasted every bit good as it looked. 
Next was the murgh tangi kulfi kebab- an oxymoron for its name. The leg of a chicken came wrapped in foil that was burning hot. Once you manage to open it without scalding yourself, you find a succulent piece doused in cheese and cream and it tasted heavenly. Coming from someone who doesn't like creamy food. 
For main course we shared a murgh dum biryani and I was so happy to find a place that did hyderabadi biryani justice in Kolkata. Only glitch we found way too many tamarind seeds in our food. 
Finished it with their malai firni, a must have for dessert!

Kareem's located beside 10 Downing Street in Sec 5.
You can easily locate this place and the place was quite huge.

Decor and ambiance was very good. Staffs were friendly, service were little slow. We were at the time of lunch.

Drinks: Orange Mojito was a classic Mojito drink in orange syrup. It was very good.

Starters: Murgh Malai Kebab was also good and portion size was perfect.
Mutton Nalli Barra Kebab was tasted good but pcs were hard and portion size were small.

Main Course: Chicken Biryani was good enough for our lunch. Also quantity was not huge.

I went here with my friends for first time and i am totally dissapointed becoz the taste of the food and specially biryani are really bad.We have ordered at least 7 starters except chicken afgani all were bad . We also orederd 3 types of biryanis n believe us all were packed for parcel as we cant finished even 1 biryani becoz of its taste. The service n enviroment inside is good.They spoiled our moods n we all were really dissapointed as we expected a lot from KAREEMS.

This restaurant known for its mughlai cuisine But d biriyani was jus not up to d mark, a bit too much sour and ruined the taste, the chicken was well cooked and marinated but the quantity of the rice was not enough it wasn't worth  330 bucks a plate for take away.

'What a place to dine out' is the only thing that I can say in the context of reviewing this place. Right from the Ambience , Decor , Service , Quality , etc. this place is excellent . The service is prompt and the taste of the food is impeccable.

Let me start the review with a different note which is not expected from this restaurant. The gatekeeper who opens the door was kind enough to push the door for you which is pretty evident for all bigger restro however considering he is doing his regular job which includes no labour, no attention to ur car park outside(there is a separate parking area and staffs with fee applicable) he demands " bakshish" while you are leaving is the sign of very bad taste and cheapness. Not sure if the authority knows about it but personally I did not entertain. Either the management should take an action on this or you save save rs 10 from ur tips for those who actually serves u in the restaurant. 10 rs or 20 rs really does not matter but it's about expectation from positioning.

Most important part food is awesome. Ask for the special delicacies and you won't repent. Try out mutton Karachi with lacchedar paratha. Mojitos in mocktails are must try.. I really recommend orange mojito. Coolers are pretty good. Shahi tukra is must to end the meal. If you are too full take 1 only.

Visited Kareem's on Ekadashi for lunch in a group of six and needless to say , we had to wait for quite sometime to manage a table. The service was noticeably slow and mismanaged. Few options from menu weren't available and obviously the entire fine dining experience was missing , or else would have fetched 0.5 more as the food was remarkably impressive.
we ordered two portions each of -

MURGH POTLI KEBAB - first to hit the table and a must try !!

GALAWATI KEBAB - nice but we have had better.

KAREEM'S SPECIAL GHOSHT BIRYANI - personally not an ardent biryani lover but loved this one , recommending to try out their version.

apart from these , had CHEESE NAAN and GARLIC NAAN with CHICKEN LAHORI in lipsmacking red gravy but the Stunner was GHOSHT KARACHI ( highly recommended)
Fresh lime soda , virgin mojito and watermelon mojito accompanied the food out of which a friend complained of excess syrup in the watermelon version.
MALAI FIRNI was the only dessert available , but failed to impress any of us.

Looking forward for further visits avoiding any special occasion , to get a better experience and strike off my wishlistings including nihari ghosht , kulfi , malai and seekh kebabs.

I ate Kareem's special biriyani and it was a wonderful dish. However the only complaint that I have is that Kareem's refused to deliver me a 1100 rupees order merely 4 km away. This is not acceptable.

Who doesn't love Biryani on a craving afternoon and the crave becomes even stronger when it is the day after Vijayadashami, the only day we get to relax after Durga Puja before resuming with our daily routine. Likewise, our family decided to have a lunch at Kareem's for that day.

Kareem's is one of those hidden gems that not many people know about. The location of the restaurant is slightly off the main roads and is located on the ground floor of a corporate building. People who don't know the exact location, might easily miss this restaurant.

Talking about the food, its a restaurant all about North Indian and Biryani. Office goers of Sector V praise their biryani and kebabs. For starters we ordered a Murg Platter which is an assortment of 15 pieces of kebabs. There were four type of kebab in the platter, namely Seekh Kebab, Malai Tikka Kebab, Haryali Kebab and Tikka Kebab. The Seekh Kebab was best in class, extremely tender and tasty. All kebabs were well marinated and spiced. Malai Kebab and Haryali Kebab were well charred topped with melted cheese. We also ordered Bhetki Tandoori which was the steal of the show. The fish was extremely tender and just melted in the mouth.

Next up was the Mutton Biryani and soon as it came, our table was filled with the aroma of spices. The Biryani consisted of two succulent pieces of mutton and a small sized potato. The Biryani was cooked to perfection and the spices were just right. Only con is that the Biryani did not came in earthenware pot like many fine dine restaurants serve.

For main course, we ordered only one dish that is Murg Lahori. Again, the chicken was well cooked and was on the softer side. Gravy was not very spicy, just the right combination. We topped everything up with a fresh lime soda and ended with a Firni. Firni was pretty good, was topped with a lot of almonds.

Ambiance of the restaurant is calm and enjoyable. Lighting is not very dim and the decorations are nice. There are ample of tables to handle rush as there are two floors to this restaurant. Only negative is that the tables are located too close to one another.

Service of the restaurant was sort of bad on that day, the reason being given was lack of staff on a holiday. Food took ages to come, kebabs were served without chutney and chutney itself took another 15 minutes to come. The server was not very professional and was dropping grains of rice while serving the Biryani. Billing took another 15-20 minutes. Service at the gate was good though, they offered us umbrellas when it was raining and dropped us till the car.

Pricing is certainly on the higher side. A meal for four costs around ₹3500, however the food is definitely worth it. Quantity is good, I would suggest a platter of kebab rather than ordering individual portions. One portion of Biryani is enough for two people and the gravy item was also quantitative.

In a nutshell, a nice place to satisfy your Biryani and devour on some soft and succulent kebabs. Service definitely needs to improve. Would surely recommend visiting this place with family.

Ambience wise it’s nothing special.. we get tastier Mughlai dishes anywhere in kolkata so why run to sector 5 for the less tastier one .. the tandoori rotis were so hard and chewy.. waiting time is huge.. once you place the order you have to wait for atleast 15 20 mins for a dish.. waiters are busy watching television rather than catering to your needs

I went to this place with my family. We had bhetki tandoori in starter. In main course, we had gosht biriyani and butter chicken.
Bhetki tandoori was really good. Bhetki was fresh and succulent.
Biriyani was fantastic. It was served with 4 good pieces of mutton, one aloo and few fried onions. 

In dessert we badly wanted to try out their firni but unfortunately it was not available.

We ordered Chicken Biryani... The quantity was good with 4 pcs of chicken pieces served. But the taste was worst.  The Biryani seems to be prepared long back... Cold type... No flavour.. Very disappointed. Being in sector V, prices was expected to be high but quality was not matching with the charges.  Ambiance is amazing.

Awesome interior and decor.
Nice ambience at night and staff service was also good.
Their kebabs are mouth watering. We should have tried only kebabs inspite of ordering special biriyani. Biriyani looked tasty but it disappointed us. I recommend kebabs over biriyani here.
Deserts are also good. We tried Malai firni and Caramel custard. Little overpriced.

New in the city, an unit of kareems mumbai serving great mughlai food.  We a group of 6 people went to have a post puja lunch.  Hospitality is average but the quality of food is too good.  So is the serving portion. 
For starter i loved the potli kebab of chicken. 
Galouti kebab is also good but somehow i felt it was bit bald. Ran biriyani is awesome with perfect quantity to serve two people. For deserts it was firni.  But somehow it was different than thr other firnis we usually have in kolkata.

Last week I visited Kareems and I loved it. The food is delicious as well as the service. Chicken tangri kulfi is one such dish which is amazing and you need to try it once. I even liked the biryani which is different from the usual and the dessert was cherry on the top of the cake. It was a lovely ambience and a complete family restaurant. I would love to visit once again.

Horrible!

My friend and I were catching up for lunch after almost a year. We initially planned to go to 10D but found that it was closed. This prompted us to pick the most convenient alternative- Kareem's, which was right next door. The place looked decent having been newly built and we were not too disappointed about our choice.
The server who welcomed us was super well behaved, probably because he had worked in the UK before moving back to India (yes, we briefly chatted up and he was super super well behaved and the one star is only because of him!) but that's where all the niceness ended.

Half the items on the menu were not available and there were no napkins or chutneys/ pickles on the table. After a lot of deliberation, we finally ordered soda shikanji, galauti kebaab, chicken biryani, mutton ishtew and phirni. The food was strictly average. Typical Mughlai fare. Hardly any taste, just swimming in oil. Galauti kebaab is one of my favourite dishes but this one was a shame and so was the ishtew.

Our table was swarming with flies which the management did not do anything about.

I could have avoided writing this review and given them a second chance; However the incident that happened at the restaurant has promoted me to take this action so that I can let the world know what an unprofessional restaurant this is.

Since I was meeting my friend after a long time, we obviously had a lot to catch up on, due to which we were taking time to finish our food.
One of the waiters (don't know his name but he was short in height and was wearing glasses) came up to our table and started shouting and insulting us saying that we have ordered so less food and have been holding the table for 117 minutes and we had no right to do so and that we should leave immediately. We were so shocked at his sudden outburst that we did not know how to react. My friend and I work for top MNCs and hold managerial positions and never ever in our lives have we experienced this kind of horrible service. I live in London and the concept of dining out is to spend time with your dear ones and no one, even in their wildest of dreams, would ask you to leave saying that you are taking too much time. 

Anyways, so we asked to see the manager who was as lame as the waiter. He just had this stupid expression on his face and started apologising to us in the most insincere manner possible. He did not even reprimand the waiter.

All in all, what was supposed to be a nice lunch with my friend, turned out to be just the opposite, thanks to a bunch of nincompoops. May be the management should ask the UK returned server to give the restaurant manager along with the useless waiters, a crash course on customer service! Also, next time, please put stopwatches on the tables, so that people know that their time is up!

Never ever coming here again!

The biriyani was excellent and was so was the cheese kulcha and mutton Rogan josh but the surprise and best offering was the potli kabab. Will suggest everyone to try this dish.

Located at sector 5 Salt Lake just opposite to Bar be que nation.The place serves variety of kabab's,curries & Biriyani.
We had Gosht (Mutton) Barra Chapp which was extremely delicious it was full of Indian flavours.
Then came the Fish Ajwani Tikka which was equally good.After that we tried out one more starter which was the Murgh Tengri Kabab Kulfi it is an absolute Paradise for people who love cream & Cheese.It's full of calories.Then came the main course extremely soft butter nan then Murgh Biriyani which was not a traditional Kolkata style Biriyani but nonetheless it was decent. We took Lahori Chicken as our side dish it was decent could have been better.
Then came the desserts & to our disappointment their famous Shahi Tudka had finished so had to settle for Creme Caramel and Tutti-Frutti which was good.

Last week I had the opportunity to visit Kareems with my family for what turned out to be quite a pleasant lunch experience. Located conviniently at Sector V the Kolkata outlet of Kareems is a spacious and luxuriously designed family restaurant.We opted to sit on the first floor since we had a big group of 10.
With recommendations from the staff we decided to go for the Tangri Kulfi and one Recommended mutton kebab.
The chicken came wrapped in a capsule made of foil which on cracking open overflowed with the melted cheese sauce that coated the chicken leg.
The meat was tender and the cheese sauce was an absolute delight having some resemblance to one of my all time continental favourites the augratin.
The mutton although cooked on the bone was surprisingly tender and seasoned perfectly.
Now coming to their biriyani. We'll the staff clearly told us this wasn't the typical Kolkata biriyani you'd expect from an Arsalan or Royal. Now as a Kolkata biriyani purist I had a hard time accepting that biriyani but technically speaking it was cooked definitely well though the potato seemed underseasoned which also sort of appeared to be a misfit in that biriyani.
The Cheese Garlic Naan was spot on and probably the Butter Chicken along with it took it to the next level. Probably one of the best butter chickens that I have tasted not just in this city but even comparable to the best ones from Delhi. 
The meal ended on a sweet note with a perfectly made caramel custard. All of us thoroughly enjoyed the meal and definitely will be looking forward to our next visit.

The interiors are normal.. It's ohk.. Not something extraordinary. The food is very good ..I had the butteriest naan ever and the starter was just not those typical normal kebabs and all.. They add some touch up to make it tastier. The side dish was very good and tasty and quantity was good. 
NOTE: don't compare the aminia/arsalan naan to Kareems..Bcz there's a huge size difference.
THE phirni was very good. 
Soft and the toppings were good. Phirni was really overpriced to be honest. 
Overall a good experience.

Visited the place on Nabami and had a really hard time to get a table. The ambience is quiet nice for a family visit. We had ordered the recommended Murgh Malai Kebab in starter and it was really well prepared. In mains we went for the Akbari Murgh, Lahori Murgh along with butter naan Tandoori Roti, and finally a Kareem's special Chicken Biriyani. We were really disappointed with the Roti and naans, they were prepared really bad, felt like local chapatis. The sides were nothing special in taste but not bad either. The biriyani was a tad spicy but the chicken was cooked really well. In soft drinks we had ordered sweet fresh lime soda and green apple mojito. In terms of taste there are a lot of room for improvements, looking forward to visit the place again during non festive season and hoping for a better experience.

The service in this place has to improve. Yes I visited the place with family and friends during Durga Puja and yes we were prepared for a long waiting time. But the indifference and crudeness of the staff and waiters made it much, much worse than it should have been. A simple thing such as politeness can go a long way. Plus it took an hour to serve our food and even after complaints upon complaints, the staff were really not bothered at all. The food was also not quite up to the standard as expected from a place such as this. The rice was undercooked with an overdose of masala and spices. 
PS the food made me throw up later at night

Had the misfortune of visiting this place for dinner with family and friends on mahanabami, expecting a sumptuous dinner and this place didn't meet with any of our expectations.  Knowing Calcutta pujo crowds, we knew and were prepared to wait. It took 1 hour to seat us which was still ok.  After that started the horrors.  We had to ask for everything from glasses to  plates to someone to take our order. One of the guests got his course and the other 4 of us waited 45 mins for 4 chicken biryani. It was 10.45 by then and we were ready to eat the fine China plates by then. The Kareem special biryani turned out to be anything but special.  The rice was too spicy, the chicken undercooked.  The only good thing about it was that it had a potato and that the portion is enough to serve 2. The staff were frazzled and couldn't keep up with the crowds.  Several tables alongside were waiting to be served.

The ambience here is inviting, the people, cordial, the food delicious. The interior is cosy and comforting. However, I would definitely like to point out about the cleanliness: though the interiors are usually clean, I can't help comment about the flies, flying and dirtying the plates. And definitely, the delayed service; there's still some mismanagement in the team and there are lots of scopes of improvement, in the service and in the management team. Best wishes!

Easily located as it is just opposite the opium near RDB cinemas, sector 5.. Ambience is really good and staffs are also very well mannered... But if i talk about the food.. I personally felt it is not that good according to it's decor and all..  When i reached there i was very excited about the food...but when it is served it ruined my mood...the food was cold.. We ordered kebab platter.. Kebabs are very dry and not properly cooked.. Then we go for cheese garlic nan and butter chicken...nans are tasty but a little bit hard.. But the butter chicken was the disaster... It had no taste at all.. Overall the food is not rich at all..it is very light.. I dont know may due to puja the quality of food fall. But that can't be an excuse.. So overall for me it is a big disappointment!

People often confuse this outlet with the karim’s in Old Delhi but this is a different one opened up in Mumbai, in the year 1995. There on it expanded its outlet in India and abroad (UAE, Dubai). This outlet is a revolution in Mughal food scene, where elegance, class is combined with piqant and toothsome dishes! A recent outlet of this famous restaurant chain has been opened in Calcutta, at Saltlake Sector V. When you search for the ratings of it in Dineout, Zomato the high points they have is not boosted but just honest ratings from very satisfied foodies.

Hearing the name KAREEM'S, what comes to one's mind is New Delhi. We went to explore this place. The ambience of this place is quite good but I did not find the good to be scrumptious or mouthwatering .We ordered a murgh platter as starter which was quite good but for the main course when we ordered gosht karachi we did not find it to be as per the name nor it was to tasty,it had a normal taste even they served the bread which was burnt and was black when we told the staff then they changed and gave fresh one. Overall the experience was not upto the mark.

Good ambience which is refreshingly different from that of equivalent restaurants like Arsalan and Aminia.

We took Chicken and Mutton biriyani. The taste of the biriyani was more oriented towards the Paradise Hyderabadi Biriyani style though the use of potato could have been avoided.

It is a welcome change from the Aloo and Egg inclusive chicken/mutton biriyani that we generally get in Kolkata.

Waiters seemed inexperienced , overall experience was nice though there is room for improvement..

I came to know about this place couple of days back and the very first thought that came to my mind was - is this place in anyway a franchise of karim's from Delhi ? - a question that I thought of asking the beautiful owner( I think she is the owner ) but couldn't in the end: more on it later.

Now coming to the actuals. The place has nice decors so full marks to the interior designer there. We ordered murgh peshwari kebabs and it was spot on. Biryani was sadly not available which was understandable - seeing that we reached 15 mins before closure and that too on sashti. Having said that the alternative order was impressive too- chicken lahori and tandoori roti were amazing.

In dessert We tried the firni and it was good too. Overall i would definitely recommend this place.coming back to point I was wandering off to at the beginning of this review- while on our way to this place ,me and my friend called in to reserve a table , we were greeted with a friendly voice on the phone- who assured us of a table. After we came in ,we saw this beautiful hostess busy in a conversation with the person sitting at the billing counter. I am pretty sure she was the one who took the call nevertheless, We didn't think of disturbing her ongoing conversation. If she reads this review,  I would like to  personally commend on the nice food and decor to her and also to ask about the place's relationship with karim's (if any), lastly state the obvious that how iam coming back again not just for the food but also to say a 'hi'😉

First thing first, inspite of having a huge rush during dinner hours of Puja days, they managed to maintain the quality of food & service.

The food :-
For starters - 
1. Kareem's special Murg Pankhudi kebab ( highly recommend )  . The chicken was soft and juicy. The kebab had a soothing blend of tandoor masala & lemon with an overlay of butter.
2. Murg Seekh kebab is again highly recommend. It's seekh kebab moulded to perfection. The kaju, pesta , lemon and all other herbs and spices are bound to cause an avalanche of flavour in your mouth
The kebabs are ON POINT!

Main course :-
Warning - Do not try the Ghost plates. Ghost / Mutton is average and ain't worth 350+
Chicken Lahori is pretty good but it almost tasted like chicken reshmi butter masala.
Chicken Korma & Butter masala had nothing special as well.
The main course is AVERAGE!

Dessert - Firni would be a common choice but i would recommend spending your money on some kebabs over a decent rice pudding with rose water.

Mojitos are nicely prepared. The Green Apple Mojito is the best amongst the available choices.

Pocket pinch -  INR 900 per person to have an wholesome experience.

The ambience is not suitable for a date but is perfectly set up for business lunch.

Checks all the food boxes

So we reached this place thinking that this is the Delhi Kareem’s and we’re ready to hog on some really good food. But turns out this the Kareem’s from Bombay (does that exist?) 
So without wasting much time we went for our starters and main course. The starters were okay. I’ve had better starters but it had a different twist with their sauces and dips. 
The main course was the one I was waiting for. The biryani was really good and the sweet naans went super well with the dal and gravy.
This place has a different Indian feel to it. You’ll know when you taste the food here. This place is massive and on weekends this place can make you wait. 
PS - Book a table before you.

Aaahhh !!! What a taste to eat nd treat to watch..the name itself brings a lot of expectations nd they r doing justice to it...as soon as the biryani touches the tounge the eyes get closed to feel the flavour and aroma of the elegant creation.. The side dishes also conveys that they r also straight from a kitchen of legendary mughlai outlet...ambience makes perfect the whole frame for a memorable tasty treat.
Surely 'the best' biryani in the whole city..
Apart from all the positives,the amount is little low,in both biryani nd side dish...otherwise you can rely on Kareem's for a perfect food experience....

Very poor quality of food..ordered Gelauti kebab which tasted like stale food that too so costly approx 400 rs with tax...my girlfriend started feeling like vomiting after eating it and couldn't have the rest of the food which she ordered..lahori chicken was full of gravy with undercooked chicken it..even a highway dhaba's chicken would taste better than it..mutton biryani was nothing more than colourful rice ..tasteless..never had such tasteless biryani ever..staff are courteous and ambience is nice other than that nothing is good about it.paid around 1650 for two people..will not recommend it to anyone

There is an excellent vibe at Kareem's. The ambiance is top class but somehow I was a little disappointed with their food, hopefully they are better than that. As far as Biryani is concerned, I become judgemental too easily. Biryani has is either perfect or it is bullshit, there is no in between. I was a bit disappointed with their special Tandoori chicken as well. Having said that, I am really looking forward to Kareem's for a second try. I am sure they won't disappoint.

This rating is based totally on their food.
Got bored of kolkata biryani and wanted to try something new. Ordered murgh afghani tandoori , mutton dum gosht biryani and firni.
The tandoori was creamy a bit sweet and tender, a break from the regular ones.
Now coming to the showstopper the Biryani... Loaded with tender mutton pieces, the rice was mildly spiced and comes with a very small aloo. The biryani is light and does not have the typical biryani smell. Overall excellent.
I was disappointed with the firni as i have a sweet tooth and their firni is kind of for the diabetic people.
Service was satisfactory too.

But the mutton dum biriyani was not upto my expecatation. The actual taste the actual smell the actual feel was missing.. Wel there's always scope for improvement.

I had a chance to visit Kareem's today.It had been on my wish list for a long time now.The restaurant really looks grand and has a elegant decor.It is situated just beside 10DS.All the tables are most for a group of 4/6.We were greeted with a smile.Now coming to food we had ordered murgh musallam which is served with extra biriyani rice it seemed.It looked so yummy we couldn't wait to click a picture.But the photo is of the same item served on the plate.We had ordered two naan along with it which was soft as expected.I haven't had such a delicious dish.It was lip smacking yummy.The staff is really courteous.We didn't order biriyani so can't say much about that.We do have plans to visit Kareem's soon to taste their famous biriyani dishes.I highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking forward to have some delicious mughlai dish.

Ordered Corporate Box - Rupees 310 + 18% tax. Box contained chicken kasha, biryani, chicken tikka, raita and phirni. Taste: Okay. Not so great. Biryani: Blasphemously less, more like a single serving spoon quantity and a sorry-piece-of-a-potato or was it? Taste was okay. But not worth the price. Delivery was prompt. But had to shell out another 1000 bucks to order biryani from

We went to kareem's for team lunch on mahalaya. We heard that kababs are really good in kareem's. The interior, staff's behavior is really good. We have ordered several kababs (one platter also) , biriyani and some side dishes. Food was tasty but not extraordinary. I liked the galauti kabab but i had better than this. Biriyani was also good. But as i told it was nothing extraordinary. In kolkata there are lots of places which serves better kababs than this. Only one thing for which i will complain is the service. They took long time to serve our dishes. Everybody in our team didn't get food at the same time. One person had to wait while others were eating. They took wrong order for one dish also. Overall i think it is an average restraurant.

Location : Kareems can be easily located. It is just opposite to the legendary Opium.

Ambience : Perfect for corporate lunch or dinner, although they don't offer any corporate discounts.

Food and drinks :
We wanted to try the non veg kabab platter but the quantity wasn't enough for 6. We settled for muttonburra kabab, chicken peshwari kabab and galauti kabab...both the mutton kababs were lipsmacking, while I wasn't much happy about the chicken kababs.
Then came the humongous Rann Biriyani. Now being a Kolkata Biriyani lover, I had a small fight with my colleagues for calling that a Biriyani which had no flavours of it. It was really good but I would rather tag it as mutton gravy with rice and mutton sheek kabab.

I was really looking forward to Shahi tukda but the restaurant was out of desserts!

Pocket Pinch : if ordered correctly, it's very affordable!

Okay, my humble suggestion - stay away unless you want to take a risk on your patience, stomach and have money to waste. 
Visited with friends a couple of days,back. 
1. No prior booking was accepted though we observed tables tagged as 'booked'. 
2. The waiting specified was 20-25 minutes and after 45 minutes when we bashed them up we were immediately arranged a table and God knows what prevented them from doing that by themselves. 
3. The waiting time for food was very long with multiple follow ups though it was not that crowded. 4. The chicken platter was most ordinary with a few items not soft enough. 
5. The fish was a complete disappointment - not at all fresh and overly fibrous. 6. Every item - chicken platter, fish, tandoori potato, butter chicken, biryani etc seemed to have been cooked in a common orange coloured tandoori gravy with almost the same taste. 7. The biryani was served along with the finger bowl when everybody has finished eating!  8. Even the drinking water was not replenished...and there were no knives  in the cutlery. 9. We asked for empty/extra bowls and they were served after 2-3 reminders when the roti and the food to eat have already ceased to be hot. 10. No single waiter was assigned in spite of we being a single table of 9 people.  
11. Completely dissatisfied when we summoned the Manager - someone disguised as the Manager was sent (which we overheard - that a lady employee told one of the persons - that 'you go and say that you are the manager'!).  
12. Worst - most everyone suffered from indigestion typical of semi cooked, over spicy food.  

Overall - a very bad experience with a very steep pricing.  
Food, service, price performance - none are at all up to the mark.  

The decor and ambience - okay (with odd non-matching upholstery though) but I guess people visit restaurants to enjoy the food and a professional service with decent pricing. It scores poor in all these aspects.

Reached half an hour early before they opened at 7 and waited outside. Totally worth it.

This is beside TDS in the PS Srijan Tech Park. Average interiors and seating. Nice, hospitable and courteous staff.

We ordered the Gosht Barra Chaap first, the server suggested it. And it was sooo good. I've seldom had mutton ribs so soft and well-cooked. And so tasty. It was perfect. Three ribs in a plate.

Also, Mutton Biriyani, cheese garlic naan and Gosht Karachi. The last one was so good, we didn't leave a drop of gravy on the plate. And the raita too.
My only regret is I didn't come here sooner.

Highly recommended.

The staff is also well trained and are always there to serve you.The washroom is also very clean.The ambience is great for families so next time you want to take your family out try Kareem's.

Food in Kareem's tasted really good; but it was the service that impressed me. Want to share a previous experience here! Last time when I visited Kareem's, I was pretty unwell with a splitting headache. One of the service guys Subhajit went out of the way and got medicines for me from an outside shop. I was touched to say the least. Probably it is this comforting gesture which prompted me to come back to Kareem's and no wonder that the ghosht keema biryani and the sia murg mirch tasted so gooooood! Thank you Subhajit!

Ambiance wise-medium.
Food quality- Awesome
Taste- Nice
Price- A little bit expensive, approx.1600 rs for 2 ppl
Staff- courteous and professional
We had murgh biryani and gosht biryani, murgh platter, Lahori chicken, murgh potli kabab(special one which we liked most) and chicken kebabs. Give a try for kareem's raan biryani.
We loved the food here.

Kareem's, the newly opened North Indian cuisine restaurant in sector 5 -salt lake, is the perfect place for the food lovers.
The lighting n the decor sets up the perfect mood for a conversation over the meal. Have to mention the decor looks royal.
Coming to the food part, they have redefined Northern Indian Cuisine. The food looks yummy and not just that, it  tastes delicious too.
For starters we had
1. Murg tangdi kulfi kebab
2. Gosht nalli barra kebab
3. Gosht barra chap
The kulfi kebab is the winner, served with lots of cheese in a foil wrap. The two gosht kebabs were completely different from each other n both of them taste amazing but the nalli barra kebab gets my vote. The gosht kebabs were very juicy n soft.
For main course we had Raan masala n garlic nun. Although the meat was nice juicy n soft, the dish itself was not as tasty as the starters were. It was a bit let down. In short it tasted more like home cooked mutton curry. It was not bad but it was not upto the standard. The portion of meat that was served would require 4-5 ppl to finish it. The garlic nun was just fine.
For desert we ordered Shahi Tukda. It was not out of the world but i couldn't keep my hands off it, it was yummy.
The staff were very polite n helpful n will give u enough space to have a quality time.
Will go back again to try the Raan tandoori this time.
Will give 4.5 stars for their price, the portion of food they serve, the taste they deliver and the decor.

I wish i could give this place a negative rating...
Note that my review is only for veg food served here.

The food was atrocious! I've hardly tasted anything worse than this. Had ordered tandoori paneer tikka n veg seekh kabab as starters. Both were okayish. The tomato shorba was yucks. In the main course, we ordered paneer lahori n dal makhani. Oh god! I've never tasted such an utterly revolting dish. Both tasted bad. Kulcha isn't served here so we settled for naan. The naan was soggy. On complaining, we were told "naan aisa hi hota hai". The veg biryani was again okayish n nothing "special" as i had heard. The worse was reserved for the last. The papad was disgusting. It was stale n had no taste.

The waiters here need proper training. One of them knew only bengali n seemed drunk. Unprofessional clueless waiters. Even a simple shorba was served after 30-40 minutes.

Well this is again one of those places which was nicely decorated with comfy seats n good lighting. But the main focus of a restaurant should be its food.
I think the non veg food served here must be good as the other guests were only ordering non veg food n seemed to be relishing it
I really wish kareem's would remove veg dishes from their menu n not mislead us into thinking it serves good quality vegetarian food

Great place. Great food. I took the cucumber cooler. Then we ordered the Kareem's special murg tandoori & peshawari kebab for starters. Soft juicy flavourful chicken. 
For main course we ordered the Rann Biriyani which was very tasty again! Enough for 6 people! Lamb and rice cooked to perfection.
My friend ordered the firni which was smoother than normal firni and said it was great too!

Just that service is a bit slow they could improve on that.

Not Up to the mark…

I was supposed to go to BBQ. It was full & in waiting. As I was in hurry , I gone to Karim’s. Hospitality was good to start with.

But service is really poor. Took 40 minutes for starter ☹. Can you believe this .. 

Tandoor was not up to the mark. Briyani was not at all good. Whereas they are charging very high price ..

Pathetic experience . I will never ever visit this restaurant again ..

Location of this restaurant is excellent...this place can be considered as the food street of sector V, Salt Lake...Kareem's is in the ground floor of Srijan Park building with an imposing facade. 
Car parking is not an issue. Staff are very cordial and will help you in taking decisions. We ordered fresh lime, virgin mojito and soda sikanji to cool ourselves...however none of these drinks were up to the mark. They lacked fizz and energy..better to avoid. 
As starters we opted for veg platter and Afghani tandoori murgh. The veg platter consisted of 18.  assorted pieces of paneer, mushroom, cauliflower florets, baby corn, potato, etc. It provided variety and was quite impressive, especially the mushrooms. The tandoori murgh was roasted perfectly. Moist, generously coated with Rich cream and cheese based marinade. The meat was melt in mouth and worth every penny.
Both mutton and chicken dum biryani as main course were a let down. The dishes tasted same, only difference was in the presence of chicken or mutton pieces. Blindfolded you won't be able to distinguish. There was no dumpukht flavor...it appeared dum was only in the menu not in the dish. The mutton pieces were not as tender as it should have been. It was difficult to severe the meat from the bone...not the signature of a perfect biryani.
Chicken khurchan and bekti Tikka masala as sides we're good choices, the former being the better amongst two. Bekti Tikka masala was wee bit too masaledar...
Mango delight and malai firni was our dessert options. Firni tasted good but contained lumps! Bad....very bad.....

Food was very good but biryani was not according my taste. Not their fault though, I just like the kolkata biryani. I absolutely loved the potli kebab and gosht nihari. Finished with malai firni . A very nice experience all in all.

The new biriyani place that serves in Lucknow style. Food is genuinely amazing, I loved the quality of biriyani, not oily, not very rich yet with the perfect taste. The side dishes were delicious too.
I loved the Interiors as well, worth mentioning.
I would have given rating 5 but, they couldn't give us what we wanted saying it was over I deduct marks there. A biriyani place running short of biriyani dish, not cool.

Kareematic!

Our long awaited target to have a lunch here was at last met with nice food and good service. Their signature Murgh biriyani tastes really succulent with spices layering the rice. The chicken pieces are however smaller and scattered throughout instead of being prominently visible... Their Murgh Hara Masala is another sensation. Greenery is always good. Taftan - a sweet fluffy tandoori bread item is another must have. Bhekti Zafrani wasn't bad either. Their only drawback is a long service time which is why we were getting a bit impatient ans got discouraged from ordering their dessert. But we have surely kept it for another day.

The place has got a nice cosy ambience with good seating arrangement. The staffs were courteous enough. Too bad it doesnt have a parking of its own.
Coming to the food...the kabas were very good, the murgh side dish was okayish, however the dum biriyani was different and delicious. Didnt try the desserts though, would love to try it the next time soon.
Overall a must visit for tandoor/indian food lovers.

Visited this place for a biriyani lunch. Yeah it's nice.They don't serve typical kolkata biriyani but whatever they serve that's mouthwatering. 4 large piece of chicken with rice . Raita was not so tasty .
Ohh..I want to mention one thing about the seats . Not so much comfortable space is less.

We figured out Kareem's on Zomato and since my husband heard the name before while he was staing in NCR , he insisted we order from here. It was almost 9 30 when i called up to enquire if they can get the order home delivered. Since they were running out of staffs , they requested if we can pick it up . My husband agreed and and in next 15 mins we were on our way. Its located in a corporate vicinity of Sec 5 , Kol . The moment we went it , the ambiance did lit up the mood. The place is segregated into two floors, Ground and first ( though im not sure if they have separate - private dining area upstairs ). 

We ordered Ghost nalli bara Chap for starters ( Marinated Lamb Ribs) and Tandoori roti and Ghost Nihari .

We took the parcel home and enjoyed the meal.

The starter was beautifully done & it melted in the mouth and had the right balance of spices and curd.  

The rotis were tender and so were the mutton pieces ( they serve you generous portions of Mutton pieces).

Its been a lovely experience and i would surely visit again to Dine In!

First visit to Kareem's. Ordered Paya shorba, Gosht barra chap, Murgh peshwari tikka, Gosht dum biriyani and Murgh lahori. Somehow, nothing tasted WOW except barra chap.
Ambience and service are good. Staff are very friendly and courteous.
Dinner for 2 cost 2K with tax.

I will not at all recommend this restaurant to anybody . The food taste is so so . Nothing special . The horrible thing is their service . I found one strand of hair in the gosht curry and I gave them the plate to replace . They simply took my plate and gave me a finger bowl as If I am done with the main course . They did not even bother to say sorry about these things and replace my plate . We were total 120people and it was my treat . Due to all these nuisances I was ashamed ..I felt disgusted !!

Also the serving time is huge . So make sure you order everything at once to get all the items in time .

A lot has been said about the fact that this is not Delhi's iconic Karim's, but Mumbai's Kareems and blah blah... The fact is that they are churning out some stunning dishes.... and are certainly a breath of fresh air in the congested Mughlai food arena in our city. The ambience is grand, the service matches the ambience. We ordered Gosht Nalli Barra Kebab and Murgh Tangdi Kufi Kebab for starters. The Barra kebab was just awesome....the meat was so juicy and so tender that it literally fell of the bone. The kulfi kebab was a revelation for cheese lovers like me.... a piece of chicken leg rolling in hot molten cheese... what more could I want? In a nutshell the kebabs were heavenly.
For mains we ordered Gosht Dum Biryani and Murgh Dum Biryani and two butter rotis. For sides we ordered Murgh Lahori, Gosht Karachi and Murgh Dahiwala. The Biryanis were different, not the traditional Kolkata Biryani that we are used to. None the less the Biryanis tasted good and the difference was endearing. The Murgh Lahori was a special item, but the star of the show was the Gosht Karachi. The Gosht Karachi was simply put, a stunner.... not very spicy but the taste was exhilarating. The Murgh Dahiwala was standard and the Butter rotis were neatly done. The icing on the cake was the Malai Firni.... one of the best that I have tasted and certainly it can become one of the best versions of the age old firni in the near future. The Shahi Tukda was good too.
An experience that has made me more curious about the stuff that I have not tasted. They have infused something new into the age old menu of Mughlai dishes, a variety not much seen, and that too, of high quality. That is what makes it much more exciting. Coming back is not an option but a compulsion.

The decor was very pretty. Specially the reception area with luxurious sofas and a grand mirror. It looked 'nawabi'. You can see the kitchen from the dining area, which I like because I can be sure that it's clean. 

Coming to the food. We went late so they only had limited items left, but I still loved the kebab(murgh Afghani). The biriyani is different from Kolkata biriyani, it's made in the Awadhi or Lucknowi style. But I kinda liked it too. 
Butter naan was very ordinary. 
Chicken Lahori was very tasty(recommended). 
Chicken Sia Mirch was not so good. 
We took two mojitos(orange and watermelon). Both were very refreshing and good in taste. Though I would like them to include Pinacolada in their menu.
Shahi Tukra and Malai firni were both nice, not too sweet. 

Price is also reasonable. Bill was about 3k for 6 of us and we were more than full. 

But all these aside, what is commendable is their service. We went at an hour when they had closed the entry, but they allowed us anyway. I had a friend with a broken foot and he was given special treatment and made comfortable. They were also very patient while taking the order because my friends are quite indecisive. The manager and every other staff put all their effort, in spite the fact that for us they had to serve an extra hour and couldn't have their lunch. And this is precisely why I am giving them a 5 star rating and not a 4.5 which I otherwise would've. I really appreciate the service you provided.

Kareem's is a very big brand in case of mughlai.
First time in our city 
So. oviously it was in my bucket list.
I made it yesterday.
We ,two went for dinner
In starter we had chiken kulfi kebab
Then we took butter nun nd chiken Lahori
Both are equally good 
Then the desert came Shai tudkra
Either my choice is bad or they made it horrible
Price rate is ok ok type.

Visited on 30.8.17, a Wednesday for lunch. We sat at the ground floor. Ordered the famous 1. chicken potli kebab ( the chicken fillet that was used for making the potli of chicken mince seemed dry. The stuffing of chicken mince tasted quite nice and the size of each potli kebab was huge. They served four in a plate), 2. Mutton karachi ( spicy and oily in a bhuna onion gravy. Very rich and unhealthy and extremely tasty) 3. Cheese and garlic naan ( the portion size was more than adequate , the naan was cut into 3 big pieces but it was not what I expected... It was charred at the bottom which also made it taste bitter at times, paper thin and crisp like papad at certain places, but the aroma of garlic was nice and there was abundant cheese), 4. Veg pulao (The best veg pulao I have had in a restaurant. Great aroma and beautifully cooked rice)
On my 2nd visit (17.9.17 Sunday for lunch) we ordered Kareem special murg Afghani tandoori kebab , gosht nalli barra kebab, Murg Lahori and cheese garlic naan. All of them were delicious especially the nalli kebab.

Popped in for quick lunch,sad to see a big name like Kareem's couldn't provide their special dish mutton biriani at lunchtime.
Settled for keema biriani as wanted to try it. It was very avg,too much spices and less biriani flavor more like keema polau or something.
The soda shikhanji was good.
And then the saahi tukda was good. Dnt knw if i wl come here again. Disappointed with the biriani

They  arranged everything so well for her and did everything according to us. And yes, when it comes to food. Veg stuffs was not that good in taste. But the chef's special dishes are damn good!

Since Kareem's opened its first outlet in Kolkata all kebeb lovers have put it on their checklist. So last Friday we thought of giving it a visit. Located just beside 10 downing Street, its decoration have a royal touch and upholstery is mainly in blue color which is very soothing for our eyes. 
We ordered watermelon mojito and pineapple cooler to quench our thirst. Coming to food, we took murgh potli kebab and murgh tangri kulfi kebab as per recommendation. The kebabs took a little bit of time but murgh potli kebab- chicken breast stuffed with Keema,dry fruits was worth a try. Tangri kulfi kebab was a bit overwhelming, cream cheese and chicken combination didn't impress me much. In main course we took butter naan and gosht nihari. Naan was soft and the gosht dish was just perfect to the t. Mutton was soft and juicy and curry was perfectly spiced. Though we did not have much space for dessert, we just couldn't miss the much famous malai phirni. It was the best I had had till date as it had a creamy texture unlike others. 
Though the food and service was not that grand, bill compensated for that. Jokes apart, price is on a higher side which didn't end the experience on a sweet note. 
Overall experience
Ambience- 4/5
Food - 3.5/5
Service- 3.5/5

We ordered food for team lunch. Firstly the packaging was horrible, the boxes were already leaking. The starter, butter garlic mushroom had no salt, it was just bland. The lahsooni murgh was ordinary. The paneer tikka masala had tons of oil. And the murgh khurshan was again very ordinary. Also the delivery was late. The only good thing was their firni. All in all, a bad experience.

Sometimes all you need is good flavours for change in the same old Mughal dishes and Kareem's serves that to you. Eye and throat refreshing mocktails, cheese naan was a twist along with the butter naan. Murgh peshwari tikka for starters and Gosht Karachi for main course along with Gosht dum biriyani-kareem's special is heart winning. Also a warm and cosy place with lovely decor and sober ambience.

We went for a office party with around 15-20 people and we ordered only biriyani for each they took 1 hour to serve our order. After 1 hour they were serving 3 plates biriyani then taking a break of 15 mins and then again 3 like this it went. We could not njoy our food together. And they also dont take prior booking for a larger group, they have first come first serve policy which is not good if we plan something for a get together. Now regarding the quality of the food, quantity was not suffucient compared to the price they charge, biriyani was full of ghee and the paneer biriyani tastes better than the non veg biriyani. They serve hydrabadi biriyani. Overall not happy with the service or the food.

As they say, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Although I ain't a man, the saying pretty much holds true for me. Had my birthday this month and friends, as all friends are, got on my case for a birthday treat. I volunteered to oblige them and one fine friday night we found ourselves on the doorstep of Kareem's (some doorway it was!). We were a group of 5 and the Maître D' found us a comfortable place to sit in. The menu was brought in and we  decide on Chicken potli kebab, mutton seekh kebab, Chicken biryani, Bhurani and sweet lime sodas. We chatted, laughed, posed and selfied our way through the wait time and by the time food was brought in we were practically growling with hunger. 

Potli Kebab: It was divine! Chicken balls with chicken keema inside served with a side of onions mixed with spices, I mean the aroma alone was enough to ensnare me and the taste and how it melted in your mouth, almost like poetry.
Gosht Seekh kebab: It was good. The mutton was evenly cooked and mixed well with the spices.

Biryani: Was the wild card. Most people have said they don't like kareem's biryani. Well most people like their biryani a bit greasy and on the heavier side of spices but me on the other hand like to eat biryani avoiding to queue up infront of the toilet OR NOT. So for someone like me it was GREAT. It was light, the chicken was succulent and tender and juicy. It had a distinctive taste and came with the prized aloo too(thank god for that)!

Bhurani Raita: It was great too. The curd was fresh,  not too sweet not too tangy. Had a hint of hing(dark horse) it could have backfired, but fortunately didn't and gave the bhurani a different identity. It teamed really well with the Biriyani.
Sweet Lime Soda: It was your average, run-of-the-mill drink that just does the job of washing down food and it served its purpose well.

All being said, why did I fall short of giving the .5 on the ratings? I will tell you why. Though the kebabs are bang on here and other foods worth remembering, what they lack is the ambience or the atmosphere. A fine dining place like kareem's and you expect the ambience to fit the bill but it just falls short.
That tiny glitch apart, I would love to visit the place again and this time I am gonna devour the desserts which we couldn't in our this visit (filled upto our throats with food).

When you see a fave of all restaurant in your hometown,that too at a stone's throw away, you consider binge eating. So we ordered some doodhi halwa and a veg biryani...hoping for the best stuff as we had in Mumbai or Delhi. Alas, disappointed we were... The halwa was good but the quantity was too less..the  biryani was equally bad but had a huge amount enough for two people.the biryani was bad since there were dust or stone particles in it . It just hits your taste buds at the wrong time...The salt was on the lesser side too. The raita was OK  but the quantity was on the lesser side ..overall not something that I had hoped of, from  kareem's..I'll give them a try again...probably visit in person

After scourging some rave reviews on Zomato, zeroed down to this place for my birthday treat. I fell in love with the ambience, which is is quite extravagant. Moving to the food bit, unfortunately missed out its popular Potli kebab. The reshmi kebab and Tandoori Beckti, along with Cheese Garlic Nun was delectable though. The Gosht Dum Biryani could have been a bit succulent. However, the show stoppers were Gosht Karachi and Gosht Nehari. The tender mutton chunks melted inside mouth sipped in the aroma of spices. I would recommend Kareem's to all my fellow meat enthusiast comrades...

Food is very average. Management and service is pathetic. Interior decoration and ambience is good. They have a tendency to serve wrong items instead of your order. So please verify before they serve your order on your plate. Never going. Cost is higher than renowed biryani, kabab restuarant in city; but wont dig a hole in your pocket.

After reading all the reviews we opted this place for my dad's birthday but i was disappointed with the place. Firstly they took the wrong order that was given to them for starters and for the main course when we ordered chicken biryani in which  we got burnt chicken. The rating is only for chicken lahori and chicken lasuni. Although the staff are courteous but the service is really not good.

All were great to have, especially the fish item, tandoori bhetki. There was a bit of sourness in the veg platter and the gosht in the biryani wasn't cooked properly. Aside these deficiencies, the food and overall experience at Kareem's was superb.

You are ought to fall in love with this place once you taste the murgh potli kabab!! Just situated in RDB Boulevard, this place is just the right dine in for the Sector 5 office goers and young college kids! It's priced a little above average but it's worth it! 

Every food has an intense taste. They garnish it really well so you will love to snap pictures o the dishes! The Biriyani wasn't much remarkable it just tasted so-so. Other main course dishes o mutton n Chicken were simply "Lajawaab". Don't miss the Tandoori guys.. 

The only complain I've got is their service! They serve you real slow. We went in on a weekday at the peak lunch hour. They took almost 30 min to serve us! Senior members of the family were almost agitated. So I would request you to work on that. Rest is perfect!

This restaurant is located in prime location of sector 5 just beside 10 DS and opposite of barbeque nation. It was on my list since when it opened. So we decided to give it a try for Friday lunch. We ordered -
Murgh potli kebab - these are chicken kebab which has minced chicken stuffed in it. It was just awesome. It was soft and taste was very good.
For main course we ordered butter nun and plain nun. Nun was soft. With that we tried gosht Karachi. The dish had 4 good pieces of mutton and it tasted heavenly. 
We had sahi tukda for the dessert. It was also nice.
All in all we had good time in Kareem's.

Ask them what they can serve on the list and have a bite, it's gonna be great. Waiting time is a bit streched because of the crowd falling in. Please have a visit for their Ran Masala(only when u have foodies with u bcoz it's huge), Nali nihari, Dum ki chaap,  Biriyani is great and if u want ur bread to be spicy then call for cheese chilli naan or else they serve all kinds in breads so just get in and grab some. I bet you will love them

Kareems's proved to be one of the best restaurants among mughlai foodie lovers. Its been in my wishlist for long. Now a days it is a hyped one. Located at the prime point of Saltlake, Sector 5 just beside 10 Downing Street.
Went to Kareem's on 15th August, 2017 for lunch. And it was really crowded. It is perfect for any ocassion. Whether it be a romantic date or family lunch or hangout with friends or for office party. Perfect for all!!

AMBIENCE is really classy. Wall decor, sofas are really gorgeous. Perfect for selfie lovers and posers like me 😜.

STAFFS are well mannered and help you in ordering the foods. They will guide you for the exact amount required. Liked their honesty.

FOODS****

●MURGH MUSSALLAM (HALF) for mains. It was heavenly. Grilled large pieces of tandoori chicken with spicy buttered gravy served on a bed of pulao alongwith boiled egg slices. The chicken was so soft and tender and juicy. I just cant express it in words. A must have! You do not need any side dish for this dish. Its more than enough by its own. Sufficient for 2. (5/5)
Now the dessert. Heard a lot about Kareem's dessert specialities. The attendant suggested to go for their MALAI FIRNI and CARAMEL CUSTARD.

●MALAI FIRNI was so yummilicious. The upper crust was so creamy and that buttery taste was perfect. It was topped with pistachio. (5/5). You just cant resist yourself to have another one!

●CARAMEL CUSTARD- Nice soft creamy custard served on a bed of chocolate sauce. The v.first bite made blast all over my mouth. So v.good. Its like silk. As if it just melts into my mouth. The chocolate sauce complimented the custard so well. Just like magic. (5/5)
Our total bill was 755 bucks. V.reasonable in comparison with the quality and quantity.
In true words each preparation was unique. Must try for foodies. Yes it will surely keep you fasciniated all over the day. Very much impressed.

I loved my dinner date at Kareem's.

The ambiance is very cozy. You can bring your family here.

The service is worth mentioning.The waiters are well trained and polite.

We ordered:

1. Panner lababdar- very good.Not too heavy neither too spicy.
2.Rumali roti/Butter naan : The rumali roti here was a slightly thicker than the ones I have had at other places.But I liked it.It wasn't becoming tough.Butter Naan was pretty much a standard naan.

3.Caramel Custard : HEAVENLY !This is a must try for me,if you come to Kareem's. 
4.sweet lassi- Good one! 
By mistake we  ordered  `MATAR  PULAO, but order taken back as soon, we pointed our Cancellation. 
I would definitely revisit.

I loved my dinner date at Kareem's.
The ambiance is very cozy. You can bring your family here.
The service is worth mentioning.The waiters are well trained and polite.We had to wait a little for the starters ,but that's okay! I don't mind waiting that much.
We ordered:
1.Murg tangri kulfi : It was heavenly! The cheese was overwhelming though! But overall a very tasty dish if you are a cheese lover.
2.Rumali roti/Butter naan : The rumali roti here was a slightly thicker than the ones I have had at other places.But I liked it.It wasn't becoming tough.Butter Naan was pretty much a standard naan.
3.Ghost Karachi : Loved the flavor of this dish.Ghost was nicely cooked.
4.Watermelon Mojito : A well made sweet drink.
5.Malai Phirni : This is a must try for me,if you come to Kareem's.

I would definitely revisit.

Good but can be much much better .
Tandoori pomfret was tasting great but was really disappointed with Tandoori chicken as it was topped up with cream ,so it became soggy it needs to be crispy and should have that aroma of tandoor.
Dal tastes excellent. 
But looking forward to visit again

I'm a big fan of mughlai dishes. Kareem's is one of  favorites. Firstly the ambience is beautiful. Foods are awesome to taste.Specially Potli Kabab,mutton run biriyani, murgh Mussallam,malai firni etc.Last but not the least all staffs are very cooperative and they welcomed us warmly.
I will surely visit there again and recommend everyone to visit there.

Went with a group of colleagues and ordered raang biriyani with some starters. The serving was enormous and good enough for at least 7. The best part of the mutton biriyani: the meat was extremely soft and food is delicious.

After back to back disappointing visits restaurants serving pathetic food this place came to rescue. This place was on my bookmark since quite a long time.
Wasn't that hungry so couldn't try much but whatever we ate left us gastromicaly satisfied. Thanks kareems for ending the curse of me visiting pathetic restaurants.
For starters we wanted to have something related to to cheese so the server suggested us Chicken Tangdi Kulfi kebab. It is the 3rd best kebab I have ever eaten. 1st is Karim's JAMA masjid Delhi , 2nd cheese kebab from India khiderpore. It was lip-smackingly good.
For mains we had chicken dum biryani it was very tasty n quite different from the traditional kolkata style biryani but it had a potato which quite surprised me as I wasn't expecting it.
We then straight moved on to dessert. We had sahi tukda and malai phirni. Sahi tukda was class apart very yum. Phirni was good I already have had phirni at India restaurant khiderpore so I didn't find kareems one better than that. Phirni was priced at 110rs taxes extra one can have 2 of them at India restaurant for the same price n get better taste.

Starters were not really good. The chicken had no taste, was over spiced to hide the stale smell. Mutton chap fry was a tad better. Biriyani was average at max. Side dish Chicken Akbari was good, though it was nothing but average chicken chaap with cheese and a bit of charcoal odor. The staff were very courteous. Ambience was good.

After a long wait finally gave this place a visit. Among all the other Mughlai cuisine restaurants this tops my list now. Starting from the food to the service, I have never come across such gentle and courteous staff. They took care of everything right from the beginning till the end. The food was delicious and the best Mughlai that I've ever had.. Murgh Akbari, a main course, with drumsticks in tomato gravy, was worth having. Mughlai always seems to be quite monotonous and boring for some but this place is not for disappointment. A very good place with a pocket friendly and sumptuous menu! 
Hope to visit soon again :)
Thank you Team Kareem's and a special thanks to all the staffs who stood by our side every now and then! :)

There is no need of side dish for this biriyani though we ordered Gosht karachi which was also delicious..  And yes kebabs were also awesome.. if u are biriyani lover u should definitely try here and u should order raan biriyani which'll make your day perfect..☺

   We had Dum murgh biryanis, murgh kebbab platter, Shahi Tukda, bhetki jafrani.
    Best Mughlai restaurant in Kolkata.

The service is excellent with a pretty short order to serve cycle. 5/5
We had ordered Murgh Potli Kabab and Gosht Dum Boti Kabab as starters which had 4 and 6 pieces respectively in a plate. Some pieces of Gosht Dum Boti Kabab were a bit hard to chew but the taste was very good. Murgh Potli Kabab is delicious and stomach filling too. This is the one to try. As for main course we had Gosht Dum Biryani Kareem's special and Murgh Tikka Masala. I did not like the Biryani much but Murgh Tikka Masala was awesome. The chicken pieces were tender and would have been an ideal complement to butter nan. So for me food would be 4/5.

No matter how good u tout ur food is but if  you serve fermented food to your customers there is something serious problem. Their service time is an another issue.

We ordered.. water iced tea and fresh lime soda for beverage
chicken potli kabab ( a great invention we all absolutely loved this one and it's a must try)
Chicken malai kabab ( again great one)
Naan
Chicken dum biriyani ( I dont like this North Indian style biriyani but all others loved this one)
Mutton Karachi( good but not something great you can opt for other dish rather)
Our bill was around rs2200 which is pretty reasonable for four I think.
Quite friendly and good staff
I forgot to click all pics basically sorry for that..in the images there are both the kababs and mutton karachi

In recent few months, Kareem's have managed to become the hot topic of interest for innumerable mughlai lovers of the city. Located at sector v, this is a true food paradise for Indian specially mughlai cuisine. Visited the restaurant couple of times and each time my experience have just got better. Starting off with the items, chiken potli and chixken charga is a must try. The mutton lahori and chicken butter masala have the proper authentic taste and you won't be disappointed ordering it. A perfect restaurant and worth giving a try if you are bored with same old arsalan and aminia.

One thing on my wish list from this place is their biryani, really need to try that as soon as possible. Quality wise my gosht chaap was awesome & the Indian breads were decent.

We ordered murgh hari mirch kebab, murgh tikka biryani and shahi tukra. Needless to say all the items were too good. The biryani quantity is enough for two and had 6 pieces of chicken tikka. The shahi tukra was mindblowing and is enough for 2 people.

We ordered Ghosth Galuti Kebab and belive me its awesome, it was melting in my mouth....Just one suggestion do serve it with more salads. Then we moved on to main course unfortunately biriyani was finished so we have to order for some gravy nd roti, so we ordered Karachi Gosth with butter nan nd lacha parantha. Mutton was cooked very well and the taste was too gud. Next time will surely visit to have Biriyani.

Straight from Dubai to the IT hub of the city of joy.Heart of the city would definitely have served as a better spot for the gourmet experience of Kareem's.But once you get there you won't mind the journey.Classy decor will catch your attention at the first place.Then savour their mouth watering kababs to start with.Galauti kabab is simply great & it melts in your mouth.Kareem's gosht dum biriyani teamed up with Gosht Karachi will transform you into a different zone.Sign it off with creamy Firni & come home with a beautiful aftertaste.Experience Kareem's to get fascinated.

Under the influence of it's famous namesake in Delhi, a foodie ought to visit this place. Ordered Kali Mirch kebab, chicken akbari and butter naan. You don't see much use of cheese in a Mughal dish, but chicken akbari has it. With naan, it forms a good partnership. And I recommend people to have SAHI TUKRA as dessert, makes the icing on cake.

Located @SectorV, Salt Lake just diagonally opposite to RDM Boulevard inside the Srijan Tech Park Complex (just beside 10, Downing Street) - the renowed Kebab chain of restaurant - Kareem's. This outlet is the franchisee of the Mumbai  joint.
 
Visited this place twice for lunch but somehow the Gawlati kebab didn't meet my expectation during second visit.

Tried Chicken Potli kebab and Gawlati Kebab as starter followed by  Ghost Biriyani ,in the main course and finally malai phirni and sahi tukra to fulfill the crave for sweet tooth desire.

Chicken Potli kebab (thin crust of boneless chicken wrapped with spiced chicken keema) and malai phirni were the unique items, just out of the world - would recommend the kebab lovers to try this.

Coming to ambience, the restaurant is spacious and well decorated with Morocco style lightning theme and vast ceiling decor.  

Service was quick and the staffs were courteous to the guests. Rates are okish and balances with the good food quality.

The first things that I noticed after getting inside, were the decor and ambience. The posh lounge reminded me of Nawabi gharana where as the dining area was a perfect balance of the contemporary and modernism. Since I was alone I ordered for the main course without sneak peeking into the starter. And need less to say I ordered for mutton dum biriyani which is my all time favourite whenever I head to a north Indian restaurant. The quantity was huge and I really had a tough time to finish my meal. But I wasn't satisfied with the quality of the food. It was too spicy for my pallet and the mutton pieces were hard. When the menu said "dum", my expectation was melt in the mouth flavourful mutton pieces making merry with fragrant rice with minimum masalas. But what I was served wasn't up to the mark and found over priced. For me, the positive side was the cordial behaviour of the staffs and the interior.

Went to this restaurant with lots of expectations but had disappointing experience. Though the ambiance is very posh and serving staffs are cordial but didn't like the food at all. Tried only kababs, didn't have the interest to indulge in main course after having very ordinary kababs- galawti kabab, tandoori vetki & their signature murg potli kabab- all of them were very ordinary.. I have had better kababs than this in many places in kolkata..Galawti did,t have that melt in the mouth feeling, it was very coarse in twxture and it had smell of fish!! Vetki was tasteless, hard, smelly, didn't seem like genuine vetki, potli was cheese & cream mixed keema within thin chicken breast wrapping-it was nothing special also . the only thing here we loved was the soda shikanji.. Its definitely costly but the quality and quantity of food doesn't justify the high pricing. Not comparable with the delhi outlet at all..

However as I entered the place my mood changed because of the Sober ambience. Felt like a truly Fine Dinning Biryani Place...probably the first of its kind in Kolkata.
For the Food , we ordered Chicken Potli Kebab , Mutton Ribs Chaap kebab , Murg Biriyani and Sahi Phirni.
Really liked the Kebabs. Very unique in taste and wholesome .
Though i am little biased about Kolkata Biriyani...still liked Kareem's Biriyani .All should try.
The staffs were extremely courteous.

6. Malai Firni

Place is located in PS srijan tech park( nearby RDB).
Starters and Main course both were very nice. Two of our friends are vegetarian and they were even amazed by the paneer served by Kareem's which you even don't find in good veg restaurants.

Nice place to have Dinner.

This place is just 5 mins walkable distance from my workplace. So we decided this as the venue of my colleague's birthday party celebration. The first look and feel was impressive, as we moved in. We ordered murgh potli kabab, murgh lasuni tikka, ghost dum biriani,chicken karachi, polao and mojito. All of them was outstanding. The flavour, taste, serving was so good. We asked them to serve the birthday cake in plate and they did it so nicely. The service was commendable. I will visit this place again in future for sure. Happy foodie.  😊😊

The food is not so good. We ordered Murgh Potli Kabab and Pakhunti kabab. Both are over-priced but taste wise not so good. To add a cherry on top of it; the food contained hairs. We asked them to change it; next kebab came after 30 minutes. Biriyanis [both Mutton and Chicken] are not good as well; smelling mint like hell. Who on Earth will eat that in Kolkata when you have Arsalan or Kabuliwala.
Service is poor and mistakes kept repeating..They don't have corporate discounts as well.
I would suggest my friends to look out for other eatery because there's plenty of them.
Sorry 1/5 only....

More than often, the work of a food critic is easy. We judge what has been laid out in front of us but often forget about the hard work put in by not only the chef but the staff and the owners to put together, what we call a Fine Dining experience for you as a customer.
This was one of those moments. I have visited this place twice for food and definitely look forward to doing so again because of the beautiful combination of mouth watering dishes, courteous staff and decent service. 

The dishes tasted: Chicken Tangdi Kulfi, Chicken Potli kebab, Mutton Barra Kebab, Tandoori Pomfret, Bhetki Tandoori, Yellow Dal, Cheese garlic Naan, Roomali Roti, Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Biriyani, Mutton Karachi, Firni, Doodhi halwa

Dishes recommended: Chicken Tangdi Kulfi, Chicken Potli kebab, Tandoori Pomfret, Bhetki Tandoori, Cheese garlic Naan, Roomali Roti, Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Biriyani, Mutton Biriyani, Firni, Doodhi halwa

If you do not want to go wrong or cannot try much, I simply recommend you to go for their kebabs. They are delectable in taste and very carefully prepared as they should. I can confidently vote this as the best kebab in town !

But don't miss the the creamy malai Firni or the Rich Doodhi halwa !

Let me know your thoughts readers. 

P.S. I was hungry. So managed to take pictures of only two dishes. (Potli kebab and Reshmi chicken tikka)

Kareem's is definitely the go to restaurant if you are looking for an authentic Mughlai experience.
As you enter the huge gate, the royal interior decor and ambience adds some real Mughal feel to your dining experience.
Coming to the menu, there is a plethora of options to choose from. In starter we tried Gosht Dum Boti Kebab- my favourite Kareem's dish, the Murgh Malai Tikka was very succulent and one of the best in town, Galauti Kebab was very soft and packed with flavors. For mains, we tried Murgh Mussallam which was incredible! The sweet, buttery and spicy Butter Chicken went perfectly with Garlic Naan and Taftan. We couldn't miss Gosht Dum Biriyani- "Kareem's special"- the quantity was sufficient for 2 persons and really very tasty.
Caramel Custard- All well that ends well. Yes, the rich caramel sauce and smooth textured custard was the perfect dish to end with. .
Overall a grand dining experience making you feeling like an emperor.

If you're looking for a cozy, warm and memorable meal you should definitely head to Kareem's. Their kebabs are delicious and juicy, one of the best and most unique biriyanis in town, their portions are perfect, and the best part, its easy on your pocket. Don't be mislead by the extravagance of the place. Their rates are quite reasonable, and their service is even better. They guide you perfectly well with the menu and the whole process is seamless and beautiful! Going back there very soon!

The city of Kolkata woke up to a deluge of rain with flodding streets and somber mood. We had to do something to stop the day going for a waste. What could be better than a gastronomic trip to uplift the mood. So we decided to visit Kareem's for lunch. This is a relatively new  restaurant in Sector V at Salt Lake. 

We ordered for Tamatar Dhania Shorba, Gosht Dum Biryani, Murgh Musallam, Potli Kebab and Garlic Bread and Chaas to wash the food down. 

The waiting time was not over 10 minutes. Out of all that we ordered the Potli Kebab was out of this world. I confess that I don't remember having such delicious Kebab ever. It was a delightful experience. The minced chicken was stuffed inside a fillet of chicken with loads of dry fruits and other spices that added a taste to it. 

Murgh Musallam came with flavoured rice and big portion of chicken cooked in rich spices adding to a great flavour. 

The Gosht Dum Biryani had generous portion of 3 Mutton pieces that was well cooked. This Biryani tasted very different without those typical mitha attar or kewra scent emanating. The flavour from the meat dominated the rice and tasted mind boggling. 

The Garlic Nan had coarsely roasted garlics smeared over the bread. 
 
The Shorba was great and so was the Chaas. 

I have to say that the price of all items are very reasonable considering this to be a fine dining restaurant. The interior was well done and quite tastefully too. 

The 2 things which perhaps should have been looked into are:
1. The AC was too chilling making it a bit uncomfortable at times. 
2. The washroom on the upper floor is a single use and common. May be a two separate ones would have been better. 

Last but not the least, every staff had a smiling face and attentive. So was the lady at the ground floor reception desk. 

Highly recommend this restaurant for a joyful experience. Will visit again and again.

This ia actually a pretty late review but as they saw better late than never.So i visited kareem's 3 weeks back with my family.We booked a table at 2 pm and arrived at 1:30 pm.Kareem is located beside the famous downing street in sector 5.The location is extremely stunning specially if you visit it on a rainy day.
Now coming to the restaurant it was very spacious with a soothing ambience.It gave you a nawabi feel specially with the decor.We got a table on the 1st floor.The floor has an led tv too.We were a group of 9 people.Now for the food for starters we ordered the non veg kabab platter and bhetkii tandoori.For drinks everyone had lime soda whereas i had the watermelon mojito.The food arrived after 30 minutes and it was worth the wait.There was an assortment of kebabs like chicken kabab,tengri,seekh kabab and a few more (sorry i forgot the names).The kebabs were hands down the best kebab i have tasted till date.They were juicy ,soft,succelent and melted in the month.There was a right blend of spices and it was cooked to perfection.For the bhekti tandoori i didn't like it much.Frankly it tasted bland to me and there was a certain smell to it. The watermelon mojito was another disappointment,it tasted like toothpaste.

For main course we had the famous rann biriyani, chicken biryani,cheese garlic naan,chicken lahori and chicken Karachi.The rann biriyani needs no description.It tasted delicious and the quantity was more than enough for 7 people.But the it was the cheese garlic naan that stole my heart.It was crispy and the taste left your tastebuds wanting for more.Coupled with the lahori chicken it stole the show.The chicken karachi too tasted delicious.I didnt have the chicken biriyani but my aunty said it was delicious too. 
Overall the place is a very nice place to visit with your family.The staff is very courteous and friendly.The overall bill came around 6500 which i felt was okay.Will drop by soon again to try some other dishes.

A very new one. Opened in April this year. Initially first month they tried to serve buffet but considering the wastage they decided to concentrate on ala carte only. 
I hv heard so much abt Delhi's Kareem's so the name in itself is an attraction to me. I am not sure if it's the same but if it's the same then also I won't be surprised. 
We had only 2 things the Kebab and the dessert. 
And both were ek se badkar ek. 
The gosht Barra chap was too good and so was the chicken potli Kebab .. Chicken Kebab stuffed with minced chicken. 
In dessert the Firni was too good but what was outstanding was the Shahi Tukda. I didn't hv such tasteful one for a long long time.

Location is very easy, its inside PS Srijan tech park (salt lake sector V) beside Ford showroom. Wonderfully decorated, interiors and ambiance were marvellous. It was my fiance's birthday and we hoped there for luncheon. Ordered for Murg potli kebab (one of their signature dishes), Ghost dum biriyani (Kareem's special), Murg Karachi, Virgin Mojito, Cucumber cooler and last but not the least Malai firni. The cooler was suggested by one their staff, they were very hospitable. Each of the dishes were exceptionally well prepared and the tastes were simply yummy. One of the best experience, we will be coming soon to taste Murg Masalam.

On a rainy thursday evening i decided to go to kareems to try their murgh musallam. Having heard a lot about this place and their reputation for serving soft tender chicken this was on my list for a long time.
Located just beside 10 downing street in sector 5. It is a fine dining restaurant and it can be easily identified from a distance. The interiors have been nicely decorated the chairs in the seating area look vintage and are beautiful. The first floor was operational when i went the 2nd floor was not operating that day.
I ordered for a murgh musallam(whole chicken). They dont serve the chicken as a whole, its cut into pieces. But, man the chicken was super tender and kinda melt in the mouth. The gravy was very thick, tasty and rich and was served with yellow fragrant rice which made the dish heavenly. We ordered for butter nan to have the gravy with it and they went well.
The staff is courteous their suggestions are bang on accurate and the pricing is very decent according to the standard of service and the quality of food served. 
Definitely worth a second visit as lots of kebabs nd mumbaiyya biryani are left for me to get my hands on.
For kolkata biryani fanatics a disclaimer:-
This place serves mumbaiyaa biryani not the kolkata one. So dont gt upset if u dnt find an aloo in ur plate of aromatic basmati served with super-soft meat
Happy dining!!

Believe me veg is not at all bad!

Took my mom for a belated mother's day treat here last night. Like most of typical Bengali mothers out there my mom doesn't like eating in a restaurant and prefers to make her own dish at home. So when I say she actually liked the food here that's a huge thing to say the least & very rare for me. 😅
Food: Now let's talk about the food. We ordered Virgin Mojito, Butter & Cheese Nan , Murg Lahori & Caramel Custard. I personally loved the Custard while my mom complimented the cooking of Butter Nan and Lahori. The Murg Lahori was spicy and soft. Perfect dish if you are having Indian breads like kulcha or Nan.
Will surely visit again to taste the other dishes like Biriyani and mutton main courses. I was thinking of giving it a 4 star but as it was able to impress my mom I am giving 4.5 😁.

Ambience: Well enough. Spacious and decorative. Also you can actually see the kitchen through a look through mirror on the side of the restaurant.

Stuff & service: The stuff and the manager were very cordial in their approach. As my mom put it ," No matter how good is your food,the most important thing in restaurant is your reception of your customers.

Location : A bit far from the main city but if u have personal car/ola shouldn't be a problem.

And lastly I would like to thank the Dineout app for their amazing offers which virtually made this outing tax free for me. :)

Located very strategically, opposite to rdb
Kareem's gives u a feeling of fine dinning ( well, almost) which is unique in kolkata for a full mughlai serving restaurant...
Ambience and decor is top notch but the BIRIYANI IS NOT

EXTREMLY DISAPPOINTED AND DISSATISFIED WITH THE KAREEM'S SPECIAL BiRIYANI..
its not bad for a north indian style biriyani, may be
But its not anywhere d a m n near to authentic mughlai biriyani..
Kebabs are average to good.
Not reccomended for biriyani at all,,

Food is a work of art. And like art, it is often taken for granted by the general masses to be a patriarchal property. 
The food from this restaurant is most definitely a work of art. Anyone failing to acknowledge this, unfortunately belongs to the those unrequited masses. 
Their Kulfi Kebab is a perfect melody of cheese and chicken slow cooked in a grill. If you want a quick trip to heaven, you can have a bite of this delicacy. For me, this was the undoubted winner in the entire menu. 
The ambience of the restaurant is soft, homely and the owners are a lovely group of individuals.
My humble suggestion to people going to eat is - wear something comfortable and don't hesitate to open a small poultry farm of beautifully cooked meat in your tummy. 
Also, unlike good art, the prices are not only reasonable and but also very much reasoned for.

Have been here to dig into vegetarian platter. On a Sunday evening at around 8:30, they were all out of Potatoes!  No starter, no main course! To top it all, i noticed that they don't even serve kulcha in there, which is such a shame! 
A special mention to the staff there, all trained liars! When asked to get the manager, they said that all of them were the Heads, 5 minutes post which came the Manager! They were absolutely cold n non courteous! 
A Sunday dinner being brutally ruined rightly fetches them the lowest rating!

Kareem's markets itself as one of the most luxurious and prestigious brands in food business. Well, let us be the judge of that.
The staff and management is the most careless and laid back in the business. Kareem's being a big brand name, the customer is taken for granted here.
Kareem's is just overrated. The chef cannot prepare a potato dish just so to start with. Potato starters could not be served as potato was over on Sunday by 8:45 pm. And the justification for that was as ridiculous as the place itself: 'We are a major non veg restaurant. We do not prepare much of veg items. We just wanted to fill the menu with a few veg items.' As I started questioning them and their methods, suddenly a manager appears. I was looking at the waiters who just told me that they were the only head at Kareem's, Kolkata. Suddenly there was a new head amongst the waiters. The manager trying to cover up and hide the mistakes of the so called "courteous" waiters.
Let's get down to food quality and service. Virgin mojito was not remotely mojito. It was a below par drink. Biryani was to be served at last as instructed by me. And somehow it ended on the table as the first dish. It had to be sent back. Masala kulcha is not prepared in Kareem's which came as a shock to me. There were few other hiccups as well. Ofcourse we did not eat much,infact minimal quantities, after such misbehave from the staff and management there. We paid the bill after a little negotiation and left. Yes , we left the restaurant in the middle of our dinner. The management was least bothered. 
Now all this took place on a very important day for me, on 16th July. I wanted to make my sister's birthday special. On the contrary, I made it worse by taking her to Kareem's for such a horrific experience there.

I heard a lot about this place so finally I planned to go there, and it's absolutely worth it. The price is very less and anyone can afford it. But forget about price, the food is brilliant. I am surely going back there again. We had ordered for Chicken malai kabab, mutton rogan josh, chicken dum biryani, Tangri kabab, and mocktails ( watermelon and orange).

Nice place just opposite the rdb building ....beside 10 downing Street....first of all they greated us with warm welcome.....they gave our seat and their food menu....

The interiors are fantastic with mild music playing in background.....

First of all I want to say that yes the prices are reasonable.....

The ambience,decoration and behavior is top class....

It was my girlfriend's birthday

We ordered chicken tangri kabab, half murgh mussalam, Kareem's special ghost dum biriyani and green salad....

The tangri kabab was out of the world so soft jucy and tender ,proper marination makes it a hit...and the aroma also was top class....

The half murgh mussalam was our experiment of the day...and it was also a successful affair....tandoori chicken pieces with awsmly tasted gravy,egg and pulao makes it a instant hit...

Next comming to the biriyani ...yes it is not Kolkata biriyani...but yes tasted good...small four jucy tender mutton pieces were there...

The green salad plate was nicely decorated....
After all it was a great experience....
Thank you Kareem'sTanushree Chakraborty

The biriyani is enough for two if you have gone for a not so tummy boggling meal. About 5 meat pieces in it. Would visit again to try the chicken platter. Good work guys!!!!

To start with, Today I came to know only from one of them from Kareem's, this outlet is a branch of Kareem's from Mumbai, not from delhi. Anyways, the list of the food we ordered is- a bucket of kebab 😬, which had malai kebab, tandoori chicken, hariwali kebab. We were not in a mood for galwatia kebab today. Next we had biryani, garlic and cheese garlic naan, mutton nihari, chicken in cilantro and green chilli paste( i dont remember the name) and lahori chicken. We also had virgin mojito, green apple mojito and shikanji. We ended up with Shahi Tukda!!

Likes-
- I appreciate the quality
- I like spicy, and they know my choice
- The kebabs were soft and juicy, hariwali kebab was yummmm
- Shahi Tukda was awesome at the fullest, so as the cheese garlic naan
- Mutton Nihari was the showstopper for me

Dislikes-
 - a bit overpriced
 - biriyani i won't suggest
 - Chickens could have been cooked a bit more in the dishes

I had heard a lot about this restaurant so just thought of giving it a try,n yes I wasn't disappointed.I went there with my husband.
We ordered Murgh potli kebab,Mutton seekh kebab & Tandoori Bhetki for the starters.
Murgh Potli Kebab was just awesome.Very delicious and a must try.
Mutton seekh kebab was ok as it should have been cooked more to make it a little soft.
Tandoori bhetki was also fine.
Then we ordered Kareem's special Mutton Biryani.It was so yummy.The mutton pieces were soft n well-cooked.Its not d same usual type of biryani which we get in Kolkata,it's like d Lucknow one.One should definitely try this here.
Then lastly comes the dessert.We ordered Shahi Tukra.It was creamy,delicious n just too good.
The staffs of the restaurant are very courteous and friendly.Ambience too good.
Just one drawback- NO CAR PARKING 
We literally got wet while going to d restaurant as it was raining and there is no separate car parking for d restaurant and we had to park our car on d road.

We went for a lunch in a group of fourteen. The sitting space provided to us was a bit tight but we managed only because it was ala carte and none of us had to get up from our seats.

The starters were just awesome ! We started with afghani murgh tandoori and gosht bara chap and both were totally die for dishes.

The main course was good too but nothing great to talk about. We had garlic naan with murgh lahori and murgh karachi. I believe..the murgh from Karachi was far better than that from Lahore :) although Lahore was recommended by the staff there.

Overall, we had a pretty good lunch today and yes, I would definitely come back here for the starters.

This is a beautiful restaurant in Sector 5, Salt Lake. The interiors are done up in green shades which is very soothing yet royal at the same time. We tried the Galouti kebab and the Gosht Dum Biriyani. The Galouti kebab was the most tender meat kebab I've had in a very long time. It simply melted in my mouth.  The biriyani was very different than what I'm accustomed with. Which is not to say it was bad. The service is great, with the waiters greeting us right from the moment we entered and constantly asking us if we needed something. Looking forward to more visits so that I can try out the other options in the menu.

Now let's come down to food since I am vegetarian I can share my opinion on the same. My order was Paneer Lasuni Tikka & Paneer mirch tikka for starter Both were absolutely perfect. You get the burnt tandoor flavour and the marination was really perfect. Paneer pieces were quite small and there was almost no salad with the tikka. Some of my friends tried Non veg even they came across the same problem the portion are way too small.
Main course-
Ordered Panner makhanwala, Panner Lahori, Dum ki Dal, Veg Dum biryani, Gallic Naan,Taftan & Green salad

All were good my favourite was dum ki Dal you can make out that it was cooked in copper vessel which makes it stand out. In bread Taftan was unique bit on sweet side but goes well with paneer and Dal.  Salad had beetroot a rare think to happen.Biryani was good but it is different then what we get in the leading outlet of biryani in kolkata. You can give it a try. 

Pros- You will hardly have any complaints in terms of food quality and taste. 

Cons- Portion are too small as to what they charge. Presentation of food is also quite average from such an brand. Entire outlet was smelling with  prawn so had to ask them for room freshner. 

Verdict- Recommended. Food quality and ambience is a complete bliss. However every portion served is strictly for 2 person.

Situated in the famous restaurant belt in saltlake, sector V, Kareem's is a restaurant that is a must go for foodies in Kolkata. Ambience was really too good with specious table for enjoy your food heavenly. Ordered Murgh Lasooni Tikka, Gosht Barra Chaap in starter. Both was delicious. In main course ordered Butternun, Tandoori roti & Gosht biriyani. The nun & roti was on the average side whereas the biriyani has the typical Delhi masala flavour. Those who love the excitic Kolkata style biriyani (as me) may not get the deliciousness in the biriyani, but with the curd served, it make the biriyani taste much better. Our side dish was Moorg Lahori, it was really one of our best cuisine till date, specially the gravy tasted just too much awesome. At the end, in desert section, Sahi tukra & Malai Firni was really out of the world, those just properly complete your appetite. But one point, no parking place available with this restaurant, though street parking can be availed. Looking forward to visit again.

Firstly , this isn't Delhi's kareems. So if u go there expecting u know the entire menu, then u will b disheartened. We got the seat with sofa and chairs. The sofa was stained, so we sat on the chairs.food was like any other mughlai restaurant, nothing special. Flies were all around, and when asked they said it's because of the rain.my bill came before my fresh lime could come .

This place is just awesome.. The ambience is royal and very much spacious.  Loved the interior.. their service is appreciable... Went there with my colleagues for a team lunch. Ordered raan biriyani, the best biriyani I've had till date. The potli kabab was mesmerizing. Also other than that loved Karachi murgh,  cheese chilli nun, murg lahori. And last but not the least the malai firni was a perfect end to our great grand team lunch.. Will visit the place all over again ♥️

It's one of the worst mutton biryani we had last evening. As if they mixed mutton curry and basmati rice and served us.
No way its dum biryani, 
I will never recommend anybody to visit Kareem's to eat biryani for sure. 
The chef must learn what is DUM BIRYANI!!!

Visit Kareems for a team lunch with colleagues. The ambience is good. The service was awesome and waiters are well behaved and educated.
Coming to the food, which is really awesome and tastes out of the world. The best food i liked is the green apple mocktail and the Ran Briyani which was jumbo in size. A single ran briyani is enough for 7 guys. The most interesting part of the briyani was the mutton quantity and quality. They gave 1.3 kg of mutton over the briyani which was very tasty.
Tasted some dishes too but that was my favourite.
Love to visit again and again.

One of the best places to enjoy some good food . The items  in the menu are so delicious one wonders what to pick and what not to .....
The delight in tasting those fingerlicking GAULATI KEBABS and wazwan is indescribable.
My favourite was MURGH KARACHI.....a rare delicacy from karachi involving the spicy masalas from karachi thats tastes heavenly....
I could go on but i will leave it you people to taste and enjoy kareem's ideal preparation of northindian mughlai based cuisines ...
People looking for great ambience ...well my description would be royalty redefined with class and beauty ....such a luxurious decor to feel comfortable and enjoy some good food

It is located just below my office building (PS Srijan Corporate Park). I have ordered food for takeaway to my home when returning from office.

1. Gosht Dum Biriyani: Very light, nice Hyadrabadi flavour.  But it is not the very well known Biriyani which we Bengali love to have. So this is not the typical Laukhnow/Kolkata Biriyani. So my rating is 3.5 on 5.
2. Mutton Rogan Josh: Gravy item, not so impressed, but good. My rating 3 on 5.

Been to this awesome place on 30th June(bfr GST) and really awesome food was served. We ordered kareems special murgh and afghani tandoori for starters. They were juicy, succulent and well cooked. The main course was raan biriyani and murgh lahori. The biriyani is really awesome. A must try for all true biriyani lovers. The quantity was huge. We were a group of 7 pepl and hence it was enuf. However they have limited options for dessert with only malai firni and shahi tukda. We went for the malai kulfi and it tasted really good. It was true novelty for the service as they were prompt and apt with no unnecessary delays. For the restaurant guys, please improve on the lime soda drinks. They really needs to be worked upon. Overall a highly recommended restaurant.

What disappointed us:

Mutton Shorba

It was indeed a great experience to try this new place in sector 5. we were at last able to make a plan for lunch today. We went there around 1.25pm and the place was overall empty. The decor was happy and relaxing unlike a mughlai joint. 
We ordered 
1. Murgh Potli Kabab - it was amazing with ground chicken wrapped in cheese and malai topping.
2. Karachi ghost- the texture of the meat was so soft and it melt in the mouth. It was filled with flavour and the gravy was a delicacy to be cherished. A much higher version of golbarir pathar mangso with Persian spices
3. Garlic nan- the bread was very fresh, thin and soft
The overall experience was lovely and I keep this in one of my top favs. Good job team.

Me and my husband were looking for some mughlai dishes and Kareem's was very near to my office,so we thought of visiting it.We ordered Afgani chicken Tandoori.. and it's just yum.
 Chicken was so soft.
In main course we order Kareem's special ghosht biriyani and Lahori chicken.I had tasted this type of biriyani in my Hyderabad days.So it's not so appealing.But the Lahori chicken was the show stopper.We loved it . 👍👍

Place is easily identifiable because its stood opposite of RDB cinemas and its the ground floor of srijan business park. Ambiance is really very nice and people are very helpful. Moreover their service is highly appreciable. I went their on a saturday night and its a bit crowded for weekend but we did't have to wait long for our table. You can have different type of kebab and their special foods. I was a bit confused about what to order but there were people who helped me and so I ordered kareem special murgh kabab and potli chicken kabab as starter.They were delicious and for main course murgh tikka biriyani with ghost chap which tastes perfect and honestly right now its a best place for me to taste perfect kababs and much more. Must visit once.

It was there in my wish list, although I came to Kolkata recently. The name itself makes me nostalgic about Delhi foods. So I though ke salary a gaye tho Chalo lutwaane. I entered and it was raining outside so I though of sitting at the entrance. Well that place is roomy and you can enjoy the rain. Par who kheench ke andar le gaye( shit happens). So I ordered Murg Karachi, and it was really good. Although I don't know how it tastes authentically as I never visited Karachi(thankfully). Couldn't order more as I was alone and for dessert it was Doodhy Halwa, and it was awesome. It's a must try desert guys. And to my relief it's not that heavy on your pocket either. Ambience is good. Service is also good for Kolkata standard (sorry but don't point the gun at me, I experienced some extraordinary service in Bangalore). So from my side it's a must visit if you are in Kolkata. Have a blast DAKAARRR. Peace.

This was my second visit to Kareem's in Sector V and it was nothing to be excited about. Afgani Murg Tandoori which I liked in the first visit seemed a bit underwhelming but was still better than other restaurants. Galauti Kebab was nice and soft melt in mouth. Murgh Lahori was also another of the underwhelming dishes.

Not the best food available in this area to be frank. Be there for the brand. Food afghani murgh kabab was good that I felt. But gosht dum biriyani was not at all upto the mark. It was neither a Kolkata biriyani nor a hyderabadi dum but a weird mixture of both. Still liked the ambience and service ia very good. But for the food there are many better places to go.

Kareem's a famous name throughout India for its biryanis and kebabs. Went there for Dinner and was unexpectedly taken aback. The halo which I had expected after I took a bit was absent. I had expected a lot more the Place. 
I was a bit disappointed with the Veg Kebab platter, which had a lot more Babycorn than expected, the Chicken Platter on the other hand was really amazing. Next thing we tried out was the "Kareem Special' Murgh Dum Biryani which was fine not great.

On the occasion of Eid, my taste buds were craving for some delish Biriyani! Kareem's was my #1 choice, having opened up so close to my office in Sector V. The three of us were quickly seated at 6 seater with beautiful teal sofas! But I'm running out of good things to say now!!

So here it goes: The food was a major MAJOR disappointment. We started with Paya Shorba which was a mutton soup/shorba wherein you could just taste the generous amounts of turmeric and oil. The Potli Kebab were Chicken kebab stuffed with Chicken, which looked on the plate like big tennis balls and thoroughly unappetizing. It tasted decent, I was told by my colleagues. I took the Nalli Barra Kebab and what a disaster it was! The meat was tough, the preparation nowhere near what it should be. The disappointingly average food continued with Dum Biriyani which again was shockingly passe. 

Summing up: At-best-average food, nice ambience, slowish service and never coming back resolution!!!

Price point: Around 1600 for 1 portion of shorba, 2 kebabs, 3 fresh limes and 1 biriyani.

Nothing could be more cliché than to go for kebabs and biriyani and roti on Eid. Hence the trip to the newest addition of the town. There was a Ramadan special menu complete with haleem but we stuck to the actual menu card. We began our evening with the seekh gilafi kebab. The taste was good though too salty for my liking. The main course was garlic naan, cheese naan, Kareem's special murgh dum biriyani, chicken lahori and mutton rogan josh. The food was well cooked and tasted brilliant though the lahori deserves a mention. The biriyani was a little dry though. Ending with a delicious phirni I was satisfied with the food quality. The staff is very well behaved and courteous. Would suggest others to visit the joint and enjoy the cuisine.

Was on our list, since heard it's new in town and famous for speciality in Mughal food, finally went yesterday with family. Sat on the round table down and ordered our choices. Nizami kababs and chicken tandooris for starters, mutton n chicken biriyanis and some mutton gravy and a chicken gravy. Tandoori was tender and apt , but the mutton biriyanis were just fab. And the mutton gravy I don't remember the name, ordered on waiters recommendation was simply lip smacked. The place lived up to it's name for me.

Visited this restaurant on the last day of Ramzan (25/6/2017). Had high expectations related to the food and the special Ramzan menu. Frankly speaking,  my expectations were met leaving me delighted and with the desire to visit this place again in the near future. 

The starters (both containing mutton) were excellent. The meat was tender and perfectly cooked. In one of the starters, the mutton had a coating of malai which gelled well with the meat.
The Gosht Biriyani and the Murgh Lahori in the main course were delicious as well. The Biriyani tasted totally different from the Kolkata biriyani and this was a nice variation. The Murgh Lahori complemented the biriyani with perfection.

The ambience and decor is beautiful. The staff was polite and interactive.

Highly recommended.

Went on a sunday afternoon lunch and had a wonderful experience..had a full four course meal.and enjoyed it thourougly....
Soup: The murg yakhni shorba was v wel made..mildy indian spiced chicken.soup in creamy style with melt in mouth chicken cubes..
Starters: the ghost nalli kebab was soft mutton kebabs spiced in tandoori flavours topped with cream... the ghost barra kebab was vv hard and difficult to chew..the mutton really needs to be cooked to be more juicy and tender... though thr mutton galauti kebab made of minced keema was just melt in mouth...very mildly spiced..tasted great with thier coriander chutney. 
Main course: the main course was the best..the chicken dum biryani was very well cooked..had mild flavours and around 3 to 4 pieces of chicken and a soft cooked potato in it..the butter chicken was truly delhi style aunthentic one..the creamy tomato based chicken shredded cooked well witn fengruk flavours...one of the best butter chicken u get in kol...we ordered dal.makhni which was not available so we took yello dal tadka instead which was truly punjab dhaba style dal tadka..delicious...with thier soft parathas and naan...the garlic naan was also nice..
Desert: the malai phirni was good..could be better..
Drinks: they have a good variety of drinks reasonable priced .  Thier virgin mojito was nice..their fresh lime sweet and salted was also great... well great indiam food...a must try for all.indian food lovers...

I've been to Kareems thrice already and am convinced the last visit is nowhere in sight! Multiple reasons that keeps Kareems at the top of my list is (a) absolutely lip smacking kebabs (special mention to the mouth watering kulfi kabab that tastes like nothing I've ever had before) (b) being a biriyani lover, the Kareems biriyani is a delight with the aroma and delicious softness of its meat (c) Shahi Tukda on their desserts menu is subtle but wonderfully tasty (d) apart from the food, an equally important aspect to dining out is the service and Kareems has scored high in this department in all my visits so far. The staff is polite, the service is quick and you are given just the optimum amount of attention (e) the ambience is perfect for peaceful dining and it goes well for both small groups or big crowds thereby becoming a perfect choice for all types of occasions.

Kareems only elevates the status of Kolkata being renowned as the food capital of India and it is a proud feather in the cap of the Kolkata food industry ! Kudos to Team Kareem

This place has a great and soothing decor, perfect ambience and good service but what beats badly this place is their food. It was very oily and food not that good. We ordered for Paya Shorba which had only oil and oil with no Gosht in it, Afghani Murg Kebab which was too dry and sluggish. The only okay thing we had was Haleem which they serve during Ramzan.
Personally, I wouldn't like to come back to this place due to low food taste and quality.

So few days back I was just searching for a new restaurant in zomato and while searching I just came across this restaurant known as Kareem's. So finally made my decision to hope on this restaurant on Father's Day.This restaurant is located just beside 10 Downing Street in Saltlake Sector 5.This restaurant has two floors and we went to the upper floor.So now talking about the food we ordered Murgh Malai Tikka and Murgh Seekh Kebab as starter.Gosht Dum Biriyani, Cheese Garlic Naan,Butter Naan,Gosht Karachi as main course and Cucumber Cooler and Fresh Lime Soda as beverage.So my ratings on the foods that we have ordered are :
Murgh Malai Tikka : 8/10
Murgh Seekh Kebab: 6.5/10
Gosht Dum Biriyani: 10/10 (Must try because of its taste, quality which is more than sufficient for 2 people and 4 medium sized mutton pieces)
Cheese Garlic Naan: 8.5/10
Butter Naan: 8/10
Gosht Karachi: 9.5/10 (Must try)
Cucumber Cooler: 10/10 (Must try)
Fresh Lime Soda: 8/10

And my overall rating on this restaurant will be :
Food Quality : 8.5/10
Ambience: 9/10
Service : 7/10

I went with a team of 11 from my office today.  The food, service and ambiance was just awesome.
I had read some  reviews which said , service is slow.  The service was as required. Rather they were so  good , that when I asked to pack the extra chicken, they also gave a nan complementary.
The food was mouth watering. Must have are Kareem's Special Biryani, Malai Firni and gilauti kabab. 
The two floored restaurant is well maintained and decorated, apt to the food they specialize with "Muglai". Okay the pocket pinch was reasonable.
I just loved it, and will always recommend it to all my friends.

My experience at Kareem's was wonderful I must say. I went there with my family on the occassion of my parents' marriage anniversary and it was totally worth it specially because they loved the place. The hospitality we recieved was amazing. The ambience, the decor is very classy and elegant. Staffs are very good, friendly and efficient. Coming to the food we opted Chicken Potli Kebab and Chicken Kali miri Kebab for starters. Potli Kebab was the star dish thay day, we all simply loved it. Kali miri was also good. For the main course we had Chicken Dum Biryani and Chicken Karachi. Chicken Karachi was perfectly spicy as we wanted, I would want to suggest this with Naan. The biryani they serve is not at all like Kolkata biryani so some people specially who love Kolkatan Biryani should avoid this but people who want to experiment go for this...it has got so good flavour and the chicken was so well cooked. One plate is enough for two people. Price is a bit high but that is considerable looking at their service.

Just located beside 10 Downing Street, this place have been a hype since quite a long time. Well, to start with the ambience and the courtesy of the staffs, I must say that it is wonderful! Now coming to the food, I personally feel that it is quite overpriced with respect to the taste or the quantity! We ordered Ramadan Special Chicken Kulfi Tangri Kabab which was served like after half an hour and that was quite irritating. Like if you're coming from office for a lunch(just as I went), you have the feel that you have to go back to office on time and waiting for a dish for half an hour is really irritating. If you have kept Ramadan Special dishes in the menu and people are ordering them frequently, then the arrangements should be done accordingly!! Coming to the taste, it was really yummy as it was completely dipped in Cheese! I loved it.
We ordered Chicken Dum Biriyani and Lahori Chicken. Both of them were nothing special as compared to the price. Not disappointed, but expected quite a lot from this place! :)

Located opposite to RDB boulevard. Awesome interior and cordial staffs welcome you. 
Thankfully we visited in the month of Ramadan and got to taste some special dishes.
I tried Kareem's Delhi. I tried Kareem's Gurgaon. Now, I tried their Kolkata outlet...not once but twice. 
Pretty amazing experience. Lip smacking dishes will simply take you to some other world. 
The good thing is that the ambiance and the courteousness of all staffs are incredible.
This is the only reason I decided to celebrate our Company listing at Kareem's Kolkata and we had a gala time out there. 
Thank you for all the warmth you showed to us.

Good ambience and service. Great kababs. Prices are a bit on the higher side. We went for a weekday office lunch. Wanted to have kababs and parathas.  Ordered Mutton Barra kabab, Galouti kabab and chapli kabab. The galouti was 'melt in the mouth' good. The chapli was also done just right. The Barra was a let down since the meat was elastic and tough. The parathas were wheat parathas and quite tough. You expect paper thin maida parathas fried in ghee with kababs. But it was not so. Overall good, nothing great. Pricey for the value.

It was our first visit to the restaurant and we were there for a team lunch. The ambiance was nice and there was a big screen which was playing the live Champion's Trophy Semi Final. We were provided the menu and a staff member suggested us to try Murgh Tangdi Kulfi Kebab. It was awesome and the chicken was very juicy. Then we tried Murgh Mussallam, Raan Biriyani, Murgh Lahori and Murgh Karachi. Each of them were exceptionally well prepared and the quantity was also adequate. The pocket pinch is bit on the heavier side but its ok. 
Special 10/10 to the staff and would definitely visit again.

I was looking forward to visit this place for quite some time now just to know why  this place Was trending so much.  And I got my Answer yesterday... 

We tried 
Kareem's special Murgh Tandoori: one of the best tandoori chicken I have ever had. Chicken was tender juicy and the perfect blend of butter and spice gives this dish that extra notch which makes it "o so yummy "
Murgh Musallam :It's a must have ... 
this is one of the few places which serves half portion of this dish  in town and the quantity is more than enough for 2 people... 4 pics of chicken in spice medium gravy served with fare portion of pulao.. 
Simple and elegant Decor ,friendly staff , quick service .

Overall 5 Star. What I missed was an ON THE ROCKS whiskey with my Kebabs, that would hv made the rating 5*. 😉😉😉.

Ground floor of PS srijan techpark, beside to 10 downing Street..kareems was in a long waiting list for Kolkata. 
Thr first time experience was superb but 2nd visit was disappointing. 
Biriyani - 4/5, quantity is sufficient for 2 people. Light and tasty with tender pieces of chicken or mutton you will surely love.
Karachi murgh - 5/5 spicy yummy awesome chicken. 
Butter chicken - 5/5 its not like the regular butter chicken, with lots of gracy with a tint of reddish colour..really tasty, medium spicy.
Cheese garlic naan - 5/5
Starters are wonderful
Friendly staff..was extremely happy on thr first visit..but on our 2md visit faced one irritating person who was trying to be extremely smart and almost pressurised us to order as per his wish..
Also got a hair inside the biriyani , although they wanted to change the plate after complaing, but by that time we were almost done.so didn't go for the change.
Anyways the first visit was 5/5
The second visit was surprisingly 3/5 
Hope they dont drop their standard gradually.

Have been there for a lunch buffet on a saturday..the chain belongs to Karrem's Mumbai and not Karims Delhi..which was a huge confusion
To start with the soup it was pretty ordinary nothing special.
The kababs were good but the service was very bad as we had to call twice and thrice for our unlimited kababs..
Then to the main course there were quite a variety but i opted for biriyani and mutton which was not great..Not at all Kolkata Biriyani .
Coming to the dessert the gulab jamuns were small sweet nd tasted good with vanilla icecream.
A little improvement in the quality of Biriyani and service if definitely needed

Kareem's is walking distance from my office and we opted for their buffet for team lunch for around 24 people. We were provided with two sets of the table on the 1st floor and we found their service quite satisfactory and dining area is spacious and airy as well with the good decor. 

Coming to the food, For me, various kind of Kebab was the best part of the meal. They have repeated the kebabs two times with sufficient amount. We had Tandoori Paneer Tikka
, Tandoori Gobi, Kesharia Mushroom, Tandoori Chatpata Aloo, Corn Fry from the vegetarian side and I found Kesharia Mushroom and Paneer tikka worth trying. From the non-veg part, there were Gosht Sheekh Kebab, Murgh Seekh Gilafi Kebab, Murgh Kalimiri Tikka, Pudina Fish Tikka, Murgh Malai Tikka and for me the Malai tikka, Fish kebab were the best of the lot.

The general main course spread was moderate and the spread was having Tamatar Dhania Shorba
, Gosht Shorba, Mixed Veg Handi, Paneer Darbari, Dal Tadka, Murgh Korma, Bhuna Gosht, Peas Pulao, Murgh Dum Biryani and assorted bread. The biriyani was not the Kolkata biryani instead it was Mumbai Biriyani which I found good. The non-veg accomplishment was having one chicken and one mutton dish which were okay and veg dishes were also on the good side. The dessert offering, however, can be improved both taste-wise as well as variety and quality-wise. The buffet for me is a good deal in sector 5 and especially for the official lunches in case you are having a budget of around 600 per pax.

The ambience and the food, extremely high class. The wall and the ceiling decor will make you feel the Mughal culture. The food here is authentic mughlai, people who are too much obsessed with the typical taste of Kolkata biriyani may not like the original Dum biriyani and its flavor. The Chicken Lahori and the kebabs we tasted were awesome and so was the lassi. The only thing for which I had to take out a Star is because of the service. They took really long to serve and I was dying out of hunger, taking 40 mins is too long actually. Overall a nice place and highly recommended.

So one of my foodie friends suggested me this place as we were talking about good north indian food one fine evening. He said it's a must visit place for a spicy desi food lover like me. Hearing this, I couldn't wait any longer and planned a visit right then. The place has beautiful decor, a fine dining I must say. We took garlic butter naan, murgh karachi and for dessert we opted for shahi tukra. The murgh karachi as described by my friend, was heaven in the mouth tasty. The gravy was so good, you could just leave the chicken and have the naan with just the gravy itself. That doesn't mean the chicken pieces were any less tasty by the way. The chicken was juicy and flavourful and spicy. Just as we like our desi food to be. The garlic naan was just as it should have been, and the shahi tukra totally lived up to it's name. An awesome food chain I must say and would definitely give several more visits.

Avoid the raan biriyani... It's very average and mutton had some gravy like malabari biriyani. The caramel custard was awful but the firni was simply stunning. Also great is the tutti frutti. 

The decor is great.

Starter was really great especially the chicken platter and the mutton notice kebab. The cheese garlic naan and chicken side dishes were fabulous. But I was disappointed with the gosht dum biryani. Infact I would recommend not to have biryani here. Dessert was also quite good. The service could be about faster but it is likely to get better with time.

This place is near to our office. So we planned for a team lunch at this place and buffet was the obvious choice. However, the service was pathetic. We had people having veg buffet, but the service for that was very poor. While we were halfway through our starters that the served the veg starter.
Coming to the food, they served three types of chicken starter, one fish and one mutton. The mutton and fish were scarce and even after asking for the same they came with the Chicken starters. The chicken starter were a little stiff and not juicy at all.

Main course was very basic, they had soup, plain rice, dal, keema biriyani, chicken curry and mutton bhuna. The mutton was really awesome and one of the best mutton dishes i have tasted in the recent past. It was cooked to perfection with the mutton falling out of the bones and with correct blend of spices. However, again it was not available and people kept waiting and waiting for refill. Desserts had only vanilla ice cream and fresh fruits. Even the ice cream was so hard that getting one proper scoop appeared to be a Herculean task. Over all apart from the Mutton Bhuna,  nothing was there to make us go again and with the kind of service, it's difficult to keep it in our list.

Kareem's the renowned brand, now in Kolkata. When discovered that near RDB, we have just decided that we have to be there.

Location:
___________
It's near RDB, opposite of Opium. Yes very easy to locate.

Decoration:
_______________
The decoration is quite nice. They have two floors. On your entrance you will have the wooden stairs for the upper floor. Decoration is decent. We decided to be in the upper floor. They have the sofa and chair both the arrangement.

Food:
_________

This joint is known for kebab and biriyani. But yes we tried to cover the different items.

© Starters:
_____________
✓ Ghost Barra Chap: mutton ribs with juicy mutton. This is so delicious. Excellent one. 4 pieces.
✓ Murg potli kebab: the preparation as you understand by the name is a wrapper ( potli) and you have shredded chicken pieces in that. Owssum. 4 pieces.

✓ veg platter: this one contains 18 pieces of 4 different items. It includes ALU kebab, paneer kebab, mushroom , American corn, Gobi. Each of the items taste excellent. This one is just superb. Highly highly recommend for non veg people also.

© Soups:

✓ Palak sorba: veg soup. The taste is very nice. Recommended for veggie people.
✓ Paya sorba: it is good. But I expected it would be better. Not up to the mark.

They present the soup in a bowl come cup. Which i found very catchy.

© Main Courses:
____________________

✓ cheese garlic nun : nice one.
✓ cheese chilli nun: it is also nice.
✓ Garlic nun : good one. We took it 3 pieces.
✓ Ghost Dum Biriyani: okay type. Its hydrabadi biriyani type. Didn't like the taste. But yes the mutton piece was that good. It's soft and juicy.
✓ Paneer Makkhi wala: very nice. The curry was very tastey and the paneer was cooked just perfectly.
✓ Murg Lahori : Chicken preparation with the excellent gravy. It taste superb.
✓ Mutton Rogan Josh : excellent one. The Juicy mutton pieces and the gravy - superb.

© Beverages:
________________
✓ Green Apple Iced tea: good one. Refreshing.
✓ Watermelon Iced tea: didn't liked it because of the watermelon flavour was tasting like syrup.
✓ Cucumber Cooler: excellent one. Best among the beverages we have tried.

© Dessert:
_____________
✓ Malai Firni : very very nice. It taste excellent.
✓ Shahi Tukra: just loved that, owssum one.

So the experience was very nice. it is just a sudden plan and that ended up with great satisfaction. Loved most of their items,which were excellent. Only two items we didn't like. All that cost 4344 INR for 6 people.

To management: we have a great experience there. Your hospitality is also a point to remember.

To all : just give it a try. We loved it, you will have the same reaction for sure.

..... And till then eat well :)

A truly wholesome experience.. It was a late night dinner plan.. And one of the best thing about this restaurant being that they take orders till 11:30 p. m which is real late even on weekdays.

We went full force on the chickens (ordered almost all the chicken dishes except butter chicken). These included chicken lahori (taste was actually different), chicken korma(nothing new but was good), chicken hara-bhara masala (this was the best of all, we ordered this again). Along with these we got Cheese chilly paratha, a new name although, which was also amazing. The food taste was awesome, all the dishes were equally yummy. 

Now coming to the ambience, this is the main attraction and it really is superbbb.. The entrance to the restaurant itself looks grand.. The staffs were also very cordial and smiling.. The food was served well in time even when we ordered several dishes.. 

Overall.. Complete satisfaction to the taste buds and to heart.. The pocket pinch was also normal, because in some reviews I had read that the price is on the higher side but we didn't feel as such.. So, folks, please visit and enjoy the delicacy and the ambience..

First of all a very good experience. non-veg platter with varieties of chicken kebabs are fine as usual. Tandoori tarkari and Mushroom tikka both are worth mentioning, and even die hard non-vegans are craving for it . Gosht Biryani is fine, but the secret lies in the mutton dishes we have ordered. Succulent and well cooked Rojan josh and Gosht Karachi are the things for which you would like to revisit the place. Bheja Masala, shredded brain of gosht in thick gravy, is the item i would like to search in other eateries. Shahi tukda and malai firni, as desserts, are perfectly placed in the end. Only thing that goes against them is the delay in serving, which they should improve at least for the lean weekday lunchtime.
                    

P.S : We have ordered Yuzu & Elderflower iced tea, Green apple mojito and Green apple fizz cooler. Mocktails are also very good and reasonably priced.

One of the best place in town to experience a fine dining at budget prices.. It's located in Sec V at the new Srijan complex that has come up. The place is well decorated to give you a royal feel and their service as well.

I ordered for Kareems Murgh Biriyani, Chicken Hariyali, Cucumber Cooler and Malai Phirni. I haven't had such tasty food for long. The biriyanis speciality lies in its simplicity. I has no rich colours flavours or spices... Quite subtle it it's appeal yet extraordinary in taste.

The F&B personnels are well behaved and so the manager. They would ensure that you experience a lovely fine dining experience with them. 

Must Try: Biriyani, Cucumber Cooler

Happy Eating 😊

Every restaurant to me should have two qualities- service and taste of the food.
Coming to the service- this place makes you bore and gets under your skin till they can serve the food you have ordered. Sometimes they will provide you with something else that you haven't ordered. So there is a total chaos and mismanagement happening around.
Moreover, they are not bothered about it.
Taste- well most of the dishes are well prepared. Especially the mutton dishes. But the price they charge and the amount they give- like a million bucks for a single duck for example. And the naan-roti section, very very pathetic preparartions comparing to all muslim restaurants serving gracious and palatable dishes around kolkata. Desserts are good, not great one- but good.
In a nutshell- a food joint with standard food and subsrandard service- i don't think i will be visistong again till a total change in the scenario happens. Till then, better to visit someplace else.

A must go place for non veg lovers. I really liked chicken tandoori and mutton nihari. Chicken biryani was not that satisfying, service was bit late though. They should work on their service. 
If you are looking for delicious north indian and mughlai cuisine then you should try once. And not to forget being a dessert lover I loved the phirni. So try it too.😋

I would have given this place a zero if that was possible. The ambience and service are great. But the quality of food is extremely bad. We had ordered lasuni murg tikka, which was undercooked. The Kareem's special mutton dum biriyani was anything but a biriyani. And the Shahi Tukda was a disaster. It was a slice of stale bread having the flavour of raw oil. Probably we didn't order the right items, but if these items made their way on to the menu, I don't think I have the courage to try out the other items. 

And one thing that ticks me off are the fake reviews that people put up on Zomato nowadays. Do restaurants pay these reviewers to put a rave review in Zomato?

As for me, the best place for kebabs, biriyani and sahi tukda will always be Arsalaan, Park Circus outlet.

Excellent service and top notch food. No questioning the ambiance as it is outright fantastic. If you want to have a better than usual lunch while you are at Salt Lake and have a craving for Biriyani then this is the place. 
The Biriyani is one of the best I've ever had. Do not go for the fancy ones. Stick to the basic Murg Dum Biriyani and you will be blown away. 
The place is so popular amongst the people that you might have to sometimes wait to get yourself a table.

Parking might be a issue here as inside no available parking for kareems.
When you enter the restro u get an amazing great looking surroundings and ambience greeted with good attendants.
Ambience is really good.
Fairly priced .
Now when you open the menu card you get good varieties!! I tried reshmi tikka they were excellent good quantity and fair price taste amazing.
Now what stole the show for me was the prawns one of a kind absolutely well cooked amazing taste and just wow recommended to try this "JHINGA"
AND GRAVY ITMEMS TO WERE GOOD AMAZING TO SAY THE LEAST 
A COMPLETE FAMILY RESTAURANT WITH GOOD AMBIENCE AND PERFECTLY POISED ATMOSPHERE !!!

Finallyyy Kareem's opens in Kolkata. Classic kareem taste for the dishes, service needs to be improved thought. We ordered Nalli and Babycorn for maincourse and Shahi Tukda for desserts. The Nalli was to die for, babycorn was okies but given its a hard core non veg joint, we didnt expect much from veg. Shahi Tukda was also very good. Will definitely go back..

The legendary Kareem's !
Amazing addition to the food belt of Kolkata.
Starting with the Food- We went in a big group so I got a chance to try a lot of their tandoor items- Chicken Malai Kabab, Potli kabab, Mutton Burra chaap, Mutton  chapli kabab, and Tandoori Pomfret! I can confidently say they have the best kababs in Kolkata.. what I really liked about it was all the Kababs were succulent, juicy and they melt in your mouth! 

After the kababs there was not much space left for main course, but we couldn't resist and we were not disappointed! Their biriyani I felt was authentic mughlai biriyani and the original taste and flavour left us licking our fingers.

For dessert I liked their Shahi Tukda a lot! Even their firni was of much better quality than what's available in most places.

Even their mocktails were excellent (Watermelon mojito)

Ambience- The ambience is proper fine dining, it is a huge place and they have kept a separate couches and tables inside the restaurant as a waiting area! That is extremely thoughtful of them as on the weekend it was quite busy and there was waiting but we had no issues waiting as there was a comfortable seating area.

I felt the quality of their food was better than 5 star and the prices were quit nominal( approx 600 per head)

Will go back again.

Utterly luxurious is what the feel of the place is, albeit it isn't the Old Delhi Karim's if you thought so. Its the franchise of Kareem's Mumbai, much awaited arrival and much anticipated reception. You enter and you are greeted by polite & humble men. The place is new, hence it feels fresh although the interiors aren't something specially mention-able. Coming out of the ambiance and onto the food table, well the menu is a sprawling take across various Indian cuisines. North Indian dishes were good, and Butter Chicken was a stand out for me. Tikkas and Kebabs are great, but a little more varied in names, and a little less in quantity so the platters are a good choice to go if you feeling confused. Veggies are in for a treat to as the place doesn't let their spirits down in any manner. Mushrooms and Paneers are in plenty, paired with equal quality and taste. The Biryani is something that they bank upon and its on par with their specialties of Kebabs. Pricing is little on the higher side but in the end the food wont leave you complaining over that.

It's the new destination for mughlai cuisines with nice ambience  and good service. If you are  a mughlai cuisine lover then you must have to pay a visit to this place. A wide range of mouth watering cuisines are available here. We ordered Galuti Kebab and Murgh Pankhudi kebab for starters. Both of them were really nice in taste, specially the Galuti Kebab. For main course we ordered Dum Biryani,  and Ghost Nihari. Taste of the biryani was average if not good.  Desserts and beverages were usual. Overall it was a nice experience and will surely visit place soon for one more time.

They need to improve on the quality of service as they take a lot of time to serve the food.
Also I feel they use frozen products for their dishes.
I ordered Chapli kebab and found that it was smelly and also had some hair particles.
They should be a bit careful if they want to attract good customers...

Ahh Kareem's you beauty!!! I was super excited to visit the franchise of the famous Kareem's of Mumbai in my city and it was a brilliant experience I had. The ambience is royal and gives a typical Mughal feel. The grand entry adds to the experience. We ordered garlic Naan, gosht Pakistani and mutton dum biryani along with burhani raita. My mouth is watering as I write this review thinking of the taste. The mutton just melts in your mouth and the gravy with the perfect blend of condiments is absolute pleasure. The biryani is equally good and so is the garlic Naan. The burhani raita enhanced our eating experience with its typical flavour. The pricing is on the higher side it being a fine dining restaurant. The service is excellent with smiling waiters who are always ready to help you. Hope to visit this place very soon.

A true gem, Kareem's is a delight for the kebab lovers. Aesthetically designed, the restaurant is situated next to 10 Downing Street in sector v. The staffs are very cordial. Coming to Friday or, the half kebab platter came with 15 pieces of various chicken kebabs and the all are perfectly cooked. We also ordered fish ajwani tikka. Dice of fishes marinated with ajwain seeds, tasted heavenly. They were evenly cooked and was sumptuous. For main course we ordered gosth biriyani. I must tell that one plate is more than enough for two people. The mutton pieces were beautiful and melted in mouth. In the side dish, one must try their gosth nihari. It's unputdownable. Only thing they don't have any side dish of fish and the biriyani tastes different from the usual kolkata biriyani owing to absence of kesar. Overall loved the place. 

They are also offering buffet at a special price.

Don't order the biriyani. But rather go for the sides. Murgh lahori and butter chicken make sense here much more than the biriyani. The biriyani is neither Awadhi nor the local kolkata taste. I liked it but I am not too sure if the authentic biriyani lovers will appreciate much. Don't go for the mocktails either. The very northern setting sets the mood. Order intelligently and kareem's won't disappoint :)

The last time I went to Kareem'was in 2012in Delhi and when I saw that Kareem's had opened up in kolkata I was dying to go there
You should go have there mutton and chicken mouth watering kebabs.  The kebabs are so juicy and it tastes best with rumali roti.
And one more thing

It is almost or exactly the same as the one Delhi. 

Keep it guys. 

If I had a chance I would have given it 10/5 rating

Went to this place for first time today, and it was a marvelous experience. It's located near RDB Cinemas.

The service and hospitality was great. 

Paneer Lahori and Butter Chicken were awesome in taste. It is a must visit place for those who love North Indian food.

The ambiance was great especially the interiors.

Kareem's is the new destination for mouth watering mughlai cuisine. 
Went there for lunch on Sunday afternoon. We were expecting a have a buffet but were disappointed when the receptionist told us that buffet was not available. We were initially in a dilemma bit evwntually decided to try out their ala carte menu. And in the end we were really glad to have made that decision.
We ordered: MURGH POTLI KABAB- This was the best among all the dishes we ordered and probably one of the best dishes I have had till date. It is a kabab with chicken stuffed within balls of chicken. The moment you give the first bite it starts a riot on your tastebuds. Ddefinitely A MUST TRY.
KAREEM'S SPECIAL AFGHANI MURGH TANDOORI:  Very delicuous and succulent tandoori chicken marinated with yoghurt. 
GOSTH DUM BIRIYANI: Well about this I must say that I have had better biriyanis. The starters had really set our expectations high, But the biriyani was a bit different and didn't meet our expectations.
MURGH LAHORI: Its truly a guilty pleasure. The gravy is very rich and equally tasty. 
MALAI FIRNI : This provided us the perfect finish to a great meal. Just yummy. 
We also ordered a sweet lime soda which helped us to gulp down the food in the end as we were so full. 
So apart from the biriyani, everything was just perfect and they even made up for the biriyani. 
Ambience was nothing special compared to modern day restruants. But the space was quite large. The staffs were courteous too. The manager took care of each customer.
Also the thing which impressed me was that the price was absolutely reasonable. There are other places in the city serving good mughlai recipes but there the price is a bit too steep. But with Kareem's really managed to keep that within reasonable brackets.
Kareem's symbolizes  the royalty of Indian cuisine when continental and chinese recipes are getring so popular among the city foodies. So my recommendation will be , even if you are not a great fan of indian recipes just give this place a visit just for the sake of change of taste. And you will not be dissapointed

Any one accustomed to Kolkata biryani style will not be able to accept the style of biryani served here.also the chicken pieces served were below average in size but of quality chicken meat.SERVICE TAX BEING​ CHARGED BY THEM INFORMING CUSTOMERS THAT ITS GOVERNMENT RULES WHICH IS FAR AWAY FROM REALITY TODAY.

The last time I went to Kareem'was in 2012in Delhi and when I saw that Kareem's had opened up in kolkata I was dying to go there
You should go have there mutton and chicken mouth watering kebabs.  The kebabs are so juicy and it tastes best with rumali roti.
And one more thing

It is almost or exactly the same as the one Delhi. 

Keep it guys. 

If I had a chance I would have given it 10/5 rating

This kareem's is the Mumbai chain of restaurant of Kareem's and not to be mistaken with karim of Delhi..

This is situated in the PS srijan building in the end of GP Block in sector 5 Salt lake just beside 10 downing Street and across the RDB building having barbeque nation and chai break.

This is a new restaurant and garnered some attention among foodies across the city.

So starting the decorations ambience and look n feel, the restaurant looks amazing. The whole interiors, the lighting, the finer details which they looked into while decorating are immaculate and praise worthy. The interiors are really note worthy.

But is it enough to make it a good restaurant?? Well let's find out.

Once you're charmed into the decorations, your expectations rise a bit even higher. So this a 2 storey restaurant and family friendly environment. Groups are preferred in the top floor. So after the comfortable seating and everything you're feeling good about ends, starts the part why you're here for. Food. Menu card and choice of the best food to feed your hunger.

We chose an assortment of kebabs n plethora of dishes as there was huge group, I went together with.

The food preparation time is bit on the higher side as they take quite a long time to prepare food.

The foods they offer looks extremely amazing.

Out of the kebab the pankhudi kebab was really yumm and was the star of the menu (the only star).

The rest of the kebabs were either bland or too overpowered with flavours that the real reason of enjoying the food goes away.

Pankhudi kebab must try

Next the main course.

The gost biriyani was horrible and so was its chicken counter part.

Kabuli naan was very dry.

Chese garlic naan was Comparatively better.

The other naan items also had the same syndrome.

Coming to the side dishes

We tried many chicken dishes but none of them were tasty or spicy.

Don't mistake the food by its looks, they really look good and the presentation is nice too but taste oh my god why so tasteless.

It feels as in the whole food didn't gel together with the spices and recipe or the cooking or anything had a horrible problem, having a big mistake lying somewhere deep within them.

The deserts were bad too.
The firni was very dry, I don't know why.
AND the other things were not mention worthy.

Contrary to that the staffs are courteous and polite and helping.

Pocket pinch is on the higher side..

I don't think I will come back here.

Sorry hugely disappointed.

Well I was very excited to visit this places after the recommendations and praises I heard. 

The place is easy to find and I like the fact that it is very illuminated and is vibrant. The service is also warm and we were treated really well. 

Coming to the food. 

We ordered the veg kebab platter :

Paneer tikka was decent, not brilliant, this is usually my judge of any tandoor chef. The mushroom was nice again not brilliant. The baby corn was terrible. The marination was really nice, but the corn was dry and woody. The tandoori Gobi was beautifully cooked, tad under seasoned, but cooked very well. And the Chatpata aloo was stunning. 

Coming to nonveg, the galaoti kebab was smooth and silky in texture, it also was not overtly fragrant like most places, a big plus for that. Very well balanced and cooked to perfection. 

The naan was very average. 

The dessert was good, the Firni was silky, creamy and beautiful. The doodhi halwa on the other hand was tasty, but watery. They should use khoya instead of milk to make it, a well made doodhi halwa can be quite a show stopper. 

Place is good, perhaps the nonveg is better than the veg.

Resturent looks good but service is not worth it.This Kareem's will cost u around Rs660 bucks including all tax.Starter are good in taste.But after 1st repeat of starters they didn't provide us starters any more.Even when we asked for starters to repeat they told us it will take some time.Even after 30 minutes they didn't provide any more starters.So we need to go the maincourse section.Kareem's buffet service is that much bad that they also served the maincourse.They only provide 2 pc bone of mutton without any meat.In maincourse they provide us chicken biriyani and rara mutton and a dish of chicken in non veg.
  Now in desert, they had only 2 sweets items.One is gulab jamun and the other one is rosomalai.And the rest of desert is only fruits.

After paying around 660 Rs per head this is not worth it.I won't recommend any other to go to Kareem's if they won't upgrade their service style.

They have a very nice ambience and the service is very endearing. What fell short was the food. The biriyani is a distinct South Indian one and not the mughlai variant that kolkata digs so much.

This place should stop there buffet services asap. 
1- the staffs were very lazy miser n reluctant to serve the food, for the majority of the time we found ourselves with an empty plate waiting for the food to come.
2- the volume of soft drink they served was microscopic and they will charge you for refilling it. 
3- the food didn't taste good as well. Frm the starters to the main course n to d deserts. Everything sucked.
Ps- if u ever wanna enjoy a good buffet, pls add some more money n go to barbeque Nation situated just   opposite

Located in p.s srijan corporate park beside 10 downing street restaurant, an exquisite restaurant with plush and unique decor. I went for lunch with my colleagues and honestly we loved the decor, staffs and services. And now coming to the food the starters are amazing, we ordered one chicken pankhuri kebab, one mutton Dum biriyani, one chicken biryani. I liked the mutton biryani but the chicken biryani was not so good taste wise. The food quality is good, mutton was juicy, staffs were very polite and professional. Keeping all these in mind for them my rating would be:
Taste: 7/10 (-2 for the chicken biryani)
Quantity: 8/10
Quality: 10/10
Service: 9/10
Decor: 9/10
Price: 7/10 (little pricey in accordance to the taste of the biriyani though the starter was good)
It's was a good experience, liked the place go and visit only for their kebabs it's the best!😉

Very new joint in Kolkata, no where near to famed Kareem. Had buffet veg lunch on 1st May 2017, dis hearted with the menu, quality and service. No veg biryani served though mentioned in menu. Instead of Hari mirch paneer only butter paneer was served. All buffet food was Luke warm or cold. Menu is not balanced. Not a good place for veg foodie's.

Murgh Chapli Kabab. 5. Murgh Pankhundi Kabab.  All kabab are very delicious and mouth -watering. We also ordered some mocktail like 1. Watermelon mojito. 2. Virgin Mojito. 3. Green Apple Mojito. 4. Green Apple Mojito.  Then we took mains course like 1. Ghost Dum biriyani  2. Murgh Karachi 3. Murgh Lahori 4. Butter Naan.  Ghost Dum Biriyani is Mumbai style Biriyani.  Price is also Reasonable and Service is too much slow.

Was hearing a buzz about this place, so thought to explore... Saw it to be Kolkata's one of the famous eateries... To be honest, it's a bit hyped according to me... Beautiful ambiance and soothing, plush decor... But servicing is a little poor... Ordered some kebabs, which were outstanding... Then ordered two mutton and a chicken biriyani which they misnumbered... Though they immediately corrected their mistake, and didn't charge extra for the unordered biriyani... Also, didn't quite like the biriyani... But chicken lahori was really mouth watering.. All the staffs were pretty decent.. After the main course, thought to indulge in some Shahi tudka... But to our misfortune, they didn't have any dessert, as it was a holiday and there was a bit rush... Pricing are normal... Overall didn't have any kind of overwhelming experience (quite dissapointed, as had really high hopes), but not bad though... May try some other time as well... 😊 Ayantika Basu Arnab

Kareem's the new restaurant in town have been offering lovely mughlai cuisine. So me along with a friend of mine visited this place. It is located just beside 10 downing street and just opposite to RDB cinemas. There are different sections for a la carte and buffet. The buffet section is on the first floor. The interior was nice abd the tables were nicely arranged. 
Now to the food, the chicken and fish kebabs were just amazing, they need to work on their mutton kebabs. I specifically loved the mushroom kebab, it was very delicious. 
   In main course they had biryani, which was more like the awadhi biryani and didn't have any aloo in it. Being from Kolkata i just love my biryani with aloo but the biryani was good though. In salan i liked the paneer and mutton preps. 
 A good place to have lunch at an affordable and good buffet, will be back to try their a la carte.
P.s. A special mention to their staff who were extremely polite and well behaved and very courteous.

The place is just on the newly formed high street of Kolkata Sector V. We went there for a team lunch, and we were 13 of us. As they don't accept reservations, we were in a bit of dilemma for the availability of space. The staffs were really generous and they did manage to arrange a sitting for us all together in their rush lunch hours. The ambience would set your mood for a great food. Needless to say they serve really good starters and kabas. The soup was awesome and malia chicken kabas still have a ting on my taste buds. Going to the main course, somehow it was not as expected. The deserts was also a bit limited. A good place for food lovers and kabas addicts 😉

I went there with lot of of hope but I was disappointed. Located in an excellent place in Sector V, PS Srijan Corporate Park, right next to 10 Downing Street. Place is very beautiful, well decorated and well lit. A very good place dine out with family due to its ambiance. But the main course was biggest disappointment. Starters saved the day for us or else it would have been a disaster. Murgh Potli Kebab, Murgh Seekh Kebab, Murgh Kalimiri Kebab, Tandoori Paneer Tikka were very good. Murgh Potli Kebab was the star of the evening. Galauti Kebab was average. In main course Gosht Dum Biryani was a disaster. It was not the Biryani, Kolkatans are used to. Mutton Rogan Josh, Gosht Nihari, Murgh Karachi, Garlic Nan were average to below average. I have to mention the mutton pieces were soft which you do not find in many places. Kadhai Sabzi was ok. Another letdown were the desserts. Shahi Tukda was ok but Malai Firni was the worst Firni you could ever have. It was like Kheer (Rice Pudding). 

Ambiance- 4.5/5
Service- 4.5/5
Food- 2/5
Value for money- 2.5/5

We have tried today,
Kareem special gost biriyani,
Pees polao,
Chicken Lahori,
Chicken Karachi,
Green chillies kabab,
Kali mirch kabab,

Green apple mojito

Biriyani: Mutton is very soft and tendered with spice flavour. It's excellent. Service is also very good.

This place is located right next to 10 Downing Street in the P.S Srijan building. 
After the whole hype , I finally visited this much awaited place with my family. 
The things I loved a lot were the Mutton sheekh kebab (starter ) and Gosht Nihari , Gosht Karachi and butter chicken (main course ). 
The mutton dishes here, are to die for. 
The reason as to why I'm giving a 3 is that their service was slow and sloppy and the Malai chicken kebab had a few raw pieces of chicken which is absolutely unacceptable. 

All in all the experience was good, the interiors are beautiful and the food is good.

Went with some of my friends to this place on friday. The interiors were pretty classy and the cover layout was spacious.we went for the buffet option. They serve the starters on table. All the starters were very disappointing as they lacked flavour. One of the chicken starters was Undercooked. The only decent starter was the murg malai kebab. Maincourse dint have much option. Biryani was the saddest part of the meal as it dint taste like biryani. Desserts were okayish.
Need to work a lot on food quality if they have to compete with the likes of barbeque nations and ocean grill which are at a stone throw distance from this place.

Verdict : avoid

Just footsteps away from RDB cinema hall, this restaurant is very recently opened. Decoration is good, specious. Waiters are cooperative.

Now coming to the food:

Starter: 

Afghani tandoor: Fabulous. The best i have ever had. One full chicken is divided into 4 pieces. Beautifully marinated. I've had afghani tandoor in oudh 1590, but this one is better.

Mocktail:

Watermelon cooler:  not at all good. we asked for watermelon mojito, but the waiter informed us it's not available and suggested that we can take this instead. It was made with some kind of syrup, not fresh watermelon for sure.

Main course:

Murgh biriyani: my wife liked it. She lived in Bengaluru for 5years, and the biriyani is typical bengalorian biriyani with small pieces of chicken and curry leaves. For me, it was a disaster. I'm a kolkata biriyani lover, and doesn't like the taste of bengalorian biriyani. They told us this is lukhnow gharana, but i doubt it. If u strictly like kolkata biriyani, then this is strictly a no-no. 

Over all: from the taste of afghani murgh kebab, i'm quite sure the kebabs will be wonderful. Haven't tested chicken or mutton side dishes, but the deserve a chance.

Pocket pinch: 750/- for two.

Decor is simple yet beautiful. Spacious place. Ambience is perfect if you are with friends or family.
Heard a lot about the place, hence decided to go for the lunch buffet. 
Staff are friendly and confident. Food wise we were bombarded with various non vegetarian and vegetarian items. After tasting the items I found the Mutton Curry, Chicken Malai and Mutton Kebabs to be decent, while the Biryani was a huge disappointment as well as the Chicken curry and the veg items. In desserts only the Chocolate Icecream and the fruits were good while the Rasamalai , Chota Gulab Jamun were disappointing. I hope the food improves I wish the management well. Overall an average experience.

Go for galouti kebab and malai firni.

Galouti kebabs are unbelievably soft and tasty. Service is prompt. Biriyani is disappointing. But the mutton in biriyani again was juicy and very tasty.

Waiters seemed to be a bit under-trained. They had to call the captain for every silly query we had (from shifting tables to asking what quantity would be sufficient for our group).

Still one can forgive these small glitches just because of that Galouti Kebab.

All the dishes are pretty decent , ambience is good. But the purpose of writing the review , is the BIRIYANI  is hideously bad. Please stay miles away from the BIRIYANI. Stands no where close to Shiraz or Asalaan. Enjoy and do visit.

The AC in the second floor is pathetic . Management had shortage of food did not get the promised starters. Distribution of food is so old school that they need revisit there operation methodology.

Even though informing them a day before they were under prepared as a result we even got the first set of starters after a good 30 minutes .

The only worthy dish of the day was mutton curry.it was very good.

They have very less option (only 2) in desert

Bad experience. The quality of food is very ordinary and the service is also disappointing. For the people who look out for a theme, that too is not really appreciable.

Had a feel good factor after having the lunch buffet. Starters were very good, specially the chicken malai tikka. Fish was soft and tasty. Biryani could have been better. Desserts were like an icing on the top!! Would revisit anticipating some surprises. Overall, good, and hopeful ahead!

Sector V has new Foodie place "Kareem's". Ambiance is really good. We were opted for buffet which was 600 odd including tax. Starters are not that testy with chicken and mutton kebabs but one can eat 2-3 times. But the main course is total waste. If you want to stay with pride here in Kolkata you have to serve quality Biriyani... which is horrible at Kareem's. Other side dishes are so so. There was  only 3-4 items in deserts including hot gulab jamun, vanill ice cream with no chocolate sauce. So the overall experience is not that good. Hope they will serve better quality food in near feature.

In one word Kareem's can be termed as "Classy". Entering Kareem's can suddenly give you a super five star kinda feel.
 If you want to take your girlfriend to a beautiful dinner this is the place. 
Kareem's has a wide variety of mughlai dishes, and below each of the items a glimpse of recipe is described which is unique and nice.
Now for food, we as usual ordered Gost Biriyani, murgh Biriyani and Chiken Karachi. They are simply delicious, a little spicy which added colors to its speciality. Chiken Karachi was different yet a must try. 
Price is pretty reasonable, as you can divide a share every item, quantity is good enough.
I am definitely going there again to try other menus.

They have a buffet section which I am going to try on next office party.

Big thumbs up.

An extremely disappointing experience.. went there for buffet lunch- if you can call it a "BUFFET".  The serving staff were inexperienced and the management extremely Careless and lazy - I don't really understand if they even wanted to take up this opportunity to have a big break in such a place (they just opened).. we had a huge group of 50+ people and good experience could have easily made us give good reviews and return there again ..

1. Just after getting the seat, we noticed that the A.C was not working, and we were sweating , it was uncomfortable and suffocating- when told about this issue the management began to show their laziness and carelessness. Nothing was done to resolve the problem - only saying that the repair-person is coming.. 

2.  After getting one piece of Chicken tikka, we waited for like 30-40 mins. for another starter to arrive. Veg Starters like some potato and paneer preparation (extremely ordinary) only made the rounds. We hardly ever saw non-Veg starters after that. And even if one came our way by chance and we demanded even two pieces instead of one, we were told - "Please understand we have to give all the other people"  (WHOA!!)

3. There was no management system AT ALL. For 52 people, only 3 or 4 men were serving, rest 3 -4 people were "managing"(read 'Stood there aimlessly').

4.  Unlimited cold drinks- but you will get them HOT !!

5. After a "very nicely frustrating" experience in the starter, everyone gave up waiting for it and moved on to the Main Course.. which was another spectacle!

6. There was Chicken/Mutton Biryani - without the Chicken/Mutton in it - the reason I put a Slash (/) is because I never really got to see the meat in my Biryani (and I was too irritated to notice the name :P)

7. There was some Chicken dish (butter masala?!! ) which I cannot say for sure either, because guess what, that bowl was Empty!!!!! 

8. Next I moved on to the Mutton dish - sadly  the poor beast did not have anything to eat while he was alive, as a result he was all skin and bones (felt sorry for him though!) The lazy managers actually had no job - not even check if there is enough food in the Buffet bowls or if there are enough plates/spoons etc!

9. By now my tired and frustrated and irritated self only had some rice (without the chicken/mutton Mind you!!), raita and moved on to Dessert.

10. Dessert simply was deserted! Had nothing - some plain vanilla ice cream, roshogolla and small gulab jamuns.. but a beggar can't be a chooser.. 

There you go- my (and 51 others') experience at this nice place. Hope the team at Kareem's wake up and  change themselves - otherwise in a place of Buffet restaurants like Barbeque Nation, they will be lost forever. Try not to dupe your customers by serving the starters as late as possible so that they stop asking at one point and eat less - it is gonna ruin your business sooner or later.

It was an utter waste of our hard earned money and we will not be coming back or recommending anyone to visit this place for Buffet.

Had heard a lot about this place, since it had opened last week & decided to finally visit today. Must say a splendid meal in the city of joy! Kareem' s is a refreshing change for foodies! As it was lunch time, we opted for the buffet, being in a group of vegetarians and non vegetarians got to taste both the spreads! And I must say everything from the starters to mains to desserts were simply outstanding! Melt in the mouth kebabs and curries just right for your tatse buds! Would come back to try their al a carte next! Kudos team Kareem's. Welcome to kolkata.

To begin with "One of the WORST restaurant in Kolkata". We visited this outlet with 52 friends and each one of them were equally disgusted and frustrated. This restaurant is like a dirty crow disguished as a beautiful peacock.
All 52 of us were sweating profusely as the AC was a 70's cooler and never seemed to work. The management never seemed to bother about it and all our complaints fell on deaf ears. As per menu, 5 non veg starters were to he served. But all that we got was 3 starters and never could we see the face of the other 2. Veg-Starters? Stinky.. The fried baby corns were over marinated and were smelling when chewed. We complained about it and what we received was a more fried and spiced up baby corns to camouflage the stinking inner smell of those. Next, one thing which we had in abundance was tons of boiled tasteless potatoes with a tinge of north indian masala which were served every now and then to keep the apetite of the mass in control. Now who could agree more that if we had to have boiled potatoes and that too nearly 1 kilo each, we could have visited the best fuchkawala in kolkata instead of visiting Kareem's for lunch. Now when the starters were demanded as per the menu, the ill mannered staff was courteous enough to whoo other staff away and mention that they will be serving the starters in the next round which neve happnned. Getting the first round of hariyali chicken kabab took nearly an hour and when that arrived, our mouth refused to chew it as it was worthless.  Loosing hope when we went to the manager, the behaviour was casual and really hopeless. Tired and covered with sweat when we moved to the main course, and took to the Biriyani, buffet spread looked dissapointing as the container had only biriyani rice and no pieces of chicken. Utterly dissapointing. We waited and when the coveted pieces of chicken arrived we found that the taste was not even worth a roadside biriyani stall. After taking two spoons of biriyani and not being able to tolerate the ill fated lunch, to end this trauma quickly I moved to the deserts which was more dissapointing that ever. The rasogollas were hard and gulab jamuns were smaller than a brainvita glass ball (if you know what i mean). Ice cream was missing. Waitied for ice cream for a while and when it arrived it dissapointed us as it was just plain vanilla ice cream without any sauses or toppings.
Overall, it was a traumatic experience at this unfortunate place.
With Barbeque nation, 10 Downing Street and Chai Break around, its not long before they cry out loud with their service team and choice of location for their restaurant. Overall again, the most frustrating and worthless restaurant in kolkata I have ever visited till date. :(

Kareems - A decent experience.
=====
Location & Intro:

Kareem's is located at Sector 5 near Great Broaster Chicken. To be more precise,  It is located in GP block 5, Plot G-2 i.e. minutes walk from Barbq Nation. 

I had been to Kareem's just few days back to try out their Kebabs and Biriyani. It is to be noted that this is the Bombay Kareem's and not the Delhi Karim's. I went with my family to try out this place. As i entered Kareem's, i was mesmerised with the beautiful ambiance and the chandeliers. It has a ground floor and a first floor. I took my seat in the ground floor and started stalking the a la carte. The a la carte is quite nicely designed and thereafter, started placing my order.
=====
What I ordered:

○ Kareem's Special Murgh Tandoori - The Tandoori Kebab was succulent, juicy and tasted very different from the Kolkata Tandoori. I loved it. #musttry

○ Paneer Lahori with Tandoori Roti- Cottage cheese cooked with masalas imported from Lahore. That's what the Kareem says. I did find the masala quite unique and was very different from the one we get in the city of joy. Loved it. My mom is also a critic when it comes to good and tasty food but she as well seemed to have enjoyed on this one.  #musttry

The Tandoori Roti's were very ordinary. Nothing so special about it. 

○ Murgh Dum Biriyani (Kareem's Special) with Raita- I did not like it. It was a DISASTER. The biriyani had few chicken pieces in it which lacked the spicy taste as well as the marination. They had added a potato to it so that it can satiate the taste buds of the people of Kolkata but sadly the potato tasted just like boiled potato and was lacking that flavour which we all were expecting. On asking the staff, he said its lucknowi biriyani which clearly indicates that no aloo should have been strictly added then. The Raita was average. 
===== 
Meal for two: 600-1500 approximate. Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc. 
=====
Pros:
• Good ambiance. (Special mention: Crockery's and Furniture)
• Quality Food.
• Hygiene is maintained. 

Cons:
• Staffs are not trained properly. They are scared and shaky and does not have much knowledge about food items.
• Biriyani need to be improvised and worked on a lot. 
• I found it a bit expensive. 
=====
Summary:

Food Presentation 3.8/5

Food Quality 3.8/5

Food Quantity 3.7/5

Taste 3.7/5

Hospitality 3.4/5

Ambiance 3.7/5

Hygiene 3.7/5

Value for money 3.4/5
=====
Expert Suggestions:
○ Train your staffs properly so that they are aware about the items. 
○ Keep all the items on the menu. Many dessert items and main course items were not available when i went. 
=====
Conclusion: 

It was a decent experience at Kareem's. I had high expectations but would highly suggest everyone not to order Murgh Biriyani (kareem's special) here. You will be highly disappointed like me. Nevertheless, Kebabs are worth it.

Huge expectation ended up with disappointment! First of all AC was not working and nobody cared for that until everyone of our 50+ people group started asking. The welcome drink and starters did not reach all the tables. After much noise we could manage only 3 non-veg starters out of the promised 5. They were more than keen to serve the veg starters but we were not interested of course. The main course finished after hardly 30 people have taken from it and they refused to refill. We could only get rice of mutton biriyani and hardly a piece of mutton and raita. Finally the desserts were again very simple, gulab jamun, rasgulla and vanilla ice cream. We definitely expected more from such renowned chain. The manager and staffs were visibly having a hard time arranging for 52 people.

I don't know where to start.... We went to Kareem's for office Lunch with full of expectations. We went for buffet lunch. Ambience is quite good, well decorated, well color combinations... . But The service was worst.... A/C did not work,  food quality is good but service was quite disappointing... Every time we need to ask the waiter to provide the food.... Next instead of 5 non-veg starter  they only provide 3 and every time we need to ask for the staters.... Now for main course also, the service was same... Very well organised and full of mismanagement.

We went for office lunch party with 52 people. The AC was not working. We had our lunch without ac in such a hot and humid weather. Food quantity is not bad but management was worst. Most of the people got 3 veg starter and 3 non veg starter instead of 5 each. If you ask for repeat,they cook and serve the item. That means you have to wait for 30 min for that item. Sometime they didn't even serve that item. Also they denied to serve more than 1 piece at a time. In main course if any item is finished,you have to tell them to bring that item. Otherwise nobody bother. 
Overall experience is not good. If you are going as a team think before choosing this place.

Well...After hearing so much about this newly opened restaurant, I had to visit this place with my family. As we entered this place... I was amazed to see the decor and the ambience! It has been very tastefully done! Now coming to the food...I just cannot stop drooling when i think of it! The chicken tangdi and the Afghani tandoori were to die for! So soft and cooked to perfection! The biryani was also quite different and delicious!! The mutton Karachi is also something worth mentioning!! Now coming the desserts, we had ordered all three of them...Doodhi Ka halwa, Dhabi tukda and malai firni!! I can't explain, how amazing they were!! Overall...It was a great experience for us and will surely visit them again!! They surely have a long way to go!!!

Well after hearing quite a lot of buzz about this placed we decided to give it a try yesterday. We opted for the non veg buffet option. What seemed to be promising from the decor and ratings in Zomato ended up falling flat on its chest. There were 5 veg and non veg starters out of which only the murgh tikka masala is worth mentioning. The chicken yakhni sorba was also a gud touch. But after that there not much to impress the platter. Biriyani was too dry for our taste. mutton dabba was still better among the main course. And the deserts were quite disappointing.

See the booming food joint that sector V has become we expect quite a lot from newly opened joints. There are plenty of other buffet options you get in this area at this price, so in order to emerge into a successful brand among competition you have to have something special to offer your customers which was sadly missing. Even more when your namesake is a runaway success in Delhi. People builds in a lot of expectations from a new place, you may not provide a lot of variety but the taste should be impacable in the limited selections you provide, which this place sadly lacks. 

Their service though is very effeciant and courteous. Only if the food was half as good as their service, this would have been a different story altogether.

Went to kareem,s on 15th april ...at around 2.50pm... most of the items espcl starters were not available as they were over... this was not informed when I asked for buffet.. thus I was charged for the entire buffet but without having all the items as per the buffet menu...
The food overall is ok.. Nothing exceptional.. would rather recommend bar b q nation next door..
The staff was rather hesitant to serve... every request took 10..15 mins...
In this competitive market tough to survive.. from buffet point of view

Decided to visit Kareem's on Poila Boisakh after reading the good reviews here. It's very easy to locate, right in the middle of Sector 5. The restaurant is very brightly lit up with chandeliers and done up in bright shades of white,blue ,green. Seating is comfortable. We ordered Watermelon and Green Apple Mojito for drinks. Both were well made drinks. The watermelon drink scores more points because of its freshness. The chicken platter was ordered as a starter. It had 15 pieces of assorted kebabs of various types. A good starter, although some of the kebabs could have been a bit softer. We had the Gosht Dum Biryani, Murgh Dum Biryani and Chicken Kadhai special for the main course. It is here that me and my friends simply dug in and ate with a smile on our faces because the food was quite impressive. The Gosht biryani blew us away. The rice was a bit tangy and flavourful with a potato in it, the mutton pieces in the biryani were very very soft. Totally loved this biryani. The Murgh biryani was also well made but it wasn't as good as the Gosht one. The Kadhai Chicken was very tasty indeed. Although it was oily, the blend of spices and the thickness of the gravy paired very well with the biryani. The biryanis come with complimentary raita which was also a bonus. But the one area where Kareem's completely lacked was at service. Although there were ample waiters they were extremely slow,at everything! Taking and bringing our orders, an order of a drink came 25-30 min later, and they kind of forgot to give us the bill even though we asked for it thrice. Apart from this glitch, the experience was a good one. Recommended!!

Kareem's was a wonderful experience last evening. Starting from the interiors to the cutlery, everything has been very aesthetically done. Coming to the food, the main attractions were the melt in the mouth kebabs. Special mention goes to Chicken Potli Kebab, Chicken Pankhudi kebab and Mutton Barrah Chaap. Very innovative and bursting with flavours. Raan biryani is a must try for all Biryani lovers. Mutton was soft and succulent. Would love to go back to try their other offerings!! :D

I had visited this venue on a week day for Lunch buffet and I must comment the food was commendable, specially a special mention for the mutton in main course was soft tender and really of good quality.
The taste for all the food items tasted great and was really good, except for the deserts which I felt was less specially vanilla ice cream without chocolate sauce and Rash malai tastes a bit less sweet.
However this place is a must try for kebab lovers!!
Pcitures enclosed!!

1.) Kebab platter( Chicken tikka, chicken reshmi, Fish Ajwaini)
2.) Biriyani, Sukha Mutton, chopper onion and cucumber with fruits
3.) Veg Kebab platter ( Paneer, Corn, mushroom, Cauliflower)
4.) chicken reshmi and mutton kabab

Kareem's sector 5 Kolkata is an interesting food joint. While it stands at par in ambience,  it's buffet spread is not that promising. 
It promises to serve succulent kebabs,  but unfortunately,  most of the them were too chewy and dry. The Chicken Malai kebab was stale and had a weird taste to it.  However,  the Fish Tikka and Mutton seekh kebab were good.
Moving on to the Main course,  the Chicken Biryani and Mutton Kali Mirch were the 2 dishes I liked. The rest of the dishes are considerable. 
The Dessert section had no "Spread" of choices. Plain Vanilla ice cream,  mini gulab jamuns and fruits. That was it ! Now That's a disappointment for someone with a sweet tooth. 
Well all said, there is always a scope for improvement.  Hey its new ND still promising.

Recommended by fellow foodies, I decided to visit this place with a bunch of close friends on the bengali new year's day. 
Well first of all, this place is well decorated with bright lightings, chandeliers and has two floors. 
Food is good, at par with other famed Indian/Mughal restaurants in thr city. We took the Watermelon Mojito and Green Apple mojito for drinks. Those were wonderful.We took a  Chicken Kebab Platter(15pcs) for starters. Good assortment of kebabs, although the meat could have been softer perhaps. 
For main course we were suggested the Gosht Dum Biriyani (Kareem's special) and Chicken Kadai for sides. So we took it. The biriyani was light, mutton pieces in it were so very soft and it had good flavors, so I loved it ! The chicken kadai was pretty tasty as well, but had too much oil, but I guess that doesn't matter if the overall dish is great. 
One point to add here is that the service is painfully slow. Like even the drinks came almost hlf hour after ordering ! So have enough time on your hands when you visit this place. Everything else is satisfactory.

The interiors were classy and the food was way too delicious specially the Kareem's special murg tandoori and doodhi halwa. Service was a bit slow, but this restaurant totally worth a visit.

Visited the very talked about Kareem's today. The decor was lovely and so was the ambiance. I tried the Murgh Seekh Gilafi Kebab and Gosht Chapli Kebab, they were good but should have been more Spicer. Spiciness (teekhapan) is the essence of kebabs so it would be great if they are a bit more spicy.The Dum Gosht Biryani (Kareem's special) was not what every biryani lover would like to have. It needs to be worked upon. People who love Kolkata biryani would not like it as it serves Mumbai based biryani.  And special mention to the chass, it was fantastic! The service was good as well. Definitely gonna visit again and try the other things on the menu. :)

Great new place to be in. Green apple fizz, Dahi chicken, chap fry and dal are fab. Desserts, doodhi halwa & firni are to die for. Missed the galouti kebab. will visit again.

A beautiful addition to Kolkata's food culture. The Legend from Chandni Chowk, Delhi is here. I had come to know of it recently and planned to have lunch there along with my fiance.

The decor and ambience is beautiful and very upscale. It's a 2 storied place with the ground floor being for Ala carte and the 1st floor for buffet.

Its located near RDB Boulevard, just beside 10 Downing Street and is a must visit place for people who love Mughlai and Awadhi cuisine.

The buffet spread was not too elaborate but all the dishes were delicious and if you ask me it's pretty no nonsense menu . I mean , it has all the dishes which are instantly liked by the diners and I was happy beyond imagination.

The highlights of the buffet was the Achari Murg, The Kali Mirch Gosht, the Biryani and the Yellow Dal Tadka.

The starters had awesome kebabs and I loved most of the Kebabs on offer. The best in Veg being the Mushroom and in Non Veg the Fish Tikka and the Mutton Seekh Kebab.

I would love to try out the. Ala carte menu on my next visit. Thanks again Kareems for being in the City of Joy.

A very nice introduction to Kolkata and it's restaurants, I stumbled upon Kareems. Loved the ambience,well maintained wash rooms, services,cutlery most importantly the food. Do try the mutton biriyani, firni ( I forgot to take pictures), murg lahori, ghost karachi,tutyfrooty, caramel custard. Kebabs are amazing.
The restaurant is much value for money.

Visited yesterday with family. The place is in sector 5 infront of RDB. Now coming Back to the resturant and its food.  I would like to give rating in minus as the food was pathetic. 
We order chicken tamduri which was not even washed and cooked properly, the blood was dripping when we had taken bite of the dish. 

Then we order Biryani which was actually not biryani. It was rice and chicken, nothing was there. The taste was disgusting. I would suggest the ppl to not to go there.

Mutton keema was yummy a must try for all. Over all loved the ambience of the place and the staff was very cordial. Although they should be little fast in serving the kebabs for ala-carta.

A new place in town. Lovely ambience, great service, good staff. But the most importantly the food I'd worth mentioning. There were 5 starters non veg and veg. The chicken was soft and tasty. Specially the malai chicken. The veg starters good too. Both the mushroom and babycorn. The main course was less and very Good. The Hyderabadi biriyani was so good. The mutton was so soft and good. The shorba too was nice. The lauki ka kheer was brilliant. The gulab jamun was crisp and dry. Overall the food was very light and full of flavors. Loved it and would come down again soon.

I had huge expectations from this restaurant and I must say I was not disappointed! The food was good in taste and justfied the restaurant's specialization in mughlai delicacies! Though I did feel that the portions were a little shrunk but the food was overall satisfying. I also feel that the service was a bit slogging and that needs to be speed up!

The ambience the view decoration was great. Food was great too but lacked some punch of flavours. The starter was great specially the fish. The mushrooms in veg was awesome.  But only thing it lacked was the speed of serving. But that was covered by unlimited soft drinks. Pocket friendly and a must visit place.

Kareem's coming to Kolkata got me all excited! Went there for dinner. Ordered Peach and elderflower Iced Tea, Watermelon Mojito, Pomfret Tandoor, Chapli Kabab, the Special Mutton Biriyani, Doodhi Halwa, Malai Firni. Excellent food, though the biriyani is different from usual Kolkata Biriyani it was very good. The addition of potato in the Biriyani seems to be specially done for Kolkata. The best part of the meal was the desserts specially the doodhi halwa. The service was great too, the staff were very pleasant. And the prices were pretty reasonable too definitely not overtly priced.

Finally visited Kareem's, situated beside 10downing street. The ambience is very nice. Very well decorated, staffs are pretty well behaved. As far as food is concerned, quality is good. Murgh biriyani was okayish...could have been bettee. Murgh karachi was really really good, a must try. The best thing is the malai firni, i am an ardent firni lover and I haven't tasted such an amazing firni in kolkata till date. They tasted very very good. A must try. Overall a good experience. Neither very expensive...nor very cheap, it was worth the money.

Went on 11th of April for a team lunch, however not have a pleasant experience. It's a new restaurant and specialized in kebabs and Biryanis...... And we tried both of them. Let's talk about the restaurant and the food served there:- 
1. The only positive part of this restaurant is its Ambiance...... However ACs are too chill, at around 18  degree. 
2. Almost has to sit for an hour to get our ordered food, which is a special mutton biryani and chicken Tikka masala. 
3. The portion was 
good but was served cold and believe me biryani was totally a failed preparation, I doubt how can they call themselves specialist in Biryani. I will give more points  to the street biryani then what was served to us. 
4. Chicken Tikka gravy was good but chicken was hard. 
5. The Raita served with our food was not seasoned properly and it was taste as sour curd only. 
6. Again it took half an hour to receive the bill after we complete our food. 
7. Also to add, that I tried to get detail of there buffet, but the waiter ignore my query. 
So after this 7points I don't feel I will again like to visit that restaurant again. Thanks

Anyone who wishes to taste one of kolkata's best Mughlai/North Indian cuisine must visit Kareem's kolkata (Sector V, Salt Lake). I have visited them twice already and each time have had a wonderful experience. All the dishes that I had tasted, were delicious and kept me wanting for more. The gosht biryani was exquisite. The kebabs were soft and yummy. The desserts that I had tried were firni and doodhi halwa, both so delicious that it made the perfect sweet ending to a lovely meal. The ambience of the restaurant is as good as it's food. Keeping everything in mind, I cannot rate kareem's kolkata anything below '5'. A must visit for every foodie in kolkata.

Kareem's was a great experience. Their kebabs are top notch, they have the softest and creamiest Reshmi malai kebab, which will make anyone go back for more. Their Kareem's special mutton biriyani is different yet one of the tastiest biriyani one will find in the city. The decoration is perfect, it's not dark hence one can see what one is eating!! They have the most hospitable staff. All the desserts are mouth watering. For any Firni lover, their's is a must try.

Some of my favourites are Gosht Barra Chap, Chap fry, Murg Malai tikka, Gosht seekh kebab...and the list goes on! Being a biryani lover, i can truly say that it has got one of the most amazing biryanis!! It is just the perfect blend of all the spices!! Oh yes.... how could i forget about the best part... desserts!!! I would definitely like to give a special mention to the stars of the show...'Malai firni', 'Shahi Tukda' and 'Doodhi ka halwa'!! I can bet this place has the best malai firni in town. I have actually fallen in love with this place and would surely keep coming back for satiating my taste buds!!

One work : Pathetic!!
I went for Buffet and what is the worst that could happen....Well the food was rotten!! Kebab's were smelling foul...So bad that I literally threw off the whole meat back on plate from my mouth! I was not able to take even a single bite!!
I asked waiter to check what's wrong....After 20 mins he came back with new set of Kebab equally rotten!!! I lost my appitite by then. I asked one of the person from management as how can such rotten food land on plate!? And his reply was that no one else is complaining!! I was taken aback on his comments....I had no time to get into argument with him as I was in hurry so went straight for the modest main course..... Meanwhile​ I saw few others also started complaining about rotten food...At the end came the tandoori chicken which was not smelling but had no taste but the fact it was not smelling was enough for me to have a piece of it. 
All these while no one came to check on me and I was charged with the full buffet where I had no starters....Yes a Buffet with no starters and no sense of apology!!!
Never again!!!

A gem of a place. Thinking it was a Delhi counterpart we went there for lunch. It is mind blowing. From the interiors to the ambience to the food to the service. Everything was top notch. We ordered a murgh karachi and it was great. Kind of reminded us of the original one. Also we ordered a chicken korma and it was also good. The only downside is the quantity. But please go out there and have a fun time. Highly recommended.

Ordered their mutton biriyani and chicken Hari Mirch kebab. The meat both in the biriyani and the kebab was succulent and prepared well. The service was prompt and the food was hot. 
Maybe I am biased because of my obsession with Kolkata biriyani, this biriyani is different albeit nice but it's hard for someone like me to value it over Kolkata biriyani. 
What I really liked about this place is the raita that came along with biriyani did not have excess sugar in it. Overall a pleasant experience.

This new restaurant has an amazing decor & even better service.
The moment you will walk through that gate you will be able to get that royal feeling.
The manager & the staff actually come to you for the feedback & keep asking whether you are comfortable or not! Such hospitality in today's world is tough to find! They actually feels sorry & apologises if there is any sort of delay. Considering they are extremely new & there are so many guests I totally understand if there is a little delay but they totally compensate it with their quality food & service💖
Coming to the food, it's Indian cuisine but the taste is so so different, its surely not the boring Indian food. 
The must haves:
1. GOSHT PAYA SHORBA : yummiest shorba ever. 
2. MURGH MALAI TIKKA : it literally melts in the mouth
3. ⭐️MURGH POTLI KEBAB: this i am sure I haven't eaten anywhere else. Its chicken keema with spices inside a chicken ball & it creates a fantastic blast in your mouth😉!!
4. MUSHROOM TIKKA & BUTTER GARLIC MUSHROOM : even if u r a nonveg, i bet u wont be able to resist them.
5. AFGHANI TANDOORI MURGH : never thought tandoori chicken can be so soft & yes white in colour!!!!
6.⭐️GOSHT CHAAP FRY : it totally reminds me of bengali kobiraji & the meat is so tender!!
7. ⭐️GOSHT BARA CHAAP: these are mutton ribs & trust me i have never had such soft melt in mouth mutton with bone even in my favourite 5 star restaurants also!!
8. ⭐️ DUM KI DAL :this was magic. I mean after having this dal i am sure i will never like kali dal of any other place
9. GOSHT NIHARI : just wowwww!!
10. ⭐️GOSHT KARACHI : apparently this is their one if the signAture dish & totally justified when they say so!
11. ⭐️GOSHT DUM BIRIYANI : well i am very sensitive about biriyani & don't like when anyone make changes to it. Though this biriyani is different from the normal Kolkata biriyani but it is so damn delicious. I guess i can go back here only to have this biriyani. Its extremely yummy❤️

And yes not just the savoury dishes: you so cant leave this place without trying their deserts: 
1. Malai Phirni: i guess this is the best in town
2. Shahi Tukda : perfect balance of sweetness!!
3. Doodhi halwa: can't believe they have actually managed to create something so amazing out of the boring Doodhi🤣

Also do try their mocktails, they are such a relief in this summer!!
1. Cucumber cooler 
2. Watermelon Mojito

and this place have a super elaborate buffet lunch spread at an amazing price which i guess i will try this week for sure!!

Keep up the good job guys👍🏼. Will soon return with more friends & family to enjoy rest of your amazing preparations💛

This is one good restaurant,probably best in the locality and one of the best in Calcutta ❤️ The kebab platter is terrific and so is the mutton chap fry which is nostalgic for any bengali coz it will remind you of kabiraji and the best was obviously the biryani 😭 It was so damn tasty like wow 😍 Chicken tikka biryani is a must try with very generous portions and reasonable price when you compare the food and location and the brand that is Kareem's ❤️

Visited kareems today to give small birthday party to my family members. As i am regular with delhi kareems and i much fan of kebab n murg biryani we ordered same food over here and was we'll satisfied with tge quality n taste of the food.

But one thing was really disappointing which made my whole party spoiled, we ordered 4-Mojito of different flavours and one was served in broken glass which was not acceptable at all as it's a new outlet just started couple of days back. Need to focus specially on service n quality which will be affected on services n will spoil the reputation of the brand.

Visited kareems today (07/04/17) for a team lunch with office colleagues. We were around 16-17 people. Being a Friday I had anticipated the rush that would be there in lunch hours so i made a reservation over phone and the process was seamless and i even got a system generated sms confirming the same. We reached on time and saw a huge rush and many people were waiting outside, but they had kept three tables reserved for us and we walked in like a boss :)
Now coming to the place and ambiance.. the place is relatively small with a mezzanine floor dedicated only for buffet..but we went for alacarte and were seated downstairs. The decor is good and the staffs are very polite and very respectful towards customers. But being their first Friday after inauguration they seemed to be unprepared for the rush from the offices in the area. There was a total chaos and they took close to 1.15 hours to bring our food after several reminders. Many people seemed to be pissed off because of this thing. Even we at one point decided to leave but somehow their manager calmed and consoled us and requested us to give them some time as there was huge rush beyond their expectations.
Coming to the food we divided ourselves in veg and nonveg eating peoples. We ordered various items the list was long some dishes worth mentioning is the chicken potli kebab, now this is a must have...its one of its kind. Chicken stuffed with minced chicken and cashew and other spices with a hint of hungcurd and roasted in tandoor. We ordered their king size tandoori platter (30 pieces of kebab) and all of them were very delicious. One thing to note is all their kebabs were soft and juicy from inside big thumbs up for that. We even ordered the chicken and mutton Dum Biryani which was also good (hold your guns)... i being a die hard Kolkata Biryani fanatic will obviously claim that kareems Biryani was nowhere near to our Biryani..but lets be honest their Biryani is also good and it's completely of different character and style so lets not make any comparisons. Their manager even said that they had to forcefully add potato in their Biryani dish on special demand from kolkatans :D Another dish in the main course which i liked was murgh Karachi..i don't like mutton so can't comment on the mutton dishes but fellow colleagues were all praise for those dishes too.... The veg people also claimed that veg food was also delicious special mention to their starters and Dum ki daal which even i tastes and really liked. The only problem was their Naan wich was very hard and rubberish and was difficult to chew.
The Total bill (after 10℅ discount) was 6600 only Which is very reasonable considering the number of people we were.

Note to the management: You are new in the block and have lots of potential. Being in the hub of Sector 5 you need to be well prepared for mad rush (specially during lunch hours)... Reduce the average time taken for the dishes to be served.
And keep serving with a smile.
Water droplets were dropping from the air-conditioning duct above our tables tough it wad not so frequent but can create big problem later... Please fix that.

Food: 4/5
Service: 2/5 ( can improve on this front for sure)
Overall: 3.5/5

All the best..!!

Went down to Kareem's today to meet a friend - they have an excellent buffet scene for a really nice price point, and my friend availed that. I checked out the a-la-carte menu, and picked the burrah kabab and the mutton biryani. One word of caution - this is the Mumbai Kareem's so those of you who are looking for the Karim's in Delhi would be disappointed. Also, don't expect this biryani to be like Kolkatan - its a proper Mumbaiah version, straight down to the green chillies cooked with the really soft meat. What I loved was the quality of the meat - really soft and well-cooked. I intend to get back for their Chapli Kabab soon!

Kareem's,a new name in the city of joy and strategically located in the corporate area of sector 5 srijan tech park is not only amazing in look and ambience but also in their mouthwatering food. Since I have office in sector 5,just went there today itself ie the second day after opening.Upon entering we were greeted with the eyecatching ambience,the classy decor and the friendly and courteous staff.The restaurant has 2 floors.For starter,we had the murgh potli kebab on recomendation from their staff and we were amazed by the awesome use of spices,its basically minced chicken stuffed in chicken marinated with special spices.Next came the gosht dum biriyani kareem's special which is a lucknowi style biriyani.The mutton pieces in the biriyani were soft and cooked to perfection.Would definately come back again to try their buffet and other signature dishes.The staff were very friendly and courteous and every now and then enquired about the food and asked for suggestions if any.Kareem's will definately be my favourite place in a while.

The restaurant started today. Went to place in the evening for take away. As expected most of the menu items are not available today. Eventually I asked them to provide me the items as per their choice.
Finally they decided:
Dum Ke Chawal
Chicken Rogan Josh (not in the menu, claimed as their signature dish, but unfortunately the chicken was not fresh and had smells, quite unexpected on the very first day of a restaurant.
Murgh malai Tikka
The last one was the only good one out of these three. 
Ambiance of the restaurant is good. But Food quality is just average.

We had Gosht seekh kebab which was awesome in taste, texture, juicy from inside and not dry. Also the outside was crispy. Presentation of the dish cool and mouth watering. Then we had Tandoori Promfet perfectly cooked and the masala was of great taste, this is one of the rare dishes available in restaurants. And presentation was again mouth watering. Then in main course we had Gosht Dum Biriyani which was not that awesome. Also suggestd them what can be improved. In side dish we had Murg Lahori againg mid range taste a common gravy not exception. Now the dessert we orederes Malai Firni and Shahi Tukda, both awesoem and a pleasure to the taste buds. Malai firni is a must try if u visit this place. 
Overall experience was good .. Ambience very classy .. Service very prompt and  friendly .. They even took suggestion from us  .. Nice joint .. We did not have buffet , will try tht also later .. Very good and convinient place for Corporate team lunch .. And family dinning or dinner a relishing touch .. Will very soon and taste other dishes ....

I don't know if I am the one reviewing Kareem's Kolkata in Zomato or somebody else had already done that but it was sheer pleasure for food quality. Well it was a team lunch. Experis IT. Whole CSC team was there. Occasion was to give Mr. Selva Kumaran Kanhaiyon a treat for being with us as a SPOC for CSC for last 4 years and he's leaving the company. He is here to visit Kolkata. Kareem's is a place to be. Well, it was a buffet. I won't tell you the menu cause it was unlimited and a very large menu to tell. A few food items is must have. 1. Hariyali Chicken Starters.
2. Mushroom starter. 3. Biriyani. 4. Malai firni. 5. Gulaab Jamoon. 
What else, don't wait and bang on the table. ;)
