Great value for money! The outlet lacks space but the quality of food will make you taste it for the second time :) Good delivery service too.

I have mostly ordered for dinner from this eatery, after shifting to our new apartment at Poddarnagar. They deliver quick, and the packaging is clean and hygienic too. The food is totally value-for-money, and tasty. I love their variations of paneer, i.e, Aloo matar paneer and palak paneer. Had ordered for their veg meal and egg meal as well, and the quantity of food (including the main dish+ rice+ aloo bhaja+ dal+extra curry) is pretty much filling for one person. This place is thus a good, affordable option for working women or single people who stay alone and are not that efficient in cooking, or lack the time and energy to do so.

Really ghar ka khana aur mere ghar ke pass bhi. Only place where u wud get food so cheap around south city. The place is small but hygienic, doesn't really matter, as i get the food packed. Service is good but slow, Plays music. Other small joints nearby are very dirty, thus, go for this. The Best. Serves Sunfeast pasta toooo.

Good food. But the sitting place is very small. Only 5 people can sit at a time. A bit noisy. But as we do not have any choice coz no other rice meal restaurant are their in the radius so we stuck in their for lunch.
