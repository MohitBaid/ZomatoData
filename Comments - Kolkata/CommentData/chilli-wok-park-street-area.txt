Year end, let's party !! Located at quite a popular area of park street, it is accompanied by OTT & MyX as two of its other peers in the same building.
Went there with my bff for a celebration at around 7 p.m we found that OTT was full and MyX has'nt opened up yet. So we had only this place as an option to try.
This restaurant serves purely chinese and obviously alcohol also. 
We tried Four Treasure Exotic Vegetable with Ginger Wine and Veg Hakka Noodles. Former was a new and a good one and can be given a try whenever you visit.

Pros - Environment, Cleanliness, Staff, Service.
Cons - Still to find !

Keep up the good work guys !

Any feedback would be highly appreciated.

Chilli Wok is located at the second floor of Myx building, which is located just beside KFC making it easily accessible.

Wonderfully decorated place makes you feel like you're actually in China. Long back-rest chair are well cushioned and Chinese letters imprinted on it. Wooden walls are engraved with Chinese letters. The place is decorated with Chinese artwork and handcraft. Combining all that with well blended dim-lit yellow light, this place gives you a feel of perfect elegance.

Coming to the food, we only picked from their Chinese menu. Heard they have added a lot of pan-asian and continental dish recently which I would try on my next visit.

*Soup*
Chicken sweet corn soup 4.5*
Wonton clear soup 4*
Chicken sichuan soup 4.5* (bit more intense garlic flavor)

*Starter*
Drunken fish 2.5*
Yue yang spicy barbecued fish 3.5*
Wok tossed crispy lemon honey chicken 3* (way too sweet)

*Main Course*
Kung Pao Chicken 4.5*
Chandu Style Chicken 4*

*Staples*
Burnt garlic fried rice 2.5* (Pretty much ordinary fried rice)
Fried rice with sausage 4*

*Dessert*
Darshan with vanilla ice cream 3.5* (Darshan should be bit less sweeter)
Hot chocolate roll 3.5* (Minimum serving quantity)

*Mocktail*
Blue lagoon (Lime soda with blue color, nothing different)
Lime soda

Serving time is longer than usual, we had to wait plenty of time for the next item to arrive. Very generous and prompt behavior from staffs, they also recommends dish personally.

Today we had a scrumptious lunch at Park Street  Chilli Wok.  We have ordered Fish in barbecue sauce, prawn in plum chilli sauce, konji lamb,  thai mixed fried rice, chocolate roll. We ordered chef's special and Shirley's temple mocktail. Main course and starter was lips smacking. Mocktails were very refreshing. But we find the chocolate roll bit dry.  It would have been best to be served with a scoop of ice cream. Overall it is very good experience.

Chilli Wok is a famous name in the Park Street area and it is all set with its new menu which is officially going to be available from 2018 January; however for time being the dishes from the new menu can be enjoyed on special request. Chilli Wok attracts people mostly because of the quality of food they serve and the ambience which is soothing, eye catching and classy. This place can accommodate 35-40 people easily.
                                                                ...

Chilli Wok is not a new name for the lovers of Chinese Cuisine in the City of Joy, as they've made quite a mark for themselves through all these years with some of the most authentic oriental dishes, in the truest sense of the word. To carry forward their legacy, a new menu has been curated by them which aims to bridge the gap between Oriental, Continental and Indian cuisines. So, when I was presented with an opportunity to take a plunge into this, the whole idea seemed fresh and innovative. But what attracted me the most, was their approach to food on an aesthetic level, that is, presenting each and every item in a manner which will trigger one gastronomically and make the food seem organoleptic. It is needless to say, all the items tasted equally great and had me impressed in no time. Here's what all I got my hands on -

IN CHINESE CUISINE >>

•Oriental herb flavoured broth with filled dim sum
•Baked tofu with doughnuts and two peas Hakka noodles
•Wok tossed stuffed chicken with Thai sauce and Noodle Aglio Olio
•Curry flavoured couscous noodles, Prawn three way and Potato salad

IN CONTINENTAL CUISINE >>

•Potato and fennel tartare, sesame coated spinach cottage cheese patty, parcel herbed rice
•Spinach, potato, asparagus, goat cheese with fresh greens, pickle, cherry, tomato salad

IN INDIAN CUISINE >>

•Murgh nazakat
•Kofta de lahori
•Murgh chupa rustam
•Machli lollipop kofta malai
•Royal Kashmiri phaldhari pulao
•Bharwan cheese paneer lazeez tandoori

DESSERT >>

•Choco mango molten with strawberry basil ice cream and gulab jamun cheesecake

So, hold on to your seats for a little longer, as this new menu's going to be up on the cards officially from January 2018. I'm sure the experience will be worth the wait. But if your patience breaks loose, then you can make a special request and dig into the new menu. Bon appétit! :)

Murgh Nazakhat-  It is a starter kind of dish where the outer layer is of chicken and the inner layer is of minced meat. The combination of these two is so great that while having a bite you will get the taste of these two making it a deadly combination. The inner portion is perfectly cooked and way tasty.

Royal Kashmiri phaldhari pulao-  The rice cooked with sweet ingerdients and some fruits like pomegranate and pineapple. The preparation was light and good but may not be fruitful for fruit haters.

Bharwan cheese paneer lazeez tandoori-  Basically Cottage Cheese being tandoored in an oven with tandoori ingredients.

Curry flavoured cous cous noodles, prawn three way and potato salad- In this dish three things being included ie; Noodles, Prawn and  Mashed Potato. The preparation was good. The noodles and prawn was perfectly cooked. Prawn cooked separately was really delicious.

Went to this place on a Saturday. Was surprised to find this place absolutely empty. We tried the Burmese soup, which was excellent. I strongly recommend it. Then we the veg Sushi platter which was good. The three mushroom wine tasted like baby corn and was good. The main course was a bit average. The quantity of food was really good and the service was also good. Overall, this place is worth a try.

Located just opposite peter cat, beside kfc in park street, this place is a heaven for chinese cuisine lovers. I have been here thrice and everytime they have amazed me.. the ambience is very decent, with some oriental touch and soft oriental music, dimly lit giving a very nice look. The staffs are extremely courteous and helpful, specially i would mention about Mr.Prosenjit, he is extremely friendly and helpful. Now coming to the food, the best part about this place is, if you taste 10 different dishes, you can distinguish each taste as they are very unique, which is often not the case for a lot of food joints. Previously i had ordered a la carte and both the chicken and fish dishes have impressed me a lot, specially their recommended yuxiang shredded chicken and lat me kai.
But during durga pujo they served buffet for 750+taxes, which included nonveg soup+ 4 starters- fish, chicken, baby corn and paneer, all tasted superb, unique,crispy. Their main course included steamed rice, noodles,fried rice and 4 unique side dishes- lamb in black bean sauce, garlic chicken, jumbo prawns and fish. I must specially mention about the lamb as it was very soft,tender and tasted awesome in the black bean sauce. The fish dishes were superb and even if you go for a la carte i would recommend you to go for fish dishes as they are too good. Overall, this place is one of the finest chinese cuisine resteos in town.
Ambience-4.5/5
Staff- 5/5
Food- 5/5

On saptami night, when we were too tired and hungry after pandel hopping and most of the Park Street restaurants were overly crowded, this place saved us. Luckily we got didn't have to wait unlike most of the other places. We took crispy fried sesame fish in starter along with Bira blonde. They serve huge quantity which was sufficient for two people. In main course we took Han Shui Lamb and Drunken fried rice. All of dishes were very tasty but crispy fried sesame fish stood out among all. The service was pretty good and the staffs were helpful. They have a cozy ambience along with delicious food. We will definitely come back here.

A dim lit place for perfect adda! The buffet was enticing... Starters actually stole the show... Main courses were to the extent of typical Chinese buffet... Desserts spread was poor n very limited in terms of variety... Overall liked the place n the courteous staff...

Location: At the second floor of the building opposite to the Peter Cat restaurant, Parkstreet.

Ambience: Good but not anything what should be said separately.

Food: In starter we tried Drums of Heaven and Chicken Sesame. I have experienced far better Drums of Heaven at few other places, so it was not intriguing to me. But Sesame Chicken was good though. Then we called for Rice Nodles and Pan Fried Chicken Rice, along with these we ordered two side dish of Chicken and Lamb and moreover it was through the suggestion of their service men. It was average, I mean what I expected from here taste wise - I did not reach to that mark. But certainly I can't say this place is not worthy to pay a visit.

This was on Durga Puja panchami this year. Was thinking of having lunch in a place which would b less crowded, so decided to drop in the Park Street. As you know there are ample of options. We were thinking of going to a place where we were not earlier. So, run time it was decided as Chilli Wok.

Location:
___________

it was on the 2nd floor of the MYX building. Just opposite to the Peter Cat.

Ambience:
____________

There is nothing excellent about the ambiance and decorations. It was as expected decorated in chinies theme. Best part was it was quite calm and soothing.

Food and Drink:
_________________

© starters:
_____________
✓ Drunken Fish : bhetki fish tossed with chopped tomatoes, lemon leaf with a hit of wine. Very good in taste.

© Main Courses:
__________________
✓ Ginger and Capsicum Fried Rice and Wood ear mushroom: this is available in veg, chicken and mix. We took the mix one. And that was excellent in taste. Even I was having it two three spoon without the sides, even though it was just owssum.

✓ Kung Pao Chicken: bone less Chicken tossed with roasted peanuts with chili viniger. It was okay. But yes going well with the fried rice.

© Beverages:
________________

✓ Tequila Sunrise: it was very good. A MYX of tequila, orange and Grenadines ( a syrup made of pomigranate). The portion of tequila was pretty good.

✓ MYX Marry : Mocktail made of guava and lime juice. Very refreshing. 

Overall the experience is quite good. The food quality is excellent. But yes the cost is a bit on higher side. It was 2189 for two and yes do note we didn't tried much.

People who want good chinies can surely make a visit once here.

So keep ur stomach full with a lots of pandle hopping :)

Loved the sublte flavours of the non veg ginger garlic fried rice with capsicum, bell peppers and wood ear mush room... I paired it with the fiery chilli chicken filled with peppers... And rich soy gravy!!! Utterly delicious... Especially after a hard day at work! Got the food delivered to my work.... But I must say the proportion was massive... It could easily feed three hungry souls and we were just two... So top marks for it all!!!

I had visited chilli wok long time back and had taken the chilli pink pepper mocktail. A perfect balance of sweetness from the cranberry drink and the hot slit chillies. I loved the mocktail. I had taken veg fried rice and Yuxiang shredded chicken. Both of them tasted average and nothing extraordinary compared to the huge prices.
I wish to visit again to try some of their thai dishes and sushis.
But if you are craving for chinese this place is nothing extraordinary.
Happy dining foodies😃

Great Ambience with perfect service!
Lovely food! Tried the Manchow (if people prefer Chopsy, then you would definitely like it), it just gave the perfect quick-start!
A great quantity of food, that could be shared easily, thus saving your money- Chicken dishes come with almost 10 pieces per dish. Apart from the quantity, the quality is perfect. The Lamb meat was perfectly shredded into small pieces, making it soft and not much fibrous.Overall a perfect dine-out restaurant!

You have a craving for some oriental Chinese then chilli wok is the correct place to be in park Street at a reasonable price. Located in the 2nd floor of MYX building it offers sumptuous Chinese and Japanese fare.
Been there several times. Soup and starters we have tried everything veg over here & has good flavours. U can also go for curries or khowsuey. Since we hate sushi so never tried and won't suggest. Pan fried noodles & rice is delicious. It should include more main course options plus crackling spinach also deserves a place in the menu at such a sophisticated restaurant. Darsan in dessert is ok ok, others u can skip.
Hospitality is good, ambience sound and pleasant typical for a Chinese restaurant devoid of chitter chatter abundant in other park st restaurant.
A meal here will cost bit more but equal appreciation in quality and class. I would say if u don't want to queue and have a nice meal then this is it

As soon as one enters this place the decorations and ambience is surely going to blow you away. It's surely one of the most well decorated restaurant I have ever visited in my life.
Located conveniently opposite the legendary Peter cat restaurant in the Myx premises on the second floor.
As soon as we entered the place we were greeted well the people were very courteous. After taking our seat they provided us wet napkins which was a very hospitable gesture.
Coming to the food we ordered -:
Chicken Wonton clear soup- It tasted very fine to spice it up a little I added the chilly vinegar sauce n a red sauce. It tasted very good.
Drunken fried fish made in wine was top-notch tasted just perfect.
Yuxiang shredded chicken in garlic sauce and drunken fried rice were a match made in heaven.
We also ordered fresh lime soda it was perfectly made.
For dessert we had chocolate rolls- Nutella wrapped in spring roll sheet and deep fried can never go wrong  I repeat again never. 
Price is on the higher side but still the taste makes up for that part.
Definitely I would recommend this place :)

Words fail to describe my reviews for this place. ☺ 

Located in Park Street opposite to Golden Spoon. As soon as you enter you'll be treated amazingly from the receptiom desk to the restaurant.

AMBIENCE - When you enter the restaurant, you're going to be awestruck by the decor of this place. Golden lights are so beautiful. Since i had planned a surprise for my boyfriend, so we needed a place for 2. The Chairs are comfortable and has a classy look. It has huge seating arrangements. And are comfortable enough ! 💞

FOOD - Had Blue Lagoon, Chicken Lung Fung Soup, Wok Tossed Crispy Lemon Honey Chicken, Chandu Style Chicken, Thai Pan Fried Rice & Hot Chocolate Rolls.
*Blue Lagoon was really great. It was served greatly.
*Chicken Lung Fung Soup was nicely done.
*Wok Tossed Crispy Lemon Honey Chicken was superb. The Chicken pieces were crispy yet not hard. It was great to the taste buds.
*Chandu Style Chicken - It was good. Chicken pieces were soft, good in quantity.
*Thai Pan Fried Rice - It was so yumm.. Served hot so it tasted even better.
*Hot Chocolate Rolls - This is **Heaven** 😍😍 The Rolls were not too hard. The chocolate just melted in the mouth. It was a great combo. Loved it to the core 💞💃

SERVICE - As i have said it was a surprise lunch for my boyfriend on his birthday, the staffs put the cake nicely and played the song that suited our mood. All of us (including the staffs) celebrated his birthday. It was so much fun. A big 👍 to all the staffs there. They were so courteous. Hospitality was really commendable. I loved it. 💝

Wanna spend your day with panache with your loved ones ? Wanna celebrate your special day ? Make sure to visit this place peeps. 😍

Being a normal weekday dinner ,we decided on going to this new Chinese restaurant in park Street area.
It is just opposite to Peter cat inside MYX hotel.
The restaurant opens at 7 pm so we had to wait.
Now needed to do something fruitfully while waiting,hence bought a little coupon for the same restaurant for 749 which had a soup,starter,main course,rice,desert and two mocktail.
One limitation, you are not allowed prawn or lamb.
Now the restaurant was awesome, amazing interior and empty :-D
We opted for Chicken Lung Fung Soup, and for starter Oriental Style fish ,in main course Chandu chicken with a egg chicken rice and for desert a Chocolate roll.
Apart from these we were given a blue lagoon and a sweet fresh lime soda.
Now the food was average,I went thru a few reviews which says the food was the best Chinese in park Street but for me I have seen better Chinese food  in park Street area.
Now for 749 I guess it was way more than " just worth".
Overall nice interior with average food and good service.

About the AMBIANCE, the décor was such that it elegantly gave the place a very classical touch of a Chinese restaurant. The menu cards were designed in Tradional chinese fashion with many chinese recipes that are generally not found in other chinese restaurants. The food is amazing. Their starters are especially good if you’re fond of quantity.

Absolutely thrilled to be here cause this place does offer some of the best Oriental food in town. We wanted a quiet place on this Mother's day, some place where we could enjoy our food in peace. Chilli Wok by The Myx just fit in perfect. The decor was resplendent, the ambience soothed with soft Oriental music playing in the background. We were welcomed in the grandest of manners... With cold perfumed towels, to allay the effect of the scorching sun beating down on us outside.
The staff were incredibly decent and morning did show the day. The mocktails, the starters and the main course were some of the best that we had ever come across. Although the other mocktails were in no way any less, yet the Chill Pink Pepper scored better (common consensus) and was the best mocktail amongst the lot. The starters consisting of Yue Yang Spicy BBQ fish and Crispy Fried Sesame Chicken were excellent to say the least. The Lung Fung soup was extraordinarily good and a little bit of salt and pepper just made it more heavenly. The mains simply took culinary excellence to another level. The Drunken Noodles and the Thai Pan Fried Rice were so good that they need to be tasted to be believed. The Yuxiang shredded Chicken in Garlic sauce, Kung Pao Chicken and Han Shui Lamb.... all prepared in the grandest manner and enjoyed thoroughly. The only chink in the armour was that the lamb pieces could have been a bit more tender.
The dessert offerings tasted just as elaborate as they sounded.... Fried Ice Cream with Hot Chocolate Sauce and Mini Gulab Jamun with Cheese Cake. Do not miss out on these two, if you plan to be here friends.
The service needs mention one more time, as it was something that they can be proud of.
A day to celebrate the best person in the world... Mother.... and our decision to be at Chilli Wok by the Myx did justice in every manner to the occasion.

You cannot go very wrong with Chinese preparations.. So Chilli Wok is another pretty good Chinese restaurant. Food quality isn't something marvelous..but definitely quantity is good. Personally I loved the desserts. Fried ice cream is a must try. Price is slightly on the higher side.

Randomly choose this restaurant from a large selection and was pretty tensed about its quality & Yes we didn't mistake. First I would say the ambiance was fabulous, when we entered just ashtonished that where we have stepped on. However, they welcomed us in a great manner and the staffs were so well trained, very courteous, diligent. Regarding food I must say quantity was little probs bcz we both were too foodie. But foods have the quality, they never compromise and they should not do so. I would like to request to the administration to increase the quantity (Charge should be adjusted), because its too much if we would have ordered one more dishes but it was less for that. So please take a note as upcoming customers don't have to face the same issue. Looking forward to see you soon.

Authentic and tasty chinese food, great ambience and fast service! A bit costly.

This place is located on the 2nd floor of Myx, just beside park street kfc. Food, ambience, decoration, music and service all are great. The place is dimly lit, chinese styled decorations and soft chinese music playing in the background makes it ideal for a romantic date. Staff are swift and polite. Not usually over crowded. 

Coming to food, we ordered crispy fried sesame chicken for starters. It contained 10 pieces and was accompanied by lip a smaking dip and kimchi salad. It tasted too good! For main course we ordered veg drunken noodles and han sui lamb. Both were good however i felt the lamb should have been more tender. For desert we ordered hot chocolate rolls and it was a delight. We also took a non veg pad thai noodles as take away. Price, however is on higher side. The bill was rs 2027 all inclusive. Overall a lovely place to hangout if you can afford a little pocket pinch.

Then off to crispy chilly babycorn and matchstick potato which very tasty and in very good quality, i mean really good. Now to chilly garlic noodles and broccoli tofu with garlic sauce. Both of them were amazing. The place is a treat for Chinese lovers and the quality n quantity both are very impressive. Do not miss this place !

If you consider Park Street area as a new and improved China, then Chilly Wok is one of the necessary element of that part.

Location - The restaurant located at the second floor of the Hotel MYX. If you don't know the location of the hotel, then find the KFC or Peter Cat. The hotel is next to KFC and opposite of Peter Cat. So easy to find out.

Ambiance and management - The restaurant is not so big enough but accommodate 30 persons easily. Well maintained and nice decor. But I except some kinda chinese theme, which is the missing part. I was there with my family to celebrate my Parent's marriage anniversary and we went to the restaurant around 9:00pm, it was half filled, so we don't have to wait for table. They don't have any kinda Table Booking facility, so it might be a problem to get a table during popular days like New Year eve, Christmas etc. Service is fast and stuffs are all well behaved, well trained and very courteous.

Food - We order Fresh lime soda, Ginger ale and mango juice as a drinks, Chicken Hot and sour soup, Chicken Manchow soup and Drums of heaven as a starter, Thai Pan fried chicken rice as a main course and Kung Pao Chicken as a side dish.

Soup - Both the soup came in a mid sized bowl. The chicken portion in each soup was sufficient. Hot and sour soup was really awesome. Sweet as well as tangy flavor was very prominent. Manchow soup was also good. The fried noodles were not mixed in the soup, it was server in another bowl. Hot and sour soup is highly recommended from my side.

Drums of heaven – It is one of the hot favorite item of this restaurant. 6 big pieces chicken pieces were there. Well cooked with lots of veggies like onion, capsicum, tomato etc. Addition of wine also add a good flavor in this item. Chicken pieces were very soft in nature, tender and juicy. Price of the item may seems high but you can let it go. Try this item if you visit this restaurant.

Thai pan fried chicken rice – This is also one of the special item of this restaurant. Well steamed rice cooked with peanut, veggies and curry leaf(I think so). The portion of the oil in the rice is really remarkable. Overall lite in nature and the quantity is enough for two persons. Try this one, if you are really bored with same kinda rice which is available in every restaurant.

Kung pao chicken – As an side dish with rice, it really goes well. 6pieces good sized, well cooked juicy chicken pieces were there. The dish is spicy in nature but not too hot, so you can easily select it as your side dish. Lots of onion, capsicum as well as dry fruit like cashew, peanut were there that mixes some extra flavor.

Pricing – With all the item mentioned above it cost 2590INR inclusive of all taxes which I think a little bit of costly.

In conclusion I will say, Chilli Wok is one of the good Chinese restaurant in the Park Street area. Pricing of the item may seem high but you can go there if you want to celebrate any of your special day. Overall a good dining experience.

This place has very good Chinese food. The price is also reasonable given the service and ambience and food. Infact the Indian restaurant in the same building is also pretty good.

Sudden craving for some oriental food, brought me to try this restaurant, which was waiting for long on my wish list. The interiors were simple, dim and background music (which I assume was chinese, because why not!) was soothingly hypnotic. As we got seated we were served with freshwipes. Nice gesture. We were also served two complementary salads; pickled veggies and kimchi.
We ordered some soups and starters.
Bean thread noodle soup, a Burmese soup which was really different, and a kick of so many mild flavours.
Manchow soup, which was good.
American corn salt and pepper, crispy and adequate flavours.
Veg nigiri sushi, which was great. As I love veg sushis, I had the most amazing time having them.
Veg wontons, crispy and good. The honey chilli dip was amazing.
The starters were so good and filling we had to call for only a few dishes for our main course.
We called for veg hakka noodles, burnt garlic Fried rice and mixed veg in Chinese parsley sauce. To go along with, sangria and a fruit milkshake. Had a very satisfactory meal.

Located on the second floor of THE MYX beside Park Street KFC.

It offers chinese, japanese, continental.

We ordered dry chilli chicken ( a special variant that they had that day), hakka noddles, cantonese noodles, fried rice, pan fried chilli fish and some other chicken side dish(name of which I can't remember)

Hakka noodles was good, but cantonese was much better prepared. Fried rice was great too and so were the chicken dishes but the fish seemed a bit too spicy but that much can be spared.

The decor is an example of classic oriental restaurants of Kolkata and the environment also was outstanding.

Service was relatively quick and the staff were well mannered.

Good one!

Chilli wok is located in the Myx Building opposite Peter Cat. 
The ambiance is quite good and the servers are cordial and friendly. We had ordered one of their famous dishes which was the Pad thai noodles.
The noodles were like spaghetti. It was thick and fiberous. It lacked the authenticity of chinese cuisine.
Along with it we had ordered the Yuxiang shredded chicken which was not upto the mark as well. 
The good thing about this place is that the quantity of the food in each of their preparations is a lot.
The price is quite affordable but the taste of the food can be surely better. :)

This is located in the building where myx is. Right to Flury's.
Well as soon as you enter , yeah you definitely notice the decor which they have gone with the theme of a chinese restaurant and is classy. You get seated and are served with Freshwipes ( I loved that part. :P).

They bring the order really slow. The service was only fine. Crispy babycorn was average... No dip provided alongwith it and it was very dry. we then ordered Hakka Noodles and exotic veggies in hot garlic sauce. Food was kinda sweet. Didnt really enjoy much. However the best part was the dipped strawberry in chocolate..

So kinda its sad if in a chinese restaurant the food is disappointing. Really need to check on that as the competition for chinese food is VERY high in Park street as it is.. ALL THE BEST.

Pocket pinch/500/ head with drinks.

This restaurant scores high on food and service. You will hardly find anything to complain about. 

The .5 deduction is for
- 
•	Unavailability of lamb and prawn items which I am sure was an exceptional event on the day we visited and not a regular affair.

•	Limited Mocktail choices.

We ordered –

Fresh Lime Soda (Sweet & Sour) & Blue Lagoon: Both were served in room temperature as requested and done nicely.

Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Chicken Sichuan Soup and Peppery Lemon Chicken Soup: All 3 soups were perfectly made. The Peppery Lemon Chicken soup was my favorite.

Pan Fried Chilli Fish, Crispy Fried Sesame Chicken, Yue Yang Spicy Barbequed Fish: Again, all 3 starters were excellent. They were made to perfection and tasted delicious. Must Order items!

Thai Pan Fried Rice, Drunken Fried Rice and Pineapple Fried Rice (All Chicken): The Pineapple one was average. Nothing great. The other 2 however, tasted really good.

Chandu Style Chicken, Kung Pao Chciken and Yuxiang hredded Chciken in Garlic Sauce: We loved the Kung Pao chicken. The other two tasted good but nothing extraordinary.

Hot Chocolate Rolls : Not a personal favorite, however the others liked the rolls. Presentation was beautiful!

Service: Awesome!

Price: On the higher side.

Recommended!

Located in the second floor of The Myx, right beside KFC, Park Street, this place is perfect for Chinese and Asian Delicacies. The place is well decorated and very posh with dim lights and soft music. We had: 

Staters:
Sweet corn soup
Salad
Chicken drumsticks

Mocktail:
Blue lagoon

Main course:
Burnt garlic fried rice
Yuxiang shredded chicken in garlic sauce(absolute delight)

Dessert:
Hot chocolate roll.

All the dishes were mouthwatering but I found the quantity of the burnt garlic fried rice a bit less. Yet, had an amazing time.
Hoping to visit again.

Chili wok- This is fine place to try authentic Chinese, Thai and continental dishes. Located in Second Floor of the Myx in park-street just beside the KFC outlet. The ambiance of this place instantly makes you fall for this place, with soulful music playing in the back ground and the eye-catching interior, with well-lit Chinese lamps decorations and Chinese art painting on the walls.

They comes with an all new menu which they will serve from this month of January 2017, and we were there for the New Menu launch event. The menu is loaded with varieties of starters, main course along with lip-smacking desserts.  For the non-vegetarians there are lots of variants in chicken, Mutton, lamb and pork too. The menu is stuffed with lots of, lots of delicious dishes likes Sticky Chicken Rice Ball, Summer Roll, Spare Ribs with Chili Honey sauce (A must try), Konjee Crispy Lamb (A must try), Moon Fun Veg Fried Rice, Chicken Hakka Noodles Chilli Paneer, Sesame Crispy Chicken, Chicken Pizza, Chicken Steak, Pena Pasta, Spaghetti, Pasta in Carbonara, Grilled Fish, Veg Pattie Sizzler, Chicken Sizzler and many more. 

In the dessert section Darshan with vanilla ice-cream was just mesmerizing. It will just blow your mind away. A real delight for your taste buds.
 Well price is little bit expensive but considering the massive portions and quality of food they serve, its worth it.
If you are a true Chinese lover, then make a visit ASAP! You can thank me later.

We really enjoyed every items they had to offer with their warm hospitality.

Thanks a lot

Chinese cuisine is one of my favorite apart from the other cuisines,originated from the diverse regions of China.this particular cuisine has influenced different types of other cuisines in Asia.crust spices with combination of varieties of sauces.without these three things you cannot describe Chinese dishes color,smell as the taste.either it is a dry preparation or gravy based preparation Chinese dishes are one of the best compare to other dishes.their traditional Wanton Soup,Chili Chicken,Chili Garlic Hakka Noodles along with different types of Dim sum,Rice preparation you just can’t ignore.Chopsticks are the main eating utensils for Chinese foods.well if you want to eat some really good Chinese foods along with lip-smacking Thai dishes then you have to visit China Wok.which is located in Park Street area,just beside the KFC outlet of Park Street.quite spacious with around 35-40 sitting arrangement with classy sofas and chairs.very well maintained interior along with extra-ordinary lighting effects.i went there over a food tasting session with my fellow foodie friends.they comes with a all new menu which they will serve from this month of January.the menu is loaded with varieties of starters,main course along with lip-smacking desserts.it was really hard for me to decide which one is the good and which one is the best among these dishes.we started our food tasting with a glass fresh lime soda sweet & salt which was prepared perfectly,it was cool and refreshing.all of the dishes decorated very well.coming back to food we had some delicious dishes started with,

Chilli Wok is located in Second Floor of the Myx just beside Park Street KFC serves authentic Chinese, Asin and continental dishes to its customers. The place itself is a one off and takes you to a Chinese setting with well lit Chinese lamps decorations and art on the walls. The service is also good with individual attention given to you and customer satisfaction being the top priority. The food is absolutely authentic from Chicken Rice Ball to Dumpling to spring rolls, to Chicken Satay and their speciality being Konjee Crispy Lamb and Ponda chicken will take your breath away and you can't make yourself satisfied soon. For the veggies there is manchurian coins , vegetable dumpling, chilli paneer, Veg spring roll. You just can't decisive about the dish you want to have. For the non vegetarians there are lots of variants in chicken, Mutton, lamb and pork too. From manchurian to Spare Ribs and chicken Hakka noodles. They have a lot of varieties to pamper your taste buds.
We were there for bloggers meet and it was an event on New Menu launch.
After serving veg and non veg Chinese and few Asian dishes we had to concentrate on the continental and sizzlers.
Overall Chilli Wok is fairly priced and offers a wholesome amount for the money they charge and Is definitely worth it and you will definitely want to visit there again.

Veg Dumpling : Filled with Soft veggies it was an awesome light item after heavy entry of high voltage pizza. Nice Presentation and colour was also plus !

You probably can understand by length of this write ups that how much time we had taken to enjoy this long never-ending food journey. Please be with us for a little more. It was time for the desserts.

Was a bit disappointed with this place, had heard and read such fantastic views about this place so my expectations were high and this definitely didn't live up to it. The staff were polite, courteous and helpful but they were too slow. It took an inordinately long time in getting the dishes we had ordered. In fact one friend had to leave without having mains coz she was in a hurry and they took so long.The food  per se was not bad but nothing extraordinary either. The ambience too was ordinary, a typical Chinese restaurant style.The soup, Wonton veg soup was good. But the mandarin dumplings weren't good at all. The mains too were nothing to rave about, the burnt garlic rice, Singapore style noodles and the exotic veggies with broccoli ....All were ok.
The restaurant was absolutely empty and yet they took so long to bring the food to the table.

Firstly, great ambience for a luxury time pass and dining with friends. Secondly, the staffs are good, very polite and well attired. Went there with my friends for a dinner, and they too found the place awesome. I ordered for Drums of Heaven as starter, which was good. For main course, ordered Veg fried rice with Kum Pao Chicken, and there was no regret for my choice. Tasted a delicious dish, Konjee Lamb, for which I couldn't resist myself from ordering it again for the second time. The only negative point is that the cost of Alcohol is too high, which might be a pocket pinch for many. But I would recommend this place to all my friends, for visiting at least once, if you are looking for a fine dine atmosphere in Park Street area...

I went to visit Chilli Wok, with a Little voucher. We had one soup, one starter, one main course, one noodles/rice and one dessert on the menu.
The service is definitely great. But according to me, portions or the taste of food didn't quite match up to my expectations.
The Peppery Lemon soup was not bad. The kimchi salad I am sorry to say, is the worst I have ever had. The starter, crispy fried sesame fish was just dry fried fish, whereas I am used to trying the same item as fried fish draped in a sauce. So that fell flat. For main course we ordered the drunken noodles which was good but the Thai Basil Chicken although tasted okay, was extremely unpleasant to the eye. It was served as minced chicken and looked quite unappetizing. I would suggest them to use shredded chicken instead of mince. For dessert, we ordered chocolate rolls which was nothing great, and quite dry. A little ice cream to go with it, would have definitely lifted the dish.
Ambience and service is great. But I had higher expectations from the food.

We went on a sat afternoon and surprisingly the place was empty. The deco is good .
Had “Tom Yum” soup which was over salty and bad . On informing they probably brought the same item after adding more water. (Pffff very disappointed!!! )
Starter was in the form of “Drunken Prawn” which was good and the Prawns were tender.
For the main course we ordered “Sliced Lamb with black bean sauce” along with “Capsicum Ginger mushroom friend rice” . The rice was great and the lamb was tender however the taste was average.
Fried ice cream dessert was okayish and same goes for the service !
Overall Average i would say .

This is another delicious place in Park Street area. It was a lovely experience discovering this restaurant. The food is good in both quality-wise and quantity-wise. I mainly want to visit this place to taste their Sushi, so we tried Spicy Tuna Special Roll and it was delicious. Along with that we tried Crispy Fried Sesame Chicken and Fried Calamari, both were very nicely prepared. The service is also very good and fast. The decoration and ambience are very good.

Situated on the second floor of Myx, the ambiance so very soothing with some instrumental music playing in the background . The decoration is like any other good Chinese restaurant with dim lights .

As for the food , I think I was feeling a little adventurous that day . We ordered fried wontons and Jan hian Singa. For main course we ordered Pad Thai and a side of four treasure exotic vegetables with ginger wine . For beverage we had a fresh lime soda and blue lagoon and finally we had chocolate rolls for dessert .

Jan hian Singa is a Burmese soup . The base is of coconut milk . The flavours are very mild, it comes with finely grated vegetables , slices of bean curd and semolina . Loved this ! Recommended if you like the flavour of coconut milk .

Fried wontons are one my favorite appetizers of all time. The filling was moist and flavorful and the wrapping was fine . It was served with sweet chilli sauce, what more can one ask for ? Highly recommended .

The pad Thai was okay but not what I expected . I think it had a little too many sauces and lost the essence of it . The crunchiness of nuts was barely there . Also it was too spicy ! Needs to be improved.

Four treasure exotic vegetables with ginger wine paired with pad Thai was a bad idea I suppose . The spices used in this were way too mild compared to the noodles and I think that's why I wouldn't be able to say a lot about how it tasted . It was good though.

The fresh lime soda and blue lagoon were pretty good. I will recommend the blue lagoon, the presentation was good .

Finally the chocolate rolls, I think I'd say dont order this . Highly disappointed .

Food :3.5/5
Value for money : 4/5
Presentation and management : 5/5
Ambiance : 5/5

Happy eating ! :)

We were invited by the Manager of The Myx here to dine. Though the building is famous for its night club, this restaurant on the 2nd floor is well known for its Chinese delicacies. We kinda ended up over-ordering this time. The menu cards were designed in Tradional chinese fashion with many chinese recipes that are generally not found in other chinese restaurants. The ambience is soothing. I had a Virgin Mojito which was nicely made. To start, we had Drums of Heaven and Classic Golden Fried Prawns. We had Singapore rice noodles and Thai Pan Fried rice. Then we had Kung Pao Chicken and Braised Crab in pepper Garlic sauce and Bangkok Chicken. The quantity was so much that we couldn't finish them. For the desserts, I had one fried ice cream with hot chocolate sauce. The main course was good. The food was cooked well. Though we didn't like the crab so much. But my love for desserts in unfathomable and it gets better when the dessert is good. It was lovely! The staffs are polite as well. The manager was friendly. Had a lovely evening. Well, the price is a bit on the higher side though.

Great ambience, classy tasteful decor, and polite, efficient waiters...all these added up to make this a memorable first visit for me. I would have ideally given this restaurant a 4, but have deducted a 0.5 because the prices are quite on the higher side, but the food is not exotic or sumptuous enough to justify the high price.

Visited the joint on ashtami night. We wanted a place where the rush was less and we could get good food to. Keeping all these parameters in mind we landed on the myx and my research paid fruit.. got a table as soon as we enterd the place.. 
Ambience was excellent.. There was a minor hiccup.. The drums of heaven we ordered should have had 8 peices but they served 7 peices.. Notifying this to the staff they were very apologetic about the fact and were insisting that they give us another serving.. We politely declined but they still served us raspberry cake as a compensation.. The ordered food was good and well prepared.. Yes the quantity was a bit less to our liking but nevertheless a good experience id say...
A good visit for chinese enthusiasts. Do drop in if you have the budget.. Its worth it..

We have visited this outlet along with three of my friend in the evening of panchami, there was a non veg buffet spread with an affordable price tag of Rs.699/- only. It contain two variation of soup with four type of starter and an semi elaborated spread.

Food quality is not good, the lamb which they served was half cooked, they have prepared a prawn dish in some sweet sauce which contains less of prawn and more of cornflour coating. The deserts date pie was good. More over below average food they have served.

Went to this place for Saptami Lunch, so exactly can't say if the review holds true for non durga puja days. For pujas they have this special puja buffet. Which is good. Keeping in mind that its a restaurant in park street, and the ambiance, 699 per head is decent. The spread is sumptuous, with soup, 2 starters, 2 main course, 4 side dish, 2 salads (veg n non veg each), and delicious desserts to follow. So if u find loong line outside the classic park street restaurants, you can opt for the chinese buffet at this place during pujas

2nd floor of the Myx,Park Street (next to KFC) you would find this place. If you are crazy about Chinese and can land anywhere on earth then this would be heaven for you!Awesome is an understatement both for the taste and the presentation.
Except the dessert loved everything we ordered.Peppery lemon soup(chicken) for a start was a good selection. Served piping hot with a nice peppery aroma. Appetizers that appealed to us was the Yue Yang Spicy Barbecued Fish.Very spicy,medium sized pieces served with onions,carrots,bell peppers(very thinly grated).Just out-of-the-world flavour. Portions well serve two.We ordered Spicy Orange Juice as the drinks.The drink was really different,spicy indeed, and not the typical sweet juice.
Main course included Burnt Garlic Fried Rice (chicken) and Yuxiang Shredded Chicken in Garlic Sauce. The rice,oh whattt aroma and texture! Wanted to shout out "One more please"! The rice was topped with very thinly grated burnt garlic,exactly as much is needed for the aroma.The rice is so tasty that it could be had without any sides at all. The Yuxiang Chicken is again incredibly delicious, no questions asked,hands down!!The gravy actually has a different taste,something new,something that I had not tasted in a while.This made me go for the gravy again n' again.The portions served were more than enough for two.
After such awesome dishes when our expectations were high the Hot Chocolate Rolls were served.Unfortunately I didn't enjoy these.The hot rolls could have been balanced with a scoop of ice cream.This cooling effect was the only thing missing in the dish.And the dessert is the only reason for not rating this place with a whole 5! Would love to come again n' again here!!!

-------------- 2nd Visit on 20th Dec'16 ----------------------

1. Tom Kha Gai Soup Chicken- Coconut flavour overrode the lemongrass scent. Very heavy to be consumed by one.
2. Han Shui Lamb- Very high on the salt side. Didn't enjoy it at all. 
3. Drunken fish- Very tasty, can order it over n' over again.
4. Burnt Garlic Fried Rice- As usual lovely.
Overall experience- Not so satisfactory as the Day One! :(

Went put for a dinner in park street area. Thought of trying this new place. Ambience is good. Service is also good. What they lack is in the process of preparation of the food keeping hygiene in mind. We ordered dry chilli chicken , chicken noodles and kungpao chicken. We found hair present in the dry chilli chicken which we neglected. But same issue occured for noodles as well. Then we asked them to change. The altered food was not of that taste, anyways our mode for food were already gone.

Fortuitous turn of events led us here on my mom's birthday. The place is very subtle and decorated with authentic chinese decorations. Since we did not had any idea about their dishes we left it on the stewards. With their recommendation we had deep fried sesame chkn, bbq fish, veg fried rice, prawn in plum sauce and for desset fried ice cream. All the dishes were excellent and tasted awesome especially the fried ice cream. Thoroughly recommended for a nice family dinner. Budget rs 1000 per pax give or take.

Now with the order. In a drinks we had ordered grape berry cooler, chilli pink pepper,virgin mojito and since I had a bad throat I ordered for myself a simple fresh lime water sweet. For the starters we ordered crispy fried sesame fish, dry chilli chicken and oriental style prawns in Sichuan sauce. For the main there was one portion of mixed fried rice and haka noodles along with chicken Chandu style. We would definitely recommend others to try this place out. Highly impressed with the taste and the food quality and ofcourse the polite service.

Chinese cuisine is my favourite cuisine.. So when i m in tow i just try chinese serving jaunts.. Call me crazy but i love chinese food to the moon and back..;) Leme start the gupshup on Chilli Wok.. Here it goes:
First up is The Ambience: Situated just below The Myx, Park street. Upon entering this place i felt as if i have entered the sets of Kung Fu Panda.. The scene where Po imitates his master Shifu for others in that dining area... The decor is very Chinese.. The music is soulful.. The seating has wooden touch to it..One can make out that this dining is proper chinese restaurant..
Next up is The Food: So twas a family outing.. And i was craving for chinese as usual.. So was greeted with Kimchi salad which was yum.. I asked for two more helpings.. Tasted wow! While waiting for the order and they were:
Manchow Soup: Loads of veggies Mushroom being in excess as requested;).. Warm and appetizing!
Crispy American Corn: This was tossed in ginger sans garlic and onion and yet it tasted yum.. Crispy and apt flavours!
Crispy Chilli Babycorn: i m in love with Crispy babycorns.. And its my fav in chinese menu.. This dish turned out to be yum as well.. Yes it had full flavour of garlic and onion..
Burnt Garlic Noodles: The colour of chow determines whether it is tossed in required spices.. And this one was tossed to par excellence..
Veg Manchurian: this was nice and gravy.
Veg Fried Rice with Veg Paneer: I dint like the flavours of both of the above.. The rice was not cooked i guess.. 
Icecream tempura: This dessert could have been better.. But its okey dokey tastewise!
Lastly, The Service and Pocket Pinch: The staff were courteous and the service was quick.. This place is priced normally.. Can pay a visit if one loves chinese food and wants to experiment with new place..
Do leme know how was your experience?! Thanks

Chilli Wok has been on my list ever since they opened up. But considering the common nature of Pan Asian restaurants in Kolkata, it was especially hard to actually dine out here. The thing is, I wasn't expecting much because how different could Pan Asian at an above average place actually be? I've had high end Pan Asian at Yauatcha and a couple others, but they never outdid the classics like Tung Nam. This, this right here, is where Chilli Wok comes to the party.

The restaurant is located where Saurav's used to be -- right opposite Peter Cat. The place is small, but spacious enough to accommodate around 15 families. The décor is pretty, but common in the sphere of Asian decorations. It resembles Chowman if you've ever been there. The cutlery and the crockery are fantastically well polished and you cannot fault the seating. Perhaps if their chairs were a tad bit lighter.

The service does stand out. The waiters are as friendly and warm as best out there. I did walk into and empty Chilli Wok so I suppose service couldn't have been too hard. But take nothing away, they were a delight.

The food is amazing. Their starters are especially good if you're fond of quantity. Chilli Wok is definitely expensive but considering the massive portions they serve, they're absolutely worth it. The Fried Tempura prawns were the only lacking element because it never stood out. But really, how much can you do with batter and deep frying. The mains were top notch as well. The chow was fantastically good. Their menu is very incentive, so if you're one for the creatives in food, you'll enjoy your time here. I did start of with a coconut soup (do not recall the name) which was among the better bowls of soup you could have. I'd happily compare it to the Chimney Soup 'How Hua' used to serve before they shut down. The sides that we ordered were portioned perfectly. Stunning as they were, Chilli Wok does amazing work with presentation. The drinks were very decent too. One of the very few restaurants I'll actually ask to reduce portions. Instead of charging 350 for a massive bowl of chow, I'd reckon 300 for a reduced amount is more feasible.

The Myx has a ton of other restaurants, so choosing Chilli Wok was a hard call. I've been craving North Indian and Aaira was the obvious choice. But Chinese never really does go out of style, and Chilli Wok makes sure that it won't anytime soon.

Great food. Great experience.

It was a very refreshing experience while dining here. The interior, food, background music and the staffs...it was really a good experience. We tried lemon coriander soup. Though this one is a veg item, w@e requested them to make it non-veg. Then we had crispy lemon honey chicken and Drunken Prawn as starter. Both taste mouthwatering. We ordered Drunken fried rice, Pan fried noodles and Kung pao chicken in main course. Finally we had fried ice cream. Each and every item was "la-jabab". Only the fresh lime soda was not up to the mark. We booked the table through Dine out which offered us a 20% discount also. Overall it was a very good experience.

Since the place where I live presently has very limited options for a Chinese lover like me thus I satiate my fill only when I go back home in Kolkata. The Chinjabi served here is not to my liking.

This friendship day 4 giggling girls decided to take on Chilli Wok.

The first impression was 'its almost a fine dining' and we having had met after long wanted anything but a quiet place where we had to behave! Nonetheless nothing could deter our wild spirits :)
We were offered wet tissues not something we experience everywhere we go, good for people travelling from far or after office hours.
After the initial chit chat we ordered sweet lime sodas and crispy fried seasme fish for starter, The fish no doubt was fresh and soft but a little under seasoned for my liking however the sticky chutney was too sweet which kind of balanced it out, the portion was good for 4, we got 3 pieces each.
For main course we ordered chicken rice noodles and chicken hakka noodles, the problem with rice noodles is that they are so delicate over cooking for even a second tend to stick them up , which unfortunately was the case here and I am not too fond of them. He hakka whereas was good like any other normal place.
For sides we had ordered Yuxiang shredded chicken and kung pao chicken, both were a little sweet for my taste, however here I give them a benefit of doubt , I should have checked prior ordering and could have gotten something more savoury.
All in all the food was good way better than what they call Chinese in this part of the country (Delhi, baring the ridiculously expensive ones!)

I've had high end Pan Asian at Yauatcha and a couple others, but they never outdid the classics like Tung Nam. This, this right here, is where Chilli Wok comes to the party.

The restaurant is located where Saurav's used to be -- right opposite Peter Cat. The place is small, but spacious enough to accommodate around 15 families. The décor is pretty, but common in the sphere of Asian decorations. It resembles Chowman if you've ever been there. The cutlery and the crockery are fantastically well polished and you cannot fault the seating. Perhaps if their chairs were a tad bit lighter.

The service does stand out. The waiters are as friendly and warm as best out there. I did walk into and empty Chilli Wok so I suppose service couldn't have been too hard. But take nothing away, they were a delight.

The food is amazing. Their starters are especially good if you're fond of quantity. Chilli Wok is definitely expensive but considering the massive portions they serve, they're absolutely worth it. The Fried Tempura prawns were the only lacking element because it never stood out. But really, how much can you do with batter and deep frying. The mains were top notch as well. The chow was fantastically good. Their menu is very incentive, so if you're one for the creatives in food, you'll enjoy your time here. I did start of with a coconut soup (do not recall the name) which was among the better bowls of soup you could have. I'd happily compare it to the Chimney Soup 'How Hua' used to serve before they shut down. The sides that we ordered were portioned perfectly. Stunning as they were, Chilli Wok does amazing work with presentation. The drinks were very decent too. One of the very few restaurants I'll actually ask to reduce portions. Instead of charging 350 for a massive bowl of chow, I'd reckon 300 for a reduced amount is more feasible.

The Myx has a ton of other restaurants, so choosing Chilli Wok was a hard call. I've been craving North Indian and Aaira was the obvious choice. But Chinese never really does go out of style, and Chilli Wok makes sure that it won't anytime soon.

Great food. Great experience.

It was a very refreshing experience while dining here. The interior, food, background music and the staffs...it was really a good experience. We tried lemon coriander soup. Though this one is a veg item, w@e requested them to make it non-veg. Then we had crispy lemon honey chicken and Drunken Prawn as starter. Both taste mouthwatering. We ordered Drunken fried rice, Pan fried noodles and Kung pao chicken in main course. Finally we had fried ice cream. Each and every item was "la-jabab". Only the fresh lime soda was not up to the mark. We booked the table through Dine out which offered us a 20% discount also. Overall it was a very good experience.

Since the place where I live presently has very limited options for a Chinese lover like me thus I satiate my fill only when I go back home in Kolkata. The Chinjabi served here is not to my liking.

This friendship day 4 giggling girls decided to take on Chilli Wok.

The first impression was 'its almost a fine dining' and we having had met after long wanted anything but a quiet place where we had to behave! Nonetheless nothing could deter our wild spirits :)
We were offered wet tissues not something we experience everywhere we go, good for people travelling from far or after office hours.
After the initial chit chat we ordered sweet lime sodas and crispy fried seasme fish for starter, The fish no doubt was fresh and soft but a little under seasoned for my liking however the sticky chutney was too sweet which kind of balanced it out, the portion was good for 4, we got 3 pieces each.
For main course we ordered chicken rice noodles and chicken hakka noodles, the problem with rice noodles is that they are so delicate over cooking for even a second tend to stick them up , which unfortunately was the case here and I am not too fond of them. He hakka whereas was good like any other normal place.
For sides we had ordered Yuxiang shredded chicken and kung pao chicken, both were a little sweet for my taste, however here I give them a benefit of doubt , I should have checked prior ordering and could have gotten something more savoury.
All in all the food was good way better than what they call Chinese in this part of the country (Delhi, baring the ridiculously expensive ones!)

I visited this place with a bunch of friends for nothing but their fried ice cream. Since we were on a budget lunch, we stuffed ourselves with KFC which now seems like the stupidest thing we could do!! 

So as we got seated, the place was empty. The decor was really simple but elegant. I found the place really relaxing. We ended up ordering Sesame Fried Crispy Chicken and ofcourse the fried ice cream. 

So firstly the kimchi they serve is really delicious! And coming to the dishes :

Sesame Fried Crispy Chicken - This was a really good dish. The chicken was perfectly crisp and had a wonderful balance of flavour which was phenomenal. 

Fried Ice Cream - This was obviously the star of the experience. Absolutely delicious! The ice cream was crisp on the outside and firm in the centre! It looked stunning and every mouthful was just heavenly. 

As a whole, this is a lovely place with some wonderful food! The prices are high but definitely worth visiting once or twice a month. 
Highly recommended to everyone!! 

Happy Dining!

They have mastered the art of Asian and chinese delicacies. Simply awesome. By the time I write this review I have been here twice and enjoyed what not. On two visits I happened to enjoy much more than so much. Great fooding and they know the art. Amazing decor. Everything up to the mark. A great heaven for people who love chinese and some other asian dishes. By my pictures you will understand as to how much I have eaten and savored. The dishes one by one raised the standard of fooding we had till date. The deserts were also good. The service and people all were out-standing. Hats off for carrying all of this so well. It is located very conveniently where there used to be Saurav's. So basically it is in the heart of Kolkata. Highly recommended and must visit.

I went to Chilli Wok today for lunch.
Firstly I ordered Manchow Soup, the soup was tasty, then I ordered Stir fried Vegetable, it was healthy and tasty with lots of exotic vegetable like broccoli, red and green bell peppers and many more.
then in the main course burnt garlic fried rice and seasonal vegetable with parsley sauce, both were too good. in the dessert darsaan with ice cream was also good.
The staffs were very polite and ambience is also nice and nicely decorated in dim light .

A must visit if you are someone who loves Chinese as this place offers an amazing food menu. They probably serve some of the best Wantons and the spring rolls are to die for. The service is good and not very time consuming. Dessert options are limited and noting extraordinary is there on the menu but then the main course will not let you crib about that. All in all, a perfect place to catch up with friends or a small family outing as well.

Nice interiors with well behaved staffs, but not very good food. The starting was great with won ton soup, but then it all went down hill from there. Spring roll was a total let down, burnt garlic noodles didn't have the flavour nor aroma of burnt garlic and we had a chef special dish (don't remember the name) that too was below expectation. May be the restaurant has better offerings for non vegetarians.

I recently visited Chilli Wok for a friend's birthday..Ambience wise the place is classy.. Perfect for a dinner date or some high profile meet. They have slow music playing in the background. Menu wise the menu is elaborate and patrons have a good variety to choose from. Taste wise the food is ok..Nothing very unique or different from other Chinese outlets in Park Street. Try the berry cooler if you want to drink something. Taste-wise I feel Barbq is much better. Price wise the menu is expensive but that is expected because of the Ambience they provide you with. Service wise the servers were courteous and polite. Go to Chilli Wok for high profile gatherings where you dont bother much about the food but need a classy place to be in

I found this restaurant to be pleasantly surprising. The waiters were very polite, considerate and hospitable. The food here is very tasty although it's a bit overpriced. Good for me I had a  Groupon from the Little app. The atmosphere is quite soothing with Chinese decorations. The Big Screen TV and light music also relaxes the mind. I had Drums of heaven for starters and it managed to live upto it's name. The chicken was soft, well cooked and nicely spiced. The restaurant provides us a variety of choices for rice and noodles. My personal favourite is the rice noodles. For desert I had the Fried ice cream which was unbelievably delicious. I can't forget the cold semi liquid pouring out of the Fried hot crust of the ice cream as you break it with your fork. Overall a great place for a date. Not too friendly for the wallet though( that being the reason for my 4.0 rating). Would definitely recommend it to friends.

Noodles didnt have enough flavour. Dumplings were okayish. (Exide momos are better tbh) chef special some wierd dish was pathetic. Didnt have more after a bite. Soup was not tasty . I ordered lemon coriander soup. And desert was the worst. pancakes? Those arent pancakes. Gosh i just had the vanilla ice cream and left the pancakes. Waste of money. Not worth it. 😖

I went here with my friend just a couple of days ago for a late lunch and had a wonderful experience. This place is very easy to locate, it is situated just beside park street kfc, in the 2nd floor of the Myx building. The dimly lit ambience with a chinese decor along with soothing music in the background, gives an excellent feel to this place. I also enjoyed the high chairs, which is my personal favourite. The behaviour of the staff was also top notch. Also when we asked them for their suggestions regarding the order, they helped us quite efficiently, pointing out the fact that they are well aware of their items. For our food, we ordered spicy barbequed fish as an appetizer and pineapple fried rice and shredded chicken in garlic sauce for the main course. The food was served to us within 15minutes and all of them were piping hot. The fish was excellent, perfectly cooked with the perfect crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. The sauce is which it was tossed with bellpapers and onions was a treat to the palate. The pineapple rice was delightful. It was light with ample chicken eggs and small chunks of pineapple. It had a very nice flavour to it. The shredded chicken complimented the rice perfectly. It was medium spicy and tasted like bliss along with the fried rice. The quantity of the food was a lot as we could not finish the dishes. Our bill was 1700.The price of the place is definitely on the higher end but then the quality of the food is par excellent. Highly recommended to all chinese food lovers. As for me, i am definitely going back to try soeme of their other interesting items.

Located on 2nd floor of Myx Kolkata. Next to KFC Park Street.

This place is more of a fine dining place. Classy interiors 9/10. What i like more over here is the choice of tapestry and furniture.

Food - I've been here umpteenth number of times. So i have had the privilege of tasting most of the items.

If you want some great soups, you can try Tom Yum or Lemon Coriander soup. It is not in the Non veg menu but if you ask they do prepare it. If you want to keep it simple, go for Sweet Corn.
For starters you could go with Crispy Chilli Babycorn Sichuan style, Singapore style Springrolls, Matchstick Potato in Garlic Sauce. For the meat lovers a must is the Wok Tossed Crispy Lemon Honey Chicken, Drums of Heaven, Oriental Style Chicken.
For the main course - Konjee Lamb, Kung Pao Chicken and Bangkok Chicken (comes with rice) are just too good. Thai Basil chicken had a peculiar taste and smell to it. 
Never tried the Thai curries. But i presume they'll be great as well.
Pad-thai noodles are one of its kind out here.
Cantonese Noodles didn't fascinate me as I'm not a exotic veggies guy.
Hakka noodles are pretty good.
But what beat my heart was the Burnt Garlic Fried Rice.
Hot Chocolate rolls and Fried Icecream are good choice to sum it up.

Overall, a nice pinch on the pocket but a great experience.

One of the few places in the city that does justice to the word authentic chinese. The food and the drinks are really lip smacking and the quantity they serve is blissful. The last and the most awesome thing about Chilli Wok is the staff. They are extremely friendly and are delightfully helpful. Try the Yuxiang Shredded Chicken In Garlic Sauce.

Been here couple of times. Quite like the dimsums, pan fried tofu, spring rolls, and pan fried noodles, to name a few. Everything I've ordered has always been good in taste, service has also been pretty decent. So I've got no complaints from this place. I think it can be a good competitor for restaurants like Mainland China, as far as the veg options are concerned. Also called for home delivery this week. Food was nicely packed and hot when it arrived. Keep up the good job.

Chilli Wok is your go-to place when it comes to authentic chinese cuisine and a classy ambience. A warmly lit place with a soothing ambience coupled with aesthetic decor and some fine music makes dining here a lavish and splendid experience. Before I comment on the food, I would like to say that this place deserves full points for hospitality and the service is so so efficient. We started off with chicken lung fung (which was a slurping delight) and american corn salt and pepper...again an instant hit among us!! For main course, we were served drunken rice noodles with bell peppers, onions, basil,shrimp, chicken and eggs along with Kung Pao chicken. The drunken rice noodles are like a party in your mouth, and went so well with the delicious Kung Pao chicken. And the hot chocolate rolls that followed-deep fried on the outside with soft chocolate filling were blissful. Also the rates are pretty affordable...a meal for two cost around 1600 rupees. Keep up the amazing work!!

Even Vegans have a wide choice here apart from the dessert.
Singapore style spring roll tasted good.
Seasonal Vegetables in Parsley Sauce is a must have there. Burnt Garlic noodles was a little spicy but tasted amazing!
Haven't had a more perfect fresh lime soda anywhere else!
Ambience was soothing and the place is warmly lighted up.

This was my first attempt at Sushi. I had no idea how it'll be. The first impression was wow visually!! Slipped a piece within mouth instantly.... mmmm..... it's a bit different. Bland, yet delicious. I had tasted nothing like this before. But yes.... it's definitely recommended.

Located on the sexond floor of Myx , very easy to locate this place gives you the warm and classy vibe the moment you step in. Warm wood furnitures with warm lighting and fine music., the place has an air of sophistication though it is a little small.
For starters we ordered calamari rings ..which was marked to be the chefs speciality was tooo good. It tasted amazing and had a really good quantity.
For maincourse we ordered Pad Thai noodles and prawn in chilly plum sauce and kungpao chicken .. the most remarkable thing about the food is the quantity. The prawn was delicious. I guess they have a speciality in sea food
The waiters were courteous though they had a wrong habit of staring and eves dropping and then smiling among themselves 
Food has huge quantity. Very sumptuous and tasty. Would love to visit again.

The place is nicely decorated but food isn't up to the mark comparitively to the pricing of this restaurant. I wiuld rather prefer mainland china if i have to eat in such a price range.

Hey, I was looking for a new chinese restaurant to go for my birthday treat. And thankgod I came across this place. Good ambience, good service, and food was unexpectedly amazing. The Matchstick Potato in Hot Garlic sauce was the best starter. For the main course I loved the  Pan Fried vegetable noodles and for the side dish Exotic vegetables in Wine Garlic Sauce was out of the world. I just felt the quantity of noodles was a little less compared to other chinese restaurant. Overall an amazing experience and I am going again next month. Yay!

Last year I visited this restraunt along with my father. The interior decoration was so impressive, just was feeling like China. Soft Chinese themes and bone China sculptures and all the China staffs was amazing. And the food was excellent. We ordered Prawn fried rice with chicken munchurian. Just loved that.

Based on ratings and reviews I went to this place. The starter items in Chinese weren't all that great. The Chcken pieces were weirdly hard and chewy. Main course went ok. Overall a passable experience.

Visited this one yesterday with a couple of friends for lunch. It's very easy to find, just beside the KFC outlet. The decor is classy, perfect for a date too. The ambience was just so romantic. Quiet and calm. Coming down to the food, we tried Teriyaki Chicken Sushi, Vegetable Fried rice and Kung Pao Chicken. The quality and quantity were perfect. Totally one of the best Chinese I had in a while. And because of a special scheme they have we got four mocktails, free! Plus we were gifted with two coupons too! Its quite reasonable, keeping in mind how much this restaurant has to offer. OK, I'm definitely going back!

Finally we made it here ! 
Nice ambience. Well decorated interior. Very classy !
The quality and quantity of food is very good. The Chicken Sichuan soup tastes yummy ! Drunken Noodles (rice noodles) quality was excellent. And shredded chicken in garlic sauce very different and a must try ! 
The menu is very specific and not loaded with lot f items ! 
N the best part is if you like their facebook page they will serve you free mock tails :)
A must visit for Chinese lover.
And if you are lucky like us then u might end up wid loads f coupons and discount cards !
FULLY SATISFIED.

we visited this place today wanting to eat some delicious chinese cuisine and was not at all disappointed. being vegetarians, our selection of items was little restricted but we began with a nice, hot hot and sour soup and match stick styled potato in chilli sauce. both tasted wonderful. in the main course, their speciality - burnt garlic noodles and exotic vegetables took us by surprise. it was simply awesome. in dessert, we tried their fried ice cream which was a tad disappointing. it could have been prepared in a better way. 
the decor of the place is quite nice, staffs were very courteous and humble. 
i would surely visit this place again and would recommend the readers to try out once.
cost for two would be around 1700

By seeing its reviews and getting satisfactory feedback from friends.... I thought of visiting this place along with two of my buddies.... chinese cuisine being my all time favourite even played a major role to entice me. 
I really enjoyed the food which was served to us. The presentation...quality and most worth mentioning is the taste was quite captivating. 
The barbeque fish was cooked to perfection. The burnt chilli garlic fried rice along with shredded soya based chicken satisfied our taste buds. Their service and courteous behaviour is highly appreciable. We were given discounts and coupons for our next visit.   I would definitely suggest to experience to believe yourself.

Catching up with the recent trend in wok restos which give you the choice of selecting your own veggies and sauces in your desired proportion and making a rice/noodle combo meal out of it, Noodle wok is a welcome entry into that club. Rushed thru a quick lunch meal at this park street area fast food joint during our shopping escapades in Calcutta. Decor was bright, the chef were responsive and alert..The spicy rice combo was very appropriately spiced up and a nice satisfying meal in the end. Perfect for a quick Chinese hunger pang.  With

When Calcutta is flooded with Chinese restaurants, what can one do to stand out? The answer is chilli wok. The amazing food that they serve. Best Chinese in town probably. We also called for one portion of veg khowsuey and it is the best Burmese I have eaten in the entire city. It was superb beyond words. It's definitely a must try there. Quite affordable but there is a lot of scope of improvement in their service.

Drunken Fish is an amazing starter to begin with and Prawn in Chilli Plum Sauce was a clear winner for main course.

Hi foodies!

So Mom wanted to have her favorite Cantonese Noodles at Tung Fong but I convinced her to try this place. She hesitates to try out new places but after reading several good reviews, I was able to confidently persuade her. :)

-Decor- 
So Myx is a place which houses 5 different food/pub joints (refer picture) and Chilli Wok is one of them, on the second floor. There's stairs for people afraid to use the elevator (like my mom).
The lift directly opens to the restaurant and someone greets you immediately. On this particular night, it was somewhat empty with only one other family present. 
The ambience really impresses you with the excellent dim lighting and soft soulful instrumental music. The chairs and the fine glasses and cutlery make up for the lackluster walls and ceilings.

-Food-
We wanted to keep it light, so we skipped right to the mains. We had:
1) MIXED CANTONESE NOODLES: Mixed contained egg, chicken, shrimp and lamb. Out of these, the boiled lamb chunks stood out. The others were too minced to be noticed. This dish had excessive veggies but they  were boiled and cooked so perfectly that each of them complimented the flavor of the noodles. Considering the price, we expected the quantity to be insufficient for two persons but we were proved wrong. :) 

2) KUNG PAO CHICKEN: Several small pieces of chicken cooked in a soya sauce and wine; tasted nice in the beginning but the flavor of soya sauce overwhelmed when the dish lost the heat. Even here, the quantity of dish was more than sufficient.

However, one thing that bothered me was the complete disparity in the prices of the rice/noodles (275/-) and the sides (445/- and upwards). 

-Staff-
Very competent staff who were quick to serve the dishes and clear the plates and kept a notice on our progress. However, a bit more awareness about all the items and suggesting new dishes would have been appreciated.

-Pros-
1) Excellent location and ambiance.
2) Competent staff.
3) Above average food.

-Cons-
1) Disparity of prices.
2) Prices on the higher side (especially starters and sides)
3) Lack of variety in menu. 

-Final verdict-
Food: 3.8/5
Staff: 3.9/5
Ambience: 4.4/5
Value: 3/5
Location: 5/5

-Bon Appétit. :)

Description : It was my wife's birthday, we both like chinese food a lot and heard a lot about this place. So went there to try this place with groupon coupon. The offer was excellent which offered 2 servings of soup (1/2 portions), 1 starter, 1 main course, 1 Desert & 2 Mocktails at Rs 649/-. The foods were served hot. Hot & Sour Soup was good. Burmese soup was different. Was little similar to khowsuey but was much lighter than it. Crispy chilli babycorn was awesome. Stir-fried Vegetables ware ok. Zuchhini in it was bitter which spoiled the taste of whole dish. Vegetable Coins (Veg Manchurian)
 were very good. We dnt liked Broccoli , Babu Corn and Tofu in Spicy Orange Ginger Sauce at all. It was too sweet. Burnt Chilli Garlic Noodles were awesome. A must try. Ginger and Capsicum Fried Rice were average. Friend Ice Cream with Hot Chocolate Sauce

Chilli Wok is one of the few Chinese restaurants that have a huge vegetarian spread. Vegetarians will be spoilt for choice! Soups are great and loved the Four treasure exotic vegetables. Chilli garlic noodles were awesome. Quantity is in a good proportion and we were stuffed by the time we came ti the desserts. Would definitely go back for more.

Situated at the Myx, park street. Valet parking too available, it's very difficult to find parking area in park street. Went there on my birthday. I really loved dese as I just entered I just saw my cake as well as welcome drink as in long Island iced tea. Staffs were courteous. Service was good. Ambience was mediocre. It gives the feeling of a Chinese restaurant. It is lovely build up. Quantity is too much. We could not opt to order main course too. Starters only made our stomach full. Next time surely will visit to enjoy others food items.

Went there in search of fried ice cream to be honest. We tried the Thai red curry and it was awesome. Their service is really good. The staff is very courteous. I was a little apprehensive about the fried ice cream since the size was bigger than the ones I had before. It was also surprisingly good. It came in 2 pieces in one serving but if it would be better if they had 6 pieces in one serving in smaller portions then it would be easier to eat them to feel the ice cream melt inside the mouth. The ambiance was in the Chinese theme. A very welcoming place, must try to experience the service of the good fine dining restaurant.

After ages I had such heavenly Thai, Burmese and Chinese food all under one roof in Kolkata. The place occupies a prime location at Park Street and is sure to surprise you on your first visit with its vast detailed menu, lovely service and great quality of food. The restaurant is tucked away in one of the floors of the exquisite hospitality address, Myx with classy interiors and nicely decorated lobby where you can wait for your entire gang and when you are all set to go just avail the elevator (which is quite close to the waiting area) to arrive at this dimly-lit nicely decorated restaurant at the second floor. Apart from fabulous food, the place also has a small well-stocked bar, so you can surely loosen up a bit and have some great time here. If you compare this place with the other big shots at Park Street then in terms of age it’s just an infant, but this only factor doesn’t holds it back from being one of the best Oriental food joints in this part of the city.

LOCATION - - - - - The place is located at the 2nd floor of Myx which is located directly opposite Golden Spoon and diagonally opposite Peter Cat, beside KFC. It is the exact spot where Sourav’s used to be. The building is quite easy to spot (once you reach that area) with ‘Myx’ written in several boards and a typical colorful exterior where the facade of the building is built in sandstone with laser-cut lights emitting through peeled metallic sheets that gives an lovely overall effect. Also don’t worry about car parking; the place has got valet parking for guests which is an additional benefit, considering the parking hassles you face while you are at Park Street.

AMBIANCE - - - - - We chose a table just beside a huge dark wall with those Chinese inscriptions. The place has got modern Oriental interiors with authentic Chinese décor items and elegant wooden flooring. The furnitures are classy and the overall dimly-lit setup with soothing Chinese instrumentals in the background sets the mood right. Staffs are well dressed and polite. Loved the wall arts and floral motifs. Also I really liked the serving plates and bowls and certainly my well-designed chopsticks. I would suggest placing chopsticks on tables along with spoon and fork from beforehand so that guests need not ask for them.

FOOD - - - - - Below are the items we ordered for:

<< SOUPS >>

(a) Moo Hin Nga – Probably one of the best soups tried in my life. I finished the bowl in an utter urgency as if someone’s going to snatch it away from me! :) It is a Burmese Fish noodle soup having ground fish, garlic, bits of rice noodles, onion and cilantro. It was a joy to have this piece of gastronomical wonder and I bet I can savor couple of bowls of this stuff before every meal of mine at this place. Must try!

(b) Tom Kha Gai – After that wonderful Fish Soup I greedily took this entire bowl of Tom Kha Gai as I am an absolute fan of Thai cuisine and the ingredients they use! It is basically a chicken soup in dense coconut milk having ingredients like lemongrass, lime juice, galangal, tomatoes and tender chicken pieces. Again you should definitely try this out if you love the flavor and aroma of coconut milk, which I absolutely do! Must try!

(c) Chicken Wanton Clear Soup – And this was my third bowl of soup in less than 10 minutes! It was very different from the last two thickish soups which were laden with rich aromatic ingredients. I love Tung Nam’s Wanton soup which is an absolute delicacy and this Wanton soup here was close to it and apt to wash down all the rich ingredients of the past two soups. It had soft meaty chicken fillings covered in their silky wanton skin which was a joy when put inside your mouth. The broth has a subtle flavor and aroma to it. Again a Must try!

<< STARTERS >>

(a) Steamed Vegetable Dimsum – One of the best Dimsums available in the Park Street area. These steamed dumplings should be picked up by your chopsticks and transferred straight to your mouth; the explosion of glory will soon follow! They are super-soft, thin-skinned and overloaded with rich ingredients and minced veggies inside that will surely please your taste buds and inner soul. Will try the chicken/pork version of these dimsums next time. Must try!

(b) Drums of Heaven – One very common Chinese starter to say the least, the stuff was meaty, prepared perfectly and presented beautifully with finely chopped spring onion leaves all over.

(c) Crispy Chilli Baby Corn Sichan Style – Again a dish that is pretty common to us, especially when we decide to have only veg starters. The dish was prepared well and can surely be tried, though in general I personally prefer to stay away from it for my non-vegetarian preferences of food :)

(d) Yue Yang Spicy Berbecued Fish – I absolutely loved this dish and would like to recommend this to everyone. It was tad spicy and super tasty, the fish in there was fresh, well marinated and stir fried with spring onions in oyster chilli sauce. Must try!

(e) Wok Tossed Crispy Lemon Honey Chicken – The chicken cubes or pieces were tad too fried for my liking to get that crispy nature. Though the stuff tasted pretty good in that honey chilli sauce.

<< MOCKTAILS >>

(a) Orange Chilli Cooler – Oh this is a gem of a mocktail and I would go for this everytime I’m here. It was an orange juice based cooler with a dash of spicy hot chilli and jaljeera in it. Super refreshing! Must try!

(b) Blue Lagoon – This was kinda okayish and the flavor was totally eclipsed by the super flavorful and tasty Orange Chilli cooler. Neither did it look that promising nor that ‘blue’!

<< MAINS >>

(a) Thai Minced Basil Chicken – I absolutely love Thai dishes having lemongrass, lime and basil leaves in them. Thai Minced Basil Chicken is kinda common Thai dish at many eateries in Thailand and when I tasted it here the stuff tasted pretty authentic. The sweet basil with minced chicken is an absolute joy with some steamed rice. But please be noted that the dish is basically pretty dry and it different from Thai green, red or yellow curry!

(b) Bangkok Chicken – We were pleasantly surprised with this dish as it was super tasty and soul satisfying. I had recommended this dish and couple of my friends who were not so acquainted with Thai cuisine decided to have that faith in me; I was overjoyed to see the expression on their faces when they first tried this dish with some steamed rice! They were extremely pleased and their facial expressions told the story and I didn’t have to wait for their words in appreciation of this dish. Very well marinated tender chicken pieces covered in Thai spices with all the seasonal veggies and potato cubes. It had key Thai ingredients like galangal, basil leaves, kafir lime and coconut milk. It’s so soothing and amazing. Must try!

(c) Shredded Chicken in Garlic Sauce – This dish was suggested by the person looking after our table and I bet it was a lovely suggestion. It had the right proportion of ginger and garlic to it with white scallions and tender chicken pieces.

(d) Burnt Chilli garlic Noodles – Oh I absolutely loved the aroma of burnt garlic in there, as the name suggests it was tad spicy that gave it the kick. Loads of veggies and nicely tossed and stir fired noodles, sure you can go for this.

(e) Burnt garlic Fried Rice – Similar to the noodles it had lovely aroma of burnt garlic minus the spiciness which is apt for a rice preparation. Had veggies like onion, beans, spring onions, tomatoes, etc and tasted great. Also to mention, I loved the cucumber salad and kimchi salad that were provided on our table, I almost finished the kimchi salad as it had the right proportion of all the small ingredients giving it that perfect taste.

<< DESSERTS >>

(a) Fried Ice Cream with Hot Chocolate Sauce – We were extremely filled when the three desserts were served on our table. Most of us had surrendered by then. But this Fried Ice cream was so good I kept on scooping it down till it was almost finish. Loved that crispy fried exterior and that vanilla ice cream inside with sprinkled hot chocolate sauce, the brownie base and cherry on top added the ultimate punch to it that is unforgettable. Must try!

(b) Hot Chocolate Roll – The much talked about dessert of Chilli Wok. Almost everyone has recommended it in their review. And yes, it tasted great, a piece of heaven for chocolate lovers, but for ice cream fanatics like me I would prefer a dollop of vanilla ice cream along with it. I was actually having some ice cream while I finished couple of these rolls. Must try!

(c) Darsan with Ice Cream – Common darsan with two scoops of vanilla ice cream, nothing fancy and the dish tasted perfectly fine with a tad too sweet darsan, but that’s okay for my sweet tooth.

SERVICE - - - - - One of the highlights of this place is their courteous service. The person (called Mr.Prasenjit) looking after our order was the in-charge that day and he was extremely efficient, polite and prompt. He remembered our order and didn’t even note it down on paper, he remembered this long list of food items we had ordered and nothing was missed in the end, that’s highly commendable. He had a candid chat with me about staff training, food and the service in general and discussed how their staffs were trained every week on special cuisines like Thai, Burmese and Japanese. I actually found couple of their staffs not very acquainted with all the ingredients like lemongrass, basil leaf, etc used in the Thai dishes but I believe they will soon be trained in this line.

PRICE - - - - - The high quality food at this place comes with a price tag and is quite a pricey affair without any discount or coupon :) Though we were handed few meal coupons for two by Prasenjit which are infact quite reasonably priced.

CONCLUSION - - - - - Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 3.8/5
Food quality: 4.3/5
Food presentation: 4/5 
Value for money: 3.7/5 
Ambiance: 3.9/5
Service: 4.2/5

Overall rating comes to nearly 4 out of 5. That clearly indicates the high quality this place has to offer. Definitely try this place out and leave your comments below for your recommendations which I can try out next time. This place was absolutely amazing and a piece of heaven for crazy lovers of Thai cuisine, like me! Big thumbs up from my end. Do visit them soon, if you already haven’t!

Cheers!

It's located on the 2nd floor of myx. 
I had gone there yesterday for dinner. I was greeted well by their staff. Even though I am a vegetarian I had no issues in ordering food. They have enough for us vegetarians. And I was very happy with their food and service. The service was fast and the waiters were paying attention to whatever we said.
 All in all they know their food and they know their customers.

Had dinner last night at chilli Wok. Place is ParkStreet ( they may have changed the name but it will be Park Street to me always) , the most exciting place in kolkata. Ambience at the restaurant was nice. Foods look attractive when served & also taste good. We ordered a crab preparation that was really good. Oh I should have told about the soup and the starter first. A clear soup with crab was ordered and the crabs came as dumplings floating in the soup. That's new idea, never had before. The chicken starter was as usual nothing extraordinary. Pan fried noddlesws ok. Mixed Fried rice was good. We enjoyed the dinner. Quite a numbers of Chinese restaurants are there at Park Street, some are old enough. I am having chinese there from my young age . They are nostalgic. But if new ones are added they are welcome. Usually I go to Park st 2 or 3 times a month, surely -- destination Oxford Book Store in search of books . I will go to Chilli Wok again.

One of the better Oriental Outlets in Town.

 Kolkata, as we have already known and appreciate is a town flooded with Chinese Restaurants, and making a position of it's own, sharing the same theme is a tough nut, no doubt.

However, Chilli Wok breaks the nut. Starting from the decor to the courtesy of the staff, to the food proportion, quality, creativity all are on higher side.

The new trend in town is. every person now, wants something new and in keeping this pace, I have seen restaurants mostly suffer in creating tastes, which becomes too challenging. So, balancing between the creativity and taste is a must and here is where this restaurant scores the goal.

Decor: Suites the Oriental theme. .5 marks deducted for the little torn Menu Card.
Proportion: One plate easily suffice 3
Value to Money: Excellent
Food: All items are Excellent.

Must Try: 

1) Moo Hin Nga (Soup): I love soups. I have tried good soups in many good places n must say this soup holds it's highest position with Muligatwanny (in Tamarind), Chimney Soup (in many other Chinese Restaurants), Lemon-Coriander Soup (Mainland China) in Kolkata. Try only if you love Coconut Milk.

2) Drunken Fried Rice (Rice): Mildly spicy and Basil flavored. I havent tried anything like this in town. Delicious.

Overall excellent experience. Hope it keeps its pace with the Towns nerve.

I came to know about this restro through ZOMATO....and i am happy that ultimately i hd decided  to go there...the food is awsome.... ambience is  soooo romantic....hospitality is really good.....i hv given 4.5 rating only for one reason....we decided to sit at one corner of d restaurant just beside lamps and their entry door and unfortunately we were feeling really hot...as d a.c was not functioning properly there....
Now coming to the food...we ordered

2) chicken dimsum (not upto the mark as they had set already a very good level for themselves)
3) yuxiang shredded chicken in garlic sauce (awsome)
4) kung pao chicken (taste is much  more better than any other restaurant's preparation that i hv tasted before)
5) drunken fried rice (i hv never tasted this kind of frie rice ever....its really good...one should try this preparation )...

We had gone here for lunch this Saturday afternoon where we got some special offers running in their restaurant. I'm not quite a big Oriental cuisine fan but I like it once in a while. This was located on the second floor and we were welcomed with wet towels after we got seated. We had a 5 course lunch where we ordered a chicken lung fung soup and Wok tossed lemon honey chicken for starters. The soup was pretty average but I completely loved the appetizer. It was amazingly delicious. For main course we ordered Burnt Garlic Chicken hakka noodles and yuxiang shredded chicken in garlic sauce and both the dishes were well prepared. The chicken in garlic sauce had that perfect flavour that went very well with the noodles. For desserts since they didn't have too many options available so we went with the classic Darsaan with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I love darsaan and sadly this place didn't make it as well. Apart from the desserts I really liked the food here and wouldn't mind coming back to this place.

Tried this place with a friend. Nice place, nice ambience. We had the manchow soup, three spicy mushroom, chilli garlic noodles with four treasure vegetables and fried ice cream for desserts. The soup was good, even the starter was very good. But the four treasure was very mediocre. The burnt ginger garlic chilli noodles is a must try. It was very good. We also had fried ice cream which was good. Overall it was a good experience but it's a little expensive.

Situated in the lane where music world was there in Park Street, just behind KFC on the second floor of MYX. Chinese restaurant. 

The ambience is very good.  Staff courteous, smiling. For service full 5 points.

We ordered Dimsums for starters , fried rice and exotic vegetables in wine white sauce for main course.  
Quality of food very good. 

The only reason why I am giving one point less is for the taste. Slightly below expectation.

In a city flooded with authentic and celebrated Chinese and Pan Asian restuarants it's indeed difficult and uphill for a new start-up to establish an unique name for itself in a short span of time and thats exactly what Chilli Wok has done..With its unique offerings, unconventional taste and flawless hospitality it has already cemented its name among the elite class of restuarants in the City..
Last week I finally had the opportunity to take time out after several postponments to visit this place for its authentic and delightful gastronomic experience..Located on 2nd floor of Myx complex this place is beautifully decorated keeping in line with the theme of oriental cuisine..Beautiful motifs and statues..comfortable seating arrangements,soothing lighting and the soft chinese tunes playing in the background definitely add to the mood..Coming to service I must say this place scores high on hospitality quotient..our server kept carefull look out for even minute needs and attended us even before asking for the same..
Coming to the food we ordered:
Spicy Orange Mocktail and Blue Lagoon: Spicy Orange mocktail taste quite refreshing and a perfect start to the meal..blend of jaljeera provides the perfect punch..Blue Lagoon was a tad more sweeter to my likings..
Moo Hin Nga: A Thai Fish Noodle soup..my mind was blown by its taste..haven't tasted anything like this before..mild concoction of coconut milk,fish chunks and rice noodles..i am not generally a soupy person but even I can't ignore this taste..
Yue Yang Spicy Barbecued Fish: Perfect balance of flavours..what I liked the fish was not over fried and flavours were intact..loved the assortment of spices..
Drums of Heaven: It was infact a bit too pungent and spicy,something which everyone may not prefer..Personally loved the taste of pepper and chillies in it..
Chilli Garlic Noodles: Just the perfect staple for your meal..its absolutely delicious.. portion was generous and the noodles was beautifully seasoned and tossed..
Pan Fried Noodles: This tasted also quite great..loved the crispiness of noodles in the dish alongwith the generous presence of proteins and veggies..
Fish in Hunan Chilli Sauce: It blends perfectly with chilli garlic noodles which is a bit too spicy..fresh chunks of fish in a white sauce tossed with capsicum and chillies and have a nice subtle taste that do not attack your taste buds..
Yuxiang Shredded Chicken in Garlic Sauce: Ordered in on the server's recommendation..Honestly I was not impressed by its taste much after having such great dishes..It was a bit too sweet and somewhat missed the punch as expected..
Hot Chocolate Rolls: If someone feels it can't get better after the mains wait for the Desert!! This unique preparation with equally amazing presentation took the whole experience to the next level..Wanton rolls filled with chocolate and served in a base of chocolate sauce..someone cant feel the flavours until you taste it.. Passionately Recommended..
Overall it was as good an experience as it can be..Special mention to the aesthetic presentation of the dish and the hygiene quotient..Prices are a bit on the higher side but given the experience and the unique flavours I feel it is somewhat justified
Food: 4.5/5
Pricing: 3.5/5
Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5

Decided to go to  Chilli Wok for lunch, as I heard a lot of good reviews about the food and is also conveniently located next to KFC, Park Street. We were ushered into the 2nd Floor restaurant and on entering it , got a good vibe from the place. The decor is done very tastefully, and is a sublime blend of hues and accent pieces; very soothing and pleasing.

We decided to have the chicken sweet corn soup which was very pleasantly different than the ones I have had so far. Instead of shredded chicken, it was mince chicken so there was a good bit of chicken and corn in every spoonful of soup. We tried the famed specialty - the drums of heaven - the best I have had so far. it was crispy and juicy and had the right blend of spices and flavour. Definitely a must-have at Chilli Wok. For main course, we had the Chicken and Egg Burnt garlic friend rice and Bekti fish in Hot garlic sauce. The rice was really good, only thing is that they can increase the quantity as it is slightly less for 2 people. The Fish was amazing,it was fresh and blended with the sauce to perfection. Each bit was a slice of heaven. For dessert, we had the Fried ice cream, which was awesome. 

It was a very feel-good experience which I will ensure to repeat. The servers and attendants were polite and helpful. The service could be a wee bit faster but on the whole an incredible gastronomic outing which will be remembered for some time, at least till the time I go back again to sample the other wares on the menu.

Saturday evening and nice weather demands a splendid dinner. And if it is accompanied by nice Chinese food, nothing can be better than that.

I visited this place with family after an urge to try something unique and diverse Asian/Chinese victuals. We had already seen the pictures of the restaurant before but the pleasantness, spacious and beautiful setup feels completely different and more of the usual soothe and looks. 

Staff is courteous and service is really good. The attendant was very cooperative and explained to us every dish we intended to order.

Now coming to food, they have some quite inimitable Chinese dishes starting from a spicy flavor to bland taste (which does taste good as if you are willing to have it :)

Manchow Soup is a definite try with noodle sticks. The level of spiciness was also fine. Lemon Coriander Soup was on a sweeter side. Crispy Chilli Babycorn was fabulous as usual. Dimsums weren’t extraordinary…even lacked the amount of spices.

For the main course, Vegetable Coins were crisp yet soft…not overly loaded with veggies [a good sign]. The chef’s special Broccoli and Tofu in Spicy Ginger Sauce was an absolute delight. Four Treasure Exotic Vegetables were something hadn’t had before. Cooked in ginger and wine sauce I had never loved veggies like that ante.

All that to go with Burnt Chilli Garlic Noodles and Pan-Fried Noodles…super combination. The dishes magnificently covered quantum of flavors that Chinese cuisines hold.

Fried Ice Cream with Hot Chocolate Sauce was blissfully antithetic. Hot Chocolate Roll was so-so. The mocktails were also average.

Chilli Wok scores full marks in all respects of ambiance, food and service. It’s an absolute worth the money spent. Will recommend everyone to visit this place to taste amazing Asian delicacies .

Been there yesterday to meet a friend for lunch who was leaving for the US. He found this amazing offer for a veg meal for 2 on Groupon and decided to rendezvous for lunch here. The food offered on the Groupon was a lot.. Enough for two people. We were entitled to one soup,two Mocktails one curry, one main course and finally one dessert which was enough to fill our stomachs. :P for the Mocktails we ordered the blue lagoon which had a very pretty blue colour and tasted equally good. Also we ordered the manchow soup which was an absolute delight! I am not a great fan of soups and to my surprise this just won my heart. It is simply amazing and is my favourite now! For the main course we ordered the Cantonese style noodles and for curry we chose the dish which had 4 Chinese vegetables tossed in wine sauce. Both of which were awesome. The dessert was the highlight of the meal..We ordered the hot rolls in chocolate sauce. It is heaven,to describe in a word. The staff is nice and courteous and very friendly. They know the menu well and help you to decide what to eat. The only -0.5 is for the lack of options for veggies in the curry section. Apart from that this place has a thumbs up from my side.

P.S.- they also play Chinese music in the background which is WOW!

This was a totally unplanned visit. T & I wanted to go to UD-9F, but on that particular day, almost the whole of Kolkata was under knee-deep water. So had to ditch the plan after seeing the state of Camac Street & we had to quickly decide on some other place. We decided to go to Park Street, hoping with all our might that the situation will be better there. Thank God that it was, & on getting down at Park Street, we quickly decided on this place as we were in the mood of visiting a new restaurant. We reached Chilli Wok at around 2:50pm & as soon as we entered, we were told that their lunch hours were over. We were very disheartened & seeing that, the manager told us to wait for a minute & went away. He came back a few moments later with a smile on his face & told us that they would serve us. The place had thus already won a major portion of our hearts by this gesture :)

We were seated comfortably. The place has an awesome ambience. The chairs with the Chinese alphabets, the table mats, the lighting, Chinese calligraphy on the coasters on the tables, the Cherry Blossom wallpapers, the Chinese music which creates a very calming & soothing environment, even the washroom doors with motifs of a traditional Chinese Man & Woman - the Chinese theme truly speaks out to you from every nook & cranny. The crockery used is a delight as well. No matter what the occassion- be it a family lunch/dinner, a meal with your friends, or a date- the place will surely tick all the right boxes.

We placed all our order at once. The weather demanded a soup to be had, so we ordered a Chicken Lung Fung Soup. For mains, we ordered a Pad Thai Noodles & a Bhetki in Chilli Hunan Sauce. The soup was served with prawn crackers. The warm soup was delicious & was a perfect start to our lunch after spending the previous 2 hours wading through the flooded streets of Kolkata. The prawn crackers were also good & they had a distinct flavour of prawn. The mains came in big quantities, & one staple accompanied with a side dish will be filling enough for two. The Phad Thai was delicious. We could make out the taste of tamarind really well. The Chilli Bhetki was a bit sour in taste & maybe would have been a better accompaniment to some other staple, but on its own, the dish was very good. The fish tasted very fresh & there were about 13-14 pieces of fish in the dish. We skipped desserts.

The service was very very good. Even though their lunch hours were over, they did not rush us at all & were courteous enough to ask for our feedback after every course.

All in all, it was a great experience & I am looking forward to visiting the place again as soon as possible :)

I am so excited to review this place.This place was in my wishlist and finally i had a chance to have a great dinner tonight and all courtsy goes to groupon for such wonderful offer.
Now talking about Chilli Wok,its in the 2nd floor of MYX; not that much spacious but cosy.Staffs are nice and will guide you about food.In offer there was a soup,starter,rice/noodles,side dish,moctails,desert.
I liked all the items but special mention goes to the barbequed fish starter and fried icecream which is a scoop of vanila icecream with a fried coating decorated with chocolate and cherry on the top.
I personally liked the place,the chairs for its proper back support and the fried icecream...

I found this awesome deal on groupon and instantly grabbed it. Chilli wok at myx had been on my list from a long time. I called a day in advance and made the reservation. The staff is extremely polite and helpful. Service is excellent, they do their best to give u a memorable time. I ordered the chicken hot and sour soup which was excellent, thick and full of flavour and spice. Ordered drums of heaven for a the starter which was done perfectly, crispy and light, what I loved was the presentation of the dishes. The chef really worked on making the food look gastronomical and beautiful which other places don't concentrate upon. Loved the way the food was garnished! Ordered the chandu pepper chicken and burnt garlic noodles for the main. The chicken was not tht good, but the noodles were yummy! However the quantity of the noodles for two is very very less. They should increase the quantity of the noodles. V had surplus chicken left due to less quantity of noodles. The star of the day was the hot chocolate roll.. Fried wanton  filled with brownie and served with hot chocolate sauce is heavenly!! We were served blue lagoon too.. I loved the experience. The place has an amazing ambience too. A must try for all!!

A long due must visit place on the list...gladly got an opportunity thanks to Groupon. .Though the meal was on deal yet they royally pampered us with steamy freshly cooked Chinese fare.

The hot and sour soup was really spicy yet good on flavours..the Singaporean spring rolls were extremely crisp and appeared more like a Chinese samosa unlike the usual spring rolls.

The chilly and burnt garlic noodles was yummy and the exotic veggies in ginger wine sauce really complemented it well.

The desserts we chose were chocolate roll.I felt the filling of chocolate ganache was a bit dry yet the outer part was nice and crisp. 

More power to the team and thanks to Groupon it was a total paisa vasool meal. #groupon

Chilli Wok was on the top of my wishlist for a long time. One morning i found an excellent deal on groupon and i grabbed it immediately. So today i visited chilli wok with the groupon voucher.

The location is very prominent. Opposite to peter cat is kfc, beside which is the myx building whose second floor houses chilli wok.

The ambience is awesome. The woodwork on the walls, the false ceiling, the statue everything presnted an amazing picturesque. The chinese music was soothing and added to the soothing ambience

I ordered the fish noodle soup. It was served in two bowls. The soup tasted fresh and had a very aromatic flavour. It had huge chunks of fish with singaporean noodles. It was perefct to start our meal.

For starters, we ordered drums of heaven. It looked great but was not that good. The outer layer was fried so much that it was too crispy. The dish lacked texture but the taste was nice with the right amount of spices.

In our mains, we had ordered drunken chicken fried rice with kung pao chicken. I was a little disappointed with the amount of rice served. It was right for one person but since two persons were served, a little more quantity should have been entertained. But i was blown away by the taste. The fried rice tasted yum with decent amount of chicken pieces. The kung pao chicken was too good. The chicken was so soft that it just melted in the mouth and all my complaints vanished instantly. The kung pao chicken i had here was one of the best chinese main course that i ever had. With fried rice it tasted too good. Infact the taste was so good that we could feel the lack of rice.

Along with main course, we were served mocktails. One was blue lagoon and the other was orange chiller. The blue lagoon tasted decent with a light lime soda flavour. The orange chiller was spicy and had a jaljeera flavour in it. Both were equally good.

Now all is well that ends well and to prove this statement true, came chef's special hot chocolate roll. It was just out of the world. The roll was made of flour and the filling was of chocolate cake. It was too tasty.

I'm actually thankful to groupon for providing such an awesome deal otherwise an amazing place like this would have been left undiscovered.

The service was very very good. Even though their lunch hours were over, they did not rush us at all & were courteous enough to ask for our feedback after every course.

All in all, it was a great experience & I am looking forward to visiting the place again as soon as possible :)

I am so excited to review this place.This place was in my wishlist and finally i had a chance to have a great dinner tonight and all courtsy goes to groupon for such wonderful offer.
Now talking about Chilli Wok,its in the 2nd floor of MYX; not that much spacious but cosy.Staffs are nice and will guide you about food.In offer there was a soup,starter,rice/noodles,side dish,moctails,desert.
I liked all the items but special mention goes to the barbequed fish starter and fried icecream which is a scoop of vanila icecream with a fried coating decorated with chocolate and cherry on the top.
I personally liked the place,the chairs for its proper back support and the fried icecream...

I found this awesome deal on groupon and instantly grabbed it. Chilli wok at myx had been on my list from a long time. I called a day in advance and made the reservation. The staff is extremely polite and helpful. Service is excellent, they do their best to give u a memorable time. I ordered the chicken hot and sour soup which was excellent, thick and full of flavour and spice. Ordered drums of heaven for a the starter which was done perfectly, crispy and light, what I loved was the presentation of the dishes. The chef really worked on making the food look gastronomical and beautiful which other places don't concentrate upon. Loved the way the food was garnished! Ordered the chandu pepper chicken and burnt garlic noodles for the main. The chicken was not tht good, but the noodles were yummy! However the quantity of the noodles for two is very very less. They should increase the quantity of the noodles. V had surplus chicken left due to less quantity of noodles. The star of the day was the hot chocolate roll.. Fried wanton  filled with brownie and served with hot chocolate sauce is heavenly!! We were served blue lagoon too.. I loved the experience. The place has an amazing ambience too. A must try for all!!

A long due must visit place on the list...gladly got an opportunity thanks to Groupon. .Though the meal was on deal yet they royally pampered us with steamy freshly cooked Chinese fare.

The hot and sour soup was really spicy yet good on flavours..the Singaporean spring rolls were extremely crisp and appeared more like a Chinese samosa unlike the usual spring rolls.

The chilly and burnt garlic noodles was yummy and the exotic veggies in ginger wine sauce really complemented it well.

The desserts we chose were chocolate roll.I felt the filling of chocolate ganache was a bit dry yet the outer part was nice and crisp. 

More power to the team and thanks to Groupon it was a total paisa vasool meal. #groupon

Chilli Wok was on the top of my wishlist for a long time. One morning i found an excellent deal on groupon and i grabbed it immediately. So today i visited chilli wok with the groupon voucher.

The location is very prominent. Opposite to peter cat is kfc, beside which is the myx building whose second floor houses chilli wok.

The ambience is awesome. The woodwork on the walls, the false ceiling, the statue everything presnted an amazing picturesque. The chinese music was soothing and added to the soothing ambience

I ordered the fish noodle soup. It was served in two bowls. The soup tasted fresh and had a very aromatic flavour. It had huge chunks of fish with singaporean noodles. It was perefct to start our meal.

For starters, we ordered drums of heaven. It looked great but was not that good. The outer layer was fried so much that it was too crispy. The dish lacked texture but the taste was nice with the right amount of spices.

In our mains, we had ordered drunken chicken fried rice with kung pao chicken. I was a little disappointed with the amount of rice served. It was right for one person but since two persons were served, a little more quantity should have been entertained. But i was blown away by the taste. The fried rice tasted yum with decent amount of chicken pieces. The kung pao chicken was too good. The chicken was so soft that it just melted in the mouth and all my complaints vanished instantly. The kung pao chicken i had here was one of the best chinese main course that i ever had. With fried rice it tasted too good. Infact the taste was so good that we could feel the lack of rice.

Along with main course, we were served mocktails. One was blue lagoon and the other was orange chiller. The blue lagoon tasted decent with a light lime soda flavour. The orange chiller was spicy and had a jaljeera flavour in it. Both were equally good.

Now all is well that ends well and to prove this statement true, came chef's special hot chocolate roll. It was just out of the world. The roll was made of flour and the filling was of chocolate cake. It was too tasty.

I'm actually thankful to groupon for providing such an awesome deal otherwise an amazing place like this would have been left undiscovered.

The word is 'awesum' after this place. This place was on my wishlist from a long time at last went today. Went for a lunch with a friend of mine .
Coming to the ambience of the restaurant. It was very soothing environment. Very beautifully decorated and very tinge and corner was well connected with the theme and cuisine of the food. Light music was being played on. Dim lights. Beautiful chairs and tables ..I would say comfortable chairs with long back rests was quiet good. Cutlery was very impressive. The spoons plates bowls to be mentioned was very impressive and well designed.
Coming on to food... it was awesum . Tastes yum. Well prepared. Served hot.
The staff was very polite and courteous and kept on asking after every meal about how is the food and if there is any issue they would change the dish instantly . And the bestest part was the desert. I became fan of the place because of desert . Had fried ice cream with chocolate sauce and it was just amazing superb. I would surely go again and have it. Guys must visit once.

So I went there on the 31st December and there was no À la carte but a Buffet on offer. There was plenty to choose from and food was delicious. The ambiance was noteworthy and the waiters were well mannered and attentive hence the overall experience was nice.
There was complimentary Wine (Sula it was I guess)
Shall visit again to check what À la carte here has to offer.

Location: 2nd Floor, The Myx; Diagonally opposite Peter Cat Restaurant.

Chilli Wok had been on my list of must visits for quite sometime now and was finally struck off on May 24, 2015 over a family dinner at 20:30 hours. Since the visit was on a Sunday, reservations were made.

About the AMBIANCE, the décor was such that it elegantly gave the place a very classical touch of a Chinese restaurant. Full length rolling lanterns, fabricated & laser cut ceiling lights, Feng Sui and other antique type show pieces, in-scripted stone walls and carvings added to the interiors. The seating arrangement was such that it could easily accommodate fifty heads at one go.

About the FOOD, the well-drafted book-type menu had Chinese, Thai and a couple of dishes from the Burmese and Japanese cuisines to offer. The following were ordered:

- Manchow Soup
Was nicely prepared having a thick consistency. Served along with crispy noodles.

- Lemon Coriander Soup
The broth was flavorful and had a generous coriander flavor. Could have done with a little more lemon grass flavor, was quite low.

- Vegetable Wontons (Fried) [8 pieces]
Crisp but, slightly greasy wontons with a flavorful filling. Served along with sweet chilli sauce. Tasted good.

- American Corn Salt n' Pepper
Perfectly batter-fried corns tossed along with sautéed veggies and seasoned with salt and pepper. Tasted great.
Recommended.

- Burnt Garlic Noodles
This variant (of burnt chilli garlic noodles) was suggested by the server since we wished for something with less spice. 
Perfectly boiled noodles tossed with veggies and garlic. Topped with chopped garlic pieces and served. Tasted great.
Recommended.

- Four Treasure Vegetables
Assortment of exotic veggies (Babycorn, broccoli, zucchini) in butter garlic sauce. Delicious!
Recommended.

- Burmese Khowsuey
The khowsuey was served in two parts: Khowsuey base and add-ons .
The base had boiled noodles in coconut milk. Perfectly prepared. The flavor of coconut milk was slurp! The add-ons comprised of burnt garlic, fried shallots, chilli flakes, lemon wedges, chopped peanuts, coriander leaves and spring onions.
The khowsuey was prepared as per personal preference and tasted awesome!
Highly recommended!

- Fried Ice-cream with Hot Chocolate Sauce
Frozen Vanilla ice-cream coated with coconut shavings deep fried and served with little piece of chocolate muffin/cake as the base and topped with a generous drizzle of chocolate sauce and cherry. Tasted heavenly!
Recommended.

- Chilli Pepper Cranberry (Mocktail)
Do not remember the exact name, but, the Mocktail was nicely prepared with the chilli zing being on the higher end in the cranberry juice. Tasted decent. Flavors could be balanced and improved. The presentation resembled a devil's face with horns (as quoted by the little ones of the family). :P

About the SERVICE CONDUCT, the polite and well-informed staff helped us in the ordering process as well as served with a smile at a moderate speed.

About the PRICES, the above affair left our wallets lighter by INR 2980 (for five heads) implying the prices to be nearly inclined towards the higher end.

Overall a good experience.
- Would love to revisit. :)

Chilli Wok is located at a prime location and is hard to miss. Dimly lit, oriental themed and soothing ambience blended with some really great Asian food. The price may seem a little high as compared to other restaurants serving this cuisine but the quantities are pretty good. The calamari and the sesame fish are a must try. Loved my experience lunching here. Will definitely visit again!

Located just beside KFC, Chilli Wok at Myx is the newest addition in Park streets..The decor spots floral theme with oriental sculptures. The plc is not brightly lit.. It has a nyc ambience, soothing music and the plc had chinese inscriptions on the walls and chairs. We asked them for a simple chicken sweet corn soup amongst the various soups laid down in the menu.. The soup was nyc with the right amount of chicken and corns.. Next came the barbecued chicken.. It was simply Divine.. It had the right amount of sweetness and the chicken was grtt to munch on.. For main course we had ordered kung pao chicken which was grt too..it had sum pcs of cashew nut along wid the gravy.. The chicken pan fried rice was also delicious. Among the mocktails we opted fr a blue lagoon along wid orange chilli cooler.. The orange chilli cooler was simply amazing.. It was sweet and sour along with a dash of hot chilli seeds. It was served in a glass with jaljeera surrounding the upper circle.. Blue lagoon was good too.. For Dessert we opted for a fried ice cream.. This was sumthng which i tried for the first tym and i was simply in awe wid it! The best dessert tht i had aftr ages! Cumng to the hospitality and service, the waiters get a huge round of applause.. From helping us to select wht to eat to cumng down now and thn whether the food was nyc.. Thy were absolutely polite and always had a smile on thr face.. V rarely do i fynd waiters lyk this! Kuddos to thm fr their excellent service.. Keep it up!! Although this plc is a bit on the expensive side.. I do not mind cumng bk to this plc soon!

Had to wait for sometime in a busy weekend evening to get seats for two. Looking at the reviews, I tried this restaurant over Peter Cat, which is situated just opposite to it, but I was extremely disappointed after trying this out. Damn expensive place for not so exceptional food. Had better Chinese food at nearby restaurants. The waiters were courteous though, and ambiance okayish with light Chinese tune in the background.

Located just beside KFC, Chilli Wok at Myx is the newest addition to Park Street’s fleet of eateries. Focusing in oriental cuisine, the inner theme stay true to the cuisine the restaurant offers. The decor sports floral theme with oriental scriptures, ambiance was perfect and sitting arrangements were comfortable. This cosy restaurant is great for a lazy afternoon with friends.

With the ideology that a good, hearty soup starts every meal, we started with, ‘Moo Hin Nga’ (Fish Noodle) and ‘Chicken Peppery Lemon’ soups. First sip and felt moo hin nga was awesome. You can't and won't go wrong ordering this classic fish noodle soup - rich & flavourful broth, tender sliced fish, fresh bean sprouts and coriander, you might find yourself slurping it all up before you even realise. Side by side super flavourful chicken peppery lemon soup also had the right amount of spice and tang. Chicken Peppery Lemon soup was tangy yet subtly sweet, and will kick your butt with its spiciness.

I was glad that they have nice options for appetisers, comprising crispy chicken, stir-fried fish, deep fried prawns and wok tossed fish. In starters we don’t hesitate to order the ‘Drunken Fish’, a flavourful surprise with a nice bite complemented by the fresh Chinese wine. Alternatively, we play it safe with the ‘Yue Yang Spicy Barbecued Fish’, it was overwhelming in both texture and flavour combination. Certainly recommended the lip-smackingly good Yue Yang spicy barbecued fish and as well as flavourful drunken fish.

In main course we cherry-picked ‘Ginger and Capsicum Fried Rice with Wood-ear Mushrooms’, ‘Sichuan Mix Fried Rice’, ‘Chandu Style Chicken’, ‘Kung Pao Chicken’ and ‘Salads’ side by side ‘Sun Riser’ and ‘Blue Sky’ mocktails. Chandu Style Chicken was highly aromatic and spicier; also seasoned with sherry, so we choose to pair it with Sichuan Mix Fried Rice, blending of hot chillies with seafood, chicken, egg and onions. Without feeling compromising with our taste buds; the combination goes surprisingly well. Served with a generous amount of chicken strips, egg, fried shrimp, chilli and onions, the Ginger and Capsicum Fried Rice with Wood-ear Mushrooms is one of the best you can find. The Kung Pao Chicken - succulent pieces of chicken stir-fried in mild, savoury sauce with roasted peanuts in chilli vinegar, finished with soya sauce and wine. The Kung Pao Chicken was tender, flavourful, and goes exceedingly well with the accompanying Ginger and Capsicum Fried Rice. Both mocktails were nice but nothing special to write about them.

Finally it’s time for desserts and we decided to end our meal with their signature ‘Hot Chocolate Roll’ and ‘Darsan with Ice cream and Strawberry Sauce’. Be sure to start your dessert with Darsan, along with ice cream and strawberry sauce! This was the first time I tried Darsan with strawberry sauce and found it was very innovative. Thanks to chef for giving some twist to the same old darsan, fusion of strawberry sauce and vanilla ice cream scoop made it memorable. Next the ‘Hot Chocolate Roll’ perfectly sealed the lunch treat. The texture and taste of the hot chocolate roll was beautiful and definitely made a lovely dessert to finish off the meal.

With its more relaxed vibe and quiet location in Park Street, Chilly Wok makes for a nice hideout to have good oriental food.

Located on the second floor, above Myx. The sole idea of housing a disc and different cuisine restaurants on every floor does the trick!

The place might not be very big but was definitely full. Seemed like a pretty popular place on weekends. Food wise, the place was really recommendable. Definitely a recommended visit for everyone!

'Chilli Wok' is one of the best authentic chinese restaurant in kolkata after 'The Wall'. Today I've been there with my friends for lunch.It is located at 2nd floor of 'The Myx',opposite of Peter cat restaurant & beside the KFC at Park Street area.Ambience is very impressive,low light & slow chinese music is attracted the moment.Atfirst we've ordered one chicken Hot & sour soup and chicken Sichuan Soup.Both soups are tasty.Then we ordered Drums of Heaven & Crispy Fried Sesame Chicken as a starters.Drums of heaven is mouth watering,Crispy Fried Sesame Chicken is also tasty.Then we ordered main course like 'Burnt Chilli Garlic Noodles','Kung Pao Chicken','Schezwan Chicken' & 'Drunken Fried Rice' with 4 Mocktalis.All items are so delicious.Specially Drunken Fried Rice is quite impressive & tasty,smell is very flavourful.Atlast we've tasted their signature desserts like Hot Chocolate Roll & Fried Ice-cream with Hot Chocolate Sauce.Both are just extraordinary.Hot chocolate roll is mouthwatering.Kudos to chilli wok.Service is fast.Food Quality is great.price is little expensive.staffs are well behaved & very helpful.Thanks to them.

I'm utterly surprised to see this place got a 3.8 rating - must be because of food. Yes food is the only saving grace; however the staff behaviour is disastrous. Towards the end while we were still eating, they wanted us to leave in 10 mins because they had to arrange for an upcoming party - what a shame!

Not up to the , we went chilli Wok in group of 8, and experience ok type of service and food was not that great, might be we expected a lot because it is associated with MYX which is supposed to be one of the best disc in kolkata, nothing much say about food and ambience.

Happened to go here on a Sunday night (17th May) to celebrate my mother's birthday.
Was utterly disappointed by the service which is very slow! It was totally in contrast to what I read in the reviews. Firstly the staff took an eternity at every step right from serving the menu, placing the glasses etc. They had to be called for taking the orders while they seemed to be chatting away at a distance. Told them to increase the AC temperature and for 3 consecutive times they decreased it instead of increasing. Finally had to call the manager and switch it off.
A family beside my table called the manager and started shouting since they were waiting for a plate of noodles from 8pm to 9.30 and had to miss the movie they had planned that night.
Coming to the food, this was the only saving part. The quality was quite good. Had ordered Yue Yang Barbecued fish for starters. The fish was extremely fresh and tasty. Shirley temple as a mocktail was as good as you get in any other place. Pineapple rice was a good choice. The quantity isn't great. So if you are a big eater one plate will suffice a single person. Bangkok chicken is something which I had here for the first time. Not a bad try.
Overall the food is good but you need to think twice about the value for money!

Housed on the Floor number 2 of The Myx, opposite to Peter Cat, is this amazing and awesome chinese place, which is a must visit for all the chinese lovers out there.
We were on a tight schedule, so without much ado, we dived into the menu. Ordered a plate each of Drums of Heaven, Thai Drunken Mixed Fired Rice and Thai minced basil chicken. Now that I notice, they were all mentioned as chef's special. Anyway, that was the order. 
The drums arrived in about 10 minutes. 8 pieces of chicken lollipops on a bed of mashed potato and butter and some slices of carrots. They tasted absolutely heavenly. Spicy and extremely tasty. Loved it. And also, it was very filling. The rice and the minced chicken curry arrived shortly there after. We dug in. The  rice was more than sufficient for the two of us and had ample quantities of prawns, egg and chicken. I loved it. The curry was a little bland for my taste, a pinch of pepper did the trick for me. Overall, in terms of quality and quantity, absolutely no complaints. 
The total price, inclusive of taxes, around ₹1250. For me, a 5 star performance would have had that price within ₹1000. 
Visit here with your office colleagues and go dutch. Recommended for taking your loved ones for lunch/dinner!

Here is a restaurant on the 2nd floor of myx in Park Street good location obviously.
Ambience is good restro is not that big limited seating but decent well crafted good arrangements.
Now when you open the menu card you find great varieties of food items (chinese) to go with.
Starters main course deserts have new innovations and fresh approach to go with they are just awesome.
Food is good great taste but improvements are always welcomed.
Service is quite good attendants are good serve quite well a good package to go with.
Its is a bit expensive but if you decide going bar b q or flavours of china in park street why not chilli wok cant see much a difference in the green $$..
Should be tried  surely for its great taste and new fresh approach towards the chinese cuisine.

Chilli wok,  a thai restaurant on park street.  The draw back of this restaurant is that it isn't visible for all the fly in foodies. Unfortunately,  being located inside myx,  people tend to overlook the beauty of this place.  

If you are looking for Thai and Sushi,  this is the place to be.  We ordered lamb hun Shai and chicken in Thai green curry along with Cantonese noodles and murshoom-cabbage friend rice.  For sushi they didn't have salmon,  but th prawn sushi was also good nevertheless.  We also tasted calamari,  even though we are used to the ring shaped calamaris,  the shredded version they served wasn't pretty bad either. 

A simple cozy environment with Thai is what is the speciality of this place.  The quantity was also sufficient. 

We had a great time,  hope all the Thai lovers will visit the place soon.

One of the worst places I've visited in Kolkata!! Went with very high expectations seeing Myx and Ott. But this ones totally mismanage

Service was a total let down. On a Sunday night of your joint is empty then it doesn't mean you will take 1 hour to get the food so that visitors feel your place is packed.
We reached at 745 for dinner and after asking for the menu for almost 15 minuted was given. After placing the order they took almost 1 hour to get the food.

Visit this place only if you have ample time. And if you plan to go for dinner make sure you reach lunch time.

The waiters and managers had absolutely no manners. After complaining for so long the manager arrived and was told its OK if there is a delay but the food will come.
While their other joints ott and myx is so well managed, this ones totally Mismanaged!!

Highly disappointed !!!!

Opting for Chilli Wok for a family lunch on my sister's birthday proved to be a great choice. The moment we steppend into the myx building, the way through the mirrored elevator... to the first look of the restaurant.. everything seemed gorgeous.. i generally dislike places with low ceilings but suprisingly i felt this place was way beyond even slightest of discomfort. The hospitality from the staff was top notch and they tried their best to make us super comfortable.The dim lit interior set up with the chinese instrumental was perfect to set our mood for the meal.
Food scores really high.. The CHICKEN SWEET CORN SOUPS, YEING YANG SPICY BARBECUE FISH, PHAD THAI, PINEAPPLE FRIED RICE, BANGKOK CHICKEN.. everything was brilliant.. i specially recommend the fish starter. Portions were generous.. specially the fish and the phad thai came in humongous quantity.
We celebrated the special occasion with a birthday cake.. and they played the birthday tune in the background.. which was very special.. And thereafter complimented us with fried icecreams.. all of which made our experience even more delightful!
The next time.. we had the FISH NOODLE SOUP which was so innovative a dish.. n a must try; the DRUMS OF HEAVEN, DRUNKEN FRIED RICE.. THAI MINCED BASIL CHICKEN.. all on the average side.. YUXIANG CHICKEN IN GARLIC SAUCE.. was also very tasty.. and the HOT CHOCOLATE ROLLS.. again a must have!

Nice place... located just opposite to Peter Cat in the building called The Myx.. Went there to celebrate my anniversary... I wouldn't say the experience of visiting the place was too good rather it was pleasant...
 The credit goes to my better half not the restaurant...

Ambience: Was very good, and the staff gave us enough privacy though there were no other customers except us. The music, lighting, decoration all were in sync with the place. It made us feel very comfortable...

Service: The staff is courteous and deliver the dishes at the exact time when we need it. We didn't have to wait... after placing the order within 15 minutes we got our food...This kind of service is not even seen in many popular restaurants in Kolkata...

Food: This is where they faltered a bit... For starters we had Sesame fried fish which was a bit sour... Not even as delicious as expected it to be... Whereas I like fish items more than the chicken in Chinese food...

Inn the main course I ordered Burnt ginger fried rice with egg and chicken with Chandu style chicken.. These two were also okay...not which can send my taste buds to create a pandemonium in my brain... Which I get in The Orient, Bar b q.. two one of the best Chinese restaurants in Kolkata in my opinion... For the desert I ordered deep fried ice cream with hot chocolate sauce on top... this was more better than the starter and the main course.... 

They should really improve in this area as this is what which will keep them going... Not Every time people are supposed to come back only for their decoration and ambience.. Even the prices doesn't add up with the quality of the food served here... There are people who wouldn't bother to pay more if the Quality is top notch... 

So my verdict to everyone is The place might attract you like Tom Cruise of Top Gun... But while coming out you might feel like Sylvester Stallone did in Rambo when betrayed...

On an afternoon I and a friend of mine visited there..located in the building called mixed near peter cat...it has quite well behaved waiters,and quiet an appealing interiors...apt for those who seek for a bit of privacy as the day we visited there only we two were having lunch out there...

Now for ther starters we ordered sesame fried fish..which had an equal balance of the ingredients in it though it has a bit of sourness which I guess was because of the vinegar...and also a bit of calcuttan bhetki smell wouldn't be acceptable those who love only sea fish unlike the red pepper fish of barbq is a must have always..... Now as the main course we ordered burnt ginger fried rice with egg and chicken with a chicken side dish....the name I guess has been mentioned in pics have uploaded before...and a cosmopolitan cocktail and as a dessert we took a deep fried ice cream topped with hot chocolate sauce.... The taste was quite good of all of them and quantity was enough for the two of us... But compared with the other legendary restaurants in a place like park street the price is on a higher side...whereas one get the bests of the chinese in the restaurants like barbq,moulin rouge etc....but indeed a very good place to dine in...

Not up to the mark. This is a Chinese resturant situated in park street opposite Peter cat. The food is ordinary and nothing much to write about. The ambience was okay, but it was fully empty on a Weekend  which was surprising, and you don't feel good when the entire resturant is empty. No complains about service. The prices are on higher side.

After going through the good review i decide to go there on my bday with my friend,but was really disappointed..
we ordered for chilli chicken for starter,portion was very less compare to price. Next we ordered for burnt garlic chicken and prawn chowmein and burnt garlic chicken and egg chowmein . Chowmein was for parcel and this where i was disappointed. It was a normal veg chowmein with two three piece of chicken in both the plate ,there was no prawn and bit of egg was there.
Never expected this will happen.
May be it was for parcel thats y they have done this. Whatever may be the reason i am very disappointed.

Had gone there before on my bday but todays food inclined me to write a review. I went to the restraunt to find the staff amazingly courteous. I went for the buffet and trust me it was worth the money i paid. Starting from the soup which was hot n sour and i being a fan of it was literally waiting but i was disappointed as it was okay but needs a lot of improvement. Starters were amazing from american corn pepper salt which was cooked to perfection, to spring roll which was the exact amount of crispness, to cauliflower manucharian (cant remember the exact name) which was just a delight in the mouth to thai corn cake which was on the okayish side compared to others. Coming to drinks we ordered one virgin mojito which was just perfect and fresh lime soda sweet and salt which was again amazing. The main course - hakka chow was bland the rice  (some chilli dont remember the name) was nice with the right amount of chilli. The veggies i tried were panner mix which was not that good as it was hard and felt like rubber but the vegetables coin with the gravy were perfect. The dessert i tried was hot pudding with ice cream which was just a perfect ending to the amazing lunch. Overall a very nice experince. Must say the staff is damn courteous and it was a perfect new year lunch as its supposed to be. 
Must visit as its worth the money you pay.

Chilli wok is located just opposite peter cat in park street.The first look of this place told me that is simple yet elegant.After going the through the buffet spread I decided to go for it as there were quite a few optns with drinks included .The appetisers were simply amazing.I had a fried cauliflower dish (cnt remember the exact name) whose flavours were just so lip smacking that it became my favorite veg snack in chinese ! The spring rolls were aptly crispy and flavoursome..The chicken wings had soft meat and were nice except that I dont like bones in chinese.They also served us american corn pepper salt which had the crispy tangy tingling flavour I like.Rest we had Thai corn cake which was a bit bland fr me..Next i had hot n sour soup which had way too much chilly (the kind that hits your throat),not desirable.After this we had the main course where- the hakka noodles lacked any flavour,chilli butter rice were ok but i wud like a more delicate flavour,paneer chilli where paneer was kind of tough,the sweet n sour chicken and lamb tofu dish were good and the veg manchurian had the right blend of spices..In the desserts we had the chocolate pudding which was awesum and there was vanilla icecream to go with it.The service is very very good ! Staff is very courteous and attentive .Overall a nice experience.

On the last day of 2014 i planned to try out this place for lunch. Me and my best friend reached at 2 pm and we easily located this place as it was just beside park street KFC. Chilli wok is on the second floor of The Myx. The place was not at all crowded and we easily settled down in one of their tables. The place is not brightly lit, has a nice ambiance, soothing music and the place had Chinese inscriptions on the walls and chairs. The glasses were real cute and the dishes we ordered were wok tossed crispy lemon honey chicken (rs 445), Yuxiang shredded chicken in garlic sauce (rs. 445), pineapple rice (rs. 275) and cold drink. They took some time to serve the starter but we could see that the items were piping hot and freshly prepared which i liked but the lemon honey chicken dish was very spicy for both of our palates and we literally had waters in our eyes and personally i would have enjoyed it if there was more lemon flavour in it. The rice and the side dish were absolutely delightful. I loved the rice and it had ample amount of pineapple, chicken, egg, pork etc and the side dish was an absolute match for the rice as both the tastes blended perfectly. One plus point is their quantity because it was very difficult for both of us to finish the items and finally we had to pack as we did not want to waste food. The overall amount that we paid was around rs. 1500 (yes the price is on the higher side) but i hope they go on maintaining their quality and the quantity  of food.

I was eager to try out this new-born baby at Park Street and the crowd at Peter Cat gave me the chance on a Sunday Evening! It was a old friends' meet and we wanted to sit, relax and chat with food.. Chilli Wok played a great host to us!

The urban and classy decor with those chinese alphabets all over.. worked pretty well with the red and black interior.. Would have been happy to miss the 'vibes' though! Vibes from the adjoint disc.. which literally shook the floors.. made the ambience kind of noisy.. thumbs down for that!

Lemon Coriander and Hot-n-Sour soup, both chicken were our orders as starter.. alongwith Yue Yang Spicy Barbecued fish.. The food was served quite fast, by 10minutes max.. Both the soups were thick, flavouful and full of chicken pieces.. Later came the Fish.. It was mind-blowing, to say the least! Soft fish chunks.. crisp coating.. wrapped with sweet n spicy barbecued sauce.. heaven to our taste buds! To add more into it, all the items were well presented with good portion sizes on lovely shaped crockeries!

For the mains, we went for Burnt Garlic chicken Fried Rice, Chicken chinese chopsuey and Konjee Lamb.. Both of the mains were supposed to be shared by two of us, and we were shocked to see the portions of the chopsuey plate and thought if just a single plate would have done for four of us! There were whole lots of fried noodles.. good amount of chicken strips.. and generous amount of vegetables! Brocolli, chinese cabbage, carrot and what not.. It was extremely tasty but light to stomach.. Same goes for the rice.. predominant but mild flavours of garlic with generous portions of chicken.. and the lamb went really well with both of them! We felt the lamb was too crisp and overdone.. but tasted great and hence did not feel like complaining!

We were too full for any dessert and I am already planning my next visit just for the dessert! The pocket pinch for all the above was 2162/-, not really high considering either the quantity or quality of the food served! Overall a lovely experience! Highly recommended!

Exactly opposite to Golden Spoon, diagonally opposite to Peter Cat is the new Myx building. And on the second floor (if I am not wrong) is Chilli Wok. The moment you step out of the elevator you can see a dim lit area, beautifully decorated with soft instrumental music on the background. When I paid a visit it was empty since I guess not many know of this place. The ambience i great and the music sets the mood. 
We ordered Yue Yang Spicy Barbequed Fish, Burnt Garlic rice, Yuexiang Chicken in Garlic Sauce. We also ordered a Shirley Temple mocktail. First the Fish was served to us as a starter and was tender with the right spices. The Shirley Temple was very nice, however towards the end it lost the sweetness of the syrup. The Rice had the right amount of Garlic and the smell wasn't overpowering to spoil the side order which I liked. The Chicken could have a little more flavour and I found it a little bland. However the quality of Chicken was good. 
One thing I loved about Chilli Wok was the quantity of it's dishes offered. One bowl of rice and chicken was more than siffucient for two big eaters. In most places the starters are usually less in quantity, which wasn't the case for Chilli Wok which gave sufficient quantity of the Fish. 
Another thing worth mentioning is their service. They were warm and very efficient. While serving the Yue Yang fish, a little dripped and we barely noticed. It was immediately cleaned with a separate napkin by the respective individual. I was very impressed with the service. 
Pocket pinch was around 2000 for two excluding desserts. We were too full to order dessert. Plan to visit again. Do try :)

To begin with the interior and setting had a class the valet parking is an added advantage.
We ordered two starters. The crispy american corns were very good where as the tempura was ordinary and I found it too oily and the chilly honey dip provided was a tad too sweet according to our preference. For the main course we ordered haka noodles and fried rice which were both nicely cooked.The Manchurian was outstanding and the beat I have had till date we also ordered four treasure veg curry which was also quite nice. A placard on the table mentioned that we d b offered complimentary mocktail if we checked in the place on our Facebook but the cocktail offered was something like a cough syrup mixed with water horrible which was replaced after pointing out and the replacement were also no better. The service was top notch.

Chilli Wok - Park Street's latest offering to the foodies (like me)!! This week old resto is tucked away in the peter cat lane, in the MYX building, that boasts of a different attraction on each of its 5 storeys...3 restaurants s (chinese,indian and continental cuisine),a nightclub and a hookah lounge... chilli wok is the first of the restaurants to open.. Parking is available, which is an added advantage!

I went last weekend with my family for dinner and the new restaurant was almost full..

Decor- urban with nice detailing....the cherry blossom and chinese alphabets embedded on the wall are particularly appealing!
Menu is limited but offers a variety of select Chinese and Thai... The Tom Kha Phak was delcious....creamy coconut-y with subtle hint of lemongrass...i fell in love with it!

Appetizer- Yue Yang Spicy Barbecued Fish
Mains- Chicken fried rice, Veg Thai Pan fried rice
Sides- Exotic Vegetables with Wine Garlic Sauce, Chilli Chicken

Each of these dishes were delicious....i loved the light sauce of the exotic veggie dish and the barbecued fish...
I loved the crockery...black covered claypot type...and uniquely shaped plates..

It's by far the worst food I've eaten in Kolkata. The food was not only worst taste wise but it even led to a severe food poisoning. From the kimchi to the rice to the prawns, everything was stinking and inedible. There were only 3 tables occupied in the restaurant on Friday night and all of them were voicing their concerns. A total disaster of an experience!

Chili Wok is one of the newest oriental joints of Kolkata, I went to this place a few days back. Really nice and interesting interior they have.

The food was good (actually surpassed my expectations quite well) and the staff and service is really nice.

I'd recommend this place to anyone who's interested in Chinese food.

Very good food and good ambience. A part of the myx group, a very good initiative. Went their twice and found food to be good in both occasions. Veg sui mui, couple of chicken starters, frozen margherita, desserts etc a must try. I suppose the management is very serious about their work and there is an improvement every time you go.

Placed at the heart of the city in Myx arena, Chilly Wok has added a new dimension to the foodies of kolkata.The availability of valet parking facility is a thumbs up and a boon in the congested park street area.The interiors are very uniquely planned and commensurate to the theme. The soft music inside is soothing indeed.  We ordered for puja special buffet and ala carte both for our gang of 6. The food was a delight. Just the perfect combination of taste that we aspired for. The drumsticks we ordered was a bit low on succulence.But a definite plus was the chocolate spring roll. The staff were courteous and were pretty fast. Thumbs up and a recommendation for visit to all.

If you are ONLY looking for food (minusing the friendly neighbours) - this is THE place...extremely tasty and well prepared Thai and Chinese...the soup has an articulate Thai flavor, the Bkk chicken is a strong recommendation, the dimsums are par excellence...what takes the major credit is the lamb preparation...????????????????????????????????????

Now coming to the friendly neighbours- two three teeny weeny roaches will claw in from the wall on to your table to say Hi...so the place desperately needs a pest control treatment ????????????????

And keep a keen eye when the bill arrives...we got charged for a dish we didn't even order ????????????...upon bringing it up, then changed it though...but definitely not a good sign

The air conditioning keeps signing off and the music needs an overhaul as well ????????

The valet guys were a little lost today - I am giving them the benefit of doubt as it was Durga Puja season so far ????????????

Nicely done up,  good food and great service.

We went on the first day of Durga Puja during lunch. A pleasant surprise was valet parking. No other restaurant on Park Street offers valet parking. We chose the buffet at 799 per person and it was great. For starters there was Dry Chilly Chicken and Crispy Chilly Potatoes. There was a Thai soup in a base of coconut milk and lemongrass which was also quite amazing. The main course had lamb, prawn, chicken and fish alongwith veg thai green curry, steamed rice, fried noodles and fried rice. Salads comprised of a tofu salad, a seafood salad with prawns and squids, a chicken salad.

All the dishes were cooked to perfection. The thai green curry was delicious.

Dessert was caramel custard, darsaan, ice cream and chocoloate filled rolls.

Though it was a buffet, the waiters were very helpful in getting the soup and starters to the table and they were always with a smile.

They also served a complimentary mocktail with strawberries and yogurt which was cool and refreshing.

Definitely recommend this place. Its a breath of fresh air among the old, usual joints on park street. And the food is superb.

Looking forward to visiting again and having a la carte this time.

The Myx complex located opposite Peter Cat is an exciting new addition to the Kolkata food scene. They have recently opened their Oriental Restaurant Chilli Wok and two more restaurants serving Continental and Indian Cuisine respectively are also due to open. 
I really enjoyed my dinner at Chilli Wok .... very good service , an elegant ambiance and very good food made for a great experience.We were served a Ginger and Basil Mocktail to start with which was nice and refreshing not to mention pleasing to the eye. We ordered Peppery Lemon Soup which was a lovely broth with a lovely peppery flavour. Our starters consisted of Chicken Fried Wantons and Wok Tossed Crispy Honey Lemon Chicken ..... both were very nice but I would have prepared a nicer Dipping Sauce with the Wantons and just a tad more honey and lemon in the chicken to make it perfect.
Our meal was off to a great start and for our mains we ordered Burnt Chilli Garlic Noodles , Konjee Lamb , Moon Fan Rice , Yue Yang Spicy Barbecued Fish , Jumbo Prawn in Chilli Blackbean Sauce. The Noodles were lovely we had requested they may be made only moderately spicy and they were perfect , the Lamb was great and properly cooked , Moon Fan Rice was very very nice and the Jumbo Prawns were splendid and when paired with the Moon Fan Rice was absolutely fantastic and stole the show.. The only let down the Fish which was too crisp and overdone and they took it back immediately and offered to replace it but we were too full and almost done with our meal so we refused. They did not charge us and the Manager was nice enough to come back and enquire if he should serve a small tasting portion just to make good the matter which I though was a very nice gesture. All the food was well presented with good portion sizes on delightful crockery. Siddharth who was serving us was very attentive and patient with all my photo clicking as well :-)
Dessert was Fried Ice-cream which was nicely presented but the ice-cream was way too frozen to have much taste however we asked for extra chocolate sauce which was quickly served and poured it over the dish and this really lifted the dish.
Overall a wonderful meal and great experience. I am already planning my next visit. Recommended.

Very good food, authentic Chinese and Thai. Good quality and quantity. Amazing taste, but found it little pricy. Situated in d main food hub of the city -park street...... Good experience..... Thai food lovers much opt for Drunken Noodles to experience the real taste of Thai food.

It is one of the very few restaurants that offer authentic Chinese and Thai food, whilst most others provide the spicy Indian version. The starters are great and so is the dessert..Ambience is very serine, peaceful and calm. You get a Chinese feel as soon as you enter....I must admit that the food quality the decor the hospitality everything was just up to the mark. :)

Waiters know their job well...they were very friendly and service was prompt...and  when it comes to food, quality does matter. It hardly took 10 minutes and the food was on the table..The menu is quite spread and items i've tried are wonderful...For the starter I ordered Matchstick potato in hot garlic sauce which was delicious but oily too..chefs speical sushi which was good ..for the main course Thai Fried Rice and Seasonal vegetables with broccoli in chinese parsley sauce was amazing... The hit in the chart was their dessert hot chocolate roll..

Best dining place in Kolkata(park street) . A must visit for all the foodies :) :)

Chilli wok - Park Street's latest offering!! This week old resto is tucked away in the peter cat lane, in the same location that previously used to be "Sourav's".... the MYX building is an ambitious project that boasts of a different attraction on each of its 5 storeys...3 restos (chinese,indian and continental cuisine),a nightclub and a hookah lounge... chilli wok is the first of the restaurants to open.. 
(Btw parking available!! A definite plus)

I went last weekend with my family for dinner and the new restaurant was almost full..

Decor- urban with nice detailing....the cherry blossom and chinese alphabets embedded on the wall are particularly appealing...i dont understand though why there needs to be different types of chairs (some more comfy than the others) and what is the basis of their allocation...its unfair to the customers

Ambience- noisy and chaotic would be an apt description...despite the lack of manpower, there was utter confusion in the air ...the waiters seemed amateur and clueless, running around with dishes in their hands, trying in vain to deduce who ordered what.....they didnt seem to be familiar with the dishes at all..the manager was obviously having a hard time running things while complaints poured in from a couple of tables...
Towards the end,a loud brawl broke out between two tables with lots of finger pointing and angry exchange...(apaarently it was because someone complained about the noise)
Service was quite late...they took 45mins to serve our soup and then after a few mouthfuls,we realised they had served us a wrong soup..then anothr 15mins to serve the correct soup...

Food- the saving grace...menu is limited but offers a variety of select chinese and thai... 
the Tom Kha Phak (wrong soup) was delcious....creamy coconut-y with subtle hint of lemongrass...i fell in love with it and was relishing it when,unfortunately,we realised it was the wrong soup...it was replaced with the Tom Kha Gai soup, which i found a bit too spicy for my liking.. although tasty in its own way, it was nowhere close to the veg soup.....sigh
Next came the 
Appetizer- Yue Yang Spicy Barbecued Fish
Mains- Chicken fried rice, Veg Thai Pan fried rice
Sides- Exotic Vegetables with Wine Garlic Sauce, Chilli Chicken
Each of these dishes were delicious....i loved the light sauce of the exotic veggie dish and the barbecued fish... 
Dessert- Was highly anticipated but failed to live up to the expectations...
Hot chocolate roll - the pastry was too floury and not at all crisp...the chocolate filling was substantial though and the amount was huge...
Fried Icecream- i didnt like it at all to be frank...the taste of coconut was too overpowering...and it was as hard as a rock..

(P.S. I loved the crockery...black covered claypot type...and uniquely shaped plates..)


We laid down our spoons after the satisfying meal, and asked for the cheque...and then something happened again....but this time, instead of being exasperated with them,we burst out laughing...

They had given us the bill for another table - the (im)perfect ending to this comedy of errors!!

P.S. I Intend to come back once more when they are settled,just for the food.

Guys when you are on park street, its difficult to miss this place, ( am I suggest you don't ). The other day, a fried and I decided to sample their fare and I must tell you that we were pleasantly surprised . This is the place for you if you are tired of the regular Chinese food that every third place in kolkata serves . 

I liked the vibe of the place from the minute I entered it and i knew that the meal would be delicious . The place has a Cherry Blossom motif that follows you and you will fall in love with the detailing of the place. There are three seating options available, Straight back chairs, upholstered chairs and leather couches . I simply adored the Chinese alphabet upholstery. ...

We got a warm welcome with a Ginger and basil welcome drink and vegetable steamed buns, both of wish were really smooth and perfect way to whet the appetite . The ambient aroma was also really nice, the wok flavors in the air were making me hungry. 

We were quick in ordering the Veg Sushi , Must say the quality of the wasabi was great , i am so glad they did not use the tube wasabi . The soy was also really smooth and complimented the sushi well .

 Next in line was the  Pickled Ginger Salad : that too was a taste bud teaser and left us asking for more. The crunch was perfectly balanced by the sharp ginger and the nutty flavors . Superb !

I ordered a Mocktail called CHILI PINK PEPPER and it was red in a cranberry base and tasted really good . my friend told me that her margarita was lovely too . 

Coming to the appetizers, we ordered a Honey Lemon Chicken ... the sauce of which was stellar . A little crunch on the chicken with have made this dis pure perfection. Then came the Barbecued Fish : This dish stole me . Thank heavens that they don't use the bland basa and the fish was beautifully textured. The portions of both the chicken and fish were huge . 

We then proceeded towards the mains and it was quite like a wonderful spread . The Star of the evening for me was the Jumbo Prawn ( believe me it was HUGE ... ) in the chili black bean sauce . The sauce was delicate and the meat was cooked to perfection . The black bean did not over power the sweetness of the meat and the after-notes of sichuan pepper were phenomenal . I'm not very high on shell-fish and i took several helpings .

 Next in line was the minced chicken in hot basil. Yes they know how it is to be served and it came with a fried egg on top, the chicken was cooked well and really had a soft basil flavor. Most places do not make this dry but this is exactly how it is served in Thailand. A little fish sauce perhaps but other wise beautiful. 

We made a little bit of a request and asked if they could do the Massaman Curry with lab for us and they obliged. WHOA ! the outcome was mind blowing . Fell it love with it . 

We ordered the Pad Thai and Sausage Fried Rice . The Pad Thai was tad bit on the sweet side , just the way i love it and the peanuts made it perfect . The sausage rice was smoky and delicious . I loved the entire range of crockery they served the meals in . The beautiful woven straw mats . The zodiac themed chops sticks, and the lovely black earthen-ware  pots with lids .

 Seeing fried ice cream on the menu made me swoon and I loved the coconut crust on the fried ice cream . We also were recommended the chocolate spring rolls which were delicious too . But the fried ice cream stole the show , garnished with a caramel shard it just looked perfect . 

The Chef was warm and came and took feed back , the staff was very friendly and made us comfortable . Service was efficient and prompt and I would recommend this place to everyone.

 Kudos !!!

First off - lovely decor. I loved the way the place was set up. Ordered a margarita with some starters. They served a complementary mantou (chinese buns) which had lovely ginger notes in it that accompanied a ginger-laden drink which had flowers garnishing it. The barbecued fish in the starters was excellent, while the crispy chilly lemon chicken had a fabulous sauce, but wasn't really crisp. The ginger salad, with crushed peanuts and an assortment of crisp vegetables was refreshing. 

I loved the massaman curry (Which we specially requested to be made with lamb instead of chicken) with its rich, coconutty taste with some steamed rice. The Thai basil chicken was dry and done to perfection, and it went really well with the sausage fried rice. The fried rice itself was well-made, however, processed chicken sausages were superfluous, I thought. They served an incredible Lobster in chilli bean paste, which had soft lobster meat cooked in a chilli bean sauce which did not overpower the delicate flavors of the crustacean. 

For dessert there were fried ice cream, which I found slightly overpowered with desiccated coconut but my friend loved it (oh well! opinions differ), and a chocolate spring roll which was filled with brownies and deep fried and chocolate sauce poured on it. Definitely a place I am coming back to, especially for the well-mixed margarita.

If you guys are listing in zomato then i don't see the point in hiding your rates/ prices with CORRECTION PEN. Mr. Genius manager of Chilli wok do you think this will save you for potential customers staying away due to the high prices. In this age of information we need to know everything so please don't hide. If we can manage to tolerate MAINLAND CHINA and its pricing for the food it serves, you gonna do good too.

Complements on opening this new place.
 Hope it doesn't have the same fate of its predecessor ;-) 

Like the RAYBAN ad says " NEVER HIDE "

'First Day First Show'. With a delicious Chinese Bun & the perfect Ginger Mocktail welcome, this Oriental den promises to titillate gastronomic desires. The moment I stepped in there was a fresh whiff of a place done up with a lot of care. Lovely ambiance with Chinese inscriptions carved out on the walls that were lit up with subtle lights. I ordered a portion of Chicken Teriyaki Sushi that were rolled out neatly and was well- presented on the table with my glass of beer. The seaweed was fresh, the sticky rice was moist and the Wasabi was perfectly clayey along with the refreshing pickled ginger. The Teriyaki chicken was not overdone and the goodness of Japanese food was maintained. Being alone, I was almost half full with the 6 sushis and beer. For main course I wished for a Pad-Thai noodles that turned out to be so tasty! Bell-peppers, lemon grass, peanuts, basil chicken, flat noodles all cooked to the optimum level took me down from Japan to the ever-exciting Thailand :) The service, behaviour and presentation of the staff was exemplary. I even got an opportunity to meet the Chef who took his time to pay attention to my feedback. 'Chilli Wok' is certainly the newest high in Calcutta's food-scape.
