Located at the Dobson road near to the busiest Howrah Ac Market. Serves only pure veg and it contains good variety of food stuff starting from south indian to north indian and sweets as well.
Was a little hungry so tried their Idli for a quick taste. It was average in size and shape. The ambiance is small but still have 2 table for ur dine in. The owner was harsh while talking.

Ordered the food and took it home.. The taste was reasonable without excelling at anything... Need to improve overall.... Sweets are reasonable...

Very old place located at the heart of north howrah. They serve good snacks, sweets and south indian food. Service on the slower side but that is understandable given how crowdy this place is.

Good South Indian cuisine available in a Marwari outlet. Friendly staff. The place is small with only 3 tables available but is good for a quick bite.
