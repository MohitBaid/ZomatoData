Pretty good one situated at the heart of Esplanade !! This is a bar cum restaurant. Visited this place yesterday and it didn't disappoint us. Only the prices are a little high.

We ordered two sweet corn soups which were very well prepared and had a thick consistency. Next we ordered for a plate of dry chilli fish to accompany with our drinks , After that we had a special chicken Biryani which I found to be same as other places. Nothing Special.

Overall a good experience.

Awesome food quality!! Chicken Drumstics are the best in the world 😀 Fish rehsmi gravy is less spicy n lovely, Tandoori is ok, location is good near the new market area.

This small bar cum restaurant may look very cheap from the location & prices. You may think or hesitate to visit this place at first. But from inside it is absolutely not what you're thinking about.

Location : This place may become little hard to find because of the crowd & hawkers on that road. But to be simple its just behind the metro gate beside the lane known as Metro Gali.

Ambiance : Just after entering into this bar you may get a surprise by seeing its tidy clean ambience. The place is bit cozy & sittings are set to fit as many people as possible. The big bar counter is straight at front showcasing the drinks available. Sittings are comfortable, Red & blue led lights makes this place a true bar.

Staffs & Management : Unlike other cheap bars their waiters behaves really well & attend their customers. Management gets a big thumbs up for keeping the place really clean & also for having some good professional staffs.

Foods & Drinks : I'm a beer person so I was looking for some beer options. Don't expect much premium drinks over here like Corona or Hoegaarden, rather you can get the common once very easily. We ordered 2 bottles of Budweiser Strong & 1 Carlsberg Strong. Drinks were served chill in a mug. We also ordered dried Chana Masala & Crispy Chicken with it. Surprisingly the quality of food was way better than what I expected from this place. Dried Chana Masala was well cooked & less spicy. Where Crispy chicken was bit dry & very spicy. Garnishing of the foods were impressive. Serving the foods took a while but it was enough satisfactory in terms of quality & quantity.

Pricing : Good point is prices of the drinks on the menu card is final & that is what comes on bill. Bad thing is like every other bar, food prices are little higher for its quantity & that also comes with 18% GST. Whatsoever it was Rs.1025 in total.

Conclusion : You may or may not like to take your girl for a quick drink here, she might or might not feel comfortable by not seeing any girls inside, but you can surely hangout with your group of friends without hurting pocket that much.

This place has got a nice ambience ,good service, staffs are pretty good. The quality of the food is also good. Pocket friendly. But the first floor sitting place might pose a problem for claustrophobic people as it is a compact closed space. But it does offer a nice private space to party with friends or some quality time with your loved ones. The Tandoori roti, Paneer Butter Masala and Vanilla with hot Choco ice cream are a must try :)

A decent Bar cum restaurant with a nice ambience. Staffs and food serving is moderate, they usually take time to serve. Personally, I found the quantity and quality of food not upto the mark with the prices. Overall, an average experience here.

The entrance is crowed with hawkers so it is difficult to spot it for first timers.....Staffs were courteous......

Excellent food. Visiting Kolkata for 3 days and tried this restaurant on my first day. Went back each day. Tried their chicken makhani butter masala and chicken reshmi butter masala and they were both amazing. Especially the chicken reshmi, amazing.

Fast and curtious service with great prices. Now to find an equivalent place in Delhi.

Food items are too bad.. you can have the same standard in roadside shops too.. space is quite short.. i don't try their bar items. But my friends does... they told me it was good.. both in price and quality.. so i guess you can try their bar menu. But I am pretty unsatisfied with their food....

Today after finishing some work at esplanade decided to try one of the old restaurants of dharmatala area, I had Anarkali in my mind but looking at its deserted and dirty look changed my mind and entered Ashoka. Though it is mainly a bar and all the people who were present in the ground floor then were drinking but we entered it to have proper food and we were not disappointed. the staffs were well behaved and service was relatively quick, everything was served within 15 mins. ordered masala kulchas, chicken reshmi butter masala, chana masala and alu dum, all very basic items , nothing fancy. I was very surprised to get food of such high quality at a bar, all the items were just excellent. Pocket pinch was very reasonable, cost for 3 was rs-950.Had a surprisingly good experience here and planning to visit it again sometimes to try their chinese items.

Visited this bar more than once.. Price is reasonable.. Food, sply Tandoor items are good n value for money.. One thing i dont like about this bar is, their staff members, they should know how to recommend something to a customer or how to sell best food or drinks to their customer.. They need proper training n grooming..

Ashoka Bar & Restaurant is a very reasonably priced bar for people on budget wanting to enjoy. The ambience isn't that refined however, one wouldn't care to notice as the reason most would prefer this joint is for cheap drinks and dine out. It's a fair option for an adda session. Their Chinese preparions used to be delicious but now has come down to average standards and so has their Indian preparations but it's still decent here.

Visited this place once with my office colleagues as it is there fav destination. Decent place to grab a few drinks. Well, the decor is not too impressive very average, seating arrangements so-so. The ambiance of the place is okayish, crowds- mainly the office goers of that area. We entered the place between 5-5.30, the place was half full by then. Waiters are courteous and very prompt in service.
We had few pegs of whisky and in food we ordered for chicken tikka kebab, chicken hariyali kebab and tandoori chicken. Chicken tikka kebab was okay, Chicken hariyali kebab was good, flavourfull and Tandoori chicken not that bad either.
They serve both food and drink at an affordable price. Who knows, I may visit this place again!!!

Decent place to grab a drink after office with a friend. 
Decent enough to bring a female companion.
I have fond memories of Ashoka bar. Went there for the first time in 2002, after watching the movie Asoka at the nearby Metro cinema. For college goers like us, it was easy on the pocket at that time, but there was the fear of being spotted by an acquaintance! Since then, have been there many times. The food is good but a little expensive. 
What attracts me to the place is the crowd. You will not find the rowdy youngster crowd drinking to get sloshed. The ambience is very peaceful and offers ample scope to sit with a drink and reflect.
