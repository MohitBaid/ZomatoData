This is a new food joint very close to the Bansdroni P.S. and they serve some good food too.
Home delivery option is there as well.
My favourites is their Hakka chicken noodles that comes in abundance. Quality is good too.
I like their chilli baby corn the most ðŸ‘Œ
Mushroom preparation could have been better though bpth quality and quantity wise.
Chilli paneer was okayish.
Keep up the good work!!
