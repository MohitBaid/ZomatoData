Kolkata is coming up with such good ventures recently which will serve your midnight cravings too.
Jack & Chill is one of them.
Tried its chinese food, the quality of which needs to be worked upon and cheese balls was the recommended dish of the person taking the order which was not good AT ALL.
Delivery took 1.5 hours and delivery person was someone who couldn't understand the way.
But its a pocket friendly outlet. Just expecting to work on the quality of its food !

The worst food ever! The delivery was two hours late and the food was something even worse than what roadside hawkers would sell! It was a complete waste of money!it was the worst food I ever had!

This has to be the worst food experience ever! The food was delivered to us after 1.5 hours. The Dal and raita were stale and were stinking. And the rotis were horrible as well!

The best thing to have happened to my locality (metropolitan). 
Since the metropolitan outlet isn't registered here yet, I'm going to praise you guys here.
I had ordered two pastas with white sauce and it was simply lip smacking.
I literally felt I've just been served with some homemade food.
I've been craving for such good and simple food nearby.
Thank you soo soo much.
You guys are awesomesauce !!! :-* :-*

Just got the order. Very much dissatisfied with the order.ordered for 2 noodles got 2 half plates .got order in 2 hours .the quantity of the food was very poor and the taste of the food is utter bad. I will not recommend it to any one hoping for good food at night when you don't get alternatives to order due to time constraint later on.

Hungry at 1am? Bored of Maggi? Go for this and give a close look on their menu...The rates along with the available food options will blow your mind off... Home delivery with mouthwatering taste at such odd hour is what they are offering....  All you need to do is "place an order"and everything else would be taken care of.... I simply loved the way they customised my food and I felt the dish was particularly made for me... Hats off to the new bee in the city... Loved it :)
