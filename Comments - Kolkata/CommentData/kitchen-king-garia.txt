I would have given a minus. They serve rotten food that's all I have to say. The biriyani is minimum 2days older and the egg comes with the biriyani is rotten. Mutton pieces are also smelling bad. Worst experience. This resturent should be banned. I might have to go and see a doctor.

Ordered biryani from this restaurant .The quantity was OK. The taste was not up to the mark and the potato was also not properly cooked.
Quality can be improved.

We ordered 3 chicken biriyani via zomato. The delivery guy called numerous times to reach at our address, coz he has no clue where to deliver nor he had the detailed address with him! Apart from that the biryani was low cost & with adequate amount. But 2 of us got stomach ache the next day, we're not sure if it was caused by the biryani we had consumed :/

Poor delivery services. The guy calls numerous times and does not understand anything. He delivers late and the food is in such a poor condition with oils dripping that you wud like to throw it away.. waste of money. Never order online. I had food in this place once and thought it wud be good but they are not right for online deliveries. Sorry!

wrong review guys... had lots of problems lately and  apparently they don't listen to specific instructions... do give specific instructions and check when you get the delivery..

Had Moglai here and it was very good. I had ordered tandoori too and it could have been better but was good. Wish to visit it again for snacking.
