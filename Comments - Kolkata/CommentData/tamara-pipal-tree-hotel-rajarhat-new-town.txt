Well I have to admit I was quite impressed with the overall experience in Tamara. Starting with the warmth with which the ladies greet and treat you.. who were allocating the seats...the ambience...the look and feel....and last but not the least..The Food..One of the best pocket friendly buffet in town it is surely...every dish was really good specially being a multi cuisine buffet menu..you don't feel monotonous with it...and the quality is perfect. Hope to visit soon.

Rating only for its service which deserves a 5 star.  But food was really disappointing. North indian main course which they said to be its speciality turned out to be the worse (not even cooked properly that i could even get sugar crystals while eating). However roti & starter were good though not great! Probably best part of the dinner was the complementary wafers & chocolate pan served. Ambience was okayish. Also for vegetarian very little options on the menu as compared to non veg.

Another great buffet experience. When it comes about buffet lnch in such typ 3star/5 star restro u hv to mentn only the dishes u hv liked the most. Here i mention about the pork item and sarisha fish which were realy good in taste. Varities of starters includng fish, prawn, pannr, chikn were provided. Mutton biryani was good bt i personly think the biryani masla was excess in amount. Nd all the starters though  very veey good in taste were very oily. I want to give 5🌟 for the desert section. The backed pantua with rasogolla was just just amazng.overall fully satisfied and thnx to nearbuy.

To celebrate New Year 2018, visited this place for lunch. To get assured seats, I booked a table through Zomato, the day before. To get to the location you have to cross Eco park New town, City Centre 2, then after a while you can see the Pipal Tree Hotel on the left. Tamara is located on the 1st floor of this hotel.

 With its classy look and very courteous service men and women , this place is a gem. There was buffet spread for the occasion but we chose to have ala carte and so we were seated on a window-side table in Tamara. 
When asked about best items, the staff were well-informed and gave us excellent recommendations. They gave a small basket of complimentary home-made chips with aam (mango) chutney. 

 For starters, we had sweet corn chicken soup (one bowl -enough for two), Lemongrass chicken wings( a Thai speciality) from the Oriental section and Murg Tangri Gulmohar from the Tandoor section. The soup was light and good. The chicken wings were spicy and nice. But the best one was the Tangri Gulmohar. It is a sizzler with quite large chicken legs stuffed with minced meat. It was absolutely delicious.

 For the main course, we took steam rice and Bhekti a la Diana, which was their speciality dish because the restaurant excels in continental dishes according to them.
The quantity was huge and the bhekti was baked with small prawns stuffed inside it. SO if you have allergy in prawn, make sure to inform them beforehand. It was cooked in mushroom sauce and served with pineapple rice and sauteed vegetables and salad. Priced at Rs 560 , it was a gem of a dish. 

 We also took Lime sodas and skipped the dessert cause we were already full. With the bill, they gave complimentary chocolate pan which was the show-stopper, no doubt ! You can all check out the photos I have enclosed below for a better look. 

Service- 5/5 (I wish I could give more marks)
Location- 4.5/5
Ambience - 4.5/5
Food- 5/5 
Cost- 5/5

Will love to visit again, soon.

East or West,this place is the best!

I certainly know why I gave my 100% rating to Tamara.Let me tell you-
>The ambiance of the place is great with the Buddhist theme along with a candle light decor.
>The politeness and the promptness of the staff  and the cleanness of the place adds an edge to the standard level of Tamara
>Now the quality part: My mouth watered when I spotted the tasty prawn ...umm...Its like feeling the entire world closing my eyes in the green meadows...
Love being there and cherishing those wonderful moment.

One thing I would like to say: Do not wait for review just "Be there"

Fancy place with great interiors located at rajarghat new town. I must say the place looks absolutely royal. Ambience wise it gets full marks. But unfortunately the service that day was not upto the mark. My cousins brought me here to try out their food, as being a foodie I really wanted to try out the best places in Kolkata. Since I had come just for few days, their suggestion was accepted, I could not do much research on it.

The place is famous for continental food, but they have superising vast menu comprising of almost major cusines. Quality of the food was good, but taste wise it did nothing to my taste buds. We ordered Tamara's kebabs and appetizers platter for starters, then dab chingri, slowly braised lamb chops, murg tikka lababdar, bharwan murgh tangri gulmohar.

Lamb chops were good but they could have been better. The platter was good, and also the murg tikka lababdar was delicious. But rest all dishes were very average. I must say eating here is an expensive affair. So I felt taste wise it does not match up with the cost.

Conclusion:
Can be visited for the ambience and if you're willing to be a spendthrift for a day, you may definitely enjoy.

Plain mersmerized. Marvelous. Fabulous. Amazing. Awesome. The best dining experience ever. Period. The food was mouth melting.....with delicacies of chicken, fish, prawn, pork, paneer along with all sorts of bread, biriyani with assortment of dessert (moussie, brownie, scoops, curd etc. ). Tamara's service is unparalleled at least in Kolkata. The charismatic ambience with continuous supply of 'golgappa' and appetizing drink made for the day. Just can't find words enough to describe the moment. All foodies of Kolkata make this a priority in your day #1.

Opted for the lunch buffet on a Saturday afternoon, and the spread was really awesome. This is the only place where I have seen "phuchkas" served as starters and believe me, we gobbled them like anything. The main course was also good, the "Chicken Biryani was absolutely delicious. I would highly recommend their dessert spread which had a large variety starting from Mishti Doi, Phirni, pastries to different variety of ice creams. Being our anniversary, the courteous and polite staff also arranged for a special anniversary pastry for us. Overall, a great experience.

5. Plenty of salads items are available that was very good.
6. Starters are nice specially prawn fries and chicken kabab.
7. Main course should be more better. The Ghost Biriyani are full of flavours, that was not so cool. You can’t experiment with biriyani please.

Another starter was Italian fish picata which was kind of a fish fry. It was not that good. In main course ordered chicken Stroganoff. It was very dry. Very less chicken. The noodles was good. Mocktail was good. Overall not happy with the food. Seems to be bit overpriced compared to the quality. The stuff were good friendly

The best part was they served us on stone plate and glass..I dun know it is 3 star or 5 star hotel, their staffs are a bit classy..

We had some drinks..prices of drinks was reasonable..we had chefs special kabab platter which  can easily served to 4 people .it was nice combination with the drinks and we had a American dish ..

Overall Tamara is classy restaurant ...they deserve 5/5

Window seat is what i prefer... pan fried chilli fish to go with norwegian salmon....though its a multicuisine still bengali people love ordering indian dishes over continental food, which d restaurant claimed to b specialized with. So jst boost up d indian food section as the tastes are not truly great bt ok type... hospitality is good and if u order some out of d box item, make sure u hv ample amount of time in ur pocket, as d food might take atleast 45 mins to reach ur table.

I visited this place today ... To be very honest I'm a buffet lover, and here the buffet was really amazing. 
The fact which was most praisable wright up here was their way of welcoming us. They welcomed us with welcome drinks, refreshing towels and the behaviour of the staffs were too adorable. It was my girls bday they arranged a decorated plate with a pastry and candle even...The spread the desert section was my favourite, having orange moose, hot brownie , the authentic Misti doi,ice creams and many others. The soups and starters were really awesome...the biriyani was too tasty with those fish, chicken and pork items. Loved having lunch there sitting in that window side table.
Will surely recommend people for going in this place ❤

Had gone for dinner last night and here is my opinion about the restaurant:-
The ambience there is wat it should be..you get the proper candle lit dinner you have always wanted...it's calm and peaceful and gives you your own space...comming to the food...it wasn't wat I expected it to be...they almost made a spicy dish "sweet".. and the food was taking a bit too much time..considering we ordered simple ...a lag in the service..also a major major disaster was...a 'fly'..imagine you r enjoying your meal and suddenly the fly does all its tingling thing...that will be a disgust right....dats wat happened... Though they compensated us with moktail (bliss) ordered 1 came 4 and they didn't charge for it... honestly this signature mocktail won my heart...and I definitely suggest all the sweet tooths to give it a shot...and the last bt not list a complimentary chocolate pan...trust I was never a fan of pan...be it watsoever bt the chocolate pan was out of this world...

The Tamara buffet menu was overdue for a long period..and after savouring the delicacies I must say that it lives up to to its rating..The starters were divided into groups of 3 featuring both veg and non veg..The veg and non veg was a treat..the badami murg could have been better..may be making the chicken more soft and sticking to boneless pieces can do a lot of good..
The main course contained a good spread of pork ..fish..kadai chicken..and mutton biriyani(special mention)

The best part of the Tamara buffet is the ending..It contains a wide array of dessert options ranging from orange mousse..mishti doi..gulab jamun..black forest..fruit cakes..ice creams..chocolate tarts..chocolate brownies..The dessert section has to be one of the best in the city at present..

As all's well that ends well.. Tamara.. according to me..truly is a formidable player when it comes to best buffet places in the city....

Happy buffet..!!!!

Tamara has a very classy look with friendly staff. The decor is very impressive so is the ambience.
They have a huge spread of salads, chats and breads. One is sure to get confused ! The main course was satisfactory. The desserts were yummy. One will definately like this place and food. Still there is a chance for improvement.

Nice buffet spread in pocket friendly budget. Though the variety is good, the main attraction was the chat and salad spread. Mutton Biriyani was nice, with strikingly soft mutton. Chicken and Fish starters we're good but prawns were over fried. Main course have noodles, veg jhalfrezi, paneer butter masala, pork, grilled fish etc. Deserts have pastries, shahi tukra, brownies, ice cream with lots of toppings.

To start with, Tamara has got a supremely classy look. The decor, background music and one-sided glass wall together made the place a top-notch. The other category is hospitality, for which this restaurant deserves extra points. To add another layer in our satisfaction levels, we were treated with "desi nachos with mango salsa" as a welcome dish. We started or dinner with "veg starter platter" consisting of hara bhara kebab, dahi ke kabab, paneer kebab and aloo ke kebab. All the kebabs were full of flavors, succulent and made to perfection. For main course, we opted for Hyderabadi nargisi kofta, served with tawa paratha and salad. The lamb koftas were stuffed with boiled egg and simmered in a keema-based gravy. Again the taste was perfect. However, they cut the koftas into pieces before serving; as a result the stuffed boiled egg came out as an add-on.  We would prefer to discover the stuffing of boiled egg by ourselves. The parathas were well made. Interestingly, before serving the main course, they provided a complementary palate cleanser; a lovely concoction of watermelon cubes with rock salt and mint. To end our meal on a sweet note, we selected "ecuadorian liquid chocolate with peanut butter cookie crumbles and vanilla-bean ice cream". We loved the dessert; however, it was like freshly baked chocolate cake served with vanilla ice-cream. Going by the name of the dessert, we expected more of a innovative delicacy. We were slightly disappointed; nevertheless, the dessert tasted well. At the end, were were again served a complementary item "chocolate paan" for which we fell in love. Together, we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner time at Tamara.

Tamara is quite distinct in terms of variation in Continentals and quality compared to it’s peer ones. In our last two visits tried.

Afghani Mahi Tikka
Pan Fried Hakka Chilli Fish Dry
BBQ Pork Chops
Mixed Pad Thai Noodles

Liked Pork Chops with BBQ Sauce the most. Best part of this RESTRO, they serve appetisers really hot  but light and tasty. Pad Thai was authentic. Staffs friendly and decent.

It was my birthday lunch today which we had @ Tamara. I had been here almost 4 years back. They have maintained that same ambience I must admit. Today we opted for Buffet here first time. There were fish, chicken, Mutton, pork, prawn and many more nice vegetable dishes also. I loved the golden fried prawn most and in main course I liked the Mutton biriyani.

Nice buffet spread in pocket friendly budget. Though the variety is good, the main attraction was the chat and salad spread. Mutton Biriyani was nice, with strikingly soft mutton. Chicken and Fish starters we're good but prawns were over fried. Main course have noodles, veg jhalfrezi, paneer butter masala, pork, grilled fish etc. Deserts have pastries, shahi tukra, brownies, ice cream with lots of toppings. Over all a good-to-go-again experience.

Visited the restaurant for Dashami Lunch.They arranged the menu in their banquet
 "Dhani".The decor,the music, the waiters and waitresses clad in traditional Bengali dresses ....all were carrying the festive vibe.The welcome drink Aam porar Sharbot quenched our thirst as we were looking over the huge spread including Chinese, continental,North Indian as well as a lot of special delicacies from Bengal like luchi -cholar daal,Pabda r Jhal and kasha Mangsho  with pilau rice.In the dessert section the age old delicacies like Malpua with rabri and patisapta were obviously scoring higher than the soufflé,pastries, mousse and ice creams of different flavours which play the main roles round the year.We had a gala lunch which ended with "Chocolate Paan".
Also visited the restaurant many a time before as we specially love their continental menu.The experience was awesome with traditional Bengali food also.Shall surely recommend for not only the restaurant menu but for the festive buffet also.

Very classy decor is what defines this place.Located at the corporate sector of Newtown kolkatta this reataurant is a mixed bag of a proper dining expirience.A good fine dining feel it gives the moment you step in ,classy silk curtains and spice jars being a part of the ambience gives it a very classy charm.The buffet was quite descent but didty do justice to 1000 plus taxes expected a bit more ,food was great though the servers were well informed about the food and the service eas good as well.Desserts were quite good and had several options which i liked. All ober a good expirience would love to go back

Happened to visit the place on 5th April,2017.So sorry for d late review.                                 Location:Close to CC2 rajarhat & next to The Fern Residency.Tamara is located on d 1st floor of d Pipal Tree.                                                                  Ambiance:The place is beautifully decorated,one gets d shamiana feeling.Large window panes present makes ur outside view perfect.But to my disappointment on reaching d place saw an office tean lunch was going on and people present in large groups were moving here and there,which was enough to spoil my mood there on.                                          Food:To start with they offered us with jaljeera based drink which was good but could have been better.They also provided fuchka on d table which was good. As it was a buffet so there were many items,which included Soup to Dessert.Both the soup were perfect in taste.The starters were again very good.The dry chilli prawn was d showstopper The main course was good but could have been better and besides d variety was less.athough i didnt had biryani and pork so cant tell d taste of those two.Moving towards the dessert everything were again good.                                                                   Staffs:All were polite and quite attentive,inspite of having a big rush.They welcomed us cordially with a smile and till end had that smile on their face.   Conclusion: A place that scores rating of 4 and above. Definitely a place to try but not if you want to avoid the hustle and bustle!!!!!

The price and quality is really nice. I really loved the buffet. But but but. There comes a but when I ask you where is the main course option other than mutton biriyani. And talking from a healthy viewpoint and preference wise. There should have been Chicken biriyani and mutton kosha as people generally prefer it this way and many people avoid mutton or red meat. But the starters and desserts were almost perfect. Cakes could have made it better honestly.

Well this place has a very enchanting ambience with dim lights to be precise candle lights and cosy seating areas.  Kind of posh.  The crowd was good too with many foreigners savouring the Indian dishes.  
The food is excellent.  My husband and I had Italian fish picatta to start off the evening.  It was very good.  And we then decided to shift to the mughlai food.  We had Kolkata chicken biriyani with raita and chicken lababdar.  These were delicious too.  They serve nachos and pappad  as complimentary items.  :) 
But the place is too damn expensive.  And when correlating price and quantity, it is slightly negative. 
But overall it was a good experience.  
We missed out on their buffet.  They have lunch and brunch buffets which I have heard is very good.  :) 
Highly recommended for a one time visit.

This beautiful restaurant located near City Centre 2 is one of my favourites. This was my second visit. The staff were courteous and polite, and made sure we were comfortable. I opted for a la carte. We were welcomed with complimentary nachos. We ordered phad Thai chicken noodles and diced chicken Kung pao style. The food was amazing. The flat spicy noodles tasted great, so did the chicken. Loved the chocolate paan!

Looking forward to visit this place soon again!

I've visited this place few days back after a long time. Last time I had good experience and this time also the same. They gave complimentary drinks at first which was Jaljeera based drink(it was okay in taste). They also gave fuchka on table which i didn't like that much(I'm not a fuchka lover). Now coming to buffet which started with two veg starter, two non-veg starter&one tandoori chicken. In veg starter they had crispy chilli babycorn & paneer, and in non-veg crispy chilli prawn & one fish item. Everything was good in taste but i didn't like the tandoori chicken that much . Now coming to main course, they had so many options in veg & non-veg. I tried baked mayonnaise veggies, palak paneer & another item. But i really loved the baked veggies which was superb in taste. And in non-veg they had koi maach, pork, mutton polao, murg lababdar. Every item tasted good specially the mutton polao but pork was okay in taste. I was literally full after having all these items but still wanted to try their dessert because i loved their dessert before & also this time. They had pastries&mousse, payesh, misti doi, baked pudding & ice-cream too. I really loved their pudding but i was too full to eat more so ended with their Ice-cream which was good too. And last all these item for just Rs.765/- which is cheap&worth. Will visit this place again.😊😋

Candlelight, the shamiana decoration, soft background music all add to the feel good feel.

Ordered chicken gulmohar for starters, lamb chops and chicken fajita for main course. The lamb chops were perfectly cooked, juicy and soft. Best I've had. 
Rest were delicious as well. Enough in quantity. 

Chocolate paan at the end left a very sweet feeling in the mouth at the end.
Will visit again :).

1. Totally over priced , not found any reason of too much price.
2. According to cost they served not ample amount of food.
3. Food quality according to test is ok ok type ... like other good resto, whether  the other resto serve it at low cost as well as.
4. Over hipped restaurant place.
5. They did provide ample information, we take drinks, the menu card showing the item and price
There was not define the quantity, which is miss guide you any point of time.
6. We 4 people take 2 starter, 1 chkn side dish , 1 mtn side dish , 3 masala kulcha, 2 peas polar, 3 Indian whisky (anticquite blue ) total bill amount more the 5k 
It just robbing ur money !!! Be aware ....!!!!!

Went for the bijoy special buffet so this feedback is purety for this buffet only

Not sure other bengalis who stays in kolkata and gave access to more famous bengali restaurants ,how would they react but I who stays in hyderabad and did not have so many aithentic bengali food,surely loved it

I already had heavy breakfast but that did not stop me from eating all the items
Tye starters,main course,veg curries all were perfect
Fuchka and chat counter was add on
Misti doi ,pati shapta,chocolate pan and icecream had the perfect blend of taste and sweetness

Located on the first floor of The pipal tree hotel, rajarhat,Very close to cc2. Had a lot of expectations from this place, and we weren't disappointed a bit. The staff politely escort you to tables,and dining under the shamiana is a different experience altogether. Coming to food,we opted for the lunch Buffet and there were so many items that we were spoilt for choice. Be it the phuchkas,live chat counter, the aam Panna, or the lavish main course and dessert spread, everything was par excellence. Definitely recommended.

The place is beautifully decorated. Gives a shamiana feel. We tried the Durga Pujo buffet on shasti... The staff was really nice and helpful. Coming to the food, there was Bengali fare on the menu starting from paturi and kabiraji as starters to pabda and chingri and mangsho as mains and parishapta and misti doi as desserts to name a few. There were a lot of items and I couldn't try everything. My favourite was the beet Cutlet and fish kabiraji in starters, aloo posto, chanar rossa and barishal r mangsho in main course, the ice cream prep, pineapple upside down cake and black forest pastry in desserts. Everything tasted really flavourful. Loved it. Would have liked it more if they had any chicken item in the main course. Not a big fan of mutton. And yeah the biryani was not so good. Other than that everything was really great.

Went for buffet lunch today.  There were about 2 varients of soup, 1 prawn item,  1 mixed veg, 1 panner and chicken item in starter.  For mains there were noddles,  chili pork, mutton biriyani, one fish ND chicken item,  steam rice,  breads, pNeer, Dal, for dessert there were mousse,  tarts pastries and gulab Jamun. They also had dahi vada,  ghugni and other stuffs.  I feel the buffet could have been more wide especially in case of main course. Chili pork was average in taste and also the desserts.  Dahi vadA , stuffed khulcha , biriyani,  dum also, prawns were very    good.  What I liked the best is the way they have presented the buffet items. We paid 765 for each person . I won't compare it with flame and grills or barbeque nation. It's good for one time try.

I will not shame the other reviews as everybody has their point of view! But my experience was average. Very average. Welcome drink was good but again who goes to these places for welcome drinks. Chicken starter was horrible! and with bone too! Seriously?! Prawn was savior. It was good. Very(and I really mean VERY) little choices for main course!Desert was okay. Misti doi was good. Brownie was very average. very dry!
Overall not satisfying experience at all!
Had very high expectation after seeing those good reviews.

All reviews here are scams. 

It's  good for a 3.5 rating, nothing beyond. Just decent food. I did not like the 'Samiyana' ambience. Food was over priced. However, yes the the staff was courteous. No complaints on that front.

So, this was my brother's idea, the inception of which are the countless good reviews down below (_/\_). We went there for a Buffet lunch, and my bother and I wasn't at all pleased :( !

Better aspects:
- Ambience
- Service (Ok)

Not so good pullovers:
- Food quality
- A surprisingly low choice of food items (main course and starters)

There are a ton of Positive reviews down below; so, trust your digestive instincts and take the plunge, i guess!

** Location = At Chinar Park, Rajarhat.

**Brief = I had been there to enjoy a peaceful dinner with family and had to wait for 20 minutes before getting the table and the staffs there are very much courteous.

** Ambiance = The ambiance indeed is such that it feels like you are under a shamiana and the glass window opens up to the road where you can see the cars rushing and the cute candles on the table packs a romantic punch to the place.

** Things tried = We ordered for crispy chilly baby corn, chicken drumsticks, chicken baby corn soup, chelo kebabs and bahama waves plus lime soda to quench our thirst.

The soup was enough for 2(made it 1:2), the chicken drumsticks were just perfect to appetize you.
Then there was the humongous chelo kebab, it was delicious and very much filling.
The thirst quenchers definitely served their purpose with full marks. 

If the peter cat chelo kebab is the epitome, then this chelo kebab definitely comes close to that.  definitely recommending this.

**Overall = Definitely one of the awesome places to enjoy some great food and spend quality time with family and friends. Superb!! Definitely going back for more.

When you go to a Restaurant Of Course Food is the most Important thing, but Ambience and Decor is the first thing you notice and it sets in the mood for you. So as you enter and grab your table, the whole process they make you feel like you own the place and that's amazing! then there is the music of Lord Buddha, which brings in the positivity. At this point you are so happy that you feel comfortable about their food even before ordering it. Then when you actually order it you enjoy even more as it is made with such heart and perfection( It's what I felt and so will you). I won't comment on costing and things as I believe I paid there not just for the food but for the Experience..! So go there, try it out, you won't regret...!

It was not possible to taste everything as the list was huge, but whatever we tasted was awesome and perfectly cooked.

Foodie's top picks - 

1)Bhuna Chingri Paturi -Prawn paturi has become one of the mainstay of authentic Bengali spread. When the tender prawns are cooked inside a plantain leaf with mustard, coconut paste, slender green chilies and golden yellow mustard oil, it takes you to such a height that every other food looks ordinary. It was lipsmacking.

2)Aam Kasundi Paneer Paturi - Chanar Paturi is an authentic Bengali recipe of paneer that is flavored with mustard, coconut and green chillies and steamed in pumpkin leaves. It was very flavourful and soft .

3) Keshari Tandoori Chicken - Well marinated and grilled and was soft and flavourful.

4)Chinese stir fried vegetables noodles - was light and tasty.

5)Vietnamese Wok tossed fish - again a very flavourful and tangy preparation with succulent fish pieces.

6) Dhakai Prawn Biriyani -a  Bangladeshi cuisine , it was well cooked, flavourful and lipsmacking.

7)Narkeler Patisapta - A traditional Bengali pancake recipe made during winters . But one would get this during Puja time. It was very yummy.

8)Hot white chocolate Browney - soft, fudgy , tempting and very addicting . A must try....!!

9)Chocolate Paan - A very tempting item. It was mind-blowing and refreshing. A perfect thing after you end your meal.

Price - A huge menu for just 999 INR ( inclusive all taxes ) isn't it wow !!!😘

Thanks to the management for their hospitality.

Located at Chinar park, easy to spot.
Well decorated ambiance.
Starters: Bud tickling.
Chaat options: Good is a word which is not sufficient, Plenty of choices.
Main course: Good, but poached fish in mexican style needs to be improved. Very good options for vegetarians too.
Desserts: 7 types of mindful desserts includes ice cream and hot gulab jamun.
A place to visit again.

We had Bekti a la diana and a fish tikka. Food was great. Ambience was great. Staff was courteous. We finished the dinner with a chocolate monti carlo. The chocolate pan was perhaps the best thing. Thoroughly enjoyed the dinner and surely would go again.

Visited this place for a corporate lunch event. We opted for buffet lunch. When we reached there it was very hot outside. We were welcomed with wet towel and welcome drinks. Each and every staffs were very well behaved and helpful. Restaurant is also well decorated. Coming to food. There were two types of soup, few types of salad, fuchka, doibora, boiled egg, boiled chicken etc before the main starter. In starter there were paneer, baby corn, prawn, chicken and fish items. In main course there were few veg items (not tasted anything except paneer). In non veg section, there were mutton biryani, chicken kosha, fish and pork. This restaurant also serves a great varieties of dessert. Most liked by me is misti doi. Overall very good experience, Varieties of food, nice ambience. Must recommended.

PS: It costs 649+Tax Per person

Ambiance is good. We have tried Mutton kasha withmughlai Paratha. Mutton Kasha ws really good but the Mughlai was Half in quantuty. Apart from that we have also tried Tamara's Celo combo. That congress with mutton kabbab (not good at all), chicken kabab (good), Butter Rice (not a pinch of butter flavor). All over We would keep this as the last option in any future try.

amazing view and super friendly staff and a great breakfast  just what you need for a perfect start for the day. Tried the breakfast buffet and would like to complement the team that they are in the same level of 5 star hotels. Keeping to the food diversity of the city would definitely book mark this place if you are on a transit for a quick snack.

Tamara was in my wishlist for a very long time. and finally we went there on my birthday. Ambiance is too nice. Staffs are very well behaved and take good care of the guests.
Now talk about the buffet lunch, they welcome us with jal jeera lemon kind of drink which i really liked, along with phucka and i found it very unique.several types of salads, breads, dressings are there.
Starters include a two types of soups, panner tikka, crispy prawn, tandoori chicken malai kabab, fish cake and more..
In main course plenty of options. Veg to nonveg. All dishes are very tasty. i really liked the mutton polao specially. The dessert part was awesome, they have pastries, firni, misti doi with fusion touch, pineapple mousse, hot chocolate brownie, ice cream with many flavours.
And for my birthday they arranged a small piece of cake and candle.and frankly the cake was really tasty.
All over its a very nice experience.

Tamara was in my wishlist for a longtime. Went there for dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday. Ambience is too nice. A place to have a perfect candlelight dinner date. Dimly lit with cozy sofas overlooking the view of rajarhat through the window panes..we were served with nachos with mango chutney before the food arrived. For starters we took murgh tangdi gulmohur, which lacked salt and was not appetizing at all. For main course we had chicken biriyani with raita and mutton roganjosh. Biriyani tasted bland. They will provide you with salads,watermelon salads ,roasted papad but the food is not at all tasty and price is on the higher side. The show stealer was the chocolate paan which was worth a mouthfreshner. Overall an okayish experience..

Tamara is located very near to city centre, Rajarhat. They will serve you from 12.30 noon and we went there for lunch. We opted for buffet. The place has a very nice ambience with window seats overlooking the street is a delight. 

Staffs are worth mentioning, they are very well behaved and will take very good care of the visitors. Welcome drink was served along with Phuchka. Phuchka in a buffet spread is quite unique. Several types of salad are there. Really many types!!

Starters include a soup, paneer tikka, crispy veg in chilly plum sauce, crispy garlic fish, prawn salt and pepper garlic and tandoori chicken. Prawn salt and pepper was the best of the lot.

Coming to the main course, there were plenty of options. Veg and non-veg, plenty to look forward. From the veg section I selected lemon scented rice and veg noodles, accompanied by veg manchurian. Nothing extraordinary to share from these dishes.

Grilled fish with Cilantro sauce was pretty good. However, Kolkata mutton biriyani and murgh was not up to the mark though. One of the best dishes I have had experienced in this place involve Pork Belly. Although the dish was slightly aligned to salty, still it was a delight. 

To end the feast, I took assorted pastries, Phirni, Misti doi fusion ( the best among the lot), orange mousse ( which I did not like to be honest ). Ice-cream too were an option as well as there were Hot Gulab Jamun.

The cost is around 775 per person including GST. 

To sum up, it was a very nice experience. I rate this place quite high, probably one of the best in Rajarhat. There is a huge spread in buffet, although I still feel there is a scope for slight improvement in the food section, doing which this place has a potential to be "a leader" in the city.

All you can eat buffet is becoming the latest fad in town. And many restaurants are cropping up offering it, but not all of them are worth the time and money. Because one fundamental thing most of them has forgotten is, quantity is not everything. It is the quality which will attract repeat foodies and new foodies. Tamara - by the Pipal Tree stands out distinct from this crowd of common buffet restaurants with its unique qualities.

Ambience - The fancy shamiana covered ceilings, large open windows showing the busy street of Rajarhat is charming indeed.
Staff - The staff behaviour has been extremely professional. They have been very helpful and courteous.
Food - Since I was not carrying any preconceptions, the food came out to be an actual surprise. The welcome drink of Aam Panna was a delight. Starters were as follows - Fish finger, Chicken kebab, Chilly Prawn, Mixed veg fries, Paneer kebab. The fish finger was just perfect; having 4 or 5 of these delicacies was a sinful bliss. Another noteworthy thing was the main course which consisted of Mutton Biriyani, Baked Fish, Chicken Kasha and Chilly Pork. Now, many of the buffet restaurants focus only on the starters and neglect on the main course, but the main course at Tamara was just as perfect as the starters. The best one of these was the Chilly Pork, it was one of the most succulent porks I have had in a while. But, the gastronomical journey did not end here, the desserts were still there and it brought a perfect conclusion to the experience. The make yourself Ice Cream Sunday was the best feeling, not only because of the taste, but also for the chance of showing creativity.

Overall - It was a marvelous experience, I would definitely be visiting Tamara again, if not for anything else, just for the Chilly Pork.

Buffet price is high, but it worth every penny of it.

Had a plan to visit this restro for a long time, but ultimately could make it for a buffet lunch!
Firstly the ambience of the whole place was just awesome. Now comes the quality and variety of food items, which is really appreciable. The variety of several items in the buffet menu was just perfect for the food lovers. Also the quality of the overall food was amazing. Though the overall cost of per person lunch is a bit high, still the quality of the food can be a plus food the restro to be visited.

The Italian dishes with a red wine works for me really well, but I would like to recommend that you should book tables in advance because this place is bit busy during weekends. And at last the ambience is also good.

Tamara is very close to where I stay. On a particular,my hubby and me were wanting to enjoy luxury dining and soon we checked into it for a lunch. The restro is so lavishly decorated. A step into it would suffice to make you feel extraordinarily special. The staff were more than polite and courteous to guide us to our table. We were made to sit comfortably and we were all smiles. We decided to try their buffet menu. Right from the starters to desserts, it took  my heart away. The spread is good both in terms of variety and quality. But, special mention goes to the 'chocolate paan'. I chewed it away to glory and how! I would definitely pay a visit soon and would recommend to others too.

Tamara, at The Pipal Tree in Rajarhat (close to Chinar Park) is one of the best places for buffet dining in Kolkata. Starting with soups and starters, salads, main courses to desserts, all the items were very good. At the buffet package of 649+ taxes, you get unlimited mocktail refills. Garlic fish,  garlic prawns, crispy chilly chicken, lemon garlic fish and the Indian Mutton Biriyani was very very good. 
The staffs are extremely courteous, and polite and the ambience and feel of the place is quite extravagantly soothing. Must go to place if you are a foodie.

I was there on 28th june 2017 for non-veg lunch buffet with my friends! The price was 782(A.I.). The buffet was good bt not so great! I am coming on that point one by one- 
1. STARTERS- 
first they serve some fuchkas  then gave the welcome drinka Jaljeera and they told that this is  changeable day by day, so others can expect other than this.. but i liked there drinks , the taste was great and it was unlimited as other restaurants limit to 1glass only! 
Then they serve some non veg items of chicken, fish, prawn and veg items of baby corn, paneer.. 
2. LIVE COUNTERS- 
There are some live counters of papri chats, velpuri and some veg and non veg salads..You have to make your own dishes and ingredients will be there! 
3. MAIN COURSE- 
There are several items in veg but limited in nonveg items.. there were two kinds of soup veg and non veg.. as i was there for non veg buffet so i am telling you about that! There were mutton biriyani, chicken butter masala, sarso fish and a item of pork.. Frankly speaking this is disappointing , they are charging nearly 800 rps and the non veg items are very limited so for that big 👎.. 
4. DESERT- 
The desert items are not very much in numbers.. but the qualties are great. There were misti doi with rabri, chocolate brownie, two types of pastries- chocolate and mango flavour and ice creams of 5 flavaours like vanilla, chocolate, mango, butterscotch etc. 

So I can say that the overall buffet items is good but the main course items are very very disappointing! They can make some more items like noodles, fried rice and some items of chinese side dish! 

Thank you everyone, and enjoy the buffet in future! 🤘✌

The place is beautiful. And the seatings look straight out of a king's place. Had been there for their buffet lunch quite sometime back and enjoyed thoroughly. The staff was very cooperative and friendly.

Coming to the food, though there were a few dishes which disappointed us, it was a pleasant experience. Though i would not visit it again anytime soon, but i would definitely urge you to go there with your significant other atleast once. The ambience is totally worth it.

I went there yesterday, 19/6/2017, with my partner for a lunch.And we could not have asked for a better place.Everything about the place is endearing and really good.Well, this is gonna be a long one, so if you want to read a detailed review, do read on. You have to enter through the lobby of the hotel and take the lift or stairs to the first floor, where just opposite there's a pathway leading you straight to the restaurant.The first highlight has to be the decor,the turquoise and the regal purple had my heart on the very first sight,There were two lanes of seating, one providing you a window seat and the other which has sofa's adjoined to the walls, the decor is very extravagant and pleasing to one's eyes.The seats, cozy and the little tit bits of decorations adds on the glamour.The staffs are very polite, they have a really nice dresscode, and are very polite and cordial.Now for the menu,There was a complimentary drink, Jaljeera, and was served twice and seems like was unlimited.They first started off with a prawn stir fry- it was the best starter.Then came fish garlic fried, - it was equal to that of the prawn in taste.Next was, chicken tandoori, hara-bhara kebab and golgappas - all tasted very well, the golgappas were perfectly seasoned.Next, you could choose from an array of breads and two soups, I tried the chicken manchow and 2kinds of breads and they didn't fail to impress me,.In the middle, there's a counter for papri chat, dahi vada, and pasta, and an option for you to mix one on your own.Then came the main course.There was a spinach canniollei, paneer butter masala, and two other vegetarian dishes along with white rice available.We tried the paneer, and though the paneer was really soft and supple, the curry lacked the spice that a paneer butter masala has,In the non vegetarian section, there was fish,pork belly,murgh hariyali and mutton biriyani.You can also order, naan, roti or kulcha as a side dish which is inclusive in the buffet.The mutton of the biriyani was falling right of the bones, the chicken succulent and tasty, the pork fry tasted nice as well.then the tomato chutney hidden among many others, was a gem that we had found. Since, a bengali's food dream isn't done unless you have chutney and papad.For dessert, there was, shahi tukda,which for my taste was way too sweet and I felt that the bread could have been a tad less sweeter for the sweet to actually be magic.Then there was rabree and misti doi shots a very innovative way of plating something so traditional, but no they did not forget to give you the real taste of it even though it was wrapped in a modern avatar.Next you had chocolate fudge cake and ice-cream choices of 3 flavours that you could choose from.There were also many different treats provided for you to dress up your ice-cream the way you want it to be.The bill came to 1556/- and given the number of dishes that were there, we thought it was a great deal.It was an amazing experience, and I will surely be visiting the place soon.Do visit it with your family or your partner, the place caters to both <3

The ambience is one of the best things about Tamara. If you want a peaceful environment to spend with your special one, I would highly recommend this place. 

The service is very good. Staff is polite, helpful and courteous. 

Food is good. We ordered dahi kebabs, amritsari kulcha, Dal makhani, veg handi and mithai platter.
Dal makhani is a must try. Mithai platter is worth mentioning too!

Overall, a pleasant outing. Would recommend atleast a visit!

Since, a bengali's food dream isn't done unless you have chutney and papad.For dessert, there was, shahi tukda,which for my taste was way too sweet and I felt that the bread could have been a tad less sweeter for the sweet to actually be magic.Then there was rabree and misti doi shots a very innovative way of plating something so traditional, but no they did not forget to give you the real taste of it even though it was wrapped in a modern avatar.Next you had chocolate fudge cake and ice-cream choices of 3 flavours that you could choose from.There were also many different treats provided for you to dress up your ice-cream the way you want it to be.The bill came to 1556/- and given the number of dishes that were there, we thought it was a great deal.It was an amazing experience, and I will surely be visiting the place soon.Do visit it with your family or your partner, the place caters to both <3

I have been hearing about this place for a very long time. Finally got the chance to visit the place.

The ambience is one of the best things about Tamara. If you want a peaceful environment to spend with your special one, I would highly recommend this place. 

The service is very good. Staff is polite, helpful and courteous. 

Food is good. We ordered dahi kebabs, amritsari kulcha, Dal makhani, veg handi and mithai platter.
Dal makhani is a must try. Mithai platter is worth mentioning too!

Overall, a pleasant outing. Would recommend atleast a visit!

'Ambience' is the first thing that catches your attention. For the dinner we had mixed meat sizzler with fish, chicken and sausages followed by Chicken garlic and a Chinese prawn gravy along with mixed schezwan fried rice and veg cheese garlic fried rice. Each and every item tasted good. And as the saying goes: All's well that ends well- "Chocolate Pan"!
That's the complimentary mouth fresher, but is just awesome.

Ambience- Good
Food- Good
Service- Good

*Tip- If you're from the corporate world, ask for a discount before the billing

Now what can i say about TAMARA....Simply elegant!!

This fine dine restaurant is located in kestopur, Rajarhat. Which is quite far away for South Kolkata residents like me. But this place is really really worth a visit.

Went there for a formal Corporate Party with my team. So we had our tables booked. As it was a Lunch Party so had ordered the Lunch Buffet, which was really worth the price paid for.

Food Quality : Really delicious, taste bud tingling Continental, Italian, Chinese and Indian food are served here. Though i would say, their main attraction was the Gandharaj Phucka, that was really something really simple yet fabulous. Frankly, i liked their starters only, the main course was not upto the mark and the cleansers were good too.

Serve Time : To be honest, i'm not sure about the serve time, as it was Buffet for us. But from one my very close mate, i got to know that they serve real quick.

Ambience : The ambience is richly decorated with Cabana styled ceiling and Royal seating. Neat and tidy.

Staff :Yes! Superb!! They are just too good. Well mannered and well groomed. Real polite.

Cost : Not cost effective at all. A bit on the pricy side. But, thats how it is, its a fine dine formal restaurant.

Pros : Ambience, well groomed staffs and the Starters.

Cons : The main course needs to be improved. Location is a bit odd (for south kolkata people only).

VERDICT : If you are looking for some fabulous fine dinning experience, then definitely opt fo TAMARA.

SOUMEN'S RATING:-

Food Quality : 4/5
Ambience : 4/5
Serve time : 4/5

Happy Food Hunting....!!

This is my go to place for every other good food craving. One place I can totally swear by if you want a luxury dining experience. They serve a complimentary nacho with mango chutney and later a watermelon mojito while serving main course. I totally love their Indian cuisine and the continental menu is kindoff well knit too though not better than Indian. The mocktail they serve can be better.
The ambiance brings in sanctity and the waiters are really warm. The food can be very fine tuned according to your taste buds. Though a little bit pricey for a restaurant in Kolkata, but totally worth it.
And oh, to wrap it up all they give a complimentary chocolate pan which I go head over heels for.

Went for dinner in a group after hearing a lot about this place and high ratings. First we were skeptical if the vegetarian food was good enough as recent ratings were mostly on non-vegetarian food. However, we made a right decision and hence the high ratings. As soon as we reached, we were greeted nicely and led to a table. We were then given wet napkins to refresh. The ambiance was nice and different with candle-lit tables. For starters we ordered Tandoori Aloo, Kebab Saam Savera & Sweet Corn soup. Soup was descent but the other two starters excellent. For main course we had Paneer Lababdar, Dal Makhani & Pindi Chana. In breads we had Amritsari Kulcha, Tandoori Roti & Butter Naan. Everything in the main course was excellent in taste and quality of food. They provide complimentary mango chips to munch on just after placing the first order and complimentary papad just before the main course is served. To sum up the excellent food, they serve chocolate paan at last. Prices are high but given the overall excellent experience, its certainly worth it. Service was good too. A must visit again place !

The ala-carte food in this restaurant is simply fabulous. We tried Indian, Chinese and Continental, the presentation was nice, looked appetising and tasted good. Tamara has beautiful and cozy ambience, however the staff needs training. We had to go through multiple iterations before the waiter got our order right.

Buffet is another story, though the spread is vast it lacked flavour and creativity. It can be best avoided.

Simply the best buffet place in town! Went there for buffet lunch. It is located right above dominos in hotel pipal tree in rajarhat. Lunch buffet costs ₹1206/- inclusive of all taxes. 

REFRESHMENTS--We were given two choices when we entered either one can choose a 150ml wine/ two beers/ two vodkas/ two whiskeys/ their day special mocktail as a welcome drink.

Okay so starting with food quality it was amazing. 
STARTERS--There were various kinds of starters which included fuchka, steamed chicken momo, fish chop, chilli prawn, chicken tandoori, paneer. Avoid trying their chicken momo as they were any ordinary chicken steam momos. Also do not try their panipuri if you want to eat the rest of the items. Being a bong and a lover of fuchka it was hard to not try it but nevertheless the tamarind water kills your hunger.

MAINS--Moving on to the mains there were huge number of items. There were two kinds of soups, pasta with various kinds of dressing and vegetables and the best part was it was a live pasta counter. There was paneer butter masala, veg biriyani, a particular spinach dish, momos and a few more items, and there was again a love papri chaat counter. The non veg comprised of turkey, fish, pork, chicken , mutton biriyani, and spaghetti.  Their turkey dish was very tasty and probably I refilled my plate twice with it. The pork was well cooked and less spicy. Didn't try their mutton biriyani so cannot comment. Their chicken was an average bengali chicken preparation. The fish on the other hand was soft and tasty. 

DESSERTS--Moving to desserts there was ice cream of assorted flavours and various toppings, there was hot brownies, mousse, assorted cut fruits, shahi tukra, tart, dahi vada, cakes. They had two varieties of cakes. We have tried their blackforest cake and I haven't tried a softer version of this cake before. Although the pieces were small. 

LOVED ITEMS- chilli prawn,fish chop , turkey, pork, fish, shahi tukra, blackforest cake.

Had a great experience and will surely return for more. Also they had courteous staff members and we were welcomed pleasantly. Refer to my account for pictures of the food items.

Loved the ambience ... We visited this place on my beloved's 25th Bday. The ambience is awesome with its blue hue all around the seats .... Staffs are well mannered and courteous. I booked it from before window side seat for 2 to feel the perfect romantic evening of Candle light dinner 💕 

We were welcomed in a nice way and were served with nachos along with tamarind sauce, it was too good to taste.
We ordered Peshwari murg from Indian menu.. it was too good... soft n well cooked n ofcourse finger licking. 
Later they served us with complimentary watermelon fruit in mint leaves in a glass which was even good n changed our taste all of a sudden.
Nxt we ordered for Mutton Biriyani with raita....it was good n well cooked.. pieces of potato n mutton..!
Loved everything about dis place .. even the music being played in background was really soothing n nice to enjoy the romantic dinner. 
A perfect place to have a Candle light dinner with ur Beloved.. 😍

It was Indeed a special day and the decision to opt for a buffet at tamara made the day more special. The starters (prawn,paneer,chicken,fish etc..) and phuckas were delicious.. They offers Immense variety in main course (I wish I can mention all of them) And the dessert​ section was something to die for.
The beautiful location , smart decoration with great ambiance was the cherry on top.
A great bang for your buck.
Strongly recommend..

A must try lunch buffet for every food lovers. 
Yet to try the dinner in Tamara.. very nice ambience I must say.

We enjoyed screw driver from there classic bar menu along with murg tikka peshawari. Chicken was perfectly tender and juicy. Then we had mutton roganjosh with steamed rice. Mutton was well cooked and preparation was very authentic in taste. 
Last and not the least they serve chocolate paan that was show stealer of the evening.we loved that flavour.
The service staff were very helpful and cordial. Thanks to them for a wonderful evening.

This is located at Chinar Park near CC2.
The interior is pretty and well maintained.
We had gone here to have their lunch buffet.
We had to travel a lot to reach this place but the food was totally worth the travel.
•Starter-The buffet had a wide spread of starters beginning with chicken soup,bread,salad,Fish tikka,paneer makhmali,chicken tandoori,prawn,crispy vegetables,fuchka served on table and numerous dips.
○We were served with two complementary aam panna in the beginning which were tiny but refreshing much.
The starters tasted amazing especially the fish melted in my mouth.
•Maincourse-Moving on to the lavish maincourse which had steam rice,methi daal,aloor dum,paneer,spinach pinacotta in veg section and non veg items included basa fish in a supertasty gravy,pork belly,chicken and mutton biryani.
We had both veg and non veg items and each and every items were lipsmacking.
The pork belly was perfectly cooked with proper proportions of fat and meat.
Just that the biryani was cold when we took it and who likes cold biryani,right?
In make your own chat counter I made paapri chaat and it tasted nice.Also had dahi vada.

•Dessert-The dessert section is on point and an absolute bliss.
There were pastries-strawberry and chocolate,ice cream,brownies,mishti doi,sahi tukda etc.
•Mocktail-Apart from this,we took a pineapple mocktail seperately which was average and a bit too salty.
The staffs are courteous.
We had a great time here.

A perfect 5 out of 5 ! Posh decor,courteous staff and awesome food. We planned for the buffet but eventually couldn't  resist ourselves to go for a la carte after going though the full menu. Mutton Chapli kebab,BBQ pork belly and traditional Golden fried prawn with Tequila Sunrise and Daiquiri was a perfect start. The taste was finger licking and quantity was huge.After finishing these we were restless what to go for main course and Mr. Ramkrishna guided us to jump on Bekti A la Diana and Tamara's Signature grilled chicken and we never looked back.And the deserts,again suggested by the man, we ended with Ecuadorian liquid chocolate with peanut butter cookie and Vanilla bean ice cream and Chocolate Montecarlo. They serve complimentary chocolate paan as well.

This was our first experience at Tamara-Pipal Tree Hotel, and in a word it was excellent. First of all, it was Poila Boisakh, and along with that, it was my mama mami's 25th anniversary, so we were doubly happy. Talking about food, it was really good (although I felt, a few additions​ could be made to the starters section). The main course had a huge variety and every dish was cooked with finesse. The fish batter fry was finger licking. The dessert section had a range of items to offer, all of which were equally good. Starting from misti doi, assorted pastries, mango mousse, to ice creams, kalakand cake all were great. But what is best about this place is the welcoming atmosphere and the courteous behaviour of all the stuffs. Even though it was a festive day, they were on their toes, assisting, helping through out. Overall it was a great experience. Thank you. :)

For a long it was on my checklist. Finally had a chance to visit it on a birthday occasion. It was a little far from CC2. The entrance was posh. The restaurant ambience was marvelous. Tables with road view, soft cushions. It was indeed comfortable. Hotel staffs were very welcoming, well dressed. We opted for buffet. Unlimited welcome drinks(aam panna), starters: crispy fish, paneer, chilli prawn, chicken, fuchka, one or two veg items were served on table. Prawn was really good. Main course: some veg items which I didn't try, breads (naan was very tender), fish item, chilli pork, murgh curry, mutton biriyani, lots n lots of garnishing items n diff type of salads. Biriyani was bengali style with aloo in it. I have tried buffet at many places, but main courses here were very tasty. Dessert: assorted pastries, misti doi (it was just awesome), kalakad, one rabri kind of item, ice cream parlour, chocolate brownie. I may miss one or two items. But everything was good. Total bill was 4467 including 3 kingfisher beer pint. Buffet rate was around 780. It was very much reasonable. Really a must visit place.

This place is quite distant from where I stay and if I am taking the pain to travel a long distance just for a buffet, then automatically my expectations are soaring high. The ambience is superb here. There are seats overlooking the streets as well as comfy cushions to make your seating comfortable. For starters in the lunch buffet there are tikkas, panipuris, variety of breads, variety of salads, crispy chilli babycorn, dahi vadas and lots more along with a complimentary welcome drink. The starters section is very good here. The panipuris are very flavourful. So your expectation has already gone up. Now comes the main course with biryani, chicken, mutton, dals, plain rices, papads. But none of them catches much of your attention (especially the undercooked meat of biryani). The desserts are okayish, but the shahi tukra is no where near to what it should taste and the cakes also fail to impress you with their flavours. The kiwi mint mousse is fine and the ice creams are kept in a very clumsy way. The dahi is good though. So overall why go for this buffet when we have so many better buffets near us!

Visited this place for a team lunch...  Yeah it was a buffet.  The food was majorly on the tastier side, although the options were on the lower side... But I am not complaining,  given the quality of food. The surprising element was the 'phuchka'  (panipuri)... Liked it to the core :)   courteous staff as well...  Would love to pay a visit again..!!

We went for a lunch buffet at Tamara. Undoubtedly it has a variety of foods. However only providing varieties does not guarantee the taste also. 
Tandoori chicken was hard, Fish fry was average, fish menu of main course did not have any taste, the Mutton Biriyani had hard uncooked Mutton pieces. 
I loves crispy veg, panter tikka, pastry, shahi tukra, fuchka, welcome drink which was aampanna and pan. However keeping the cost in mind , I would not really prefer to eat just good veg menus. 
Tamara please improve the food quality.

I have been to Tamara for dinner quite a few times and have loved it always. Lovely candle light experience with a great view to the street in front, this place is extremely romantic. They have an array of cuisines like North Indian, Chinese, Mexican, Thai, Continental and everything is good. What I love the most about them is the complementary starters and chocolate paans they offer. This time they offered watermelon shots an additional complementary add-on to beat the heat. Located opposite City Centre 2, is it easily accessible. Quantity served is good, staff is extremely well behaved, service is great and prices are affordable. Another advantage is proximity to the airport. They offer buffet also but have not tried that ever. Tamara is one of my favorites in the city.

Awesome service and good food. The starters were awesome. In the main course fish amritsari was mouth watering. Good decorative interior. In the Chinar Park area one of the happening place for the long time. Keep up the good work. Plan to visit again

This place is simply mind blowing with the service, delicious dishes and ofcourse ambiance. The restru has got its getup in a desi style with a special sitting arrangement for the waiting guests . I will place it among one of the best themed buffets in the city. Unlike other buffets it has limited receipes(limitation quantity depends on individual) but all the preperations are just awsome and unique. Especialy@ the kebab series which served the best curtain raiser along with the aam panna. The mouth watering nonveg main course included poultry, fish and pork for which I can say was cooked with the perfect ratio of softness:spice. I visited this place on a very espicial occation which actualy made my day :)

Wow! 
What a place!

One of the best buffet in town. All the dishes were too good. Service was excellent. 

Then why 4.5 instead of 5?

Just because the breads were bit hard. The pork belly dish smelled very bad.

Otherwise all other dishes were excellent and superb. 

Keep it up 👍🏼

I went for lunch here few days after new year.. We reached there at 2:30pm or so. We asked for ala carte  menu, but the restaurant people suggested us to take buffet and we agreed. They didn't inform us that the buffet will be closing at 3:00 pm. Even when we took food in plate and kept plate on table and went to get some more food, they cleared our table inspite of the fact that we said them not to. A very bad experience. I will never suggest anyone to go to this place.

I chose Tamara for a relaxing lunch with friends on a Saturday afternoon. i am glad i did the buffet spread was very good for the price and it was tasty too. but the ambience and the service was impressive. the view of the road without the noise of passing vehicles and the service by all the staff was why i rate this restaurant as 4.5. When i mentioned that one of the starters was cold Ram Prakash who was serving us immediately arranged for fresh starters and brought it to our table. Thank you once again.

Wow, what a place!! Why didn't I come across this place earlier?!
Thanks to Little App, I got the buffet meals in a discounted rate and Tamara certainly lived up to my expectations.
Great ambiance. Wonderful staff members. Amazing hospitality. Exceptional food quality. I simply couldn't find any fault in their service or menu.
Each and every item on the buffet menu was delicious and filling. Some of the innovative dishes in veg and non-veg section were equally brilliant. The dessert section was so tempting that I spent an hour feasting on the delicacies.I am surely visiting this place again. Very soon!Cheerio!!

Beautiful restaurant, great food, good innovation and presentation and above all a very helpful and friendly staff. A perfect place for a romantic dinner or family meal. It's nice to see such places opening up in and around VIP Road and I hope it does well. The food is at par with the best restaurants of Calcutta . Since they have quite a large menu and I haven't sampled all of it , it would be difficult for me to pick a particular dish , but whatever we had ordered was lovely. Special mention to the dal makhani and butter chicken.

After so many cancelled decisions,we decided to give Tamara a try..nd we didnt regret.. 
Located jst before CC2 while going from d haldirams crossing,this place is a gem..

AMBIENCE - awesome,soothing, refreshing nd ya too romantic..spacious nd well decorated..

FOOD - we were 5,so we tried a variety of dishes..TamarA's signature chicken,Pan Fried chilly fish dry,chicken ala greque,steamed fish,chicken in Thai green curry,crispy calamari chicken,schezwan fried rice mixed..each one of these were too good except d chicken Thai green curry,which we found slightly bland ..bt d best were ala greque nd pan Fried chilly fish.. On drinks we had Bliss,Nirvana nd d other one name I forgot..Bliss was excellent,d other two were average.. Mud pie chocolate was also superb.. In between we were being served some complimentary snacks also,which we loved a lot..

SERVICE n STAFF : prompt..staffs were very polite nd courteous,helpful in choosing our dishes nd ya,they smiled a lot,even on our jokes,which we found very amusing,may b bczI was wid 4 girls ;-)

PRICE : A bit on d higher side,bt after having ur food u will not b even slightly disappointed..we had a bill  around 4300 for 5 people (3 drinks,3 starters,3 side dish,1 main course,1 dessert).. 

OVERALL - Highly satisfied nd highly recommended..wid a slightly heavy wallet m going to revisit soon.. Thanks team Tamara for an amazing experience :-)

Visited this place on Saturday with 7 friends and opted for the Non-Veg lunch buffet.
After reading Zomato reviews, I was convinced that Tamara won't disappoint. But that was so not true!

We reached at 1:30 pm and as we sat down, there were no greetings from the staff. A lady approached us with a poker face and offered us wet handkerchiefs to wipe our hands. No one spoke anything at all. Not even a 'Good afternoon' or 'Welcome'

We received Aam Panna as a complimentary drink. It tasted delicious and all of us had more than 1 serving.

Starters:
1. Chilly Fish
2. Chicken Kebab
3. Paneer Tikka
4. Russian Chicken Salad
5. Egg (Deemer Devil)
6. Egg Mayonnaise
7. Golguppa
8. Soup
9. Pasta
And some more which I don't remember and did not have an interest in having

Chilly fish tasted superb. Chicken Kebab and Russian Chicken salad tasted good. Deemer Devil tasted ok. 
Paneer Tikka was tasteless and not fresh. However, on asking the staff, they responded swiftly and served us hot and fresh Paneer Tikka which tasted good but could have been better.
There was no prawn.  :(

Main course:
1. Kolkata Mutton Biryani
2. Badshahi Murgh
3. Schezwan Chicken 
4. Fried Fish
5. Paneer Butter Masala

Desserts:
1. Ice cream (5 flavours)
2. Orange Mousse
3. Baked Rasgulla
4. Pastries
Had tons of options to customize them such as wafers, brownies, chocolate syrup etc.

Mutton in the biryani tasted old and uncooked. A huge disappointment.
Badshahi Murgh and Schezwan Chicken tasted great. Fried fish tasted good. Paneer butter masala tasted sweet, more like Shahi Paneer.

I don't have a sweet tooth so I didn't have most of the desserts. I tried the chocolate pastry which tasted awful. The orange mousse tasted so bad, it was bitter.

Food - 2.5/5 (Average with some great delicacies such as Chilly fish, Aam Panna)

Service - 0.5/5

It was so bad it ruined our complete experience. There was no interaction at ALL. Not once during the entire lunch did anyone ask us how the food was and volunteered to take our opinions. I did not see a single smile on anyone's faces. 
It was almost as if we were invisible to them and had to remind them that we were eating there by calling them when needed. The 0.5 star out of 5 is only for the prompt service they offered AFTER our request, which again was received with no warmth at all.
On paying the bill, there was a frown so bad on the waiter's forehead, it seemed he would spontaneously combust. 

Ambience:

Not really suited for a group of guys wanting to enjoy a lunch buffet. So I won't rate them.
The atmosphere was quiet with serene music and the milieu was decorated with an Indian feel.

I have been to Barbeque Nation before and the service there is light years ahead in terms of comfort, warmth and feedback. Food too is much better in terms of variety and taste, but the gap isn't as wide as it is in service. I will not recommend this place to anyone who wants to go for buffet and will ask him/her to consider another place. We came all the way from Kharagpur to try out this place for the 1st time and had an abysmal experience.

Coming to food,each and every dish they provide taste delicious and distinct in taste.
They serve veggies,fish,chicken,mutton,egg for starters.The spread for main course have various varities from steamed rice to biriyani to veg chowmien.Probably not the best buffet to beat that of Barbeque Nation/Sigree,but offers better than any other joints.
Lastly,service was excellent.Keep up the good work.

COME, FALL IN LOVE AGAIN!

Yes this should be the catch line of Tamara. One of the best dine in option in Rajarhat, may be in Kolkata.

Some personal talk - Me and my spouse used to stay in two different city for our job sake. So to maintain a long distance relationship and also to bring good vibes in your life, you have to do something special frequently. She refer me Tamara's name. And boy, they didnt disappoint!

We went for a weekend dinner on a reserve table. Spacious, catchy luxurious elegent decor, well mannered stuff will impress you in a moment. Take the seats beside windows. Enjoy the candle light dinner with your loved one.

Food didnt take much time to arrive after ordering.
For starters, we had bacon wrapped chicken kebab. Juicy it was. Bacon was not crispy. Medium done. Chicken morsels was soft. Bacon could have been a little more.

We had it with two cocktails -- Glass case of emotion and Moscow Mule.

Moscow mule was too tangy due to lemon. Didnt find any flavor of spirit. This surely let us down. 

Glass case of emotion - LIIT you can say, whiskey, vodka, gin, cola and orange liquor. Traditionally LIIT served in a long glass. This was served in a scotch glass. Amount also not satisfactory.

Tamara need good mixologist to improve the cocktail experience. Just my advice!

In main entries, 
Grilled Bekti sizzler will awe you in admiration. Perfectly grilled, enough amount, saute vegetables. Surely this is a recommended one.

Another dish we take was Pomfret fish with prawn fried rice. Grilled pomfret remind me of our Goa trip foodie diaries! Rice was also splendid. Good amount.

Both the main perfectly justify the Tamara's recommendation and glory.

Tamara means spice. So the various spices used in different parts of the worlds presented in Tamara's global cuisine offering was enough to convince us to visit again soon. Just need to improve the drinks, I will check next time for sure. Whoever staying outside kolkata, my fellow followers, visit atleast once whenever you will visit Kolkata.

Go visit yourself, cause this dine in will be a walk to remember !

Cheers!

First thing I must say, the staff are really good. From a simple welcome gesture to helping you through orders and prompt delivery of food requests, Tamara staff got things spot on. I had been there for the buffet after being recommended by friends. And they lived up to the reputation. If you are tired of usual kebab-only buffets, you should try this one. The variety is well spread out to address different choices. Prawn peyaji and fish were nice, and mutton kebab (although is more like mutton chop) is pretty nice too. A nice place. Will visit soon.

After reading all the review we planed to go to  Tamra on 1 st Jan. But really disappointed. Food quality is very bad. In buffet there are few items are their. Price is too high. I prefer barbeque is the best to go for buffet and any north indian dishes.
Only the thing is ambiance is very good. But other food qualities are not good.

Wonderful ambience. The music was soothing and you can see the busy road from the first yet it wont disturb your peace. Though we did not order much,to be precise some beer and a mutton dish. So will not comment on that. The chips they gave with some mango flavoured dip that was new. You need a quiet evening with your partner definitely go there. The only drawback is, yes in candle light the it is difficult to browse the menu :) service very prompt; we need hot water and they served it in no time. A big thank you for that. Will go there again. Cheers.

Tamara- a fine dining restaurant located in Rajarhat, is definitely worth mentioning. The first thing to grab one's attention here is the beautifully decorated restaurant. The Staff are all very well dressed in beautiful Indian attires and are extremely courteous and well behaved in their code of conduct. A calm and peaceful surrounding with extraordinary services. Now coming to the food, everything was enticing. We loved the American corn in Spinach with Butter Rice.The overall experience was awesome not only because of their taste but also due to their creativity.

We had a team wing-ding at this place. The ambiance was quiet pleasing. In the starters the best ones were paneer tikka, crispy vegetables, chilly fish, mangsher devil and dahi vada. The mock tail and hariyali kebab were not upto the  expectations.
They also had a large number of salads including Russian salad and pasta salad.
In the main course we have a lot of luscious dishes. Chicken butter masala ,Lime baked fish ,paneer lababdar, dal makhani and mutton biryani were palatable.
Now the last course- Gajar halwa, 5 types of ice-cream with a large number of add-on's, orange mousse, misti doi and assorted pastry were scrumptious.We felt a little disappointed with the baked rasgullas.
Overall the feast was worth remembering and memorable one.

Had a foodies gathering over there, went for the continental dishes, ordered for a mixed meat grill, pork chops , lamb . The lamb was the best closely followed by the grilled chicken in the mixed meat. The pork was nice but the honey glazed sauce was a bit disappointing, may be too sweet for may taste. Overall nice experience, the décor and all were good. Can be visited for continental in this part of the town.

Simple but comfortable cushioned sitting arrangement. Food is quite up to the mark. Buffet and ala carte both at par. Buffet platter starts with fuchka and kebabs followed by quite a few variety of main course and decent desserts. Alacarte has a variety of dishes including a plater of sausages and kebabs too. They have palate cleansers too in the list for better experience in terms of taste. The green liquid in the shot glass below in the picture is the palate cleanser. They serve you with refreshing scented towel on your arrival to make you feel revived before you start. Overall it might be a place to visit tomorrow.

In the middle of one of d most congested traffic area in d city, u cud find urslf all apart. Nice parking lot. Awesome reception & hospitality. Food orders could b discussed well as suitable. A good thing, thrs a taste changer of watermelon & pineapple after starters. Food quality needs appauses. We took fish starters, vedci platter & pork. And the bst things comes now is the environment....wooooo!!!!! Serene....paeceful. perfect candlelight dinner.

The style of the place is good 

The environment is nice 

But the value for money with respect to food is a bit low.

Not satisfactory quality.

Walking distance from CC2 Rajarhat, Tamara- Pipal tree has a great varieties of food in Buffet. Went with my girlfriend today. Ambience was great, stuffs were good and helpful. We bought 2 buffet coupons from Little app worth 649/-
Starters were good, we had Fuchkas, soups, chicken, fish, paneer preparations, Egg mayaonese, salads and Dim er devil yeah u heard it right,. They were really good we both loved it. After that we had Kolkata style Mutton biriyani, Chicken butter masala, Fish preparation and kung pao Chicken. Fish was okayish but other preparations were good. In Desserts they offered Shahi Tukra, Ice Creams, Brownies, cakes mishti doi above all they had variety of toppings which we loved the most.
Overall a very good experience. :)
P.S.- I am strictly Non-veg when it's a Buffet matter :P so didn't get time for the rest of the veg items, but surely they were all good.

Its a disaster...

 

Visited the restaurant day before. Had been planning for long looking at the reviews. We were greeted warmly. Valet was prompt. The place was well done and lighting was appropriate. So far so good and it possibly ended here. Firstly the menu online and the options at the restaurant were very different. 

We ordered all Veg Indian items : 

Starter - Kebabs (I think it was SUBZ GALOUTI KEBAB)

Yellow Dal

Pindi Chana

Tawa Veg

Tandoori Rotis

and Butter Naan

The starter was okayish. In main course Yellow Dal was how it should be - nothing great or bad about it. Pindi Chana was the worst preparation - it did not have any salt, no masala, no taste. Moreover possibly Gandharaj lemon was used in it which had spoilt the taste completely. Even as a part of salad we were offered Gandharaj lemon and not the normal lemon pieces. Last time had seen this happening at a Dhaba in North Bengal. Tawa Veg was tasteless as well. Roti was coarse. Naan was good.

The waiter was initially on the toes and prompt. Till the time he served main course and came to ask how the food was as I complained primarily about Pindi Chana and showed my displeasure. He went away saying Oh is it and kind of gestured as if he will check or get a replacement and then never came back. Possibly he asked someone else to take over who was completely laid back and had to be asked repeatedly for things. He brought a Butter Naan which was half burnt - no one at a place like this would have served it. I objected. He said "Aisa he hai yeh sir" - I said replace and he unwillingly went and got one. He too disappeared thereafter without serving water I had asked for. The place wasnt overcrowded and there was no stress on the waiters. I got hold of the original waiter and asked him why he had disappeared and left us without further service after I complained of Pindi Chana - its then that he reluctantly offered replacement and I declined stating we are done and wouldnt like to continue and then asked him to get the bill. After slight delay the bill was there - possibly they were figuring out whether they should charge for the Chana - eventually sense prevailed and they did not. The waiter offered to serve Choclete Paan at the end complimentary. It was a nightmarish experience I had taken my guest through. And it wasnt over. When we came down we were told no driver was available and was asked to get the car myself. I have now already written twice to the hotel asking for a soft copy of my bill but have had no response despite reminding. Not a place to be for sure. All show no substance. I think they might have been good in the past given the reviews but have become too complacent now. Came back ordered pizza and enjoyed much more after all the pain

This place is romantic. Starting from the purple velvety cushions to the ceilings and the view(It is gorgeous!), it all has a touch of finesse to it. The ambience is very nice, especially at night. Every foodie must visit this place.
The starters are good. Plus, they really decorate the place where the buffet is present. It shows the dedication behind all of this. Food is excellent.
In starters, You have fish(basha), chicken kebabs, chcicken wings, paneer, Egg(deemer devil). Special addition: Fuchka/golgappe. ALso they have a nice Russian salad and bread.
The main course is great. The desserts present are Ice-Cream with lots of customizations like waffles, kit-kat, etc. The mishti doi is nice. They even put a rose petal on it.
I liked it all except for the stone glasses they serve you water in. Its not so good as it sounds!

Overall : Excellent 8/10.

Where do i begin.  I  was so mesmerised with the ambience , service that i have no words ..   i would say Beautiful!   and truly loved the candle light setting,  sat near the big glass window.  Only IF it rained haha!!  

We were greeted with a warm smile followed by a scented wet towel and in house pappad sort of a side dish which was was good.   We ordered Lat me kai deep fried chili chicken which was delicious , yummy!   loved it totally .  Ceaser salad as usual was amazing ..  Then we ordered for 2 main course meal Chicken a la grecque and Chicken grill and onion steak with chessy smashed potato which was delicious again.  I was full till my throat so couldn't try the desert but on my next visit i will def. give that a shot..  For drinks we took a glass of white wine Jacob's Creek and Heineken,  was lil disappointed  that hoegaarden  and corona wasn't available, wish they kept stock.  Overall it was an amazing experience and we loved every single moment of it..   oh! not to forget the complimentary Chocolate pan we got and it was so good that i wanted some more of those :D    Can't wait to visit this beautiful place again.

Went with friend for lunch buffet through a little aap coupon.
Location : 5-6 mins walk from cc2. The dine -in is at the 1st floor.
Ambiance: cozy place with a lovely view of the road. We went for lunch and the view made me feel . Evening time the feel would have been a notch higher and candle light and the outside view. Painting over the wall .
Staff : the people are very polite and helpful.

Now coming to food : the spread is gud. I will write what all I can remember :-P 
As we sat we were given a player of puchka . Tha pucha were warm . The khatta pani was very gud.
I got so busy eating that took a pic when only one puchka was left 😝😝😝😝

SOUP: 
1. MANCHOW CHICKEN SOUP
2. SWEET CORN SOUP
Both the soup were fine. 

 STARTER : 
1. paneer tikka : paneer was soft and the masala was in ryt quantity.
2. Crispy baby corn : okayish. Nothing out of ordinary.
3. Chicken kabaab: the best starter out of all. Soft chicken charred perfectly. 
4. Fish : this was real tasty . Tempura like coating . Fist tasted gud 
5. Egg : it was more like bangalir dimer choper sofisticated version . Nice
There was a mustard dip which I would specially mention coz it was something I never tasted before and it was real.gud. 
  
Apart from these there was a papri chat counter were I can make my own paprichat.

SALAD :
There was around 6 type of salad
The one I.loved most was the pasta salad..
Dahi vada was also nice. 
 
MAIN COURSE
1. Lemon scented rice
2. Daal makhni
3. Alu and gobi ka sabji
4. Garlic chowmin
5. Paneer garlic
6. Veg lasgane 
7. Kolkata mutton  biryani
8. Chicken kasha
9. Chicken in oyster sauce
10. Fish garlic which was a continental dish
I loved the veg section of the main course but was disappointed me was the biryani the rice was literally hard and few the grain were undercooked. 
More over the continental fish dish was too too salty. One can't have that. 

DESERT 
1. SHAHI TUKDA : This was real.nice
2. Cake : there 2 types and both were gud 
3. Misti Doi : this was just awsome 
4. Moose : not what taste I like so no comments.
5. Ice cream and a stall for making your customised as you like. : This was okay but I request PLEASE CHANGE THE VWAY YOUR KEEP YOUR ICECREAM . NOT THE BEST WAY AND I FOUND IT BIT MESSY . 
6. BROWNIE : it was hard . When I told them they wanted to bring me a fresh batch but I was too full so can't complain. 

Overall  I would love to give them a 4pt but the biryani and the fish was a disappointment  so I will settle for 3.5 
It a gud enough place but I can do a lot better .

This place is quite exquisite and classy. It has beautiful shamiana's with warm and dim lighting. Small candles light up the tables.Also,soothing music and good spacing between tables ,makes it an ideal setup for a romantic dinner. The glasses on the table seemed to be made of rock and looked very premium. The salt and pepper containers had a 'tree trunk' design. All these small details really added to the wonderful look and feel of the place.
     My food experience here -
1) The hot and sour soup - Understated and beautiful flavours.

2)Lat me Kai - The chicken pieces were quite soft and succulent and I liked the flavour. 

3)Chilli Fish dry - The flavour was good ,however the outside was a little chewy.

4)Faridabadi murgh pulao - The chicken and potatoes - both should have been more tender in this dish. It is a mildly spicy pulao.

5)Thai Green curry - This was the outright star and a must have ! The flavours were spot on ! This is probably the only place where the curry is thick but the flavour takes the cake. Beautiful.

6) Fish and chips - Wonderfully crispy and tasty . Thumbs up for this one as well !

All in all, I was quite satisfied with the food. On the service front , I felt that the person who took our order was in a rush. That was a slight anomaly to my otherwise happy experience at this fantastic property. Thumbs up for Tamara.

Tamara is located quite far from my place and hence it took so long for me to visit this restaurant about which I heard extremely good reviews. But as the saying goes, better late than never ... at last I did visit this place last sunday. The ala-carte menu was tempting and so was the buffet. Was in a fix but ultimately decided to go with Buffet. The spread was very nicely designed with equal emphasis given to Indian , oriental and continental dishes. Both spicy and non spicy food was available and hence you can say there's something for everyone. The total food item in the spread easily crosses 40 and difficult to name each one of them. But the ones which stole my heart were Chicken Sweet corn soup, Mutton Biriyani, Fish Mediterranean, and both the chicken items (One was Indian and One continental). Desserts do deserve a special mention specially the Caramel Pudding and Kheer Firni. 
But sorry friends i was so busy making my stomach happy that I forgot to click pics. :-)

Over all: Highly Recommending.

This is one of the best places I have been for food. They don't market themselves too much though. But the food is really good. So is the service. 

I was very impressed with the food as they don't serve the typical things in a menucard. The service was so good and we were well taken care of. 

I am definitely going back to this place again and I highly recommend this place to everybody. However this after a meal in this restaurant, you might have a considerable amount of pocket pinch.

Seldom we go to a place and fall in love with the place instantly, specially in this part of India. Our quest was a few days back to this beautiful, elegant destination. The first thing you notice here is the warmth and courtesy of the people working there. The intelligent menu with a perfect balance to sooth those taste buds of yours appropriately suited to the way we Calcattians are. 

Tamara is the confluence of excellent dinning, warm service and alluring environment. 
(P.S. - Take HER there, a perfect place to make her feel special)

If you wish to have some great fine dining experience and make your date/friends/family thank you for a wonderful treat, do visit Tamara. 
8-10 minutes walk from City Center 2, this place has a decently done entrance, interior is warm and classy with a shamiyana feel. 

We ordered: 
Italian Fish Picatta: Batter fried fish served with dip. Crispy outside, succulent inside, this dish deserves a thumbs up. 
Bohra style dabba gosht: This dish was recommended by their staff.. And I thoroughly enjoyed it. A semi traditional lamb meat dish with sumptuous and flavorful taste. 
Monte Carlo (dessert) : This is how a perfect meal should end. A big thumbs up for this delectable dessert. 

Service: The staffs here are very much courteous. They work really hard to make their guests comfortable and happy. 

Portion: Sufficient. 

Price: A little on the higher side. 

Absolutely recommended. Do visit first, thank me later..!

It's a great place for fine dining with family. I love the lunch buffet which they prepare with 40 odd items on the menu. The buffet consist of 5 non veg and 5 veg starters. Each item they serve is very tasteful.  They serve the pani puri in the table. The mutton biryani is of great taste. The main course consist of chicken and pork items. If you have a sweet tooth then you would love the desserts served which consist of baked mihidana, baked rosogolla and pastries or mouse. 

The best thing about the restaurant is their candle light dinner at night when the ambiance and decor is very romantic in the restaurant. The staff is as good as the food. The best part stay at last when they give you complementary chocolate pan or chocolate bars.

The food was good especially the fish starter, baby-corn, and shahi tukda. The main thing I felt missing was a prawn starter item.

The starters were not served to our table, we had to go to take them. This was odd in comparison to other top restaurants serving buffet.

We visited this restaurant on the occasion of our wedding anniversary last year. We bought a nearby couple coupon and availed the offer. The restaurant has a wonderful décor. It gives you a very relaxed and serene ambiance. Loved the colour combinations of the upholstery and the furniture. The buffet spread Was equally good as it had a global menu starting from kababs to Lebanese American and European food. I simply loved the kababs. Very well marinated and well cooked. The other main course meal included biryani, various types of bread, vegetarian dal, paneer items,etc. They also had a wide spread Chinese items. I loved the pork sausages. Coming to the desserts they had a wide spread and I tried each and every dessert on the menu. The service was excellent and the waiters and waitresses knew their job pretty well. An excellent place to experience a fine dining lunch with your family and friends.

Must say Decor, Ambience and Hospitality is outstanding. Food variety is a little bit minimal. Not all dishes are delicious, but u have to choose carefully.

This restaurant stands out clearly a winner in that area. The decor, ambience, staff hospitality, food; all gives you a tremendous foodgasm. I would have rated it 5 but for two important reasons -- first one being that their chicken items are not that good, but excellent fish & lamb items are served. Next disappointing reason being the pricing of alcohol which is on the costlier side. Otherwise I would suggest all to check this restaurant out, it is really good.

Went on a sunday afternoon for lunch. The buffet system is quite different. And menu very unique. Sitting arrangement is so you can enjoy the view of biswa bangla sarani from top. Starters included panipuri, cheese spring rolls as well as fish fry and chicken fry. Sorry to say the aforementioned non veg starters were not at all good. Coming to theain course- lots of dishes from veg and non veg section as well as a pasta counter is there. I liked the pork belly preparation- succulant and tasty. Desserts were so so palatable and out of the common things. But one thing i must say- keep the ice cream beside the toppings instead of keeping only toppings and ice cream to be served separately. It makes no sense to be truthful. Otherwise a good place to dine.

Tamara is derieved from the word "tamar" meaning peepal tree in hebrew sylmolizing beauty and fruitfullness of the tree.With sanskrit slokas in the walls,bells hanging the entrance,candlelights all the way, a beautiful shamiana used for the roof, water served in earthen glasses and slow devotional songs humming in the background with a perfect view of the Rajarhat connector its true to its name.Located just a few metres opposite CC2,and with ample car parking available its a perfect destination for a long drive on a romantic day.
Coming to the food,we were welcomed with complimentary drinks. Among the starters there were multiple items ranging from fuchkas,Chicken tandoori,chinese fish starter,paneer kabab,mixed vegtables fry,hot and sour soupveg lassagna rolls.They were served with mustard sauce and white sauce.The fish preparation was beautiful with boneless fish fried to the right amount.
Varieties of salads were there ranging from eggsalad,green salad and sprout salad.
However one thing I felt a tad different was the limited no. Of choices when it came to the main course.In the non veg section there were only chicken kasha biriyani,and chicken in garlic sauce.In the veg counter with dal makhani,paneer,veg manchurian,noodles and rice.
However it was compensated by the vast no of choices for the desserts.Ice cream flavours were chocolate,strawberry,vanilla and kesarpesta with a vast no of toppings choices ranging from honey to chocolate sauce to choco chips and others.
Overall it was a great dining experience with good quality food.The pocket pinch was 722/- for the afternoon lunch buffet
Happy dining..Nom nom

This place is an experience right from the first tep! The decor makes you feel as if you are amidst soft living and the niceties of royalty. Very plush furniture and furnishings. Even the drinking glasses are old timey and heavy bottomed stone. Beautifully done all in all. At night the ambience is even better as dinner is candle lit!

I tried the buffet here and the spread was more than modest. There is an extra table for preparing your own chats which is an added specialty and very cleverly thought up!

The food is good. They have a wide array of choices in cuisine with indian, chinese and even thai being features. They make a great Thai Green Curry and this is one of the few places where i found the vegetarian to outdo the non vegetarian food. Also do Not forget to try the chocolate paan.

This is a good place to visit for a new experience if you really want to mix it up and do something special!!

Tamara is a medieval period village styled restaurant, Tamara means someone who is high in spirituality, affectionate, imaginative & cooperative, who is spiritually aware & prone to self sacrifice. The ambience & decor is done by keeping the true essence of the meaning. Sanskrit shlokas written on the walls, diya bati done on the walls & on all the tables, water served in black stone glasses this place is so spiritual and the background spiritual humming & lovely view of the road adds to the charm. Recently when i was there with my maa & husband almost late night munching on some nachos & aam shorshe chutney which was a complimentary munchie we enjoyed seeing the flight taking off as its near the airport, on the chinar park rajarhat road connector. We ordered chello kebabs, as my mom and i, we dont eat chicken they had replaced the chicken sheekh kebab with fish kebab. The kebabs were soft & yummy, the steam basmati rice with soft butter & zest of parsley was so satisfying. The menu has diffrent types of veg & non veg platter, thai mexican food is available too. Pocket pinch is not too much. Nice place to be with family, friends & loved ones.

Went for Pujo Lunch. The ambience of the place is good, the property looks nice. To give it credit, the multi-cuisine lives up to its name. Be it grilled betki, biryani or kababs all dishes were very nice. Service was overall good. It is slightly off location but its a nice drive to this place. Surely a place to visit !!

Happy Pujo my lovely readers! Lots of plans must be your way, right? Ofcourse it is. Guess what? Today my post is going to make an addition to your plans’ list yet again. Pipal Tree Hotel is a name that everybody is acquainted with. Housed within the first floor of Pipal Tree, is the Tamara. Known for its lovely decor, the Buddhist feel, the ‘shamiana’ decor overhead, the contrasting colors in pink and white and grey makes it a perfect place for a dainty date or a meet-up with the closest of friends or even a family lunch. Now when Tamara launches its special buffet menu for this Durga Puja, it even makes itself a wow option to be counted in by the foodies of the city.

Indulged in a three course meal here during Pujo. The fish preparations were what I loved the most, be it the tandoori fish tikka for starters or the Bhetki Florentine for main course. The signature chicken steak was a little above average, would like to see some form of carbs on that platter apart from fries. The chocolate samosas with orange-cardamom sauce for dessert was delish but the star of the evening was the chocolate paan they serve in the end. Appreciated the watermelon sorbet they served as a palate cleanser between each course as well. Service though a tad but slow, is extremely warm and engaging. Overall had a great dinner experience!

Great deco , good service with excellent food.
Though the are a multi q joint the chef mentioned that they specialize in continental
So we stuck with that.
The food is really good , we started of with fish picata and bhetki squares the former excellent and the later above average. Deep fried chilli chicken was okayish.

For the main course we picked the house special chocken roast and they were happy to modify thr sides. This was excellent and thr portions were more than sufficient for 2

The blueberry cheescake was out of this world and one of the best i have had in kol

We had kids in thr group and thr servers were extra attentive and accomodated all our requests.

Going back soon !

Wow what am experience ! As most restaurants in rajarhat I went in with zero expectations but was completely blown over. Superbly decorated and thoughtfully planned menu including Indian , oriental and what I presumed was a bit if continental and Mexican. So I was strictly vegiterian today but my family movers were not so a lot of variety on the table. First up a complimentary bucket of fritters . First thumbs up. Next the crispy chilly baby corn and the dahi k kebabs. I urge you to order it even if you are hard core non vegiterian. The boys had golden fried prawn which they said was very oily with a thick batter. So I take their word for it. The mutton kebab I hear was also delicious. The restaurant server a complimentary pallette cleanser , a watermelon and coriander concoction which was fresh and did exactly what it was supposed to do. The main for us was limited to cheese kulcha garlic naan and malai kofta. Found the koftas to be too sweet. the meal ends with a pan dipped in chocolate. Wow!!. However the best bit here is the service and the presentation. The server attached to our table was so nice and attentive that he came running to tell me that a sauce had onions when another server was almost about to serve it. Excellent !! Will be back soon.

Me along with my friend and our better halves went to Tamara tonight to have a quality dinner. And I am pleased to say that we are more than satisfied. The first thing that will stuck you is the romantic environment with candle light in every table. You will also have a samiana feeling. Coming to the food, we ordered Chicken Nuggets and a Bhetki Item. Both of them were sumptuous. Also the accompaniment, be it chips with mango sauce or mouth refreshment item of watermelon, were wonderful. Finally they offered us with chocolate coated pan. I must confess I never experienced such a combination. It tasted just awesome and hence the finishing was lovely. As they say "All is Well that ends well".

An Excellent 3 Course Meal @ Tamara - Pipal Tree Hotel, New Town, Rajarhat ☺

Occasion: Lunch Invitation for Food & Restaurant Review

Who could ever think, that nestled in the upcoming new township of Rajarhat area, lies a fine diner, in a well designed hotel, that has such pleasing decor, view, food, service, hospitality and professionalism? 

Less than 3 years old, and already with a Groupon Golden Spoon Award 2015 in it's kitty, Tamara the 70 seater multicuisine restaurant is the pride and real showcase of Pipal Tree Hotel. 

Tamara's interior is themed on the lines of old world royalty. Quality upholstered chairs in three different shades but single hue, of the blue-pink color family provide for the comfortable seatings, as well as, the appeasement of the eyes. The entire ceiling is draped with white sheets, in shamiana style! During dinner time, the restaurant provides a unique romantic setting for it's diners, i.e. they don't use any form of electric lights Apparently, the entire lighting is fire based and safely encased. 

Upon entrance, most of the restaurant falls in a linear pattern, with a one sided clear view of the wide and vacant roadside outside.

To go with the royal flow, the serving staff is also dressed in the color coordinated kurtas, pajamas and jackets. 

Though Tamara is a multicuisine restaurant, but keeping in mind the fact that, most diners look for a three course meal, and they like to incorporate the elements of more than one cuisine in their meals, the restaurant's menu is broadly divided into three categories. The categories are - Appetizers, Main Course and Desserts. Cuisines are broadly divided into Western, Indian and Oriental. All the aforesaid categories first list the vegetarian options, than the non vegetarian options of all the aforesaid cuisines. Common food groups that don't fall under any specific cuisine, are mentioned at the end of the concerned category. Like - soups, salads etc. are listed towards the end of the Appetizers category.

Upon arrival, I was handed over a face towel for a freshening wipe. The three course, well curated and mostly 'Western' luncheon consisted of -

Kiddie Cocktails or Mocktails-

Humble House: The menu description read - kiwi crush, tangy Indian spices, tabasco, black pepper, salt, lime juice, sugar, top with lemonade. This mocktail arrived in a flute glass, with - three lime slices inserted at the rim, one stirrer and two black straws. With it's half yellow and half white color, and bubbles, it looked fantastic and tasted very nice. Sugar content was quite balanced. Portion served was relatively less. It went well with the served meal.

Menu Price: Rs. 180/-

Aerated Beverage: During the mid meal, all the diners ordered for Coca Cola cans, as the cheese rich food items, tend to get a little dry for the palate. Also, noone wanted to drink wine.

Rs. 140/-

Appetizers - 

Mushrooms A La Greque: A lovely and thick gravy based mushroom preparation, with lots of onions, arrived in a circular depression of a big round ceramic dish. Two toasted pav-bhaji style breads were placed on the broad rim of the dish, as accompaniments. The mushrooms were of good quality and fresh. 

This dish is a boon for mushroom lovers, as very few eateries serve this quality of mushroom preparation!

Menu Price: Rs. 290/-

Angry Asparagus & Dutch Gouda Cheese Rolls: Six stuffed rolls/cigars were served on a flat black stone slab, with a colorful and julienned side salad, and a dip. The stuffing was made of minced asparagus and gouda cheese. The rolls were well made and tasted nice.

Menu Price: Rs. 290/-

Main Course -

Vegetable Stroganoff With Herbed Rice: A big circular ceramic dish consisted of a circular mound of herbed rice, surrounded with fried grated potato, and topped with a vegetable preparation. The fried potato ring had some pickled onions on one side. The served portion was large, and it tasted nice.

Menu Price: Rs. 370/-

Day's Special Risotto - With Artichoke Pickles: Off white colored risotto, topped with artichoke pickles and coriander stems, was served in a similar plate, like the one used for serving the aforesaid mushrooms. The risotto had a thick 'khichdi' like consistancy. Pickled artichokes were something new for my palate. This dish had enough cheese quantity, and it was very well simmered. It tasted very good.

Menu Price: Rs. 425/-

Thai Green Curry With Vegetables - Jasmine Rice: A small circular mound of rice, enveloped with crescent shaped green curry, was served in a big ceramic plate cum bowl. The Jasmine rice was short grained, little sticky and well cooked. The green curry was thick in consistancy, and rich in broccoli, mushrooms and red chillies. It had a nice coconut flavour. This dish was relatively light and tasted nice.

Menu Price: Rs. 440/-

Dessert -

Tamara's White Chocolate & Hazelnut Samosa: Five golden and brown colored triangular crepes were served in a rectangular ceramic tray, with a side serving of vanilla ice cream and an orange sauce. This samosa shaped dessert was a perfect amalgamation of age old Indian savoury 'samosa' and chocolate, the most popular ingredient used in the patisseries world over! 

It needs to be mentioned that, Chocolate Samosas are a current rage amongst the recipe developers, specially vegetarian, and even a couple of local sweet shops have introduced them in their menu. But, personally, till now I never came across any perfect recipe or preparation. Either the inner chocolate filling was too gooey, or little pungent, or the outer crepe was sticky, or even flaky. However, the ones served at Tamara, were just perfect. They were beautiful to look at, uniformly shaped, easy to hold and bite, and they tasted just great. 

Even the accompanying orange sauce was a revelation in itself. It was made in-house by simmering extracted orange juice, and had a very nice cinnamon and cardamom flavor. Cinnamon has a specific smell, and it simply elevates the taste of food items, albeit if used properly and selectively. This special spice went very well with this sauce. In fact, between the chocolate samosas and this sauce, one would simply not require the served vanilla ice cream!

Menu Price: Rs. 250/-

Complimentary items that are served to all the diners -

Starter - Nachos With Mango Dip: These orange hued nachos were served immediately after seating. They arrived in a big cane bowl, whose bottom was covered with a circular banana leaf. Placed alongside, was a generous dip of mango salsa, served in a big ceramic spoon. Both the items were made in-house and tasted nice. Mango flavor was a nice twist to the usual salsa. The otherwise tanginess of tomato was well replaced by mango!

Palate Cleanser - Watermelon Cubes In Shot Glass: The cubes were seasoned with 'kala-khatta' type seasoning. This palate cleanser was served post the main course, to neutralize the taste buds, and prepare them for the dessert.

Mouth Freshener - Chocolate Paan: Four chocolate coated 'gundi paans' arrived in a rectangular ceramic tray. They were dusted with colored and sweetened fennels. Each paan had a toothpick inserted in it. The filling comprised of tutti fruity and gulkand. They tasted nice.

The crockery was mostly white ceramic, with the exception of the glasses. The glass used for serving water was in fact, made of stone! The salt and pepper holders were wooden. The hand bowl served at the end of the meal, was made of 'kachchi Mitti' or clay. It came with a red chequered 'gamchha' style napkin!

All in all, dining at Tamara was a pleasant surprise. It had the food quality of a five star hotel, the warmth of a stand alone restaurant, and last but not the least, the decor & ambiance was crisp, clean and beautifully themed.

What accounts for a good day?! Food that can pleasantly surprise your palate, of course! And that's exactly what you're about to get here! The Asian cuisine is perfect and a almost a blessing.. if you arrived hungry! If you're just planning to walk in and sit yourself on a weekend night, please remain informed that your turn may be uncertainly delayed! But, if you've used your phone wisely and called them for a reservation, you're on a roll! Oh, carry a sweater...at all times ..it will help! Even if it is sweltering, evaporating weather outside...Don't say I didn't warn you! The 
A/c's are turned freezingly low...you sure want to feel your fingers while lifting all that super yum food to your mouth, ain't it?! Kidding!! Ask them a favour, and they are happy to help! I went to dine here with the family and remember telling them that I can't eat much...well, that didn't work out so well! Because, we ended up ordering fare that could suffice the neighbourhood...what does one do when it's such good food! So, make a date with your loved ones...arrive at your seat, eat to your hearts' content!

Went there for lunch post pujo shopping a couple of days back. It is near to CC2 and we were "thirsty" after a gruelling class and long shopping session, so we opted to try it out. But we came to know that the lunch hours were over as it was well past 4 PM. The sullen look on our faces made the kindly staff arrange us dishes from their continental menu at their café just next to the restaurant. This amiable gesture made us so elated that we readily ordered some chilled beer to quench our thirst. Overlooking the drenched streets out of the frosty window and the soft music in background created an amazing ambience to soak in. We ordered penne pasta which came with red sauce and spaghetti. Along with that we had chicken in black bean sauce which came with mixed fried rice and mixed Hakka noodles. The pasta was titillating and we savored every bit of it. Chicken was tender and succulent and the sauce gave it a perfect company. The rice and noodles were okay. The wonderful geniality, great food and awesome ambience makes it a perfect hangout for a lazy afternoon to unwind, though I'm eager to try out the actual restaurant anytime sooner.

Went for a office team lunch on a September Monday. The quality of food, ambience will not dissapoint you. One of the best buffet in terms of quality and range of cuisine . The desert was an odessey with lots of items. Only con to me was the number of items in starter. 
PS: They provide you a chilled towel for refreshment as you walk in. Ah ! That was even better than the food.

It was my first visit to pipal tree. As soon as we got there they welcomed us and gave us facial towels for our refreshment. We ordered betki fry, chicken peshawari tikka, blue lagoon and lichi juice for starter, papad, pulav, grilled chicken for main course and hot gulab jamun, vanilla ice cream and home made kulfi for dessert. Grilled chicken, pulav and gulab jamun were the best. After starter they gave us khatta watermelon so that our tongue can sense the difference in taste between starter and main course. The ambience was great. Background music and the decoration added a new level to the food. Service was really quick. At last they gave is chocolate pan.

I had visited almost each and every restaurant of Kolkata that serves buffet, but this place stands top on the list as far as ambiance and decoration are concerned.
It was a team lunch with colleagues. We reached the venue at 12:10 pm but had to wait for a few minutes as buffet serving starts from 12:30 pm. A lady in saree took us to our table. The table was decorated with the natural marigold flower in ceramic pots & stone glasses to drink water. The arrangement had traditional seat covers will pillows all over. 

The waiter turned the upside down placed plates and unfolded handkerchief for us, then gave us hot fragranced towels to wipe our hand. Very much pleased with the attendents' courteous and patient attitude.
They had tandoori paneer and mixed veg fry on veg & chingri piyaji, chinese style chili fish & chicken tikka on non-veg as starters. We were not much overwhelmed with the starters as the spread was not big enough but the food tasted pretty authentic & good. 
Following that, we had some pretty creative salads on display like the mixed fruit salad pasta salad, mixed fruit salad, sprout salad, egg salad & dahi vada. The main course had the generic nonexclusive items. Also, all the chicken dishes had bones which we did not like. Mocktails are served unlimited.
The desserts division had some outstanding items like the kiwi chocolate mousse & fruit truffle which you will find nowhere along with phirni & assorted pastries. Moreover, they have this self-service ice cream counter where you can customize it in the weirdest way you want to as there was no attendant to disturb you :)
I shall recommend this to people who are looking forward to luxurious fine dining along with buffet. The best place to bring your loved one for a romantic date or for a family get-together.

I have visited this multi cuisine fine-dining restaurant couple of times on different occasions and I have tried variety of dishes there. To my amazement ,every dish was as delicious as it can be. I would recommend to try the lamb chops and Thai citrus chicken salad. 

They provide complementary mouth fresheners (fruit chopped in tiny pieces marinated in some juice) before you start your main course so that you can get the actual taste of those foods. And last but not the least, the chocolate pan which I absolutely enjoyed.

Also I should mention the quality of service, which was excellent.

Loved everything about this luxurious fine dining restaurant. The entry itself would let u know that this is a no-nonsense place. Everything about this place speaks about class. And such an Indian feel to it. Perfect for a date, for taking sm1 from outside Kolkata to impress them, for your foreigners friends or delegates for that amazing luxury Indian feel. Entry u see clay lamps and bells hanging on walls. And a beautiful saree clad lady takes u inside, and waiters are dressed in traditional attire. The roof has shamiana look to it. And the place smells amazingly of the essential oils. Every table has a scented candle burning. the glasses are made up of clay. The salt pepper shaker wooden. When you take your seat, they offer you fresh face towels. Then come house made nachos n dips (for free), and after you are done, chocolate coated pans (for free again). They don't take service charge. Food tastes good. Pinch in pocket 4/5. Hospitality at its best! Kudos

Tamara Pipal Tree hotel is on the first floor of the hotel pipal tree.  Visited there recently to celebrate my birthday.  
The ambience and decoration is very good. The place is quite suitable for team/group lunch too.  Foods were tasty but a few things forced me to rate it below 4.
Ambience :  4.5/5
Comfort : 4 /5 
Food: 3.5/ 5  
Cost : 3.5/5
Service: 2 / 5

The variety of foods they offer is not upto the mark compared to other buffet giants in the town. Main course and dessert had too limited options.  Few of the fish items were not well cooked.  Dessert had only 4 items. When you compare it with others,  it differs a lot. 
    Same thing applies to the service. They would hardly take care of anything.  Starters are also self-served.  I don't think enough attention was paid to the foods there.  Ice cream was almost melted in the pots.. But we had no one there to tell about it. Yet they seemed  pretty proactive while collecting the tips. It's not up to the mark of course. Hope they will improve soon.

This was on my wish list for a long time, and finally made it recently for dinner with a friend last week. 
I absolutely loved the ambiance with dim lighting, the comfortable, plush seating, the glass wall which gives an exterior city view, and the candle-light on the table sets up a perfect mood for anyone to have a brilliant conversation over food and drinks.
Next comes the service. Loved the concept of handing over fragrant wet towels for wiping our hands. Their gesture is worth mentioning, those people are well-behaved, soft-spoken, and helped us patiently with choosing what to order. The complimentary nachos served with mango salsa was so tasty! Also, we were served with watermelon in herbs before proceeding to the main course, to cleanse our palette.
Now comes the most important part, food! We loved each and everything we ate over there, and the portion size is quite filling. We ordered the "Seafood Platter" to start with and then in main course it was "Mongolian Hubei Chicken" and "Indonesian Chilli Garlic Noodles with Prawns". The seafood platter stood out among all. Everything starting from afghani mahi tikka, to bekti fingers and fried calamaris were just so mind blowing. The fried prawns were also great, but I found it to be a little bit extra oily, and did not suit my palette much. However, the prawn was soft and succulent inside the coating, which was superb to eat. We were so full by this time, we were unable to order any desserts sadly. Finally, the bill came with two "chocolate paan" for us, and that was a perfect finish to a terrific dinner.
I highly recommend this place to everyone, visit at least once while your stay in Kolkata. For me, I am sure I will visit Tamara again.

Been there for a buffet lunch in weekend. There options are soo huge that you will get your tummy filled before you try all of them. Though each item was not so delicious.
Their soup and bread was horrible! Masala kulcha was so sticky that one has to struggle to break it properly.
Apart from that veg and non veg items were quiet tasty. Thai, Indonesian items were also there. Starters were also delicious!
Ambiance: 4.5/5
Food: 4/5
Service:4/5
Cost to quality: 3.5/5
Over all it comes down to 4/5.

Ordered a lot of dishes can't remember the names... but some of them were awesome and some were just good... I thing l still remember is... their complimentary nachos with mango sala which they served between  our meals... that was excellent... pocket pinch was quite acceptable...

I visited this place on the day my brother's birthday. It located near CC2 - 1st Floor of Pipal Tree Hotel, Rajarhaat, Newtown.

Talking about the decor and ambience, just adjacent to the entrance you will find a Buddha Statue. The walls are decorated with designer off white tiles with some framed paintings. They have a canopy like structure in the ceiling and overall quite a decent decor and ambience.

Talking About food :-

For Starters we had :Home made Fuchka,Paneer cutlet,crispy baby corn,Manager devil,Fish pakora,Tandoori Chicken,Prawn cutlet,Fish pakora,Tandoori Alu, Though I didn't like the veg items that much but,the Non-veg items were very nice.

In the Main Course there were lots of items like Chicken hot & sour soup,Lemon coriander soup,Garlic bread,assorted bread, pasta,Egg salad,Bhindi fry,kadai paneer,Egg curry,mutton kassa, chili Fish,mixed noodle,plain rice.

Service :-

I would love to give them 5 points bcuz of their nice gesture towards their customers. Overall, it was a great experience to be there.

Thanks :)

Feels good when someone comes with the idea of lunch buffet other than BBQ Nation..
Today was one of these days someone came with the idea that we ll go to lunch buffet to Tamara.. we were so exited..
This place is well decorated, people are extremely helpful and the ambience is good..
Overall it is a very good package to see..
But to taste may not be very good choice..
Although the variety is widespread but somewhere it fails to meet the requirements of our tastebuds.. I m not saying the food was like hell but it was not like heaven either...

The restaurant is located near to the City Center 2 ,1st Floor of Pipal Tree Hotel in the New Town area.Starting from the Entrance ,the whole restaurant is very beautifully decorated.

I really dont have any idea, when this outlet started its business, but now if I have to take someone for a dinner or a lunch, Tamara will be among the top three. Food is good in many places, in and around Kolkata, but if you term Lunch / Dinner as a package, this place gives you one of the best package.
Located near CC2, you really dont have a parking issue, situated by the roadside on the 1st floor, you can have a glance to the speeding vehicles or have a dip in the bright sunlight devoid of its heat.
Now, as soon as you enter, you will be guided to a table to be seated. No sooner, you are seated, a wet towel will be there on the table to refreh yourself. Water is served in heavy granite glass which is again a spark. You will rarely find more courteous staff than those present here. You place your order and till you are served with, you will be gives snackers to keep your tastebuds busy. The chutney served with it is awesome. Similarly at the end, you will have a chcolate pan which again brings a smile on your face.
Now, if you are here for lunch and you are sure about your appetite, then close your eyes and go for the buffet. They also provide alcohol to make it even better. But alcohol is not complimentary. You may get a refreshment drink as a welcome drink. The food is awesome, I first gave the order then happened to see the menu. The staff are well aware about the dishes prepared and they perfectly guide you. The stand out dish till now i tasted is Daab Chingri prepared in continental style. I also loved the pork preprations. The buffet has also a variety of cuisine to chose from. The starters in the buffet are really good. But if you love your dessert more than the main course, Tamara can bring a broad smile on your face. They have an exotic range of dessert. Starting from misti doi and sweets, they have ice cream which you can customise according to your whims and fancies.
Well, the best meals can't be put into words..Tamara is such a place. Chuck all reviews, just go and experience, because here you dont eat, you experience. You dont sit for lunch or dinner, you sit for a journey which is always awesome.
Keep it up guys and keep serving such good food....!!

Visited this place for a buffet. The buffet is good,spread over,but a little clumsy. Starters were served at the table and rest was on display.
Starters: chicken tikka was served,but with bone,i prefer boneless,but that can be considered keeping the cost factor in mind. But what surprised me was the number of fried starters. There were almost 4 fried starters and that kills your appetite. The fish didn't taste good,so was the crispy vegetables,it was over crispy and I can feel oil into it. The panner was good but too much yellow in color. The tandoori Allo was really great to taste. The lamb and egg combination was something decisive. I can neither find a good taste of lamb,nor of the egg. And surprisingly there were three egf dishes on the buffet,salad,mains,and starters.
Mains:
The soups tasted good. The caneolloni looked great, but again the spinach I can feel was days old. The benarasi alloo was nicely stuffed. The lemon hinted steamed rice doesn't goes great with the Indian dishes,thr Thai curry was geeat,marvellous but o could only find aubergine into it. Would have expected to be rich in Oriental veggies. The grilled fish was the bang of the buffet. Beautiful mairantion,perfect balance of salt,it hit the Bulls eye. The biriyani was very dry,very very dry to taste. The chicken kasha was okay,but doesn't have the Bengali taste and color. The noodles was great and so was the pork.
Desserts:
The shahi tukra was disastrous. It was soaked in sweet syrup and was too toooo sweet. Infact when I tried to pick it up,it was getting broken. The brownie was good,but I would recommend some chocolate sauce on top and bake it a bit,would taste awesome. other desserts was also okay.
I really liked the ice cream bar with its condiments.
Felt little bit overcharged and overpriced. O would recommend to rather go for quality than looking into quantities.

Tamara...what a restuarant. Went for the first time and cant wait to go again. Top class ambience,food and service makes it a perfect place to dine. The staff being super courteous and helpful. Its just opposite city centre 2 , so locating it was not a problem. As we entered we found the place very chilled. So we asked them to adjust the AC and they perfectly did that. As we sit we are first given chilled scented towel napkins ..They then give you water in clay glasses. Then comes fried nachos with sweet mango salsa. (Its complimentary). We first ordered crispy babycorn and a veg platter and tomato soup. All the items were served super hot and everything was just so amazing. The quantity they serve is pretty filling too.
After the starters they serve you a pallette cleanser . Its watermelon and herb in a small glass. Quite refreshing. Then they serve you papad,pickles and onions.
We ordered masala kulcha, tandoori rotis and amristsari kulcha with a spicy mix veg. The kulchas were just out of the world. Piping hot loaded with lots of masala and super yum. Enjoyed every bite of it.
We ordered Bahamas too. Lychee and mint based mojito which was nice but not very chilled.
In the end they serve you their trademark chocolate pan which was again very unique and very tasty.
Overall an amazing experience and a fine dining experience. Thank you Tamara for making it memorable.

This one is labelled under romantic restaurants in Zomato and it's so apt. The candle-lit tables, the samiana decor, the romantic music just set the mood for you.

First of all they provided us with a house-made chips which was yummy enough. For starters we ordered, Crispy Calamari Pepper Salt and Murgh Tikka Peshawari. The calamari was crunchy and spicy and I lved it more than the chicken. Thereafter they gave us a pallete cleaner, something I have never seen before in so many other restaurants I have dined in (a kala khatta and anar juice) before the main course where we ordered for Bekti A La Diana. This is a two piece of fish dish with prawns inside and was the star of that night.

Must Must visit.

It was my second visit to Tamara, but this time at night. It was Sunday night, so we have to wait for 5-10 mins. But the candle lit interior was worthy to wait. The complimentary welcome appetiser, nachos with the spicy mango sauce was appreciable. 
We ordered Creamy Chicken  Sweet corn Soup, Crunchy Fried Bekti, Bekti Mediterranean with sautéed vegetables and Steam rice, Mixed Fried rice and Lat me Kai (Deep fried chilli chicken). All the dishes were good, specially the Mediterranean Bekti. After dinner complimentary Chocolate Paan made the ending perfect. 
You will obviously remember this place for it's beautiful and romantic  decoration.

What to say about this place? In a single word this place is "amazing"!! It's so cozy inside, all the staffs are very humble and the food is so fresh and great in taste! The main attraction is the candle light dinner arrangement! Visit this place either with your partner ir with your parents, am sure you all will love it!

I have been here for an office team lunch.It's a neat place on the Rajarhat Biswa Bangla Sarani, minutes away from the Haldiram's.My opinion on this fine dining restaurant that belongs to The Pipal Tree hotel is-

Food-I had gone for the buffet lunch.Starters cover quite a wide variety but the only item I really liked was the Pan-fried fish.Main Course was really really good.Especially the Grilled sea fish with Cilantro leaves,Reshmi chicken,and the Pork sausages were something to really look forward to.Desserts were satisfactory.

Ambience-The decor is average.The view of Rajarhat through the window panes may work for a romatic dine-out.Seating is comfortable.

I made an unplanned visit to Tamara late Sunday night. The ambience of this restaurant is just amazing, with candlelight. We had chicken clear soup, which they prepared for us, even when it wasn't a part of their menu. We had grilled bhetki sizzler in main course and it was as good as it can get. The complimentary nachos and chocolate pan were also fabulous. Service was great even late at night, it was 10 30 when we had entered the restaurant. Location and parking facility is also convenient. I would definitely revisit tamara!

Went for a Team Lunch on a weekday. It is very near to Chinar park crossing.  Ambiance is good,  impressive decor. Smart, courteous, welcoming staff.
 Menu ranges from Continental, Chinese, Tandoori, Coastal cuisine, which is very impressive. Service was excellent.
Coming to their food, The buffet options were less  so we go for à la carte. Starters were okay. They serve a palate cleanser before starting your main course, this is unique :-)
  food is really costly here comparing to quality and quantity they serve. Loved their chocolate pan. To be honest It was the best among everything :-). My overall verdict is Tamara is an expensive restaurant. Have a visit and Happy Eating!!!

I personally do not like that inner decor that much but i loved their unique style stone drinking water glass which reminds me of my ancestors time.
Coming to the food,we went for buffet,which was great at per the cost.starters,maincourse were normal like other places but mention worthy is they serves phuchka in starters and misti doi in desert,both are bengalis hot favorite.
Overall its a good place,economic place and good food on plate. Have a visit and enjoy your day.

It's located near to the City Center 2, to be precise it is nearly just diagonally opposite! Ambiance is nice. The starters and the soup in the buffet were a big let down. The options were less and the quality was pretty mediocre too. Crispy fried chicken was the only thing that was eatable. Just had a sip of the soup from my friend's soup bowl and it was too flat, and for that reason you'll find the soup spoon on my plate as I didn't take a portion of it. :P.  Main course was good, specially the Green Pepper Chicken and the Biriyani. Chicken served was succulent. The desserts were just simply great which made up the low quality and bit tasteless starters served. One of the items had a base of chocolate sauce and then some "Mishti Doi" (sweet curd) over it and some more Radbi and chocolate sticks on top. That was just heavenly. The gulab jamuns and apple cakes were nicely made too.

The only problem. They serve buffet only in lunch. And no alchohol served then. 2 changes and this can be one of the famous places in town. Keep the good work on.

Even though the price is a bit on a higher side but the food quality and service is top notch. They provide you with complementary nachos and dip while you wait for your food to be prepared. Pocket Pinch: Rs.1500 for a couple.

Boy this place is so much in style and coming to the food , we went for the buffet and trust me they don't stuff you with useless kababs and all before the main course..there are lovely mouth watering appetisers in the buffet and all are quite unique also was surprised to see fuchka or as some people may call it Golgappa.. Coming to the main course they have authentic dishes,and very delicious items on the menu,trust me.. The presentation was outstanding and so is the food..

The food of Tamara is quite good.  Even the ambience of the restaurant is pretty impressive, specially in night time. The song is quite soothing on our dinner time. But the one which I am not at all impressed is the service, which was quite slow. Disappointed with the way they work. They don't have a proper communication with each other. One person take order. Even at the time of checking out bill it's pretty slow process. 
Because of this I rated 3.5. Hope by this they will provide fast service, which is very essential for the running restaurant.

2 days ago, we visited this place on the eve of our Marriage Anniversary. This is the place, worth of visiting again and again if you wish to spend a very romantic and memorable time with your partner with a candlelight dinner.
The Restaurant is in the first floor of Pipal Tree Hotel. This is on the Major road nearby Chinar Park. The views from the window tables are awesome. 

Let’s come to the service of the Restaurant. First greetings by the receptionist and it will be followed by their courteous staffs and waiters. They are very much attentive to each and every table. The restaurant was almost half-full when we were there . No idea how their service would have been if all tables were full. Their complimentary homemade nachos, Chocolate-Paan after the dinner was really delicious. 

Now come to the foremost point I am still overwhelmed with. We ordered 1 Italian Fist Picatta in starter, 1 Bharwan Tangri Gulmohor, 1 Italian Dark Chocolate Mud Pie with Vanilla Icecream. Let's start with the starter , Italian Fish Picatta with carlsberg beer. All of them escalated our feelings and gave us real taste & flavor of italian food. Quantity is good with almost 8 pieces of fish picatta. This was not spicy but nicely creamy. Our main menu was Bharwan Tangri Gulmohor which was served in a sizzler hot plate with smoke coming out of it while served. That's the best part of their dishes. This Tangri Gulmohor was nicely made. it was delivered with 4 big stuffed chicken drumsticks, salads and dips. Our desert was Italian Dark Chocolate Mud Pie and this was made with pure chocolate what tasted awesome. 

Bill was 1750 Rs for two people ( 1 Italian Fist Picatta in starter, 1 Bharwan Tangri Gulmohor, 1 Italian Dark Chocolate Mud Pie with Vanilla Icecream and two pints of Carlsberg beer), much less than our satisfaction.

I would like to start by saying that the ambience is so amazing! One should definitely go for dinner to enjoy it's beautiful decor. Plz book a table from before as its very full in the weekends and you may have to wait if you go without a prior booking. They place a fishbowl with a live fish on your table which is a new concept. The staff is courteous and prompt. We ordered deep fried chilli chicken and crunchy fried betki for starters; classic postman's grilled fish for main course and the chocolate and hazelnut samosa for dessert. All the dishes were good. I would definitely recommend it.

Even at the time of checking out bill it's pretty slow process. 
Because of this I rated 3.5. Hope by this they will provide fast service, which is very essential for the running restaurant.

2 days ago, we visited this place on the eve of our Marriage Anniversary. This is the place, worth of visiting again and again if you wish to spend a very romantic and memorable time with your partner with a candlelight dinner.
The Restaurant is in the first floor of Pipal Tree Hotel. This is on the Major road nearby Chinar Park. The views from the window tables are awesome. 

Let’s come to the service of the Restaurant. First greetings by the receptionist and it will be followed by their courteous staffs and waiters. They are very much attentive to each and every table. The restaurant was almost half-full when we were there . No idea how their service would have been if all tables were full. Their complimentary homemade nachos, Chocolate-Paan after the dinner was really delicious. 

Now come to the foremost point I am still overwhelmed with. We ordered 1 Italian Fist Picatta in starter, 1 Bharwan Tangri Gulmohor, 1 Italian Dark Chocolate Mud Pie with Vanilla Icecream. Let's start with the starter , Italian Fish Picatta with carlsberg beer. All of them escalated our feelings and gave us real taste & flavor of italian food. Quantity is good with almost 8 pieces of fish picatta. This was not spicy but nicely creamy. Our main menu was Bharwan Tangri Gulmohor which was served in a sizzler hot plate with smoke coming out of it while served. That's the best part of their dishes. This Tangri Gulmohor was nicely made. it was delivered with 4 big stuffed chicken drumsticks, salads and dips. Our desert was Italian Dark Chocolate Mud Pie and this was made with pure chocolate what tasted awesome. 

Bill was 1750 Rs for two people ( 1 Italian Fist Picatta in starter, 1 Bharwan Tangri Gulmohor, 1 Italian Dark Chocolate Mud Pie with Vanilla Icecream and two pints of Carlsberg beer), much less than our satisfaction.

I would like to start by saying that the ambience is so amazing! One should definitely go for dinner to enjoy it's beautiful decor. Plz book a table from before as its very full in the weekends and you may have to wait if you go without a prior booking. They place a fishbowl with a live fish on your table which is a new concept. The staff is courteous and prompt. We ordered deep fried chilli chicken and crunchy fried betki for starters; classic postman's grilled fish for main course and the chocolate and hazelnut samosa for dessert. All the dishes were good. I would definitely recommend it.

Visited yesterday for dinner. The decor was good. The staff were very attaintive. We ordered chicken chilli nuggets with mango salsa as a starter. It was awesome. I liked the complementary home made chips. For the main course, we ordered char grilled chicken. Quantity was good, taste was good but not excellent. We ordered moonwalk and wrong selection and the bar tender did justice with the cocktails. The main charm was the choclate paan they served with the bill. I must say that the paan was awesome. Overall a nice experience.

I have visited Tamara again in last week-end. It was my second visit after I visited first on Valentine's Day, this year. Me and my husband went to CC2 for a movie, so when decided to console our belly with some delicious food, we have mutually agreed to step in Tamara. The decor and ambiance is good, specially the Buddha statue at the entrance gives a feel good factor. Food ordered was undoubtedly delicious in taste. You will surely have a good time here. Only thing, they need to do something with the pricing. I felt it is at little higher side. Overall good experience.

I visited this place last Friday with my group of friends. It located near CC2 - 1st Floor of Pipal Tree Hotel, Rajarhaat, Newtown.

Talking about the decor and ambience, just adjacent to the entrance you will find a Buddha Statue. The walls are decorated with designer off white tiles with some framed paintings. They have a canopy like structure in the ceiling and overall quite a decent decor and ambience.

The staffs looks smart with women in sarees draped in a unique style.

They serve nachos with mango salsa while you wait for your starters which is very good.

Appetizer: 
Golden Fried Prawn served with Garlic Sauce - This is ok.
Murgh Tikka Peshawari - This is quite good.

They serve you a palate cleanser before starting your main course - watermelon served in some sauce.

Sichuan Fried Rice - Mixed - nothing special to mention. quantity is ok and also tastes good.
Mongolian Hubei Chicken - Didnt like this dish that much
Tandoori Roti
Butter Nan
Afghani Murgh Bhartha - This gravy dish of chicken goes very well with bread.

Papads and Onion Salad is complimentary.

And a special mention for the Chocolate Pan which is again complimentary as desert and is awesome.

Will look forward to my next visit.

This is one of those places that suits for any ocassion, at any time. Simply speaking the interiors are very lush and give you that feel of luxury. (Made me give an extra point ;) The vg main course is not really up to the mark, and in the end Starters initiate the rescue which was concluded by the desserts section. Adventures might be rewarded if you give leverage to your taste buds. Worth a go.

Currently one of the most courting-friendly restaurants in town, Tamara, near Chinar Park (read: Naopara), is to me, the Mocambo of Rajarhat. The interiors reek of romance; you know, the drapes, the floating candles, dimmed lighting, etc. The food's fantastic too; being a frequenter, I can say that their food quality is up there with some of the best restaurants in town. The last time I went I had a fish appetiser; a fusion of the Kebab and the Sizzler. It was one of the best fish dishes I've had in a long time. But then, that's not all there's to it. The staff are courteous and helpful, too. So, as far as my ratings go:
Food: 8.5/10
Ambiance: 9.9/10
Service: 9.5/10
Pricing: 8/10
Looking forward to another amazing meal soon enough.

I went there for my birthday dinner and I must say it was a great experience. The ambience is awesome, with candlelights and a good view of the street below. They have a huge 'shamiyana' overhead that gives you a luxurious feel. Coming to the service, the servers were warm and courteous. They greeted us in a very warm manner and served us very well and also asked for our feedback of the food. However, the food was not that convincing. We ordered Murgh Peshawari tikka, mixed fried rice and Mongolian hubei chicken. The murgh tikka was very good, but the rest was pretty bland. They did serve us with a complementary plate of nachos with mango salsa, which was pretty good. The chocolate paan at the end of the meal was delicious. And, pocket pinch was not that high, given the overall service and ambience of the place. Overall, a highly recommended place to visit with your loved ones.

P.S. They have a lunch buffet. Would love to try it.

Very nice and soothing ambience. It gives the impression of you having a candle light dinner. It at least ensures that you start with a smile in your face. Next thing you notice is the service - amazing! The staff are very courteous. And to top it all, Food is good as well - if you prefer continental or Chinese. Pricing is just about ok. And the icing on the cake was the chocolate paan that was served after food. It was different and nice. Overall a must try.

Situated in Newtown. The restaurant boasts of a nice decor and ambience. A great option for fine dining if budget is not a factor. The preparations are also grt nd i felt their USP is their 'Chocolate Paan', paan coated with chocolate which they serve after dinner is great nd unique. The only negative point is the waiting time, the waiting time can sometimes go upto 1.5 hrs.. Otherwise a fantastic place to dine in with your loved ones

I cannot start this review without first appreciating our charismatic server, who was extremely courteous and well-informed. Thanks to his suggestions, we managed to quickly evaluate our menu selections. Once this was done, we were provided with a crunchy complimentary appetizer with mango salsa. Quite soon, our Bhetki Fish was laid on the table. The fish was quite good and made us look forward to the mains. 

Before our main course arrived, we were provided with the complimentary Watermelon Kala-khatta Shot which I found to be quite refreshing. The Chelo Platter consisted of butter rice, sunny side up (eggs), a grilled tomato, crispy potatoes, green salad, malai chicken, mutton seekh kababs and a shot that tasted very similar to kachumber. It was absolutely drool worthy and I simply loved each item of my platter. The food was filling and could be easily shared by two people. Last but not the least, we were provided with complimentary Chocolate Paan to finish our meal with. It was a heady combination of paan coated in chocolate and I, a chocoholic, couldn’t have asked for better.  

To summarize, I would like to reiterate that Tamara is the perfect place for enjoying a quiet evening with loved ones. Everything from the décor, the ceiling, the candlelit tables, the room fragrance, and most importantly, the good food and the courteous staff, contribute to the charm that is Tamara.

Having heard a lot about this place, I felt it more hype than reality. Had been there for a family dinner. Restaurant is too dimly-lit for my liking. Food was tasty but the initial mouthful of chicken fry felt like there were plenty of sandy particles. There was no way to check out or complain in the dim light conditions. Henceforth I would be wary of any restaurant which is so dimly lit.

I went there on Thursday..
Situated near CC2..
If u r looking for a different buffet other than full of kebabs then this place is for u.. Variety and soo many different options are their speciality..
I took buffet lunch there..
It is one of the best looking restaurant..
Entrance and the whole restaurant is very beautifully decorated.. It's soo colourful.. I just loved it.. Ambiance was very good..
Staffs were well behaved and very helpful..

First of all they served aam panna as well come drink..
Then the fuchka .. who doesn't like fuchka!!..
Then one by one  tikia, murshidabadi prawn piaji, veg chese cutlet, mutton cutlet, dry chilli chicken with bone, chilli fish, veg spring roll made my day.. Though I didn't like veg items that much Non veg items were very nice..

In main course there were lots of items like soup, paasta, dahibada, mixed noodle, plain rice, breads, veg paneer, alur dum, methi daal, chicken, fish in lamon flavour, pork sausage, mutton reganjosh and many more.. 

NOw come to the desert section ..
They served 1 f the best desert menu..
Sahi tukra, odissa special 6ana pora, misti doi, fruit triffle (simply awsome), white forest pestry, mouse and lots of others.. 5kinds of ice cream..

cost for 2 was 1441..

It just made my day..

I visited tamara again just a month ego.. but this time they had less options in starter and almost same menu in main course..  desert options didn't satisfy me like before.. a bit disappointed..
 but loved soup n pasta..

Located near City Center 2, the restaurant Tamara is worth visiting. Situated on the main road, it is very easy to locate. Visited the place on a Friday noon for a team lunch. We opted for the Non Veg Buffet. Starting with Aam panna which was luscious to the mouth we had Sabzi Galauti Kabab, Pan Fried Hakka Chilly Fish. Both the items were really good. Though the

Chicken Kabab was average in taste.The taste was not consistent throughout. The first serving of the kebabs weren't sufficiently salted and the next serving was excessively salted. Murshidabadi Chingri Piyaji was new and good and Egg Mayonnaise Salad was also good.

Coming to the main course which had Fried Rice, Mixed Noodles was average in taste. Pork Sausages was a big letdown.

But Shahi Tukra was good. Last but not the least the dessert part was good. Ice cream was good with a variety of toppings. But the ice cream wasn't properly freezed as a result it was a bit awkward to eat. The staff were less friendly and cold drinks though served unlimited was diluted.

I visited this place a month back.
The décor is quite nice and looks different than other restaurants in town.The staffs are also very polite and courteous.

But I am not that impressed with the food.They had plenty of options but none of them stood out for me.Those were tested very common and there was not any item which really tested different..
There are many other better place than this one with better taste and quality of same type.
So unless they bring any changes any their menu options or improves the taste it will be difficult for them to go on.
So unless some one is very fond of good décor and nice ambience rather than the food,this is not a option to go for.

Food Taste: 7.5/10

Value for Money: 8/10

Ambiance: 7.5/10

Variety: 10/10

Tried out this joint as a venue for a Team Lunch on a weekday. The Buffet menu is impressive in it's variety. From Classic Continental to Chinese via Tandoor and Coastal cuisine, it pretty much covers everything you could be looking for in an extensive spread.

Enjoyed the starters in particular. The welcome drinks and "Puchka/Panipuri/Golgappa" served at the tables were a nice touch too.

The main courses in particular were comparatively less impressive, though certainly adequate from any perspective.

Finally, the dessert. It would be worth it to go back just for this. A superbly stocked make your own Sundae bar, Tukda, Pudding, Brownies, Dahi... you name it, they had it.

All in all, a choice destination for a worthwhile buffet.

3 things you surely require in order to have 360° experience of a 'good-food-hoot' - awesome company, good ambience and ofcourse good food.
Recently I went at Tamara with hopes up, hearing such praises. I was only sure of the 1st thing of  a 'good-food-hoot' :)
The place did keep its flag high. Awesome ambience and good food completed the circle.
Be it family outing or small party (non-booze) or just some friends' hang out, I recommend this place. (N.B. try to go in the evening, feels more awesome for it's decor.)
Hope to return there soon.

A Place wanted try for long time, finally visited them on a Saturday for Lunch.but very much disappointed by their behaviour on the first place.It's recommended to book the seat so I called them up a day before they said they were fully book for the next day so they wont be able to accommodate us.but all of a sudden they asked for my no & said they would try to adjust so I said ok. they call me up a few minutes later & said I have to come by 12 sharp & leave by 2:30 as it is the first hour and that they will be fully packed. so I said I could be thereby 1 o'clock but they said they wont be able to do so,To my surprise when I checked Zomato for there buffet timing it was 12-3 so I did not got why they forced us to come by 12 as no one can finish the food in half hour.but still as they requested we went there by 12 sharp they were not even opened they had a booking for 5 people still kept on asking how many people are there.they said to wait although didn't even point out where should we seat it was really bad service.Coming to ambience it has a nice Tibetan touch. I found their Earthen glass very nice touch.coming to the food I would just point out their cons 1st in starters their Paneer tikka lacked seasoning, Chicken sweet corn soup was bit over sweet,in main course the spinach ricotta was really bad it was stale hopefully as it gave out a bad smell. In dessert their pudding was the worst again it was bitter like any thing soup over sweet & and desserts bitter that's a rear sight.so over all its nice place to try the other foods they serve. But for me this is a one timer for their poor service.

We went on 4th April. Nice ambience. But quality of food is pathetic. We ordered a chicken bharta and dal. Dal was ok but chicken bharta was utterly rubbish. Moreover the stewards were also not upto the mark and pricing was prohibitive. Pl check before you visit.

Coming to food, it was fantastic, the quality and taste were just speechless.I loved every dishes which we ordered specially the butter chicken as He is from Punjab.we loved the dessert and the chocolate pan lastly.Ambience was also very nice with a nice soothing music playing.
The staffs were also good, humble, polite, patience and very much helpful.

This place looks pretty appealing from outside and when i got an awesome offer on nearbuy did not think twice before buying it. The menu seemed very good and we went in there at around 12 30. The ambience is pretty good and the staff is courteous but it is a bit difficult to get their attention. Although the mocktails are unlimited you have to ask the staff for a refill. The starters were good and that is almost it. One thing I did not like is the 'prawn piyaji',which was below average. The soup I must say is one of the best from their spread. Main course is something you should be very selective about,if not avoid. The lemon rice was just plain rice with some lemon grass on top and i dont know how they messed up something like mixed hakka noodles. 
Deserts have a few options but some of them were real good. 

P.s. the phuckha they provide are really tasty and the dahi vada tasted good. Keep away from the main course as far as possible.

Exquisite place for a buffet! I have been to this place in an office party. A wild lot of variations in food. Its a place for the foodies! The food was aw sum, plating was perfect good visual appeal, seasoning was on the fire! Perfect ambiance and very good conduct. Customer service was over whelming. Over all, flawless! A perfect 5 is really hard to earn. But you did it. I would like to recommend the Thai cuisine, pork belly do try it out. Also the desserts (its stunning with variations and customization, in fact its a full table of various desserts). If you start tasting all the foods they plated you will be full before reaching the end (honestly). I will surely visit this place again for an amazing lunch.

Visited Tamara a few days ago for Lunch. The ambience is quite good and you find mostly office going people here due to its location. Coming to the food, nothing too special about the starters. They have a make your own chaat counter. They also serve fuchka and dahi bada. In the main course section, the pork sausages and the hunan chicken was quite tasty. They have a Sundae counter. The deserts could have been better. The staff was quite friendly and the service was quick.

Can't imagine anything else apart from the good looking interiors. Can't praise as well write much about the food. Definitely not in the mainstream foodie joint one should visit on a weekend. Apt for a quick office lunch and stop-gap joint. The chicken served in the buffet was lesser in taste than the Dalhousie street food. I found the Pork was the only item in the entire buffet to be aptly cooked. The dessert collection is hilarious too.

Overall ~ One and last time visit

So after a long wait I visited Tamara-The Pipal Tree.. Located just on the opposite of city centre 2, in the first floor of the building.
So we went in, and the first thing to catch our attention was the decoration, the nicely made chairs and the ceiling.. We were informed about the buffet, which I was already well aware of, thanx to zomato and the rates are 599+tax which comes around to 720.
Now coming to the food (non-veg buffet lunch)
At first thr is soup, with quite a number of varities of bread, next comes the starter comprising of paneer tikka, a pan fried kind of fish which tastes awesome, prawn pakora(not so good), chicken tandoori & mutton chops ( both needs to be better, the masala in chicken tandoori is overdone), they serve you phuchka in your table which tastes fantastic!! The drinks are unlimited too, which is a plus point, they serve aam panna generally, but on asking they provided coke. You'll find a chat counter, where you have to make your own chat( I was too full, and couldn' taste the chat, but it looked delicious) they have a pasta counter also, moving on to main course we found a fish item, which was not so good, an egg curry, rice, mutton, and you can ask for rotis they'll serve it on your table.. The best thing was the dessert counter, it had shahi tukra, chena pora, mishti doi, fruit custard(didn' like at all, tasted bitter), black forest cake, and the mind blowing ice cream counter which had almost everything!!! Overall i was satisfied with tamara, and would like to revisit surely, but they should try and improve the starters a bit, and rest everything is great :)  For a pocket pinch of 700 you'll have both your stomach and heart satified.

Tamara, a multi cuisine restaurant is situated in the first floor of Pipal Tree Hotel,  which is at a 5 mins walking distance from City Centre 2. It is very conveniently located on the Major Arterial Road, and can transport that can get you to City Centre 2, can also drop you near Pipal Tree Hotel. 
*AMBIENCE*
Well, the placement of this restaurant in the first floor of the hotel, truly deserves appreciation. As soon as you enter the restaurant, you get to see an idol of Lord Ganesha, with some 'shloks' engraved on the wall. There are diyas and candles lit outside as well as inside the restaurant, which altogether gives an earthly feel to the entire atmosphere. Every dining table has candles placed on it, which gives you a candlelight dining experience, which makes it perfect for an exquisite date. A soft raga plays in the background, which accentuates the 'Shamiana' feel. The attire of the staff blended in with the ambience.
*SEATING ARRANGEMENT*
We were there for Dinner, and we got to see roughly 10 dining tables, 32 seats being present. it isnt very spacious and at the same time, not overcrowded. On one side of the restaurant, were large glass exteriors, overlooking the main road. I was seated in one of the seats and the look was awesome.
*FOOD*
The place had a rural feel with a touch of modernisation. The cutlery consisted of earthenware glasses, and the table had jute mats placed as placemats.  The dishes were of pristine white glass and other crockery were of steel.
While we placed our order and waited for the same, we were served with complimentary masala papad and chutney. The combination was yummy.
For starters, we had ordered, Italian Fish Picatta and Lemon Grass Chicken Wings.
Italian Fish Picatta, is a preparation of bekti garnished with sliced French Fries(what we bengalis call 'Jhoori Alu Bhaja'), served with Salad. The preparation was mostly like a Bekti Pakora and was terrifically tasty.
Lemon Grass Chicken Wings, is a thai preparation, was very delightful to taste. There were some 7-8 pieces of small chicken pieces with bones. The Chicken was cooked properly and was soft to taste. When we waited for our main course to be served, we were provided with watermelon shots, which was an additional offering.
For the main course, we ordered a plateful of Italian Chicken Cacciatora, which was served with Steamed Rice, Orange and Chilli Glazed Broccolli. The dish was not very spicy, and had a western touch to it, as expected. The Chicken was super soft and melted down the throat. The dish truly satisfied my taste buds.
For the dessert section, we ordered Warm Gulab Jamun with homemade Kulfi. The Gulab Jamun was not out of the ordinary and tasted quite like others. The Kulfi was served in a small pot('matka') and was covered with a small piece of cloth. A small scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream was also present alongwith the Gulab Jamun and kulfi. It was toothsome.
At the end, they provided us complimentary chocolate paan for a sweet ending.
*STAFF BEHAVIOUR*
The staff was overtly courteous and helped us in choosing the items, as we were quite confused which dishes to order. 
*PRICE*
Tamara is a bit expensive restaurant, and when you visit it for dinner, be ready to shell out 1000 bucks for a single person for a proper meal. But then the food is worth it.
Happy Eating!!! :-)

Visited Tamara today afternoon for Lunch. They had a good spread in Buffet.

Pudina Jaljeera was served in Mocktail. It was a right mix.

Paneer Tikka, Tandoori Aloo, Crispy Vegetables were served on table for Starters. Crispy Vegetables was crisp and the Lunch started well.

 But Pani Poori served just after straters was disappointing. 

Papri Chat, Fruit Salad, Dahi Vada, Pasta Salad were in veg salad counter.

Main Course was Average.

Desserts had many options but nothing much appealing except for their make your own Sundae counter.

Ambience was good and service too.

Stepping into the restaurant after crossing a dark passage we found an amazing decor, peaceful ambience , glass walls and a perfectly candle-lit atmosphere..we were mesmerized by the interiors.. Staff was courteous ,friendly and nicely dressed. The water glasses were wooden, which took my attention as i found them to be matching with  the theme. Coming to the food, the menu is so big that it becomes difficult to decide what to eat. We had ordered Sikandari Shaslik with achari dip-this dish was absolutely amazing and was a treat to taste buds as the paneer was just perfectly cooked and juicy from the inside and crunchy on the outside.I loved it. Next we ordered sphagetti tetrazini noodles.This dish was not so good as it was loaded heavily with white sauce and cheese and filled my stomach fast after which we could not eat other dishes.For a one time try the dish  was good.
The chocolate paan which they served at the end as mouth freshener  was so one of its kind!  
Service time was a bit more but the wait was worth it. 

I rated it 0.5 less for the sphagetti,otherwise this place is a big hit! 
Would love to visit this place again to explore the big menu.

Beautiful interior, peaceful ambiance, courteous hosts and quality food: all these sum up the great experience we had at Tamara, Pipal tree. We went for our team lunch and opted the lunch buffet on a Thursday afternoon. The welcome drink and phoochkas served at table were a delightful surprise. A wide spread of both veg and non veg starters and salads were there. Special mention for the egg salad , dahi vada and chingri r peyaji. There was a chat counter also. The main course had many veg items but didn't tried them. But non veg main course items were not so upto the mark. Only the noodles and a fish preparation was worth mentioning. The desert section deserved a special mention with lovely mishti doi, sinful shahi tukda and many other items with six types of ice creams in a different counter. 
Overall an affair to remember.

Tamara is located on the first floor in the pipal tree hotel near chinar park and opposite to city centre 2. We went there for a buffet lunch. The ambience was excellent. The staffs were welcomed us with smiling face. They gave us a towel to clean our hands.
Coming to the food, The buffet spread was nice. They served aam paana as welcome drinks which was good. In starter they had three veg and four nonveg starter. Veg starter contains Ajwani paneer Tikka which was really tasty, Tandoori aloo - taste average and a vegetable starter - not tried. In nonveg starter they had chicken kebab(named bhatti ka murgh) which was good but it contains bone. They also had Mutton cutlet, chingrir peyaji and crispy chilly fish, all were good. They also had variety of salad, Dahi vada and chat counter. Dahi vada was really tasty. In main course, They had Lemon scented Rice and Noodles with chicken, Mutton, Fish, Pork, paneer and some other veg dishes. The main course was just average. They also served phuchka in starters.
The Dessert section needs a special mention.
There were shahi tudka, black forest pastry, chanapoda, bread pudding, Mixed fruit Truffle, misti doi. All were excellent in taste. Along with that they also had a ice cream bar, which contains 6 types of ice cream with toppings and cones. 
The buffet was really excellent. Only the main course needs a little improvement. Otherwise outstanding.

Tamara-Pipal Tree Hotel is a female given name most commonly derived from the Biblical name "Tamar", meaning date palm tree.. So here i was at Rajarhats Tamara.. Leme get started:
The Ambience: So as one enters theres dark passage and candlelit adorned wall.. And theres light! Entering the restaurant theres this mantra on the wall and when one is seated theres canopies all over the ceiling! I found it cute.. Perfect dating spot.. Book your dinner date!
Next up is Food: We ordered:
Crispy Chilli Babycorn: Twas crispy but then the sauces were ok.. I prefer lil saucier!
Mushroom a la gregue: This dish was a stunner.. Loved the mushroom and crispy bread which was served with it.. Must try it!
Just when we ordered our Indian meal the staff served us mouth refreshing watermelon dipped in kala khata syrup.. Refreshing our taste palates!
Aloo Achari Style: This was stuffed aloo with gravy.. I dint quite like the flavors.. Needs more better flavours in stuffing..
Kaali Daal: Daal was nice.. Liked it
Naan: Just a normal bread
Finally they serve Chocolate Paan as mouth freshner and its different..
Lastly, The Staff and Pocket Pinch: The staff are very friendly.. Quick and pays attention to the customers! The pocket pinch is nominal.. Must try this place and you will be amazed at perfect atmosphere with goood food.. 
Leme know your thoughts on Tamara.. Waiting for your comments!! :D

A very nice place to dine. Decor is OK, food is awesome with a lot of varieties. And the staffs hospitality is top notch. Dining was a memorable experience here. We had BBQ pork belly and Mexican Lamb Fajitas.
The waiters served refreshments between starters and main dishes. Also a chocolate Pan in the end.

Add a bar and would rate this 5/5.

So after a failed attempt on Valentine's day (failed because it was extremely crowded and we were stupid enough to not make reservations) we decided to give the place another shot on the 1st of March (being his birthday). 
The first thing that'll attract your attention are the interiors. Every table lighted with a candle and the ceiling adorned by white drapery and soothing instrumentals- it's a complete experience! Next when you are seated they'll give you wet towels doused in eau de Cologne so that you can freshen up and get ready for the meal.
We ordered pan fried fish, lat me kai chilli chicken and fresh lime soda for starters. While we waited, we were gifted with a bowl of crisps with mango salsa as appetizers- A nice gesture to keep the conversation flowing while we waited for the food to arrive.
The pan fried fish was awesome..crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and coated nicely with a flavorful sauce that had the right amount of sweet and spiciness to it! The chicken was nothing extraordinary.
Next we proceeded towards the mains. Here we thought we will go for a continental dish,so we chose grilled chicken served with cheesy mashed potatoes and mushroom red wine sauce. While the mashed potatoes were out of this world heavenly, the chicken steak could have been better.
We ordered hot gulab Jamun with home made kulfi for dessert. But the sad part was that the kulfi turned out to be kulfi ice-cream - the one that gets served in an earthen pot with a cloth covering( you cannot trick a foodie on this one tamara) This was the most disappointing part of the otherwise good experience. 
Finally the chocolate paan was sort of a saving grace! 
However the whole experience was nevertheless very good. This has to be the best restaurant in this area!

It is our favourite restaurant in Rajarhat area.The ambience is great-the dim light inside,the view of rajarhat expressway at night,cosy table with candle lit on it,will necessarily bring out your romantic self.Add great quality food and heart winning hospitality to that-anyone will be floored.Loved the complimentary salsa with mango chutney at the beginning and the chocolate pan in the end-nice touch indeed.We are still trying out the various dishes on the offer as the menu is quite exhaustive and multiple visits are necessary to taste them all and nobody is complaining..

Hello My zomato users and fellow followers.  Everyone knows that Bar-B-Ques is my favourite Restro to have North Indian food and I'm a vegan and how much I'm into typical North Indian Cuisine with the flavours of indian spices. Yesterday it was Cray day as it was my Mom and Dad anniversary so after a long fun day celebration I Decided to take everyone to this place Tamara about which I heard from so many Friends.  Tamara is a Restaurant in The Pipal Tree hotel on the First floor. First thing at the entrance we saw Dark scenes wall with Candles and amazing statue of Lord buddha with a Mantra written on wall. Ambience was soo cozy and lovely for the amazing night with family.  We started with appetisers and soups following main Course. Ordered Vegetable soup and tomato soup which were creamy and delish.  The tamara's Kebabs & Appetizers Platter (V) as a starter which had 4items was Crispy, specially I loved aloo and dahi ke. We were 7 people so we ordered Paneer Lababdar, Kadhai Hare Sabji, Yellow Methi Dal, Tamara's Slow Cooked Dal Makhani, Butter Nan and Masala Kulcha. Dal Makhani and panner Lababdar was delicious paneer was soft and the Hare Sabji was good mixed with so many veggies. After soup they served minty Watermelon in a small glass which was attractive. After we had our dinner which was swerved gracefully we ordered for bill and with it they served pan dipped in choclate layer.  Like how can they be so pampering with perfect serving staff. They gave us complimentary Piece of cake as I asked them I was ready to pay but they did't charged how sweet of them. Seeing such an amazing staff and food I would like to go again and again.  I'll give 4.5 to this amazing place. Must go

It is possibly the most happening restaurant in the city since its inception, and the listing of Tamara in every alternate Zomato collection shoved us in our hunger boots and we were on our table for lunch. 

The ambiance was really impressive. From the plush velvet-coated seats to the royal decor of the ceiling, from the big stone glasses to the beautiful marigold on the table - everything looked lovely as ever. Truly romantic.

Moving on to the buffet, skipping the soup altogether, we grabbed our plates for the big platter of starters. Some really good CHICKEN TANDOORI and Chinese fish starter filled our plates alongside the DELICIOUS CRISPY CHILLY VEGETABLES and TANDOORI ALOO. A huge spread of pasta, salads and snacks like DAHI VADA and PAPRI CHAAT were there as well, and were awesome! Midway through the starters, a plate of PHUCHKA was served on the table. Now it's not just to expect the street taste of the all time favorite dish, but stuffing the shell with mashed potatoes and having it with the tamarind water was definitely an experience you wouldn't want to miss. 

The main course was somewhat passable, with the non-vegetarian options being too limited and the items were out of place (chicken noodles, hunan chicken, a Chinese fish preparation and suddenly Kerala egg curry?)
Taste wise, they were good. 

The desserts were lovely with GAJAR HALWA TART being an impressive beginner to the course. Chhanar Sandesh, white forest pastries and a nice spread was present. An awesome point here was the DIY ICE CREAM counter, with 4 types of icecream and an assortment of toppings. Mind blowing.

Service was good. We had reached around 2.45 with a prior reservation, but just as the clock struck 3.15pm, the staff asked us to hurry up as the buffet was nearing its closing time. The reminders came quite a few times. Honestly, it's impossible to relish a buffet in such a short time. A bit more flexibility would have been satisfactory. 

Apart from them, with the standard buffet prices, Tamara is a good place to go.

It's the restaurant you want to go to if you want a dining experience. Beautiful decor and a feel good ambience really makes dinner a nice experience. They have a Buddhist theme and all the crockery is according to the theme. Coming to the food, we had Indian food. The kebab platter, the black dal, the vegetables, the breads were all cooked well and good to taste. They had given complimentary munchies before starters and palate cleansing  shots between the courses. Would definitely like to go again.

This place is right opposite city center 2. Very easy to locate. Really nice ambience. Very courteous staff.
Good was quite good. We ordered the Indian veg starters which were quite good. All the starters were quite nice.
For main course we ordered dal makhni and vegetable subz handi. Both of them were very good. Vegetable subz handi was a mixed vegetables in palak gravy, really good. We ordered different kinds of bread garlic naan, onion kulcha, butter naan. The food was very good.
For drinks we ordered something called heavenly bliss and a watermelon based drink both were good.
All in all the place is really nice, though a little expensive and for a person living in South Kolkata its like in the other side of town. But kit was a good experience.

Tamara by pipal tree needs no introduction . convenient location ,awesome interior ,courteous hosts and neat ambience : this place offers everything under one roof. But what I like most abt the place is :their food .the lavish and yet global buffet is simply mind blowing. If their starter s tastes like sachin's straight drive, d main course is just like dravid's square cut and d desserts taste like sourav's mid wicket step out. In one word heavenly. I m going to visit this place very soon and like to recommend it to other food lovers.
P.s. d instrumental music they play in d. Background(today :sitar) is surely treat to d ears.

We celebrated our 2nd Anniversary here and I was completely mesmerized by the ambience. It was a perfect candle light dinner. We ordered Marinated Chicken & Green Chilli Nuggets with mango salsa which was perfectly crispy and the mango salsa was very tasty. Lat me kai was equally good. Thai Penang curry with veg jasmine rice was perfectly cooked and even the palate cleanser was too good. The mocktails are must try and even the deserts.

Tamara is an appropriate restaura for a candle light dinner. Loved its ambience and the hospitality of the staffs. They serve a complementary which includes a snack with mango sauce dip which is very lip smacking! We ordered scezwan prawn and egg fried rice along with hunan chicken which tasted yummy.. And lastly during the payment we were served with pan coated with chocolate which was so juicy and tasted very nice which was again a complementary. Price is a bit high but you can afford easily at least once. A must visit for a candle light dinner with your soul mate.

We went to this restaurant to have buffet lunch on 6th Feb'16. Must say, everything starting from the decor, ambience to food quality and service exceeds expectations, however the reason for me giving 4 out of 5 rating is also mentioned below. On arrival, we were offered Aam pora Sarbat, followed by Fuchka plate on the table. Then we proceed for the lunch. They offered a wide variety of everything, 3-4 Types of Veg starters, I did not get a chance to tase them, however in Non Veg Starter they offered Hakka Chilli Fish, which is the best among all, apart from that, there was Chicken kababs, Prawn peyanji, Mutton cutlet. There were salads and chat counters. In the main course they offered Jeera Rice, Mutton Kasha, Mixed Noodles, Chicken hunnan, Pork sausages, Lemon Fish. To be honest Lemon Fish and Chicken Hunnan was not that great, but Mutton and Pork sausage was really good. I specially liked their desert Menu, which offers Misti doi, fruit custard, hot Gulab Jamun, Pastry, Chanapora, and ICE cream counter. Everything was nice and we were very pleased with the preparation and presentation, however the one and only flaw as per me and the reason for not giving 5 out of 5 was because they did not offer any drinks counter and the reason when we asked for cold drinks, which was there in the menu, they took lot of time to serve them separately. I strongly suggest to put up a soft drinks counter as this will help customers to avail drinks easily, instead of waiting for so long for the drinks to come up, at times when they are on the main course and feeling thirsty. Apart from that it would be great if they can also put up a menu card in the table or in any corner of the hall. Overall me and my family was very much satisfied and will surely recommend others for visiting this restaurant.

Heard a lot about this place, finally by the grace of Groupon, I bought 2 vouchers for the Tamara lunch buffet to celebrate our 6th anniversary. Being a busy weekday, the place was quite empty. The staffs were very courteous and charming. Interior is nice, the buffet menu includes all varieties from continental, chinese, and indian cuisines. In starters there were chicken manchow soup, assorted loaves, flavoured butter, 5 types of salads including veg, fruit, sea food, chicken salads etc. There are around 8 types of starters featuring paneer, aloo, fish, chingri, chicken, mutton and spinach. Special mention the pan fried fish and murshidabadi chingri fry. In main course they served veg and non veg noodles, lemon rice, mixed veg curry, fish n lemon sauce, chicken in oyester sauce, one mutton preparation, one pork sausage preparation. In desert, they had the famous chhena-pora, misti doi, baked rosogolla, hot gulab jamun...ice cream was on self preparation as per ur desire. Overall a nice experience, though apart from the fish preparations no other items are mention worthy. But for a one time visit, its really recommended....

Great Ambience, good for a romantic date. The place is lit with lanterns/candles, gives an Arabian. The service is impeccable, polite and prompt staff. Could have done better with the food tough. Doesn't meet the high expectations you set for the place as you enter and soak in the surroundings.

The food is not bad but is okayish, lahsuni paneer tikka had too strong a flavour of garlic. But main course was not so great. The malai kofta didn't taste as well as it does most of the times given the fact that it is one dish which is hard to get wrong. The dal makhani was amazing.

Deduct a star for the inconsistencies in food. Could go the full monty but for the food

During last days of the Puja 2015 I went there with few of my relatives for lunch. We ordered spanish style seafood soup as the appetizer and then straight opted for the main course. The seafood soup was flavourful and we could find bits of seafood in it. 
Next followed bekti Mediterranean, tamara signature grilled chicken, grilled bekti sizzler, chicken and onion steak and Rampuri mutton korma. Most of the dishes were quite sumptuous, but bekti mediterranean and rampuri mutton korma stood out. 
We rounded off with walnut fudge brownie and warm dark chocolate mud pie.
Ambience is very good, it is also good to see the surroundings through the glass panes - the famous tent-like roof furnishings add to the mood. Price is also reasonable. 
My laziness prevented me from posting this review earlier ..... I would love to go for a buffer experience next time.

Had a sumptous dinner with one of my old friends yesterday. A posh decor with candle light on your table lits up your mood. Chocolate paan after the meal was an add on. Really loved the meal. About the price, its worth every single penny. The staffs were really courteous. The cold towel service really created a positive vibe about this place. Will always feel like going back.

Cheers to the Tamara Team 😊

Giving this review very late. Decided to put "a good review later", at that time.  It was Independence day, we went their without reservation. The staff was friendly and greeted us in a nice way. Food was good. Ambiance and decor was great. Ice cream collection was good. Chicken tangri kabab and fish was very tasty. 
I wish it were close to my house.

I was a regular at this restaurant when I was in Kolkata. I loved the decor and the candlelight in each table adds an ethereal feel. Ideal for couples and also family. They do not have a wide variety in their menu but whatever dishes they have they make it perfectly. The desserts are wonderful. For chocolate lovers the chocolate samosa and the chocolate mud pie is a must have. Crazy Shiva in mocktail is really good. The last complimentary chocolate paan is the perfect cherry on the top of a great meal. Would definitely suggest people to visit this restaurant.

I have been there in an office party that was held in last year's December. 
Honestly, going by the reviews, I did not expect much out of this place. Things changed as soon as we entered the place and got ourself seated.
Tamara was everything I generally look for in a place serving a gala buffet that covered chicken, mutton, fish, pork as well as lamb.
You will be delighted at the ice cream counter they have set up at the corner..Its a self-make-n-serve counter. The most intriguing part about the desserts were the sweets which were very soft.
The place has an equally amazing dinner setup for guests which I am sure, everyone will love.

Visited today afternoon with my father and uncle...used my nearbuy buffet vouchers..its located opposite to city centre 2....the interior was awesome, attendants were well dressed, attentive and courteous..in starters( veg and nonveg) special note to be given to barbeque lamb balls,kebab and tikkas were great too....in main course we preferred non veg segment with mixed hakka noodles, hunan chicken,mutton kasha and grilled fish...grilled fish was the best...only drawback was too much filler in hunan chicken..salads were awesome...suprisingly they also served golgappas which were top notch...in dessert section i tried cakes, shahi tukra,chocholate vanilla icecream,dahi vada...just too much at a time...tried to taste every thing in decent amounts...service and promptness was awesome..definitely worth revisiting...only thing hurts is the distance...

Been there twice. Firstly on Christmas eve and they had a special Roasted Turkey on the menu which was on the spot. The buffet had an array of dishes of varied appetizers, main course and desserts all for 700+ for 1.
And in the Al La Càrte you have varied choices from Indian to Chinese to Oriental. It starts with a complimentary appetizer which is some spiced potato crackers with mango sauce so that we eagerly wait while having something to munch on. The Bhetki preparations were out of the box and tasted equally good, the Cacciatora Chicken with orange glazed broccolis and the Tamara's Special Chicken are one of the top orders and are delicious. A variety of desserts are also there, though they take some time yet they are worth the wait especially the Mudpie and even if you don't order dessert the complimentary Chocolate Pan that comes at the end makes you want to come back again to the place just for it again.

It was the first afternoon of 2016. Excited to try our their buffet lunch, I was disappointed to know that buffet wasn't being served on the occasion of new year's eve. So a-la-carte is the only option. We were hungry as beasts. So directly opted for the main-course. Since it was just two of us (a friend of mine and me) and all 2-seated tables near the glass wall were full. So we were offered a table in the middle row. Noticing my sad face, the attendant got us a seat near the glass wall which was a 4 seated table. Ah! Thanks to him!

Now back to the food. We opted for grilled bhetki sizzler and Tamara's signature grilled chicken with thyme jus, potato wedges and steamed vegetables. Both were good. When they asked about the food, I mentioned that I liked the sauce over the grilled bhetki more. And omg! A cute jar of barbeque sauce was offered at our table. Thanks again!

Since blue lagoon is one beverage I select at most restaurants, I must add this. It was presented nicely and the mix was great, keeping in mind the season.

About the ambiance and decor, oh the shamiana feel was mesmerizing. Hospitality again, excellent and amicable service.

Thanks guys!

All I wish next, is to be informed about the best buffet day of this place, so that I may visit the place again and quench my appetite for buffet! :)

We went there on a groupon deal, and had a great lunch buffet at just 300 rupees. There are a variety of items on the menu, from different cuisines. I especially remember the pork sausages, kebabs and desserts which were awesome. Great cost effective place and a must visit!

It was a wonderful lunch with classy ambience made up with classic stone glasses combined with royal flavored chandelier. I should say variety is the main attraction here, however each and every food item was excellent in taste and looks. Unlimited welcome drinks (Aam Panna) was followed by delicious lamb balls , hot n crispy fish items , smoked chicken, Paneer tikka, tandoori aloo, crispy veg, dahi vada, papri chaat, Murshidabadi chongrir piyaji etc. In the main course lot of items were there including fish, mutton, chilly chicken, chicken sausage curry and Kerala flavoured egg curry. Varieties of salad (I loved the fruit salad) and a set of Panipuri was good change in the middle.  Among the showstoppers we had shot of mishti doi, fruit truffles, white forest, chena poda (yes the famous Oriya sweet dish), Sahi tukra, and different flavoured ice creams with the choice of dry fruit toppings. Oh! Hot gulab jamuns were also there. If you are really looking for a break from monotonous grilled non veg menu, this is a place for you

A lot of people have written their reviews about this restaurant after having their lunch buffet spread which is very popular and readily available via groupon. I however went on a team dinner in the evening henceforth i will give you the review based on the ala carte experience . Firstly on entering the place you will get swayed by the amazing atmosphere of the place .I mean the ambience is just out of this world . A very important thing to highlight is that from the evening its basically a candlelit dinner experience .So those who are looking for a nice date dinner or an anniversary dinner , this maybe the right place for you. But I would not say that for an office team dinner .Next I will highlight the service of the staff which is a pivotal part of this restaurant .The staff is amazingly well behaved and will properly take you orders and also divide the food accordingly based in the number of people and the food. I would say I am really impressed by their service .Lastly the food. Unfortunately the food is falls behind all the glamour and service .We had : - 

Starters :
1. Non veg kebab platter .( 3.5 / 5 )

Main course :
1. Bekti ala Diana ( 5 / 5 )
2. Mixed fried rice ( 3 / 5 )
3. Chicken in hot garlic sauce ( 2.5 / 5 )

The kebab platter dissapointed us a lot. Priced at 725 it had only 8 pieces and the pieces were small and the taste was okay . But we were expecting a lot. The 8 pieces were an assertion of chicken tengri kabaab, fish kabaab , mutton galawati kabaab , chicken tikka . Apart from the fish all the others are ordinary . It was something you must all have tasted before everywhere . The savoir of the evening was ( Bekti ala Diana ). If there is one dish that you can order from this place , it has to be this one . Although the price is a bit on the higher side it is just a delight and us sufficient for 2 person . I would not say much about the Chinese items because I have already forgotten about them. I really like the way they try to change the taste by giving complimentary items in between starters and main course .I like the idea and the complimentary items are really good .  The chocolate pan in the end as a mouth refreshner was just wonderful . As for the moment of truth I would not recommend this place for a foodie . But for those guys who want to have a date or an anniversary dinner, this just might be the perfect place to indulge urself .

A very good experience on New Year dinner, we ordered some soup for my son and calamari and Chicken wings for starters. Very well done with great taste. In main course had ordered 2 Bhetki dishes together with a Chicken signature dish. The fish was brilliantly done and we liked it better than the chicken. Overall an excellent experience.

Definitely not good for team party.

Tamara - Pipal Tree Hotel is located near Chinar park crossing. We had a team lunch there. At entrance there was a cart. A small window is there from where the attendant was taking the items. Awesome ambience. We sat beside the wide glass from where you can see the wide sky as well as the highway. Fabulous experience. This kind of buffet, introduced by them was new to me. Buffet menu was extraordinary good. I liked the veg menu over non veg. Fusion names of the items impressed me so much. But i was little bit upset with lamb ball. But overall my experience was good. Definitely will visit again and enjoy the ala-cart-e.

We went there on 26th December for celebrating Xmas. I like the Ambience, it is located nearby and opposite of the City Center 2 mall. I feel that it is located at a very nice location. The restaurant established on the 1st floor. So from your table you can enjoy the entire Biswa Bangla Sarani. We reached at 12.25 o'clock, but the restaurant was not ready. After 10 mins we got our table. One thing is noticeable, that is they preparing the food what they served very beautifully well decorated. The food was good, the menu was limited not extraordinary. They provide 4 non veg and 4 veg starter. Fish and Prawn Piyaji were good, but chicken preparation and lamb ball were so so typing. The soup was average taste. Salad, sprouts were good taste. In the main course you find Chicken, Fish and Mutton preparations with Mixed Hakka noodles and Pork preparation. We asked for Biriyani, they prepared and served Chicken Biriyani. Biriyani preparation I did not like because it too rich due to jafran and Chicken pieces are hard to eat. The chow was good and in the desert part milk cake, vanilla pastry, 6 types of ice cream and Misti Doi we found today, Chanapora or Baked Rasogolla not available on that day. They provide unlimited soft drinks and lastly, they served Pan which is really needed after this heavy lunch. Overall is good.

Food: 3.5/5

Pricing: 3.5/5

Service: 4.5/5

Ambiance: 5/5

Definitely will visit again and enjoy the ala-cart-e.

We went there on 26th December for celebrating Xmas. I like the Ambience, it is located nearby and opposite of the City Center 2 mall. I feel that it is located at a very nice location. The restaurant established on the 1st floor. So from your table you can enjoy the entire Biswa Bangla Sarani. We reached at 12.25 o'clock, but the restaurant was not ready. After 10 mins we got our table. One thing is noticeable, that is they preparing the food what they served very beautifully well decorated. The food was good, the menu was limited not extraordinary. They provide 4 non veg and 4 veg starter. Fish and Prawn Piyaji were good, but chicken preparation and lamb ball were so so typing. The soup was average taste. Salad, sprouts were good taste. In the main course you find Chicken, Fish and Mutton preparations with Mixed Hakka noodles and Pork preparation. We asked for Biriyani, they prepared and served Chicken Biriyani. Biriyani preparation I did not like because it too rich due to jafran and Chicken pieces are hard to eat. The chow was good and in the desert part milk cake, vanilla pastry, 6 types of ice cream and Misti Doi we found today, Chanapora or Baked Rasogolla not available on that day. They provide unlimited soft drinks and lastly, they served Pan which is really needed after this heavy lunch. Overall is good.

Food: 3.5/5

Pricing: 3.5/5

Service: 4.5/5

Ambiance: 5/5

We wanted to try out this place for its top ratings on Zomato and we were not one bit disappointed with it. 
Location- It is very easy to locate and is situated on the first floor of the Pipal Tree Hotel. There is sufficient place for car parking outside the hotel. 
Ambience-4.5
We absolutely loved the ambience and the decor. The shamiana, the ceilings, the candlelit tables, and the glass window on one side, all looked very pretty. This place definitely classifies as one of the most romantic restaurants. 
Food-4.0
We tried out the alacarte and ordered North Indian cuisine. We were first greeted with chips and mango sauce and theater with roasted papad. For starters we had ordered a Crunchy Fried Bhetki with Homemade Chilli Sauce. And for main course we ordered Butter Naans, Murgh Lababdar,  Afghani Mahi Tikka, Murgh Methi. We loved each and every preparation. All preparations had a slightly different taste to it. We had a proper sumptuous dinner outside after a long time.
Service-4.0
They were very prompt with their service and the waiters were extremely polite. 

Overall I would give Tamara a rating of 4.5 and would definitely love to visit this place again. :D

So this is where we had our Christmas dinner. (à la carte) Considering this place was the top rated at Rajarhat area, there was no queue. Tables were empty rather. I guess most people were opting for the buffet at the terrace. We checked out the the buffet spread but decided against it. However, the buffet area seemed cosy considering it was on a terrace.

-Decor-
Okay, so there's a reason why this place is featured in "Romantic" collections. The place is lit only by candles. Even though that makes for an ideal romantic dinner (especially if you get a seat by the window), it isnt exactly the place where you bring your grandparents. They found the area too dark and depressing. However, the restaurant should be prepared for anything; when we asked them for an extra candle on our table, they said they only have provisions for one candle per table. However, they did switch off the AC above us on our request.
The place is indeed very dark so you hardly notice any decor, however, the ceiling and the wall where the Buddha is kept is done very tastefully; exudes a comforting atmosphere!
Clean utensils, stone glasses and wash bowls served in earthen pots and banana leaf!

-Food-
From the menu, we ordered, GRILLED BEKTI SIZZLER and HERB GRILLED CHICKEN & ONION STEAK. The fish was excellent but the steak was just above average. However, the cheesy mashed potato served with it is yum!
Sadly, I didn't get to taste anything else I would've liked to; rest of the items were not on the menu even; such as Chicken in Mild Garlic Sauce, Hunan Chicken, Hunan Fish. The Hunan Chicken and Fish were made so well that I find it weird that they didn't include it in their original menu. 
For Rice, we had their SICHUAN FRIED RICE, which was very well done indeed. They don't make Cantonese Noodles; they just add gravy to their usual Hakka Noodles so don't expect much there.
However, overall, a very satisfying dinner with nothing to complain about.
Before the food is served, they serve complimentary "aam chips" with a bad dip. With the bill, they also served complimentary Chocolate Paan which makes for an excellent dessert in itself!
Prices are inclined a bit towards the higher end.

-Pros-
1) Ample parking space.
2) Excellent romantic ambience.
3) Competent staff.

-Cons-
1) Serving time is a bit too long, considering it was not even packed.
2) The Fried Rice had distinct price slots for chicken, prawn and mixed. The noodles didn't. I found this weird.

-Final Verdict-
Generally it is seen that multi-cuisine restaurants have a tendency to be "jack of all trades and master of none" but it was nice to see this joint hold it's ground; coupled with the informed staff and cosy mushy decor goes a long way in garnering good ratings and feedback. Will be back to try their Indian spread.
Recommended. :)

-Bon Appétit.

I went here to celebrate my 2 years anniversary with my gf..
And wow.. What a decor..what an ambience.. Just loved it..
Then we had a buffet.. And man o man.. What a choice.. I am so full..
Starters were awesome and at one point i tho8 dey won't end :-P 
Then for main course there were so many dishes.. 
I almost had all.. Loved each of them.. Specially the pork..
I gave .5 less because of 1 thing.. They should tell us what are the things we can avail in buffet.. Coz they showed all d main course and breads but there were no kinds of roti.. When i asked they said yes, u'l get..so we ordered kulcha.. Now I am thinking if it was for other things too, like different rice dishes.
Well after this we went to the desrt sectn, and man..the custard is a must try..
I'm not a soup guy so i didn't have the soup.. But everything was good..
I'll surely visit the place soon

The interior is so soothing - well lit, properly scented, the music was like a cherry on the top. I ordered Veg Gratin, Banarasi Malai Kofta and Lachha Parathas. Food was good too. They charge you appropriately and the best part was the chocolate Paan, which was totally complementary.

This was an uplanned dinner and we had gone there with completely no expectations. As we entered the restaurant we noticed the elegant shamiana decor. All the tables were candlelit making it a perfect place to date. We were welcomed with a complimentary "aam chips". The menu card enlists an interesting set of Western cuisines. For starters we ordered for Galauti Kebabs with Khasta parantha - the kebabs melted in our mouth and were delicious but the paranthas needs to be worked upon slightly. For main course we selected western cuisine - Bhetki Ala Diana, Mexican Lamb Fajita and Garlic cheese bread.   Both the preparations were exceptionally good and we loved them. Bhetki Ala Diana is a wonderful preparation of bhetki stuffed with prawns layered with creamy cheese. I have had Fajitas in Chilli's and the fajitas served here were a bit different from what I had in Chilli's. Basically it was a two course dish - one of a Lamb sizzler and another plate served with some salads, yogurt and the wraps. All in all it we had a sumptuous dinner. Its a bit costly but its worth every penny you spend here. The staffs are very courteous and prompt in service.

I went to this place after reading a KT of reviews in Zomato. Had very high expectations...
But sad enough to say, everything other than the ambience was a let down.

Let me come to them one by one :

1.Ambience and Decor: As said before , the ambience was one of the good things I liked over here. The music playing in the background was soothing and kind of complimented the serene atmosphere.
2. The Staff: They were polite and courteous enough, but to be bluntly put, they were not skilled enough at all. They dropped the cutlery on us (literally) while swapping plates and also the way they handled the dishes and other crockery , it showed a sheer lack of experience.

3. The food: We had gone for the buffet. The food was at most average and nothing better than that. There were a number of salads like pasta salad,chicken Caesar salad, egg salad and some more like sprouts. These were good and tasty. Next there were Dahi Vada and Papri Chaat. We didn't try the Papri chaat but opted for the Dahi vada. The Dahi Vada was stiff and hard to actually cut with spoon.
Next we went for the soup, there were two variants , veg manchow soup and chicken sweet corn soup and a large number of freshly baked breads and bread rolls. The soups and the breads were tasty and fresh.
Next was the started section: the paneer tikka and the chicken tandoori were stiff and hard. There was not a hint of softness that we have come to associate with these  dishes.
There was a fish item kind of like fish fritters, which tasted more of the batter(read besan) than the fish inside. Same for the chingri maacher Piyaji.

The main course was of a similar qlty too. The Kerala egg roast , lacked any salt while the fish was bland .
The only thing worth mentioning was the Hakka noodles which was excellent.
Coming to the desserts section , the spread was good, sahi tukra was awesome. The Black Forest was yaak, the cream didn't have any flavour , the sponge cake was hard.
Next was the ice cream bar, I liked it very much. But the only thing I found funny over here was that there was no hot water tub to heat up the scoops, so that scooping out the ice creams could be scooped out easily . Instead the people had to take the first scoop and keep on jerking that over their dishes/bowls until say a portion of it actually managed to reach the dish.
Over all I was thoroughly disappointed with the quality of service as well as the food.

Amazing food. 
Not a big dining area with a seating of around 80-100 people. Dim lighting and candles at the table creates a perfect ambiance for a romantic evening. Though the tables are placed quite close to each other giving you not much personal space. Overall "not over the top, gets the job done" kind of an ambiance. If you dislike dimly light places then skip this. 
We ordered a lot of starters from sea food to Italian to tandoor items. All were exceptionally good. The fish picatta was a delighter and so was the chicken a la creque. The only complaint here is the squid was over fried and hence lacked taste. 
In the main course the chicken steak was one of the best I have had in this city. Very well done. 
The desserts boasts of good variety. While the brownie was delicious, the cheesecake was a real disappointment. Neither they got the texture right nor the crust. I will take away 1 point for that. The kulfi was also too frozen and not up to the mark. 
Overall it was a satisfying dinner and I will go back for sure. The service was also top notch.  Would love to try their buffet next.

It was a regular Saturday morning, being the weekend some friends and myself decided to go for a drive and do brunch together. We decided on Tamara as the restaurant was having a buffet. 
As we walk in the ambience was nice, perfectly set for a brunch buffet, the staff was very pleasant. The spread huge and varied from Indian, Continental, Thai & Chinese. Everything was delecious the dessert was full of variety aswell. All in all a brilliant experience for Rs599+ taxes was TOTALLY WORTH IT! 
I wish I had better pictures, but I was soo busy eating. :)

If barbeque nation is given the accolade of providing the best buffet in town, Tamara has to be lauded as being the second best. Situated very near to city centre 2 (on the next crossing), the place has a very soothing decor with beautiful white shamianas in the ceiling, embroidered seats, huge glass windows with colourful drapes - giving the place an exquisite feel. And the sheer variety of food in the buffet will leave you spoilt for choices. Ranging from bhatti da murgh, vegetables in chilli garlic sauce, lamb meat balls to crispy fish, prawn, chicken sweet corn soup..the starters will leave you more than full. In the main course, they have a wide range of dishes spanning different cuisines- continental, chinese, thai, indian. So we filled our plates with ricotta cheese and spinach cantonelli, burnt garlic noodles, stir fried vegetables with tofu, pork sausages, kerala egg roast, lemon scented rice, indonesian chicken...and the list goes on. It's a all-you-can-eat extravanganza and we couldn't get enough of it. Coming to the desserts, they had the most lavish spread ever!! Variety of sweets, cakes, mishti doi, a delicious fruit custard, brownie with chocolate sauce and the best part is yet to come- they had arranged for an extensive array of ingredients..starting from chocolate chips, wafers, crushed oreos and biscuits, peanut butter, honey to nuts, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, strawberry, caramel syrup along with a variety of ice cream flavours to mix n' match and make your own ice cream and experiment with different flavours!!! The staff are ever helpful and very polite and we were mighty pleased with the service. And the pocket pinch was 720 per head ( I couldn't have asked for a more reasonable price )!! Tamara really bowled me over with its food and ambience. Looking forward to my next gastronomic experience here!! Keep up the good work! :)

Tamara is one of its kind restaurant in terms of hospitality, interiors and overall ambience.. I tried their buffet couple of days ago.. Welcome drink, starters were just fine, they served 7-8 types of appetizers on plate, most of which were really very tasty except 1 or 2 ( for an instance the egg mutton devil was smelly ).. I doubt all of them were cooked on the same day.. 
In main course - the variety was very less, no rice item except lemon rice, single item of chicken and mutton each, which I did not find tasty at all.. Veg items were Okay, mushrooms were smelly again.. Coming to dessert - ice creams with variety of topings, tart, pastries were Okay and balanced..
Overall rating according to me,

Ambience :  9/10
Friendly staff : 8/10
Food variety : 4/10
Food quality : 4.5/10
VFM : 4.5/10

Overall : 6/10

A dear friend of ours gave us a special treat here to celebrate a year full of his applause-worthy achievements. Live long brother! Anuj Mahajan!

So we enter the place, delightful atmosphere. The ambience became even more serene thanks to dim lights and a group of foreigners merrily chit chatting. Every table has candles lit on them.
There are enough tables for two, so this is a paradise for people looking for a place to have a good time with your significant other.

Waiters are very prompt and display celerity.
And as you sit there waiting after you order, they instantly bring out complimentary starters to kill time. We got nachos! Yay!

Now coming to food,
There's enough variety in the menu that should suit the taste buds of one and all. Now since every place is unique, I usually ask the waiters to suggest the best on their menu. I would suggest taking their help when ordering, if you prefer not to experiment.

We ordered sizzlers, chicken curries, fish curries and butter naans. Everything impressed us, the food caters to the mood. That was one evening well spent. I would definitely recommend this for a special occasion, it also won't burn that big a hole in your pocket. It'll burn a modest hole though. 😜

Visited this place after a long time. The visit was prompted as always by the ratings in zomato- this restaurant being one of the top rated places in new town. 
The restaurant scores high in ambience, hospitality , decor, music and all. The staff over here are one of the most friendly iv seen. I went for the buffet option since the items served was well worth the amount. In non veg,  they served chicken, mutton, fish, prawns, crab , all these for 719 inclusive of tax. The starters were tasty and the main course was just ordinary. The desserts section was also quite extensive. Definitely a must visit place, even more so for couples to get that romantic date !
Pros:
1. Prominent location
2. Great hospitality and decor
3. Buffet menu is extensive and pretty tasty. 
4. Nice ambience
Cons:
Couldn't find any! And that's something to note !

We ordered tadka daal which was very tasty and for the three of us the quantity was too much. We could actually take a swim in it. The quantity is enough for 5 people. We had ordered lachha paranthas which were really good. And we also ordered chicken makhni and it was also really tasty. Our total bill was around 1800 which was ok considering the quality and quantity. This place has a nice ambience and is highly recommended.

Visited on Nabami, when they had some puja special bengali lunch spread. Had mixed inputs about this place but had a very good experience with the food. A lot of dishes were tried out out of which the moong daler bora and dimer devil with kasundi was superb. The chicken and mutton plates were godd and a real pleasure to the palette. Would recommend a visit to this place

Visited this place on Nabami afternoon for a lunch with huge expectation for my love with North Indian, Chinese and Continental food. Got surprised that during puja they have a special Bengali cuisine of Rs. 800/- + TAX. Then I think OK, let's try it, it should be better because we have to pay a huge price for this (later I learned that price is not the measurement of quality).

Well frankly speaking that none of us enjoyed the food, none-of-us. Limited items of starters like daler bora, mochar chop, chicken tandoori and something else not impressed. In main course, there was pabda mach, mutton kosa, crab, polau, noodles and chili chicken (road side Jhoops like quality, only taste of arrowroot). Only the dessert we enjoyed with chanar jilipi, rosomalai and ice cream (other items was not so good).

Really again I want to say the items served on that day and the quality of those items were not as Rs. 800/- buffet. There was no update for this special item in Zomato also. Buffet at Barbeque Nations of Saltlake Sec-V is much much better (with low price) than this, even there are lots of good bengali restaurants including 6th Bullygaunge Place and Bhojohori Manna, so why TAMARA?? So why TAMARA for bengali cuisine??

I am very disappointed with this restaurant and just want to forget this Nabami afternoon. Suggestion to others that please do not expect good food from here, there are lots of better places in Kolkata.

It was birthday treat to my girlfriend... the ambience was great the staffs and personnel were very helpful and suggestive... it was my fist visit and the dinner was perfectly poised as because the place gave a candle night feeling... the item we orders was in simple language fish sizzler and fried rice and soup... the food was awstrucking... I ate a superb continental food after a long time... the taste buds were ringing for more... the most interesting part was the pan chocolate which they gave us... the staff was so helpful that he saw my Tcs id card and said you would get a corporate discount and I had no idea of such tie ups.... the evening of 03.07.2015 was great thanx to Tamara people...

Tamara was a pleasant surprise to me. It was unlike anything I was expecting - from the classy decor to the atentive service to the general vibe of warm professionalism. On a weekend afternoon, it was packed with guests waiting their turn in the buffet line. Let's get started. 

High note hit right at the start. The lemon coriander soup was soothing and flavorsome, making me long for a rainy day spent indoors. The veg starters included the usual suspects - paneer tikka and tandoori aloo. Both were serviceable as was the bhindi bhaja. The devilled dimir was just blah. My companion gorged on the wide array of non veg starters and at the end of the course, said it was too much fried food at once. The main course spread is pretty wide. None of the curries were memorable. The dal was pretty great. There was also noodles, thai red curry and cannelloni, all of which were above average. The range of desserts was impressive as well. Just looking at the numerous add ons to icecream gladdened my heart. This was clearly done with love. I enjoyed the mishti doi cum rabri concoction and the fruit trifle. 

Given the woeful choices available in Rajarhat, I rate Tamara pretty highly despite the largely unmemorable food. They did not make a wrong step anywhere.

The ambience is very beautiful and the staff is extremely friendly. However, this place disappoints where it counts. Limited starters. Taste was not anything to remember them by. They should expand their buffet menu and then work on the food items being served to be considered a serious player in the market.

After a long while I had a pleasant, unperturbed and sumptuous buffet experience. Tamara absolutely changed my perspective towards this format of dining that has been much polluted in recent times by few loud joints who try to serve everything from Mutton Roganjosh to hookah! :) Without any hint of doubt, Tamara is the next best place to have a buffet meal at reasonable rates in this part of the city after Barbeque Nation. This place gives an unparallel ambiance which is better and more comfortable than the best in the business. The optimum fusion of urbane infrastructure with a tranquil meditative environment sets this elegant restaurant a class apart! Dining at this place is an experience! It surely uplifts the mood of the guests with its amazing food, attentive service and calm atmosphere. Overall, it redefines simplicity. The word ‘Tamara’ means spice. The valiant spices and herbs of diverse cuisines from around the globe come home to meet at Tamara; this is sort of a melting pot of natural color, taste and texture of cuisines which are poles apart.

LOCATION - - - - - The place is located at first floor of Pipal Tree Hotel which is located close to City Centre 2 mall. If you are coming from Saltlake sector-5 then you need to cross City Centre 2 mall and go ahead, on the left you will then find Pipal Tree (with huge glass windows) much before you reach the Chinar Park crossing. You can park your car right in front of the Hotel without any hassle.

AMBIANCE - - - - - Pipal Tree Hotel in itself is quite classy and luxurious. The boutique hotel delivers class, excellent food, a touch of tradition and great hospitality with a breath of fresh air. Tamara is its 72-seater global cuisine restaurant; it serves Indian, Oriental, Italian, Continental and Mediterranean cuisine. It is one of the top romantic restaurants in town (specially if you are in for dinner). When you are here for lunch you will have a lovely time watching the city traffic though the huge glass windows (or rather walls) while having your food in the swanky couches. The unique dramatic ceiling décor will surely catch your attention when you first walk into this place; the special shamiana style fabric is gathered in billows across the ceiling within which you will find illuminated brass bowls emerging like pleasant stars. Stone table tops are quite fascinating though they are actually stone-finished sunmica pasted on wooden tables. Also to go with it, you get stonewares like heavy stone glasses for drinking water. The lovely pristine white crockery adds to the mood. The place has the buffet spread in a rather small section beautifully presented, that gets cluttered when loads of people try to take their food at the same time. The place is designed as a long alley which has got its pros and cons. The place is not very spacious due to this elongated structure but still the sitting area is not cramped up. The place has got loads of natural sunlight during the day for the huge glass walls on two sides that really sets a laid back mood which is best to enjoy a buffet lunch. The place has got a meditating Buddha statue, set of ‘diyas’, earthen pots with spices at the entrance that is beautifully presented and signifies the peaceful ambiance in there and exudes warmth and romanticism. The waiters are dressed in traditional wear that goes so well with the ambiance and they hand you aromatic wet towels to get fresh (the moment you settle down).

FOOD - - - - - The state-of-the-art infrastructure, gorgeous ambiance and warm service somehow increase the appetite the moment you get seated at this place. The buffet spread at this place is literally huge and it is almost impractical for an individual to have all the dishes in good quantity. I gave my best shot and tried each and every dish at this place in small quantities :) On that day, the fuchka was not there in the starters so that was kinda miss, but we didn’t miss it that much since the spread in itself was enormous. 

<< SOUPS >>

I tried Veg Lemon Coriander Soup and Chicken Sweet Corn Soup to start with. The soups were rather bit too simple and soothing, but they could have been a bit tastier. 

<< STARTERS >> 

In the starters I tried Lasooni Paneer Tikka, Veg Croquette, Achari Tandoori Aloo, Bhatti ka Murgh, Masala Mutton Scotch Eggs, Murshidabadi Chingrir Piyaji, Pan Fried Hakka Chilli Fish. I would say the Masala Mutton Scotch Eggs looked very promising with half filling of minced mutton and another half of boiled egg, but they were pretty dry and tasted mediocre. The Murshidabadi Chingrir Piyaji (shrimp and minced onions fried in besan batter) was wonderful and I tried a couple of them, it tasted great. Lasooni Paneer Tikka and Bhatti ka Murgh (chicken tandoori) were nice and true to their names. Pan Fried Hakka Chilli Fish was again amazing to taste, the fish in there was fresh and well marinated. The Veg Croquette was nothing but Vegetable chop (Bengali street-food style) with mix of veggies and ground nuts in there, tastes pretty good. 

<< SALADS >>

There were 8 kinds of salads and I tried a few, like the Mediterranean Pasta Salad, Greek Salad, Crispy Noodle Salad, Homegrown Sprout Salad, Dahi Wada Chaat, Egg Mayonnaise Salad, Russian chicken Salad. Among these, I absolutely loved the Mediterranean Pasta Salad, Greek Salad, Egg Mayonnaise Salad and Russian chicken Salad. Infact I overate the Egg Mayo Salad, it had boiled egg whites drenched in mayo and minced veggies and tasted fresh and heavenly. But I didn’t like the noodle salad that much, it was very dry with no real taste.

<< MAINS >>

The main course looked mouth-watering to be very true, so I actually tried most of them. Here I went for Spinach Ricotta Cannelloni, Aloo Shimla Mirch, Veg Diwani Handi, Amchuri Bhindi, Dal Maharani with Indian breads, Steamed rice, Burnt Garlic Noodles, Cottage Cheese Manchurian, Vegetables in Thai Green curry with Herbed rice, Mutton Kosha, Kerala Egg Roast, Bhopal Murgh Rezala, Char Siu Chilli Pork Sausages, Mixed Chilli Garlic Noodles and Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce. Now here in these dishes, there were several star dishes that can make you go weak at the knees :) I simply loved the Thai Green curry with Herbed rice. I overate the Char Siu Chilli Pork Sausages, they were prepared to perfection in lovely aromatic sauces along with bell peppers and onion rings. Then there were Mutton Kosha and Kerala Egg Roast, both were amazing to say the least. The Mutton Kosha goes well with steamed rice in an unbeatable Bengali dining style! The mutton pieces were extremely well marinated and cooked; they were spicy, so tender and juicy. The Murgh Rezala, Spinach Ricotta Cannelloni and Aloo Shimla Mirch were all good, if not great. Both the noodles were extremely disappointing, they lacked the flavors and were tad too dry. While I write this review I repent not having more of that Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce, oh it was awesome, it was divine, the fresh well marinated fish and that lovely preparation was somewhat unbeatable! Overall the mains will leave with super satisfied and extremely filled.  

<< DESSERTS >>

The dessert counter was quite big with numerous mouth-watering options. I tried some of them like – White Forest Pastry, Hot Gulab Jamuns, Chocolate Tarts, 5 varieties of Ice Creams with numerous add-ons (in the Ice cream bar), Misti Doi and Rabri Shots, Shahi Tukra & Seasonal Fresh Fruit Truffle. I just loved the Chocolate Tarts for being so perfect and just hated the White Forest Pastry for being so tasteless. The Gulab Jamuns were super-soft and amazing, so was the Shahi Tukra but it was overtly sweet. The Misti Doi and Rabri Shot was the true gastronomical wonder, it had great Misti Doi with rabri mixed inside served in lucrative tequila shot glasses, and it was so good that I kept on having those though my stomach was fully stuffed :) The Ice Cream bar was my last stop for the day. I took my time in selecting the Ice Cream flavors and then the toppings. I went in for Chocolate and Mango flavors with toppings like crushed Oreo biscuits, chocolate wafers, chocolate sauce, dried fruit chips, crushed nuts, dried fruits, etc. The final outcome was just amazing! I finished that stuff in a jiffy :)

SERVICE - - - - - The service is again very prompt, attentive and courteous. They kept changing our soiled plates and we never had to ask them to get those cleaned. They kept on asking me about the food and asked for overall feedback of the place. The staffs and the in-charge were all very polite, graceful, well informed and warm. No negatives in terms of service. 

CONCLUSION - - - - - Here are my granular ratings:

Food quality: 4.2/5
Food presentation: 3.8/5
Value for money: 4.1/5
Ambiance: 4.7/5
Service: 4.5/5

The restaurant has got an enchanting aura of romance in its beautiful ambience and scrumptious food. It is a perfect blend of modern and traditional elements. Like the sacred and legendary Bodhi tree, this Pipal Tree does a top notch job of providing a warm, relaxed, lovely dining experience. This place gives you the enlightenment and soul satisfaction in this domain of buffet meals. The diversified items on the food menu is sure to entice you, this is kinda paradise for all the food lovers. Big thumbs up from my end :)

Cheers!

Really interesting concept - the food is a visual delight. There was a colourful palate cleansing drink, some quirky dips and gorgeous desserts. 

Was a tad disappointed with the taste though - nothing worked for me right from the starters to the main course.

The buffet has quite a lot of dishes and is totally worth it. You will totally have a time of your life there with so much delicacies around. The staff were even very friendly. Loved every bit of moment spent there.

i have a mixed feeling about this place - there food was quite innovative - they have tried options which i had never had before - like pumpkin and olive salad, guava salad, egg fillers, live chat counter, made to order dahi phuchka etc. but on the flip side - there regular food was average in quality and taste. the sweet corn soup and  fish starter were really good too. they tried a desert on dahi base where the dahi was stale. that was a serious let down for all if us. overall - it was not horrible but not an excellent experience either.

Its very pleasantly surprising when a relatively nondescript place turns out to give one a lovely dining experience.

Now that we stay in the so called New Kolkata, where dining out options are far from ample, we hunt for places to eat. At one such occasion, we found Pipal Tree and its restaurant Tamara. Going in with relatively low expectations, I must say I was completely blown away! 

The maitre d ushered us to a table, served us cold towels and offered us a platter of nacho chips to begin with. The order taker enthusiastically offered his advise on what we should eat and the food was served with impeccable presentation and without delay. 

Quality of food was outstanding. Special mention goes to the non-alcoholic beverage selection which the Chef had designed since it included some very unique non-alcoholic cocktails which were dressed up beautifully. 

The only reason i would take away that .5 is because even though we asked for the candle in the centre of the table to be doused, atleast 4 servers came and lit it up in what can only be an attempt to please the guest, without checking why it was doused. Nonetheless, it was a wonderful evening and I am sure I will visit Tamara once again! My rating - Must Eat.

I was waiting for a long time to step inside this place.Today I went for lunch on the eve of Eid.Tamara is located near chinarpark junction, Rajarhat. The ambience is perfect. If you are planning for a couple sinner then undoubtedly this must be on your count.Personally I felt that few of the dishes like chaat,puchka shouldn't be part of the buffet menu. The soup was superb.They might include varieites of pasta or piza(s). Though they have included macroni in the buffet. Now the food was served with varities with six nonveg main menu including  pork, chicken, fish and mutton. I personally like the fish and the green veg curry very much over other dishes. The pan fried fish in the starter is delicious. Here I dislike the mughlai dish in the main course. I have asked masala kulcha separately and it was just ok.In desertthe have varities of topping s for icecream , gulab jammoon, chena poda and sahi tukda, misti do and fruit custard. I dislike the mocktail(lichi flavour). My verdict is a visit place with your dear one to taste the varieties of food with a perfect location and ambience.

the ambience is beautiful. the restaurant has been done up very tastefully in shades of teal blue, browns and greys. very royal and soothing. the romantic aspect is very much evident in the shamianas hung overhead.

the food selection is also varied with multiple cuisines available on the menu. the food we ordered came to us nicely done and warm. it took a bit of time for them to serve us, so waiting time is a bit longer than what is the usual in such restaurants. the quantity per plate is also good. the chello kebab platter was big enough to feed two. really appreciated the watermelon palate cleansers they serve between courses. 

we also ordered a sundae with ice cream. it was okay. something comparable to ccd. only served rather oddly enough in a cocktail glass. oh well. 

bill came to around 1600 for two which we thought was pretty reasonable. if you are in the city center 2 area and need a decent place to eat, this is a good bet.

We had gone there for a team lunch from our project account. And what a great mistake we made by choosing Tamara. Almost all the food items were bad and tasteless.

The ambiance and decor of the place is nice, for which I am giving a rating of 1.5, that's it.

Now let's come to the food. They gave us a welcome drink which I don't know what it's called but it tasted worse than a cough syrup! The starters were all fried items, no kababs or the like. Very few options were there for the non-veg. Even the main course was pathetic. The only food that was worth something if not better was Mutton Dopyaza. In the desserts section, the only good item was the ice-cream and the varieties of toppings that you could put on it. Also they had a salad section and a chaat section which included phuchka among other things. But who's gonna eat phuchka for lunch?

Except for the ambiance, the whole experience of Tamara is worth forgetting. I strongly recommend to avoid this place.

Well, my colleague n me dropped in for lunch at 15:00 hrs. We saw the buffet getting wrapped up so wanted to order a la carte. The water tumblers are made of earthen ware and smells bad. Service is not good as all team members seem just trainees. Food arrived after two or three reminders though th restaurant was not busy at all. The presentation was poor. Taste so so. And moreover felt very expensive for just one combo. It was a one time visit for me.

Tamara was in my wishlist for quite a long time.Finally planned to visit it on my birthday with my girlfriend as a part of my birthday treat.And it was like 'Love at first visit'.
             Now let me describe the ambience.The staffs left no stone unturned to ensure us a pleasant experience.The glass covering in the road side helped to give us a perfect view.The interior decor was also pleasing and to add to these melodious english songs were being played  to put up with the mood.
            Now coming to the most important part i.e food.To be honest the starters were mouth-watering and delicious,desserts were yummy but the main course items were not up to the mark as in most of the other restaurants in Kolkata with buffet arrangement.They only served the water and phuchka on the table and the rest of the items we had to go and collect.I think it would have been a bit better if they served the starters too.In the starters the had Crispy garlic fish pakora,Egg mutton devil,Chicken tengri kabab,Murshidabadi chingrir peyaji,Lsooni tikka paneer etc.I fell in love with the egg mutton devil and murshidabadi chingrir peyaji.We had these with mustard sauce and white sauce.In the main course we had steam rice,a chicken and a mutton item and garlic fish.They had different vegetarian items,a sri lankan egg curry,noodles,pasta  and served oven baked breads too though we didn't try them.In dessert we tried mousse cake,gulab jamun,mishti doi,brownies, fresh fruit tuffles and ice creams.Each of the items were soul satisfying.
         Still there were a lot of items left which we would definitely like to try another time.After all these the most memorable thing was when I tipped the waiter  and he refused to take it and told that they doesn't accept any kind of tips.They didn't charge any service charges too.
        All over it was a nice experience for both of us and we would like to visit this place again.
       P.S-A bit of advice.People who would like to visit this restaurant should definitely reserve tables beforehand.The place gets crowded even on weekdays.

I have been there on 15th of August for dinner. The place was quite full. The ambience was very romantic. We have ordered food from A la carte since they don't have buffet for dinner. I have ordered one fish and chips that was pathetic. The taste was no good at all nd smelly as well. I have told to the steward . Hospitality is average .

We went for the buffet and i was amazed by the variety of the dishes. From puchkas to papri chats.. Custom made deserts to pork sausages.. From North Indian to continental accompanied by authentic Street food the place had everything. We were offered a complimentary drink and i was pretty impressed by the design of this place.

Visited Tamara on a special day after a long drive from rajarhat , and with great expectation , which was partially met. The ambience was all candlelit and seating was cozy and very comfortable, i loved the glasses ,the cutlery and everything on table , except the road view from the glass pane which was way too boring , the loaded trucks spoiled the candlelit mood , and that too from the very first floor, placing this restaurant at a higher level would have made it better , second being the music , some low volume instrumental was going on , so low that we could hear the staff talking among themselves in that empty restaurant.

the food we had , CREAM OF CHICKEN was fantastic , followed by some complimentary nachos ,and the main courses BHETKI ALA DIANA and TAMARA'S SIGNATURE GRILLED CHICKEN WITH THYME JUS arrived. the portions were generous for that steep price, and tasty too. i recommend both the dishes, specially the fish. they served us a surprise slab of chocolate pastry as a birthday cake to my friend , and lastly the complimentary CHOCOLATE PAN was very innovative.
but the pricing compared to the ambience ,service and food was a bit on steeper side.

Visited Tamara on a sunday afternoon, It was 50% full at that time, didn't have any trouble getting a table, got a table besides glass facade, view was amazing. All the staffs were polite but as the place got crowded gradually , the staffs became confused as to whom to attend first. We ordered non-veg kabab platter consisting of 2 pieces of each staffed tangri, chicken tikka, fish irani and mutton galawti kababs, all of them were great. For main course we ordered faridpuri mutton pulao, though named as pulao but tasted and smelled like biriyani but still it was good with 5-6 boneless soft pieces of mutton and chicken lababdar, just like tikka masala.. for mocktail we ordered indian twist which was not so good. Ambiance was great, soft music playing in the background. The 3 negative points that I have noticed are that they took awful lot of time to bring the food and its very expensive, cost for 2  was rs 2600 and still we didn't order any desserts and the buffet is not available on sundays, it must be introduced on sundays also, why they dont serve buffet on sundays is beyond my thinking.. Overall had a decent experience but I wont be visiting it again ..

Right at the top where it all mattersTamara is there up in my best eatery till date. Name it and they excel in everything they provide. Been there thrice, and have been bowled over every time i paid a visit to this luxury restaurantStarting off the decor and ambiance is top notch with the stone based cutlery
The candle is really well thought off and adds that extra charmFood is brilliantly cooked and expect a special tinge of surprise int he food they provide u with. Best part is the platter cleaner they provide you with which washes away all the flavors and makes u start from zero againThe choice of music is also brilliant from them as they do old bollywood and hollywoodMust for all the food lovers, and the love birds on a drizzling night, rightly perched by the window

Well Tamara was a suggestion that one of our friend gave when we were planning a day out.  It is one of the best places I have been to till now.. Food is really really awesome. Every time a new experience and the service is very satisfying. A place worth visiting and affordable for all. We often eat out at different places and look for varieties in terms of taste... Being a foodie I can tell you that Tamara really stands out. Tamara you will always be on my list of favourites and will see you soon for sure... Thanks a lot..

Its just excellent.

I visited this place on 22nd August for a candle-light dinner with my girlfriend, to celebrate her birthday. It was a surprise for her, and the staff of Tamara really helped a lot to make the surprise a wonderful one.

The staff are very courteous and friendly.

The atmosphere inside the restaurant is the best part.

But when the number of people increase, the staff seem to get bit confused as to whom to attend. When I started my meal they brought the items and came to check often. By the end of my meal the restaurant was nearly full and I had to wait half an hour to get my drink and bill.

Otherwise, food is awesome.

A must visit place for dining with your loved one.

On an afternoon me along with my friends went to tamara for a buffet lunch. We had groupon vouchers with us.

The ambience of this place was pretty good. I saw a classical touch everywhere in ambience. From wall paintings to drinking water glasses.

As soon as we reached, we were served a mocktail of pinapple flavour which was good. There was a huge variety of item in every section.

In starters section bhatti ka murgh, Crispy Fried Fish with Tartar Sauce, Fried vegetables with palm sauce,phuchka was realy good. Other items like egg mutton devil, Chicken sweet corn soup, Some panner item were ok type. Prawn tulip which was served was not good at all.

There was also a variety of salads too. Those were ok type.

In main course, Mutton item and Burmese fish curry were very good. But rest of the items like veg dumpling, mixed noodles item, pork sausage, Chicken item, Kerala egg roast curry were ok type.

In dessert section sahi tukra, baked rosogolla with great Indian gratin and ice cream were good. Rest of the items like misti doi shot, odissa chanapora were ok type.

Overall experience of this place was good but not delightful. Food-wise below expectation that's what I can say. There was a huge variety but all the items were not equally good. One suggestion, biryani item could be there instead of plain rice.

We checked in the very first hour , food was  overall good except for paneer items which were not upto the mark . Ambience n choice of music seemed quite soothing Loved the mocktail which we refilled quite a number of times . When it came to Garnishing they did absolutely fine . The spread covered almost everything that you could wish for . I personally loved the idea of making your own scoop of ice cream . At 700 /- this spread seemed very reasonable if not cheap n best .

My first visit to this restaurant simply swept me off my feet. Be it the ambiance, food, service, music, everything was perfect to our taste... Nice place to have candle-lit date with my husband, and the food was truly soul- satisfying!! It ended up being a memorable evening of our life... We loved the slowly braised lamp chops ( best lamb I had in a long time) and the herb grilled chicken and onion steak is worth mentioning... The icing on our cake was the complimentary watermelon cubes in a soothing drink in shot glasses and I was really impressed by the chocolate coated pan in the end!! Would definitely like to visit again and again, reliving that memorable evening!

And we overcame the hurdles and reached the joint to have a buffet lunch. It's located very close to city centre 2. The restaurant being at first floor utilises its location where the clean glass covering the road side wall gives a perfect view. Melodious english numbers and instrumental were being played- very relaxing and soothing ambiance. Décor was nicely done up but i didn't like the floor. It looked a bit dirty and dull.
  We were informed that the starters would be served at the table. The starters consisted of-
Phuchka
Prawn pakora
Crispy garlic fish pakora
Crispy chilli baby corn
Kashmiri paneer aur kaju kay kebab
Egg mutton devil
Chicken tangri kebab
 They were served with mustard sauce and white sauce. Except devil, i loved all of them specially fish pakora, phuchka, tangri kebab and prawn pakora. Egg mutton was not at all good- too much of ginger ruined the taste.
  Soups- chicken sweet corn soup
                Vegetable sweet corn soup
Served with oven baked fresh breads. Though a no.of breads and buns were there but i took one which looked like a cake with onions and cheese layer. Soup was really tasty and thickness was moderate.
Salads- Russian chicken salad
              Green salad
              Egg frittata salad
              Crispy noodles salad
              Papaya salad
              Mediterranean pasta salad
Egg frittata was not good at all but Russian salad was good. Mediterranean salad n crispy noodles were good too.
  They offered mocktails but they were actually cold drinks both white and black.
  In main course, we had- 
steamed rice
Lehsooni palak sweet corn
Dal
Crispy bhindi strips
Mixed vegetables
Paneer
Aloo matar
Garlic noodles
dhania moorgh
Fish
Dried egg kosha
Mutton kosha
Goan pork sausage
Papad
All of them were good. Special mention- crispy bhindi strips, fish, palak sweet corn, mutton kosha. Pork was soft and well cooked but i didn't like the sauce.
  In dessert, we had-
Mousse cake
Shahi tukra
Gulab jamun
Chhana pora
Mishti doi r mihidana shots
Ice creams
 Mousse cake was too good but shahi tukra was hard and it seemed a piece of bread dipped in sugar syrup and covered with rabri. Gulab jamun though soft was excessively sweet. Chhana pora tasted good. Mishti doi shots were good too.

The restaurant is in a good location.
The ambience is good and old school. They give stone glasses and stone textured table instead of a regular one, which I found very cool.
The view from the restaurant is average and one could get a view of the road through the glass wall.
The quality of food is average and there is nothing special in it. The ingredients were absolutely fresh. They provided nachos with their special mango chutney, which was very good. They give a palate refresher made of crushed ice, green mango, mint and basil. It was very unique. I couldn't tell that it refreshed my palate or not but it certainly tasted awesome. And their special Italian desert of choco cake with molten dark chocolate inside and ice cream in a hand made caramel basket is probably the best thing one can have there.  
The service here is really good. Its a nice fine dining. 
This place has all the hardware to be a top restaurant but it clearly lacks the x-factor.

Located near city center 2. Decor and ambience was great. Staff is well mannered and they try to give full attention to each and every customers. They will escort you from the beginning till then end of your meal. Hospitality was superb. For appetizers they serve complimentary crispier with mango dip, papad, and onions. Awesome collection of music. Food quality and quantity was good. I am vegetarian, we had ordered sweet corn soup, jalapeños cheese poppers, fluffy cheese garlic bread, American corn pepper, risotto of chef special sauce, fresh lime soda sweet. Loved there chocolate pan at the end of the meal which was complimentary.

I just came back from a fabulous dinner at Tamara tonight. I had chosen Tamara based on the Zomato reviews and it lived up to the expectations. 
We were given a very cordial welcome with complementary appetizers. We ordered a  Chicken starter which was very delicious. On ordering the main course, we were first given palette cleansers to enhance the taste of the coming dishes. It was also accompanied by complementary papad and yogurt mixed with onion which was surprisingly very good. The main course was fine though the garlic nan were too stiff after just 5 minutes. To add to the extravaganza, chocolate pan was served in the end. 
Overall, a great experience. The staff is very prompt and polite and the ambience is good. The 4 rating is for everything.

One of my friends had heaps of good things to say about this place and so on his recommendation I landed in Tamara for a Saturday lunch. The decor was nice and soothing. They offer both buffet and ala carte but one look at the buffet and I literally couldn't catch my breath! I have never seen such assortment of delicacies in any buffet in town. The food if asked to describe in one word I would just say AWESOME. The buffet had a wide spread of breads, non-veg starters and main course comprising of chicken, egg, fish and pork. Each item was a speciality of each of the states of India, the egg being a srilankan speciality. The dessert section was simply marvellous with a great collection of Bengali sweets. This place is a must visit for all the food lovers out there!

Located a little ahead of City Centre 2 near Chinar crossing. The place gives a nice ambience, especially at night. The decor was rather fascinating. We were welcomed with hot towels. All of which were previously used and stinking. The welcome drinks weren't so refreshing. 
The buffet spread was pretty wide. 
2 soups. The chicken sweet corn had a more home made taste. The bread section had a nice variety too.
The starters were mainly seafood. Only 1 chicken starter, which had a nice taste. The veg starters were a hit.
The salad variety was pretty vast, but the only spoiler was everything contained lots and lots of green chillies.
The main course section again had variety but taste wise it was okayish.
Deserts were a hit. The mishti doi and chocolate montecarlo were amongst the best.

Overall, a pleasant experience. Nothing pretty great though.

So during my final week of vacationing in the subcontinent I decided tamarack would be a good place for a little trip. We went around 9pm given a very packed day. Mini diwali lights adorned the wall next to the entrance. We were escorted to our tables by an eager hostess. As we positioned ourselves in the comfy chairs we decided to go for a continental pick as we had to get home. The menu had interesting names for common dishes. We ordered "beer battered fish" ( note that despite the first being good, there is no essence of beer) - the fish being used was thankfully bhetki. Then as for our starters we ordered cheese balls and jalapeño strips. What made us smile was the crisps with guacamole dip instead of shifty papad you get at most joints. Also I just can't forget the chilled towels given beforehand to get our fingers ready. The drink we ordered were an "ibiza" and "Bahamas"- the former of which was a mind blowing twist to the common pinacolada. 
Great place, staff, and decor. Truly worth a second visit. Ps: they have Indian and oriental choices.

went there for buffet lunch after getting a 549 buffet deal from groupon...the Mediterranean style decor was interesting. the mocktail indian twist was not refreshing but spicy having jalapeno and other spices..it tasted rather like a diluted chutney...the fuchkas kicking off the starters were surprisingly good....there were a host of other starters..the veg momo was however a party spoiler...the salad section offered great varieties...there were two soups followed by the main course...though breads were mentioned but cudn't find any..on inquiring we were served parathas...the dessert section too had many options...the chocolate montecarlo was really good...the mishti doi shot was too sweet for the liking...over all had a mixed experience more on the pleasant side

The place is soulful good, you feel relaxed. The staff is well mannered and they try to give full attention to each and every customer.They will escort you from the beginning till then end of your meal.The restaurant is not a huge  but sufficient to accommodate crowd of 80+ . The utensils they serve food is of high quality like the food.I am vegetarian so I had dal makhani, Paneer ,roti and naan. All turned out to be very tasty, specially dal makhani. Though I visited alone this restaurant but the place is suited if you plan with your soul mate or family .They serve you  complimentary paan( a digestive sweet) at the end of the meal. I am not a desert lover so did not look into desert portion of the menu.Only issue is the food is heavy on your pocket and cannot be visited quite often because of this reason .Thanks.

Nice ambience and dim lighting. Suitable for candlelight dinners. For appetizers they serve complementary crispies and mango dip, papad and curd onions. Food was good, we tried the veg menu only. We tried american corn pepper salt, babycorn, lahsuni paneer tikka for starters, banarasi malai kofta, pindi chana, mix veg and dal makhani for main course, amritsari kulcha, masala kulcha and garlic nan in breads. All were served hot and crisp. They serve complementary chocolate pan as mouth freshener at the end. Talking about the service they exceeded all expectations. Check-in for a great hospitality. Overall it was a great experience. I would recommend.

To start with, the decor and ambience was great. As we had planned a buffet so getting a view of the menu card was not required. For veggies this is indeed a good place, as they serve a variety of veg starters which includes 'vegetables' cooked in plum sauce. Crispy fish fried in tartare sauce was the best pick among non-veg starters. Non veg starters also included Chingri Maacher Piyaji, which apparently was different but not that great. Main course was decent and included pork sausages. The best part was salads and desserts.
Tropical mango salad & Russian chicken salad was brilliantly done. The adventure to make your own desserts was an amazing experience.
One shout out to the management:  Get more mutton in your buffet and you are set.

When the taste buds are bored sick. Of the excellent but done to death option of the famous BBQ Nation, thats when comes the refreshing shadow of the sacred old pipal tree.
Well, this pipal tree has nothing to do with old Hindu sacredness, rather its quite the opposite. Decked in plush decor amidst a polluted crossing in the eastern fringes of the city, its a luxury dining with a moderate costing.
We had opted for a change in taste with its buffet and good that I made this choice. As people around me always put the pressure on me to make good eating out choices, I couldn't have made a better selection.
The platter started with one of the best phuchkas I have ever come across. The plum sauce bathed baby corn was the show stopper with the 'Abar Khabo' appeal ! The mutton egg devil was a bit cold and absolutely not fresh. The chicken tandoori were not juicy or not marinated enough. These were the only low points and to make up they offered to serve me othe dishes outside of the buffet menu but I politely declined. The main course had a world cuisine spread with tge European touch in ots bread basket, the pork sausage, a first in a mid range buffet for me. The mutton rezala was beautiful. The breads and rice kept on the buffet were hard but they immediately served us with soft and fresh replacements.
Their customizable ice cream was a hight point and also the customized chaat platter.
A must visit at just 650 per head. It will definitely be a time well spent.

My boyfriend and I wanted to have a formal lunch date, away from the crowded and overrated restaurants,  so we landed in Tamara- Pipal Tree. Located near the crossing at Chinar Park, Tamara stands as a reflection of fine fusion dining. We were greeted and escorted to our table in the finest of the manners. The royal blue upholstery perfectly complemented the marigold orange  and the luxurious pink decor. The 'shamiana' clad ceiling gave it a cosy edge and not to mention the old-world feeling. Smitten I was, when I saw the server providing us with sanitized towels to rinse our hands clean. For starters we ordered, Thai corn fritters with sweet chilly dipping sauce, it was on the spicy side and the quantity could have been a little more but we both loved the funny taste and literally horked it down in no time. The mocktails, were the day's special, something with pineapple and watermelon. They were yum as usual. For the main course, we ordered Tamara's kebabs and appetizers platter(non-veg), it came with bread accompaniments. The platter would satisfy any meat lover as it had bacon and chicken in it. They were seasoned mild and the jus was delectable, they refilled the jus pot as well. Monte Carlo was our choice for desserts, it tasted black forest-ish and okay. Overall, with 'sheth-pathorer' glass, pretty european motifs, swishing silk curtains and courteous servers, we both had a grand lunch date. And I am going to come back for more.

Today, we went to TAMARA for a family dinner. We were amazed the way
we were greeeted, escorted & served. The lady at hostess desk took no
time to escort us to a table for 3. Ambience was simply awesome with
moderate lighting, kind of music & sort o crockeries & cutleries they
use. Mr Ramkrishna is simply a champion. He knows "service" like back
of his hand. I'm a real tough guy to impress as I'm a hotelier myself.
But he did it very easily.

We ll definitely go back

The restaurant is well located just after the Chinar Park crossing towards VIP on your left side. Food wise good but honestly I am not amazed by some of others review. Basically we went based on good review only. The snacks we ordered was a Sea food platter. The calamari were like rubber and absolute disaster. The dessert was just ok but was shocked to see the small kulfi handi having the sticker of Kwality or some company. Anyways the chocolate paan at the end saved some image. It was really good. Ambience inside was a bit darker to me but can be debated. Overall not good not bad kind of feedback.

Had been on my food bucket list for months, and well, worth the wait. 
It's a food paradise close to home. 
Had a family dinner yesterday and went for -
1.Mutton Kosha with Mughlai Paratha with green salad - excellent ! Soft and fresh mutton, dry and perfect Parathas.
2 . Schizuan Chicken Fried rice - A little above average. 
3.Classic Butter Chicken - Another marvel ! Yum !
4 . Tandoori Rotis were fine !
5. For Mocktails we tried Bahamas Waves and Bliss - Such Sangfroid !

Coming to the complimentary starters and desserts - Aweinspiring ! 
Hospitality and decor are the two big highs of the place !
The Candle light dinner demeanour is just right for romance.  But for family dinners it's a bit too dark to decipher what to devour. 
Had some lovely hours spent there. Will come back for the Buffet soon :)

If you want a fine dining experience with a good buffet then Tamara is the place for you. Though I would like to add, the names of the dishes are more enticing than their tastes. But the ambience, the music and the view pretty much make up for it. A little high priced but that's okay sometimes right?

I went to this place with my family last evening. Though it wasn't our 1st choice, we decided to go to Tamara since it was in our list from quite sometime. The place looks quite grand, we even got a grand place to sit. The tables were candle lit with@ modern cutlery but the glasses were made of rock to give it a traditional feel. 1st we ordered crispy fried bhetki with homemade chilli sauce and lemongrass chicken, it took sometime for the starters to come, meanwhile we enjoyed the complementary homemade crispers with mango salsa, it didn't even take us a minute to finish that, it was so yummy. Then the starters arrived along with the mocktails we had ordered which were Humble House, Indian Twist, Nirvana and Bahama waves, each and every item was yummmm.... for main-course we had Tamara Special chargrilled chicken, grilled fish in lemon butter sauce, steamed fish and lamb chops.. their mashed potato can be served as an individual dish itself, it was just amazing, and not to forget the dessert, we had Chocolate mudpie which was heavenly with all the molten chocolate oozing out of the cake and Monte carlo which was ok.. the price is a bit high for students to afford but every penny is worth it, trust me, and do order their Chocolate mudpie... they serve chocolate paan at the end of the meal..

A great place to dine-out!! Quality foods, nice ambience..I visit there once with my girlfriend and twice with family. The experience was awesome.! If you prefer to visit with your girlfriend opt for candle light style dinner..Lunch is perfect to visit with your family. Buffett lunch spread is too good.Lots of varieties and great taste.

You have to appreciate the decor and the ambience it creates and on the other hand get pissed due to delay in its services. 
Starters needs to have a much wider range. The main course section looks good and colourful. 
Coming to the deserts section, loved it..simply the best :)

I had this restaurant on my list for a very long time. And since i visit Kolkata only once a year, it becomes even more difficult to fit all the places to see in my schedule. So this time i made it finally. 
It is way out of the city to be precise but i had a friend accompanying me and it was awesome mausam due to monsoons.
The greeting at the reception was good b@ut when we entered the restaurant it was very gloomy. Although it features as a romantic restaurant on zomato, i didnt find it romantic. Other than the view which was the best that evening due to the rain, it was drab with faded cloth hanging from the ceiling. And so dimly lit that we couldnot even see the food that we were eating. 
We ordered a char sui BBQ pork and Galauti kebab with khasta paratha. The pork was presented well but was chewy. And the Galauti was overpowered with sandalwood and rose flavours, whereas it should have had more cardamom flavour. The khasta paratha was just a normal paratha cut into discs. 
The fresh lime had rotten lemon juice and the finger bowl had fresh lemon cubes. Ironic.
The dessert was the saving grace. We ordered hazelnut and white chocolate samosa. It was divine. N i have no more words to describe it. Just pure heaven. Chocolate heaven. Although the orange and cardamom sauce was not required and spoiled the look of the plate.
The other fascinating thing was the mouth freahener- the chocolate paan.

Aahh... What to say about this place. I have ever been to buffet with so many food options for starters, maincourse and desert. I am in so love with this restaurant that i visited twice in consecutive two weekends, one time with friends and one time with family. Everybody appreciated the food quality as well as humbleness of the staffs which we se less often in Kolkata's other restaurant. I was mesmerised by the huge number of food items that it was difficult for me to taste all of them. I would definitely like to recommend it to every friend of me.

It cannot get any better than this. Nothing is negative and nothing is bad.

-Amazing food with really new things to try. We really loved the Palak Mushrooms & Babycorn dish.
-Wow service.
-Wonderful ambience and decor. You also can choose a road side view which is also too good. Wonderful place to be there with your family and friends.
-Very reasonable. Not expensive at all.
-Food not heavy at all. I mean no matter how much you eat you do not feel filled up.
-We simply loved the snacks they served when we sat on the table and also the watermelon thing they served just after the starters.

Must visit. Full marks with everything ticked right. Highly recommended.

Pros:
-Prompt service
-Great decor
-Finger-licking-good starters
-Variety of toppings and flavours for ice-cream
-Staff behaviour
-Unlimited mocktail

Cons:
-Didn't like the main course much.
-Refilling for dessert section was slow.
-Some of the starters were cold, but they served us fish and chicken starter hot on table after we pointed that out.

Some of the dishes that I feel deserves special mention- Fish, Mutton/Egg half half devil and Chicken awadhi murg from starters, english parantha, dum aloo and mutton from main course and shahi tukda shots from dessert section. Their salad and chaat spread needs a special mention too- specially the Russian chicken salad, Mango pickle salad, Egg mayonise.

And the most interesting part of all- this all at a very reasonable price. ( We went with a groupon coupon though )

As described...it will actually give u a "shamiana" feel! Me and my bf wanted to try dis restaurent from a long time...! So this was our 1st visit to tamara... We went for the lunch buffet! Experienced the warm welcome...nd the staff was very frndly...!
A wide range of starters was available...! i dnt remember the names... Bt there were three veg starters nd 4 non-veg starters along with two different soups as far as i remember! The salad section was wow! Golgappe or "fuchka" was also served as a starter!
Coming to the main course... Like all other buffet menus in the town...they tried a lil diffrnt stuff! They had plain rice instead of dum alu biriyani or chickn biriyani! They also had egg curry along with mutton...fish...nd chickn side dishes! As far as i remember...veg hakka noodles was also dere! I must say all the items were properly cooked nd really delicious! Now we are fond of there cooking !
Then the dessert section! They did not had a wide range of variety bt the items were pretty good!

Overall a very nice experience! Ambience is perfect... Mouthwatering food and prompt service! keep it up guys... And i will surely visit soon!

Its nearby Chinarpark crossing.I was there for a buffet lunch. The place was well decorated with a great view of rajarhat main road. A warm greetings and prompt service was impressive.The starter was too good and well cooked and tasty. The egg item,chicken kabab,fried paneer was too good. In the Main course I don't like the mutton dish where as I liked the keralian egg dish. It was awesome. Finally there was huge variety of deserts.All the items was tasty specially Rasamalai. Though it has some cons I will suggest to visit there for ultimate pocket friendly experience.Buffet was at 599+ tax and 30% corporate discount.I will surely prefer a next visit there.

Pros -
Wonderful environment. Went for buffet lunch.
Buffet is pocket friendly 599+ tax = 719. Corporate discount 10%.
Experienced warm welcome followed by prompt service.
Number of starter items with different sauces. Different types of salads. Buffet items were displayed in very creative way.  There was 1 fish item, 1 chicken item, devil, few veg items including fuchka (golgappa). All of them very well cooked & tasty.

In main course there was option of fresh baked breads, soups. Veg items were more delicious than non veg main course.

Most interesting part was dessert section. Huge range of deserts - all of them was of very good quality.

Cons -
Most of the dishes includes good amount of sweet even the chicken of main course.
Main course fish item was not that tasty.

Conclusion -
Highly recommended. I hope I will visit this place again in near future.

Had a lunch buffet here today with office mates. Looking at the reviews was expecting more however was disappointed with the choices in menu .
In non veg starters they had just fish finger (not counting the egg dish in non veg). Are you kidding ?in a buffet do you just provide 1 Non Veg starter? In main course they just had 1 chicken and Fish curry which were empty for most of the time and nobody bothered to re-fill them quickly. Again in continental they had 1 mutton item which was left just with gravy most of the time. Mutton steak was missing in there for almost 45 mins(no kidding). Choice of rice was also limited to steamed thick rice (removed pulao and biryanis served earlier). They have degraded the quality of Buffet and want you to feed Egg starter and Egg curry,Plain rice instead to save costs.

 Earlier they provided more options but looks like they are onto cost cutting and replacing chicken/mutton/Prawn dishes with Egg/Veg dishes. Food average at the most. Try BBQ Nation, Flame and griss or Sigree for more satisfying experience.

Dont get foooled with old reviews ,probably then they had just started and served  a good spread earlier.

The ambience is really nice. But the food for buffet is just pathetic. There is nothing we can call as main course. It's just regular food at inflated prices. At this price, better buffet available at BBQ nation, etc. Overall really poor quality of food. Alot of varieties but not of any significant value. Much improvement required.

located just off chinar park, it's easy to find, right off the main road. parking available in front of the hotel.
i went for a team lunch with my office colleagues and was surprised to find assortment of different cuisines in the buffet. they have separate sections for indian, chinese and continental in the buffet spread, which was very nice. you get ample choices for veg and non-veg items, most of them are very tasty and not over done.
we ordered for few mocktails as well but they all turned out to be not as per our taste and expectation.
they had a nice dessert section as well with items starting from mishti doi to chocolate mousse, various ice creams, firni etc..
ambiance is good, very nice decor. staff are helpful and courteous.
overall, the experience was good and surely would recommend to others.

'Tamara' is located in Chinar Park in The Pipal Tree Hotel. We went for the dinner there. The moment you enter you will fall in love with the place. We were given warm towel for cleaning our hands and buttermilk as welcome drink. The staff were very cordial. They had spread of indian, oriental and continental in the menu. The dinner didn't had buffet so we settled for ala-carte. The starters were too good as was the desserts. The music was soft and it was kind of soothing experience flushing out all the tiredness after a hectic day. We loved their signature brownie in the dessert. The presentation was too good and the chocolate was melting as soon as you take it to your mouth. The presentation was very good as if we were in 'Masterchef' ;)
If you want a twist to the regular dishes, it's a must place to go... But, they don't have liquor license so if you are looking for a drink then you may have to skip this ;)

My visit to Tamara is certainly a memorable experience. I have heard a lot about the fine dining experience they offer to their customers, so, I decided to have a visit there for Lunch. Fortunately there was a Groupon offer going on, which reduced the Buffet cost to Rs.440, inclusive of all the taxes for a person (they claim its Rs.900 normally :P).
The restaurant is located at Noapara, in between CC2 and Chinar Park, a well communicable location. The table we got is just beside the glass wall, so we got a really nice view of the outside. The decoration was plush and gives a feeling of royalty. Waiters were courteous and have a happy-to-help attitude to all their customers. We were served Fuchkas and Lassi on the table. The buffet section is a plethora of mostly continental delicacies. There were 2 soups (1 veg 1 non veg), fish steak, some mutton preparation, chicken momo (great), prawn tulip, Tandori Aloo, Mangser Devil and others. All of them were really good.
In the mains section there were Nan, Jeera Rice (which has become a little bitter due to excessive exposure to lemon), and some chicken item green in color (not good), Burmese Fish (nice), Pork Belly (worst), Dal makhni, Paneer, Keralian Roasted egg and others.
Not writing much about the salad section as I have hardly tried much of them. The Desserts section constitutes of Baked Rasagulla with mihidana, Tiny Rum balls, Choco Mousse, mango Trifle, 6 ice creams flavors (which we can customize according to our needs and all the accessories and spreads were provided). The decoration of the food items is really good especially they have shown great expertise while decorating and arranging items in Salads and Desserts section.
Overall it’s a nice experience, though it could be better if they could have included some North Indian dishes instead of some continentals. They told us they experiment with their foods and dishes get changed each day. So you could have a different experience than what I had.

Here’s a quick Scorecard,
Service- 5/5
Decoration- 5/5
Food- 4/5

 dishes of paneer. There were around 6 kinds of fruit salads and chat,around 10 desserts - fresh watermelon, pastries, custard with fruits, baked rosogolla with bode,rum balls, self made sundae. Moreover, the experience was awesome and service too.

Tamara is probably one of the best places in Kolkata for continental cuisine. Been there twice and the food has always been of very high quality. Fish dishes are of very high quality. Sizzlers are too good. Presentation of the dishes is also quite good. Icing on the cake is their dessert menu. Mud pie and chocolate samosa deserves special mention.  The support staff is extremely courteous. Must visit for all.

I went for a office team lunch with my colleagues. The moment we entered the restaurant, a lady staff ushered us to our table. Immediately we were greeted with cold towels and tasty buttermilk. Then they started serving golgappas as starters. And then and there I fell in love with this restaurant. Starters were delicious (at least 7/8 varieties) including golden fried prawn, chicken dimsum, paneer tikka and crispy chilli vegetables. Then we finally proceeded to the lavish buffet spread. There were all 3 options like Indian, chinese and continental(fish, chicken, mutton, pork- you name it and they have it). The display of food was awesome, taste was marvelous. I loved the fish florentine, cheesy mushroom, mutton kasha and shahi chicken. Desserts were lovely. I was wondering why I have never visited this place before? The service is very warm and courteous. I wish all the very best to this restaurant. Would definitely visit with my family. This is a foodies paradise.

I went to this restaurant last month with my office collegues. We have opted for buffet lunch.
I really enjoyed all the dishes in the buffrt spread. One thing I loved about this restaurant that they have chosen some different dishes in there buffet,not the regular kababs.
There were three different types of menu in the spread- indian, oriental and continental. All the dishes were really tasty.
The decor and ambience was awesome too..
I would recommend everyone to visit this restaurant to have a different flair of food.

Tamara at Pipal Tree Hotel scores over other eateries in its ambience . Perfect for a foodie couple... They have an elegant romantic setting for a Candle light dinner. "Sichuan style wok tossed babycorns and mushrooms" and "Mutton Galouti kebab with khasta paratha" as appetizers were delicious. As for the Main course, Murgh tikka lababdar along with butter naan and Masala papad was a treat to eat too. The amount is average considering the pocket pinch, one plate is not enough for two people. Furthermore, this restaurant deserves a 4.5 for its delicacies alone. Seasonal Motecarlo and Italian dark chocolate mud pie with vanilla ice cream are bound to be remembered for long . And dont dare miss the "chocolate paan" offering at the end...

Lovely spread of buffet. An out of the box varieties including Continental, Western and Indian spread. A perfect place for the non vegetarians but a limited amount of options for vegetarians. The starters included Spinach and corn soup, Chicken soup, Unlimited Lassi, Veg fry, Paneer Tikka, Fish Fingers, Amrud Kachumbhar salad, Apple and Pineapple salad. There were a lot of bread varities along with sweet breads. The main course included Kerala paratha, Veg makhanwala, Noodles, Continental spread like Spinach Au Gratin( A must Try), Veg Streak and Potato Fry along with Non Veg main course like Mutton( Must Try), Chichek reshmi, Pork,etc . The dessert included Six flavours of ice creams ( Mango, Kesar Pista, Butterscotch, Chocolate, Vanilla and Strawberry). Additionally there were various toppings like nutella, Cream, Peanuts, Cashew, Choco Fudge etc which could be added to your favourite flavours. Misti Doi, Brownie and Tart were also a part of the delicacies served. 
Not to forget Paani Poori which i continued throughout my Lunch and soothing Ambience also is a plus point at this place.

Needs improved and covered parking space although.

Overall a must try for all non veg lovers as i have missed a lot of other spreads. 
For vegetarians it can be tried because compared to non veg it has less options.

First of all, we went there with a groupon deal which served buffet at the cost of 549 INR instead of 999 INR. And that buffet did not worth 999 INR but certainly 549 INR. So it was a good deal.

Ambiance: Nice n cosy. Well decorated.

Service: Staffs were very polite and happy to help type. Though it is supposed to open at 12:30 but it did not so we have to wait for 15 minutes more at the lounge.

Food: Unlike other buffets in town, its starters were not that much good. But their main course was sumptuous, elegant and delectable. So was the condiments of ice-creams.

Suggestion: Go for their main course and ice-creams. And they were serving Nutella there. So Go For It..!

Starters:

1) some chicken kebab : dry over cooked..not good..

2) some paneer kebab : so less paneer and most of onions, capsicums. 

3) fish cutlet type thing in roll shape: good one.

4) doi fuchka: fuchkas lost their crispiness. did not enjoy at all.

5) some vegetable chop : full of peanuts..chalta hai type.

6)some prawn dish : best in starters. 

7) fried potato in some sauce: good in taste. 

8) egg devil : good one.

Main Course : It was a long list. We did not taste all of them.

Continental :

1)chicken breast in some sauce: 4/5

2)fish in white sauce: 5/5

3) Spaghetti : nice

4)vegetable Stronganoff : 4.5/5

Indian :

1) kulcha : bad. 2.5/5

2) Mutton dish : best out of all.. So good.. Melted in mouth. 5.5/5

3) Pork fry : good spicy.

4) Egg bhurji : chalta hai type.3/5

Dessert : 

Six ice creams : Do not serve molten ice creams.

Lots of condiments : including Nutella..Yeeee..So happy for that.

sarvaja : it has some odd smell of oil in it..

Misti doi topped with mango pieces : average.

Brownie : dry.

Mango slices : tasteless. 

Watermelon slices : not good.

Good to have once. If you love continental and mutton, go twice for main course.

Will be going again to have only main course.

Another place to state my views for..Classy elegant a banquet kind of a place famous for its 'Shamiyana style' interior. Heard a lot about this place before but got a chance to get into this place after long and the purpose was a team lunch. 

Well suited interiors, cosy seats good service and the food. Oh the food. They know how to please the appetite of a customer. You go for a veg or a non-veg, you just can't go out of options here. Savoury, delicious the lunch buffet has it all. The starter were good, I don't remember the whole butter dip they put with the bread, but it tasted wow!! The chicken mutton rice all the preparations will just melt in your mouth. Highly disappointed with the pork though but my disappointment got balanced with the desert and ice cream they have. 
All and all good was the food, good was the service and a buffet at not so steep price. 
I think it's acceptable and you may try it out too.

Probably the best restaurant in Rajarhat New Town area.
Highly recommended.
Had the famous buffet over there which turned out to be incredible.
The food was extremely delicious.
Loved the crispy vegetables,prawn cutlets and the Roasted chicken.
Thai Green Curry was just amazing. 
The main course consisted of  many things,among which I adored the Dum Aloo most.
The ambience was perfect for any gathering or even a date.

Will definitely visit it again.

I went there on a Sunday and so, missed the buffet. The view and ambience was great. And the hospitality of the staff was superb. We had a Chello Platter and Bhetki Sizzler along with mocktails and all of them were delicious. They even served us complimentary Chocolate Pans which were brilliant. Definitely worth the money! Will be visiting again.

We went for a lunch buffet, at a very reasonable price of Rs 549 thanks to Groupon. There were plenty of options in terms of the buffet spread with Indian, Oriental as well as Western cuisine on offer.
While the starters were good, the main course was slightly underwhelming in terms of the flavors. However, the desserts did make up for it though.
Overall, From being offered a face towel upon arrival to the extremely friendly staff, it was a really good dining experience.

AWESOME!
Great ambience. Delightful service. Super-tasty food. Been here twice and still cant get enough. They might not boast of a big variety but whatever they have is excellent. The 'extraaas' go a long way to make the whole experience exceed all expectations. Be it the 'fresh towel offered right when you settle down or the pallet cleanser they bring in between courses or the finale of paan dipped in chocolate sauce. Absolutely brilliant. The food in both indian and foreign cuisines are superb. Definitely a must visit. A bit on the costlier side but plan to be here for your special occasions and it will be worth every penny, every moment.

So today I went for a family lunch at Tamara to redeem a Groupon voucher..And I must say the first impression of the Buffet Spread was HUGE!!!I was baffled by so many options and even after eating to my heart's content I had to leave almost 30% of the spread..Firstly loved the ambiance of the place..though the restaurant was not particularly huge..it was elegantly decorated,and I was impressed by the presentation of the entire buffet spread..a treat to the eyes..It has a separate segment of Starters,Indian,Chinese,Continental,Salad Bar and a Desert Section.The service was spot on,very courteous staff looking after every minute details..Coming to food: Aam Panna: Cant ask for a better start..will surely  increase your appetite..
Crispy Veggies: A perfect starter,crisp,hot and no oil was dripping..
Lahori Mahi Kurkure: A spicy fried fish,loved the reddish texture,spices were balanced..
Chicken Tangri Kebab: Easily one of the best tangri I ever had, it was properly clean,marinated nicely and charred to eprfection,so unlikely soft and tender..
Gilafi Mutton Sheekh: A bit of a letdown,,the spices were not properly blended,needed to be a bit more soft..
Prawn Gold Coins: I hardly felt the prawns,though tasted decent..
Dhaba Fries: Nothing special..plain bengali potato fries..
Fried Fish with Tartar Sauce: It tasted just perfect, the batter was light and crisp,fish was fresh,and tartar sauce was delectable..
Chicken Lasagne: Nice and perfect,the cheese crust could have been better..
Methi Murg Malai: It tasted decent enough,just I felt they have overdone with the spices..liked the creamy base..blends well with Pulao..
Mutton Korma: Spicy,hot and a rich oily gravy..just a perfect mutton delicacy..tasted well with Steamed Rice and Kulcha..Just felt that Mutton should have been a bit more tender and succulent..
Singapore Noodles: Honestly I have tasted better singapore noodles at much smaller chinese joints..lacks the flavour..
Chicken Manchurian: Pretty decent,u don't expect anything extravagant in a manchurian gravy..
Prawn Dumplings in Mahogang Gravy: Pardon me with the name..may be wrong with the spelling..i was intrigued by the concept,the dumplings actually were so soft they got almost smashed in the gravy..way too much garlic..a big letdown..
There was a personalised Salad Bar where you can prepare your own Ceasar or Russian Salad,such a fresh concept,it has literally everything..papad,chutney,dahi vada,feta,fruits..in short a pure bliss!!
The desert has Baked Mango Doi(Recommended), Shahi Tukra, Coconut Tart, Baked Rosogolla with Mihidana(Recommended), Chocolate Fudge Brownie and special mention to the Make your own Sundae with recipes for sundaes and an array of toppings available in the spread..
Well such an epic tale at just Rs.549/- per head is a Heavenly gift..Highly Recommended..

Just Perfect.
Went there today itself for a team lunch of 15 people and all of us agreed, the overall experience was excellent. So lets start on by one.
Location-- just on the chinar par more on rajarhat expressway; very conveniently located. However, parking space is a letdown, only 5 cars could be parked in the compound. so you have to park on the road. This is not done. An upscale hotel should always have its own ample parking space. 1 point deduction for this,---4/5.
Ambiance--- good. pretty good. a small artistic cart is placed on the entrance, sitting arrangements in the sitting area and a shoe brush machine in the lobby. Little things like this make a guest happy.---4.5/5
Service--- Perfect. Not much to say after this. ----5/5
Food--- Its a HUUUGEEE spread. And the number of items are only matched by their diversity and quality.
chicken sweet corn soupspread of breads (i had two varieties... there were a total of around 5-6)
salad bar-- now this is awesome. 10-12 salads, each of them perfectly prepared. For the calorie conscious, they even had couple of zero calorie salads. how nice !!
Starters--- Sorry I missed all the names, but there were around 3 veg kebabs, 3non veg. A must mention is the Chicken Tangri Kebab. I rarely had a better one. just perfect. And they made a special prawn gold coins for us ! a nice gesture !! appreciated !!
Main course--again I forgot the names. I think there were a total of 12 dishes, 4 each from Indian, oriental and continental. In each section, 2 were non veg and 2 veg. So they have everything for all types of taste buds.
just a point though--- indian mutton dish was a bit overcooked, a bit too much of garam masala i guess... it was smelling of garam masala. 
And special mention, grilled fish in BBQ sauce. just awesome.
Dessert--- nice thoughtful combination of traditional and western with a choice of coconut tart, baked rasogolla (perfect.. yet again), chocolate pastry,shahi tukra (bit hard though... guess it needed to be a degree more soft) and what i liked most... a "Make-Your-Own-Sundae".. in short, a icecream bar... you are given all sorts of flavors, sauces and toppings to create your own magic. A perfect sweet ending to a beautiful spread.
Food ---4.8/5

Overall, excellent. Price was very reasonable (599+ tax i believe) and the service, quality, variety -- they scored on every count. will recommend to everyone.

"Tamara" the fine dining restaurant, is as unique as its name. The perfect place to dine with friends, family or a date. Or anyone you want to impress. A place where you can pamper your self with delicacies which are just out of this world... 

You enter the restaurant through a dimly light ally and to find your self in the company of a pleasant team of smiling people, who humbly bow down in front of you only to make you feel like a maharaja. 

You start your experience with cold face towel, followed by nachos and sour cream. Once done you get an option to bite on some watermelon palette cleanser. 

The place serves amazing continental cuisine and my personal suggestions are 

Non veg platter- chicken tangri kebab, chicken tikka and Bhekti tikka. Juicy preparations with just the right amount of seasoning. 
Bhekti A La Diana- a fusion between the Indian fish, housing an over sized prawn, served on a bed of steamed rice, garnished with Gouda cheese and finally baked to seal the flavours and the phenomenal taste. 
Thai Curry - perfect flavours, quantity and presentation which not even the biggest of the hotels can master. 
New York Cheese cake - a blue berry cheese cake version with a hard top and bottom housing a sinful layer of the cheese, and topped up with blue berry jam

Each dish was just balanced and the young chef does brilliant work in the kitchen serving innovations and food for all... 

The place hits you like a surprise from the beginning  till the end, the bill is accompanied with a chocolate pan which is balanced and mouth watering with every  bite. 

One must visit this place to understand my feelings that I may not be able to express here (mouth still warring) 

Eat It TO believe it

The Pipal Tree Hotel is a relatively new kid on the block in the Rajarhat New Town Area. I am a huge fan of their Ira Cafe, so decided to give their flagship restaurant a visit. The restaurant is of decent size and offers nice views of the Rajarhat Expressway (Major Arterial Road). The buffet spread is good. They have unlimited mocktails, which is a good thing. 
They have some innovative and new items on the buffet spread which makes it exciting. But they do not have many items on their spread. Their dessert section is awesome (good for people with a sweet tooth like me), but their main course and starters section lack meat options (bad for a carnivore like me :) ). 
The place is cheaper than Barbeque Nation and it is a nice place for office parties/get togethers.

A great lunch to remember...we were 22 of us and after a good brain storming decided to head for Tamara..we have been earlier to this place in the evening and some of us visited for lunch also..but i was for the first time had my lunch here and i am impressed and surprised to see the offerings they do.We were given a drink of mango & lime and it was refreshing.They serve total 8 starters and i wont say every starter was good but the unusual phuchka,crispy fish,chicken tangri kebab and prawn wanton was damn good and mouth watering..We tried the common sweet corn soup and it was okayish type but the other one was really good.We tried the salad options and it was BIG!!! it has the spread of nearly 5 countries and some of them were very new to us and we enjoyed them all..we tried an amazing Burmese fish curry,chicken handi and Chinese stir fried fish..the fried rice was different,spicy and very tasty.We then tried the sweet endings and oh lord..it was the best in the city..they have a make your own ice cream counter with loads of toppings.By this time we were full and could not restrict ourselves from mishti doi sorts and pastries..fantastic and i must say the buffet spread is different from others..we will visit soon with more people..

Heard a lot about this place and finally we went for a friends farewell lunch. The decor was awesome. We had buffet which costs near 550 person. Most of the foods served were not freshly prepared. The biriyani had a pungent smell. The starters were either overcooked or half cooked. All the main course items were simply inedible. The saving grace were the salads and desert. Overall, not a pleasant experience at all. And the rating I have given is for the nice decor only, otherwise   would have given 2.

Well been here twice. This place was introduced to me by my lady love, and boy o boy was I impressed..
The service is one of the best I have came across. The food can give any 5star restaurant a run for their money.
On both occasions we went in the evening. The ambience is something which one can write home about. The waiters are extremely courteous.
But the food is simply out if this world specifically the main course. I thought the starters to be just above average.
Highlights : The Nachos (items change regularly) with chef special chatni and chocolate paan that simply melts in your mouth.
Recommendation : Take your loved ones on an unforgettable dinner date. She'd adore it..

They gave us some chips n mayo while we were waiting for food. 
service was good.

Went for buffet lunch with office crew.
So whole place was booked for us. 

So straight to the reviews marks according to me:
Ambiance: 3.5/5
Food : 4/5
Service: 4/5

Located at the roadside .. the resturant is lined with large glass window, so plenty of daylight during lunch. Which is very nice and exceptional to all time dark and dimly light restuarants.
The colour scheme is very much soothing. Just the ceiling decoration with cloth seemed to get old with time. I am sure it looked amazing when it was new. Maybe they can change it to give a fresh look. The sitting arrangement is also very nicely organized.They have a beautiful lounge.

Food was great. Finely made, tasty and yummy. Lots of variety for a buffet .. be it starter or main course or sweet dish. I simply loved the fish receipes. They were extremely tasty. Just the pork one tasted bit odd and bad. Loved the chicken tandoori. The sweet dish platters were amazing. Nothing seemed less and out of place when it came to food.

Service was very prompt. There were so many of us , but they were all busy taking care of us. Time to time quickly.cleaning out the dishes , refilling drinks and food on time . 

Overall experince is very much appreciated. I would love to go back to the place again and would recommend others to visit and experience the place as well. 

HAPPY EATING GUYS :)

Went to Tamara for buffet lunch with my office colleagues. This is the worst food (not the desserts though) I have ever had in this area (SaltLake-New Town). Although the buffet had variety but the taste of all the items were absolutely dull. I think the food items were actually cooked 3-4 days back or even more. However the dessert items were not bad at all especially the Misti doi-Chhanapora shot. So, it is highly recommended that you guys can give it a miss.

Located slightly before the Chinar Park crossing, Tamara - Pipal Tree is nicely visible from the street. The ambiance can be seen from outside itself during evenings however, from inside it's a greater place to be. Their ambiance is very refreshing and the place is beautifully assembled with elegant décor.

Everything I tried was simply awesome. Loved their preparations and would love to thank the kitchen staff for the efforts they put in. The staff is very courteous and the service is prompt. I'm an hard core non-vegetarian so I like to dig into meat most. The buffet option would make most foodies feel blessed with a wide range of options.

I'd recommend Bhora Style Dabba Gosht, Rampuri Mutton Quorma and Afghani Murgh Bharta. The menu spills over your mind with so many options and I'd love to visit soon whenever I get the opportunity.

Although the charges are high but it's absolutely worth every single penny.

My wife and I finally made it for a dine out, we decided to pop into the Tamara by Pipal Tree on a weekend lunch on saturday and try it out.

Our young kids squealed with delight at the exotic lunch buffet spread, with mocktail’s & starters, salads & chaats, main dishes & also large desserts options. There were eight starters with unlimited rotations, & mocktails which are simply awesome & tasty. The desserts are unique with different flavours & twist.

The staffs were fabulous, especially with the kids where they kept a cautious yet very affable eye on them.

The food was perfect. The meat was tender and cooked perfectly, and the kids' meals were brought out rapidly and with an aplomb that made the family feel special. 

I'm not often a tripper, but in this case we were extremely encouraged by the staff and their professionalism and dedication to customer service.

I along with one of my friend went to Tamara. It was mainly because of the Groupon coupon we decided to visit this place. Well to start off the ambience was pretty good. As soon as we reached there they gave us fresh towels and then the welcome drink which was pretty average to be honest. Then came the starters which were served on the table. Chicken Tikka, a preparation of Prawn and another of Egg, Fish Amritsari and chicken momo. Well we loved the Chicken Momo and the fish amritsari. The prawn and chicken tikka was also quite decent. Then the main course we had Mixed Noodles, Grilled Fish in lemon sauce and tossed pork for the Chinese part and Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Do Piyaza for the mughlai part. And we had make your own salad counter and Chicken sweet corn soup. The soup was quite decent.. but the noodles and grilled fish could've been much much better. The Chicken Do Piyaza was great and also the Mutton Biriyani. Here in the main course the mughlai items were much better than the chinese items. In the desert section we had Assorted Pastry and Assorted Tart, Hot brownie, Shahi tukra, A small glass of dahi and Strawberry Monte Carlo.. The strawberry monte carlo was brilliant and also the dahi thing.. Assorted Tart and Pastry was nice and dahi was great. Overall it was decent experience..

A tad bit on the expensive side, but one of the most aesthetic and ambient restaurants I've ever been to. Food is above average (not surreal though as we'd expected - had ordered chicken makkhanwala and mutton rogan josh), service is quite slow. The most beautiful thing was the chocolate paan in the end.?
Overall not a bad place to dine in..!!

Amazing, just amazing. Stayed at Pipal tree hotel few months back and happened to discover the amazing lunch buffet served at Tamara. Now my only reason to stay at Pipal Tree Hotel, infact to stop in Kolkata during my visits to nearby town has become the food served at Tamara. 

The lunch buffet is a must try, it starts with veg and non-veg starters, a plate of paani puri and Tamara's unique mocktail, all of them are unlimited serving. Starters are nicely prepared, you can ask them to prepare the way you like. They have a lot of options for main course as well, multiple veg and non-veg curries served with your choice of bread. Dessert almost always have Mishti Doi and Shahi Tukda, along with cakes, icecream served in Tamara's special way. Full 5/5 for food. 

Regarding ambiance, the restaurant and the hotel is a themed placed, very nicely done and unique in its own wonderful way. Stone glasses, wooden salt and pepper containers and servers attire. The staff is also very courteous and totally committed for the guest to have a wonderful experience. Full 5/5 for the ambiance. 

Buffet is served for Rs. 795/- which I feel is totally worth, may be not as per Kolkata standards, but I feel the experience is totally worth the cost.

Fabulous place for a candle light dinner experience. You don't find candle light place in Kolkata very easily. Few restaurant hosts candle light once in a week....But this place is now known for candle light dinners.
Cost is too high but the quantity is equally good.
Added perk is the nachos, kala khatta shots and chocolate paan that they offer you when you are waiting for  your order, which is not charged.
Overall a nice place.
Would like to visit again.

This review has been long pending, but better late than never ! 

We first came across Tamara almost a year back when looking for a descent place and we decided to hit this and have the buffet. The restaurant is a narrow place yet very cozy, with romantic music playing in the background. Loved the interiors and the ambiance. The restaurant happened to be crowded and i just loved the general cacophony of different conversations - nothing like a bustling restaurant 

Post this experience, we have visited Tamara numerous times and each time we have left with big grins and satisfied tummies. Our Favorites include :

> chicken black pepper tikka

>fish pikata with Spicy sauce ( one of the best  i've ever had !! ) 

> Prawns in hot Garlic 
sauce
 >grilled fish with a butter based sauce

> mixed grill sizzler
> pasta

> grilled chicken risotto

> and of course, the Chocolate pan to finish up ! 

The price points are on the higher side, but i guess that is what you pay for quality.

After going through all the reviews and opinion we finally decided to go for dinner on our anniversary, we went for dinner yesterday 25/2 and I was wondering why I made such a wrong decission. My wife was so keen to go to Tamara after seeing the reputation of this restaurant it has developed over a period of time for its mulitcusine speaciality, but we were utterly disappointed by the overall experience. The interior decor was really good and plush interior. The light was less but giving a nice feeling. we oredered for starter - Black Pepper chicken Tikka and Mutton gilafi sheekh, the service was quite slow, we had to wait for more than half an hour for getting our starter. the mutton gilafi sheekh was good and chicken was also good ast we keep on eating on various places, this was nothing extraordinary. The staffs were also not being very attentive, we got reviews that waiters are very dedicated but only mutton gilafi sheekh was served but chicken tikka was not served, the waiter just kept the plate in our table and vanished. Then finally the disaster happen, we ordered for Chcken Fajita sizzler and when we started eating we realized our mistake. The taste was really different, it has got a strong flavour of mexican sauce, not being well balanced mix, the vegetables were almost raw not being saute fried properly, ever few chicken pieces were stale. This spoiled our mood badly and we were literally shocked to see such preparation being served in Tamara. Anyway we always do mistakes and rectify.

Good ambience....fish finger with lemon flavour can be improved upon....the outer crust is too thick....suggested to go for a thinner crumb layer with thicker fish filling....
Mutton sheek kebab was ok.....did not feel excited....

We celebrate our 1st marriage anniversary @ TAMARA on 4th Feb 2015.This is an amazing restaurant. The ambiance is very nice and their food quality was very good. 

The staff who was serving us also very good & polite. We ordered as per our choice and they cooked all the dish very well fully, and they added some snacks & Chocolate PAN form their side which was really awesome.

We enjoyed every bit of the food from the starters to the dessert.

Highly recommendable, the portions are huge, service is amazing and presentation is just too good. If you are on the way to the airport or returning and need a satisfactory meal, this is just the place to be... Ate up half the rating because it's located too far from the city..

Been here on bengali new year... best part is their ambience .... absolutely pampering...you get valet parking.... candle light dinner... Its really a good place to spend some quality time with your partner...
Apart from that... food is ok... nothing special .. liquors are pretty pricey... but the ambience and environment will make the visit worthy..

If you look for a restaurant; prefect emblem of cozy ambience, dedicated servicing and of course excellent food, Tamara is the perfect place to be. Be with your pals or family, the restaurant with its scrumptious delicacies laced with regional spices, bite sized veggies, yummy soups is simply irresistible. Giving preference to the Indian cuisine, the restaurant has also many Thai, Chinese Mexican dishes on their platter. From the starters to the desserts, every item has its own tale to tell. Whenever I go to the restaurant I feel certain excitement as I know I will be fully satisfied by their foods and servicing. Some of their items are static as mutton gilafi seekh, black pepper chicken tikka, drums of heaven hongkong style and Indian green salad. But with that I love to experiment as foods offers a scope for lots of experimentations. Kofta is something I love to devour so last time I tried their Banarasi malai kofta, this serves the regionally local touch of the place. I also love experimenting foods of different countries so I ordered thai green curry with vegetables steamed rice and mexican prawn fajita served in sizzler. Both were simply awesome. Bengalis are inevitably fond of desserts, little bit of sweets satisfy my cravings after having a heavy meal. So here comes their nolen gur ice cream, a combo of ‘Bangaliana’ with western culinary favourites. Or their Chanapora and misti doi parfait is also something to go for. So take your valentine to Tamara to make it more special.

Went there on a cool December evening for dinner with one of my pal...was impressed by the decor...there candlelight theme is quite charming as we don't get to experience such a place so frequently as not many of the restaurants in the city offers so...they are quite helpful in describing about the ingredients for the enthusiasts ones,as I'm one of them...so now coming to the food they first serves you with some complimentary nachos and kimcha(cabbage with sauce) which I didn't find quite good in taste...then we ordered stuffed bekti A la diana as the starter which I found really tasty than any other dishes I have ordered,for the main course chicken fajita with Mexican rice tomato salsa, sour cream, guacamole and tortilla served in sizzler...it was pretty good with a perfect melange of the ingredients.We ordered montecarlo the famous old kolkata flavour as the dessert for the end of the night,as we were full after having the sizzler(one sizzler is enough for two, @least the 1 we had) so we took only one dessert which was served nicely with an amount which is sufficient,its a must for the ice cream and chocolate lovers.... A quiet charming experience but you need to have atleast more than a couple of hour when you're going to dine in there as they aren't that speedy..

The ambience here is GREAT. It's a very different setting. Modern meets old school never goes wrong. 
Service is prompt and quick. Everything about the place is impressive. They treated us with chocolate paan in the end which was amazing. 
Talking strictly about the food, with an ambience like that, it is natural to set your expectations high, which aren't really met. The food is above average, but one would expect better for the price they're paying and obviously the setting. The setting is perfect with the overlooking view of the roads and all.

Was long waiting to have a go to dis oh so much talked abt restaurant. Finally been der arnd a week ago. Taking abt interior, it's very intelligently decorated.
Talking abt service well I was not actually pleased by it. I ordered one particular starter nd I got something else to eat. First impression was disastrous. Service quality not up to d mark wid dis kind of price tag. Food very average. All in all, word of mouth publicity has gained it d fame. But it's missing d so called X factor

Bought a deal from Groupon and decided to try a lunch on our anniversary. Location is very nice close to city center 2. We're welcomed with a mocktail. In starters there was 5 veg and 5 non-veg items. I liked the tandoori chicken and chicken momos a lot, though it would have been nice if the tandoori chicken item was boneless. Tandoori aloo was also great. Rest of the items average to bad. Fish and prawn items were pathetic. 

In main course I took Jira rice, dal, mixed noodles, mexican fish, mutton biriyani,  chicken butter masala. All items were mediocre. Noodles was under prepared and tasteless. 

In desert there was strawberry icecream, brownie with hot chocolate sauce, pastry, misti doi shots, sahi tukra, some cream item with lots of bananas, cream tart. Overall desert is not that bad. 

I took a mineral water bottle and they charged me Rs. 108 including tax & vat while MRP was Rs. 50. God knows what's the significance of MRP. 

Not sure how is their ala-car-te food but for buffet it was fine for me as I got the deal @Rs.400 and that can be worthy. Otherwise I would not recommend.

It was our anniversary and we pre booked a table for dinner. Fantastic location with ample car parking. The ambiance is wonderful with courteous young men and women to welcome you. It was a perfect romantic setting for candle lit dinner.

We wanted to start with cocktails but it was unavailable since the restaurant is yet to get liquor license. This was a real dampener for us. They requested us to order mock-tails rather.

Now coming to the food, we first ordered Taiwanese Hot and Sour Chicken soup. I liked the taste but felt a tad more spicy. The also served complimentary tasty nachos and even replenished once it was empty.

For the snacks we wanted to taste the sizzlers. We ordered "Murg Tangri La Zeez". Each plate comes with 4 big pieces of chicken leg on the sizzlers. It was pretty good, soft and succulent. It is expected that it should be good in a place for fine dining and with a higher price tag.

We wanted to taste some continental fish items, but it was not available. This was one more unpleasant surprise. Hence for the main course we ordered "Chicken Fajita with Mexican Rice....". Normally I'm not a fan of Mexican food but the waiter attending us suggested this plate. Well this was certainly a dampener for us. Although it was filling and the rice was not typically the Mexican thick brown rice, but this Mexican sizzler dish was not to our liking. The tortilla tasted cold and bland, which was distasteful. Pretty poor experience with this dish compared to the price.

For the mock-tails we tasted "Nirvana", it was not a great one with tad more salty. Again for a juice glass that costs you Rs.180 (with tax) we expected a bit more.

We spent Rs.1900 for 2.5 people. I should have rated the food between 3 to 3.5. But I decided to rate high for other factors:

1) At the end there was a pleasant surprise. When I told the waiter that we are done and asked for the bill...he went away and brought a decent sized black forest cake on a dish with written "Happy anniversary to Mr. & Mrs Ganguly". Wow! that was really cool and emotional for us.

2) Complimentary chocolate coated paan at the end - I never tasted such a beautiful paan. It was really out of the world.

3) The courteous behavior of the waiter "Sujoy Dey" he was wonderful throughout.

Areas for improvement:

1) The ambiance though good but seem to be with a confused multi theme theme with Buddha, Krishna, Chinese.. If the name suggest a Buddhist theme, then better to keep that throughout.

2) Too many variety of foods like Indian, Continental and Chinese -  Better to keep less lines of menu and concentrate on the signature dishes.

3) Unavailability of fish dishes when the menu card lists them.

4) Service from the kitchen to table can be a bit faster.

Overall it was a good experience for us. We plan to try their lunch buffet next time.

Located near New Town City Centre 2, within Pipal Tree Hotel, Tamara with its ingredient-driven cuisine focuses on simplicity and purity of flavour. Tamara means spice and hence, regional curries, aromatic sauces and spices are tweaked to tantalizing effect in the dishes. They bring out the unique natural taste of cuisines and could be use to change the look of food to make it more attractive in colour. Spicy food can often do for you, what sometimes nothing else can tempt you, excite you, tickle you and make a sinner of you. It's no wonder that you can go to any length to satisfy this most basic of human cravings.

The bold herbs and spices of different cuisines converge on Tamara's menu, giving diners a brief overview of their rich culinary offerings. Today we had 'Chicken Tom Yum' sop as appetizer, which was modified brilliantly to adjust common Indian taste buds. You may not get strong flavour or taste as original Tom Yum instead it’s a milder version suits everyone. From their wide range of starters I finally manage to pick up a few, 'Phuchka with flavoured water', 'Tandoori Bharwan Aloo Nazakat', 'Malai Paneer Tikka', 'Crispy Exotic Vegetables', 'Mushroom Pepper Salt', 'Chicken Momo', 'Egg Spring Roll', 'Gandharaaj Fish Fingers with Spicy Tartar Sauce', 'Fish Amritsari', 'Home Style Prawn Pakora with Chili Kasundi Dip', 'Murgh Tangri La Zeez'. Tamara also provides a range of exquisite & refreshing beverages which will sweep your mind away. So in mocktails I preferred to try 'Watermelon Cooler', 'Blue Lagoon (Pineapple Base)' and 'Virgin Mojito'.

What aroma! What finesse! What ingredients! What taste! Kudos to Chef and his team. Every starter was done to perfection, just outstanding. I will definitely recommend Murgh Tangri La Zeez, Prawn Pakora and Fish Amritsari from non veg and Malai Paneer Tikka, Mushroom Pepper Salt and Tandoori Bharwan Aloo Nazakat in veg starter section. The starters were intended for sharing with your friends and loved ones, also to encourage a lively social atmosphere. It was an expression of the finest available vegetables, meats, seafood & spices, nearly all of which are procured locally and at the peak of season. The service at the Tamara was outstanding. So was the Indian food from Chef Chiranjib. The combo worked perfectly for a long, relaxed afternoon. We had a very interesting conversation with the Executive Chef from Tamara. "We don't serve food, we serve experience" – Executive Chef Chiranjib Chatterjee. Tamara was truly an experience rather than a dining. Good food has the power to get our hearts racing, our tummy grumbling and our senses rousing – much like the promise of a new love. Mouth-watering dishes and drinks at Tamara were sure to knock you off your feet and get you to fall in love again.

Now about mocktails, Watermelon Cooler was nice to start with, though its tastes sweeter than my expectation, I asked the server to serve Blue Lagoon (Pineapple Base) in mid course and Virgin Mojito in the end. Blue Lagoon was refreshing and packed with fresh flavour, definitely a try out. Virgin Mojito was delicious and interesting, I always think mojito or sparkling lemonade were among the best mocktails to finish off your meal because the combination of sweet, citrus, and soda water make you feel light and fresh after a heavy meal.

Finally it’s about time to move towards our main courses. I try out ‘Masala Kulcha’ and ‘Stuffed Alur Dom’ for experiment but in the end settled with ‘Plain Rice’, ‘Mutton Kosha’ & ‘Fish Fry with Chili Kasundi’. Mutton Kosha was just heavenly. It had really interesting flavours and full credit goes to the chef for successfully playing with spices and herbs. Soft mutton pieces were melting in my mouth, craving for more and more. Fish fry was also awesome. The taste was magical because of the flavour and aroma of spices. I also tried ‘Kolkata Chicken Biryani’ and found it just above average.

Now it’s time to satisfy my sweet tooth with delicious desserts. I was surprised seeing their desserts section; from traditional Bengali sweets to Fusion desserts all were present there. If you are a sweet lover, like me, it’s an irresistible temptation, time for just go ahead and dig in. I started off with smooth & tasty ‘Misthi Doi & Rabri Shots’, ‘Kiwi Mousse’ and ‘Chana Pora’. Then indulge myself with out of this world ‘Sahi Tukra’ and ‘Baked Rasogolla’, unbelievably good. I also tried ‘Strawberry Monte Carlo’. But their 'Signature Chocolate Samosa with Ice Cream' was actually dessert of the day, its crisp on the outside and yet so chocolaty and creamy on the inside. When I took a first bite, it was like heaven. The taste of the Chocolate Samosa reminded me of Whoppers candy in some way. After the sweet ending it was felt like a trip to food heaven. With the flavours so varied, diverse and some even unique it’s difficult not to fall in love with the place and the cuisine. Highly recommended.

The services were quite good, they suggest what is the best out there. Even I had salmon after a long time, not bad.... Hospitality is superb. One thing you shouldn't miss there - their home-made nachos and chocolate paan. Lovely!

Lunch buffet from Groupon gave a good deal
Fantastic ambience
Great service
Awesome decor
A different buffet menu that star5s with fuchka as starter which then is followed by fish chicken prawn mutton and veg starters with freshest dips too
Them on the main course you can build your own salad
But indian main course was as usual worth biriyani and chicken korma etc
But they also served chilli pork and lemon grilled fish that were pretty good
Love pasta station that would make you penne in white or red sauce
White chicken too
Then comes the dessert section which is again fab with misti doi and chana pora shots, blueberry shots, sponge cake with flavoured cream and toppings and mini fruit cream tartlets that has the best sweet buttery crust ever.
A must try
Hospitality wonderful
Restaurant and loo cleanliness very good

When a restaurant agrees to take you in 5 minutes before closing time (11 PM) on a busy Christmas night, you know it will earn brownie points in your rating. And when this ocassion happens to be followed by a movie with your family and cousins while on holiday..and oh, on a deliciously wintery night, the whole experience is just extra special.
We stepped out of the car to this charmingly decorated place, all hungry. The X-mas themed decorations all the way to the first floor were very alluring to me. Though a tad bit crowded, the window seating overlooking the busy and lit-up road and the great food more than made up for it. We had the veg platter for starters. It had an assortment of 4 different types of kebabs and the dahi kebab particularly stood out. The portions were kinda small for a party of 5 though. But as a result of popcorn-munching at the movie, we weren't particularly hungry, so it was alright.
The main course was good too, especially the day makhni. And the complementary chocolate paan at the end was a good way to end the meal, though it was a tad too sweet. I guess this review was more about the experience than about the food, but the experience was what did it for me. One only sugesstion would be for them to do something about the congestion. But the next time I am in Kolkata, I'd definitely like to re visit Tamara! 

P.S. I don't have any pictures of the food but I've attached a cute one of the decorations. :-)

A quiet fine dining place. This should be the go-to place for good old candlelight dinners. I went with my family though and that floating candle looked beautiful. Tamara is right over Domino's Pizza and IRA, that's a part of Pipal Tree.

Ambiance:
Sound of cutlery fill up the spaces. Candles are lit all around. Old classic English and Hindi songs are played. The place is dim and calm. Perfect for romantic dinners. One side of the restaurant is covered with glass that lets you have a view of the main road and frequent flights that land.

Food:
The non-veg platter will be enough for two. 2 tangri kebabs, 2 black pepper chicken tikka, 2 mutton seekh and a fish tikka. The black pepper chicken tikka is to die for! A must-try. It is topped with fresh malai. The tangri kebab was render and fresh. The mutton however was chewy. The fish was again delicious!

Their mixed non-veg Hakka noodles is delectable. Prawns and chicken taste good and the portion is decent.

Service
The staff is polite. Service is quick. They serve nachos with dip in the beginning and they end your meal with complementary chocolate paan that's exquisite to see in Kolkata. I've mostly seen them in Maharashtra. The paan is a must try. The bill was about 1300.

This restaurant is in my wishlist for quiet a long.. Not getting the perfect moment and so do the occasion to go this place.. Finally the girl whom I'm dating for sometime now I planned to take her there and give her a surprise.. I booked a table in advance and asked for a special decoration.. The interior decoration is awesome n most importantly  they decorated the table with candles and to my surprise they made a heart shape with rose petals in the table which is very romantic... Kenny G saxophone is playing at the backdrop making the atmosphere even more romantic.. The hospitality and the service level is very good so full marks to them but food is average.. We started with mocktail kiwi mint and in starters we had Golden fried prawns with prawn chips and crispy fried chicken with mahogany... In main course we went for Nan, butter chicken and mixed raita.. I ordered a cake to surprise my girlfriend.. The cake is awesome and lastly they served chocolate pan which I liked a lot... This place is a must go I will not say for the food but for the ambience and to spent a romantic evening with a person close to ur heart.. We are too busy in looking each other so I failed to click that many pictures but whatever little I have I'm sharing them... :)

This was my second visit to this "expensive" restaurant. Last time I went for a dinner and this time for lunch. I have found the place good enough to spend quality time. The choice of dishes are sort of okay. But the amount they charge is not at all pocket friendly. I have another complain on the tiny portion of food they serve. This is not fair. These are my general feedback on this restaurant.

Coming to the last visit experience, I have ordered indian non veg platter as starter. The service was really quick and I was wondering how come it can be ready within that short time frame. How ever I found the fish was too salty and the chicken grilled drumstick was burnt from outside. Inside the chicken drumstick was juicy enough. Next on the main course we have ordered one continental fish dish which was to served along with the herb rice. I have found the amount of rice served was too less for 2 person. 

In sort , it is an expensive place and not for regular visit. You can enjoy your dining there once in a while. I wish them all the best in the coming days.

Well I have been there for the Tuscan food !! festival and the quality of the Tuscan dishes were in one word amazing! The quality and refinement of the risotto preparation and the salmon dish was fantastic! Pricing was slightly on the higher side which was understandable considering the salmon and risotto rice !! must have been imported. But the cherry on top was the amazing chocolate coated paan at the end. The ambience is extremely good having large windows allowing plenty of sunlight and view of the city . Overall on my first trip could not find a single reason to deduct any points.

Last night it was the second visit for me and my wife. The interiors have been improvised further since my last visit . The slowly lit candle and the terracota glasses definitely heightened the cozy romantic atmosphere. To judge a restraunt I personally prefer for a-la carte service instead of buffet.
Within moments of our first order for appetizer spicy calamari the team provided us our ' complimentary' appetizer of nachos with mango salsa! When they did that last time I thought it was the part of the gesture of their food festival. But this time I am assured it's actually a fantastic service they provide. Then comes the appetizer and boy how tasty and crispy the calamari was!! -5/5 !
Now time for the main event and we actually goofed up a bit by ordering more than we can chew. Again they surprised us by providing complimentary palette cleansers! While Her bhetki sizzler platter was mind blowing ; I was a tad disappointed with my chicken risotto . I missed the arugula leaves which heightens the flavours a lot compared to my last visit.also the risotto felt a bit dry compared to my last visit. So my jaws ran out of steam after a while but it was still wonderful! -4/5
Now the final part another complimentary offering(I won't divulge) what it is! You have to visit to experience it! Overall a fantastic dinner  date ended on a high note.
Tamara undoubtedly is the land of precious surprises!!

Spent n awesome romantic evening at Tamara & also a perfect candle light dinner just take my heart... Foods are equally good but murg tikka lababdar was little bit less salty. Montecarlo was outstanding & chocolate pan was awesome.. staffs are very helpful.. We also take there lunch buffet.  This was great.

This is probably the first five star rating for me. I loved the place so so much. 

I went there for a quiet dinner. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed. The ambience is amazing, maintaining the perfect balance of light, amazing music and extremely courteous staff. The food was very good, specially their mushroom soup. A must try place for quiet dinners. :)

After visiting of number of times I am writing the review, I must admit this place is a must visit for foodies. Unlimited starter coupled with complementary drink. Buffet is only during the lunch time, makes the experience all the more enjoyable. I really liked the ambience. Have hardly taken main course as starter alone can satisfy one's needs. Irrespective of preference, please do try murgh tangri kebab, barbequed lamb balls, & crunchy fried fish. Simply incredible. Mutton duckbanglow curry with paratha was also very good. chanar jilebi with monte carlo is a must try. Shahi tukra was the best in the list. All in all a must try for everyone. 
one suggestion, they can start with one live counter along with buffet which will be more interesting and unique along with this lavish spread.

Had it not been for a 80 plus member team, we wouldn't have chosen Tamara for our team lunch. Though skeptical, our hopes were lifted as we reached to find out the variety in its spread. Being a pescatarian, my excitement built up as I found fish fingers and crispy chilli prawn for starters. However it dropped the minute I tasted the food. The fish fingers had an almost impenetrable coating and were chewy while the chilli prawn was totally flat. Even the baby corn and paneer tikka was disappointing. The only thing that was close to expectation was the sweet corn veg soup and the phuchka. The apple juice was only worth a sip. But I guess none would go to a restaurant just for these. The main course was more disappointing. We tried the lemon scented rice and shorshey fish but they both fell face down. The greatest disaster was the biriyani, which neither looked or tasted like one. The final blow came with the 7item dessert platter. Except for the shahi tukra, neither the blueberry mousse nor the over hyped chocolate Monte Carlo scores a single point.
Overall, very disappointing.
It has an impressively elaborate spread but really needs to work on the taste.
Decor isn't very plush but the ambience is decent. Service is okay. Difficult to visit without a car due to dearth of public transport.

A perfect break from the monogamy menu patterns of the most Kolkata restaurants. Tamara platters key vegetables &  proteins boldly cooked in distinct spices. Perfectly proportioned for two the restaurant is surely the place for your dates to shimmer in the candle lit tables. Be confident with the continental dishes and yes surely try the fish starters (bhetki & Calamari). #eatgood

Location: Tamara, Pipaltree Hotel, Rajarhat.

First time my visit in Tamara.

The ambiance out here is quite soothing, candle light dinner and would simply accelerate the process of calming your mind. It has a pretty nice decor and gave a romantic feel.

Had opted for the Italian Food Festival menu and I can without a doubt say, Tamara dishes up some great Italian Food.

Our order comprised of the following:

-Calamari Fritti: Fresh & crunchy.

- Fresh asparagus & mozzarella pinwheels: Was good, could have been better.

- Bacon wrapped chicken: Was absolutely delicious.

-Seafood soup: Lip smacking'!

-Grilled lamb chops: Was perfectly cooked and tasted great.

-Roasted Duck Breast with orange brandy sauce: Soft and brushed with butter.

-stuffed Bekti: Tasted great. The stuffing was flavourful.

- Garlic breads: Was baked to choice.

The service was a bit slow since the place lacked staff. I suppose there were just a couple of them.

Appreciate the complementary homemade Chips & dips, water melon shots & Chocolate Paan. 

A costly affair, but worth it.Overall was a good experience.

2 would be the apt rating I would say for the lunch buffet. few items like veg drumsticks, the chicken starter, desserts were good, but few items were equally bad. especially the mutton kebab, the lamb and fish preparations were very poor. there was actually foul smells coming out from the fish preps and only fat was there in lamb, no meat. in main course, I expected at least biriyani or fried rice to be there, but i got only white steamed normal rice. though after all, desserts were good. so all in all...not so good exp for me.

Recently visited this new restaurant in team lunch of 15 folks..and we all were impressed by the starters-chicken tengri,mutton kebab,fish finger and many more with crispy chilli corns.Tried their biryani and it was very different and mindbogglingly tasty.. they serve great desserts also-almost 7 types.Very much value for money and surely will visit in the dinner for the candle light ambiance as informed by the manager! yes corporate gets discount also while showing the id card.

Simply awesome place. Courteous attendants, they will make you feel like a treasured and valued customer. Nice decor and ambience. The food especially starters (both veg & non-veg) are superb.

We liked the Murgh Tangri kebab, prawn cocktail & gandharaj fish finger the most. Mutton shammi kebab was also in the spread.

The buffet spread is elaborate with starters, salad spreads, north Indian food, few Thai & Chinese dishes also. You will get a good multi cuisine options in the buffet. 

Kulcha, roti, naan, will be served from kitchen on request.

The deserts were awesome too and by the end of the meal we were feeling like royalty. The price is on the higher side, but considering the food and service, it's great. 

Cons: it is better to make a reservation well in advance or else you'll have to wait for to get a table.

This is the worst place I have ever been. Had planned for a lunch with my husband on our 3rd anniversary, but all in vain. My total planning got jeopardized because of the worst quality buffet food we had. The ambience is good, but other than that everything is poor. The quality of the food is just pathetic. They charge 550+tax money for lunch buffet, with zero graded food quality. They don’t even have proper prawn items, other than some stupid prwan shots. God knows who has created the menu card and the selection of the menu items. Other than paneer  kabab,dal makhani and dessert everything was just to be thrown out of the window. The fish curry, chicken murgh, they serve is just a stupid garbage item. Even a poor smell was coming from that fish preparation.please don’t try out this place for fooding. Even I saw 2 other couple complained of the poor quality and the chef was forced to change their item since they were on a-la-Carte type.The chef needs to have a proper training from an hotel management school before he starts cooking. They don’t even have a proper parking place. The overall experience was simply poor and the worst form of being bad.  

I rate fooding here in negative. Don’t spend your valuable money in stupid crap food.

This restaurant is bang on the Rajarhat Main Road. You can hardly miss this hotel on the main road.
As you reach the 1st floor, you shall be mesmerised by the beautiful set up of the restaurant. The wall of the lobby that leads to the restaurant from Lift is dotted with candles.
Glass wall on two sides of the restaurant overviews the Rajarhat Expressway. The entire restaurant is illuminated by candles and offers a picture perfect ambience.
Now lets come to the food. We ordered-
1. Taiwanese Style Prawn Soup- It was awesome.
2. Mutton Gilafi Sheek- The kebabs were succulent and simply yummie.
3. Chicken Biryani- Though they claim its Kolkata style owing to the Potato and Egg, it was not a Dum Biryani. It tasted above average but whats worth mentioning is the fact that you get almost boneless pieces of Chicken in every bite of the Biryani.

Pocket pinch- Rs 1120/- (incl of Taxes). Special mention-
1. Complementary freshening up towels.
2. Complementary nachos/ chips as appetiser.
3. Watermelon with some mixes served in between starters n main course.
O
It was actually a multi cuisine dinner for us owing to the different preferences of me and my spouse.

The food was good but given the price, we may expect a little more quantity.

Hence,
Ambience- 5/5
Food-4/5
Experience- 5/5
Value for money- 3.5/5

Though the food quality n quantity could have been little better, I cant stop myself from rating them 4.5/5.
Highly recommended.

That sudden craving of having lunch outside made me and my friend visit this place and also the advantage of staying near this place actually made our plan successful. We absolutely adored the decorations and the ambiance. We decided beforehand to have continental dishes but once we checked out the buffet items we decided to go for it. They served us chicken sweet corn soup which was very nice and i must say that me being a buffet lover i never had such a tasty soup in other places. Then came the phuchka ( crunchy and equally tasty), egg devil, tangri kebab, prawn pakora, fish chop and mutton kebab. There were other veg starters which were equally good. All the food items were fresh and tasty. In the main course i liked the noodle preparation, pork cooked in thai style, fish orly ( it lost its crunchiness but was tasty) and the mutton biryani ( a bit different in taste but good and the mutton was cooked to perfection). There were 7 dessert items which were chenar jalebi, shahi tukra ( this item stole the show), chocolate pasty, chocolate monte carlo ( tried this for the first time and i liked it) and the others i don't remember not because they were not worth it. The staffs are well behave and polite. The amount which we paid were around Rs. 1300 which i think is quite reasonable when compared to the food they were serving. I would visit it again soon.

we were thinking of eating out at some new place.. and so went to tamara.. its situated on the first floor of pipal tree hotel near citycentre 2.. firstly, the ambience.. its amazingly beautiful with its dim lights, traditional decorations, bells and diyas.. and the view outside is equally awesome.. About the food.. its pretty good.. we started with the tangri la zeez sizzler kebab.. it was absolutely delllicious!! indian main course dishes are good enough.. and the desserts are just fabulous.. specially the MONTE CARLO.. its a must try if you go there.. and at last they gave us chocolate paan.. that was something new and very tasty too.. they also serve continental and oriental dishes.. the waiters are quite cooperative and the service is also quick.. i think it will be much more interesting if they include some more variety of dishes in their indian non veg menus.. i felt the that there were very few dishes to select from... overall.. a great dining experience! will surely visit again!!

Tamara had been on my Wishlist for quiet sometime, and finally got a chance to visit the restaurant recently. Earlier I had visited their Ira Cafe on the ground floor which I have already reviewed with full satisfaction. Now its the turn of Tamara.
Situated on the first floor of the Pipal Tree hotel near CC-II, its interiors are beautiful with well-cushioned chairs in blue colors. The ceiling is beautifully decorated with flowing curtains and the facade is a glass overlooking the road. Beautiful view and ambience.
I chose to have their Buffet lunch, and I must say, I did not regret the decision. They start with the Phuchka & Bengal-styled ghugni served on the table. The spread is sumptous with 8-10 starters (both Veg & Non-veg), approx. 6 types of salads, Main course including both Veg & Non-veg dishes, and lastly around 10 types of desserts with unlimited mocktails.
The best items among the spread-Prawn chops, Egg devil, Paneer Achari Tikka, Muttun patties, Diced Pork in Thai sauce, Baked fish, Mutton Biriyani, Pasta salad. Breads were missing from the spread, but maybe they would have served separately if we would have wanted to. Desserts were delicious, notably among them was the Mishti Doi with Rabri Shots, and the Choclate Monte Carlo. A big thumbs up to the chef for the Monte Carlo dish, which was unique.
Recommended for every food lover.

After almost 7 months, my second visit to Tamara left me grossly disappointed and hence I decided to re-write my review.
The starters were as usual and nothing different to talk about-the same old phuchka, Egg Devil, Mutton chops, etc. The Main course items were the worst I have ever tasted, which is so different compared to my first review. None of the Main course items were tasty; some items even tasted stale. I left a lot of the items in my plate since I could not eat it. This will perhaps explain how aweful they were.
The desserts section was a little better with 2 pastries and 1 sweet. 5 varieties of ice-creams were on display with some already melted and some were empty. I asked one of the serving staff who prepared and served a Sundae with ice-cream from their kitchen. He also served me another sweet dish which was not part of the dessert. Being a Mango season, I was expecting some Mango delicacies in the dessert section, but there was none.
Salad spread was below average.
Very limited Mocktails was served.
My first visit was on a Saturday and the 2nd visit was on a Thursday. Maybe that could be the reason for a disappointing Buffet spread.
My 2nd experience at Tamara has been disappointing and I will never visit again. I am reviewing my rating to 2.0 from 4.5.
Other should also re-consider their decisions when choosing Buffets at Tamara.

We went to Tamara for a buffet lunch with great expectations. Sadly it turned out to be a very bad experience. We bought coupon for 2 via Groupon and reached Tamara at around 2 pm.  Highlights of our experience - 
1. The starters included Fuchka and Ghugni. I do not understand why these items should be part of buffet  starters at such a high price (We eat this everyday). Ghugni was cold and tasteless.
2. There was not a single Kebab item in starter. There were fish and chicken pakoras which were tasteless and cold. We couldn't find any fish and chicken in those pakoras. Simply horrible.
3. The main course too  was not up to the mark. The chicken curry was not cooked properly. Mutton Biriyani was average. We didn't touch the chowmein and pork curry since we wanted to eat more continental varieties. There were none. We had to satisfy ourselves with the Plain rice, Dal and Naan. The Paneer item was ok. 
4. Dessert was ok but again we expected more. 

Overall we were highly disappointed with the menu at Tamara, given the high price we paid. The ambience was ok but the dreadful food made us ignore other things. 

We came to know that Tamara doesn't have a regular buffet service and the ongoing buffet service is a promotional offering. It was our first outing at Tamara and we expected much more. Even if the ala carte food might be better (we are actually very surprised at the high ratings and nice feedbacks given by many about Tamara), this bad experience makes it very difficult for us to go there again. There is huge scope for improvement. Do not fool your customers like this.

Note : Most of the food items listed on Groupon site (like Starters -  MURGH TANGRI KEBAB
, MUTTON SHAMMI KEBAB;  Main Course - LUCKNOWI MUTTON KORMA
, SORSHE MACH etc., Desserts - HOT GULAB JAMUN, KESARIYA PHIRNI
, FRESH CUT FRUITS) were absent from the menu!!! There was no unlimited mocktail, but only one mocktail served unlimited times!! ;-) Horrible experience!

This place is very overrated on zomanto. Staff and service is good but food taste doesn't match with price. Very limited options are in veg. Starters were cold. Only puchka was good. In main course paneer was average, dal was very average though they said it 'Dal Makhni'(probably they don't know what dal makhni is). Naan service was below average. Rice were not cooked properly. Desserts were also average apart from one. Overall not at all recommended. I was there in today's lunch. Went through Groupon.

This is nicely decorated place with a romantic essence. Especially at night the place comes to full bloom. Ideal for a date,tamara boasts of mouth watering cuisine too.
Their Buffett is a pompous display of thai,chinese and Indian dishes. They also include special kebabs of the day,which varies over the week. I remember having veg guloti keban,which indeed was surprising to me as o have only heard of guloti kebab prepared out of mutton. The preparations of fish was the best,and was so tender it melted in the mouth.
The variety of starters available here is very generous,which is only outrun by barbeque nation. Main course here is pretty simple and one can easily opt for indian,chinese or thai tastes. Dessert on the other hand was  much more than what i had expected .... they don't include much fruit and cakes,which they compensate with their delicious gulab jamuns, ice cream,kheer sweets. The misti doi was served with kheer and chocolate chips and this truly lifted my spirits :) . They also serve unlimited mocktails.
The staff here is very polite and welcoming and you can definitely expect quality service in Tamara.

Maacher dim er bora and phuchka in a buffet menu!! Thats definitely something. Visited this place to taste their buffet spread. It contained a total of 10 mouth watering starters. Every preparation was well cooked. The best among the starters were the thai corn kebab and the chicken pakoras.

The mutton biriyani in the main course was really tasty along with the fish and the chicken side dish. Howver, the sphagetti was overcooked and very near to a disaster. 

Tamara has wonderful items in their dessert menu such as chana pora, mishti doi-rabri shots, firni (which was not upto the mark) and hot gulab jamuns.

Oh i just forgot to mention about the unlimited aam-panna sharbat!!

Each and every staff of this place are well mannered which a wonderful smile on their faces.

An absolutely loveable place to dine peacefully in the rajarhat area.This place was chosen through recommendations from friends and was long time pending.Finally we made it and felt satisfied to the core.We tried random items from soups to desserts.We were 8 of us and had brilliant chicken-asparagas soup and fantastic mushroom soup.We have never had such a lovely creamy soup with a delicate and velvety taste of asaparagas.We went for chicken fajita,grilled fish and steaks in our main course which were appreciated by everyone..and i forget to tell you they serve mind blowing frozen green mango for palate twister.We ended up with a melting chocolate dessert and an heaven called montecarlo.The service was slow and superb.This is not a place to order food,having it and run away..but a meal which will be cherished and a memorable one.This was my mother's 60th birthday and definitely we will remember it for long.Thank you Tamara.

And yes don't forget to try their chocolate coated pan !!

I visited Tamara today for lunch with my bro, mom and few of my mom's friends. They had Bengali buffet for Durga puja which I don't mind but wat I really mind is that most of their food were cold. How difficult is it to keep the food hot on the buffet ??? Food was not bad, few preparations were actually very good but we couldn't enjoy it becoz of the fact that everything was cold. 
The staffs were well behaved and very courteous and according to me if they want to keep this place running the management really needs to wake up and control the kitchen and serve warm and fresh food to the customers.

we went to Tamara today lunch procuring groupon coupons and were in a group. I also had this buffet earlier but it was chinese buffet spread altogether. This time when we procure this groupon coupon we came to know their buffet spread being remodeled by lavish multi-cuisine starters and north-Indian dishes and desserts. 
we booked our reservation before and when we reached Tamara it was almost full today. we started with nice mocktails and starters from the buffet. There was barbequed chicken tenders and tandoori chicken tikka, mutton shami kabab, prawn spring rolls and thai fish cake in non-veg starters, and puchkas and corn cakes and many other kebabs were there in veg options. we tried all starters one by one and everybody liked it. barbequed chicken and thai fish cake was very good. There were two soups and quite an elaborate salads and chaats options. we were actually full with the starters but still tried few indian dishes from buffet like mutton biryani, fish in spicy coriander sauce, and noodles. 
Coming to desserts section - Kesariya phirni and chanapora was my most favourite selection for the day, though I couldn't able to try the chocolate monte-carlo as I was full. 
Food - 4.5 / 5.
Ambience - 4 / 5
Service - 5 / 5

We went here for team lunch with a head of 30 people...
Although we mentioned them before hand...they didnt keep seats reserved...so we had to wait outside...in a temporary hall for around 15 to 20 minutes.

After  that wen we started off the starters were ok ok...tandoori chicken was quite dry..rest of the salads were cool..

The main course was pretty average...

But the Best dish of the day was Grilled fish!!! It was awesome...One can keep on eating that only...it was tasty as well as healty...

The view of the place is nice..if you get the window side seats...

Dessert section was quite nice...we can say the best section among the three..

Its a n overall nice place with rangeable pricewhere people wants to go for buffet.

I celebrated my Wife's birthday there on last February.The ambience was truly amazing. Overlooking the busy Newtown Bypass from the large glass window - candle light dinner and good music. It was all high class dining experience. We ordered some north indian dishes like Mutton Gilafi Seekh, Murg tikka Lababdar, and Mutton Biryani.My overall experience of food is average according to the price tag. I have experienced some mindblowing foods at this price tag at many places. Tamara have maintained high class dining but the food is not so eleveted. I expected some rich delicacies as they projected them.It is good for people who have not experienced "Sigree", "Kafila" or "Arsalaan" though Arsalaan is bit less costly.In one line - The ambiences 5 Star but but not the food.

I have been to this place twice.Good hospitality,staffs are well aware of everything dats on the menu.Food was good and also the quantity.The only problem we had was with the Dal Makhani.It was not at all a North Indian Dal and we asked the manager,he told us he wil get it changed.The next one he got was as pathetic as the 1st one.Apart from the Dal,rest all the food was perfect.PS: Never order Dal Makhani here.Its a complete waste of money.

Judging a restaurant solely on Buffet taste would really be partial...still had a mixed experience of dining.
Procuring Groupon Vouchers me and my friends went to Tamara for lunch.When we entered,we were not at all satisfied with the cleanliness.though the restaurant is new,the pillows and rest mattresses were quite dirty including the floor.However I evening ambiance might be much better.
Well coming to the experience..we had buffet with voucher discounted to Rs: 499.We were 5 heads.
After we settled down,only 2 of us were greeted with scented perfume towel,however rest 3 missed.I really dont know why they gave us scented hankies,just after 30 seconds they took it away from our table.
The soup with breads was delicious.There were option for Chaat preparations,however I didnt opt for it.
The starters were most ordinary,with fish finger with tartare sauce being on my fav list.Rest can be skipped.The fuchkas served were tasty,but the appetizers will surely bring your appetite down.The prawn balls served had obnoxious smell of prawns.
Rounds of mocktails were served ,which were quite tasty but on repeated request.
Main course Biryani was quite good,only one chicken dish being very ordinary,polau was average.There was a chinese fish preparation that was quite good.
Rest I did not feel like touching at all.
In desserts It out classes most of the renowed buffet in town with misti doi rabri shot,big hot gulab jamuns,Chhanar cake,another cake i dont remember properly,vanilla icecream(without any sauce).

However the hospitality was nice but requires mire attention.It is really difficult to gesture each time for a service.
For me it would be just an "one time go" and the "experience served" was not upto my expectation.
Dont know was it due to discount voucher from Groupon.

Good food, great ambience, superb service - if you want all these together, Tamara is the place to be in...it was my birthday and wanted to have a nice dine out with my wife...the lady at the reception gave us a warm welcome and took us to a table, the ambience was just perfect except the songs which were misfit. The staffs were courteous. We ordered bekti picatta for starter...before serving the starter, they gave us some nachos with mango salsa on house and it was yum....the starter was perfect, the fish was wonderfully cooked and the sauce was delicious. For main course we ordered Sichuan fried rice and Hunan fish
 Between the main course and starters, they serve you palate cleanser,. Very effective. The main course arrived a bit late and was just perfect. For the desert, we ordered Monte Carlo ... Yummy as well as filling. The only downside for me was the use of basil in the desert... With the bill they serve you complementary chocolate paan, they just nailed it. Overall wonderful experience. Will be waiting for more visits...

Pros: Well located, good ambience, knowledgeable and courteous waiters, lot of complimentary items and the wet towel to freshen up

Cons: Average food

We decided to have lunch this weekend at Tamara. We were well seated. It started with wet towel, which was wonderful. Then some snack with mango chutney. Then came the appetizer golden prawn. This was average at best. It looked good, but dint taste as well. I ll say that I have had better. Then came the main course - Continental dishes: Chicken Paprika Stroganoff and Swiss Chicken . They were definitely better that we ate earlier. The quantity was good and it tasted good. We ended with chocolate pan. In all a good visit.

The restaurant is in a great location. They serve various types of foods which tastes incredibly delicious. The platters are worth giving a try and the fish served their is really incredible. The atmosphere of the place is nice and quiet and is suitable for every occasion. The place is a bit expensive but the quality of food makes up for it. Behaviour of the staffs are nice but they take a bit time to serve your order.

visited with my girl friend to celebrate her birthday, exceptional service and unmatchable food quality. Lovely candle light dinner, started with nachos & dips, which was very yammy. ordered murgh tikka kalimirch and chello platter. Hats off to chef for such a lovely food and also for the birthday cake, which was again a big surprise for my girlfriend. will definitely recommend this place to my friends.  I had a real bad time in Aminia, Chinar Park, last time I visited there, pathetic food quality. So this time I cannot take a risk for my girlfriend's birthday celebration, so I decided to come to Tamara.  
The only reason I couldn't mark 5/5 because they don't have their liquors started yet. otherwise everything is WOW.......

I wanted to go to this place ever since it had opened its doors. It was my brother's birthday, so he planned to take us all there for dinner. 
We reached.. the reservation was already being done and they were very courteous to show us the way to our table and make us comfortable.
Then we ordered  for vegetable galauti kebab and paneer tikka.. as for starters.. 
Till the time our order was being prepared they served us with nachos which was superb.
Galauti kebab was very nicely served and taste was up to the mark.
Then for the main course we ordered for dal makhni, paneer makahanwala, pindi chana and breads.
Time taken for preparation was not too long. 
We also ordered for some Chinese dishes like chilly paneer & fried rice. superbly made which I dint expect.
The only problem which i found was the masala kulcha was not up to the mark.. 
The filling inside was of chopped vegetables which I dint expect to be..
If it was of potato mashed with vegetables would have tasted much better..
Anyways Concluding it - It was overall a nice experience. The ambiance is really very different and unique including the steward's uniform and also the serving bowls and platters.

The USP : The candle light environment created which gives it a very romantic aroma. 
I recommend this place. Good job!!

Had been there yesterday. As evident from the pics the ambience was fantastic, really well done on the interiors. 
Coming to the food .. Ordered the chicken and paneer tikka. Chicken tikka was delicious however the paneer tikka was on the sweeter side .. Quite unlike most places. For maincourse we had dal makhani which was mouth watering, the tawa sabzi was average and the chicken biryani was avg too. Overall the experience was great however the pocket pinch is slightly on the higher side.

The attendant take great care of your taste and try to offer the best food.
The presentation of the food is too good,but the only suggestion would be some more variety in main course.
The starters are very good and the desert is also average.But coming to main course the food is very simple.But overall,my experience was good and I would recommend you to definitely visit the place.

The first word came to my mind after visiting this place is "wow". And yes obviously this is for the ambiance along with cuisines as well.A place for perfect candlelight dinner with soft soothing romantic music.
We booked a place over there. After reaching there they welcomed us in such an enthusiastic way. The staffs are very well behaved and polite. We ordered chicken asparagus soup , foam of mushroom with chicken, Golden prawn with prawn wafers,postman's grilled fish.You can feel the taste of herbs and spices they use to prepare the soups.If you like a bit spicy ,you can avoid golden prawn as starter. But the special continental cuisine like postman's grilled fish is just like "deliciouslyawesome". They deliver an welcome dish home made nachos with mayonnaise and atlast they served chocolate paan which was also tasted something different n that's good..:)

We were in a group of four when we visited last time in Tamara. we noticed this place, located at the hotel The Pipal Tree. At first look, the lobby looked very unique with candle light all around, even the reception area was nicely candle lit. When we entered, the place was done up very nicely, but there was a little confusion regarding the theme of the interiors, although it was very nice and pleasing,  walls were adorned with some sanskrit sloks, nice lighting, but the ceiling had a banquet style curtains hanging from all over top. It looks funny at times but not an issue when we came to food. we ordered Mutton seekh and Bekti picatta. it was yammy. last time we had prawn cocktail which was also good. then we had thai green curry chicken with rice, and mutton biryani. it was undoubtedly the best and quiet a good portion. The tables were Candle lit, and generally the lighting was dim. service was prompt. 
valet parking facility is an issue at times, the hotel front area was flooded due to low parking area, was a huge water staging all over, otherwise everything is ok. I have recommended this place to my friends after my visit.

My visit to this place was solely based on the reviews on zomato and also the pictures herein.  I love the whole fine dining concept so i thought why not Tamara.

The day i visited this place , it was raining heavily and they had no valet parking. But we were offered an umbrella from the drop point to avoid getting wet while returning from the parking area. 

Anyways keeping everything aside, coming to the ambiance. It was superb from the time you enter the hotel lobby till the restaurant. Dim light, candles, beautiful drapes and a huge glass window where one can sit , eat and enjoy the view.

We ordered the char  grilled mexican chicken, the tangra style chicken pepper salt, prawn malai curry and the monte carlo dessert. The tangra style starter was a disaster, it was hard, chewy and we actually struggled to cut it with our knives. They call it tangra style but am confident the dish stands nowhere near the restaurants located in Tangra. It also lacked taste, i mean nothing special or tangra type. Very deceptive name. Coming to the continental mexican char grilled chicken- we were told it will be spicy and i know mexican means spicy thats why i ordered it but i did not find it spicy and the chicken needed more seasoning. it was little bland though we were given gravy with it. The mashed potatoes and vegetables and spinach with the dish was yum. But the hero of the dish was the chicken and i felt it lacked flavours . It doesnt meet indian taste i guess. But if you want to do business you gotta keep in mind the available crowd. The prawn malai was nice, succulent very well done but you have to have it with little lime because it can be very heavy as it was very coconutty. I have had this dish in Charnock's and if given a choice  my preference would be charnock. Now coming to the dessert- the only thing i enjoyed the most. It was indeed different and yum with huge portions of fresh cream and ice cream etc.

The service was polite, courteous and the staffs were very welcoming. The place has a lot of other fancy things such as providing wet towels before your meals and providing this coriander and mango flavored ice golas in small shot glasses considered the palette changer. Before every dish you have little of that to cleanse your taste so that you can taste the next dish properly and untarnished. They also provide in house crackers with this tangy mango chutney. Also they provided with chocolate paan as mouth freshener which was nice. In terms of price it was okay keeping in mind the ambiance and hotel reputation.

Over all it was a different experience for a change. Yes the food was not as expected but ambiance and their little fancy things that i mentioned earlier was new. Till now they have not procured the liquor licence so if you are looking for a wining and dining experience in this place then 
you got to wait and best call and enquire before your visit.

Been there last night with my love and I must say this is a place I really liked. Mixed ambience, like the interior is typical indian style, candles in each table symbolises something near to arabian culture, serves drinks in wine glass, attendants in typically bengali attire and plays opera in background. They must have tried putting all good things together, and its good that it doesn't conflict.
Food was awesome I found. The nonveg platter is one recomended. The best biriyani I had there I must say and the warmth that is delivered is one to talk about. Nice experience. Will be visiting again.

I just love this restaurant!
The food is always good. The staff is superb. The ambiance is Ok-ish too.
We have been to this restaurant 3-4 times. Decor-wise, the lights are too dim in the evening and during the day, if it is a weekend, this place can get really crammed. Once we saw a man fighting with the wait staff for a "Window seat" ;-), which was reserved...this man was left sulking!!! But the service and food makes up for the minus points.

One is welcomed with a wet towel and a shot of melon palette cleanser. A bowl of crisps and a dip accompanies you till the food arrives.  

We have always tried the Ala Carte menu. The non-veg Chelo Kabab is good. The portion size of each dish is pretty decent. Naans and Rotis arrive super fast if you order them in between your meal. The mocktails are alright...but please do not order a fresh lime soda...they just don't know how to make it.

Overall it's a paisa vasool place.

Went there with mix feedback and established my own views. Ambiance and service is very good, before starter they will offer you some nachos with a mango salsa type sauce which is a different experience with good taste. In starter we were looking for mutton gilafi seek kebabs but we didn't get that and we took mutton shami kebab which was not up to the mark. In main course you will get varsities of Indian and Continental options among those we had tried a Swiss diss which was good and in desert they should add more variety. At last the chocolate Pan  was amazing and very unique.

Had heard mixed reviews about this place, but was somehow very optimistic regarding the restaurant since have always been fond of food by its chef, who earlier worked his magic at Afraa and i must say, the experience was wonderful.

Located at 2nd floor of Pipal Tree hotel opposite City center 2 mall in Rajarhat area, it is a bit of travel for many but eventually one would not regret. The restaurant has a decent decor. Moreover i went there for dinner, and the lighting was extremely dim which i do not like. However the staff service was very good. They were warm, polite and prompt. The prices are reasonable considering its a 3/4 star property more so with very generous serving sizes.

There were small efforts which i loved about the place. We were provided perfumed napkins in the beginning. The kebabs, tawa subz were served on sizzler plates. Some variant of chips were served to us alongside sour cream dip before starters. There were melon kala khatta shots provided before the main course that was lovely. In the end there were chocolate paans and i could not stop asking them for extra ones which they happily obliged.

Coming to food, panner tikka kebabs were great, though felt a bit bland but good with a big serving. The oriental babycorn had a smokey flavour and were nice. The dal makhani was great but a special mention for subz makhanwala that was just amazing. Loved their flavours. Rotis were well made and crisp, would suggest them to expand the selection in this regard. The biryani was not exceptional but pretty good.

Overall i loved my experience here and looking forward to more of them!!!

This is the second time that I have visited this restaurant. To be honest, on my first time visit I was a little disappointed, i had to wait for the table as it was a weekend. On my second visit to this place I get the table fortunately.... dim light, cozy sitting, simple decor & soothing music.... 

They gave a lovely welcome while entering their restaurant, offered face towel, followed by housemade nachos with mango dip. It was really good. This time  their food also left a long lasting flavour on my palette. We were just passing by this place and just couldn't resist myself from visiting this one and only place once again. As we did not have any hunger, we just ordered two soft drinks and beckti muniere. Serving time was fast and the temperature of the food was just perfect. It is a complete meal. Truly the food was awesome  and lip smacking. Certainly they won our hearts  through their foods & service. In that candle light ambience I fully enjoyed my food slowly . we ended up with British Banofee Pie, which is a new addition to their menu which I have not seen last time. It was awesome.They maintained their food quality and originality and this is the USP of this place. 

A must visit place in Kolkata. 


A little feedback - the table was at times clumsy, table space was short and too many things on it. Table should be manager in a much better way.

This was on my wishlist for a long time before I could visit this place, great food and even better service. Very peaceful and elegant decor of the restaurant needs a special me tion. 
Could have given a five star rating, just for the fact that the food lacked salt and even after letting our taste known when the starters were served, the main course again lacked salt ( individual taste though). 
Apart, everything else deserves a thumps up!

This place was for sometime in my wishlist as I used to see this every time on the way to Office and from.  I managed to go there with family finally and fortunately the overall experience did not disappoint me although the cost is much on a higher side and the price range is different than what t\you will be seeing in the menu in Zomato.

We went and booked the seats at night time and the ambience was expectedly awesome but I personally believe that a few people who have some eye problem, they might have problem due to low lights but the surrounding atmosphere and the behaviour of the staffs made us feel comfortable.

We had Sweet corn soup and Greek lemon Checken Broth with eggs which personally I did not like much, additionally we ordered Bekti Picatta and Pepper chilli blasted mutton which i found to be awesome. They offered in between some in house made nachos with mango dip and later a Green mango with gandharaj drink in a shot style with ice which was enough refreshing as a cooler.In main course we took Chello kebab and Mexican Grilled chicken with garlic mashed potatoes which as a continental dish I liked much.At deserts we only selected Chocolate Samosa with Nolen Gurer ice cream where I believe the ice cream could have been much tastier and the lavour of Nolen gur was definitely missing and comparatively this was pretty ordinary in terms of garnishing but at the end the complimentary mishti pan was able to compensate the same.

Cost is definitely a factor at this place otherwise, food , ambience and most importantly hospitality wise this place is a must to visit.
Note - They serve complimentary cakes also if informed from an earlier point

On our way back from CC2 towards haldirams, we were looking for a place to have our dinner, and we noticed this place, located at the hotel The Pipal Tree. At first look, the lobby looked very premium with candle lighting all around, even the reception area was nicely candle lit. When we entered, the place was done up very nicely, but there was a little confusion regarding the theme of the interiors, although it was very nice and pleasing. The walls were adorned with some Hindu shlokas, nice lighting, but the cieling had a banquet feel to it. The tables were Candle lit, and generally the lighting was dim, so, it was a nice romantic setting of a candle lit dinner. Coming to the food and service now, the service was very prompt, we had got a table beside the nice glass wall which gave us a view of the road below and it seemed very nice. We had ordered for cheese stuffed mushrooms as starters, and before it came we were served complimentary spicy wafers with an amazing mango dip which was really nice to taste and the complimentary gesture brought a smile to us. The starter arrived quickly, the starter didnt impress, but wasnt bad either, the quantity is sufficient for 2 people, generally we see starters being served too little, but here that isnt the case. Once the starters were over, we were given the main course plate and along with those came 2 small shot glasses where there was something green with crushed ice, the person serving us told that it is a palate cleanser, please have a little, it will give u a fresh feeling, indeed it did, again this small thing earned them brownie points. In main course my wife had ordered a continental dish, stuffed bhekti, and I went in for nizami ghosht biriyani as I was in the mood for biriyani. The food came quickly, and as earlier the food came in good portions, enough to serve two. First we tried the stuffed bhekti, it was amazing, and one of the best fish dishes I have had at a restaurant in main course, my plate was empty very soon, while my wife was relishing hers slowly. Then I gorged into my biriyani, which again was very good, different from our Arsalaan/Shiraz type of biriyani, but very good in taste, the mutton was soft, and yes, it had the customary biriyani aloo, which we calcuttans die for.  Oh I forgot to mention were served a  plate of roasted papads. After all this we didnt have any slightest place left for the dessert and we asked for the check. Again they came and served us a chocolate pan which we both loved, and it was complimentary. The bill came around 1500 rupees, which I believe is fine considering the ambience and service and the quality of food.  Overall we had a sweet experience to share.

After the disappointment at one restaurant in city center mall the previous day of just randomly picking out a restaurant besides the road, we did our research today on different social networks and that brought us to Tamara. It looks very descent, just a new restaurant hut next to the main road that follows the end of chinar park of new town area, the food is simply wonderful and with reasonable prices. Definitely recommended ! We discovered this place today and came for lunch and dinner both. the food is just delicious!! The whole menu is Indian,Thai,Chinese with a big add on of western thrown in the menu card . For me, this is a good sign if you like traditional food. The waiters obviously prides the restaurant and the food reflects this. We had plenty of food but one thing that stood out to me were the grills. I could survive on them.chicken in green curries,grilled fish... I can come back here every day and eat their whole, extensive menu. It's huge. If you like good and simple food without any fuss, go. It's worth of many visits.

The ambience is superb. Food quality & the service is excellent. One of the best places to have a romantic dinner. Its a bit expensive but worth it. They offer complimentary treats 4rm which my favourite was home made nachos with mango salsa.
One should surely try their classic bacon wrapped chicken & british banofee pie.
A small suggestion to the chef if you could add in tangy rice instead of the butter rice in chelo platter it could have tasted a lot better.
Overall a good experience.

visited here quite a  times and this is one of those places which hardly needs a review. An excellent place to go for a meal whether you are with your family or friends. The low lighted ambience and quick and polite service is highly commendable and the food served is probably among the best found in the city. The menu presents a variety of continental and north Indian choices my personal favorites being the Tandoori murgh Tangri Kebab platter and the Chicken Steak Sizzler. There we also had Chello platter, grilled prawns with garlic butter, paprika chicken  which were equally excellent. Overall it is worth for its cost  and one of the places you just have to visit if u r in d city.

I have to describe it in full. It was the occasion of my 3rd marriage Anniversary, so I visited this place after looking in through Zomato. There was 7 of us in total. At first when I entered the place I saw beautiful decor with candles and some ethnic old Indian decors. The ambience is simply superb. You can love this place just at a first glance. The table and chair is spacious enough. Looking through the Menu we were surprised they provided  huge set of options to choose from. For starters we ordered "Taiwanese style hot and sour Soup" and "Chicken Sicilienne". 1 word it was just the most perfect start for a long course to follow.
For Main Course we ordered "Tamaras Chello Platter (Non Veg)", "2 Non-Veg Sizzlers (contains Chicken, sausage, bacon, ham, egg, prawn, brocolli etc. etc.), "Mixed Glrilled Spicy Hunan Fish", "Mixed Hakka Noodles", "Wild Mushroom Foam with Chicken", and 2 Butter Garlic Naan.
Since the order was big and contains sets of all types of dishes so the obedient waiter told us that it will take some time, so they served us Nachos with Mango Dip from the house. The dip was awesome with Mango Flavour. If you think that was an added surprise, wait for it. Just before  our dishes were ready they served us "Watermelon Shots dipped in Vinegar and some other preparations" which acts as stimulating your taste buds so that you get to enjoy the food to maximum. Mind you this was also served on the house :)
Then came our dishes I must say oh my God they were so FULL and SO SO TASTY. Seriously we could not finish everything so we had to pack them up also. The waiters who attended us were extremely obedient and polite. So there was hardly any room left in our stomach for desserts. So then came the ultimate surprise. They served us paan dipped in chocolate. Yes you read it right the outer craving is of chocolate and when you chew it you get a paan with not much sweetness but yet very tasty. That was also on the house. Just amazing.
Lastly the bill, you will think they will get to charge so much and so much but trust me for all the above food and the environment and the quality plus the huge quantity food, it charged me only Rs5,000/-  Awesome price, awesome quality awesome attendance of staffs. Just mesmerised me and made my anniversary day even more special.

We were famished, we were exhausted and wanted something to eat. We had walked up from  city center down the road to Tamara.It is a fairly popular place  and crowded, and offers quite a range of North Indian food and some from other cuisine as well. but we played it safe and ordered Indian items. They came piping hot and were sinfully yummy. We devoured them within minutes and were quite glad to have visited the place,So, if you are here near city center two and looking for some good food, this is a place to check out.

Tamara is a new restaurant in Rajarhat area and is situated in a hotel named Pipaltree.We were a group of 8 people,mostly friends and wanted to celebrate our colleague's birthday.Upon a cousin's recommendation we have decided to venture Tamara and was not quite sure how this going to be.We were greeted with a very polite lady in the gate and we took a wall side sofa.It was absolutely candle lit and it was friday,so the restaurany was a bit crowded.We were served a starter from the house and tasted damn good,even we asked for a 2nd offer also which the waiter served to us very happly.Now the food part-we went for cream of chiken soup,a salad called Bali and chicken malai tikka,an Italian f ish starter,recommended by the server only.All of them were excellent.Only i had a problem with the pudina dip as it was little spicy,but everyone else have appreciated.For the main course we went for continental and Indian.I have had the best grilled fish of my life.My friend tried another prawn stuffed fish and she said it was mindbogglingly delicious.We ended up with montecarlo and mithai platter.My boss who is a regular to other places and a completely foodie,he was so much happy,that we had to call the chef and congratulated him.

food-5/5
service-5/5
ambiance-4.5/5


a very good place and a must visit place for everyone.

Post procuring famous Groupon coupons we decided to venture Tamara, was in my wishlist for some time. Located at 1st floor of Pipal Tree Hotel opposite City Center 2 has facility for valet parking. Not that huge sitting capacity looks cramped on a Saturday lunch buffet.
In starter, I liked the Dhakai Fish Chop with Onion salad, mocha r chop was average but Chili Chicken dry with bone was a disaster. Who serves Chinese starter with bone? C’mon. Kindly note only starter they will serve on your table.
Variety of continental salad and Dahi Vada was good addition to the spread. One will have option to add shredded chicken on top of soup.
Main course was extremely average but fish ‘n chips with tartar sauce was my favorite. 
Highlight was the dessert. Presentation of Misti Doi and Makha Sandesh Shot was outstanding. But the taste was bit sour which will turn you down.
Was expecting something different in mocktail other than Aam Pana which was disappointing.
The décor looks very bland in daylight but looks great during evening. 
Recommended to skip buffet and enjoy evening ala carte. Don’t understand why the food quality and attention for staff reduces when one goes for buffer while in case of expensive ala carte it improves. Quality can’t vary depending on the bill.

The first thing about this place - excellent ambiance and a wonderful view. The white drapes on the top look slightly drab though. Now for the main part - the food. We ordered chilli blasted mutton and bacon wrapped chicken as starters. Amazing for the bacon and very average for the mutton, which smelt of the dreaded 'boka patha'. For a place of fine dining this was not expected. In the main course we ordered pork mexicana, white rice, chicken butter masala and chicken sizzler. The sausages on the chicken were really tasty and so was the chicken Marsala with big pieces of chicken in both. The pork mexicana failed to impress mainly because of the overwhelming gravy which masked the taste of the pork. The initial nachos and bread roll was good but it sounds cheap if the servers point out every time that this is complementary. Same for the rice puff chocolate at the end. Giving something complementary and then pointing it out does not feel good. Overall a good experience with definite areas of improvement noticed. Keep up the good work.

As i sit down to write this review,i am flooded with memories of my last three visits to this beautiful place....my last visit being yesterday..as usual,despite it being a weekday,we had to wait...that itself goes to show how popular Tamara is...
As we were ushered in,the all too familiar decor,the candle light atmosphere,smokey sizzlers and lovely music -i felt mesmerized...As usual they offered with the face towel and lovely amuse bouche. we ordered for soup & bekti piccata  ....its the perfect start to a continental meal,,it sets the mood for the gastronomic delights that follow...the bekti ala diane,chargrilled chicken,  were all great..in fact iv tried quite a few from their menu,and each dish surpasses the next...be it the chello platter, the Tuscan chicken, Swiss chicken zurishoise, for authentic continental fare,this is THE place in kolkata.. 
Desserts are also pretty good, we have tried their chocolate monte carlo which was unexceptionally well.
The Chocolate Paan was the winner for the day.
Service is also exceptionally remarkable, you can just go with their recommended choices anytime,  all in all this is a must visit...

I would like to start with the ambiance there.....It was really awesome....It had a dark feeling though with ample light....The decor was great...The table was graceful with a candle on it......It is just beside the road...so you could see the road view also....It is situated near the Chinar Park place right below the Pipal Tree Hotel....

The food was really authentic and every bit was delicious...But a bit expensive though.....But it was a great experience....
A MUST VISIT PLACE....

Tamara, in Sanskrit, means spice. Tamara is the restaurant by The Pipal Tree Group. Situated near CC2(beside Mayfair), it can be located quite easily. We, a group of 15, decided to get-together over dinner to celebrate my cousin's ICSE results.

The lovely ambience of Tamara can be experienced best over dinner. And we were fortunate to get the fact right. All of the tables had small lit-up candles, giving a soothing feel. The music in the background was complimenting the ambience quite well. The only issue, regarding the ambience for me, was the air-freshner that they used. I am not sure if that's a regular, but the scent was pretty strong and was not at all going with the otherwise delicate ambiance.

Coming to the main aspect - the food. As per as the staff's suggestion, we had order kebab platter for starters. For our main course, we settled for Chinese, and ordered mixed fried rice, hakka mixed noodles, chilli fish and chilli chicken. To wrap things up, we ordered Monte Carlo and Chocolate Samose for desert.

After taking the orders, the served complimentary nachos with mango shrikhand, which was a really great combo. And yes, you can ask for refill of nachos, unlike many other restaurants where complimentary usually means no extra helpings.

The kebab platter consisted of mutton seekh kebab, chicken tangri kebab and fish kebab(?). Yes, that question mark is intentional. Logically, one expects to find kebabs in a kebab platter, but to me it seemed more like a batter fry. The mutton seekh kabab was good, but the best of the lot, was chicken tangri kebab. It was so good, that we ended up ordering it separately. A thumbs up for that!

Although for the main course, we settled for Chinese, and even though most of my family members, loved the food, I personally felt that I have had much better Chinese at almost similar prices. The mixed fried rice and the noodles were okay, nothing exceptional, but not much wrong too. It had quite generous quantity of shredded chicken, prawn and eggs.
The chilli chicken on the other hand was a let down for me. I mean, its considered to be one of the safe dishes, but I was disappointed with the chilli chicken. It was too bland for me personally. The chilli fish was better than the chicken, I felt. It had a thin crisp layer which added a slight crunch. 

Dessert Time. Chocolate Samosa was actually good. Served with 'nolen-gurer' ice-cream, it has a thin crisp coating, filled with chocolate sauce, and a little sprinkle of salt on the top. I wanted to give it a try, and I was not disappointed. Its basically a take on choco-lava cake, but it is interesting. As as they claim it to be their speciality, something you wont get anywhere else (read anywhere else easily), it is a good option to want to try out new stuff.
For those who want to stick to the classics, Monte Carlo is the best bet. Served in a medium sized glass, it consists of a layer of ice-cream, nuts, a sponge cake and topped with cream. Now with things such as that, one can never go wrong.
So all in all, the desserts were a hit for me, although I am not much of a sugar-lover.

To finish of the dinner, they served chocolate paans, which I believe was complimentary. And it was one the best things I have had. A crisp layer of chocolate on the outside, chocolate sauce on the inside, it was actually a 'chota-packet bada- dhamaka' kind of thing. I would have actually ordered a plate of that, if it had been on the menu. :P 

The staff were very helpful and courteous. I believe, we had a wait a bit longer than we expected, but this may have been due to the fact that it was Sunday evening, and with some other celebration going on in their buffet section or somewhere (atleast, that's what I heard)

I would have loved to give a 4, but that air-freshner and that chilli chicken prevent me.

A request to the management, please do use a lighter air-freshner. The one's you use supress the beautiful smell of the sizzlers.

The place looked promising at first. The sauve advertisements across the city made me feel like this would be an awesome experience. But where do I start. The theme of the restaurant seemed confusing. As if the owners couldn't make up their minds. The food was okay. Until our ordered prawns turned out to be old and rotten (know that slushy kind of rotten?). Never will return to this place.

Wonderful candle light dinner experience. Food undoubtedly good. Dal tamara, the best dal I ever had and so is the chicken lababdar. The food quantity is always large to suffice 3-4 people from a single bowl. For dessert they offered their hand made chocolate pan, sweet & soft it just melted in my mouth. Without it the dinner would not have been so perfect.
Last but not the least, service is warm & friendly, they treat you with royalty.
A must must visit.

The menu card in zomato looked pretty intriguing for us who love continental selections. Even the indian and chinese items showcase a strong research and thought process behind the items.

My wife and I finally made it yesterday for a dine out. I must say, the staff was very courteous, and we were seated by a glass side seat. We ordered bacon wrapped chicken and chilli and pepper blasted mutton as a starter. The waiter was very nice in noting down the order, suggesting us few other dishes, and informing us that food will arrive in 20 mins.

Surprisingly, he came back with a plate of home made nachos and mango salsa dip and said, "While you wait for the starter, you can try these out." WOW!
The best part was, the spicy thin nachos went very well with the mango salsa....we loved it!

The food arrived promptly, and we were mad after the bacon wrapped chicken. It was crispy fried, with softness inside, and we savoured it.

The mutton was an indian dish, which I just loved. However, I expected it to be more spicy given the name, so got some green chillies to suit my taste. With that addition, the mutton became more exotic.

We ordered a char grilled prawn for main course. Again we were taken by surprise when the waiter presented us 2 small glasses of palatte cleanser....so that we get the perfect taste of the main course, independent of the starters effect! I could see what fine dining is all about. Appreciate the thought process, it worked wonders. [the pc consisted of water melon chunks in kala khatta juice]

The main course portion is pretty generous, and can easily suffice 2 persons. It had 3 jumbo prawns with french fries, lemon butter sauce (separately given), sauteed veggies. The taste was yummy. We were a little apprehensive whether the prawns will be well cooked...cause our other experiences were not good. But this item took our worries out, as they were really well cooked, and looked amazing on the plate [with a combination of red, white and char black!] The light was low, otherwise would have taken a snap. [and yes, they hv candles on every table]

Finally we moved towards the dessert, and ordered a monte carlo. It arrived in 2 mins, and we enjoyed it to its last bit. Another very interesting dessert was there, which we would defenitely order on our next visit, which is chocolate samosas with nolen gur ice cream.

Again, the staff was very courteous in attending us, and engaging us in quict chats over the expectations of the ordered items.
We asked for the bill, and we were given 2 chocolate pans along with it. We never had tasted that....chocolate and pan?!!! And we must confess, after the pan melted in our mouths, we urged to have another piece! Just to maintain decoram, we did not ask for it!!

Overall, a great experience, and would like to come back again.

Went there to celebrate my Hubby's Birthday. The first thing i loved about this place is itz ambiance, along with the helpful and courteous staff. We were briefed about both the buffet and a-La-carte, we opted for the second. We ordered a starter along with two main course platters. What impressed me even more is that you can so many things complimentary that it makes you feel even more special. It was overall a lovely experience along with great food. Looking forward to visit it again.

I visited the place on a Sunday night, and it was quite crowded though I did manage to get a table, it being the last empty one. 
The ambience of the place was decent though the music was a bit too loud, not going with the place being lit by candles. But I am sure that that keeps changing. We started off with sichuan babycorn which was decent.That was followed by a Penne Casalinga Hot Pot, which was really good, the penne was melting in the mouth creating a very good sensation. The Paneer Lababdar was quite nice, but the Kulchas were extraordinary. I think they were made in tandoor and it was a good experience. The pricing was very reasonable. The only disappointment for me was the fact that the waiter was on too many tables and that was a bit irritating as I had to call him atleast twice before he could respond. Also, the view should be good but the empty construction sites don't really appeal to the eye. I think I'll be back for more. Though I do wonder why they didn't have a drinks menu.

P.S. The amuse bouche are really good surprises.

I guess the best way to write a review for a place is to give details of the positives and negatives,because after all everyone would want to just come to the point right? So here are the positives of the place (could not find no negatives)

-Food, which is the backbone of any restaurant, the food is great with descent quantity which is rare to be found.

-Service, was very prompt. Also the waiters are quite attentive and polite here, serving with a smile which is again a little rare especially in restaurants in kolkata.

-Decor, I loved there the sofa side dining area, which can seat 10-12 people.. Over all it has a nice relax feel with good music.

-Price, Last but def. not the least, easy on pocket which is a little unlikely to be nowadays. For a group of 5 people it was 2400   and we ordered good.

Team lunch at Tamara seems to be an obvious choice out of the few outlets at Rajarhat, New Town area. Mainly because - 
1. It serves buffet at lunch
2. Zomato review is excellent
3. Within Budget
4. Decent place to sit in and dine
5. It's new and buzzing

However I wouldn't say that I can justify the high rating. To me the resraurant presents a charming look, exotic ambience and good view of the city streets but lacks in bringing out quality food in the buffet. The starters were mediocre - fish chop and chicken preparation were not good at all. I liked the soup (Coriander) and the way chicken slices were kept  aside for non veg eaters. Salads and chats were good though one of the chat ingredients was a bit salty (wasn't able to figure out which one). 

Coming to the main course, fried fish in tartare sauce was excellent and tops the list without a doubt. Butter chicken was good enough along with the pulao preparation (though it was somewhat between pulao and biryani). Pork dish was a disaster and was a complete let down after elevating my taste buds at the highest level with the fish and chicken ones. Desserts were the best part of the three course meal. Starting with mishti doi to chocolate mousse to an unusual preparation of gulab jamun - everything was just perfect. 

The only thing I really felt bad about is the response from house staff when I asked for a cold drink to go with my meal. He straight away rejected the plea and kept on rejecting it for 2-3 times on the go. We had to explain to him that we understood  the drink will be outside the buffet menu and we were ready to pay for that. 

I liked the overall presentation and food arrangements. The price is reasonable, buffet is 600/- per person without tax. One shouldn't judge a restaurant from its buffet course, hence I will definitely go back there and order a-la-carte. Which, as per the reviews, is as delicious as fried fish in tartare sauce in buffet course.

We went here on a monday afternoon! Friends had recommended this place so decided to try it out! We ordered for a murgh malai santosh kabab which was to be served as a sizzler but they said they could not do it for the day! Next we ordered for a fish begum bahar which was good and naan which was nothing great! The place dint appeal me the way I heard about it!! Probably they need to just work on it!

We went to Tamara yesterday for a little exam stress busting... It was a delightful experience.. Starting from the homemade nachos served to the food items served. The fish finger with kasundi sauce is a must try. The Monte Carlo (mango flavor) was excellent. The best part about the restaurant is it serves both quality and quantity. The only little drawback was that the service was a bit slow. Else, everything seemed perfect...from pricing to the staff to the ambience.
Would love to try out their continental dishes. :)

This place is located in "Pipal Tree Hotel" which is right on the main road near Chinar Park which makes it easy and convenient to locate. I have been there on 1st of June, 2014 for a Sunday Brunch. Although located off Kolkata, yet the restaurant was quite filled up on this Sunday afternoon. 

The ambience is good. The service was awesome..extremely polite and well behaved attendants. They provided several complimentary like initially they served Nachos with Mango Salsa Dip. Next it was a watermelon prep with black salt and rose water for in between meal and finally Chocolate Pan. 

For our Lunch we had ordered for a Fish Appetizer which tasted really delicious. Our Main Course included Dhungar Gosht Qorma and Murgh Tikka Lababdar served with Lachha Paratha....all of which I must say tasted simply wow. We ended with Sweet Fresh Lime Soda which was equally good. 

I would definitely recommend this place and should say is worth visiting and spending your money for a lovely atmosphere and delightful food.

This place is absolutely amazing!!! i just returned home after having dinner here and i cannot even wait a minute to review it. the service, the courtesy, the taste - all of it was just too slpendid for words. 

On entry they offer a face towel to freshen you up. A sample of their home made nachos was offered while we waited for our appertizers to arrive. A small portion of a refreshing mix of diced watermelon, lime juice and black salt was offered to change our taste before the main course arrived. And after everything, they gave complimentary chocolate pan. The experience was really special.

Now the food - the soup and Appetizer truelly was out of the world. We ordered  Asparagus soup and the Waiters recommendation of Italian fish (i don't remember the exact name of the dish and as the menu card is not updated on zomato, they aren't showing the dish in the menu here either). The waiters really do know the menu well and they are tremendously helpful and offer a smile through out. for main course we had chicken hakka noodles, fried rice and asparagus chicken. quite delicious but the asparagus chicken was slightly on the spicy side of the palate. for dessert we ordered nolen gur flavored ice cream. Again, it was really yum!

We were four of us and could not finish the chicken or the rice so had to get it packed. the quantity is good. ambience too is really pleasant as it trully is a 'candle light dinner' place. Our candle went off midway through our dinner and it really did make a difference to the ambience. the money bit is on the higher end but thats mainly because of the taxes levied. For four of us, the bill came to a total of 2500.

I would say, its a must visit at least once for the pampering and great service!

My parents and I dropped by Tamara for dinner on a pblic holiday and were met with a fully occcupied restaurant.the waiting room is pretty,but annoyingly full of the buzzing sound of the mixer,as drinks were being prepared at its one corner.shortly we were seated.the waiters were courteous and well-informed.we were treated to tasty appetisers.we ordered mocktails,a kabab platter,naan and a mutton preparation.the food was good with decent proportions.indeed we had an enjoyable time,with soothing ambience,delicious food and efficient service.the only grievance is the delay between the courses.we had actually become drowsy by the end of the meal due to the time they took!all in all,a nice place worth a second visit.

The most confusing thing about this place is its menu, they have completely changed it and even if its supposed to have been updated around 23rd of April, the day that I actually visited the place, the online menu looks different from the one we got, which was completely different from the earlier menu (which included several Bengali delicacies) and had not been updated on Zomato yet. Also the menu is quite confused, its neither domestic, nor international, nor exotic, it kind of confuses one that what are the chefs best at in this place.
The Good: Prompt service, faster than I had expected; waiters were pretty helpful and nice.
The not so good: they have tried to create a certain ambience but neither the shape of the room, nor the lighting nor the view outside can create a good ambience, I would rather put my back towards the glass windows than face them. For the money that one pays for eating here, given that the ambience isn't great, the food quality is not satisfactory in spite of the free appetizers (which were even worse). I wanted to try this place out as this was close to my residence but I will think more than twice to shell out so much money when I am not convinced that the food is that great. They have some offers on groupons, they ought to really make sure which kind of customers they want to target and what are their strengths.

Suggested by one of my friend, went there for my birthday dinner along with two of my friends. The place though grandiloquent in style and essence, made for a very pleasant and congenial ambiance. The place was calm, gentle and the lights were easy, which is what I like and probably a very decisive considerations for me while judging the ambiance.

Now, coming to the food we ordered tandoori tangri kebab, bacon wrapped chicken and mushroom ala grecque for starters and for the main course we had swiss chicken zurichoise, hunan fish, and prawn stuffed bekti. I must say the every dish was amazing and leaves you craving for more. The first bite of it just complemented the mood of my day, like it just doubled my happiness and in a jiffy they were all gone. The quantity of the servings were pretty magnanimous though, we managed to cross the line finally. It was a wonderful meal and an eve well spent that left us fully satisfied.

Pros: A new destination in the New Town area, servin' good food in good environment! Very minute things have been taken care of. You'll be welcomed by a lady clad in saree. The dishes are blended with both care and expert handedness! Good explanations on their special menus.
Cons: The only downside is the space.
Don't leave the place without: Havin' Platters and Yellow Methi Dal!

Overall a good experience at Tamara!!! We went on April 25,2014 for a team lunch at Tamara. Overall we had a good experience in all aspects. We had prior booking done with Mr. Sandip Kundu for a team lunch and I would like to give him a special thanks as he kept his words that everything thing will perfect. On arriving a lady greeted us and escorted to our table. Ambience had a mixed decor with paintings on the wall. We have opted for buffet option. After we settled down starters were coming on to the table. The starters were coming a bit slow but it was served hot. Regarding starters, few more variety can be increased as now a days people are more fond of munching starters then main course. It is are improvement as my opinion goes. They had fish, chicken , Mochar chop and potato in starters. Then they had a wonderful buffet spread starting with Lemon coriander soup, a wide, really wide range of salads, with a perfect menu for veggies, a good non-veg portion consisting of Fish, Chicken, Mutton, Pork followed by a good selection of desserts. No one can complain about the freshness and variety of salads that had -just awesome. Veg portion was cooked perfectly so veggies can enjoy their meal and never mind a non-veggie can get transformed as it was so tasty. Regarding non-veg my review will be as follows: Fish- excellent Chicken - good (preparation was good but pieces needs to be checked upon) Mutton- average ( It was Mutton pullao - salt was very less and tasted flat) Pork- excellent Deserts was really nice included a misti Doi. They also server Aam Panna as Mocktail of the day. Price wise it was good and Service was prompt specially the person who was responsible for our table. Excellent job done. The quality of ingredients they maintained is really good and I hope it should continue. Our Lunch ended with a surprise of Misti Pan, Masala and another thing. Thank you for your cooperation for making our team lunch a success. Looking forward to visit again.

Probably one of the best places in the town if you are a foodie. Went Tamara a couple of days ago on a friend's birthday treat, and believe me it is simply mind blowing, be it the food, the service!! Service & food are the things which separates it from the other places like this.. We were literally pampered. A lot of variety is available from chicken to vegetables!!4.5 on 5 from my side and a generous suggestion to all the foodies.." A MUST GO PLACE"

Tamara Restaurant, Located Near City Center II, Rajarhat, New Town, In A Property Of The Pipal Tree 'Hotel'. This Place was suggested to me by my friend whose cousin owns the place so I decided to visit & see how the place was.
Situated On The Main Road, Can be easily spotted, has Valet Parking so very convenient. I visited this place On a Wednesday (23rd, April)  @ about 9 pm with my Family & Relatives, and found myself a appropriate seating area. The place is not that big, Can seat roughly 60-75 People at best.
Now As the place was so away from the basic city of Kolkata I did not expect any crowd On a Wednesday Night At A Hotel, Restaurant but I was surprised to see almost Half the Place filled with customers and during my 2 Hours Visit the place had many more coming in even at late hours.
Service, Nothing short of brilliant, Polite, Helpful, Properly able to handle all situations. We were most satisfied with the service.
Ambiance, The Ambiance Is Next in my list, Classy but Decorative, The Entry passage to the restaurant was very good with decorative Diya's. All Tables had candles on them which was going nicely with the Interiors.
Menu/Food, The Menu was Elaborate, the staff was helpful giving good suggestions. The Food could have been a little faster on our tables but they had Certain Complementary Snacks On Our tables that kept us busy.
The Food Quality was Good, Quantity was also great, Nothing Exceptional In The Taste, But Also not Average.
Moderately Priced Comparatively, which is a plus point for them.
All In all a great experience. A Must Visit.
Good Luck.

This is one good place in terms of ambience and hospitality; dim lit, conservatively designed and welcoming hues of light and shade make it very comfy indeed. The staff is incredibly efficient and the elegant feeling thet comes with the pampered satisfaction of fine dining never leaves your side.
Coming to the most important part of all, the food... menu is pretty comprehensive. Designed as potions for a single person's meal, the combinations are pretty good. However, there's not much variety. That said, you might not exactly get your own combo of meals (and that can be a problem for those very particular about their choices) but what I can vouch for is that, the food that you are served will NOT dissapoint you. Tast, aroma, plating, the works... all check!
The only negative would be accessibility. Do not even think of coming here without personal means of conveyance, specially past 10 at night.

Update: Visited here after a long time and kudos really, you've kept up this place. The menu's so much better, and so is the food. All praises 😊

It was really a bad experience and I will  never go there again . The restaurant / cafe  which do not care about the food prepared by them and prefer to throw the leftovers  in dustbin instead of parcelling,  no way can be treated as a good hotel / restaurant.  We have been forced to throw 25% of ordered food in dustbin -  in a country like India it is beyond imagination.

We availed the buffet lunch. The buffet spread was huge.. Starter consisted of fish chop and chicken fries..both were good. Varieties of salads and chaats were there. All the main course items specially the chicken and the pork were very good. But the desserts require a special mention, they were awesome, specially the nolen gur ice cream. Staff were friendly and helpful, ambience was also nice. Only one con..they should have included a kabab in the starter.

We availed the lunch buffet on 09/04/2011 for team lunch. There were variety of food combination in the buffet including Continental, Chinese, Thai, and Indian. The service behavior and attire was good. However, the kebab starter quality is very poor. They have only one veg and one non-veg option in starter and that is non negotiable for instance if you do not take fish and they have prepared fish kebab on that day then you have to live by veg option only. Most of the main-course items in the buffet are not at all tasty and feels like poor quality. The mutton dish was not at-par famous Bengali "Mutton Kasha" style. It was mostly full of bones without tasty flesh/juices. Chinese dishes was cooked using different sauces but not all of that were feeling hygienic. Only the desserts and sweet dishes were up to the mark. Overall, this is probably not a "value for money" option for a real foodie or someone who care about quality of food.

This place came with some good recommendations from our foodie friends of the locality; so we decided to give it a try for a Friday lunch on the occasion of a friends' late wedding reception feast. 

We did our obligatory search of Groupon, and voila - found a buffet coupon carrying a 150 bucks discount on the usual plate value of 600. So far so good then.. Upon arrival, the reception and service was decent. But what puzzled us was the mix of decor. It was not bad, but I thought that the component did not gel well with one another. Tablespace was also slightly cramped. 

Now let's get straight to the main point. Buffet spread started with finger foods. Fish fingers were good (thumbs up) and dip was nice. Stuffed potatoes were also decent. The Aam panna they served did not come close to a real one. Totally disliked! 
The soup and salad spread was not bad. Has a good selection of breads and some tasted really nice. Tomato soup, Egg salads and chats were all decent. The chutneys added a nice zing to things. 

Main course was between average to good. The spread was a bit limited though. I found the veg dishes better. The stir fried veggies deserves special mention. Non veg section was pretty average. Nowhere, at a fine dining place, have I found Egg Kosha in the menu! Felt a bit funny actually! The noodles, hunan chicken and 'Doi Rui' (strange combo) were average. 

Desserts were not something that would save the day, but were not bad either. If not for the Groupon coupon, we would have felt a bit meh. But even at 450 you might find better places for a buffet spread. Second time visitors felt a bit disappointed also, however Friday lunch is hardly a low hour to justify the downers. Foodies who stay nearby can give it a try, others who stay towards the South can give it a miss. (the management seemed good, they even waived off a broken plate by one of our happy teammates! Thought to mention it, +1 for that).

I was initially skeptical about eating out at Tamara - especially because it is located in a slightly inaccessible place, and I wasn't sure about how fresh the food would be. However, upon a friend's recommendation, I finally tried it out in March'14, and I must admit that it was a pleasant experience overall.

The ambiance and decor were impressive, and the same goes for the service. Time to time, they would keep bringing complementary stuffs like nachos and assorted fruits - just to ensure that waiting for the order wasn't too boring after all. The food was nothing exceptional, but was fairly decent. However, the fish tandoori deserves a special mention here! I hope that they can maintain the same standard over time!

This is undoubtedly my favourite restaurant in kolkata, it was in my wish list for long time but did not find any special occasion to go there but finally managed to go there. I have been there once with my cousin in dinner but this is my first visit in lunch there, they have newly started with a lavish buffet spread. when we entered it was almost totally filled up with guests , after getting table the  waiter served the cold face towels, offered us for the nice elaborate buffet spread with unlimited starters, soups, salads,chaats, array of veg & non-veg dished and good selections of desserts. we decided to have lime soda and mocktails which were also along with the buffet. .Though all the items were good but the best was the dimsums, chaats, prawn biryani, and baked mango misti Doi. . Ambiance is grand, service is impeccable, foods are delicious and price is also within limits of everybody. One will have his/her best gourmet experience here at Tamara, it’s a must visit place for everybody.

This restaurant has a lot of potential and with the city foodies spreading out far and wide it should improve to garner the brownies it aspires for.
The choice on the menu is quite good and varied, but with such a palette be ready to have quite a delay in getting your orders if you ask for something uncommon.
The ambience and staff are pretty good.
So apart from the irritating delay in getting the orders it all went well. Surely would try again after few months.

I went to Tamara's on the 3rd of March this year, It was an unexpected surprise dinner thrown by my close friend who completely redefined my idea of Inter-Continental cuisine. I have eaten at some respectable restaurants before, be it in Paris or Amsterdam and even in New York City. I felt that, if in comparison, this restaurant matched my expectations of a well respected New York Eatery. The food had an eloquent way of persuading the pallet to appreciate the work of the artist/ chef. In a world filled with corporate deadlines and competitive prices, the experience left me content and wanting more and reminded me of the late great Sri Ravindra Nath Tagore. This seems like a stretch however the food was accompanied with great service with a smile and an eagerness to represent modern day Kolkata cuisine. I enjoy eating at places where with the food, the people have a passion to please their customers. I would encourage anyone who enjoys good food, great company and a relaxed environment to try this place out. There is nothing like supporting your local businesses. Appreciate the hard work of our server and the host who attentively checked up on us. The mocktails were a great accompaniment to the meal and the staff were diligent in taking care of our needs. I would love to go back and experience more poetry.

I have been to this restaurant twice and I must say I keep looking forward to visiting this place whenever I am in that side of the town.
Some of the dishes I would definitely recommend everybody are:
Grilled bekti,  Mediterranean way.
Chicken  stroganoff.
Red curry with seafood.
Mixed meat grills.
Spicy chocolate samosa with hazelnut sauce.
An exceptional pre meal starter they give as complimentary.
Good portions and a great value for money. Fantastic,cozy & very romantic ambiance with candle lights.

All in all, the service was excellent and I would recommend people to try it once.

This is one place that's stones throw from our place but we have decided not to go back here. We got reviews from other diners and went there to celebrate something, the experience was so bad that i've forgotten what the celebration was all about. As you enter, there is no parking, we had to park our new suv (maybe that it what we were celebrating) on the road, second after waiting for almost an hour in semi-darkness as that's the decor, our food arrived stone cold. We complained and it was taken back to be returned after another twenty minutes less cold but not warm. The starters were great so we were totally disappointed by the main and we personally don't like eateries that are so badly lit...i felt my chicken was undercooked but could never confirm it as i couldn't see in the darkness. Finally the bill was humungous and added injury to our famished state of minds! Overall a bad experience and one that we don't wish to repeat. Others have found it good, but we'll never know why.

I came here this Sunday evening and had to wait for 1 hr flat just to get in. Parking was a big problem there. This is reason I couldn’t mark it 5 and marked 4.5.
It was my first visit at Tamara, and we all enjoyed thoroughly and throughout. 

Start with a mouth watering Amuse Bouche before the first course of meal starts……

The menu is quite elaborate and interesting. We started with Tandoori Shashlik which came in the sizzlers itself and was yummy, in fact I ordered for vegetable Galouti kebab next as I had also friends which had even better taste and melting too. 

They serve you these complimentary watermelon & kalakhatta shots in the middle of your meals which came as a surprise to me but again they were divine.

Next came the main course...I ordered a queer combination of Benarasi zaituni kofta  with jalapeno cream cheese kulcha and one vegetable Chelo kebab and my friends had Birbali Paneer Handi, Do ratan dal was an unique one with rich taste. Both the dishes were well rounded and filling. For dessert there was misti doi & chana pora parfait which was exceptionally tasty and innovative. 

The after dessert was also too good, the white chocolate puff rice flavored with some secret ingredients. 

The staff is courteous and the ambience has a charm to it, a real candle light experience & good music, a beautiful cozy atmosphere.

Well,after hearing great compliments about this new restaurant,myself,hubby and our daughter visited Tamara.We were warmly greeted with a lady and then we were given cologne flavored cold towels for refreshing.Our meal started with a spicy tit bit which our server Rajib explained as homemade nachos with curd based sauce.Absolutely wonderful ! we tried seafood soup,chicken tikka and a mushroom starter.Then tried mutton kosha, faridpuri chicken pulao and fried bhekti.Dessert we tasted chanapora and cheese cake.In between we were served a melon based item which Rajib said it cleans our palate .Wow! unique and very tasty.We all were completely satisfied and pocket punch was slightly on the higher side.End of our meal we were given small bytes of white chocolate dessert.We spent a fabulous time with superb service and awesome food.

To start of the ambiance was superb, beautiful nightlife scenario...candlelight food..  nice view etc. We were all pure vegetarians and were surprised  to have such good food . All in all it was an amazing experience and loved to go there again. Pocket Pinch was around 650 per head for 10 people which included soups , starters, main course and beverages. Awesome service.

The best part I loved it the in between palate cleaner. A very innovative thought. We were served with complimentary nachos even before placing our order and complimentary desert as mango tart. 
Definitely a must visit second time.

Went to Tamara for my parents’ anniversary and we are in love with the restaurant. I went through the good reviews so decided to call & booked a table for 4 persons. This place was great! I mean really great, the atmosphere was beautiful, the service was charming, and the food was delicious.


We ordered.. 

Appetizers - We started with Thai style Soup, asparagus rolls and fish picatta. They all were served hot and very tasty.

Salad – Mediterranean chicken salad was made with a beautiful fresh salad leaves,juicy olives and chicken was just perfectly cooked.

Pasta - Spaghetti Carbonara - It was creamy with yummy bacons. Easily shareable.
Main courses-Prawn malaicurry and grilled bhekti..delicious! Very impressed.The mashed potato was amazingly tasty.

I love the ambiance with the lovely artwork on the walls. I would definitely check this place out again. 

Staff: Hospitable - Welcoming, Friendly, Warm & Cordial.
Food: Delicious - Fresh, Appetizing, Memorable. 
Ambiance: Cozy - Warm, Romantic, Comfortable.
Tamara is a fine dining restaurant in all the reasons. From the starting point they offer cold towels to freshen up, then a small complimentary starter, palate cleanser and then small dessert,everything has impressed us. The cake was amazing they made for my parents.
There is no way that i could not give 5* after such an incredible eating experience.

We decided to head to Tamara for dinner for my father in law's birthday(nov 2013) after seeing the numerous ads on the VIP road.The decor and the ambience was pleasant and the service superlative.We decided on the rustic sounding Chittagong soup and the cream of chicken and asparagus .The chittagong soup -a spicy broth with clams ,mussels and fish was real flavourful and perfectly balanced.It was made even more intersting with Mr Rajeev telling us about its history.In comparison the chicken and asparagus soup tasted a bit bland.We then had the chicken quenelles which reminded me of sausages.The flavour was good but i felt that it was a bit dense.For the maincourse it was red thai curry and rice.Loved the hit of basil and kaffir lime leaf.We also got to taste a complimentary desert platter with chocolate samosas(a first for me)  and honey icecream with orange cardamom dipping sauce. Tamara gives a platter of nachos at the start and also jasmine tea in between the courses to refresh the palate -very thoughtful.We were very impressed with the attention to details and the wonderful food flavor.
   Hoping to have the same experience again we went a month later for our wedding anniversary in december and were sorely disappointed.The decor(obviously) and service were great but the food was on a noticeable descend.Maybe because it was a weekend or probably because a food festival was on, though not that it can be used as an excuse.We had decided on the same choices ;however our chittagong soup was a watered down version and didn't pack the same flavour as  before.We did mention it to Mr Rajeev who offered to serve another portion but by then we decided to continue with the rest of the meal which we felt also didn't live up to their previous standards.I hope it was just a one off thing and i do get to taste wonderful chittagong soup there again.

The ambience of the restaurant is very good.The use of natural elements is amazing from the stone tumblers to the bamboo straw holders. The service is very welcoming and prompt. The dishes were good in quantity and tasted really good!.Face towels were served. We were served complimentary bites (amuse bouche) before the starters and main course aswell! Not only this but also tarts as deserts. All together it was an amazing experience being pampered by them. It has a menu somewhat similar to Veda (but with better flavours) and service way better than BBQ Nation.

I love to dine at Tamara being a continental food lover. Perfect for an elegant and romantic evening with your significant one. Food is delicious. 
Start with a mouth watering Amuse Bouche before the first course of meal starts……
The Seafood Grill is fantastic with the freshest of produce from the world on offer. The superb Bekti Mediterranean I sampled here are undoubtedly the best I have had in the city and their Norweigian salmon is in a class of its own. 
For the dessert selections, there are Spanish Churros, Chocolate Samosas and Italian Mud pie on offer and they are just the best way to finish a brilliant meal. 
The after dessert was also too good, the white chocolate puff rice flavored with some secret ingredients. 
Mr. Rajiv was the person who guided us throughout our dining experience, the lovely and humble service made our evening a remarkable one, really enjoyed all, a good place to revisit and recommend to all………………

Me and my friends went to this place today for lunch and yes this place is totally worth it ! It is a bit expensive but at the same time it is worth it. The ambiance is very dramatic with the decor obviously. The service is outstanding. They serve you with grace and smile on their face every time. We met Mr. Dulal who greeted us personally and helped us with the choice of food.
Now lets come to the food. What can I say I was spellbound by the quality and quantity of each and every dish. We tried North Indian, Thai and continental and each of them were splendid. Do try their risottos and chocolate samosas which has a very unique taste. They serve you these complimentary  amuse bouche in the middle of your meals  which came as a surprise to me but again they were divine. To sum up a nice place to go with friends and family and have a good time with good food.

Now coming to the food quality. We had one cappuccino mushroom soup, one rosemary chicken and one grilled chicken. It was sooooooo good and unique in taste. Foods were well decorated as well. We also had a free appetizer (a homemade Thai chips with a unique sauce) and last but not the least they gave us a unique chocolate with mouthfreshner inside it. Prices are high.

Tamara is an awesome place to be with friends,family,coworkers..etc..

It gets full marks for its unique ambiance and great food ! best continental food in the city right now..

The starter that are provided complementary are also a delight for all its visitors.Also the pan flavored sweet bits they serve after the meal is unmatched quality.

The grilled fish with smashed potato could not have been better ...as the fish is so beautifully cooked literally feels like melting in mouth.

The menu have options  and are enough to get you keep coming to this place time and again.

One can give a miss to the veg starters as they don't really satisfy your taste buds( as i am an hard core non vegetarian ) but the non veg starters are the once to go for.

Murgh tikka lasuni which we have was really very tasty and it went really well with the unique sauce they serve with this.

Warm liquid chocolate samosa was also worth a try after a delicious meal for a sweet ending..prices are definitely on the higher side but absolutely perfect for the quality they give.

A MUST TRY FOR ALL!

The newly opened Tamara is situated at a good and well connected location. The view from the restaurant is good.  The interior decoration appears to be little confusing as it reflects no specific style. The choice of crockery is also bit wired as you get glasses made of black stone for drinking water along with normal set of plates! Same goes with the dress of of people serving the food! It seems the authority were not sure to decide about the attire!! And at times they look funny with that mixed bit of attire!
    Coming on the food,it's a multi cuisine restaurant with wide selection from different category.  We wanted to try a bit different combination there. So we ordered for the veg "Kebab" platter for starter. Before arrival of the starter, we were served with crispy crackers with a dip which turned out to be very good. specially the dip was superb in taste! Then the Kebab platter arrived comprising of three varieties.  All the kebabs were well done. Specially the "Dahi Kebab" was really delicious! Then we wanted to try their Thai range of cuisine.  Though they have some well known dishes in that variety but personally i found the range is not so elaborate as i would have preferred. We ordered for "Pad Thai Noodles" with fish and "Thai red prawn curry" with rice. Both the dishes turned out to be good. They almost had the authentic Thai taste which could be improved little more.In between the starter and the main course they had served the "Green tea"for palate cleansing which is a good idea and we enjoyed few sips of that. At the end we had our dessert of apple pie with vanilla ice-cream which was really very well done. But the Choice of decoration with Cadbury's Gems appeared a little funny.At the end we were served with chocolate filled with Mint and Aniseed which was good. 
The price of the food is  bit on the high side but then we didn't mind considering that we wanted to try that place for the first time. The overall experience was quite pleasant.

The food was as usual very good specially the galauti kebab.hope they maintain their standard consistently.
Keep it up



----- 14 Dec, 2013 -----

Went to Tamara today after reading great reviews on zomato n I must say that the food and ambience was very good.I would have given 5 points if the service was also on par with the food.and due to the hopeless service our dinner was spoilt. First of all we had to call the captain at least thrice to take our orders and the food was served after much delay.the waiter was simultaneously attending 3 to 4 tables at a time so he left in the middle without serving us half of our food.had to continuously call to refill our water and condiments.and finally what got to our nerve was we were not served our bill even after 45 minutes and was only given when I insisted that I would b leaving without paying my bill so our whole mood was spoilt inspite of very good food and soothing ambience.
All in all good food great ambience with horrible hopeless below par service.

Excellent ambient n very courteous staffs. We had a guest who was strictly veg. The chef customised the paneer dish without onion n garlic for him.the tossed babycorn n mushroom was very tasty.
But it is not cheap, as mentioned in zomato, 850 for 2 is not possible. Also the food was served late.

We went to Tamara over the weekend to celebrate my wife's birthday and I am so glad we chose this place. It’s a great dining experience at its best. The interiors are well done with lovely wood & subtle lighting.

Now about the experience. From the receptionist on the first floor to the waiters. Always with a smile on their face. 

The food is just brilliant. Every bite is exceptional. They served some on the house starter before starting the meal which was exceptional. We tried the chicken quenelles & the Asparagus roll for starters. Superb, lightly flavored. For main course, we ordered grilled fish (in a very tasty sauce, name I don’t remember), Salmon & the mutton kosha (with steamed rice) with Egg Fried Rice. The chicken was flavorful. What stole the show the Salmon (i asked for a knife but the fish just eased off with just my fork).My son tried the Brownie with white chocolate and he liked it.

We ended the meal with lovely dessert.

If you want to experience simple & elegant dining at its best, this place is for you. The food is definitely NOT cheap. But you get every penny's worth here. 


We will definitely going back there soon for some lip smacking food & gracious hospitality.

Tamara is located in the relatively new hotel called Pipal Tree. The ambiance of this restaurant is calm and soothing. When you enter, the strong air-conditioning and the quietness are a big relief. I liked that they gave us a cold, wet napkin to wipe and cool our perspiring faces! The cold soup based on melon immediately served- very refreshing. Such thoughtful gestures made it a fine-dining, yet homely experience. It was my second visit with my parents (after a lunch with our friends, we did few days back here at Tamara). 
Meanwhile the cloth had cooled our bodies, we asked for our starters! Fish tikka was very tasty, especially for the seafood lovers like my father. The vegetable galuti kebab was to die for. Soft, pasty and crumbly with amazing innate spice, yet not hard on the stomach or taste buds. They gave a generous portion as well. The asparagus soup was amazingly tasty, creamy and refreshing...I finished a large bowlful without any trouble at all! The dab chingri was a light, semi-spicy food option for my mother who wasn't very hungry. The lovely meal was completed with a serving of herbal tea in between the starter and main meals...again an extremely warm gesture. In the dessert we tried baked Alaska and the mithai platter, both were superb. We also loved the grilled salmon and chicken stroganoff which was served with an amazing herb butter rice. Throughout our dinner we enjoyed our meal with friendly and warm service.


A must try for an authentic, delectable dining experience.

Tamara is an excellent restaurant at Pipal tree hotel, the atmosphere is relaxed, comfortable and pleasant, a midsized place that serves some excellent, fine and flavorful dishes. 

Try the:

* Smoked salmon Salad is excellent so is the thin creamy cheese dressing which is the right combination just to give a sharp taste along with capers, eggs and green lettuce.

* The asparagus-chicken Soup is the star on their soup menu frankly speaking; it is just phenomenal on flavors!! The creaminess of the soup, the small dash of herbs gives a very refreshing flavor. A mix of rich flavor from the asparagus and freshness from the herbs is blissful.

* For mains do try their grilled Chicken with Mushroom sauce, it is an absolute delight. The chicken was perfectly grilled; crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Mashed potato wash different and very tasty. We also tried a Bengali crab dish & a mutton one, felt satisfied.

They also serve excellent desserts. The prices are right considering the great quality of food they serve; I appreciate for that extra special care they took for our dinner (family treat). A highly recommended place for fine food.

We were in Tamara for our first anniversary. I was in contact with Mr.Kundu, right from day one and the preparations exceeded my expectations. To be honest, Durabari was my first choice but as they are closed on Mondays, and ITC Sonar is a bit far to drive back after a sumptous dinner, I wanted to go some place close by but with good food and service :) 

It was indeed the right decision to go to Tamara for the evening. Everything was perfect ! except a couple of things. I have given 5 rating as these can be ignored for the service and hospitality. I added Chocholate cake in the evening and the team was prompt to prepare and bring it to us when we arrived. We were offered complimentary mocktails and table was very well decorated with rose petals and candles, as requested. I requested for a table away from the crowd and we got the best of all.

We ordered Golden Battered Prawns and Drums of Heaven. Both were extremely good. In the main course we ordered Paneer Chili, Masala Kulcha and Nasi Goreng. We requested to prepare Paneer Chili with chilli level as medium but unfortunately it was too spicy and hot by me. Nasi Goreng in tamara was prepared well. We first had Nasi Goreng when we were in Maldives for our honeymoon and we ordered it every alternate day. 

Overall, it was a great experience and will be visiting again. Thanks Tamara !!!

Tamara is a global cuisine restaurant & very new. When you enter this place, you are mesmerized by the entrance. A beautiful restaurant which keeps the essence of India feels alive.

Seated at a table for 6, the ambiance is very nice and quiet. Not much people were visiting this one, and plus being a weekday. We were attended by our server, who had a smile throughout. Since we were a group of 5, with 3 being non-veg and 2 being veg, we ordered 3 appetizers, 1 veg and 2 non veg, steamed rice, phad thai noodles and vegetables in green thai curry.

Being a veg, would be reviewing only veg options. For appetizer we ordered the crispy babycorn tossed in a hint of sweet chilli sauce, veg kebab platter and roasted tomato soup. Risotto was outstanding and was so delicious i kept digging in my partner's plate.

Coming to the main course, the phad thai noodles were a little spicy to my taste, but good enough. The winner was the green Thai curry with vegetables. Blended perfectly with right amount of usage of coconut milk. Make sure that you order this one whenever visiting this restaurant. For dessert we had warm chocolate Pie and baked Alaska. The pie was the best i had till date and left me craving for more. The Alaska was pretty good with the fruit salad complimenting it well. The service was pretty good with the waiters being  attentive to our needs. I must mention that the idea of the complimentary titbits and the herbal tea they serve in between the meals is brilliant . A total experience and a must visit.

The first observation that I should appreciate and share to you all is the warm welcome at Tamara with a lovely lichi based drink, a very homely and cozy atmosphere all over, the staffs were really courteous, and chef recommends us the special delicacies from the menu which is undoubtedly world-class. Please try the seafood grills, Daab chingri, chicken quenelles, sizzlers, Amore and Chocolate samosas of Tamara. we were also given a Diwali gift hamper which is again a special hospitality from their end. Overall a very good experience dining here, will visit again....

Tamara from the outside it looks Tiny as the facade is not big. Even after entering one can’t make out how good this place is. The ambiance is neat and crisp without too much of adornments...basically it is simple and elegantly done. At the restaurant you will be greeted with enthusiastic receptionists...On the day we went after a shopping, it was a weekday early evening and quite empty. 

We were 4 of us and all of us would end up eating the same stuff so we decided to go Ala carte.

The food part...

The Food is excellent here at Tamara which means spices and has so much that you are lost. We followed our basic culinary instincts and ordered many dishes taking the steward's help. 

In soups I had made up my mind to go for asparagus soup which they specially customized by adding chicken pieces. My mates had Thai clear Soup which comes with shredded vegetables. Mine was undeniably better in taste.

Chicken quenelles were flavored to perfection with juicy chicken pieces. We tried the fish tikka which tasted different than the regular tandoori ones served in other places ....the sweet spicy dipping sauce was very good. The other starter that we had was smoked salmon and this too was delectable.

I love crabs and went straight for the Crabs with chiles...they serve de-shelled which actually stops you from getting all messy..but i love to savagely bite into the crab shell and crack it open like a TRUE carnivore to get the sweet flesh. Thyme scented Chicken was the best i had in years. The grilled chickens were pretty juicy and tasted out of the world. Thai red curry with prawn was both spicy and creamy at the same time making it a good blend. We also tried the mixed seafood grill and just one word, superb it is. The potato mash they serve is to die for and the best i had in other famous joints in India. I also need to mention the mushroom risotto, the steward suggested, was very good too.

We were not going for desserts but ended our meal by having a chocolate coated rice candies, different and very innovative.
 This was a pricey meal..but when  such quality food is served we don't mind paying the extra buck. Will certainly come again to taste the other dishes. Tamara is an elegant place which serves very high quality food without any fuss!

One of the best places to eat out in Kolkata

My girlfriend and I went for lunch today. Parking was easy to find given that it was a Monday afternoon. People were very courteous as they ushered us into the restaurant. The interiors are very well done setting the ambiance perfectly. We ordered the following

1. Chicken quenelles
2. Garlic and Thyme chicken
3. Pad Thai
4. Fish Mandarin

After we gave the order, within 5 minutes they brought out the complimentary amuse-bouche, a cube of watermelon topped with feta cheese and olive oil. Very yummy :). 

The starter, Chicken quenelles followed shortly. 6 of the dumpling like objects came on the plate. They tasted heavenly with the white sauce.  Post the starter, they served complimentary chamomile tea in shot glasses. The concept was really nice, the tea was great too.

The main-course started with the Garlic and Thyme chicken with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy along with a bread basket with garlic bread and some rolls. The portion size was 2 breasts of roasted chicken along with veggies served like a sizzler. The chicken was perfectly done, but honestly I found the mashed potatoes the best I have ever had!

Then came the Pad Thai and fish Mandarin. Though the food was delicious, the portion sizes were so big, we couldn't finish the food and had to get some of it packed. The meal ended with some complimentary pieces of rice crispy chocolates. The total bill came to around 2000.

Overall, one of the best restaurant experiences we have had in Kolkata. The staff was really helpful, polite and friendly. I would recommend this place wholeheartedly and hope to go back soon.

The reason I gave Tamara 5* rating is because the restaurant deserves to be talked about for their quality and range of food, ambiance, service, and price. My husband and I wanted to spend a special, romantic evening in each others company. And since this restaurant is so close to our house and we hadn't had a chance to visit it, we took the opportunity this time. The decor is fabulous, with not too many unnecessary things to distract you. They should have a small balcony that gives smokers some privacy. Plus, since the restaurant is on the 1st floor, the breeze and view is somewhere shabby.

We ordered our drinks, asked for beer for hubby but they don’t serve liquor and the manager said they will get it soon! and we started browsing the menu. Finally, we decided on...

- Tomato & Basil soup and, garlic breads
- Asparagus & cheese roll
- Chicken quenelles with creamy white wine sauce
- Garlic& thyme Chicken

Every single item was beyond amazing and tasted just divine. We couldn't try the pastas as we were thoroughly satisfied by the end of this fantastic spread. But the best part of it is you get to choose what you really want and aren't staring at the menu with a confused expression. At the end we were given a yummy chocolate samosa with hot chocolate inside! for our special evening.

I would definitely recommend Tamara to anyone and everyone who reads this..The price may seem higher to some, but the food is worth every penny. For a romantic night with a special someone, Tamara is the right place to be.

The Restaurant has cozy ambience with comfy sittings... The waiters were well observant & helpful; maybe they took extra care as the restaurant was quite empty; maybe being a Tuesday evening. However; a wide variety was visible over the Menu!! We liked the idea of serving the free chilled soup,. and while we were waiting for our main dinner after the starters; we were served complimentary tamarind flavoured crushed ice, they call it grannita,which tasted great ... Maybe a touch that other restaurant can adapt...
We ordered for Tandoori non veg platter (Good portion size, aptly cooked, amazing taste; Chicken tikka (Chef Special - succulent enough to dissolve in mouth,nice flavouring n good quantity) We also ordered chicken&asparagus soup and liked it. We only ordered Dal Makhni & mutton Biryani which was cooked perfectly but i did not like the salan taste, it was very rich & Dal was great and very tasty. We were full and did not try the desserts. However we were served a small dessert bite and left satisfied. Tamara is the perfect fine dining environment for a quite dinner. I would definitely visit this place again when back to Kolkata, and so should you!

I just dont know where to start and end with this place. Me and my family went there on Dashami night (so expected less crowd) on the basis of my wife's suggestion. I must say we were pleasantly surprised !!!

1. Food: Awesome. The cuisine is truly cosmopolitan and there are dishes I cant even pronounce but the taste and presentation is really worth every penny.
2. Decor: Very nice and relaxed. Although I felt they should get a bigger area as patrons will start pouring in as soon as they get their Liquor License (They still dont have that sadly so for now its Mocktails only...).
3. Staff: Very polite and friendly. They actually helped me pick the food as we were in no mood to have the usual Mughlai and Chinese fare available all throughout the city. 
4. Ambience: I would say its great.

But all said and done i will once again stress on the food. The taste is truly awesome. I recommend Delicate Chicken Quanelles and Quick Fried Green Chilli Chicken for starters and Garlic and thyme marinated chicken if you are into Sizzlers. Anyway, go there and eat your heart out for a very reasonable price...

We went to Tamara two days back for dinner and weren't aware of what was in store!
The entrance to the hotel was peculiar as the approach ramp was so high that my car almost over! I mean why would someone make the approach so difficult. After my friends de boarded the car, I was kept wondering where to park my car. The so called parking lot was already full with ill planned parked cars. After waiting for 5 more minutes, I was informed that Tamara had a valet parking in place (!) and they would soon park our car. We waited for 5 more minutes and still no one came to assist me with the parking.  Seeing the staff so incompetent I went down the approach ramp and tried to get a parking spot outside of the hotel premises.  The situation outside was more pathetic as the cars were idiotically parked there too.
Then one of my friends found an empty spot in the parking lot inside the hotel and I went back there.  The spot was too tight for my car since its a 7 seater and the callous hotel staff watched the fun as I struggled to park the car.  I was again forced to exit the hotel premises and tried to park behind a generator van parked outside. Still no luck and my parking expedition continued.  Frustrated,I took the car out on the adjoining Rajarhat Newtown Major Arterial Road and called up my friends to leave the place and come to the car. Seeing that 6 of us were finally leaving one callous staff from the hotel came running with an offer to PARK THE CAR!! All this after I had struggled so hard for over 20-25 mins and no one seemed to bother/care.
Keep up the poor work Tamara by Pipal Tree!! 
Never going back again!!
