Nice mediocre place for friends but definitely not for couples.. Crowd is just above average but yeah music, food and hookah is very nice.. I recommend do book your order through little app bcz you get the best offer from there... Nice place for big groups.. It's just 1 min from jam house.. Quite difficult to trace the venue..

Rush'R ( formerly cafe loopy latte) is located near Shri shikshyatan college . Went there a week ago. Had bought a deal from little apps. Bought mix sauce pasta , teen paan rose hookah and a Coke which had  cost me  mere 349/- . Taste of pasta was above expectations. Hookah was average .
Ambience has been improved a lot. Lights are dim. Sofa's are cozy. Overall a good budget place to hangout with friends. Value for price is great.

PS- Pasta is a must try.üòã

They Make an Amazing Mix Sauce Veg Pasta as mentioned in almost all the reviews of Zomato. It was very yummy. Ambience was Okay-okay, not so attractive. I didn't find find the behavior of staffs appropriate for which the ratings are low, also the service was very very slow, we had to wait for half n hour for a pasta. There was a live performance going on while I went there which was really loved..!

Rush'R(formerly cafe loopy latte) is now my recent favorite.
Just 3-4 mins walk from Haldiram and finding it is really easy.

After renovation they started recently like 2-3 months back and this place was on my wishlist for sometime.

I found their deal listed on little app which included 1 hookah, 1 veg noodle,1 chilli chicken and 2 soft drinks for 399 bucks. And the reason we took this deal cos usually cafes unnecessarily price the hookahs quiet high and this place is no exception either so if you are going for hookah you should consider buying the deal from little app which starts from Rs 199 and includes hookah.

This place got very beautiful ambience and decoration is at minimal which is one thing I loved about it. Inside cafe there's 2 section. 1 which is outside got swing chair which you can see in the photo section. And inside it got 3 big beds on the left side which is great if you going with your group and each bed can easily accommodate 10 people. On the right there's sofa seating arrangements.

Coming to the food we got the usual stuffs which was included in the deal and additionally we took some other items like chicken cheese sandwich, chicken pakora and adrak elaichi tea. Everything was really good with sufficient quantity and good taste. One more reason why I and my friend went there was Tea and we wasn't disappointed with the tea either.

They play good songs and most importantly its not loud. One can actually sit here and enjoy the music.

It's a very pocket friendly cafe and everything is priced decently except for French fries which is around 180 bucks seriously why? It makes no sense.. Management should consider bringing the price of French fries to Rs 100 or less maybe.

The staffs there are extremely friendly and well behaved so kudos to them too.

They do not charge any taxes on the bill amount which is a huge plus for this place. I will be visiting this place regularly and they are open till 4 in the morning. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I went to Rush'R with a friend a few days back.. It is located very close to Exide in a lane opposite Avon's office.. The ambience is really nice and the decor is cool!
What We Ordered---
Non-veg Penne Pasta In Red Sauce
Mushroom Pizza
Coffee Frappe (2)
What We Liked & What We Didn't---
The food was decent.. The pasta was pretty good but the quantity was a little less.. The frappe tasted ok, but I have had better in other places before.. They serve thin crust pizza but more than half of the crust was soft and not crunchy! Although the toppings were delicious..
The service was decent but the staff member who attended to us didn't have full knowledge of the menu!
Pocket Pinch---
Our total bill was Rs. 850..
Verdict---
It's a good place to hangout with friends.. I'll surely visit again..
