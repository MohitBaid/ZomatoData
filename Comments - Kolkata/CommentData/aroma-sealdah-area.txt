‚óèDate: 23/09/2017.
‚óèLocation: Near sealdah railway station.
‚óèOrder type: Take away.
‚óèDescription: Due to the great location, this food joint does have genuine number of customers. I sometimes choose the restaurant for take away if I have to catch any train.
‚óèItem: 2 half mixed fried rice and 2 half chilli chicken.
‚óèMenu: This joint does not have any extraordinary menu, but they do have the some indo-chinese food available there.
‚óèAmbiance and decor: This place does not have any proper seating arrangement. They have some stools inside their store so that people can sit and have their meal there. They have an open kitchen which is facing the street, this makes it unhygienic.
‚óèStaff and service: They have 4-5 people working there. Nothing special to say about them. Service is also not very fast. They need approximately 15 minutes to prepare the food.
‚óèFood description:
‚óÜ1. Mixed fried rice: This contains scrambled eggs, small prawn, chicken pieces, chopped carrot, chopped green chillies and capsicum. Despite of having so many ingredients this fried rice was not very flavourful. A very average fried rice indeed. 
‚óÜ2. Chilli chicken: Again very average one. But this one was certainly better than the fried rice. They gave 4 pieces of chicken in half plate with thick gravy.

This restaurant is very small,  hardly for 5 or 6 people can sit and dine.
But foods are very tasty and prices are very much reasonable. 
Love the way they manage it..

We had the chicken chow and he egg chow. Being a roadside restaurant , the quality was not trustworthy but the food was tasty. How street food is supposed to be. They provide a generous amount with raw onions and sauces. The noodles were cooked well and were delicious.

A small Chinese shop located opposite Sealdah station, but as it's name suggests the very AROMA of their food attracts every foodie passer-by.Many a times we had visited this place,tasted almost all of their delicacies and it would be an injustice if I don't write of those two food items....
(1) AROMA SPECIAL CHOWMIN.
(2) DRY CHILLY CHICKEN.
These are the two most favourite delicacies for which we had known AROMA for and I bet nobody could give you such tasty food in such a reasonable price in the entire Sealdah area.

Quality of food is very good and the price is less than reasonable and the quantity is also good. 
We became regular customer of Aroma because of their quality, Never went to the restaurant though. We just call them and gets delivery within 30-45min.

A real good place to meet ur Fast food needs at reasonable price & awesome taste...
Ambience: Its is the only downside of this place. It is like any fast food center and during summer days its simply impossible to sit here and eat.
The Food:
The food they provide is really awesome in quality taste and quantity with respect to the prices they charge for it.
Items I tried here here:

1. Chicken pokora: Yes if ur in Sealdah and haven't tried the chicken pokara here then ur missing out something important as a foodie. Its really good with good bit of chicken and taste. Hopefully you will love it if u r a pokora lover

2. Chicken Lolypop: Its also quite good and if u want some extra punch to it ask them to toss it in gravy and fry it and it will be a heavenly experience.

3. Mixed Chowmin/ Chicken chowmin: Quite good for the price and taste is good and a good tunmy filler not too high in oil content but reasonably good in quantity and quality.

4. Chilli Chicken Dry: Quite good alone or when combined with Mixed Noodles/ Rice. And will provide you a nice gustatory satisfaction

Note: If u r hungry and can't understand where to quench it come here and hav : Half plate Mixed/Chicken Noodles/Rice with half plate dry chilli chicken.. It will be a nice experience. Just pack it and take home or to ur work place if the ambience of the place seems disturbing to u..
It was a real life saver during my internship and House STAFFship days.. after being unable to eat due to imnse work load.. Thanx aroma...

This restaurant is the nearest and cheapest eating option around NRS Medical College, Sealdah. They take short distance orders too. The food here is cheap but tastes good. I'll recommend chicken pakora, Chicken egg drop soup and dry chilly chicken. Being smallest possible, they really don't have any decent sitting arrangements. But it's best for take away.

If you compare this place with the surrounding restaurants than Aroma really good Chinese restaurant in the crowded Street of Sealdha.
Tried their Chicken Chowmine, it was good and tasty. Lightly cooked. Also their momos are very good. Chicken momo at Rs.80 is a decent deal and value for money.

And why shouldn't I rate this place 3.5.
Aroma comes to rescue us with its home delivery when me and my hungry co interns are stuck in labour room delivering babies or preparing patients for their impending surgery for nearly 24+ hours.
Just a window period of a few minutes, within which we have to gobble down the rice or noodles with a few pieces of chicken.
The menu is your usual Chinese stuff.
This place serves huge quantities for very very less price.
The quality is just okay and varies from time to time. But I can deal with it as long as Aroma delivers in time!
Love their pakoras and dry chilli chicken!

It is quite a find to search for a decrnt eatery in one of the hustling bustling place of the city. This is one of my recent saviours while coming back from my workplace. Something really worth trying in the sealdah station area.

Location : this one is located near sealdah prachi. Walk towards sealdah station from sealdah prachi taking the path beneath the bridge. A minute's walk and on the left side stands Aroma (although it is difficult to locate ).

Decor and ambience : this a a very casual joint having few tools and wall laid virtual slabs to place your food. The kitchen however is open and quite hygienic. 

Staffs : generally it is a place where parcels are availed, so the staff service I would say is not absolutely amazing. You have to wait for 15 minutes for your dish to be served. 

Food : looking at the joint and its location, it is quite hard to decipher, such amazing food can be available here. I have tried:
1. Mixed gravy noodles : Although not authentic, the essence of the gravy noodles stands upright. The flavour and the aroma alike. Wish it was egg noodles that was used instead. It had chicken and prawns in generous amout. The half plate was enough to suffice one person.

2. Chilli chicken dry - now this was not upto the mark,I felt the aroma wwas missing. The chicken pieces were too small. Although it is a great accompaniment with mixed gravy noodles.

3. Chicken lollypop - now this one was the killer. The chicken pieces were decent with the right amount of crisp. The chicken tossed in the schezwan sauce was quite an offering. Also they serve you half the portion if you so want. This one is indeed recommended.

4. Steamed chicken momo - this one is indeed the numero uno. Being a fan of momos myself, it is really difficult to appease me with the quality of momos. And indeed aroma proved me wrong. The momos are completely stuffed with chicken, the flesh thin and succulent. Although I wished it was more juicy.  Nonetheless,  the momos are really worth appreciating. Although I feel the clear soup served along with can definitely be enhanced. 

Value for money : such amazing food at such cheap prices is something that is possible in India. Aroma provides you with quite a variety in the limited space. Keeping the aroma and flavours intact. 

Nonetheless , a magnificent invention in the sealdah area. Thank you to

A very nice eating joint to eat good Indian Chinese food at a standard price. Loved the Chicken Momos here. 80 bucks for eight momos with ample amount of chicken fillings. Even the covers are light. The chicken noodles is also good, light and tasteful.

It may be a tiny place but i feel blessed that in the midst of Sealdah, Aroma stands to fill our tummys upto the brim. Simply awesome food!!! We ordered schezwan chicken, veg fried rice and chicken lollypop. Unlike the others their home delivery is quicker. The chicken lollypop tasted well with the sauce. And schezwan was yummmm. It was pocket- friendly and 'dil ko khush karne wala khana' as well. Must try for college goers in and around Sealdah.

This place is not awesome, the environment is quite weird. But the food is good. Better than what one would expect. I didn't dare to order anything other than a half plate of egg chowmein, and it turned out to be good. Not a must have, but if you're stuck in the Sealdah area with very little cash and you are hungry, you might as well try this place! :)

Working in NRSMCH makes it mandatory for almost every medic to order food from Aroma.The food is more a necessity than a delicacy and is a life saver on days aplenty.The chicken pakoras and lollipop are rather tasty.The chowmein and fried rice are amongst the regular consumables and are decent enough.A little less oil however is desirable.

Intro : Street side, typical fast food centre, located off sealdah flyover near Prachi Cinema.
Food : Had chicken Hakka noodles. Obviously didn't have any expectations,and that's what happened. Average food, to be had when you are really hungry !

Update :

Food - Had chicken momo : Momo s were pretty good in size , very will stuffed with good amount of chicken , and tasted lovely !
Only thing was that it was a tad too oily
The soup was also very good .

Service- pretty quick service

Overall - Good 3.5/5

A good Chinese fast food centre in sealdah  offering delicious noodles and chicken dishes in a very reasonable price. The gravy noodles are so filling. Hakka noodles are spicy enough. The chicken-stick tastes pretty good. Though the noodles are a bit oily and the sitting arrangement is at loss, I quite often visit this place to fill myself up.

Located beside the Flyover near Sealdah Station , this place is great for Chinese food takeaway if you have a train to catch from Sealdah . Try their MIXED FRIED RICE with SCHEZWAN CHICKEN . Also you can have their CHICKEN PAKORAS for evening snacks. But dont dare to sit and eat here , for the space is damn small. Also dont dare to inquire about how hygienic the food is.

A very cramped place with barely enough space for people to sit. The food, though is a delight. The gravy noodles are just oh-so-fulfilling and the chicken dishes are top notch. The best thing about this place is that it is very affordable and thus absolutely "Paisa- Vasool".

Having been a student and now an intern at NRS Medical College and hospital,Sealdah,I have been trying out almost all possible eateries in and around Sealdah during the last 5years.Aroma is one such small fast food joint.

It is located opposite my hospital towards koley market.It is mainly a Chinese fast food joint meant for takeaway.The space inside is minimal.There are only about 6 stools for people to sit and have meals there.

The quality of the food here is much better than the other fast food joints.The price is very reasonable.The amount is also quite good.The Chowmein is better than the fried rice.The consistency of the chowmein they serve is quite nice.It is quite oily but tasty nonetheless.The dry chili chicken is another item which is quite good.The service is quite fast.Cleanliness is okayish and better than most other fast food joints.

In short,since this place serves quite tasty food at prices comparable to prices of my college canteen,I visit this place quite often and I might be somewhat biassed.But this place surely does serve better Chinese than most other fast food joints.
