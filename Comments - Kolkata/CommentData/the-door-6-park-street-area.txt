Food was good,  ambience was good if one is comfortable with hookah. Poor service from staff.  Main course was brought before starters. The place just opened so it needs some time to buck up.  Also bill was incorrect, but manager was helpful, apologetic and gave us free dessert.

Newly opened place in the heart of the city, just opposite the jeevan deep building. 

Well decorated place with warm and cozy ambiance. Good food and service. 

Hope they keep things on track and carve a name for themselves.

I had been passing this spot since it was under wraps until The Door 6 was unveiled and was excited to have something in this vicinity. It is nestled in a small stretch between Russel Street and Little Russel street.
It has 5 sections with different seating arrangements to cater all sorts of groups. We seated ourselves in the mezzanine section with sofa seats meant for larger groups. The music faded away in the chatter of the groups so can’t comment on that. 
Since it’s a fairly new place i had to bank on the menu suggestions from the staff, which i must mention was really courteous and helpful. 
Coming to food we ordered :
~ Sweet Sixteen- it was a lychee based mocktail that i would surely recommend, minus the grape skin in it that served no purpose whatsoever. 
~Crispy Chilli Babycorn- it was nice but slightly spicy. Portion was good too.
~Pita Falafel Pockets- There was something wrong with this item, either the bread or the hummus that came with it was stale and tasted funny. I wouldn’t completely write it off but it was just our luck that we happen to get the bad batch. 
~ Hara Bhara kebab- it was good but not great. The green chutney with it was fairly decent too. 
~ Achari Paneer Tikka- Nice and soft, would definitely recommend. But a tad bit salty for some. 
~ Mexican Quesadilla- Another nice starter, came with salsa, sour cream and another dip. Must try. 
~Aglio e Olio Pizza- Thin crust pizza with cheese and Garlic. Though decent , it could use a lil more seasoning. 
Overall the food was nice with substantial portion size(slight scope for improvement in few dishes), the ambience was really good and the staff was friendly, would surely visit again. 
One disclaimer though, the chutney, salsa or other condiments that are provided with the starters is quite meagre, so if you are ordering just one starter you might fall short of something to dip it in. Although that wasn’t the case with us, but its just a suggestion for the restaurant to look into.

Had a very nice time at this new place, great location, amazing hookah and food! The 3 chillam shisha was the best, alongside the behaviour of the staff! Will be back again!

Right from the actual entrance 'door'  - to the food- to the ambience- to the staff and managers and finally their choice of music - This place has it all! A much needed classy and a perfect lounge has finally arrived in  Kolkata and wow have they done in style! Qudos to the Door 6 Team!  Highly recommended!

I loved the place, the instant I checked in. The ambience is Top-notch and is a treat to the eyes. The place is quite massive and is divided into 6 chambers which includes a private mezzanine floor. The music is quite good and blends in with the environment. They have got an extensive food menu and dishes are served with pure love from their friendly well-trained staff. In a nut-shell, this place shouldn't be missed at all and a must go for all the Food & Shisha lovers who want royal treatment. Cheers!!! :D

Well. Got to know through friends that a European styled lounge place is about to open just next to Park Street.
Visited the place and it just made me go wow. 
The place is divided into a number of zones. So you can take a place depending on who you are with or whats your mood like. There are separate smoke and no smoke zones too.
Now, the food we ordered was a veg panini, mexican pizza and khowsuey.
I would say we got our money’s worth on all three and just made me be like, next time I am arlund russel street, and if even a little hungry. I know which door to knock

A luxurious yet cozy interior. With perfect utilization of space which includes a family dining area, a dance arena and a lounge area. Friendly staff who don't think before going an extra mile to make you feel more comfortable. The food menu is well-ly designed covering all cuisines for which Kolkatan's have a taste bud, though it could include a soup section. The food will help in making an impact in the F&B sector because it caters both quality and quantity in a perfect ratio. Starting up with such good service will lead to great success. But ya, please work on the liquor liscence asap. Best of luck to the team ✌️.

1. The menu card should be easy to handle. Had to struggle to open the last pages of the menu.
2. If you are charging extra for the salsa dip if requested to refill, firstly you should inform and you should also make sure that you give enough salsa dip with the original order to suffice with the dish
