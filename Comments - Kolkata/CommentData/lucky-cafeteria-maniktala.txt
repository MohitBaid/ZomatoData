The whole rating that this place deserves is for it'sâ€‹ mouth watering food. Other than that the ambience is pretty untidy. Though if one is looking for a quick take away, this is the end of your quest. It is located in maniktala, opposite to the blood bank. Lucky serves various fast foods their Fish finger being my favourite. Other than that the chicken pakora and mutton samosa are better than many food joints known well for serving them. All at a very reasonable price.

If you are in North Kolkata, tight on money, but still want some good quality Quick Bite item, thn Lucky Cafeteria is your one stop destination then!

Located just behind of Maniktala hawker's market! It is one of the restaurant, that is popular to local people! Very easy to find! Just Locate the Central Blood Bank at Maniktala Crossing. Lucky Cafeteria is just opposite of it!

It is mainly a take away Snack Joint! There are some sitting arrangement, that can accommodate max 10-12 persons at a time! So, consider yourself lucky, if you get a sitting place during rush hour! Basic table chair sitting arrangement! No sign of fanciness. Cups and dishes are washed in front of you, so level of hygiene will be a question! But the restaurant authority are bound to do so, as there is no such place is there for separate washing place! So it will be better, if you consider this one as a Take Away joint!

Lucky Cafeteria offers a wide range of snacks! Among all of them, Chicken Spring Roll, Mutton Samosha and Moglai Paratha is my personal favorite! So everytime I go to this restaurant, I ordered the same item!

Chicken Spring Roll - Well this is an example of beautiful craftsmanship! Crispy outer crust, no excess oil is there at outer crust or in between the layers of that crust! Well chopped and cooked juicy chicken pieces are there inside it! You can have it either with Mustard sauce or with simple ketchup!

Mutton Samosha - It is also an hot favorite item there. The demand for this item is so high that sometimes it becomes out of stock during the evening time! The samosha is tightly filled with mutton fillings from inside and crispy fried from outside,

Moglai Paratha - This one is my personal favorite item! Crispy thin outer crust but juicy from inside make this one really a delicious one! The potato preparation that are served with it are also tasty! Try it!

In the conclusion, I can blindly say that, Lucky Cafeteria is one of the best snack joint in Kolkata. The price of every item is very much pocket friendly! If you forget about the ambiance and surrounding for a while and feel the quality of the food they served, them M sure that you will fall in love with this restaurant just like me!

A small place serving some decent fries along with Chinese. Bang on Maniktala crossing behind the Corner Market. Seating arrangement is very basic. So a takeaway is always recommended. Prices are pocket friendly. 

Mutton Samosa is a must try item here.Devil is also good. The fish fry had a good fillet, but somehow didn't like the spices.

Located very near to my hostel in maniktala where I stayed few years back. Visited this place numerous time even after leaving hostel. Last visited 2 week back. Quality of food has been maintained consistently. Particularly MUTTON SINGARA, tastiest singara. Crusting is thin, so it's comparatively less oily and stuffing containing mutton kema is so soft and delicious. Similarly CHICKEN POKORA batter is thin and something special than usual pokora we commonly get. 
Chinese foods are also decent in quality.
Price is cheap for all the food items.
If you are in maniktala, do visit it mainly for chicken pokora and mutton singara.
Located at the hawker's corner, opposite foot of chhaya cinema hall, near to maniktala blood bank.
Cleanliness and hygiene is bit compromised.
