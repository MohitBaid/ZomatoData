An extremely small place located in New Market. We had food packed from here. The place is small with limited seating arrangements,actually it's better to home delivery or pack food from here. The prices are okay but the food quality a big question. We had opted for their chicken rolls only. The paratha was overly oily and the kebabs were not complementing each other. Not recommended.

Small place. Only 3/4 tables r there.. So it z better to order for home delivery. I don't v any issue with the quality or quantity of the food. But the waitors r pathetic. Surely I won't visit this place again.

Small outdoor seated old indian style fast food joint. A very peculiar staff. Not at all friendly and very annoying while placing the order. And if you place a small order you are sure to be neglected

We asked for the menu card and had to call the waiter thrice, once personally walking upto him to request him to take orders. Eventually, a friend had to give an earful, before the person took the orders. Pathetic

This is a small but efficient fast food joint located not exactly near the new market but on Motisil St. which connects Lenin Sarani to S. N. Banerjee Rd (Regal Theatre).

The name suggests it to be a Punjabi/North Indian fast food joint but it isn't. In fact, they mainly have Rolls and Chinese menu on offer. I've always loved rolls in this area and this particular stall offers some great ones. Apart from it, rest of the items tastes good too. It's completely pocket friendly and two people can fill themselves up in around Rs 250-300 max. They don't have any covered seating arrangements and basically a take away sort of a counter. One can order and just sit on the one or two available chairs, that's all.

I'm surprised not to see a single review about this outlet. Let me open the book with mine.
