A professional Baker who dedicates her passion into delivering delicious desserts and cakes. Had discovered Cake by Pooja at Streets of india where her cookies and cupcakes impressed me and later fell in love with her Nutella cookie which I devoured with full gusto at Tastes of India.

Recently, a friend ordered a cake for my birthday from here and I loved it! It was dense outside, airy inside and the perfect chocolate cake one could imagine.

With the rising number of home bakers, cake by Pooja stands out, because what Pooja delivers isn't just a cake , it is her passion, skilled training, and love- that's her secret ingredient!

I first met Pooja a few months back at Streets of India and tasted her Orange chocolate Entremet which I really enjoyed. We kept in touch there after and I have sampled a number of her products since including her cupcakes and cookies.I am quite the cookie monster and I love cookies . Pooja makes some pretty yummy ones my top picks are Nutella Filled Chocolate Chip and Triple Chocolate Chip . I love that they come in small and large sizes so you can take your pick. I am not much of a Red Velvet person but her Cream Cheese Red Velvet Cookie is pretty good. The Nutella Joy and Mocha Love were the two cupcakes I would suggest you definitely try. Its great to see such passion and I wish Cake by Pooja great success .

Pooja is an immensely professional young lady. She delivers exactly what she promises. I had the Nutella cookie two weeks back and it was heaven. Being a guy who generally doesn't like desserts, this was a delectable. Would recommend her to everyone out there!

Ordered a chocolate caramel tart for a friend. Although I'd ordered at the last minute, Pooja got it made within 3 hours. It was absolutely amazing.

Dates of Tasting: Nov 2016, Feb 2017

Feb 2017:

Recently, I was appointed the official Food Critic of Tastes of India (ToI), the biggest food carnival in Kolkata, which was held from 25 to 26 February 2017 at Nalban Food Park.

Cake by Pooja was one of the participants there.

In the past I have already reviewed Nutella Filled Chocolate Chip Cookie and Triple Chocolate  Chip Cookie by Pooja. So, this time I opted to taste the Red Velvet Cookie. 

It has already been established that Pooja bakes one of the best or perhaps the best cookies in Kolkata. As per expectation, this  red-maroon colored cookie was perfectly baked and tasted excellent. It was soft and crumbly and had a thin layer of cream embedded in between!

Nov 2016:

Pre-tasting at Cake by Pooja for Streets of India festival at Swabhumi, Kolkata, 11-13 Nov 2016 â˜º

Cake by Pooja is a home based venture by Pooja Jhunjhunwala who went all the way to Institute of Culinary Education, New York to learn the updated trends and techniques in dessert making.

Pooja operates from her Ballygunge based residence, located near Ice Skating Rink.

Desserts presented for tasting were -

- Chocolate Choux (Rs. 45/-): They were soft, spongy, fresh and tasted very nice.

- Cookies - Nutella Filled Chocolate Chip (Rs. 40/70/100 /-) and Triple Chocolate Chip (Rs. 30/60/90/-): Pooja bakes cookies in three standard sizes - mini, regular and monster, and they are priced in accordance. These cookies were crunchy, rich in chocolate chips and real chocolatey in composition . They tasted extremely nice and can give competition to any established brand!

- Mini Cupcakes - The Panda and Miss Mint (Rs. 30/-): With the base being as that of the same chocolate cupcake, they were presented with two kinds of frostings - vanilla and choco, and topped with a heart/flower shaped sugar decorative. The cupcakes were rich in butter. They tasted nice.

Pooja also makes well adorned multi tier wedding cakes!

Pooja made me the most authentic tasting red velvet cookies in the city within 2 hours notice. It was a monster cookie with cream cheese stuffing, customised for a gift. I've also tried her mini cakes that were too beautiful to be eaten as well as the chocolate orange cake which was actually my birthday cake! She isn't just some home baker making average cakes covered with thick fondant. She really knows what she's doing! Everything on her menu is amazing!

A place where you could taste the magic of a young, budding home baker. 
Her red velvet cookie with cream cheese frosting gave me foodgasm! 
The  chocolate mint-cakes were bursting with flavours, literally made me crave for another one. 
The chocolate orange cake was too good, it was pretty and yummy.
The choux pastry which a very few people make in the city was again great!
Pooja who puts her heart and soul into baking, passionately whips up all her orders herself and she certainly is one of my favourite home bakers in the city :)

Now this is one perfect example of an addiction you can afford to keep. 
You must try the red velvet cookie , the Nutella cookie and also the Chocolate cookie. Monsters are a must. 
Congratulations pooja
