This tiny joint located at bhawanipur is sells really nice ice cream . I have tried the Ferrerro rocher ice cream and the kiwi ice cream. Personally being a chocolate fan I love the ferrero rocher ice cream and it's a must try. The only drawback is that the place is tiny and doesn't have enough people take in nor it has seats.

Went with family.The ice cream quantity is not enough for a person or the person behind the counter was just bias to us. We had to wait a while even when no one was there,the staff was least bothered.And to top it all off the ice was not worth it flavour wise.

Finally visited this place after bookmarking it for so long. My girlfriend was very excited and finally we went yesterday after eating some very spicy phuchkaas.
The place is quite easy to reach but not very easy to locate, can be missed if not looked carefully. Follow Google Maps.
Name is pretty unique and so does all the vibrant colour combination inside.
Only 2 employees work which is apt but no seating space available. No more than 2 persons can order at the same time else will get very tight.
After thinking for some time, we ordered
Oreo Madness - for my partner since she likes chocolates stuff. Preparation is the key here and one must look at it, looks cool. There are two variants of most of the items, Trim and Full. This was Full and full it was. I think it was sufficient for the two of us, which we ultimately shared. It was made of milk and Oreos...lots of.
Hello Yellow - after eating the Oreo one and liking it so much, decided to order another. Again a treat to watch them make. They put all kinds of stuff in little quantities and then bam bam bam. The ice rack is metal so it makes a lot of sound. This was basically aamsatto, real mango pulp, pineapple jelly and other stuffs.
This is where they lost .5 points since after eating Full Oreo, this was ordered a trim but they gave Full nonetheless, which was not cool.
Overall first experience was good but will definitely try another place around Northern Park.

COST BENEFIT RATIO - 4 out of 5. Well prepared, looks fresh and yummy and tastes amazing and a long list to satitiate your appetite.

Conclusion - Order a trim if you are alone, will be sufficient and you can try other items form the remaining amount. Will try Bubblegum and Kiwi lemon next time.

Another key observation was that they don't charge GST currently and the bill does mentions Unregistered Dealer. The bill is created directly from a website of theirs.

(This is an update due to my previous 2 visits to the place. Everyone please be careful regarding this. The person's working there don't know the difference between full and half ice cream. They cheat you regarding the quantity of the ice cream and will cheat you by giving full even when you ask you for half. They then say it's by mistake but it's not. Go and try Creamery instead of this one.)

Ice Ninja is a really tiny ice cream parlour in Bhawanipore but their icecream rolls more than make up for it. The icecream is made from scratch and is a delight to watch. We ordered Chocolicious nut overload. It was absolutely scrumptious and sufficient in quantity. They were quite generous with the amount of nuts they put in the icecream too. Would definitely visit again and try other flavours.

I loved what I got. Ever since I heard about ice cream rollz, I craved for one. Not many joints serve these creative piece.You can see the making of the rollz live before you. Solidified icecream sheets. Pleasant twist to the traditional affair. However, nothing extraordinary. Prices are steep but worth trying I guess because of the array of choices in flavor.

The shop is located in heart of the city Bhawanipur me and my girlfriend ordered one evil berry and one nolengur . The service they provide was very fast and it was an absolute pleasure to watch them make that Ice-cream. The evil berry was awesome and they decorated it beautifully ..the nolengur one was also good but the berry won the heart.. the behaviour of the staff was very friendly and nice. The only set back is that there the space is small and no sitting arrangements are made :( . Otherwise it is must visit for the ice-cream lovers

It it's a quirky name. A small shop serving amazing options for freeze cream rolls. You watch your flavor constructed in front of you, so that is sure fun. The taste is brilliant. They have certain out of the box items, if which the Old School Bourbon Biscuit option was great. The service is fine. The disadvantage is small space, no seating arrangement, not more than 4 people can visit this place at a time unless you are willing to await outside. Which is not possible in the Kolkata heat. So it is very limited in that sense.
The pocket pinch is fine. Depends on your choice of flavor. I hope they extend soon.

The beauty of ice ninja lies in its novelty of making ice cream rolls. The process of making outperforms the taste of the ice-cream. We had nuts overload, Evil berries and pound cake with mango. Nuts overload was yummy but the crispness of the nuts were missing. Pound cake was sublime. Evil berries were a tad bit sour for our taste buds. Good place for take away ice cream rolls

A very small ice-cream parlour beside Sharma Tea near Bhawanipore. Good quality flavours, had oreo madness and Orangy fudge, both were super tasty and amazing. Only thing wrong with this place is their very small sized place which cannot accommodate if you go in a group, so yeah space crunch is there or else this place is very good when it comes to the ice-cream rolls they serve.

Nice concept of instant ice cream rolls in various flavors.
Waiting time is more in rush hours.
No sitting area.
U need to get your ice cream n move out so that others get a chance.
Very small counter.
But taste of ice cream overshadows the ambience.
My favorites are After Eight, Nuts over brownie
And pan fusion

Price is reasonable. 
A small cup costs 90 whereas large one Costs 150.

Located beside sip & sandwich and Nick Nack in Bhawanipore, is a very small place called Ice Ninja. The place is so small that if you get a chance to even stand there, you are lucky.
You can't go there in a group and accomodate everyone inside. (Personal experience) 
But the ice cream making technique is unique. They don't mix ice cream, but the make an ice cream right in front of your eyes. They have two bases, milk and water. There is a good range of flavours available. 
Hello Yellow has a good punch of mango and sweet flavour of pineapple, altogether making it a good combination.
Oreo Madness is simply frozen Oreo biscuit. Even Oreo lovers would not feel amazed by it.
Evil Berries was the best out of all. It had a great combination of 3 famous berries. Tangyness in it was the best part. 
La banana was a big disappointment. Being a Nutella lover, I was keen on trying it. But the taste was nothing near to my expectations.
Finally, we wanted to try something different, so we tried Strawberry Lemon Sorbet. They used strawberry, lemon syrup and water to make the ice cream. The lemon essence made it taste different but there was too much of lemon in it which overpowered the other ingredients. 
Overall it's a worth a try. But not worthy enough to come again. 
PS - The process of making the ice cream rolls and making a Snapchat story of it is a big reason to come here.

My daughter took us there after dinner, it is a small place Bhawanipore jain Mandir. I really liked Caramel Salted Ice Cream, the server made it right in front of us. It was delicious. Wish they had a bigger place where one could sit and eat.

It is a very small shop with no seating arrangements but the ice cream they serve is heavenly! We had the Ferrerolicious and the Ice Cream Cake with Pineapple. They make the icecream right in front of you and the cake and waffles are all made by them itself.

Ice Ninja is a new kid on the block. Just choose your flavour and the person makes it in front of you. And as the name suggests its Ninja at work who makes you your ice cream. We ate Salted Caramel, La Banana and Holy Berry. I loved Salt Caramel which was recommended by my cousins. And Holy Berry which has Basil and Strawberry was refreshing. La Banana had nutella and banana, I felt the Nutella was less compared to banana, taste could have been better. Overall had a good experience at Ice Ninja.

Simply amazing!! They have really creative combinations and flavours but the thing that sets them apart is the way the ice cream is made in front of your eyes! The process makes the ice cream so smooth and creamy, it's like a celebration for your taste buds.. you'll never want to have regular ice cream again!

Location: situated close to the backside of forum mall, in a lane.

Food and service: we ordered for two different flavours of ice cream. One is salted caramel, one is evil berry and oreo madness. My personal favourite out of those three is salted caramel. I was always fond of salted caramel from the very beginning.

Would come here again!

This ice cream parlour is one of the sweetest parlour in the city surely which offers freshly made natural ice cream rolls of all exotic flavours..

Its a must must try for all the ice cream lovers as this innovative parlour will really satisfy you well.

This place looks small from outside but it really offers some good delicacies which can uplift your mood anytime!

Ice ninja is right opposite Anita medical store and next to sharma dhaba..

The location is quite convenient too and the ice-creams are priced well too..

The famous ice cream flavours here are Evil berry ,ferrolicious, meetha paan and mojito.

The speciality of this place is that the ice creams are freshly carved right in front of you with all the fresh ingredients used and you can get the natural taste of flavours in your ice-creams quite evidently.

A must must try for all the ice cream lovers

Have a look at the deserts here and the ambience too..

Happened to go to ice ninja when my younger sibling held us at gunpoint to go to the new ice cream store, we obliged and went ahead. 

Ice Ninja is located near the famous "nik nak" store in bhawanipur. Ice ninja is a very small store, 5 of us entered the store and it was full. The owner was present at the store and helped us in choosing what we'd like to eat, we ordered the ferrerolicious and the salted caramel. The specialty about these ice creams are in 3 things:
1. The way they're made, the ingredients are laid on a cold plate which freezes them and then they're made into rolls and served to the customer 
2. They taste incredible and are very very light on the palate, most ice creams have a thick texture to them but not these ones 
3. The waffles cone, this is the absolute best! I've never had a crispier waffle cone! Man! That was bloody awesome, I can't get over it! 

Overall, great place, the owner is a nice fellow, the ice cream is good, the price isn't too high and their waffle cone is to die for!

Follow us on Instagram for photos of places I visit :D (same name as here)

I had been waiting for Ice Cream Rolls to hit the Kolkata market and came across this place by accident, its at the sides of one of the inner lanes of Bhawanipur and very easy to miss. The store was barely a week old when we went there sometime last week.
We ordered a Banana Crunch and Salted Caramel and they both tasted great. They were just the right amount of frozen and melt in your mouth in seconds and you can taste every ingredient. The service is quick and the quantity is good too. And the live ice cream making is awesome to watch.

One of the better quality and hand made ice creams I have had in Kolkata.... Not giving 5 on 5 only because its very small place with no sitting place.. I need more time and peace to enjoy these delicious ice creams... :)

Ice-Ninja may look like the ordinary but looks can be deceptive! I chose to have Evil berries for this Halloween month and it was absolutely delicious. I couldnt stop at just one! 

 I am always on a lookout for a healthy bite and Ice Ninja was a perfect spot. Its probably the only ice-cream joint that serves dairy-free, chemical and preservative free ice-cream which is low on sugar yet amazing to eat! I was awestruck by the diverse menu and the live ice-cream making. 

The ingredients are fresh, natural, home-made and naturally sweetened using fruits or vegetables. Now who would have thought that one could actually step into a healthy ice-cream joint!?

 Love this place!!

An intensely flavoured premium icecream . melts in the mouth and is very light. Being an icecream lover since childhood, I had always waited for a joint like iceninja in kolkata.Its hard not to fall in love with the frozen treat it has to offer. The good quality of ingredients is surely a thing to mention.The thin layers are rich and creamy. the kids loved till the last bite. Would love to keep visiting..
