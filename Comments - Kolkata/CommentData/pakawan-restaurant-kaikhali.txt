Not bad for a local restaurant though limited number of places to choose from around the locality. Home delivery is available and reasonably quick. Chinese items are decent. Pricing is also reasonable.

Local restaurant! Place is always empty!
But I have them do home delivery to my door! I think evryone here does it! The restaurant is quite small thats why its empty! The food is really good for such low prices!

How could I miss my local area restaurants. It always stays empty and low quality food. It is actually a place of ADDA for local club boys. Take my advise as I am residing in kaikhali since I was born, all the restaurants in kaikhali are of low quality
