Decent place with okay kind of foods. One can try their Non-Veg starter platter which is just about fine. It consists of a crispy fried chicken and a fried chicken leg piece. Crispy fried chicken is delicious and the fried chicken leg piece was alright. However their fish fry and fish fingers are pretty bad. Please steer clear from them.

Visited the restaurant yesterday. Had Dry chili chicken and Chicken chow.  Food was great taste and without dalda. Price is an excellent wow!!  Surely the most economical in South Kolkata.  Management is extremely friendly and warm.  Wish them best of luck..

Visited the place yesterday. Was not sure about the food but based on a friend's suggestion ordered one plate of Awesome's special chicken pasta and rice and chicken combo. To my pleasent surprise the food was fantastic both in quality and quantity.  I wish mgmt add some more menus to their continental offerings..

I had ordered the egg & chicken fried rice, egg & chicken noodles along with chilli chicken and chilli fish... I had thought of giving my sister some surprise on a spl day and instead I got some bland tasteless rice, pretty chewy and hard to even cut chicken in some sweet sauce...the noodles weren't bad and though the sauce of the fish was quiet sweet the fish tasted good...she complained very much but atleast the quantity was good enough to get us filled up...I am really dissapointed in the fact that they forgot to put any chicken in the fried rice and gave one piece less chicken in the chilli chicken...I thank them for ruining a very nice evening for both of us...I am not returning or recommending it to anyone untill they work on their flaws...

Wasn't quiet a good experience but just above average. 
Ambiance:5.5/10

Not for hygiene cautious foodies.
Service 5/10

Food: Veg Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken (Combo Rs 75)

Rice(4/10): Scores for the quantity and not quality. The rice used is what we eat at home regularly. Thus, it didn't blend with the ingredients, the rice itself was flavorless. Quantity can serve 2. Go for the noodles.

Chilli Chicken(6.5/10): 3 pieces in the combo, 1 small, 2 bigger size. Very thin coating, thick piece of chicken. Tastes decent but it was sweet! I expect Chilli Chicken Gravy to be at least spicy but it was very sweet! Will inform them next time.

Placed one order with this restaurant in the month of May 2017 through Swiggy. Firstly they forgot to send the ordered Chicken cutlet. On contacting by phone the owner expressed dismay and said his wife was in the restaurant  and he didn't know what was going on. So I had to put quite a bit of effort to get my refund from Swiggy for that item. 

Moreover the non veg chow and fried rice had very little garnishings on them. Only the egg roll was decent in size. The only bright spot that I can think of was that the owner appeared very apologetic. Nevertheless with the present state of affairs if he wants to get repeat customers then the owner has to re-evaluate all aspects of its operations. In short he has to again built it up from scratch. Anyway good luck with the owner's entrepreneurial venture.

The worst experience it was. In prawn noodles have hardly 4 pieces of prawn. The food quality is the worst. Devil looks like 'sandesh'. The owner don't even know English language, although the customer has filled the allergic column of ordering food, they don't even care about that messages,and lastly but not the least they didn't produce any money receipt.

There's no point on spending too many words on a restaurant that doesn't deserve more than 1/5 rating in my opinion. The order I placed with them included Egg gravy noodles,egg devil, lachcha paratha, chilli paneer, and corn&cheese fritters(they had a slightly different name for it-please see images attached with the review). 
I will highlight the following points.

1.Egg gravy noodles hardly resembled Chinese cuisine. It was spiced up like  dal makhani at a Rajasthani wedding.
2. Their egg devil is basically egg chop with 1/2 egg at the cost of 15 bucks each.
3.They serve plain paratha as lachcha paratha. The specific mould of 'lachcha' is unknown to them.
4.Corn and cheese fritters had no corn. In place of cheese they gave some grated poppy(posto).
5. To top all that, they delivered 6 pieces of paneer instead of 7 as mentioned in their online ordering menu. Luckily, I had ordered via app, and on hearing my plight, they were generous enough to refund a portion of my bill.

'Nuff said.
