Well a disaster of fries with a hybrid name of Butter Chat Masala fries that I received and immediately dumped in the trash. I'll recommend not to go for it and especially if you are among the smoothie or shake lovers please don't spoil your taste as I ordered two smoothie both turned out to be mediocre and tasted like some cheap milk shake from streets. I don't have any personal grudge on the restaurant but the kind of food they delivered was pretty upsetting. Improve your quality and automatically this review will wipe out. For other foodies I would say don't go for these as they were not good rest you can explore other menus offered by this restaurant.

Going through new delivery outlets on Zomato I came across this outlet. As the name is very fascinating plus it is an all delivery outlet so I decided to order food from here. 

I ordered Mumbai Chowpatty Sandwich and Pasta Italiano. The pasta was well cooked and tasted nice. It was loaded with exotic vegetables. Mumbai Chowpatty Sandwich was nothing extra ordinary. I expected it to be a Sandwich with potato filling and cheese. However, it turned out to be a vegetable sandwich (comprising potato, cucumber, capsicum and tomorrow) with mayonnaise. The bread was well toasted. 

The food was very clean and hygienic. Overall a good place. I would recommend this place. Stay tuned for more must try items !!
