I visited here two times, in office parties.
We always had buffet dinner with drinks.
I can't say about the price of foods and beverages as I didn't need to pay üòã
Whatever
Ambience is very good.
Dj always plays bollywood masala songs which will force you to dance on the dance floor.
There are various gaming options like bowling, snooker etc.
But... Yes... But the food here is very average.
I didn't like any of their foods in buffets.

Will try once for a la carte...I hope it won't disappoint me.

Where : nicco park 

Review : went for my office party here. No comments on the food menu as they were pre decided by management. Be it the paneer Starter with thick coating or chicken starter with loads of soya sauce. The main course also did not contain anything worth to be mentioned in terms of taste. The Mustered fish and the jalebi are the only two items I ate property ( I like) here.

Went for office team dinner,the entire ground floor was booked.Enjoyed bowling,snooker,these are high time stress busters. Starters were available-paneer,babycorn,chicken n fish accompanied by unlimited booze.We also grooved at the dance floor.

For dinner,we had kashmiri pulao,tandoori roti,butter nan,dal makhani,chicken,baked fish,gulab jamun.Dinner was qualitatively pretty good.

Nice place besides nicco park, to spend couple of hours with a game of bowling or two. They have a  nice rooftop area also. Food and drinks are moderately priced, though options are few. Overall nice place to hangout.

Went there for my birthday lunch. The place was empty since it was a bit early. Located just near nicco park and above nicco super bowl. We ordered veg Shanghai fried rice with veg Manchurian. both were delicious and the quantity was sufficient for 2 people. Now coming to the staff and service , staffs were very cordial ,they even let us sit for an hour because we were done early and super bowl opens at 2pm. Service was also quick .Just loved the place. A must visit.

They have a amazing rooftop for a cozy party. Place is perfect for a gathering of 50-60 people. Food is awesome and the service is impeccable. All my invities really liked the party and food. I would highly recommend the place. Price is also very reasonable. All the snacks were served hot and in plenty. Main course was also very good.

Bowlers' Den is not for foodies. It's ambience is not great and does not feel sporty too. The food is not upto the mark and the bar counter is also empty. Although it is moderately good place for hanging out with friends with a pint beer, that's it.

Bowlers den is a veteran destination for the people who loves to chill and booze. I landed up here some times back for few minutes to meet a friend. While I was at a conversation with him we took some food to munch on and my friend took some hard drink.

The best part is they have various offers available on the hard drinks and it's quite lucrative for the people who only concentrates on the drinks. Food quality and taste is mediocre nothing extra ordinary. Service is really quick though. Liked the simple ambiance inside.

Great Bargain for office parties !!! We had a booking of around 60 with a buffet spread and soft drinks + mocktails...

They gave us a good deal on per head cost and 2 bowling rows + 2 Pool Tables and exclusive access to dance floor with in house DJ. Flexibility on bill splits and multiple amex payments also offered. So full marks on customer service as the buffet serving staff were also very courteous.

The food was nothing great but the Chinese starters were tasty. The food tasted fresh and cooked with good intent but it did lack the finesse of a good Indo Chinese restaurant. The drinks and mocktails were passable...

We had a great time bowling and dancing with friends. The DJ was not up to the mark and refused to play any requests...so we had to do with what we had.

The place is not well lit and needs a renovation and a new theme. There is ample parking space outside.

Enjoyed but not sure if I'll be visiting with family. Good place to hangout during Friday evenings for college and young office goers in the salt lake area !!!

Dropped in after an wildly pleasant time at Wet-o-Wild on June 16th. The place is quite quiet around 5 30 PM or so. Gives yummy and pocket-friendly happy hour packages. My friend and me ordered 3 drinks and were given a choice to have any one non veg starter. And we could also order 2 veg and 2 non veg starters for only Rs. 400!!! The price of drinks is as it is in most places. The taste of the food was totally great. And the portions good. While inquired if they have a smoking area, I was pleasantly surprised to find a totally open roof top surrounded by palms overlooking the entire Wet-o-Wild. We spent a very long time from 5 30 PM till they were waiting for us to leave.. Ha ha.. The music inside was very tasteful. The staff cordial and helpful and friendly. This was my first visit and loved it. And been here a 2nd time too.¬†

Here's what we ordered-- Loved the US Pepper Corn, Mongolian chicken, Cajun Friend Fish, Fish Gold Rings, Shanghai Sticks the rest I was too swooning in the taste and the music to remember ;-)

And I deleted some good 20-30 pictures which I had taken in their new establishment around a month back! This place and I go a long long way back! I remember how me and my friends used to bunk school and land up in Nicco Super Bowl to spend the entire day! This was some 12-13 years back. Nicco Park had a promotional card for Rs. 500/- valid for an entire day which gave 50% concession on the unlimited package at Nicco Super Bowl along with other facilities which could be availed at Nicco Park including free entries and some free rides.

Speaking of location, although virtually there hasn't been much of a change, this restaurant did see a shift in its position. Previously this was located beside Nicco Super Bowl, much on the corner plot where the present CCD and KFC stands! We would visit there every day for our meal and had our own set of fixed items to order. Chicken Fried Rice with Chicken Tikka Masala. Much weird, as it may sound, the combination was delicious and we had no regrets gorging on the sumptuous meal before going back to the pool tables and the bowling alley. As it included numerous visits in any given week, all of us were familiar to the waiters serving there and thus we enjoyed a very cordial and friendly relation.

Even, a month back when I visited Nicco Super Bowl after good 5-6 years, it felt like I was back home. The staffs did not forget us a single bit and we were back reminiscing some of our past memories soaking ourselves in the little drops of nostalgia. Coming to the present status of Bowler's Den, this one has have a complete changeover or as we sometimes technically say, Business Process Re-engineering. The restaurant is now placed on the first floor or Bowler's Den. You need to take stairs to reach the restaurant. The stairs aren't much comfortable to find and is much on the steeper side.¬†

The interiors totally exhibit a typical bar kinda place. Dim and lacking lights, this is where you would probably have a sip of Vodka along with a puff of Classic while biting in some Kebabs as 'Chakhna'! I was much delighted to visit a familar place after a long time and took my own sweet 'pause' to scour the menu card. It should be told, that even though I had requested for the refurbished menu card at their official page in Facebook, the same wasn't put up, much to my dismay! After a lot of 'if's and but's, I decided to go for Chicken Patiala (? Perhaps; no menu, so can't really recollect the name). It wasn't exactly included in the menu. The person attending to me suggested this. It had a beautiful and tasty red gravy, not in the likes of Tikka Masala, but something towards the Patiala type. The chicken pieces were huge and resembled well marinated and well tandoored Kebabs! To go with this, I went for Nun! The Nun was probably made of Maida and hence was quite on the crispy side. The size however was disappointingly small.

For Kebabs, I decided to go for one Fish Kebab which was supposedly marinated with cream, cashews and nuts. It was on the lighter side, yet had a distinctive flavor of its own. The fish was fresh and fluffy (Bhetki perhaps), The staffs appeared a bit under-trained to me and requires a lot of grooming! The new menu is quite diverse and widespread! I wanted to review this restaurant taking my own sweet time, but unfortunately the page was taken off Zomato for some reason and disappointingly I deleted all the pictures I had kept with myself! Nevermind, this probably gives me one more reason to put up a visit here once again, may be sometime soon! :-)

Ambience is just nice. Simple and without any noice. Good part is that they have a open rooftop where you can smoke with the drinks.

Positive is drinks rate is low also they privide corp discount on the menu price.

Continental menu is good. 

Can opt for regular visit.


Cons is their stuff and service. They really need to improve the service and change the service boys.
