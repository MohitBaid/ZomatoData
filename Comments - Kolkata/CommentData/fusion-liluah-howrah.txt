Thd food was not worth it .   fIRST time  I have seen a noodle which has haldi in it. I ordered babycorn which was nice , I also ordered fried rice which seemed more of a Pulao

It's a nice place for casual dining . Ordered veg schezwan noodles, chilli babycorn and cold coffee with ice cream..everything was nice . I like the ambience because  it's  not that crowded.

Not at all good.
The only avg thing about this place is its name.
Food is not apt.
Service is not apt.
Ambiance spoiler.
Waste of time nd money.
Better to just void this place.

This place. Oh! This place serves the best vegetarian food in Liluah. Fusion, this hygenic and purely veg restaurant lies on the G.T. Road. We ordered: 1. Shezwan Rice - Chinese dish, spicy enuf, well tasted.
2. Paneer Manchurian- Chinese, saucy-dipped paneer. 
The food was well tasted and it was along with great hospitality.

Fusion Liluah is a good place to sit and relax as it is not so crowded.. Heaven for vegetarians as we don't have much option for veg restaurants at Liluah... Food is average.. Ordered paneer malai tikka, Kashmiri pulao, shahi paneer, salad, butter naan, malai kofta... Ended with butterscotch ice-cream.
Note: The thing I liked is the paneer tikka and disliked the behaviour of staff members....

It's a Pure vegetarian restaurant üç¥.  I have been there for lunch with my mom after my exam. Foods are average in taste. Vegetarians must visit this place.
