This little food joint is located near Dada boudi Restaurant. Tried their Oreo shake, masala soda, egg cheese sandwich and egg chowmin. Food is good and tasty. Pocket pinch is very much affordable. A good pocket friendly place to suppress your hunger.

This shop is located near barrackpore station. Here you get a variety of juices and snacks. I tried the oreo shake and chicken momo. The oreo shake was good and the chicken momo was average. Overall a descent snack center to eat. Ambience is shabby though, but this food kiosk will provide you good food at cheap rate.
