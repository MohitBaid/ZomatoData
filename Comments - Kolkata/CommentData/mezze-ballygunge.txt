I have tried their Chicken Shawarma Wrap not once, but twice, but sadly it did nothing to make me like it. The grated chicken chunks lack any kind of juicyness to it, moreover the pita bread too is not as tasty as some of the joints I have tried shawarmas from. Will try other stuff from their joint soon and see if they fare any better.

This outlet is present on the 4th floor at food court, Quest mall and has a decent menu to offer. But unfortunately most of the things weren't available when I went there to place my order. I wanted to opt for - make my own pasta-but half of the ingredients got over and so I had to choose between the other pasta options. I decided to go for Penne Rosse which was a mixed sauce pasta. The taste was nice and good but not extraordinary.

Located in the food court of Quest mall, diz outlet mainly specialises in serving Lebanese food .. so on a packed saptami night ,decided to try out their LEBANESE CHICKEN WRAP .. it came for 120 for each + GST...  Chunks of boiled chicken dipped in hummus wrapped up in tortilla bread along with lettuce ... They even served complimentary raita and a small cucumber and tomato .. the wrap was nothing extraordinary but good ....however there were no meat pieces near the end .. one wrap is enough to fill the stomach ... One of the most affordable outlets in food court of quest mall when compared to the rest... Overall it was good ..

Navratri hence veg, no onion no garlic. Plain white sauce pasta leaves little for experimentation. However the food was delicately prepared and really well done. Great work guys

This outlet serves mix of Lebanese and Italian dishes. I personally have not tried their Lebanese fare but their Italian dishes mainly pastas are just average when it comes to taste and the quality. We had ordered penne pasta in white sauce with chicken and mushrooms. The quantity of white sauce was not too much as a result the pasta looked a bit dry. Another major drawback that the counter service employyes of Mezze have is that they don't want to take orders in case you wish to order from "make your own pasta" they give frivolous excuses like the quantity won't be much or something like we have stopped taking order from this. So they should might as well strike it out from their menu. Quite disappointed with their service. Finally they said they could make Mac and cheese for us with add ons like chicken and mushrooms. So the customer basically have to order as per the Mezze employee's liking. Quite sad.

One of my personal favorites at the Q Court is the outlet ‚Äì Mezze.
Their Mezze Platter consists of 6 pieces of boneless chicken, hummus, ghanoush, tabbauleh, lebneh, Muhammara and Fattoush salad. I love Lebanese food, and this platter is just so perfect for my Lebanese food cravings.

I ordered the Shawarma wrap here but was pretty disappointed with it. It was not authentic at all and the chicken was not tasting anything close to Shawarma chicken. The chicken was pan fried and undercooked. After paying way more than the expected price of a Shawarma wrap, I tasted disappointment wrapped inside the pita bread. Too bad.

Mezze is the only Lebanese option in the Quest Mall food court. I tried the chicken Mezze platter here. It came with pieces of soft, light pita bread pieces, to be eaten with succulent chicken pieces, along with kibbeh, fattoush, muhammara, labneh, tabbouleh, hummus, and baba ganoush, all included in the platter. If you're confused about what those names might be - well, they're dips and salads that add a gamut of flavours, textures and tastes to every bite that you take! I found the dish quite light, despite so many components!

You will get here amazing varieties of Lebanese cuisine. We ordered for  shish taouk as recommended by the chef, Moroccan chicken wrap and kafta khosh khash. Quantity isn't enough but still dishes are very flavourful.meat was well seasoned and juicy enough.loved their dips and salads.Specially every dip has an unique taste.but  Pita breads were so dry. Staffs were very generous.

I just love trying out the small food joints spread across the city malls as they provide huge variety of food and beverages at such reasonable prices, which are mostly consumed by youngsters or by the aam aadmi, like me! I was longing to try out this food joint called Mezze at the Quest Mall Food court (Kolkata). It‚Äôs primarily a Lebanese food joint. Somehow, every time I have been at Quest mall for a movie or something, I have ended up eating at the other joints. Few days back, ultimately I got the opportunity to check out their signature dish ‚Äì the Chicken Mezze platter when I was here as part of a food audit team. The Mezze platter is quite common these days in Kolkata and you will get this at many restaurants in the city. It can be consumed before a heavy meal; but to me, it is a meal in its own right. It has small portions of several meze dishes which together comes together to complete that meal.
                                                                ...

Lebanese food is something which we folks in Kolkata definitely love.There are few places that make interesting food and among them is Mezze situated at the food court of Quest Mall,Q court. Mezze not many know that it actually has a long list of food to try out from which you don't get everywhere. However no experiments happened when i visited this place ,thanks to First Idea Pr for calling me over. Now when i say no experiments happened means that the famous Mezze platter was the deal of the day.Yes mezze platter is something one loves to indulge in . Over here the non-veg platter had some Pita bread,a soft drink and small serves of Baba ghanoush
Hummus
Tabbouleh
Lebneh
Muhammara
Fattoush &
Kibbah.

Although the platter was very promising in appearance but i felt it could have been a little more better in taste .This is a nice platter to choose but that spark of a thing in this meal was a bit less. Try it out maybe you might have a different opinion than me as it is definitely recommended in any case .

Ordered 2 Chicken shawarma wrap for me and my friend and it was the most horrible shawarma wrap I have ever eaten in my life! It was not just tasteless but the wrap bread had so much uncooked maida on it that we had to throw it away finally. On giving a feedback to the counter, we were told "there are different ways of cooking it...this is how we make it here". Well, it is the worst way of cooking in that case.

Located at the food court of the Quest mall, I have been to this place twice! And I tried the following two items from here-
1) chicken shawarma(4/5)- one of the best in the city! They are generous with the amount of chicken served and the curd dip is light and tasty! Recommended!

2) Moroccan chicken wrap(4.5/5)- this wrap tastes amazing! Even better than chicken shawarma... The unique sauce used is flavourful, the chicken is delicacy spiced. Every thing about this dish would make you rave for more! 

What I utterly dislike about this place is their service! All the workers keep talking and even on standing near the counter they don't come forward! And they talk so loudly that one needs to shout for them to notice! The management should take care of that!

Tried something different for the first time. Mezze is a place to have Lebanese food. I have tried Cajun spiced chicken skewers. It's was served with grilled chicken üêî Lebanese style of course, a salad ü•ó, French fries üçü, bread ü•ñ and a yogurt dip. The whole combination was very delicious, its was healthy and nutritious. You can get lots of other Lebanese stuff to eat also. Should visit.

This place was a really pleasant surprise!! Generally food courts dish out very substandard and tasteless food. But Mezze at the food court of Quest Mall delighted our taste buds. We were happy with what we had. I had the Veg. Mezze platter which had six dips..Baba ghanoush, hummus, tabbouleh, lebneh, muhammara, fattoush..Served with Falafel , salad,pita bread and a coke. It was a complete meal , it was light n fresh, wholesome and tasty. I simply loved the dips, favourites being the babaghanoush and lebneh( for its garlicky taste). My friend had the Lebanese chicken platter ,which was accompanied with parsley steamed rice,salad and French fries. She relished the dish. 
But what I found odd was that though they present themselves as a Lebanese joint, they also have a mish mash of other cuisines, namely, American, Italian etc. Why?? Should stick to Lebanese or maybe Middle eastern cuisine.

Comedy of errors on Christmas eve led us to this food court. We had around 30 mins before the movie when we reached Mezze. So we decided to keep it simple and ordered the following:

1. Crispy French Fries: They were crispy and they were a plate full
2. Spaghetti in Creamy Pesto : This was a surprise. ¬†Very delicious and filling.¬†

Though I tend not to write about food court outlets, but this deserved a review!

The lady was busy with her computer.after 5 mins I ordered.as soon as the card was swiped I was informed that it would take 15 mins to make.there was no one waiting and so I asked them that they should have informed before swiping the card.however my plea went unanswered.to add insult to injury I was charged 5%service charge on the bill.now u have to pay extra on disgusting service
P.s the shawarma wasn't edible and was atrocious..quest should throw out such operators to save the name of their mall!

Tasted the Shawarma Roll for lunch today.
It was not to my liking at all. I like the cream inside a bit sweet but it was nothing according to my preference.
Other people with different taste buds might like it.
There was two types of cream on two sides of the roll. And I guess they had put lettuce in it too.
I have never had a Shawarma with lettuce inside. Weird.

Probably the only Lebanese food place in Quest Mall. It sells a range of tasty food items that are not much familiar to the regular Calcuttian's palette. 
Starting from Mezze Platter to Arabian Barbecue- they have it all. 
I recently ordered their Classic Hot Dog. A delicious combination of large Chicken Sausage and shredded cheese. This was accompanied with a side of French fries and dip. The food was spot on and the quantity was so much more than what we expected. 
An excellent place to fill your tummy. Food starts from 100 bucks. Go hurry and get yourself Mezzed now!

The food is OK. But the staff behaviour is horrible for a food joint. They don't give a token number though they quote a wait time while taking order. The actual time for readying the order is more than the quote. And this becomes frustrating as one have to keep looking at the counter for the order to be ready so that you know about it. When asked about it the person in the counter gives a curt reply saying we stick to the time. Secondly the menu says something else and the actual plate contains something else. I ordered Lebanese chicken today which comes under Arabic Barbeque. This section contains pita bread French fries and house salad included complimentary as written in the menu. But they don't give pita bread and French fries with all the menu items under Arabic Barbeque.

A second place where you get good shawarma rolls ! I love having their chicken shawarma from here ! The chicken is cooked absolutely perfectly and is served with a salad and a sour yogurt dip on the side. In filling consists of the chicken and vegetables with a blend of other sauces. I've tried their hummus and pita bread too and it's good. The mutton is okay , though the flavour is enhanced because of the use of middle eastern spices. All in all a good and pocket friendly place and one of the few places to actually have a shawarma!

Lebanese joint in food court which serves Chinese, sandwiches, barbeque and pasta. Ambitious was nice and hospitality was impressive. Staff were friendly and service & presentation was good as well. Come to food it looks good and smells also very nice but still need little improvement in taste and making. We had a penne arrabiata which was an pasta cooked in red sauce and salsa. It was looking good and smells delicious but in taste it was good but something mission. As i said they need little improvement. Hope in next visit i had a great pasta. Atleast once try place.

Nothing beats a Shawarma wrap and a glass of Chilled Coke after a tiring shopping spree.
This place located in food court of Quest Mall has authentic Lebanese Flavors. Chicken Shredded from Vertical Rotisserie was indeed aromatic and succulent.
Use of Pita Bread in Shawarmas could have enhanced the taste though.

I have tried Mezze only twice and technically all I have had is the Shish Taouk. And to be completely honest, I have not had much experience with Lebanese cuisine but I found their Shish Taouk quite nice. It may or may not be authentic, but it was a really nice dish if I focus solely on the flavour. The other reviews however aren't as I expected but yes, if there's one thing I can vouch for, then that has to be the Shish Taouk. It's not too expensive and is a good option for either lunch or dinner. I would love to try the food here soon. Happy Dining!

I've had bad shawarmas before, like from Shawarma Nation for example. But the one from Mezze was worse. 
I had thought that no one could surpass the extremely unpleasant shawarma experience i had at Shawarma Nation but we have a clear winner here.
No wonder there is no crowd around this outlet at the Quest food court.
It was my first experience there and they have given me a good enough reason for never coming back.
I felt nauseous after eating it.
I love chicken and today i had to throw it away.
Just how sad is that!!
I guess shawarma is one of the basic stuff in lebanese cuisine. How wrong and bad can someone get it ?!!!!

The place is situated in the food court of Quest Mall. Had been there yesterday with my fiance. It was a saturday so had ordered veg. We had ordered Pastas. The place is basically known for its Lebanese food. 

But a veg falafel or shwarma  was not very tempting. So we chose the Penne Arabiata and the Veg Agoliolio along with Coke. 

The food was really tasty and the quantity was good too. The price was a little more than expected but it was a good experience. 

Would love to go n try out the Non Veg Menu

The wrap was cold and the bread was hard and kind of stale. It didn't taste that good too. I know better places that serve extremely better shawarma wrap at Rs. 120 than this outlet which charges 175 for a crap wrap. A big no no!

After a shopping session in Quest, when you have to get back to home for dinner, but you still don't feel like leaving without gorging on something, places like this come to rescue you. Yes. It was one such visit. I went there with my sister and baby niece who kept on sleeping by the sofa all the time. We had ordered Penne Al Rago di Pollo. This was basically a chicken pasta, basically penne tossed in a mixed kind of sauce, white and red. It was creamy, smooth and yummy perfectly blending with the Italian spices. They had also served complimentary garlic bread which was also very good. A nice place to eat out sometimes for trying the Mediterranean delicacies. Happy Dining! :)

We ordered one non veg lasagne and one Lebanese platter. 
Lasagne had only one layer and more of in a liquid form.
In the platter the meat balls were bitter and rest of the items were merely sauce. I didn't understood why its price is 290.

Being a restaurant in the food court of a mall, I had my apprehensions because i somehow, almost always, have had a bad experience with mall food. But this time I was surprised, rather delighted to have tried this place on a suggestion by a dear friend. Well it was specifically for the Mac & Cheese- hence ordered exactly that.¬†
Well the Mac n Cheese was pretty darn good, only it felt slightly under-seasoned. Also the garlic bread accompanying it was rather soggy- so a downer there, but nonetheless a good meal. Slightly over priced though but nice. Cheers!

Mezze is a good place - the meals are wholesome, fresh and healthy and displayed prices include service charge - so extra marks for honest customer ethics !

The non veg mezze platter comes with an assortment of dips (humus, baba ganauj, muhamura and lebneh dip) and salad ( fattoush and tabouleh) along with kibeh ( for a very reasonable price of 275 bucks. The veg alternative with falafel is for 220 bucks). The platter is the best buy and the one I recommend. I also had the sesh touk, which was good, but I would say go for the platter instead, if you want a wholesome meal.

Now what you need to remember is that Mezze is, at the end of the day, a food court place, and in that category, for the price it charges, it provides very good food. 

But if you are a Mediterranean food snob, you need to remember that - (a) the baba ganouj is actually muttabel with seeded aubergine, average seasoning, and weak tahini flavour, served at room temperature;  (b) the fattoush doesn't have pita toasted crumbs or feta cheese; (b) muhamura and humus are nice but @not very creamy. My favourite was the Lebneh dip and followed by the pita which was nice and soft. But, you probably also know that food court isn't the place to seek such subtleties.

The food court of Quest is supposed to be one of the best food courts in Kolkata, but now I think it's no more the same, the quality is not being maintained at all....
Had ordered a paneer shawarma and a chicken shawarma. The bread was ice cold and the chicken or paneer were hardly to be seen, just filled with hummus, yoghurt which was sour I guess it was stake and the Chinese cabbage.
It was awful in taste.... I guess there should be constant check on the quality as well as the quantity of the food being served. 
Hope it's taken into consideration and some changes are done on immediate basis

Being a restaurant in the food court of a mall, I had my apprehensions because i somehow, almost always, have had a bad experience with mall food. But this time I was surprised, rather delighted to have tried this place on a suggestion by a dear friend. Well it was specifically for the Mac & Cheese- hence ordered exactly that.¬†
Well the Mac n Cheese was pretty darn good, only it felt slightly under-seasoned. Also the garlic bread accompanying it was rather soggy- so a downer there, but nonetheless a good meal. Slightly over priced though but nice. Cheers!

Mezze is a good place - the meals are wholesome, fresh and healthy and displayed prices include service charge - so extra marks for honest customer ethics !

The non veg mezze platter comes with an assortment of dips (humus, baba ganauj, muhamura and lebneh dip) and salad ( fattoush and tabouleh) along with kibeh ( for a very reasonable price of 275 bucks. The veg alternative with falafel is for 220 bucks). The platter is the best buy and the one I recommend. I also had the sesh touk, which was good, but I would say go for the platter instead, if you want a wholesome meal.

Ordered a Kafta Khosh Khash w Pita Bread on a slow Friday afternoon, 1:30pm. It took so long to prepare that I feel its not worthy of food court dining. All i got was a very salty salad, equally salty yoghurt sauce, fries, pita bread and 5 kebabs of mutton drenched in a somewhat tomato-ey sauce with raw onions on top. I think they should do much much better because Rs.275 can get me much better stuff at KFC or pizza hut or Au Bon Pain counters.

I have always hated food from the food court at all other shopping malls in Kolkata. I usually go for burger and fries from KFC since I am mostly very hungry and also in a hurry after shopping. KFC's waiting time is the least and so it tops my priority list. But this time I thought of trying something different. So we ordered food from Mezze.¬†
We got shisha taouk, mezze platter and Penne Arabiata. Food tasted good and so I was happy. Was not disappointed for a change.¬†
Shisha taouk had boneless grilled chicken pieces along with pita bread, salad and french fries. It tasted good though the pita bread was not upto the mark. Mezze platter did not disappoint either. But the pasta came along with garlic bread which tasted the best. Pasta was well cooked and the sauce tasted decent. The garlic bread stole the show, it was nice and crisp. Perfectly done.

My experience was good. Looking forward to try other things from the menu!

Mezze at Quest Mall Food Court is a decent Lebanese food joint. I was here earlier this afternoon with a friend to lunch before heading to Inox for a recently released horror flick. Pertaining to my awful experiences of eating at specialised Lebanese restaurants (forgive me if that is an overstatement), I decided to gamble on Lebanese amid a healthy atmosphere at a slightly higher price. The gamble did pay off, to be honest.
We ordered Spaghetti Meat Balls, which was a bit too tangy but pretty good. Lamb chops accompanied with French Fries and yogurt dip was the other order, which I thought could have been slightly better. The yogurt dip was sumptuous, though. 
I had slightly higher expectations, but it certainly didn't disappoint.

And price is also ok .

It takes courage to embrace new experiences and Mezze is one of those experiences that you don't want to cherish.
A simple order of sandwich and Pepsi can go horribly wrong.
It started with a sandwich which looked fancy but was completely the opposite. The fillings would spill out with every bite till a point where I was literally eating the bread alone and the stuffings after. The Pepsi was old and didn't have the much needed fizz. The potato chips that came with the sandwich were not crispy. They were as soft and chewy as a chewing gum.
All in all, I can't really elaborate on a gruesome experience so here goes.
EAT RESPONSIBLY!!

I've only had food at this outlet once and that too by chance. You come to Quest Mall and you do not want gourmet food neither the usual KFCs or PHDs. What options are you left with? 
My answer now is Mezze! 

My boyfriend and I eat out a lot. Hence we wanted to try something different and we settled for Shish Taouk!
Succulent pieces of marinated chicken in a spice mix and slow roasted, served with a detectably fresh hummus, cool and tangy, with oven warmed pita bread, a side salad and French fries. 

A completely enjoyable meal at a very affordable price of 220/- per dish. 

The only con was the side salad was a tad too salty.

Mezze, like all restaurants that have Italian dishes, has its own hidden gems.

We started with the Mezze platter, which is the standard Lebanese platter, with sour cream, salad, couscous and the other works. On the whole it was average, with the pita bread tasting kind off, although a great starter to munch on.

Besides that we had ordered a garlic pasta, which was enjoyable to eat.

Lastly, which was truly the standpoint of having lunch here, was the pesto spaghetti. It was beautifully made and a must for all pesto lovers. It had the perfect blend of herbs and cream mixed in as sauce, which melted in our mouths.

For all other wheelchair users, Quest Mall is completely wheelchair friendly from top to bottom, including wheelchair accessible restrooms. You will have no problem accessing any of the restaurants there and the same goes for all restaurants in the food court, including Mezze.

If you're looking for decent lebanese (or levantine) food then 'Mezze' is one of the better outlets serving such cuisine. Located in the food court of the Quest Mall their menu is limited but whatever they offer is worth the money &, of course, taste. Try the Mezze platter or the Shawarma & you won't be disappointed. The service is also nice but not all the service men are always attentive. For this reason alone I don't give it more than 4.

Mezze , meaning an appetizer in the near east and Balkan region , is a fine place for experiencing Lebanese food. From pitta breads to hummus , tabouleh , baba ghanoush etc , the mixed nonveg platter gives a rich and colourful experience covering a wide range of tastes . I personally liked the baba ghanoush which reminded me of the begun pora I used to eat at home.

A small joint in the food court of Quest Mall. I don't usually keep expectations of good food from food courts given the food other joints in food courts of other malls serve.
But this was surprisingly good. I ordered for a Mezze Platter and it was actually very tasty. Their kitchen was clean and the staff's behaviour was also very good. The Mezze Platter which has Pita bread, Falafel and 4 different types of dressings/toppings for the dish including Hummus was very tasty. The joint, even though it is in Quest Mall, is not very expensive and the portions are sufficiently filling.!

Well, this was the first time i tried Lebanese cuisine...New names weren't helping at all so we decided on trying the mezze platter which had 7 items. The food was presented in a nice way. The taste was weird but I guess that's cause it's very different from our usual taste buds. Overall I would give it an avg thumbs up. The veg platter was 220 only, which has a good amount of quantity so I can say value for money considering its inside Quest Mall.

I am a Lebanese food lover.
So, in the Quest mall food court,Mezze seemed to be a good choice for me,inspite of so many other options!
The counter is small,with limited items and a standard waiting time.
We tried Shish taouk -- Grilled chicken, served with pita,french fries,dip and salad. The pieces of chicken and its size was quiet disappointing. The bread was not great.The fries were good. The dip was not up to the mark.
Shawarma is kind of OK,not the best .
Price: on higher side,considering the quality and quantity they serve.

On a busy day it takes approximately 7-10 mins to be served here. I went for Shish Taouk which is cubes of grilled chicken marinated with yoghurt and lemon and comes with the option of pita bread or rice and fries and salad. The one who was taking our order seemed a little lost, nevertheless the food was warm and nice. I would not say this is the best Lebanese food I have had but then again it's not bad either. I must mention another thing here that the french fries are pretty good, tossed with the perfect amount of salt and pepper, they are perfect and crispy. I will come back to try some of the other options in their menu later.

Bloody ripoff!
I had a "kibbeh" which I didn't even know what it was, but I've had and liked Lebanese food before, so I wanted to try something in that genre. It costed 165/- PLUS TAX, and had only FOUR pieces of meat! :( They gave me tons of "leafy stuff", with some type of sauce, which in fact tasted quite good, but really, at almost 200 rupees I was expecting my belly to be filled which it was NOT. Hopefully after people read this review and stop going there, they'll be forced to increase it to at least SIX pieces, which *maybe*, would be money's worth.

I came to Mezze with my sister for her birthday lunch. It was our first time trying Lebanese cuisine. I had Kofta Khos khas and sis had Mezzeh Platter. When the food came, it first looked like it was too less. But once you start eating you realize its just enough. I loved the food. The tabbouleh and baba ganoush on the mezze platter were simply awesome, for the lack of a better word. What I didn't like were the lamb koftas. It was quite fibrous and not exactly something I will like to try again. All in all food was rather good, but they will have to adjust the flavours for the Indian palate.

They gave me this beautiful looking platter in minimal time the other day. I was very happy with the way ¬†the Mezzeh non veg platter looked.¬†

There was baba ghannouj, kibbeh, hummus, tabbouleh and others, the names of which, i remember not :D

I have never liked baba ghannouj, the good old begun, in my life! I did not like it here as well. The pita breads, hummus and lebneh were pretty good, like always, like everywhere. The falafel was my favorite item in the platter. Those were nice and hot and soft! The glass of coke was chilled. The rest of the items on the platter, I liked not.

The food was not as good to taste as it looked, however, it was warm and not bad either. The falafel was the best in the lot and one can always give this a try. Would come back for other items soon probably.

I visited the quest mall with my friends and found this joint at food court. Since they serve halaal chicken my muslim friend was very happy to taste the lebanese items. The Taste and preparation of the dishes are unique but overpriced according to the quantity they offer. One dish is not enough for a person. They have a self help system. Also they took a long time to prepare the dishes.

We got the veg mezze platter, and it came with a generous serving of falafel and pita bread, baba ganoush, hummus, Tabouleh, etc etc with a glass of coke. The best thing was - everything was piping hot, served to us within minutes, and quite tasty. 

For 200/- the food was very substantial, and was actually a nice sharing meal between two, or for a very hungry individual. I also tried the chicken shawarma, which was decent, and thankfully, not drowned in sauces, like so many places in Kolkata tend to do.

Located at the extreme corner of the Quest mall food court, this outlet is sure to attract all lebanese food lovers. The shawarma here is pretty different from all the other places I have had till date. However the salad had a good mix of veggies and chicken, which makes it a good snack.
Would love to come back to try other dishes.

Whenever its quest mall its about lebanese n mezze. What I conventionally like is the shish taouk. U can also try the mezze platter with kibbeh. Its wonderful to taste. Or if u wanna go trial n hit. U must go in for kofta khosH-khash. I think u will feel on cloud 9 when u r going to have this. A must try.

Mezze has some really amazing Lebanese delicacies! Their veg Mezze Platter comprising of babaghannouj, hummus, tabbouleh, lebneh, muhammara,  fattoush and falafel is simply appetising! Served neatly and well - garnished, this platter tastes as good as it looks. I'm yet to try the other stuff, but being a vegetarian, my choices are limited. But the lavish platter was totally mouth - watering and a must try for all those Lebanese food lovers!

Location: Food Court, Quest Mall. 

This small Lebanese counter is located in the Food court of Quest mall beside KFC. 
Serves authentic quality of Lebanese food. 
Happened to drop by the mall to catch up with a few friends and ended up trying the food out here. 
Just ordered for a Paneer Shawarma Wrap to taste as we had ordered for pizza from the pizza hut counter. 
- The wrap was soft, yet cracked, the Paneer filling was generous and the cubes were quite soft and succulent, the amount of veggies (were fresh) and hummus was decent as well. A tablespoon of mayo was added as well. 
Was served along with a pickled veggie salad and sour pepper yoghurt dip as sides. 
The wrap tasted good. An authentic preparation though, might not appeal the Indian taste buds which prefer the indianized wraps. 
Could have been better if it was served a little more heated.¬† 

The service was quick and the place is moderately priced. 

Overall a good experience.

It was one of those days when I went for that ‚Äúlets explore the new mall in town ‚Äú expedition that I happened to grab a meal at MEZZE at QUEST MALL . I was half dead after hours of exploring and picking up knick knacks and I wanted something infact anything that would pacify my gastric juices at time ‚Ä¶ picked up the KAFTA KHOSH KHASH ‚Ä¶. Which in simpler terms  means pita breads ,French fries ,salad served with minced lamb blass and yoghurt !  Despite being desperately hungry the food tasted average and the lambs were way too salty for my liking . I did not find this place value for my money and would give a second thought befire I revisit .

MEZZE, BALLYGUNGE is a newly opened Lebanese restaurant in Quest Mall. Being in one of the posh malls of the city the food items seemed overpriced to me compared to other restaurants. Tried out the Shawarma roll which was nicely wrapped but it lacked the authentic true Lebanese taste and also the dip that they served was not up to the mark. Kind of dissatisfied with the place.

Stepped into Quest for a quick lunch with a friend and decided to try the combo lamb platter here. The dips, hummus and the lamb was perfectly made. The salad was not salty and had the right amount of dressing and the pita bread was soft and together it tasted really delicious. Must try for those looking for a healthy lunch option and quite filling for 250.

The mezze platter is really nice. Must remember the cuisine is different so be prepared to have a lot of sesame flavor in most dishes. The lamb kebab was slightly dry. Thry should introduce a traditional drink with mint and herbs instead of soft drinks.

Mezze will always be memorable for being the place where I first tasted Lebanese cuisine. 
Located in the food court of Quest Mall, this place offers cheap but tasty fare. Well, cheap compared to the some other pricey ones on the same floor.
I tried the Chicken Shawarma Wrap which was just awesome. Served with a yoghurt dip and veggies on the side, the wrap was really filling and tasty. I found the pita bread a little brittle, though I don't know whether it was cracking under the weight of the chicken filling or is it supposed to be like that. The filling was tasty shredded chicken marinated with fragrant herbs and spices, coupled with fresh strips of cabbages and capsicum. The chicken was just perfect. Also, the mayo inside was neither too runny, nor too little.
Next up was the Falafel, which makes for heavy evening snacks. It comes six per plate along with two pita breads broken to pieces for convenience. The falafel was dry, with a delicious fragrance of spices and fresh lime. But fear not the dryness, for you have the hummus along with it. Which is awesome, by the way. Not too spicy, not too bland, with a garlicky flavor, it tastes awesome even with noodles. The pita had a nice sprinkling of ghee, which added to the taste.
It was all so tasty and affordable, that I intend to visit here again. 

P.S.-Service is really good and the staff was very helpful. If they ask you to wait for five minutes, don't wait more than that. They are that fast.

I ordered a paneer shawarma wrap and a fresh lime soda. 
While the soda was really very good and refreshing, the paneer shawarma absolutely sucked. 
I couldn't eat after gobbling a few bites >.<

I have a soft corner for Lebanese food and visited this place yesterday. The food quality is quite good here. The shwarma wrap is good but if compared to  Ar-Han-Thai's shwarma wrap the price is  30rs more and it is more or less of same quality. Besides as it is in Quest Mall you will get a good ambiance in the food court. The service is really fast here. Will definitely visit this place again.

This place was suddenly discovered, as my sis was looking for something interesting to eat while hovering around quest mall.

My sister and mother took Chicken Swarma roll to eat, which they liked in taste. 

It was a take away for me. Roll was heavy with good portion. The value for money is damm good (Rs 150).

Cons - 
The amount of mayonise seems pretty less. taste is OK, not great.

Mezze: A Lebanese joint opened at Quest!
===================================================================
Intro:

As Mezze is located in the quest mall food court, I had planned to visit also to try their chicken shawarma wrap. As I had limited time, all I could see that it was like a L shaped shop where there were two shawarma machines which were operating for Chicken and Paneer Shawarma wrap. The staffs were very busy as they were getting good amount of orders for the wraps and other falafel sandwiches. 
===================================================================
Food ordered: 

I tried the Lebanese Chicken Shawarma Wrap. It was exactly like the real Lebanese cuisines that I had in a Lebanese Restaurant In United Kingdom, which was run by the Arab guys. The shawarma wrap had a bland taste to the chicken with no extra spices added. It was served with their water dipped Lebanese red color beet pickle. However, the beet pickle had started giving out its color and had spilled on the paper of the wrap. They even serve Raita long with the wrap. However, this chicken was well marinated and was served with their special sauce. But, to our Indian taste buds, we are accustomed to having that sweet sauce and I had expected an Indian touch to the dish. More or less, it was pretty moderate. The wrap was dry. There were no extra salt and spices, which we Indians love to enjoy which made the shawarma wrap bland. 

The Lebanese Chicken shawarma wrap costs 150 bucks. As per the mall standards, I think it‚Äôs decently priced and it took approximately 15 minutes to serve me.  The pita bread was thin which was a plus point for them and they had not added those indian tomatoes and capsicum to the Lebanese dish thereby, preserving its Authenticity!

If you are planning to have that Authentic Lebanese, this is your place. However, if you would love a little Indian touch to the Lebanese food, which I love, well there are other places to visit too. :)
===================================================================

Pros:

‚Ä¢	Reasonably priced.
‚Ä¢	Courteous Staffs speaks about the hospitality. 
‚Ä¢	Promptness of Service ‚Äì Got the food in 15 minutes. 
‚Ä¢	Quality was superb.
‚Ä¢	Hygiene was maintained
‚Ä¢	Authentic Lebanese Preparation of Shawarma 
‚Ä¢	The pita was thin , the wrap was filled with chicken and not vegetables which we usually see at usual Lebanese joints. Not just that, the pita was soft too. 



Cons:

‚Ä¢	This authentic preparation of Wrap might not appeal everyone, as the Indian Palate requires spices. 
‚Ä¢	The red beet pickle served with the wrap might not be Indian Taste friendly, yet again. 
===================================================================
Summary:

Presentation 4/5
Quality 4/5
Quantity 4/5
Taste 3/5 
Hygiene 4/5
Hospitality 4/5
Value for Money 4/5

===================================================================
Conclusion: 

Would love to try out more dishes out here to discover more of the Lebanese preparation of the food. It was good yet could have been better. The next visit is on my cards. ‚ò∫

Let's start with this: I am not from Kolkata. I do not know the local kitchen culture so well yet. This is not even my account; I am using this with the permission of its holder. I already had the pleasure to experience the Lebanese kitchen, through a friend who comes from Lebanon himself and knows some traditional restaurants in my hometown. So, when my host and I were at Quest mall and noticed Mezze, I couldn't help but try to introduce them to this cuisine. So, we went to Mezze, a mistake I still regret.

Let's start with what we ordered: A non-vegetarian Mezze platter, a Chicken Shawarma wrap, and a Kafta Yoghurtlieh. The last dish is most likely not traditionally Lebanese in my experience, but I was curious, so we went with it.

Aaaah, Mezze. I cannot help to recount the experiences I had with it so far. Usually, in a traditional Lebanese establishment, the table is likely to burst under the weight of bowls with small dishes to taste (a bit like Spanish Tapas in the tradition, not in the taste). Small meatballs, spicey Hummus (tastes of chick peas and garlic), sauces of hot peppers, roasted eggplants, crispy pita bread to scoop them up, and a salad made out of hummus, tomatoes and parsley are a few examples I have to take because these were what this platter mainly consisted of. They also added one salad which, I must point out, wasn't traditionally Lebanese but regular continental; we didn't even taste it.

The meatballs were supposed to be crispy. That said; there is a difference between crispy and hard as a turtles shell. They are not supposed to be deep fried, which they seemed to be, nor should they be rubbery inside. They are usually well-spiced; these were overspiced, which couldn't hide the fact though that the mutton was of poor quality. Tough, rubbery and with a distinct smell.

The Hummus would be next, I am afraid. The meatballs were overspiced; they should've taken half of their spices and added it here. It was bland, boring, plain wrong. Good Hummus tastes strongly of garlic, the chick peas are dominant, both tastes exist harmoniously. I couldn't tell if they used garlic here or not.

There was certainly garlic in the Cacik (at least that's the Turkish name; I don't know the Lebanese). It is a yoghurt dish, similar to Raita, mainly consisting of yoghurt, garlic, cucumber and herbs. A bit of salt should be there too, and I must stress on 'a bit', for this was oversalted and too garlicy.

And the sauce with peppers. Indian, especially Bengali kitchen is pretty spicey (at least compared to many cuisines). This is why I can't understand the decision to leave the spices out until it's bland as a shoe sole. It had no distinct taste. I would have understood this in a European restaurant, but not here. This just doesn't make sense. I had the sense that spices are not very expensive and freely available in the market.

I could go in further detail just about the platter. The salads were terrible too; the Pita bread was spongy and soft, tasted like half-raw pizza dough from some supermarket, instead of being crispy on the outside and tender inside, grilled and rich. But we have other things to talk about, so I save myself the pain.

The Shawarma would be the next thing. Shawarma should be meat, marinated in lemon juice and a number of spices, like cinnamom, coriander seeds, tumeric, cumin and many more (depending on the region). These are all ingredients that you can obtain easily in Kolkata, especially in Kolkata. The meat should be juicy, tender and moist. The flavour should be mild but distinct and, in my opinion, heavenly.

I already saw a gentleman here saying that the meat is dry and I agree, but the ESSENCE of Shawarma is that it should be moist. That it is dry is a blatant insult to the Lebanese kitchen. It is like forgetting the tamarind for Panipuris. It was served with a poor excuse for Lebanese pickles, which should be vegetables marinated in Red Beets and Vinegar. Traditionally, the taste should be sour and a bit bitter, or better: Traditionally, it should taste of SOMETHING.

And the Kaftas. I will not go into details. Many of my criticism to the Mezze's meatballs goes for them too. Added to that comes that this was supposed to be Lamb and thus should be milder than mutton, which it failed to be. (Small side note: If you fail to get good Lamb meat, you SHOULD take mutton instead.) But the last thing was: When you serve Kafta as a main dish, you don't serve four tiny, shameful pieces which would barely pass as a starter and charge full Rs. 250 for that. 

Furthermore, you DO NOT refriegerate dips absolutely essential to an entire cuisine. You prepare them fresh for regular use.

In the end, we spent around Rs. 650 for the whole meal and left our plates uneaten.

When you plan on experiencing the Lebanese kitchen and, by some unfortunate incident, should stumble upon this location, I beg you: Please turn on your heels and leave. This doesn't represent this wonderful cuisine. Get yourself some North Indian Tandoori, even that comes closer to a good Lebanese dish than this catastrophe.

i have a recent liking towards lebanese so thought of trying mezze with my friends in the quest mall...the food court was fillled up and the ambience was good with people everywhere chatting and eating..
we ordered for  chicken shawarma wraps and cafe latte...the shawarma was not tat tasty and juicy the meyonnaise portion and the chicken filling is not that tasty which dissatisfied me though the amount of chicken was good one...though the cafe latte was a better one it was made perfectly..
they have a small outlet yet a nicely decorated one ,the person taking orders was friendly and efficient enough..the shawarma wrap and latte  was quite pocket friendly one and not that price taxing yet i think that they can make their shawarma better..

As the demand for Lebanese food has risen in Kolkata, so as the number of Lebanese joints have risen to satisfy the customer demands :)

Location - Mezze is located at the Quest Mall, 4th floor, just beside the KFC outlet at the food court.

Brief - I had a very brief experience today of this place. While ordering at KFC thought of trying their Chicken Shawarma Wrap.

Things Tried - Chicken Shawarma Wrap.

Since was already filled up by the KFC orders today, so i thought of ordering just one chicken shwarma wrap to taste.
The Wrap was decently sized and was accompanied by a dip and some beet salad.
It was tasty, but still I felt something missing. Maybe I was already full thats why, but I felt the wrap was bit dry and a bit more of lebanese/mayo sauce would be nice. The size of the wrap was really good with alot of shredded chicken inside. The bread was also proper. I liked the dip very much and finished it up :P

Ambience - The server was very nice guy and took orders quickly and with a nice smile. They have a nicely decorated shop though. Sorry didnt take my camera with me today otherwise would have added some pics of the place. But there's always a next time. :D

Purse Check - The wrap came for Rs. 150/- (including all taxes). I think its pretty much purse friendly considering the size and proportions of Chicken.

I am definitely going there to try more of the items in their menu. They are really priced nicely. All the amounts mentioned in the menu are inclusive of taxes.

P.S. I am no expert in lebanese though but still you guys should make the wrap a bit moist. It tasted bit dry to me.

Well let me be honest here. I am not a huge pundit when it comes to Lebanese food, but the food tasted fine here. 
The Pita bread was soft and nice. The meat balls had a smoky feel. The dips were nice. 
The service is quick, and though it's not such a place for which you'd visit the mall, but if you do come to Quest for some other reason it's a nice place to have some rather innovative tasting(and sounding too) and light food. ¬†

PS. I visited this place after a good 8-9 months today. It was quite disappointing to find that the place serves exactly the same food it did almost a year back. A bit of variation on their tried and tested menu would've been good.

Well Mezze is one of the latest Lebanese outlets in Kolkata; quite a few has come up recently in the city actually. It's located in the Quest Mall food court n offers a decent spread on Mediterranean cuisine. 
They have a few set Mediterranean platters ranging from chicken to mutton in the range of 250/- to 275/- bucks. I tried a Chicken platter which has served with yogurt dressing n Pita bread which was quite good. Another dish which I ordered was kind of mutton balls (deep fried) served with humus, pita bread, fresh mixed salad n around 5 other Mediterranean dips! Whereas the mutton balls were over fried n hard... the dips were genuinely good. I can go back to this place only for these authentic Mediterranean dips! They tasted wonderful with the meat n bread.
It being an outlet in the food court... The service time is faster compared to other restaurants n pocket pinch is on the list side too.
However what was missing was some good Mediterranean desserts/ thirst quenchers (instead of the normal coke) to complete out meal.

While I'm not particularly crazy about Middle Eastern fare, I was won over by Mezze's amazing kofta with mezze platter (I forget the exact name of the dish). The pieces of meat were minced and grilled very crisply, yet had a wonderfully juicy and chewy interior. The pita bread was great - soft triangles that tasted lovely even on their own. And the dips served with it were amazing! I loved the hummus best, along with a spicy orange dip whose name I can't recall. But it was very light and flavourful and did not settle too heavily on the stomach. 
I'll be coming back here to try their wraps and sandwiches. I may just have converted to the Middle Eastern food cult - Mezze has achieved what even authentic meals in Syria couldn't! :D

Lebanese and Mediterranean cuisine has become quite a craze in recent times in Kolkata. We have seen several joints come up over the last couple of years. This one, in the food court of Quest Mall, has gathered quite a buzz, more by word of mouth than by reviews, I guess. It was one of my foodie friend's recommendation that made me skip a second visit to Chilis last week and try this instead. We were not disappointed, but not super thrilled either. We order a platter (we made sure that it had all the dips) and a chicken dish based on lemon and yoghurt (accompanied with pita bread). The dips were fabulous. The chicken and pita bread both were very good. But the mutton on the platter was not that fun. We knew it would be deep fried, but was too dry for our taste. Desserts mostly had popular items available instead of authentic ones. Service was good and courteous. We would have loved some specialised middle eastern drinks and more variety on the menu, but after all it is a small joint jostling for space in the food court and not a full fledged restaurant. Keeping that in mind, it is a decent place - good for a quick snack and even a dinner hangout with a bunch of friends.

My first visit to the food court and i tried the falafal sandwich wrap and the paneer shawarama...

First things first... the people are over friendly and will go to any lenghts to give you good food and a good experience... that too in a food court was just unexpected.... there was this guy on the counter who was making the wraps... and way way he was making with all his love and time....WAS AMAZING TO SEE!!!!!

the food is pretty good.... the falafal Wrap was amazing and the paneer shawarma was above average... 

all in all in a food court such good food being served is a boon....

Had a free afternoon so stepped into quest mall seeing chili‚Äôs full decided to grab a quick bite at the food court ... and at the far end I saw mezze. Basically a small joint in the food court I reached it without too many expectation assuming it will be one of the random shawarma joints> and i was proved wrong . 

First thing first i love the first appearance of the place. It was spotless there were at least 4 to 5 orders being made and there was no noise and the kitchen was very very clean. 

I tried the Falafel wrap and believe me it was filling. The filling was generous and the bell peppers and lettuce in the wrap were just perfect. Simply loved the yogurt pepper dip they gave on the side and 
Next i ordered the Kafta which was super soft. 4 pieces of mince meat served on a bed of mint and parsley flavored salad offered with a choice of rice or pita and fries tasted good too ... 

My suggestion to the owner/chef, for the prices you are charging please give a better packaging. And secondly please add couscous as a starch add on with the food not just rice and pita. And lastly ... instead of fries, potato wedges would have been much better. 

It is nice to see a joint that does not load a wrap in mayonnaise. Good job!
Was too full to try the baklava.... NEXT TIME!

A friend and I visited Quest last evening and for an evening snack she insisted that we try the Pita, Hummus and Falafel Platter  at Mezze as last time she had it she really enjoyed it. We ordered and while I must say that the Hummus was good and the Falafel was very tasty it was slightly over fried which needs to be remedied. The letdown for us both was the Pita. Last time it was soft and could be divided cross-sectionally so as to create a pocket for the Falafel. This time though that was not possible. The Shawarma's looked promising and I intend to visit soon in the hope that this was just a one-off situation.

As the rating of 3.0 suggests this place is ordinary at best. There is not a great variety and the prices seem a bit on the higher side for a food court counter. Also the quantity of food that they serve as compared to the prices they charge is quite measly. We had ordered a mutton shwarma roll and it cost us almost 210 INR. I regret not having checked the prices before ordering because if I had I would certainly have had from au bon pain. Anyway not going back again. If I want Lebanese I will head over to Go Lebanese or Royal Lebanese.

Mezze is located in the food court of the grand Quest Mall. Will not catch your eye right at the first go. After pondering quite a bit, decided to give it a try.
Friend and I wanted shawarma wraps, but they said that they had everything except shawarma. That left me dissapointed. Ultimately settled for shashlik with pita bread priced at 250/- each, we took two. They took round about 10-12 minutes to prepare it and when it was seeved to us, I was awestruck. The quantity was so meagre, beyond wild imaginations. I was very dissapointed for I was robbed of 500 and some few more bucks for a dish that could not fill my tummy. The food, on the other hand was nicely made and had fresh veggies but the amount they gave incomparison to the price, is very very dissapointing. The dip was good too. But quantity-wise, it is meagre.

Will come back for more, but will keep in mind the proportions served.
Happy eating guys,
Cheers! :)

Walked in with my daughter and wife one Tuesday afternoon. Seating ourselves in the food court, we decided to order.

My wife wanted a shawarma (without lettuce), while I decided to try the kabab roll. We were served reasonably promptly. Once again service was on a nice platter, with a indent in the middle that contained a rather nice dip (hummus? not sure as I know nothing of Lebanese food). The shawarma was as good as the Ar-Han-Thai ones, if not better, and definitely not as spicy. The kabab roll was not so happy. Had a strange taste. Whether that is normal or not I will not be able to say. These are priced at about Rs 150 each, which is perhaps overpriced. The quantity was somehow on the lesser side.

Once again, a place that could and should have been better.

Thankfully, the bottled water was charged for at MRP.
