I have recently visited this restaurant. The environment and food quality was awesome. And specially the manager Mr. Tanmay Josh is great person with a charming behaviour and personality. My family like him a lot as he always arrange a comfortable place for us, though there is lots of crowd. He always served us delicious and special items for that day. Thats why we visit this place once in a month..

It is a wonderful restaurant with good and tasty foods. I have visited this restaurant several times and have recommended to many. I like the hospitality out here and every staff is so cordial. The manager Mr Tonmoy is outstanding. A great gentleman. Always he had taken good care of us with a great hospitality. 
He is the heartthrobe of the restaurant. 
I am looking forward to visit it again and again.

Situated on the outram street, this place serves good food for quite a long time. Located at the 1st floor, the steps that follow gives a vintage feeling. Quite a croudy placr but the service is fast. Being a multicuisine restaurant, it serves all kind of good you want. Had some chinese dishes there. The prawn tobanjian is a must try. Will visit again for something else someday.

The outlet has one of the best G.M. in the service industry. We go to Tangerine just because of Mr. JOSH we don't even place order our guest from outside Kolkata also know him. I advise everyone to go there and take Josh' s advise before placing the order.

Lovely place and perhaps I can place it in the middle of fine dining and a good restaurant. The place is Outram Street and the silence is stunning. The glass walls make it more inviting since it's on the first floor and bang opposite is the Nature park. They are best known for their continental fare. I had lamb and it was tender. Have been here a multiple number of times since it's just next door for me. Pricing is a little on the higher side but it's worth it. Parking is not an issue as more often than not the lane has less traffic. Service is good.

On a lazy sunday noon, we headed to tangerine in theatre road for a lunch. from our last visit , which happened quite a long time back, this place has undergone positive changes with a separate party zone carved out from the seating arrangements. the decor is simple yet classy. i for one, always believe in food , rather than the decor, doing the talking.( After all, not many of us  visit  a restaurant for sight seeing or  for observing the sofa material or chandelier brand. ) to begin our journey of satisfying the growling tummy, we had sweet corn soup accompanied with american corn. i must admit, the soup was indeed a soup and not a concoction  of boiled water with few diced vegetables. even the american corn was tasty. in the main course we had chilly garlic noodles and manchurian. both were par excellence. to round off the lunch, brownie with a dollop of vanilla left a "dil maange more" desire as we left the venue. price though is on a higher side but still worth every penny. meal for 2 with a small kid will just pinch you a pink currency note.

We visited this place in January for a family lunch. The menu chosen by Mr. Tanmoy Josh was simply superb. Although we opted for Chinese food, their dishes were a unique fusion of indian and chinese recipes. The mustard fish is a must try, and the virgin mohita was exceptionally refreshing. The hospitality and ambience was great as well! We highly recommend this place to all.

Went for lunch with a colleague looking for a lunch buffet. Disappointed to see that buffet is not served n had to settle for A la carte. 
Decent cozy place with a nice atmosphere. Seating was comfortable n they gave us good service. Not too many people to start with but it slowly got more in the late evening. 
Starters of green apple and orange mojitos was good though they made it from a crush and dint use fresh fruits for that. Since it was a veggie day for us we had limited choices but they still had a lot in their menu.. Had very good crispy chilly baby corn along with chilly garlic noodles, veg manchurian and garlic bread. One of the best crispy corns I ever had. Other things were ok nothing great abt it. The servings were of good size but the place is a little costly for the location n the taste. 
In the desert we had a chocolate brownie with ice cream n lots of hot chocolate on it. Was good n tasty if u love chocolate. 
Overall a nice place for a good time. Need to try the non veg stuff before saying more.

Went for a family dinner. We ordered a number of dishes and some of them absolutely stood out. Golden fried prawn were just fabulous and fish trifule was also excellent. Also, the honey mustard fish, hot n garlic fish was worth mentioning. The service was good too. Overall a nice place. But slightly overpriced, out pocket pinch was 14K for a group of 10 people which included drinks for just 2 people.

I went to this dining paradise on my brother 's birthday... Yes, I called it paradise because the food is heavenly in taste.. The ambiance is beautiful..But they do promise valet parking but don't entrust your cars to the people there as they have damaged our car greatly by hitting the car against the wall while parking it..the people they have employed in the valet parking is worthless.. In compensation to the that the manger had only "sorry" for us..Nyz regarding the you must try the mustard fish; dry chilly chicken, grilled vegetables;chicken reshmi kabab to name a few... You can also try the roasted chicken with roasted bhekti and grilled vegetables..for dessert even the chicken briyani is awesome.

The buffet highly disappointed me and would not recommend to anyone. But I want all of you to pay attention to the billing they do, they add VAT on the service tax charged total amount. This practice is not done by any restaurants and I personally feel the billing is not correct, as double taxation is not allowed, I am in discussion with tax experts on the definitions and rules in W.B VAT ACT 2003, please correct me if I am wrong or else lets together fight against such billing actions.

We went to Tangerine for dinner last night.
This one is one Outram Street right next to Anamika Khanna's studio.

The restaurant is on the first floor.

We ordered :
Cream of Mushroom soup : It was one creamiest and yummiest soups I have had in Kolkata. It was full of Mushroom pieces with a strong hint of blackpepper and parsley. I will definitely go back for it.

Man chow soup: It  was good but not great, maybe we ordered a number of bowls , that's why the taste got lost due to the quantity prepared together.

Starters:
Chilli Paneer : The Paneer was well tossed and the capsicum and onions were crunchy. I really enjoyed this dish even though I'm not exactly a Paneer fan. I went in for a second helping as well.

Veg Tandoori platter: I somehow found it average and lacking in flavour.

Crispy Golden corn: the Corn kernel were crisp and well tossed but the flavour was slightly on the subtle side.

Cheese barrels: Barrel shaped cheese nuggets served with a side of coleslaw salad. This one was apt for cheese lovers. 

Corn Palak: The corn palak was really nice the spinach gravy was well balanced and the Corn kernel were crunchy and juicy.

Dal Makhani: The Dal was really well simmered and a really nice one. Salt content was perfect so was the texture.

Paneer Butter Masala: I really liked the gravy. The Paneer dishes here are good.

Assorted Breads:
Masala Kulcha
Butter Naan
They were quite big in per piece size.

Raita: This one was a clear winner. Thick , creamy , tomato and onion for the crunch factor and beautifully flavoured. Ordered a second helping.

Pan fried noodles: Ordered only one Chinese dish for the main course. This is a perfect meal on its own. It was made with dark soy sauce just the way I like it. It was really good. But somehow most Chinese dishes were a little subtle for my taste. 

The servers were really good. The place was a house full on Saturday evening. Really enjoyed the delicious meal with family.

We landed up at Tangerine on a hungry Monday afternoon. The staff was extremely cordial and welcoming. We ordered Fish in chilli mustard sauce and Doodhiya kebab for starters. You HAVE to eat it to believe it! Simply amazing. Pan fried chicken noodles and red pepper chicken followed suit. Food just kept getting better. The hot apple tart and bull's eye (dessert) were custom made to fight those Monday Blues! Go try!

Pati Chinese Restaurant...not worth the fuss.
Have been frequenting this place for a while and the dramatic fall of the place is comparable to the collapse of Indian Batting line up on an overcast Lord's wicket. Lets talk ambiance which is average to ordinary. Let's Let's talk menu. There are many speciality Italian dishes mentioned there but i really doubt if the chef can cook any. I Say this because everytime I have come here, I have ordered different types of pastas and received none. Let's come to food and prices. Food is ok. Nothing exuberant. But prices on the other hand....you would rather be eating at a 5star restaurant. Desserts moderate. Service is below average to rock bottom.Overall you can save a lot of cash if u check out other alternatives.

Good food but horrendous service. -1 for that and another 0.5 for management behavior. They seem to not consider customer feedback but instead argue back and give excuses for bad service. The quality of food is the reason it is packed most of the times; but I don't think that gives the staff a liberty to behave in a different way.

Worst customer service ever.
First of all they don't have high chairs for babies which means it's not baby friendly.
Secondly I ordered bisleri water, poured it in a glass and slurped it half way through only to realize a big dead mosquito inside.
After summoning the server, the only response I get is that ma'am I am sorry.
It's very easy to get away with a sorry but ideally they should have thrown in a discount.
Very disappointed!

I have always wanted to visit this place off Outrum street. Tangerine has enticed with its solitary presence amidst a street laden with lush green. Really liked the ambience. A perfect place for a date lunch. Usually it doesn't get crowded and I will prefer going there for lunch over dinner. Why? You will know when you go. They served very palatable Indian and Chinese; I was not too happy with the continental.

Initially we had a tough time finding this address. If you’re new in the city and planning to locate this place, you might waste your precious time of the evening.

It’s a warning – this is more like a bar and (very) less a family restaurant. So, if you’re planning to have that “non-alcoholic family time”, better avoid this place. The service is good, although the staff looks little under trained. The ambiance is not that great and the dark environment (read, extremely low lighting) might cause you irritation. It was even hard to find out, how the food on my plate did actually look like. No, I’m not kidding !

Well, the place is little up-market (only) in terms of cost. The prices are exorbitant compared to its quality & taste. In spite of a wide range of menu, nothing really stands out. Although, something which tickled my taste bud were – Slice Fish in Chilli Mustard & Murg Tikka Lababdar.

 Overall, visit this place – only – if you do not believe in phrase called “value-for-money”.

The ambience is good, the food is exquisite. I happened to visit on Ashtami of 2015. The starters though few in number are finger licking - fish fry (must try- a different flavour),double fried chicken. The main course had baked chicken (like Alfredo), prawns,mutton, Biriyani, crab, noodles, fish, salads - a nice mix of Chinese, continental & Indian dishes. The desserts are very much normal, nothing new that would make ur taste buds any more eager.

Used to be a great place once upon a time. Have had some great time with friends and family there. Still remember the table overlooking the park with a lake, the happy hours, tandoori broccoli, Shepard's pie and much more. However, my last visit after a long time was very disappointing. Quality of food has deteriorated, service has gone bad and the place somehow lost that old charm. Would love to go back there to relive the past.

Have visited this place on various occasions.. And I prefer its Indian cuisine over Chinese.. The Chinese is way too indianised..
Also I find the ambience too dark.. A little more lights and music would brighten the place and make it more lively.as only thing u hear is the chitter charter of other tables..

The service was too slow.. And the waiters were too confused.. They were repeating the orders several times.which kinda disrupts a good conversation. 

Coming to food..
Schezuan chilli babycorn- recommended to request for hot garlic sauce its good.. Just added schezuan sauce.. Gives it a good flavor..
Reshmi kabab- the chutney had almost no flavor and too watery.. The kebabs were good though.. 
Chilli garlic noodles- too sweet.  Hardly u get the aroma or flavors of chilli or garlic..
Fried rice- normal well cooked .
Corn and potato in Manchurian sauce.- the gravy was insufficient and the corn cakes too mushy... 

Virgin colada- good refreshing.

Well rest I guess will try Indian again too change my mood for the place..

It's at least 15 years that we are visiting Tangerine.From the times Sharad Kapoor could be seen sharing an adjoining table.
A heritage building adjoining the Outram club on a road less travelled added to the aura.I still remember waiting on the stairs to get a table,especially the coveted balcony two seaters.

Goan prawn curry,the spraghetti,the penne pasta,the buffet,the kababs......all our favourites and all 4/5.

Last visit showed a pale version of our fond memories but tangerine remains and retains a very special position in our hearts.

Goan prawn curry,the spraghetti,the penne pasta,the buffet,the kababs......all our favourites and all 4/5.

Last visit showed a pale version of our fond memories but tangerine remains and retains a very special position in our hearts.

Was there with my family for dinner. The place is very comfortable and relevant space for dinning with a good and awesome menu for veg as well as non vegies. The staff team is patient and very attentive towards the customer. The food was also according to what we needed and was modified as we said. Each serving is enough for a group of 5 people with a good presentation and wouth watering taste.

Visited this place after ages and what a treat it turned out to be. We ordered an all vegetarian spread and everything was delicious especially the karare chana in the starters. A must must try. Their black is also another dish that stands out. The service was a little disappointing. Slow and not welcoming at all. Prices are fine for the quantity and quality of food being served. A must try. Would definitely go back even if just for the karare chana.

For people looking for beverages, it used to have happy hours 1:1 offer.. Don't know if it's still present..

Visited this outlet with colleagues as part of a Team Lunch. The ambience, first is very soothing as soon as you enter the restaurant. The interior is well decorated and Lighting is properly set up. The staff is courteous and try to make the entire meal a valuable experience.

As it was a office lunch, we chose the buffet spread which was around 650 per person inclusive of taxes. At the given price, the limited buffet choices didnt matter at all. There was a soup,  3-4 salads, 1 rice and noodle preparation, unlimited Assorted Indian Breads, 1 Chinese Main course, 1 delicious Continental preparation and 3 Indian Main Courses. For Main courses, non veg consisted of Fish and Chicken. Deserts were around 4-5 varieties.
The best main course item was the continental dish "Canelonii". The chinese cuisine is where the restaurant could improve a lot. Overall, a good experience, considering the low price of the buffet, in the locality that the restaurant is located in.

It's a family restaurant. Their food menu is diverse. The staff is very courteous and can make changes to the dish as per one's convenience and health. They are a multi-cuisine restaurant with some amazing North Indian food. I even love their baked dishes. 
My favourites are:
1. Dudhiya Kabab
2. Karare Channe
3. Exotic Fruit Salad
4. Chicken Salad

Before Kolkata got crowded by cafes and restuarants at every corner, Tangerine situated on Outram Street in the British Building was THE restuarant i would go to. It welcomes you with a good old fashioned staircase with a red carpet. The food is delightful and the best part is how delicate the place is. The staff is really helpful but the place is just a tad small. I love the decor but the food beats it all. I would definitely recommend the 'Corn Flitters'  as it is my favorite and all the other starters are a delight. I would definitely recommend a visit.

The food quality is good. But we went there with 18 total members. The services are quite slow and you have to wait quite a bit while shifting from starters to main course. Of course it can be because of the number of people. But otherwise it's reasonable and affordable.

Not the Tangerine I remembered. Though it had been years. 

Around 10 pm on a Tuesday night I expect it to be sparse. But the service could have been more energetic. 

The tiny cockroach that popped out of the menu embarrassed the waiter. My wife and I chose to ignore it as an exception. The Basil Chicken was too oily. They could not provide coasters for my whisky tumbler even on my asking for one. The plates were not warmed, though they seldom are nowadays in most places. At least the Risotto was presentable. 

The view from the window looking out on Outram Street was a treat, especially in the rain. 

Disappointed, not worth the pricey tag. Lets hope it was a bad day in office for them.

Well getting started, I would like to make it clear I give points for both food  , ambiance and service . And Tangerine is one restaurant which I love not only because  of its food but also because of its incredibly sober and elegant decor. Also its not too loud on your senses.
Coming , to the reason most important reason I  visit Tangerine is food . They serve a variety of cuisines, but they do score in Indian and Continental food. Chinese is decent with not much taste variation so not a cuisine to judge a restaurant. Their appetizers are really good . Since I don't drink mocktails is something I try there and more often than not they do surprise me. 
Deserts are not so extraordinary but its goes well the rest of the food.
I recommend everyone to try this once. ????

Firstly, the space and ambience of this place could have been much better. Though the food is not that disappointing. The starters are quite a delight. Though the dishes keep on changing and vary throughout the month, it never goes below its standards as per the reputation. The main course is pretty okay like other places. Not very impressive though. But the main USP are the desserts. Last time, I went there, I guess I fedup almost whole of my pocket-pinch only by digging into desserts. So  according to me, they should never degrade atleast the quality of their desserts if not other dishes. Its their main thing which can attract people of all ages.

Went there yesterday with a foreign delegate. We parked car far due to rush,  walked to the place. Suddenly the guard stopped us and in not so professional or friendly tone warned us to go inside only if we were part of private party going on there. Whole place been booked & only 'normal computer printed sorry for inconvenience' sheet stuck somewhere, which could be 99% of the time missed by guests passing it. Highly disappointed by way we were spoken to. Am sure the food and service inside are great, but hope you will put more effort in training the first faces we face outside, as soon as we arrive.

Tangerine, owned by the actor Sharad Kapoor, is located in Outram Street beside the club in the same building that hosts the Anamika Khanna boutique. The restaurant has been one of my favourites though i have not visited the place that frequent enough, dont know why !!! It is very popular for its continental dishes but i love the north indian preparations over any other cuisine served here. But that does not mean the continental food is any less worthy. It is pretty evident that the place boasts a pretty long and expansive menu and in short, every item is great and worth the price spent. 

The restaurant is located on the first of the building and is pretty compact that i dislike. Getting a seat for dinner is an issue here at times, moreso if a private party is going on inside. The decor is simple, seats are comfortable with a nice view.  The staff is polite, warm and courteous. The prices are on higher side if you compare it to the restaurants nearby especially on park street but the food is worth it.

Pasta and risotto preparation are really nice. Canneloni, pasta al fungi or pasta aglio olio are pretty good though i am not such a fan of the ravioli. I have recently been suggested their marrakesh hotpot or something sounding that sort though i have not tried it yet. For the north indian , kebabs are very very good. Kebab platter is meant for two persons only and is a delight. Dal tangerine is just tooo good and phaldari kofta or subz handi go very well with it. Rotis are very well made and customised to your liking. Biryani is decent.  I have not had their chinese food yet so cant comment about it. For deserts, they do not offer a lot of options and of the lot, brownie is my favorite. 

I feel tangerine's location is the biggest advantage as well as its biggest disadvantage depending on bow you perceive it. But for me, its location outside the rush zone in a pretty calm and peaceful stretch, works for me though the restaurant is generally packed inside. 

Pros:
Great location
Diverse menu
Great food
Polite staff service

Cons:
High prices
Compact seating
Long waiting time for a table
Limited options for dessert

I went for a family dinner at tangerine on 30.05.2013 and i am very impressed by the changes i observed.I saw a few new faces (servers) and the service was hospitable.Our order was
1)Shaolin sticks- The were soft ,filled with veggies and tossed in a sweet and spicy plum sauce.I would highly recommend this starter to everyone.Also 8 sticks in one portion was very satisfying.
2)Veg platter consisting of paneer tikka,grilled gobi,potatoes,and seekh kebab.It was prepared very well however i was disappointed seeing american corn stuffed in the seekh kebab filling :/ the platter was served with a green mint and yogurt chutney.
3) fresh lime sweet,which was normal :p
4)Fettucine Bellanapole-Was tasty and the portion was good.However little on the oily side.The pasta was a little above el dante though flavourful.
5)Crepes with cottage cheese, corn and leeks with pesto which was the star of the day.It came in a huge plate with complimentary salad and was excellent to taste.

Overall the dining experience was good and i am very impressed with the changes i have noticed.
Keep it up!
Oh and our total bill was 1911/- all inclusive.

One of the best fine dining restaurants in kolkata. This place has a mark of its own. Superb ingredients, wisely chosen, very nicely prepared, presented with a humble but graceful garnishing in an eyecatching and mouth watering presentation. Attentive and friendly staff, a million dollar view ( specially on a rainy day afternoon in front of the park), brilliant taste, in a nutshell that's Tangerine. Try their whole grilled kolkata bekti, tiger prawn in béarnaise butter, and hall of fame dessert bull's eye. One of the gem in kolkata gourmet.

Tangerine.....was a bit difficult to find. The location is a bit interior. However we were on the occasion of Durga Puja. The welcome drink was nice.. AAM Panna. The buffet was excellent. It covered a variety of foods starting from Bengali delicacy luchi begunbhaja.....Biriyani to some Mexican dishes. The desert was perfect, contained mild to heavy sweet items. 

The a-la-carte menus were also different

A good ambience, enjoyable with family.

Seat Tips: If you are a couple, take the seats on the balcony(in the first pic). The view is awesome in the evening.

before kolkata got crowded with some humungous amount of restaurants serving up buffet,this was one of the few places people would go for a buffet brunch.its a lazy walk from st.xavier's college,and a nice and quiet neighborhood.the interior is comfy and alluringly designed and lit.the buffet consists of indian chinese and continental items,the pasta being my choice of the lot.there are many non veg dishes,so the selection is extensive.the dessert section is also very laudable,the caramel custard being the most impressive offering.the pocket pinch is reasonable,so this is a highly recommendable place.

I read brilliant reviews about this place, so i decided to visit! Firstly, from the very moment I set my eyes on it, i was impressed. Brilliant decor! The inside is nicely and neatly furnished with big glass windows that let you stay in touch with the outside too!
Secondly, I had intended to explore their menu! Well I was pleasantly surprised to see that they were also offering a buffet lunch @400!! And their buffet spread was intriguing. They had Indian, Chinese, and Italian with desserts! Naturally we opted for the buffet and thankfully! For Indian they had peas polao, daal, paneer preparation,mutton Rogan Josh! The peas polao was nice,daal was heavenly,paneer was good and the mutton was tender.
 For Chinese they had noodles and prawns, the prawn was a bit spicy but very nice! For Chinese they also had some very spicy vegetables,too spicy in my opinion!
 For the Italian portion there was pasta in sort of a white sauce, which was extremely nice, and Baked chicken that was nice and sour and creamy! Again there was another vegetable that turned out to be very spicy! Sadly i can't appreciate too much spice so can't say how others would like it! 
Now for the desserts They had ice cream, and darsaan. Now their darsaan was to sticky in my opinion but yummy! The also had brownie which had a hard crust but was sinful to taste all the same! And lastly I fell in love with their Caramel Custard, in spite of being full i had to go on! Perfect! 
Also if i may point out, we were late for the buffet, since they are listed to close down at 3, but we could eat till 4! :) 
 The waiters were eager to assist and very friendly! Quick and accurate service! I would suggest all of you to visit this place! Enjoy! :)

Judging a book by its cover is not a wise decision. Located at Outram Street and housed in an old British building with wooden stairs and a beautiful decor welcoming you , you would naturally be expecting a grand dinner. The decor is wonderful. The lighting is soothing and romantic. The staff is courteous and polite and the prices seem just a tad steep but the descriptions seem delightfully tempting. While suggestions from the host is appreciated there is a thin line between  suggestion and inference. What seemed odd was the hosts over enthusiasm to suggest dishes and try and influence you in his suggestions. I made a mistake by choosing one whose description seemed rather appealing.  My question is if a restaurant has a dish on offer it should be as good in quality as any other. We were a company of four. My chicken roulade with bacon and chashew jus was a disaster. This dish reminds me of a certain fictional mother who said that if ' it ain't fried it ain't bacon' . Bacon needs to be crunchy or at least be roasted and this bacon was a mass of slimy disgusting meat (due to its texture) inside not very soft chicken. With an over usage of what i believe Worcestershire sauce ,due to its sour tamarind like taste my evening was ruined. What gave me some joy was that my little brother seemed to love his pork chops. My uncle was also all praise for his Seafood Plaki since it was filled with sea-food and the taste suited my uncle's palate . From tasting a little of my brother's pork chops it seemed quite tasty. My aunt's New Orleans Jambalaya had failed to satisfy her taste buds as well. So I would say that perhaps this restaurant has a few signature dishes for which one might visit again. Their offering of desserts is truly wonderful but the pricing is not. The airy light chocolate sponge cake with ganache icing which I believe has usage of alcohol and vanilla might be superb but its pricing is a big letdown. For that I believe something around Rs185 is quite enough, for those of us who bake and know a thing or two about the kitchen we know the costs and even with a good profit of the restaurant the extra Rs40 is completely undesirable. Some might like the host's interruption to engage customers with anecdotes but for some it might be a bit unwanted. In all taking the ambiance and a few selected dishes the place might be given a second chance. My suggestion is to know about its specialties beforehand.

One of the perfect places to eat chinese, thai, continental, italian , indian,(the list is really  long) cuisines in Kolkata is  Tangerine . It is one of my favourite places to eat. It is located in Outram Street which is a small lane which became famous just because of Tangerine such is the popularity of this place! : D ! It has a splendid ambience, obedient waiters ( quick service even though it is almost always crowded on weekends) and really good food.The sitting arrangement is a point to mention. The balcony and window seats are in quite demand. I would recommend that you have - (it's a long list)

i)have a soup ,any one you like because each and ever one of them brings such taste that they wreak havoc on your tongue, giving you another reason to love this restaurant!
ii)  have the prawn malabar
iii)Crabs in Spicy Coconut Curry
iv)Pan fried noodles
THESE ARE THE MAIN THINGS YOU SHOULD EAT.
 But, all the other delicacies are equally delicious!! 
MUST TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)

This is one place to eat out where you will never have to face a shortage of choices. The cuisine ranges from Italian, Chinese, Thai, Indian to what not! Located conveniently at Outram Street, it has a lovely ambience, especially if you can get a balcony seat, but these are as in demand as the window seats for first-time fliers.

The spread is sumptuous, the staff extremely helpful and will go to any extent to make your meal a delightful one. The starters are lovely, but the Oriental selection is the one that will land you in seventh heaven. This is like a museum, you are wrong if you want to experience it in one go. You have to come back again and again, and explore the choicest of their menu. Do try out Kangee Naro in Chilly Plum Sauce, Fettucine Alfredo, Tetrazzini, Crabs in Spicy Coconut Curry, Prawn Malabar, Thermidor, Plaki, and the pan fried section. Boil it down with their Kalhua Mousse - a favourite of many, I'm sure.

Their ingredients are sourced from authentic locations and are not the readymade ones available in the market. It is unpretentious, and committed to serving quality food. The experience is more like a whirlwind world tour, shifting from Greek delicacies now to a Tibetan treasure the next moment and following it up with an Italian recipe.. 

Verdict: I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is thoroughly bored with the static plateau of flavours that other places offer.

One of the best restaurants in Kolkata. Food is awesome and service is really good. Usually I don't go for suggestions made by staff but here I can just rely on them.

Very quiet ambiance, roadside tables have amazing view. Lighting is just perfect to give you that dim light romantic feeling.

Doodhiya kebab and Tortino are must try for vegetarians.

Bitterly disappointed with the food and service yesterday at Tangerine. On ordering the Pan American Platter and Gatengain for the entree we were brusquely informed by the waiter that there was no garlic bread and no frankfurters either, so they wouldn't be able to provide either. Trying not to write off the place just yet, we ordered the Greek Seafood Plaki and Lamb Chops. 

The Lamb Chops were hard, overdone and the sauce was nondescript. The Seafood Plaki consisted of baked fish kebabs. Whatever was served tasted BAD and left a horrible sour aftertaste. Perhaps an indication that the old Tangerine has lost its zest?

This was my second visit to the restaurant..Overall we were a tad bit disappointed..The crumb fried prawns were good.. We had ordered for a Pan Asian mixed noodles and Hakka noodles and Fish in Chilli Mustard Sauce for the Main Course.. The Pan Asian Mixed noodles was really bad - it seemed as if it was cooked in a hurry..the other two dishes were good..not excellent though..

A quaint white wrought iron chair at the entrance, then wooden stairs lead you to the first-floor restaurant Tangerine. The decor is simple and tasteful and the servers are polite and unobtrusive. The menu is a foodie's delight and surprisingly reasonable. My husband and I had visited recently for our anniversary and had a lovely time. We had gone specifically for the European food and were not disappointed. 

I had ordered the grilled pork chops, which were generous and juicy, accompanied by a lovely mash with herbs, veggies and an awesome caramelly, rich jus! My hubby had ordered the Shepherd's Pie (the New Orleans Jambalaya which was his first preference was not available). It was a good enough pie, good flavours, though of course my mum's shep's pie is the best! Both portions were good, especially accompanied by soft, crusty bread rolls.

The only negative - a very loud table behind near us who could be heard all over the place and made no effort to pipe down. People, restaurants are public places, so decorum is of the essence. 

This is where management should intervene, though I'm not sure whether it's a common practice in India. When I was young and our father used to take us almost every weekend to one of the top restaurants on Park Street, famous for its Chelo, the owner would quietly sit in a corner table and keep a discreet eye on everything (I hope his son is following in his footsteps). The Manager was always at hand and would equally quietly handle errant patrons.

aawesome food but poor service. very unfriendly waiters. whenever you show for discount cards they say it's not valid. but they put their names in all offers to get customers. club solitaire discount is valid on all days nut when you go and ask on weekend they will claim its not valid.

This place is right next to my college and I frequent it for mostly lunches hosted by my friends. This place has never disappointed. Their buffet is brilliant. Love the food and the service. Cordial staff! 

One must try their lunch buffet which costs roughly around 400 per person. Totally worth the price!

I have also visited them once for dinner. Must say that it is one of the finest dining places. Great candle light ambience. Loved the entire experience.

Today was my third visit to Tangerine and trust me this place has never disappointed me. Excellent Contintental food. Would strongly recommend Chicken Roulade, Poulet Apulia and Grilled Beckti. Grab the window seat and the experience gets all the more better. For the location and quality of food and service, this should definitely be up there in Kolkata's Top Ten

Make sure you get the table beside the glass window that overlooks a patch of green on Outram street. You might want to indulge in their very versatile buffet - which spreads from Thai to Italian to Chinese to Mughlai to Indian. Rest assured it wont disappoint you.

The staff is also very friendly. Tangerine scores high on service with prompt service - to the extent of them serving something out of the buffet you have not tried it.

I find their kebabs rather tough in texture - maybe because the batch was not fresh. This might be something they should work upon. Prawn Malabar Curry is probably the thing to have - big drops of prawn in a saucy curry.

Quite accessible (by car and taxi only) as well. A thumbs up!

used to love Tangerine but now the food has become dry and tasteless! Prawns are too dry and so is the fried rice! Also very expensive! Not worth it!

Tangerine.. Have been to this restaurant at least 50 times, and believe me, I am Not Exaggerating. It is my Dad's favorite restaurant and to a great extent, mine too sos much so that I remember the entire menu by heart and the staff there recogise me very well :D All my relatives and friends are tired of listening that we went to Tangerine for dinner! Haha :D but believe me it is one of the best restaurants in Calcutta, at least I think so. Do go there!
It is really awesome - everything from starters to main course to desserts :D

The menu is HUGE !!!!
and have been here 5 -6 times and never been disappointed, especially like the balcony seating which is candle lit...

hav not tried their indian food, but the continental and oriental spread is to die for. wonderful selection of soups and must mention their kaluha mousse is smooth and rolls on ur tongue like elixir. 

some traditional dishes and come fusion.. all r good. 

looking forward to another visit soon.

My family loves fine dining and Tangerine is simply "a perfect place to be". 
We simply enjoy the food quality that is excellent; the atmosphere and above all the staff attentiveness.
The food out here is so delicious that we can't ever wait to come back!
Tangerine rocks :)

The restaurant is known for its consistency. The grilled fish has been tasting the same for the last 10 years.

I love the Continental food but prefer the Oriental over it. 
Recently the restaurant went through a refurbishment and now the is ambiance fantastic, just like the food.

I usually dine in the day, with Diplomats and we have always been surprised by the quality of food.

Its also a cozy place for a romantic dinner with the dim lighting.

A package in itself; I patronize it and will continue to do so.

An unpretentious restaurant owned by small time actor Sharad Kapoor and run by his chef brother. Heres the info:

1. Walk up one flight of stairs to get to the restaurant
2. The chef makes the effort to be as authentic with his cooking as possible. He sources his ingredients of non indian foods from abroad.
3. A very moderate priced lunch buffet for the location
4. Honest, comfortable, unpretentious, well made food
5. I love the cream of mushroom soup made from scratch - not from packets
6. Great view of the lake

this is by far the worst and most characterless food available in Kolkata at fine-dine prices. tasteless, hard chicken and pathetic lamb chops marked my day out at tangerine!you'll firstly get edible food, and then of course a few times better tasting food, at the dozens of joints lining park street. tangerine's not the place!

The food at this grandiosely decorated multi-cuisine restaurant never fails to satisfy. Where can one start? Well, for starters, there's lavish buffet spread during weekend lunches, which will leave you gasping at the variety. The a la carte menu boasts of Chinese, Italian, Indian and Thai dishes and everything is simply wonderful. The pasta sauces are creamy, the Thai gravies are flavourful, the Chinese spread is multitudinous and the biryanis are meaty and plentiful.
