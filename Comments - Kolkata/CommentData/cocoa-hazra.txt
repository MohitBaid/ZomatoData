"I wouldn’t be honest if I say that even baking a batch of cupcakes and piping out clean, pretty rosettes on them are very fulfilling. But the more challenging, difficult designs when complete, are extremely satisfying.

I usually keep at least 4-5 days’ times when taking up big, complicated orders. That’s when I visualize and make the cake in my head. So once it comes out the way I imagine it, its exhausting but very fulfilling."

The baker brothers, the cake war, the great bakers does it ring a bell? Yes it does fabulous cakes with a gourmet touch! Is it possible in Kolkata? In this crowd of mama Mia, flury's a lawyer by profession and a good friend is trying to change the experience of customised cakes!
we ordered the butter cream ganache cupcakes. Sure the big shots of the business makes them. But as soon you bite into the one made in Cocoa you know it's different, rich creamy goodness makes you want to dig into more. Then, comes the surprise a chocolate Micky figure waits to great you in the middle really amazing. I must say, I thought that the picture was photo shopped but when saw it in reality, it looked the same as the one in display. Now the mustache cake! A white sugar fondont covered the creamy cappuccino flavoured cake with a chocolate mustache. Yummy nothing more to say, a feast for the eyes and taste buds. I personally vouch that everyone reading this review should order and I bet she will give the biggies a run for their money. So in all, if you like to dig into yummy cakes that sooth your eyes and taste buds do stop by to cocoa, you will not be disappointed and will visit again! To top it all of she has baked for the prince of Kolkata, yes Dada Sourav Ganguly has tasted her delicacies.

Their cupcakes are amazing. So are their cakes, but somehow I have a special spot for the filled cupcakes. You can get the design, size, flavour customized according to your requirements.

The cheesecake literally left me drooling. The walnut caramel cake was simple and old fashioned and comforting, but a tad bit pricey.
Just one thing - you should start home delivery soon!

After hearing great things about cocoa from 2 of my very dear friends and highly fascinated by the unique designs of the cakes i was determined on trying them. So when it was the b'day of one of my collegues i along with my labmates ordered cupcakes from here. We ordered mickey cupcakes with buttercream frosting and they tasted yummilaceous. It was fluffy soft and the buttercream melted beautifully inside the mouth. Frankly we were quite sad that the cupcakes got over so fast. But from then on, this place became a favourite amongst all of us. So again when we had a farewell party today we unanimously decided on ordering from here. We ordered a moustache cake and it was amazing. It had coffee cream flavour and was covered with fondant. The design was extremely cute with a moustache and buttons. The taste was equally delicious and flawless. We were extremely happy and satisfied.The price of the cakes are very reasonable and at par with the quality. This place is definitely a clear winner. Overall,thumbs up to you for such an awsome effort!!!As for me... i can't wait to order from here again...

Now if ure looking for great designer cakes at rates that are absolutely reasonable...look no further. In fact I do not remember ordering cakes from any other joint since couple o cakes launched. The coolest part is that Couple o' cakes will first listen to what u have to say and then make a cake that is just perfect for the occasion. However if u think ure way more imaginative, u can just tell them what to make and they'll do so without any flaw.  The cakes are all works of art, made with a lot of love n care and are absolutely delicious. It's a new venture and has the potential of reaching greatness.

BTW...quicksand for life!! \m/ (inside stuff)
