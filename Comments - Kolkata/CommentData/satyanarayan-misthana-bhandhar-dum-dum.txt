This sweet confectionary is located near Northern Avenue, Dumdum.

It keeps a wide variety of sweets.

Ambience is shabby.

Service is nice.

Tried Samosa, jalebi & Rosogolla. All were nice and fresh with a reasonable price tag.

A decent local sweet shop.

Sweets are neither too tasty nor are the size and quality appropriate with the price. Not much cordial staff.  Overall there are lot of better sweet shops in paikpara dumdum station area better than this one.

Oh My God! The age old sweet shop of my locality is on Zomato. Wow! This came as a surprise. I am actually taken aback. Their collection of sweets can any day smack your sweet buds like a hammer. From Rasogallo to Jalebi, everything is available at Satyanarayan Mistanna Bhandar. I generally don't have a sweet tooth. But, their delicacies are literally to die for. They have another branch near Dumdum Metro Station. 4 stars. Keep up the legacy peeps!

My family's favourite sweet corner. Variety of sweets with samosa and jalebi in morning. 

They also has a caterar to cater for occassions. And that is also one of the best in the locality. :-)
