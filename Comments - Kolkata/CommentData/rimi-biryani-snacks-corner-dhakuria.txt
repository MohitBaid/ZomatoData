Food quality was awesome,biryani was fantabulus and especially chicken kosha was marvelous,price was within the budget.Plus they serve hot and quality food.I gave an order for 50 people for my office events,they were 15 minute late in giving the delivery due to bad weather but after having the biryani and kosha we just can say is well done.
you all can try the food once.
