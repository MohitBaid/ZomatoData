This place is located at a 2 min walking distance from Taratala more and also 10 mins from my college. Found this place one evening and decided to try it out. We were 4 of us. Although the place is very small m the food they make is AMAZING. 
We ordered Non-veg Chinese chopuey, Chicken Tai Pao, Chicken Pan Fried Momo and Cowde gyathuk(thukpa).
The food they make can give tough competitions to other famous momo joints. This place is a must try.
