Eighty8+ kafe, located almost at exide and near metro gate no.4, is one of the best cafes for college goers to hangout. The ambience's nice. The staff is very friendly and ready to help you at anything and everything. Their music collection is one of the best among all the cafes in Kolkata. The nice touch is that it has a seperated area for non-smokers where no hookah is allowed;it's only for eating purposes. The hookah offered here is extremely good and pocket friendly. 
Best dishes-
Cottage cheese sizzler
Momo sizzler
Mix sauce pasta
Chilli garlic noodles
The drinks offered are large enough for 2-3 persons to share it and have a large variety to offer- from KitKat shake to Oreo shake to Redbull virgin mojito.

This place offers nice food but the ambience is nothing to boast about. It looks very casual. Also the staff is not attentive. I liked the mixed sauce pasta and risotto. The cold coffee is very very large for one person.

The overall experience that we had was neither a disappointing one nor a very satisfying one. When we visited the place, there wasn't a crowd despite which the service was quite slow. We ordered the Four Cheese Pizza and repeated the order as we had liked it, but the second time around the pizza was entirely burnt. The drinks on offer are the usual kind and taste normal. The food was average with nothing standing out.

I had went there many a times with my fiancée, this place is really a good one to hangout. Foods taste are good especially Mexican rice with jacket potato I love it it must be tried by anyone who visit here, hookah is fabulous too good, if you visit here you will worth your money. Staffs are too friendly and courteous well behaved. As I went there after marriage with my wife 1st time the management treated us so good even the staffs which was adorable they even gave free drinks to us on behalf of eighty8 cafe. I love this place must visit place for hookah lovers

Had ordered for a fresh lime soda cheese grilled sandwich and a double apple flavoured hookah.
The sandwich was yum, hookah being superfine. The odd thing was that they served fresh lime on a giant glass which wasn't easy to have for single person.
Ambience was good, staffs were courteous, they even played a birthday song for my friend. 
Had a good experience altogether and would visit the place soon again to try out some other things I hv missed out.

This place isn't hard to find and once you enter, you'll really like the ambience...The place is really spacious and well lit...food was good...so was the hookah but the place was a little expensive...Also don't ask to go to the washroom because after seeing where it is, you might not want to visit again. The service was good...I found it really odd as to why they serve alcohol but it's not on the menu and they even give a kuchcha bill for it... otherwise I had a fun experience...place does need to improve at various places though

Nice and simple decor. The outdoor seating is under renovation and it seems like they're going to make it worth everything. 
Food: Ordered cheese nachos which was okay. The two dips were amazingly delicious. The SIZZLING BROWNIE is a must have. It was indeed a delight to the taste buds.
Beverage: Ordered kiwi Mojito. Could have been so much better.
Sheesha: Three chillam is a must try.
Look forward to visit again for that sizzling Brownie.

Location-Elgin road,beside PC chandra showroom.

This cafe is a very small place and has a very simple interiors in comparison to other cafe opening now a days.Its also quite expensive and not worth spending.

Service-The service they provide is fast and reliable and the staff is also very cooperative with their customers.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is too loud and the interiors are also very simple.A music will always be played in the background which is too loud for the place due to its size.

Food-There is nothing much to talk about this section.The food they provide is not much impressive to taste and the presentation is also very simple.Though the sheesha was good but overall the place was too expensive to visit.We had-

1:Indi jones
2:All in one
3:Jalapeno poppers
4:Mexican sizzler

Food-3.5/5
Service-4/5
Ambiance-3/5

This place is not worth visiting as you can find much better places in the area to hang around.😁😁

The visit was a brief one. The ambiance was nice but since this is a hookah joint the venting system should be improved. Otherwise the air felt very heavy at times. The KitKat shake was good and the cheese Maggi that I had was decent. Only con that I could find is that this is a veg joint and that is a problem with the non vegetarian people.

Well what can i say the only thing good about this place might just be its convenient location near Rabindra Sadan Metro Gate No.4.. We ordered 2 hookahs one of which was pretty bad and had to be changed twice.. Mexican rice with potatoes was okay.. And to top it off one of the staff made a huge mistake due to which we were overcharged.. All in all not impressed..!!

A cosy hookah place situated right next to PC Chandra Elgin road. Its just like a usual hookah lounge where u get loud music and dim lights. The USP of the place is the behavior of the staff members. They are extremely friendly and cordial. They are at your service all the time. The most interesting thing was the Tshirt worn by the staff members.. 
it was something like...

The best part of this new cafe is that ,it is easy to figure out the place. Located few steps outside the Rabindra Sadan metro gate no 4. 
Searching on zomato, got to see this new cafe,eighty8+ kafe.  Had an urge to go there.
Yesterday I went there with my friends. The ambience is quite good with a dark and minimum led lights. The music was too high and we requested the staffs to lower its volume few times but they didn't listen.
We ordered cheese corn balls,crispy chili babycorn,nachos chat. My friends also had all in one flavoured hookah. The food was good and tasty . We had a great time in the cafe.
I have a question. What is the significance of the name of the cafe?why is it named so?

The place is located near rabindra sadan Metro Station just beside PC Chandra Jewellers. I heard about it from friends. I did not like the ambience and decor one bit. It was really disappointing. The place is also really small. But the food and Sheesha were really good, and the price is also reasonable. Also there are many coupons available for this place and they also offer a number of combos. So if you want to just hang out and don't care much about the ambience, then you can visit this place. I on the other hand will not be visiting again.

The ambience is quite dark and mysterious. I liked the decor and the fact that they have a wall where they add stick-on papers with customer's review. Coming to the food, we ordered cheese balls which were yumm and the cappuccino was okayish. Overall it was a good but a little costly. Not being someone who loves hookah the place did not surprise me much.

Despite having really quirky décor around the café, the main USP of these quaint little café are the sheeshas nd foods. The relaxed atmosphere makes it the best place to unwind with friends on Elgin road after a long stressful day.

The ambience is good and the service is quite good, apart from that the music is really pathetic and they keep turning off the air conditioner which makes the place quite hot, I went to relax which turned out to be the exact opposite

The best place to hangout. Been a regular customer here since i got to know abt this place. Seesha , Fooding,  Ambience,  Management everything here is 5 out of five. The quality and price you provide is unbeatable.The place is like a second home to me. The offers you provide nd the service you give is just awesome. #In_love_with_this_place.❤

The worst place ever been to although the sheesha was good however the manahement first agreed to redeem the ewards first time offer but at the time of billing denied any such commitments which can be termed as CHEATING.....wont ever be visiting this shitty place again
Ps : Had there been an optiin for "0" rating the same would have been given

I would like to contradict with every one who wrote bad quality food I the cafe ...the cafe offers top quality food...whether u go with regular items like crispy chilli babycorn ..or items like mexican rice with jacket potato, even sweet lime soda was made perfect and their service was as fast as possibly we could not imagine .
Kudos to the team !!

Well to start with I would just say that this place is damn small! 

The hookah served by them was very AVERAGE. We ordered Rajnigandha flavor and paan flavor.. Both are just okay! 

In starters, Baby corn and French fries were really good....!!

Now to move towards food, magnolian rice was served with some sort of cream on top of it.. Magnolian noodles were very bad. Even though we asked for dry one they gave gravy noodles!

The cold drinks can were served.. Not even the standard size.. We were given the smallest cans of THUMSUP available in the market whose MRP is just ₹20..

The place has no comfortable seating options either which was an added disappointment..!

Heard how good their food is, and i was happy that i heard it all right. Pretty decent decor, nothing too great there.
As far as the service is concerned, there is just one word- amazing, super friendly and too courteous! They were so soft spoken, obliged every request and suggested great things to eat, and also played the music of our choice!
Coming to the food, i really liked the italian food. The pizza was very very good with sauted vegetables as toppings, the waiter favouring us with complimentary extra toppings- nice gesture i must say!
Then we tried a spaghetti dish, with a dish full of spaghetti with arabiata sauce and topped with loads of cheese. This dish was tasty too!
However, the hookah was not good, or maybe it was their bad day! Choked the entire time!
Overall, a must visit and strongly recommended for everyone!

Amazing amazing food..
Loved the Mexican rice & Chinese bhel, the eighty 8 special drink 'Chak de India' was simply too gud and refreshing.
The hukka needs a work.. Wasnt dat all impressive.. I guess dey are using an inferior coal.. Bt overall experience was too gud. Soft spoken owners is always a delight. Keep up the good work guys!! 👍👍

Located just beside the PC Chandra showroom Opposite Elgin Road 
Went here last night with a groupon coupon and that was the first  mistake which i made
The first of all said that the deal had a stater in it but it was clearly writtern on the deal that i had a main course in it
Finally i got it honored after explaining them for 5-7 minutes 
I ordered Mongolian noodles as a main course but it was more like a street food kind of noodle even worse 
Leaving everything left the place within 15 minutes
Please if you need your money's worth never ever go to this place
This is my first review on zomato as i found if too relevant to post about this one 
Thanks readers
Gave 1.5 for the staff who served us

3.5 star rating..just for food...food was really amazing here..we tried cheese corn balls..if you are a cheese lover thn it is a must try for you..loved that flowing cheese..mix sauce pasta was real gem..we literally craved for more n more...noodles were also great..so was the drinks..KitKat shake was very basic but virgin mojito n strawberry shake was really very refreshing. Nothing else were noticeable other thn food..very basic ambiance..n very loud music..we requested to low down the volume but they were not concerned..service was below par...we dint get forks for 10 minutes after the pasta was served..had to ask thrice..its very dark in there..but they obliged this request of ours and we got some light. If you are fine with loud music thn this place is a must try.

Another addition of hukkah parlour in Elgin road area.
Out of my passion to discover new food outlets and something different environment, entered into this cafe just beside the famous P.C chndra elgin showroom near Rabindra sadan metro station. They have decorated the underground of HDFC Bank beautifully.

* Ambience : As you enter into the cafe 1st thing will strike your sense that it is too dark to take even a photograph atleast. It took some times to cope up with that darkness after sitting on their large and comfortable sofas, common in all hookah parlours. Music was rocking throughout the evening,good collection of albums, but I have only one complain about this maximum darkness. You cant even see what you are consuming actually. There are numerous dim litted hukkah parlour, its some how extra dark 🌙🌙🌙 that I didn't like at all. Except this, ambience was electrifying... I liked it. So I would have rated them 10 on 10, but for darkness its 6 on 10.
But one thing for sure. The couples who enjoy bit of romancing in darkness, this is the perfect outlet for them. 🍴🍴🍴

* Foods : I ordered 1. Brain freezer hookah with ice base and the blend and taste was awesome. I have tasted this particular flavour in many hookah parlour, but to me, this was one of the best in mixing the masalas. So for hookah 10 on 10. 👍👍👍

2. Cheese Corn Ball at its best. Beautiful, amazingly tasted ; smooth,crispy,full of cheese 7 corn balls. I liked it so very much. Rating 10 on 10 and highly recommended. 👍👍👍

3. The crushers nay it be green apple or litchi flavour or blue lagoon or anything, very good. I especially prefer taking tea or coffee with hookah. This day was an exception.
I ordered Litchi and green apple crushers. Liked it so very much. Rating 10 on 10. 👌👌👌

* Management : Staffs are somehow new may be, so they were getting confused sometimes to arrange the sofas for the guestes at rush hours. But they are very cordial, friendly and well behaved. Rating 7 on 10. ✌

*** I must mention one thing lastly. Just opposite of this cafe there are loads of famous hookah bars as Chai break, bikers cafe etc. Yet, they are giving them a smart competition and running this cafe successfully with their good and quality food and hookahs. So for their this brave spirit, they deserve 10 on 10. 👏👏👏 @priyabrata ganguly

Location : Near PC Chandra Jewellers showroom, Rabindra Sadan  metro station.

And the quest to conquer the Kolkatan cafes continues…
Our never ending pursuit to try out every café/hookah lounge in the city reached yet another landmark, Eighty8+ Kafe, the newest edition in its category. This new kid on the block is located right on the hot strip of Chowringhee Road which is already host to most top of the league restaurants and cafes of town.
Coming to the outlet, it has a trivial floor area with a seating space for around 30 souls. The place was too dark for my liking but it was nicely complimented by the neon strips on the walls. The music wasn’t too loud (thank god) and selection of tracks was peppy. The décor is pretty much alright, nothing astounding.

The food in every manner was nothing short of quality.
★    Cheese Corn Ball : The very first item on their menu and it deserves the spot. Adequate crispness on the outer layer with molten cheese and corns on the inside, a classic combination. It happens rarely when you like something to the point of ordering it twice.

★    Tour De Pasta : Had the penne pasta instead of spaghetti. Yet again excellent taste and texture. Fresh veggies and really authentic cream cheese sauce. Served with garlic breads.

★    Crushers : Green Apple and Blue Island were only nice. Litchi was amazing though, really suiting the definition of a proper crusher.

★    Hookah : Brain Freezer Salsa Mint was wonderful. Kala Khatta wasn’t as good as expected but still manageable. The preparation was commendable, to see such good smoke out of a normal base.

The service was really fine. The staff was courteous and obliging. We didn’t have to wait too long for our order. The place has a completely relaxed and chilled out vibe. Definitely worth repetitive visits.
