It's basically a food court... You can get decent nos of options from North Indian, Chinese n Italian... I tried their non veg pizza n soft drinks combo... The quantity of the pizza was filling... But need lot of improvement in quality... Nothing to mention about the ambiance n decor... Service is bit slow... Pocket pinch is high... Another thing that need to be mentioned that... Please keep the AC working as because you are charging some tax wala thing for it...

This is located at the top floor of Big Bazaar, Sealdah. A variety of cuisines available here. The price is reasonable, and the quantity of food yields value. The service is really good. The staff are very polite and service time is really small. Overall a good experience.

Basically it's the food court inside Sealdah bigbazaar where you would sit and eat after shopping. I wont complain about the food, but its way below "okay" level when it comes to taste. Went with few cousins and ordered biriyani, pizza and cakes. Cakes were good, biriyani okayish but the pizza was sooooooo thin that we thought it needed feeding more then we did... (~_~")

This is located inside Big Bazaar, Sealdah.

Ambience is nice & clean.

Sitting arrangenents available.

Service is fine.

Tried plain dosa & Samosa chaat. Both were nice but still nothing to rave about. 

Pocket pinch is reasonable 

If one is hungry while shopping at Big Bazaar, one can come here to satiate hunger pangs.

Food is so-so, for a really super variety and large number of customers food is fairly good for a quick fill in between shopping. Try run-of-the-mill foods. Hygeinicaly well maintained and catered.
Try anything that's easy on tastebuds and easily made.
I have also seen buffet at very cheap rate. Never tasted it, nor I want you to taste. Please, stick to fast-food regime.

Situated in 4th floor of Big bazar sealdah near sealdah station and sealdah court. It was a good court which serves multiple cuisines. Beautifully designed and with proper sitting arrangement. Ambience was really good and so as hospitality. Service in reasonable time and presentation was good. Price was reasonable. I tried their lassi which was refreshing and tastes really good and I have their masala dosa which was made really good and tastes heavenly delicious. A must try place. Established in big bazar so after shopping it was the ideal place for dine in. Recommended to all.

Decent food option at Sealdah. Momos were very good. On various visits we had masala dosa, chicken roll etc. Good place to rest your feet after shopping at Big Bazaar or before catching a train.

Being a biriyani fanatic, whenever I visit home,  biriyani seems to become my staple diet. After roaming the city, I thought to quench my craving for biriyani here. The aroma is quite less than what I expected but the taste seems eatable. As my taste buds can easily differentiate the tastes of biriyani, the rice seems a bit overcooked but the chicken looked tender though. The chutneys are delicious but a bit more quantity would be better.

I don't know why this place has got such a low rating . But this is one food court which has never let my expectations down. I think people need to choose a bit wisely from the menu. Their Chinese dishes and dosa are really good. The price is reasonable too. The desserts they serve is not that great though. But it's way better than many other food courts in the city.

I have just been here once with a friend.  Although there is a lot of items on the menu not all of them are available all the time and given the fact that we were not terribly hungry we opted for Butter masala Dosa which seemed a safe choice. The first look of the dosa may scare you away owing to its size but it's paper thin and very light. It comes with the usual filling of aloo along with sambhar and 2 chutneys - the usual white chutney and another one which is exactly like tomato ketchup and tastes a bit weird with the dosa. Quality is okayish and so is pricing. The quantity of food provided is enough for one person. However the beverages are overpriced and comes in half filled glasses which is really annoying. You can give this place a try once after a shopping spree at Big Bazaar as this place at least ticks off the hygiene quotient which is a big issue in sealdah area.

Food Stop at Big Bazar's 4th Floor serves from South Indian to few Chinese dishes. The foods are quite over priced for the quality they serve. The quantity is also very less 1 Fried rice hardly serve one person.
The South Indian dishes are satisfactory but again they are also over priced. I had the Masala Dhosa for Rs.85 which didn't seem that worthy.
If you are too hungry at Big Bazar oy then visit this place.

Situated on the top floor of sealdah big bazar. This place is always crowded. I have tasted their masala dosa,chats and few combos.. The big dosa is served with 3types of chutneys.tastes good ..so as the chats.. The Chinese combo has 3items..but it seemed to be lacking flavours. The quantity of the food is not satisfying compared to the price they charge. So now I generally order a dosa..and its enough for one person.

We generally order the combo offers.. I really like it.. But I have tried momo and mouse too.. Don't try to order mouse there.. it will be simply wastage of money.. but the combo offers both Chinese and biriyani combos are good..

A decent food court in the area. Have come here just once with a friend. I had ordered Papri Chaat and my friend a Chicken burger. The burger was not fresh at all. The patty wasn't fresh at all. But the Papri Chaat was really good. Cold, refreshing, chatpata and yummy. A nice place for food trial if you come for shopping at the Big Bazaar.

What can I say went with my cousin , who knew my cousin is so hilarious , she went for Mutton Biryani and Onion Uttapam made me eat it too. Mutton Biryani quantity wise was pretty good it was not oily , which i really liked but Onion Uttapam was not so good tasted stale plus obviously it doesn't go with Mutton Biryani.
Overall an average experience.

This place is situated at the 4th floor of Sealdah Big bazar. After shopping decided to try the newly opened food court but highly disappointed with the quality of the food. I have ordered Chinese non-veg combo including veg noodles, chicken manchurian and soft drink from Chowpatty. Chicken item was too bad to taste. The noodles tasted terribly pathetic. I would never like to try any more.

This place is at a stone's throw distance from my hostel.. So I visited this place for innumerable times.. Whenever I have nowhere to go, I visit this place.. I tried all the menus on their list.. The main problem here is the quality is not maintained.. One day u may find a dish tastes awesome.. The very next day it may disappoint u.. But I can suggest u some dishes which I hope u ll like.. Biriyani combos, sizzlers, south Indian foods, Indian thalis. U may try tandooris too.. Sandwich and pizzas are bad.. Though previously available grilled sandwiches were good(least likely u ll get them now. Mostly unavailable in recent days) The waiters r sometimes rude ,may b due to the pressure of huge number of orders.. Except sizzlers and tandoori items all deliveries are quick..

Was at Big Bazaar Sealdah today with my mother, for some shopping. It was my first visit to this branch of Big Bazaar, and I liked the food court situated on the top-most floor of this place. Since we had already had lunch, we decided to try some light snacks, and found plenty of options there. We ordered for a plate of Dhokla, which was priced at a reasonable Rs. 60. The quantity was good, and the place was very lively, and seemed like a good hang-out zone, primarily for college-goers. Found a lot of variety in terms of food, here. For instance, they had snacks, a fried chicken outlet, Chinese, Indian, desserts (ice-cream etc.), and shakes/ juices, and they were all pretty reasonably priced.

At SEALDAH area it has good variety and spread...really wide range of choice...Chinese,North Indian, South Indian and even chats and ice cream!

I have had South Indian few times before hand and it was good ...Today Ordered for Chelo kabab... To be very frank my expectations were very low ...  And I was pleasantly surprised.. It was pretty good  when compared to food court standards... Over all nice place for hungry stomachs !

Too hungry n tired of shopping we went to the topmost level of big bazaar. Thought the food would be bad but since we were hungry we planned to ordered. Ordered for a fish butter fry. It was good. But definitely felt it was over prized. Then suddenly we decided to have a papri chat. Worth it. Awesome did it taste. But the best deal was the awesome awesome non veg chinese combo. I think the best combo in kolkata atleast in a food court. Easily serves two hungry people. The combo had a pineapple drink, a mango ice cream,  spring roll,kimchi, chicken manchurian n fried rice. I think if u r hungry definitely the best ever choice to meet ur hunger. Will go back for this definitely m will try to taste its angry dragon sizzler. Am surely coming back.

it is situated on the top floor of the Sealdah Big bazaar. I have never experienced such a bad food-court.We hit it on a emergency basis and ordered chicken makhani,steam rice and kashimiri aloor dum.quantity was ok but quality was very bad,not tasty at all.the service was also bad,the waiters were not helping at all. over all very bad tasted food in comparison to price ,it will be wise if you avoid this.
