Not sure what some these other reviewers were tripping on. You don't go to a small place like this expecting a full course meal. You go there to enjoy the things most similar shops are famous for. THE KEBABS. And god, they're delicious. Been eating kebabs almost everywhere in Kolkata and this is definitely among the top few. Preferably go during the weekday if you want better service, but the food is great on weekends too. And don't plan on eating in there. The ambience isn't that good because it's primary customers get a takeaway. Any one with a little business management skills knows that it is not worth spending on something you are not focusing on, which is what most reviewers don't understand. They just want the best of everything ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
Try any of the chicken and fish kebabs. I have not tried the others yet so I can't say, but any fish or chicken kebab is really good. My favorite was the Fish pepper salt and chicken malai kebab

Ordered through Swiggy for the first time despite it's reviews being a bit low. The Pork Smoked Sausage turned out to be okayish. The sausage was tossed well in sauce and the taste was good, therefore. But it was hard to chew. Nevertheless, recommended.

Not a very good experience. Ambiance is not that good , very clumsy . Service is also delayed and not very well behaved. Serves cold food and at times stale food too.

The owners need to redo the recipes. Ordered a simple Paneer Butter Masala. What was delivered was some bland white gravy with pieces of raw Paneer. Moreover the dish was stone cold. seemed like a leftover dish. I can cook better Paneer Butter Masala. My request is please go through the recipes. Just opening a restaurant and hiring some untrained cooks does not make you a restaurateur. Best of luck on your restaurant.

DONT EVER VISIT:

This is the most resturent I ever visited.we go their with some of my friends,at that night they have no items exempt beriyani and kababs..we take those.
Chicken tikka is good.
But the best part is their beriyani.its a disaster. Its no taste at all and smell nasty..
WHER WE TRYING TO SAY THISE TO THEIR MANAGER.MANAGER IS TEMPERING US AND SAYS 'ALL RESTURENTS ARE NOT SAME ' AND PATEND LIKE AMINIA.MANAGER IS TALKING LIKE A CHIP ROAD SIDE SHOP owner..
We cont eat the beriyani..

Order over my ph 9831031245 on 10.10.16 at 19:30, suppose to be delivered at 21:30 and when went there to take delivery they squarely refused me about the order. Eventually, returned with empty handed. Unreliable, breach of trust.
