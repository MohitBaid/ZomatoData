What to say about this place! Just amazing!! The variety of cakes be it the fruit cake, plum cakes or just plain butter cakes!! Just love this place. Try their Chicken Pie and Chicken Tikka Sub. They are equally amazing!

Though it's a small outlet but if you've no issues with the space & only want to concentrate on food then it's a heaven for the foodies...

Regular go to place for bread , donuts or pastry or say burger. 
Burger - They make it live infront of you,and it's so fresh comes very cheap just at rs65. Amazing in taste.
Muffin - my favourite is chocolate muffin and blueberry muffin. So soft and yummy! Comes just at 30-45 rs
Pastry - fresh and cheap, comes 45rs. My favourite is age old black forest and coffee caramel. 
Donuts - a pack of donuts comes at just rs 40 and it's amazing!

This is what happened today. I visited the plce a bit hungry. Upon looking at their food displays, I noticed that most of the showcase was empty. Only about 2 or 3 dishes were available. I ordered a cheese sandwich which, I kid you not, the filling of was made in the microwave. It took 15 mins to grill 1 sandwich when the place was empty.

The bill was 45 and I handed in a 500 rupee note. The owner responded at me like a child, saying he didn't have change. I didn't either and I even showed him my wallet. The owner grabbed my sandwich like a greasy thug and I just left, not wanting to start a scene.

This place is inhospitable with employees that don't want to help you. Please avoid.

I did not like fresh bake. Whilst the chocolate pastries are OK, they do not excel or offer anything which is available elsewhere. The biggest disappointment however are the patties. The veg puff hardly had any filling, and I really felt like it should be removed from the menu. Seems like the management is trying to get more out of less. But sadly, their strategy fell flat. I would recommend one try cookie jar or cakes instead of fresh bake.

There used to be a 'Monginis' 6-7 years down the line(or more). A Monginis near the residence is like a savior from time to time. Was heartbroken when the shop was shut down specially because it actually had a great deal of business running at a location like Kankurgachi. Discovering this eatery just in the same location which is an upgration of the previously existing bakery(obviously), after years brought to me some immense pleasure. It's my random go-to-place. The only drawback is that they don't offer a seating arrangement. But as a bakery it stands out in this location. You should try their Crispy Chicken Burger, Chicken Pie and of course the cakes and it won't burn a hole in your pocket!

Lovely bakery. Mordern feel. The vegetarian section of snacks and desserts have great variety and priced accordingly. The caramel pastry and choco lava cake are to die for. True to its name they serve fresh and top quality products. And have a live counter on the top floor. I am a regular customer who drops in on Sundays to grab a bite and take some for family.

Located right on the Kankurgachi crossing, this confectionery flashes a LIVE BAKERY sign. Both non veg n veg cakes and pastries are available. They even sell pizza breads and cookies. Nowadays, they have even started serving mocktails and smoothies as well. Price is very very reasonable. And the taste is awesome. From the pastries to the bread items to the packed cookies to the smoothies, they really put effort in making their products the best. Cash and card are accepted and printed bill is given for every order. I am a regular at this place & absolutely recommend this place.

Well this joint is conveniently located and it was my 1st time out here...i took the pineapple pastry..the caramel pastry and chocochip cranberry muffin as i wanted to try different flavours...well the caramel pastry was little below my expectations..the taste was nt so striking and seemed like any other ordinary pastry...the pineapple pastry was awsome..the pastry was soft and the pineapple slices mixed with the cream imparted a great taste to it...the muffin was the best of the three...the chocochip and cranberry flavours together came off perfectly and the consistency of the muffin was just about right to make it a treat to the tastebuds...there is an array of choices in both the pastry and snacks section..this place is a must visit if u are nearby and hungry for some snacks...

The name itself says everything is baked fresh and indeed it is. Visited the place quite a few times now. Have tried variety of pastries and muffins, everything is just yummylicious. Rates are reasonable. It's a small outlet so there is no sitting arrangement otherwise it's a good place.keep it on.

I have decreased it's rating to 2 as the owner of the store is very rude and arrogant. He have no manners to talk to a customer what so ever. Very disappointing.

It's been a long time since Kolkata needed some quality bakeries. Finally some citizens have paid heed to the call and now we have a few catering us. Fresh Bake is one such nascent bakery which rises to the occasion. The savouries are delectable, the chicken quiche heavenly. The pastries are good too though I have had better in several other bakeries. The behaviour of the staff on the hand reminds you of Parisian waiters. Pity, one can only expect so much.

There's always an extra space in my belly for a dessert and Fresh Bake is the new source.It is located in Kankurgachi Crossing towards Manicktala. Visited this place today in the afternoon to have some yummy desserts.I have tried their Caramel Fresh Cream Pastry,it's wonderful and toothsome.You just can't give it a miss.If you are a chocolate lover,try their Fudge Pastry,it's equally awesome and tasty. Choco Lava cake is also recommended.The place is small,you will have to enjoy it by standing,otherwise you can take the parcel,but I love this place a lot and would love to visit again.

Fresh baked the name itself suggest that the items which are available are fresh. They have live bakery upstairs. Whenever​ I am around kankurgachi I feel to visit this place.
I had tried their pastries all are good and totally fresh. The pastries melts in your mouth and gives a heavenly feeling. Caramel pastry, choco lava, pineapple pastry and the dark chocolate pastries all are delicious, neither too sweet nor that creamy. Their chicken pie also yummy and fresh. They have both veg and non-veg cakes with lot of varieties. Easy on pocket as well.
Their AC doesn't work properly. Seating area is not available.
Love to visit again and again.

Well it's birthday time and my fiance wants to gift me the best designer cake. So after searching Google for the best designs she finally comes up to this place in kankurgachi. This bakery prepares fresh cakes on order that is 40 mins before pick up time. SK be it a pastry a burger or a cake you wait for 40 mins and you get your final order delivered as requested. So for me a kiktkat designer cake ws ordered.the taste of  the cake was perfect, soft Belgium chocolate cake. Now while placing the order over the phone this people are very courteous but over the counter they are the rudest staff, they kept my fiance waiting for an hour. The A/C also doesn't work in the bakery. The price of the cake might increase during delivery so be aware. Well the cake was delivered on time fortunately. Along with the cake she ordered a Chicken Cheese Burger which was a resemble of KFC with perfect Cheese content , but couldn't beat KFC standards but at 65 RS a piece was perfect. A Chicken Puff which was nice enough and a Coffee truffle cake which was just fine. So if you are looking for fresh baked cakes this is the place to be.

I was going to rate this place a sure 4 as their cake tastes amazing, but then the servicing they offered us last night ruined it all. We had ordered for a bachelorette theme based cake for a colleague's party which was scheduled to be delivered at 5 pm. When we reached the place at 6, still they were not finished with the cake which is quite unprofessional and unexpected as well. None the less their cake tasted amazing with a layer of strawberry cream on a chocolate based cake, they do need to improve on their order delivery skills on time.

I love cakes and pastries. 😊 Pastries have an endless supply of constantly growing flavour options. It simply makes you happy and chocolate is a delicious cure for a bad day. The best part about Fresh bake is that they have varieties in veg cakes which is equally tasty like any other cake shop. They keep varied range of snack option too out of which garlic breads are my favourite.

I was there with my friends on 12th Jan'17 and ordered 4 pineapple pastries ( only 4 left at that time) but I was surprised to see that the service guy just packed those for another customer who ordered the same but after we placed our's. When I enquired about it... the guy (Raju) refused to answer.

Loved there chocochip muffin and bluberry muffin. These are little big in portions than the usual muffins with quite reasonable prices. The walnut date cake was also very good and soft.
I would have rated it a 4/5 bt the extra .5 is for the Choco lava cake. For Choco lava fans, this place offers this very delicious joy in mouth cake in less than half the price as offered by Domino's. 
Will surely visit again.

Good looking outlet from the outside. The staff are well dressed, and the pastries look delicious. But something happened today, something I won't ever forget. I asked the staff if I could take some photos for my review, and the guy at the cash counter said "We already have photos in Zomato, I can't allow you to take any pictures." I was actually very disappointed about this, I have never been stopped for photographing products, but this is my first time. Though the pastries were good, the rating goes down due to this. I would rather take it as an insult. I don't think I'll be visiting again anytime in the future.

I've been going to frash bake for several months now, and I must say that they have kept up with my expectations of consistent quality. The eatables are decent and moderately priced with enough variety for a small shop (they serve cold drinks!), but it's their cakes that really steal the show. Fluffy and creamy pastries and cakes make for an unforgettable cake experience from this store. If only they had space for a sitting area.

Must try: all the pastries, chocolate brownie, chicken tikka pizza, veg grill sandwich
Brownie points: tissues and ketchup satchets on demand

Food: 4/5 for sandwiches and puffs, 4.5/5 for pastries and cake
Ambience: 3.5/5
Service and efficiency: 4/5

Such an awesome pastries and cake shop I personally experienced after kookie jar and krazzy for choclates.
They serve mesmerising pastries I must say fluffy and creamy if you are a pastry lover you should try it once.
They also serve some good snacks I had their chicken sub its creamy and tasty.
And if you want a birthday cake in 2-3hrs they will make it for you like their name fresh bake..

While waiting for a friend at kankurgachhi I just strolled into this place.
A small bakery which well 'bakes to differ ' indeed.
The pastries are great.... all of them....with no exception whatsoever.
The cheesecake is brilliant.... the dark cherry filled muffin is a stunner.
The crispy chicken burger and grilled chicken sandwich are both good enough.
Low priced, good confectionery products are assured.
But the star is the cheese vadapav.....
The only con is that they don't have a sitting area!

Love the service, the range and the fact that each time I visit the bakery, there is something new. The display and the concept is all in place but the taste is inconsistent. The baked cheesecake (I am obsessed with them and think Moshe's in Mumbai makes some of the best bakes Philly Cheesecakes) looked yum but was too sweet. In fact most of their pastries are too sweet. And that's a bummer. Except the new addition- dark chocolate pastries that look exactly like a choco-bar ice cream. Well done guys and hope you get the sweetness right for the rest of your pastries too. In fact, you do seem to get it right with the muffins. But the cream -based pastries just don;t hit the spot.

Been here so many times and never disappointed even once. I would say the best in the locality. From the bada pav to chicken corn sub everything tastes just too good. Even the breads available here are good quality and at reasonable price.

A sure recommendation to anyone reading this review. 

The only drawback this place has is its lack of design variety in cakes.

One of my fell in love food joint. From the food items to the service- both are amazing. Had my best of all Chicken burger and Chicken pie, you have to wait a bit to get the fresh food. And voila, get the crunchiest burger here. As well as took home cheese garlic bread, ate it after 2-3 days storing it in fridge. It was fresh as it is. The dessert here- my favourite is Chocolate Brownie. 
Please keep up your good work and good servings. And also tried the Chocolate Blueberry Muffin- Yummiest.

The disjointed culinary scenery has recently received a massive upheaval. Plenty of these newer stand alone shops have opened up, and Fresh Bake is one shop that adds great value. This particular area has always lacked a good confectionery, and now truth be told, it has one. 

Fresh Bake is good enough to receive a 4.5, simply because of their savouries. They combine good pricing with great savouries and is often my personal choice for a 6pm meal.

The one problem that I faced was with their pastries. They look very nice and everything, but they've probably got a little too much gelatin. The rest are overly sweet, and I'm not talking about all of the cream crafted goodies available at this joint. 

The management seems to be polite enough, but not commendably good. The shop smells really good, but that's to be expected of a patisserie. Going to definitely come back for more.

Ambience/Interior: 3.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Food: 3.5/5
Value for Money: 3.5/5

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

I had previously given good rating to this place but recently I have noticed that the behaviour of the staff is way too unprofessional . Today I bought chicken till sub and choco lava cake and asked them to pack it after heating both since I wanted to consume them on my way . To my utter dismay they had heated none of the products as I opened them immediately after getting into my car after buying it. Also, I asked multiple times to give spoon with the choco lava cake. You need a spoon to have a choco lave cake and you also need the cake to be warm.  The food quality is fine as usual but if the staff is this unprofessional then it's extremely disappointing.

Oh my, this place. I visit like once a week. And I never get bored or find stuff tasteless. I've apparently tasted everything on their menu. Given the fact that I go there very frequently, and believe me, every single item is worth every penny. The burgers are my favourite specially the crispy chicken ones. I have found just one problem at the place,  their card swiper works once after 15 tries. But again, nice staff great prices and fresh and fantastic food.

Yes! They "bake to differ"! Very impressed with the fast service. 
Just day before yesterday me and a friend of mine dropped in to Fresh Bake to get a Dark Chocolate cake and a Red Velvet Cake for the upcoming birthday of a common friend of ours on the next day. Our desired cakes were ordered, and the people asked us to wait for 15-20 minutes till the cake was made live and ready for delivery. While waiting, I was somewhat hungry, so I tried their Chicken Quische which comes for 30 bucks. It was good. They sell cold drinks within as well, I took a glass of Coke as usual. 
The cakes were given to us sooner than 20 minutes, the fast service impressed me! 
And yes, the cakes were great! Soft, chocolaty and yummy!! So took me to the mood of cakes and choclates! I would prefer to order cakes from them in the future. 😊

Their tag line is 'We bake to differ ', Well,indeed they do! This bakery is located at kakurgachi mor,very easy to locate.
I am a frequent visitor of this place. All the items they serve are worthy to drool over. They always serve fresh food. I've tried many items from their menu. To mention some of it-
1.Crispy chicken burger - it's one of my favorite items here. you'll get a huge quantity of Crispy fried chicken that will surely satisfied your taste buds.Must try it.
2. Chicken tikka sub- 3-4 pieces of yummy chicken tikkas dripped in a tangy sauce and mayo. The bread they use for the sub is very soft and fresh. Another must try.
3. Cheese corn sub - Must try for the veggie lovers. This spicy sub will surely still your heart.
4. All the pastries and muffins are 'oh so good' . The cream they use is light and fluffy,not that sticky type.
They also serve various cookies,bread items. Whoever I recommend this place to are in love with it. You won't be disappointed too. So give it a try. 😃

Their tagline, though a bit tacky, says it all -  "We bake to differ".

Well, they sure do because they are not just riding the fondant wave or drooling over the oh-so-cute ombre icing. Instead they are baking good cakes. Period. 

I have ordered their strawberry gateaux, mix fruit gateaux, and the very awesome butterscotch cappuccino birthday cake and never been disappointed. As a matter of fact all of my friends who tasted the cappuccino cake became die-hard fans of the fresh-bake brand. 

They also make some fabulous muffins, short-breads, sponge cakes, fruit cakes, ginger-breads, cookies and breads. They have a tie-up with mrs magpie so people up north can now easily get their hands on beautiful ginger-breads and cookies. I am a regular buyer of their mixed fruit and cashew cookies. 

The mezzanine floor is the bakery so what they bake is always fresh. The beautiful aroma wafts into the store while you order. The savoury section is good too plus they assemble fresh burgers and sandwiches within minutes. Service is quick and neat, packaging is awesome and pricing very reasonable. One cannot be complaining!

As the name says, all the items are "fresh" which is the USP of the place according to me.. It offers almost all the baking items.. Walnut brownie and truffle pastries are simply yummy.. It also have live counters for burgers and pizza... For vegetarian friends, they have eggless pastries and cakes too.. It is also light on the pocket. Dessert lovers shouldn't miss this place. 
Recommended item- caramel and truffle pastries, brownies, puffed corns, coconut cookies.

Very easy to locate and definitely a place which will make you come back again and again. My order consisted of the following: 
SAVOURIES:
Vegetable Grilled Sandwich: Favourite!❤❤
Chilly Cheese Toast: Way too spicy for my taste buds.
Cheese Corn Sub: Not so good.

PASTRY:
Black Forest : scope for improvement.
White Forest : Amazing!👌👌
Chocolate Brownie : The texture was superb but it was a little dark.
Caramel Fresh Cream: Just okayish.
Coffee Chocolate: perfect taste, just the way I like it.

MUFFINS:
Choco chips cranberry: It was soft and fresh with perfect amalgamation of choco-chips and cranberry. The seeds were little annoying though.

As I said earlier, you are bound to come back again.😊☺

Went in there Nd for the first 5 mins I was looking looking Nd looking at all the products Nd was at a fix for which one to order..
Heard a lot abt the crispy chicken burger so went for that first and I was not let down as because it was quite fantastic at that price..
Secondly I ordered a black forest cake which was equally mouth watering.. 

All over the food was quiet good.. Staff behavior was good.. Lots of variety..
Most importantly Dre are a lot of options for veg als.. :)

This outlet has recently opened in place of the erstwhile Monginis @ Kankurgachi, and much better than it. I visited this place yesterday for the 1st time and discovered the wide variety of items – savouries (Veg and Non veg) and cakes (Egg and Eggless) on offer. It is quite remarkable to see that they have placed the veg and non veg items in separate counters to ensure no mix happens. 

This bakery is quite conveniently located at the posh Kankurgachi main road – which might yield significant results for this outlet. There were 5-7 other customers at the time I entered, which speaks of the popularity of this place. Size of the outlet is not small, but it cannot accommodate dine-in facilities and is more of a takeaway outlet. I bought their chocolate pastry (eggless), dark chocolate wedge pastry (eggless), cheese corn puff and vegetable patty burger for takeaway and consumed these stuff the next morning after immediate refrigeration. 

I was grossly disappointed at the dark chocolate wedge pastry (eggless) as it was bitter and stale. A great pastry was denied good brownie points – just because, it was served to me post expiry. Chocolate pastry (eggless) was however nice. Burger, again, was so-so but the cheese corn puff was the pick of the items. Just too soft – with decent corn stuffing!

Service and ambience are nice, staff is very polite and prices are reasonable – all the above items costing me just Rs. 160/-

PS:- I request the management to always serve fresh items only to their customers if they want to sustain long term relations

Few days back while having a gala time with my friends suddenly we developed a craving for desserts and as this place was nearby we decided to give this place a try. It is very conveniently located and one can easily locate it if they are in kakurgachi crossing. The place is small and my friend was disappointed as she was expecting a place where we could have sat down to enjoy our desserts. Nevertheless we quickly ordered the following pastries: pineapple , caramel, dark chocolate and coffee. We ordered chocolate muffins, chocolate and cranberry muffin. In cookies we took chocolate fudge. In savouries we tried the chicken pie puff and chicken puff. As there was no place to sit we had to pack it and come back to my friend's place to eat it. Point to be noted that their packaging was excellent.

The pineapple pastry was quite refreshing and we enjoyed it. The caramel pastry was good but not something unique also the coffee pastry was very good with a mild coffee flavour but personally I would have preferred it if it had a much more stronger punch of the coffee flavour. The best was the dark chocolate one as it was absolutely perfect with less cream in it just the way I like it. The pastries were very moderately charged around rs 35 (if am not wrong)

The muffins were very fresh and lovely in taste although the cranberry muffin had little seeds in it which was a bit irritating. These were priced at rs. 45. The cookie pack was priced at rs. 80 and was good in taste. 

Now comes the best part which was their savoury items which were absolutely wonderful in taste. The pie was big in size and so crispy and flaky(delicious) that I couldn't stop gorging on it and it was priced at rs 50. The chicken puff was equally good crispy from outside soft on the inside with a good portion size priced at rs. 30.

The best part of this place was that all the items are super fresh and priced moderately.
P.S : I loved the chicken pie and puff so much that I went the very next day to try it again.

I think it would be fair to say that I was one of the earliest customers to this fairly new shop, situated at the kakurgachi crossing  (a really convenient location by the way). And from the first visit onwards, I have been a huge fan of their stuff. Whether it be the sub sandwiches, of the desserts (options present for all items in veg n nonveg as well), I have loved their food. The chicken sub and the white forest are my favorites here actually. Although they don't offer seating arrangements, but the pocket friendly prices of all items make up for everything. Will definitely recommend to everyone.

A swish bakery outlet and dessert parlour in Kankurgachi with a tagline that claims: "We bake to differ." Sure enough, they do. They sell awesomely fresh and tantalising cookies, cakes, muffins, loaves and slices of crusty breads like baguettes, cheese garlic breads, multigrain or whole wheat breads, brown breads, burger breads, pizza bases etc., eggless pastries, gateaus, packaged snacks such as breadsticks and cheese straw, mouthwatering savouries like chicken BBQ sub, chicken singara, vada pao, veg. continental pie, puff, samosa, spring roll, patty burger to name a few, and also stock up on delectable confections from Mrs. Magpie like assorted cookies, biscotti, choco chip cookies etc. Recently had their chocolate panna cotta and butter muffin, along with chicken pie puff. All three food items were lip-smacking to gorge on. With tasty and fresh-looking baked goodies stacked neatly on shelves, this bakery offers confectionary made with attractive, decorative icing that are appealing to look at as well as innovative. A must visit for people with a fondness for bakery products, desserts and savories.

It's on the kankurgachi crossing. Experience was just awsome. Quite reasonable price. Better than mio amor or sugar&spice. Variety is good and so as the taste. I already have tried most of the items. Each item is quite good and yummy. The main part is you can get all the items fresh as they preparing all the items upstairs. I love the pizza and sandwiches there and in cakes all are good specially choco moose.

a new opening @ kankurgachi. located just opposite to bhikharam sweets/tewari sweets. this place *actualy* lives upto its name called "Fresh Bake". it was my 1st visit, so I wanted to try all their flavours, so I gifted a whole pack of   6 diff flavour pastries from there which included flavours like - dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, strawberry, white forest & fresh fruit. I even gifted a whole box of oatmeal raisin cookies along with the pastries and it all costed me only 365/- , which is extremely affordable. all the pastries along with the cookies were large in size, so there was no compromise in size and even in the quality of the pastries coz they all were supa yumm ans delicious. it was loved by everyone. i was extremely satisfied with this particular place. a must visit for everyone who needs an affordable yumm sweetooth treat :)

I ordered a caramel birthday cake for my best friend and it tastes heaven.. It has no too much sweet.. Completely balanced flavour. Very soft cake.. It melts in the mouth.

Location : Located at the kankurgachi crossing, just opposite to bhikaram chandmal. Previously there was monginis shop here

Decor : From outside the store, its hoarding are flashy enough to attract people. Also one can see a level above the shop where foods are cooked. Inside the shop, there is a proper division for veg / non veg snacks and for eggless / with egg pasties cakes.

Staff : Staffs are friendly and happy to help you.

Food ordered : 
Caramel pastry
Pineapple pastry
Black forest
Chocolate brownies
Eggless chocolate muffins
Vegetable continental pie

Description : Fresh bake is a small joint at kankurgachi crossing. I regularly cross it on my was to office. Finally got a chance to try it. Firstly, they advertise it as live bakery. To me live bakery means cakes or patties are made live in front of us. But that's not the case, it is either already prepared or they make it fresh on order at the kitchen which is just above store. So not totally convinced with live bakery advertisement but ya they serve fresh.
Caramel pastry has caramel on top of the pastry, with coffee flavour in the sponge. Loved it. Must try.
Pineapple pastry n black forest were average.
Chocolate brownie & chocolate muffins were very good.
Vegetable continental pie is top notch. Must try. 
Overall a nice bakery. Don't be misguided by the word live bakery. Liked the division of veg/ non veg foods, I being a pure vegetarian. Recommended.

A new addition in kankurgachi. Fresh bake serves some good quality food items, be it cakes, breads, puffs, pastries or sandwiches. Highly recommended.

Fresh Bakery....as says the name....everything is fresh and made in front if you or above you. Vada pao, not the regular, in this you get cripy vegetable patty, even have option for cheesy.
Patty Puff are crispy & full of vegetables inside, made me remembered my canteen days.... Pastry are soft & fresh. They even have Mrs. Magpie's cookies which are additional bonus to the store... with all these they even keep muffies & Garlic bread too....  Good bakery to get your regular stuff.....will go long way, if only they keep the service quick, & hygiene maintained.

Fresh Bake is a great new addition to an area otherwise starved of a good bakery. The biggest plus point is that they bake the items right above the shop so freshness is guaranteed. They have a good variety of cakes , gateaux , cookies and savories including puffs , pies , sandwiches , pizzas, spring-roll etc. My personal favorites are the Chicken Pie and Crispy Chicken Burger both of which are not only super yummy but also great value for money not to forget hot and fresh. The Muffins are also great to pack for home and snack on later. I now make it a point to drop in if I am in the vicinity.
