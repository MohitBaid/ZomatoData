Just like a goldsmith specializes in working with gold and other precious metals, The Cakesmith specializes in making delicious, fresh and presentable all sorts of home made cakes, brownies, muffins, tarts, etc for all occasions and hang out.

If not tried please try out all as they are value for money and taste bud. And Sponge cake is just yummy and your tongue won't get satisfied by having just One.
