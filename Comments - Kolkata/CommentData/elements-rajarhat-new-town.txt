One of the best garden cafes in Kolkata!

Location- Gate no. 6 Eco Park.

Ambience- The place is quite spacious, small hut patterned numerous seating joints outside. They also have a banquet area inside. The outside area is beautifully decorated with fountain and well maintained garden. The place is peaceful and so comfortable that make us feel that we are sitting in some hill-station and eating in the lap of nature.

Food- Ordered Sch Chilli Chicken as an appetizer, Chicken Hakka Noodles and Hunan Fish to accompany to with it. Well the appetizer came as gravy which was quite a surprise amounting to about 6 pieces. Tasted good. Noodle was on a thicker side and was moderate. Hunan fish was just outstanding, fresh fish and tasted soft and perfect.

 

The behaviour of the staffs were pretty good. And the prices are quite cheap. I missed music though. Will get popularised near-future like anything, definitely will visit again.

Location: Eco Park, Near Gate no.6

This is a lovely place for a day outing and surprisingly they serve decent food too.They have a banquet too, for conducting functions such as conferences,parties etc.

I visited this place with a group of friends when we were at Eco Park and decided to have lunch here.

We ordered:

Beverages:

Ibiza: This was a mixture of pineapple juice and vania ice cream,I found the taste to be very interesting.

Starters:

Sarsowali Mahi Tikka: The fish was very fresh and well cooked and it tasted delicious.

Lat Me Kai: This one was delicious aswell,really well flavoured.

Main Course:

Veg Fried Rice: The quality and quantity of the fried rice was really good with generous amount of veggies.

Chicken Makkhanwala: Large pieces of chicken served in a rich buttery gravy. Loved it.

Mutton Roganjosh: The mutton tasted decent aswell.

The service was good but they could have been faster,the servers were courteous.

Highly Recommended if you are at Eco Park and are looking for some delicious food.

This place will appeal to your senses the moment you enter.. A beautiful place, spacious seating arrangement amidst greenery, a fountain, a waterbody. An apt place for get togethers, celebrations, family outings.

Coming to the food. We ordered a drink named Ibiza, which was a great combination of mint and ice cream.
For starters we had
Sarsonwali Mahi Tikka - mustard fish kebabs which were soft and delicious
Lat-Me-Kai - fried chicken tossed in yummy sauce
For the main course we took
Mutton Roganjosh which was made very well. The curry tasted nice
Chicken Makkhanwala- chicken dish in rich gravy which was buttery smooth and amazing. The quantity of the food was enough for 3 people
We had these with Naan and Fried rice which were decent

Lastly we had baked roshogolla and ice cream for dessert

The lovely ambiance of the place and the affordable prices for this quantity of food made me rate them 0.5 more

This is a beautiful place to enjoy your meal if you're in Eco Park. I was here yesterday with my friends for lunch and I completely loved the ambience. The seating arrangement is wonderful. 

Coming to the food, I had two mocktails - Humble House and Crazy Shiva, where the former was a spicy kiwi based drink while the latter was a tangy tamarind drink. 

Tandoori Chicken was a good option for starters. The chicken was well grilled and was served with coriander chutney.

Pan Fried Chilli Fish had succulent pieces of fish tossed in a spicy sauce with bell peppers. 

Fried Fish with tartar sauce won my heart. The fish was soft and well fried. I wish they had served some fries with it !

For mains, the Veg Pulao was sweet and went well with creamy and spicy Hyderabadi Chicken, which was accompanied by some breads as well. 

Overall, this place should be on your must visit list if you're in Eco Park. The place looks lavish but the menu has been designed very wisely, keeping in mind the pocket pinch. The service is somewhat slow but the delicious food definitely compensates it.

We Ordered

IBIZA - A mocktail made from pineapple juice and vanilla icecream topped with mint.

Lat Me Kai Fish

Mutton Rogan Josh

Chicken Makkhanwala

This is a perfect place for celebrating good things in life and when it's December, celebrations become much more happening!!
This is what had happened last day with us and I am in love with the place ever since.
Ambiance: Beautiful huts all around which actually starts glowing post sunset(literally). Fantastic place to click loadsa pictures.
Flowers and fountain makes an alluring backdrop nevertheless.
Food: Well there can't be celebration without food right? So we ordered Tandoori chicken and Pan fried fish as starters.
This was accompanied with mocktails namely- Humble House and Crazy Shiva.
Starter:üç∑Humble house was really humble and tasted better than the other one. It's an amalgamation of kiwi crush,tangy Indian spices, Tabasco,salt, black pepper and lime juice.üëç
üçó Tandoori chicken stands out as the winner. Loved the succulent pieces and enjoyed it thoroughly with the pudina chutney. Quality and quantity was brilliant.üëå
Pan fried chilly fish looked amazing. Bit spicy but was great in taste.üëå
 Not to forget the price was so reasonable.

Mains: Chicken Hyderabadi came along with polao and assorted Indian bread. The curry was the star dish in the mains course. Wish the quantity was more! It tasted heavenly.
Achar,papad,chutney  served so neatly with the mains. Loved it.
The only drawback is the late service.
Nevertheless we enjoyed the food and hospitality. 
Such amazing items at a reasonable price at this time of the year was really surprising.‚ù§
Dessert stole the show btw.
 Shahi Tukra was SHAHI in true sense.
Perfectly fried breads tossed in sweet malai tasted like heaven. TRUST ME. Worth the wait!!!
This was the best of all. Wish it never ended!
Would love to visit this place again. Keep growing!

Elements, a beautiful place in the heart of Eco Park, will leave you awestruck with its sheer beauty,service, food and ambience. The place is beautifully decorated and is perfect for any kind of celebration, get-together,dating and leisure time with family. If you visit this place during the evening, you will be able to relish the beauty of sunset. Loved the ambience and beauty of the place totally. Service was commendable.
Now coming to the food, the following things we had:

Tandoori Chicken- delicious i must say. The chicken was tender and the flavours were perfectly balanced.

Chili Pan Fried Fish: lip-smacking dish. Fish being soft and the spicyness was just approriate. Loved it.

Tandoori Roti,Hydrabadi Chicken,Fried Fish,Veg Pulao- each and every item was yummm. Loved the fried fish and hydrabadi chicken. The aroma and flavour from the pulao was soo good. The roti was soft. 
In between our food, we had two beverages- one being Humble House and the other one Crazy Shiva. Though the drink tasted nice but i felt they need to put on more effort on it to make it absolutely wow. The drinks lacked certain charmness and the wow factor. So they really need to look upon their beveragrs section. 
To conclude our meal, we had gulab jamun, shahi tukra, gajar ka halwa and ice cream. All of them were soo soo good. 

You should visit this place; absolutely worth trying.

Located in Eco Park,Rajarhat.The place is near Gate number 6 of Eco Park.The place is quite spaced out and serves some good food.
The place is beautifully decorated & has a lot of greenery around. Loved the ambience of the place. It makes you feel that you have come close to nature.
We started with the Mocktails 

*Humble House (Recommended)
Quite refreshing and really loved it.
*Crazy Shiva
We ordered this just because of its unique name.It was decent.
*Chicken Tandoori (Recommended)
Loved both the quality & quantity.The Tandoori was soft and loved the smoky flavor of it.
*Pan Fried Chilli Fish
This was slightly on the sweeter side but the quantity was good.
*Fried Fish (Strongly Recommended)
Big chunks of fish perfectly Crumb Fried and served with a Mayo Dip.For me this was the showstopper. This is a must order.One thing I must say is that you will be amazed to see the quantity for the price they charge you.
*Butter Naan
Soft & good and a lots of butter.Do you need anything more?
*Hyderabadi Chicken (Recommended)
Tender pieces of Chicken served in a flavourful Gravy.Perfect combo with the Naan.
*Gajar Ka Halwa
A perfect dessert on a Winter day.
*Shahi Tukra (Strongly Recommended)
This was one of the best & authentic Shahi Tudka I have had in a long time.

The place is very beautiful and serves good food if they work on their service this place will be a hit.

Firstly, the ambience is on point for a romantic dinner date. The huts are located at right distances, not very close to each other. Now coming to the food, we ordered the following:

1. Mocktails: Bliss and Nirvana
-Bliss was actually a mix of orange, pineapple and mango juice with vanilla ice cream and Indian spices. This drink was not matching my taste buds but was fine when tasted in small quantity.
-Nirvana was a melon based drink with yoghurt, mint, coriander and Indian spices. According to me, this is something you should try. It tasted very good.

2. Starters: Murgh Lasooni Tikka and Drums of Heaven
-Murgh Lasooni Tikka was a bit try but delicious at the same time.
-Drums of heaven is A MUST TRY here. It was amazing.

3. Main Course: Chicken Lababdar, Fish Begum Bakar and Naan
-The chicken dish won my heart in the main course section. Again A MUST TRY.
-The fish begum bakar was a very simple Indian fish item which went well with the naan.
-The naan was soft and the best thing about naan was that it wasn't too thick.

4. Desserts: Hot Gulab Jamun and Vanilla Ice cream
-The gulab jamuns were succulent. They sprinkled pistachio over it and that just added the cherry on top.
-Overall a very good experience at this joint with amazing ambience and great food.

Service could have been better.

So today we tried out this place in Eco Park . I heard about it from a friend and decided to drop in. 

For the drinks we ordered Ibiza and Indian twist . While the latter was ok , the former was amazing . It was a thick kind of shake made of pineapple juice and icecream with a tinge of mint . 

For starters , we had a chicken and a fish item .

‚ö´Ô∏èLat Me Kai : This was slightly on the sweeter side , I liked it though .

‚ö´Ô∏èSarsowali Mahi Tikka : This was mindblowing to say the least . Huge chunks of fish grilled with just the right amount of spices . Recommended* 

Coming to the mains , we ordered : 

‚ö´Ô∏è Chicken Makkhanwala : Butter Chicken basically with a very thick and lipsmacking gravy . Went well with the breads . 

‚ö´Ô∏è Mutton RoganJosh : Mutton pieces were tender , the dish had a newness to it . Recommended* 
 
The fried rice was good too . 

Had the Baked Rossogolla and Icecream for dessert , which was the best way to end the meal .

This is one beautiful property, in eco park. You should definitely visit around evening.. so that you get to experience, the sunset and the dim lights in the cabanas. 
The food was decent. But service could be really far better. 
And I'm sure it is owing to it being a new property. 
For the food, we had crazy Shiva, humble house for mocktails. They weren't impressive but you could try. 
For starters, we ordered chicken tandoori and panfried chilli fish. Loved them . 
Main course included, assorted bread, pulao and hyderabadi chicken. The gravy was really tasty. 

And desserts were shahi tukra and gulaab jaamun. Pretty tasty. Perfect ending. 
Kudos to the place with a lot of expectations to improve very soon.
The ambience is amaaazing. Beautiful and serene.

Elements is located in Eco Park,Rajarhat New Town,best way to enter through gate no 6.The ambience is amazing and pleasant.A conference banquet is also available within this, it's a little farm house you can say into the Eco Park with eye glittering Garden and little huts.Visited this place today with a bunch of friends.
Let's come to the food now.
Lat-me-Kai was amazing to start with, it's delicious, divine and delightful, quantity was impressive, highly recommend of them.
In mocktails we have tried Ibiza,contains pineapple juice,vanilla ice cream and mint syrup, it's refreshing and enjoyable.
In main course,Mutton Roganjosh was lipsmacking with the Assorted Indian Bread.They also served Achar,Papad and Chutney,papads were crunchy.
We also had Chicken Makkhanwala with the fried rice,the chicken was appealing and mind blowing in taste with the rice, another recommend one of them.
It's a great place to enjoy weekend evenings with family and friends.A must visit.

5/5 of not because of amazing quality of food or the extraordinary level of service or wonderful ambience. They deserve full marks because we could not imagine anything better within that price range. The food, the outdoor sitting at cabanas, the indoor non ac sitting the behaviour of the people working their made our Saturday evening wonderful.

The place is kind of isolated and almost out of reach of the common crowd of Ecopark as it is far from the popular gates 1,2,3, and 4. It will be easier to reach their from the gate no. 5 or 6. So if you want to spend a nonalcoholic evening with your loved ones without having a big pinch in your pocket then probably it could be the place of your choice.

Give a chance to crunchy fried bhetki, hopefully you will get the value of your money.

One suggestion to the management is to think about the choice of music.The common bollywood hits do not go with the ambience.

This place is located just near the eco park gate no. 5. They have separate parking area..so if u are traveling by car can easily avail it from gate no. 5 or you have to walk for about 20 minutes from Eco park main gate.
This restraunt has 3 sections: 
1. Ac indoor seating
2. Non Ac indoor seating 
3. Outdoor seating
All 3 seating areas are beautifully decorated...they also book for parties and corporate events. Such a lovely place for dining along with your friends family or loved ones. At outdoor seating they have some cottage like areas where you can seat and enjoy a cozy evening though the place ia bit dirty and these areas also don't include fans but but...this place is surrounded by many trees so no deficiency of natural air is possible. If u opt for a lunch then I'll suggest to go for indoor seating... there the decors are also good... along with fancy chairs and and resort like environment with some light music... sounds Romantic nah? It is actually.
Now come to the food: 
The menu includes both Indian and Chinese dishes although very little options to choose.
We opted for a biriyani combo and a noodles combo.
Both were low in cost.they included cold drinks and were nicely served. There are very few staffs so it can get a little late. Biriyani was perfect though the pieces of chicken in noodles were not properly cooked. Great quantity and low in price makes this place a must visit whenever u go to Eco park for a beautiful and different dining experience.

Heaven for a photographer... Great ambiance with normal food.
The restaurant is in eco Park (gate no 6).
Now talk about the ambiance.. They have three different sections.. First one is open air second one is infront the repection with hanging fans nd third one is a huge Hall with AC...
I desperately love with the open air section(because of the background for clicking).
And the last thing is food..They don't have huge variety in their menu.We had sizzler chicken as starter Chicken biriyni for main course nd chicken lababdar With Cold drinks...
Sizzler chiken.... Chicken was soft nd nicely cooked not very spicy,presence of a unknown crunchy spice bring the taste low.. (2.5/5)
Chicken biriyni.... Normal biriyni served with raita nd onion with one chicken nd half potato... Every thing was well cooked nd okk type taste ... The raita was very peppery. (3.5/5)
Chicken lababdar ...we ordered two chicken lababdar. Served in two different bowl with different taste. First one was chicken lababdar but second one tastes like butter chicken .. Each bowl contains 3 big pieces of chicken... (3.5/5)
We asked for cold drinks(don't have any soft drinks or cocktails in their menu)...They served hot thumbs up as cold drink! The water was much cold then the thumbs up... (2/5)
One biriyni and chicken lababdar is enough for two normal appetite person.
If food was the biggest thing for you then my recommendation is NO... Bt If want  to click and food is just a option for you then go for it.

One of the major distractions for your hangout is traffic and cosmopolitan buzz. Perhaps that is the reason you plan sudden getaways out of the concrete jungle.

Located within 100 metres from Westin Hotel, Elements provides you with that escape you solicit for. Its peaceful, away from traffic congestion and horns. The feeling you get is an amalgamation of resort and restaurant. A Resortaurant may be?

Apart from the tasty food, well behaved mandarins, the atmosphere in and around will compel you to visit again. The experience I had cannot be laconic. If you are looking for a quality eon within kolkata, with an outside the city feeling then this is the perfect place waiting for your advent.

Please see, the review is based on the experience I and my friends had. Would like to go again whenever I visit ecopark, hidco auditorium, Kolkata Gate or CC2.

Heard about this place from a friend, this place is almost hidden in rajarhat very difficult to locate but the ambience is out of the world very very very different from other restaurants, it's a place which is inside the city yet the feel is almost of a place which outside the city, this is definitely one of the most uncommon places and different places in Kolkata, perfect place to organise even our corporate parties I feel. I think this place will give good competition to other restaurants in Rajarhat. I only wish the place was more visible, it's definitely the next big thing of Rajarhat

Discovered this lovely place at Eco Park. Bit isolated yet a soothing place to hang around. Books and cold coffee feels totally different. Must visit.

Don't get carried away by the good reviews!
This place doesn't even deserve 1 rating!

The food they serve is stale, cold n smelly!
They also serve in our university canteen!
Last week Friday (30.06.17) we had an exhibition in our university and they (ELEMENTS) served us lunch. From Saturday (01.07.17) I got a bit stomach upset and today Monday (03.07.17) I am having severe food poisoning. Forget solids , now body is not allowing liquids also. Even if I am drinking water, I'm vomiting in 3-4mins! I never ever had such an extreme food poisoning!

Tonight I may have to get hospitalised!

I am sure there will be more students who got sick after that day! Many of the students opened the boxes n threw it away. It was a hectic day due to exhibition n some of them like me , ate some! The biggest mistake of my life. I couldn't have left the exhibition stall n go for lunch coz the evaluation could have happened anytime! I NEVER THOUGHT ACTUALLY THAT OUR UNIVERSITY COULD COLLABORATE WITH SUCH A STANDARD LESS Restaurant..

Please please avoid this place if u don't want to get severely sick. PATHETIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Very good taste indeed. Tandoori kebabs are delicious, biryani is simply mouth watering and chicken tikka masala was also good. Service is quick. I am a fan of their Mutton Biryani...the super amazing taste of it will excite all your taste buds to feel that taste repeatedly. The awesomeness of two tender Mutton pieces which are perfectly cooked make this really worth of spending money...

Hundi chicken is also great. Visit recommend.

Went for a post-birthday Lunch with a friend. It is located in eco park. The ambiance is lovely and the food is equally delicious. We ordered Salt/Pepper chicken, Mixed Fried rice, Szechwan Chicken and Kumpao chicken. I never tried Kumpao chicken before and now am in love with this . The quantity is pretty good and the quality is unquestionable. Hope to visit again and this time with my family... :)

Probably one of the best cafes in Kolkata. Excellent Service. Delicious dishes. Amazing ambiance. All are here. We ordered Fish Fry & pinacolada. Fish Fry was very delicious & Pinacolada was just the best cooler in this hot weather. Both of the dishes can be shared among 2. Quantities of Each dishes are sufficient enough for 2 people. Its quite reasonable too.

Located inside eco park , one can avail gate no 5 or gate no 6 (near harinalay) to reach.
the place is ¬†indeed a hidden gem with amazing open air cabanas. the breezy evenings are the best to spend over here. they also offer indoor seating. but its main attraction is the outdoor sitting arrangement. ¬†the food price is reasonable and the staff are cordial enough. the taste and quantity is fine. but the ambiance makes this so special and unique. you can relax and enjoy the music along with the fine breeze and good food. u can feel the nature at it's best. only one thing to keep in mind - they close quite early at 8.30pm(max). i feel its more meant for evening snacks than for dining. looking forward to hop in a number of times. i feel cafe ekante will now get a serious competition.

The place is located very conveniently in eco park and the best part is they have outdoor as well as indoor seating arrangements, you can simply chill at the cabanas with your family and try good food, the menu is pretty good with loads of options from indian to Chinese and are very much affordable.

Nice place to relax and taste delicious food amidst the beautiful lush green Eco Park in kolkata. Time just passes by and leaves you with a relaxing and rejuvenating feeling. The best part about this place is the open air cabanas, the music and the ambiance. Not to forget the behavior of the staff is very courteous and the food is great! I am surely visiting this place again whenever i go to new town rajarhat!

They provide service in our college canteen. The price of the combo meals are a bit low. Pocket friendly. We ordered chicken kathi roll and coke. The roll was wrapped with plastic, that's really awful. But the taste was awesome. I would suggest to not wrap the foods by plastics‚Äã.
