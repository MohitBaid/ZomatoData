This place is a goldmine. I have been visiting this place since donkey years. 
Though the interior is not maintained and the space can be utilized way more effectively (Basically dated), the food is what one dies for here.

The Moglai, the chicken cutlet and the Chinese is simply really very good!
The price is extremely reasonable.

I have been visiting this place since I was a kid. Its a favorite hangout joint for my family. I just love their Chinese dishes.
Must try - chicken sweet and corn soup ( its a pure bliss!!)
Prawn fried rice,Manchurian chicken, garlic chicken,special chicken and fish cutlet are my personal favorites!!

Its almost same as Sangu Valley restaurant... just like brothers living beside each other....
Review same as Sanguvalley.... Just this guys dont add pork to food.. 

Decor : Bad... Very Very Old.....

Food : Not great.. but ok for just a casual dine... i would suggest to go for chinese only.. and may be mughlai paratha can be allowed... but never go for the horrible biriryani... the rices are so thick that u will have to bring cutter with u to crack it...

Price : super cheap.... cant be cheaper....

Service : Fine...same old...

Great GrandPaa Hotel

Its one of the old heritage and legendary restaurant of kolkata..Recently visited during puja..Its kindaa falling apart still their snacks and rice items are good on the go !!  Typically like that old vintage feeling.

Don't ever go by the looks since this small restaurant in it's most shoddy look can never appear impressive. But if u taste chicken afghani and kabiraji, the sheer delicacy will remind u of the old Kolkata culinary magic. Just beside the bhawanipore petrol station on the main road, it's a must visit for all.... Pure Kolkatan heritage!!!

Typical old Kolkata style restaurant, good with the standard chop-cutlet. Ambience is bare minimalistic but good location and friendly staff. Had Fish fry, chicken cutlette, chicken kabiraji cutlette and moglat porota. Moghlai and Kabiraji was quite nice, others ordinary. Overall, i wanted to recreate our college days with my son and wife and that was pretty much done.

Cabin system is really poor. Food is average but service of the waiters depend upon your tip. If have to promise a good top to be able to sit longer... Just dissuading.

I had heard that this is a reputed restaurant and hence paid a visit, to have a sort of light lunch.

I had Chilli Chicken Dry (B/L) here. The dish was good (4.0) but however compared to the environment and the quantity they offered I was disappointed. The tables are shabby, not well maintained, they didn't have the menu when i asked for the same and hence it was only a verbal sort of menu they offered. Once reputed and well known to college goers and couples, it is now wretched and fails to leave a mark. The food however is worth a visit!

This is the kind of place where our many of our parents went, bunking their college classes. Sadly, the same can't be said of the present college generation now, mainly because the place is crumbling down. Peeling walls, torn curtains, broken fans, dirty tables, bored waiters in shambled clothes.. the place is nearly finished. The patrons are few and the owner looks grim.
The menu is tattered and most of the items which made it famous have been innocuously struck off. Most of the rest are not available or are tasteless. The few remaining choices you have are petty common street food with inflated prices. 
I was incensed to hear that you have to buy at least 2 plates of Chicken Kussa if you want to order. Aparently that's restaurant policy !!

Chakraborty Tip : I don't want people to avoid going there as dwindling footfall is slowly killing the place, but then again there is little to recommend it.
