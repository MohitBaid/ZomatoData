Haji provides really good biryani at just Rs.70 for Chicken and Rs.90 for Mutton biryani is one of the best biryani in town at this price.
The only poor thing about Haji is too much oil in their Biryani.
They also make Chicken Chap and Mutton Chap which are also very good to taste with biryani.

Tried their biryani which was actually quite okay and light. Though it doesn't come anywhere near the Arsalan biryani, but this place's biryani is befitting a quick biryani takeaway on a weekend.

Shoot to this area and they will provide you with the perfect blend of rice and spices. And the chicken chaap is a must try. Though they have a small sitting place, its advised to go for a takeaway. Amazing food . must try

This small Biriyani house is located right on busy Belilious Road of Howrah Town, it is quite a famous shop in the locality serving Mutton biriyani, Chicken biriyani, Veg biriyani, salad.The place is not exactly a very good place to have a meal.But is perfect for takeaway.The food that is biriyani only is served in hyderabadi stlye of biriyani which is suppose to be masaledar I.e. spicy.I am very fond of this shop and am a regular customer with them when ever I visit my parents. One advice it is better to get your food parcelled and eat in the comfort of your home.
