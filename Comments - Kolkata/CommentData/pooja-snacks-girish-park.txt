Once a regular customer as my classes were located there. Located at the main crossing of Girish Park. Variety of veg Gravy dishes with quick service. Not enough space as you have to enjoy the food without having a seat. Good enough for daily eaters as you have to loose your pocket little to satisfy your hunger.

In terms of price quality and quantity served the place is good,but the ambience and staff are bad. It is a place where you can opt-out for takeaways.

Owing to the extremely inexpensive yet good food, bad ambiance & staff, this is probably the place from where you would like to take a parcel from, there is no seating available. It's a shabby looking place which offers a wider variety of dishes than you would expect. The quality of the food is justified according to the inexpensive rates. It's definitely not a place for fine dine. It's customers include students from nearby coachings & working people looking for cheap lunch.

This place is located on the corner of Girish Park chowk.
One might say that this place is horrible and the staff is aweful too but let me tell you that as far as food is concerned , this place serves the best marwari veg food in this part of the city and the prices are just perfect for the regular goers like students.It is totally pocket friendly.
Do not mind the staff and the ambience of this place , as this is a inexpensive food joint for the masses and they can not give you a fancy treatment for the prices they offer.
Just opt for  a TAKE AWAY from this place and enjoy the best veg marwari food in the comfort of your home at unbelievable prices.
PS:Try the pakodi ki kadhi.

Horrible place. Everything about dis place is so wayward. The quality of the food do not do justice to the inflated rates. Even the behaviour of the staff is not appreciable
