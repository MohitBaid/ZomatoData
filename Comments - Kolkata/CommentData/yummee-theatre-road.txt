Located at the back gate of St. Xavier's,Park Street. It's a takeaway joint that offers cheap fast food.
Both school and college students flock here after class hours for rolls and fried rice/noodles.
Rolls are good with crisp paratha and decent filling.
Hygiene standards should be made better.

This place is just outside the back gate of St Xaviers College. This is a very nice place. Student friendly prices. They have a wide menu. Food is very tasty. Seating arrangement isn't there; it's a take away counter. My all time favourite is the non veg combo. I have also tried the cheese roll and chicken roll; all of them are really yummy.

I've had their Veg Combo of Noodles & Manchurian and no doubt they were one of the best noodles & Manchurian I've tasted in Kolkata. Quite poket friendly and taste is the best. The only thing which u didn't like is they cook Veg & Non - Veg in the same pan!

Best for Xaverians, backgate saviour. 
It's a takeaway, so forget ambience here. 
It's a roadside, non branded takeway, so forget about the quality of food. 
Basic food items like chilli chicken and fried rice or rolls are tasty, but substandard in quality so one may get stomach upsets. But then, it's so cheap in price rates and quick delivery of food, you can either be okay with the quality or avoid it all together.

Located opposite to the back gate of St. Xavier's College, this is a tiny food joint selling very tasty noodles and delicious rolls. I specially like the spicy Szechwan Noodles. It is popular among students for the unbelievably cheap prices. The place remains crowded all the time. 

P.S. You need to turn a blind eye to the hygeine scene of this eatery, if you are going to eat there.

You will never find a student of St.Xavier's College who does not know about this place. Some visit this place for it's Cheese Rolls while some others including myself go for it's spicy yet delicious Schezwan Noodles. And it is so pocket friendly that you can eat here on a regular basis without worrying about your budget.

Location: St Xaviers back gate!

This is a basic fast food shop, hyped by the college crowd from Xaviers.

Hygiene is really questionable like any other street joint.

I had a plate of chili garlic noodles. (₹50) The taste was okayish, nothing great.

They use cheap quality sauces as expected. Artificial red color is added to give that hue to the noodles.

Whenever we hear the word Yummee that surely gives us the sign of something very tasty. Just like that they have kept the name of their outlet so that whenever someone calls it they feel having something like that from here. This is their 2nd outlet which i have tried. 1st one is at Elliot road which was quite decent. This outlet is Located opposite to St. Xavier's College beside Goli Vada pav. Basically a a street side fast food joint they are but with quite a variety for all the students out there and the passing by. This place needs lot of improvement in the hygiene, it was really dirty all over the place. 
 Went there in the afternoon at 3.30 pm and checked the menu where Mr. Akhter the owner himself helped us to decide the menu and told lot about them. 
Discussing hard on the menu and very precisely we choose the following for quick bites.

1. Chicken Chowmien - Served in a small thermo coal bowl It contained good amount of veggies in it. Chow used were thin and long. Got lil disappointed with the preparations and the presentation, taste was very average. I took a small bowl of chicken noodles which at that rate i guess is higher.

2. Egg Roll - The second dish was tried and it was good enough to save the day. The paratha was soft and a bit crunchy somewhere, quality was also satisfactory.

With the two dishes only i don't think its too easy to judge. But they surely need to do well on the quality as well as the quantity. May be the hungry students will be lesser concerned about the above said things but the flying ones surely will.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

                Due to its location, there's always a line of hungry students lined up. Both the Chinese and the rolls are a feast for the taste buds and doesn't burn a hole in your pocket. However, it's not necessarily the most hygienic place and unless you have a strong immunity system I wouldn't recommend this place.

Now this is one place where you are going to get good food at very cheap rates. They serve the typical desi Chinese food. It tastes really nice. Obviously not authentic but I can guarantee that you will like the taste. The Chilli Chicken is very tasty and cooked quite well! Moreover the quantity served is very generous and price quite less! 
The chicken fried rice was very good too. There were quite a lot of pieces of chicken and the rice even all by itself tasted very nice. 
So all in all it's a very good option to eat when you're running low on cash. No wonder this place is so popular!

Every hungry Xaverian's saviour, this outlet sells cheap Chinese and rolls. The chicken cheese roll here tastes nice enough. They also sell Chinese combo meals of egg noodles and chilli chicken which you can curate according to your tastes. I usually opt for the rice with the chicken. The chilli garlic chicken fried rice is extremely spicy but tasty too.

This is a small eatery outlet just opposite St Xavier's College back gate. 
No searing/dine in available 

Food was very unhygienic. I had ordered a Veg. Combo which included a plate of chowmein with only 2 pieces of manchurian. Even after instructing the cook to make it less oily, he dumped the chowmein into a pool of oil !! 
Result = Uneatable. I had to throw away more than half as I couldn't compromise it with my health...

I will never eat here again...

Located opposite St. Xavier's college, it is considered to be more like a Xavier's college and school canteen, as 99% of its patrons are the students and their guardians. They are even closed for business during the school/ college holidays :P Their rolls are lipsmackingly tasty esp their chicken and the paneer rolls. Initially their noodles and fried rice was good, but now it is very oily and does not have the initial appeal. It is very crowded during the lunch hours and in the evenings, so you have to wait a while for your order. Though nowadays they have compromised on the quantity and taste, it is still the best option in the area for quick meal.

For the entirity of the  first 2 years in xaviers we were solely dependent on YUMMEE's Mixed chow or mixed fried rice. that was our staple. Its more of a take-away counter. Their rolls are quite nice be it paneer or chicken roll. Momo is good too but they dont serve soup with momo. I have to say Food quality have been compromised after the change of the cook. It doesnot taste the same and the food has become very oily. They introduced schzwan noodles and rice which is very hot n spicy. Sides are decent enogh compared to their price.     Its very crowded during the lunch hours i.e 12.30- 1.30pm. You may wanna avoid the crowd.

Yummee is a part of every Xaverian's list. Being just opposite to the St. Xavier's College backgate,  I have been here several times. I love their rolls,  even the veg roll. The schezwan fried rice and the chilli garlic fried rice taste awesome n spicy along with the extra sauce/chillies(I ask for them every time). The noodles taste good too. A quick stop for street food lovers.

If you are a Xaverian and you have not been to Yummee... you must be kidding!! People flock to this place whole day and inside the campus, a person walking with a pack of chow from Yummee is very common. We are yet to try their famous chowmein but we have tried their egg roll. I have had better egg rolls but location wise, being just opposite to the college back gate, it's a life saver when you have sudden roll/chowmein-cravings!

Visited this place yesterday after  directly ordered Veg garlic chow half plate.. Gravy was not available. The guy at the counter took previously prepared noodles and added a red color paste in the wok.so the quantity for half was  ok not good. The price was also decent. Coming to the taste it was mild surprisingly considering the color of the paste.. I expected it to be spicy.the taste was nothing extraordinary. 
I would rate this place as an average joint serving street food with a little twist and having more varieties than normal hawkers.

With the start of xaviers life, my association with this street joint starts. O decent seating arrangement. Street food at excellence. The chicken chilli garlic noodles is unbeatable.  So r d other noodles  u may as well try the rolls .. mutton roll specially. Also the schezwan rice is yummmmeeeee.. affordable n irresistible. .

Yummee is your life saver if you are a Xaverian. Located bang opposite the St. Xavier's College back gate, the place is always crowded by students. There is no seating arrangement, hence you can have your food standing or pack it up for home.

Coming to the food,
Yummee is an absolute gem when it comes to non vegetarian food. The Chicken roll they make is as best as you can get. The chicken pieces are large and soft, and succulent. The masala added to increases the taste and the paratha is super soft and oil'free almost.
The Chinese too is amazing. You will get a packet full of Chicken fried rice in just 35 bucks! Thats a ripper. The portion is massive and generous amount chicken too is given. The chicken is fresh and the taste is very decent. The flavours can be distinguished and appreciated. More than you can expect from a street joint. Yummee indeed, lives up to its name!

If you're in Xavier's, you're sure to catch a glimpse of someone or the other carrying a yumme Ka dabba and hogging on the chowmein or fried rice or their oh-so-famous rolls inside the campus, at any time of the day. 

Being a vegetarian, i took a long time to try out this particular outlet. Honestly, i wasn't pleased by it at first- the paneer  roll seemed bland to me when I had a bite of it from my friend's but then I realized I like mine with loads of ketchup- so I let it pass 

The chowmein here is really REALLY tasty but on the oily side though. 
I am not so fond of their fried rice- however team it up with chilli paneer and it's yummmeeee indeed!

The quantity is enough for two if you take the full plate. Usually we have the half plate And for me- it's more than enough. 
Easy on pocket- yes. 

This is indeed the perfect place for all the carnivorous Xavierians!


P. S. Leave everything else and try their chilli garlic fried rice as well as noodles. The best.

Every day at around 12:45, students come flooding out of the St. Xavier's College back-gate and rush to the unostentatious stall situated right across the street. The air is filled with the sights and sounds of sizzling hot food being cooked at the speed of light; and a spicy-tangy aroma tantalises the nostrils. Welcome to Yummee - probably the most appropriately named roadside eatery ever. 
For a student with a slim purse and a voracious appetite, Yummee dishes up Chinese and Indian snacks with elan. The rolls are to-die-for, with juicy meat or paneer wrapped in fresh laccha parathas and coated with a spicy sauce. The fried rice, chowmein and chilli/garlic chicken all rival quality restaurants - for a cheap stall, the quality really is astonishingly good. Perhaps best of all are the rates - a half plate of fried rice or one roll cost about 30-40 each, and one item is filling enough for a hungry diner. Pair it with a half-plate of chicken and you have a wonderful Chinese meal that sets you back less than INR 100. 
Yummee is more than just an affordable eatery for Xaverians - it's a new standard in budget meals. Several overpriced restaurants I know would do well to pick up cookery tips from here. No matter what you try, you'll be left with a warm full tummy and a sigh of satisfaction on your lips.

This the the most crowded place when St.Xavier's stalls for its break time. They have the most yummy rolls EVER. be it the veg roll, or the chicken roll or the paneer roll, they are all brilliant. Whenever i go there i either order an egg chicken roll or shezwaan chicken rice or noodles. They make it right before you and serve it hot and the quantity is also very generous. It's really delicious. However, once i had ordered chicken momos there and they were really bad so you know what to order there. Also. yummee is really cheap and they don't make u wait for a long time. It is a good fast food option fr people who want good food but don't want to spend a lot on it.

If I am nearby Short Street, nothing can keep me away from Yummee. Yes! The name of this place is perfectly justified. Situated at 3B Short Street near St. Xavier's College Back Gate, Yummee is a Chinese restaurant serving a wide range of Chinese as well as fast food preparations at reasonably low rate. Nothing much to talk about the ambience, Yummee is a small restaurant with limited outdoor seating arrangements. The ambience may disappoint many but when you will look at the menu card along with the rate chart, you will understand that this ambience merely matters as you are getting Mixed Chow@ only Rs. 50 and so on. Where on earth you will find such?

Now considering such a low price, many may doubt about the quality as I did when I was there for the first time. Truly speaking, my first experience has returned me to this place many times. It is true that preparations served here are not obviously like Mainland China or Jimmy's Kitchen but not too bad to swallow. The preparations are by and large mediocre. Whenever I am there, I prefer to have chow or rice preparations along with some side dish. One thing about side dish, I need to mention. The taste is fine and the item is also perfect when it is a veg preparation, especially paneer. But whenever it comes to chicken preparation, you will find very small pieces of chicken. The chicken balls in Chilli Chicken, Hong Kong Chicken etc are filled with corn flour coating with very small chicken stuffing. And one more thing, it is always better not to try any kind of soup here. It is better to rename soup as spicy boiled water. However the roll section is fine. The parathas are thick and are well stuffed with the fillings. So whenever I don't have a plan to sit and dine here, I prefer to have Chicken or Veg roll.
