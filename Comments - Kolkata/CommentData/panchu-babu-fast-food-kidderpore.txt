Maybe a shadow of its self during the glory days, but still sells fabulous chicken fry, stew and bread and kosha mangsho and bread. It is run by the sons of the legendary Panchu babu. The tea is made with darjeeling leaves and is very good too. I make it a point to visit whenever I am passing by.

The rate at which this once famous food joint has degraded is even faster than the changes in slope of an exponential graph. Once famous for its FISH KABIRAJI and KOSHA MANGSHO WITH BREAD its presently a shadow of its glorious past. Dissapointing.

Over hyped fast food center. May be its essence of old "Calcutta" attracts people a lot. Been there a lot of time and tried different items. Foods are a bit over priced.

Road side shop.. Offers cutlets and kabirajis mainly.. Their tea happens to be great too.. Your typical Road Side Joint.. Their vegetable chop and Bread Omelette seem to be quite famous !

Dont go by the looks....if this line is applicable to anyone, then this is it. The place brings with a history of more than a hundred years. The true spirit of a bengali can be identified when you see hungry faces gulping d sandwiches with the exquisite hot chicken stew....awww...its a heavenly pleasure. What is behind their recipe and their secret to deliver such tasty food at such reasonable prices, which shall draw your attention to ask the owner, the real reason behind.
My salute to such an ancient joint, may the legacy be passed onto the coming generations too.
A must visit for a true bengali !!!

This joint has been running for I guess more than hundred years and in the same way and same place and still looks the same and serves the same items it served year's ago...it is even rumuored that the great uttam kumar came to eat here....they start serving food from 7 am in the morning with fried eggs, boiled eggs , tea , butter toast and continue throughout the day with their Mutton Kasha,Mutton Stu, Fish Kabiraji , Chicken fry ,Moughlai paratha .. etc....my personal favorites are their chicken fry which is a big chicken leg fried in egg batter and can easily give KFC a run for their money......and the other one is their moughlai paratha which they serve with French fries and salad and gets finished within an hour it's cooked...... This joint located at kidderpore is dirt cheap and food is unbelievable tasty....their mutton curry hot and with lots of chillies is served with bread and is also awesome.....
