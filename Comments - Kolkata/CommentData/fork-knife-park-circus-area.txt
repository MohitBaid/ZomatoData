A nice place to have indian food. Everything that we ordered was very good.To start with we had ordered manchow soup.It was indeed very nice. Starters were also good. The black dal was just superb..However the service was very slow despite the fact that it was not very crowded.
Would say a must visit place .

Fork & Knife (Orion West Willows Hotel) Small place with a seating capacity of 20/25 maximum.¬†
Ambiance is reasonably good. The food was good but got disappointed as the items suggested were missing. On Inquiring came to know that they were specially made for bloggers and special invites. Now this is what is not expected as the recommended dishes were not for general Guests. We had ordered Sweet Corn soup Manchow soup and Lemon Coriander Soup. The soups were good but Lemon Coriander Soup was exception good. The starters were nothing great, we ordered American Corn with Pepper salt, Khasta Kebab and Cheese Chili Cigar. For Main Course It was Amritsari Dal, Dal Makhani, Shyam Savera, Paneer MAkhani and Kadhai Veg. All were good nothing exceptional. Breads were good specially the Tandoori Roti was made crisp to perfection. Normally either its not well cooked or burnt in the process of making Crisp. Kesar Pista Kulfi and Malpua with Rabdi was too good. Montecarlo was a disaster as there was not icecream in it and it looked like a Mouse. The poRtions are very SMALL so pls keep that in mind while ordering.Overall Nothing Great apart from few exceptions.

They have uploaded their Italian menu but on visiting you don't find it on asking they say they have just uploaded it for publicity. I had ordered Indian as they said it was their specialty but the Food was just okay to digest. üòï You will even find it hard to sit as the tables there can hardly accommodate 4 people. Price of food it high according to it's taste. So i would like to say go at your own risk.

Where's the food got an official invite for the launch of the new ala carte breakfast menu in fork and knife -a pure vegetarian restaurant located opposite mocha ..
This new ala carte menu got launched today and it is simply delicious.Apart from ala carte menu this place also serves regular items in their buffet like idli, dosa, poha , chole bhature and muffins.
The new ala carte menu is available for the in- house guests along with the outsiders too.You can host a breakfast party for your friends or family in this restaurant and it can accomodate upto 70-75 pax.
Very few places are coming up in kolkata which has such varied range of items for breakfast.

This place has some really good and unique food items which the veggie food lovers would simply love ! 

We had varied range of food items and each item was bite worthy and must say the host Mr Amit bajoria was one gentleman who did not leave any stone unturned to make us comfortable!

Well, lets quickly have a look at the sumptuous breakfast which this place had to offer!

To begin with we were made to have scrambled vegetables on toast which was a wholesome dish assorted with different vegetables like freshly chopped carrot beans tomatoes amd babycorn in white sauce spread evenly on the toast tossed with grated cheese.
The presentation of the dish was really good.

The next dish that was presented was kanji wada dipped in sugarcane juice...
Yes, you heard it right!
All the kanji wada lovers, here's a sweet twist to your tastebuds..its a dish having a taste fusion of sugarcane and kaanji wada.This dish surely topped all the dishes seved and the twist was really tasteworthy! Great job guysüëèüèº

The next dish served to us was veg romlette.Well you read it right its romlette and not omlette.This a new dish made specially for the veggie food lovers and you would simply love this dish specially all the potato eaters as this is a roesti made wid all the veggies stuffed inside and served with a home based cheese sauce.Another well presented dish which was really really filling and one can just get away with this dish only happily and merrily with a happy tummy.

The another famous dish here which was quite unique and all time favourite for all the breakfast eaters is kachori platter..
So this dish has four differnt type of kachoris served two each with yummy aloo ki sabzi..
The kachori served here are khasta kachori, matar ki kachori, besan kachori and normal hing kachori which is much much fluffier than the normal ones that we eat in guptas or the famous sharma dhabas!
Khasta kachori topped my list and loved it the most of all.
Whata delight this platter was..

The last dish that we tried was corn on toast.It was again a nice dish with creamy cheese white sauce mixed well with sweet corn spread well in the crisp toast.

They also have pancakes with blueberry and chocolate toppings which was another delight .
You can just not get away with your breakfast without some sweet dish in the end.
Why not go for some assorted pancakes rather than usual jalebis and gulab jamuns?

The ala carte menu also has some  with mouthmelting shakes(strawberry and chocolate) along with the famous cold coffee which is favouritest of the chef and the host himself!

The restaurant is also going to add new item- sphagetti in cream sauce soon along with apple crepes and more assorted pancakes.
Well this has already got me drooling and I am surely visiting this restaurant soon.

The dinner and lunch menu is also great here and varied options for all the veggie eaters!

So folks get yourselves to this healthy place for some delish and appetizing breakfast and start your day like a king with a happy tummy..



Thanks Mr amit bajoria for such a nice treat!
May your restaurant do wonders and  all the very best for new ventures!

‚ÄãFork & Knife (Orion West Willows Hotel) has recently launched a new breakfast alacart menu for Kolkatans And I had the privilege to attend the Breakfast Launch. ¬†Here are 5 reasons to try it out ..¬†. 1. Breakfasts parties are trending this winter. You maybe an early morning jogger, or maybe returning from a late night party, or just maybe someone with pre-going-to-work cravings, or a plain foodie.
                                                                ...

I want to ask you all something. Have you been in a dilemma of conflicted choices when deciding a breakfast place with your family? I know I have! Sometimes I am in mood for chocolatey pancakes and crepes and the folks want piping hot kachoris! Well, Fork and Knife on West Range, Park Circus is about to change the way you see breakfasts!
                                                                ...

An Extravaganza of Mouthwatering Vegetarian Food at Fork & Knife!

The name itself is simple and to the point. All you need to dine in this place is a fork and a knife (or may be a spoon if you are a perfectionist). The place is a no-frill one, poses no unnecessary ambiance junkets, offers no modern d√©cor, but focuses on plain and flavorful food, which is sure to touch the very core of your heart. Located near Park Circus and bang opposite Mocha, the restaurant has been developed under the parent wing of Hotel Orion, and is portraying itself as a pure vegetarian conclave. The cuisines available here are vast and enormous, and gives you enough options to ponder from one end of the world to the other. A special mention to the menu card here, which has been specially designed by way of laser cutting it, to give it a special look, touch and feel.
            

We were cordially invited here for a brief food tasting event. The list of the dishes and drinks tried are as follows:

1. Virgin Mojito: A lovely concoction of mint, lemon wedges and soda, with chunks of ice. The drink was strong, fizzy and had a wonderful blend of mint and lemon. If I have to be short and precise, this is the best Virgin Mojito I have ever tried till date.
                                          ...

Fork & Knife is a pure vegetarian restaurant specializing in innovative and creative dishes. Their dishes are made with a lot of love and thought, and every dish has a delicious twist to it. We started off with the Mocktails, among which the Ginger Rock Salt is a winner. With just a hint of ginger, this has a kala khatta taste to it which makes it an absolute delight. Among the starters, our favourites were the Chote Bhutte ki Chaat, a chaat made with babycorn and the Hara Bhara Kebab, a kebab made with peas and dhania, wrapped with flattened rice or chidwa. The Chilli Cheese Sticks are also very good and would be a cheese lover‚Äôs favourite! In the main course, we had Masala Kulcha with Paneer Do Pyaza and Garlic Naan with Mixed Veg. The breads were soft and perfect with just a bit of crunch without being too hard. They didn‚Äôt feel heavy and all..just right! No meal is complete without a dessert and here, we had their Monte Carlo, which is rich dark chocolate layered with smooth fresh cream. We loved it so much, we each had one more! 

Good pure vegetarian restaurants are hard to find but this place shows a lot of promise. It is a place everyone must visit for some lip-smackingly good food!

Tasting Invitation @ Fork & Knife - Hotel Orion West Willows, Kolkata, India ‚ò∫

Situated in the lane adjacent to Tata Lexus Motors (Karnani Estate), in the lane parallel to The Conclave, Fork & Knife is like an oasis of vegetarian food in the hard core and popular non vegetarian desert of Kolkata, i.e. the Park Circus Area.

The recently opened 40 seater pure veg restaurant aims at serving the ever increasing brigade of vegetarian enthusiasts, specially the office goers of the busy neighborhood, who are always on the lookout of a frill-free comfort meal, with decent presentation and relatively economic pricing.

The menu set is well designed and comprises of, most of the usual cuisines and dishes, that are preferred and actually ordered by the vegetarian community. Of course, a couple of simple but unusual preparations are also added, so as to, keep the menu interesting.

The listed cuisines are - North Indian, South Indian, Chinese, Italian and Continental. Fixed meals or 'thalis' are available in the Chinese and both of the Indian cuisines. An array of 'Chaats' are also available!

The following food items were presented for tasting -

Mocktails -

Virgin Mojito: Topped with fresh mint leaves, and infused with lime slices, it served as the great ice breaker and conversation starter.

Ginger Rock Salt: This transparent ginger and soda based drink, with brownish hue at top and bottom, looked quite interesting. It was served with the Indian main course. The presence of rock salt in it, gave it a 'kala-khatta' type taste, which really helped in pushing down the buttery and creamy Indian Cuisine.

Starters -

Khasta Kabab: Six crispy tear shaped kebabs were served with green chutney. They were made of - rice, hung curd, cheese and curry patta. They tasted nice and different. The crispiness was just perfect.

Paneer Tikka: Six big marinated and chargrilled chunks of cottage cheese (paneer) were served in a linear fashion, divided by thin slices of colored bell peppers and onion. The accompaniments were - a side salad and green chutney. They tasted nice.

DahiChilla: It consisted of a hot rawa/suji roll, filled with a cold hung curd mixture. The roll was divided into four equal portions, and served amidst a generous ring-like sprinkling of potato bhujiya. The roll in itself, looked like a mini dosa. This was again a new delicacy, with a different taste.

Chota Bhutta Ki Chaat: It was a typical Indian Chaat, topped with curd, tamarind chutney, coriander leaves, sev and spices. Only difference was in the main body composition, which was made of fried babycorn, and not the usual potato and flour dough concoctions. It was quite spicy, and tasted nice.

Main course -

Daal Bukhara: This was the staple creamy black dal, and it was expectantly nice.

Aloo Do Pyaza: This popular potato onion curry, topped with a generous serving of fried onions and coriander leaves, tasted very nice.

Malai Kofta: Four super soft cottage cheese dumplings were served in a bowl full of rich creamy gravy. They tasted very nice. They were the kind that, no one can eat just one!

Butter Naan: It was nice, soft, fluffy and completely eggless! Portion was quite large.

Lachhedar Tawa Paratha: This layered paratha was also eggless, well made, and of relatively bigger proportion.

Desserts -

Darsaan: Darsaan is a popular Chinese dessert made with fried wonton noodles, which are drizzled with honey and sesame seeds. It's served with a scoop of Vanilla ice-cream. As expected, it was sticky and nice.

Seasonal Fruit Mousse: It was a cup of white creamy mousse, topped with colorful and glazed fruit slices, like - kiwi, pineapple, cherry etc. I was too full to taste it. But, it looked quite nice.

Chocolate Monte Carlo: Eight hexagonal shot glasses of this choclatey dessert with beautiful hand fan like 3D chocolate topping, were gifted as a take away. These were consumed at home. They tasted fantastic!

The crockery was white ceramic, albeit in interesting shapes, except for the bowls, in which both the Indian breads were served. These bowls and the cutleries were made of stainless steel. Glasses were usual transparent white.

Starting from the owners, managers, chef, to the serving staff, everybody displayed a great sense of hospitality and urge to excel in service. Undoubtedly, the service was great, and the conversation was better.

All in all, it was a wonderful pure vegetarian comfort meal, with a couple of new starter dishes, that made the meal, even more interesting.

Pricing:

A usual Indian meal for two, comprising of one soup, one starter, a couple of sabjis, and a couple of breads, would cost you around Rs. 800/-.

Note: They do reserve a part of the restaurant for kitty parties and other get togethers.

Alternatively, you can book their banquet hall, Cedar, which can accommodate around 75 people.

‚ÄãPark Circus is a place which is generally considered to be den for non-vegetarians with dozens of North Indian eateries. But when it comes to finding a pure veg restaurant in the vicinity, the search fails. However, this won‚Äôt be an issue any more as Fork & Knife has finally opened its doors to the public.

If one thing that is common in people of Bengal about food, it‚Äôs got to be our love for non veg. Even a recent survey confirmed the stats where this region actually surpassed the average non veg consumption of northern India. So it‚Äôs not very hard to wonder why it‚Äôs so difficult to find a decent vegetarian eatery in the city. I‚Äôm not saying the city doesn‚Äôt have them. Sure there are quite a lot of options ( Park Street even got¬†Hakuna Matata which serves great cocktail along with mouth-watering food). However once you narrow down your preferred search location, numbers fall drastically. Even South Indian dosas haven‚Äôt been spared in the city & have been given a non veg makeover ( Dosa@Twist actually serves great chicken & cheese dosas). Now Park Circus area is highly known for its Mughlai restaurants. The likes of Arsalan, Zeeshan reign the food scene. Ask for a veggie friendly outlet, people will be highly bemused. Not any more though! Hotel Orion, West Willows has recently opened the doors to its in-house restaurant ‚ÄòFork & Knife‚Äô to the general public. Situated in the lane of ‚ÄòMocha‚Äô, this outlet is situated bang opposite the ‚ÄòFirefly‚Äô lounge. The hotel is a 3 star property falling in the business class segment. The owner Mr. Amit Bajoria came up with the idea of veg only dining keeping in mind the lack of this type of eateries in the vicinity. Not only local, the restaurant with its quality food attempts to make a spot in the food map of Kolkata. Mr. Bajoria recently invited our group to try out the dishes they are serving right now. The menu is quite extensive, & rather being confused by it we settled for items they wanted us to taste.

Situated in the lane of ‚ÄòMocha‚Äô, this outlet is situated bang opposite the ‚ÄòFirefly‚Äô lounge. The hotel is a 3 star property falling in the business class segment. The owner Mr. Amit Bajoria came up with the idea of veg only dining keeping in mind the lack of this type of eateries in the vicinity. Not only local, the restaurant with its quality food attempts to make a spot in the food map of Kolkata. Mr. Bajoria recently invited our group to try out the dishes they are serving right now. The menu is quite extensive, & rather being confused by it we settled for items they wanted us to taste.

Today in this age of specialization, most of the restaurants which are opening up around us, have a specific theme or a cuisine they focus on. So most of our plans now are like, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go for an Italian dinner‚Äù or ‚ÄúOh! We must try the new Chinese place‚Äù. And though I love cuisine based, or theme based eateries, I sometimes miss the joy of the ‚ÄòMulti-cuisine Restaurant‚Äô meals.

Few things can match up to a combination of Roomali Roti and Chilli Paneer. And few meals can be better than one which starts with a clear soup and kebabs, progresses with pastas and ends with warm, sticky darsaan with a dollop of ice-cream over it!

The moment I entered Fork & Knife, the first thought that came to my mind was that, I would love to come here for a family dinner. The teens will be happy with their sodas and pastas; the cool, young, newly turned vegan lady will find solace in the idlis and dosas; the health-conscious friends can happily have their clear soups and salads;  while I will gorge on some gorgeous naans with daal-makhni and paneer do-pyaza!

My meal here started with the Chhote Bhutte ka Chaat, which is such a pleasant change from the done-to-death crispy baby-corns, the Cheese Chilli Cigars, with hot, molten cheese oozing out with eat bite, and a very refreshing Mojito. There was a slight inconsistency in the coating of one of the cigars, but to be fair, I picked up another one which was fine and I loved the hit of green chillies with the gooey cheese.

Then came the Khasta Kebabs, one of my favourite things that evening, which were a desi version of the aranchini. To me, it tasted like cheesy, curd rice balls, in a crispy, golden encasing and I loved it! The Stuffed Aloo, with copious amounts of dry fruits and raisins in the stuffing was a close contender, but the Khasta Kebabs won my vote.

For mains, we started with some basic flat breads and a gorgeous Paneer Do-Pyaza. The velvety gravy, the soft cottage-cheese squares, and those caramelized onions sprinkled on top came together beautifully. The Dal Makhni could have been a little less runny, but wasn‚Äôt bad.

As the hosts insisted on having the Vegetable Biriyani, which comes with a katori of raita, I blessed the Ginger Rock-Salt Mocktail for washing it all down. And yes, speaking about the Vegetable Biriyani, though it had a strong smell of the keora essence, which one may or may not like, I really liked the way it tasted.

Finally when it was time for desserts, I was struggling to put another morsel in my mouth. Even then I tried both the Monte-Carlo and the Darsaan. The desserts here not only taste great, but are surprisingly pocket-friendly too. Well, in fact, their entire menu has been designed with a very moderate pricing.

It‚Äôs not very often that I am impressed by a vegetarian meal, but the one at Fork & Knife was a satisfying one, indeed!

A pure vegetarian restaurant right in the heart of the city which serves delicious food without burning a hole in your pocket. Attached to the new hotel right opposite mocha, this restaurant speaks volume through delicious food. 
Very courteous service and well informed staffs greet you on entering and guide you through. 
The interiors are simple yet tasteful and I would call it a place you could where you could dine in peace. 
I was invited by Mr.amit who is a co-owner of the hotel and has put his heart into establishing the restaurant,a gentleman who's passion about food reflects while he talks, he designed the menu himself and the hand crafted wooden menu of fork and knife stands out! 
Coming to the food we loved everything we eat, it was difficult for me to take out faults in anything. 
Chili cheese cigars-stingy cheese fries like a spring roll, spicy yet yummy!! 
Paneer tikka-full cream paneer, grilled to perfection withe right amount of spices. 
Delhi Ka chaat-made with crispy Palak leaves, this unique item was a delight. 
Butter naan-perfect naans(they make them without egg,which is a concern for many)
Shyam savera-spinach balls stuffed with paneer in a rich red gravy, it was exceptional!! 
Jodhpuri aloo-potato stuffed with a mixture of dry fruits and veggies in a creamy gravy, the sweetness of the potato was balanced with the gravy!
Dal Bukhara-one of the best black daal I've had in the city, you have to have it to believe it. 
Jeera rice-the idle comfort food jeera rice,aromatic and just the way it should be!
The Virgin Mojito was delight to the taste buds, refreshing and very well made. 
We ended out meal with the Malpua with Rabri which stole my heart, the consistency of the Rabri over a perfect Malpua was such a pleasure.
I left promising to come back again with my family, a total value for many restaurant which is perfect for dining in with family.
Ps:-They serve continental,Chinese and South Indian as well.
