This one is a hidden gem, situated near lalbazar bentick street, this is a non ac chinese eatery, with sitting available, but only plastic stools. But the food served is really tasty, and as per the prices charged. Service is also relatively fast, can be tried out is you are a regular in this area and looking for decent chinese food, without much of the ambience or sitting. I tried the mixed chowmein with chilly roasted pork and it was good!

Small restaurant in Bentinck street with not more than 20 seats. The guy at the counter is very friendly, always smiling and says that his ancestors were from China. Nothing much of an ambience. But the food was good and cheap. They serve both half and full portions. We had chicken lung fung soup (recommended by the guy at the counter). Nothing great, infact I did not like the flavor. But the mixed noodles and chilli roast pork made up for it. Pork was too good, roasted absolutely to perfection. Overall, cheap and good food.

I bet hardly people know about this place..
this could have been a perfect example of one of the "Hidden Gems" of Kolkata..
located on Bentinck St., very near to Lalbazar..

small outlet, some 2 n 4 seater old wooden tables, but nicely maintained..
only two staffs.. one Cook inside.. & one Smiling faced Chinese guy (not sure whether he is Chinese or not) who is managing the counter, taking orders as well as serving single handedly with a polite and happy gesture.. his behavior could make your experience better..

foods are good.. they serve a adequate quantity according to the price..
yes, this place is very pocket friendly.. in fact they serve Half Portions also, for dine and take away both..

overall..
Good budget place for good chinese items..

Don't judge a book by it's cover is how I can sum up this place. Located at Bentiq Street, this place serves authentic Chinese. Even above the food is the service, the owner himself takes care of all guests very politely. On multiple visits tried a hakka noodles which was thick filling and full of veggies, a small plate is enough for lunch.

Tried a gravy noodle, don't like the dish in general but liked the fact that it had fried noodle along with boiled noodles in the soup. The crispy babycron is not what you are used to generally in cafes, its made in proper Chinnese sause.

Loved the fried rice here, a perfect main course with any side dish. Tried a fried wanton for the first time, liked it, the fillings was very good, wished the fillings weren't so little.

The full five review is not just because of the delicious roast pork plum sauce, steamed rice with pork. But also for the gentleman who came himself to make the delivery. The very soul of courtesy. 
Food tempered with politeness. The most unbeatable combination. 
I shall trouble him again and again to come and give me some of the nicest pork dishes, at the most reasonable price.

This little place tucked in a corner of bentick street very near to lalbazar police station on b.b. ganguly street serves some perfectly traditional home made chinese food which comes from the very roots of china. This is being run & managed by a chinese family.

This is a 16 seater place with adequate hygiene & cleanliness being maintained. The menu is short & concise with basic chinese items. The heat maybe a problem due to shortage of wall papers since they only use stand fans. Anyways coming to the food we took the following:-

1. Fry spring chicken - 8 pcs of shallow fried battered chicken served with tomato sauce. The chicken bites were too juicy & tender. The batter didn't overpower the flavour of the chicken. It was too tasty.

2. Chicken schezwan chowmein - We took 1 plate of it being divided in 2. The quantity for 1 whole plate is very decent for 1 person. The chowmein was not overpowered with too much of schezwan sauce,it was rather light yet very subtle to our tastebuds. The vegetables & chicken shreds were in generous proportions. This also made our tastebuds happy.

3. Roast chilli pork - This was the star of our meal. Thinly shredded pork pieces in onions,capsicums & chillies. The pork was perfectly roasted i.e. neither too soft nor too rubbery. Pork fats were barely there which might be liked by non pork fat eaters. Quantity was very good in my opinion. Recommended dish.

4. Hunan chicken - We took half plate of it. This dish had shredded chicken in hunan sauce with ample spring onions & garlic. The dish was fantastic to be honest. The gravy was a tad watery but could be ignored.

The pocket pinch is very less. All the above items cost us about 445 in total with no extra taxes being charged. The service is good & the food is served in no time. Try this place if you are looking for authentic home like chinese preparations.

This place is a hidden gem for authentic chinese lovers. Especially their roasted chili pork is just lip smacking. Quantity and quality of food served is good. We ordered pork chow, chicken chow, chicken fried rice for main course and roasted chili pork, szechwan chicken as side dishes. Roasted pork was truly amazing. Although i did not like the chicken dish. This is the best low budget price among all other chinese restaurants in lal bazar area. Go and enjoy! Bon appetite â˜º

Most importantly the food is cheap and not so bad for health. The limited use or no use of msg is a big plus point in Hakka Wok. I had a bowl of manchow soup, a plate of mixed hakka chow and a bowl of chilli roast pork. The service is good and warm. The amount is quite fair in compared to what they are charging. If you visit this food joint do try pork.

It was situated near Lal bazar Police Station in front of Krishna Chambers and besides hero cycle shop. Serves Chinese Cuisine in pocket friendly price. Small restaurant where easily 14 to 16 people can sit. Ambience was really good. Chinese themed restaurant operated by north indian family. Giving the feel of old indo-chinese restaurant. Hospitality was very impressive I totally loved it. Service was very good. North indian guy with always smiling face serving the food. He was so humble and friendly. Presentation was also very nice. I tried veg fried wanton they were crunchy, spicy and very tasty in taste served with tangy and spicy red chilly watery hot sauce. And I also tried their veg Szechwan hakka chow which was full of veggies, spicy and very tasty noodles. It was must visit place. Personal favorite. Recommended to all. Loved it totally.

An excellent place for pocket friendly old-Chinatown style food. This is not is Esplanade though. The place is near to Lalbazar. From the Chitpur - Lalbazar crossing keep moving towards Ganesh Chandra Avenue and the eatery will be on your right after a walk of 2 mins. The place is very small and there are no proper chairs with backrest. Only stools. But the food and service is excellent.

The first thing I liked here is their menu. All the sides are served as half and full plates (4 and 8 pieces respectively). When you are alone or want to try several sides, this system helps a lot. Price is super cheap. Amount served is also good. And above everything they taste awesome.

I have seen several big Chinese restaurants where most dishes taste the same. Here the dishes might look alike (same colour of sauce), but all taste different.

The steamed rice and gravy chow here are our favourite. The gravies have less cornstarch and is more watery than other restaurants. But the flavours are spot on. Prawn and Pork sides are great. Hunan and Mongolian fish were great.

The only thing we didn't like here was the Wonton soup. The wonton filling was great, but the wrapper was too thick and sticky.Â  Everything else we tried were great.

Service here is really friendly and fast. They even customise according to you. Must visit place if you like old-Chinatown style food.

The pork dishes are the best here. The rice dishes that I tried was really delicious. The owners are very welcoming and hospitable. Considering the fact that there are few places that still serve pork. This place has become our favorite hangout.

Pocket friendly small counter. Chinese delight in such a reasonable price really astonishing. Simple decoration  and seating  arrangements. Quick service. Feel the authentic touch. Veggies nd chicken both was fresh (despite the low range).. rice portion was tastey but a little thick. Same for noodles. They  fried the noodles first then mix it with gravy in case of Cantonese chow. Hunan chicken is not too good and not bad as well. Chicken  portion could have been better in every dish. But Its  damn cheap man.. highly recommend  for the college  goers. Little pleasure with little pocket money  really  worth a visit

First of all its not at esplanade, its in Bentinck street. Now coming to the ambiance, its a small cozy joint with few seats. Well the food is ok typ. We order spring chicken which was tasty, the rice and noodles are good, the chilli chicken was ok, but the chilli pork is a bit under cooked i found... its not that soft what i expected,. The person who was serving the food was really well behaved and informative... and yes the quantity is huge..

I saw it by chance when I was going down Bentinck Street. A small Chinese restaurant with beautiful Chinese decorations. The owner is a smiling Chinese who ushered me in and switched on the fan. I chose Hakka mixed chow and he suggested Mongolian chicken as it would be spicy. It did not take much time. The chow was ok but being a lover of chillies, I made the mistake of pouring green chilly with vinegar. It smelt awful and spoilt the taste of the chow. Mongolian chicken is good to taste and to look, but not spicy, in fact it tasted like sweet and sour chicken.
Anyway I could not finish off, mainly due to the fact that the chillies spoilt the taste of the food. And the amount being huge, I soon had my belly full. So I had to return 1/4 th portion.
