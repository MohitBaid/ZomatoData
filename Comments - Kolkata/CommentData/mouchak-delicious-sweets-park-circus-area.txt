বসার জায়গা না থাকলেও মানা যায় , কিন্তু মান ঝুলে গেলে খারাপ লাগে । এবং সেদিক থেকে দাম বেশ খানিকটা অতিরিক্ত বলেই বোধ হয় । মিষ্টি দই আর জলভরা সন্দেশ চলতে পারে ।

Khir kodom.. the kheer covering with a syrupy sweet inside it probably ranks high amidst its offerings. The place's location is quite hard to spot though.

A bit unhygienic surrounding to my liking, the quality here has deteriorated. The Mishti Doi is the only item which still tastes good. The Roshogolla and the sandesh were hardly any good, and did not match the price. Highly disappointed.

At one time this mishti shop used to be quite good but with the years it has lost its sheen( sweetness)!! They do not have too many varieties in their sweets and in this age of new fangled sweets they still stick to the tried and tested traditional sweets. Moreover their prices are quite high for the kind of sweets they have. But in summer love to have their mishti doi. ( Right now they also have mango doi). OK. Kind of sweets but price quite high.

I used to visit this place as it is very close to my school. This used to be a very good shop but yes time has taken a toll on this. It has deteriorated from then. I used to love their rosogolla and chenna misti
