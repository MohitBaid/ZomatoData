A nice and pocket-friendly junction at behala tramdepot offering delicious dishes.. I have been there regular customer and tried many dishes.. They offer yummie rolls and biriyanis.. The chinese is also good.. The kababs are tasty too.. The ambience is ok ok.. The service is moderate.. But the quantity and quality of food they offer are appreciable.. All in all a nice junction to enjoy good food at reasonable price..

Famous for rolls (Chicken, Mutton, Egg-Chicken etc) and also for biryani. But I don't think their biryani is that good compared to other popular restaurants (Arsalan, Aminia) in Behala. Taste of the Biryani's  rice is good but the meats they serve with biryani is very bad, not cooked properly and too much fibre in it.

Haji's roll is itself a brand. There are many people who don't like to try rolls elsewhere once they try in haji. We have been having haji's roll since childhood. It's love. They specialize in Indian and tandoor dishes. Try their biriyani. It's a bit spicy and heavy but very tasty. Location is a very big advantage for them. Its worth a try.
Thank you

We ordered food in from this place for lunch via Zomato. We had ordered Rumali roti and the Haji Special Mutton Keema. The taste of the food was very good, but the packaging of one of the containers had an oil spill. Also, the food was delivered 30 min later than what was shown on Zomato after ordering. We look forward to ordering more from them in the future.

One can have a meal if you take a double egg and double chicken roll. One negative is that it is too crowded but that‚Äôs because the place is so very famous

A bit of a disappointment, frankly.¬† Their signature dish - the mutton keema - is really diced, rather than ground, mutton, and overly spiced.¬† The chicken tandoori was very average.¬† Had expected much better from the 3.7 rating.

One of the best Mughlai Restaurants out here in the city of joy, originally located at the heart of Behala, but now has a second one at Park Circus, just below the fly over. The Behala one is good for takeaway, dining is a bit mediocre, but the Park Circus one is really very good, with its mughlai ambience and the smell of Biryani you will just love it. Some of the must tries here are - Chicken Biryani(OBVIOUSLY), Mutton Tikiya(Best thing ever), Rolls, Chicken Chaamp.
After you've destroyed your diet by eating all those, treat yourself with their Phirni, your meal will be just awesome. I know the restaurant since my childhood, and ever since I didn't have had a bad stomach after eating here! Cheers to Haji Saheb!

Want the best place to have rolls?  Haji saheb is the right place. I've tried their each and every rolls are AMAZING. 

Now what about BIRIYANI? Well let me tell you a story. Once there was this friend who was having her birthday at her home and had invited me and other friends over. She had ordered biriyani from Haji and after we had the bite of the rice as well as the meat, we knew that we would NEVER order biriyani from haji. Neither the rice nor the meat had any flavour. Even the friend who was regretting the decision of ordering biriyani from Haji.

Their rolls have always been my favorite and it will always leave me craving for more. The Biryani and Chicken Chap are nice options too. 
Delivery is prompt. Quality-Thumbs up!

This place is situated at just opposite of the Behala Tram Depot bus stand.
Quite a little restaurant it is. The prices are convincing and services are quite good too. They have seating arrangement too but can't comment as the times I went there had food eaten outside the place as those two times were sudden plan from college.
Had only one thing. I heard a lot about this roll before so finally went to grab one. It was the Mutton Tikia Roll. And the roll was Holy Moly!! I mean at the time I headed at this place I wasn't a mutton fan but after eating that Mutton Tikia Roll my love for mutton started. It was tremendously delicious, flavourful and quite aromatic. One of the best rolls I ever had. Looking forward to again have the roll as soon as possible.

Best Rolls in the planet. Egg, Chicken, Mutton, Tikia everything is amazing because of their heavenly lachcha paratha. The paratha which is 10/- a piece is itself so tasty you can have it without a side. 
The other great thing here is hariyali and reshmi kababs. The tandoori would have been better if there was some more meat on the bones.
Haji makes good enough north Indian , sometimes the biriyani is a little off in taste but they still remain Behala's favourite take away. Oil is however a factor. 
They also serve delicious Haleem during Ramzan. 
Chinese is okay but not their fort√©.

This outlet is one of those places in south Kolkata which is  famous for Biryani and Mughlai cuisine.
My recent visit to this place although was not so pleasurable.


We tasted Mutton special Biryani and chicken reshmi butter masala along with tandoori roti.
‚Ä¢Tandoori Roti:It was cold when served.Obviously on the harder side.
‚Ä¢Chicken reshmi butter masala:This dish consists of 6 big portions of chicken reshmi kabab cooked in a yogurt,cashew paste and butter based gravy.The chicken pieces itself tasted good.Soft and succulent.But the gravy was utterly disgusting.Absolutely tasteless.
‚Ä¢Special Mutton Biriyani:It consists of two big pieces of mutton ,one egg and one potato along with Flavoured rice.Quality of rice was  good.Mutton pieces were perfectly cooked .This dish tasted very delicious.But being a critic of Biriyani this was certainly not on excellent side.I can say its more on above average type.
Conclusion:-
Staffs:Well behaved.4.5/5
Service:Very quick.5/5
Food:3/5
Quantity:3/5.
Price:The menu  shown in zomato is not updated by the restaurant.The prices are gone up by Rs.20-40 each item.They also charge  18% Gst .
Value for money:3/5

Very easily discernable landmark of Behala Tram Depot, mostly for the mughlai cuisine.

The amount of food served is huge and astounding for the price compared to other restaurants in the city, and no matter what the quality or quantity of the Biryani has never fallen an inch.

Pocket friendly and eat to your heart's content, but only if the serving time and the variety of dishes were better..

Mutton biryani is the go-to dish here...Pair it with kebabs, chaap and firni or anything you desire..

My friends and members of the extended family who live in Behala have been staunch advocates of the biryani from Haji Saheb for close to two decades. A cousin who stayed near Ajanta cinema used to order Chicken biryani many a times when we visited their place. My uncle who lives in Thakurpukur too ordered the same to celebrate his silver wedding anniversary. However, I have never found the biryani to be exceptional....in fact it was too dry for my palate. Once I even tasted their Chicken chaap, it too was nothing memorable.

This place is common to every people in behala and it is perhaps the first of it's kind here. Once you enter you could see two distinct counters onr for rolls and other where biriyani take-aways are delivered. Nothing special to mention about their rolls but they are good undoubtedly. But their biriyani to my surprise is the best because of the texture of the rice, it's aroma and a large chunk of meat makes it even more droolworthy. They serve a decent variety of side dishes too. So you can mix n match and try them out. They also come with dine-in facility for the diners. This place will never upset your biriyani cravings. Thank you!

Small restaurant in Behala Tram depot....food quality and quantity was awesome. Love their Special Biriyani and mutton bharta very much. As it is very near to my place I often ordered food from there.

Quality of biryani is undoubtedly excellent but takes time to serve and ambiance is average. Cleanliness is a big factor to attract customers but it lacks so much in this regard.

Their service is late but I didn't like the ambiance at all. The place is very clumsy and at times I felt a bit dirty too. Talking about the food, the food was great but the phirni was not fresh. They really need to work on their decor, service and ambiance.

the place is small, and the quality declined.. the biriyani is also not that it used to be earlier.. the roll counters are overcrowded, popular enough to the shopper-hoppers of behala market for quick snacks.
                    i always say, man don't compromise with food quality.

You are special for your rolls and biriyani. One can imagine your popularity just by the queue for biriyani outside your outlet. Just awesome

Am not a fan of rolls, unless it's at Haji. The quintessential addition of lemon juice to the satisfying amount of chicken as stuffed, with onions only is their trump card. A place to go, if you want both your stomach and pocket to be happy. :)

One of the oldest signature restaurants in Behala. Try out the rolls because they're probably the best in Kolkata. Specifically the egg chicken roll. Not to mention the spellbounding Biriyani. Just the right quantity and just the right taste. Compared to the roll counters and take aways, the main restaurant is quite empty. Service is prompt and staff are nice. 7/10 on ambience. Try out the common mughlai dishes. And ofcourse the Biriyani which i'd give a 10/10.

Though we had expected crowd, we were surprised to see a mostly empty restaurant. Since biriyani is famous in Haji, we ordered Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Chap, chicken Rezala, butter nun, tandoori roti. The mutton biriyani lived up to it's expectations though the aloo was a bit salty. It was tasty and greasy. The amount of Biriyani was handsome. I couldn't move The Chicken Chap, though it had a thick layer of oil, tasted delicious. The butter nun was not that soft. More or less it was a pleasing lunch. They charged GST tax. The menu card has not been updated with the new prices inclusive of GST tax.

Countless memories back here during my school days. Last Friday decided to check in once again. The best part of this place is that nothing has changed only the prices :p.. 10 years back the place was almost the same. No need to review their food

One of the worst experience that i have ever had in a restaurant.......the quality of the food was not at all good....paneer in 'paneer butter masala' felt like i am chewing soya bean, it was stale and not fresh......tandoori roti they served was half baked...even lachha parantha was not good.....not at all recommended from my side...

Try the Biriyani. It is the best I have tested so far. Far Better than Arsalaan. Award winning Biriyani. My favorite dish is Biriyani and have tried every renowned restaurant in kolkata.

The best place to have rolls.. I must say.. They r still delectable.. The rolls r still of the same quality frm the days I started havin rolls mayb 20 odd years ago.. But they r nowhere their best in biriyanis now a days.. We went there yesterday only nd ordered mutton biriyani, panner butter masala, tandoori roti, chicken bharta.. The quality nd quantity of biriyani ws good bt nt wt they werr earlier.. paneer butter masala ws also good both quality nd quantity wise.. tandoori roti ws a bit let down nd so ws their chicken bharta.. it ws shredded big chunks of chicken nt mashed or gooey or creamy like.. So I might nt recommand dt to anyone.. Apart frm dt the staff members werr polite nd decent.. will be visiting again... Cheers!!

The best place to have rolls.. I must say.. They r still delectable.. The rolls r still of the same quality frm the days I started havin rolls mayb 20 odd years ago.. But they r nowhere their best in biriyanis now a days.. We went there yesterday only nd ordered mutton biriyani, panner butter masala, tandoori roti, chicken bharta.. The quality nd quantity of biriyani ws good bt nt wt they werr earlier.. paneer butter masala ws also good both quality nd quantity wise.. tandoori roti ws a bit let down nd so ws their chicken bharta.. it ws shredded big chunks of chicken nt mashed or gooey or creamy like.. So I might nt recommand dt to anyone.. Apart frm dt the staff members werr polite nd decent.. will be visiting again... Cheers!!

Located at a 5-minute walk from Behala P.S.,Haji Saheb is known for its Biriyani and its Rolls.
The pieces of Chicken/Mutton in the Biriyani may sometimes have too much bone and less of meat.Despite that,the taste of the Biriyani is good. 
The rolls are also worth a try.
The place can be crowded but they have an air-conditioned section upstairs.
Also,pocket pinch is less for the quality of food.

From its rolls to biriyani, this is an absolutely delightful place to stop and munch something. The price is pretty moderate as well. While it's difficult to get a place to sit given the amount of crowd that throngs the place, trust me you won't mind the delay. Recommended items: Chicken roll, Mutton roll, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Biriyani (Chicken/Mutton)

One of the best in Kolkata for rolls at pocket friendly price . All the rolls are just yummy.
A special Tikia Roll at 35 bucks is awesome
Though its roll centre is a take away counter it also has a sitting facility upstairs where I can get variety of Chinese , tandoors, north Indians.
Located at the clumsy, congested market....
Don't forget to taste the firni......

I've never sat and had a meal at Haji Saheb. I have only had rolls for takeaway from here so I'll be reviewing them based on this criteria only.
Probably they sell the most number of rolls in a minute during their peak hours. The rolls are hearty and very filling and I'd generally go for all the veraiations and types of the meat ones. Their rolls are one of the most ideal kinds in this city and I make it a point to visit them at least once whenever I'm in or around Behala.

Nice place for having Mughlai dishes. The prices are pocket friendly and specially the biryani which is aromatic spicy rice with soft meat pieces. Located at Behala tram depo which is not too far from our residence where I'm carving from my childhood. Don't forget to try their rolls which are served only at the ground floor.

This place is synonymous with biriyani. Specially for the residents of Behala. Mouth watering Mughlai delicacies. The food is cheap. Their mutton roll is something that could fill you up completely. They have made seating arrangement in two different levels upstairs and also tried to serve as a multi cuisine restaurant but if you are at haji Mughlai is the way to go...

Haji is very famous around Behala. I had chicken and egg rolls. The take-away counter is always crowded. The rolls taste good. Pocket friendly. Oppo behala tram depo. Because they use 'Dalda' to make the rolls you gotta eat fast in the winters or there will be the the weirdness in the back of your throat. If you go shopping in behala Haji saheb is must go shop.

Although this restaurant in Behala is famous for its biriyani and rolls,chinese food served here is equally good.Prices are also reasonable.
The biriyani and chicken chap is too good.
The mutton and chicken rolls are simply yum.But the the roll section is too much crowded most of the times.But the wait is totally worth it.
The hakka noodles and chilly chicken are yummylicious.
Ambience is okay.Friendly staff.

Be it eggroll, chicken roll, mutton roll, tikia roll, all of them are just perfect. And the biryanis! One of the very best that Kolkata has to offer. If you are in tram depot area in behala, don't forget to visit haji saheb. :)

I've always taken pride over the fact that Behala has the best parathas in the city and that pride comes directly from this place. Lachha parathas from Haji is beyond doubt one of the best in city as well being extremely cheap. Their kababs and briyiani also stand out.

The one thing which you must try at haji saheb is their biriyani. Tasteful and worth every penny. 
The restaurant decor is a bit shabby and they had refused us the special biriyani.

A nice place to visit. And I do visit frequently. Had various dishes and I would mention Chicken Biryani , Haji special, Noodles. And you definitely should visit this place for rolls. It is renowned for its rolls(Tikia roll being my fav) and on any evening you would find a crowded roll counter. Definitely worth a visit specially if you are from or around Behala.

I was a regular customer of haji aheb. But that was a long time ago. It has deteriorated recently. Why i don't know. But the biryani doesnt taste good. The masalas r missing. The tandoors r too burnt. N the mughlai side dishes smell n feel all same. Its future is uncertain

The food quality is superb. Specially the biriyani. This place is one of the oldest and most renowned eating hub in behala. Rolls are specialty of this place, tikia role being my. favorite. However if you're health conscious and count your calorie intake,, this is not the place for you since the food is extremely rich .

This place is one of the renowned places in Behala for their Biryani. I heard so much from my Behala residing relatives that I thought of paying a visit to this place once. That too was pretty long back. The biryani was pretty average, not worth hogging over. Okay for trying once. Didn't try other dishes, so can't comment.

Another good place in Behala to eat to your heart's content!
This place is supposed to deliver one of the best rolls in the entire city. They are big and deliciously mouth watering.

Haji Saheb is famous for it's Indian dishes. The Kebabs are big in size and come at around 190bucks for 6 pieces. A plate is more than enough for one person.

You MIGHT be asked to share tables at peak hours or occasions so be prepared for that.

No extra taxes.

Well though they've a variety of mughlai and Chinese dishes lined up what is really good about the place is their rolls. Be it chicken or egg or paneer or tikya. Their rolls are not only tasty but filling too.. A person with normal appetite can even have their dinner with a roll! The lacha paratha used Is thick and extremely tasty. I specially love their paneer roll.!

Grossly overrated place with lard dripping rolls and biryanis. The name is the game here. Better food will be available in stalls.

Haji and Behalans go back decades. They're almost the best thing close to a biriyani I remember from my childhood. 
The rolls are so huge and delicious, it's almost a three course meal in one. 
Something else that really amazed me all my childhood was the way the guy packed the biriyani in the boxes. Like almost juggling with the rice and meat and having them perfectly placed in. 

The 0.5 less is for the bad environment around with dumpsters around and the Uncanny horrible Chinese department they've opened out. 
But that still doesn't keep people from lining up around this place.

Haji Saheb is the place to be if you are a foodist and you stay in Behala. From lip smacking rolls to ravishing biriyanis, Haji Saheb has got it all. The Chicken Biriyanis and Tengri Kababs of Haji Saheb will give you the ultimate satisfaction. If not, then try the Chicken Rolls and the Egg Rolls in the counter downstairs. Absolute heaven for a foodie like me is Haji Saheb!

You will not find a single soul ¬†who resides in behala and has not had rolls from Haji. That in itself says a lot about this joint.They specialize in rolls, in addition have a mughal restaurant next door. Rolls are cost effective and fulfilling on your taste buds.biriyani is a bit oily and heavy. Kebabs are good and their chaanp is not bad.
If you are not from behala this joint is located at the heart of Behala tram depot. On the main road so no point missing the big silver Shiny board over a red background. Drop in have rolls of your specific choice. you wont regret it.

If you are a foodie and you don't mind to gain weight please visit this place as surely you will not be able to stop eating as the menu card is so long that you can not stop yourself ordering and ordering for the next dish. Last time when we visited here we had chicken hariyali kebab, chicken tikka kebab, chicken biriyani and chicken chap. All the foods were awesome. This is a must visit place for everyone. Oh another thing if you love roll do come here because it will help your taste buds to relish the beauty of foods.

Honestly the only thing whats good about this place is biryani. Over crowded and can not accomodate properly if you are with a group. Side dishes like butter chickn, rezala, mutton keema etc taste almost same. If you are a biryani lover then give it a shot. You can be stuffed wel in 500 bucks. Quite cheap.

Behala has this restaurant ever since I have moved here- and that was 12 years ago.
Haji Saheb is pretty easy to spot out- because its just on the opposite side of TramDepo.
I have mostly had had rolls here but this time I wanted to try their food.
The AC restaurant is a small place on the first floor, with 3 tables and a broken AC,but the other one almost makes up for it.
The staff is nice but the service is slow.
Food: The Tandoori Chicken was a bit burnt and you have the Chutney that they had served with the chicken that overrides that burnt taste thankfully.

As for the Chicken Rezala and Rumali Roti,they were okay. The Chicken was shredded in long pieces, were supposed to be softer and not dipped in oil.

And as usual,the Biryani,although warm and spicy,had too much oil.
But both the dishes had the quantity that was more than enough for 2 people.
And we paid Rs.540 for all that.

I would recommend Haji Saheb if you want to have okay food with too much oil, and you dont have much money to spend upon it.

Haji saheb is an awesome restaurant if ur looking for biriyani, rolls, chap, kebabs etc at a cheaper rate (mostly mughlai based items or dishes).. One should definitely taste mutton biriyani, chicken chap, mutton razla, And also I would like to include rolls because they prepare that pretty nicely and it tastes too good.. Haji has been popularly known as one of the best restaurant in behala taratala area for rolls... Mutton, chichen, Tikka, egg chicken rolls etc are few items among rolls which one should taste if they are visiting Haji for the first time.. Kebabs are not like oudh  bt definitely not bad at all.. My personal choice was chicken Rashmi kebab and few varieties of mutton kebab dishes..when it comes to cost factor I wl say it's cheap and worthy enough to spend when compared to the quality of food ur getting. Coming to the quality of place I wl say it's bit overcrowded bt still it's ambience is not worse.. One can go with his or her family for lunch or dinner. Waiters are good and cooperative. Based on these factors I will rate Haji saheb 3.5/5.

The most disappointing food may sometime come from the place one doesn't expect from. So was the case for me over here. I had to rate it 1.5 since it has a very good roll. Apart from that, I felt it was a forgettable experience. ¬†We ordered haji special mutton keema, chicken butter masala and rumali roti. To our surprise, the food coming to our table was cold. All of them. The rumali roti was hard. The warmest thing they gave us was the finger bowl I suppose. The logic behind that given was the A.C had made the food cold. I'll have to find myself that A.C which cools so fast. Anyway, now coming to the food, the chicken butter masala was a disaster. By far the worst I have ever tasted. We couldn't finish it since the chicken was undercooked. We didn't get any explanation for this one. It was so sweet, one can almost mistake it to be a non veg dessert. What an invention. The mutton keema was supposed to be boneless but again it was not. A new variety of keema with bones has arrived. It was not only us, we noticed another group of people leaving with their food half eaten and looking quite aghast. Service made me feel like they are just glad to make people leave in a hurry. This is by far the worst experience in a long time. Go judge for yourself guys. P.S. the rolls are good.

One of my favorite places to have biryani in behala. I think my love for biryani started from this restaurant and still going strong. Love most of their mughlai dishes, the kebabs, the tandoori chicken which I've tried. Ambiance is ok but i prefer take away. My husbands a huge fan of their tikia roll which again never gets old. Haven't tried their chinese dishes much.¬†
I tried haleem for the first time and didn't like it. I think it was extra spicy.
But people new in behala, a must visit place for them.

Been there since my childhood and it WAS always my favourite place for biriyani's. After coming back to Kolkata after some years now, decided to dine there again. To my surprise they have made a dining place besides the existing and quite famous take-away. 
Now coming to the food. The food was disgusting. The first thing that happened was, that I found a hair in the glass of water. Followed by hair in the mutton curry. Then the chicken was not properly cooked and was damn hard. To worsen the thing even more, there was blood inside the chicken flesh. 
Thanks Haji Saheb for wasting my trust and love towards you.

I have been to this place innumerable times. But first time writing any review for this. Firstly I grew up in behala with only available best biriyani from this place. I have something extra nostalgia for this place. This was the food junction which taught about restaurants. So a 5+ rating for this place.
 But on keeping aside the emotional part, the quality of food is good. But the ambience is poor. U must try the rolls from this outlet.

A very well known place very much famous for the biryanis,kebabs side dishes like chicken butter masala,mutton chap.i went there with my fellow foodie around 1 p.m. that time it was almost empty.divided in two parts first floor section very small and the second floor section 30-36 seater,very average interior.located in behala area,before entering there and before start the order i was thinking must be some lovely lip-smacking foods waiting for us.
We ordered there special mutton biriyani,chicken butter masala along with two rumali rotis.
1. Special mutton biryani - first of all rice portion was very average,comes with one portion of potato and egg and two portion of mutton,which was good in size and very soft,too much oil and the flavour was missing.
2. Butter chicken - i found it was good in taste,molten butter over the top of the chicken portion,gravy was thik and flavourful. chicken portion was very soft,but the bad part was it was totally cold when they serve it, need to be warm it a bit before serving.

Overall the service was ok,some of the dishes not available,i was really shocked when they served us the biryani they took it from the downstairs in a small sized box,after that they put it in a plate,quantity not enough what i found.it was just average type experience for me.i hope for the best for my next visit.

Heard a lot about the biriyani of this place before visiting it so decided to visit this place during the pujas. Had to wait to get a table for about 1.5hrs and another 45mins to get the food but the waiting was a worthy one. Biriyani was really good so was the tikka masala. But it's too much spicy and stains of dalda remained in our hand even after washing our hands with soap.

there is a friend of mine, who once told me, don't try the biryanis of this shop. I wondered why though! its quite a known name for the people who actually give a damn about good biryani. later I asked him, why. and as he told, (very truly) the biryanis here are just like Rapunzel, ( probably some of you heard of the story, if you don't, please go through). so, me being the prince in shining armour, had to go through a lot of hurdles, to reach her. and when I did, she greeted me with the soul ravishing aroma and taste, the voluminous satisfaction and the great sense of victory when you defeat the demons of a behala traffic for your love.
love.....that is what I have for my Rapunzel.

There used to be a time when eating out in Behala meant a plate of biryani from Haji Saheb.Or for that matter even a light snack would mean some egg chicken rolls or a tikia rolls from the same place. Even after other eateries opened up, Haji Saheb remained something special. So much so a Behala-ite would proudly keep ‚Äò Haji‚Äôr Biryani ‚Äò in the same league as that of Royal or Aliya. & that too sans that excellent skill displayed by the guy behind the counter. Gone are those days, & gone is the glory of Haji Saheb. Or maybe we got used to food better than their‚Äôs.

If u live in behala then you must have visited this place at least once..this place is the mecca for biriyani lovers! The smell that lingers over the surroundings of this place will surely make your mouth water,but the only problem here is the crowd(You'll know of its popularity when you visit this place by seeing the crowd, and it's all the same in any normal day).

There's ac restaurant above the takeway junction,where you can sit and have your food too,but most people prefer the takeaway,as the food maybe delicious but the restaurant above is not big enough and glamorous. The prices are cheap(really cheap for takeaways) and the quantity and quality is ample. If you're a health conscious person,kindly do not visit this place,as it uses too much oil and dalda and fats to spoil your diet in one single day,for foodies like me,this place is heaven!

This restaurant is excellent for rolls, biriyani, kebabs and chicken chaps. I visited almost 30-40 times and I enjoyed a lot each n every time I visited and tasted their food. Few good points I would like to highlight. Fast service, damn good quality, amazing atmosphere inside the restaurant although it's a bit congested but still doesn't impact much on the ambience, low cost of food with high quality so offcourse low cost high output u can say. Overall I will rate this restaurant as 4/5, and I do feel this restaurant is one of the best in behala taratala circle or area. Thank you.

Last night we ordered for few kebabas and Mutton biryani. ¬†Biryani was good, kebab is portion wise and price was good. Taste can be better if we have in the restaurant I believe. Because though we ordered for parcel it will definitely loose its taste with time. ¬†Please give extra mint chutney because it was nice. we will definitely visit your restaurant for more items to try. ¬†Open a restaurant in Asansol . We badly need ¬†a good Biryani and kebab restaurant.

Well, this place is the best place for roll lovers though I would rate their rolls a bit lower than those served by Panna's kitchen their main rival. Other items are mainly mughlai dishes. Kebabs are very good and well cooked also reasonably priced. They have also opened a restraunt upstairs but service at the restraunt is not upto the mark.

Value for money, renowned in south calcutta, especially Behala area.
Awesome Biriyani, rolls to tickle your taste buds. Biriyani is quite rich in taste and texture. A must visit for any Biriyani lover. 

It has limited seating and hence a 1-1 privacy is not always available, as the seats are meant to accomodate 3-4 people on either sides of the table.

Delicious rolls, good kababs and average biryani. Haji saheb is a very popular North Indian- mughlai restaurant in Behala. They have reasonable prices, but the seating area is tightly packed, always occupied and not at all peaceful. Their egg-chicken roll is my favorite. 
Update 31.05.17 
The last take out order from Haji Saheb left me utterly disappointed. Kababs that are the best part of this place ( and rolls) were undercooked. Rice grains in Biryani were too spicy and hard. And the Tikka butter masala had a dark orange gravy that tasted horrible.

Haji Saheb is synonymous with Behala and it has it's own legacy.Located near the entrance of Behala bazaar ..the place does not boast of the best ambience..as the place is too crowded because of the market place but it serves one of the best rolls in Kolkata..I would suggest you guys to try brain rolls and tikiya roll...Obviously the conventional rolls are also yummy..However their other forte is biriyani..Although they serve Chinese cuisine but it's the roll and the biriyani who hog all the limelight

This place is only very good for its rolls and biriyani. Thats all. Nothin more to say about this place. Located at Behala Tram Depot, this place has got a very ordinary ambience. A lot of improvisation required in case of the ambience. And service is slow too. We have to stand and stand clueless about when our roll would be ready. 
If the service and ambience is improved, this place is sure to attract more customers.

To review this restaurant makes me nostalgic..brings back memories of my teenage days. Though I got introduced to Biriyani by Aminia but this is the place of which we Behala-ites took pride...Haji Biriyani is the best :D

Chicken, Mutton or Special they were (i speak in past tense because their quality has dropped sad but true) too good.

They started with a single counter in Tram Depot, Behala which was a take away counter for Biriyani and Rolls.

Talking about rolls its a vision seeing their staff making around 20 Rolls at a time with varied requirements - Chicken Roll, Mutton Roll, Tikia Roll and the combos like Egg Chicken, Double Egg Chicken...- again some with more onion some with more lemon so on and so forth.

Still I would like to have Haji's Laccha Paratha Rolls than most of the Rolls outlet in Kolkata.

Later they started their sit and dine outlet just a couple of shops later which have both take away and tops floors are sit and dine.

Try out Haji Special as a side dish with their biriyani - its used to be awesome and Firni as dessert.

Chinese is okay-ish.¬†

They also sell variety of kebabs - which is still good as tried last friday - Reshmi Kebab.

I am still rating them 4 Star given the fact that their quality has detoriated due to the memories attached to this outlet

As you will notice many certificates on the walls of this restaurant claiming that they serve the best rolls in the city and rightly so,if you have rolls from this place you are sure to visit it again and again. The joint being very close to my place I am almost like their regular customer. The rolls are just fantastic. They either go on equal terms or are even better than nizam's rolls particularly due to their crispy parathas. I have tried all the possible rolls and I give a 10/10 to each of the rolls except the brain roll which I ain't very fond of(primarily due to the name). The restaurant is also famous for it's biriyani. Both the chicken and mutton biriyanis are excellent. Have tried their butter chicken, chicken rezala,mutton rezala,chicken chap and all of them are extremely spicy and yummy. The kebabs are very deftly made and extremely delicious;especially the hariyali and the reshmi kebabs. They just melt in the mouth. However,I did not try out their Chinese items much. Please do give it a visit. The reasonable price added to the superb food won't disappoint you.

If you are a nonveg food lover and know taste, you are going to love their food. Haji Saheb is the best restaurant ever in south Kolkata. :)

Haji is no more the restaurant which it used to be. I have been a regular customer for years now. I still remember how my dad used to take me here for a Mutton Roll. Even though their rolls are still the best in Kolkata (in my opinion) their restaurant is not that great anymore.

Went there with my mum. I had ordered a Mutton Biriyani while my mum had ordered for Butter Chicken and Tandoori Roti.

The Rotis were hard and it was quite difficult to tear them apart. The Butter Chicken seemed to be dipped in Oil before it was brought to us. It was tasty however was very heavy. Even after hours I still feel heavy.

The biriyani is not anymore what it used to be.It lacked the taste which it generally had before.The Aroma which was enough to fill your senses and satisfy your hunger was almost absent.

However even though the rates are quite less in comparison to other restaurant who might serve even worse food i wont say that my overall experience was bad.

P.S please bring your old biriyani back! Please!

It is located in Diamond Harbour Road nd is the best Biryani centre in the south-western part of Kolkata.... Along with exclusively mughlai dishes,,, it also has Chinese nd North Indian.... But the people,, like me,, who visit Haji Saheb are the ones who strictly go for the Biryani..... Prices are cheaper too.... One secret is that one plate Biryani when packed nd taken home is of a greater quantity than which is served inside the restaurant,,,, hence takeaway is good option....

Have only given this high a rating because this place has introduced me to the world of biriyani. It still serves a great plate of biriyani, if you can ignore the grease, but other than that the Chinese food really sucks. The adjoining counter of take away sides,isn't that great either. Doubtful whether they serve fresh food there. So what you should only try is the biriyani.
Have given such a low rating because if my recent  horrid experience after ordering online through zomato. The delivery person was positively infuriating and delivered there for after 2 hours of placing the order when it should take only 30 mins max . Will never order from here ever again.

DESCRIPTION:
Haji Saheb, one of the most popular restaurants in Behala for years now. Known for its Biryani and Varieties of Rolls, they also have every other Indian and Chinese food items which we regularly have. But its the Biryani which made their success story. I have always been a fan of their Biryani since childhood. Residing in Behala its one of the most common places to go and have some Biryani, so its countless times i went to this place. But in recent years the quality and quantity of Biryani has degraded a lot which makes me go to other places.

LOCATION:
Located in Behala, Diamond Harbour Road. Behala Tram Depot is the landmark stoppage and once you reach there you can easily see the restaurant.

AMBIENCE:
Nothing to be honest. They have two sections: The Takeaway Section and The Dine In Section. Very ordinary place with too many tables and chairs in a small space making things uncomfortable.

WHAT TO ORDER?
Coming to food, which is the most important point to talk about. The Indian Dishes are quite good and worth their prices, whereas I personally don't like much of their Chinese food items.
These are the items which you should go for when you visit this place:
# Chicken/Mutton Biryani : The most popular item must be ordered as this is their speciality. Though you shouldn't expect much.

#Methi Chicken : This is one of the dishes i love here. The thick spicy gravy will take your heart and can bring you back again.

#Chicken Hariyali Kabab : If you love Kababs, you should try this one for sure. Soft, Green, Juicy, Delicious is what I can describe this item.

#Haji Spl. Mutton Kima : As the name says, its the special in the house. This is what i love and I always go for it. Mutton Keema cooked with rich spice with egg. You will definitely remember it for days.

#Chicken Tandoor: Decent taste, well cooked, highly reasonable.

#Rolls: The rolls are always a speciality of Haji Saheb, you can always have rolls from here. It has been hunger saviour for many for years.

LAST WORDS:
A very reasonable place to fill your stomach. If you want to eat Indian Food, you should definitely go to this place. Not only it gives you rich spicy taste, it saves your pocket as well. Do not go to this place if you want great ambience, or if you are going for a date with your partner.

A 3/5 overall. There are lot of areas where improvement is needed and it will definitely increase the ratings.

This used to be the best place for dining in Behala around 7 years ago from now. The main attraction over here was Biriyani. But now things have changed a lot. The most annoying thing is the quality of food. The food served over here are oily and cold and not to mention the behaviour of the staffs whose attitude towards there customer is horrible.¬†
This restaurant have aged a lot with zero signs of maintenance. There is now lot of good restaurants in and around behala. So as of now I cannot wand will not recommend this to anyone unless you really have to go there and people mostly go there because the food prices are cheaper than the competition.

Haji Saheb serves the best Biriyani in Kolkata. Well, I accept that the above statement is highly debatable and might even trigger a fight amongst the Biryani lovers. But when it comes to Biriyani I have a very soft corner and Haji deserves the crown of that niche. Haji also serves very good kebabs and rolls. Haji's double mutton tikka roll is one of the other dishes which I would die for.
I visited the restaurant section many years ago (I usually do a takeaway), and the last memory I have is, it can do a lot better in that area.
Note: visiting Haji and not having mutton Biriyani there is a crime no one should commit.

Located near the Tram Depot, this shop apparently is a crowd puller. Their rolls are legendary and can even give a run to Nizam for their money. They do have a sitting space, but I never got a chance to dine-in here. Would love to come back one day and try their Biryani. For the time being, am content with their rolls. :-)

This place has been feeding me biriyani for a very long time now. And the Biriyani is good, not comparable to brands like Arsalan or Aminia, but still tastes good enough. 

I had once tried their Chinese food, tasted good enough and good quantity. 

But that's not why you're gonna come to Haji Saheb. You're gonna come here for the Rolls. 

THEY MAKE ONE OF THE BEST ROLLS IN KOLKATA. 

The mutton roll is just great. The mutton filling is so succulent and delicious. 
One setback, the parantha is thick and fried in saturated fats. Do not let it go cold. 

Also, they make these Mutton Tikias which they sell for 20rs per piece. They're pretty awesome considering the pricing. I often get those with some Rumali rotis for an endearing meal when my purse is in a crisis.

Service is prompt. That's when I get a takeaway. I have hardly ever dined here anyway.

Best place for biryani in entire Thakurpukur Behala region.
Legendary place for rolls ( in fact it's the best place for rolls).
The roll counter always remains packed up..
Although people of Kolkata claim Nizam (esplanade) to be the legendary roll center, but my opinion differs here!
Other than rolls and biryanis, their kebabs are also savoury :)
But their Chinese dishes are not good enough!
Recommended.
**Everyone should try their roll once!

Well,it is located at a quite weird and unappetizing setting near Behala Tram Depot.The restaurant is split into two sections,with a jewelry shop dividing them.There is infact, a massive garbage disposal unit near the restaurant(giving out that awful stench) and scores of hawkers occupying the foothpath infront of it.The takeaway section attracts the main business while the seat and dine section is located in a somewhat congested part.The food is somewhat below average,biriyani and rolls being the main items on the menu.The biriyani I tried was too greasy.The meat was somewhat undercooked and boring.It was a less glamorous version of the regular biriyani one would find in an average Old Delhi biriyani shop.

Haji Saheb, one of the most popular food places to go to for Behala people. This place serves you fast food for on the goers and also offers you the luxury of fine dining. Their Chinese food is okay. Better than their Mughlai dishes. But if you have to taste a Mughlai dish of Haji Saheb, go for their Reshmi Kebab, Tikka Kebab or Biriyani. Their Mughlai side dishes failed to impress me not just once but many times. Congested and badly maintained.  I'll give it a 1.5

There is only one negative point here. You have to wait for a long to enter. After when you enter the restaurant,you will realize that you are in heaven.

We have to wait 75mins to enter!

Then we ordered 6 kabab dish,4 chiken biriyani,3 chicken items,one special biriyani,two mutton items.

Biriyani were tasty.good smell.
Kabab dishes were too good.
All the items are tasty.

Just try once.
All the items are too tasty.
Price reasonable.

Went to the Kolkata's best Roll Corner THE HAJI SAHEB and tasted their Chicken Roll which is the best in Kolkata. And I can assure you that this Chicken Roll is one of tastiest rolls in Kolkata.

4-5 years ago it was the best restaurant for biryani in behala region. Now a days it has gone down a bit. But the chicken roll of haji is the best I have ever had. Kabaab us good. Carpet area is small. Situated on the d h road, behala trum depot. Quite old restaurant and popular

Its a very old north indian resturant of behala specially famous for there rolls and biryani. Its situated near behala tramdepot. They offer a great varity of rolls, each of them are very good in taste. "Brain Roll" and "Brain Fry" is a special item of them which is made from goat brains. Their biryani and chanp tastes awsome. However they use dalda in their biryani, which I dont like at all. Their service is real quick. Its a real amazment to see that how quick they prepare rolls. Its a pocket friendly place which everyone should give a try

Before I write reviews, I always browse for others. Especially those that gave restaurants 1-2 stars that I think deserves the contrary. The menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering starters. We've eaten in Haji quite a times although one of oldest resturant in behala and nearby to my place a relatively Chinese & north indian food restaurant in Behala, and have had exceptionally good meals each time, had no worries on waiting for free table however depnds on several occasions.¬†
¬†Although small, the restaurant is reasonably attractive with a large tiled of his name . The menu is standard but The service in this restaurant was of such a low¬†calibre that I would have to deem it appalling. It's reasonable, so well priced and just delicious. my friends and went there but the ambience here is worst and even the service is not upto mark but the food here is delicious. Still, if you want great food, close your eyes and order here!

I was told this place is iconic and very famous in Behala area. So I tagged along with few of my colleagues for dinner. What disappointed me was the behaviour of the staff. Not rude, but very unwelcoming. Anyway moving to food, the biryani was ok. I expected it to be better. The chap wasn't good. Rates are competitive more or less.

Famous Haji Saheb of Behala, can we say it's heading towards ruins.. That may be a bold statement to start with as the footfall at this outlet was beyond imagination when it was at its peak. I have been a regular at this place from  2002 or so....... 
Starting from a 100 Sq ft outlet, which expanded to 1000 Sq ft to 2 shops - side by side (Integrated with family restuarent) and now having 2 outlets (2nd one in Park Circus). 
I loved, let me correct myself - whole of Behala loved their mouth watering rolls and best in zone biryani. Queues never fell short of 20 mts on weekends, where as now people can be seldom seen visiting this store as they used to. Arsalan has taken all its credits. Well lot of irrelevant talks of no relevance to readers so I will jump to the most important part - FOOD Quality

Chicken and Mutton Biryani has its own share of criticism. The quality has marginally degraded over the years. And their inclusion of 'Aloo Bukhara' or simply 'bukhara' adds to their taste a bit. Quantity is enough for one. 

Haji special (sort of mutton cubes gravy preparation) and Chicken bharta is good to accompany you biryani (only if you don't like it dry) 

Apart from that tandoori preparations, chicken and fish, additionally kebabs can be inconsistent as they sometimes overcook or under cook them. 

Tandoori and Naan are ordinary. Chinese cuisine is plain and simple - not worth mentioning. 

Well long story short - being a patron for almost 15 years - boy have I seen this outlet change its stature both with grandeur and humbleness.

Me and my friend went for summer training in the near vicinity of this restro,and while returning back,we were famished.Well,then zomato rescued us and we landed up in 'Hajisaheb'!!

LOCATION:-Located at a prime location like behala tramdepot stoppage,this is quite a crowd-puller!!being a north kolkata resident,am not afrequent visitor of behala,so when got the golden oppurtunity to taste the food of'Hajisaheb',i jz grabbed it in the wink of the eye!!!

AMBIANCE:-Ambiance was okayish..nothing extraordinary,but clean and comfortable!!Seating arrangement is on upstairs and the takewawy section is on ground floor.The aroma of biriyani,invigorates the foodie soul in you!!The location is always very crowded.30-32 people can sit at a time.Wrought iron glass top tables and chairs were there to sit.

SERVICE:-The service is really good.The waiter was courteous enough and knowledgable about the menu,which is quite impressive.

FOOD:- We ordered starter from their chinese section and main course from mughlai section.They are,

1)
Drums of heaven:-Heavenly it was!!They made it better than any indo-chinese restaurant and that time i was craving for it.6 pieces of chicken drumsticks,perfectly coated and smeared in spices and sauces,yummylicious!!
2)Special mutton biriyani:-The showstealer!!Ample amount of long rained,ghee-laden,aromatic basmati rice with two standard portion of soft mutton and perfectly boiled golden potato...Pure bliss!!
3)Chicken reshmi butter masala:-the best one i've ever had!!The gravy was perfectly cooked and gave a balanced flavour of sweetness and tang!!
We consumed it with a bottle of sprite and left the the place with a happily filled mind and tummy!!
VALUE FOR MONEY:-The place is a value for money.Our bill came around 530(aprox.).
Worth visiting!!
P.S.:-will try their rezala,nuns and haleem next time!

A new year day at Haji saheb....full of people showed how popular is this restaurant.Started with pan fried chicken, taste was good but if it had been a bit spicy, followed by methi chicken and butter chicken.Methi chicken was atleast not sweet,then came chicken tandoori which fared well.All this with rumali roti and the price came out to be under rs. 700! I guess the only place where Haji saheb need to work is the spicy section, which generally lacks in all the dishes,whether. Chicken or mutton.

Food was good but I got free cooked 'honey bee' along with mutton biriyani special. Restaurant Staffs  behaved like I am having food at a street food stall. They did not take any initiative to serve better. Food department should take initiative to control the quality or to ban this kind of Restaurants from India. We always go with the taste of food but it is also important to hyegenic and quality food is mostly important. However we feel safe unless we see it. This time honey bee in the plates they have served. When I informed them they just took the honey bee from my plate and went back and remain silent. Is this the service we should expect??

Located on a prime spot in Behala trum depot, Haji Saheb has became the landmark of the area. It is famous for its biriyani & rolls. Their rolls are the best, specially chicken roll, tikkia roll & also even the paneer rolls. You should definitely try it out if you are in that locality. It is one of the old restaurants in Kolkata & the daily crowd in the evenings prove people's cravings for rolls of that place. The sitting arrangements is on the 1st & 2nd floors and lil congested. Theres nothing much about the ambiance, people just go there for good foods only. If you look for a luxury dining then Hazi Saheb is not the place but if you wanna feel ur tummy with yummy rolls & biriyani in a reasonable price then you should visit there outlet.

I was stuck between 4 and 4.5 for a long time, when I realize this is really a place that falls in the 4.25 zone! :P

Ratings apart, being from Behala, this has been one of my favorite hunting grounds. In college days, when I was short of cash, the regular order was an Egg Roll or a Mutton Tikiya Roll, and believe me when I tell you, one roll is enough as a meal! Their rolls are huge and quite heavy, hence very filling.

As time went by, I tasted their Biryani, and this is one of the few places that has got better with time. Their Biryani started out as dalda-infused (used to form a white layer within half an hour) but now, they serve one of the finest biryanis in Kolkata, a feat that is easier said than done with stalwarts all around. I would say this place hasn't had proper recognition for being in Behala.

All their kababs are well-sized portions and very tasty. But apart from the rolls and Biryanis, the cake has to go to their Mutton Tikiya. Yes they are very rich, yes they are not for the calorie conscious, but they are freakin' great! They cook a mean boneless mutton gravy called Haji Special, and it is a must have with Roomali when you are around. Their Mutton Chap is also decent but again, incredibly rich. Superbly priced for the quality, this joint is going to go places in the next couple of years.

Undoubtedly it is the best place for rolls in ALL OVER THE WORLD.. It's a place for those who put taste of food above everything else.

It definitely serves better Biriyani than most of its peers at a cheaper cost. Kebabs are mouth-watering. The kebabs are simply lip smacking and hugely delicious with a decent varities. Ambience & staffs would be a problem if you are with your family.Otherwise okay.

Tried out chinese as well but nothing special to mention. The mutton biryani and the chicken chap are too awesome!

One of the fast growing mughlai joint in the city with amazing and delicious kababs! The guys here are really helpful about the menu and courteous as well. 
The biriyani is the typical Kolkatan biriyani that we get in other mughlai restaurants but the kababs are simply lip smacking and hugely delicious with a decent varities. Tried out chinese as well but nothing special to mention. Being a north Kolkatan, its not always possible to commute Behala but i surely make some time out for that kabab hanging behind the glass! Worth a try guys and hopefully you won't be disappointed.

This place is located on the Diamond Harbour Road near Tram Depot bus stop. It has been around for quite a long time, and is very famous in behala and beyond, especially for its wide variety of rolls, chicken, mutton, mutton-tikia, paneer, egg, double-chicken, double-mutton and the best, brain roll. Apart from that it is also reputed for serving the best biriyanis in behala. I have also tried their mutton resala, mutton kasa, mutton handi and the haji special, which consists of small pieces of mutton(kima) served with half a slice of boiled egg, its absolutely delicious and can be tried with parathas or biriyani. Every day, be it weekdays or weekends, in the evening, their is always a long queue in front of their small roll counter, of people waiting to grab a bite of their variety of rolls, if one is a fan of north Indian food/biriyanis/rolls and happens to be in Kolkata, this place is a must try.

EDIT: Recently I had tried out some of their Chinese food items, namely Mixed Gravy Noodles and Half Plate of Chicken in Oyster Sauce. The Chicken in Oyster Sauce was OK even though it was a little spicy, although its generally supposed to be slightly on the sweeter side. The portions in it were of decent size. The Half Plate option comes with four pieces of chicken @ ‚Çπ70 and the Full Plate with eight pieces @ ‚Çπ140. This is a nice option to have in case you just want to order for yourself. The Mixed Gravy Noodles @ ‚Çπ130 was quite good with decent amount of chicken, prawn, egg and veggies in it. 

Overall there Chinese dishes are OK but definitely not as good as there North Indian cuisines. You can try it as the price is quite less but if quality is what you are looking for and don't want to compromise on that then there are better options in Behala.

They also have a lot of variety in chinese,I tried only their chilli chicken and its really good.

This is one of the oldest restaurants in Behala. However quite shockingly the food quality has degraded over years. The Biryani is either very dry or oily but hardly has any taste. The Chanp is no way near a good one. However the kebabs are ok to deal with. 
But I still love the rolls. I think they are the best in Behala. 

Pros: Good location
Healthy ambience
Affordable prices

Cons: Food quality
Food taste
Excessive use of Dalda

It's situated in a very congested area and the entry opens to a dirty place. The ambiance and the sitting arrangements are below standard.
Coming to food... the one it's famous for is its roll but I personally didn't like the parantha as some times is preety hard and the chicken could be better in taste. The tandoori chicken taste upto the level and the biriyani far below the level and standard that we have in the price it offered for. The dish contains pepper in quantity more than required. Overall you wont enjoy the food.. Kebabs are standard out here. And I never took the risk of ordering Chinese here..

Well known for its fingerlicking rolls and birianis...but every item is worth trying...tandoori chicken and chicken reshmi kebab stand out....sitting arrangement less and sometimes they want you to share tables with other...that is the only disadvantage i think

To begin with, biriyani has been associated as a comfort food for us bongs for a long period of time and they who designated it as such were not wrong, nothing says "BHALOBASHA" more than a plate of scintillating mutton biriyani, it will cheer up anyone having a rough day per se. People who owe allegiance to aminia and arsalans wont understand the drifters who gorge on biriyani selflessly for all good things come in small packages. 

After a quite disheartening separation from my gf. This place provided solace in the form of their biriyani. Nice flaky rice, gorgeous piece of meat and fragrant overall, every morsel was a sign for a new beginning and so it was indeed. Try this place , u will not be disappointed.

Their rolls are still god but biriyani has lost its charm and taste.
Prices are going high and high but the quality is not.
They are not expanding their menu with respect to time, same old menu with no improvements.
You can easily get a seat in normal time but its impossible to get a seat during the pujas so don't bother trying then.
Seating arrangement is good.

It's situated in the hustle bustle of Behala Tram Depot.
Very close to my house.
I haven't eaten in the restaurant but I have
Taken Away from there innumerable times.
Let me put down a list of items i had from here
Biriyani(most of the times)
Rolls(all different types)
Schezuan Noodles
Tandoori Roti
Handi Chicken
Mixed Fried Rice
Kebabs
Haji special
They provide very good food and good quantity .
Rolls are very Very tasty.
Biriyani is awesome as well.
Yes they specialize in Mughlai food though the chinese is not bad..
Only Once i had a complain with the quality
But they apologized and changed the food as well.
Prices are decent.
A great Place in all.

Haji saheb near park circus.. Been there with my family for a birthday dinner. Instead of waiting for a table at arsalan decided to move into this place.. And did not regret it at all.. The interior is quite classy and interesting.. The use of mirror on one part of the restaurant gives it a mighty look.. The food was served timely.. I simply loved der chicken shaslik.. You would love their other exotic and pocket friendly dishes as well. Biryani is ordinary.. But that's cause I love biryani prepared at home.  :P staff are efficient and considering we were 9 people dining.. The cheque didn't dig a hole in our pockets

Biriyanis were for 22 and 24 INR...chicken and mutton respectively vs 140 odd now...thats how old this place has been in Behala and thats the time since when i have been eating there....3 rs for a lachha paratha and 7 rs for a mutton tikia....10 rs for a tikia roll.....uffff.....loved those days...

Haji is what Behala was known for then....on the D.H. Road opposite behala tram depot, and beside the famous behala bazaar...the smell of parathas getting fried in dalda would have melted your taste buds...over a period of time, they have added other items in their menu, like the chinese section, kebabs and other gravy items which was restricted to chaap and biriyani alongwith rolls back then...and it has done fairly well in keeping the standards intact amidst the rising prices all around...also, it has added a  A.C seating section in the first floor for people who wants to relax and relish the delicacies...

all their items are good to really good....they were known for their biriyanis...that probably has degraded a bit over the years but then it can also be possible that there are joints dishing better products....there is arsalan near taratala and there will be aminia opening up at pathakpara...one must definitely try their rolls, the best for me is the mutton tikia roll....they also serve mutton brains which called be rolled in a paratha as well...

for once, i took their Haji Special...which are small tiny cubes of mutton in a red gravy and a egg....it bought it at 7pm and when we were about to eat at 10pm it was already spoilt....thats the only blemish i could find in the last so many years and since then, i have avoided that one item...but buying from Haji will keep you happy almost everytime....one small tip....buy a packet of gelusil or rantac on the way home, trust me you will need it as they use a lot of dalda in all their food items....

I have grown up eating Haji Saheb's food. I remember nearly alternate day, i used to visit the place with my friends on my way home from school. Even now, it has maintained its quality over the years. Mughlai is best here though i would advise against the Chinese. Its good, bu there are a lot of alternatives for Chinese restaurants in Behala that are much better than this. My favorite however has always been their rolls. Whether its chicken mutton or tikia roll, every one of them is utterly delicious. Priced at a moderate rate of 35/- its also very cheap. Every time you pass across it, you will notice there's a large queue in front of the roll counter.

Haji saheb had been there in behala for ages. I had been having their biriyani since i was a kid. The behala branch is usually for takeaways which is ok for me as my house is near. This place is a really busy one and its crowded all the time. 

Few days back I tried their chickn biriyani and chicken chaap and chickn malai kebab. Kebab was very tasty , smoky succulent tender chickn pieces marinated to perfection. Now the biriyani has faltered over the years. I am saying this becauae i had been having biriyani from haji since they opened here..then they used to serve excellent biriyani but somehow i feel their quality had dropped. The chickn was a bit bland to taste..the biriyani was ok.. The chaap on the other hand was so much oily and rich..

Haji used to be my favourite biriyani joints but now it has gone down tge list . Nonetheless i love haji saheb and i would be very happy if they again start making that mouthwatering biriyani they used to make whn i was little..

Note- Their mutton biriyani is a lot tastier than their chicken counterpart. Their quantity is ample and the price fits fine. They serve rolls too which are humongous in size and excellent in taste.

Ok, if ever you have the craving for Rolls...think no where else than this little joint. To start off with it all...they make one helluva classy paratha that stands alone. Then comes the stuffing..be it egg or meat. When the final product is in your mouth...you can't help but keep on chewing for the next bite. One role is enough to fill your tummy yet you'd want another. Though the place is small...you wouldn't care when you get rolls like these.

For their roll and reasonble pricing they are the one who is famous as well bas Behala is for its roads. The congested place gets even more conjested with hungry people all around.

This review is about Home delivered dish from park circus branch..It was raining outside but order collection was done with appreciable promptness.We ordered ¬†Dhania Chicken and my favorite Hyderabdi Keema.The order was delivered in 30 minutes flat in Saltlake ,Highly impressed.Coming to the quality of the food .

1. Dhania Chicken :-It was succulent and rich with aroma .Wonderful dish to go with hot parantha ¬†.6 peices in a plate and potion size is highly appreciable. score 3 out 5

2.Hyderbadi Keema : Basically this was the dish i am fan about as i had in their behala joint for couple of times.But this dish was served with curry leaves in it and to my surprise it tasted wonderful Keema preparation is not at all hot but it was rich with mughlai spices and of course oil.This keema dish is best enjoyed with Tandoori roti or Nan. score 3.5 out of 5

Over all these two dish were excellent but definitely not out of the world.
Will I repeat my order : Yes Only once more with Hyderabadi Keema¬†
Must try dish ? Dhania chicken -No Hydrabadi Keema-Yes

This is one of those old famous restaurants located in a very inconvenient location in behala tram depot. But inspite of that it caters to a huge number of foodies. 
I recently had their HALIM which they are making specially for the Ramzan. I packed a plate of it to home. And I was hugely disappointed! There were 6 pieces of mutton (small sized but well cooked) but the gravy was next to inedible. It was extremely spicy which I guess I am supposed to expect from this kind of food, but when It's just spicy with no taste, it becomes unbearable. I felt like a huge amount of kashmiri chilly powder and garam masala entered my system when I took the first bite. 
I have had Halim before and even my ma has made it in home, they were far better than this experience.

If you want classic rolls...this is the ultimate place. With people coming in huge numbers, u will have to come here with enough time if you want to get some rolls. But if you want to have Biriyani then there are other places to be in rather than here. Here biriyani's contain much fat and are full of dalda that makes it oily. Situated at the heart of Behala its never out of customers. Its a good place for casual dinner.

Went there yesterday on a friend's bday treat. Before commenting about the food i would like to talk about some confusions....when i entered the shop i clearly remember there were kababs hanging there...but when we went to the 3rd floor and ordered food...we were informed kabab and halim wasn't available...infact almost nothing was available...dont know if its cause of the iftar they are running out of food....or its a regular story there.  Now talking about the food...the biryani and chap is good...chicken butter masala was ok. Quantity was huge. Price is reasonable. When we came down again...we saw both kabab and haleem was available. I dont know what on earth was going on. Is there any difference between the ground floor counter and seating area?  Does anyone know?

Haji Saheb, well known for its chicken rolls and biryani but at behala outlet the restaurant is very clumsy though their dine in place is quiet decent. Its a nearby food hub for me and i seldom buy food from here especially their kababs. One of great thing is the service is really quick and quality food but at the other hand its situated in a busy market area of behala and always over crowded. Pocket friendly and efficient food, this makes haji saheb run.

Haji saheb is located at behala tram depot.  It has two sections one for rolls and takeaway and another is a restaurant.  Once i had the foods in restaurant but mostly i prefer takeaway.  Chicken biryani,butter naan, haji special, reshmi kebab and fish fry we orderd for.  I was very disappointed by seeing the fish fry as it costed a lot comparing to its size. Biryani was ok.  Rest of the foods tasted ok.  Rolls used to taste good but now became very oily and also small in size.  Staffs are ok. Overall it was a good experience. :)

Though im not much fond of biriyani ,after the Msg threat to Chinese food i had to somewhat  forcefully incline towards biriyani.  So after several several years thought of eating biriyani n asked my dad to take it from Haji saheb. He took chicken biriyani.. as im having it after so many years I can say their taste has deteriorated. They used dalda which I don't like at all. The potato was not cooked properly n its kacha frm inside. lastly I missed egg. Calcutta biriyani is incomplete without an egg. overall I would suggest dnt have it.

U get good quantities for basic prices...it's a no pretence just food kindof a place...the biriyani and the rolls are really addictive...but one should stay clear of 'Haji Special'..

Despite hearing about its dwindling quality, one can't simply feel nostalgic about this outlet. Atleast I do!! I have spent my college bunked afternoons holed up at a friend's place watching back to back movies and ordering food from here. Sure hope the authorities would soon pay some heed and reign in a good amount of quality control

This place makes me nostalgic.
In my childhood haji Saheb's kathi rolls were my favorite food.
And the biriyani there was also delicious. last year I visited there once, nowadays the quality as slightly fallen but the essence remains the same.

I forgot to mention thhe chicken chaap. lovely!!!!

Famed for its biriyani and Mutton delicacies..this place is a crowd puller.The takeaway joint is always crowded as biriyani packets literally fly off the counter.Ordered it last week...was a little disappointed.1 measly semi boiled boiled potato and 1 mousy little piece of meat.Expected better

Situated in a very congested area in Behala.
Famous for rolls generally. The kebabs and biryani are awesome. Ambience is not upto the mark. But definitely food quality is top-class.
Being a Behalite, this has been one of my favourite restaurants in my locality.

Haji saheb is one of the famous restaurants for the people of behala. And myself being a typical behala resident can simply bet that very few food joints in the area can match the popularity of haji saheb. Famous for its rolls, this place serves one of the most delicious biriyanis in kolkata. The laccha paratha used here for making the rolls is surely better than most restaurants( some even very expensive ones). Another thing is the prime location in behala. It is situated on the diamond harbour road tram depot. The place is very reasonably priced and the quantity served is also very good. The take away menu is very cheap and it has a facility of both half and full plates. The kababs made here has a delicious taste and aroma. The chinese served here though not pure chinese( somewhat indo-chinese) is good if considered only on taste. So on an average it can be considered as a decent place with hardly any cons to look at

Was there today alone,  ordered mutton kasha and tandoori roti.  He brought cold chicken kasha and cold rumali roti.  When asked what is this he said tandoori roti is cold I showed him boss this rumali roti too is cold.  And when asked about mutton kasha he said I will bring it now..  He brought it and it was colder than chicken kasha,  it was raw also.  You can see it in the pic attached. 
 Raw mutton was my tipping point. I paid for both mutton kasha and tandoori roti and left them both as it is.  I didn't go there to eat cold food.  Even heating that mutton kasha in a microwave could have helped. 
Seriously I am never going to their restaurant ever again in my life.  Haji saheb behala is better off at selling rolls and biryanis. Not to forget Haji special.  Rest all is CRAP.  The waiter who served me had a polite answer he said sir abb khaalo abb bill ban gaya hai.  As if I will not pay.  I paid in full without eating any of the shit they served and left.

All that i care about here is their ROLLS and not too much else. They have become a household name in rolls and biriyani but personally, I think their biriyani is no more how it used to be earlier!

However they are still reaping their goodwill....you will see a long queue at their shop irrespective of climate or season!!!

They have a dine-in restaurant too but i'd NOT recommend them for a few reasons, namely unhygienic, lethargic service, dirty and stained plates, a perpetual smell of the food which makes it 'feel' unhygienic.

I'd rather take away my rolls and biriyani than eat them there. All said, their biriyani is still surely worth a try if you have never done so!

Everytime you pass by Behala, you will see people flocking around Haji Saheb. This is mainly because of the rolls you get here which, in spite of not being of the expected standard these days, are certainly worth spending money on.

Half the world knows Behala because of Haji and the other half knows Haji because of Behala. Situated at one of the busiest and very dirty places in Behala, Haji is renowned for its iconic rolls, which sell like crazy every single day. 

That is because of many reasons. The first reason is the lachha paratha itself. It has a hint of sweetness and keora fragrance, is deep fried in dalda, resulting in a thick, flaky flatbread of awesomeness. Secondly, the filling of the rolls, be it chicken or mutton tastes like no other filling anywhere in town. They have a closely guarded secret recipe which is subject to a lot of rumors. 

Apart from rolls, you can go up to the restaurant area, where the Biryani is the most demanded dish, and rightly so, because the rice tastes just perfect, and so does the aloo. Improvements can be made with meat in the biryani which is sometimes to small to finish all the rice with. 

The kababs like chicken tikka, tandoori chicken and reshmi kabab are very well prepared and taste so good! But that‚Äôs just about it. The gravy dishes like chaanp are too full of oil and lack flavor. Their worst preparation is the Rezala which is just chunks of boiled meat in a very bland, tasteless white gravy. 

I had once randomly ordered a plate of chicken momo but surprisingly it turned out to be bloody awesome!!

During rush hours you might just be asked to share your table with strangers. The servers are polite but stern because the gentry there is very varied. 

Go to Haji for the best roll you will get to eat in your life, or for the Biryani and Kebabs. Don‚Äôt take further risks.

Have visited Haji Saheb many a times as I live nearby. The rolls are heavy, owing to the lachha paratha, and taste awesome. Prices are very reasonable, and service is fast. It also serves mughlai & chinese , though not authentic yet pleasing for the taste buds. The major drawback is the location, as the nearby area is very congested and dirty with garbage which almost destroys the appetite.

It was probably Nizam who popularised rolls as a snack. But it was joints like Haji who took kathi rolls it to a whole new level. The curried chicken or mutton stuffed in the cylindrical gastronomic fiesta will only leave you asking for more. A suggestion is, ask them to add more lime, and zero sauce. Or else your taste buds cannot do justice to the stuffing inside. From the time I had known Haji Saheb, it used to be a roll and biriyani joint. It was much later when they upgraded to a full fledged restaurant. So u can well understand, what to go for if u r anyday planning to visit behala. Though the biriyani is not the same anymore, and has lost out to Pannas kitchen in both taste and quality. Folks, y do u add so much sticky animal fat in ur foods! It gets horrible when cold. I used to be a fan of ur biriyani and chaap, from the time when you could not even let people sit. All of ur additions and experiments with different cuisines have failed ever since. Biriyani was ur forte, but only till people started spending more on staying healthy than gorging on oily and scented fares. But guys, ur rolls have been ur bread earner. And I indeed voted for ur rolls to be one of the best in the city. Now for fellow zomans, if u r not willing to take any risk with haji saheb, still do come someday to witness the mammoth scale of round the clock roll production and the precision of the person at the counter who is converting a laccha paratha into an irresistible delicacy.

The Biryani is just wow here, and it has been the same over the years! Lovely aromatic and beautifully coloured rice with nice chunk of mutton or chicken pieces. It has been a favorite since my younger days. The roll available at the take away counter is also great. Try the egg-chicken or egg-mutton roll, also the mutton tikka roll is extremely filling and tasty. The lachha paratha they make over here is well crafted which makes the roll so heavy. The restaurant space is not much, specially during pujas all the seats are booked and people generally have to wait outside in queue. Service time depends on what you order. Don't expect polite and courteous behaviour from their service staff, they mean business. Haji Saheb is not for the calorie conscious. Take away your food and enjoy at the leisure of your home. I give them 0.5 extra, just because they won't disappoint you even at 11pm in the night. You can be rest assured of a plate of Biryani even at that time, unlike other restaurants in Behala.

Haji Saheb..much lesser known among the crowds of Arsalans and Aminias, certainly and quite deservedly should stand out as an example. Reason? lets get to the review.

Ambiance - Overlook. Just know, its clean and hygienic alright.

Food - Ya, here is where you should focus.¬†

1. Mutton Biriyani - Best Biriyani in Kolkata. I have always been a fan of Arsalan, but Haji aces in some parameters which is a lost art now. The perfect amalgamation of saffron and white basmati rice, perfect amount of oil/ghee used, the perfect amount of aroma of the spices, the perfectly cooked, tender mutton pieces and even a perfectly boiled potato. No restaurant in Kolkata makes this kind of old school sffron-white aromatic biriyani nowadays. Times Food Award winner of this year, this is something i will recommend to all the fellow foodies.

2. Firni - A mughlai dish always ends with this. thats why. Though it wasnt no where close to the biriyani standard and was too sticky and dry.

Service - Again overlook. Delivery time is approx 15 mins.

The outlet is mostly a take away one, though there is elaborate seating space.¬†
Remains crowded most of the time.
Look out for the guy who packs the biriyani. He does some neat trick during packing.
Unfortunately, missed the rolls. Will certainly give it a try in my next visit to Kolkata.

P.S. Whatever the rating would be, it would be for the biriyani ;)

Cheers!

Basically grew up eating roll from there.
During school days literally gave up maths & chemistry tutions (you would know what i am talking about if you are a behalite)to get people chicken roll from here.
Always as tasty as it was.
And the guy packing biriyani into those cardboard boxes. Have you ever noticed that amazing thing he does? Scooping plates of biriyani and literally catching that with the box!!!! Seemed fascinating. :D

People know its Haji by the aroma. The aroma lingers and makes ur mouth water. the aroma is brilliant but the biriyanis are not so. its too oily to enjoy. though i like there mutton tikia, bheja fry, reshmi kabab n rezala etc. their chinese section is also good. chinese dishes are sort of indianized which i personally like, may be becoz it was the very first place i started eating chinese. ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Their rolls need a special mention. they taste really good when they are hot. I love their tikia and chicken roll. Tikia roll is too heavy for me i cant completely finish a single tikia roll. Prices have increased recently, still its quite affordable.

Location and ¬†Description : After being in my wishlist for long time finally i landed to this place....
This place is at the Behala Tram depo which attracts everyone's eye with its delicious food paradise who comes to shop there,
Well Haji is a very renowned Franchise as all know. They are mainly known for there indian and tandoor items as well as there Famous Biriyani. They have various menus. One for dine in and other for take away. The prices are not too expensive but according to the food its not bad.

Ambience and Staff: Beginning with the ambiance so its it is two floored restaurant with full A.c and lots of tables to offer. Its clean and well maintained with staffs very quick to your service.

Food : Coming to the food so Haji saheb offers you lots of variety of Indian as well as Chinese. Well seating at Haji and not ordering biriyani is just a foolish thing. So we went for Mutton Biriyani first which was really awesome. The Taste was delicious so as the Mutton in it which was really cooked well and juicy. With it we went for Haji special Keema which the waiter said isn't available which annoyed me really. Quickly i shifted to Butter Chicken and Rumali roti. The butter Chicken was as good as you can say. Butter can be seen floating on the gravy and the chicken was marinated so well, Full marks to the butter chicken.¬†

QNQ & Prices: The quality here is always been good and so the quantity they provide is satisfactory. prices are reasonable here. Dine in rate is different from the take away. Be sure on that.

Conclusion: As far as my experience to this place as expected was really satisfactory and i will be visiting again to try the Chinese as well.

Note: The review is posted after my personal visit and experience to this place.

The rolls looked very tasty though I didn't get an opportunity to try them out.

But the Biriyani and Chicken Reshmi kebab was perfectly cooked and tasty. The service for take-away order was also super-fast and impressive.

Had a really awful experience in this restaurant. Would never go back there after what happened with us. 6 of us went to the place to have lunch at about 3 in the afternoon. Firstly, we had to wait for about an hour at the 1st floor. Secondly, after they called us in, each and every item we ordered weren't there. None of the Chinese dishes as well as the kebab dishes were there. If they want to serve only Biriyani to their customers, they should remove the other items from their menu card. Moreover, they deducted 10 extra bucks as they were smart enough to make out they we weren't going to offer them tips. I strongly recommend against this restaurant.

Speaking of this place, what comes first to mind is their awesome variety of rolls, the mutton tikka roll is a stunner. Some days earlier we had mutton biryani and mutton stew. The biryani was one of best in kolkata undoubtedly. We wanted to have to have mutton rezala but the stuff insisted for the stew. Believe me i have to thank him for that, it was lite but extremely tasty with perfectly cooked meat and has kind of a sweet and sour taste.Service was prompt as we took away. The staff were very helpful as i mentioned. I have many things taste yet.Its a must for all biryani and mutton lovers.

Probably there is not a single person in Behala who does not know about the Haji Saheb. The place is probably the first in Behala to provide biriyani at cheaper rates.
.But for dinner it is too bad if they do not get the speciality dish, specially when referred by the waiter himself....
I would say zero in customer service...This leads to losing a brand value and it will..

The best rolls in whole Kolkata or India as a matter of fact, since u wont find good rolls outside kolkata. Chicken roll, mutton roll, double chicken or mutton roll, egg chicken or mutton roll, egg tikia roll...u name it and they have it. Believe me, be it Nizams or Zeeshan or Shiraz golden no one just no one prepaires the roll as good as them. I think their secret lies in their paratha. 
Secondly as u will find them in the brilliant byriyanis section of zomato u can well understand their byriyani is also no less renowned. Light on stomach and a healthy piece of succulent meat will accompany the nicely flavoured rice. Serving is quite handsome. 
Kababs and tandooris are items one should also try. Definitely the best kababs in behala. 
Overall a foodie's delight.
But their dine in space is a bit small so I would suggest take away or home delivery.
Located coveniently on DH  Road  , just opposite the behala tram depot. One of the best place for mughlai and indian food lovers.

You are here in Behala and didn't try Haji Saheb, you are doing it wrong! Haji Saheb is the site which put Behala on food stop list of Kolkata. Despite the fact the quality balance never had been smooth (there had been ups & downs in their quality throughout these years), Haji Saheb has been a name to vouch for. I personally recommend the Biryani which I feel is way better than other big names. They also have introduced Chinese dishes which are good to some standards.

'Haji Saheb' is famous for their rolls.Once upon a time their rolls quality was very good but now their quality is average.The size is small & roll is too oily.they have also seating arrangements besides the roll counter.their biriyani is average.It is the most popular restaurant in Behala.It is located on the Diamond Harbour road near behala tram depot.price is also reasonable.

Ok guys, seriously, there was quite a decline in the quality in the middle, i.e- 2008-2013 ish, but, now this is the 2nd best Biriyani in town... And the Chaanp is, I think, the best, generous in flavour and masala...

Ok I donno why this place has got such higher rating than it deserves. Haji was once good, may be when I didn't have pocket money n had to tug mom n dads hand to buy me a chicken roll from there. But after the start of panna, haji's food started on steady decline. The decline is so noticeable, that the mutton in the biriyani is hardly eatable n the biriyani itself is oily n not good. I am not even going to their overtly oily n spicy side dishes. 
But yaa the roll they make, that still has got its own charm. Nice crispy paratha stuffed with ample chicken or mutton. Perfect. 
N yes the smell. While walking past it on the shitty hawker dominated footpaths of behala that always feel like an oasis in desert. Argggh talking abt their roll just made me hungry!!
PS dont eat in haji leaving panna jus take away their roll.

If you really want to experience the best Mughlai cuisine, Haji's the place for you. Best rolls you will ever taste. If you ever visit Kolkata, never miss this place. Mutton Biryani is just too awesome... 

Tip: Stand at the parcel counter and watch how fast they prepare rolls (15-20 at a time) within two minutes. Mouth watering...

How can I forget my childhood days when behala for me was synonymous with haji's biriyani.They were really good.As years went by their quality drastically dropped and now the restaurant earns it's reputation for their rolls.They r the best in whole of kolkata.No one can invade their potential position as the Roll emperor.Didnt had their biriyanis for a decent time now but their tandoori and kebabs are good and decently priced.But the score of 3.5 upon 5 is solely due to their rolls.

What can i tell about Haji Saheb, Behala!!! This outlet has been a part of the growing up years of we cousins. i remember visiting my uncles place at behala once in a month with the secret desire to eat biryani and chaap from Haji Saheb with my cousins. My uncles used to get the biryani and chaap for us at least once during my visit to their place. We all used to gorge on the biryani and chaap each time and yet craving for more. It has been ages i have visited behala but thanks to the biryani fest held in the city these days where i make it a point to taste biryani and chaap from Haji Saheb... for the sheer taste and nostalgia associated with this place.

The most famous shop in behala and also in kolkata for rolls and biriyani. Quality and taste of food is exceptional,  yet pocket friendly.  My personal favorite is mutton biriyani and rolls.  Other favourites include mutton rogan josh,  kebab,  chicken bharta, and haji special. A must try for all the foodies out there.

Undoubtedly this is one of the best restaurants in behala. It specializes in mughlai ¬†dishes. The biriyani is my personal favorite. It's tasty. Other dishes such as Rotis and preparations of chicken and mutton are also delicious. ¬†For desert, I prefer Firni.
However, the real reason why Haji is famous is it's rolls, which are undoubtedly the cr√®me de la cr√®me of rolls. They are lip smacking.However, the ambiance is quite ordinary. The place is bland, and in this sector, there is room for improvement.But if you want tasty Mughlai food at a reasonable price in behala, this is one of the first names that come to mind.

Location : Very Close to the State Archeological Museum , Behala

Ambiance : It's two floors and the upper deck has the very distinct "Arsalan" touch. Soory but I'm an Arsalan addict. Either way it's nice but not fancy. As if it matters if you'e hungry as hell :P !

Food : Haji Saheb is and has been well known for quite some time and it's not difficult to see why. With prices still within the reach of most people , it's always more or less crowded. Went there for some casual dining and found out that the rolls are far more popular than the Biryanis !! Either way ordered the Chicken Egg Biriyani and the Mutton Biriyani. The waiting time was very minimal and we dug in as soon as the dishes were brought in. It wasn't the best but the quantity and the quality at this price wasn't anything to critize about. Amply big piece of Mutton and likewise of a chicken leg. Although the Chicken Biriyani was light but the mutton counterpart was heavy with more earthen spices.¬†

Cost for 2 : 500/-¬†

Final Conclusion : ¬†Recommendable for those sudden mood swings of food cravings . Absolutely cheap and affordable . Well worth it you're residence is close by.

I fondly remember my school days when we would travel all the way from Kidderpore to Behala just for their rolls.
The ambience is not clean,the dine in section operates only during weekends and weekday evenings and the overall hygiene unimpressive.
But the taste. The rolls are decadent and the double chicken/egg chicken/mutton tikia roll is made in a sauce unparalleled by top restaurants. These folks won't rely on tomato/chilli sauce for flavour. 
Go to Haji. Take away if possible.
Eat. Repeat. Eat.

One of the Best Mughlai Rolls in town.

Rolls are one the popular street foods in Kolkata and they can be categorized as Punjabi, Mughlai and Bengali. The Punjabi rolls will be available in shops having names like ... da dhaba or ... e Punjab. The Bengali style will be available in little trolley stalls hooked up in your parar more where they would add alur torkari in the egg rolls. Last but not the least comes the Mughlai rolls.¬†

I have grown up at Behala tasting the rolls of Haji Saheb and without a doubt they produce the best Mughlai rolls in Kolkata. I had heard about Nizam's and Badshaah, and probably they produced good rolls in British times. But now on the modern day, its Haji all the way. The tikia rolls would cost Rs 9 and a plate of Chicken Biryani would cost Rs 27 when I was small.¬†

The best part about Haji is their confidence level. They do not wait for orders, they just prepare the rolls and guess what the rolls get swooped away in seconds.

A decent place to eat out at Behala. There is practically no ambiance and my recommendation will be take away.The wrought iron table tops are almost always greasy and not very clean. Has AC though. Biriyani is on the drier side and not upto the mark. My suggestion is Mutton Chaanp with Tandoori Roti or the amazing thick yet flaky Lachha Parathas. I like the Haji Saheb Special Mutton also. Kebabs are also good. So is the Tikia.¬†
The rolls at the takeaway counter are awesome!!! Mutton, Chicken and Tikia Rolls are worth a try. The Mutton Roll is quite addictive.¬†
Service is very quick although you almost always have to battle a crowd of atleast 20 odd people.

Have been enjoying their food ever since i was a toddler...my family is a big fan of their biryani and the delicate taste hasn't changed and hopefully never will.. And if u want to have a go at one of the best rolls you'll ever taste in Kolkata, you must visit haji saheb.. Quite frankly the restaurant is quite underrated and needs more recognition.

Reasonably priced haji is located in at the center of behala and hence accessible to everyone staying in behala. It's a good take away joint as I would advise privacy and good conversations are not their things. However what they deliver is brilliant rolls and the second best biryani in kolkata after arsalan. However that's a personal opinion. Do try the chicken reshmi butter masala when you are here. Happy eating.

My all time favourite ROLLS comes from HAJI and I used to love their Biriyani which was rich and oily. recently they have changed their biriyani style after the opening of Alibaba in behala(which is not there any more) who used to brag about their less oily style. My request please come back to your originality. Why we will come to haji if we get the same taste in other restaurants and specially when they offer better ambiance.
About the dine-in only one suggestion.,. its clumsy and unhygienic. PLease take care of it.

I always prefer takeaway from here. And the only thing i take these days is biriyani.
Why biriyani is good here?-
1. The meat is soft and aromatic.
2. The rice is light and retained.
3. Spices catch smoky aroma rather than being over-tuned with its own smell
4. Served decently.
But like every not-that-well-known restaurant the quality has high degree of variance, sometimes the handi is under-prepared.
The dine in part is untidy with very ill mannered serving personnel.

Haji Saheb, the name that defines Biryani for Behalites.It was there before Arsalan came in Taratala, it was there before Srishti/Barisha club were not merged and were competitors, It was there when Ganguly was going to school, it was there when Trams used to flock in Behala......Haji Saheb and the garbage dumping¬†vat in front of it has been there for eternity.The rolls are the best I have had all over India.Period.The speed with which they make the rolls is the fastest I have seen ever till date. The biryani tastes good and is the benchmark for many who grew up eating it.(no matter how oily or dalda laden it is)Haji Saheb goes beyond taste and ambience and may I say a Zomato review.

Well, to any one who stays in or near Behala, Haji saheb is the name that comes to their mind when asked about Biryani. Even I had heard a lot about this shop... but sadly never got a chance to taste it's biryani. My experience had been when I had bought an egg-chicken roll from there. Well, it's one of the finest rolls I have ever tasted. The parathas tasted¬† soft, and its was stuffed with chicken pieces. Also, it had egg. I just loved it.¬† Would love to tastw its biryani someday surely.

I had literally stopped going to this place for biryani atleast. You can go if you want to have a plate full of daalda and some rice and meat. That's it. By the way if you are having the biryani really hot then you will not feel the daalda in your tounge but give it 5 mins to cool down and you will feel the daalda chunks along with the meal.

What you can really have here are Tikiya roll, chicken roll, mutton roll ( though I do have reservation on the number of mutton chunks that goes into the roll).

I feel Haji's biryani is any day way better than the usual vanaspati-rich Arsalan biryani. Unlike the rating by ppl here giving arsalan 4.2, I d give the vice a versa. Here the pieces are bigger and biryani rice more aromatic. When taking tandoori chicken ask for "aadha kacha" a term my father-in-law has taught them. They give it well done outside and juicy soft on the inside unlike other places which give it hard or almost burnt! Rolls are better than many famous places!

Haji saheb ,  a restaurant well known to all the  behala residents offers some of the best tandoori dishes. 

A restaurant that has been in business for almost forever, despite of its odd location, manages to attract the majority of the south kolkata population .

Started off as a take away facility, this place now has a diner area, complete with simple decor . 

The moment you enter , the aroma tingles ur taste buds. The places is famous for its biriyani, chaps and rolls.  The price is quite economic and the quantity served is huge.

Haji saheb isn't like a traditional restaurant.  It is not what you would call  a fine dining experience. The only thing that they promise is absolutely tasty food that will make you come to this place again and again despite all the odds.

1.CHICKEN TANDOORI-really nice,4 large pieces of chicken,only for 220 bucks
2.TIKKA BUTTER MASALA-it was good,the gravy was well made,but it could have been more spicy...
3.BIRIYANI-the biriyani was average,with a small piece of aloo n chicken..
On the whole within limited budget it is the best place to dine in..

Located on the busy D.H Road at the Behala Tram Deport Bazar, the filthy surroundings with unruly traffic and over-populated streets can quite be a turn-off for someone who is visiting this place for the first time. In the past 20 years I have seen no improvement of road conditions, etc of this place. But Haji Saheb has always been a glittering diamond in the coal mine. It serves the best (wholesome) Rolls and Biriyanis of Behala. I have tried their Chinese as well, but I prefer their Mughlai dishes over these Indianized Chinese ones. The food here is reasonably priced and maybe for that reason the place is always over-crowded. You have to put in your best efforts (physically) to place the order and then to get it packed, the part everyone would like to avoid. For this reason maybe they have opened a dine-in section upstairs few years back, it has got very moderate ambiance though, so we should keep our expectations low. Overall - If you are in and around Behala then try Mughlai dishes at Haji Saheb if feasible, you will definitely not regret it. Cheers!

Well writing about haji is like i grew up with this restaurant. Being a Resident of Behala Haji has always been one of my favourites. Their rolls are one of the best in the city. Proud to say i have tried ALL the preparations that haji offers starting from rolls to biriyanis to chicken and mutton dishes and even the chinese foods that they serve. I love it. Yes its all a bit too oily but they tastes good. 
Eventually the quality has dropped a bit but still you should give it a try.

The restaurant section is not that spacious neither very good. the take away section is always overcrowded with people as its on the footpaths of the so called BEHALA. Its always very dirty there.

BUT its worth a try. Go grab your rolls

They are famous for their biriyani and rolls...but offlet their qualities have degraded so cn't award them much points...items are often bit too oily.
bt it quiet cheap and pocket friendly... they hv recently included chinese dishes in their menu list...bt the preparation is not yet upto the mark..and price is on the higher side compared to tandoori and Indian dishes :)

Heard so much about haji saheb...thought of trying their famous rolls and oh boy! They truly serve some mouth-watering rolls that you can‚Äôt miss if you are a true food connoisseur!!
The very first thing I tried was their double tikia roll...as the name suggests you would not only find ample stuffed tikia but also a deep fried paratha to go with..the chicken roll and egg roll are worth mentioning.
The egg paneer roll was something quite unique that I've never come across before.Also try lachcha paratha with chicken or mutton kebab.Though you might have to stand in a long queue as you place your order but its worth waiting once you grab a bite of these delicious rolls and kebabs.

One of the most over-hyped restaurants of Behala. Situated just opposite the Behala tram depot its easy for anyone to spot but hard to access. There are two sections of Haji; the ground floor establishment is used for serving rolls and kebabs or pack biryanis while the 1st and 2nd floors are utilized as a restaurants.¬†

Everyone in Behala knows where Haji is and that they serve the best rolls there. I have had the chance to try them out myself and I was thoroughly pleased by the quantity they serve but there is nothing special with the taste or the price. The kebabs are tasty and you could try a few of them but avoid the tandoori chicken if possible. The place holds its business just beside the footpath and hence its a crowded mess whenever you go there. During monsoon the whole place gets muddy and its highly recommended that you avoid eating here because there is an open municipal dustbin just 15 feet away from the spot. You are always welcomed by rotting smell and bad road conditions.¬†

Now coming to the restaurant portion. The restaurant is nothing special, it cant even be called a proper restaurant if you have been to one. the stairwell is too small and if tall enough you have the added bonus of hitting your head a couple of times. Cheap glass tables and mediocre iron chairs is what they have to offer for your comfort. The servers are extremely rude and late most of the time. The food is average. the biryanis mediocre, most of the time the deserts are unavailable, kebabs are something i always try as that's the only worthwhile food there. ¬†

Being a disappointed Behala resident myself I will not be able to score this place more that a 1 or even less if possible. Avoid the restaurant and go if only if you are craving rolls of great proportion at a reasonable price.

Once in a year I must visit this joy of city, and I always enjoy the all kind of food here, one of my favorite food joint for rolls and biryani is Haaji saheb, Locket in a very busy market on main road, Behala, this time before couple of days I was there with the family, had nice chicken and egg rolls, but this time did not tried biryani, but I believe they are very consistent in their food quality. for sure will visit again.¬†

The best rolls in Behala by a country mile. The place is small, but it is always crowded. The smell of chaaps and rolls go upto the main road. Their biriyanis are awesome. They have even opened a ac restaurant upstairs, which is nice. The prices are resaonable, and its simply the best moghlai food in behala.

I must say its the only good restaurant standing among the very few present in the location.Haji is more about food outlet than dining in;the place is known for its rolls(the rolls really are good)...and any kind of non-veg dish.Reasonably priced,the place is always busy in their service.One different thing about this little place is that they store and showcase their non-veg dishes at the entrance which does attract few feisty mouths...

This place is one of the hotspots in Behala located just near Tram Depot Bazaar. 
Though the place over here is very congested, but the food here is reasonable and also satisfying to the taste buds.
 
Biriyani is all time super hit dish of Haji Saheb . The taste of biriyani is unique and authentic. Not too much spicy and neither too much plain. I do love to have biriyani from this particular place.

Rolls and kababs are also tempting and tasty and reasonable foods that one can go for.

Haji Saheb reminds me of Rolls especially Tikia Roll. The Restaurant is small it easily gets crowded up. It's cheaper than the other restaurant's nearby but food quality is not that good it's moderate. My favourite dish here is the Biriyani and Chicken Reshmi Kabab. Overall it's ok and people can try out this place but I would go for the Rolls they are totally worthy of the money.

Two hungry souls at 3:30PM were in Behala and thus decided to go for Haji Saheb. The two had heard a lot about the place but never tried it out. Finally, they went there and they had perhaps their worst experience ever! The two had ordered two plates of chicken biriyani and one plate of chicken hariyali kebab. The food came within 10 minutes of ordering but my God! what a shit that was!! I was the unlucky one among the two as I have found hairs in my biriyani but when complained the attendant totally ignored as if it doesn't matter at all, as the biriyani was half eaten I din't force them to change. And the hariyali kebab  -_- , does they really know how to make kebabs at all? I din't have an idea that kebabs could be cooked so ridiculously. The taste of the biriyani was equally disgusting. 
Coming to the ambiance , The entrance is as ugly as Shit!! In jails the Govt. offer better staircase I believe,  two persons can not go side by side even and two persons can not cross even coming from opposite direction! The AC was alright and the only good part but the decor is simply average.
The staffs were rude and had no idea how to behave with their guests. This restaurant needs serious make over and I would recommend every one not to go to this place if they don't want to ruin their lunch/dinner!!

Now secondly and most importantly ..the food..which is absolutely horrible... me n my friend ordered two plates of chicken biryani and one plate of chicken hariyali kebab.. It looked really tasty..but when we actually tasted it the whole reality changed .. my friend found a hair in his plate of biryani which was absolutely pathetic .. and the taste of the food !! Oh my God ! I never could imagine that biriyani can taste so awful !! Even the kebab was over cooked and didn't taste good ! Absolute rubbish it was!

Its incomplete if you are in behala and you didn't tasted the Rolls & Biryaani of Haaji Saheb...exclusively known for its rolls...this place is a perfect hangout for a roll lovers...I have been visiting the same since 2009 and they have lived upto the expectations

Ambience : For Rolls There is only a standalone counters since rolls are not allowed as dine in option, however their AC section upstairs meant for Biryaanis Chaamp etc. is really clean and good. Staff is courteous & Serving is quick and upto mark. Will Rate 3/4

Food : This is the biggest foodolochy for Rolls, I am a lover of their Mutton Tikia Roll, The crispness of entire Laccha Parantha along with finely polished grounded mutton tikia and chopped onions melts succulentely in mouth. A must try, For Egg chicken Roll/Chicken Roll the peices of chicken are tenderly cooked and marinated flavors the same as an egg roll but too heavy to bite more than one. Wud Rate 5/5, for biryaani yes they can give a good competition to Arsalan and Shiraaz but have to improve on some points. Wud Rate 3.5/5.

The food at Haji has improved a lot over the years. Haji is crowded most of the times. It's one of the few really good roll centers of Kolkata. It has amazing Mughlai food, biryani and rolls to offer. It's mostly a takeaway outlet but it has a small seating arrangement too. If you're in and around Behala, you have to give this place a try. It satisfies your expectations well. 
Cons- Chinese food is BAD and a strict no no.

Briyani and Rolls . The best thing is its reasonably priced. And after tuitions or when I visited Behala, a roll from Haji Saheb would be a must. You cant actually ignore it. The smell of the chaps from the kitchen is surely to lure your senses to walk to Haji Saheb. Its always crowded , or overly crowded but the efficient serving system makes it wow .... maximum you need to wait for 5 minutes.

Even if you do not reside in Behala, and you have the information that Haji Saheb is near Behala tram depot, you can reach the bus stop and then let your olfactory senses guide you to this shop. By the time you reach the shop you will have the strongest of the appetites. I had food over here quite a number of times. No complain on the taste or price, but they prepare it real heavy. I therefore avoid eating over here often. By heavy I mean having a mutton egg roll in the evening will force you to skip your dinner. But knowing this would not stop you revisiting this place. It takes real discipline to avoid this place, even if you know that it would not be too good for your health, such is the taste it has to offer.
I always go for the rolls and kebabs over here.

This used to be my favorite place whenever I felt a craving for Biriyani, roll or just lachha paratha. To be absolutely honest I still love this place but not as much as I used to. This is mainly because the quality has taken a head first dive along with the quantity which is not exactly what I can say for the price. I am big guy and I love to eat(don't we all!) so to be honest I find it difficult to stuff myself up with only one plate of Biriyani nowadays. I honestly need almost two plates. It's not only the quantity of the Biriyani that has lessened but also the size of the rolls. I mean I remember, the rolls here used to be amazingly filling and really delicious as well. I just wish the owners would look into the matter.

Infact I have ordered more food from this parcel counter than any other place around.

Haji Saheb is famous in behala area for its mouth watering chicken and mutton rolls..Recently the taste of mutton tikka roll has also improved a lot..Although non-veg biriyani and chap are equally delicious..The major disadvantage of this restaurant is that it takes quite sometime to serve your orders and the restaurant is not at all spaceous...

I am from behala, and used to visit this place quite often. most of the time I used to have takeaways from here but the dine in is also good....

Their signature dishes i.e the biriyani both mutton as well as chicken are worth mentioning.... and I love their rezala, best side dish for me if I m having their biriyani. Others worth a try are the chicken butter masala. Obviously can't forget the rolls which tastes heavenly and different from the other roll centers. The staffs and their service is very impressive.

apart from this the Chinese which they have started recently, is not at all good, they have lot to improve in this section....

Although their service has deteriorated over the years and opening of an Arsalan outlet nearby in behala have reduced their popularity much, still it can be tried at times....
Soooo if you happen to be in behala, and you r having cravings for biriyanis'.... this place is worth a try...

I am from Behala and was a regular visitor to this place from my school days. Haji is known for its rolls and it is one of the best in Calcutta. The superb lachha paratha along with the chicken tastes heaven. The tikka roll and mutton roll are also awesome. Often the orders for rolls are so huge, you would have to wait for more than half an hour to grab a roll. But it would be worthy as the roll is very good.
Coming to other items in the menu - Biryani was very good earlier but the taste has degraded over time. Sometimes it is too oily and the mutton would be very hard to chew. Side dishes are also not that good with too much of oil and spices.
The kebabs on the contrary are good sometimes when they are well made. But sometimes they are either greased too much with oil or they are burnt while tandooring. The tikka kebab tastes food but the reshmi/haryali are not at all upto the mark.
Coming to the late addition in their menu - Chinese food. Apart from the regular mixed fried rice, the side dishes are pathetic. You won't be able to distinguish between a chilli chicken and manchurian chicken. The schezwan chicken is the same chilli chicken gravy with huge amount of dried red chillies. Nevertheless, the fried rice is very well made but you would not have a proper side dish to accompany it.
Last but not the least, don't ever opt for dining in. The place is congested, waiters not properly trained and lastly the place doesn't have a washroom. Packing food is a much better option here.
Rating the restaurant as 3.0 for their roll, biryani and the childhood nostalgia spanning 18 years.

Good for small eats!! Not an appetizer !!

i am a regular eater at the Haji saheb and prefer its rolls for a supper. The cost is very reasonable and the rolls provide a very heavy meal.
For a heavy meal i would recommend its Fried rice. I prefer its  and they are served awesome.
The Resmi kabab they serve, its a delicacy.
The food served is awesome and the service is very good, keeping in mind the number of customers they handle everyday.

well I'm very nostalgic about this place..as it is where I had my first taste of biriyani and chaap...and have been in love ever since...

Though the place has managed to upgrade into a family restaurant...it is no longer upto the mark...and have really been beaten down by other competitors in the area.... the Chicken Roll is still worth making people come back....you literally get jostled in the crowd when buying a Roll.....

Food may no-longer be that good...but this will always be a special place....

My Sunday dinner came from Haji Saheb. I must say Food has definitely improved over the course of time. I ordered Chicken Reshmi butter masala, Butter Nun, Veg fried rice and chilly fish with salad. for takeaway
Positives first- the MurghReshmi Butter masala and Chilly fish were delectable and succulent. Compliments to their chef! The chicken pieces were so soft that it melted in my mouth. The flavor was just tantalizing. I loved it.preparation was of top end category .. little oily but aromatic &tasty.
The only downside was that veg rice was little undercooked. The rice could have been cooked a little longer. It was also very dry..  
The butter nuns had no hint of butter on them. They were normal Nun rootis but served hot and soft.
Chilly fish and salad was also good.
In total damage was only 385/- bucks for this awesome dinner ^_^ 
Those who want to have good food in a tight budget must visit this place.

Awesome Mughlai items . Specially chicken chap, tandoori. Biriyani is also good. But dont go for the Chinese dishes . Haji Saheb is well knows for its roll and mughlai items.
I also tried Mutton Tikka Dry and Laccha Paratha . Both were too good in taste.

the best in behala by a long way.  I am staying in behala for the last twenty years and there is yet to be any biryani/restaurant which can rival Haji. Yes.of late it s a bit more oily but i prefer it that way. The only place where u have a roll for snack and it is so  filling  that u wont have space left for dinner. The kebabs specially the Rashmi one are really awesome. Another specialty is the Brain Roll -- simly love it although very hard to get after 7pm.

My all time favourite for biryani-----

Went there to have lunch with friends, but came out with a not so good experience.

The price has increased heavily but the quality and quantity of food has degraded in the due course of time. The staff here is not cooperative at all. 

Regarding fooding: 
Never try Chinese here. They make it oily and you have to throw the whole dish.
Would suggest you to eat or take away only rolls. They are good at it. But the contents of the roll has decreased rapidly within last few years!!!

We ordered:
Mutton Biriani: Was cold when served. Could not get the taste.
Hazi Special: The quality has degraded. The last time I had it was in around 2007. It was great then!!!
Chicken Chap: It was the only product I found great :D.

Well,this place is well known for Roll.Mutton roll is a must must try item over here.Chicken roll is also awesome,I had tried Biriyani some months back and it was more than good.
Kebabs are well cooked and delicious.But side dishes are too oily and often I have to pour out extra oils from side dishes before start eating.Don't ever try Chinese items over here.
Dine in will be a worst decision as this place is too much congested and in that case you have to share your tables with others.Most of the staffs are not well behaved.
My suggestion is 
1>for Roll and Kebabs,one can try this restaurant.
2>Take away will be good decision than dine in.

One of the best roll joints in town, always crowded. The paratha in the roll is just right, thick with many layers. The other Mughlai delicacies are great as well. The biriyani is on the heavy and oily side. What beats everything is the wonderful aroma that fills your nostrils everytime you pass by the place - simply irresistible.

Located on the road near Shakher Bazar. But its hard to find in between the hawkers and all.

I have had better food at this joint in the past few months but it is getting disappointing with time.

Couple of weeks ago had ordered biryani and tikka kabab and it tasted lip smacking but 4 days ago when I ordered the same dishes I was very disappointed with the taste of the food. It seemed as if it was a completely different Haji Saheb from where I had food earlier.

The staff is also not well behaved nowadays. They seem to be like doing favours to the customer by serving them food. Well not all of them are like that but it was an overall experience.

haji saheb had extremely good rolls and good quality biriyani 6 months back too. but this time when this time i went there and grabbed a chicken roll the oil content was too much and the biriyani was had too much of oil. the size of roll decreased too and also the prices r too much now. had the haji special too. the taste was just average with no speciality at all. so really disappointed. so my suggestion would be to all behala food lovers go to panna kitchen or arsalan. they taste better

I am ashamed to say this, but till about a year back, I was pretty much unaware of the place. But back then, I suddenly had a craving for rolls, and I found this place making pretty good rolls, so I decided on the mutton ones. I fell in love pretty much instantly. However, the biryani here leaves a lot to be desired, with the heavy use of dalda/oil and tough meat. I had also tried the chaap, which was strictly okay - not very good or bad. The waiting line for rolls during the evening is quite long ... sigh. But this is one of the few good roll joints around the place, so yes, I would go back for the rolls. With extra chillies.

The place is renowned for great rolls.The rolls are really nice and surely worth a try.You will probably have to wait a while to get your rolls but for me the wait is worth it.
The Biryani and other items are just okay.There are better places.The service is fast.The prices are quite affordable.
I would surely recommend their rolls and if you want to try their food and biryani,a take away would probably be a better option.
The rolls I would rate 4.5/5 and everything else 3/5.

Haji Saheb in Behala is quite famous for his Biriyani and Rolls, especially along with their quick service. However, what recently swept me off my feet was their Mixed Fried Rice. I was surprised by their quality, quantity and taste. The taste was awesome, the quality was superb and the quantity was more than enough for a foody like me. There were prawn, egg and chicken pieces in abundance for a person to thoroughly enjoy the entire preparation. Also, the oil content was much less than that in their Biriyani.
I recommend Haji Saheb and his Mixed Fried Rice to all who are reading this review.

I was taken to Haji Saheb by a friend who resides in Behala and was raving about the rolls and mutton biryani. We proceeded to order the Special Mutton Biryani , Chicken Chap ,Mutton Tikia Roll and the Egg Mutton Roll. To be honest I was quite disappointed as the food was extremely oily and the taste was nothing special very standard fare. I would much rather head to Arsalan which is fairly close if I had to grab a bite in the vicinity.

Haji Saheb is the hub of mughlai dishes for those people who live in behala. They have opened up a seating restaurant too. Basically they are famous for their fast preparation of rolls and their fast service. They have a thick roll. 
Coming to the pros and cons of this place

Pros:-
1) service quick
2) reasonably priced
3) serves very good mughlai rolls
4) crowded almost everyday
5) opened a restaurant too even In such a small place
6) kababs and biriyani is also different

Cons:-
1) oil content is a lot
2) very crampy and congusted

Rest all is well:-)

Haji Saheb is no doubt the first option that comes in mind of the people of Behala when they are hungry. Cheap and satisfying foods served and ideal for take-aways. The must  foods to taste are chicken roll and mutton biriyani. Best part of it is, it fills your tummy more then enough and service is quick. But the thing i honestly must share is that its more then spicy which leads to sometimes indigestion but over all a good restaurant and a must visit in Behala.

To a person staying at Behala , the moment he thinks about Biriyani , it has to be of Haji Saheb. I am also a great fan of Haji Biriyani. A very rich in flavour khuska, one aalu  and one big chunk of Chicken . But if you are health conscious then you should avoid it just because it is very rich and spicy and our hand will be oily even if u wash your hands with soap. But certainly very mouth watering.
The restaurant is nothing great, The take away is a much better option if you want to have foods from Haji.
Tengri kabab , Resmi kabab  and Chicken Butter masala are my favourites,
If you are in hurry and want to have a snack, then try the rolls. Egg roll is certainly the best in behala .

If you want tasty food do take it from here and eat at your own place. Thus , it is a must to visit place for the people living at Behala and its vicinity,

Haji Saheb - I was just scrolling past the restaurant list in Zomato and found this place. After seeing the reviews I thought this place must be a good restaurant and I went there . Disaster !
I don't believe that Haji Saheb is the best in Kolkata , it is one of the local restaurants  which get over-hyped ( might be one of the worst restaurants ! :p). The so called "famous" biriyani is a failure to be precise. It has too much oil and 'masala'  in it. However, the take away is fast . The prices might seem cheap but don't think the food is value for money.The salad is so great that it will do the job of chloroform( strong vinegar I think) if you have a sniff at it! :P  !  I ate there just once which made me vomit for the rest of the day !

another outlet of the famous low cost haji saheb. the chicken biriyani is mouth watery and so is the chicken chap. the mere sight of it shall make you hungry. you can also try the equally good vegetarian dishes that the place offers. we had veg pulao, mixed veg and paneer butter masala. the take away has quite a fast service. a very good option for people who live nearby. a personal recommendation would be their mutton rezala clubbed with rumali roti and salad.

This is a budget restaurant so set your expectations right before you walk in or take out. I have never stepped in to have a meal inside but have ordered out multiple times over the past 5 years. Every time we are working late we fall back on this place and Panna for food. 

Considering the location this is a okay option. Ok newcomers couple of road tips. This applies to both Haji and Panna. There's a metro construction in process, so tread carefully. If you are coming from Taratolla Xing then mark the place where you need to take an U. Parking is an issue but don't freak out you will manage. 

I recommend stay Indian ethnic. Biriyani is going to be oily but edible, say not too bad. Try some kebabs. We normally don't try my version of what I call IndianChinese ;) cooks from here in Bengal I think ... 

Do take out. If you are not from around that area hmm see 2km radius, don't bother traveling to this place folks. We do because close to office where we are there aren't much of a choice. 

Cheers.

the biryani in this restaurant is made with tamarind. The biryani is tasty but the Butter Chicken is not up to the mark. the two pieces of chicken was tandoor and it was infused in butter gravy which I didn't like. as a budget restaurant the service is equally bad.

I am a pretty loyal customer of this place and have had been a regular for a decade or more.By far it has been the best place i can think of having a chicken roll at.The mutton biryani is a real treat for any foodie.The AC upper floor has got a recent facelift and is looking really good.One must try the haji special made of mutton keema accompanied by an egg, but it is really oily and might not go down well with many. The kebabs they make are also a good try.
¬†The food is worth the money.

I went yesterday at Haji Saheb. I  enjoyed Special Mutton Biriyani. The taste is good but very oily.
The price is 160/(including 13.5% Tax). The ambience is good. But the behaviour of the staff is very rude. 
I am requesting the ZOMATO Editor please update the price list....

One of the most popular eating places in Behala (Wont call it a restaurant as the ambiance is too dingy).

Rolls are good. But be prepared to stand in a huge queue if you are the takeaway kind.

Biryani is tasty but is very greasy. I was worrying more about my heart more than enjoying the taste.

For any chicken roll lover, the rules for judging a Roll is:
1) How soft is the Laccha Paratha
2) How much chicken is stuffed in it and at what price
3) How good the roll tastes after addition of onions, chillies and optional addition of ketchup.
Haji Saheb wins the chicken roll war for me. The paratha is excellent, the chicken stuffed inside is succulent. 
I found the biryani to be greasier than it should be. Kebabs are worth the money. In fact I found them to be very good. The restaurant is not meant for fine dining so you won't find the ambiance or the service to be good.

Indeed a brilliant place to have the authentic mughlai food. The lacha paranthas and the mutton biriyani is just awesomness. :D
