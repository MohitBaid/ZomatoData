Located just beside Vardaan Market,Shibuji is one of those popular food stalls where you can fill your tummy,with extremely delicious,tasty food at hardly any cost.Pretty cheap, it offers some of Kolkata's best delicacies like Pav Bhaji & Sandwiches along with well-made sodas,shakes as well as kulfi !!

I just love there Pav Bhaji and have 2 favourites among the sandwiches - Veg.American Corn(grilled) = Rs.70 & Grilled Veg.Cheese Macaroni(pasta) sandwich = Rs.90..... (the joint offers ONLY VEGETARIAN food) !!

Give it a try, you'll love it's food.(but keep in mind, it has no seating arrangement & is just a stall)

Good place to hog at when you're a tight budget. Everything out here is good right from their shikanji to chuskis. My personal favourite are their grilled sandwiches. One will usually find it crowded during lunch hours. Even despite the rush, they try to serve you at the earliest possible.

I never knew this places existed on Zomato...anyways, Shibuji right beside the side gate of Vardaan Market. Serving soda, sandwiches, kulfi and its speciality..paan. You have to have the mitha paan at Shibuji to know the taste...it being one of the most popular paan stalls in the city. The ice paan in summers is a relief from the heat and brings the authentic taste of sweet paan.

One stop for your battle with summer. Beat The heat here with their cool drinks or chuski or kulfi. Their masala soda shikanji or masala thumbs up, chsuki all are very tasty and relaxing. They serve it in mitti ka bhaand (earthen pots)  and right opposite to it is some Chaat stalls which serve great chaats. They do not accept cards cash only. The best is orange soda. The pan is average. During holi their bhaang thandai is very good.

This place is known for its pav bhaji but what this place actually expertises in is sandwich! Even I had known This shop for its masala shikanji and pav bhaji,but a shopkeeper of vardhaan market suggested sandwiches from this shop to me and I am so glad I took his suggestion and tried it because-This place serves the best sandwich in this area! There is a sandwich shop located nearby that takes 50-40rs extra for the same variant of sandwich and what they serve isnt half as tasty as those from this place! Their pav bhaji is also very tasty but there are other pav bhaji selling shops nearby that I feel are even better with this dish! However their sandwiches are just the best!! I would highly recommend their sandwiches to everyone!

This place is known for its yumilicious pav bhaji. The aroma of pav phaji is evident in the entire road which attracts the walking public. Kulfi and faluda is a must try here. They have priced the items very strategically even after being placed in the posh locality of camac street. Recommended for all genre of crowd.

Shibuji is a small roadside shop located at Vardaan Market. Its a vegetarian food joint. I have tried their pau bhajis, shikanji and masala cold drinks quite a few times. The pau bhaji is good in taste and available at an affordable price. They also make grilled sandwiches. If you are in for a quick snack you can definitely visit this place.

This outlet slowly-slowly expanded itself from a beverage stall.Before this place use to serve only beverages and was a very known name and with the passing time it expanded itself to a pan shop and then atlast to a snacks shop and still has maintained the quality of service and food.We have tried almost all of their beverages and food and what we loved the most are-
1:Soda shikanji
2:Grilled cheese sandwhich
3:Orange chuski

Right after lots and lots of shopping at Vardhan market or camac Street Pantaloons outlet, we quite often hit this place for quick bites and refreshing drinks. Their sandwiches and pav bhaji are must haves, however my heart goes out to their shikanji which they serve in a kullad. Nothing like a cup of refreshing and tangy drink after a long shopping spree!

A popular place to try sandwiches. Opted for a grilled cheese sandwich here, and it was a sheer delight. The amount of cheese was generous, and the sandwich was grilled to perfection. Ended my meal with the Masala Cold Drinks to digest the food. Value for money, the pricing is quite economical, and won't hurt your pocket.

Shibuji,on the side of Vardaan Market on the Short Street side really  epitomises Street food at its best. Their grilled sandwiches are really good and I particularly like their American corn cheese grilled sandwich. They are generous with the filling of both veggies and cheese,unlike other sandwich joints. Moreover service is prompt and it's value for money. Together with the sandwich one can have their various masala drinks( I love their soda sikhanji and masala Thums Up) to complete the meal at a very reasonable price. If still feeling hungry try their Pav Bhaji,also tasty.( Yum) The place is always crowded but they are efficient and don't make you wait too long.# thankfully # great Street Food.

The pav bhaji tastes nice enough and I really enjoy the sandwiches, with all the gooey cheese and fresh veggies. Pricey, yes, but then it's Camac Street. It doesn't get cheaper than rupees 50 here.

This place is veggies delight. One cannot sit and eat this bringing a vehicle along would be a good idea however in a place like Camac Street one may have issues with parking. 
They have amazing soda-shikhangis and golas that everyone should try once. They have this specific mixed gola which is amazing. In addition to that they sell good Pav Bhajis and Vada Pav, however I enjoy their sandwiches the most (which they serve with chips, ketchup and chutney). 
Go there already!!

Located just behind Vardaan Market Shibuji is phenomenal when it comes to delicious pav bhaji and shikanji and masala thumbs up. It's the party goers destination on their way back home. Shibuji is filled with cars and crowd till late night every day  for decades now.  A wonderful place to hangout inside your car and taste delicious  food and drinks at the same time.  
I remember going to  Shibuji with my friends just to have their shikanji or masala  thumbs up.  It's kind of  a craving you have for Shibuji's food which is hard to resist.  Another best thing about this  outlets is the pricing of the products. The prices are reasonable and not at all dear to your pocket which makes it even more interesting. If you are  out for a long drive or night out then visiting  Shibuji is a must with your friends.

One of the legendary street food/beverage joints of Kolkata, Shibuji is a must visit for people visiting/working in/living in the Camac Street area. A wide variety of options of shikanjis, sodas khas etc along with mind blowing kulfis, above average paav bhaajis and pans to conclude the childish indulgence with. 

Tip: There's another Shibuji less than 500m away for late night afterdrink kulfi addicts. Do try that one out.

Shibuji is just a minutes walk from the back gate of my college,hence, I am a frequent guest at the tiny shack. As soon as you finish having their mouth watering special pav bhaji you can immediately ask for a glass of soda shikanji(an absolute brain freezer) to balance the spicy after effect of the  bhaji. And bingo! They sell thandai(with bhang) on holi. 
And guess what? They are very very pocket friendly. 
Therefore, I don't hesitate to pay a visit to shibuji even at 12 noon when the sun is right over my head ;)
A 4.5 for the place because there is always scope for improvement.

Remember going to this place as a kid. U get the best soda sikangi in the whole world here. And the best thing about this place is that he gives u the drinks in a matki as compared to other places that give u in glasses. The taste somehow ends up better in a clay pot glass. The other things to drink are the rose & khush soda. They also have various types of grilled sandwiches and pav bhaji if u want something savoury.

I do not know how zomato has all the  capacity in the world to find the best food corners around every nook and corner of the city. They do not even spare the street food joints. Well shibuji falls on the was to and back from my college. The first day I saw this near this at the  camac street crossing below vardaan, and saw it was overcrowded. What pissed me was the fact that it was a pure vegetarian joint. The next day I saw the same thing. Then I began to ponder what do they make that people hurl around the shop even though you have to stand and eat. So the discoverer me went to taste it. It was nearly a year that i had tasted pav bhaji. So I ordered for one. And as I tasted it. It was wow. The butter, the lime, the bhaji made me feel as if the world was going to end here. People who love pav bhaji must try this. I guess this is probably the best pav bhaji that I have eaten in kolkata. Please try the soda sikanji its amazing. Also the grilled sandwiches are great. Especially the grilled cheese  corn sandwich. A definitively recommended joint.

I had been introduced to Shibuji by a friend who was a regular there for the kulfis. In fact, her father was the one who raved about Shuibuji kulfis and always took them for an after-dinner-dessert drive. 
Thereafter, I have made several visits to Shibuji, mostly for a on-the-way quick grab/cooling the parching thirst. I particularly love the pav bhaji they make. It has a beautiful balance of the butter and masala in place. The soda shikanji, needless to say, complements the bhaji very well. When you don't want to spend money but be contently full (while in the area or after a crazy shopaholic day at the Vardaan Market/Westside/Pantaloons), visit this outlet. You shall not be disappointed.
Be sure to try the kulfi with faluda too. It cools down both sweet cravings and the heat.

Shibuji has been our thirst quencher since forever.This particular outlet also serves quick bites including sandwiches along with refreshing drinks!Soda sikanji,masala thumsup,rose soda,orange sikanji are amazing. Also their badam lassi is very good. The place is always crowded and you have to wait a little to get your hands on your glass of quencher.Their sandwiches are also good.Worth mention are american corn cheese,veg grilled cheese and bombay veg cheese. However the prices are on a little high side considering other places serving sadnwiches equally good! 
But on the positive side this pplace is amazing for their sherbets and sodas which are all rightly priced and absolutely yum.

Had no idea, how famous this place is - had to pick up something from vardhan market, and on our way out, stopped by for a cooler. 

I had the kala khatta soda - which I mistook for a khatta meetha drink. not really - but refreshing in the heat.
I also tasted my friend's  kesar thandai - delicious.

Wish to try out some other interesting drinks on their menu. Sometime soon.

This thirst quenching wonder prepares some of the best drinks using sodas and aerated drinks and masalas. Masala thumsup, golas and soda shikanji that these guys prepare are the best you can ever think of having! Everytime I am in calcutta I have to visit this place close to Vardaan Market!

This place brings back alot of memories. I am from Bangalore but everytime i came to kolkata i had to come here. This roadside shop has the best sandwiches and i can swear by their soda sikanji and masala thumbs up. This place is light on pocket and gives you value for money. A great place and will try going back soon.

Me n my girl friends were having lunch at a restaurant in park street when out of no where we felt the urge to have gola! The only place that we could think of was this.. credit goes to zomato. We took 3 kala khatta n 1 orange golas. Each costs something around 25-30. Even in the rush they serve quick. Would like to visit again to try out their other offerings.

Shibuji has been our thirst quencher since forever.This particular outlet also serves quick bites including sandwiches along with refreshing drinks!Soda sikanji,masala thumsup,rose soda,orange sikanji are amazing. Also their badam lassi is very good. The place is always crowded and you have to wait a little to get your hands on your glass of quencher.Their sandwiches are also good.Worth mention are american corn cheese,veg grilled cheese and bombay veg cheese. However the prices are on a little high side considering other places serving sadnwiches equally good!

Shibuji had been the fast food hub of Marwaris/Jain's visiting Vardaan market to shop. 
------------------------
Brief and drinks:
Shibuji is one of the most famous shop in Vardaan Market side and serve you with lovely drinks and golas. I had visited Shibuji  long back and i had tried:

1) Masala Cola - Usual coke masala maar ke with crushed ice.
2) Rose sherbet/soda - I love it. Must try.
3) Soda shikanjwi - The best part about this is the ice. Without ice, i don't enjoy this drink. 

At moderate prices, all the three beverages were good enough. I haven't tried the food out yet. I will definitely give it a try on my next visit. :) 
------------------------
Summary:
Location 5/5
Quality 4/5
Quantity of beverage 4/5
Hospitality 3.5/5
Value for money 3.5/5  

It operates very well as there is a market nearby and will continue to operate anytime in future due to heavy demand especially during summers. :)

Shibuji = Rose Gola and Rose Soda.

Story over.

Okay, fine. So this is the deal. I have always been a Rose Soda lover. Without nasty icky lemon and salt in it. The first time I had the rose soda here, I was asked about my preference. As in... would I like it "nimbu maarke" or plain?

It was love at first sip from then on. 

Of course, after a very heavy meal, I love their masala thums up as well. But most of it is being a part of an epic street food journey which one takes on the streets of Kolkata.

I used to frequent this place with my girl when we were in college. Even now when we can we drop by. The first thing that comes to my mind whenever someone says Shibuji is gola chuski. Our favourite combination would be pav bhaji from Agarwals's (close by) and a couple of golas from Shibuji. Man I am getting nostalgic. Try any of their golas. My personal favourites are the kala khatta and rose. The strawberry is not too bad either. Next best item would have to be the sodas, be it kala khatta, masala Thums Up or any of those fizzy drinks with their secret masala mixed in. The pav bhaji is also decent and not as good as Agarwal's but it still can pack a punch. Also worth trying is their meetha paan. This place has a charm of its own and I still continue to visit it as often as I can.

It is famous as it has been consistently serving passer-byes since the past many decades,but the place really needs a revamp. 
Although the chilla waala,puchka waala,googni waala and like which stand there serve above average ,good edibles,the place should now come up with new things and project itself in a new dimension.
The kulfi,googni and chillas are good while the puchkas are a bit inconsistent. Soda shikanji and the like still remains its usp.

One of the first few night evening hangouts during Puja and Diwali shopping... 
This exists from the time where there were no malls, and Vardaan Market was were most of us shopped in ... 

Place brings nostalgia... In those days parents would prefer to make the kids have a rose soda over a cold drink . 
In those days it used to be Rose and Khus sodas, Masala thumbs Up .... and paw bhaji and kulfi ... 
What came in next was the slushes and and slowly meeting up to the crowd's demands they added many sodas and shakes . 

They also have brought in grilled sandwiches .... which i don't particularly like but they are quite popular with office goers of the area. They now also have a Paw bhaji that is jain/diabetic friendly ( without potato) ... 
The paw bhaji and the kulfi falooda is yumm and I love the Soda Shikhanji too.

India's weather is such that citizens have long cooled themselves with frozen food items much before its foreign counterparts made their entry in India. Ice-gola or chuski is one such item which is a delight  for not only the hot humid summers of Calcutta but a wonderful cooling aid for the better half of each year. 

People might wonder what is so special about crushed ice with flavoured syrup. Now, I have tasted the famed ice-golas of India gate and it's weak counterpart in Mumbai but nowhere else have they matched the taste like Shibuji's. Well I strongly believe that taste is subjective. Keeping that in mind if one likes one's chuski with a strong flavour of syrup and the exact amount of rock salt (kala namak) and the exact amount of lemon to make your chuski tangy , sweet and delicious this place is hard to compete with. 

Locating it is easy peasy enough. If one walks on Camac street from park Street this falls on one's left hand side on the lane right adjascent to Vardan market. 

Quench your thirst and cool off with a range of coolers be it the nimboo masala or masala soda. The sikanji is as good as sikanjis can be but i have to appreciate their perfect blend of spices, salt and sugar. In case you like your drinks on the lesser side of sweetness you can customize it as per your choice. 

 I would personally advise those people who like their badam milk thick and nutty since this place clearly uses some bottled stuff making the drink very light in consistency. 

Their range of snacks is ordinary. The pav bhaji's are very delicious but a little shop off Theatre road makes it better. The sandwiches wouldn't satisfy people who are sandwich connoisseurs but is good enough as an evening snack, especially those who prefer going the green way. 

Had it been in my hands I woudl have renamed the shop as Shibuji's coolers because nowhere else have I found better tasting chuskis.

For any student who has studied in a college in this area this naturally shaded shop outside Vardaan market is the perfect place to cool off when the scorching sun reminds you of the advertisement where the sun draws your life out with a straw. After tasting ice-golas at different joints around the city it can be easily established that this place serves the best ice-golas in town. The shikanjis are also very cooling and the perfect way to beat the heat. Though there are no sitting arrangements as is the norm with street food a big tree gives natural shade to the area in front of the little shop where customers stand and enjoy their orders. One should of course steer clear of iced coffee and tea but with their traditional coolers on offer one would hardly want anything else. Since I am not a taker of pav bhaji I have never tasted it and cannot comment on it but my vegetarian friends have all the praises for their pav bhaji. I had once tried their grilled cheese sandwich (which is on offer but is not mentioned in the menu) but for those who have a cheesy tooth it is best avoided. My rating is solely for their coolers. I feel the appropriate name for the place should be 'Desi coolers'.

An old favourite and when your in the mood for junk / street food landing up outside Vardaan Market on Camac Street is always a good choice. The soda shikhanji is my favourite and its the perfect drink for a hot and humid Kolkata day ! The grilled sandwich is pretty nice but my snack of choice is the Pav Bhaji which is one of the best available in the city.

Shibuji's is the perfect place to grab a quick snack and a drink which is light on the pocket too. It does not offer any non veg item but the veg sandwiches are just too good. You get four sandwiches per plate starting from Rs. 45 a plate to Rs. 80. The corn cheese sandwich is filled with mayo and veggies which goes perfectly with the potato chips and ketchup served with it. The quality of the food is superb as everything they use is clean and hygienic (they use Kissan's ketchup, which is a rare sight in the street food joints of Kolkata). The range of golas and drinks are quite interesting too. It totally deserves a 4 as it offers you some awesome, tasty street (and clean) food.
