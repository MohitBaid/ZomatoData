Sipping tea at this place gives a nostalgic feeling. Located in Dakshinapan shopping complex it is an ideal place to have a layover during the shoppers spree for a snack break . Ham and veg sandwich is a hit

I have made innumerable visits to this place and had the same food over and over again. I am fond of hot beverages and they serve amazing tea but this place made me fall in love with iced teas. Their orange and mint julep is personal favourite. Also, the club(ham and chicken) sandwich is pretty good for Rs 150 and they serve crazy good fish fries as well. A must try place for every Calcuttan.
The place is really small and can't accommodate too many people at the same time. Waiting time is quite long. Should be visited only when you have some time in your hand.

A joint frequently visited while shopping at Dakshinapan, this place brags about the varieties of tea that they serve. Went in for the mango tango iced tea last week along with vegetable sandwich. No complaints about the food, it was perfect. The staff however were a little cold.

Really what a comfort zone to sit for a moment to have a adda and when it comes to the food, they really serves some good stuffs to have for. It's basically a tea zone where you can get varieties of tea and their snacks were also tastes good. Hope for a visit again...

Does anyone need a review for this place? Dolly's is an integral part of Kolkata's ever changing story.
Their various takes on every Bangali's favourite tea leaves one mesmerized. Their sandwiches also warrant a mention. The cafe, however, is secondary to the tea boutique where you can pick up various kinds of delectable tea leaves.
So go visit this place if you haven't already.

The fist time I went there was with my cousin & her friend who had come from Mumbai. Even she complimented the orange blossom mocktail & grilled chicken sandwiches that we ordered. The subsequent visit with my friend too has been agreeable...we opted for Darjeeling first flush and Peach Apricot Iced Tea.¬† Finding a seat at Dolly‚Äôs seems to be the only hurdle.....once you manage that, you can be assured of the rest :))

Pathetic people, pathetic service. I went with my friend and ordered some cold tea , those were extremely sweet ... I could drank half of it only , my friend vomitted out the whole thing after half an hour .... If I leave out the food even they do not consider you as a customer as they are busy within themselves....You feel out of place

Terrible service, below average food. Was asked to come back later because the place was a little crowded. When I went back at 2.15, I ordered a ham sandwich and a cup of tea. Was finally served at 3 pm after complaining about the delay. Was told that the delay was because all the servers were having lunch!!! Table was dirty and was given a cursory wipe after being told to clean up. Tea was ordinary and the sandwich was bad. Avoid like the plague.

The best sandwiches money can buy. Freshly prepared right in front of you so you know it's done in the most sanitised way possible. 
It's a tea shop so the tea is wonderful though most times I had the iced variant which was stellar. 
Dolly herself is around most days and she is the perfect hostess. Always smiling and always welcoming. 
An amazing place to enjoy a romantic afternoon or evening which is exactly what I did!
Fantastic.

I do not know why nothing can replace my Obsession for 'Tea' . I sound like a typical bong i know, but i would rather not try to be an exception actually . I visited Dakhshinapan pretty often . Tucked away in a corner , i noticed this paradise for Tea Lovers ... I totally had no idea about it's fame fame when i actually visited the place . The word "tea"¬† in tea shop , glance of a few plants used in decore and a few books kept in inside was enough for me to take the desicion.
Well i am not really justifying the ambience to be impress everyone . If you are CCD person and your comfort zone needs artificial drop in temperature , it will fail to impress you . It has limited sitting arrangement . If you love open air i swear you are gonna visit this place pretty often . The inner chamber rather the room the shop has been aloted has small number of seats where you can enjoy your tea food and i have found the crowd to be very very friendly . You can easily initiate conversation with like minded ppl out there.
I am a fan of roasted Makai Bari tea they serve . I am a regular assam tea person , but if i decide to embrace change , it has to be Makai bari and that too from Dolly's tea shop . They have various flavours of fruit-iced tea . And food is beyond good . I ordered Fish fry once ! It is a must try . And watermelon iced tea is also amazing we ordered watermelon flavoured¬† iced tea with veg-cheese grilled sandwich and it makes a perfect combo . They serve creamy sandwich and quality wise it is nice .
They only thing about this place is limited seats . You get a very homely treatmrnt from staffs though.

I will not recommend this place for hangout. Half of items of the menu are not present. The owner and the stuff are not even bothered about the presence of the other people ,they are just discussing, chatting and making noise. Not a friendly environment.
This place was really messy.
They were very rude, don't even know how treat a customer.they just don't care.
Worst experience I have ever had in a cafe. Food quality not below average.
This was my first time and last time.

Exuding old-world charm, this is a must for tea-lovers.Food is really not a priority when I visit this place, I enjoy the quaintness of the atmosphere and the Bangali-ana adda it provokes. The tea is wonderful and I've been lucky to have my orders thoughtfully chosen and placed by the proprietress after whom the shop is named. Indeed, it is the hospitality of her vivacious personality that to me is the defining characteristic of this place. So much so that I usually give it a miss if she is not present! My family is fond of picking up packed tea from here, the quality is unquestionable.

Visited the shop on Saturday at around 7:30 pm with my gf. It was their closing time. But the attitude of the old aunty was very rude. First of all she said the indoors of the cafe is closed. Then she tried to force the left over prawn cutlets down our throats. While sitting outside when my gf asked to change the direction of the fan, we got curt reply in negative. Finally we went inside to hear more tittle tattle of the pseudo old intellectuals. We ordered dab, orange ice tea with chicken sandwich. The food was OK. But the attitude of the owner and her attendants reeked of arrogance. It seems like the vicissitudes of the previous ruling party has rubbed into this cafe and it is basking vainly on hubris (political pun intended) .As they say old habits do die hard!! With

Tucked away in the corner of Dakshinapan, this cafe is a paradise for tea lovers. It is a small cafe with limited seating arrangement and with no fancy decor. The staff was cordial and helpful and will help you to choose the right tea. We went on a weekday evening and tried out the coconut iced tea, watermelon iced tea, mascatel tea and orange fruit tea. We were thoroughly impressed with this place and promise to be back during our next trip to Kolkata. 

Yes, do not forget to pack different kind of authentic tea whenever you visit here.

Day by day its getting worst..
Todays horrible experiences are as fillows:
1.like everytime they were busy in chitchat,and paid no hid to the guest.
2. The ladies,who serve there are very rude in behaviour,and dnt hv any sense of curtsy.
3.the pathetic  untidy tiny table and chairs will give u the feelings of filthiness.
4.quality of foods also decreased.
5. Today I found a pc of hair in my plate.

Today is the last time of my visit here..I told myself "say no to Dollys" forever..yak,yak,yak..

Awful food. We took brownie shake with almonds. The brownie was old, smelling, tasteless and the base was tea.. There were no almonds. And we took a pink combo..It was tea with rose syrup with some ice cubes. Terrible. And the price were 130 for brownie shake and 100 for the pink combo excluding tax. We even complained. No steps were taken. Horrible experience.

There are always some names which is well known to people and this is one of those. A very familiar name to me, I always wanted to visit this tea corner whenever I was in Dakshinapan. Yesterday I got a chance finally to have one cup of tea to share with another friend of mine. We were searching for a small corner to sit down and munch something to spend an afternoon. And we decided to visit it. As my friend is a Tea lover, she was excited to go there. As it is a small Tea corner and the place was quite full, we chose the outdoor seats. We ordered two Lemon Ice Tea and a plate of Chicken Sausage Salad. They served us really fast. Chicken Sausage Salad could have been better but I liked its smokey taste, chicken sausage was nice. But the main speciality, their Tea- it was a real treat in this humid season. Iced Tea with a pinch of lemon, and a quite sharp taste of tea made our evening wonderful.

Located on the ground floor of Dakshinapan, I happened to chance upon this place while on my visit there. The managers have made no attempt to attract possible customers, it seems ; only a few chairs and table scattered on the outside and barely any seating place inside. When I entered with my mother, most people out there were chatting, probably regulars there and we were hardly recognised as customers with no attention given to us whatsoever. The place is very messy as well - you can't distinguish it as a tea shop other than the fact that they have a menu. The menu too is quite limited to drinks. Anyway, we ordered a Green Ginger Haus, a Green Coconut Iced Tea, and a Chicken Sandwich. The first drink was still better, the second had barely the refreshing feel of green coconuts and they added some orange syrup to it, I believe, totally killing the taste. The Chicken Sandwich wasn't grilled properly. It was extremely runny. The tomatoes were almost coming out. Ins spite of that, the taste was good, I would say.

Overall, this is not a place I would visit again. The old stalls of Dakshinapan are a better option anyday. At least, they acknowledge your presence !

I cannot stress enough how dangerous this place is! Guys, be very careful before eating here or buying the overpriced tea available here. I went here in the second week of January 2017, just 2 weeks before my wedding, to buy tea for my in-laws coming all the way from USA. I have lived in Dhakuria all my life but never went to Dolly's before. That fateful day I went with my mom and bought some bags of tea in overpriced gift bags (later my father changed the tea in the pouches and instead put locally bought tea in them from fear of infecting my innocent in-laws!)Long story short, we bought fish fries while we waited for the sour-faced lady to prepare our bags and that night both my mom and I got the worst stomach infection ever.... my doctor said that the fish was probably stale or served raw and then he suggested that I should be hospitalised. But, I refused to go to a hospital 2 weeks before my wedding and somehow recovered at home, so did my mom. I never write reviews, but this is a warning! DO YOURSELVES A FAVOUR AND SKIP THIS HORROR!

I just had a cup of masala tea which was v v ordinary with floating tea dust.When I asked the price first it was Rs 70 then it became Rs 80/-. When I asked for the bill, the server started hesitating, on asking again he said bill would be 15% taxable. 
I thought the tea was v v ordinary and over priced. 
I was in Dakshinapan and seeing the shop and remembering hearing about it I went for a cup of tea.
Total disappointing rip off. The tea stalls on the road sell better quality tea!

Tea Lover's Paradise!Apart from the variety of exquisite tea prepared from the choicest tea leaves, this place offers you a variety of punches and mock-tea-tails as I call them, The Orange Mint tea being by favorite.For summer coolers you can try the very innovative "Daab-Cha", Coconut water and tea mixed to perfection!There are a variety of munchies available too, try the chicken sausage salad or the grilled chicken sandwich.Brownie points for the amicable decor ¬†:)

There is absolutely nothing better than a sip of iced tea during the scorching Kolkata heat.. me being a tea person i absolutely am biased towards this place because (out of many reasons) this place literally gives u a solution for everything! (I swear,no kidding) .As we already know that tea can be a great healer.. all u gotta do is know which is what.. and that is what this place does to you.. it heals you.. The servers are amazing ,they treat u like ur their own and sometimes also make timely suggestions as to what one should have to make their hardships easy. Not only the tea is outstanding the food should get some applause too.. prices not being very high.. with friends or alone ; this place will never disappoint you.. If u have never visited this place, go right away and visit it..

If you are a tea lover like me,you should definitely try this place. Located near Dhakuria bridge,this is a really small place with both indoor and outdoor sittings. You can try their sandwiches and pasta which will be a wonderful companion with Darjeeling tea you may order. Also,try the Iced tea,it tastes so much better than anything. This is a place where you can go with your best friend or your mother, but try to make it a small crowd. üòä

This is a great place to hang out post-shopping in Dakshinapan (or elsewhere). The food is pocket friendly and good. The best part is that this shop is exempted from V.A.T or any other form of taxes, which makes it a must-go place for poor hungry souls like myself. They have an whole array of hot and iced teas. Among which Darjeeling tea ice tea float, orange blossom, pineapple ice tea, daab ice tea, seems to be very popular. My personal favourite is green ginger ice tea. I just love it. It's zingy, tangy, and with a touch of sweetness brewed to perfection. For snacks there's a number of sandwiches, salads, and cutlets. The chicken sausage salad is very popular and my favourite. It's fresh and filling.@ Their ham sandwich is popular as well.

Great place to hang out post-shopping at Dokkhinapon. Their mocktails are really refreshing starting from the almond brownie shake to the pink champagne. Ham sandwiches and grilled cheese chicken sandwiches are totally worth the money. Having an outdoor seating area, this place is really cool to hit.

An utter waste of money & time without any benefit. Went there with 2 of my friends all of us being tea enthusiasts. Heard a lot about this outlet so wanted to give it a try. Found it inside a shopping market a small outlet with an old lady siting with some of her friends. Tried 2-3 varieties of tea without milk, did not find anything to talk about. The amount of money they take is like burglary. Also tried 1-2 tea with milk just to check whether our opinion changes. But nothing changed, infact my verdict became more emphatic.

We were too tired after shopping and we wanted to take rest. And what could be better than Dolly's tea! We were very thirsty and wanted to cool it off with some iced tea. We ordered a Mango Tango; a refreshing mix of Darjeeling tea and mango dip and a Mango Khus ; another refreshing cooler.
We also ordered prawn cutlet. The prawns were of moderate size and juicy with a thin and tasty batter and a tangy dip. It was so good.
But the best part was the ham sandwich. Dolly's tea serves the best ham sandwich in town, undoubtedly. It melts in your mouth and you will know that it's one of the best things that have happened to you. :D I am in love with the place.

The owner is an arrogant lady. We went for a cup of tea and got confused by their fancy menu. Sonwe ordered milk tea. Not only it was way over expensive, it was pretty ordinary. The lady discussed some bad remarks about us which I overheard.

I felt sad about the environment and wish to never visit there and I also suggest you all that have a cup of tea from the roadside vendor, who afterall would not discuss about you with others and the tea would also be much better.

Nice place to hangout in Dakshinapan and that's it. Food and beverages are pretty average served by very unprofessional staff. Seating arrangement is strange. Although it's always packed up but there's nothing much special about it. Interiors is weirdly different and seems nice. Overpriced is the first thing that comes to my mind comparing to what this place offers in return.

Located on the ground floor of Dakhsinapan (Dhakuria), you really will have to ask your way to this stall.

I'm not a huge fan of tea, but decided to give this stall a try one rainy afternoon.

The cheese sandwich was pathetic. First flush and earl gray was okayish. the teas came in cute cups along with 2 large cubes of sugar.
If you're a tea lover, you'll probably like this place, other than that the menu doesn't offer anything special to write home about.

Been there a couple of times. One thing, according to me they can Improve is their seating arrangements; because on a hot and sultry day it becomes really uncomfortable to sit amidst the market area. Apart from that it's a nice place to spend evening with your friends and loves ones accompanied with some offbeat coolers and finger foods.

Featured under the section of legendary restaurants, this cafeteria is surely one of it's kind. This cafe has been there since the time when there was no CCD or any other cafes in Kolkata. The shop is located inside the Dakshinapan shopping complex approximately opposite to the Biswa-Bangla showroom. The cafe has an uber cool atmosphere which gives you a homely feeling. The interior of the cafeteria has around 3 tables which would roughly accommodate 3 people per table. The immediate exterior of the restaurant has 3-4 tables where 5 people can fit in each table. The outdoor unit is beautiful in its own way as it is shaded with umbrellas and decorated with plants. I have never come across any tea junction as fabulous as this. Along with the restaurant, they have the tea business as well and you may find customers entering not to have something but simply to buy tea. 
Coming to the food,I ordered Mango Tango,Fish Fry,Corn Cheesy Sandwich, Club Chicken Sandwich. The Mango Tango was extremely refreshing and had and amazing taste. The Fish Fries were the best Fish Fries I had in my entire life. They were so deftly prepared that both the juicy and the crispy nature was properly understood which is very rare. I am sure to order the Fish Fries again when I give a second visit to this cafe. The Corn Cheesy Sandwich were awesome too. It had proper amounts of corn,cheese and veggies making it very delicious. The Club Chicken Sandwich was an upgraded version of the Chicken Sandwich. It had 3 breads and 2 layers of fillings making it a sort of double-decker sandwich. The chicken given was in the form of salame and it tasted good. The club sandwich as the name and description suggests is extremely heavy for one person to eat. I will keep visiting this place again and again. The staff here is very homely and the service too is a little slow which makes you enjoy the ambience more. The staff will never poke you for anything and hence you can enjoy the food in peace. A must visit for every people living in Kolkata.

Well this is a heritage tea shop for sure...more than food the ambience is what will soothe one the most! It's a tiny little cafe that has a very homely atmosphere...with v less seating arrangements...outside the shop there are umbrellas under which seating arrangements are made... so you can enjoy both the indoor and outdoor feel...

Coming to food-

Lemon iced tea,Lemon and ginger iced tea,
Mango tango iced tea-
All of them were just awesome and sooooo refreshing and cool -for people like me who aren't much of hot tea drinkers this is a very nice alternative!

Makaibari roast tea- this a variant of hot tea... Dolly's is primarily famous for its rich variants and flavours of tea.Although I didn't try this myself (as I don't drink tea) my mom likes it...

Fish chop- Full marks to this dish! My mom makes fish chops at home and I could get the same taste here...no wonder they serve absolutely fresh food.

Fish fry- This is a MUST TRY! Crisp thin layer outside with juicy soft fish inside-prepared absolutely fresh this dish is sure to drive one crazy! This dish is beyond scales so no marks can actually justify its true taste! Obviously the best fish dish I ever tried!

Veg cheese corn sandwich-According to me, this grilled sandwich is the best sandwich in Dolly's menu! Generous quantity of cheese, capsicum, onion ,tomato and corn in the filling! Recommended!

Chicken sandwich: With a fat layer of filling made with Chicken salami capsicum tomato cheese and onion this sandwich definitely tastes good!

Chicken club sandwich: the same as chicken sandwich just that it's a 3 bread sandwich instead of 2!

Chicken pasta: Replace the bread in the chicken sandwich with pasta and that's what it tastes like! Quantity is hugeeee both in case of the pastas and sandwiches! Finishing one alone, is quite a task!

Do not come to this place if you are in a hurry as the complete feel of this tea shop can't be enjoyed in limited time! Firstly service is very slow it's actually very home-like where there is no one to poke you... actually it's the best place to spend wee time! Food too is freshly prepared so that takes up a lot of time!
I would definitely come back to this place again and again! Honestly, I dislike fish but it's their fish products that keep pulling me to this wonderful place! Their fish products are a MUST try!!

Located within Dakshinapan stores, I believe a concept shop like this is way way better than the set piece Cafes... Very cosy indeed. We ordered 'mango tango' and the 'pink champagne'.... Although the pink champagne tasted much like a known breezer ¬†,it was ¬†refreshingly delicious... The MangoTango was really nice and authentic. All considered, I would definitely frequent this place.

It is a very decent place to hang out and a heaven for tea lovers. Though they have an airconditioned cafe I like the outside sitting arrangement more. The inside cafe place is small and narrow. But whenever you go there you will get a warm reception. I have tried darjeeling tea there, first flush and makaibari roasted, and i am touched. I have also tasted their cucumber sandwich which was okay . Once i ordered ham n chicken pasta. It was not prepared in a conventional way but was nice to taste. Their Brownie shake with Almonds is just mind blowing.

This one used to be a usual haunt for me a few years back, but somehow, with the appearance of so many adda joints around, it got sidelined for months and years. This is the place which made me fall in love with tea, and made me understand that it is so much more than a syrupy hot brown liquid.

Today when i visited Dolly‚Äôs after years together, the place greeted me just like it used to. As I sat down in my favourite corner, a rehydrating shot of cold water with salt and sugar was given to me, along with a cool wet tissue to wipe of the sweat and grime. This was such a wonderful gesture in the sweltering heat of summer afternoons, that I instantly fell in love with them once again.

This is always a great place to hangout with true tea lovers. Unlike all the sleek coffee joints, this vintage shop offers a wide range of teas from the hills of Assam and Darjeeling. Iced teas with fruit infusions are quite lip smacking, specially the peach one. Snacks are okayish. I would say that some of them are a bit overpriced. The sandwiches are quite subtle and simple. One of my favorites is the prawn cutlets. The fish fries are good too..but not worth the price. Overall I rate this tea cum adda joint a good 4.0. Would have given more only if they managed some space and had cleaner tables. :)

The hunt for this joint goes back to ages when my bestie, tanwyee, had spotted this tea shop amidst dakshinapan. I have tried to locate and relocate this joint im dakshinapan.  Inspite of visiting innumerable times, I did not manage to locate this.

Finally after a year or so, my mission became successful, when a very special lady of my life decided to meet in dakshinapan for a cup of tea. Without I word, I jumped and she helped me in locating this mind blowing tea stall amidst all the crowded place.

The tea stall is a small little venture and a shopper's stop when their tummy ache or their legs get worn out or their shoulders get too tired of bearing the shopaholic's bags. Then this tea shop appears as a boon to them,  a refreshing one.

Its real hard to bag a seat in the joint, finally we managed to sit in a corner with no standing fan. I wish the management decides to put in a bit more of tables. 

We ordered for iced teas and a sandwich as it was just a snackie kind. 
Iced teas:
Peppermint lime iced tea- this was basically virgin mojito with a tea base. However the concept was amazing. The mint leaves on the tea liqour was out of its way. So a thumbs up for sure.
Peach apricot tea- another cheers to this tea. I simply could feel the apricot and the peach pulps along with the taste of a tea. 
Chicken and ham club sandwich- this was quite disappointing as the bread was not grilled properly. The cheese failed to satisfy the sandwiched layer and the 'wow' factor was solely missing.

Hoping to try a better dish in terms of food the next time. A quick suggestion would be adding some chicken fry in the "fried" section. At least would increase the option for people who do not opt for fish. The other suggestion would be better assistance from staff , as they are kind of quite rude during rush hours. And of course , a thumbs up for one of the best tea joints in kolkata.

Cheers!!

No trip to dakshinapan is complete without a stop at Dolly's tea. This boutique tea shop predates and out classes all the new chai bars popping up everywhere now. If weather permits it's best to sit outside and sip the summer favourite lemon and barley iced tea or watermelon tea. My all time favourite nibble is still the ham sandwich. Also a good place to buy tea for gifting as they are packed beautifully. Look out for suggestions from Mrs Dolly Roy she is the true connoisseur.

A superb tea joint at the heart of Dhakuria. Sip refreshing ice tea and watch the time pass by. An irresistible cosy ambience puts it in the list of¬†one of my favorite standalone caf√©s in¬†Kolkata. It serves only tea as the name suggests¬†but believe me, you won't cry about that given so many choices when it comes to tea. A must try.

When I visit this cozy place for the first time to give some adda, since I become fan of this place. They have some fatafati cooler's along with nice food snacks sandwich salad's. Outside seating arrangement is also nice. Overall nice place to give adda. Rates are also reasonable.

I stepped into this cosy place for an adda session with my friends since we were in the area.
The outdoor seating arrangement was a boon to us and we were welcomed courteously by a woman whom I presumed to be an owner...we stuck to the hot teas and I ordered a muscatel for myself. The tea came steaming in a cup with two sugars on the side (which is a good thing since i prefer my tea unsweetened and it irks me when someone puts sugar in it without asking ). 
However,the star of the day was my ham club sandwich (thick-yet-soft slices of ham with tomatoes on generously buttered bread). It was drool-worthy.
Will definitely hop in whenever I go in that area.

Came here in the midst of shopping with my friend to try some of their famed teas. We chose to stick to the hot teas as we were craving a hot cup of tea. We ordered Nilgiri and Darjeeling second flush tea,both were average, nothing fancy. Also had a normal cheese and veg sandwich and grilled chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich ws overflowing wt filling of chicken salami and cheese :-). Over all I would say this quaint little place has got some charm :-) . looking forward to visiting again for some of their iced teas.

How the mighty have fallen. The ambience remains of what I remember from my college days...ideal as an inexpensive date, but while AC interiors have been an addition, Dolly Di's absense has led to a drastic fall in service levels. The bloated Mashis on duty are extremely surly and sit around on stools in a posture that is reminiscent of Red-light district Mashis, sans the paan juice and curse words.

Food Wise the Ham Sandwich is as good as ever and the iced teas impress. You can also buy tea leaf here

With most of the standalone cafes and restaurants closing around the city to give way for bigger brands, its wonderful to see oldies like Dolly's going strong and raring. And why not! The place has always been the quintessence and of Calcutta- embodying the Adda coupled with good food. So Dolly's is a place where you can while away your time without a care in the world, see the other shoppers at the Dakshinapan area, pass by, observe people and sip on that exotic Darjeeling tea or munch on a simple but delicious sandwich, if you fancy. It is rarely that we come across a place which has its heart at the right place and Dolly's is one such shop which serves delicious snacks with a lot of heart.

Dolly's is the only tea shop that I have visited. That's because  I don't drink tea. But I love it's cozy atmosphere. It is very difficult to get a place there as mostly lovers come here attracted by its coziness. 
I like the girls working there, they are smiling and warm and prompt in their services. And I love Dolly. Sitting there quietly and taking in everything around her, this beautiful lady is someone whom you wouldn't like to ignore.
I have taken tea with the taste of Aam panna and it is delicious. I also have taken sandwiches but they are ordinary. 
Dolly's, I would say, has a class of its own.

Hidden in a corner at Dakhinapan Dhakuria, is Dolly's tea shop. A quaint little place offering variety of hot and cold teas along with lip smacking finger food. As a teaholic this joint was an absolute delight to me given the range of teas in the menu. I had taken pineapple pitcher that day to quench my thirst and it was awesome. The water was sweetened with "batasha" a common Bengali sugar sweet, that our mothers and grandmas often use at home to make,sherbets. It gave a totally different and awesome taste to the ice tea, none like I have tasted before. It's a must visit to all tea lovers. Definitely going back again.

Dolly's is SO popular but I couldn't figure out why. We had to place the order as soon as we got the menu as the lady taking the order couldn't wait. That was the first wtf moment. Next, watermelon tea and some others mentioned on the menu weren't available. Cool, why do you have it on the menu then ? The Mistea was syrupy, it reminded me of the nasty liquid medicines or syrups you are forced to take when you're sick. Couldn't even finish half the cup for the smell and flavour. The iced tea was relatively better and the. Pasta was kinda different but good. So, don't run behind the name.

To begin with,it is not something worth going gaga over. Even for a tea-lover like me I wasn't really "blown over" by their iced orange tea which happens to be their best. The taste took time to sink in : tasted bitter in the beginning,after a while it tasted nice. But not something I would want to try a second time. Earlier I've had the cake,cheese sandwich ¬†and black tea which was again quite plain.¬†

But in a crowded place like Dakshinapan,having a place to sit down,chat and have tea amidst shopping is quite a thing.¬†
¬†Btw,service is really weird. I found both the women there ignorant and rude.

Well..so even after spending 25 springs in Kolkata, apparently i never visited this ancient tea shop in the heart of south kolkata. Not that i regret it much now after a pretty awkward experience yesterday. Located in the ground floor of Dakshinapan Shopping Complex it is kind of a tea shop cum library. Concept was novel at the time of inception, but somehow it is suffering from mismanagement.

Ambiance - Very clumsy and suffocating. The store space is very small and an attempt of stuffing a lot many things in a small space kind of left me gasping for some air . They have a outdoor seating space which have strong hygiene issues. Fly infested to be precise.

Food - Ordered a Makaibari Oolong and a Fish Fry. They definitely serve excellent tea. The liquor was very flavorful and had a nice colour as well. Fish fry was also nice. Had a thin yet crispy batter coating and a thick white fillet of basa. 

Service - Not satisfactory..they served the fish fry but not any fork or knife. Tea came almost 15 mins after the fry when we almost completed eating. Delivery time is also a bit longer than expected. We waited for 15-20 mins odd at a time when only 3 tables were filled.

This shop is ancient and this could be its USP even now. But, how far it can slog along with the laurels of its past? I believe it's the only place that can call itself a Tea Library- if they had it thought out, it could have been a wonderful thing, na? But, no, It lags behind in every aspects of hospitality tenets which drive today's service industry. The place is shabby; the musty smell coming from inside hardly makes a guest feel ravenous. The tea leaves they sell and brew are good, in fact could arguably one of the best served in the city, but- will that be enough? Empty cups and saucers lying on the glass top tables even after the guest have left long ago; the lack of warmth in the people minding the place gives the place a bad rap. 

P.S. I doubt the Phuchka-Aloo Dum seller that minds their (the husband and wife duo) stall just outside Dakshinapan gate is listed here in Zomato. But, I should mention their name here on this account- their Aloo Dum is the best and their service is also excellent. They deserve 5 star.

Only option in Dakshinapan really to sit down and eat - the Iced teas are nice (I had iced  ginger and mango tango ) though I am yet to try a natural one with strong tea, the fish finger normal and chicken salad basic ( chicken salami cold cut, with raw chopped carrots, tomato, onion and corn).  Being the only option,  there's no option to dislike - how much u will like will depend upon your assocation with the place. Just for the food and drinks -  about 3.5 is a fair deal.

I have been here many a times. The food is okayish. As in the sandwiches and fries are made from pre packaged stuff so it tastes how it always tastes. The sausage salad is a farce though. All it is made of is 2 sausages cut in pieces and bits of tomato, green capsicum,  onions and cucumber mixed with some sauces and salt pepper. The portion is just enough for one and charging it around 150 is really not good.  The main attractions are as the name suggests the teas. Those never disappoint, whatever one orders. The sole reason for giving 3.5 is for the tea.

Dolly's The Tea Shop is a small tea shop situated inside the Dakshinapan Market by the Dhakuria bridge. The second of the monsoon venture in the day. Although the place lacks proper seating arrangement, the menu comprises of a catalogue of options ranging from Fruit blends to great coolers. We ordered the Blackcurrant Tea and the Peppermintea Lime. The former seemed more like a fruit juice while the latter seemed a tad too bitter for my taste buds to manoeuvre. 
Homely place, but very non-professional and not living up to expectations. Average experience.

Some eateries have a decent rating because of the personal memories people associate with it and for the virtue of having been there for a considerable period of time. Dolly's tea shop is like one of those hyped joints of Kolkata. The ham sandwiches are the only thing that is good about the place. That is all. I went there today with my sister and ordered the cardamom tea, fish fingers and ham sandwich. The tea came after ages after they kept asking us what sort of tea we wanted (they don't pay attention). The fish fingers came a while later and they completely forgot about the ham sandwich. In the mean time, the place started getting very crowded and thanks to their terrible seating arrangement, there was no vacant table. We decided to cancel the ham sandwich and when my sister went in to say that, she was asked to wait for a while longer as it was "apparently" ready. So we were just sitting waiting for the sandwich, when a woman came and had the audacity to tell me "if you have nothing else to eat and are waiting for take away, please get up and stand elsewhere". I was taken aback as I was under the misconception that sensible, educated people do not talk like that. When I told her she could have said the same thing in a better manner, she just walked away sheepishly, pretending not to have heard what I said. I immediately walked away from there. I will never go back of course and will convince my friends to do the same. Disgusting and disgraceful.

A nice place to hang out with friends and family in the midst of Dakhshinapan complex in Dhakuria during the hot days of summer. The area though small, gives you a warm and cosy feeling with a unique decor. We had mango khush, litchi T, black current tea, orange and mint julep. Each of the iced teas were equally refreshing having individual flavours. The owner and her staffs are well behaved. You can also sit there with a cup of tea and read from their collection of books. I would suggest its time they should enlarge the shop to accommodate more customers. :)

I was having a headache and the tea made it go away in a jiffy.
We also ordered chicken grilled sandwich which was quite pungent with generous use of freshly ground pepper, but it could have been better.
We finished it off with a slice of warm Orange cake which was real value for money.Perfect, home made, moist cake...

I would say the food not at all disappointed us. Its good in amount, better in cost and best in its own specialities.

but there are things which i may call the flaws,like the space is bit congested and if you are a new face for them then you will really find it hard to draw their attention. As it happened to us,unfortunately!

Dolly's is a fantastic place. Dolly sells tea and snacks. I love her ham sandwiches and iced tea. They are extremely popular in the city. You can buy tea from her. She had many varieties of some of the best teas in the world, some of which can cost a rupee or 25000 a kilo. She'll make a cup of any of these teas if you want. The proprietress is graceful and friendly lady. She and her team of ladies will make Dolly's a pleasant experience for all..

The brew here is good too.. But slightly on the sweeter side. Which normalizes after the ice in the drink melts. The food is homely and it's satiating. So all in all it gets a thumbs up!!

My order-
Chicken club sandwich - huge sandwich with chicken pieces and ham pieces, lots of seasoning and veggies. It was so nicely stuffed that with every bite a chunk of chicken would fall out. 
Orange and mint julep iced tea - nice kick and flavor.

One of the oldest place to sit there and grab a grilled sandwich and tea! Much before CCD and Barista came in city, this place was perhaps one place resembling the cafe ambience.. Quality has deteriorated over the time though, but this place is quite famous among college goers and shoppers in dakhinapan

It's a good place for having a cup of tea. They provide really good quality teas with different types of flavours. Ice tea and sandwiches are also very good. But the sitting arrangement is a little bit stuffy..

Dolly's have been around forever. I guess even my mother visited this place when she was young ?
It is a nice cosy place on the ground floor of dakhinapan. They serve all kind of nice variety of ice tea and hot tea along with some finger foods like sandwiches and fish fingers, prawn cutlet and so on.
It is one of those iconic places where everyone has been sometime or the other. And if u r lucky u get to meet Dolly herself who is the First Lady tea taster of India.

A nice cozy place serves good tea of different flavours, variety of iced teas and sandwiches. Tea is what the place is famous for.¬†
Price-wise reasonable and of good quality, BUT
quite uncomfortable seating arrangement, the price mentioned in the menu is no longer valid AND they charge VAT etc on food but never provide a receipt, inspite of requesting the staff. Quite contrary to the law.¬†
Looking into the problems I am compelled to rate them 2.5, otherwise they deserve 4.

Tea collection is definitely good but believe me, this rating is entirely for their cheap pricing and the nostalgic associations most south kolkatans feel for this place. Otherwise the service is pathetic and so is the seating arrangement. The closing time is 8pm though they will treat you as an intruder if you walk in at around 730pm and hardly will you be in a mood to enjoy your sips with a waiter/tress sitting on your head like an invigilator in an exam hall after the final bell.  Sometimes they also forget to serve sugar cubes with the tea. The crockeries are also not clean. The place is running mainly because it serves good quality at a cheap price and this is the only decent cafe type place in Dakshinapan (not really considering the other stall kind of options).

Visited this place with two of my friends yesterday. They must improve their seating arrangements. Had one ham sandwich along with some fish finger and fish fry. Food is okayish. Nothing that deserves special mention. Had a cup of Shalimar tea. It tasted like warm mirinda. But I likes it somehow. Good place to sit and try out various kinds of tea.

This is heaven on earth! I know many people are partial to their ccds and baristas. But let's get real. It's not always about being hip and brand value isn't everything (though I'd like to point out that dolly's has its own brand value which tea drinkers respect widely). However everything aside, this is a snacks and coolers joint and located at the heart of dakshinappan, it is a shoppers respite. In the summer heat, when the sun is fully ablaze and merciless, dolly's is your saviour. It's wide range of punched juices and sandwiches that are fresh and filled with healthy veggies. They don't take it low and load up on the sandwiches. The salads can improve though. I love their peach brew and the tea selection they have us breath taking. Though the inside space is scarce and one has to be lucky to get a breeze of the ac, but when you are lucky, and you get a whiff of the inside, it's like being on a tea plantation in darjeeling. A tea drinkers delight! An absolute favourite summer haunt!

Irrespective of what the reviews on Zomato say about this tea joint, I would say, I loved the place. This was my first visit there and I had a lovely experience. A small tea joint run by Dolly Basu and associates, serves various varieties of Indian tea ranging from Uttaranchal, Nilgiris, Assam and even Darjeeling ones. The place though is  very small yet has excellent interior decoration. The exterior seating arrangement comprises of 4-5 tables with a few chairs, which I must say is a perfect photogenic background. Having visited at an odd hour, there were no other customers except us. The iced-tea collection there is quite praise-worthy and I really didn't feel the price to be excessive. It easily fits your budget. We had Mango Khus & Dolly's Ice pack, absoultely refreshing ones and grand in taste. Plain Cheese sandwich there is  quite a "paisa-wasool" one, and nowhere else can you get better ones at a minimum price of 30 bucks. Dolly aunty's amiability touched me. She clicked for us and even requested us to visit again. Well, all I want to say is that you won't enjoy there if you  visit with a large group. It's a perfectly cosy place for two, at the most four. So go, enjoy and refresh yourself with her oozings, this summer.

The Famous Dolly's Tea Shop utterly disappointed me when I finally decided to visit it for the first time last week.

Lack of seating did not deter me and we waited for seats which are finally offered to us inside the tiny shop. One foot inside the door and I nearly gagged on the strong odour of fish and oil. Nearly 4-5 people are also inside sipping their cups and glasses if various concoctions, how I am yet to fathom. My friends and I tried to make small talk but seeing a table being vacated outside we literally jumped out of the shop to occupy it.

Undeterred and totally convinced of the popularity of this joint, we took to ordering tea based drinks for ourselves. We ordered two of the Iced Masala Tea and a ginger lemon tea.
The iced masala tea was horrible, with some syrup added to flavor the tea, ended up becoming a nightmare to drink! The other beverage was passable.

There are many different types of teas available inside the shop, in loose and packeted form for those keen to try.

However, I would definitely avoid this place from now on.

The small quaint shop amidst all the hustle-bustle of Dakshinapan is a nostalgic spot for many of its regulars. It's history and uniqueness (for being one of the only tea shops) urged me to pay it a visit. Sadly, it disappointed me in all parameters. The 'tea's had a different (read unpleasant) taste, food was overpriced, the place too cramped and hygiene is a concern. The place had a strong odour which did not add positively to the ambience.
All in all, I felt Kolkata should have more 'tea shops'!

Dolly's is like an oasis in the midst of all the CCDs and theBARISTAs. Make no mistake its a TEA SHOP not a COFFEE SHOP. I had a Brownie Shake and a Grilled Chicken Sandwich. The Shake was great without being overwhelming. I could actually  SEE the brownie and the ice cream .Unlike other joints you don't have to order any extra chocolate sauce or ice cream-its all there.You could actually see the chicken salami in the bread was fresh and simply yummy.Its pocket friendly too.So gaonwalo stop clicking great pictures of food.Have some great food instead in a frills free atmosphere-who knows you might bump into a long lost friend. That's the power of tea.

I have been frequenting this place many years since now and dolly's tea shop has been my must-visit tea joint whenever i drop by dakshinapan market. Its a very old joint and way back then it was the only place in dakshinapan where people could relax over a cup of tea after their tiresome shopping time and hence most of the time it remained crowded and since its not very spacious from inside,it was really a problem to get a table. With time more shops opened but our 'dolly-di' never lost her customers. The place is very easy to locate,though its very small and chairs and tables laid in irregular manner which makes it a bit uncomfortable for the people to sit and enjoy their orders. It offers a variety of teas..and some snacks even which has got a typical home-made tinge to it. I have tried almost everything in their menu and find each and every item satisfactory except their iced tea which really makes me sick due to its high amount of sweetness. The staff is also very good and unlike other places here they only recruit female staff among whom 1 person i remember has been working here quite long. They are very hospitable and make it a point to accompany their customers always by talking to them while they indulge in their favourites. The place is dimly lit and therefore is perfect choice during summers. They even sell the different types of teas to their customers who are tea lovers(like myself) and are willing to buy them. Sometimes they do force you into buying the stuff still i never needed to be forced for buying them because i always tend to taste different types of tea. I rated it 3 only because of its uncomfortable seating arrangements and the small space they have and mainly because of the iced tea which i didn't at all like the last time i dropped in here. Other than that,this place is worth a try!:-)

Like a ton of others sprinkled around the city this place spells nostalgia to me. Evenly tugged at a corner on the ground floor of Daksinapan shopping complex, this little tea joint is forever bustling.
Once a fan of this cramped little space serving great Iced Teas and decent snacks, its only sad to disclose that last few visits have spoiled it all for me.¬†
And here, I give you my reasons,
1. Peach Apricot Iced Tea which used to be a favorite has turned into a large glass of syrupy orange drink which lacks both flavors of an Iced Tea and the old refreshing tang. Lemon Barley Iced Tea probably empties a whole jar of sugar granules into a single glass!
2. They should seriously check the price for a plate of (packaged) Fish Fingers that comes with a few, sickly little pieces.
3. I was pretty confident about their fusion experimental teas since they never disappointed until the last time when Coco Tea ( Chocolate infused milk tea) turned out to be a disaster.

The only one thing that still makes me wish to go back and retains its freshness and taste is the Grilled Ham Sandwich though the price has rocketed up suddenly and I sincerely wish this one last thing to remain the same.

Overpriced considering the quality and quantity of food served. It was my first visit here. Since its near summer so we ordered fish cutlet along with mango tango and orange mint refreshing drinks. The joint is stuffy and cramped up with too many talkative staffs around. The bill as per the menu was 230 bucks but they charged 250 bucks without even bothering to give a hand written bill leaving alone a proper bill. They also sell tea leaves of various varieties.

My recent visit to the place was not at all enjoyable. The food that they served was not presentable..the ambience was also quite uncomfortable..they served the food at one corner of the table somehow. The lady who took the order was showing least concern towards the customers. When I asked for the bill she came up and said '200';but wat I ate was worth ‚Çπ160.. If they charge tax they should atleast gv a bill...a very unpleasant experience overall.

A very old tea joint,run by Dolly Basu and located at the ground floor of Dakshinapan Market. A very small outlet, but keeps up with the tradition of tea-drinking. A variety of teas are found here, under the special care of Mrs. Dolly Basu, who is a tea-connoisseur. My favourite is the first-flush Darjeeling tea and the Makaibari tea. 

If you are a tea-totaller, this is a do-not-miss.

I have been seeing this so many times, both at Dakshinapan and on zomato.. and we had discussed so many times with the thrill of experiencing good tea. Such a shame - all that turned out to be a waste of time. A cramped little space, outdoor seating overshadowed by smokers, indoor too loudy from the conversation of Dolly-mashi and associates to have a decent conversation. A khawa -tea that was jumbled up for some other tea... a pink champagne that did not really taste good..seats too uncomfortable to sit properly.. huge rush to close down the place at 7:30... the list goes on.
I am not repeating again and i would not suggest unless you have to buy some tea ( as in tea leaves - that too, quality i can't assure - the tea they served did not really impress me ). I did not get any clue why people are raving about the place.. maybe my mom makes better tea that's why ;)

This place has got its own heritage, no wonder! They pioneer in their concept. The quality and ambience that they have created with time is definitely appreciable.
But ufortunately...! In my recent visit to the place I found few things that highly deemed the respect I had for this place.Firstly the cups and plates that they served us in...broken and too cheap for the name of the place.Also we have ordered for a chicken club sandwich which was served in a quarter plate...too too small for the bread to fit in properly and the plate was totally messed up with bread crumbs. The presentation was pathetic! Secondly the chairs in the outdoor area were all in bad condition. Too bad for someone to sit on it.Anyway still manageable.
The worst part that struck me was... A old couple had come and they sat in the outdoors..as soon as they came they were presented with the menu and asked for the order. The man said that they wanted two cups of tea without milk and sugar.Just that.The female from the shop got a little irritated and kept pestering the old man for ordering something more with a bad scowl on her face. The man,  with a smile, insisted only for a tea. Finally she left with a very bad expression on her face.
This incident caught me and my friend's eye and we were really disturbed to find that a place like this presents people on their behalf who donot have the basic courtesy on welcoming customers. I mean why are these things not brought up to the owner of the shop or someone who handles the whole affair?!!??!!
I visit Dolly's often and I really like the place but yes they need rectification.
Just because you have created your name quite successfully, does not mean you donot need maintenance of that further. Most importantly Do not take your customers for granted. Keep a check on your staffs.

My first visit to this place was when I was in school; a refreshment stop after a hectic pujo shopping. I probably had orange - mint iced tea and chicken ham club sandwich. I was completely blown away!!! Later during our college days and even now, when I visit that place, I just can't get over that feeling of having the yummy sandwich - chicken and ham with hot molten oozing out gooey cheese.... I'm drooling even with the thought of it!! Best part of Dolly's Tea shop is that they still maintain that familiar cane - decor... a very simple homely atmosphere! People who haven't tried it yet.... I would recommend that you give it a try soon!!!

If you are a tea freak then this is exactly the place you ought to be. Call it my inclination towards my birthplace (ASSAM), but, I find tea to be the most energising and refreshing of all drinks. Not everyone can prepare you the perfect cup of tea as it requires the perfect blend of aroma and taste but Dolly's does this with elan.
My first experience with Dolly's was not that good as the chicken sandwich was not satisfying. On another occasion, the platter of chicken sausage salad , I had, was utterly disappointing, as some of the pieces were almost uncooked.
However, the last time I visited the place with my friend, we had ordered Tuna Salad, Green Coconut Cooler and Sweet Mango Cooler. I tasted Tuna for the first time and hands down I was overwhelmed by the taste of the dish. The fish was processed and garnished with fresh vegetables, salt , pepper and shreds of cheese. The Green Coconut Cooler had a blended taste of Coconut and some other flavours that I was unable to recognise...but it tasted great. The Sweet Mango Cooler was another refreshing drink and the sweetness was perfectly complemented with a pinch of salty and sour taste; which did not make it too sweet and hence gave it a 'sweet and sour' taste.

How can I not write about this place. I am not at all a fan of TEA. I have always loved coffee. I could never think of visiting this place. But after visiting, it has completely changed my love for tea. I totally love the Ice teas and the mocktails. The peppermint ginger tea is perfect on a hot and sultry afternoon.¬†
I absolutely admire Dolly Ma'am. She is such a wonderful person to talk with. Whenever we go, she recommends drinks for everyone. The pink champagne was a winner! Oh and the sandwiches are pretty good as well.

Every visit to Dolly's Tea shop is a memorable event..... The ham sandwiches are to die for .... But the hot selection of teas are wonderful
One can select from a wide range of oolong or Assam or Darjeeling teas , with equal emphasis on the flavoured cold teas too.
I had friends from Bangalore visiting just before the Pujas and I took them to this place . They enjoyed the teas and the quaint ambience.
Definitely a place I would recommend to all , though the seating outside is limited.

Dolly's tea is small tea shop in dakshinapan market complex. The place will be poorly rated for space, ambience but when it comes to the core purpose of tea culinary, this joint has done it all. Coffee shops are abundant all over the world ,but custom tea shops with moctail offering's like dolly's are few. 

My choice of tea was however not a variant of ice tea or a tea moctail.  It was a hot tea of fine darjeeling blend called 'muscatel'. After sipping, a tea fanatic like me must say that "I am bowled out" & now stand as a "poor captive of the muscatel of dolly's".

If you have not tried the endless types of teas here offered by one of India's first and famous tea-tasters and yet you have been to Dakshinapan Shopping Complex, then my friend you are surely missing something!

I visited this place after my retail therapy at the Dakshinapan market in Kolkata. I ordered for a Ginger Iced Tea and Cheese Sandwich. The iced tea had a perfect blend of Ginger, tea and mildly sweet. Along with that, I enjoyed my classic cheese sandwich - the breads of which were buttered (used nutralite or similar) and the cheese was rubbed with mustard sauce, mildly. Perfect combination with any of the iced teas you might like to order.

The food was served really fast - wonderful service.

The place is like home away from home, you can sit, relax and have a laid back time. The ambiance, as you can see in pictures is wonderful, yellow lights all over with teapots and teas all around! It is a niche yet loveable place in terms of ambiance and service. More like tea rooms across India. 

Service: 3.5/5
Food: 4/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5
Value for Money: 3.5/5

I have been visiting this place for some years now and always enjoyed my cuppa. But last week was such a let down. While the tea and snacks were still good and well above average the place has become so dirty and smelly! Sorry, you cannot be expected to sit in a hot room (with cooking and tea making going on) and enjoy a cup of tea in the middle of summer. And neither should you be expected to sit outside with the stink of the sewage floating up. CLEAN UP YOUR ACT PLEASE or make it into a tea selling shop only.

If you are in Dakshinapan Shopping Complex it must be a ritual to visit Dolly's Teas shop. The place can't be missed as it is bang opposite the Biswa Bangla showroom on the ground floor. Its a nice little cosy place to sip tea surrounded by books and compact discs and other nick nacks.¬†

Since it was a Saturday and the place swamped with puja shoppers, we were really lucky to get a table outside. Ordered my favorite ham sandwich which was nicely grilled with sliced ham and vegetables and tasted heavenly. My accompaniment with the sandwich was the Makaibari Olong served with two cubes of sugar. We could not resist the temptation seeing a couple polishing off a plate of chicken sausage salad in the opposite table and decided to order one for ourselves. The sausages for mildly heated, nicely cut into small slices garnished with onions and capsicums on the side. My friend ordered a browny shake with almond ice cream which was out of the world.¬†

If we were only not stared on by people waiting for a seat, I could have sat for some more time and enjoyed a few more cups of Darjeeling tea!

Don't laugh - but for the longest time I was under the impression that Dolly's was run by the late Jyoti Basu's daughter in law Dolly Basu (what? I"m a probashi Bangali - don't judge). Then I figured the d-i-l Dolly is a soap opera actress and this Dolly is a former tea taster. Their tea is very fine but their USP is their mixed concoctions that you can sip for hours as you hog one of their limited tables.¬†

Which brings me to another point - come early and hog a table - the place is tiny and tends to get filled up. It's a great people watching spot and gets an interesting assortment of characters - famous journalists, models, aspiring artists, yuppies on vacation. But be nice and do keep ordering things and don't nurse the same drink for eternity. Dolly has created an awesome space and I'd be only too happy to see it thrive.

A perfect place for tea lovers. Dollys has been in existence since the day i can remember. Their ice tea could called the pioneer of the ice-tea-lovers-revolution in India. They have the finest choices of tea to be bough. Situated in a small shop in Dakshinapan,Dhakuria it is a must visit for all.

A nice tea bar in Dakshinapan Shopping area by world's first lady tea taster, auctioneer. The ambiance is good and rustic.¬†The price ¬†does not pinch one's pocket. Wonderful place to taste second flush , orange pekoe and other grades of Darjeeling Tea. A talk to the owner is enlightening. A must visit place for anybody interested about Tea.

This is one place I have been frequenting since I was in school. Then had chat sessions with friends when in college, and now as a woman I still enjoy to sip a relaxed cup of tea (hot or cold) after a shopping session in Dakshinapan. I also like a plate of warm pasta or fish fingers alongside. In all makes a pretty filling meal without taking any toll on your pocket.

After a good shopping at Dakshinapan this is the place to sit have a chat and enjoy the awesome quality of tea. I would suggest all the people living close by to definitely try this place.

tea at dolly's never seems to lose its charm, even with the avalanche of so many new cafes in kolkata. everyone has a favourite out here, mine being the makaibari roasted. in the terrible heat, i prefer the T-Shake though, or the iced lemon and ginger. 
the place is always bustling with tea lovers, and its quite hard to get a seat sometimes ! they also serve some nice savouries to go along with your cuppa- ham pasta and chicken sausage salad being the latest additions. 
it also serves as an energy booster before you jump in to your shopping spree at dakshinapan, the shopping complex where this is located !
the only drawback is, it closes a bit early,at around 7pm.....

I can‚Äôt think of any better tea serving place than this quaint joint ‚Äì Dolly‚Äôs ‚Äì The Tea Shop. I have always been a frequent visitor to this place and can‚Äôt think of any other tea shop in the neighborhood with a great value for money. Do try the Darjeeling and the Peach and the Mint iced teas. As an accompaniment try the grilled sandwiches.

For the evergreen tea loving people of the city and all the others this is one place where you must visit and don‚Äôt forget to carry that Makaibari leaves for home.

I love Dolly's Tea Shop. The variety of tea available is extremely attractive for the avid tea lovers( which I am).  Although I don't leave in Kolkata, I would like to go back to the joint whenever I visit the place. 
There is just one complain though, the people serving there or the one running the place ( most of them women ) do not smile at you. They seem to be in some continuous mourning????. If only they would give the customersa warm welcome , that would a cherry ????on the cake????. So please ladies , you are doing a fantastic job by satisfying us tea lovers, just SMILE. ????????????????

My friend insisted me to try the place .. He was familiar to the owner and the people who served here .. Was not in a mood to drink coffee so my friend suggested something new along with fish fingers ..my tea came with a scoop of ice cream in it.. The fish fingers were a bit thick on the coating but the taste was good.. Overall a fine experience .. The staff was warm n friendly .. A good break from ccd n barista..

Good old Dolly's is my go-to option when I am in the vicinity and have to meet a friend for a quick cup of green tea. The sandwiches here are above-average and the fish fry+kasundi is total VFM. A meal for two would cost around 350. Totally worth it.

Dolly's The Tea Shop is as old as I am. But for some reason or the other I could never set my foot inside the charming li'l shop until 2 days back. 

"The best tea in the world - Makaibari - Rs. 13,000 per kg" - a tag was plastered on tins of the supposedly best tea ever...right in front of where I took my seat inside *ample curiosity creeps in at this point*. 13,000 bucks for a kg of tea! An elegant old lady announced to Ms. Dolly - the owner that she comes down all the way from Salt Lake to get the tea leaves from the latter's shop at Dakshinapan. Kolkata surely boasts of many a tea connoisseurs...

I opted for a chicken salad and an iced tea which goes by the name  Pink Combo (Pomegranate and Ginger) which starred under the section - Dolly's Latest Novelties on the menu. What I loved more than the food was the unpretentious behavior of the server ladies. 

I am coming back for their much raved about grilled sandwiches and maybe a cup of Kashmiri Kehwa soon :)

This was my first visit since I have heard a lot about this place but could never make it here due to some reason.
And when I finally made it, guess what it was? Their 26th birthday.
Yaaay. I made it to Dolly's on their 26th birthday .
They offered us cake and samosas. J ate up both the samosas while I fiddled with the cake.
It was a chocolate cake.
This place reminds me of my home because it is so heartwarming and nice. They talk in bengali, no false mannerism and no complexity. 
Just tell your order and they lovingly serve it. An extremely homely ambience. And outside seating gives you a good reason to have a hearty chat while you enjoy the breezy wind.

We ordered : :
 
Orange and mint julep.
Peach and apricot tea
Ham sandwich
Chocolate cake with ice cream

Orange and mint julep was so refreshing. I loved it.
J loved his peach and apricot tea. It was too sweet for my taste.

The very famous ham sandwich comes in a grilled bread with ham and veggies squished in them.
Do not expect fine standard of food. This is homemade quality food that you need at times for a change.

Chocolate cake with ice cream was nice.

Coming back soon.

Cheers! :)

Landed up at Dolly's Tea Shop after ages yesterday, and got a pair of empty seats outside. As we sat down, a dog sat down right beside us and looked at us with calm resolve and gladness. The woman in charge, Mili-ma, came out, gave the dog a biscuit by holding it in front of his face. He graciously accepted it and walked away. We ordered a simple fare - two strong teas with ginger and milk and one plate of ham sandwich. 

The ham sandwich consisted of sliced ham and vegetables squished between two slices of soft white bread and grilled. Perfect with the strong tea, which came with two sugars on the side, just the way I prefer it. We also ordered a green tea after some time, while we were sitting and having a chat. Our bill came to around 200/- after this and my friend was extremely surprised to see it, since he's from out of town.



----- 12 Nov, 2013 -----

A home away from home for me, really. I will be biased here and give this place full marks... for being the place which gives me one of the best ham sandwiches I have had in Kolkata, reminding me of home-cooked food. Add to it a reviving cup of tea and a lot of adda and Mili-ma standing in the corner supervising everything, and my day is set. I am also a sausage lover, and can sit here for hours nursing a orange-mint and a plate of sausages.

I have been to Dolly's Tea Shop for quite a few times and it is a perfect place to indulge into some light snacks, with a refreshing cuppa tea and loads of talks with friends and family! I like the way the interiors are done and the ethnic look of the place. However, I prefer sitting outside, to observe passerbys and gulp the yummy sandwiches! I am a tea addict and I have always ordered for CTC (strong & Gutty) here, along with Chicken Grilled Sandwiches! Last time when I visited Dolly's, my friend had ordered a Ham sandwich for himself and a Lichi T. As I am not a big fan of Ham, I heard from him that it was yummy!  Dolly's Tea Shop is a perfect blend of coziness, good snacks and a lot of talks! Whenever I am in Dakhinapan, I am here and I wish all the best to this place for future!

This is one of those shops whose stories you'll hear from every generations. I heard about Dolly's from my parents, my uncles,  friends, colleagues and many more. I really love coming to this shop. 
Now coming to the review, the extensive varieties of tea that you'll get over here will leave you amaze. I have tried quite a few. And each 1 has its own distinctive flavour and colour. Also their Ham club sandwich is a must try. You can also buy your favourite tea. And if you're lucky,  then you can even talk to the owner Mrs Dolly. She's really nice and jovial kind of a person. Only two things that go against them are shortage of space and the time they take to serve the food. But still, I'll visit Dolly's as many times as possible. 
Happy eating :)

Have been going here for years. I love their ham sandwiches. It is conveniently close to my place and my university, so whenever there is a craving for ham sandwiches and flavoured tea (cold or hot) I head over here. You can go on talking over the food. You pay after you are done, they don't come chasing for you to empty the tables (unless there are people waiting) or pay up the moment you are done (unlike some other corporate establishments). They have recently air-conditioned the inside but we love sitting outside. Not many know this, but they also have a take-away system; fancy carrying the ham sandwiches for later? Do so. They are pretty good, it is like something you would make for yourself at home, not some tiny portion you will get outside. I love their iced green ginger tea as well. This is what I mostly order whenever I am here. I don't understand the need for having anything apart from tea and ham sandwiches over here.

Dolly's tea shop might be a perfect adda spot serving the best tea and sandwiches for many, but I associate with the place in more personal ways than one, the best part being knowing Dolly mashi and Mili kakima. Just to add to the information, I know Dolly mashi from even before I was literally born. :) The tea circle is after all not very big and generally everyone knows each other, and thanks to my father being a tea taster I have had the opportunity to know such a wonderful person like Dolly mashi so closely. And about Milili kakima, haha, you just read it right, she is my own kakima. 
Dolly's Tea Shop was my free tit bit collecting getaway when I was tiny. :) Now that I have grown up, the ambience just feels so right and welcoming as an unbiased soul. I love the chairs outside where one can sit and share a cup of tea and slurp up the pasta or sandwich without bothering about the rest of the world. Passers by wait for their turn, grab a bite and leave, and most of us sit and sit for time immemorial. Probably the best point about the food here is the touch of love and homeliness. It is fresh, light and tasty, which people can come back to almost every day.  (Ask the JU-ites about this! :P) I love the brownies they make here (secret recipe, they say!). Gooey, chocolatey, a perfect one to go with the iced teas. 
Also, something that probably runs in my blood and I appreciate well is the perfect brew of a tea. Each varierty of tea requires a certain time for soaking and probably none understands it better than tea tasters and tea cafes. So if you are looking for a perfect brew to sip and take tea back home, visit Dolly's Tea Shop! (Wow!that feels like a promotion! :P)

Dolly's Tea Shop is one of those places that I have a real soft spot for .... its one of my favorite ways to spend a winter evening after work. I love the familiar look and feel of this place and its funny that I relax almost instantly the minute I find a place to sit no matter how crazy a day its been. This place has character right from the cane and bamboo stools to the old tea-chests that are used as tables inside the tiny shop though outside they have gone for wrought iron tables and chairs. The food for me is akin to something I would get to eat when I would go visit an aunt rather than a dish with a  formal fancy cafe feel. If its a balmy summer evening try out the Iced-Tea's .... check out different unusual flavors like Pineapple, Orange n Mint , Strawberry and Khus .... just lovely and refreshing. For rainy evenings or in the winter months try the Darjeeling Selections which are lovely or the Hot Lemon which I love the way they make here ..... In case the hunger pangs strike you try the  very famed Ham Sandwich .... or munch on the Prawn Cutlet or try out the Jam and Cheese Sandwich and if your in a sweet mood order the Orange Cake. Its great to go carry a book and sit and read and enjoy some me time or go with a couple of close friends for a lovely chat. I would pick this place hands down over the Costa's , CCD'S just for the  vibe and character it has .

Dolly's Tea Shop is an institution for innumerable citizens of Kolkata ! Its USP of being a cosy , homely place where you can get yummy food and excellent tea is unparalleled and its legion of fans keeps on growing. Unlike eating shopping is my least favorite past time but I remember accompanying mom to Dakshinapan Market only so that I could pay Dolly'S Tea a visit and gobble down my ham sandwich and iced tea .... these till date remain my favorite items to order there ! Its like a melting pot of people ... older folks as well as the young ones flock here and the fact that its affordable and pocket friendly only enhances its appeal. For those of you who are not bowled over by the gloss and glamour of the CCD's and Baristas ... rush across and sit back and savor the real thing !

I had heard too many good things about this place before I'd been there myself but even after a number of visits I do not see why one would call it exceptional to the extent of being revolutionary. Sure I get why it holds a special position for being one of the few places in the city where tea ranks over coffee and isn't over-priced. In fact tea should be the only reason for visiting this little shop which is conveniently located in a well-frequented area for shoppers. Summer weary as we are and a popular destination as Dakshinapan is, Dolly's Tea Shop provides a welcome array of flavoured iced-tea. The Pineapple Julep is quite refreshing and the Lemon Barley T serves just as well for those who would prefer something less sweet. Their specials are pretty unique and are welcome additions to a list of the more popular varieties of the Darjeeling Tea or Assam Tea. The Cocoa T, for example, is really quite novel and memorable.

The one good thing about Dolly's is that it can cater to a wide range of people.Its homely decor is a refreshing change from the rather formal mainstream cafes that are part of a chain with their uniformed attendants and coffee machines. It is a place a thirteen-year-old is as likely to approve of as her mother. This place allows you to hold a conversation and the relief that the tea provides from the heat, even encourages it. There are special compilations of various kinds of tea that would make great gifts. Rows of tins of tea make you realise that even in terms of pricing there is a wide range to be picked from. There are expensive varieties that I had not heard of before for those who might be interested and there are not-so-expensive varieties of more popular kinds too. 

Their food is just as disappointing as their tea is not. The sandwiches are nothing special and a vegetarian is advised not to order them at all. The pasta and sausage salads are too small in proportion and not well made either. The deserts are more often than not unavailable and you can see them frying packaged ready-to-be-fried food, which to me is rather off-putting. 

I had once visited the shop when the owner was present and was being interviewed for a newspaper. I realised she is probably why the place has as many regulars as it does. She was very warm and welcoming, both during and after the interview, making sure we were attended to well, encouraging feedback and enquiring about our favourites from the menu. 

However, I cannot help but say that the staff is not half as welcoming. I haven't visited the shop enough to be called a regular but i have been there enough to notice that they are slow to the point of being unwilling to serve you, especially if you visit in the lean hours when you happen to be the only customers. The sausage salad had been tossed up so carelessly that it contradicts the image of the shop as a snug and homely little place. You would expect a little more attention to be paid to your food. 

The refreshing iced-tea which are affordable to a student such as me is incentive enough to visit, especially on a hot summer evening. The fact that the shop delivers on its promise of good tea is undoubted. But the staff and the food are too evident let-downs to not notice. So while I grant that it is a good shop, it is not as extraordinary as i was made to think it is.

Am a regular visitor of Dakshinapan which is my mom's favourite hangout.Dolly's tea shop is a landmark of Dakshinapan where u can see people siting outside with tall glass of  tea,chatting endlessly.I was always curious about this cozy lil place.So paid a visit with mom one fine evening.Had a  quick treat of watermelon tea and iced-lemon tea alongside chicken sausage salad and prawn cutlets.Both the teas deserve a mention.
Place is quite pocket friendly too.

I would love to taste some more of the teas.

It should be a summer evening and not too late (it closes down early - 7:30 or 8). After the very hot day, a breeze blows from the south. You can be sitting outside Dolly's Tea Shop. You can be alone or with a friend (this is not a place for a large group). And sipping on a tall glass of Iced Lemon Tea, with bits of Tulsi in it. The best thing about it is the distinct flavor of tea. It will cool you off and refresh you.

Munch on a Grilled Ham Sandwich, which has generous slices of ham packed in roughly.

You will not detest the sweaty summers of Kolkata.

I was on the lookout for a cafe or tea-room which was not a chain shop but a local one and had suddenly remembered reading about Dolly's Tea Shop in either The telegraph or The Statesman, a very long time ago. I immediately contacted my friend who is devoted to food and between us we have the motto that we 'shall travel for food'. We went all the way to the extreme southern part of the city in a shopping complex called, 'Dakshinapan' located at Dhakuria beside 'Madhusudan Manch'. Dolly's Tea Shop has a very unique ambiance with tea tins stacked on one side and wooden walls with very nice lighting. This being the hot summer month we sat outside. It is usually difficult to get a seat with tables since the place is tiny and there are many patrons. The patrons are usually the shoppers or people who frequent the shop which was evident with the personal interaction of other patrons with the owner. The menu for tea is long and interesting. We settled for the Spiced Lemon Tea with chicken and ham club sandwich as the accompaniment. Our club sandwich arrived at first and was quite large in size. I am not a fan of club sandwiches since there is no dainty way of eating the massive sandwich made huge with an extra slice of bread in the middle. While the sandwich is meaty and very large which completely fills your tummy it lacks the desirable bite due to lack of a condiment which if spread on the inner surface of the bread adds to the taste of the sandwich be it mustard or cheese or any other condiment. A tomato based tiny portion of condiment did not add to the taste. Taking the size of the sandwich and the portion of meat I would say the price (Rs100) is justified but it did not appease my taste buds. The icing of the evening was the Spiced lemon tea. The rock salt and lemon gave the tea a very unique flavour  which reminded me of the special tea served in the station of New Jalpaiguri. Priced at Rs30 it was very refreshing and gave full value for money. The owner is very active and deserves appreciation for running around , taking orders and even serving food. I was very happy and touched with the hosts feeding a stray mongrel who came in looking for food. While some might find the idea unhygienic as mentioned by the two ladies seated at the table next to us I was touched and many patrons seemed to know the fellow and greeted him/her. The crockery is colourful and adds to the decor of the place. I would say tea shop with a touch of humanity.  Other than the grand tea room at park Street Calcutta can boast about this economical tea room and I am glad aunt Dolly has made that possible.

Sip some brewing tea at Dolly's The Tea Shop!

What kind of picture comes to your mind when you think of a tea shop? I always picture a straw thatched shanty manned by a rustic, who sits slouched in front of the oven brewing hot tea in a kettle. The typical milky tea available in these food stalls is generally served in earthen cups. It also comes cheap depending on the size of the cup (you can have tea for rupees two, five, ten or twenty!). Some food joints in Kolkata (like Indian Coffee House) serve tea with snacks, but even there you will either get lemon tea or milk tea. Of course, top places like The Coffee Bean and Tea Cafe, The Park, Fire and Ice or Taj Bengal have separate tea menus where one could get flavoured tea, but not everyone can visit such expensive places for some tea! 

It will not be wrong to say here that Dolly's The Tea Shop revolutionised the concept of serving tea in the city. Neither is it like a roadside tea stall nor is it a 5 star tea shop that is meant only for the elite. It is a cosy little tea shop tucked up in a corner in Dakshinapan Market (2 Gariahat Road South, Dhakuria, Kolkata). I particularly like this tea shop's cosy ambience and artful decor. The seating arrangement in Dolly's The Tea Shop is also praiseworthy. Elegant cane chairs and sofas are arranged inside the shop to provide comfortable seating to visitors. Some sleek and portable tables and chairs are also kept outside the shop so customers do not have to stand in a queue when the shop is full of tea lovers! 

At Dolly's The Tea Shop, you can enjoy a variety of flavoured Darjeeling tea, Assam tea, Kangra tea, Uttaranchal tea and Nilgiri tea. If you are a health conscious individual you can get yourself some Dolly's special organic tea. You can also have flavoured tea like hot lemon tea, spiced lemon tea and spiced ginger tea. Dolly's The Tea Shop is famous for serving Cocoa T, Cardamom T, Kashmiri Kahwa and Fruitea. Those who really want to try something different can surely opt for these flavours. 

In the sweltering heat, some good iced tea just soothes your nerves. Have some special iced tea with a dash of lime at Dolly's The Tea Shop and you will feel refreshed instantly! Of course, Afternoon tea is incomplete without some munchies. Well, you can get a whole lot of munchies at Dolly's. Dolly's serves some lip smacking grilled sandwiches and fries too! If you are hungry, just grab a bite or two along with steaming hot or iced tea. You would also love the desserts served here like chocolate cake, chocolate cake with ice cream and orange cake.  Drop in once to get a taste of flavoured tea any hour of the day.

Nice and cozy little place that has quite a lot of flavors to offer to a tea lover. Had the new flavored ice tea  called Pink Champagne, which was really different and refreshing. The ham sandwich was also quite good, but it could've been better without so much of onion stuffed into it and with more butter on it. The prices are neither too high nor too low. Overall, the experience was good and i would like to try out the other flavors of ice tea along with something else to munch on.

I had heard too many good things about this place before I'd been there myself but even after a number of visits I do not see why one would call it exceptional to the extent of being revolutionary. Sure I get why it holds a special position for being one of the few places in the city where tea ranks over coffee and isn't over-priced. In fact tea should be the only reason for visiting this little shop which is conveniently located in a well-frequented area for shoppers. Summer weary as we are and a popular destination as Dakshinapan is, Dolly's Tea Shop provides a welcome array of flavoured iced-tea. The Pineapple Julep is quite refreshing and the Lemon Barley T serves just as well for those who would prefer something less sweet. Their specials are pretty unique and are welcome additions to a list of the more popular varieties of the Darjeeling Tea or Assam Tea. The Cocoa T, for example, is really quite novel and memorable.

The one good thing about Dolly's is that it can cater to a wide range of people.Its homely decor is a refreshing change from the rather formal mainstream cafes that are part of a chain with their uniformed attendants and coffee machines. It is a place a thirteen-year-old is as likely to approve of as her mother. This place allows you to hold a conversation and the relief that the tea provides from the heat, even encourages it. There are special compilations of various kinds of tea that would make great gifts. Rows of tins of tea make you realise that even in terms of pricing there is a wide range to be picked from. There are expensive varieties that I had not heard of before for those who might be interested and there are not-so-expensive varieties of more popular kinds too. 

Their food is just as disappointing as their tea is not. The sandwiches are nothing special and a vegetarian is advised not to order them at all. The pasta and sausage salads are too small in proportion and not well made either. The deserts are more often than not unavailable and you can see them frying packaged ready-to-be-fried food, which to me is rather off-putting. 

I had once visited the shop when the owner was present and was being interviewed for a newspaper. I realised she is probably why the place has as many regulars as it does. She was very warm and welcoming, both during and after the interview, making sure we were attended to well, encouraging feedback and enquiring about our favourites from the menu. 

However, I cannot help but say that the staff is not half as welcoming. I haven't visited the shop enough to be called a regular but i have been there enough to notice that they are slow to the point of being unwilling to serve you, especially if you visit in the lean hours when you happen to be the only customers. The sausage salad had been tossed up so carelessly that it contradicts the image of the shop as a snug and homely little place. You would expect a little more attention to be paid to your food. 

The refreshing iced-tea which are affordable to a student such as me is incentive enough to visit, especially on a hot summer evening. The fact that the shop delivers on its promise of good tea is undoubted. But the staff and the food are too evident let-downs to not notice. So while I grant that it is a good shop, it is not as extraordinary as i was made to think it is.

Dolly's Tea Shop brings back school time memories for me, i would bunk my last class and rush there for my thrice-weekly cup of orange pekoe tea and a plate [or three!!] of jam and cheese sandwiches, which are delicious despite the odd combination.

Dolly aunty is lovely, and always willing to help you choose your tea.. I've bought plenty of packets of first flush from her :-) heavenly! 

The place is small, but the seating is comfortable, and if you can balance your belongings on your lap, you may be able to play a few board games there too! 

Must try the jam and cheese sandwiches and also the ham sandwiches. Delicious and also most affordable.

Located inside dokhinapon , at dhakuria this is a popular hub for jadavpur university students. Frankly, I don't understand the craze about this place. The place is really really tiny, and not even a proper restaurant. Moreover the prices are high, compared to ambiance and quality. The teas and sandwiches are okish. The place is well staffed. But frankly I'm not very supportive of the 'aantel' bengali culture.

This place is South Kolkata's legendary tea drinkers favourite haunt... Located amidst the hustle and bustle of Dakshinapan this place is a perfect place for one to cool down with their wide array of tea both in hot and cold versions... the ladies who run this place are a sheer delight to interact with ask them you are feeling tired today and they will suggest you a brew.. what a delight you actually get rejuvenated... my Favourite is the grilled Ham sandwich... l LOVE IT.. at that price the taste the juicyness is quite unparalleled... plus a smokers heaven .. a tea a book or just a group of like minded friends you will hardly end up spending a fortune... Dollys is a Tea shop which is worth every penny!!

Every time I went to Dakshinapan for shopping I stop here to get myself refreshed with some delicious sandwiches and different varieties of teas. In the sandwiches I specially like the corny cheesy sandwiches and on the tea part I prefer the Iced tea. The ambience is also very nice....you will feel more relaxed and cosy here. The service is also good.
Overall a nice tea joint.......I love to go to this place.

i heard a lot about Dollys tea shop but never got the oppurtunity before. The other day we went shopping at Dakhinapan when we landed up there. The ambiance of the place is what attracted me at first. The little space has been utilised very cleverly and has given it a snug feel. you feel like sitting there with a cup of tea and reading a book or simply chatting with your friends. the little joint is the perfect place for 'adda' for people of all age groups. The shop run by females has got a homely feel and best part was the owner coming and taking your orders. she is a very enterprising lady who keeps a watch at each and every customers needs. we ordered for a sandwich and a ginger tea and black forest tea. after shopping in that humid and hot weather dolly's tea was nectar to our thirsty throat!!! very simple yet stylish menu is what makes the shop happening.Dollys Tea shop was an awesome experience... the simplicity and the warmth of the place is just so refreshing !!!!

************To Tea Or Not To Tea*************

Aah Dolly's Tea Shop. Where does one even start with this near iconic establishment? The quaint and almost annoyingly laidback & comfortable interiors? The familiar smell of fine teas? The simple but delicious grilled sandwiches with cheese and ham popping out from all corners - literally ? Or does one boldly state that the Iced Tea and Orange Mint Julep are the best to be found, in Kolkata and possibly in India ? All of them if you ask me! 

Yes it does get crowded, and the service does get a little slow or sloppy in the evenings but that's a small price to pay given how comforting the place is, how reasonable the rates are, and how yummy most of the menu is. 

Go in the afternoon, between 2 and 4, sink into the low, tea-crates fashioned into cushioned stools, say hello to Dolly (she'll be the regal, somewhat intimidating lady in an elaborate Sari, seated to the left in the recesses of the joint), order from the wide selection of teas (hot, cold, speciality, mocktail, austere, decadent), order a ham sandwich or something sweet, sit back and enjoy the languid, Bengali vibe of Dakshinapan. 

As someone who has been visiting Dolly's for 2 decades now, it saddens me to see some of the thoughtless criticisms and accusations being hurled at the establishment. I haven't really seen any preferential treatment being meted out to "Firangs", nor have I had to wait for hours to be served. I have, however, seen "Firangs" speaking fluent Bengali, Bengalis speaking fluent American, and everything in between. Always interesting, always charming. 

Let me make this clear - you go to Dolly's to slouch, see, slump, slurp, sip, sleep, smooch, smoke, smack(your lips), sing, soak etc. etc. Don't expect BaristaCCDCostaStarbucksWhatever the hell else. 
Relax and allow yourself to steep in the bourgeois, nostalgic, complex, bitter-sweet brew called Calcutta.
