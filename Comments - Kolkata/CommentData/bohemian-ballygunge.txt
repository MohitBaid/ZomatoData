I had my 31st's dinner at this place. It was hard to get seat for 4 on that day but they managed to arrange seats for us. 
They serve Bengali fusion food which is interesting.
We had ✓Daab chingri✓Joyous mutton chops✓Topshe fritters✓Kacha lonka mangso (highly recommend)✓Gondhoraj prawn(disappointing) ✓Sizzled bhetki✓Coconut tender mouse 

Most of the items tasted good but the quantity was too less.

We had a bad experience in terms of both food and service. Food arrived after 1hour. 
Fish was cold and looked like it had been put in some leftover curry. Only good thing was their mojito. Many of the dishes on menu are not available. Not very good for vegetarians, too few options. 
When we asked for regular water, they handed us bottled water and said this is their regular water and later put that on bill. According to rule, any restaurant has to serve regular water without charge.

Loved the food. They serve you traditional Bengali food with a little bit modern twist. If you have a sweet tooth , then will definitely get to taste something different.

Blast at B0hemian!

If 1 is l00king for some innovative fusion cuisine, this place is the address where u see Bengali food and Continental cuisine having a happy coalition. The menu is so creative that 1 takes quite some time to decide orders. It is difficult to skip any dish if not with a consolation to pay a next visit shortly.
We had Grilled chicken wrapped in N0len gur and Darjeeling Chillies. Such a novel use of. N0len Gur, sweetened our winter afternoon. Next came Smoked Bhekti with cumin and pineapple served with Flat Pilaf Rice - such a tangy twisty flavour! And then arrived Chicken with Kalmi stuffings again served with Flat Pilaf Rice. Each dish exploded with its distinct, different taste in the mouth. The desserts were equally unique - the malp0a cheesecake and coconut mousse!

My tummy was full but not satieted; My mind was satisfied but not saturated which is why I have whispered a silent promise to be back there very soon....

The food here is just too good. We went for dinner & we have opted for the Topshe fritters & Vodka soaked prawns for starter, for the main course we had ordered the kacha Langa mangsho & Murshidabadi barbequed chicken & finally for the dessert we had settled for the Malpua Cheesecake. Each & every dish was just too good. The vodka soaked prawns had a very nice bitter sweet flavour. Coming to the topshe fritters, it had boneless topshe fish deep fried in batter, the fish was crisp at the same time well cooled & tender. Coming to the main course, the murshidabadi chicken platter had an array of flavours packed in a single plate, the pickle served in this item was totally awesome. The kacha lanka mangsho which had mutton cooked in a green chilli paste was served with a side of rice, & although the mutton was cooked in green chilli paste it was not too spicy, rather it had a very balanced taste. The cheesecake had a very unique taste like the concept & by far it is one of the best cheesecake I have ever tasted.This place is a definitely must try for all food lovers.

The latest spread and buffet offered by Bohemian is a delight for food connoisseurs. The food served is a combination of cooking artistry, taste and quality. All the food items served are novel in their feel, taste and demeanor.Supported by a top quality decor and good service this place should be on the top of every food-appreciators  wish list.

Innovative Bengali Flavours and ingredients with French cooking techniques makes its an interesting place to go to if you are in Kolkata. Ambience and Service compliments it. Earlier no liquor was served but now even that box is also ticked 😃.

Visited there on 31 nite. Its a good restaurant to visit. Ordered buffet. Its was Rs.899 all inclusive. As per price the menu was not at all upto the mark. Certain things should change in their menu mainly desserts. And also one thing is that each and every thing is served on table. The quantity provided each time by them is too less and asking for repeated time is also..... I think you all can understand. Service was toooooo slow. Behavior of staff was very good. Some items were really tasteful.

First time I am visiting this National Award winning restaurant! I’m sitting in the restaurant and writing this! 

You have over 15 cocktail selections, out of which during peak season on 3 are available cause your bar tender is new. You should inform your customers when they book a place. This is horrible and not expected from Bohemian!

The food is averagely delicious. We ordered the phuchka combo which had crab and shrimp along with mutton keema. The crab and shrimp phuchka was nice but the other wasn’t that great (tasted a little raw) . The keema vindaloo papri was alright. And the shrimp cutlet was crisp and fresh. None of the cocktails were available which was a huge bummer.
The waiters were not that pleasant to deal with. Particularly one of them was borderline rude and didn’t seem too interested in serving the guests. Also ordered the Gondhoraj julep which is a nice drink to sip on while you wait.

Bohemian!!!! Mmmm what to say about this restaurant...??? I would suggest that get the Menu xeroxed and visit this place a multiple times so that you can cross each item on the menu that you have tasted. Blindly all the dishes tastes BOHEMIAN. The "Vodka soaked Prawn" are simply awesome. The first floor sitting is better than the ground floor. The staffs are very courteous and even they have an idea about the food. In case you are at a fix that what to order and what not to, then seek help of the staffs. Just inform them what your taste buds are craving for and you will be advised exactly the same type of menu.

Thank you chef Joy for this creative menu restaurant.

The portions are huge but the taste is not at all upto the mark. The spinach often gets way too fibrous and doesn't taste good at all. The ambience is quite loud for a restaurant. The palate changers are interesting though.

The first of its kind in kolkata.
Even though I am not a resident of kolkata this place awstrucked me with the bengali continental fusion
The price is on the higher side but the dishes deserves the tag.
The cuisines are outstanding,no favourite as such since you can try anything of the book and it will delicious.

If you are in Kolkata and you want to experience the authentic Bengali cuisine with a twist, then this is the place you should visit. Situated in the one of the narrow alleys in South Kolkata, this place is a heaven for food lovers. This place has become a “must visit” whenever we are in the city of joy. This time I was was in love with the unique Smoked Egg plant Phuchkas served with Nolen Gur water, it was out of the world. There were other options to choose from including the Creamed Cauliflower Phuchkas served with Aam Kasandi water or Hilsa Phuchkas with mustard and tender coconut water. These are definitely a must try. For the main course we had Chital meat steak, soft tender fish served with pitas and veggies. Other than that we had Panchphoron flavoured Parshe and foiled backed Bhetki. For drinks we chose Mint and Cucumber Refresher and Gondhoraj Sarbat. Happy soul, didn’t have any place for dessert.

Food with a twist.  I never thought I would relish panic Puri (golgappa/puchka) with cauliflower, wax gourd or brinjals.... I actually enjoyed them.  Even the cocktails had a twist... When I spoke to the bartender, he shared that they treat the basic drinks with fruits to get the flavors absorbed. The pita bread with cheese and coriander/mint - almost a pizza - was a twist again.

From interior to food,visiting this place is  experiencing something totally unusual.The narrow entry way has been decked up with bright colours, patterns and  hanging glass lanterns to turn it to a labyrinth that takes you to a world of bohemianism of the 60s.The use of bright colours with a psychedelic arrangements of the pictures of the rock legends of 60s and 70s like Grateful Dead,Beatles and Moheener Ghoraguli create the ambience.Even music being an integral part of the theme of the restaurant has been carefully chosen to set the mood.
Coming to the food we were really overwhelmed with  the way they are presenting the concept of fusion.It is like a symphony...totally  different sets of spices,flavours  and even cuisines being orchestrated to present some unconventional symphony.
Even a casual Going though the menu teases the foodie within you.There is a varied choice of some totally unusual  blends of flavours in cocktails.We opted for the “Kolkata Afternoon“which came out to be a mind blowing combination.The lemony white rum based drink with a hint of salt and chilli was just perfect to cheer up us after a long drive from Newtown to Ballygunge for the quest of flavour.
Even The pallet cleanser (4 cubes of watermelon topped with a tangy,spicy tamarind and green chilli flavoured pickle)itself set the tone of the things to come.

As appetisers we were suggested to try the vodka soaked prawn.Additionally we also took the Stir fried mutton with mustard and coriander.The prawns were succulent and were almost melting in the mouth.The rich aroma of mustard and coriander in stir fried mutton was equally off beat and was tickling our senses.We were so satisfied with the starters that our expectations reached its limit while ordering for main course.To our greatest pleasure,Bohemian didn’t disappoint us this time too.We ordered 
Bhetki simmered with smokey pineapple and cumin,Panchforon- flavoured parshe fillet with  smocked green chilli sauce and Green pea stuffed Bhetki sandwiches for three of us.Simply speaking,each was a masterpiece.We could have never imagined  that our so called day to day Bengali “fish curry and rice” can have so much versatility unless we stepped into here.The Bhetki with smocked pineapple had a touch of Rajasthani Kari...a strong touch of sweetness followed by a dash of sour perfectly blended with the flavour of roasted jeera. Each preparation here comes with a complementing rice dish to present a perfect combination.The green pea stuffed Bhetki sandwich had a star anise flavour so commonly found  in oriental cuisine but overall  it had a flavour quite similar to  “gassi” dishes of South Indian cuisine  because of its subtle use of anise in it.The  dish came with coriander flavoured pilaf made of dahlia.The crunchy texture of the pilaf was complementing the smoothness of the gravy.But the most  striking combination was the panchforon flavoured parshe roll  dipped in the smocky flavour of the green chilli sauce  along with the lemon scented rice .The combined flavour was similar to that of Thai  green curry  along with the unmistakable touch of typical Bengali spice panchforon . Loved the concept of presenting each dish along with the chef’s preferred rice/pilaf.The twists of flavours in every dish and the variety of rice in each set mesmerised us.The same unique blending of tastes carried over to the desert too. The Aamarel custard was a blending of pureed mango leather(Aam satta) and cream of tender coconut and the result was heavenly.
At the preface the chef owner has penned  down his passion for Bohemian experiments in culinary world and has assured us to present something “out of the box” to give us a taste of something exceptional that challenges the set rules of being conventional good food.As  foodies,we are glad to see Bohemian as an honest approach towards this achievement.

 Note: From 4 pm - 7 pm it  is the time for “Happy Hours”when the restaurant offers the same cocktail menu along with the full appetisers and desert menu in half price even in weekends.

Kacha lonka mansho  
Both the dishes were very good 
i loved the pitas served with the chicken..they were soft and tastyy
malpua cheesecake-those who have a sweet tooth must try this..
Then the boho hours started and we ordered chocolate by death and keema puchka ...
we wanted to order the non veg combo phucka but it was not available so we took keema phuchka..i did not like it much tbh..

Just the place to be if you are bored with traditional Bengali food. The Bohemian is well known across Kolkata for serving pretty unconventional Continental style Bengali dishes. Taste-wise, I feel like the place is a bit overhyped, but their service, ambiance and food presentation might just win you over.

Went here on a weekday evening and the place was reasonably full. The decor is eye catching and the staff was very courteous. But the food was a major let down. We ordered the chicken wraps and cauliflower fuchka for starters. The wraps were almost inedible because of the weird sweet taste the nolen gur in it was giving off and the fuchkas were downright average. The main course of a chicken dish with pita bread and a fish dish with rice were okay. The fish gravy was pretty good. Nothing out of the ordinary. Prices are definitely high for the portions they serve. I hope their other fusion dishes are better because our meal was pretty disappointing.

Excellent food and service.  We had a couple of beers (expensive!) And three starters which were excellent in taste and quantity. No space for a main course. Vodka soaked prawns, pork spare ribs, mutton stir fry in coriander. Lovely! They topped it off with a complimentary cheesecake as it was our Anniversary. Thanks!

I have never been a big fan of fusion food. But Bohemian changed my opinion. The way they balance different flavors of completely different ingredients, seemingly the ingredients that 'can't go together', is mind-boggling. Every dish is an experience. One of the dishes that we had was made of crab meat and 'laal shaak'. We were just so bowled over by the idea itself. And it tasted excellent. Their experiment with Bengali cuisine is curiously surprising but unexpectedly delicious. The menu keeps changing. But whatever the menu is, all the dishes are well thought out and balanced. I personally was surprised to see how each ingredient contributes to the overall flavor of the dish without losing their individuality. No element is redundant. It's not an experiment for the sake of experiment, thanks to Chef Joy. The interior is modern yet subtly traditional.
The prices are a little bit on the expensive side but I guess, it's worth it.

Bohemian which means "socially unconventional" matched very well with this restaurant. 7 years old masterpiece by Chef Joy Banerjee.
Located 10 mins walking distance from Ballygunge Phari and very near to the Bondel Gate Crossing.
We were there at 1 o clock for lunch, place was not very crowded at the time when we entered.

They have seating arrangements separated in two consecutive floors and can accommodate upto 80 peoples.

Ambiance and décor was very nice and they played very nice Bengali songs in the background.

Our Server Tapas was very friendly from the beginning; he gave us some good choices in appetizers.
We took Vodka Soaked Prawns which was very tasty and juicy, then Wrapped Chicken in Nolen Gur which was like a paturi in Nolen gur flavored, it was sweet and spicy. Then we had the best item called Topshe Fritters which was fried boneless Topshe fish in a Poppy Seed batter.

From main course Kancha Lanka Mutton was recommended by Tapas and it was brilliant.

Desserts we tried their Malpua Cheesecake and frankly I didn’t like the taste.
Chef and Owner Mr.Joy Bannerjee was offered us a dessert called Cigars & Coffee Mousse and that was fantastic. Thanks to him for taking time and interact with us after dining.
From quality control to top notch service, everything was perfect.

★★★★½ experience.

The place is perfect for hangouts...ambience is great.. specially the background of soft bengali intellectual music will perfectly act as a mood elevator.. we went at the time of happy hours. So we did not get any main course.. we only got drinks and other dishes.. we ordered two cocktails. One is the kolkata biriyani and other one is gondhoraj martini.. gondhoraj martini was served with three pices of small gondhoraj flavoured rasgulla which will give u a shot of refreshment instantly. Apart from that we ordered veg and nonveg combo of phuchka.. specially the nonveg combo plate is a must try... aprt from this we ordered becon wrapped prawns,bhetki with 3 ways of corriander, mustard chicken on toast, smoked chicken & creamed cheese...
And finally in dessert we ordered death by chocolate...
Highly satisfied tummy... must see place for a get together or hangouts...

People praise the fusion food here but this place failed to live up to my expectations. I liked the gondhoraaj Martini but that's all. The food was fine but nothing great to justify the ratings. My personal opinion average food. But the staff and ambience will win you over for sure. But then it should be about food. I find the combinations too weird for my taste.

Bohemian had been on my wishlist for quite sometime..at last got an opportunity to visit the so called "heaven for food lovers".the ambience was good with lighted candles and the music played led me back to those "good old" childhood days.the employees were extremely hospitable and greeted with a smile.we were served a slice of watermelon with some seasonings as a complimentary preparation.we ordered gandharaj juleb along with vodka soaked prawns.both were equally amazing.the prawn seemed to tickle our taste buds.it was "love at first taste" for me in the true sense of the term.nxt in our order list were bacon wrapped chicken with aam kasandi reduction and crabmeat stir fried with pickled garlic.both of them were equally good though I felt the crab preparation to be a little spicy.lastly we had pantua baked alaska.i could have never imagined pantua tasting so heavenly until I've had one.as rightly said,all's well that ends well.it was an awesome experience as expected.apart from the extraordinary f pricing,though I feel is somehow justifiable considering the quality they serve,there is nothing that I can crib about!two thumsup for bohemian.keep up the good work!

About last night went for a nice dinner... Loved the food and the cocktails.. And the dessert.. Among all the cocktails we ordered we liked the Gondhoraj martini (very refreshing), the kolkata afternoon( nice kick of green chili) but I hated the just bohemian it got too overbearing after a while. Coming to the appetizers, crab and phucka with spiced nolen gur water is a MUST HAVE. It is so delicious! We also had ordered the smoked chicken and cheese wraps which was OK. In the main course, Kancha lonka mutton demands a special mention. It was finger-licking good and we also got a mursidabadi barbecued chicken and onion chutney which was also nice. Malpua cheesecake for the people with sweet tooth is a must. A few things still did put us off. The seating arrangements doesn't give you any privacy and anyone can be disturbed or listen to your conversation. Also they did not have a card payment option available which is surprisingly odd for a restaurant of such standard. Nevertheless it was a good dining experience. And we may again visit for sure.

Located near the 21 pally temple, this is one of my favorites.

I have been here a few times and each time I have been delighted by the finger licking tasty food here. Apart from the vodka and orange infused ice cream (which I had once) where I felt that orange taste does not go well with ice cream, there was not a single item that I would not love to try out again.

Service and presentation of food is top notch, decor and ambience is just perfect - be it a family gathering, a friendly reunion or a date.

I don't stay in kolkata anymore but come here to see my mom. So was not quite updated with the new restaurants over here. A friend recommended this place and took my mom for dinner. The ambience can be better since its a fine dining place. However the food is next level. Be it the quality or taste, it's 5/5. The service is also very nice.

Next time you are there, you can try the crab cake for starters. For main course, do try the sliced pork in banana envelope.

This place is known for their awesome food and unique menu although it's quite overpriced. Sometime while having the food over there you mighy not feel overpriced just because of their friendly hospitality and the innovation in their menu. The uncommon menu and twists in taste of every food and cocktail available in the restaurant makes it worth going again and again.
It was altogether an awesome experience of having a dinner in such a lovely restaurant.

This is one very unique place in Kolkata with the Bangali-Continental kind of fusion food. I have been here earlier as well but recently we had gone there to celebrate my wife's birthday. And as usual, everything was amazing. For starters we had Daab Chingri Dynamites and Stir Fried Mutton with Mustard and Coriander - Chef Joy's Style. The presentation of the Chingri dish was very good, served on cute quaint soup spoons and tasted amazing. The mutton was soft and succulent.

For main course we had Foil Baked Bhetki with Baby Turmeric, Teen Phoron and Coriander Jus, Prawns steamed with Yoghurt and Gondhoraj and Pabda Rolls stewed in Cherry Tomato and Spinach Broth. All the items were excellent, however the prawns were marvelous with a slight after taste of Gondhoraj Lebu.

For dessert we had Malpua Cheesecake and Gondhoraj Lemon Pie with Ginger Brittle. We loved both of these with the desserts being not too sweet, just perfect.

A special mention for the person who took our order and served us. I forgot his name, but he was very courteous and ever-smiling. Keep it up.

The cocktail was very refreshing.
Price is on the higher side.

Bohemian had been on my wish list ever since it opened up some years ago. However, one look at the prices, and I would convince myself to go to some other place falling within the meagre budget I usually had as a student.

Finally I dropped in here a few days ago to celebrate my mother's birthday. The idea of having Bengali food with a twist made somewhere else other than her own kitchen, quite appealed to her.

Before I start with the food review, I must mention how courteous the staff is at this place. They are well informed about the menu, are extremely polite and helpful.

Here's what we had ordered: Yellow Lentil Soup with Spicy Chicken, Smoked Chicken & Spinach in Money Bags, Sizzled Bhetki with Pickled Garlic, Kancha Lonka Mangsho and Malpua Cheesecake.

What absolutely stole my heart was the Yellow Lentil soup and the Sizzled Bhetki. The soup was a rich concoction of dal, spices and garlic. Garlic distinctly made it's presence felt amidst all the radhuni, coriander and slightest hint of mustard. What I loved about the Bhetki dish was the greens it came with. Mix some of the rich garlic infused red gravy with the celerey rice, put some of the wilted greens on top and you'll taste the flavors mingle with and compliment each other.

Kancha Lonka Mangsho is supposedly a best seller at this place. Even though the mutton was extremely tender and well cooked, the gravy failed to impress my taste buds.

Lastly, the malpua cheesecake was pretty nice with the consistent flavor of saunf everywhere. What it definitely lacked was the malpua. There could've been thinner layers of cheese and more of the Indian pancake.

Bohemian has done a great deal in breaking and remaking some of the most typical Bengali dishes. It would be even better if they focused on making a star dish with lesser ingredients fighting to take up the major space.

There's a charming chemistry which one finds in a fusion food. One might beg to differ, that Oriental & Western cuisines are very much different, but, today my vision & my taste completely changed. What we tasted at Bohemian today, was nothing short of magic. I simply cannot deny the cunning fact, that it takes more than just "balls" to experiment with food and that too with favorable outcomes. Bohemian does that with utmost precision. It manipulates the mouth. Just like a magician does.
 
Or else, what can explain a Wax gourd & garlic mousse with 'Papri' chips. What a bold attempt indeed! As you dip your eclectic mousse with your "papri" and put it in your (already) salivating mouth, you can literally feel 'heavenly'. You can't help but secretly marvel at how the bar has been raised with something as "chaa-posa" as Wax Gourd & Papri Chips! 

Every magic act commences with a hurrah. You must be thinking: "Will the enigma endure?' Just then the veil drops down and what do you see? Voila! There's Cumin smoked Bhetki with Darjeeling chilies. Boom! Your head must be spinning by now!! What on Earth is that? Well my dear friend, it's an orgasmic culinary masterpiece. The presentation itself was dramatic enough to please us already. A waiter arrived with inverted glasses on a tray. Before we could say anything, the magician did the Act and we like hypnotized pussies stared at it. When the Act was over, we realized what actually happened. The waiter trapped the smoke of the charcoal by that glass. Thereby, infusing a smoky flavor to the already prepared fish. Both the smell of the burnt charcoal along with Darjeeling chilies imparted a distinct flavor which is found to tickle your every senses! As you bite into the tender fish, the juiciness pours its heart out to you. 

The next item shocks you as well. Crab meat with mango pickle, butter & thickened milk. Seriously?! Can a food be this much innovative? But it went down a little. The mango pickle and butter overpowered the delicateness of crab meat. The milky cream couldn't salvage it enough though! But just as you think the magician has failed us, abracadabra, another titillating appetizers started their flirtatious dance. The dancer in the form of Mutton & Tomato Skewers. Conceptually the tomato (being intrinsically sour) could also have a bit of extra salt (maybe inside) to match up with the salt level of the meat – though Mutton & cherry tomato skewers was a great concept nonetheless. The mutton pieces were good. Soft, juicy and the crunchiness of the tomatoes added a bit 'spike' to the flavor. 

Now the Prawns are an arrogant bunch of people. You can't tell a good one just by looking at it. But the moment we did taste it, we were mesmerized. It was a foodie's delight! To rewrite the ways a prawn dish is served (with muddled grapes) took immense guts and sheer thinking! I couldn't help but appreciate that. The next show came with equally glittering colors. Royal Bengal Mutton (though, wanted to try their Pork Vindaloo but my relatives insisted I stick to the "generic" instead). Royal Bengal Mutton is a wholesome dish itself. Sliced mutton layers, served with mashed potatoes & an innovative ‘bhuna’ (gravy) sauce on top. Posing quite a contrast from anything Bengali food I have ever had. A word of caution is that this is prepared in continental style – so the mutton will not be melt in the mouth like we have in some of our Bengali delicacies & Nawabi biryanis. 

Now before the curtains are drawn, we cheered the magician to deliver one last Act. It's Mutton and drumstick stew with "gondhoraj" leaves (Gondhoraj is a kind of lime). To rewrite the rules of modern Bengali taste buds needs a certain confidence and courage. This particular dish showed both. Gondhoraj Chicken has turned into a Bengali House-hold name these days. But Gondhoraj Mutton? A Heroic Act indeed! Here the mutton pieces were tender and the flavor firmly implants on your tongue. 

After such a pageantry, a pause is mandatory. Our final treats came in the bodies of Orange Rosogollas (a Bengali favorite) and Mango Souffle. Woah! Who knew we would end our show in such a sweet note! Spiced mango souffle – reminded me of spiced raw "aam" (mango) sweet chutney in the core , incorporated in a souffle – new and terrific. As for Orange Rosogollas, the taste is as sinful as it sounds. Super soft, not very sweet, real orange pulp & zest. Unique in every freaking way! 

The curtain came down, finally, on the plates. And as the lights in our eyes lit up, we saw a charming waiter smiling and handing over our Bill. Time for us audience to pay tribute to the magical time we spent here. As we left the place, a lingering sensation of love still remained. I could tell I felt a finger on my shoulder. Or maybe, even that was an illusion. Some magic.

Wonderful staff who treat with you with some delicious complimentary watermelon slices with some tangy chutney. The restaurant is rather small and I would suggest booking seats before you plan. Went to this restaurant mainly cause of it's exotic entrees and boy it didn't disappoint​ our taste buds. The quantity based on the price was on the lower side and but the taste was amazing.
Some dishes that I would recommend would be the:
1. Daab Chingri Dynamites

Ambience: 2.5/5
Taste: 4/5
Value for Money: 3/5

Please order food from Bohemian if you want to make a fool of yourself! We have just been from abroad. Beautiful names of items, would seem to be continental menus. But in reality you are taken for a ride. We had ordered: Sizzled Bhetki, Chicken cucumber and Chicken Lemon mustard the pictures given in that order. In reality, a large portion of plain rice in each packet (!) one can have for dinner and lunch and dinner the next day, and a large bowl of a few chicken/fish pieces and 250 ml of watery gravy. What a waste of money! Only yesterday evening we spent the same amount ( Rs 1500 ) to have a 3 course dinner at a chinese restaurant within 100m of Bohemian.
                    
Of course it was a home delivery. Will never make the mistake again.

Bohemian is Joymalya Banerjee's brilliant innovation station! This is the second time I went over to the cozy restaurant in Ballygunge Place. Bohemian is quintessentially a place for explorers of flavours, explorers of novelty, explorers of fusion and any Food Loving Bengali, who still loves their typical spices and mouth-exploding flavours yet is yearning for a new packaging, and new combinations.
We began with the special Ilish, crabmeat and prawn and mutton keema fuchkas! Yep that's what it was! 
My favourites are - Chilli pickle and Cheese baked Crab with Kolmi greens, Pan grilled pork spare ribs with kalojeere and nolen gur (jaggery) reduction, Pork stewed with Bagane Mashla, fragrant chilli and cheese! 
And the cocktails.. you have got to try them all! The gandharaj Martini and the Just Bohemian got me all excited. I'm going back for a 'drinkable' Kolkata Biriyani cocktail and many more in the food section!
My personal Alcoholic dessert is the Excellence (Brewed Coffee, Caramel, Whisky)

Was invited here by a friend and must say I did love every bit of the food and drink. So went back there with other friends who were visiting Kolkata. 
Start with their lovely drinks, each one is vibrant in colour and taste with a twist, very refreshing. Their food is also all about a bit of fusion and twist. The gondhoraj flavoured dish was awesome. 
Will certainly go back there for the food. 
The seating is however a bit cramped and can be overcrowded if you happen to come in a bit late for lunches. I only did lunches here and every bit of it was worth it.

Kolkata food is definitely a different experience ranging from Rolls to steaks to sizzlers and yes, of course - 
Biryani! You name it and Kolkata has it, but this place offers what Kolkata signifies the best - Authentic 
Bengali Cuisine. Being a bong, I never thought that i would visit a restaurant to eat bengali cuisine. :D 

A well known place for typical Fusion Food, BOHEMIAN does stand out in terms of its unique recipes and their 
funny nomenclature. From Sunrise at Sunderbans, The Kolkata Afternoon, The Kolkata Biryani, A new moon over 
Kolkata to name a few drinks. 

PS: This was just a small knowledge i had from Zomato about Bohemian before I 
checked in, thinking what all can be ordered ;) 

So, after waiting for nearly an hour, we were welcomed in a very pleasant way and were assisted to our seats. The 
manager was very generous. Coming to the decor, themed with the Durga Puja celebration in the city, has
decorated the interior beautifully with different arms and weapons of devi durga.

The menu list was so confusing with all the interesting names of fusion foods enlisted but well explained by the captain. As 
famishing, we ordered quickly the appetizers : Panchphoron Chicken Escallops & the very famous and much 
recommended Chilli Pickle n Cheese Baked Crab with Kolmi Greens with Gondhoraj Martini & The Kolkata Afternoon.
Chilli Pickle n Cheese Baked Crab with Kolmi Greens was absolute an orgasmic dish. Probably the most tastiest 
preparation I have ever had in any restaurant. Devastatingly beautiful it was. Cheesy, creamy, full of crab meat.

Next comes the main course, Kancha Lanka Mangsho (suggested by the captan as it is their signaure dish and Flash Grilled Bhetki Simmered in Radhuni Sauce chosen by me. As expected, Kancha Lanka Mangsho turned out to be yet another delicacy. The meat was very tender. Flash Grilled Bhetki Simmered in Radhuni Sauce with rice tasted very nice and authentic too. 

Along with the main course we thought of trying yet another differnt drink and a side dish - Vodka Soaked Prawns with Grilled Garlic Aioli. My love for the seafood continues. Prawns were infused with vodka making it a sweeter one yet tasty. Sunrise at Sunderbans and Just Bohemian ; made with Nolen Gur was good enough but Gondhoraj Martini was the best among the lot.

Being a food lover, had an amazing experience at BOHEMIAN. Will definitely recommend the place and would love to visit it again. Happy Dining :)

The place is nicely tucked away near the Ballygunge Chowman and 6th Ballygunge place.

Decor: Nice bright interiors with an automatic sliding doors to welcome you inside the dining area with a view of the bar.

Service: It turned out to be a mixed bag. Mostly on the better side with partial knowledge of exactly what they are serving.

Food: We had ordered the daab sangria and afternoon breeze. Both were innovative and exciting. The chicken with nolen gur was average at best.
But the mains definitely stole the show. Kachalonka mangsho is a must. The pork mains was damn tasty with soft juicy meat. Fish and chicken were well cooked too with loads of flavours.
The desserts were a hit again with the malpoa cheesecake being the showstopper. The best cheesecake i have had.

Overall: An absolute gem of an experience and a must try. The pocket pinch may sting with our bill around 1200 per head but it was worth the money.

Starters and drinks are awesome. Fried rosogolla, crab meat with Kolmi, Pork with nalengur are awesome. Fuchka platter is not so good, lack in Wow factor.
Maincourse we tried Kancha lonka mangso and boneless hilsha in cuxumber. Hilsha tasted heavenly. Meat is tasted good@, pieces are not so good, full of fat, less meat.
Dessert is another you can try as much variant you can.
Perfection (alcoholic icecream), gondhoraj lemon tart, mastard apple tart, bhapa doi with honey, gold flake panna cota all are good.
.5 deducted because of meat and fuchka.

Nothing special. It's a 1bhk flat on the 2nd or 3rd floor of an apartment. Ambience was dull. Very off color during the Durga Puja. Perhaps judging from high ratings by others (which tempted me to visit here in the first place) its usually well buzzed, but for us it was a terrible experience. Experimental bong fusion food was okayish. Puja menu also lacked a few cocktails and dishes. Overall, expensive food that does not live up to hype.

Bohemian captures the essence of glocal, the global local. It's dishes are infused with the aroma and spices of the quintessential Bengali kitchen, be it gondhoraj lebu, panchforon, aam kashundi or coconut milk, and yet it is international in it's awe inspiring, palate pleasing range of fusions which capture the taste of Bengal at its finest. The perfect foil to these gastronomic delights are their cocktails which are equally fantastic. Service was excellent. Not to be missed! Will visit again. .

We visited the place during Durga Puja, at times of a huge crowd buzzing round the street in a Ashtami evening we pre booked our table and went in there with moderate expectations. But we were blown away by the food...starting from the Cocktails like Just Bohemian...made with Nalen Gur and Sunrise at Sunderbans...to the smoked bhetki and baked crab with ginger and coriander...each had a unique taste which is a treat to the tongue. The fusion food of Bengali and continental cuisine has been top notch. In main course we ordered Kancha lonka mutton. Lip smacking food with courteous and polite serving hands...an awesome experience...highly recommended to all.

Awesome fusion food! We tried gondhoraaj martini which came with green coloured tiny roshogollas instead of olives. We tried panchforon chicken, vodka infused prawn and topshe fritters as starters and bhetki in spicy randhuni sauce as main. The food quality and the idea behind designing this menu - are awesome! The last item of 3 course coriander bhetki was too salty (may be the Puja rush made few glitches) and they waived off the amount as we couldn't consume it. I would love to visit this place again

This place has created an aura of its own and I guess there would be hardly anyone who has not heard about this place. Though I am very late to write this review but I am glad I could finally know what the craze is about.
Let's start of with cocktails and I must say that after having cocktails at so many places in Delhi and Kolkata, this one has to be at top my list. Amazing blend of spices, tradition and alcohol to create something which the pallete had never had before. We tried many cocktails and the ones stood out for me was Bohemian Special, Kolkata Biryani, Gondhoraj Martini and Kolkata Afternoon and trust me it was difficult selecting the best. Bohemian Special was liked most by me which was cocktail of Rum and Nolen Gur.
The food now was equally competitive as the cocktails. We went at a time when full menu was not available but whatever food we had was again mouth watering. Special mention of Puchka Combo where, prawn, crab and lamb Puchka with variety of water was given. The concept is simply rocking and people in love with fusion food should visit regularly.
Overall, amazing experience and being a food lover took drinking and dining to a next level. Keep up the good work and keep increasing the blends.

Bohemian is undoubtedly my favorite restaurant in south kolkata right now.i have eaten there countless times and it is yet to disappoint me. The chef's unusual fusion dishes are amazingly scrumptious. Do try their range of fuchkas with keema, crab and hilsa fillings.It will change the way you look at the common street food.I wont mention any particular dish from their menu as all of them are fabulous.

We ordered gondhoraj julep . The mocktail was very refreshing with a distinct flavour of gondhoraj lebu. Next came chilli pickle and cheese baked crabs with kolmi greens. This was the only dish which lived upto our expectations. A version of devilled crab, this dish was infused with flavours of green chillies and kolmi saak.  However, some may find the dish too chilly and salty.
Grilled chicken wraps with nolen gur and darjeeling chillies was a disaster. The flavour of nolen gur did not go well with chicken . Bacon wrapped chicken with aam kasundi reduction was okay as a combo. The chicken was good but the complimentary rice was very bland and coarse textured. For dessert, we had caramel custard with crispy fried milk and malpua cheese cake both of which were delicious.
The price is set high considering the taste and quantity.

The place and the ambiance is good. It's a fine dine restaurant so the quantity is quite less and it is expensive.
The concept of the dishes is very unique.

The place is located just opposite to our very dear Patha Bhavan. The "Maacher Jhol"(A bengali food film) effect made us Bohemian on that evening. Phuchka season was going on so ordering a plate of non veg phuchka combo was mandatory. The combo contains 2 Hilsha Phuchka which was served with tender coconut water, 2 Prawn-Crab Phuchka served with nolen gur water and 2 Mutton Keema Phuchka served with honey lemon water. I must say we should stop experiment with Hilsha. Hilsha should be reserved for only mom's kitchen. The addition of coconut water was not suitable. Talking about the rest two- the experiment was successful. A glass of chilled Bengal Daab Sangria and Kolkata Afternoon was served after the phuchka session. One vodka and another white rum based cocktail just made our evening. The cocktails were so perfectly blended. Pork ribs with kalo jeera and nolen gur was a hit one. The meat was extremely tender. It will offer an unusual feeling on your taste buds. Don't worry the feeling was just awesome. Coming to the main course- pork and mutton. Pork wrapped in banana leaf was really a treat from them. It offers a true bangal touch in the dish. Mutton was also very good. It offers a mixed feeling- Indian and Continental. I really liked the pita breads served with mutton. They were roasted in a unique way with garlic and chilli. Gold Flake Panna Cotta will make me a true bohemian someday. The flavour of Darjeeling tea and tobacco was perfectly infused. It will give you the hint of post lunch smoking effect. Gondhoraj Lemon Pie was just out of the world. The cream was very fresh and I never had such a refreshing dessert before. Although the restaurant is a bit over priced and over hyped, you can definitely pay a visit. They offers really unique cuisines. Happy Dining :)

My first visit to Bohemian on my bday, chose the place after checking zomato rates and reviews. Needless to say the food was mouth watering. We had topse fry, vodka dipped prawns, mutton liver, crab, pork ribs for starters. My fav being topse fry. And for main course we had famous kanchalonka mutton, pabda shorshe and a dish of chicken, with bori pulao. The main course was suggested by one of the staff though. The ambience and decor adds up to the food. If you want to try bengali food in a new way, this place is where to be. ✌️👍🏻lastly we were so busy filling our apetite we forgot to take piks.😀

Situated at Broad Street, being very close to Ballygunj Phari this is one of the most highly rated places in the city. I decided to drop in here for dinner a couple of weeks back. The ambiance is decent enough and the place is moderately sized. Coming to the food the starters were fabulous specially the Joyous Mutton Chops and Daab Chingri Dynamites. The seafood chowder soup was also decent enough. However, the main course was rather different and did not suit me and let my expectations down. Overall a decent enough place but i preferred the starters much more and pricing here is rather high taking into account the amenities available, with a sumptuous meal for two costing around 2.5k. However, the place can definitely be given a try or two!!

I always love restaurants which go out of their way to try and serve something different. Bohemian in South Kolkata gets extra credit for serving delicious Bengali cuisine with a twist. Tried out the crab and prawn puchka with spiced nolen gur water, vodka soaked prawns, a cucumber and mustard based hilsa fish which was out of the menu and a pantua baked Alaska. The puris of the puchka could have been a little more crisp and the vodka soaked prawns were a little too bland. The hilsa was yum as was the dessert. Service was excellent and the place was cozy and informal.

The place to be for a nice fusion of continental and seafood inspired by the city of joy. The chef takes good care of you with the starters. You cannot go wrong with starters at all. The quantity on the main course is average to share and filling for a single person. The desserts are not great to be honest. Recommended for service and a different cuisine experience

Let me start by saying that Bohemian does make a great first impression. Decor is very eclectic & festive. Tried the Gondoraj flavoured cocktail, quite nice actually. Crab with mustard & cheese was the highlight of the dinner. Shredded lamb with coriander was okay. Murshidabadi Chicken was nice, really liked the pita & poached eggs. Real let down was the Baked Alaska, I have had better versions of this popular classical dessert.

The staffs are very courteous. I can't comment about cocktails. Starters are very good. Regarding main course only Murshidabadi chicken  was very nice and tasty, others are just OK. They have tried something very innovative but you will love it only if you are not familiar with Bengali cuisine and not very able to manage fish bones. Overall I feel the place is overhyped and expensive.

Well known place for Fusion Food, Bohemian does stand out in terms of its unique recipes. May it be puffed rice (muri) coming alongside a cocktail or combining chili pickle (lonkar anchar) with cheese to create a crab appetizer, these guys have done their homework pretty seriously.

With a really pleasant welcome at the gate, assisted parking and a guided walk to the seat, the security personnel were pleasing. I won't give the decoration a very high score, looks more like a used Durga puja pandal set up in an old building. Once seated, they set you up with a bottled water (P.S. Unlike other places they won't ask you if you want it; but if used you're charged for it).
The menu is a book of confusion with all the  fusion stuff but once well explained.
With a complimentary stick of watermelon slices with a couple of sauces on it arouses your taste buds in the beginning. We ordered the very famous and much recommended, "chilli pickel, cheese and crab" for appetizer. It does keep up to the reputation. Truly an orgasmic dish. Next comes up the main course where we ordered a "stuffed chicken breast with cheese and chili pickel" and "pork stewed in bagane mashla". The chicken was undoubtedly amazing with a really well made sauce, nicely stuffed chicken and some sweet rice. The quantity of the rice makes the dish a bit too much for a normal person. However, the pork was no where near what we expected. It was what we call in Bengali, "bhaat ar mangsho". Not very soft, the pork wasn't impressive and even though the curry tasted nice but with the plain white rice it was missing out the special factor. The pork wasn't anything you would be looking for.

As of drinks, we chose "Just Bohemian" and "A new moon over Kolkata". For "Just Bohemian", I would rate them a 20/10. What a beautiful piece of art. The unique flavor of Nolen gur punched on rum, makes it exceptionally amazing. However, the other one failed to impress us as much but I would still say it wasn't bad. Unique flavors and a very strong taste makes the "New moon over Kolkata" a recommendation as well

A few general observations

1) The starters taste heavenly. But are certainly expensive & comes in small plates. Find the balance between how much you want to spend & how many great new flavors you want to discover.

2) The mains however carry considerable amount of food & one is suffice to get your tummy filled up. The accompanying rice or pita breads are also made very well & goes fine with the main dish.

3) The cuisine is an unabashed celebration of khanti bangali cuisine that has the soul of an adventurer. Depending on your palette & willingness to experiment, the hit & miss ratio will play out over the entire menu.

4) The cocktails are also divisive but they are extremely well made & generally you will have more yays than nays. I certainly wouldn't mind a bit more of alcohol in the mix / bit more of the mix itself though.

5) The boys who serve are adept at their game & strives to ensure that the guests have a wholesome time. This is a quality that takes a good place & makes it a great place.

Coming to the particular set of dishes we ordered that day:

The Kolkata Afternoon : White Rum coupled with Lime  Juice & muddled Kancha Lonka rosh. Tangy, zingy, spicy, an absolute winner.

New Moon over Kolkata : This had dark rum & cream but the kick was how panch phoron gunro was infused into it. I generally prefer a citrus base but hey, if you got the balls to put panch phoron in rum & serve it, I'm going to drink it up.

Cheese Baked Crabmeat with Kolmi Greens : We shall be ignoring the fact that they are basically telling us the recipe with each name. Served akin to how you would like your Firni, this was devastatingly beautiful. Cheesy, creamy, full of crab meat, the flavour profile was eclectic. Add it to your must haves.

Gondhoraj Sorbet : Meh. Asia Kitchen makes better Sorbets hands down. This was icy & granular & not worth the price.

Mutton Stir Fried with Browned Onion : I love good mutton. This was good mutton. Reminded me of a traditional Mutton Do-peyaza but damn it was cooked beautifully. 4-5 solid chunks of such soft succulent mutton made my day. It was accompanied with a flavored pita (okay ish, nothing remarkable ) & a sorshe-alu torkari ( this again was a mouth full of flavour ). This whole dish was sinful, hearty & oh so comforting.

Murshidabadi Barbecued Chicken : This was another dish that is very good but just not great. Barbecued chicken came drenched in a creamy harmless sauce along with Pita. They added a bit of sweet picked onions that just reminds you of childhood. But the chicken was a bit bland. Modda kotha, my money will on be mutton , pork & beef here. My intuition asks me to excuse the poultry.

Pantua Baked Alaska : Another winner. Knew it from the very first bite. The pantua elevates the whole dish to a foodgasmic level. Go & have it. This is poetry in your mouth.

Final Verdict : Very happy that I went here. Would go again. They know what they are doing. They do have areas where they can improve but what they offer is should be experienced.

Also two little things that made the beginning & ending sweeter. We were greeted with a few complimentary cubes of picked watermelon with Pudina & Mayo relish. It puts you in the zone. And we billed a total of 2540 that accounts for 1 starter, 2 mains, 1 sorbet, 1 dessert & 2 cocktails. For every 500 we spent we got a discount voucher that we can use up the next time we visit (300 if we visit within 10 days & 150 if under 6 months).

If you are looking for Bengali food with twists, yes this the right place to try that. The best fusion food I ever had!!! Ambience is just awesome with beautiful lights. Staff is very friendly. They serve watermelon with green chutney as a complementary starter. We had chicken in cheese wraps, bhetki in 2 way coriander, and gondhoraj julep as suggested by the staff. The taste, smell everything was too good.Coming to main course we tried Murshidabadi BBQ chicken and vodka soaked prawn. The former was just yummm and I have never tasted such soft prawns. Lastly we tried the Death by chocolate which was also good. I will definitely go back to this restaurant and try other dishes because each and every dish comes with a surprise and twist.

Heard a lot about the bengali fusion food concept, finally got a chance to taste it. Bohemian offers unique bengali fusion food. We tried the 5course lunch. First we were served a slice of watermelon with a chutney as a compliment starter. Then we were served a beverage which you can choose between tamarind mocktail and blue lagoon, the tamarind mocktail is recommended, it tasted really good. Next we were served starters and they tasted amazing. The main course was good but could have been better. Mutton is recommended. The sorbet was okayish, nothing amazing. Mango souffle was good. Overall a medium experience, would try the happy hour menu soon.

On the eve of independence day, we decided to have lunch here and the experience turned out to be an absolute delight. The journey to find this little gem hidden in the alleys of ballygangue was awesome as well. By reaching there, we were greeted by extreme cordial servers. To freshen up ourselves we ordered Bluu and Sex on the beach. While Bluu was okayish, SOTB was too good. Then came the famous crab cake with kolmi, heavenly in one word. The phuchka Festival was going on at that time and as phuchka lovers we were easily lured to order mutton keema phuchka with honey lemon water which was tasty and fun altogether. In the maincourse we chose the Murshidabadi chicken and the Telapia dish but as Telapia was not available the waiter suggested us classic Sorshe Bhetki .Presentation was awesome for both the dishes and while the Bhetki dish was quite flat, the Murshidabadi chicken stole the show. Chicken cooked in delicious white sauce coupled with rosemary potatoes and fried onion in celery was too good to handle. Satisfied and full we decided to have only one desert and that had to be baby pantua baked Alaska as I don't eat star Anis, couldn't order their signature malpua cheesecake. The modified version of baked Alaska was actually better than the classic one and enhanced our happiness a bit more. The place has a nice ambiance but song selections could have been better. Overall the affair was pricey but definitely worth a shot.

Good place with nice decor and excellent food. Probably one of its kind of cuisine (fusion food) in the city. Taste and representation of food menu is quite good and worth mentioning is the varieties. 
I remember visiting this place for dinner and we ordered smoked bhetki (which is their speciality). The portions of the main course dishes are adequate. Sweet dish collection is also fab. 
Great place ! A must try.

1st look at the bar and the reaction comes out 'amazing' followed by the regret that they don't have a seat at the bar. The seatings are a bit crampy. 
     Very good staff. They are very polite, suggest food and drinks, don't make you wait before your orders arrive. Starts with a complementary savoury watermelon quick bite.
        Boho hours are the main attraction. Amazing drinks with a twist of bong food flavours. We took Kolkata Afternoon, Sunrise at Sundarbans, Gondhoraj Martini, Just Bohemian for drinks. All were amazing. For starters we took mutton keema phuchka and bacon wrapped prawns. They were a bit turn off. Coming to the main course, Murshidababdi barbecued chicken was excellent. Finally alcoholic desserts, Perfection and Excellence killed it totally.
         Coming to price it's quite easy on the pockets during the Boho hours. The turnoff was that you cannot order from the main menu during Boho hours.
         All-over lovely experience. Will definitely recommend the place and would love to visit it again.

Fusion food in affordable price...that's BOHO HOURS is all about.My second visit to Bohemian and it has always been charming experience as before,be it in decoration or well trained courteous staff or food. You won't get any main course in BOHO HOURS and we 4 were there to explore the starters and ended up grabbing so many of them.

Cocktails:
Gondhoraj Martini - Absolutely awesome.
Just Bohemian - Little bit more on the sweeter side for Nolen gur
Smoked Pineapple and cracked pepper - Very refreshing
Sunrise at Sunderbans - Average
The Kolkata afternoon - A cocktail prepared with perfect blend
The Kolkata Biryani - We couldn't stand the taste at all.

We had to order Bailey's Irish cream to cope up with the flavor of Kolkata Biryani.

Appetizers:
Cocktail prawn cutlets - All time  favorite and prepared it to perfection
Creamed cheese and pickled chilli wrap - Average
Garlic keema fuchka - First ever phucka for me with this combination.Loved it.
Mustard chicken on toast - Average
Nolen gur glazed pork belly - Very very tasty.
Puchka combo - Best one to order first when you are in mood of phucka experiment !!
Pickled garlic crab on toast - Best one to me. It was very tasty
Smoked chicken and creamed cheese - Average
Steamed chicken envelops - Average

As Dr.Kamalita Mitra suggested in her review that every appetizer item comes with either 3 or 6 in numbers, we find it difficult to properly share among 4 of us.Then again we didn't want to repeat same dish because we wanted to explore more of BOHO delicacy. 

Desert:
Aamarel Custard - Awesome
Ciggar & Coffe mousse - I liked the smoky flavor
Death by choclete - Mind blowing

Visited this place after hearing some really good reviews. We opted for the The Bohemian Brainstorming Munch menu that was available on the weekdays. First spiced watermelon was given for tongue cleanser. For drinks tarmarind refresher (Recommended) and bluu were served. Both were really good. Then came the starters, the items tasted good but the portions were too little. I would recommend the prawn and cheese wrap. Then sorbet was served as a palate cleanser where the flavours available was guava and green mango chilli sorbet and we disliked both the flavours.
For the main course the different items are served along with rice, aloo posto and saag. Here we opted for prawns in mustard and coriander, mutton with gondhoraj and coconut milk and chicken shimmered in raduni. The item with prawn was good but i failed to understand what was so special and fusion in that dish because it was nothing extraordinary. The mutton item was cooked well and the flavours were strong, recommended. The chicken one was again a disappointment which tasted like a regular chicken gravy with vegetables with no such great experiment. The crab ceylon curry was not available.

For the dessert mango mousse with spiced watermelon was served which was very average. Thus disappointed with the food available in this menu. It charged 537/- each. Prices are on the higher side.

The ambience is awesome decorated with lamps all over and the restaurant look so pretty. Very nice decor. The staff are well mannered and trained hence good service.

My very first review on Zomato and what better place to begin with than this beautiful restaurant so aptly named as 'Bohemian'! 
Location- Old ballygunge. Perhaps best reached by app cabs. 
Decor- there is something feel good and different about this place right from the moment the guard walks you in. Special points for the bar which definitely stood out. 

Cocktails- Gondhoraj Martini, Kolkata Afternoon, Sunrise at Sundarbans, Just Bohemian. 
We went during the Boho hours when the cocktails were dirt cheap. Very experimental and satisfies every bit of the 'good cocktail' craving. Must have- Just Bohemian. 

Appetizers- Garlic Keema Mutton Phuchka and Bacon Wrapped Prawns. 
I love anything bacon and this was definitely good. Nothing extraordinary though. The Phuchka especially the lemon water on the side was a let down. 

Main Course- Murshidabadi Barbecued Chicken with Wine Poached Eggs. Words fail to justify how heavenly this dish was! Right from the perfectly cooked, moist chicken to the Pita breads and the onion chutney! Must,must, must have. 

Dessert- From the Boho Hours Menu- Perfection and Excellence. Perfection was vodka based. It was alright. Excellence, a whisky based ice cream, was beyond excellent to say the least. One bite and you'd be lulled into a delirium. Again, a must have. 

Definitely going back to Bohemian again.

“Bohemian” generally refers to those who live unconventional and refined lives. This splendid Boho culture gains recognition not by virtue of its atypical fashion alone, but also through its bewitching cuisine. ‘Bohemian’ is located in Ballygunge, which is an exceptional place for unconventional and enticing Bengali food. The alluring cuisine is a fusion of Bengali and Continental delicacies, which indeed validate the name of the restaurant.
                                                                ...

Terribly disappointing. Failed to understand what the hype was about. Visited after hearing raving reviews of this place. Reached late in the afternoon when they only serve limited appetizers, desserts and drinks.
The reason behind visiting this place was to try their experimental food.
First off, the staff completely failed to recommend anything on the menu. Huge set-back for a place serving off-beat food Took shots in the dark and ordered bhetki fry with three way coriander. It was average. Next, their garlic crab on toast was good but again not impressive. (Note: ordered both due to what seemed like lack of better options and not with any specific expectations).
Coming to the desserts. They looked fantastic. But tasted terrible. (Cigar and coffee mouse and aamarel custard)
Cherry on top: was pretty much ushered out of the place around 17:15. We were the only ones left. Not sure what their business hours are but specifically checked Zomato before visiting and was under the impression they were open all day.

It feels good when you have good food...something which many good restaurants across the city do...but the feelling of experiencing art and revitalising your taste buds is something you have to go to Bohemian for!!
Exceptional flavours , uncharacteristic aroma and the sheer theatre present in the food at Bohemian ...sets a different class to the restaurant.

Kudos to Chef Joy....and hope to experience the gastronomic art again and again!!!!

There have been very few times that a restaurant experience leaves such a wonderful after taste..which one will cherish for years to come!!!

Visited this place to celebrate my wife's birthday. We were greeted by an indifferent waiter who had an annoyed look plastered on his face. The wrong appetizers came out  and the waiter was nowhere to be found. Anyway we were still willing to give it a pass as we were assigned a different host for the night. But alas that was not the end of the bad night. The fishes in the main course especially the 'pabda' and 'parshe' were horrible. The waiter came and took feedback and we thought he would do something about it. But funnily,they neither offered any other dish nor waived off the amount. And when the night could not have been any worse, we saw the bill. We found that on top of bringing incorrect appetizers, the waiter had actually brought in three dishes instead of just the one (kolmi crab). We were never told about it at the beginning. They have an unscrupulous way of fleecing customers, that is the impression I got. It started right at the beginning when they started serving bottled packaged water even w/o asking if we needed it, in the middle when they took orders for extra dishes without informing us and then at the end by not mentioning the portion of the food they were going to serve. As we were six of us, we ordered six entrees thinking the portions would be small. They never had the courtesy to let us know that we would not be able to finish them off. We had to waste a lot of food and we hate wasting. It is such a waste of resources. I declined the coupons that they offer every customer and also declined to write their feedback form in protest. Anyway my night was ruined.

No Main Course... Seriously! Like I don't get it. Its Appetizers or nothing and the menu is very small also and I didn't like the menu. One thing noticeable about this place is that Alcohol is very cheap. Well I am not sure if that is a good thing or bad but it is cheap, especially if you reach the place between 4pm to 7pm...its called "Boho Hours"!!! The decor is nice, the stuff is good enough, quality of food is not great but not bad also. Pork was too salty though. What I liked the least is the position of the restaurant. God! You need to climb the narrow stairs and the actual restaurant is on 2nd floor and its pretty tiny. So on a busy day you might have to wait for a long time outside(standing as there is no waiting area). Overall experience ok ok... Probably not going again there,who knows? Let's see...

Bohemian Tickles the taste buds with an amazing fusion of Bengali and continental dishes. A date with my wife truly turned amazing with its unique cocktail fusion called Gondhoraj Martini. A rather curious blend of Aam kasundi will tickle the spicy buds when you order a Am kasundi  soaked chicken escalops .. Murshidabadi barbecued chicken and super awesome mutton delicacy Kacha lonka Mangsho keeps tummy satisfied. Finally Malpua cheesecake will make you feel complete.. A sure comeback.

First let me congratulate chef Joymalya for being an innovator. Kolkata food is good, but most restaurants are not coming up with anything new. Here is where chefs like Joymalya need our patronage and praise.
Ok, now about the food ( we went there during the happy hour or boho hours as they like to call it, so only starters drinks and cocktails were available ):
Crab and prawn phuchka .. Awesome. The sweet water along with the phuchka was good , but they tasted better when eaten separately. Same thing about the pork on papri combination. The papri overpowered the dish. The pork was however perfectly cooked and deserves to be a complete dish on its own. The other starters were also good.
One point which I must bring up is bhetki done 3 ways was actually done one way ( not good).
Cocktails were great. The chilly chicken cocktail was too good. Overall it was a great experience. Keep on experimenting!!

A lot of places serve good food, However, there are very few places where you eat and then you go wow! For me, Bohemian is one of them.

We had Vodka soaked prawns, Kacha lanka Mangho (Goat meat in green chilli paste) and sizzled bhetki served with celery rice. We loved each and every dish. For drinks we had gondhoraj julep and mint julep.

Mr. Saptarshi, who was serving us, was advised about my wife's gluten intolerance. He went above and beyond to ensure that we were served only gluten free stuff.

The service was very friendly and we would definitely want to come back again

My friend and I dropped in at Bohemian today (13.07.2017) during the BOHO HOURS. 
The place is easy to find, the staff was extremely prompt. They attended to us immediately.
We ordered
Gondhoraj Martini, Just Bohemian cocktails, Heineken Beer, Smoked Fish on toast and Smoked Chicken Cheese wrap. 
We loved the cocktails, from how they were served to how they tasted, excellent in terms of presentation. 
What disappointed us was the smoked chicken cheese wrap. We were expecting a burrito filling wrap. Instead it's just fried momos with Chicken and cheese filling. 
The smoked fish on toast is something unique for someone like me who has never tasted something like this. It was well made. With the right amount of cheese and herbs. 
What I loved here was the service, the cocktails. They could include some more options in the appetizers section during BOHO HOURS. Otherwise this place is Recommend.

You all are well acquainted with the term ‘bohemian‘ quite frequent these days; used to denote somebody who is socially uncustomary and shows an active involvement in arts. Very recently, I was invited for a bloggers’ meet at one of Kolkata’s newest restaurants BOHEMIAN and from my experience, I would take the pleasure to say that this place has been rightfully named. The credit goes to the chef Joymalya Banerjee for perfectly curating the atypical and unconventional cocktails and those delectable fusion Bengali food, and making the name sound perfect.

First let me congratulate chef Joymalya for being an innovator. Kolkata food is good, but most restaurants are not coming up with anything new. Here is where chefs like Joymalya need our patronage and praise.
Ok, now about the food ( we went there during the happy hour or boho hours as they like to call it, so only starters drinks and cocktails were available ):
Crab and prawn phuchka .. Awesome. The sweet water along with the phuchka was good , but they tasted better when eaten separately. Same thing about the pork on papri combination. The papri overpowered the dish. The pork was however perfectly cooked and deserves to be a complete dish on its own. The other starters were also good.
One point which I must bring up is bhetki done 3 ways was actually done one way ( not good).
Cocktails were great. The chilly chicken cocktail was too good. Overall it was a great experience. Keep on experimenting!!

Before ordering the main course I asked the staff if the main course is individual or good enough to share, to which he mentioned about making a combo for the group (mix of different things) . Then when I got the bill I really felt cheated . Just because it was my fault that I didn't ask the price when the staff was selling me the so called combo so I didn't say anything but seriously i never had such an experience in past....
Coming to food there is lot of innovation when it comes to fusion but there is still scope of improvement

If any of you have listened to the Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen, you know that its more than just a song, its a piece of art. Bohemian restaurant is nothing short of that. I became the biggest fan of this place ever since the 1st time I put their food in my mouth. Coming to bottom line, this place is squeeze into the 2nd floor of a small building, the stairs that lead to it is too small for two persons to walk together. As I stepped into the restaurant, I was quite captivated with the way the have decorated the place despite the constraints in space and you can hear best of 70s rock on the stereo & whoever it is that chose those songs has great taste in music. The interior is dimly lit up with lamps and coloured papers hanging from the ceiling which looks quite interesting but lit enough for you to see your food properly. Now getting to the real deal, the food, this place has literally upped the ante for the way I'm gonna expect the food to be, at other restaurants. We ordered " Vodka Soaked Prawns, Bhetki smoked with cumin & quartered Darjeeling chilli and Chilli Pickel & Cheese baked 🦀 Crabs with Kolmi greens" on the starters. The Prawns and Bhetki tasted quite remarkable but the Crab was unparalleled, phenomenal and beyond anything I've ever tasted. As I put the 1st bite into my mouth, I felt like I was staring at the face of God. For a moment there, I felt so sorry for my vegetarian friends that I wanted to cry. Moving on to the main course, we ordered "Pabda Rolls stewed in cherry tomatoes & spinach broth and Panchphoron flavoured Parshe fillets with seasoned green chili sauce". It is to be noted that both the courses come with flavoured rice so you don't need to order extra rice. Every single bite of it felt like a symphony. I cursed myself for having waited so long to visit this eatery. I honestly had a grrrrrrrreat time and can't wait to be back to this hole with a much larger pack of friends. I can't stop talking about this place to my friends and family. Will be back soon, with higher expectations. Also, tip the guys well, without them the place wouldn't be as epic as we know it.

Honestly, I was slightly reluctant to visit this place. Bengali cuisine and that too fusion was not really tempting me. At the back of my mind was the thought " I have visited calcutta after so long and I cant just leave without having biryani".  So, it was a choice between biryani and bohemian. Finally, on my husband's insistence chose bohemian.
It was noon and a weekday; so there was no rush. We ordered for some coolers to begin with followed by a starter and main course. 

Cold Beverage: Gondhoraj Julep was fantastic. 
Starter: We ordered for vodka soaked prawns. It was absolutely delicious. The best part was, even though it was slightly customized as the staff claimed it was due to the fact that they didnot use the starch based sauce/coating ( as I am gluten intolerant) it tasted heavenly. 
Main Course: Superb they were!! ordered kancha lonka mangsho and sizzled bhetki which came with celery rice. Both the items were just awesome. 
Overall an unique experience. 

If I would have chosen to go for biryani, I would have seriously missed something. It is by far one of my best eat-out experience in calcutta till date.

This place is highly recomended.

Such quirky way of serving the food! We had biriyani cocktail, kolkata afternoon along with non-veg fuchka combo and received a complementary dish of spicy pineapple. The kolkata afternoon was a refreshing drink containing orange and aam-adaa(mango -ginger). The biriyani cocktail didn't live upto our expectations- it tasted like a bitter water with a smell of biriyani. Also the aloo was too small. The non-veg fuchka was a great experience- there were two flavours- prawn and mutton keema. I liked the spicy prawn variety better. Overall a good experience- very good staff behaviour and since we went during the Boho hours, the bill was about 600 for two.

It took me a lot of  time to visit this place. When I did, I was in for a treat. The atmosphere is cozy and the food is BOMB! The most regular food blended with some weird choice of ingredients (not one you would opt for in general) came like a breath of fresh air on the plate. I was beyond happy. For anyone who is still out there who hasn't been to this place yet. GO. NOW!

Was suggested by a friend while casually chit chatting. Instantly we decided to check the place out. Well located and awesomely decorated. 
Now the food. I would say it's a bengali cuisine restaurant but none of the delicacies are the orthodox ones. They serve Pabda, crab, Hilsa, chicken mutton in a total different style. They serve u the drink too in a fusion style. We were 3in count. 
We ordered Just bohemian, Gonghoraj Martini and Smoked pineapple & cracked pepper. Awesome drinks. Each one delicately made and we were totally surprised. With the drinks we were suggested to try Vodka soaked prawns and Topse fritters with kalojeera and poppy seeds. Wonderful and mouth watering dishes. But the prawn sizes could have been bigger. 
For main course we ordered Pabda rolls stewed in cherry tomato and spinach broth, chital meat steak with bay leaf and fenugreek jus and Murshidabadi Barbecued chicken. Again we were surprised by the fusion dishes. Unorthodox dishes which gives u a tinch of bengali flavour and u say wow. 
Last we took Malpua Cheesecake and cigar and coffee mousse. Malpua cheesecake is a cheesecake stuffed with Malpua in layers. Aaaaha lovely... :-). Cigar and coffee mousse gives u a strong cigar smell and taste like coffee that too strong coffee. Again Aaaaha lovely. 
The staff were very friendly and always ready to serve u with surprises and suggestions. 
If u are lover of fusion foods this place is must. I would like to go back to that joint again and again.

At a first glance it is difficult to comprehend that in such a small place there can be a restaurant which is one of the best destinations for foodies of Kolkata. All foods this restaurant offers are it's signature dishes and hence unique. This is the best restaurant for trying out new recipes.
Now about quality of food, ambience and service. All are top notch. Some food might not be liked by some who do not like experimentation with food. This restaurant is not for them.
Only negative is price for which I have deducted .5 point. This is quite costly restaurant.

This place is popular for its bengali fusion food and we were always interested in trying such innovative dishes as we love experimenting with new kind of food.
When I spotted this place,we decided to visit it today and did pre booking.
Even on weekdays there is a huge crowd here and the reason is certainly the great food.
Before coming to food,I would love to say about the ambience.
A place so pretty (much prettier than the pics given on zomato) with a bong touch of lamp lit on each table giving the romantic feels.
The place is very well decked up from the entry itself,neatly maintained and nice music adds to the good mood.
So here the Amazing combo is on and we two took one each.
They gave us spiced watermelon as a tongue cleanser and it was so nice.

We took two drinks-Blu and Tamarind refreshner.
•Tamarind refreshner-Imli water is what we generally have in panipuris.But here it has been blended with other ingredients to make an absolutely refreshing drink.We loved it.

For starters we had Chicken mustard honey bag and crab cake.Two pieces of each are given.
•Chicken mustard honeybag-Its much like steamed mustard chicken in banana leaf but far tastier than the regular ones we have.Nicely spiced up and served with a perfect honey dip.
•Crab cake-Crab cakes are pretty good with finely minced crab meat.The dip was an unique orange mayo but it tasted bitter.So we avoided the dip.

For main course we chose two items from the set menu.We had Gondhoraj coconut milk mutton and Prawn in mustard coriander.
Maincourse is served with saag,rice and potatoes in mustard.I loved that potato accompainment.
•Prawn in mustard coriander-Three pieces of prawn in a tasty mustard coriander curry was perfect.Recommended.
•Gondhoraj mutton in coconut milk-Two pieces of mutton cooked so well was our favourite dish from the combo.Highly recommended.The gondhoraj flavour is strong and cooked smoothly in coconut milk tasted heavenly.

Now coming to the dessert.They had fruit salad and unripe mango mousse.We had both each.
The mango mousse is spicy and tasted nice.The fruit salad was average.

•Apart from this,we took a parshe filltet in panchphoron curry,served with ghee rice and minted cucumber.The fish was obviously boneless and soft but yes it is overpriced.I really loved the curry since i love the spices used in it.
All dishes are explained well and can be chosen according to preferences.

The staffs are well mannered.
We had to wait a bit for the maincourse and thats understandable.
Overall service is great.They clean the tables in regular intervals.
Ambience is also one attraction.
We will surely visit this place again to try more of the fusion items. :)

Tugged in quaint turn of a network of roads in Ballygunge, this one surely needs no introduction. Glass jars and yellow bulbs led us up to a softly lit restaurant known  to take the global Bengali cuisine up by a notch. 

Minimalism at its best with natural lamps on each table and only strings of square-cut solid flags hung from the ceiling- the only colour break in the otherwise basic interiors. 

Coming straight to the food, Pickled Chili and cheese steamed Bhetki went well with a glass of Gondhoraj Julep( a blast of cool and natural aromatic greens with a generous dash of wild lime). My friend was happy sipping on his glass of Heineken. 
The main course was simple. Bagane Mashla (Bengal herbs) and cheese stewed pork came with enough greens to balance the roughage. Baby potatoes and  corn, carrots, broccoli and mushrooms neatly stewed in a delicate brown gravy with a hint of spice and melting cheese on  top. Kolmi greens with roasted garlic as tiny sides were delightful. Gondhoraj and yogurt prawns were mild and soft in a well balanced (hint at just the right inclusion of sweetness) white  gravy. A treat for those who like it fuss - free! 

Too full, but can't go without the dessert once that I am in for a Bohemian lunch. So we went for the tried and tested - the Malpua Cheesecake. Those who have had a mouthful of that unbelievably soft chhena-cake flavoured with star anise,  discreetly carrying layers of malpua doused in ghee have nothing new to gain from here, and for the rest, well reasons why it's significant!!

When it comes to fusion food and beverages in Kolkata, Chef Joymalya Chatterjee knows what he is doing and the end result is the delectable yet interesting fusion spread in Bohemian.  Bohemian, has recently come up with the concept t of Boho Hours, from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. they are serving food (mainly finger food) and alcoholic beverages (mostly cocktails) at a reduced prices. The menu, however, is not at all a reduced one and is, in fact, an elaborate to choose for.

The latest attraction is the "BOHO HOURS". Everyday you  from 4pm to 7pm you can taste some amazing cocktails and finger food at amazingly lower prices. The pocket pinch is around 300(exclusive of taxes)!!I strongly recommend the Honey Glazed Pork bellies on Papri, The bacon wrapped, The variety of puchkas with Honey Lemon water. 
From the cocktail section one can try Made in Heaven,Kolkata biriyani

Fusion food is not everybody’s cup of tea. Wherein some places think of fusion food as mixing multiple contrasting flavors and creating some unpalatable shit, few, very few chefs understand which flavors complement  and use them to create something different.

I’ve heard a lot about this place called Bohemian near Bullygunge Phari and moreover, chef Joymalya Banerjee. But this time, surprisingly, my mom wished to go there. She had read about this place in some magazine and was curious to try out the so-called fusion food. And frankly being the poor person I am, I always study the offering of a place beforehand.

So, from Zomato, I understood, there’s an offer for combo meals there and that gave me the courage to go. So, off we went on one humid evening. The parking was not a problem and smooth, the place had 2 floors, wherein we chose ground floor for mother’s easy access.

Service was super-prompt. And the service staff was trained really well and for the betterment of the owner. They offered us the regular menu-card and not the combo one- which is pretty understandable. But, upon asking, we were given the same. And off course, the main menu items were ordered from there. So, we ordered for the combo for 3 of us and one portion non-veg phuchka combo. 

First, let me take the liberty of talking about the non-veg phuchka combo. There were 6 phuchkas (3 varieties of 2 pcs each). The best of the lot was the Hilsa phuchka with mustard and tender coconut water. The hilsa (thankfully) was having a subtle flavor and the filling water made it’s day. Wherein, the Mutton Keema phuchka was slightly spicy and the water was having a distinct flavor. My son loved the crab and prawn phuchka.

The tamarind cooler was a regular one and nothing special. But, it was a refreshing change from the usual bottled soft drinks. 

The starters were served with 2 pcs in each dish. The prawn cheese wrap was more like a samosa and was pretty regular, the chicken and mustard honey bag was good. It was properly spiced and the mustard flavor was prominent. Unlike the regular joints, the steaming was done just perfectly and it was not soggy. But, out of the 3 starters, the best of the lot was pork in banana leaf. It was basically a minced pork meat paturi and simply mind-blowing. And, if they’re available on an a la carte menu, it’s a definite must-have. 

Being a bong, my family loves fish. And, we ordered for the Topse fritters with poppy seeds and kalojeera, apart from the regular combo. In a bong layman’s language, it was boneless topse fried with a regular batter flavored with kalojeera and the crispiness owed to the poppy seeds. Though the taste was damn good, I would prefer a slightly bigger portion size for that price range. After all these starters, the guava and rock-salk sorbet was a great palate cleanser. Anyhow, a good classic sorbet is pretty difficult to find in city in mid-range restaurants and definitely Bohemian is an exception. Without this combo also, the sorbet is a must-order-item. 

and, though we were kinda half-full, it’s time for the main course. We ordered for Betki rolls with pomegranate and mustard, mutton with gandharaj & coconut milk and spicy pork curry. Frankly, the betki rolls were extremely average. Though the pomegranate seeds gave few interesting bites in the gravy, the rolls were pretty average. Mutton was sublime. It had a strong flavor of Gandharaj lime and subtlety of the coconut milk, which gave the gravy its smooth texture. The good part is, all the dishes are served with a good amount of rice, a spied potato chorchori and some saag bhaja with bori (I am ignorant about these saags, apologies). So, one dish made a complete meal. But, the surprise element was the spicy pork curry. It was out of the world. We packed some pork vindaloo for home, but found out the next day, that we should’ve actually packed that spicy pork curry instead. No, it was not that spicy, but the punch was rather prominent and it went extremely well with the plain rice. Another good part is, the pork quality. All the pork dishes had lean pork meat- without the fat and it made my day. If I go back again (which I will), I am going to order this one dish, definitely. 

By this time, my son was bored with all the food and it’s actually evident from his facial expression above and we were hurrying for the dessert. For all the 3 portions, we’ve ordered for the green mango mousse with spicy condiments. Wherever I am not sure, I tend to take advise of the server (instead of applying my under-prepared brain) and it had saved me numerous times. Such was the case here. Of recent times, I’ve hardly come across any dessert such as this and I can vouch for that. The mousse had the required smoothness with the crunchy bite of burnt garlic (I am not so sure) and the effect inside mouth was outstanding. We were speechless for a few minutes. Impressed by this, we went ahead and ordered for the gulabjamun baked alaska and frankly, it was a semi-disaster. In kolkata, let authenticity be damned, we are spoiled with the baked alaska that Mocambo makes (rather the amount of meringue). So, when this one came with less meringue and a layer of vanilla icecream inside and with the filling of some mini gulabjamun (a day’s old maybe), we wished, we should’ve stayed with another portion of the Green mango mousse instead. But, like a good one-night stand, we were full to have another portion. 

Overall, a few suggestions,

With the main dish in the combo, instead of a plain rice (however long-grained it might be), some flavored rice would’ve given us the perfect orgasm … afterall, who’ve prepared such sexy beauties, won’t mind preparing some jasmine rice or some other variety for the otherwise good-food-deprived city

And, the day-old gulabjamun seriously hurt our near-perfect dinner-experience

But, keep up with the mousse and it was simply divine

This is a place which I absolutely adore..The ambience and the food served here are delights to a foodie. I have visited here a number of times with my friends and family and treated my taste buds to dishes, which combined disparate items, juggled with spices,producing a distinct punch to the senses which entailed even after you left.
Starting from juleps and sorbets to the desserts it leaves you impressed by the impeccable presentations along with culinary skills.
My favourites: Gondhoraj sorbet,joyous mutton chops,smoked bhetki with cumin and chilli,bacon wrapped chicken with Aam Kashundi reduction,chicken wrapped with nolen gur,cheese baked crab,prawn and crabmeat dumpling in spicy nolen gur reduction,malpua cheese cake, mustard and coconut Mousse,death by chocolate....pheww..And all with their distinct taste and uniqueness.
So without further ado, I would therefore recommend every foodie in kolkata who have not visited this place yet, to venture out once to relish this perfect blend of bengali and continental cuisine..This is definitely worth the money..

Our server was polite and helpful, but the spice levels were a tad too high for my liking. Coming from another city to eat here, I didn't expect bacon wrapped chicken to be immersed in... A bowlful of gravy?
I like the idea of fusion food, which is highly experimental, creative and well presented. But spice levels for me, were a bit harsh on the tongue.

The place reflects every bit of its name. You will find the most unconventional but mouthwatering Bengali cuisine with a surprise twist added to each of it. In the starter's you must try Special phuchka with crab and prawn or Hilsha. It also has a wide range of cocktails in which I tried Just Bohemian which is Nolen gur with Old monk and has a little spicy touch and this can't be anything else than Just Bohemian. The vodka soaked prawn is also ecstatic and melt in the mouth. In the main course you have got lot of options to choose from Fish, chicken, mutton, pork all with an unique recipe. In the desert you may try Peace (which is ripe mango with old monk) and/or cigar and coffee mousse. For a 4 course meal it costs around 3000 for two people. In the week days you may get buffet with non-alcoholic drinks in just Rs.449 plus tax.

Excellent concept and presentation of Bengali fusion food. Elaborate choice of fish, chicken, mutton, crab etc. The staff is very efficient and will help u choose ur dish ! We tried boneless Hilsa in mustard and cucumber gravy; prawn in gandharaj flavoured curry for main course.  A very unique version of daab chingri for starters .
Dont miss their sorbets and desserts - Bohemian is a  class apart .

Bohemian is a restaurant I’ve been hearing about since long! It has been recommended by close friends , relatives among other and thus has been on my wish list for quite some time now . Hence a fortnight back on a Sunday coinciding with Mother’s Day I had decided to visit with my parents the restaurant that serves (to quote them) a “ curious blend of Bengal and Continental cuisine” .

The restaurant can be found on a five minutes walk from Ballygunge Phari crossing towards Bondel Gate. The place has a small but cute entrance that opens to a more spacious interior .The decor was simple yet elegant with colourful posters of musical bands , lanterns fixed affix the ceiling and small flags in a line crisscrossing from atop . 

We had arrived at almost 3pm , a bit late for lunch after a movie screening . A small group of three , on entering  we were allocated to a seat near the entrance door , even though there were empty tables at the back! They had small three / four sitter tables which they would join if and when a large gathering would arrive. However even on insistence we were seated at the small table by the door , where one would get constantly disturbed by people coming in and going out! Sometime later they did offer us a different table , but by that time we had already ordered and settled in . 

Coming to the food , this being my first experience at the place I stuck with the highly recommended items , Cheese Baked Crab,  Kancha Lonka Mangsho, Bacon Wrapped Chicken and Malpua Cheesecake. We had ordered the first three at a go , and the Cheese Baked Crab came after 15 minutes. It  tasted nice . The crab was minced and could be barely felt , it was mainly about the other ingredients and cheese! However the horror followed soon after that. Like I had noted earlier , we were a bit late for lunch and thus was obviously very hungry . At the time of taking the order the staff did not inform us about the unavailability of any dish or the delay in preparation time , which they should have had done! We sat there waiting for the main course after finishing the starters , ... and it came only 45 minutes too soon! The staff were distracted and were seldom looking towards the direction of our table and since we were seated at the far end from the kitchen entrance it took quite an effort to attract their notice . A small request for table salt went unheard and I had to summon the waiter twice or thrice to get it delivered to the table!

As for the food the Kancha Lonka Mangsho was served with steamed rice . The gravy was too rich with coconut flavour and coriander leaves along with strong mustard oil smell for our liking ,the pieces were okay , the only saving grace being the steamed rice . 

The Bacon Wrapped Chicken on the other hand was too sweet , the gravy and the Dalia which accompanied it both would have fared better without the extra sweetness . The chicken wrapped with bacon however tasted nice , when unaccompanied by the gravy .

Next we ordered for the dessert which promptly came. But again the Malpua Cheesecake was a bad example of fusion , the cake having  really thin and almost indistinguishable Malpua strips lacking any punch . The Cake was bland at it’s best! 

The food was quite pricey , the bill coming to almost three thousand rupees and the staff aloof , failing to notice the customer’s demands or even hold the door for the lady as we were going out ( which they did for other customers , and probably us expressing our displeasure at the service prompted them to withdraw the basic manners for us ).

Overall a below average experience , where  the appetite was killed by the immense delay! 

Final Verdict : Over hyped and definitely not worthy of a second visit!
                    P.S.Being a first time visitor I had no idea that the restaurant expanded to the first floor and probably we could have been more comfortably seated if directed to the same !

Bohemian – Must say a ‘totally’ unconventional restaurant. A bong fusion food . Location & Intro:. I was going from Fish Fish to Chowman (ballygunge) and i kept going straight (Crossed a crossing) until i saw bohemian on the right. Not very difficult to locate at all. Bohemian is Chef Joy Banerjee’s curation. I was invited by Anusreea and Swarnava for a bloggers meet to try out some of the food items here. It was Sunday lunch time when we decided to sit on the first floor. Saptarshi (steward) was taking care of us when we hit this place. The entrance to this restaurant is quite quirky. It is well decorated with graffiti and flags and i really liked it. We were made to sit on the first floor. The place has got flags all over. It has a bar too which curates amazing and unique cocktails. I was a part of bloggers meet there.
                                                                ...

We tried out the famed Kanchalonka Mangsho, Pork Vindaloo and Murshidabadi Barbecued Chicken with Pita Breads. Each and every dish was fantabulous. We ordered dab chingri dynamites and vodka prawn as appetizers and our taste buds will remain indebted to them. The stunners of our dine out day were indeed the flavoured fuchkas, - Hilsa Fuchka and Crab-Prawn Fuchka. Though we loved the pantua baked Alaska and Cigar-coffee mousse but the Malpua cheesecake mildly disappointed us with it mildly enhanced seasoning of fennel seeds. It would have been perfect if the fennel seasoning was subtle.

Joymalya Banerjee's dream and vision Bohemian has been a reality for almost six years now. Bohemian is a place where you will find innovations and experimentation with food and drinks always. Some combinations will sound wild some tempting and some very interesting but one thing will be common, euphoria. Come with your family or friends, have a party.. Reasons are endless to come to this place.. Located at one of the most prime and posh locations of Kolkata, Ballygunge.

The taste is something you have never ever tasted, be it the cocktails or the starters or the main course or desserts. Its an experience.

Bohemian offers you fusion Bengali cuisine at its best. As a vegetarian, I took a bold move to book a table at this restaurant mainly known for its fish. I spent the night before going through mostly all the reviews to find some mention of a veg appetizer or entrée but found one obscure mention of a veg entrée without the name of the dish. I was having second thoughts about going here.
When I reached Bohemian, I was greeted by friendly waiters who brought me wet towelettes for the heat outside which was a very considerate move. While going through the menu it was  disappointing to see a total of 4-5 entrées for vegetarians and the rest of the menu dedicated to fish and poultry. I know that Bengali cuisine has a lot of potential for innovative veg food but it wasn't highlighted by the chef. Although from a limited menu, the veg food we ordered was really good! 
We ordered some corn and spinach with lentil crisps, and  banana stem patties for appetizers. The corn and spinach one was really good. The spinach was soft and creamy, the wrap of lentil crisps had an amazing crunch, the taste and texture was well balanced. The banana stem patties were a let down; it was nothing really great and could do without it. A non veg friend of mine ordered the barbecued pomfret sunderban style which he loved. The portions were good and they were usually served with dips or chutneys which enhanced the flavor. 
For entrées we ordered cheese stuffed cherry tomatoes and baby potatoes, and mushroom and long beans baked in spicy coconut... (don't know the rest of it) 
Both were very rich curries served with flattened rice or steamed rice. I especially loved the mushroom and long beans bakes in spicy coconut. The gravy was flavorful and so good that you would want to eat it everyday till you got sick of it which seemed impossible because it was so good. 
My non veg friend ordered the foil baked Bhetki which he devoured as soon as he got it and while filling out a feedback form for the restaurant, described it as orgasmic. 
For drinks we ordered the gondhoraj julep and a mint julep and both of them were refreshing and had a tweaked taste which elevated their status as mocktails. 
The portions are good and you'd usually get full so leave some space for dessert or a palate cleanser. 

Bohemian is the best place you can take people to who you want to impress. I took my friend here who was visiting Kolkata for a short time and wanted to eat Bengali food (and me not being a Bengali and inexperienced with Bengali food took up the challenge) and he said that it was the best meal he has had in this city. 

The only disappointment was their limited vegetarian food which I hope they work on and expand as I'd love to be a regular without running out of things to order on my second visit. 

It's a little pricey but the food is worth it.

I have been wanting to visit bohemian for a long time now after their bar opened just to sample the innovative cocktails and yesterday seemed like the perfect evening. Its been a while i visited the place run by the affable and music inclined chef joy and we were looking forward to excellence as usual.

We ordered a kolkata biryani which is a vodka based cocktail with an attar base and baby biryani potatoes as a garnish. The drink was refreshing and the smell of the attar was quite close to a liquid biryani though a measure of spice would have been good too just to play with the senses. 

The next cocktail was a bohemian special. Old monk mixed with liquid jaggery and a lovely spicy moa as an accompaniment. The drink was sweet and the gur gave good balance and complimented the sweetness of the old monk rum which was the base spirit. 

The starter was a bakes crab and cheese dish which had decent quantity of crab meat but was really too cheesy. We also ordered a lentil soup that was fabulous with the right amount of panchphoron. 

The main course is where this review went right from 5 to 2.5. I ordered a chicken breast with stuffed kolmi greens and flat rice pilaf. The pilaf was nice and fluffy and was slightly sweet. The gravy was spicy though again heavy on the cheese. However, the chicken breast was not well done and worst of all we found traces of human hair in the kolmi saag. We tried cutting into different sections of the breast slices but found a lot of hair which rendered the entire dish inedible. The captain did offer to change the dish but the replacement was hurriedly done and i again found the chicken undercooked and the gravy overtly cheesy. By then my appetite was lost and i returned the discount voucher which was offered to me as well. 

Sadly, no one from the management offered to talk to me and it was the captain who kept apologizing and running around. A classic case of a wonderful experience being soured. If only they washed their vegetables better, i am sure i would have had a better experience.

Just an exceptionally wonderful place. The truly try to blend the East with the West. Amazing spin-off to the usual Bengali dishes and great presentation. I had the Non-Veg puchkas with fish and meat filling and I'm still not over the fact that they tasted brilliant. For Main Course I had Murshidabad Chicken in a creamy sauce with a wine poached egg. I'm very impressed with the place. It's a must visit if you love food.

Once is not enough. (The Phuchka festival is on here right now. So before I forget to mention, all daredevils who love phuchka but also love to experiment with their taste buds, visit now!)

This place is crazy cool! The chef is probably some culinary genius magician person because I have not tasted food this good and this unique. The signature Gondhoraj Martini with the little roshogollas was very refreshing. My personal favorite, the Just Bohemian. Rum, ginger, and nolen gur - this just cannot go wrong. 

There was a cute pre appetizer of little watermelon pieces with mint chutney and yogurt. We had the non vegetarian phuchka combination platter which had two of each of the three varieties they are offering - crabmeat and shrimp, minced meat, hilsa; each to go with a different kind of water. 

As for main courses, again a personal favorite was the chicken breast with kolmi greens. It was an orgasm of flavors in my mouth with the steamed vegetables and the flattened rice pilaf! Kacha lonka mangsho was really good, closer to our palate than the others. Another surprise was the Pabda rolls stewed in cherry tomatoes and spinach broth. Delicious is an understatement.

Dessert was Malpua cheesecake, which is sin foodified. A sin I would commit over and over and over and over again. 

There's only so much justice my words can do to how fantastic this place is. Hats off to the chef. Definitely coming back for more!

Chef Joy Banerjee has outdone himself with the abundant innovative menu, which is Bengali at heart. Normally fusion foods try to "westernize" classic Indian dishes but the Bohemian stays true to all original Bengali ingredients yet coquettishly plays with them. The Kolkata biryani cocktail plays tricks on the mind- a vodka based drink with all the flavours of a biryani, complete with the aloo. The smoked pineapple cocktail had me, a pineapple hater, head over heels. The vodka shrimp is exquisite. And don't miss their phuchka festival... I recommend the ilish phuchka (yes, ilish). The menu items may be too much for a mind accustomed to conventions to fathom but don't be squeamish! Try everything!

One of the best foodies retreats in Calcutta right now. That is saying a lot considering Calcutta has no dearth of excellent food options.

The decor truly lives up to its name, if you have visited cafes in far flung tosh or kheerganga in the hills, you would find some similarity in the vibe. Only, it is not so spacious. That's too bad for a place like this.

The cocktails are glorious success stories of creative fusion. The gondhoraj martini is to die for, the Kolkata biryani,complete with biryani aloo is unique and delicious. There is a lovely tequila based drink with fruit jelly which tastes like childhood mixed with a happy high. The best I liked was this whiskey based drink with smoked pineapple, hard hitting and delicious.

We loved the phuchka combo, esp the one with prawn and crab. The bhetki  pickled starter is amazing. The bacon wrapped chicken served with rice is truly delicious. The Malpua cheesecake though, literally takes the cake.

This may sound odd, but check out the washroom! They have painted its walls with graffiti, worded it with iconic Bangla and English song lyrics. I never thought I would ever list a washroom as one of the talking points of a restaurant but it made me.

The waiters are smiling and courteous almost to a fault.

Bohemian lives up to its name, carefree, creative and rocking in a non self serving way. I hope you grow bigger and expand your property soon. A place like this deserves to be the best known in the city.

Taking Bengali cuisine to global consumers.. That’s how I would like to define Bohemian.. This place has been on my wishlist for eons and finally last month I got the chance to taste some of their contemporary fusion dishes.. Located conveniently close to Bondel Road in one of the alleys, easily spotted with google map.. The exotic array of never-before-heard dishes and the unique concoction of ingredients have made this place a cult amongst the foodies of the city.. Coming to the décor, we were seated in the upper floor which was operational during the daytime.. The place is not that big but the seatings are comfortable, the white marble tabletops add to the classy feel, the brick-walls, colorful papers hanging from the top, the elegant lanterns and the slow popular bengali numbers all added to the soothing and classy ambience.. Service was spot on, staffs were extremely courteous and knowledgeable about the dishes they serve and spot-on while recommending food to suit our palate.. They greeted us with cold towels and spicy watermelon cubes as it was a scorching afternoon.. Nice enough gesture and mark of hospitality.. Coming to the food we tasted:
Vodka Soaked Prawns: These was an absolute screemer.. One of the unique and most delicious prawn starters I have tasted ever.. Fresh Tiger Prawns in Skewers marinated in vodka and other exotic herbs.. Slightly creamy and sweetish in taste.. Passionately Recommended..
Steamed Bhetki with Pickled Chili and Cheese: A distant relative of our good old Bhetki Paturi but the marination was totally unique.. The fish was fresh and cooked to perfection and neither overpowered with the spices and paste.. Loved the tanginess and the heat from the chilies..
Panchphoron flavored Parshe Fillet with Smoked Green Chilli Sauce: We wanted Pabda Rolls but sadly weren’t available that day.. This was served with Lemon Rice and pickled cucumber.. Even the cucumber tasted so lip-smacking, speaks for the rest of the dish.. the parshe fillets were fried and curried in a greenish gravy with a strong taste of panchforon and coriander powder.. Light on palate and ideal for the summers..
Chicken stewed with Cucumber, Green Chillies and minced Cumin: Served with steam rice, this dish is again ideal for people looking for not-too-spicy and easy-on-the-tummy dishes.. Boneless chunks of chicken cooked in an yellowish gravy based on jeera or cumin.. Never knew the flavors of cucumber blends so beautifully with chicken.. This dish is definitely for the connoisseurs of taste..
Kancha Lanka Mangsho: Don’t go by the name as the dish we tasted here is completely different from the ones with the same name served in other joints.. Though the name suggests it to be extremely hot, but actually the dish tasted quite controlled and varied in flavors.. The meat was stirred well for long making it extremely tender.. You gotta taste it to get the feel..
Malpua Cheescake: If you feel you have already seen enough through the mains, wait for the deserts for the ultimate surprise and fun-ride.. Experimentation and innovation at its very best.. Slices of thinly fried malpua sandwiched within layers of cheesecake giving a serene feeling to your taste-buds.. Surprisingly the dish was not overly sweet as malpua would normally suggest and the presence of fennel seeds in malpua added to the flavors..
Overall, indeed a culinary experience to cherish for long.. Only issue that I felt was the up-market prices which is kinda justified for the expertise and the artistic delivery of this place but if you are serving such less portions even after charging so high, it becomes difficult to repeat the visit even though you wished dearly for the same.. Our total cheque was Rs. 3013/- (all incl.) for 3 people..

I have been a regular visitor of Bohemian from its very inception and i think this is  the first time kolkattans were introduced to good fusion food. 
The seating capacity is not Much and the decor is speak an span as it should be. But the food here is amazing and every true bengali food lover should like it if they have a knack of experimenting. 

As the restaurant is well over the five year mark I think it's high time they do a major overhaul in their menu. 

Listing down my best dishes which are must haves..

Joyous mutton chops
Bacon wrapped chicken in Aam kashundi reduction
Gandhoraaj sorbet 
Malpua cheese cake

I don't know if a non-Bong or a non-foodie would even appreciate the unique offerings that this place serve. 
Let's get one thing straight ... I am a proud Bong! And am a proud food-lover...
The place is a rather small but well decorated, & well lit place. And they play classic hits from New-age Bong songs, as well as classic rock! 
The cocktail menu is tweaked by small innovations which makes it more interesting as well as pleasant.
The food was amazing! 
The cuisine is a fusion between Continental and Bengali... and it clicked like charcoal and fire!
We did try a lot of them... and all of them were amazingly tasty! 
But what appeared to me as the greatest USP is that because it is a small place, so the service was so very warm, and personalized, it immediately felt like, we ought to come back to this place... just to enjoy the hospitality! And the food, too!
P.S. the bar stocks a pretty fine list of poison for scotch lovers. But do try out a cocktail at least!

Dear Zomato, you don't have enough stars that I can give to Bohemian. Innovative food bursting with flavour. Impeccable service by caring people. 
Unimaginable experience. The thing that fascinated us most is Chef's restraint with flavour and seasonings. Not one flavour or taste was out of place. I strongly recommend Chicken with nalen gur and Royal Bengal pate in appetizer. Murshidabadi chicken and pork with bagane mashla, chili and cheese in main. Mustard and tender coconut mousse in desert.

Location is easy, in old ballygunge, near patha bhaban school or near 6 ballygunge place restaurant .Tried their poila boisakh special menu, it was Prawns with cucmber and chillies. the more horrible the name, the more tasty it was along with a very very very friendly and helpful stuffs.  The environment,the decor,the service everything was great and just perfect.
I just want to add that the music can be converted from  rock to bengali, so that we can cherish the bengali feel more.

Excellent place to have Bengali fusion food, a one of a kind in Kolkata. Before visiting this place I never had the idea that Bengali food can also be served in a delectably different way.
I visited the restaurant a couple of times & each time I came back happy. Each item in the menu has a distinct taste of its own. Their presentation is very good. 
Only drawback is their service which is slow, But this can be overlooked because at the end of the wait we get to eat delicious food 😊
My recommendations:- Bhetki smoked with Cumin & Quartered Darjeeling chilli.
Bacon wrapped chicken with Aam kasundi reduction (this is out of the world).
Pork vindaloo.
Malpua cheesecake.

One advice: Try Barbecued Pomfret. It will be the best decision of your life. The ambience is good, the food is great. Service and everything was good. I would definitely recommend this place.

This was one of the first outlets to serve contemporary Bengali cuisine in Kolkata.I have tried their food a couple of times in the past and the experiences have been awesome.

However,this pertains about my most recent experience with them.

Ordered for Panchphoron flavoured Parshe fillets with Smoked Green Chilli Sauce served with Preserved Lemon Rice and minted Cucumber.

The rice was Basmati which was very well cooked though I didn't get any hint of lime,not that I mind since I'm not a fan of lime flavour when it comes to rice.There were 2 medium sized fillets of Parshe which was soft and came with a flavourfull green chilli sauce.However,there was a very subtle hint of chilli,wish it had a little bit more heat.Also,the amount of gravy should have been more compared to the amount of rice.The salad was sweet,cold and refreshing.Overall,pretty satisfactory and definitely recommended as they have a vast innovative range of items in the menu.

Special mention of their packaging which was neat.There was aspect which was really disappointed with was the fact that charged almost INR 50 for delivery through Zomato which they don't if ordered directly.

This place is a host to quite a number of innovative dishes. The dishes are mainly fusion with traditional Bengali dishes. The quality of food is awesome.  And the decor is a plus. 

I tasted Firangee Mutton along with the Chicken Keema Phuchka from the Phuchka Festival. The main dish Firangee Mutton was quite good, both in quality and quantity, but the Phuchka was a waste of money. It was just normal street phuchka, nothing special.

We had also ordered several other dishes, including mutton-based, fish-based and chicken-based dishes, but out of them, the mutton dishes were better. Fish was awful. Since the fishes were boneless, they seemed to be keema pieces instead of the whole fish.

Overall, this place can be a good visit if you accompany any non-Bengali friend for tasting Bengali food but not for regular visits.

Great bengali fusion food. Loved it.. non veg phuchka combo is just fatafati. There were hilsa, crab & prawn , mutton keema phuchka ... Just mindblowing. Chilli crab with kolmi shak & cheese is yummy. Bacon wrapped chicken served with dalia pilaf & mixed vegetables.. wow!! Overall good experience.. just place is too small..

Items that are not available should not be included in the home delivery menu option. After placing order, restaurant called, asking for an item change due to unavailability. Had to order as per restaurants choice & more expensive than original order. Requested for less chilly in all items, but got very chilly items, hence request was ignored. Overall experience was poor as the pricing did not justify the quality, quantity or service given by Bohemian.

Out of the world. Yes, this is the first time I experienced experimental Bengali cuisine, as exquisite as this. Starting from the starters to the main menu, everything had a continental/ innovative /spicy twist, beating any Abbas-Mustan thriller hands down! The menu might seem a bit overpriced vis-a- vis its quantity. But I will say its worth every penny, given the unique experience you get. 
Food: 5/5
Ambience: 4.5/5

Value​ for money: 5/5
The crabmeat starter with kolmi and cheese was outstanding, so were the mutton chops. The pabda main course with bori rice and fried vegetables was interesting. Pabda might remind you of sukto, somehow. They were offering something called non veg phuchkas. Would appreciate if someone can review those, please. Visiting again, soon.

The selections from Bohemian are hands down the best contemporary bengali dishes I have ever tasted. Exquisitely made with unusual and intriguing combinations of ingredients. As I tell everyone Chef Joymalya Banerjee is an artist and perfectionist! Also the staffs and waiters who work there, are very welcoming and warm. They even remember your favourite dish! I keep planning to visit Bohemian again and again.
Nothing but love for this beautiful little place.

As the name suggests, the restaurant is involved in matter of arts in food designing. The biggest festival of all times, “DURGA PUJO” demands to treat yourself with eternal delicacies. So why not begin with “BOHEMIAN“…. Before I could read the menu, I was pretty much sure what I am going to order and here it goes::
                                                                ...

1. Food - Expensive. Medium portion sizes, not very generous. However, extremely innovative and extremely tasty. If you have 2.5k ready to spend for an important date (drinks not included), this is your place to go. Chef Joy Banerjee must be applauded for food quality.
2. Ambience - If you can abide a moderate crowd, this place is all right. The ambience is trendy and new, although it could use some more simplicity.
3. Location - Situated at the heart of Ballygunge Place, this place is ideal for a more high-end crowd, those used to the above bracket range. An auto ride away from Jatin Das Park Metro Station. An auto ride away from Gariahat More.
4. Post-meal possibilities- If you are in the mood for sweets, Haldirams and Gupta Brothers are 10 minutes away on foot. If in the mood for shopping and/or movies, try Quest Mall, another auto ride away.
Bear in mind, however, that Quest is extremely expensive. If in the mood for cheaper shopping, try Gariahat. An auto ride from Gariahaat more can take you to Lake Mall Cinepolis.

Bohemian fulfills the promise of its name with the novelty of its menucard. But, for the most part, the innovations score higher on the show than on the taste. We ordered chicken wrapped , grilled chicken mushroom, smoked bhetki , cauliflower pudding and kolkata biryani cocktail. Only cauliflower pudding seemed reasonably well thought of.  Chicken wrapped is paste like and I don't think it can satisfy meat lovers who always prefer chunks. Kolkata biryani borrows saffron and potatoes from biryani, but otherwise the resemblance ends there. The place is small, but the waiters are friendly and very attentive. We were served 'amouse bouche' before dining and that felt pleasantly European.

The dishes are so mouthwatering that it's very hard to decide what to choose. The fusion of Bengali and continental food is just awesome. The food styling and presentation is just next level. As a foodie I would love to visit Bohemian again and again.

The ambience is totally rocking. The service is also prompt. The smoked bhetki and stir fry mutton (appetizers) is nice. The mushirdabadi barbecued chicken is also nice. The foiled bhetki is so so. The prawn with orange and coriander is also so so. The death by chocolate and malpua cheesecake both are nice. The mint julep is good. The mocha caramel shake is of standard taste. The sex on the beach is good to taste.

LOCATION:

Situated at Ballygunge Place, Kolkata. An easier description would be to continue straight from 6 Ballygunge Place on the that lane towards Ballygunge and you will spot it on the right side.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

After having been pestered by my wife for a while to visit the place, I finally got a chance last Friday evening. We were three of us and other options around the area had shut shop. So I decided to give it a go. Having seen wonderful reviews on Zomato, I was expecting a lot from the interiors but honestly to me it came across as a normal cafe sort of place. I liked the glass lights at the main door but the rest of it was quite common in today's day and age and maybe I was expecting something different and unique from the place. I think they could have done so much more with the interiors of the restaurant especially keeping in mind that its not exactly pocket friendly.

WINE & DINE:

We called for a Gondhoraj Lemon Martini, Pita with Coriander and Lime, Murshidabadi Barbequed Chicken and some spinach and cheese based main dish of which I forget the name.

The Martini was really good. Kudos to the bartender for having fused the flavors in such a nice way. I would liked a hit of lime to the martini but it was very subtle instead. However, nonetheless a very good cocktail.

The Pita was the best dish of the evening. It was soft and fluffy and the flavor balance was excellent.

The Murshidabadi Chicken was a disappointment. I did not find anything to do with Murshidabad or Barbeque in the dish. It did not have any smoke to it and was served in a typically continental cheese and herb sauce which lacked life. It came with a side of mustard potatoes and mustard pita which were actually better than the dish itself.

The Vegetarian main we ordered was really nice. It was robust, spicy and creamy at the same time. I actually added some of the gravy to the chicken dish and it tasted better. I would go back for the dish.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

The Chicken dish needs to be looked into. Also I think they can do much better with the interiors.

VERDICT:

Decent place. Honestly it was not bad. But I guess I was expecting too much.

Bohemian affords a unique food experience in the city.I've thoroughly enjoyed everything I've tried. The bhetki stir fried with cumin and chillies is exquisite and leaves one wanting more. The crab with kolmi greens has a similar effect. The pork ribs with kalo jeera and nolen gur is a very strong dish, although the meat was a little tough( and tasted more similar to lamb). Coming to mains,we were informed to our disappointment that kajoli was unavailable. We went for pabda rolls stuffed with cherry tomatoes; and the bacon wrapped chicken with aam kasundi sauce. In both dishes, the flavours of the sauce shone. The little mounds of rice and salad completed the dish. The chicken however felt quite dry despite the juicy bacon around it. Unfortunately,we were too full for dessert.
I'm looking forward to visiting again. Bohemian is very expensive though,especially in view of the rather meagre quantities. That would be the only small drawback of this place.

Heard a lot of this den, but never got an opportunity to make it out. Finally tried out this fusion hotspot last weekend with my parents. Its worth visiting this place, with creative decor, innovative ideas and courteous waiters! We tried out flavoured phuchkas for the first time! actually that was something that's new to their menu, so yet to get it inked on the card. but that's mind blowing! had six different puchkas, ranging from prawn phuchka to lamb...! well, the bar menu also sheds light of innovative cocktails that you can ever think of... had vodka based The Kolkata Biriyani, served with biriyani potatoes ! (heaven for a biriyani lover..) now the main course - 1. Bacon wrapped chicken with Aam Kashundi reduction, 2. Mutton with drumsticks stew with Gondhoraj leaves, 3. Sizzled Bhetki simmered with pickled garlic... All of them come with rice and some vegetables on the platter.. The quantity might not seem to be sufficient for someone like me with a big appetite! But definitely you gonna relish the dishes with utmost contentment.. Prices are expensive, but you wont mind paying once for an experience! A must go for someone who is tired of having Bengali dishes (that's for someone who is not a Bengali) and is willing to try out some real fusion dishes with a touch of Bong!

This was my third or fourth visit to Bohemian, but the last time was quite a long while ago. They now have a floor upstairs. A complaint I have with most restaurants is the way the seats are crammed which leaves little space between tables. It is understandably a luxury for restaurants operating out of small spaces but it would be nice to give a thought on how not to squeeze tables for 2 people between bigger groups. Two people on a Sunday lunch at an expensive restaurant are most likely looking for some special time together or catching up on conversation. Thankfully it wasn’t the case this time at Bohemian but it very well could have been given the layout. 

Recently whenever we eat out, we avoid ordering a main course meal. Instead we order a variety of starters to explore more tastes and feel less stuffed. We did the same at Bohemian. Out of curiosity we ordered the non-veg puchka platter that had 3 options. One with hilsa, one with prawns and I cannot immediately recall what the last one was. I liked the hilsa one least and the prawn one best. I am not sure how the hilsa was cooked (perhaps it was steamed) but it was not exactly to my liking and the water did not help it. Puchka is not really a big favourite so I may be biased here.

Next was the daab chingri dynamite. It is served on soup spoons with a slice of tender coconut topped with mustard chingri crumbs and some foam on top. The size is pretty deceptive and there is quite a big bite of chingri in there although it looks like a small dumpling. The taste works extremely well. Next was the Royal Bengal Liver Pate & Dried Mango on Crispy Toast. This was delightful. Liver can get a bit overpowering but this was subtle and was the best dish of the day for us. The mango wasn’t exactly dried but was a thin candied strip and I am not complaining. I will definitely order this again. Last was the chilli pickle n cheese baked crab with kolmi greens. I have had this before and I will have this again, every time I go to Bohemian. This is like the devilled crabs at Mocambo that I have to order whenever I am there.

We ordered desserts after this. A baked pantua alaska which I did not have but heard that it was delicious. I ordered the toffee roshogolla with green chilli sabayon. Eating the beautiful stuff that arrived on the table felt criminal. I do not prefer taking photos of my food but I probably should have made an exception for  this. There were 5 small rosogollas on the plate that were covered in solid caramel. Along with it was an airy, whipped mildly sweet sabayon (I had to look this up) that had generous bits of green chillies that set off the sugar coated rosogollas. There was also a small layer of white candyfloss shaped like a sail that made the whole thing look like a boat. The rosogollas did not drip syrup but once you bit into the hard shell, they were soft, spongy and moist.

What I love about the menu here is the evolution of the rich taste of bengali food into combinations that do not require the heavy plates of bhaat, polao or luchi that fill bellies too soon. Most other bengali restaurants still operate on those lines and frankly it becomes boring after a while. The price at Bohemian is on the higher side but it is worth paying that money once in a while for the effort and imagination behind the food that is served here.

This restaurant defines passion !!! The ambience,the food, everything here is created out of passion! The USP of this restaurant is that you can order anything and you will be surprised in a good way ! We went there on a winter afternoon for lunch and was served chef's special amouse-bouche , watermelon topped with some white and green dip which was very refreshing and a palate cleanser itself, then we ordered Stir fried mutton with mustard and coriander - chef's style followed by Murshidabadi Barbequed chicken with onion chutney and wine poached eggs , Chilli pickle and cheese baked crab with kolmi greens. Every bite of every dish was a surprise and make you crave for more !!!!! We stopped ourselves from ordering any further and ordered for the dessert , then came the Malpua Cheesecake !!! The coarse texture of the malpua and the soft cottage cheese with maybe some other cheese was a perfect combination ! A perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth after lunch.

P.S. : Thank you chef Joy Banerjee and team for a wonderful and memorable lunch. I really wanted to meet chef Joy Banerjee though :(

Heard about this restaurant from a friend so went there to try their bengali fusion food..  Was excited to try out this version. First we started with the appetizer ordered smoked bhetki as per the recommendation from the service guy but felt nothing special.. Then again as per his recommendation tried Prawn stewed with paanchforon, peanut and tamarind and it was so disgusting.. Then was so angry that we decided not to ask him anymore and ordered Chicken breast stuffed with kolmi green, shimmered with cheese and chilli pickle served with flattened rice pilaf.. It's taste was okay kind.

Then we ordered their signature cocktails New moon over kolkata and just bohemian served with spicy puffed rice.. After tasting them I outbursted they were so pathetic in taste. Never try their whatever cocktail they have.. Shocking !!

Really horrible experience with the food.. The taste was pathetic and the quantity was also not sufficient as per the price they are charging. As a foodie I'll never be there anymore and also suggest my friends and families not to go there. They are overpriced as per the taste and quantity. So a big thumbs down from my side. Pull up your socks guys.. :/

Highly overpriced, over hyped place. Most ordinary decoration in a 2BHK size place on the first floor. Food is just ok. We took Topshe fry, that is below our expectation, lots of oil, without anything special. Aam kasundi chicken is just ok, six thin pieces, weight max 120gm and just check the price!!
KANCHA LANKA MANGSO is surprisingly with-bone, tastes ok with plain rice max 100 gms. Will just remind you train food quantity.
A preparation of bhetki fish comes with Kolmi saak 25 gms....that's the speciality. Otherwise the main dish is most ordinary. Chicken barbeque was good, came with bread. Taste - continental.
Malpoa Cheesecake was good.
Their main course tastes most ordinary.....
Overall disappointing experience. Young people may need to eat more outside after giving them Rs 3500 for 3. They should declare there food portion by weight....it is so little!
Will never go again.

BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY – NOT A REALITY

On my recent visit to Kolkata, India I took time off and went to “Bohemian” (Asian fusion restaurant), located on Bondel Road, Ballygunge for dinner with my dear ones. My overall experience with the food was beyond priceless. The interior looks dull and the servers are average with great limitations in comprehending and articulating English.

 

Me and my friend ordered Lagavulin 16 years – a benchmark for Islay Malts with intense smoky flavor – a perfect blend with fusion food. Being expensive and a premiere alcohol, a glass of 30 ml costs about Rs 689 as stated in the menu.  However, I was served 60 ml which I only realized at the end while going through the bill. When I asked the server, the server aptly said that they serve “double” as a convention and then said that I ordered for “double” (2 contradictory versions from the server). I never asked for a double as the menu did not have such option but just said “1 Lagavulin” in plain English and my friend mentioned “ Lagavulin 30 ml”. Based on what was written at the bottom of the drinks menu, I expected only 30 ml. Being 11 pm at night, I did not get into any argument with the server but paid the full bill. 

Money does not pinch me but lack of ethics does and leads me to seek justification. 

Next morning, I wrote an email to the owner - CHEF JOY BANERJEE and vividly explained him the scenario. He called me up and promised me that he will investigate the matter and get back to me. He did not. He only emailed me on a later date following a reminder from my side once I got back to Canada. 

Joy appeared apologetic in his email and clarified that the amounts served were correct (and so is the bill). However, he DID NOT make much claim about the miscommunication with the server leading to double serving when not asked for. Thus, despite a fantastic dinner the overall experience did not end in a Bohemian Rhapsody.

I would recommend future visitors to make a note of the menu and be specific on what they order stating the portion size to avoid ambiguity. Otherwise, the bill will get unnecessarily doubled due to server’s assumption. 

I HAVE ATTACHED THE EMAILS BETWEEN ME AND CHEF JOY BANERJEE AND HAVE SETTLED THE ISSUE

 AS OF NOW. I PERSONALLY FEEL I SHOULD NOT HAVE PAID FOR THE EXTRA 30 ML BUT THAT IS HOW THESE GUYS ARE RUNNING THEIR FINE DINING RESTAURANT. SO, FRIENDS PLEASE BE WATCHFUL ON YOUR VISIT.

To start with, entering the restaurant itself is mesmerizing. The art on the walls of the entrance is beautiful and funky as well. It actually gives a feeling of Bohemia. The ambience is also amazing, again giving a feel of Bohemia. The staff is really polite and helpful. The food is awesome! We started with the puchkas, ordered the vodka soaked prawns in appetizers, foil baked bhetki, prawns stewed with panchphoron and kancha lanka mangsho and malpua cheesecake in dessert. The food, every dish, was amazing. There was a perfect balance of flavors in these unique fusion and delicious amalgamation of Bengali and Western cuisines. The presentation is beautiful, especially of the puchkas which came on top of the glass containing the water. We cherished every bite of the amazing food over there. 
To the Bohemian staff- keep it up!

Bohemian is like my personal benchmark for restaurants. the concept, the interiors.. everything is just perfect. and the food is on the top rung of the ladder. very dish seems to be prepared meticulously and with time. though a bit on the higher side, it's worth very penny. 
PS : I honestly cannot choose between  the desserts all are amazing

Absolutely lovely place. The ambience is lovely, the service is courteous. Place is meant for those who enjoy Bengali food with a twist. The food and drinks are all styled this way. We started off with phuchkas, and they were having a special day that day. The teeny-weeny soups were delicious. Yellow lentil soup with chicken is out of the world. Bhetki simmered with pickled garlic is so tasty, I'm pretty sure I was high after I finished it. Definite visit.

Well the name of the restaurant is befitting, this indeed is a place for gourmet food and when Bengali food gets the continental twist, it takes gastronomy to a new level.The epicurean clan will agree with me regarding the delectable taste of the unique dishes.Be it the Topshe fritters, the Bhetki or the Chicken, they have been done so differently that you would love to try more or less everything on the menu.The Death by Chocolate and Malpua Cheesecake are sinfully delicious! The Gondhoraj Sorbet serves as an excellent palate cleanser.The decor is boho chic, a concoction of the classic and the contemporary.Service is great.I feel that the prices are a bit on the higher side, but if you are planning to go on special occasions the food is worth giving a try.

Situated in a small and narrow lane dissecting from the main road innBallygunge, just a few metres away from the residential areas lies a homely bohemian styled restaurant which can be distinguished by the dark green roof cover it has on top. 
As they help you to the restaurant which is on the top floor, you can understand that this restaurant is going to serve you fusion of desi and videsi khana. So wasting no time, fresh beverages like Gondhoraj Julep, Mint Julep and Mint & Cucumber Refresher was served which I must say were a cool air in the hot afternoon in Kolkata. The Seafood Soup was also a success but the jackpot were the appetizers Mutton Liver Plate and Phuchka Non Vegeterian combo that had crab, hilsa and keema mixture. The Aam Kashundi Chicken would be the third favourite dish here though.
As we go down the main course, Bacon Wrapped Chicken, Chicken Red Leaves with Pickled Garlic, Kacha Lanka Mangsho, Prawn Tamarind and Murshidabadi Barbeque Chicken were an already mentioned fusion take on Bengali and European cuisine. The mango and tamatind sorbet were an average palate cleansers before the main course though.  
Come to desserts and my all time favourite was Gondhoraj Pie which had the perfect combination of sweet taste of a normal dessert and the essence of gondhoraj lebu (lemon) while Death By Chocolate would be second on my favourite list of desserts here, an unconventional take was also on the Malpua Cheesecake. 
Bohemian surprised and impressed my family and me with their new approach to food. All I hope is they continue to do so and make food maniacs all over the city go gaga over such crazy but amazing dishes. 
Cheers to the team!

Well. I came here with a lot of mixed reviews. Some said they loved it and some said they did not. So I decided to give it a shot. Let me tell you, I was blown away by the food, the drinks and almost everything that was here. Its a very homely place and the moment you step in you start feeling comfortable. The waiters are extremely helpful and cordial and they will give you the exact suggestions that your palette would like. Now the food. Absolutely brilliant. The cocktails are fabulous and extremely innovative. This has taken fusion to a different level. Can you imagine a Kolkata Biryani flavor cocktail. Awesome presentation as well. The food is beyond awesome. I could never think that mixing such contrasting things could make food so tasty. If you are adventurous with food, don't miss this place. The crab cocktail with cheese and kolmi shaak, the hilsa with orange and cinnamon and the pabda roll with mustard and cherry tomatoes were the highlights and definitely a must try.

One of the excellent restaurants in south Kolkata. The restaurant is superbly decorated and very vibrant and colourful.  I had aam kasundi soaked chicken escallops, roasted eggplant with mozzarella cheese phuchka with nolen gur water, sizzled bhetki simmered with pickled garlic, malpua cheesecake. Apart from the phuchka item, everything was delicious and of top quality. The serving time was fast enough, specially the appetizers.

They have a really cool spread which a fusion of bengali and western cuisine. The staff is pretty friendly and helpful. We tried two dishes a crab dish and one bacon wrapped chicken dish. I don't remember the names. They were both really good. Will definitely go back to try the main course.

Went to this highly appreciated eatery for a personal experience and was surely impressed !!
My husband and i were welcomed by a watermelon thing( dont quite remember what it was) in cube form with little hung curd and a green chutney on top.. 
Quite different i must say,.We started off with Gondhoraj Julep which was very soothing and relaxing and one of their signature cocktails roasted pineapple and cracked black pepper infused in whiskey.
For appetizer we had   roasted chicken in nolen gur and chillies. This was outstanding..!!
For our main course we had the kanchalonka mangsho ( very spicy but spot on taste)served with pita bread
And another chicken dish in some mustard sauce(average in taste) which came with rice and some greens !
Last but not the least we had cheesecake malpua
An excellent sweetdish to wrap up the lunch..
Pocket pinch is moderate..
Ambience and service is good!!
One thing that bothered us was the brand of spirits they use in their cocktails..

I'd heard a lot about Bohemian from friends and I was asked to visit the place when I was in Kolkata. I'm glad I heard and did just that. This place is amazing, especially the food.

I went along with friends and this is what we ordered: Aam kashundi soaked chicken escallops, Pork vindaloo; Anglo-Indian spices, Murshidabad barbeque chicken with onion chutney and wine poached eggs, Cigar and coffee mousse, and Pantua baked alaska. Awesome combinations of Bengali and Continental cuisines; not just in their names but also in their delicious flavors. To put it simply, the food/desserts are superb. It is definitely worth the price and your visit.

The service was pretty good, too and the staff polite. Ambiance is simple, dimly lit, and cozy with sufficient room. When in Kolkata, do visit this gem of a restaurant.

Sorry and you read it right - I rated it 3 out 5. And the score is combination of multiple parameters - food taste, quantity, price, ambience and staff.  If I have to only rate food, I will give it 5 out of 5. 

We 4 families and 1 friend had food here in Jan 2017. And the total bill was 28000. Here is what my review is -
Aam kasundi chicken - 5 / 5. Superb and very uncommon taste
Crab - 5/5. Excellent and best I have ever had
Boneless ilish - 5/5. I can imagine how much of effort has gone in to make it boneless
Mutton - 3.5 / 5. Ok type
Dessert (baby pantua with cake and icecream) - 5/5. Yummy 
Veg food is okish. Not extraordinary

Quantity - it is like prasad. One plate is not sufficient for 1 person. I am seriously disappointed here
Price - since the quantity per plate is less, they had to serve many plates so that each of us could eat at least a decent quantity of each item. And that is the key reason for that exorbitant bill
Staff - very polite, attentive and helpful. Perfect !
Ambience - well lit, nicely decorated

Overall, I would like to go back for the extraordinary food. At the same time, their price and quantity will make me a very occasional visitor, honestly !

We went to Bohemian for lunch and ordered a  bhetki, a chicken and a mutton dish. Each one of the dishes had a unique taste and were great. The ambience is alright as well. However given the price tag,  we felt the quantity of food is small. The dessert - tender coconut with mustard is super hyped for sure. Service time needs improvement too.
Overall, food quality- great
Taste of food- good and unique
Food quantity- small

Every time I  go to Bohemian, I discover something new. So this time around, I discovered that they have set up a fully functional bar, complete with all sorts of really quirky cocktails. The Kolkata Biryani cocktail deserves a special mention, because of its innovative presentation. Moving on to the food, what I like best about this restaurant is that the menu piques your interest and the plate which arrives  in front of you meets and even surpasses that high expectation. Unlike a lot of other restaurants in Kolkata  whose experiments with 'fusion' food leaves the tastebuds confused, Bohemian's experiments are genuinely successful. So I think it's quite value for money. I would recommend this place to anyone who's willing to try out genuinely unconventional dishes.

Fusion Restaurant is a very new concept for Kolkata. This restaurant even though not at all pocket friendly but must visit place for the foodies. When me and my best friend visited the place Fuchka Festival was on and we couldn’t effort to miss it.
Fuchka (Panipuri) stuffed with minced Mutton , hilsa, crab and prawn the best part was the water……Nalen Gurer Jol, tender coconut, lime water
Topse fitter with Kalojire and poppy seeds 6Pc . Nothing spectacular but sometime simple dishes  can amaze you 
Gondhoraj Sarbet : Tempted to mixed vodka
Amareal Custard with Crispy fried milk, 
Hilsa in cucumber and mustard sauce
The music and ambience was just perfect for the night. Service is also tick the right mark which is rare in Bengali restaurants.

Went there with a lot of expectations, but afraid to say was disappointed. Food was ok to good, but nothing out of the world. Had asked for server's recommendations, think he could have done a better job. Since we weren't very hungry we ordered the main course straight away. But it took over 25 min to come!

And lastly, I had expected some Bohemia decor, but it was nothing like it.

Had kosha mangsho, it had bad pieces. And what was even more disappointing was that they don't serve luchi! Luchi and kosha mangsho is the ultimate combination!

I have been to Bohemian a few times with my family. It definitely has good food, no doubt. However, I feel one must always go in a large group, to divide up the bill and so that one gets to taste a little from what everyone orders. This place spoils you with an exciting array of items and the food won't fail to impress you. The bill will tear you a new one though!

The Bohemian Trip

The food extravaganza that was served by Chef Jaymalya today at Bohemian was exquisite and extremely flavourful. To remove the confusion from our minds in terms of choosing from that vast menu, we requested The Boss to figure out what we should have.While he chose carefully to provide a complete coverage , we on our part were overwhelmed and did justice to his choice. 

Right from the watermelon-yoghurt-green chutney welcome skewer to the ending with desserts , there was never a dull moment. 

We started off with the seafood chowder that used coconut cream - the perfect start. The Topshe fish that followed was a hit - hint of nigella and poppy seeds in the batter and that undertone of coriander paste in the marination. The Grilled chicken with Darjeeling Chillies and Nolen Gur( Date palm jaggery) was a hit for some and a miss for others. The texture was really smooth and I personally kind of liked it. The popular Baked Crabs with Kolmi greens was unique in its own way. 

Before the mains, the Greenchili Green Mango palate cleanser demanded a repeat performance. The yoghurt based steamed prawns with Gandhoraj Lemon, the Mutton with okra, green mangoes & baby potatoes were fantastic. The hit was the Panchphoron Parshe(fish) with smoked green chillies - the sauce was just to die for. I loved the Chicken supremes with that mustard and preserved lemon sauce. The Pork with bagane masala and cheese was our last and by that time we were all overwhelmed.

I must mention the perfect accompaniment of rice flavoured with panchphoron that was clearly innovative and clever.

Two dessert items was on the offer for us - the tender coconut mousse and the Gandhoraj Lemon Pie. Both were the perfect ending to this experience.

The food here is the typical "twist in the tale" compared to the typical fare, but that's what makes the foodie life interesting. Thank you Joymalya.

Bohemian a Bengali fusion restaurant by chef Joy Banerjee is a treat for the taste buds. The restaurant is superbly decorated and very vibrant and colourful.
Welcomed with a complimentary amuse mousse ( small watermelon pieces with a Mayo and pudina sauce on the top) and we were suggested a gandharaj julep (a lemon and lime pudina coriander juice) to wet our throats.Followed by Basmati rice(fine steamed rice) Kancha lonka mangsho (mutton minced with green chillies) which was not extremely hot to act as dessert we asked for a nolen gurer ice cream. The place is absolutely not budget friendly.

Visiting Bohemian today was a lovely experience. Even though the location was not the best, yet you can reach it without much hassle, if you know the direction. The restaurant has a decent interior without too much decoration. Sounds funny the washroom has awesome decoration on its walls. We were 6 people together. I had aam kasundi soaked chicken escallops, roasted eggplant with mozzarella cheese phuchka with nolen gur water, sizzled bhetki simmered with pickled garlic, malpua cheesecake. Apart from the phuchka item, everything was delicious and of top quality. The serving time was fast enough, specially the appetizers. Foods are costly here, there is no point denying that. Still, this Indo fusion restaurant is worthy visiting once in a while. We billed a little more than 1K per head..

When I entered Bohemian and ordered the food I really didn't know what to expect. Since the genre of food I ordered was fusion, i was excited to find out what is in store for me. The service was reasonably good, good menu with a large selection of different varieties of food. And when the food was served i could tell from the looks of it that I will be way different from the stuff we try out in our conventional restos. The taste of all the dishes i tried were really awesome and hats off to the chef for the courage and creativity they had put for making those dishes. Will surely visit again to try out the other dishes. Keep up the good work

I always wanted to have lunch at this popular restaurant since a long time , thanks to a facebook group get together , i had the opportunity and boy!! what a different as well as absolutely yummy food i had..  the following was the menu especially curated by the chef and owner jaymalya bannerjee for us...

Mocktail(1 choice)-Tamarind refresher /
Bluu ( i had the bluu which was a lovely concoction of blue curacao, lemonade and fresh lime,it set the mood for me)
Starters: 
Baked Crab (it was so yummy that i licked the earthen pot in which it was served ,call me uncivilized but thats the way i am whrn i taste good food)
Paanch phoran chicken skewers (brilliant and v.v.light)
Choice of 1 Sorbet (Guava & rock salt /
Green mango & fragrant chilli) ( had the curiously named but smashing green mango and fragrant chilli sorbet, a must try)
Mains: 
Bhetki Rolls in pomegranate and Mustard( my favourite dish in main course , it was soft,succulent  and v.v easy on the stomach)
Mutton with Gondhoraj lebu ( excellent )
Rice 
Greens (who knew kolmi greens could be so tasty??)
Salads
Dessert Platter : 
Malpua Cheese Cake and Chilli Chocolate(chilli chocolate mousse was a little too experimental for me malpua cheesecake was just too good)
So if you are in for some traditional bengali food presented in a different,contemporary fashion this is the place for you!! V highly recommended!!

Visited this  place with a big group of cousins during one of my trips to Kolkata. It was recommended by a lot of people in Kolkata and on a sunny December afternoon, 10 people squeezed into 2 cabs to go from Salt Lake to Ballygunge. We ordered so much food and ate for at least 2 straight hours - the food here is that good. But whatever you do, keep room for some desert - because that at Bohemian is extraordinary. A must visit!

fusion food - all are named interestingly. It was my first time in the restaurant and I was melted with the taste of the foods. The daab chingri dynamite was outstanding and very uniquely cooked and served.  I ordered sizzled bhetki and murshidabadi chicken both were very tasty. They have shown a commendable delicacy in serving and cooking the food. Impressed. But I think quantity and portion can be increased a bit. Daab chingri makes my taste buds happy but not mind.

Bengali fusion food..yummy!! U can choose from the menu blindly & it would not disappoint! Tried a mushroom dish & steamed chicken for starters & my 5 yr old fussy eater was asking for seconds..that in itself is an achievement! We ordered the gondhoraj julep & mint julep both of which were refreshing..
Mains we ordered mutton, two types of chicken & a crabmeat platter..Awesome!! No other words..
Desserts was a chocolate one, a coconut one & their specialty malpoa!! They were all good but my personal favourite was the chocolate!! We couldn't hve enough! Delicious!
Only thing is that it is an expensive place & their portions are less for the prices charged! Starter portions are not enough to be shared & even though the main dishes have good portions of gravy meat etc, the accompaniments like rice are not enough to be shared.

Just had an unpleasant experience at this otherwise great food-paradise. Took parents for their first time experience of fusion Bengali cuisine. One particular staff failed to assist properly, misled us with offers and we were left with a feeling of being tricked. He was even rude and lied to escape consequences. Manager wasn't around as we waited for over 15 minutes for him/her to intervene and sort the issue. Even my debit card was taken to the kitchen for reasons unknown. Finally other staff members apologized on his behalf. We went in excited and left with bitter minds. A rare and hence all the more shocking experience at Bohemian.

This place is not as eye catchy outside as it is inside! But trust me , it's a whole new experience in Bengali cuisine . They quite beautifully amalgamated the Bengali & continental cuisine. The interiors are complete boho. Quite relaxing !! If you love crab , you must try their Chilli pickle and cheese baked crab . Bacon wrapped chicken tasted delicious! The beverage we commonly come across is lemon soda or lemon juice ! To add a twist to this taste try Gondhoraj julep (king of lime). If you are low on budget , no worries . Go for the Great bohemian brainstorming munch.

Very good food. An international twist to the quintessential bengali cuisine. Even the complimentary watermelon cubes served with piped dhania chutney was a delight. Every single dish was worth reordering again n again, but when you want to order everything on the menu you gotta wait, so thats what I am gonna do. The desserts were decent and not as great as the savoury items...but thats OK aslong as the rest makes you happy and full. Can't wait to go back again. Btw, we got a discount coupon too for our next visit( woo hoo 😆😊😆😊), the pic has been added to this post.


P.S.- The Pork sauted in Butter n Garlic should be put on the regular menu...i can truly have it for every meal for the rest of my life.

If you want to try good fusion Bengali food , then you should try Bohemian once . We ordered :
1.Vodka soaked prawn
2.Steamed vetki with cumin and darjeeling chili
3.Pomfret pickle lemon
4.Kacha lonka mangso
5.Mursidabadi barbeque chicken with pita bread
6.Pork vindalu
7. Malpoa cheese cake

You must try Mursidabadi barbeque chicken and kacha lonka mangso.

Take a kacha lonka mangso and it contains 4-5 pcs of mutton and order separately rice. As per my opinion it will be best if you are hungry .

Service is not too good , ambience is nice .

Overall the restaurant is little expensive , but the food is very good and you have to order strategically .

A place where continental meets Bengali will be the perfect definition of Bohemian. Though, we went during Puja, yet no compromise on food. Yes, the menu was reduced. Ambience great...Staffs..very cordial! Loved their way they served. May be because of the puja rush...the food arrived late

We were welcomed with a small portion of complimentary watermelon
The starter is with a mutton preparation, which was without any fault

The main course was served with Rice and salad

We had a Bhetki preparation along with

Bacon wrapped chicken with Aam Kashundi reduction

Having the food with Green mango and green chilli sorbet and Spiced tamarind and mint sorbet was simply refreshing

The Malpua cheesecake was another out of the world dessert to complete the meal. 

Keep it up guys! See u soon!

It is with great regret that I am changing my previous high rating of Bohemian. The last two times I have eaten here the food has been sub par and my stomach has been upset. 
That extra spark that their food had is gone and the chef and waiters seems hell bent on making you try their bizzare specials which rarely make the cut. Moreover, success seems to have gone to their heads and the level of service and customer appreciation has dropped drastically. 
There was once a time when This place would be on the top of my list but now I d think twice before heading here. 
Big let down!

One of the most interesting restaurants in the Kolkata dining scene today. Chef Joymalyo Banerjee is truly experimenting with Bengali cuisine, taking it to places it usually doesn't go. I had a chance to talk at length with him about his philosophy of choreographing the menu, and was impressed by his grounding in traditional Bengali cooking, coupled with his instinct for innovation. Loved the experience.

This time we came home for diwali and this restaurant has become the best discovered jewel in the heart of Kolkata for us.suggested by our friends(who are quite regular there) we went there in a group of 4 and the menu card was the first surprise for us. The names and combinations amazed us that they created magical fusion with typical bengali ingredients. We were welcomed with 3 piece of watermelon in a pick covered with white and green sauce. Then suggested by the waiter we took gondhoraj julep followed by steamed bhetki with pickled chili and cheese,both were magic. Then came our 4 wish dish-foil bhetki with baby turmeric teen photon and coriander jus, pabda rolls stewed in cherry tomato and spinach broth and some dish of ilish and chicken I don't remember and can't find now because it was a puja special menu card. Though extremely overpriced, each and every food item was mouth watering. We could see the presentation and fusion of our very own old spices and fish/chicken with continental cuisines which have always amazed the world.

While writing this review what I was thinking from where to start. I thought of being start with the location, decoration and all.. but wait. Let's start with, what actually draw my attention.

This restaurant is absolute genius. Chef is not a cook here, a true artist, okay this is not about the presentation of food only, the taste they have of each dish. Bengali food with fusion, man... How can be it so tastey???? :) So, let's start the journey.

Location: it's in bullygunje, near the 6 bullygunje place.

Decoration: only draw back is that, the restaurant is very small, otherwise the decoration is superb. Very eye catching and the Bengali music in the background, took me to my earlier days.


Okay........ Now the main segment, food.

Starter:
__________________
1. Fuchka combo: this combo has 3 type of fuchka, each 2 in count.
**Hilsa fuchka with mustard and tender coconut water: I never thought ilish Mach can go so good with fuchka , heavenly in taste. And the tender coconut water , superb.

**Crab and prawn fuchka with spiced nolen gur water: another owssumm. And the real gem was the nolen gur water.

**Keema garlic fuchka with honey lime water: another one, it was that much delicious and the honey lime water , superb, superb.

The fusion of fuchka is just superb. You can not afford to miss any.

2. Vodka soaked prawn : this one is another out of the world, prwan were very well cooked, juicy and soft.
Come in 6 pieces. I can have it all d day. Mind blowing.

3. Chili pickle and cheese baked crab meat with kolmi green : fusion at his best. You get the cheese crab continental flavour with kolmi shak. I never imagined that kind of fusion can ever happen and that so with that tastey. Superb. Terrific.

Main course:
__________________

1. Hilsa stwed with Coconut and cucumber: 1st of all we were in dilemma whether this fusion is good or not. As a Bengali we always want that in hilsa dish the taste of fish should be there. But after having this I can only say yes fusion can b so tastey. The hilsa was boneless. But it taste just amazing with coconut and cucumber.
They server it with rice and salad.

Not able to try and taste any other main course this time.

Dessert:
______________

1. Death by chocolate: any choclate lover can afford to miss this. Pure choclate ball. But it taste on sweeter side.

2. Malpoya cheesecake: superb amazing. Another fusion and aptly done. U will get both the cheesecake and malpoya taste. And that was too perfection.

Beverages:
_________________

1. Gandharaj julep : superb in taste and that refreshing. Just amazing.

2. Tender coconut refresh: amazing one. I just loved that. But this is similar like dab sarbat of paramount with higher cost.

The best fusion in town without a doubt. Quality and taste is just per excellent.
Special mention:the serving person. Forgot to ask his name. But he is just amazing. With a lovely smile he generously giving us all the details of food and his recommendation was superb.

That main set back :
_______________________
this is one of d best place I ever gone. But trust me it was too costly. Amount is very less competitively.
Two person cost us : 3500 INR.

But yes there is no doubt about the quality, taste and service. Will visit again. Want to taste your all items.

0.5 less in rating because it is really overpriced. Otherwise it a treat to be there :)

Each time I've been here, each bite I've had, has always left me amazed in the most fulfilling way.

It's funny how you reminisce those Sunday afternoons from your childhood, when Mom would cook those Grand lunches. Bohemian brings back all those familiar tastes but sprinkled with a continental fusion. Definitely adding an awry and unconventional touch to most routine Bengali dishes.

I've tried most items of their menu. Bacon wrapped chicken, Flash grilled Bhetki, Malpua Cheesecake are absolute favorites.

The chef can blend the flavours of East n West with ease! Some of the food might sound a little weird but try them and u will be surprised! The bacon wrapped tilapia for instance..... who can imagine that u can uplift such a humble fish into such exquisite flavour? And if u want something more close to ur heart try the kacha lanka mangsho. I love the fact that they come with flavoured rice.... my favorite the coriander flavoured rice... a very very clever inclusion of "shaak" in some of their dishes is awesome. And if u want to die eating then try their death by chocolate! I'll save .5 in my rating for a slightly overpriced menu. BUT! Personally I don't mind paying that price for such unique food. LOVE!

Everything about this place is awesome. The welcome you get, the interiors and the staff. The food here is mind boggling as it's pure bong fusion food . The menu is widespread and you've got a lot to choose from yet it isn't confusing or difficult to sort.
Anything you order will surprise you and you'll enjoy every bit of your plate. Chefs wonder creation. Chef Joy brings you the ultimate Bengali joy food in the city of joy. Enough said now. Go visit this place.

Bohemian has been one of my favorites for the last 4 years. But this recent visit was my first when it changed it's entire menu.
This recent visit during the festive season allowed me to indulge in their special menu card. I started of with a plate of Vodka soaked prawns along with Spiced rum infused pork, and the results were just outstanding. It was simply delicious. The fusion taste along with the other spice elements really helped me to savour the moment before I ordered for the main course. My main course consisted of Flash Grilled Bhetki simmered in Radhuni. This was too good, firstly coz I love fish secondly, it's presentation. Along with that a Mint julep, and my day was complete. Thank you for making my dinner a great one. Kudos to the entire Management of Bohemian.

This place is absolutely stunning when it comes to the signature dishes that they prepare whether it's Hilsa, Bhetki, Crab, Prawn or Mutton. Even the small list of beverages that they serve is taste-worthy.
In today's economy I would say it's pocket friendly as well. I was there with my family and they loved it to the core. Even we had food packed and the packaging took my heart away. Keep up the great job guys!!!
When it comes to Bohemian, I would say that, " They excel in the Art Of Gourmet"

Bohemian, the brain child of chef Joy Banerjee is one of the centres of fusion Bengali cuisine in Calcutta. It has been quite a few times that I have visited this restaurant and every other time i have fallen in love with  this place over and over again.
We had Daab Chingri Dynamites, Aam kasundi soaked chicken escallops, Prawns with panchphoron, mutton stir fried with browned onions and sliced chillies and chicken breast served with kolmi greens. The food was unusual and undoubtedly fabulous.
For drinks we had gondhoraj julep and mint julep. 
Overall, this place is highly recommended. People should come here to try unusual Bengali food combinations. This place is surely, one of its kind.

This was my fourth time to Bohemian - my most favourite restaurant in Kolkata. I love, love, love the food there! The cuisine is Bengali fusion. Ingredients and spices commonly used in a Bengali kitchen are used to serve absolutely delectable dishes with an exotic twist. Sorry if this sounds hyperbolic, but I have been there just two days ago and simply can't stop raving about it.

We were a party of four and it was raining heavily when we reached. It was 11:30 AM and since the restaurant opens an hour later, one of us went in and asked if they could accommodate us early. They not only agreed readily but sent over an attendant with an umbrella so that we don't get drenched in the rain.

The decor was warm and inviting with pretty ceiling lamp shades of different colours and a glass water wall on one side. They had a Durga Puja Special Menu and like every other time, we were spoilt for choice. Once we had settled down, we were served watermelon amuse bouche, cubes of watermelon with a drizzle of sour cream. This left us with a refreshing aftertaste. Once we were done with the palate cleansers, all of us ordered Gandhoraj Julep.

Gandhoraj Julep is a refreshing lemon mocktail that uses kafir lime. On all my visits to Bohemian, I have ordered this drink, and it's my favourite! The taste is very refreshing yet not overwhelming with the coriander leaves adding just the right amount of zing to it. 

For appetizers, we chose Spiced Rum infused Pork with Orange and Honey & Stir fried Rosogolla with Oranges, Coriander and Sliced Chilli. The pork was succulent with the sweetness of orange and honey toning down the hot, zesty flavour of chilli. The stir fried rosogollas melted in the mouth, leaving a lingering mild, sweet taste. The contrasting flavours of chilli and rosogolla balanced each other out, with neither overpowering the other. 

Everything on the menu was available, which was a pleasant surprise, as during Pujas and even otherwise, most restaurants fail to offer every dish that's there on the menu. The staff was very friendly and polite and offered helpful suggestions for the choices.For main course, we ordered Flash grilled Bhetki simmered in Radhuni, Crab with Mango Pickle, Butter and Thickened Milk, Bacon Wrapped Chicken in Aam Kasundi Reduction & Sliced Pork and Baby Turmeric In Banana Leaf Envelope. Going with the staff's suggestion, we also shared a plate of Hilsa stewed with cucumber and coconut. 

Each dish was served with steamed rice and salad. The meat was succulent, and the gravies flavourful with a pleasant lingering aftertaste. I can go on and on about each dish but I don't think words will be able to do justice to how innovative and delish the dishes were!

Dessert was just another phase of foodgasms! Custard Apple and Green Cardamom Mousse, Fresh Oranges and Rosogolla Souffle, Darjeeling Tea and Goldflake Panna Cotta and Gondhoraj Lemon Pie - innovations that will delight anybody with a sweet tooth! The panna cotta had a subtle smoky flavour complementing the rich flavour of Darjeeling tea. The lemon pie had a rich buttery taste and will be an instant hit with anyone, who likes their dessert with a hint of sour.

If you love fusion food, this should top your list!

Bohemian by chef Joy Banerjee is one of the pioneers of fusion Bangla cuisine in Calcutta. I have visited several times and I can assure that anything you try from their menu would be superb, so not mentioning any dish in particular. However, do take help from the servers if you are confused, they are very helpful. Don't miss dessert and reach with a roaring appetite! Pocket pinch would be in the higher side.

I visited The Bohemian with my Mom on October 1, 2016. Thanks to my absent mindedness, I had forgotten that their closing time was 3:30 pm for the afternoon shift, and reached the place at nearly 4 pm. I hadn't even made a reservation. However, when I explained my situation, they were quick to welcome us with a warm smile. What a pleasant surprise!

Of course, the food was heavenly, as usual. We had baby potatoes cooked in Panchphoron oil as appetizer, followed by Pabda rolls stewed in cherry tomatoes and spinach broth for Mom and Chicken stewed with cucumber, green chillies and minced cumin for me. And what better way to wash them down than with a couple glasses of Gandharaj julep? 

Thank you, Bohemian, for the absolutely delightful experience. We'll be back!

Bohemian by Chef Joy Banerjee is the centre for fusion food in Kolkata. Located near Birla Mandir toward Bondel Road, this restaurant is one of the most innovative eateries in Kolkata.

The decoration is quite quirky and colourful and completely to my liking!

I made my way to this place to try their Brainstorming Munch. The à la carte menu is just too expensive for me as a student :P Hence this was an economical option with great dishes in store.

I tried the following :

Bluu - This is essentially the Blue Lagoon that one normally gets at most places that serve mocktails. I enjoyed it quite a bit and it was thoroughly refreshing!

Crab Cakes - This was a dish comprising of two small pieces of crab cake with a relatively huge amount of dipping sauce. The crab was absolutely delicious! Small but amazing!

Mango And Chilli Sorbet - This was an absolute cracker! I loved the hint of chilli with the mango! It was a perfect sorbet which I wished lasted forever!

Bhetki Rolls in Pomegranate based Sauce - Now this was an innovative dish served with rice and two vegetables. The veggies were pretty good. The sauce was also amazing! I loved the fish too. However I felt the fish by itself lacked flavour! Don't get me wrong, I could definitely taste the pomegranate and stuff but what I really missed was the fishy taste that one expects from any fish! Nonetheless it was brilliant.

Dessert - This was perhaps the least impressive. Crème caramel was not appetising and the pineapple cheesecake was just okay. Definitely not at the same level as the other dishes!

The staff were courteous and the service was quite prompt. No complaints in that regard!

As a whole I had an amazing lunch which is all one needs! Definitely recommend this place to all who don't shy away from new flavours and can shed some money once in a while!

Rating-

Food: 2.1/2.5

Présentation: 0.5/0.5

Ambience: 0.5/0.5

Staff Behaviour: 0.5/0.5

Other Intangibles (based on my personal experience as a whole): 0.9/1

Total: 4.5!

Happy Dining!!

It was in my wishlist since I started using zomato! Excellently creative recipes with perfect presentation. For drinks we ordered tamarind refresher and bluu. Tamarind refresher is really amazing. For starters we ordered pork in banana leaf and royal bengal meat loaf. It is so difficult to say which one was better. Both are well cooked , have subtle flavour. In mains we have bhetki rolls in pomegranate and mustard and mutton with gondhoraj and coconut milk. Both the items are served with rice, kolmi saag (don't know the english name) and potato salad in mustard dressing. I loved the mutton. Still drooling over it. Fish is very soft and tasty. the flavour of fish is bit unusual . It is a mustard base preparation but sweet in taste. Last but not the least pista flavoured custard and pineapple cheesecake are served as dessert.  Very friendly staff. Food is amazing but the decor can be better. Although that aromatic oil lamp is very soothing.  I think they too believe in the fact that food is therapeutic .

By the lanes of Ballygunge, one comes across this small and humble place that is renowned to have hit the right chemistry between italian and bengali food! To get you started watermelons on stick, topped with a sauce of chillies strategically placed on a woodden bar is placed infront of each person. I exactly cnt recall the menu names. For entree Smoked Bekti was ordered which we savoured to every bit. Palate cleansers included Gondhoraj Sorbet and Guava with rock salt sorbet. Main course spanned over three dishes, Murshidabadi Chicken , Chicken pickled garlic and Foil baked bekti in mustard and to end it on a sweet note Pantua Baked Alaska was ordered. Well to summarise what I experienced I would say, each dish was prepared and served with great detailing, it was a work of art. Surely Chef Jaymalya Banerjee had designed the dishes with lot of care and his expertise is evident on the plate!

Have had food at Bohemian several times before. Have never been disappointed. The staff, the decor, the ambience, the music and the toilet are all nice. However, the reason for visiting every time is solely the food. This review is for today's visit which was the first time we had the Rs. 449+taxes Great Bohemian Brainstorming munch. The food was excellent overall. The watermelon amuse-bouche which is not mentioned in the menu but was still served, is a nice addition. As for the beverages, the staff could perhaps ask whether the Tamarind Refresher  should be made normally or with slightly less chilis. It was excellent. A lot like phuchkar jol. The Bluu was also not extremely synthetic and very refreshing. Moving on to the appetisers, the Garlic Keema Wrap was very good. The quality of the skin of the wrap was excellent as was the filling inside and the sauce served along with it. The Pork in Banana Lead pales a bit in comparison to the Garlic Keema Wrap but it's not everyday that one gets to have pork paste in mustard! It was also good. The Guava & Rock Salt sorbet is excellent. The Green Mango & Fragrant Chili sorbet is not as strong as the Guava & Rock Salt sorbet (or the Gondhoraj sorbej which was not a part of this Rs. 449 menu). Though a sorbet is supposed to act as a palate cleanser, maybe it could have been a bit stronger. As for the main course, the Bhetki Rolls with Pomegranate and Mustard was unique and excellent, as was the Chicken and Potato simmered in Radhuni though the potatoes in the chicken dish weren't adding extraordinary value to it. The baby corn, carrots and beans in the chicken dish were adding a lot of texture and variety of taste though and were great to taste. Basmati rice, kolmir shaak and kashundi potatoes are served with both dishes. The staff is very helpful with these sides. The kolmir shaak is excellent. The texture of the boris inside the kolmir shaak is also very good. The kashundi potatoes are great. Moving on to the desserts, we were served pineapple mousse and caramel custard, both with cream. Both were good to taste. The cream was very fresh. The pineapple mousse was good to eat but is unlike mousse. Maybe it should be called by an other name, as the name mousse is slightly misleading for the dish. The caramel custard was more like caramel pudding. The toothpicks that are served at the end are accompanied by chocolates. The food and experience was excellent. That is the reason we keep returning to Bohemian, one of our favourite restaurants in Kolkata. No wonder we have written such a gushing review!

Went to Bohemian after many years. Tried this restaurant at its early days. Was impressed by the innovation but found it a bit expensive in comparison to portions served. 
But this time round I was elated to see more changes in the menu and found the portions to be in line with the charges, of course not to speak of the taste n quality. Tried 3 times overall in the last visit and each one was outstanding in its own merit. 
Starter : Smoked Chicken & Spinach Money Bags with Honey Lemon Dip. Very innovative and extremely tasty. 
Main Course : Prawn steamed with Yoghurt & Gondhoraj. Just the right blend for the taste buds
Dessert: Malpua Cheesecake. A perfect ending to the meal. 
They have also started " The Great Bohemian Brainstorming Munch " whose menu card I have uploaded.

There are times you get bored of regular items and wanna try something innovative..then This is The Place..everything is new concept and fusion. Cheese baked crab with chilli pickle and daab chingri dynamites are the must try items. In desert Baked Alaska will steal your heart and special mention to malpua cheesecake. Every food item comes with surprises when you are trying it especially here for the first time. Hats off to their Chef :)

If ur trying for something out of d box.. Den dis is d place... We tried the bacon wrapped chicken, sizzled bhetki simmered with pickled garlic , malpoa cheesecake and gondhoraj julep.. D food was good but d quantity of rice was way too less to satiate a typical foodie's hunger.. The interiors were really nice.. A special mention should be made about d washroom.. Do visit it guys..!! A bit on d costlier side, but its definitely worth a visit..

Was in the queue since a bit, so today when finally dropped in to try their brainstorming munch , wasn't really disappointed :)
Decor - quirky & unorthodox. With one side lined up with Beatles & few Jim Morrison posters & another with a scenic spot, perfectly sums up to the theme of this recent hotspot in town ! Undoubtedly, Fusion . The place was immaculately spotless . 

Service - Quick & courteous . No complaints . 

Food - we had ordered Tamarind Refresher & Bluu each. The tamarind one was synonymous with the phuchka water & was quite delectable. The Bluu was I feel the blue curaçao syrup (Ofcrs nonalcoholic) with Sprite/7Up. Refreshing & Soothing. Next came the starters - pork in Banana leaf which was a blend of our very own mustard paste with minced pork & Chicken and mustard money bags served with a sweet honey syrup. Innovative & suits the palate. Among the sorbets I preferred the mango & green chili blend. One of the best sorbet flavors I have had in recent times. The main course compromised of Chicken & Potato with Radhuni based gravy which was okayish. Nothing great. The other one was Mutton with Gondhoraj & Coconut gravy which took away the brownie points :) . Being a lime-addict, the very similar Kafir lime flavor was refreshing enough to blend with the tender pieces of mutton. The dessert of the day had caramel custard & pineapple cheesecake in a tiny glass, for which I am deducting their points. The custard wasn't fresh enough I felt and just by adding a few biscuit crumbs with some fresh cream & pineapple and coconut paste doesn't really sum up for a cheesecake ! Expected something better. Maybe next time we will order from their ala carté desserts. 

Overall, good experience as we tried something different. Kudos for challenging the hardcore Bengali cuisine to some fusion beats!! Just one suggestion - me being a girl with not much of an appetite was quite full by the completion of the meal but the portion sizes for an adult male seemed a little less for the dishes in your set menu .

Pocket pinch - 1102/- for two inclusive of all taxes. Would definitely come back for their ala carté.

The new menu doesn't seem to be working for Bohemian
We tried the set menu
The chicken panchphoran was tasteless
The potatoes in mustard were ok
The ceylon crab turned out to be a ceylon chicken which was coz of a mix up in the kitchen
The mutton was more more fat and less meat
The caramel custard as well as some pineapple desert were both inedible 
We came away regretting going there.

This place has been on my wishlist ever since it had opened. My mother and I got the opportunity when we had some work in Ballygunj and so wanted to have lunch there. The first thing that appeals to you when you enter this place is their minimalistic decor ..simple, elegant. The pictures of Beatles and Queens clipped to the rope tied to the hook on the walls immediately catches your attention. Now coming to the food. We ordered for the brainstorming munch. We had chicken skewers, bhetki patties, panchphoron chicken for appetisers. Then bhetki rolls, mutton in coconut and gondhoraj curry for the main course which was served with hot steamed rice. Then came the dessert of the day,but I had heard so much about their malpua cheesecake that I decided to order it after the course. The food was out of the world. The portions were small but that gets compensated by the quality. We were too full otherwise I would have ordered for these cheese bacon wraps and chetal steak. Never mind I  going back to this place to have these and would recommend this place to everyone who enjoys a little different yet common cuisine. Just had an awesome experience!!!

Bohemian, by Chef Joy Banerjee, from its very inception, has given the city an exquisite selection of fusion Bengali cuisine. Recently I went there to try out their set meal, which they interestingly called the Great Bohemian Brainstorming Munch. With an Appetizer, Beverage, Palate Cleanser, Main Course and Desserts priced at just Rs. 449/- plus taxes, this was surely a steal. And with around a dozen choices for appetizers and ten options for main course, me and my friend felt literally spoilt for choices.

The decor is catchy, people who welcome the guests and also people who work were very warm in their approach. Commendable.
But having said that, I have had a mixed experience the only time I visited the place. 
The dishes that we ordered were Pabda rolls stewed with cherry., Pork Vindaloo and Kancha Lonka Mangsho- a mutton dish. 
Pork Vindaloo was ok I would say nothing exceptional. Pabda dish was extremely bland I don't know I didn't like it at all, I was there with a few of my friends and no body liked it. That was a complete misfire. Kancha Lanka Mangsho was excellent. The only dish that was praiseworthy .Apart from this we also had Gondhoraj julep I am extremely disappointed with this one, the portion of coriander leaves was so thick and heavy that actually killed the smell of  "Gondhoraj Lebu "the real ingredient.
I would try to give one more shot at it , if only I find it better this time then only I would recommend it. Price is little bit on the higher side.

One word. AMAZING!!!

Just try out this place for the sake of experiencing awesome food. Dishes never heard of with delicious taste. As the name suggests - something unconventional, and rightly so.

I heard that the chef is a renowned chef in the area here and the food justified that hype.  Having lived in Kolkata for more than 2 years and exploring all sorts of restaurant and pubs, this place ranks among the best, if not the best. 

It's a very famous restaurant on Kolkata and rightly so.
 A family restaurant with beautiful, funky ambiance, nice and welcoming staff  and most importantly, mouth-watering food. The chicken and fish dishes are something to taste. Simply wonderful.

This place is an expensive one but one could always go and trying something new. Definitely, it has something new and different to offer then rest of the conventional restaurants in the city. 

Treating your taste buds for the love of food, i guess, could be there motto.

One visit is highly recommended.

The place is nicely decorated.. In a single word, the place is classy.. behavior of the staffs was really good.. they are so much helpful to choose your food according to ur taste.. everything is so nice.. :-) but the food(the main thing of a restaurant) was not upto the mark.. the 'baked crab' was really nice.. 'daab chingri' was so so... starters was overall ok.. but main course was horrible.. everything was too much creamy... rich in cream actually.. even the 'kachalonka mangho' was also creamy.. hate that taste... after that, the dessert... yaakk.. the 'malpua cheesecake' was like a bread soaked in milk.. it was totally flop.. and everything was very less in quantity...

I had a wonderful time in Bohemian. The place is small but they know how to make justified use of low-cost materials. The ambiance is enriched with beautiful collages, and wall paints. Now, comes the food!

The food was extremely delicious, I am still endowed with the mouth-watering flavor.

We ordered in appetizers:

1. Chilli pickle and cheese backed crab with kolmi greens.

In main dish:

1. Bacon wrapped chicken with aam kasundi reduction,

2. Murshidabadi barbecued chicken with onion chatney (with wine poached egg)

3. Chicken breast stuffed with kolmi greens, simmered with cheese and green chilli chicken.

The amount apparently seemed to be less but as soon as we completed each item licking fingers, we were too saturated to attempt for the dessert. But I promise to visit them again and try some other items and of course their signature dessert item Malpua cheese cake.

The place is a bit expensive, but every item they served worth the cost.

After a lot of ifs and buts, finally visited Bohemian. There was always a doubt about how such typical fusions would work with bengali cuisine. But the doubt was very well answered by the chef.
Started off with Prawn Dynamites and Cumin smoked bhetki. Both the plates had bite size portions and tasted very nice. Along with them we had Gondho raj sorbet which had a nice tangy & spicy taste , went well with the food. For main course we ordered a bhetki fish item, chicken with kolmi greens and sweet & sour pork dish. All the dishes were served along with rice & veggies. The chicken with kolmi truly was the standout, with its creamy sauce. But in no way can I say that pork and bhetki disappointed us, coz they were also good and had a very different kind of flavour.
And like all good meals should end on the sweet note, we had the Death by chocolate for dessert. It truly fulfilled it's name and was to die for. An awesome combination of rum infused dark chocolate icecream with choclate cake stuffed in it. Yummmmmmy!!!
I can say it was a great food journey, but one thing for which I could not rate it 5 was the price. It was quite a bit expensive but definitely deserves one visit for a true foody.

Bohemian is one of the best eateries in Kolkata. Though it has opened a couple of years back, it has been able to maintain its standard. Went back to Bohemian for a family dinner after two years and it did'nt let us down. Firstly, I am glad that the restarant has increased its seating area as the original space was too small. Secondly, the servers were very curteous and helpful. Coming to the food, we ordered 3 starters, a fish, a mushroom one and the famous chilli baked crab. The presentation of the fish was excellent and all the flavours were bang on. For the main dish we ordered the bacon wrapped chicken, murshidabad chicken, kachalonka mangsho and yogurt and lime prawn curry. All the dishes were excellent and but and the light yet flavourful prawn is an excellent choice fr the summer months. Dessert was the aaramel with mango, it was okay. Overall, a great dining experiance, a must go for those who love their bengali food but looking for an interesting twist!

With the changing food culture of kolkata,we wanted to try this place out especially because of the hoopla around it. Little did we know that we were in for a roller-coaster of a ride with the flavours that bohemian is renowned for. We opted for the set platter(The brainstorming munch) with a variety of options to choose from.We ordered panchphoron chicken skewers,chicken and mustard money bag,prawn and cheese wraps for the appetizers. For the main course it was mutton with gondhoraj and coconut milk,spicy pork curry,crab ceylon curry(all served with rice) and the dessert of the day was caramel custard and strawberry mousse .The palate cleanser served with tamarind refresher had set the mood just right to begin with. Still can't wear the smile off . Grab the munch when it is still on.

So this is a place I call Wow!. even before you place your order the menu and food writing gets you literally salivating.  The food certainly Lives up to the expectation. Bursts with flavors and a perfect burst it is.  Problem with fusion food is that most people go overboard with it.  But not with Bohemian.. It not only creates amazing fusion but actually makes you forget that you are eating fusion food. We ordered tamarind drink,  chilli pallet cleaners,  murshidabad chicken,  pork banana leaf,  crab Ceylon curry.. Honestly.. Nothing was disappointing.. Great job guys!!!

We had gone to bohemian last night and well the experience was good but it had quite some flaws. First of all the decor is nice and simple and quite attractive with the bright yellow walls and the bamboo poles stringed with small posters of different musicians and bands. Coming to the food we had cheese baled crab which was simply delicious and out of the world. I would have like a little more of it, but given how thick it was , it had used quite a good amount of crab meat. We also had the meat loaf and pork in banana leaf , well the pork was quite good, but nothing to remember ,but the eat loaf was really bad. One shouldn't even give it a try
. Onto the main course , we had gondhoraj mutton, which had good gravy but one had a very soft piece of mutton while the other was a little stiff. The other things we had ordered was the bacon wrapped chicken and prawn with panchforon&tamarind. The bacon wrapped chicken had a simply fantastic gravy, but the bacon wrapped chicken in itself was good, the prawn in itself was very good, but the gravy we felt was beyond doubt really bad especially with the excess of panch gorom hitting our taste buds. The bill was quite on the higher side , but the quantity could have been a little more. We left with enough space in our tummy to eat again at 11pm,half an hour after we left.we also had got the desert of the day which was so good that I wished we had more of it. We also had the malpua cheese cake which I felt had a little more of star anise and not so cheesecake like.Could have got that better.

The first impression of the people along with me, "Are you serious, this crap place is going to serve one of the best food in town?" And my answer to them was I hope so...

Locating this place for the fist times is a challenge, the Ballygunj road and go towards bondel road and you will get a small kali temple turn lef and you will see this place on your right hand side. 

On the menu we started off with Chiili pickle with cheese baked crab. I have not had anything like this before and the first taste simply blows you out simply terrific. Joyous mutton chops was unique and we were having the Gondhoraj shorbat along with it which was blended to perfection. Bacon wrapped chicken and after having this you will say what an idea sirji...this was too good. 

Kancha lonka mangho was yummy, soft and tender pieces of mutton with green chilli served with rice. Heaven for mutton lovers. 

To end Malpua cheese cake and truly death by chocolate.

Superb experience but a slightly high in terms of the prices and a must try for all food lovers.

My mom used to say that cooking is not merely about the ingredients one uses. First and foremost, one must love cooking. I remembered these words when I dined at Bohemian last evening. I was with two of my friends and we really enjoyed the food. We chose the set platter. It is priced at Rs.449- and is reasonable for what they offer, but is available only from Mondays to Thursdays. I am vegetarian and my friends non vegetarian, but both types were cooked with equal finesse. The spices used were simple and yet there was uniqueness in the way they were blended. I couldn't have dreamt of a mushroom dish cooked in radhuni. What floored me was the care with which each item was cooked and served. The tamarind cooler and the dessert were amazing. The staff is sweet and yet professional. All in all a lovely experience. Will definitely go back.

This is one restaurant I am proud of. proud that it is in Kolkata. Proud that the chef has thought of so many unique veg dishes that will fill your stomach but not your heart. You would want to eat all the options this place has to offer. I have been here innumerable number of times just to tate that one dish I had missed out on. Appetisers Baby potatoes, grilled cheesy mushrooms in aam kasundi are so buttery yummy melt in the mouth , that you might regret why you ate so quickly!!
For maincourse the spinach rolls in Radhuni curry sauce should be anyones first choice. The spicy Coriander Daliya pilaf is just amazing and a welcome change from rices and garlic breads!! The chilli Eggplant is fiery level spicy but the combination with peanut and tamarind will not let you stop at first bite. The pita breads they offer is so weird and brilliant in taste that you might want to order one of each.
Gondhoraj julep and cucumber and mint refresher are the drinks that is refreshing after all these spicy bites.
Desserts!!This guy knows his desserts! Cigar and coffee mousse is my personal favorite!!
If you are feeling lazy and just want to irder in you will realise how much attentions these guys have given .I have never received such nicely packed food with cutlery.
However the only drawback of the food is that the main course is heavy. The quantity looks good for one but can be eaten by two. But as heavy as a Rajastani meal. I guarantee a food coma after eating at this place!!
Another occasion the death by chocolate was divine! Malpua cheesecake tender coconut mousse though sounds fascinating is passable.. 
You gotta eat here and ship this place!!

I visited with my family and a fried. Liked the ambience, taste of the food, presentations and in particular the culinary magic it created. 
We tried the brainstorming munch (set menu) and liked all the items , especially crab cake and chicken in radhuni and last but not the least mango sorbet with a subtle chili. 
Service is bit slow but you can expect a very warm hospitality, we enjoyed all the courses in a relaxed way. 
Overall it was a great gastronomical experience and I would recommend this place for the all the connoisseurs of culinary art.

Fresh flavours and fresh ambiance - that is what this place is for. Though the restaurant is small, they have decorated it well. Feels good when the ambiance and decor is nice.

The menu is full of items with twists. To begin with we loved the Chilli Pickle and Cheese Baked Crab with Kolmi Greens. It was excellent. Those who love deviled crab must try this. 

The Pork Vindaloo was not bad, not great too. 

The Mustard and Tender Coconut Mousse was again excellent. Another must try.

A place where you should be celebrating your special days.

Order for the smoked fish (I think its Bhetki) and be ready to be surprised with how they serve it. [Spoiler alert : It can seem a little intrusive, but be ready for a burst of nice smell that sets the tone for whats coming]

They fuse together bengali food with plated european style platters.

Gondhoraj nimbu is a nice accompaniment for your food.

Must try for both bengalis and non-bengalis.

For me this place was not very extraordinary. Rather I would say it is a 'Ok' type place. 

The ambience was good. Liked their hospitality too.

In the starter Cheese Baked Crab, Aam Kasundi soaked Chicken was something new and good. But did not liked the Smocked Bhetki. Both of our main course Bacon wrapped Chicken and Pachphoron flavoured Parshe was not upto our expectation. Bacon wrapped Chicken was stiff and chewy. At the end we had Malpua Cheesecake which was ok.

As I heard a lot about this place, so I was expecting much more which this place was not able to fulfill.

The mere thought of visiting this place lights up my mood.This is my 4th visit to this place so naturally the expectations were set "up-above-the-sky"!Bohemian certainly did not disappoint me with the quality.In fact the new menu offered is enriched with innumerable variety in prawns,fish,chicken,mutton.But the exorbitant prices tagging along will make me skip the thought of going to this place next time.The shooting prices are really not worth the quantity served. I would have loved to rate the place a whole 5 had the prices been reasonable and proportionate to the quantity served.All the food items start over 350 and shoot as high as 700 or even more!
Our orders were-Aam Kashundi Chicken,Joyous Mutton Chops,Bhetki smoked with cumin and Darjeeling chilli,Gondhoraj Sorbet,a Tamarind based beverage(not able to recall the name but was on the special menu),Kancha Lonka Mangsho,Crabmeat stir fried with pickled garlic,Mutton stir fried with browned onions and sliced chillies,Pabda rolls stewed in cherry tomato and Spinach broth,Panchphoron flavored Parshe with smoked green chilli sauce,Death by Chocolate,Malpua Cheesecake and Gondhoraj Lemon Pie with Ginger Brittle.
Best performers- Death by Chocolate,Crabmeat,Aam kashundi Chicken and as always their bestseller,Malpua Cheesecake.My personal favorite would be the Crab meat (ground in gravy,not whole pieces) and the Aam Kashundi Chicken(beautiful mango tinge added to the chicken fillets).Both were scrumptious and I still savour the taste.The rest of the dishes undoubtedly maintain quality standards too.The mutton was tender,good portions were served.Both the fish items were served with well-fried fishes,no stink at all.Gondhoraj Lemon Pie was a new experience but I would love to stick to our very old Malpua Cheesecake.
And the best part of dining here is- you would be welcoming a varied menu that's not piquant at all.Even the mutton was cooked in adequate spices and oil.The calorie conscious peeps out there- head straight to this place for a toothsome platter with out being guilty inside.Since there's no overboarding of spices in any dish hence each n' every distinct flavor come out very well.The Kolmi greens served with each dish deserve special mention.
There were 6 of us and all of us agreed that the prices were preposterous.The quantity of rice served with each dish was inadequate, we asked for more separately.We were disheartened to find out one of our favorite dishes,Bhetki with radhuni is off the menu,don't know why.
Besides, the management should emphasize more on the interiors.Compared to the location and menu the interiors is poorly done.Such shooting prices and popularity call for an adorned interior with interesting walls,lights and paintings.
To sum it up-Bohemian is an ambrosia of Bong flavours served in Conti-style.Definitely try this place but remember the pocket-pinch(or should i say hole??).

Naam bade aur darshan Chotey. Heard a lot about this place so thought of visting this place. When I entered the place it seemed this is gonna be one of my best visits but everything went deep down when the food came. How can you price something so high that is very low on quality and same thing is available in street food with minimal price. Whatever the cuisine you prepare salt should be there means how can you serve good with such low taste and when we say to management there the reply was it is a different cuisine. Gosh not visiting again and surely wouldn't recommend anyone please work on food preparation. Just for interior I am giving 2.5 star and for now thumbs down for food. Bon appetite!!!

Great concept of fusion Bengali cuisine. Nothing great about the ambience though. But service was very prompt inspite of there being quite a crowd. We ordered spicy seafood chowder, cheese baked crab, sizzled bhetki with pickled garlic, bacon wrapped chicken and malpoa cheesecake. The seafood chowder was neither spicy nor bland . It had the right balance. But the quantity was enough for perhaps a child. The cheese baked crab was a spicier and tangier version of the famous devilled crabs from Mocambo. The bacon wrapped chicken was itself good but the accompanying daliya pilaf didn't do justice to the chicken. The bhetki was recommended by the waiter and was definitely the masterpiece. The preparation was very light and preserved the flavours of the succulent fish. The malpoa cheesecake was okay. They gave us a discount coupon for the next visit. Overall the place is not exactly value for money. But a good place for experimenting once in a while.

One of the finest and another of the "crème de la crème" restaurants of Kolkata. This legendary restaurant offers a unique combo of Continental dishes with Bengali spices and as such u won't find anything quite like this in the city. The food is delectable, and after so many experiments we have fixed this place for a special dineout.
The menu here keeps changing according to some of the newer experiments, hence u get to taste a wide range of fusion cuisine.
To start with we always have a patent starter drink Gondhoraj julep and I swear by their cheese baked Crab in Kolmi greens - for me the best crab dish in Kolkata and probably the best dish overall in here. We normally like to experiment with the main course hence we ordered Sizzled bhetki in pickled garlic, Bacon wrapped chicken, Chitol steak .. {I have actually had a lot of things here but seems like I can only remember this many - my bad}
Each of the dishes were superb, with special mention to the bhetki absolutely melts in your mouth quality, the bacon wrapped chicken is so soft juicy and succulent ohh you just can't have enough. Now for the dessert, actually by the time we arrive to this part of the menu we are almost always full so we never had our fill of the desserts here. However that said we had a couple of patent orders Malpua Cheesecake and Gondhoraj Soufflé (I was very disappointed to see it discontinued in the redone menu). But now I really feel I should go there once just to have my fill on the desserts there. #willDo
One of those places in the city where u can bring along anyone starting from a date to your friends to even your clients. Sometimes the owner of the place chef Joy comes out and asks for a food review himself and that's a unique high.
Just a word of advice, don't go there with a group of people and yes you lose your perfect rating due to this.
I have been here a number of times and would definitely jump at the opportunity to be there yet again.

Out of the box unique dishes, which are surprisingly good to taste and sound equally weird on the menu. Each dish will surely leave you wanting for more, not just for their great taste, but also that the quantity is quite less. I mean, that might have worked if each dish was moderately priced; you could try out a few extra starters and not felt guilty.
But quite unfortunately, the prices are ridiculously high. Sure, one might argue that this restaurant is packaged this way, giving the patron an uber-class experience with the food and ambiance and service...well, does it though?
The entrance of the restaurant has a very ghetto underground look which in no way reflects class. There are some cheaply designed durga pratima ornaments tied together with some narkel dori on the restaurant wall. Maybe a last minute desperate attempt to inject some earthy/tribal feel. The rest of the decor is quite contemporary and these odd pieces jutt out rather then blend in. Considering the premium pricing, would have expected the owner to appoint a decent interior decorator to do an end-to-end theme that gives a nice earthy feel while not seeming tacky.
There is nothing new to talk about the food... at one time it used to stand out in the city for its uniqueness and exquisite quality, thus the justification of such monopoly pricing. But that utopia is long gone and we have a lot of good restaurants, now in the city, dishing out equally great and unique dishes at half the pocket pinch. Yet Bohemian still keeps encashing on those rightly deserved laurels of the past.
It was great to have tried out their dishes for the couple of times I went, but I don't see any reason to go back there anymore as the super premium pricing just does not make sense to me anymore.

Bohemian was the alternative ..it wasn't on the list for the eve's dinner plan. And sometimes, the alternatives surprise us ...they delight us and leave us craving for more....Bohemian by chef Joy Banerjee is such an experience . 

Credit to the chef to lay out such a daring menu ...run his passion and actually deliver that to the palate...

We were a group of three. And we ate our food silently as in prayer ..thanking the Lord for such delectable dishes and explosion of the flavours....

We had the following and would rate all as must haves.
Starters Gondhoraj Lime juice, Baked Crab....and Banana Steam Patties with cumin and crushed pepper.
Mains.. Veg..cheese stuffed cherry tomatoes baby potatoes with mustard and coriander

For the last one year every time we have been out for a lunch or a dinner, the name of Bohemian has cropped up on each occasion. However for reasons unknown to us, we never could make it here. But today was a different day and today we were finally here and how we regret not being here earlier.
Ambience is right up to the mark as most good restaurants these days offer. Good music in the background, comfortable seating and great decor.....all this are a part of the package here....but what's unique is the most essential part - THE FOOD.
The menu is the most unique I have ever seen...an unimaginable blend of Bengali food served Continental style.
Not knowing much and being here for the first time, we asked the person attending to us Mr.Prakash for suggestions and he did a fantastic job at it.
For starters we ordered :
1) Spicy Seafood Chowder with coconut milk, Bengal style.
2) Topshe fritters with Kaalo jeera and poppy seeds.
3) Aam kashundi soaked chicken escallops.
4) Citrus crab cake smoked with crushed coriander.
I don't know where to start.....the seafood soup ..having an excellent blend of flavours of coconut milk and lime as the base. The coconut milk with the correct tanginess of lime made this recipe taste heavenly. Topshe fritters with the sauce was very good too. Aam kashundi chicken escallops had the amazing aroma of mustard and mangoes blended into the meat and the amazing thing was that with each bite the aroma just seemed to increase. Coming to the best amongst the starters...the Citrus crab cake....what an amazing, amazing dish. The aroma of lime was so strong that one would feel like biting into a lemon tart but the flavours of the smoked crab meat made it taste distinctly different. Simply put - the most unique dish I have ever tasted.
Next we ordered the Palate Cleansers:
1) Green mango and green chilli sorbet:
2) Spicy tamarind and mint sorbet:
The palate cleansers prepared us for the next round.
The Main Course:
1) Crabmeat stir fried with pickled Garlic.
2) Panchphoron flavoured Parshe fillets with smoked green chilli sauce.
3) Prawns stewed with Panchphoron, Peanuts and Tamarind.
4) Chicken stewed with Cucumber, Green chillies and minced cumin.
Not too overwhelming, not too underdone....the flavours were blended in just the correct amount and in a manner that with every increasing bite they set in more and more. The soft and succulent crab meat and the perfectly tangy flavours of pickle made the crab recipe stand out in the most exceptional manner.
Parshe in smoked green chilli sauce....the taste of the parshe was of the highest quality and the smoked green chilli sauce was....." aah heaven". Prawns with peanut and Tamarind was red hot and tangy with the gravy being a unique mix of tamarind and chillies. Chicken with Cucumber and green chillies was a strange mix with the end result turning out to be pretty gratifying.
For Desserts we ordered:
1) Mishti Doi Sabayon in Orange tuile with steeped melons.
2) Green mango mousse on Semolina Sand with crispy Pineapple Jalebi.
3) Malpua Cheesecake.
Mishti doi sabayon in Orange tuile was another strange combination.....looked like a Dosa containing Mishti doi but the taste of the package was so exciting....a bite into the entire assortment and the mishti doi slowly faded into oblivion and the taste of Orange very slowly came through.....mind blowing.
The green mango mousse with pineapple jalebi was another nice combination and the Malpua Cheesecake as many reviewers here have already stated.... was the stuff of legends.
Service was excellent, very well mannered hosts and extremely educated as to what they were serving and what we as guests could expect from each recipe.
I don't need to repeat it but still I am.....such innovation and such levels of experimentation with flavours and aromas have rarely been seen. And to top it all...to blend perfection into the experimentation and innovation is an achievement in itself. The unique recipes here can bring tears of joy to any food lover and leave them craving for more.
Hats off to you Chef !!
You have cemented the philosophy of "Rancho" i.e. To do what one loves to do and not to run after success but to try and achieve excellence in what one does....success and accolades (albeit secondary) do eventually follow in due course of time. In your case I would say you have achieved excellence in what you love to do....so hats off again.
One of my major criterion for giving a fiver is the longevity of the restaurant. If the restaurant stands the test of time (other conditions fulfilled), only then does it deserve a fiver. I do not prefer to give a restaurant a score of five straight away on my first visit. Fivers are for legends. But I have made an exception to my own rule.....couldn't help it. I would have given you a tenner but the max that you can score here is five...so that is what you get.
Looking forward to my next visit (which will be pretty soon....I assure) and trying out the other unique recipes that this place has to offer.
Keep innovating....Cheers!!!!

I was surprised to receive the boxes of food from this joint. The packaging was unique, organised and clean. 

Although as I opened the vegetarian eggplant dish, I received a potato salad instead of wilted greens. 

The Daliya pilaf with the bacon wrapped chicken was bland and tasteless and the minted cucumber had no mint whatsoever. The gravy of the chicken was so spicy that My tummy is still messed up as I write this review.

Restaurants must realise that they should deliver what they write and describe on the menu and not send leftovers and create silly concoctions. 

Online food ordering is awesome but instances like this break your trust in ordering online. 

I request Zomato to conduct thorough quality checks before getting such restaurants on board.

While going nowhere close to the literal meaning of the joints name, it derives its own unique identity and stands tall among the hustle and bustle, the malpua cheesecake and their gondhoraj lebu pie is a wily concoction of east meets eastwood. A very nice place as per ambiance and to fulfill your gastronomic desires.

This place has a lot of hype going for it . I finally visited the restaurant on Poila Boisakh. The place has been well done up with quirky lamps ,the wooden stairs leading up to the topmost floor and the mix of old English and modern Bengali songs provided for an old-Calcuttan charm and the contemporary. The ambiance perfectly sets the stage for the much hyped 'Bengali fusion food'.

We started with appetizers of smoked bhetki followed by smoked chicken and spinach' money bags'. The chicken was wrapped in a dumpling-esque coating of spinach leaves and went well with the honey dip provided along with the dish. The bhetki was an extravagant affair with the fillets of fish presented within glasses to retain the smokiness of the fish. Great presentation,good taste, but it was kind of a letdown. The fish fillets were just too small and considering the price of one plate it was really disappointing. 

For the main course we ordered four dishes - Jumbo prawns stewed with field grown herbs, pork stewed with bagane mashla, kacha lonka mangsho and chicken breast stuffed with kolmi greens. The prawns were nothing to write home about, the gravy tasted like a dialled down version of shorshe chingri. The stewed pork was good with succulent pieces of pork mixed well with the gravy. The gravy was mild for my palate and not spicy as I thought it would be. Kacha lonka mangsho was similar to kosha mangsho. It was spicy as it should be but I did feel that the mutton pieces needed to be cooked a tad bit more. The chicken was the best among the four. 

Overall, Bohemian is a nice concept and perhaps the only other restaurant other than K.K's Fusion to take a shot at Bengali fusion food. While that effort is commendable, it would fare better if it increased the food portions.

It was indeed a great gastronomic tour in Bohemian. Innovations in fusions is their forte! The conventional bengali spices and condiments were redefined to dish out 'Mach, Mishti and More'.

After planning and plotting for quite some time i finally had the opportunity to go there .For main course we ordered daab chingri dynamites,bhetki smoked with cumin and quartered darjeeling chilli,pabda rolls stewed in cherry tomato and spinach rolls,chicken breast stuffed with colmi greens and for mocktail gondhoraj julep.Gondhoraj julep had coriander leaves in it which was making it all the more nice to taste.daab chingri dynamite was quite decent which was garnished with kochi daaber saans on top.All the dishes were quite delicious.Now chicken with colmi greens deserves special mention.Before having this i had no idea colmi saag can be this tasty.It was so good that it left us craving for more.Alas! There was no more.Now this is a thing that i would like to mention.The quantity of all these dishes were very less,not even enough to satisfy the hunger of one person.For desserts we ordered malpua cheesecake and pantua baked alaska.The desserts were really innovative and lip-smackingly tasty.
P.s.Compared to the quantity the prices of all dishes were definitely on the higher side.It will surely burn a hole in your pocket but still i would reccomend all the foodies to visit this place atleast once.Because over here your tastebuds will definitely be satisfied to the fullest.

Located conveniently in Ballygunge, this restaurant is very nicely decorated. Headed by chef Joy Banerjee this place has plenty of innovative dishes on its menu card. They basically serve Bengali fusion food. We tried Grilled Chicken wraps with Nolen Gur and Darjeeling Chillies as starter, Sizzled Bhetki simmered with pickled garlic, Kancha Lanka Mangsho, Murshidabadi Barbequed Chicken with Onion Chatni and wine poached eggs
 and Malpoa Cheesecake as dessert. The dessert was so good. All of the items were quirky and different and good. However a word of caution, the taste of the items here are very different from our traditional Bengali food tastes, so if you are not ready to experiment with the tastes, then maybe you should avoid this place. And this place is a bit pricey for the food quantity. But overall I liked the food and their experimental dishes :)

We went to this place for no particular reason, it's close to home, and we felt like trying a new place. What a revelation. Comfortable, laid back and great food, since then, been there thrice and have not been disappointed. Interesting dishes, good portions. Children's options limited and no bar. Can't think of another negative. Must try.

I had come here three years ago on a Puja evening with great expectations. Eventually all my expectations cracked down due to very poor quality of food.
Few days back, many of my friends told that Bohemian has undergone some renovation and has changed the menu too. The main part, the food has improved much more. I was planning to give it a shot since then but got the chance this Thursday. We had been there for lunch.
The resto by Chef Joy Banerjee has geared up with a quirked up decor and really cool accessories. A poster wall with clipped on walls and threads have created a partition between the waiting and the dining area. The walls at the entrance were colourful, cheered up, something to lift your mood up instantly. Inside, there are huge photographs of mountains and valleys which creates a true bohemian feeling. I even loved the lamps hung from the ceiling.
We were asked to wait for two minutes as they got the table prepared for us. Within a minute or two, we had settled in. Although the place is pretty small, still they have managed with spacious furniture to give a relaxed outlook.
For starters, we had ordered, Chilli Pickle and Cheese Baked Crab with Kolmi Greens and the Royal Bengal Liver Pate with dried mango on Crispy Toast. The crab was wonderful. So was the pate, as I am a big fan of it. The dried mangos on top gave a twist with the addition of the sweet and tangy taste. But there was also Kalojeere, whose presence was a major thumbsdown.
For the main course, there were Prawn and Crabmeat Dumplings stewed in a Spicy Nolen Gur Reduction and Sliced Pork with Baby Turmeric wrapped in Banana Leaf Envelopes. The first main was too good. It was so innovative and tasteful. My friend also liked the pork. He said it to be like a home curry or some Pork Paturi. I didn't like the smell of turmeric much. But he liked it.
Desserts had a wide range. I got confused which one to choose from. I chose Aamarel Custard with Crispy Fried Milk. Their executive came to us suggesting the Toffee Rossogollas with Green Chilli Sabayon. Trust me, the best part of Bohemian is their desserts. The custard was mango custard with a flavour of sweet coconut as they said it was the flavour used in the custard powder. The dessert was topped with crispy fried milk - that's basically some kind of sweet nimkis we get them at the melas and buy them by weight. The toffee rossogollas were the best. Caramelized baby rossogollas served with a mousse that had bits of Green Chilli mixed with it. It tasted so different when the two were mixed. This came being covered by my childhood favourite cotton candy and I absolutely loved it.
Bohemian has done a wonderfully brilliant job in fusing different cuisines and different tastes altogether which may create a new saga of culinary culture in this age of molecular gastronomy. But they need to know a few things which might not go well always, like the Kalojeere part and so on. One more thing, why I took the points down is because their pricing is too high. It costed me 3K to have this meal. At many other places, with this quality of food and quantity, it would have been lesser. They should look upon the pricing seriously.
Wish to try their picnic basket out sometime soon. Wishing them all the very best for creating more fusion dishes in the perfect way and surprise us. We had a great time here. Happy Dining! :)

Everything washes down well with the gondhoraj serbet. It's even better now that they have expanded the seating capacity. Waiting for winter to get my pass on one of those picnic baskets.

It's one of those places you get a really good feeling about the moment you step inside its doors. I mean what's not to like- the soothing decor, the aroma of scented candles, posters and caricatures of your favourite timeless bands welcoming you to a gastronomic experience of an innovative blend of continental and bengali food. For starters we ordered chilli pickle and cheese baked crab with Kolmi greens, and grilled chicken wraps with nolen gur and darjeeling chillies. While the crabmeat was simply superb and hands down, one of the best in Kolkata, the chicken wraps were a bit disappointing..the smell and taste of gur overpowered the taste of chicken..and one couldnot really differentiate between any of them. Our main course was an extravaganza of murshibadi barbequed chicken with onion chutney, bacon wrapped chicken with aam kasundi reduction, pork stewed with bagane masala, fragnant chilli and cheese and finally, firangee mutton roast with spinach and coconut jus. The bacon wrapped chicken and pork stew were beautifully cooked and we also loved mutton roast and murshidabadi barbequed chicken. As for desserts, we were impressed by the innovative preparations and the taste was spot on! Who would have thought that malpoa and cheesecake would blend so well together or that little pantuas in a bed of ice cream and sponge cake would overwhelm your tastebuds so!! I also loved how cordial and helpful the staff were! If you want to experiment with unique tastes and innovative fusion delicacies...do drop by!!

I went there on a nice summer evening of 10th may 2016.. with an empty stomach and a hope of experiencing something new.. and it fully lived upto my expectations though at a price which was on a bit higher range..but it was a evening well spent...
Ambience: On entering it sets the mood of the restaurant with the aroma of various indian spices..with its sented candles.. inspite of being a bit short in space...it lives.. upto its name by stricking a balance between the indian and western influence in its decor.
FOOD:
In Starter we had:
1. BAKED CRAB..Which was quite nice to hav with the flavour of kalmi.. saag infused in its preparation... bring a good indian twist to this western dish. Though the quantity was less but.. it kept a taste in you mouth wanting for more
2. NOLENGUR CHICKEN: Well it was the only bad dish I had hear... the flavour of nolengur simply over powered the chicken.. and in mouth I simply cudn't distinguished between the two...as there was no synergy.
3. JOYOUS MUTTON CHOPS: Well it was awesome.. and the best i had here among all..the meat was tender and the associated..gravy..was infused with the flavour of mutton..and it made the mutton an hero of the dish..
IN Main Course:
1. Murshidabadi Barbecue Chicken : Well it was good but did find it much remarkable... and tasty except for the mayonnaise base gravy in which the by far boiled and bland chicken was drenched in.. as I love mayonnaise I had it neway but its not something i'll hav again...
Dessert:
1. Baked baby Pantua Ice Cream with Miringue:
Well it was nice to hav.. & Miringue was something new for me.. and the presentation was good...
2. MALPUA CHEESE CAKE: Well it was really good to hav and a really innovative and tasty fusion dessert i ever had untill now
TO SUMMARIZE... the vist to Bohemian took me on a memorable and awesome gustatory & olfactory adventure....with its food and aromatic ambience...thanx.. Bohemian &

Bacon wrapped chicken in aam kasundi and  malpua cheesecake were too good. But the quantity is pretty less in comparison with the pricing. Total love. A must visit for all!

If you are looking for fusion or innovative food..go here. The mocktaits lemon & mint julep, mind blowing refreshing (especially lemon one, I had 2). We ordered crabmeat in kolmi green (indianized version of mocambos devilled crabs), smoked bhetki, very interesting presentation. Barbq chicken in nolen gur(the best by far). Banana stem patties can be missed. For main course it was murshidabad chicken wit herbs, I was not very happy with the chicken, it was bland n dry. Kancha Lanka mangsho, very okaish, wasn't spicy at al as expected. Bacon wrapped chicken curry. Best was jumbo prawns was too delicious. Dessert we ordered cigar n coffee mousse, great presentation average taste. Malpua cheesecake a must have for its innovation. Overall Kolkata is yet to have another plac like this. Its brilliant, great concept n well implemented

Cool is a one word description.
One of the few restaurants which lived upto expectation. Was very satisfied at the way they handled the difficult fusion concept~ marrying bengali with western cuisine. Cool appetizers ( chicken on lemongeass skewers were wow) The fish items really taste good ans the gondhoraj drinks would score brownie points. Good job, this place did experimental food right. Oh and the decor is cool as well. The only thing is its a small restaurant, not recommended for big groups.

The decor, ambience and food were amazing. 

We tried the gondhoraaj julep and Bluuuu as refreshing drinks. I loved the julep..just the right amount of sweet and fizz.

Moving on to the main course, I ordered the mutton platter (with simmered baby potatoes) which was delicious! The others had chicken and pork platters. Make sure you mention the amount of spices you want after ordering. 

The desserts were pleasantly tasty. I'm not exactly a fan of Bengali sweets but the Pantua- Alaska blew me over. Also delicious were Death by Chocolate and Gondhoraj Lemon Pie. The Coffee and Cigar Mousse takes some time to set in. If you aren't a fan of tobacco products (like I am not) you'd find it a bit too strong. So this isn't recommended for anyone with an aversion to tobacco, because it leaves a typical smoky aftertaste which might just be uncomfortable.

The music was pepped up at our request. Waiters were friendly and waiting time was a bearable half an hour, considering the rush. 

Overall, it was a wonderful experience. Bengali fusion food was a new experience for me and I love the fact that chef Joy Banerjee has really made amazing and innovative combinations instead of just mixing and matching for the sake of it.

We went there purely on recommendation...all my friends n relatives were completely floored by Bohemian...high time for me to check it out. And of course the food did not disappoint us. I will agree with fellow reviewers that the restaurant is pretty high priced in terms of quantity. I was appalled when our Dab Chingri Dynamites arrived...considering it's cost only a spoonful of prawns is the least I expected. The taste was good but the quantity not worth appreciating. But then the main course for a moment helped me forget the price...we had gone for baked crabmeat with pickled garlic as reviewed excellent by many. It just melted in the mouth and what a continental presentation of crabs!!! The chicken rolls with smoked orange and coriander was equally enticing and the portion of poha in Italian style along with the chicken dish took my heart away. Not to forget the malpua cheesecake...fusion at its best. Every layer of the cheesecake made me want more. Amazing fusion food...but again not cost effective!

Most of us do not prefer spending on Bengali food which we get at home. But when it is blended nicely with other cuisines? That is what bohemian serves. Blending of subtleness with spice. Most innovative style of cooking served in most Bengali way.
They have varied collection of items which offers you the opportunity to experiment with your palate. Ambience is impressive, service is good.
But unfortunately serving  quantity is very less. one main dish which is served with small amount of rice,salad and the item (Fish,meat,prawn or veg) is not sufficient to satisfy the hunger of one adult although the price is unjustifiedly high.

Yesterday (23.4.16) went here. Ordered to Chicken in Aam Kasundi Reduction sauce and Bacon Wrapped Chicken in Cheese gravy.

However fancy the names may suggest, the tastes were, at best, average. Could have rated or liked a bit more, if such redundant experiments were not suggested by the Captain.

I remember visiting the place 3years back, when it used to be the talk of the town and it did then lived upto its name and reputation. 

Now (2016)things seems to have changed. The restaurant management better realise that all their experiments with bengali food is not destined for success.

Good place in terms of ambience and service. BUT IF YOU ARE A VEGETARIAN.. pay attention to this review. You don't get much variety at max 4 dishes and only with rice... so be aware!! For me, staff was kind enough to suggest me to go to kwality restaurant nearby.. you know I am going to review kwality after this writeup ;)

What food !! What food !!! What  wonderful food !! I may well try and enact the Tony Greg commentry for the Prince of Calcutta, but will not be able to do justice on the expression to describe the satisfaction u have after having the food at Bohemian !! It is heavenly and soul satisfying food !! And the consistency of the dishes they prepare even on a day like "Noboborsho" !! All Salute to Joy !!

Loved the place. They have given a different flavor to all the dishes. We tried the topse fritters, steamed chicken, pabda roll, bhetki in garlic sauce, bhetki in lemon, bhetki with pomegranate, mutton and malpua cheesecake. We loved each of them. No monotony in any of them.

Easy five, great ambience and a uniquely experimental menu that works.

Try the malai prawn starters which are the best in the country,and dare to live and love a little. Unlike most of my reviews I won't give a specific recommendation as to what to try because I think choosing your meal here is a treat in itself.

The exception is their nolen gur based dessert which is a must have.

We ate there recently. The booking was easy. Situated in a very old house, with unusual funky design! The service was on the slow side but very attentive. We had Gandhoraj Julep as a drink which was very refreshing and bursting with taste. Not to be missed. Spicy pumpkin soup with prawn was excellent, very exotic. As starters we had Dab Chingri Dynamite which was absolutely wonderful, could taste all the ingredients blending into a wonderful sublime experience. Topse fritters with kalojeera and poppy seed was just sublime. As entrees we had Kancha Lanka Mangso( rather disappointing and subdued), Prawns with panchporon, peanuts and tamarind( absolutely one of the best prawn dish we have had) and a must, not to be missed! Crabmeat stir fried with pickled garlic was oh so wonderful! Lapped it up to the last drop. As dessert we chose cheesecake with malpo( wonderful blend of taste with perfect harmony) and mustard and coconut mousse( very different from the usual western mousse, subdued mustard but delicate) a 4 1/2 star in view of the slight disappointment with Kosha Mangso. All in all a truly memorable gastronomic experience. Must caution: the sizes are rather on the small side( more like a French cuisine) and rather pricey. Must congratulate the chef Joy Banerji for creating this wonderful cuisine. A masterpiece indeed.

Such a mind blowing experience. Had heard a lot about this place and it was about time I visited this place . Small cosy joint , quirky decors , pleasant service and an amazing bengali fusion food to go along with .Whats not to love. We tried the baked crabmeat in chilli mustard garlic pickle and stir fried mutton wiyh chilly coriander as starter. Each taste was exemplary . Then for the main course we went with Prawns stewed with panch phoron , peanuts and tamarind ,with wilted greens and rice, and simmered bhekti with chilli garlic . Outstanding. The best of the lot was the malpoa cheesecake. Out of the world. They have taken culinary skills to a different level altogether. Total love .

If a restaurant satifies the quote in this world packing matters and not the content then surely it is Bohemian. An exhorbitantly catchy and overpriced joint with average food under the catchy tagline fusion food with waiters serving food like magicians is disgusting. A special note should also be given regarding the portions served I believe the portions served will not satisfy the hunger of any man on earth. Overall not a very good dining experience.

The only place I can go back again and again.
Although it is often argued that nothing is all perfect, I think this place is an exception to the rule. Its hard to find a flaw.
A great place to tingle those Bengali taste buds. Shaag, Phoran, Mangsho, Maachh, and all things Bengali tastes even better here. And, my personal favourites include the Vodka soaked prawns, Chicken breast stuffed with kolmi greens served with cheese and green chilli pickle, Panchphoran flavoured parshe fillets with smoked green chilli sauce, the mint julep and the gondhoraj julep.

Will I go back? I have been there like 10 times and I can go back several times and without reason..

Fusion food! That too Bengali! Sounds interesting right? It was indeed! And it was one of the best experience I ever had in my food journey till now!
Went there to celebrate the first job of my girl! Special occasion calls for special celebration! Heard a lot about this place! One of a kind restaurant offering mouth watering and mind wondering fusion dishes! The area is close to my heart as well. It's situated just opposite to my school Patha Bhavan in Bullygunge Place. Spend the best moments of my life in this area as a kid!
We ordered a drink , don't remember the exact name but it a was fusion of soda and pudina and gandhoraj lebu! Blown away by the freshness and original flavour of lemon and pudina. Then came the master dish: nolengur- chicken pancakes! Yeah! You have heard it right! You might think: what kinda combo is that! But after having it I am sure you can't help it but praise the creator of such an amazing preparation! A tint of jaggery flavour with chilly in every bite gives you a beautiful sensation in your taste buds which you never knew exited ! And they do the same with almost every dish they offer! The pineapple Bhekty combo! The gandhoraz ilish! The Malpoa cheesecake! And many more of such mind boggling and creative dishes which will give you a new and unmatchable experience!!
Hats off to the chef! You people did some serious research I am sure before coming up with such delicacies !!!
A must visit for all! For all age and group! There is no way you will regret it!
The price is one the higher side! Being the pioneer they do charge much more than others. But once you have their delicacies I believe you will feel it's worth trying!!

This is my dream restaurant! 
If there is any place that defines fusion the right way then it's here. Fusion food and how. Absolutely surprising and beyond delicious. 
So the concept is Bengali fusion food. The place is done up in a very artsy comfortable way. 
Naming a few of the dishes like chilli pickle and cheese baked crab with kolmi greens. Kolmi is a kind of leafy vegetable found specifically in Kolkata. And what this fusion does to your tongue is only wow! 
Sizzled Bhetki. Again a river water fish given a Japanese twist. Sizzlers originated from Japan as I know. 
Each and every one of their dishes is definitely worth a try. The elements are uniquely and creatively put together to give you a taste that you will definitely take with you. 
Even when it comes to their desserts like cigar and coffee mousse. I am sure the name itself has a lot of people interested. 
It's a different experience all together. One of its kind! Do try. 
I would love to open a franchise of the same in Mumbai some day.

Not able to understand the hype about this place. Agreed that the flavours are a take on traditional tastes with modern colors but that doesn't mean that they taste good. The starters we ordered were far better than the main course, which was a huge letdown. Plus, the prices for the tiny portions are unjustified. Also, the interiors of the place were desperately screaming to impress the patrons but it didn't really happen! I'd still give this place a 3.0 rating because of the delicious bhetki starter and gondhoraj mint julep!

Joymalya Banerjee has always been an element of surprise. Right from the moment you enter the staff is there to give you utmost attention. Gondhoraj sorbet is perhaps the best thing you'll ever taste. Even the telapia preperation is wonderful. Lamb preperations are out of the world. But he saves the best for last. Malpua pancake and death by chocolate are the beat thing you'll taste. Oh sorry, I've already given the pedestal to sorbet. :)

From the moment I landed at Kolkata, I started hearing about this place. It is very close to where I stay and as much as I'd have liked to eat there, circumstances had me partake in a takeaway. I did get to sit briefly in the waiting area and noted that the place is quite compact and dedicated to rock bands of yesteryear. Packaging of food for home delivery was very good.

We ordered two starters and a main. Starters were cheese baked crab and joyous mutton chops. Main course was the lemon and mustard baked chicken. The crab was very nice though I do wish the crab pieces were a little bigger. The crab is basically nearly mashed up and mixed with mustard and cheese. The dish is served in those earthen mishti doi containers which I found charming!

The lamb was more for my parents as I am not much of a lamb fan. I did taste a piece and it was very flavourful. There were 3 lamb chops and 1 smaller piece - quite filling.

The chicken dish, although tasty, was not as impressive as the other two. I felt this primarily because it reminded me very much of a Kerala dish - chicken stew made with coconut milk and curry leaves. This dish however has a strong hint of mustard instead. The chicken pieces by themselves were succulent and the gravy went very well with the plain rice that was part of the dish.

Overall- I'd love to come back and try more items on my next visit hopefully.

Tip- the mutton dish is heavy. Three of us had these three items and were not able to have anything else! Skip the lemon chicken dish.

Ah ! Bohemian!.. I am embarrassed to admit that I only discovered it late last year.. but what a [lace.. it is a treat to the taste buds and a tribute to the Bengali gastronome.. Kudos to the chef for coming up with outstanding fusion dishes using mostly Bengali favourites.. All the dishes we tried teased our senses with the multiple flavours and the subtle nuances playing against each other.. For appetizers we had the aam kashundi soaked Chicken escalopes  - the kids and adults all loved it and ordered extra helpings :),- Bhetki smoked with Cumin and Stir fried mutton with mustard and corainder. The bhekti smoked with cumin was a treat as , the servers lift the glass enclosing the fish , the aroma of smoked cumin fills your nostrils and then you bite into the subtly flavoured fish.. heavenly!
This set the stage for the main course and by now were dying of anticipated culinary Nirvana! We were not to be disappointed.. For me the prawns  and crabmeat dumplings stwede in spicy Nolen Gur reduction took my breath away.. the Gur ( traditional palm jaggery) married  with Darjeeling Chilli  had my tongue craving for more. The prawns with smoky orange and coriander was another winning combination and so was the sizzling Bhetki with pickled garlic. I would say only the foil baked bhetki with baby turmeric and teen phoron was a little mild but by no means to be written off.
Well after the wonderful treats we did not have room for dessert though I wish we had. I have to save that for my next trip to Kolkata.
But hats off to the chef for coming up with a wonderful place in Ballygunge place which can give any traditional Bengali restaurant a run for their money

With fusion being the new 'it', chef Joy Banerjee does an excellent job of introducing it in the food sector as well. Bohemian is an out and out experimental restaurant, where the tackiest of combinations have been put together to give mouth-watering delicacies.

The interior of the place may be simple, but it's all about the food. For Starters, we tried the Cheese Baked Crab, and Topshe Fritters. The later was a little disappointing, given that my Grandmother may give any restaurant a run for money with her Topshe Fry. However, the Cheese Baked Crab is good, although it is slightly on the lines of Mocambo's legendary dish of the same type.
For the main course, we went for Prawn and Crabmeat Dumplings in Nolen Gur reduction served with Steamed Rice, Bacon Wrapped Chicken in Aam Kashundi served with Daliya and Sizzled Bhetki shimmered in pickled garlic served with celery rice. Now, the first dish is again a fusion dish, which goes for the most bizarre combination. It is not meant for the spice-lovers, but may go down well with ones having a sweet tooth. The second is the reason I gave such a high rating to this restaurant. It was heavenly. Period. The Bhetki was not something that stuck with me long after.

For desserts, we tried the Gondhoraj Lemon Pie and Pantua Baked Alaska. Am known for gorging on desserts, and this instance was no such exception. The Lemon Pie is a speciality of the place, and is a must try for everyone visiting the place.

I came here during my recent trip to India. I heard so much praise for this restaurant that it was in my wish list during this year's trip to home. We had had a crab item as the starter and it was quite fabulous. But the rest was rather forgettable. There was a dish of nolen gur and chicken, which tasted horrible. And then, there was kancha lanka mangsho, which was not up to the mark. Braised pork was moderately good and the day was saved by Gondhoraj Julep.

The interior is average but definitely on the good side.. It's fusion food.. Bong & Conti.. Personally I dint like the main course being a vegetarian.. The menu doesn't offer much for vegetarians.. To top that I was served "cold" food.. Rice was steaming hot but the side dish was as cold as if just out of the fridge.. Probably they don't cook & serve.. It was cooked way back & stored in the fridge & they forgot to heat it.. So not sure how fresh the food is.. Desserts are good.. Drinks are okay'ish..
Price is on the higher side.. I din't find the food worth what I paid..
As a whole, I wouldn't want to visit this place again..
Am rating 1.5 for the desserts..
Cheers!~
Happy Eating!~

Awesome bong food with a twist! Fairly extensive menu, every dish has a traditional bong inspiration fused with touches of continental techniques and ingredients. We had the baked crab with chillies and cheese,  joyous mutton chops, and cumin crusted smoked bhetki for starters. For mains, we had the murshidabadi chicken with onion chutney and pabda  rolls with bori pilaf. You could taste the unmistakable bong element in each dish (shorshe, panch phoron, etc), yet it was unique in its own right and blended very well with the creams and cheeses of the continental influence. For desserts, we had the guava rock salt sorbet and the malpua cheesecake. All the things that we tried were well executed. This place will surely be high on the agenda on all subsequent cal trips.

If you're thinking of finger licking non-vegetarian,fusion bengali delicacy, welcome to Bohemian, run by none other than Calcutta's very own chéf Joy Banerjee! Here you can immerse yourself in a wide range of choices, mainly in non vegetarian items. The vegetarian food however is nothing out of the world. We totally indulged ourselves in Bacon wrapped chicken with Aam Kashundi reduction , for starters. If you have a thing for spicy meat dishes, you might as well go for the kancha lonka mangsho ( basically a very spicy mutton preparation served with steamed rice). The quantity offered is sufficient for one person only.
Being a hardcore cheese lover, the cheese baked crabs just blew my mind. Also, the desserts are plain delicious. I would specifically vote for the malpua cheesecake and 'Cigar & Coffee' mousse. Well honestly speaking, the service, though not too slow, takes a comparatively longer time, supposedly because these kinds of dishes usually take some time to prepare! Overall, it was a pleasant experience. They've got a very nice, cosy ambiance. If you ask me, it's the perfect place for bong-continental fusion food.

I and some friends ate at Bohemia some days back. The food as usual was excellent, the rest – ambience, service and outlook - not so. Practically no restaurant in Kolkata, even five star, has the temerity to refuse free filtered water. We accept that there is no space for a filter in the elbow-to-elbow layout, and would buy water accordingly, but why the attempt to fool us? A notice in the Menu Card claims “Unless otherwise specified we only pour packaged water.” Exactly what does this bluff mean. Can’t they say “Only packaged water available.” After I made a fuss I was given a glass of tap water, since the waiters themselves could not explain, what “otherwise specified” meant.

This restaurant has been a really nice place to eat. The ambience of the restaurant is quite eccentric in the positive sense with its 'bohemian' decorations. The vodka-soaked prawn was delicious as a starter and definitely recommendable. In the main courses, the dishes are a little bit expensive, given the fact that the rice serving with the delicacies are small and you may need to order another serving of plain rice depending on your appetite. Most or all of the fish fillets are boneless and very well cooked. We took a Parshey item and a Pomfret one and both of them were very palatable. The dessert option of Malpoa cheesecake was a surprise try, but the amalgamation of cheese layers and malpoa didn't quite bring out the sweet flavor that we expected.

Over all, one should definitely try out this restaurant and stick to the seafood options as much as possible.

Well, we reached the restaurant by accident. My kid and I on a vacation in Kolkata zeroed in on a well known Bengali cuisine restaurant in Ballygunge. However, to our disappointment found to be closed undergoing renovation.
Unfamiliar with the area, using zomato we landed up in the 'Bohemian'.
First up, I can unapologetically say that it was a wise choice. I never have a fancy for fusion stuff and this advertised itself as a Bengali fusion outlet. Though I could see that this is popular amonst its patrons but I still had my inhibitions.
The menu though seemed novel and we allowed the server to guide us. For myself, I ordered a Mutton and baby potatoes simmered with green mango and okra (wow!). It was served with steamed rice and a small bowl of greens. Mutton and okra seemed to me unlikely companions but it was one of the best dish I had in the city. The mutton in a thin yellow gravy was tender and went so well with the okra. The greens complemented the dish well. For my kid, we chose low spicy Murshidabadi barbecued chicken with onion chutney with wine poached eggs. This was served with sweet pita for him and a potato mustard salad. The portions were too much for the young man but he relished it. Both dishes stood out by themselves. My complements to Chef Joy Banerjee. It would have been interesting to try out their other stuff but we are not residents of the city. 
We rounded off by having Aamarel custard and Malpua Cheesecake - not exceptional but interesting. Some of our preffered desserts were then not available.  
We were set back by about Rs 1870 but had great Sunday lunch. The service was nippy and the space, was well, somewhat constrained. But nothing to digress from a good culinary experience.

Lovely interiors which went well with the fusion theme, soft music in the background and delicious food served in front of u. Ideally romantic place and needless to say we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly.
Now food. We ordered bhetki smoked with cumin and darjeeling chilli and Gondhoraj julep to go with it( I found it to be overhyped and didn't like it at all). For the main course we took the recommended dishes. Murshidabadi barbequed Chicken and Kancha longka mangsho. Both were well prepared. Special mention of the onion chutney that came with the murshidabadi chicken. One complaint though. I found the chicken pieces to b a bit hard. On the contrary the mutton pieces were extremely soft and tasty. Pita served with the chicken was fluffy and tasty. Brownie points for the topping of egg. Kancha longka mangsho contained ample amount of mutton pieces and gravy but the rice provided with it was too less in quantity. For dessert we stuck to the traditional Malpua cheesecake and gondhoraj lemon pie. Both were damn good but I liked the gonghoraj pir better. Neither too bland not too sweet with a slight aroma of gonhoraj. Lovely. Presentation of each n every dish was unique. 

Service is top notch and as I mentioned we being the only guests the waiters inquired repeatedly if food was up to the mark. I just have one issue. I found the amount of starter to b painstakingly low. I mean yes I know its fusion food but c'mon 429 bucks for 6 little pieces of bhetki!!! ( hv attached pics). This is one of those classy places no doubt but personally this was a very very big let down coz I do not like to compromise when it comes to food. Paying bills is not an issue but not being satisfied at a place like Bohemian is. Quality of food is top class but a hearty request from a foodie - plz do not provide micro proportions of food while charging sky high prices as well as hefty tax for them.

Having said all this it was really a nice experience and considering the exquisite dishes Bohemian provides I would like to visit again if only they look into the qunatity of food provided. But kudos to the team for such innovative concept.😀

A visit to 'Bohemian' (off Broad Street) was long overdue. Finally found the time today to drop in for lunch.
Just a couple of things to say about this exquisite fusion food joint. There are two kinds of chefs. One who cooks and the other who creates. Bohemian chefs rightfully claim their fame in the later category. And it's for them, Kolkata can truly boast of having its own gourmet menu.
We would love to see this Bohemian wandering around, going places!

The most disgusting food I've ever tasted. The food was either too sweet or too salty, it lacked flavor and quite frankly this might be the worst food I've had the displeasure of tasting in my entire life. The only good part of the eating experience there was that it was only 2 courses and I didn't make the mistake of ordering desert. Yuck times a million!!! :(

New year eve... 2016.. Accha khana banta hai..
I again visited Kolkata. Me and my foodie bestie decided to surf zomato and try some Zara hatke food.
Bohemian attracted us.. Fusion bong food...waoo.... 
Very lucky we were... The time we reached (1.30pm) no one has arrived yet.. So no waiting time. Zonked by the menu list..all seemed so tempting. Just couldn't decide the best..
So we took help of the guy and decided to go for chef special and Bohemian signature dishes. So our order was 
Sea food soup... Yummmmyyy it was
Bacon wrapped chicken in Aam Kasundi reduction.
Chilli pickle and cheese baked crab with Kolmi greens.
Pita bread in mustard green chilli and kalojeera
In main course we ordered 
Pork vindaloo, Anglo Indian spices
Kacha lonka Mansho(mutton)
And Pan shocked Bhetki...
Simply awesome... We were so filled that we couldn't taste the deserts. Our New Year lunch was way above our expectations.
I would love to visit again and try the rest.

To add... Very simple yet great ambiance soft Bengali songs at the back ground.. To add great washroom decoration too...
Loved it...

Great fusion foods. Highly recommended...Daab Chingri Dynamite, Gondhoraj Dhonepata Julep, Bacon wrapped Chicken and pantua baked alaska. Delicious! The service was brilliant. They were almpst too dedicated. Haha! Brilliant service coupled with brilliant innovative food makes this Bong a happy guy.
P.S. The prices can be a factor. Slightly on the high side. But worth it.

If u want to taste Bengali food that have never crossed your mind, a mixture of ingredients u thought only fools would mix to prepare a dish, then this is the place...
Customers would either love this place or hate it, there's nothing in between...
I personally LOOOOOVED it!!!
The food here as uncommon as it can get. So many dishes and such variety and unusual recipes. The drinks are also one of a kind. The ambiance is apt for young and middle aged people. The waiters help us with honest suggestions and guide the first timers so that our taste buds have a delightful experience.
Each of the main course dishes are recommended to be served for one person but if u request then they will serve it family-style...
From the outside it looks a little unwelcoming though. I cannot describe the food nor how they taste in general coz its that unheard of to say the least...
I had a great experience...

Another kolkata favourite, and a must-go-to place. I can say with a 100% guarantee ( well almost) that what they serve is not served anywhere else in the whole wide world! Kudos to chef Joy 👏👏👏
Although they have a lot of amazing things on the menu, I'll talk about only 2 things, that I never fail to order whenever I visit. 
The first thing is a crabmeat and kalmi shaak based starter! Oh! Its to die for 😍
And the other not to be missed item ( especially for bacon lovers!) is the bacon wrapped chicken in aam kasundi reduction. I'll never tire of eating it! Totally drool worthy! Love you bohemian and will continue to do so for as long we both shall live 😍
Oh n full points for the decore, the ambience and the staff who r very courteous and warm.

I have visited Bohemian many a times since they opened up but 30th December, 2015 was my first visit since they revamped their menu and increased their seating. As always, the servers were courteous and helpful in selection of the courses. The food was lip smacking and sumptuous, in fact even better since I had last visited it. Kudos to the Chef for pulling off such unique fusion! I would have rated it 5/5 but for the two suggestions, one the pannacotta was too thick and heavy which made it taste pudding like rather than a panna cotta and secondly while handling orders for large groups, they should give a caveat about the waiting time! Otherwise, it was a superb gastronomic experience!

A friend and I are at Bohemian right now - have been waiting for the main course for more than 45 minutes after placing the order. People who came after us are being catered to before us. There was thermocol on the ice cubes in our drink. The food may be good but I don't think I'd want to come back if the service is so poor.

Chef Joy Banerjee surely knows how to create delightful flavors by mixing different ingredients! We went for lunch after looking up the high Zomato rating. Although the interior was smaller than expected, the ambience was quite nice, and the decorations as well as the music filled the restaurant with a casual vibe. 
Both the soups we ordered- Safood chowder with coconut milk and Lentil soup- had distinctive flavors, much different from the conventional soups you find being served at most restaurants. The soups' portion size was just right, i.e. smaller than that seen in other places, ensuring that people don't feel too full to eat starters and main course. Thankfully, the chowder wasn't excessively spicy, despite being marked as 'Spicy' on the menu.
For starters, we took the Cheese Baked Crab, which is a specialty here, Aam Kasundi Chicken Escallops and Corn and Spinach Wraps. The crab was delicious, and the chicken, though a bit dry, had a nice mangoish flavor. The wraps were served quite late, but were tasty. 
The main course was my favorite. We ordered Prawns with Smoky Orange and Coriander, wanting to try something different. The orange flavor didn't make the dish too sweet, but just balanced the spiciness, creating a delicious combination. 
Dessert was Malpua Cheesecake, another specialty. It wasn't too sweet and one could taste the malpua in it. Delicious.
My only complaint is that the wraps were served way after the other starters. The waiter told us to order the main course early, saying that it would take an hour to prepare. At first, that dampened our mood. But the food was worth the wait!

While I am going to write this review first of all I just want to clear the review is based on entirely my vision.
So on the very beginning I want to tell that I was very very excited to visit this restaurant.The fusion the variety they have mentioned in their site that was in single word mesmerising.
So one December afternoon I just went there.
The interior of the restaurant is decent clean.Bright colour combination gave it a refreshing look,even the toilet is not out of the concern.Which was really appreciable.
Now coming to waiters who are really very courteous and decent sense of food combination to prescribe you.overall its good too.
Now coming to the food
We ordered 
1.Gonddhoraj sorbet,(decent)
2.Spiced mango(good)
3.Pan soaked bhetki simmered with wood smoked pineapple and cumnis-well this dish too sweet,I didn't really like it honestly.the flavour of pine apple is coming mainly instead the twisting taste of cumin,smokeiness of the wood burn bhetki.the sauté veggies are not so good.it should get cook for a while.
4.Chicken breast stuffed with kolmi green,simmered with cheese & green chilli pickle.-this dish was awsum.the chicken was very well cooked.I never tasted so well chicken breast fillet preparation with such a twist.the cheese and kolme combination was  just perfect 
5.Pork stewed with bagane mashla,frogrant chilli and cheese-(suggested by the waiter)the pork pieces are not well cooked they were chewy and taste of the dish on average When I asked the waiter to change it he said they were just shortage of those particular dish and it will take time to prepare it again so I had to finish the h willingly . But the dish was not so impressive.
6.Malpua cheese cake-This was the dish which I will never forget.the taste was just perfect the cheese and malpua were well distributed in layers and layers.so I think this was the best dish I tasted on that day particularly.
Now coming to the budget .This is not at all a budget restaurant some dishes even were over priced.but whenever you have tried their signature dishes you will find the price worthy.
So with no offense I am rating it 3.5.

The concept of bengali food with a continental  flavor is appealing. For such an innovative mix, this place doesn't let you down. Starters and coolers are excellent. Main courses are not so great. Desserts are a different level altogether. I still remember 'Nolen Gurer Cheesecake' from my visit there. This is a must visit place for all food lovers.

I suppose this was my first taste of plush Ballygunge :) Bohemian came highly rated and when we stepped in, I was very intrigued by the cutesy/quirky interiors. The menu was 100% original, the dishes unlike anything you would have seen anywhere. Haute cuisine indeed. Of course, my middle class soul was taken aback by the prices :) 

On to the food. The spicy pumpkin soup took me to the moon and back! Could a dish be prepared more exquisitely than this? I think starting with this raised the stakes too high for Bohemian. The panchphoron pita was certainly interesting, if you could leave memories of bakery pizza behind :) For mains, I had the cauliflower and mustard pudding. It was good - the creamy cauliflower sauce, the fragrant rice, the punchy mustard. Sadly the green chilly overdose ruined it. How that happened, I don't know. It was overdone to the point of being unacceptable. My friend enjoyed his kancha lanka mangsho. Good but not great, was his feedback. 

The dessert options had me fascinated. I took forever deciding but alas, both my choices were unavailable (the roshogolla and pannacotta). We then went with the relatively safe malpua cheesecake. Unexpectedly, it brought down our meal by several notches. It had a funny funky flavor (too much cardamom?). Nothing about it worked. Very disappointing when there is so much anticipation and you are paying so much. 

Overall, it was very hit and miss.

I was totally floored by the flavours, which felt familiar, yet were new. The decor is homely and if you are looking to have a great meal with friends and family in a comfortable setting that is away from home, then this is the place.

My advice would be to go by what the server recommends. We loved the cheese baked crab, prawn vodka, pork envelope and pantua baked Alaska. What disappointed us was the Royal Bengal Slice Pork Fried (which we selected ourselves, hence the word of caution). It was done a lot like a telebhaja (too oily and dried out pork). 

All in all, a great place for those who love experimenting with food.

The kancha lanka mangso is simply out of the world.. So as the gandhoraj julep..murshidabadi chicken is quite a heavy dish..overall experience was outstanding..

Visited this restaurant on Sunday, Nov 29, 2015 over dinner, was more or less empty, so got a table to choose for two of us. The entrance is nice, followed by long curtains in stairs to go up. Decor inside is inspired by Ladakh landscape with picture frames around, as well as a part of wall depicts the ashtra that goddess durga and other gods hold in their hands, though both dont have a connect. Tables are kept simple with lamps hanging above. In all, causal dining ambience with music of random songs mix of english and hindi. We went thru the menu which had a brief on thje chef, liked the thumb paint prints. Ordered dab chingri dynamites and baked cheese crab for starters. The prawn was really nice with a blend of fresh malai from coconut(daab), mustard oil at the bottom of the soup spoon leaving a pungent taste on tongue as after effect, but it was a lil bland in terms of flavor of the prawn, maybe a lil more spice or marination. The baked cheese crab was amazing, gooey cheesy, though crab meat was minced to very tiny pieces, flavor of the meat was in the dish, a dash of lemon highlighted the cheese. Mains we ordered murshidabad barbecue chicken and mutton stir fried with onions(suggestion of waiter). The chicken was very very soft, almost nt holding on fork, quantity of chicken was decent, the sauce was good n in abundance, pita bread had a topping was as per taste of the dish, with potato mayo salad n tomato chutney. Mutton was just fried in onions and potato, kosha types served with cold pita bread(noticed the difference becoz other pita was hot). Not happy with waiter's recommendation as there was no continental aspect in cuisine in this bengali dish. Waiter had also recommended another mutton dish whose description didnt sound a speciality of the restaurant. Dessert was malpua cheesecake, dish looked nice as the saunf pieces n wafer stick went well, cheesecake was not too sweet with a slight flavor of malpua layers in it. Overall it was good food, lovely presentation but not great quantity wise, hence pocket pinch was Rs 2500 for 2 of us, waiter did mess our mutton dish with his recommendation. We had requested the manager to click a picture, he refused politely saying he was busy and will come back but didnt, so we asked another waiter for a pic. A picture is something, that every waiter in a restaurant obliges their customer, the fact that he forgot was bad on his part, not expected from manager in yellow shirt.

Masterpiece of a restaurant, run by a well known chef!!! So I will be very critical of with my review.
Rainy after noon, lunch time and with that comes an idea - Let's have khichuri and beguni. But, I chose a different option. Somehow persuaded my family to come to this place and have lunch.
Had a belly full of lunch and burnt a huge hole in my pocket (technically speaking my brothers pocket 😜) but but, there was a big smile on each face. So let's go down to business and evaluate the dishes I had.
Starters- Daab chingri was perfectly cooked, and soft and juicy, then came mustard mutton that tasted different.
Main course - my dad's fav Jumbo chingri, as the name suggests huge size little bit on the spicier side with malai gravy. Didn't leave a drop on that place. Second came bacon wrapped chicken - it was delicately cooked which made sure the wraps didn't come off when the pieces where undergoing dissection, which was startling considering the fact that chicken wrapped inside was soft like butter.
And lastly came the panchforon parse. It was clearly an non experimental dish by the chef just give his customers an safe option incase any one looked for one (evidently my mom did). But I would be wrong if I didn't say that this was the best dish of all I had. It was a revelation to all of us how the household parse can be cooked differently w/o having to add anything out of the ordinary.
Desserts - Gondhoraaj mouse and Malpoa cheese cake. These stamped there authority. Loudly and clearly saying to all others out there - Bring it on!!!! Just try these desserts for sure. You will be amazed tooooooo.

Recommended 100%

The Chef here is an artist who paints his recipes with perfect strokes. I bet if they opened up their food in an art gallery for an exhibition and I say this in a good sense, they would stir a storm in the creative world.
A very non assuming place, that feels like a drawing room converted into a popup cafe, it has a regular chit chats of families and friends dining together. The menu is creative, with every dish and all ingredients paired and fused together to create unusual yet ingenious combinations. I pretty much wanted to eat everything out here and even though I am a gluttonous foodie, I still have my limits and pants I need to fit into, so went with the manager's recommendations this time.
Started with a Yellow Lentil soup enhanced with Radhuni (very strong spice, with a characteristic smell similar to parsley and a taste similar to celery, only available in Bengal), Coriander oil drizzle with sauteed shrimps. The soup which is textured well due to lentil in its slightly creamy consistency is outstanding with its aroma and flavors due to radhuni and shrimps. 
Ordered Pan grilled Pork Ribs with Kalojeera (Shahi zeera) and Nolen Gur (the heavenly Bengal Date jaggery) for starters. This is and absolute genius of a combination. The Nolen gur that has a strong Caramel flavour when combined with pork meat and spiked using Zeera creates this rich dark semi sweet pork ribs that I could eat day in and day out without wiping my mouth clean of its sumptuous sauce that has a perfect balance of umami, sweet and whole spices
The mains as suggested to me was another kicker of a dish; Kajoli stuffed with egg yolk mousse, stewed in aromatic orange and cumin broth. Kajoli, a freshwater sweet tasting fish available in Bengal when stuffed with a creamy egg mousse was so perfect with the orange cumin curry that i literally licked the plate clean. I was once told by a famous celebrity chef when I got a chance to cook in his kitchen during a TV show, that you can't pair seafood with orange. Incidentally, i had prepared a curry leaf infused Bombay Duck tempura with a an orange and Thai red chilly sauce and that was yummy too :) This dish not only strengthened my gut feel about food pairings but, the 'out there' attitude of the chef boldly spoke the words, "safe players, do not innovate". I live on the brink of excitement created by innovations and this place completely resonated with my philosophy for life.
As expected by now, the dessert was again, an innovative explosion of flavors with the right pairing. 'A Cigar and Coffee Mousse'; is actually a combination of post meal cigar and coffee into a mousse. Two neat quenelles of cigar coffee flavored mousse with a cloud of sugar candy floss, was literally like smoking a cigar with coffee, while listening to jazz, after a soulful meal.   
Every time I go back to Kolkata now, this place is a must for me atleast once for me to savour each and every masterpiece on that menu till the entire list is exhausted and I can start again :)

A garage fusion restaurant at its best! Right from the decor which welcomes you with a unique montage of Durga idol weaponry and bamboo, you can feel it is a place with a difference. And you are not a wee bit mistaken. The menu and the explanations are mouth-watering to the extent you crave for each one of them. So well-written striking the right chord (in your stomach :)). And the presentation of the food is chef-signature written all over. Almost all the dishes come with unheard-off fusion ideas and taste like ambrosia. Who would have thought of a combo of Shrimps in a Nolen Gur reduction gravy, chicken wrapped in bacon in an Aam kasundi gravy, firangee mutton with spinach and coconut and Gondhoraj Julep! Simply wow. Even the Daab Chingri and Mutton Chops are mouth-watering. My only rant would be the portion sizes. But then they serve quality, not quantity! Marvelous and memorable experience, this! Would surely visit again!

In a nutshell this is a quaintly set kitsch restaurant serving modern Bengali food. The menu overwhelmingly filled with unusual dishes ranging from chicken to fish to seafood and I absolutely recommend asking the waiter to help you place your order. They are extremely efficient and well versed with the dishes to know what would suit your mood. For starters we tried the Aam kashundhi soaked chicken scallops (chicken was a bit dry), topshee fritters with kalojeera and poppy seeds (fish was moist and crunchy and served with a mayonnaise dip, so do remember to ask for your kasundhi if it favors your palette), Bhetki smoked with cumin & quartered darjeeling chilli (was presented beautifully under glasses which when lifted reveal the fish under an envelope of the smoke), chilli pickle and cheese baked crab with kolmi greens (served in round mitti bowls the dish was sumptuous and heavenly and no the crab did not get lost in all that cheese and was evidently present in the flavour mix). For main we tried Green pea stuffed Bhetki sandwiches with star anise and tomatoes (dish had some gravy and the fish was cooked to perfection) served with daliya (which was so good we had to recheck with the waiter as to what it was), chicken supreme with preserved lemon and mustard (it was sooo tasty, we literally licked the dish off!) and Murshidabadi barbecued chicken with onion chutney (again the chicken wasn't too moist), a wine poached egg (sadly could not make out whether it was poached in wine or water)  and green chilli pita (clearly wasn't my favorite dish). As if we weren't stuffed enough we moved to try cigar and coffee mousse (the cigar was so modernized that we missed to spot it) and Death by chocolate for dessert. Overall the desserts we tried were forgettable but the main course left us more than satisfied to make up for it. Mind you this was my second venture with Bengali cusine and this place is definitely on my list to go back next time I visit the city to try the remaining items on their menu though it is a bit heavy on the pocket.

Having beem recommended this place by many, I visited this place, unfortunately during Durga Puja and was quite disappointed. I was longing to see the decor here, but the staff didn't let us upstairs (which was quite rude) and we had to sit in the bland ground floor area. We ordered one orange reduction based Chicken preparation as starters and were planning on having a proper meal thereafter as it was a good menu and we wanted to try out the best. Sadly enough the quantity disappointed us to no end. Whether I am paying a hefty amount or not is immaterial but we want to be served a good quantity sufficing for at least two people. The starters let us down so badly that we decided to leave. I hope to go back and expect good quantities next time around.

Highly overrated ! Could do with better service :-) However I enjoyed my crab with Kolmi greens and Malpua cheesecake. Did not go down too well with my traditional folks who only could eat the green chilly mutton dish. Recommended for Bengalis who live in Kolkata and can afford to experiment when eating out. Not for probashi Bengalis waiting for the real thing  ;-)

I think Bohemian is one of trending restaurants in Kolkata. During my puja visit, I thought to give it a try, and yes it lives up to its reputation.When we visited this place, that time puja special menu was going on where they cut down their regular menu whatever the food was good. This time, we were full of our dishes, so we could not try their dessert items. Next time, I am definitely going to try it.

The detailed review:
Location-It is situated on Bondel Road. Just opposite to the Patha Bhavan school. If you are coming from Ballygung, then you will find it on your left-hand side.
Ambiance:Pros:1.	They played a mixture of a good collection of Bengali and English songs.2.	Surrounding is well decorated and air conditioned.3.	One noticeable thing, I never see such a nicely decorated restroom in any of the restaurants. It was amazing. I would say restroom is better decorated than the service area.Cons:They do not have any negatives in ambiance. If I have to mention something, then I would say that they have two floors, but when we were there, they were only serving on the ground floor which was quite small.Rating: 5/5
Service:Pros:1.	Courteous staffs. Help you to decide what to order.2.	Always ask you about the feedbacks.3.	Dishes were nicely decorated.Cons:1.	Initial service time was a bit longer than usual which was quite reasonable while considering the fact that they serve freshly cooked food.
2.	They did not serve water in glasses.Rating: 4/5
Cost:Pros:1.	Accepts both card and cash.Cons:1.	Cost for two is almost 2200 rupees including taxes. Cost is on the higher side.Rating: 3/5
Food:We ordered Bhetki smoked with cumin & quartered Darjeeling chilli from the starters, and in the main course we ordered Bacon wrapped Chicken with Aam Kasundi reduction; Foil baked Bhetki with Baby Tumeric, Teen Phoron & coriander jus. We also tried their signature beverage Gondhoraj Julep.Gondhoraj Julep: It consisted of gondhoraj lebu (lime) and basil leaves. Nicely done. Rating: 4/5Bhetki smoked with cumin & quartered Darjeeling chilli:Pros:1.	Decoration was great. 2.	Served inside a glass such that you could feel the aroma.Cons:1.	Quantity was very less. Only six very small pieces of bhetki. One bite is enough to finish one piece of it.2.	Taste was okay, nothing great.Rating: 3/5Foil baked Bhetki with Baby Tumeric, Teen Phoron & coriander jus:They suggested us this item, but we did not like it much. Pros:1.	There were four pieces of bhetki. (piece size was average)Cons:1.	Felt the taste was very flat.2.	No taste of spices. It might be because they tried to make it like continental dishes.3.	Served with white rice and salads. They should have served it with polau or fried rice. At least, they should have provided herb rice with it. Continental dishes do not serve with white rice.
Rating: 3.5/5Bacon wrapped Chicken with Aam Kasundi reduction:This was the dish of the day. It could have been considered as one of the best dishes that I ever had. Just too good. Strongly Recommended dish.
Pros:1.	It consisted of four good pieces of chicken wrapped in bacon.2.	The curry was cooked using aam kasundi. The flavor was great.Cons:1.	It would have been better if they served it with any other rice.Rating: 5/5One good point about them was they served only mineral water and that is free of cost.Rating: 4/5Recommended dishes: Bacon wrapped Chicken with Aam Kasundi reduction; Gondhoraj Julep.[Photos are already uploaded.]

Inventive and excellent Bengali fusion cuisine. As someone not well versed in Bengali food I was initially concerned I wouldn't get the references, but I did, with vengeance. From the staters like crispy fish fritters with garlic aioli style sauce, a beautifully spiced mutton chop with tender meat sliding off the bone, and fish fillets in a lovely mustard and cheese sauce, to stewed mutton with fennel, to the mustard coconut mouse that comes semifrozen, it was all a culinary delight.

The staff are helpful and attentive and the interior of the Resturant is chic and comfortable. The extensive menu made our meal a difficult decision and coming back a must. I would recommend this place to tourists and natives alike.

There's a welcome lack of pretension here in this quaint little spot in this lazy looking lane of Old Kolkata.

I was here a few months ago, way before I started using Zomato but this was one of my favourite finds in Kolkota. A local friend took me here for lunch on a laid back sunday afternoon a few hours before my flight and she said to me that the reason she got me here last on my two day trip is that knowing me, i'd love it so much that i'd want to have every single meal there and that is exactly the sort of fellow I am. If a place really impresses me then I'd want to try out everything they make.

And that is my only regret, I won't mention what I had because it was a lot of fun going through the menu and trying to figure out what exactly it was that I wanted to try first from their drool inducing menu.

I've seen all of kolkota but I managed to explore only a portion of your restaurant and i want you guys to know that my next trip to kolkota's primary goal is going to be to eat at your joint at least a few times.

I was introduced to Bohemian quite a few years back while at The Park by a friend who is a Chef by profession.. Must confess .. Fusion food confuses me .. So went with apprehensions.. But to give Chef Joy credit.. Each and everything we tasted was divine.. Now keep going back every time am in Kolkata.. Aam kasundi prawns to prawns smoked with orange & coriander, mutton wraps, bhetki smoked with cumin & Darjeeling chilies, pan grilled pork ribs.. Braised pork cheeks.. Gondhoraj lebu souffle.. Ahhhh.. Can't get enough... Hungry already..

Been to this place a couple of times..the USP of Bohemian is that they have created  a unique cuisine born out of the fusion of bengali with continental...and they do a pretty good job of it.We had the chicken money bags as a starter which had a delightful smoky flavour followed by prawn simmered in herbs and chicken in lemon mustard as our mains.The prawns I liked and the chicken was ok . Really loved the desserts which were orange rosogulla souffle and aamarel custard with crisp fried milk.All in all a must visit for every foodie.

Overall, it's good comfort food for the Global Bengali

The name is unique.. It was a grt experience trying some dish which is experimentally made by their own cushine and the dishes r here mixed up of two different cuisine... CONTINENTAL AND BENGALI.. I think it is  very good xperiment for d bengali foodies who love d continental and bengali both very much... Their every dish is,very unique.. Well decorated... We sit on 2nd floor.. And i saw there is also a ground floor for sit... Enough space.. Ambience is cool..anyone can hangout there with family and friends.. Staffs r really very good and well behaved.. They r very much cooperating as every dish is new to me... So me and my brother ordered there  as appetizer bhetki stir fried with coriander .. Then in main course dhaniakhali prawn and mutton stirr fried with brown onions and chillies.. With that we ordered gandharaj julep and in desert i request everyone to try malpoa cheese cake... It gave me jst heavenly feelings to my tastebud... And i wanna go there again and again to taste d other dishes mustly.. Only one thing i have dissappointed that ammount is nt so much ... And the price is high.. So if u go fill ur pocket at first... Otherwise it is really an awsm place for me as well as u also i think... Thank u

Some of the dishes we liked the most :

Pleasantly surprised is how i will describe the recent experience in Bohemian.  The first thing that strikes you about this restaurant is how appropriate the name is. And being a traditionalist at heart regarding food i must say that I waited with both trepidation and bated breath (exactly how contradictory were the emotions evoked by Bohemian) for the Vodka flavored prawns and baked crab with aam kasundi. Oh my, wasn't i surprised. The amalgamation of flavors were ethereal the twang just about right thought it would have been nicer had the food been less jhaal. My wonder was carried to a level higher with the bacon wrapped chicken,  and crab with mangoes. Though they don't exactly sound right but they taste way better than right. The gondhoraaj sorbet served between the appetizers and the main course was just sublime. The end was just as fitting with their fantastic malpoa cheesecake- though i feel that the flavor of malpoa was slightly wanting. All in all i feel that Chef Joy has his palate exactly where it's needed to be and I have developed a great respect for his intuition.

When my friend and I reached this place after struggling to find it, it was almost time for end of business for them. But, they gracefully accepted our presence and served us.

So thanks a lot for that gesture of yours.

We were the only one sitting inside. It's a small place but with great soothing music on. Apt lighting and full of colours.

The food was absolute delight. One of the best i ever had. They specialize in unorthodox cuisine by giving Bengali touch to cuisine from outside India.

It has been an absolute delight to be here.

This place was pretty crowded when we went but we got our table fast enough. The speciality of this place is that they serve a perfect fusion of bengali and continental cuisine. We had ordered cheesebaked crab as starter, bacon wrapped chicken and bhekti in mango pickles in the main course and malpoya cheesecake as dessert. Each tasted divine. Gondoraj juleb is a must try beverage.
Service was decent, so was the ambiance. This place is so worth visiting.

Went here on Mahasaptami afternoon for lunch. I'd definitely recommend a reservation before going here as it was quite crowded. They had a Puja Special menu, so the dishes might have changed, but all of were delicious. The mutton was soft and succulent and the starters that we tried were all great. A wonderful mix of Eastern and Western flavours. But the thing that needs special mention is the Chicken wrapped in bacon. It was exquisite, like a bit of heaven in my mouth. Overall, while expensive, the food is well worth it and every item on the menu seems to be delicious.

We ordered Panchforon Chicken and Cheese baked crab for starters. The chicken item was good, but the crab was heavenly. The best crab item I have ever had. Period.

For main course, we ordered Bhetki with Mango Pickle and Thickened Milk, Jumbo prawns with herbs and stir-fried mutton. All the items had a unique taste which pleases the taste buds. For desserts, we had Malpua Cheese Cake which was sinfully delicious!! 

Overall, a brilliant place to try some quirky, yet extremely delicious combinations of traditional Bengali items with modern ingredients!! A lunch to remember!!

Bohemian is my all time favourite. In the era of Bengali cuisine restaurant these amazing chef Joy have guts to open something fusion. I've been fan of this place since it was open in 2012.
In panchami we went there and found my lost love and that is "Bacon wrapped chicken and Gondhoraj soufflé".

Other things people need to try-
1)Malpoya Cheese Cake on dessert
2)Panchforon bhetki for main course.

I have heard a lot about this place serving fusion bengali food and finally went to the place for Sunday dinner with high expectations and believe me I was not at all let down.

The interior reflects the cuisine in offer with framed landscapes hanging in wall. Nice ambience and bengali music.

Now coming to the food..

Checking the menu I was confused as the food combinations in offer is a complete new to me and had to fall back to Zomato reviews for their suggestions 

Starter - Vodka Soaked Prawns (this tastes delicious along with the dip) & Royal Bengal Sliced Pork Fry
Drinks - Spiced Mango Shake & Sex on the beach (both are awesome - with second one being of cranberry / pineapple flavoured)
Main Course - Crabmeat stir fried with pickled garlic (this is delicious and would try next time also) & Pork Stewed with Bagane Mashla, Fragrant Chilli and Cheese - this is also good. Both are served with steam rice.

Chef Joy Banerjee as done a fantabulous job and if you love experimenting with your taste bud this is the place to be.

The staffs are efficient, suggestive and cordial but preparation time of the food can be more paced.

Would definitely come back to this place to taste fusion bengali food and also missed their dessert this time which is in my "to have" list now :)

A twist in the tale well describes what this place has to offer! A street cafe facia and dollops of colour adorns the inside setting. vignettes of rock, punk and contemporary complete the ambience. One doesn't mind the wait (weekends get busy) as a heightened sense of anticipation keeps u occupied. As you take ur seat..Several entrees, main course and desserts, all served with a signature twist catches ur fancy. Anticipation makes way for a sense of exploration and intrigue. The dishes come nicely presented (each item of the main course is a meal by itself). The only downside to the tale is the size of the meal which i have often found slightly short of full or perhaps the mystery that precedes makes it so delectable that you are always left wanting for more....

First of all I want to congratulate Bohemian for creating such amazingly tasty dishes! I ordered for a home delivery which included dishes- cheese baked crab, sizzled bhetki and murshidabadi barbecued chicken. As soon as the food was delivered I was taken aback by their creative packaging. Kudos to that! The brown paper boxes have made their place in my room even after the food got digested! Cheese baked crab is a must must try. I felt a rush of heavenly happiness down my tummy as soon as I had a spoon of it! Other two dishes were very innovative and tasty too.
This is the 2nd time I had the pleasure of tasting their food and I could not stop myself from expressing my joy to them!

P.S. The phone number given in zomato does not work so kindly change it to the correct one!

Wow and how. I 've never come across a resto serving fusion cuisine more successfully. Chef Joy Banerjee does an amazing work with his experiments on Bengali and continental cuisine. Starting off with the soups, yellow lentil and seafood chowder with shrimp toppings were seriously great but I think they need to work on the portions served, it seemed too little. The baked crab with cheese and chilli turned out surprisingly yummy , however the chicken with Darjeeling chillies in nolen gur reduction wasn't very suited to my taste. Coming to the main course , we tried out pan shocked bhetki (pineapple and fish, lip smacking novelty!) , kancha lonka mangsho and bacon wrapped chicken. Lastly, the malpua cheesecake was nothing short of heavenly. Gondhoraj julep was also a refreshing mocktail definitely worth a try. To sum it all, this  surely was one hell of a culinary experience.

Today was my first time in Bohemian! It's something we've been planning for months but it never worked out! Finally though, we made it today and we were definitely not disappointed:)
We were three, determined foodies and we ordered plenty :
Pork spare ribs with kalojeere and nolen gur
Bacon wrapped chicken with aam kashundi reduction
Prawns with smoky orange and coriander 
Amarel custard with crispy fried milk 
Malpua cheesecake 
The pork ribs were HEAVEN and I mean it! It was so exquisite we HAD to order another plate!! It was absolutely delicious and you could taste the nolen gur which wasn't too overpowering and was just right and somehow was perfect with the pork ribs ! A definite must try!!  
Both the bacon wrapped chicken and prawns were very good ! I loved the tangy taste of the prawns ! It was  so new and refreshing ! I loved it . So was the bacon wrapped chicken. The Aam kashundi gravy was excellent and it was served with daliya pilaf which was fantastic! 
Now for the desserts. I have to admit that this is where I got a bit disappointed . The Malpua cheesecake, which was so highly recommended, was quite dry :/ either we just got a bad batch or it's really overrated .The amarel custard though, was surprisingly good! We weren't sure about it when we ordered it, but it was positively Delish! 
Now I really wanted to try the Darjeeling tea and gold flake pannacotta , so I asked if I could pack one and when they brought it over , I thought I would taste a spoonful. BUT WHAT A DISASTER. I was really, really disappointed ! The tobacco flavour was really overpowering and the tea not quite there and somehow it didn't taste right. Maybe it didn't suit my palate. 
Nevertheless, I still gave a 4.5 rating because the appetizer and the main course was completely-out-of-the-world  delicious! I'm definitely going back! 
Also, the price is definitely on the higher side , but so worth it !

I have been to this place twice and each time, just got bowled over with their creation. The contemporary touch to Bengali food is awesome. I would recommend this for people, who are open to experimentation, though everything I have tried was very good. However the malpua cheese cake according to me is overrated. Apart from that, simply loved it! Would love to go there many more times.

Visited this place today. Ambience is quite good. The waiters are very polite and helpful. For starters, we ordered dab chingri dynamite and grilled chicken wraps with nolengur and darjeeling chillis. Both are quite good. I personally liked the dab chingri. Next we ordered pachforon flavoured parshe fillets with green chilli sauce and bacon baked tilapia fillet with ginger and fennel. These are really very very good. Last but not the least malpoa cheese cake was outstanding. The price is a bit on the hiegher side,but a great great place to have fusion food and dat too bengali with continental. Well invented chef Joy Banerjee!!

The food is simply outstanding. Never before did I savour such a wonderful and exquisite combination of Bengali and western tastes. 

Bengali food with regular ingredients like panch phoron, kasundi and bay leaf never tasted as good. 

The food is experimental and hugely successful at that.

It was one of those dreary and dragging Sunday evenings at home....

It had been raining incessantly since morning and around 5 o'clock in the evening, the rains had come to a standstill.

While wondering what to do so that the weekend does not go to a waste, me, being an ardent foodie, could think of nothing else but food. The thought of satiating my tastebuds made me take a spontaneous decision to go out for dinner.

Next came the ordeal of convincing my better half. But to my pleasant surprise, he did not need much of a conviction though !

I now stay at Bosepukur, on the main road. Previously we used to stay at Palm Avenue, just back side of Broad Street and the popular restaurant named -- Bohemian was just in our neighbourhood. But while we were in that neighbourhood, we never chanced to visit that place, though I secretly longed a lot to savour its varieties. I had received rave reviews from friends and family, and felt we were the only ones missing out on it !

That fine evening came our chance ! Both of us finally decided upon hitting it at BOHEMIAN, just off Broad Street. We dialled Just Dial, the national phone helpline and got them to reserve a table for us at 9 PM.

From the moment we stepped into the restaurant, it was a great experience. The staff were very courteous, escorted us to our table and served us water immediately.

The ambience was good, quite nice and pleasant after their recent renovations and the lighting was good. Neither too harsh, nor too dim.

Then came the menu. Oh my God !! The names and the elaborate descriptions took us a while to decide. As first time visitors, we were a little confused as what to order. But there came the waiter to our rescue ! He suggested the starters, both veg and non veg for the two of us (as I am majorly a vegetarian) and also the main course.

The food was out of the ordinary !! I had never tasted things so fine in my life ! Bohemian is a place that specialises in Fusion Food (basically a mix of Bengali Cuisine and Continental Cuisine). The way the flavours and spices and sauces are blended into the food is a real art !

The items were too good : we had Corn and Spinach Wraps and Grilled Cheese Mushrooms for starters with a garlic curd dip for sauce. Then came the Vodka Soaked Prawns which were heavenly according to my husband.

For the main course, we had Baby potatoes+tomatoes in cheese mustard coriander sauce and a grilled fish with sauce. Both were served with a mint salad and a portion of puffed rice with garlic (for the first option) and another portion of something like Jeera rice (for the grilled fish).

The foods were heavenly. The blends and mixes of the fusion spices and sauces with the main items was just extra ordinary !

Lastly, to end the dinner and tantalise our sweet buds a bit, we took : Aam Custard (Mango pudding with Ginger flavour) and Gondhoraaj Pie (a dessert / pie with the Bengal famous Gondhoraj Lemon flavour).

Oh....what an end to our lovely dinner as well as a not-so-happening weekend !

I would suggest everyone whoever would like to try out new and exciting flavours, to visit Bohemian atleast once !According to me, it is one of the best rated restaurants in Kolkata !

Tasty experimental junction.First we ordered Seafood soup.The tiny soup quantity tempted me to laugh out loud.Never had I seen such a cute small bowl.I guess one drinks more tea than that..Lol.

Anyways the soup filled with crab meat and shrimps was new nd good for the tongue.Then came Murshidabadi BRBQ Chicken.The platter had a huge chickn chunk soaked in a lovely sause.The pita with mustard was mindblowing.The "alu chokka" and "aam achar" didnt taste out of place and complimented the dish.Then Kacha Lanka Mutton was simple,homely nd tasty.

The prices may be on the higher side nd they may force you to buy water for youself but the food is authentic..very new nd very satisfactory.

Have been here multiple times as the food used to be awesome but my recent visit has been very disappointing! 
Service has degraded as you have to wait for at least 20-30 mins for any dish. Price  wise it seems quite steep too.
Now coming to the main part - food taste and quality has not been up to the mark at all, especially for the price you pay. We ordered a couple of mutton dishes and a fish starter, the pieces were not good, nor was the taste. It was just okay but the price you pay makes you feel really bad about your decision to eat here.
Don't want to come to a conclusion with this as they used to be very good and different, so hope to give it a try again in the future!!

Right from the word goes..... BOHEMIAN is indeed one revolution of infinite proportion, place where food does cabaret on your senses & you're left puzzled with its uncanny way of tweaking traditional Bengali delicacies...... look at few of its legendary offerings
Vodka soaked prawns ( I mean really.....anybody does that???)
Dab chingri dynamites
Cottage cheese nuggets with aam Kasundi
Garlic coriander keema wrap
Royal Bengal roast mutton with bhuna sauce Grilled bhetki with Radhuni induced curry sauce
Pork with baby turmeric in banana leaf  
Malpua cheese cake
Gondoraj soufflé
Death by chocolate 

Well, this list may still go on & I'm sure none will contradict if I term each one of them as divine.
To keep it short & simple Bohemian has enough to make your taste buds go bonkers, I guess even 5 stars are less to rate this unique joint.

👍👍highly recommended

If I say Superb it would be the understatement of the year. What a fusion of tastes. 
Heard a lot of good reciews about this place and finally decided to make the dash. For starters we took DAB chingri dynamite and Baby Potatoes in panchforon oil. Both were exquisite esp the Dab Chingri dynamite. The blend of taste was just too much for starters and left me longing for more. For main dish Sizzled Bhetki platter was also up to the mark. The quality and size of the bhetki fillet was too good. 
Too many menu items for me to try next time for sure. Just one thing.. Its a bit on the expensive side esp the starter items... 
One of the best dinner I had in a Kolkata restaurant for a long long time...

I have encountered this place quite a number of times before I actually attempted entry (but could not, as it had still not opened for the day) and before I actually entered, at about 10:50 pm on a Sunday night.

I started questioning my decision the moment I opened the menu card. With only a few things on the list that I could comprehend, I did not know what to eat or where to go. I took the opportunity of it being a rainy (and a relatively cool) day to order some soup - "The Yellow Lentil soup enhanced with radhuni, garlic and coriander oil drizzle". It also gave us some time to go through all those seemingly challenging items and decide on the main course.

And just as I took the first sip of my soup in that lil bowl, it just blew my mind...I had never tasted something so amazingly beautiful ! And thereafter, came "Chicken and Red Seasonal Leaves in pickeled garlic envelopes - served with steamed rice and potato mustard salad" and "Jumbo Prawns stewed with field grown herbs" and we totally lost it. I cant even begin to write how unique and beautiful the taste was. Yes, I call it 'beautiful'!! And just about the time we have had a meal that was fulfilling both to the stomach and the soul and were about to ask for some desserts, they had stopped taking orders :(

Even when I think of that meal today, it leaves me wondering as too how perfect it was!

After hearing a lot about this new place finally managed to check it out for a weekend dinner. The first page of the menu conveys the genre of the restaurant as it clearly lives upto its name by offering a spread of dishes uniquely combined,flavoured,brewed and presented. 
The starters clearly stand out, specially the vodka prawn. The pork preparations are oily nd not for the faint hearted. The main course though creatively combined and authentically presented by the chefs could have been more flavourful. What really appealed to me was the thought of mixing these unique dishes and presenting a fine blend of culinary preparations made from the everyday items of Bengal kitchen. 
The only downside as per me was the price. Compared to the restaurant ambience and quality of food, I think it is a little steeply priced. If you wish to reach out to the larger mass with your innovation, the offering should be for all. The price really doesn't justify that. Overall good food exorbitantly priced...

Finally, a restaurant that explores the flexibility of Bengali cooking.  Bengali cooking is at least as complex as French cooking and until eating at the Bohemian, I had resolved to believing that no such place exists that truly taps into this cuisine's full potential.  Thanks for the great food and service; we'll be back.

This place took me by surprise..we were probably the last customers..entering at 10.15 pm but I was glad that there was no sign of inconvenience for the waiters there..since they stayed there serving us right upto 11.30pm with always a smile on their face. Our waiter even offered some small chat and tit bits about the history of the restaurant and the dishes..it didn't even seem that it was so late in the night..I really appreciate their hospitality for this very reason..
Anyway coming to the food..the menu was one of a kind..and I bet the idea of this sort of food and the creativity behind it can be developed and mastered by only an expert. The menu was a brilliant fusion of bengali and western cuisine and no one can have enough of it by one visit..
We ordered vodka soaked prawns and aam kashundi chicken for starters..for main course we ordered murshidabadi barbequed chicken that came with pita bread and salad, bacon wrapped chicken in aam kashundi reduction teamed with daliya pilaf, pabda rolls stuffed with long beans with shorshe batar jhol and bori n rice pilaf along with it..and for dessert we ordered aam flavoured caramel custard and maalpoa cheesecake..
The first thing that came to my mind after eating was "ELABORATE" and surprisingly none of the dishes got screwed up due to the detailed ingredients and preparation..all of it was just right..no dish seemed over the top and no taste seemed out of place..we just sat back and let the dishes surprise us one by one..they did too..and how..
Will surely visit again for more..cheers!!

Bacon wrapped chicken with aam kashundi reduction is one of my favorite dishes. A peaceful environment, nicely done interiors, food with a twist, and tummy-filling place. It is known for its twist that it brings in bengali food.

I have been to Bohemian for a long time and last I visited I found out that they have an updated menu with lots of new items.

My foodaholic cousin and I made our way to this restraurant and ordered a starter dish of grilled chicken wraps in nolen gur reduction with darjeling chillies. I don't recollect this dish being in the old menu and boy - what a dish it was ! just about when I was about to discard it as a boring dish when it came wrapped in an insipid aluminium foil, the softness of the chicken fillet and the sweetness of the nolen guur hits the tongue with a subtle ending of spice of the chillies. The taste is so unique that it takes an effort to even remember this extraordinary taste.

our main courses were - panch foron flavured parshe fish in smoked green chilli sauce and bacon wrapped chicken in aam kasundi reduction. both were old items and great. the sauces are cream based and very subtle.

another star of the evening was the gandhoraj sorbet which is very refreshing pallete cleanser and excellent to taste. it is very important to order at least one pallete cleanser to maximise full appreciation of the subtleties in each dish.

finally we ordered a coconut and mustard mouse which I liked and my cousin didn't.

my biggest problem was that service was very slow and it took nearly 45 minutes for the starter to arrive. then again we wanted to try out the toffee rasogolla with green chilli sobayon which sounded very enticing but by the time we placed order for the dessert mind-way through our main course we were informed that the waiting time for the dish is 45 minutes. in case there are dessert dishes which require long prep time, the menu should indicate it very clearly. 

Overall, one should remember that Bohemian is a serious, serious food RnD laboratory and if you dont have subtle tastes, dont visit here. Chef Joy is the master sorcerer doing some extraordinary experiments with food here, and one should just keep visiting so that he can get more tricks out of his magic kitchen.

I have bookmarked this restaurant since I first had their offerings. The place lives up to its name and justifies it by making such unique dishes. Almost every item is exquisite and has their signature style. Be it from Topshe fritter with kalojeera and poppy seeds to kancha lonka mangsho, the place offers a great variety of Bengali dishes which are cooked differently. To be precise, its a designer restaurant. A small yet beautiful place with fusion Bengali food. The decor is soothing and the photographs on the wall make it even better. Its a bit expensive though but after having the items one cannot really complain. It would be unfair if anyone leaves without having the gondhoraj julep.

Seafood looked good, but being a veg didnt try any of that.
The veg food is also amazing, with different spices from around the country has a very different taste.
If your in the mood to try something different , go down to Bohemian.

Yesterday our family decided to go for lunch and as usual, we wanted to try out a new place. My dad wanted to go to a bengali joint whereas the rest of us wanted to try something new and not the typical bengali food. And thus, Bohemian.
Located at old ballygunge, a minute away from Patha Bhawan school, Bohemian is a not too small and yet cozy joint which has a very durga puja feel to the decor. The restaurant run by the celebrated chef, Joy Banerjee, serves not authentic bengali food but bengali fusion or designer bengali food.
The entrance is beautifully done and you feel like you're entering a pujo pandal. The interior of the restaurant is simple.
We were given the menu which has a great variety bengali dishes, however, cooked differently. We placed our order which took about 20-25 minutes to be served.
Coming to the food, it was brilliantly cooked and very presentable. We'd ordered crab and mutton for appetisers, both which were amazing !
For the main course we'd ordered bhetki fish, Prawns and mutton. Other than the delayed service, the food had no flaws. Everything was cooked to perfection and the use of all spices and herbs were brilliantly done.
We'd ordered death by chocolate for desert which was highly presentable and tasted really good however i felt that it was too sweet.
For the 6 of us the meal costed us 6.5k which is slightly towards the higher side but for the quality, taste and uniqueness of the food it was totally worth it.
If you want to try bengali food with a difference and happen to like continental food as well, then you're totally gonna love this place !
The 0.5 deduction would be for the delayed service and ordinary interior for the pocket pinch.
On the whole, it was an amazing experience and I personally loved Bohemian :)

P.S I completely forgot to take photos of the other dishes since I was too busy enjoying the food so I'm very sorry :(

The worst kind of dining experience. The 1.5 is just for the desserts, which is really awesome. But then I wont visit a restaurant twice if they only serve WoW desserts and fusion food that is neither tasty, nor edible. I felt like vomiting when I tried out their crab. Same with the other dishes. The basic idea of good food is one which will keep you hungry till you burst.
And the have a very slow response time.
So if you are hungry, dont visit this restaurant. Or if you accidentally did, please let your soul relax by feeding it "death by chocolate" or "cheesecake malpua".

Its a food boutique. Every dish is designed uniquely and served in the most palatable mannner. The creations are very different from any other restaurant and one needs to be there to understand what I am saying. The decor again is "Bohemian", just like the name suggests and the background music that is played is emancipative. I tried out their signature starters, that is the bhetki smoked with cumin and quatered darjeeling chilli and the chilli pickle n cheese baked crab with kolmi greens. The first one is a fish dish with a very subtle smoky flavour and the meat was tender and firm at the same time. While the second was like a mousse with crab meat and fair amount of cheese and kolmi shaag. We ordered gondhoraj julep. A drink somewhat like fresh lime soda, with the lingering flavour that the gondhoraj gives out. Again, an amazing choice. For main course I had sizzled bhetki simmered with pickled garlic and the kacha lonka mangsho. The dishes had a signature taste which you can only know if you eat it yourself. The prices are on the higher side but what to expect if the food is designed separately. All over a good experience.:-)

Honestly I have not heard of this place.. So when my date recommended me to take me there, with little apprehension I agreed to visit there and trusted him.. And the moment I turned back towards bondel gate, I knew it would not disappoint me since its just opposite to me school, so this area is very close to my heart.. So, coming to the decor, I simply loved their entrance, it was a serene Sunday afternoon and the very sight of the entrance bowled me.. Next for appetizer we ordered grilled chicken with nolen gur and Darjeeling chillies.. Little did I thought something delicious can be made out of chicken with something so sweet like nolen gur, and the blending of spices with sweet tasted amazing.. Next we tried their murshidabadi barbeque chicken, with aam kasundi flavour, served with wine poached eggs and pita breads.. Another absolutely unusual dish, and the combination of aam kasundi with pita breads, with shredded chicken tasted delicious.. Later on we tried their mutton with dumpling stews cooked with gondhoraj leaves.. And it looked too less spicy and initially I got a little disappointed Bt the first sip to the stew and I went Wow! Served with green salad and steamed rice.. I bet I can eat that every single day.. Mutton was well cooked..
Overall its an amazing place with beautiful decor and ambience.. Hope to visit soon to try their rest of the innovative dishes.. Kudos to the team coming out with such ideas..

I'm not from kolkata, but of course being a bengali, I have a lot of relatives here!My cousin is a big foodie (just like me :D ) and she made a list of places that needed my visit! Unfortunately, because of the limited number of days I could only visit a few of them, and this place was one of them.

I'm in love with this place. Their food is so amazing, it rendered me completely speechless. So much finesse, so much technique! Ooohlalaaaa :') Kisses to the chef. 

Starters : Grilled Chicken Wraps with nolen gur and darjeeling chilies.
Honestly, you wouldn't even feel this is chicken, it plays with your tongue so well, you'll be deep into fantasy land by the time you finish it and would definitely want more of it. Nolen gur is something i've only had roshogullas of! That in chicken plus the perfectly balanced hotness given by the chilies.. Sweet baby jesus :P

Palate Cleansers : Gondhoraj sorbet. DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE. I love this type of lemon which is a part of every bengali household. The sorbet was beautifully made and had the perfect amount of gondhoraj in it which made it sublime! I had two of these! :P

Main course : 
1. Panchphoron infused parshe fillet with smoked green chili sauce.
   This was served with some rice and a salad. The fillet was soft and the panchphoron taste hits you right after you swallow. Yet again, uniquely made dish.
2. Bacon wrapped chicken in an aam kasundi reduction I loved this! I'd never had bacon before and neither had i had kasundi. It was amazing! Wont forget the taste ever!

Dessert : Mustard and Tender Coconut Mousse. This was nice, but i didn't fancy it so much.
All in all, what a beautiful experience! I'll definitely come to kolkata again just to visit this place atleast! :)

Food Taste: 15/10
 (No... I don't suck at Maths)

Value for Money: 9/10

Ambiance: 9/10

Variety: 10/10

Every preparation here is tuned to perfection to tickle the taste buds of even the most hard to please foodies. Be it the continental dishes with a "bangali" touch, or the unheard of desserts that don't exist anywhere else. If you try it once, you *will* come back for more.

It doesn't matter what you order, you'll invariably be more than satisfied. From the Mutton stir fried with Browned Onions, to the Pork Vindaloo or the Stir Fried Crab Meat with Pickled Garlic... it's impossible not to fall in love with food if you're eating here.

Again a special mention to the supremely unorthodox dessert section, particularly to the Malpua Cheesecake... for simply coming into existence to please our palates.
I realize that this review turned out to sound like a sponsored Advert... but I'll have to stand by what I've tasted. Hat's off to the chef, Joy, for giving the city a masterclass on truly fine dining.

Great Bengali fusion with continental dishes. If the chef is listening then we would like a platter of starters on the menu so that we can try more of the dishes. Ordered the stuffed mushrooms, chicken filled with something with mustard sauce  - just 5 protions btw for 499 ish !! :(  , gondhoraj lemonade - which was nice, and another vegetarian main. billed 2100 which i felt was steep

They tried really hard for a master chef style presentation but their dishes really let them down. Also i felt that the waiters were not so aware about the food on the menu - they tried really hard but fell short. Portion sizes were small for the kind of money they charged. Its too brightly colored for my liking but the colorful interiors were somehow going well together

Very average experience. The only reason i would go back is because im bored of the other conventional places in the city - in hope that i hit jackpot with some new fusion stuff that they do

Sober ambience. Food was quite yummy. Liked the blend of cuisines. Please try cheese baked crab anytime you go there. It's awesome. I went by zomato's recommendation and ordered malpoa cheese cake for dessert, but it was a disappointment.  I found the place little over priced going by the quantity. Overall a nice place if you want to try out some new flavors of bengali preparations.

One might not feel they serve the greatest food but its different for sure. True fusion...a curious blend just like proclaimed by the place. 
I tried the bacon wrapped chicken which was awesome, pork was good too...the prawns with smoky orange were a bit too orangy for my taste but thats just personal opinion, you might wanna try it if it works for you. The malpua cheesecake for dessert was not as great as i expected but if u have a sweet tooth u wont complain.
Ambience is very nice, suave kinda people all around. Only drawback would be the portions were slightly smaller. 
Definitely a place to check out. If u have a little idea about bengali cuisine, u might appreciate the food even more.

Food wise brilliant no doubt about it. Truly fusion food taken to a whole different level. I just went with my mom and wife last week. Everyone liked all the preparations. Presentation wise is excellent too. Now coming to the not so good part. The restaurant is very small cramped up for room. Waiters were somehow very serious type. Price wise cannot be justified at all with the portions they serve. So if they work on the price part or increase the portions and have the waiters a bit more friendly I will surely rate it 4.5 any day.

Went there for dinner yesterday with family, as we had a movie to catch after that, we were in a hurry, thus the promise of the waiter to serve in 20-25 minutes really disappointed us. But to our delight, food was served much before that. After tasting the starters, i.e. the corn and spinach wrap, the pumpkin soup and the mutton chop, my husband commented that the food was wroth missing the movie for. Its the most innovative style of cooking we have ever tasted in kolkata, served in the most bengali way ! The fusion actually existed in the food and we had a gala time. Our main course was steamed bhetki with rice,  baby potatoes and cherry tomatoes in mustard gravy followed by some desserts. The only thing that did not click was lil bit of hospitality which was missing in the person who took our order, and guava dessert. otherwise its a very cosy place to be in :)

A new age restaurant serving fusion food. They take some usual ingredients of Bengali cuisine and add an European twist to them and present them in an European style. The result being dishes with unique flavours  which you won't find anywhere else. Yes, not all the experiments can be regarded as a success (although most definitely are), yes the portions seem small and in many cases the dishes seem way overpriced, but I highly appreciate the effort to create something new and hope that more restaurants follow in its footsteps. Those who are 'gastronomically adventurous', should pay this restaurant a visit.

Okay...... here it is today's (4th June 2017) review.... Seems you cannot have multiple reviews of the same restaurant. It was a "school friends eating out", with an NRI and an NRI, and we pigged to our heart's content!! Tried the Grilled Chicken wraps in nolen gur and Darjeeling chillies (with a subtle sweet flavour), sliced pork and baby turmeric in banana leaf envelopes (trifle disappointing since the turmeric overpowered the pork in flavour), Murshidabad Barbecue chicken (superbly cheesy) and chicken breasts stuffed with kolmi greens and simmered in cheese (complete extravaganza in taste). But the hero hasn't changed - it remains unchanged for me - chilli pickle n cheese baked crab with kolmi greens AND green mango and green chilli sorbet!!!! Boy.... I could doff my hat at these two!!!
–––––––––––––

Chef Joy, any idea what joy you've brought into the lives of the likes of us foodies? The crab & kolmi shaak starter is synonymous with Bohemian, and it is a sad day when that is not available 😞. Yet to try the new menu though

Bohemian was revelation in terms of fusion Bengali cuisine. Their innovative take on Bengali flavours were amazing and had extremely delicious results. Smoked vetki and chicken wraps in nolen gur were very unique and tasty. The pabda rolls were awesome. Smoky chicken with orange was OK and not too great compared to the other dishes. However the pantua baked Alaska was not at all upto the mark. It is a small place, so it is advisable to visit in small group.

Being a bengali nd based in kolkata with family, i have tasted the bengali spices, recipes, ingredients a zillions of times now. 
So seldom i try bengali food in a restaurant as i don't wanna repeat the same food that we eat everyday at home.

But when i saw Bohemian's menu spread on zomato, it sounded familiar but not similar..
So obviously i had to try to find out wether it was only fancy names or was its something more than that!!
Well i must say that I am glad i visited this place..
The place is really small, hardly 5-6 tables as far i can remember & nothing too fancy. They serve quintessential bengali foods with a continental twist.
We ordered:

1. Chilli pickle & cheese baked crab: oh it was extremely different from what i expected, it came in earthen bowls nd tasted really good & different. 

2. Grilled chicken wraps with nolen gur & darjeeling chillies: it was awesome. Had a distinct smokey flavour from the chillies & the gur caramelisation was really going well with the smokey flavour.. MUST TRY..

3. Panchphoron flavoured parshe fillets: we were a really reluctant in ordering "Parshe maach" as we didnt want to end up eating a boring bengali fish preparation. But the attendant insisted that we should try & I am glad we listened to him.. I never expected the same Parshe mach can end up making such a delicious dish & something so not-bengali in any way!!!!!
 
4. Mutton stir fried with browned onion with pita bread: it was good but it was like having usual mutton do pyaza with tandoori roti. Anyways it was tasty atleast, so no complaints.. Wish i had tried something different instead.. :/

5. Malpua Cheesecake: but it was already over. I guess i will have to visit again only for this particular item.. The name sounds so awesome, i wonder how awesome it will taste in reality!!!!!!  :(

Hope you enjoy the food even more!!!

This is hands down one of the best fusion-food restaurants I have been to! joyous Mutton chops and bacon wrapped chicken are my personal favorites! have been to this place a couple of years back...and they have added a lot more to their offerings which I am yet to try out...but the malpoa cheesecake is a clear winner!! would love to try out the other desserts they serve!! definitely a must-visit for food-venturous people who love to experiment with their taste buds!! :)

Most innovative bengali cuisine ever. We went there with 8 family members and all from various age group. Every body said in one tune " never tasted bengali cuisine in this unique and vivid way".  Hats off to the chefs. Must try dishes - crab meat in starters , and all fish items mainly. For a experience do try the gold flake panacotta. Will definitely go there next time I am in Kolkata.

Based on home delivery
Ordered online through zomato for two. Food reached our house within 50mins. What bothered me the most was that they took a service charge and a delivery charge(50) and of course the VAT. However i do have to mention there packing was splendid.
Coming to the food
From the appetizers the stir fried mutton with mustard and coriander (chef joy's special) was quite yummy.
For the main, the kacha lonkar mangsho was tasty but however was not anything different . But the Sizzled Bhetki simmered with pickled garlic was creamy and the winner. A must try for sure.
Overall, the food was great and the zomato online order feature (which i tried out for the 1st time) works great.

When you are so pleased you cannot actually start with the location .

Bohemein , a Bengali - Continental fusion restaurant , is one of the best places I had been here at Kolkata till date . It houses itself diagonally opposite Patha Bhavan Junior School at Ballygunge .

As soon as I entered , the smell , decor and ambience took me away . The hospitality was too good .

Get the menu card , and read "the second coming " by the Chef . They have changed a few of their dishes in the new menu . Now , the food , how can it be gar behind :

1. Gondhoraj Jelup : A little salty , with lime & coriander , well-known beverage . (4 / 5)

2.Mint Tulep : a bit sweet , with pudina leaves , another well-known beverage . (5 / 5)

3.Aam khasundi chicken escallops : big chicken slices with a perfect blend of aam khasundi .(5 / 5)

4.Kajoli Orange : A bit tangy , but good . (3 / 5)
5.Murshidabadi Barbeque Chicken : Just awesome , the sauce that was used to marinate the chicken slices , is beyond words , along with the chutney . (5 / 5)

6.Malpua Cheesecake : a recommended desert , and is truely awesome . (5 / 5)

7. Death by Chocolate : if you are a dark chocolate lover , this will kill you *_* its beyond words . A must try ... (5 / 5)

We could not try any more seafood , but looking forward to do so very soon .

If you love continental , then Bohemein is a must try for you . Hats off to the chef for blending Bengali cuisine with continental .

The pocket pinch for every dish you order is high , but your taste buds will be satisfied at the end .

The bathroom was too cool , you can find some wall paintings inside posted :P

They give coupons for your next dine at Bohemein too .

Awesome experience.... That is all I can say about a scrumptious lunch on a rainy day at Bohemian!!! The small joint I had last visited a couple of years ago... Has not changed much save the upper level seating arrangements. The lunch started with a seafood chowder with coconut milk... The most wholesome and amazingly tasty and delicate soup I have tasted. The food extravaganza started with pan grilled pork spare ribs with nolen gur and cumin, honestly it didn't marry well and was too sweet for my palate. And stir fired Mutton with mustard... Simply awesome.... Couldn't get enough of it!!! The main course consisted with kancha lanka mangsho a riot of flavour served with plain rice and salad a little too seasoned perhaps... But delicious.... And pork vindaloo... The best of its kind that I have tasted in a long time!!! Death by chocolate was decadent and delicious, and Darjeeling tea and gold leaf panna cotta, again... I tasted a perfect panna cotta with the delicate taste of Darjeeling tea hitting high notes on the palate with a delicate and not over powering caramel sauce. We died and went to heaven... They were almost orgasmic!!! ;) These amazing delicacies were washed down with Gondhoraj Julep... And Mint Julep... I favour the latter... With a zing of ginger ale!!!!
Bohemian is rather pinchy on the pocket... But sure worth it..

Last night we had  some excellent food home delivered from Bohemian.This is the first time I have tasted Bohemian dishes though heard a lot about it before. Let me start with the packaging and delivery. The packaging was absolutely artistic and professional with cardboard boxes and wooden spoons and knives, the finer touch which really impressed me was the actual course Sea Salt.

I wouldn't comment on individual dishes, which are superlative, as thousands of people had already done that. I was amazed how Bengali food can be fusioned
for cosmopolitan palette. I would love to visit the restaurant in future.

I have been avoiding writing this review for a few years now. The only reviews I ever write are for places I absolutely love (or atleast like) because there really is no joy in bad-mouthing anyone. I'm writing this review today because I feel it's a complete and utter shame that a place where I enjoyed the food so much, disappointed me so deeply that I have never wanted to go back. 

I visited Bohemian a few years ago with my sisters when I was visiting Calcutta. Everybody was raving about the food and insisted that I try it out. I knew that they had a few vegetarian options but I'm vegan (which means that I don't eat, drink or wear anything that is taken from an animal), so I had some concerns about whether they would be able to accommodate my needs or not. 

We landed up at Bohemian, a group of six happy girls and after inquiring with the chef, our server came and told me that they will be able to make something without any animal-derived ingredients for me. How wonderful! 

Soon the food arrived and to my surprise, I received a lovely platter of multiple food choices that not only looked great but were absolutely delicious. Fusion bengali food at its finest, plus cruelty free - what's not to love? We sealed the glorious lunch with a fabulous Gondhoraj sorbet. I was literally high with joy (no pun intended). 

When we were finishing off with payment, the chef came out to speak to us. Everyone thanked him for the meal. I told him that the vegan dishes were phenomenal and that it was so wonderful that he could accommodate my needs... And then he said, "You're the one who wanted vegan food? Humans are supposed to eat animals. We have done that since ancient times, that is why we have canine teeth." 

I was too shocked to respond. My sister, who wasn't vegan, retaliated and told him how completely outdated and ignorant that justification was. He didn't particular seem to want to listen to logic, he simply blurted his views (while insulting mine) and left. 

Let me shed some light on a few things: 

1. A meal that does not include the flesh (what we call "meat") of chickens, pigs, cows or fish and does not use the milk of lactating animals for cream, yogurt, cheese or butter is: 

a) Cheaper (and more profitable) for any business to produce - Plants are cheaper to buy, use less electricity to store, use less gas to cook and the meal is clearly more profitable since I, as a consumer, still paid the same amount I would have for a vegetarian or maybe even an animal meal. 

b) Healthier/safer for people to consume - Plant-based meals have no dietary cholesterol AT ALL and have a host of health-boosting benefits while still giving us all the good protein, calcium, anti-oxidants, vitamins and minerals that we need. 

c) Better for the environment - Animal agriculture is the leading cause of global warming, deforestation, water depletion, species extinction, ocean dead zones and contributes to more green house gas emissions than the entire global transportation sector combined. 

d) Better for our conscience & the animals - I'll let you soul-search for the explanation to this one. 

Therefore, by giving me a vegan meal, they were actually contributing to something GOOD.

2. I did not walk in there and give them a lecture about the choices they were making as a business that is responsible for what people put in their bodies. I didn't judge them. I did not go to their business and tell them that they were damaging their health, their client's health, destroying the environment and contributing to very serious and morally inappropriate exploitation of innocent, voiceless species by serving the food they serve. Instead, I was gracious, polite and not just appreciative but in awe of the food they cooked for me. If they did not want to serve me vegan options, they should have refused my request. I would have been happy to go elsewhere. 

I write this review today because it is a real, real shame that the place where I had the best vegan food in India, is so narrow-minded and 'stuck' in primitive beliefs that it makes its clients feel unwelcome. 

My note to the Chef: There is no doubt in my mind that you are a very gifted cook. I really hope that you will take the time to inform yourself about global food and health developments. One cannot be a part of the food industry and live with blinkers on. One cannot live with blinkers on no matter what. On your website, you call yourself a free thinker, a nonconformist, radical, maverick, avant garde & slightly eccentric. I do hope you will live up to those words. I do hope that some day, you will be one of the many restaurants in India that has a separate vegan menu. I will be thrilled to visit you that day. I am sharing a few sources with you below, please check them out if you are interested. If not, thank you for a meal that I will always remember for mixed reasons. I wish you the best.

The food was beyond best. So impressed with the food, flavours, quality and the innovative touch and blend of flavours. We took a home delivery and the service was also impressive. Loved the packing, neat presentation with wooden spoons and all. That was the first thing the made the notice that it was a sign of a great restaurant. Secondly each dish was remarkably unique and innovative. 
Orders 3 main dishes. Kacha lonka mutton had an amazing blend of multiple flavours and the mutton was excellently marinated and had a grilled touch to it(my intuition that was). The second dish ordered was Chicken flavoured with lemon and mustard. It had a very tangy and a mild spicy touch to it. The meat was also perfectly cooked, tender but not overcooked. The rice was steamed and very well blended with the dish. The third dish was chicken rapped with bacon. This was my favourite. In was a bit spicy but not the type to make your mouth burn. The perfect kind of spicy which took the platter to the next level. I loved how the rice dish that was with the bacon chicken was so well prepared, l have never tried something so delicious before. 
The food of this restaurant completely stole my heart. Beyond expectation and eagerly hoping to meet the chef soon as l have to complement him on his enormous innovative skills. I am impressed.

I have to rate this place 5/5. It deserves full marks in every department including hospitality, service and ofcourse FOOD. It serves fusion food of mainly experimenting combinations of bengali and continental or world cuisine. Food here is unique and you wont get it anywhere else. We tried Steamed Bhetki fish with pickled cheese and garlic,Chicken Escallops with aam kasundi ,Baby potatoes with panchphoran oil and cheese spinach and corn in starters. In the main course we opted for Shocked Bhetki with wood smoked pineapple,Crabmeat and Prawn dumplings,Prawn with gondhoraj lebu and yoghurt and Chicken in smoked orange. Every dish I mentioned above tasted just too good. No flaws whatsoever. In desserts the Malpua cheesecake and Aam custard where delicious. This surely tops my list of the best restaurants I have been to in Kolkata till date. Must must visit this.

A long time dream came true today. A visit to this place was on the cards for long. Truly a Bengali taste with a twist. Tucked away In one of those streets, this little one is a gem. Right from the entrance you feel the warmth. A little wait inside with the postcards and framed pictures to give you company. While waiting, you could place the order too. We ordered the baked crab with kolmi greens and joyous mutton chops for appetizers. The mutton chops is undoubtedly the source of all your joy! The crab tastes so uniquely different but it is a bit higher on the salt scale. We ordered a gondhoraj sorbet to clean our palette. Such a good fusion with the delicate gondhoraj flavor enticing you to eat more than you intended to. For main, we ordered the prawn in tamarind and peanut sauce. This is medium spicy. My pick is however the sizzled bhetki with celery rice. The kolmi sides were a strange blend of kolmi bori and some herbs. Finish it off with a malpua cheesecake with mild sweet and malpua layering to melt in your mouth. Overheard from the next table and personal experience says it is even better than the traditional Bengali restaurants. Definitely worth a try if you are in Kolkata!

A Bengali house converted into a restaurant, this place has decent ambience.  The food was amazing. It was all the chef's creation of Italian, Thai with bengali stuffings and flavours. The blend of international cuisines with that of bengali is absolutely mesmerizing. On the negative side, the waiter who came to serve us at first was rude signifying that he was untrained. On our request, another waiter came to serve us who was courteous and his suggestions were also really nice!

Well, Bohemian was due for a long time.. In fact, their menu has been revamped over the course of the time that I was planning to visit here.. Finally the chance came, when one of my aunts decided to give a treat..

First of all, the decor was nice and simple, beautiful card hanging at a side will immediately catch your eye once you walk inside. The music playing was pretty good too..

The staff was extremely courteous and helped us choose the dishes for quite a long time..

First of all, coming to the food.. There is almost no need to say "this" is their signature dish, because almost all of their preparations are unique and its very unlikely you will get them anywhere else..

Our order was huge,

Lentil soup, with shrimp x 1

Lentil soup, with chicken x 1

Joyous Mutton Chop x 2

Gondhoraj Julep x 2

Murshidabadi BBQ Chicken x 1

Bacon Wrapped Chicken x 1

Mutton Stir Fried with Browned Onion and sliced Chillies x 1

Sliced Pork in Banana Leaf Envelope x 1

Chicken Supreme with Preserved Lemon & Mustard x 1

Malpua Cheesecake x 1

Pantua Baked Alaska x 1

Gondhoraj Lemon Pie x 1

Death By Chocolate x 1

:P

The lentil soup was pretty nice, I liked it, but since I am not a big fan of soups, just tasted some.. The Gondhoraj Julep was excellent, generous amounts of coriander and gondhoraj lemons made it one of my favorite mocktails ever..

The main appetizer, the Joyous Mutton Chops- and Oh! what joy it gave us to devour them, from bone to bone. It was tantalizingly delicious, and undoubtedly, the best mutton starters I have had..

Coming to the main courses, the Murshidabadi BBQ chicken was excellent, chunks of chicken served with Pita bread, and an onion chutney, which personally, I did not like but mom and my aunt both liked..

My bacon wrapped chicken was by far the best main course dish that we had.. Large pieces of chicken, wrapped in bacon, served with rice, was simply awesome.. Must try for everyone..

The Mutton with Browned Onions was good, served again with pita (different flavor), and had 6-7 healthy pieces of meat. Overall, the preparation was good, tasted better because of the bread..

The Chicken supreme in Lemon and Mustard was pretty ordinary.. In simple terms, it was just a Bengali chicken curry with "Shorshe jhol".. It was served with rice and didn't quite like it..

The pork envelope was also quite average.. It came like a "Paturi", enveloped in banana leaf and we were pretty excited by it.. Even though the pork was cooked to perfection, and melted in our mouth, the spices was average and tasted like a normal Bengali curry..

After hogging down all the meat, we were pretty full, but were still greedy enough to taste the desserts..

The famous Malpua Cheesecake was brilliant, but so was the Gondhoraj Lemon Pie, which I liked very much, even more than their acclaimed cheesecake.. The baked alaska was good once again, with small pantua inside the mound of dessert.. Again, was excellent.. Now, being a chocolate lover, I was completely blown away by Death by Chocolate. Two scoops of Chocolate ice cream, choco syrup, hot chocolate, everything chocolate oozes out from every bite you have..

The pocket pinch is quite high, and it would leave a considerable hole in your wallet, and also the taxes were quite high.. Our entire meal cost around 1.5k per head, so I should warn everyone who are coming here.. The taxes are high, and be careful when you visit..

Other than this, Bohemian my recommended place to visit if you are a foodie adventurer like me and want to try something unique..

Bohemian has been making quite waves in south kolkata so my family decided to find out whether dis was just noise or music. Its situated on a bylane off old ballygange place. D entrance is small but well lit up. D sitting space was bit cramped with 4 four seaters n 2 two seaters. We wanted to sit on d upper floor for more privacy but was told about d non functioning of the a.c s .
Thereafter we straight away placed our orders starting from d appetisers. D teeny weeny seafood chowder soup , though only in small portion, was awesome to taste!! D crab consonmme...yet another unique n delicious Bengali fusion starter.
D main course orders took quite a long time to arrive at our table. Crab dish again topped our list. Crabmeat stir fried with pickled garlic's unique flavour made our day.... Simply lip smacking. Chicken supreme with lemon n mustard was ok. But pork vindaloo n sliced pork n turmeric in banana leaf envelope was nothing grt to write about. All these dishes were accompanied by rice n pilaf. We still had little space for dessert n so we ordered for malpoa cheese cake n coffee n cigar mousse whose tastes were interestingly different. Thanks to d brains n d hands behind Bohemian for fusing bengali n continental cuisine seamlessly. Overall culinary experience surpassed our expectations n we wud certainly visit it again! 😃

It's a small and really good place. We had the baked crab and spinach and corn rolls. Too good. The pork and murshidabadi chicken is good too ! Do try the Malpua cheesecake in the end. A good place to have Bengali fusion food

The starters, panch phoran chicken escalope and vodka soaked prawns are delicious, juicy beauties. Your main courses should be Gondhoraj Lime Bhekti (cod in King Lime
sauce) and Aam Aada Bhekti (cod in mango and ginger sauce). Yup, it's fine dining Bengali style!!!!!

The place - situated at ballygunje this niche restaurant of bong fusion food welcomes you with its neo-modern decor what with its huge wall portraits of picturesque mountainous locations and rock postcards of legends such as the Rolling Stones and the doors. Even the restrooms are replete with stylised graffiti mentioning pink floyd and mohiner ghora guli amongst others.

The food:
The drinks gondhoraaj julep was simply amazing what with its right concoction of mint, gondhoraaj lime and I think tonic water. This is an unmissable drink! The other drink mint cucumber comb will infuse a fresh breath of life in the hot summer.

We had ordered a much recommended starter by the name of smoked bekti. The succulent pieces of the fish were served in a rectangular dish covered by glass. The waiter would uncover the glass and twirl it around your nose to let the smell waft through your senses. The sight smell and taste of the fish is simply out of the world and is something which I have never tried anywhere else.

The main course was kaancha lanka mutton which was really good though I wouldn't term it as exclusive, however, that's not because it doesn't live up to expectations but that the other thing was better. This other thing was chicken breast stuffed with spinach. The pieces were alluring sumptuous and a delight. Both the main dishes were accompanied with a small portion of rice.

The dessert which went by the name of cigar coffee mousse was an interesting fusion of Bengali steaming (bhanpa) and the regular mousse.

The music was classic rock, played at a volume which allows for regular conversation.

The waiters were attentive and eager to help.

The final verdict: if you consider yourself a foodie and haven't tried this place, reconsider the idea of calling yourself so!

Wanted to visit this restaurant after watching an episode of dadagiri whre the chef participated.
This place is located near bondal road in ballygunge.Quite a cosy place.I really loved the ambiance of the place , the soothing music playing and the overall getup of the place. We ordered Aam Kasundi chicken as starter - it was really mindblowing.In the main course we ordered Gondhoraj mutton it was a nice choice too specially the essense of gandharaj lebu in it. We were feeling hungry so we ordered chicken with chilly and nolen gur,never thought nolen gur can taste so good with chicken.
Lastly we had malpoa cheesecake - well one word,dont think twice before ordering it . overall an experience worth having again

Brilliant food! Kudos to chef Joy Bannerjee for bringing this blend of bengali and continental to kolkata! I recommend all dishes of pork and mutton... Pocket pinch is huge but worth every penny. I recommend inclusion of hard drinks..

If you are a foodie then Bohemian is the place to be. Located at old Ballygunge, this restaurant is a complete hit for the amazing food that they serve. This was my third visit to Bohemian and this time they had a revamped menu. The decor of this place is simple yet charming. This place serves bengali food with a twist.

I am a fish-lover and so I ordered for bhetki smoked in cumin and quartered Darjeeling chili, steamed bhetki in pickled chili and cheese and vodka soaked prawns for starters. My mom wanted to try something in chicken so we ordered for Aam kasundi soaked chicken escallops. All of them tasted extremely good. I have absolutely no complains regarding the food. Right from the taste of the food to the way they serve it, all perfect.

For the main-course I had chicken and this time it was Chicken supreme with preserved lemon and mustard. It comes with steamed rice which goes perfectly well with the dish.

The revamped menu does not have the pastas and pizzas anymore. I missed them this time. But at the end of the dinner there was too much of yummy food in my tummy. So no complains.

Looking forward to try the other items in the menu on my next visit.

Heard a lot about this place so finally tried it out. First look of the place wasnt impressive but it was homely atmosphere...tried the chilli mango chiken and bacon wrapped chicken both of which were lip smackingly good...the dessert "gondhoraj souffle" deserves equal praise...kudos to the chef for his culinary skills and off the beat preparations..will return very soon with more food lovers

My first impression was very good about this place.. They decor and the ambience is very tasteful... Coming to the food its different and delicious too.. They have a very light cooking trend which is tasty as well as not harmful to your body.. If you are a experimental foodie you should definitely try this place I believe not everyone can get their concept

So we must have literally ordered evrything vegetarian on the menu. The mushroom starter was amazing with a dash of tamarind. The banana stem starter was also something truly different. The cheese stuffed baby cherry and potatoes was my favourite dish. All the main course is a bit on the spicy side.so be careful. The cawliflower dish was so so. . Our drinks were also quite delicious. The deserts were the best part. My favourite was the gulabjamun one! Yummmm.

I would not rate it 5 because I don't know what would be a 5. But to me this place would be a reference . I would not call this a restaurant , because if I do , I might be undermining the art. Please do not complain about portions or volume. This place has eternally won my heart with their fish in aam kashundi reduction and kolmi shaak in chicken.  Thank you chefs.

I heard about the launch of Bohemian when I was in Bangalore and was quite excited to try the food here during my next visit to Kolkata. Why so excited?? Because this restaurant creates dishes combining Bengali cuisine with Continental influences. That should be adventurous!

So finally when I was in Kolkata, I visited this restaurant with Sui Bun. We arrived at the restaurant 15 minutes before its opening hours and had to wait outside, left to the ruthless Kolkata summer at its worst. The gatekeeper was kind enough to let us stand in the back entrance till the restaurant opened. To keep ourselves distracted from the heat, we took some pictures with the colorful cloths and lanterns. Fortunately, before our faces started to melt, the gatekeeper gave us the good news and we hopped to the aid of the restaurant's air conditioning.

The restaurant has two floors but small area and not many tables and I would recommend one to book their tables in advance if one makes plans for a typical busy restaurant day like a weekend. However, we had the liberty to seat ourselves anywhere because of the early birds we were. There were huge, striking pictures on the wall and pretty postcards hanging on stand of strings giving the restaurant a unique arty look.

Our waiter handed us the menu and we were quite quick to jump to the beverages section to beat the heat we just faced. We asked for two Gondhoraj Juleps, a lemonade with Godhoraj Lime and Coriander, till we scanned the menu to decide the appetizers and main course.

The menu was quite long, hence we spent a lot of time going through the items and analyzing what we would like. The drinks arrived quickly and we had decided our choice for the appetizers which was two portions of Chili Pickle and Cheese Baked Crab with Kolmi Greens.

The Gondhoroj Julep was a flavorful relief. I really enjoyed the chilled sips of the drink and it felt like a vacation! While we enjoyed the drink we did talk about how adding mint to this drink instead of coriander would give it another brilliant twist.

After spending some more time reading the menu and sipping our lovely drinks, we decided our main course which was two items, Prawns with Smoky Orange and Coriander, and Mutton stir fried with Browned Onions and Sliced Chilies. Shortly after our main course orders were placed, our appetizers arrived.

The Chili Pickle and Cheese Baked Crab with Kolmi Greens arrived in a flat khullad with the cheese lightly browned and the greens over the surface. Being me, I picked up the khullad and dug a spoon into it to have a tiny portion of the baked goodness. I tasted the SEA! It was comforting but also packed with flavor at the same time! I was quite happy about how well balanced the flavor was as I could taste the crab, the cheese and the chilli pickle and none of the ingredients were overpowering each other. I am usually a fast eater but in this case I slowed down to savor the appetizer as much as possible.

As we neared the completion of our appetizers, the waiter came with our food. I got the prawn dish while Sui Bun got the mutton dish. The Prawns with Smoky Orange and Coriander was served with Garlic and flattened Rice Pilaf and tossed veggies. I was waiting for the magic to happen in my mouth again and this dish did not disappoint me. The prawn curry was orangy, citrusy, sweetish and paired well with the rice. The veggies were just fine. Though the rice was slightly lumpy and the smokiness in the orange (as suggested by its name) I was expecting was missing, the flavors coming together were still really good that I would remember the dish for a long time.

After getting enough of the prawn, I swapped it for the mutton. The Mutton stir fried with Browned Onions and Sliced Chilies was served with Tomato Panchpharon Pita and Mustard Potato Salad. Yes, I admit to eating the dish like Pav Bhaji, the pav being the pita and the bhaji being the mutton. Man, this was on FIRE!! The mutton was well cooked and the chilies beat the onions to death. But being a Telugu boy did help in this case. I thoroughly enjoyed the heat in the dish. I couldn't taste the potato salad after this though, but the julep did help in letting me taste it. The mustard in the salad was light and it was simple. I did have an issue with the pita as I felt it was slightly hard and yes I couldn't taste anything that was there on the pita thanks to the chili in the mutton. I guess for a spicy food lover like me, it was fine but the flavors weren't balanced in this dish.

The portions of the food were quite sufficient and since I had to eat most of the mutton (because it was too hot to handle for Sui Bun), there was no room for any dessert in my belly.

Our check summed up to INR 2,100 which according to me was quite decent considering the unique flavorful experience and the sufficient portions we got. The service could be better when it came to suggesting dishes and being enthusiastic (read: simply having a smile on the face at least for the customers).

On a scale of 5, my ratings are:

A. Food - 4.5
B. Ambiance - 4.5
C. Service - 3.5
D. Wait Time - 5.0
E. Value for Money - 4.0

With an overall score of 4.5!

I recommend this place to anyone wanting to be experimental and adventurous with food and has a liking for Bengali and Continental cuisines!

Well Bohemian is one restaurant that serves wonderful Bengali fusion food but with totally poor service and not an inch of hospitality at all. The food is great but the quantity served is less compared to the exorbitant price that they charge. The waiters have a bored and sad demeanour and more on the arrogant side. As for the dishes we had ordered panchforon flavoured chicken escallops which was the best of the lot, Bacon wrapped prawns which was very good, Bacon wrapped chicken with aam kashundi reduction which was average.We had also ordered Mutton stir fried withbrowned onion and sliced chillies which was delicious. For desert we had Death by chocolate which was amazing and i quite liked the cooler Gondhoraj julep too. It is a shame that a place that offers such amazing food fails to maintain a warm atmosphere due to its incompetent service and charges a price that leaves one thinking if they have been fleeced. It would be good if the team works on this, till then I can do without visiting again.

For those who enjoy experimenting with food, Bohemian is a place you shouldn't miss. This Bengali fusion cuisine restaurant serves up a very interesting menu. We started our dinner with the teeny weeny soups, which genuinely are very small portions, not more than 3 tbspns perhaps. We took the spicy seafood chowder and the spicy pumpkin and potato soup. Both were beautifully flavoured, very robust in the ingredients. We then ordered a chilli pickle and cheese baked crabs and mutton wraps with hing and milk fudge. The crab dish while delicious, had bold flavours which unfortunately meant that the flavour of the crab meat got lost. The mutton wraps on the other hand were relatively simpler on flavour but you would enjoy it only if you liked the milkiness with the mutton. We followed these up with a gondharaj julep and a spicy mango shake, both of which were delicious. For the mains, we ordered a mushroom and long beans in a spicy coconut sauce, kajoli styffed with egg yolk mousse a nd a bacon wrapped chicken with aam kashundi. The flavours in each of the curries were beautiful however the core ingredients lost out to these bold flavours. For dessert we ordered the maplua cheese cake and darjeeling tea and tobacco infused panacotta. The cheese cake was ok. It was a malpua sandwiched between a vanilla cream cake. The panacotta on the other hand was amazing. The flavour of the tea was perfect and the creaminess of the panacotta was great. Dont worry on the tobacco because that was not predominant. I guess the dish just used smoked tobacco flavour to ensure it doesnt get over powering. All in all a good meal and a place i would go back to once more to try some of the other dishes out.

A Boutique restaurant in Ballygunj that experiments with "Fusion Dishes". Very Tight Sitting and the Prices are on the higher side. 

On the Positive Side, great staff and good Service. They provide Advance Table booking and the Portions are very decent. 

They don't serve alcohol but serve "Vodka" based dishes - one wonders.

For quite sometime I have been hearing about Bohemian, this restaurant has been the talk of the town for sometime now. So last year after the Durga puja we decided to try out this place with some friends and people from workplace who are not from Kolkata. 
If I have to describe this place in just one word that would be : UNIQUE. 
The authentic Bengali cuisine with a continental touch, a spin off of the most hard core Bengali dishes leaves you wanting for more. Though the place is quite small, it's just not worth a miss for the creative yet delicious food which they serve. 
According to me one should definitely try their pan fried betki & Ada Mourir Mangsho. Even the prawn gandhoraj is something one just has to try. But for me the dish of the day was : Stuffed chicken breast simmered with cheese! The taste still lingers...it's that good. 

I was quite excited about their dessert from the moment I saw their menu and I think I ordered the best one : MALPUA CHEESECAKE! This one got to be awarded for sure. 

Though have been here just once I would really like to visit this one a second time, so can't wait ..literally!

It is just about the most pretentious food joint I have had the misfortune of visiting, anywhere in the world. It reminds me of Seattle's Penny Cafe for an afternoon high tea, the very carefully cultivated artiness. While the space was disappointing, it was solid American comfort food.  However, our bong boy chef Joy's spread is a disappointment. The decor is extremely put on and manages to put one off :)! The four of us girlfriends got together after two months and we were all looking forward to a relaxed dinner together. After our last food fest at Matsuri, we selected Bohemian at my recommendation from a coverage of the place by celebrity chef Vikas Khanna. Man, were we disappointed! Everything in the place is supremely affected. The staff is raw and untrained. The food tries too hard and fails miserably. However, it did manage to draw sniggers from us all who had a roaring laugh every time the tastes reached from our tongue to our brains. It was truly hilarious. We usually have the habit of hijacking each other's plates if we like something. This time each one was completely altruistic and wanted to give up one's plate to the others- it was so bad. The fusion is discordant and repulsive. We ate chicken wrap in nolen gur for starters. It was odd but good. May be we were hungry! Then the nightmare started. We ordered four different entrees so we could share different gustatory feasts. The bland cheetal meat steak with leathery pita type breads and a gooey gravy splattered all over the plate, the odd and unappealing prawn panchforon and the over-strong chicken in mustard goo and tamarind, were all very VERY bad. The only one that was good was the prawn in dahi and gondhoraj. The portion of rice that came with each meal was ridiculous and really phony. If you want to feed people the Bengali way, at least keep some substance and meaning to what you put on the plate! Oh and there was an accompanying 'salad' (in my case it was crunchy boiled baby corn, beans, carrot- very fresh and enjoyable but slightly off with panch foron (!) and the other three had a kolmi shak or some shaak (green leafy vegetable) with bori (!) which accompaniment would have been fine if some more rice was provided). We wanted 'sada pani' and were served mineral water bottles and were told that they were free but we found that we were charged for each and every bottle! Okay, now the dessert. I remembered Vikas Khanna's "mmmmm"s and "bah bah"s and told my friends who were literally in splits over the ridiculous food, that dessert will redeem all the fusion fiasco. How wrong I was. We ordered toffee rossogolla (took 35 minutes to prepare) which was truly horrible (served with green chilly zest in cream which was interesting), aam castard which was gooey and over-sweet and tasted just like an overdone amsotto, malpua cheese cake with muri logenze decorations (Bengalis will remember our childhood obsession with these multi-coloured sugar coated mouri with fondness!) and baked alaska (this was actually good). We had a really good time though. We rolled with laughter at the strange tasting food which we all but forced down our own and each other's throats (:)) The decor with wooden clothes clips sticking greeting cards (theme??) on coconut choir ropes strung across poles at the entrance regaled us some more. The ground floor is cloistered (no one told us there was a floor above though my friend was the first one to arrive). Most of the clientele seemed quite at home and some seemed regulars. I just want to say this that panch foron is one of the most revered, loved and feared Bengali forons. Chef Joy should not take this powerful foron for granted. Evolution of cuisine started the day ancient man tamed wild plants and teamed them with animals they hunted. Chef Joy would do well to remember that before subjecting paying customers to his weird food concoctions. And by the way, we all are very well traveled and had gone to Bohemian with open minds and good appetites. We had no prejudice towards fusion cuisine. Our experience is for all to see! Oh and we got a coupon with 700 rupees off of our next bill on our current bill of Rs.4397/-. Anybody interested? We won't return even we were paid to eat there!!

Great place with lovely fusion cuisine. The chef has a knack for adding drama to his dishes. The smoked hilsa with am kasundi was perfectly done. We ordered pork Vandaloo, well cooked succulent pork and spice to light you up.  The chital machh r steak, my first fish steak that is, and a memorable experience but  I would prefer my plain old mutton steak over it any day,.  Next was the murshidabadi chicken. I hope someone could explain me the origins of these names. Lovely food and great hospitality. Thanks to our senior who treated us here. Will love coming back here.

I have been wanting to go to this place for a long long time. Last Saturday I had the chance and I jumped on it. We had parshe fillet with coriander sauce and bhetki in pickled garlic gravy. Wow! Wow! And the next wow was the tender coconut mousse. OMG such amazing food. This charming little restaurant has become my favourite and I hope to be there again soon. This time we tried the green mango sorbet and oh my God I can return just for that! 

Revisit: 

Again I am totally floored with the food. But too many 'unavailables' this time. Wanted to try the interesting cocktails but well they were unavailable. And a note to the Chef, the chili pickle and the cheese baked with kolmi greens, was full of shells. You might want to be more careful with that. Its not a very pleasant experience.

With closed eyes, sneak that soft and tender bhetki cube into your mouth, enjoy the delicacy while listening to Pink floyd, Eagles, Anindya or Anupam Roy and enjoy life! If you hear anyone complaining about the price, you will know he/she doesn't bother about the coexistence of quality and creativity!

This is not your ordinary Bengali restaurant. This is like Cary Grant meets Uttam Kumar. All the dishes are classic Bengali (like Uttam Kumar), with a hint of global cuisine. Gondhoraj Bhetki is quintessentially Bengali with a touch of south east Asia. Malpua cheesecake is just mind blowing.... Literally! All the dishes are marvellous concoction of Bengali and world cuisine. Truly genius.

It's the worst destination in Kolkata for someone who is really fond of bengali cuisine. I found this in Zomato with such an amazing rating and decided to go to this restaurant on poila boishakh along with my family. It was a complete waste of time and money. The prawn dish was a big spoiler. When asked for the reason of stale smell, they gave some lame excuses. Most of the items were not available, e.g., no side dishes of Hilsha... I had never have such a bad chital machher muithya before. The portion of rice in one plater was so less you would't have any other choice but to order another plate of rice for one. It's not a classical bong destination. Sorry if I hurt anyone's sentiment. Last but not least, after having dinner here, from very next morning most of my family members are suffering from stomach ache and indigestion.

Food is really interesting. Not sure if it can be called fusion as the dishes seemed and sounded very desi. However the preparations were not traditional Bengali dishes but a sort of New Age Bengali Cuisine (traditional flavors being used to make new dishes)

Kudos to Joy Bannerjee for coming up with this concept. Loved the Gondhoraj Mutton Curry and Toffee Rasgolla - very novel and sumptuous! 
Also knowledgeable waiting staff - that is so critical for a good eating experience, specially when one is trying new stuff. 
Will come again shortly :)

That being said,  I have had one bad experience with the service that has left a bad taste in my mouth.... and while I am willing to overlook that on account of the brilliant food, I think others wont be as forgiving. 
I DO wish they would change the decor!!  It just does not match the food and theme of the place.... its "college canteen meets teeny bopper coffee shop" makes me cringe every time. THANK GOD the food rocks! Chef JB is one of my all time favorites.

So I visit Kolkata after many years and go to bohemian straight from the airport. Had heard good things from my parents. Fusion Bengali food seemed really intriguing to me. 

We started off with gondhoraj julep which was refreshing. For starters we ordered the vodka soaked prawns which were delicious! 

For main course I ordered the chitol steak which was very well done (pun intended). My mom ordered the sizzled bhetki. The pickled garlic sauce was brilliant. My dad ordered the kancha lonka mangsho which was the only disapointment. Though mutton was very tender but the dish didn't taste that good.

For desert we ordered the gondhoraj pie and the malpua cheesecake. The pie was amazing but the malpua cheesecake was a big let down. It was quite bad and we couldn't even finish bit among 3 of us.

Definitely wish to come back and try some of the other cushion dishes.

One of the must dine places in the city. But yes, with feedbacks I got from friends and families, I realized its not for everyone - but anyone who like to have their food based on the taste and not with any pre-conceived notions will love it. As its written, its a curious but enjoyable blend of bengali and continental tastes.
My favourites - kalmi saag crab, gandharaj sorbets and almost all the main dishes.
The place always welcomes me with a good and diferent taste each time.

Warm place. Menu is interesting. Never tried fusion cuisine before but this place compelled me to change my perception. Lamb chops platter was great so was another dish with bhetki fillet and mustard. But I will not recommend any of these, rather one must be adventurous at heart while selecting the dish.

Heard so much about Bohemian but had a very bad experience. The waiter gave us a bottle of room temperature bottled water when it was sweltering hot outside. When we asked for regular but cold water with ice, the waiter said they had only bottled mineral water. What kind of restaurant doesn't trust its own regular water? Anyway, we said we'd like the bottled water but cold. The waiter takes away the room temperature bottle and disappears for a long time. I wave my hand and catch his attention but he looks away! All he had to do was to walk up to the fridge right there and bring a cold water bottle. That took ten minutes. When we asked him to explain this bad service, he nodded silently and went away to take the order from another table. Pissed, we got up and left. Nobody stopped us, not even to ask is to pay for a bottle of mineral water. Disappointed.

I heard so much about Bohemian and had been wanting to visit the place for a long time. Finally decided to get a few things delivered home and I was left with mixed feelings. To cut it short the place is overrated. I ordered banana stem patties for an appetiser, which was largely okay. It could taste little too sour to some. I had foil baked bhetki with baby turmeric, teen phoron and coriander jus. I was very disappointed with this one. It's a light fish curry but the taste of turmeric was too strong. The flavour of the fish and everything else was drowned in the turmeric paste. That could be intentional on the part of the chef but I didn't like the end product. The greens served alongside didn't have much of a flavour except for the strong taste of garlic. My original choice was tilapia wrapped in bacon but the person taking the order on phone insisted that I go for the light bhetki. Did he insist me to order the bhetki and not the bacon-wrapped tilapia because the tilapia would have been more work for the cook? My dissatisfaction with the main course triggered such unnecessary suspicion. :) Finally, I liked the dessert --- gondhoraj lemon pie with ginger brittle. The taste of a standard pastry was enhanced by leaps and bounds with the soothing gondhoraj flavour. Very innovative recipe. My overall experience was less than satisfactory but I would give this restaurant a second chance. Next time I would drop in (rather than getting a delivery) to try some different picks.

It's the destination to discover Bengali food with a twist you won't find just anywhere in town. From mouthwatering preparations to presentation at its peak, Bohemian serves you right. The ambiance is quite sober and cozy but could have been superb had it been a bit bigger. I liked the arrangement inside this place and the service and the authenticity of food really pleased me to the core.

The prices are quite high but I wouldn't mind suggesting it to those who prefer the quality over price. Overall, a very very nice place to have your meal without worrying about how it's going to taste. Just order anything, and you'll be blessed.

Food is one of d finest art dat draws 3 of your sense organs ( eyes, nose and mouth) at a time. This is the place which rightly do so. One of d very small (in size) restaurants I have seen which gives food lovers some very innovative concept food. Now when I say innovative, I rightfully stand by it. Grilled bhetki with cheese n chicken in nolen gur.....might sound "WTF" but trust me once it goes in your mouth it will turn to "OMG". Among d main course try anything in d menu, cause every single dish is just mouth watering. For desserts my fav is malpoya cheese cake(a must try pls). O wait...before I forget...its summers so once you get inside the restro from dis scorching heat pls try the Gondhoraj julep. I can bet one of the finest refresher I have ever tasted. Food lovers, its a must try if you like innovation. But yes keep you pockets heavy with d big buks.

Bengali food..on steroids! That best describes the food at Bohemian. Mainstream ingredients like panchphoron, kashundi, gondhoraj etc are used like never before to create pretty sensational stuff. The enviable collection of rock memorabilia adds a nice personalized touch to the decor. To start with, the subtle bhetki smoked with cumin and darjeeling chilli left us wanting more, maybe a tad small portion for appetizer. The gondhoraj sorbet and spiced mango shake were refreshing. The mains-bacon wrapped chicken, stir fried mutton and chital meat steak(pick of the lot) were delicious. The dessert menu is really inventive and you'll be spoilt for choice. We went for the malpua cheesecake(the mouri lozenges are a fun textural element). The place is pricey but occasionally you don't mind paying a little extra, especially if it leaves a great aftertaste.

As per my to do restaurants list been there with friends for a lunch.
We were very late to order for lunch around 3pm..thankfully staffs were understanding and took our elaborate order..and allow us to finish till 5pm!!
Each of them were good..fish, chicken, lamb and pork...and few interesting Mocktails were good too!
On desserts we had ..Death by chocolate and Gondhoraaj souffle..this was best lemon souffle I had so far!..  
Fusion food at its best in Kolkata! 
Over all service was excellent..decoration, cleanliness, ambiance was up to the mark. My suggestion would be to get alcohol licence ...beers and Cocktails would go with food very well..

I have visited this restaurant twice with my family...Ambiance is good... quality of food is good ...variety in Indian and Continental (fusion of both) but it is very high priced and one plate of anything only suffice one person... Most of the time i think it goes empty... I feel it caters to people who really do not want to cook at home or can't cook probably....

Amazing as always, Bohemian never fails to surprise me with how they manage to fuse Continental sense of ingredients and techniques along with Bengali sense of flavour and aroma. 
Will definitely visit again.

The only word that comes to your mind after you taste their food is - "Wow". Just awesome. One of the best fusion cuisines, I've ever tasted. The ambience is soothing & very nicely done. So is their music. Gives you the feel of the City of Joy. The service is really good. The waiters are courteous & happy to serve no matter how late you walk in. Each dish on their menu is something different, you feel like trying out everything. And Chef Joy Banerjee, never fails to amaze you. They introduced a new menu about two weeks back & have come up with some awesome dishes yet again. Things you must try - Daab Chingri Dynamite, Toffee Roshogolla with Green Chill Sabayon & Mustard & Tender Coconut Mousse.

Bohemian,  is one of my favorite restaurants in Kolkata so far and the best part is, it is soo near to my home that whenever there is a craving for pork.... i can happily land up here.

Visited the place for the first time after their renovation job and introduction of the new menu. The first floor of the restaurant is soberly done with very subtle colored decor but the beauty of the place can be realized once the mystery of the glass sliding censor door is discovered. One will take time to uncover the functioning of the sliding door and once it is decoded.... you will be pleased to find the ever welcoming new Bohemian.

The menu card is smartly done.... with introduction of host of new dishes but i still miss the pork chops of the last menu. There are just a handful of places in Kolkata which serves this pork delicacy and Bohemian was undoubtedly one the best in them.

The black colored napkins were weird and repelling.  The positivity of the place will surely go for a toss once you look at them. I feel one should avoid using black in crockery or cutlery or even napkins for that matter. 

Once you have made up your mind what to eat from the confusing menu, you will find a smiling faced attendant by you side to guide you. While browsing through the list, pan grilled pork spare ribs with kalojeere and nolen gur will surely catch your eyes. If you are not a food enthusiast, you are advised to stay away.

We order pork fry, which was a disaster ( a too strong word used may be). I wish the attendant was little more sure about what he is selling and how the dish would be. We thought it to be pork slices stir fried and tossed in flavored sauce but what came was not very appealing. It was pork slices thinly coated and stir fried. it was soo salty and crunchy that we were completely taken aback.

Pork Vindaloo ordered in the main course was a pure delight. Very nicely prepared, exactly the way anglo indians make it at home and it was rightly presented. 

We were too full to venture out for the desserts but one thing that ill surely try next time.... is malpuwa cheesecake....

Over all a good experience and surely my visit will remain confirmed at least once  in two months. 

All the best .... Cheers!!!!!!

Different types of items created by chef Joy Banerjee. Its a cocktail of Bengali and continental (Also pure Bengali and pure continental available) food. The items are just 'Fatafati'. Though its a bit costly, but I should say its value for money.

Waoh!! this is exactly what you are gonna tell the moment you take the first bite! the food here will blow ur mind completely! yes, it is a bit pocket pinching, but i would suggest if u have a checklist of 5 restaurants, if u have to miss out on 4 of them to visit this, then DEFINITELY DO SO!! 
we started with Vodka soaked prawns with garlic Aioli. It was sooo terrific we HAD to order 2! Spicy grilled bhetki with coriander and chicken stroganoff were next to order. and ended with the mouth watering cheese cake malpua. How amazingly the make these delicacies! brilliant!! the best fusion food i have ever had! welldone!! A well deserving 5/5.
Cost for 2 people: 2500 approx.

During the last few years whenever I visited Kolkata, my friends there had asked me to try out this place which according to them was refreshingly different.  I was told that the menu has imaginative experimentation of fusion with specifically traditional Bengali cuisine. Though the concept looked extremely interesting, I could finally visit this restaurant only during my trip in January.

Like many of the newer eateries in Kolkata, Bohemian is tucked inside a residential lane, very close to the Sitala Mandir on Bondel Road. The restaurant has two separate entrances for the two floors. As we could not get a table on the ground floor we dashed upstairs to a more spacious setup. The place has a no frilled décor with posters of famous pop singers adorning some of the walls.  I could also notice a few framed photos from Ladakh as well as a collection of masks, and other artefacts. 

As we took our seat and looked through the menu, I started understanding what my friends had been talking about.  Bengali spices and ingredients like radhuni, pachphoron, kalojeera and kasundi have been used in many of the dishes, so have been traditionally Bengali vegetables like kolmi shaag, gandharaj lemon or Bengal berries (kul).  However the combinations are very off beat and experimental in content as well as presentation. 

The combo section of the menu interested me the most, and it was a challenge to choose among the interesting dishes. I felt like ordering a lot of items, but since there were only three of us, we had to settle for three main courses. The fish item we went for was Spicy Grilled Bhetki  with Radhuni Enriched Curry Sauce. This was served with steamed rice and saag. The radhuni (wild celery) flavor was subtle in the curry, which was spicy but not rich. We also loved the saag served with it – it was exactly as they are cooked at home. 

The Bacon Wrapped Chicken bundles with Aam Kasundi Reduction was another experiment we tried out. Aam kasundi or mustard mango sauce is a Bengali delicacy which adds zing to many dishes. The dish was presented with rice and sautéed vegetables.  I liked the concept was was slightly disappointed with the preparation – the flavor of aam kasundi was very mild in the curry.

But the best of the combos we tried was the Royal Bengal Mutton with Bhuna Sauce.  The bhuna sauce was very tasty and the slices of boneless mutton worked well with it, along with a layer of mashed potatoes which was placed underneath. The dish was served with bread rolls and sautéed vegetables, the same way as many of the Anglo-Indian dishes you get in Kolkata. 

For dessert it was the unanimous choice – we were told that the Gandharaj Souffle at Bohemian rocks. Lately we have seen this flavorful lemon being used in a lot of dishes – starting from Gandharaj Bhetki, mutton and even ghol. The soufflé at Bohemian has the fragrance of the Gandharaj emanating from it, making it a delicious combination. The lemon sauce and slices of lemon which were used to style the dish made it look extremely appetizing and the taste did not disappoint too.

We wanted to try many more dishes – but were constrained by our appetite on the day, as we were coming out of food extravaganza called Bengali marriage for the previous three days. Some items which looked interesting to me were the Pachforon Flavored Chicken Escallops, Bhetki in Aam Aada Sauce,  Mutton with Green Mango and Cheese and Malpua Cheese Cake. I would surely revisit during my next trip to Kolkata.

Bill for the above items came to around Rs 1900.

An absolute delight. !! Calcutta needs more places like this.

Have been there a few times, and dying to go again (I'm currently based in Delhi, so will be a while). Almost anything you order here is sure to make you happy. Fusion food using Bengali and largely Italian flavours, the place is awesome. More so for non vegetarians, but us vegetarians need not fear too much.

Personally prefer rice combinations over the ones with rolls (soft bread rolls, that is). Do not miss the malpua cheesecake at any cost. Recommend to have a palate cleanser between the starter and main course (gondhoraj is highly recommended).

The decor is simple. Service is good. Usual diners are not too noisy. All in all, a fabulous addition to Calcutta's gastronomic map.

I will give a 4.5 since I am not sure I got the Bohemian experiment in its entirety. So it is Bengali ingredients in continental form, and in some cases the results were obviously great. However, for other dishes I just didn’t get it. Seemed to be a plain replacement of original ingredients with Bengali ones. Thats something that typically happens at the first stages of an innovation, you just apply the new concept and generate interesting results. But typically then you fine tune and select and put on the table for final consumption only those that stand out: gondhoraj julep, vodka soaked prawns, cheese baked crab, joyous mutton chops. But then it gets a bit repitative. One main item with an accompanying green and rice. The menu is vast and I wish I could visit all corners. But the place is too little and the waiting time is a bit discouraging. 

Will keep visiting and seeing how it progresses coz it seems the best is still due from this fascinating ongoing experiment.

Bohemian- Cheese-Cream-Cheese-Cream!!! A blend of Italian and bong food!!! Come to think of it, very innovative venture by Chef Banerjee. Only based on the reviews i visited the place and was taken by surprise from the time of entrance till we were seated inside. The place is small and not over the top fancy but colorful, well lit and very creative decor. Warm ambiance. 

Now coming to food: we ordered -
Chilly pickle and cheese baked crab with kolmi greens- It was an absolute stunner. The item did not have any sea food smell and was perfectly blended with cream and cheese. In One word i would say "Unique".

Bacon wrapped prawns - This item was just about average. It could have been better , had the bacon in which the prawns were wrapped been less fatty. At one point your stomach starts to churn with all the fats of the bacon and feels yuck. The chutney served with it was sweet and creamy so the whole dish or the combination just failed to scintillate my taste buds.Even the taste could have been better. The item claims to be spicy but it isn't at all. The chef needs to redefine "SPICY". They also should add a hot and sour chutney with it just to balance all that cheezy items.

Next in main we ordered Garlic toast with cheese and mutton with yoghurt and pickled green chillies - Again on enquiry we were told the mutton will be spicy but no it wasn't but the gravy was yum. I feel the food is prepared as per the European standards and perhaps the word "spicy"is a misfit here in Kolkata because we bongs master the skill of eating hot and spicy food. It was served with one spatula of rice. Yes you heard it right " ONE SPATULA". Indeed very small amount of rice. Anyways coming to the garlic tost- shocking but true it was really spicy (laughing out loud). Of all the things the garlic toast stood up to the spicy taste. It had so much or red chilly flakes that not only did it make the toast spicy but also lowered the taste of it. Common who goes wrong with garlic toast? Here it was all wrong.

Dessert - we ordered the Malpua Cheesecake! BAD !! if anyone has ever tasted a philadelphia cheese cake or a classic strawberry cheesecake you will understand whats wrong with Bohemians cheesecake. The cheese or the cream prepared was tasteless and stale. Please go to flury's or Chilli's to have their cheesecake. You will know why i am critical. 

Apart from the food the staffs were polite but not very well trained. Attending guests is good but gaping at the guests while they are eating is cheap. 

So i would say an average place but a must visit for all the cream and cheese lovers. Rates are reasonable as per location and food. Usually such places are pricey. The rating is based on Chef's innovation and adventurous outlook towards food !

'Bohemian' is located on Old Ballygunje 1st lane at Ballygunje.This is the Chef Joy Banerjee's restaurant.They served Bengali food with Italian combination.Ambiance is attractive but this place is very small.I've visited this restaurant with my Sir & friends.As a beverage I've tasted here Gondhoraj Julep.This is very tasty.Then we ordered Panchphoron Flavored Chicken Escallops & Lemon Chicken On Lemon Skewers as a starter.Both are quite tasty.Then We ordered Dhaniakhali Murgi,Kancha Lanka Mangsho,Baccon Wrapped Chicken Supreme Bundles with Aam Kashundi reduction & Mutton Vindaloo.Mutton preparations are very delicious,but chicken preparations are not so good.All main courses served with Steamed Rice & green salad.Atlast we ordered their dessert,name - Cheese Malpua  Cake & Death By Chocolate.Both are yummy.Cheese malpua cake is outstanding.Don't miss it if you go there.You'll fall in love with it.Price is medium expensive.

Bohemian is unique. That's the shortest summary one can give. Listen to its description and if you're a skeptic like me, you might dismiss it as some fancypants crap. But the food tells quite a different story. Been here so many times I've lost count, but I'll keep it about last night's dinner with my parents.
For starters, we had the cheese garlic bread (a standard order), nolen gur chicken (special menu) and the smoked beckti. All absolutely delicious and as is customary in this place, the bizarre sounding nolen gur chicken worked superbly, with a mixture of sweet and an aftertaste of spice that almost stings you. 
The entrees were chicken supreme with mustard and cumin for me, and two mutton dishes that I cannot quite remember the names of for my parents. All absolutely amazing. Being regulars, there was a special treat in store for us: the Chef's cauliflower mousse served with...wait for it....dahlia. Never in my life did I imagine I would eat dahlia with such relish. The mousse was amazing too.
With a meal like that, it would be very difficult for dessert to match up, but match up it did. To say the least. We were treated to two special desserts: the Gold Flake and Darjeeling Tea Mousse Panna Cotta, and the Gondhoraj Lemon Pie. The former just made me laugh before I could begin eating it. There was an edible cigarette placed on top of the Panna Cotta and as is the case with almost every dish at Bohemian, you can taste all the components that the dish claims to have. So much so that we wondered if there was actually nicotine in that thing! The pie was fresh, fragrant and delicious, and a perfect ending to a perfect meal.
Chef Joy is an artist. There's no other way to put it. Do not miss this place if you want a truly interesting and rewarding gastronomic experience.

WARNING! Do not venture in if you are not into subtle tastes. The food here is basically tweaked Bong food with a touch of continental. And Chef Joy Banerjee has really done well to create a beautiful medley.

What we had: Panch phoron chicken escallops, murshidabadi chicken shasliks, potato noisettes, devilled mushrooms with chicken, steamed chicken breast in radhuni, gondhoraj sorbet, green mango & honey sorbet, and malpua cheesecake. Each of them struck the right balance between the bong-ness and continental-ness (with the prevalent flavours being bong) and took me on a journey of perfect fusion.

But there was a major major drawback too, for which I rate it lower. And that is the customer service. When I entered the floor where we say, there was no staff to be found. And the same lack of professionalism prevailed throughout the stay.

That being said, their Gondhoraj sorbet is a must try! Sadly, neither their guramel custard nor their Kalojeere Yoghurt Brulee was available and I look forward to trying those out. Now just go there folks!

Finally managed to visit this much talked about place. The staff was courteous enough to serve us food though we reached just a little after lunch time. 
Food taste is absolutely different with a lot of twist in the actual flavors. You definitely are in for a surprise if you are looking for the typical Bengali flavors. 
Must visit as a one time experience. 
The portions are minuscule compared to the pricing. 
Overall a great experience except the pricing.

Greeted with postcards of Jim Morrison, Jethro Tull, Floyd and everyone else the chef loves, only to be escorted into a 20-seater room-cum-restaurant, we loved the yum fusion of bengali and continental in exactly the right portions. We tried bacon wrapped prawns and devilled mushrooms which were more than being just easy on the palate. The strange location of this must-visit joint only adds to the bohemian-ness. A total must-visit if you want something awesome and different at the same time. Mr. Banerjee might want to slice off one-fifth of the prices, though, to make it a place worth visiting regularly. But then, that's probably intentional.

Food : 10/10
Service: 9/10
Value: 7/10
Ambience: 7/10

Bohemian is one of hidden gems of Kolkata - literally - because of its location in a narrow lane in Ballygunge. The restaurant specializes in tasteful fusion of bengali and continental cuisine and boy is it good! The place is small and cozy with seating on two floors but the ambience is nothing to boast about

Gettin down to business, for starters - the Joyous mutton chops were very well spiced but lacked meat. But however a very good start. For main course we ordered bacon baked tilapia with ginger and fennel, bacon wrapped chicken supreme bundles
and a bhetki based dish. All three dishes were a surprise in itself and for the lack of words - perfect! We did not say a word for the next fifteen minutes till our plates were licked clean. 

For desserts we ordered what our waiter recommended - malpua cheese cake
, death by chocolate and gondhoraj souffle. The malpua cheesecake was a perfect fusion of the malpua and the best cheesecake you have had. The gondhoraj souffle was basically a jaggery based souffle which gave it a a very caramelly and creamy flavour while still being appropriately sweet. And the best of all - death by chocolate. This really stole the show and made me personally realise how we have evolved so much compared to other living beings when it comes to food. The texture was a fusion of a mousse, ice cream and cake with bits of chocolate cake in places which you can't see easily but distinctly taste. All this lightened us by a good 1200 bucks but we were too happy to give a damn.

Overall, Bohemian is on my list for a repeat visit and its a must if you are a fan of - lets say - good food. And dont forget to cover all three courses - you will not regret it despite the hole in your pocket.

Dishes tried: Bhetki smoked with cumin and quartered Darjeeling chilly, sizzled Bhetki simmered with pickled garlic.

Quality: Best in class. Amazing quality of fishes served.

Ambience: Fresh. Not seen before in Calcutta.

Service: Normal, nothing too fancy.

Pocket pinch: A little on the expensive side.

Verdict: The Bhetki is out of the world. The decor is very contemporary, and it is a good place for having the new-age Calcutta fine dining experience.

How to impress a Bengali palate? If you go the traditional way you compete with Maa er ranna, so bohemian decides to go the other way, to confuse you.

Decor: A certain leftist intellectual decor which is devout of any unnecessary bling adorned by pastels that deserve second looks.

Service: As complicated the dishes looks on menu, longer it takes to prepare. So if you are not the kind of person who loves staring at artworks, please carry newspaper for the 30 minutes wait.

Food: Nicely different. Don't expected your taste buds to react in orthodox manner. Be ready to be surprised. Try atleast one 'Gondhoraj X(Fish/Prawn)'. Refrain for continental contents like pizza et al. Explore red meat like bacon wrapped chicken, mutton chops ( because Pork Chops is soo mainstream). Gondhoraj souffle deserves a taste. And yes you are allowed to ask about chef's obsession with the citric fruit.

Music: Take some time to notice the music. The mixed collection is epitome of fusion for its ability to change tracks from Lynard Skynard to Chandrabindoo in one go. Bravo!

Simply marvellous!
I absolutely loved the fusion of the Bengali food. Every dish that I had tried had an unique taste, flavour and aroma.
It's brilliant work coupled with innovation that could present such pure delicacies.
This gourmet inspired restaurant can redefine your Bengali palate for sure.
I loved the minced crab dish that was used in the starters, along with the gondhoraaj mangsho and kancha lonka mangsho.
To top it off, was the brilliant mustard soufflé.
Absolutely brilliant creations! A must visit for all gourmet lovers!

It was an old time friends meet yesterday at Bohemain, which actually ended up with an amazing eating experience. This time we sat on the 1st floor of the resturant and the decor out there is almost similar to its ground floor.

After Gondhoraj Julep, for the Starter we order Vodka soaked grilled prawns with Aioli Sauce and Pork Ribs square with Nolen Gur. Now this is quite interesting, Nolengur flavour in Pork Chops. It was sweet and hot too. But yes, I loved Vodka soaked grilled prawns more. After such an exotic starter we were pretty happy with Bohemian. We had Somnath there who attended us nicely and guided as what should be ordered further. He was kind enough to treat us with their orange Meyo dip on special demand.

 Then came Pan Braised Bhekti with Aamada Sauce and Mutton with Baby Onion green Mango and Cheese. Now this was too much, I mean it was outstanding. The whole evening we just discussed about how good the food is and when we all meet at this place next. The dinner ended with Gondhoraj Soufle and some wonder memories to cherish for long.

My sister recommended I try eating here during my annual Kolkata visit. It was surprisingly easy to find, so a hurrah for location. I was pleasantly surprised by the attentive staff. They were super polite and really aware of the menu items. We tried a couple of fish dishes which were excellent, followed by another sister recommendation- the gondhoraj souffle. Crazy good. Sincerely hope to see Bohemian set up a branch in Mumbai.

Old Ballygunge’s Bohemian restaurant is one restaurant which stands for class and quality. The restaurant which offers excellent food and cozy ambience which is most needed to enjoy good food. Every time I go this restaurant I simply marvel at their food items. You will find there the picnic basket menu. Take their sandwiches such as sea food and fired garlic, roast mutton and mustard onion or spinach and roasted corn, they are simply delicious. You can choose any of these sandwiches and among the main course my personal favourite is mutton brown stew, soya chunk brown stew, garlic and coriander keema pie. With that I prefer black beans and corn salad. In the desert you can choose brownie with butterscotch sauce, or apple crumble. Then comes the food menu among which I prefer chili pickle and cheese baked crab with kolmi greens. Then came the steamed rice, grilled mutton chops with mashrooms and spicy red wine. The combination of rice and grilled mutton was simply excellent. Lastly as some of my friends have sweet tooth so they ordered the very famous malpua cheese cake which was heavenly. The restaurant’s desert menu is full with lots of sweet items such as mocha mousse, roasted pineapple soufflé, spiced mango soufflé etc.

Bohemian is a revolution of epic proportions for any foodie! A menu that has been invented and then created with precision and passion. Been there 4-5 times and yet to figure out my favorite dish because they are all so good and I also keep wondering what's still left behind that I have not tasted yet. First and foremost the food is unique, you won't get any of these items anywhere else. The taste is out of the world with its multiple layers and unique aromas, I wonder where from they source the ingredients. I couldn't help but list the following items and by doing that I am actually doing gross injustice. Even then vodka soaked prawns, cottage cheese nuggets with aam kasundi, gondhoraj bhetki, cheese stuffed mushroom, parshe with paanchphoron, pork chops with apple sauce, mutton with yoghurt and green chilli..this list would not end quickly, better I stall it here. Considering the taste and uniqueness I consider the price to be almost a charity.  Since this is a review it has to be short..so I would just finish it of by saying this is one restaurant that you should visit no less than 10 times. Rockstar restaurant when it comes to food and taste. Nothing else matters !

Took my diabetic parents to dinner yesterday. All the food items, even the ones marked spicy, were too sweet. The only sugar free preparation/drink available was water (though we heard rumours about a salted lime soda. Yuck!). The Kanchalonka Mangsho was full of fatty chicken pieces. The only saving grace was the Dhonekhali crab and Grilled Bhetki gravy (to some extent).

Took my family for a memorable Christmas dinner at one of the most talked out dining options at South Kolkata which is Bohemian. If you are visiting there first time two things will drag your attention; one is unique decoration at entrance and after entering the small size of the restaurant. They have sitting provision at first floor too. Inside is decorated with huge landscape photographs and posters of musicians or bands.
We had reservation in place and got tables after few minutes delay. The four seater table is itself too small where we have been asked to adjust among 5 adults made us extremely uncomfortable. The restaurant was busy and there was only one server taking care of the 5-6 tables. As expected there was delay in service starting for giving menu or serving water. Cutlery on table was not properly cleaned and had traces of food on it, been replaced immediately by server.
The menu will start with inspiring story the Chef Joy Banerjee. The pages corner of the menu was soiled, torn and tattered like we find in street side dhabas. On going through the menu the uniqueness behind dishes will make one confuse about what to order.

Sorted it down to 
- Gondhoraj Julep
- Chili Pickle n Cheese Baked Crab with Kolmi Greens
- Vodka soaked Prawns with Grilled Garlic Aioli
- Joyous Mutton Chops
- Spicy Grilled Bhetki with Radhuni enriched curry sauce
- Stir Fried Prawns with muddled grapes and chilies
- Bacon wrapped Chicken supreme bundles with Aam Kashundi reduction
- Malpua Cheese Cake
- Spiced Mango Soufflé
- Death by Chocolate

Each and every dish has its unique flavour and there will be no similarity among them. Amazing fusion of Bengali food with international taste. Its recommended after each dish wash it down with Gondhoraj Julep to reset your taste buds prior trying the other dish. 
In starters baked crab and mutton chops will surely make any foodie crazy. Couldn't understand why prawn is called vodka soaked as there was no such flavour registered by my nervous system. 
In main course the dish was so full of flavours but I found the proportion of rice is very less compared to amount of gravy been served. 
In desserts one must try Malpua Cheese Cake and Death by Chocolate. Mango Soufflé lacks the spiciness as claimed in the menu.
They don't serve normal filtered water but bottled mineral water which they sell as per MRP. But this is unfair trade practice for a restaurant to charge customers for bottled drinking water and having no other provision for drinkable filter water.
The restaurant cannot be called casual dinning because of its steep pricing but can't be called fine dining too due to its infrastructure or poor service. Had high hopes prior visiting here but bit disappointed now. Bill amount came to INR 4243 with taxes. 
Would request Chef Joy Banerjee too look into these gaps in their services as it will be shame if people stops paying attention to this restaurant due to bad word of mouth even after having so many great innovations in the menu.

This was an amazing and unforgettable meal. Right from the deviled mushrooms, potato noisettes, and crab bakes to the desserts. Imaginative, thoughtful, detailed, simple and yet elegant. We started with gondhoraj juleps. Simply delicious. I love how the chef has chosen local produce and cuisine and notched it up. What stood out for us was that the highest quality of ingredients were used for every dish. Very impressive and humble. Going back to the food, the devilled mushrooms were yummy. The spicy sweet sauce was deceptive and mouth watering. The potato noisettes looked plain and didn't promise much. Yet the moment you eat one, there is an explosion of flavours in your mouth. The cheesy mustard crab with kolmi greens was okay. It came highly recommended but I found it to be a bit overrated. We them  ordered the prawn gondhoraj. Superb and inspired. Very simple and smooth. The gondhoraj zest made it interesting. The prawns were super fresh and cooked to perfection. The Bhetki version was equally good. The chicken tetrazini was authentic and tasty. The veggie melange in spicy alphonso was delightful and was a favourite. We wrapped up with the guramel custard made from nolen gur. Heaaaaven!!!!! The gondhoraj mousse was very light and flavourful. The malpua cheesecake was okay. Again came highly recommended but fell short of my expectations. The cheesecake had very little cheese and seemed like it was made out of whipped topping. Also it could have tasted more like a kheer. A bit more fennel in the malpua would've been nice too. But that's my opinion. 

Overall we enjoyed the meal thoroughly and will never forget it. A few recommendations to operations. Turn down the music because it's just too loud. Manage service better. It's a bit scattered and it shows. It's a very small space and very busy which is great but everyone was sitting way too close together. No privacy and very uncomfortable. Space it out just a little bit. The automatic door is annoying and slow.

Otherwise big thumbs up!!!

We were 4 friends and ordered everything from drinks and staters to dessert. The crab cakes are a must ! As is tea in their special tea pot ! In main course the pizza and the bhetki stole the show.

Be sure to ask them for the day's special - they have a great variety of prawns and fish! 

We finished with a chocolate dessert and home made ice creams. Will surely visit again.

I try and make it a point to visit Bohemia every time I visit Kolkata and keep reccomending this place to one and all. The food here is outstanding.... It's definitely very very different  and extremely tasty. I love the coriander garlic keema wrap and bhetki with pickled chillie and cheese . Every dish on their menu is awesome... It's difficult to choose a dish as " a must try".....However bhetki in Berry sauce and the chicken stragnoff are my favorites . If you are a vegetarians you have plenty of options. 
This is a tiny place and I love the decor.reservation reccomended as seating capacity is not much.. And the place is usually packed.

Very Rude unhelpful staff. Waiter do not respond even when called multiple times. No infrastructure for kids like high chair etc. which was very important for us as we visited with 2 kids. The only thing staff is keen on is to keep place clean which is best possible with least effort, by having no patrons visit. Food takes forever to bring and is very average, comparable to many cheaper continental restaurant. I will not recommend this lace to anyone.

I visited Bohemian with a bunch of very 'picky' gourmets - it is a testament to the quality of the place that each of us loved the food and service! Starting from the vodka prawns starter to the excellent mains including jumbo prawns in chilli pickle & cheese sauce and pabda rolls, the chef has done wonders with traditional Bengali fare with a modern twist! The service was impeccable and we finished with some interesting masala mango mousse and malpua cheesecake. The gondhoraaj sherbets were also pretty decent. The restaurant is pretty small and I would suggest booking a table if you are going on a public holiday or for dinner.

Tried the spicy pork curry, the Royal mutton and the abyss. All must tries. Even the mango and honey sorbet is excellent. The service however has a few flaws that are better experienced than written about. Nothing that can't be ironed out. The place could do with a flamboyant maitre de.

Came here for the first time expecting a lot (after reading the reviews posted ). Unfortunately. I was thoroughly disappointed right from the start.  I came to celebrate a  special occasion with my sweetheart. Trust me when I say this,  the service guys needs to learn manners and courtesy. They just fiddled around like useless creatures trying only to irritate us.
Food was average,  the ones we chose were not available. 

Very few pork dishes were available. Prawn options were there in their menu card,  but with limited availability. 

Just the music made us feel cosy n comfortable; otherwise it was quite expensive,  given the quality they serve here.

Good place to go if you are fed up with the same kind of bengali food cooked anywhere in Calcutta... We can call the cuisine Continental Bengali.... The portions are good, at first u might want to order for an extra rice but honestly, after having the amount given by them u will not ask for more, but that also depends on ur appetite. The ambience is good and the service is OK. The food is good and a person can go there once.

Let's just start with saying that the visit to Bohemian was legend-waitforit-dary. Food is one word is- Incredible! Starting our palette with Gondhoraj sorbet and Joyous mutton chops, it was heavenly. Specially the sorbet was amazing. Then we dig in our way to chicken salad which was equally refreshing and light. But spotlight was taken away by the main course which was classic roasted chicken with mushroom sauce, mashed potatoes, rolls and sautéed veggies. Well cooked chicken with delicious sauce, it was like a fair in my mouth. One plate is enough for a two. Last but not the least, it was the dessert Malpoya cheesecake which took our breath away. In true sense, it was orgasmic. Layered of delicious malpoya between the light, aromatic cheesecake was amazing. Overall one of the finest restaurants in Kolkata, Bohemian is a MUST try for everyone. It's a place I would love to visit again and again.

Bohemian was in my wish list for ages... somehow was not able to make it to this quintessential restaurant for a long time. The day i visited i was pretty excited as i heard so much about this place and being a foodie the very thought of fusion Bengali food was quite intriguing. Located in a corner of Bondel road it is a three-four storeyed building which has been transformed into a restaurant. The entrance is simple yet very colourful and vibrant and gives you a very good vibe. The decor on the first floor is nothing gawdy or flashy. The wooden tables and chairs are very simple yet elegantly covered with colourful cushions. As we entered and took our seats we were offered wet tissue papers to freshen up. Then came the menu folder... i was just even more thrilled this time. We were four of us including my hubby who's another foodie and my parents who are foodies who eat only fish. The starter we ordered was Murshidabi veg shaslik. Ooofff it was yummy!!! The cottage cheese just melted in our mouth and the bengali aroma in it made it all the more tasty. Next we ordered was spicy grilled bhetki with berry sauce, Bacon wrapped chicken, sizzled bhetki with garlic. All the items were unique in their own way. On the desserts we tried the Panchphoron Mouse; consuming it was amazing experience. Never did mouse taste so Bengalishly Tasty :p The cold beverages like Magic potion is a must try. The Gondhoraj Julep will refresh you instantly with its flavour and aroma. The service was also excellent. Overall a must visit place if you are a foodie and loves to experiment. Bohemian has taken bengali food to a higher level altogether. The zeal of implementing your idea into reality when it comes to experimental cuisine is in itself praiseworthy. A thumbs up to the entire team of Bohemian for their effort and perseverance.

Well Bohemian is simply one of the most stylistically urban restaurant in the city. The concept of fusion food is what makes it unique and interesting. I visited it sometime back this year and I would say it was a fairly pleasant experience with such great interiors and service. I am convinced of the fact that these people know what they are doing. Though it might be a hard thing to appreciate the taste as the cuisine is so very experimental and progressive. Regular Bengali customers might just think why would they pay so much in something that tastes so similar to home cooked food. But that is absolutely a mistake. Chef Joy and his team are really trying to do something new for the generation that is ready to experience the taste of their homemade food fused with the taste of a far away land. A must visit if you are able to raise your budget a bit high.
My favourite : baked crab. Try it. You will want more.

I had heard and read a lot about Bohemian. I was waiting to visit someday as the idea of beautifying and fiddling with Bengali cuisine seemed to me to be an impossible task.  
My husband was a darling and took me there for my birthday dinner. That was a huge delight. It took a while to locate the place but the first sight of the sweetly lit facade was warm and inviting. The multi coloured lanterns and the dark solid wood furniture, jewel toned silk cushions tied with floral printed ribbons was so elegant.
On reading the menu I was horrified to read some of the combinations and wondered whether I had the guts to actually eat anything at all! But, I saw the other patrons tucking away and enjoying themselves so I decided to make an effort. We ordered the Abyss - a seafood salad and bacon wrapped prawns. These arrived with a mangooey, orangey mayonnaise which defies description. Suffice to say it was like manna from heaven. The salad was OK but the wrapped prawns were divine.
We moved on to the main course where I ordered pan fried bhetki in Bengal berry sauce. I had no idea what the Bengal berry was , and the waiter kindly explained it was kul'er aachaar!! My son ordered bacon wrapped chicken in sauce and my hubby sent for another fish dish with coriander and full bodied mustard. My friend ordered a kheema pie. 
My first taste of the sauce was intense. It was sweet and savoury and flavoursome. Each morsel was delicious. The fish was perfectly cooked. It was soft and flaked off at the mere touch. By the time I finished I was hooked, and knew that I was going to return to try each dish!! 
The kheema pie was smooth and indescribably tasty. The fish in mustard was potent yet not overpowering. The wrapped chicken was crisp yet blended just perfectly bin the smooth sauce.
For dessert we shared the death by chocolate! This was my son's choice. It was just unbelievable... Rum and chocolate! How can you go wrong? By the time dinner was through I was a follower!! Bohemian, I will be there again and again!!

I was really intrigued to try the fusion theme of this 'Bong' restaurant, and so went there for lunch last Sunday. My friend and I tried Abyss from their salads and Spicy pork curry with wonderful mocktails to keep our palates company. The service was excellent and helpful and the food a wonderful experience. I'm looking forward to tasting their various other intriguing offerings. However the decòr was not really to my taste and hence was not feeling too comfortable. But other than that, the restaurant lives up to its name. And yes, reservation is highly recommended.

We had "Cottage nuggets with aam kasundi" from Appetiser , "Abyss" from salad .After that we tried one Sarbet .All these were extremely delicious.The reason why i didn't give 5 rating is their Main Course.Like Appetiser and salad the Main Course items didn't impress me much.Bhetki item was so so.Chicken Tetrazzini was also good but not impressive.Fusion is the main reason why you should visit this place.

Its imaginative,chic, yet scrumptious, indulgent and leaves your platter completely satisfied!! Don't miss the panchphoron chicken escallops, vodka soaked prawns, bhetki simmered in pickled garlic, malpua cheese cake.....this list is never ending........the crux is dont miss anything on the menu.......the food here is truly impeccable.

Visited the place today for lunch to celebrate Diwali. Gone through so many reviews on this restaurant before landing up there. I'm really impressed by their cuisine. 
Small place but good and attractive decor. Service is quite fast. Staffs are well behaved and quite knowledgeable about their food. Ambiance is excellent... 
Now coming to the food part.. 
Just awesome.. Incredible.. All the dishes are mouth watering indeed. Their starters/main course and dessert, all are complimenting each other. I have never had this kind of fusion food before. 
Errors : Over priced and size of table is bit smaller.
But this restaurant is creating a magic... If you are real food lover, then pls don't think twice just go and have the experience.. 
" Bohemian" see you soon.

Was there with my friend as my usual hunt for good eating places continue. So we went all fishy this time, ordering The Abyss Salad and a Bhetki dish my friend took. A well prepared salad still remains an art seldom perfected. And The Abyss was every bit yummy. It had prawns, bhetki, crabmeat mixed in fresh veggies and prepared in mustard mayo. For dessert we had the house recommended souffle which was YUM! The staff were cordial, complementing the lovely time spent there. Can't wait to go back for more.

Grilled mutton chops with mushrooms and spicy red wine jus.

The price was bit in the higher side. But the food was great. Our bill amount was Rs. 4485 /-

This a really a must try restaurant.

Went to this place as insisted by my friend and I am really thankful to him now. I ordered 'Panchphoron flavored Chicken Escallops' and 'Mutton and Cherry Tomato Skewers' as appetizers. Then 'Bacon wrapped Chicken Supreme' in main course. Finally 'Malpua Cheesecake' in dessert. Each of the items were unique and ofcourse of great taste. The joint is not very spacious but has a clean and pleasant ambiance. Price is little bit on higher side but still Bohemian is a must try.

Brilliant concept, brilliant food. Never thought continental and bengali cuisine could blend so well! The baked crab meat with kolmi greens appetiser was absolutely lipsmacking (comes from a person who isn't too fond of crab meat in general). In mains,  you have to have it to believe that bacon wrapped chicken could work in a aam kashundi gravy! Add to that the amazing decor of the place -  from strings of imitation steel weapons of ma durga upholding bangaliana  to the spray painted graffiti in the washroom celebrating the bohemian spirit. Also loved the fact that Chef Joy Banerjee was personally handling the mad rush of nabami diners, pacifying the ones waiting and suggesting dishes to others. Overall an amazing experience. Looking forward to visiting the place over and again (I have my eyes on the appetizer menu!!)

This finally gets off my wishlist..hav heard so much about this place that i could not resist myself for long and finally picked a day to dine in here with my family. To begin with, the ambience of this restro was classy and sophisticated. I liked it. They've extended to the first floor,which solves the space problem to a great extent. Now coming to the food,we wanted to try their signature dishes. So as suggested by the waiter we decided to settle for sizzled bhetki simmered with pickled garlic,prawn simmered with gondhoraj lemon and bacon wrapped chicken supreme bundles with aam kashundi reduction. Personally the fish item stood out for me. The other two were equally good though.Just one thing i'd like to mention here is that the rice served with the dishesh was really less in quantity.we had to order an extra plate of rice. Other than that,i had no complaints. Also they really kept up to the word ''FUSION''. What amazing combination of bengali and continental food,simply mindblowing.Thumbs up !!!

I am quite a fan of this restaurant. Whenever I come to Calcutta for the last few years, I go there.  
Their speciality is fusion Bengali food- fusion between modern bengali and traditional bengali. 
Different types of condiments, lentils and green vegetables are used with other conventional vegetarian and non - vegetarian items to produce delectable dishes by Chef Joy. 
Located in a small lane from Bondel road near Ballygunge fnaRi, it's not difficult to find. This time I found that an upstairs sitting arrangement has been added. Elbow space is not too bad, but could be improved. It has improved the ethnic canteen look of the yore a bit.
Service is prompt and with a smile. Servers are smart and suggests good options. 
Appearances may deceive but cost is of top tier. INR 2500 for two people is easily topped. Portions are good for one person only.
No drinks is available.
Reservation is definitely recommended. 
This time, I ordered a Pork fried item as a starter which was just stunning- four medium pieces of fillet. Then my partner ordered a parshe with panchforon which was so so. I had a superb crab and Prawn preparation- simply outstanding. I had Malpua- Cheesecake, disappointed by it as the Malpua portion was microscopic, and after being a regular at the Cheesecake factory, all others does seem a bit dim in comparison. My partner had a chocolate dish which was good enough. 
Overall, it's costlier than other places, considering that it is not a fine dining restaurant. But for innovative ideas and fantastic execution of fusion pure bengali items this place stands alone. 
Recommended for interested connoisseurs.

My experience at Bohemian was one of the best till date. Whether it was the service or the innovation in food or most importantly the food itself: Each of its made for a unique gastronomic delight with the marriage of unusual ingredients. Baby potatoes simmered with orange and coriander with its sweet flavour might not be everybody's call but once it concords with your taste bud you would want to polish off the entire dish. We also ordered foil baked bhetki and spicy grilled bhetki where the former stood as the clear winner. 
The gondhoraj serbet and tender coconut refresher both provided the perfect escapade from the Kolkata heat. But it was Gondhoraj serbet that I would recommend. 

P.S. The malpua cheesecake is a must try especially for the understated elegant food styling!!!..:)

Successful innovation is how i would like to describe Bohemian...in the clutter of chinese and north indian reataurants in Kolkata, this one is unique...

Visited on thr day of Durga Saptami and we made prior reservation for 8 peiple....the staffs are courteous and the restaurant decor is minimalistic as they focused more on the food....we started with cheese baked crab and it was ecstatic...very distinct flavour and we had to reorder the item...we tried tge panchforon escellops which was good, stir fried betki with mustard and coriander - delicious and chicken stired with mango which we liked and reordered but they served us pomegranate and mustard sausages which was ok...for the main course we ordered spicy grilled betki with radhuni enriched curry sauce - awesome and the quality of the fish was a-class...chicken supreme tossed witg pomegranate and spicy mustard which was brilliant with slightly tangy amd sweet flavour - brilliant, chicken in envelope a form of our own machher paturi - it was rich in mustard flavour and was a little spicy...we also ordered stir fried mutton with brown onion...for dessert we ordered all in the menu except death by chocolate...we found malpua cheesecake to be the best...

Ee ordered gondhoraj julem and sex on the beach where both scored perfect....

The main course dishes came with rice which was sufficient....

We were a little apprehensive as the quality of food declines during pyja but the quality was awesome in their case...

A must for all the food lovers and kudis to Chef Joy for gifting the city of Joy with such delicacies...

A very interesting play of old world Bengali spices paanch phoron, radhuni, cooking styles muitha paturi to create an entirely new range of dishes. The cliqued mutton kosha etc was given a completely refreshing flavour of the Gandhoraj lebu, the King of Lime from Bengal in the Mutton Drumstick Stew. Again the desserts were a cracker, nice plating loved the accompanying sauces with the desserts. Chef Joy you cracked it. Just work on ambience and table setup. We were expecting a slightly more upmarket experience. Your captains were very well informed about the dish making for an interesting conversation

They say a gastronomic trip to Kolkata isn't really complete without a visit to this place. After beer and munchies elsewhere, a spur of the moment decision landed us here. It's the home of experimental cuisine, they say. And a glance at the menu will confirm that. We ordered Chicken and red seasonal leaves with pickled garlic envelope. Yup, that's quite a mouthful, isn't it? And Crabs in green chili and coconut cream. Overwhelmed again? Not surprised. And then Pan Shocked Bhetki simmered in pineapple and cumin. Phew! I'm just glad I rattled off these without many errors (hopefully!). Coming to the dishes, they were designed to shock and awe, but didn't really win me over. The invasion caused headlines, but didn't take out the mobs to cheer. And that was the quibble. The malpua cheesecake, again a novel concept, struck me for its originality but didn't make me feel over the moon with it's taste. Do come here... It gets boring with standard formulaic menus. But do not expect five star Bukhara/Cheb/Malhotra stuff here. At least not yet. A piece of good news is that they have added to capacity; more floors and consequently more tables.

Recommended by a friend, we went to Bohemian for a quiet family lunch today. With the Durga Pujo hangover far from being over, we had to wait for some time before we could get a table. Bohemian encompasses two floors, and isn't really spacious. The decor is pretty simple and easy on the eyes.

Coming to the quality of the food, its one of the best I have tasted. Maybe we just got lucky in the selection of items, but each item was sumptuous, be it the chicken, the fish, or the mutton. 

This place is a must visit for foodies in Kolkata. The only fault - the closely placed tables.

This place definitely gives a whole new twist to Bengali food!  We started off with some appetizers and drinks. The waiters suggested that we try out Keema Vindaloo with Papri chips and Jumbo Prawns. We really liked the keema vindaloo. The starters were complemented by Ghondhoraj Jule, Sex on the Beach and Green Mango Cola. The beverages werent really impressive though. For the main course we ordered for Bacon Wrapped Chicken with Aam Kashundi, Spicy grilled Bhetki with Radhuni curry sauce, Sizzled Bhetki simmered with pickled garlic. All these were served with steamed rice and veggies. They were delicious. For dessert we ordered for Gondhoraj Suffle which was again really good. 

The service is a bit slow, but they will definitely help you out if you have a tough time choosing which dish you want to have.

I felt that the food was a bit overpriced compared to the quantity. maybe the management can look into this. Otherwise a good place to have a grand and filling lunch/dinner!

We went during pujas and this place has struck from moment one. Right from the decor comprising of steel weapons of the Goddess to the fluid beats of dhak all reverberating around, this place defines contemporary bangaliana ( as it says) to its very core.
The food is insane to say the least. The crab with kolmi leaves is a dish to die for. I followed it up with parshe fillets and a malpua cheesecake for dessert. The dishes left us finger licking stuck. 
This place is one of the best restaurants of this city, if not the best. A delight to be there.

Dinning anywhere is not just about the food, but it is about the experience as a whole. My friend and I had a very pleasant experience at Bohemian today.

The food was amazing. I would have to give added cookie point for the presentation and the ambiance of the place. One particular aspect which impressed me the most is that, when we arrived at Bohemian, it had closed for the day, but they specially let us in and gave us proper service. Bohemian has won my heart.

Was at Mandarin today for lunch with family. The place was almost empty when we came and got good attention. Very nicely done up interiors. Food tastes a bit different. Won't say out of the world. Portions are very less. Probably not enough to feed 1 person. But the Bhetki that was served was real Bhetki and not the usual basa version. Bacon wrapped chicken was nice. Overall OK experience. 
Main cons I would say is the quantity served for that price.

Recently opened on the first floor, the interiors are compile with vivid hints of bright colours in chair seats, napkins and lampshades. The ground floor gallery has been converted to a boho painted graphitti wall with bamboo sticks tied with bright colour cloth, lending a character to the place.

We had the devilled mushrooms (veg), the corn and spinach wraps and the fragrant dream salad. Each dish comes with its unique dip adding to the flavour. In my previous visits, I've also tried the Lemon Chicken on Chicken Skewers which is lightly flavoured with gondhoraj lending a distinguished taste to an otherwise boring dish.

If you are looking to have a refreshing drink the Gondhoraj Julep is a must try.

The desserts however do not cut any ice with me. On various occasions I've had the malpua cheesecake and it has never got enough flavour or the cheesecake has been harder than usual cheesecakes. 

Consistent great food, great ambience, lovely music and superb service sum up the experience at Bohemian.

If you are ready to try out dishes you've never heard of then this is the right place for you !!! bengali delicacies cooked with a twist, this fusion is definitely something you'll love !!! Each and every dish I tried out was outstanding !!! I love the way they have used simple bong ingredients like bodi and shaak to make amazing accompaniments !!! 

ambience- neat, cafe type look, with an artistic old day charm!!

food- awesome !!! you should definitely try the mustard bhetki (don't remember the name) , lamb chops, a potato dish and and and never ever think that the accompaniments with your dish is bizarre coz they just sound bizarre in reality they go so well with the dishes !!! loved the bodi pilaf !!!

overall experience- twist of taste that makes you extremely happy

This is one place which I
would recommend to anybody who has a taste for Bengali fusion food. Hats off to
the chefs who can produce a delectable blend between chicken, cheese and parsley to produce those succulent shashlik chicken sticks starters or a unique
fusion between soft prawns cooked in  cream
and aam kasundi. Every dish seemed to have a touch of innovation and
out-of-the-box thinking, be it the cottage cheese nuggets, crab cooked in fresh
cream with a touch of cheese and parsley or even vetki cooked with bengal berry
(kooler aachar :)). Mocktails like Magic Pineapple are also worth trying. A
thump up to desserts like cheese malpoa too. Indeed the chef seems to go
Bohemian with his application and mixture of ingredients and spices. I would
definitely give a 5 on 5 to this place for the food, quality, service and
tasteful decor. They can even add a special personal touch on birthdays.
Bohemian rocks !!!

Bohemian was an experience in itself. It has a minimalistic decor and yet there was a serene and tranquil ambience inside that made me comfortable the moment we stepped in.

Was a bit skeptical while ordering Panchforon flavoured chicken escallops but it proved me wrong on all aspects. The very smell was so tempting but the amount of panchforon flavor on it was bang on target. It had just the right amount of the spice and the chicken was soft and succulent. 

I preferred the Mint and coriander sorbet to the Gondhoraj one but that was due to my individual liking towards the very refreshing flavor of mint.

Then came the Prawns stewed with spicy Alphonso Cream. It was heaven. The prawns were tender and was very fresh which was evident from its inherent aroma. But the gravy was to-die-for. Even reminiscing it makes me drool and if I go back to visit Bohemian again it will be because of this dish.
My friend had ordered the bacon wrapped tilapia and even he couldn’t complain. From the moment food was served we hardly had the urge to talk- the food just shut us up!
To finish it off there malpua cheese cake which was good but a bit overrated,I would say. 

Décor: 2.5/5

Service: 4/5

Food: 5/5


Will definitely be visiting again with more friends and family.

The most outstanding food you can imagine. Wonderful Bengali cuisine with a twist of Med - Chef Joy does magic with his food. Small place, so book a couple of hours ahead - otherwise you may have to wait 15-20 mins. Does not serve alcohol, but with food like this, equally matched with nice friendly service, no one would ever care. My favorite things to eat (not in any particular order)

- Steamed Bhetki
- Baked crab (my favorite starter)
- Bacon wrapped prawns
- Lamb chops
- Radhudi enriched bhetki (my favorite)
- Panchporan spice bhetki
- Bengal roast mutton

Wash it down with a Gondoraj Julep.
You will remember this meal for a very very long time.. :))

One of the best restaurants in India. Period. 

The magic they have created with seemingly disparate elements (bacon and telapia, for example) is quite amazing. And every item on their menu is delicious. So, no recommendations but only one advice: please reserve tables since they operate out of a very small space.

Don't know about the food. Walked in with a lot of expectation , along with my wife and 13 month old kid. Ushered in inside and then rudely evicted since no table we apparently free and the ones seemed free are already booked. Understandable. 
But, not understandable is that being ushered in and then being told rudely "that no table is free and you have to wait OUTSIDE" (The tone was like wtf why are u inside?!?!?)
Don't mind waiting as long as it's conveyed properly and waiting list managed in a professional manner.
Not done! I reckon it's the 4.3 rating on zomato that gives them the leeway to be this hamhanded. 
Warning : Have seen many restaurants plummet from their 4+ ratings owing to their service.

We ordered something called chicken mushroom devil which was amazing. For drinks we ordered sex on the beach,  a mint drink and my favourite magic slush. 
For the main course we ordered two chicken dishes and one fish dish. I didn't like the pomegranate chicken much but liked the one which came with fried rice.  The fish was yum. 
Would love to go back again. 
Thumbs up for the fusion.

Quite living up to its name, Bohemian is indeed an amusing change from the usual and the menu is sometimes too wild for the imagination. However, through hits n misses one can try out the platters on offer, and can be assured that mostly they are all quite enjoyable, n the misses would only be a few. The platters are quite a plateful in quantity and the staffs are very helpful with their suggestions. The place is quite small, the crowd on weekends at times is overwhelming comparatively, and the wait is too long. The aada mouri mangsho, or kancha lanka mangsho are quite good, so is the bacon wrapped chicken with aam kasundi reduction, so the grilled bhekti. For the less adventurous there's a lot of options from the known brigade as well, and they are all good value for money. Overall the experience is neat. Thumbs up for this novel venture!!

After visiting the place many of my notions somehow got changed.
I always thought I have a taste for good food, be it fusion or regional. But after the visit to bohemian it changed. With respect to the ratings one get to see here I thought too highly of this place and obviously expected too much.
Alas I dint like it!
Fusion may be attractive for many.
I dint like pomegranate with chicken and a few much dishes !
Quantity wise not anything great
Chocolate mousse was Ok.
Ambience and serving courtesy good.
Pricing: for what they serve I feel thats exorbitant ! (For 3 of us it was 2800INR)

I will sum up my experience as different and interesting but you must be open to experiments. Like we ordered Bacon Wrapped Prawns for appetisers, and it was perfectly soft and served with a delicious sauces that had a sweet taste to it. Then directly to the main course, we ordered one of both Pan Braised Bhetki with Aam Aada Sauce and Stir Fried Prawns with muddled Grapes and Sauce. Both the dishes comes with sufficient amount of rice and while the first one comes with baked veggies, the second one comes with "karmi" saak in a new avatar. The sauces are tasty and to quote my vegetarian friend, "the Aam Aada Sauce has a prominent flavour" to it. She had Cheese stuffed Mushroom cups with Radhuni enriched Curry Sauce and didn't seem to complain.. But wait, I am yet to mention the best part, Malpoa Cheesecake and Gandhoraj Soufflé, deserts always light up my mood instantly and these fusion deserts did the same. The former was served nicely (I regret that I don't have any pictures) while the latter could have been served in a better fashion. Nevertheless I am glad I tried both of them.

Décor is pretty decent with frames and postcards hanging and the only place I guess where you are welcomed with wet tissues and you cannot complain about the service either. The only con I guess that it is little more to the "pocket-burning" side.

A long wish at last got materialised on a saturday afternoon when me and my girl friend decided to go out for lunch at Bohemian. I booked a table for two in the morning as was recommended here. We reached the restaurant at 1.30 in the afternoon and had no difficulty in finding the place. 

First impression of the place doesn't give you a grand feeling but the welcome notes does. We were served with cold towels and chilled mineral water. (Note the outlet serves mineral water by default). Since we were unsure of the quanity of the dish, we asked the waiter to help us in deciding the number of apetizers. He suggested two - hence ordered Bacon wrapped Prawn and Joyous Mutton Chops which is probably the most talked about dish. The quantity of each were more than enough for two as appetisers, not sure why he suggested two. We also ordered mocha slush and mint julep as drinks to go with our food. 

On main course, we ordered Bacon wrapped Chicken in Aam Kashundi reduction and Grilled Mutton Chops with Mushrooms and Spicy Red wine.  Having no idea on the quantity, the order again became too heavy for two of us. The chicken comes with Rice while the mutton comes with Garlic Bread and mashed potato. Had no rooms for dessert after having eaten so much. 

I, personally, was not anticipating anything. The cuisine in itself is a mixture of Italian and Bengali food. The outlet will surprise you on every dish that you order. And sometime might let you down as well. I cannot say that I just love the food but shouldn't doubt it either. I did like the mutton dishes a lot but the surprising preparation had still left me confused. I will surely visit this outlet again and this time be very specific in choosing the items. And, hopefully, will be able to counter the elememt of surprise.

As they say all big things come in small packages. The restaurant may seem small a bit of a fight to get your seat, but once the food starts reaching your table, the irritation of waiting floats away into oblivion. The ambience is different to say the least and prepares you for the delectable cuisine coming your way. The starters like the prawns wrapped in bacon is just the beginning and as the food keeps coming your taste buds are treated to something new and distinct. The flavours are a mix of bengali and international cuisine making everything taste known and yet quite unknown. It's ideal to order plates of different items and take a few bites from each other to enjoy maximum number of dishes. Finally wrap it up with a cheesecake stuffed with malpoa to really enjoy the meal. The finest places to eat in if you love being a quirky foodie!!

Excellent food. The concept of fusion food is deliciously presented. Worth the wait after ordering the food, and worth the price. A definite must visit.

This is a small place off Ballygunge Phari and has been around for only 3 years. But the food is so good everyone who has been there recommends it strongly. I concur strongly now.  Chef has nailed the fusion taste. This is not too gimmicky. Let's face it - Bengalis are finicky about food. To take their cuisine and then add something new was a bold step. Too little and it would end up competing with Oh Calcutta and fail. Too much and it would be shunned like butter naan in a Bengali wedding. The balance is just right - the core taste of the food is delightfully balanced with the aftertaste which will always make one go wow. While the prawn in Alphonse cream is delightful I absolutely recommend the chicken with pomegranate. The latter was heavenly - I could easily have the gravy without the chicken. We had a couple of mock tails which were again "surprising" in a good way. Must eat place if you are not looking for comfort food.

If 'bohemian' meant an experience you wouldn't get in any other place, then the restaurant is aptly named! Chef Joy, you're one of the many pointers Kolkata should be proud of. Oh, so the rest of the country has Starbucks and hard rock cafes! Buckle up! We have Bohemian.  What you taste here, I assure you, you will never taste else where! Who makes Euro-bong fusion any better! From prawns to mutton, from aam kashundi to gondhoraj, from bacon wrapped prawns to radhuni enriched sauce, the man does it all! And how!

Every time I go here, I'm awed. You hardly care about the place being small. You love the place in spite of it! And the decor is so tasteful, it almost goes with the Alphonso cream melting away in your mouth with those succulent prawns!  And when you get to top it all with malpua cheese cake, your heart just gives in!
Anyone in Calcutta who hasn't been here, you're missing more than you can imagine. Reserve a table in advance! :)

Totally blown away by this place! I've never experienced fusion food like this before... The menu is so unusually innovative... and so is the food... And the combinations are great... I had the bacon wrapped prawns... Heavenly... The cheese baked crab with kolmi greens was so delicious that i scraped off every speck of it from the pot.. For main course... The prawns steamed in alphonso cream were so tender... Yet had such a nice sweet taste... the mutton chops in mushroom sauce and red wine was like an explosion of flavours... Fusion in true sense.. And for dessert... the malpua cheesecake and brulee were simply outstanding... Quantity wise... It's definitely pricey... But then... For this kind of food... It's justified...

Bohemian as the name sounds its a very peculiar eat out. A well maintained decor with minimalist approach. The menu showcases mostly the combination of authentic Bengali dishes in sync with continental varieties. I had one vodka flavoured grilled prawns as an appetizer and spicy bhetki and one mutton chop for main course. The food was justifiable as per it's reputation. 

Highly recommended !

Simple ambiance... Must visit for people in love of bengali as well as continental food or just eager to experience new flavors on their palate. For me it was all of the above so i loved it.

panchforan chicken escallops, vodka soaked prawns, grilled bhetki with curry and rice, mutton vindaloo, some oters as well - thumbs up

orange sorbet, green mango sorbet (overpriced), malpua cheese cake (kinda salty)

been here a few times, and the food does not disappoint. i love their eccentric combinations, and for the most part the flavours work well together. plates are beautiful, and a feast for the eyes and tastebuds. 
about a month ago, a couple of friends and i had gone over for lunch and had a great time. 
my only sort of complaint is that there was this one waiter who was a little rude, he didnt say anything, but took the straws away from the table! this was in response to us goofing around with the straws, yes. but should you piss of a customer for not even 5 rupees worth of straws? maybe he was having a bad day.

This evening we went to this beautiful joint. Usually they open at 7 in the evening but on our request they  agreed to open at 6. This was my first visit. I was impressed the moment I entered the place. The decor was sober but  very attractive and smart. The servicemen proved to be very efficient and well behaving. They helped us select the menu and explained the dishes with crisp and minimalist way but with bright smile.  And of course the wall paintings in  toilet deserve separate mention. 

And the food - sure come from heaven. Kudos to their chef. We ordered Gandhoraj Julep. An excellent beverage to start with. For starters we took chicken lemon in lemon skewers and Vodka soaked prawn.  Main courses that we sampled are bacon wrapped chicken with amkasundi., shrimp salad with love apple, ripe mango, mustard and mayo,  ham steak, grilled mutton chop, crab tetrazini. And we ended with a sublime creation - malopa cheesecake. 

Those who have not yet experienced the place are very strongly recommended to try. 

One caution. If you want to pack something  back home - remember they will pack nicely in big size paper boxes and hand you those boxes without any carry bag. That surely is a mess.

For Kolkatan's this is a new experimental restaurant. My experience with this place has been average. Visited about 6 months back. Food was very average type. Nothing to write home about. Have tasted better fusion food than this. I have forgotten the exact dishes, but I remember trying the bacon wrapped prawns (decent). The chicken wrapped in bacon at the park hotel is more delicious. We had also tried the chicken in radhuni sauce. It was quite ordinary. There was a fish item which my wife had tried, which as per her was again very ordinary.

You can give it a try once, but I would avoid a repeat visit.

When you first reach this place (follow Google maps), you are surprised by how small the place is. But the menu is eclectic and the food is really good. The desserts are also quite wow. The theme is Bengali fused with continental and chef Joy Mukherjee pulls it off with elan.
The only flip side, we had a  appointment for 8 and we were seated only at 830 and I saw another group that came after us have the same problem.

Please do not be fooled by it's façade!! This restaurant whips some some incredibly eclectic dishes..as you will find, hedonistic! And do try the gondhoraj lebu sorbet and then ...well...life's good!! The vodka soaked shrimps with the garlic sauce accompaniment are a superb twist to the usual, run-of-the-mill kinds of finger food! If you have an abyss-like belly (and a pocket to match your appetite), your lucky day! There's much to sample before you call it a day. It might be a good idea to reserve a table (and show up on time) ..it's a small place and they fill up real quick.

THE NOT SO GOOD REVIEW.
I looked up this place after some enthusiastic recommendations. And was looking forward to a great experience. I am a recent returnee to Kolkata after spending 15 years traveling the world and having great food adventures. So I was expecting something top notch. Internationally the trendy restaurants are all now independent, neighbourhood joints that are chef driven and Bohemian fits the bill. 

The Ambiance: don't mind that it is rather basic, and I guess the bad paint job provides that Kolkata touch ;)

The Menu: Blew me away, very cool conceptually

The Service: complacent, disinterested

THe Food: Overall the execution does not quite match up to the concept. Very jhaal, which again may be a Kolkata thing. 

The keema wraps were nice enough, and the sauce was morish. The Lemon stick chicken kebab thingie was soggy, underdone ? the orange mayo sauce tasted like cheap candy. Even my 5 year old refused to eat it.

The gondhoraj palate cleanser was lovely, but again the amada/orange and the green/mango tasted like cheap squash or fanta, bear in mind amada is a very delicate and refined flavour. 

The pricey shelled crab was nice to eat, but again not so special, very hot. The mutton roast tasted of not much. The pineapple souffle was OK.  At this price range I do expect more polished execution.

Would I go back? No. I would not take out of town visitors here either, Indian or foreign. 
 But for those with an adventurous palate, who like to try new things, do visit, - may be the food will be to the taste of  young Kolkatans, just venturing beyond biriyani and haldiram.

Bohemian, Ballygunj , Kolkata
Visited Bohemian some 2 years ago whilst on a short visit to Kolkata. At the behest of my S-I-L dean of English in Jadavpur and her daughter who just could not stop ranting about the place. I was told that this is a "Daroon" joint. My face fell the moment i cam e to know of Fusion. My mind juggled with gory political stories combined with Fusion Indian food from the corridors of the marxist city. My niece whispered that it was a place that was a treat to the taste buds due to its Frenchness. The place was located on Bandel road near Ballygunj Phari and hence close by to the location i stayed. So we reached the joint and had to wait for less than an hour. The place looked extremely up market with its maroon awning and awaiting clientele. We were 6 of us including my Father in Law who hardly ate and was quite amused at the hullabaloo about the joint. Must confess when in Kolkata i never experiment as i normally reconcile my taste buds to the dishes i miss in Mumbai. 
The menu was ( i confess) very exotic and Le French and was getting more and more nervous about a inevitable screwed up meal. We ordered the entree' of Panch phoron flavoured Chicken scallops at Rs. 299/- , Bacon wrapped Prawns at Rs.469/-, Joyous Mutton Chops. I started feeling more and more at home with terminologies such as Bacon, Chops, Scallops and cheese. My S-I-L whispered Chef Joy  was from Jadavpur university with pride and thus the Joyous Mutton Chops! Since my F-I-L ate in morsels and that too only fish, we ordered a Steamed Bhetki with pickled  chilli & Cheese at Rs.369/- we all shared the starters and by God i was delightfully shocked out of my wits by my tingling taste buds. This was sheer magic. The distinct flavour of panchphoron ( quintessential bong masala)  with chicken was divine and excellent. So was the smoky bacon flavour on the prawns. It was a fabulous treat. Never imagined Fusion could be so good and not annoying like Chef Blumenthal's creations. The steamed Bhetki was fresh, sweet, well cooked with cheese (who on earth could cook cheese with Fish?) which was a crème cheese not sure from where but the combination was fattafatti and I was flummoxed! Stumped!!! 
The price of each item as you notice is seductive but when you speak of quantity I guess it hurt the bong wallet. How French indeed!
The main course was a well chose one by all of us, more or less except my niece. My F-I-L surprised us by ordering a Spicy Grilled Bhetki with Radhuni enriched sauce with wilted greens and a rice spread with the quintessential bong Bori’ which was at Rs.399/-, my S-I-L ordered a Bacon baked Tilapia with ginger and fennel at Rs.399/-, My B-I-L went ahead with Prawns stewed with spicy Alphonso cream at Rs.399/- and my nephew ordered a Pork Chop with Apple sauce at Rs.429/- , whilst I went ahead with Bacon wrapped Chicken supreme bundles with Aam Kashundi reduction at Rs. 399/-. Will somebody please explain whats with 399/- being a rupee less than Rs.400/-. Chef Joy certainly mastered the art of tempering Bong spices with continental sauces and did rustle a mean British terminology or two!   
My take on this fusion mecca in Kolkata is a must visit for foreigners, foreign returned desi ( bogs have millions of this specie) for foodies, bong foodies, pati bongs and all and sundry.
Last but not the least for desert we ventured into Malpua Cheese cake at Rs 229/- , Spiced Mango suffle at Rs.199/- and my favourite “ Brulee”, the Yoghurt and kalojeere Brulee at Rs189/-. These deserts had distinct bond flavours and continental texture. My test of the pudding has always been in trying out a Brulee and this one was no less!The mango suffle had the distinct aam aer chutney flavor.
Cheers to the Bohemian and cheers to chef Joy. I am visiting Kolkata next week and will certainly visit this gastronomical joint once again without fail!!!

Ambience – 9/10 ( warm, Bright and clean)

Menu – 8/10 very continental, very Bong and very French

Taste – 9/10 Wonder on taste buds

Customer Service – 9/10

Value for Money – 7/10 this concept café atmosphere makes it expensive yet worth it.
Recommend –  Excellent , Gastronomical delight. Mecca of Bong- Continental fusion.

Fusion food at its best.We stormed into the restaurant like one pack of hungry wolves only to be disappointed with the news that the tables were all occupied and we were supposed to place our order within 10 minutes while waiting outside. We ordered 3 appetizers randomly and also one main course for each one of us. I must say BACON WRAPPED PRAWNS were amazing. The best prawn i had in Kolkata and everyone agreed. The only thing that i felt was odd, was the dip that was served with the appetizers. Believe it or not,it seemed to be the spicier version of the orange cream biscuit. 
PANCHPHORON FLAVOURED CHICKEN ESCALLOPS,LEMON CHICKEN ON LEMON SKEWERS were good as well.
Coming to the main course,we ordered seven different dishes.
I loved SPICY PORKED CURRY,STIR FRIED PRAWNS WITH MUDDLED GRAPES AND CHILLIS,MUTTON WITH YOGHURT AND PICKLED GREEN CHILLIS,BACON WRAPPED CHICKEN WITH AAM KASUNDI REDUCTION- all these dishes were rich in flavour,well cooked and served with boiled rice.However we were struggling with the bacon wrapped chicken as it was hard to cut open with a knife because of the layer of bacon Otherwise it was delicious. SIZZLED BHETKI and CHICKEN SUPREMES were good too.
I was the lucky one to have the best dish that they had to offer.
GRILLED MUTTON CHOPS WITH MUSHROOM AND RED WINE
and boy wasn't it simply amazing. No wonder it made my cousins salivate just by looking at it. Served with breads the dish looked simply delicious. Take first bite and feel like you are in a different world altogether. It was lip-smacking,finger licking good. 
We had GONDHORAJ SOUFFLE as the dessert. It was good but would have tastes better had it been a little more chilled.
Yea you guessed it right. It was a "food marathon" for us even though some of us are "on diet"..lol
BOHEMIAN...its a fusion food factory,highly recommended. Go and give your taste buds some pleasure.
Yes,don't forget to make reservations before going there.

One of my favorite restaurants in Calcutta. Everything I've tried there has been great. There are a few things I'd change (the aam kashundi reduction, for example, didn't quite work for me), but overall the place is awesome. Best pizza in town, when they have it. Also try the bacon-wrapped prawns, anything with crab in it, and the seafood salad. 
The drinks are unique. The mint cucumber refresher will make you desperately wish Bohemian had an alcohol license; it is a crime to drink this without Hendricks. You will rarely have room for dessert.

Edit: Bohemian is also quite possibly the best date spot in Cal for foodies :) Try the upstairs seating.

Yesterday i.e on  21/6/2014 visited Bohemian around 3 pm.The kitchen closes at 3.30pm.So we had to place the order while waiting outside.The concept of fusion food is innovative and it shows on the menu card.I already had a fair idea of the  menu from the zomato reviews and reccomendations.But when  you are in a group of 7 it becomes tough to decide ..rather confusing.As i heard all the platters offered by Bohemian are equally tasty and surprising ..so randomly we went on selecting the dishes.Finally after 7-8 mins we came up with the list:
Since it was already 3.30 we kept the appetisers light and didnot go for any drink.
Appetisers:
Panchphoron Flavoured chicken escallops.--Good
Lemon chicken on lemon skewers-Good
Bacon wrapped prawns.--Amazing

Main course:
Sizzled bhetki shimmered with garlic pickle--Good
Stir fried prawns with muddled grapes and chillies--Very good
Chciken supremes tossed with pomengrenate--good
Mutton with yoghurt and pickled green chillis.--Very good
Bacon wrapped chicekn with aam kasundi reduction--Very good
Spicy pork curry--Very good
Grilled mutton chops with mushrooms and red wine--Amazing

Dessert
Gondhoraj Souffle

For us it was a food marathon ..tasting a bit of all the platters...
You name any dish and we had it on the plates :) ;)Each of them had a distinct flavour but grilled mutton chops ,spicy pork and mutton with green chillies were extraordinary.
The quantity is good (one platter is more than sufficient for an individual)
Coming to taste -one word is enough "AMAZING"--Its evident from the ratings and reviews!!!!

Finally the dessert was also unique.

Am so much overwhelmed by the food that I dont want to talk about any other aspect.Its a must go for the foodies.Highly recomended!!!

Now it is very difficult to write a review for Bohemian. I have been there only once. And though it is too expensive for frequent visit I feel they deserve every penny they take and more. IT IS THE BEST RESTAURANT IN KOLKATA.

First I will do away with the trivials. The ambience is nice, but nothing to write home about. Cozy or you can say too small ( you would need to reserve seats on weekends). Smartly decorated. Comfortable and that is all. Service is good too. But then trust me, you won't remember all this once they serve you the food.

If you read the reviews in Zomato, it will just confuse you, as you will get that ALL their items are mind-blowing. And I am pretty sure they are. But you can only eat so much. And after a really difficult session of choosing what to eat, we went for the following - Bacon Wrapped Chicken Supreme bundles with Aam Kahundi Reduction and Kancha Lonka Mangsho, with of course the Gondhoraj Julep you don't want to miss.

Kancha Lonka Mangsho is a more conservative dish. It tastes awesome, the mutton was soft and succulent. The flavor of green chili filled my mouth without making the dish too hot.

But The Chicken, was one of the best chickens I have ever eaten, and I have eaten a lot. The taste is something out of this world and not to be described with mere words. Please do try this out.

A recent visit to Bohemian with a dear friend of mine was scheduled because we both were curious about their fruit-based food specially available during this season. However, both of us got suckered into ordering from their regular menu, because we roll like that. So, the bacon wrapped chicken supreme was incredible, my mocha slush sweet and perfect, her Magic Potion not too sweet and slightly tart. The garlic and coriander keema wraps were perfectly crisp, and my friend, who hates fish with a passion, ordered the Spicy grilled Bhetki with radhuni enriched curry sauce and swooned after the first bite. Only con? The TIME it took for our main course to reach us - around 40 minutes. But otherwise? A place which I come back to when I am seriously sad and disappointed with life.

The menu of Bohemian seemed quite unconventional , Bengali n Continental mix – Gondhoraj Lebu Sorbet & Gondhoraj soufflé, Vegetable Monihari with tender Coconut & Gondhoraj Lebu, Prawn Gondhora, daab items.. mutton weitha bengali hint with Mexican garnishing.
Vodka soaked Prawns with Grilled Garlic Aioli, Joyous Mutton Chops and Chilli Pickle n Cheese baked Crab with Kolmi Greens. were amazing ...loved the Grilled Bhetki with Bengal Berry Sauce. paach foron parshe with a continental dip... lol was a war front of spices
the service is not too fast considering the innovations, its okay ! 
desserts ,i generally dont take but ..Channa Cheesecake is commendable /Spiced Mango Soufflé, Mustard is a must try !

We went there on some busy monday.that place was small but nice.ambience was good.

Now come to the food,we had Cheese Baked Crab with Kolmi greens ( which was awesome.i feel the cymbals of mustard in it along with the smoothness of cheese. a 4.5 /5 dish ) as our starter. 
I had a HAIR in it which was very unfortunate. but the staffs were very apologetics. they expressed regret for that and changed that dish immediately.

We had Grilled Mutton Chops with mushroom n red wine jus (good in taste with a lot of nicely cooked mutton and three toasts and smooth smashed potatoes and tossed veggies. 4/5 ) and chicken wrapped with bacon in kasundi and mango with tossed vegetables and steamed rice (a bit sweet that i didn't like. and bacons were a bit burnt too.though taste was good. so 3.5/5. )

I don't know if going there in future or not.but for once it's worth visiting.

I have been to Bohemian a couple of times and my experiences have been mixed though largely satisfactory.
Firstly,the idea of fusion food is appealing in itself.The simple fact that you do not exactly know how your order will end up tasting like is very very intriguing.One will surely be spoilt for choice seeing the menu which has a vast range of options with an interesting description of each of the items on offer.Once you finally make up your mind they add to the anticipation and intrigue by making you wait quite a while before your food finally arrives!

About the food the first thing which needs to be recognised is that the presentation of each and every item is impeccable.The main course items come in the form of a meal with either bread or rice.Among the items I have had here,
Cheese Baked Crab with Kolmi greens-This is an absolute treat.I was skeptical about ordering this at first but the cheese the kolmi greens and the crab have been blended to near perfection in this dish.This is one of the best items I have had here.It is an absolute must have.
Joyous Mutton Chops-Succulent tender meat with a generous squeeze of lime.This is how one would describe this dish.A perfect appetiser.
Steamed bhetki with pickled cheese and chilies-this was also quite nice may be not as great as the previous two.It was similar to the Bengali paturi.
Spicy grilled Bhetki in Radhuni enriched curry sauce-very tasty without being very rich.A tasty yet simple Radhuni curry sauce to go with the steamed rice.
Pan braised Bhetki in aam adda sauce-this was a bit of a disappointment.It was a bit too bland for our taste buds,It should have been much more flavourful and tasty.The fish used in this was not of the best quality either.
Mutton & onions with green mangoes and cheese-This was also quite delightful.Tender well cooked meat in a flavorful sauce without being too rich once again.The accompanying mustard rice went perfectly.
Classic Chicken Roast-this was the most disappointing item I have had here.It was undercooked.The inside of the chicken was dry and chewy.
Grilled Mutton Chops with mushroom n red wine jus-This was quite nice in itself but it tasted very similar to the Royal Bengal Roast Mutton with Bhuna sauce.Though they were both quite good,the fact that they tasted very similar was a bit of a let down.
Among the desserts,the Malpua cheesecake and the Gondhoraj Souffle are probably THE signature items of Bohemian and for good reason too.They are both absolutely brilliant.The malpua cheesecake is simply stunning with layers of malpua in between cheesecake.The Gondhoraj Souffle is one of the most refreshing desserts one can possibly have after a good meal.

Now coming to the other aspects of the place other than the food-the place is located in the lane opposite to the lane of Pathabhavan school.It is quite a small place much smaller than one would expect considering how well renowned it actually is.The ambience and decor is quite nice and neat.The music playing in the background is also of the fusion type alternating between classic English rock and romantic songs and popular Bengali songs.
The staff are helpful and well informed about the menu.The service though is on the slower side but it does add to the whole anticipation of the place.The prices are a little on the higher side but considering the quality and the innovation I feel it is quite worth it.

Overall Bohemian is one of those one of a kind places which is surely worth a try no matter what.In spite of being let down by a couple of items,this is a place I would certainly recommend.You are sure to have a great experience!

One of the best little places in Calcutta at the moment. And it is a good restaurant for all the right reasons. The food was great, the menu itself is deliciously creative. Chosen very well, made even better and served in an extremely presentable manner. The staff, seemed capable, approachable and friendly. A simple yet memorable experience. Just one thing, maybe the walls could be made more interesting, something which will enhance the experience further.

after getting so many positive reviews from friends, finally decided to bump into bohemian. this was a saturday, nice cold breeze flowing, close friends accompanying..it was a perfect evening to have a special dinner. locating bohemian was easy, it was off ballygunge phari, on bondel road. parking was easy as well, on the main road in front of the restaurant.

heard from friends that getting a table is difficult, and hence we reserved a table before visiting. they held the reservation till we arrived, restaurant was full otherwise. it was indeed a small place, very cramped as the tables are very close to each other and moving through the space is difficult. decor was simple and the light was bright.

we ordered something to drink first since we felt thirsty and also didn't want any appetizer. in came orange-aam-ada sorbet and green mango-honey sorbet. both were mildly sweet with crushed ice in them. perfect for a summer evening.

next we ordered the main courses - sizzled bhekti with pickled garlic, chicken supreme with pomegranate and mustard, mutton vindaloo and aam diye chingri (prawn with mango). each dish was served with wilted greens and rice. rice was fine and well cooked. the bhekti preparation was the best, tasted very different than the conventional bhekti items you get in any other restaurant. the chicken was a bit more sweet than my liking due to presence of pomegranate paste in it. mutton vindaloo was a classical preparation, spicy and tasty. prawn was good two with prawn size not small at all.

after the main course, we ordered a malpoa cheesecake and mango souffle. both were very innovative and tasted great. malpoa cheese was so nice that we had to order it again. it was a cheesecake with layers of malpoa in-between = just awesome!

the staff there were very helpful in explaining the items regarding ingredients and how they are cooked so that we can make our choice correct. they also serves quick, so a brownie point for that as well.

overall, a good experience. superb food, something different than the usual bengali khana. however, they must think for expansion soon as the place is very small.

Bohemian is a must-go if you want to try some interesting and unique food. The elements like the Radhuni sauce, the Gondhoraj etc are all essentially Bengali served in a fusion Western kind of way. If you eat meat, do try the mutton with rice.. highly recommended by my friends who had it. For vegetarians,  would definitely recommend their mushrooms in radhuni sauce and their starters.

This place was so talked about and heard about it from so many people, finally visited it for lunch. The ambience is pretty neat and different and nice,well done on the whole-bright and interesting.
The menu was what caught my attention and I was totally engrossed in it, forgetting the fact that I had a friend waiting who was also hungry, after going through a whole bunch of yum , delicious names I decided on trying the chicken wrapped with bacon and cooked in kasundi and mango with vegetables and steamed rice. My friend ordered ham steak. We also ordered shrimp and mango salad from their menu which had a special festival on.

I was quite hungry and looking forward to food with a twist which I heard was Chef Joy's speciality and the salad looked awesome with greens, pieces of tender coconut,mango and shrimp, the salad dressing was excellent and it was served with 2 slices of white toasted bread with butter.The mains took a while to come, sadly ham steak was not possible and my friend stuck to classic roasted chicken with mushroom and greens. The chicken wrapped with bacon was simply heavenly with plain steamed rice and the vegetables were not overdone, it was simply food heaven, different taste and excellently made,innovative and very filling, I could not even talk, the tastes were simply divine and perfect.The chicken was well made and the mushroom sauce made it yum, tried a bit with the bread served.

This is a must visit for those who love food and innovation.
The desert was a bit disappointing, ordered alphonso mango souffle which was a bit more stiff than it should have been. The souffle could have been lighter and more fluffy, but the taste was quite nice.
The service is quite good, the staff are polite and well-trained, they were quite apologetic about the ham steak not being available.

Overall a lovely experience and will definitely visit it again with family and friends.

First off, I'm not a foodie and I am not one of a sophisticated palate. Now I like this place for a number of reasons. 

The food is incredibly interesting and the menu makes you wonder what a number of these things may taste like. I'm one of those people who find it easier to order the tried and tested often and fusion food to me is as far on the horizon as the appreciation of modern canvas artistry. To summarise, I'm weary of fusion food and don't know what to expect and that scares me sometimes. I was in here with a lovely lady friend and needless to say, I didn't want it to be a bad experience. 

Without saying much more fuzzy stuff let me give you an idea of what to expect. 

1. Book tables. I went early but man, the place packs up. Even on a Monday. 
2. The service is prompt and servers were the right amount of friendly, suggestive, prompt and helpful. 
3. You will hear a blend of classic rock and variety of music from the 90s and a few from the next decade. 
4. The place is relatively tiny and gets a bit cramped but it's really not that bad if you are not an XXL and you're sharing a table with someone pleasant and interesting. 
 
Now. Food.

5. Mocktails were refreshing. Tastes better than it reads on the menu. I'd have tried all of them had I not come for a proper dinner. 
6. Appetisers were very tasty. Not too oily, spicy or too much of anything really that overpowered another. 
7. Mains. This was tough choice because it was all so interesting. Trust the recommendation of the server and be bold. Don't be that guy(like me) who thought he'd be better off with a chicken tetrazzini. 
8. Desserts. They're not kidding. They know exactly what they're serving and they make it very well. A most lovely end. It was light, not too creamy, the tastes were balanced.

A conservative close minded first time participant was exposed to what looked like crazy at first but ended up being an exercise on appreciating the more enjoyable and pleasant surprises that it can deliver. However, id keep my weary on for most fusion places. This one However was a most enjoyable experience in Uncharted gastronomic landscapes for my senses. 

I'm not one to write reviews, but I believe you should go here if you are bold, like to experiment and can handle difference. As I see it, Chef Banerjee operates in what may look like a nondescript suburban side street but this fails to capture his own boldness, vision and execution to explore preparations that may surprise at first, but will not leave you regretting the choice you made to come to Bohemian. You came for something beyond rigid descriptions and set menus, you came to destroy definitions, because you are an explorer at heart and like me, you came because you wanted to understand the world beyond Chicken Tetrazzini.

A 4.5 because ONLY nothing is perfect. 

Cheers!

This one was on my wish list for a long time! Somehow finally I found myself sitting in bohemian for lunch and trust me, it was worth it. I started with chilli pickle and cheese baked crab cakes and they were one of the best I had ever had. Then we had a palate cleanser mango sorbet which was followed by stir fried prawns with muddled grapes an chillies. The deser t was death by chocolate. This place is going to take lots of trips to do justice to the menu. Definitely worth your while...

i don't know where to start. this place is just too good to describe.. the entire time like for 1:30 hours while i was eating the food, i was in a trance state..every dish, every bite, was beyond imagination it was so friggin good.the outlet is a bit place, limited number of tables , but who cares when the food is so amazingly good. when i came out of the restaurant i just thought what the hell happened back thre., total FOODGASM...we were 6 people and it was our first time..so the menu looked a bit confusing..we dint know what to eat coz of the variety of food and concoctions..the service is extremely good..so the waiter helped us through the entire menu. we started with a thirst quencher- gondharaj  julep it was amazing..every sip was refreshing , its like taking a dive into some refreshing lake with gondhoraj lebu .for main course we ordered many dishes the best of all was the cheese and prawn with green mango...i mean like what the hell that like an explosion of cheese and prawn flesh in your mouth ,prawns were huge  and fresh amazingly fleshy,then tried the mutton dish forgot the name with bed rolls , amazing again, i chose the bacon wrapped chicken.. and it was amazinggggg.. what could you want more theres bacon, thres chicken and the curry tasted like bacon..which was pretty good., but do not ,and i repeat myself DO NOT LEAVE BOHEMIAN without trying out their garlic bread. wtf! is that is that garlic bread...pizza hut your doing it wrong..im telling you....the amount of cheese and spices in the cheese makes it so amazingly good. and for desert it had to be malpua cheesecake ,coz im a cheesecake fanatic so it was amazing done, the presentation was so good and taste too amazingly different and amazingly good.

Visited this little space only on recommendation by Zomato. Was in the area, had been to Kolkata after many years & wanted authentic bengali food. Searched for nearby joints & used the map - that was perfect.The food was good here but not really authentic bengali, I feel. For the Local people, this must be interesting as all the dishes are with a twist here. But if you are coming from outside & wish to have authentic bengali, like me - not really the place. I still say, the food was good. I would call them continental Bengali food!!

Bohemian is everything I want in a restaurant wrapped in one with a neat ribbon on top. First the décor is really classy with post cards of rolling stones, Abba, Madonna, Pink Floyd, Beatles, Dylan along with a very tasteful choice of music English Bengali and Hindi. 
I have been to Bohemia twice first we had Steamed Bhetki with Pickled chili and cheese , which was absolutely delicious. Followed by Barbecued Roasted chicken Salad and  Chicken supreme tossed with pomegranate and spicy mustard. Both were mouth wateringly delicious and The second time I had  Devilled mushroom Chicken which I would definitely recommend for people to  try followed by Bheti with Radhuni Enriched curry and  Chicken stroganoff. We wanted to try our desserts however we were so full that we decided against it. 
I believe it is one of the restaurants in Kolkata where I would like to go back over and over again, The fusion of continental and Bengali cuisine is heavenly, the waiters are fast and polite, the décor and music makes you feel very conformable. If you are a foodie this is a must visit.

P.S Please try the Pachforan parshe and baked crab. Both are off the charts

Recently revisited the place and the place has again lived upto its repute. Loved the food -- the starters, the entree, the drinks and the dessert everything was perfect. For bacon lovers prawn in bacon is a must for starters, it comes with an orange dip which itself is awesome. The corn raps are also awesome. For the entree I have tried two of them from the combo menu so far and am now very keen on trying all the others (one at a time though). I am in love with the Malpua cheese cake and its a must for whoever goes there.  I loved the surprise in flavours that chef Joy has incorporated. Throughly enjoyed the evening and am looking forward to visit again soon. Worth every penny I have spent.

Love the decor and the ambiance. But a prior booking is advised as the place is really small (but thats the beauty as well).

Bohemian... The name itself describes a uniqueness... The twist in the bengali cuisine with continental cuisine... Is very much daring thought... But the twist is very much mouth watering..
I have heard a lot about bohemian.. So decided to visit there... The ambience is good.. The food is great... Specially i loved there deserts called malpua cheese cake... Very much unique... But awesome in taste... I'll recommend everyone to try it out..
The only thing lacks about bohemian is...that the place is bit small.. Need to extend more...bit costly but never the less if you can get best quality of food... That reason is not that matters and lastly the service of bohemian is very slow... I asked for water and i got it after half an hour or so...
But if you love variations in food... And your a foodie bohemian is your place

***Strictly for people who want a delightful change in food**

We chose this place for a quite sunday family lunch, its located on the old ballygunge road and one can easily locate. The restuarant is  quite small and  accomodates about  7 to 8 table, make sure you prebook your table.Interiors are bohemian, one can find rockish posters of pink flyod, Nirvana and the music played was of fossils, Aerosmith, Eagles and so on which we thoroughly enjoyed.

The menu here stands out for the place truley, very innovative fusion food, and anything on the menu would surprise you for how the local spices are used so beautifully into a contemporary dish, truly innovative.We ordered Gondhoraj jupel and sex on the beach moctails along with Panner cheese nuggets(**Mouth meltingly sexy**) and Lemon Chicken. Each of it had bout 7 to 8 pieces and tasted amazing.

We chose 4 main course combos, stuffed panner gravy, Prawns, Bhetki and Papda each of it accomponied with steamed rice/pulav and i must say all the 4 were delicious. The food portions are adequate and leaves you feeling satisfied and happy. And to give a nice climax to this wonderful time we took to malpua cheesecake(A must try) and spice mango souffle, amazingly delicious!
For 2 mocktails+2 Starters+4 main course combo+2 Desserts are bill was around Rs 3700
Would definitely visit this place again!

I m happy nt jst because i ate bt i somehw discovered a place which has so delicious bengali cuisines to offer. As far as taste is concerned it cud top the charts and can give a head on fighting with 6 Ballygunge place or Oh Calcutta. Foods are not only delicious bt also has an exquisite quality with superb hospitality. USP of this restaurant u will get a lot of innovative unique menus as fusions. Even though i m an frequent visitor of 6Ballygunge place still my preference wud straightly point towards BOHEMIAN. People, its my challenge if u taste thm u wud wont resist to visit again.

My first visit to Bohemian was a grand success - we loved the food, each of the items that we had was as tasteful as the others. There were four of us and we tried 1 Salad, 1 starter, and 4 different main courses apart from a mocktail and a dessert.

I would give 5/5 for the food. For me the only 2 reasons for not giving an overall 5/5 were the pricess ( a bit too much on the higher side considering the ambience etc ) and the lack of space resulting in a bit of congestion .

I have been to this restaurant on a couple of occasions with friends, and I must say the food does not disappoint in any way. I will accordingly, structure this review in four parts - Ambience/Decor, Service, Food and Conclusion.

1) Ambience/Decor

The dining area is small and the tables are quaint. The decor comprises mainly off various popular culture references by way of posters framed on the walls. The have also tastefully clipped pictures of various actors, celebrities, etc. on ropes along the windows. However, though there is scope for improving the decor, with the limited carpet area sufficient justice has been  done with their little wall hangings and pop-cul references.

2) Service

The staff are extremely courteous and are helpful when it came to recommendations required. Though service is a little on the slower side (our main course took around 25 minutes to arrive on both occasions), it is safe to say that we did not mind it when the food finally arrived.

3) Food

Finally, the food as already highlighted at the outset is fantabulous! For appetisers, the first time we ordered Lemon Chicken on Lemon Skewers and the second time we ordered Steamed Betki with Pickled Chilli & Cheese. Both fares were absolutely mindblowing, especially the betki which was one of the softest fish that we had eaten in a long while. The fusion of Chilli and Cheese sent tingles down our tongue. It is fair to say that these were indeed appetising as it left us craving for more. The main course also did not disappoint. We ordered Bhetki Gondhoraj and Kancha Lonka Mangsho in the two different occasions, and again the fish was brilliantly prepared. The Kacha Lonka Mangsho also deserves special praise as the mutton was cooked to perfection and the green chilli accentuated the overall effect of the flavour of the mutton. We also shared a dish of Bacon Wrapped Chicken bundles with Aam Kasundi Reduction. The dish turned out exactly as succulent as what the name itself suggested to our hungry imaginations. Bacon + Chicken + Kasundi = Total Winner! 

The desserts are also pinnacles of Bengali fusion cuisine,  and we specially recommend both the Malpua Cheescake and the Gondhoraaj Souffle.

4) Conclusion

All in all, even though the size and decor of the place is run of the mill, the food oh-so makes up for it! Service is above average and the waiters are always eager to help. One little downside is that they do not serve regular water and only mineral water. I am an advocate and I am aware that the Supreme Court had issued guidelines long time back to restaurants with air-conditioning facilities that the option of free water should be there in all restaurants. Please fix this. Other than that, absolutely no complaints.

Kolkata from days of Skyroom consistently throws up places that serve 'continental' food jigged for local palates.
The Bohemian does this well. 
The menu is interesting, food makes you want to come back. The waiters are well informed.

The pricing is a tad steep but it seems to be able to get in footfall judging by the waiting time even on a week day.

Well worth visiting. But check out cheaper competitors - Cafe 123, iCook etc

Mother, should I trust the Government- Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' postcard adores the windowpane.

Comfortably Numb plays on the background, confusing you whether to concentrate on the food more or on David Gilmour.

Bohemian created the absolutely perfect ambiance for me. One of the most exciting restaurants in town, it manages the perfect balance between experiment with cuisines and fine dining. Who knew you could do such wonders with Bengali spices and greens!

The place is pretty small itself, so do make reservations beforehand. The decor is minimalistic. Postcards of Dylan, Floyd and Bob Marley hangs from the windowpane. The waiters were quick to take our orders-  Chili pickle n cheese baked crab with kolmi greens, Bacon wrapped chicken supreme bundles in aam kashundi reduction and Grilled mutton chops with mushrooms and spicy red wine jus (Pork Chops wasn't available). Now, the names did sound super innovative, agreed, but I was skeptic about how good a dish made with Kolmi Saag, something I could never take to, could be! To my suprise and sheer dlight, it was the standout of all dishes. The softest crabmeat, baked cheese and the aroma of mustard oil made the dish dreamy! The taste of kolmi saag was present, but never dominating. Subtlety was the key. Perfect start.

Bacon wrapped chicken supreme bundles in aam kashundi reduction (I swear, if I had to type the whole name of this dish once more, I'll flip) was good, but the most average fare among those three. It tasted great, no doubt, but it's sweet. I loved it as I have a sweet tooth, but it was too sweet for my partner's liking. The taste of kashundi, something I adore, was oozing out, and the mango complemented it beautifully. Served with white rice, it was the most homely dish to me.

The Grilled mutton chops were a delight. Beautifully plated, sitting pretty on a cushion of mashed potatoes, it felt like a shame to dig into it. It was wonderful to taste though, the mutton succulent, the red wine jus affirming it's presence with every spoonful, caressing our taste buds. The quantity seemed good for the amount they charge, and we were so full after the meal that we had to drop the Malpua Cheesecake off our checklist for the day.   

Bohemian is a treat. Their food makes you wonder, excites you in anticipation, and finally when on plate, it satiates you. Love this place!

Pork Chops,  and Malpua Cheesecake, see you soon!

Let me just cut a long story short –I LOVE BOHEMIAN !  They have not only tried but also excelled in the concept of “fusion food” by incorporating the everyday spices and aromas of a Bengali kitchen into continental dishes . A small ,simple place with neat interiors and congenial staffs  Bohemian is sure to please your taste buds like no one else . I am a huge fan of their SORBETS  apart from fish dishes like Bacon baked telapia with ginger and fennel . They have a very impressive line up of starters too and by now I have almost tried most of them during my multiple visits . The only downside could be the availability of table on weekends . Overall its an amazing food experience .

P.S. limited no. of seats, try to avoid if you are in a large group.

This is one place that has become so popular, in such a short span of time. An absolutely tiny place, you almost always need a reservation, to find a table. The starters have miniscule quantity, but every mouthful is a slice of heaven. The drinks are less in quantity but the main dishes are exotically served, the presentation itself fills u up. The last time I went, I tried the Prawns in Alphonso Cream and my dad ordered a mutton one, whose name I don't recall(picture given below). The gravy was delectable and the quantities were handsome. 
I remember that another time I had tried the Mutton with Baby Onions, it was a beauty to behold. 
Dessert has off the beat souffles and sweets, which are not too heavy and soothing to the palate, after a heavy meal.
Definitely visit this place if you are in Kolkata, a must for all foodies out there.

I almost forgot to mention that the decor, with postcards of rockstars pinned up in the background was the one which got me hooked on to the restaurant. Special Mention for the Washroom, the graphiti on the walls will inspire you to click more than a single selfie every time you go in there!!

The fusion of Continental and Bengali Cuisine seemed a bit tacky to me at first. But since I had heard so much about this particular joint, I decided to try it out. Well something must have struck the right chord for people to love their food. The place is quite small with minimalistic décor. Cutouts of Rock Bands gives it a classic rock vibe.

The innovation strikes you as soon as you go through the Menu Card. The first time we were there, we went for the safe bet. For starters we ordered Bhetki with Pickled Chilli & Cheese. And, main course included the Classic Roast Chicken with Mushroom Sauce & Mutton with Yogurt & Pickled Green Chillies. With the first bite, you know they take their menu seriously. What an awesome combination of flavors! 

The Starter was yummy and so was the Classic roast chicken. Well, you can’t go wrong with a roast chicken. The mutton needs a special mention. The soft and succulent pieces of mutton in a rich creamy gravy. It was delicious! I was so happy with the food that I went there again a couple of times. Their specialty the Kacha Lonka Mangsho, a combination of green chillies and coriander based gravy is quite flavorful. The sizzled Bhetki simmered with pickled garlic is worth trying. You will never be disappointed with the food here.

The service is good, but you have to wait a long time for the food to arrive. All in all, an awesome experience.

Pros:
 • Creative dishes to choose from
 • Order anything blindfolded, you won’t be disappointed
 • Ambiance – Chic n Cosy

Cons:
 • Should include more items
 • A bit too Pricey

Its a very small lil place at a road side corner ! the inside interior is what attracted us inside! Not much space for many people.
I liked the chicken chettinad platter .

Awesome Experience!

The food is good and new. Fusion of continental and Bengali cuisine. Appropriate ambiance but would have been excellent if they could just extend a bit.  After ordering the food you will still feel great waiting and looking at the pics all around you and get ur time passed. Its bit expensive but you wont regret.

An awesome place to have good Italian and bengali food. Definitely try the mutton chops and chicken tetrazzini. And for desserts, try death by chocolate. Well you can definitely try other courses but these are some of my personal favourites
We have also tried some other dishes whose pictures are posted, however lately, the price of the items have skyrocketed and the quality and taste of food has detoriated.

An amazing eat out place.. 

The menu offers a plethora of dishes, tweaked to make them continentalised.. :) Needless to say the taste of the food is quite delicious.. not only does the food come with the right choice of spices, but also the manner that they are presented with makes it fantastic!!

I tried combinations of fish as well as mutton served with rice and found both to be utterly yummy.. fish to be definitely rated on the higher side though..alongside the main courses, the desert stood to be near perfect..making the dinner to be worth remembering for quite sometime..

Went with my brother there 2 weeks back. For starters we had bhetki with cheese and chilly and bacon wrapped prawns. The bacon wrapped prawns were best in town and cooked to perfection. The bhetki was also good. For the main course we had pork chops in apple sauce and bhetki in aam ada sauce.  The aroma, the delicate balance and the fusion of flavours  was just awesome. finally wrapped it up with malpoa cheese cake. Thanks to Mr Joy Bannerjee for this wonderful gift.  Quality and quantity  was good. The staff needs to be a little bit more professional.

Awesome food. A true 'never before' experience which one don't get so often.  We had gandhoraj shorbet, grilled bhetki with radhuni, mutton with yoghurt, and malpoa cheesecake. Each one was unique in their taste. The funny thing is that you really can't make out what they ingredients of the curry are. The strong unique flavour just hits your tongue once you have it. Ahh yes almost forgot....the service was good and the waiter was really helpful. But does this trivial things matter with a burst of sensory feelings in your mouth ?

Awesome innovation in food, practically. If u take some key spices of bengali cuisine.. Panchphoron, kul, shorshe and throw in some continental cuisine, u will get Bohemian food. Must try as you won't get these delicacies anywhere else. The dishes r Yumm and all r must try. Only thing is you should make a prior booking as there is always rush in there.

Started by Chef Joy Bannerjee, ex-chef of the Oberois … , Bohemian uses exotic Bengali spices like Panch Phoron (Bengalis’ famous 5-spice mix), Sorshe (Mustard paste, but of course) and Gondho Raj Lebu (a lemon known for its wonderful aroma) to make variants of global dishes with a Bong touch.

We had had a very heavy fish-centric lunch and hence, were not very hungry. That’s why we hit the main courses straightaway, missing out on some excellent starters which, we couldn’t help observing, were presented in true 5*-hotel style to the other diners. Some good wine, cocktail would have been awesome, but they do not have liquor license yet. Mock tails were our only option….

I ordered a Mocha Slush which was too sweet for my liking and avoidable. Deepa ordered ‘Magic Portion’, which was just okay. For main course, we ordered lamb and more lamb – Kancha Lonka Mangsho, Grilled Mutton Chops with Mushroom & Spicy Red Wine Jus and Royal Bengal Roast Mutton with Bhuna Sauce — you’ve got it, we are all mutton lovers! Served with basic accompaniments, every dish makes a big portion and obviously, quite filling. The Grilled Chops Sauce & Mushrooms were fantastic, but the muttom itself was a disappointment. It was very very stiff…:-( They should have some lamb shanks options. The other dishes were good though, that ‘melted in the mouth’…

For deserts, we opted for Gondhoraj Soufflé – a must have … with the mild flavor of Gondhoraj lemon giving just the right flavor to the creamy soufflé base. The service was very good & quick though a little impersonal.

How much does it cost to dine at Bohemian? 2 mocktails + 3 main-course meals + 1 dessert = Approx INR 2000. Beat that!! Kolkata prices appear to be so delightful to a Mumbaikar

There is a reason why Indian Accent in Delhi charges an arm and a leg for their food. Fusion is hard to pull off and even harder to really impress with. Bohemian with the verging-on-tacky decor gets a few things right, but most of it's dishes are pretty meh. But before I delve into the menu I do want to mention that the service was excellent.

There was nothing joyous in the mutton chops - the meat was tough, the spicing chunky. The tender coconut and mustard mousse was ok , as was the malpua cheesecake. These flavour combinations sound a lot more interesting than they taste. I am glad I tried them but wouldn't care to order them again. The alphonso prawns were sickly sweet.

The panchphoran chicken was really good though -  if I do ever go back it may be just for that one dish. And the fish in Radhuni was really good too.

The sorbets are alright - but the flavours don't really come together.

Go if you're in the area and are hungry, but keep your expectations low

Very nice eating joint with very tasty food and at a budget price. A good meal for 2 with dessert will not cost more than 1200/- bucks here. The food quality is very good here. The food items are also very innovative. Only thing that needs improvement is the space crunch as a bigger area is very appreciated.........

There's a Hindi adage "Oocha dukan feeka pakwan". That's the only thing that came to my mind after my visit to this place in November 2012. The portions of the appetizers as well as the main course were so small that my friend and I were left aghast! As for the dessert, we had ordered chocolate souffle, which turned out to be plain chocolate ice cream. Moreover, it was supposed to come with brownie, but the waiter said that since it was the festive season (after Durga Puja) they couldn't (or wouldn't) provide it. He had quite conveniently forgotten to mention this important piece of information when we had originally placed the order. So much for all the hoopla about this fancy, fusion-food restaurant, huh!!

P. S. I recently came to know from one of our relatives that they too had a similar experience. The two of them were so dissatisfied with the measly amount served that they had to afterwards go to the nearby Swinhoe St. Kasturi outlet and fill their bellies😗

Yes if you want to taste the cross hybridization of Continental with Bengali food, then please come to this place. The former Chef of Oh! Calcutta has added all his expertise into this place. Fusion Food! This place will tell you what it actually means. Can you imagine Spicy Mango Souflet? Bohemian is a must visit for all the foodies and do try the pork with apple sauce. You don't get Suckling Pig with apple sauce everywhere, but in here you can have a glimpse of how deadly it can taste..

This restaurant should have a national chain, because the food they make truly stands up to its name. Although the ingredients are essentially Bengali, but the taste can suit the taste buds of non vegetarian lovers all across the country. I visited Bohemian on a sultry afternoon only to find out that I had to wait. The place is a little small. The wall is painted with hues of yellow and purple. The interiors may not be striking but the food will blow you away. It might not be possible for you to take a bite of everything. So you can go for Bacon Wrapped Prawns, or Pickled Steamed Bekti. They are absolutely delicious. For the main course you have a variety of options and I was spoilt for choices. 
I ordered Mutton Vindaloo Calcutta Style. The feature that sets Bohemian and Chef Joy Banerjee apart is that there was mutton all over which were solid chunks of meat. The waiters are smart and attentive.(They wont write down your order,they would simply remember it.The service is quick. Moderately priced for the food they serve. All in all a grande experience.

Either you are going to love this avant garde eatery or you are gonna hate it. It's impossible to tread 'the somewhere in between' line. Fusion of Continental with Traditional Bengali doesn't sit well with me.  In fact it's a scary proposition!
But the adventurer in us always wants to 'give it a try'...so did I. A friend had recommended Bacon Wrapped Chicken in Mango Kasundi reduction and that is what I ordered. Boneless pieces of chicken wrapped generously with bacon cooked in Kasundi (a common presence in most Bengali household). But the Kasundi was not quite what we are used to, either look- wise or colour-wise (which is perhaps why it is called 'reduction'). A rather disappointing adventure by all means. They served the dish with plain rice and salad. I also had one of their mock tails. Lots of gondhoraj and basil in a clear drink. I prefer KFC Virgin Mojito. Thank you!

However, the quality is rather good. The chicken pieces were quite succulent and I did not have to use all my might to tear off the bacon. Just not my taste I suppose.

It's a small neat place. Good for family, friends as well as lovers. :P

May 2015: Visited again on New Year's Eve last year. My perception has changed. Boy, do they or do they know how to fuse two completely different food bases! But I guess their starters are the real show stealers rather than main courses.

This restaurant serves the best fusion food in town and truly innovative and unimaginable ones. I have been to the restaurant a couple of times and have got their food delivered to my place which I think is better because of the way they pack the food in a cardboard box and with disposable wooden fork and spoon. I prefer it because if u dont book a table well in advance you will surely not get a place even on weekdays. We had our uncle visiting india after a long long time from Australia and he is a complete foodie. He wanted to try a different cuisine so we decided bohemian is the right choice.  For starters we had ordered keema wrap and joyous mutton chops which were very tasty. The main course consisted of chicken stroganoff,  bekti in radhuni curry sauce and a spicy mutton curry.. I cant remember the name..the portion was too much for the 3 of us. And our uncle liked it so much that he packed the remaining food and took it home for next days lunch.
The prawn in garlic and cheese sauce is alao out of the world. The jumbo sized prawns succulent with the right flavours. I can try out all the dishes o e by one and have managed to do half of it. 
I can go on and on writing about this place but its better all of you go and try and then u will understand the uniqueness of the place. So what r u waiting for... just book a table and go.

My friend introduced me to this little restaurant way back when you could just stroll in without a reservation and enjoy their deliciousness. Since then, every chance I get, I have popped by. Couple of times, even turned away for lack of reservation and seating space.

Over many visits, I have tried and absolutely loved their Steamed Bhetki with Pickled Chili and Cheese and Joyous Mutton Chops. I just HAVE to mention separately how FRIGGIN' AWESOME their Chili Pickle and Cheese Baked Crab with Kolmi Greens are..I order it EVERY SINGLE TIME!! 

For mains, I generally order Fish. On my last visit to Bohemian a week back, I had ordered for Sizzled Bhetki simmered with pickled garlic. The fish was soft and fresh, the side of my plate garnished with little somethings and my mouth was stuffed with spoonfuls of it! I've also ordered and loved their Pan Braised Bhetki with Aam Adaa Sauce and Spicy grilled Bhetki with Radhuni enriched curry sauce but now as I try to remember the flavours, they seem to have overlapped, possibly because I've ordered them too many times! Their Steamed Bhetki with coriander and mustard is good too. The ONLY Bhetki dish I didnt like was the one with Bengal Berry Sauce. Unfortunately, I didnt realise that Bengal Berry is Topa Kul (in Bengali) and the preparation was much too sweet to my liking. Their Chicken with Aam Adaa Sauce and Radhuni Enriched Sauce is no different than the Bhetki preparation, substituting the protein ofcourse. I've also loved their Spicy Pork Curry, although I've ordered it just once. Their Mutton Vindaloo is delicious too!

Their desserts are not too much to my liking, although I keep ordering them even though I'm always full with their generous portions! Malpua Cheesecake isnt special really. I recently tried their Nolengurer Custard/Pudding but didnt like it too much as it had a strong egg smell to it.

Their Mint and Gondhoraj Juleps are extremely refreshing!

After repeated visits, I'd like it if Chef Joy revamped his menu. Irrespective, I'd goto Bohemian always! :)

I have had Chef Joy's creations before. They do dish out traditional Bengali food with not-so-traditional twists. I had been looking forward to their bacon wrapped prawns for quite some time. The other day we thought we would order in from Bohemian for a fancy dinner at a friend's place, without having to go out for it. The food arrived in these big brown boxes, we decided to set the table before opening them. This was one of the cold winter nights and the food was getting cold, so we decided to heat the stuff up. When we opened the "Becon Prawan"(not everybody has the privilege to learn English, so be assured I am not mocking that part here) we got....Keema Wraps!! Which did not taste so good after it had gone cold, it was quite greasy. And it was too late to call them up to fix this. But, this is not the kind of mix-up you expect from such an esteemed restaurant. Deducting .5 from the rating because of this.
What else we ordered - Spicy Pork Curry, Mutton Vindaloo Calcutta Style, the famed Malpua Cheesecake and Gondhoraj Souffle.
I liked the souffle, but I felt the malpua cheesecake wasn't all that it has been hyped up to be. I like malpuas and cheesecakes, just the combo didn't fascinate my palate like it did the others. I guess I prefer the biscuity texture of the base against the creaminess of the cheese. The curry dishes were not bad. I would someday like to try their other dishes; I remember having a bhetki dish earlier which I had liked, I also remember finding the aam kashundi reduction from the Bacon Wrapped Chicken Supreme Bundles interesting. My friend's verdict - "This is just not my kind of food."

This s a nice place for family dinner. Very calm and quite though the area is small. Went for a family dinner and the food took some time to come though later we understood they take time to prepare fresh food. Good taste. Very less oil and less spice ideal for anyone with a health issues. The gondhoraaj bhetki s the showstopper. We had it " once more" styled :) 

Nice place. Would love to visit often.

This is not a restaurant. It is a piece of art. I absolutely love the interiors full of classic rock vibes! I love the plush white sophistication of the place. I absolutely adore the way the food is served.

Now coming to the food, the bengali fusion concept is amazing. The chef Mr. Joy Banerjee has done something fabulius with the menu.  I had ordered a gondhoraj sorbet which was amazing to drink. The starters were pachphoron flavoured chicken escallops and it was amazing to taste, with the smell of pachphoron in the fried chicken present in just the right balance.

The main course that me and my friend had ordered were Pan braised bekti with aam aada sauce and pach phoron flavoured parshe with smoked green chilli sauce. I must admit, both of these were amazing with the smell of each with intricately combined with the sauce in which the fishes were cooked.

The quantity is enough to fill you up and after the sumptuous food, we did not have space for dessert.

I am forced to give this place full marks because I would love to come here again and again!

It was a very recent excursion and what an experience it was! No over the top decor.. just a little riff raff thrown here and there in this cosy little space they call the dining room. A big line resulted in a waiting period of 15 minutes before we could be seated, was a pain locating this restaurant and a wee too expensive... would I visit this place again? YES! again and again and again! !!! Oh the food! The food! Let me not waste time on adjectives here as one can have the divine experience and judge for themselves. But a little advice from your fellow foodie here...try their grilled bhetki in bengal berry(kul in bengali) sauce or the gondhoraj bhetki and down in with the gondhoraj julep... Orgasmic, I declare!

An absolute must visit. Every single dish we tried at Bohemian was worth every penny that we paid. The Gondhoraj julep is one of the most refreshing things that you will come across in Calcutta. The only issue is the service- the staff tend to keep you waiting even if the restaurant is relatively empty. But all in all, Bohemian has definitely upped the standards for Calcutta restaurants and given fusion food a new meaning.

The food is a bang on match for the name: Very quirky twist on Bengali food.

Loved all the 3 things I tried out:
-The Gondharaj coriander julep: The bengali lime is very flavourful and different from our sour lime. The coriander is a mixed bag: it's unusual to chance upon it in a sweet drink, but not too bad either.
-The chiken breast in Radhuni gravy was mindblowing. The gravy is a burst of delicate flavours. The rice served alongside goes fabulously well with it. Although the chicken wasn't as tender as it ought to have been.
-Lastly, the malpua cheesecake was beautiful- the sublime notes of malpua in a cheesecake- Loved the malpua layers which broke the monotony a cheesecake can bring on.

Highly recommend this place to anyone who's in Kolkata for a meal!

Lovely Bengali Italian fusion cuisine. Really innovative menu, a breath of fresh air from the usual fare everywhere else. No alcohol, which was a downer, but the mocktails were nice and different. Only grouse was with the space.. its a small restaurant so reserving ahead is a must. The ambience also could be improved.. maybe have some mood lighting instead of vanilla bright yellow lights. But the food by itself is enough of a draw!

Fusion dance. Fusion music. And then comes fusion food. The restaurant, Bohemian is absolutely true to its name. The food served here is really unconventional and very innovative. With the decor and interiors kept minimal, the restaurant is pretty small. So, it is better to do prior table reservations. I have come to the place earlier with friends and this time I brought my parents. As it was my mom's birthday, I thought of bringing them to this place and make them try the wonderful creations by Chef Joy Banerjee. Verdict: They loved it.

The first thing I ordered was Gondhoraj Julep. I am fan of gondhoraj lime because of the sweet and tangy fragrance and loads of coriander on top of it made it such a refreshing drink. Then came our starters. Vodka Soaked prawns and Chilli Pickle n Cheese baked Crab with Kolmi Greens. The prawns were nicely done. But the latter steals the spotlight. This innovative combination of chilli pickle + crab + cheese + kolmi shaag is heavenly. This is a dish which you cannot give a miss when you come to Bohemian. A must try. 

After this, we ordered the main course. Classic Roast Chicken with pepper Sauce  and Spicy Grilled Bhetki with radhuni enriched curry sauce. The fish was served with rice and the chicken with mashed potato and bread. The portions served are sufficiently enough for one person. I loved the fish preparation more than the chicken. The desserts, Malpua cheesecake and Death by Chocolate are sinful when it comes to calories but you cannot resist it for sure. Overall it was an amazing and satisfying experience. The staff is very courteous and when confused, they would surely recommend Highly recommended for food lovers. :D

The menu of Bohemian seemed quite intriguing – Gondhoraj Lebu Sorbet & Gondhoraj soufflé, Vegetable Monihari with tender Coconut & Gondhoraj Lebu, Prawn Gondhoraj, Bhetki Gondhoraj… my mind was quite blurred. After-all, I have been playing the chasing game with Gondhoraj Lebu for a long time now. This specific Lime that originates in the Bengal shores is chalked out in my olfactory cells and tastebuds for ever (the confessions of a non-resident Bong!). 

The different drinks that we had ordered were Gondhoraj Julep (Gondhoraj Lime, Coriander leaves & lemonade), Mint Julep (Lime, Mint leaves & Lemonade), Bluuu (Blue Curacao & lemonade), Sunny Citrus Cooler (Pineapple, Ginger Ale, Orange juice & Lemonade), Magic Potion (Pineapple, Mango, strawberry & Ginger Ale) and Sex on the Beach (Peach Nectar & Cranberry juice) – Oops! [The verdict... The Gondhoraj Julep was definitely the show stealer. As I have mentioned before, Gondhoraj Lime has a fragrance that’s absolutely unparalleled and combining it with coriander leaves rendered it absolutely refreshing. Second in heed would be the Mint Julep. I’m always apprehensive about Mint and find it’s flavour too strong for my liking. Since the leaves were probably not crushed and floated in the Lemonade as uncut sprigs, I think the aroma seeped in without the intense taste of the mint.]

For the Starters: We had ordered Panch Phoron flavoured Chicken Escallops, Vodka soaked Prawns with Grilled Garlic Aioli, Joyous Mutton Chops and Chilli Pickle n Cheese baked Crab with Kolmi Greens. [The Verdict... Each dish had it’s own flavour and story, minutely detailed in it’s flavouring. For example, the Chicken Escallops had been marinated with Panch Phoron, ginger paste, chilli paste, lime juice and grilled. Occasionally basting it with well, what else? With Panch Phoron oil. But the winner would be the Chilli Pickle n Cheese baked Crab with Kolmi Greens. Hands down. No questions asked. This was a mix of Crab meat & Kolmi Shaak. Interestingly combined with a spicy Chilli Pickle and baked with creamy Cheese on top!]

The Palette Cleansers are definitely worth-trying. We had ordered Green Mango & Honey Sorbet, Orange & Aam Adaa Sorbet and Gondhoraj Sorbet. [The Verdict... We absolutely loved all the Sorbets that we had ordered. But the Orange & Aam Adaa Sorbet had a very distinct pungent taste of Aam Aada – definitely a Palette cleanser! What is Aam Ada? Dried Ginger sprinkled with Aamchur/Mango Powder? And of course the Gondhoraj Sorbet wins hands down. Such distinct flavour of the unique Bengal Lime!]

For the Main Course: We had ordered some ‘tweaked traditional fare’ according to the Menu…  Daab aar Gondhoraj Diye Shabji-r Monihari/Vegetable with Coconut & Gondhoraj Lime, Phoolkopir Malai Curry/Cauliflower Malai Curry. Interestingly, there are many vegetarian options in the Menu which sounds absolutely drool-worthy and exotic.

Between the two days we had tasted the following…

In Fish: Pabda Rolls stewed in Cherry Tomato & Spinach Broth, Panch Phoron flavoured Parshe with smoked Green Chilli Sauce, Grilled Bhetki with Bengal Berry Sauce, Bacon baked Tilapia with Ginger & Fennel and Prawns with Muddled Grapes & Chillis. In Meat: Spicy Pork Curry (Anglo-Indian spices), Royal Bengal Roast Mutton with Bhuna Sauce, Mutton Vindalaoo (Calcutta style), Ham Steak – Chef Joy’s style. And also a Pasta… Penne with Alfredo Sauce! [The Verdict... Some culinary experiments work. Some don’t. And the verdict does depend upon individual taste preferences. I feel in Bohemian a lot of these work. I loved my Pabda Rolls stewed in Cherry Tomato & Spinach Broth. Also the Panch Phoron flavoured Parshe. For the Pabda, I wouldn’t mind having the Broth as a soup!

All dishes by Chef Joy are an amalgamation of flavours and much like abstract art, each dish will have it’s own suitors. My friend was probably expecting a ‘traditional’ Ham Steak and was slightly disappointed. On the other hand we were so used to Goan Vindaloo that we were surprised to stumble upon our own Mutton Vindalaoo (Calcutta style)! I wasn’t even aware of any Vindaloo existing in Bengali Cuisine so far. I loved the Grilled Bhetki with Bengal Berry Sauce. Who could ever imagine that Kul or Bengal Berries could actually be used to make such a tangy & exotic sauce? My brother is a skeptic. He was transfixed with his Royal Bengal Roast Mutton with Bhuna Sauce. But he was craving for some Luchis though!

A few interesting elements here and there… crumbled Boris in the Rice Pilaf, use of typical Bengali Spices like Panch Phoron, Radhuni, Mouri or the Aam Aada to tweak the dishes… Pickles & Chillies, readily available and most commonly used vegetables like Kolmi Greens, Spinach… everything tasted exotic. Each dish was made from locally sourced ingredients and most importantly from ingredients that had always been existing in the Bengali kitchen all this while.

My suggestion here, would be to include some Chutneys too before making the transition to formal dessert-tasting.]

For Desserts: We tasted Malpua Cheese Cake, Gondhoraj Soufflé, Spiced Mango Soufflé, Mustard and Tender Coconut Mousse, Channa Panch Phoron Mousse. [The Verdict... To please the sweet-toothed Bengali, this has to be the final acid test for any restaurant. We loved the Malpua Cheese Cake. The very concept of using traditional  Malpua as layers inside a Channa Cheesecake is amazing. However, the Soufflés in both the days had become overtly melted and very, very soft. Almost served at room temperature. Again, the combination that went into the mousse blew our imaginations.]

The way reviews were getting written about Bohemian, I thought this place was something on a completely different level. I was surprised to find out that things are pretty simple over here - the place is quite small, the decor is kept at its minimal best and the staff members are very polite & courteous. And so was the food! It tasted extra-ordinarily delicious... but it was nothing which blew my mind.

Started with Vodka-soaked prawns with Grilled Garlic Aioli. Yes, the prawns were juicy, tender and tasty; but try this dish stands out especially for the Aioli dip. It's stupendous! You are sure to love it.

Then came the two main courses - Bhetki Godhoraaj, and Bacon-wrapped Chicken Bundles with Aam Kashundi Reduction. The bhetki was just too good - fresh and cooked to perfection. However, the letdown was the gravy. How do I put it? The taste was fine but I've had better Bhetki Godhoraaj. I mean the way my taste buds like it... it would've been better if it was more creamier. The same goes for the other main course dish. Solid chicken pieces with equally marvelous bacon strips. But then, the gravy was more like a "jhol" that we normally have at home. The taste somewhat made up for the little flaws which didn't suit my taste-buds... but I seriously wanted to give full-points (which I sadly can't).

Aah... the dessert! Looked at the pics before visiting the place, and the glamour of a dish which caught my attention the most was the Malpua Cheesecake. Each and every bite was utter bliss. Wanted to order another plate, but stopped myself after realizing I've already taken in too much.

A Note for Chef Joy: Fusion... tweak... whatever you call it, kudos to you for bringing something new to the city. I desperately wanted to tell you, "Your art is an explosion"; but I've to prevent myself from doing that as of now. Maybe I didn't order the right dishes! So I'll come back again and try some other things. And I dearly hope that you'll succeed in "thrilling" me and compelling me to give you full 5-points.

I visited Bohemian a few months back with my family and friends, we were a group of 6. Bohemian is a fusion of Bengali and continental delicacies, this place is an absolute treat for the eyes, the tongue and definitely the stomach.

 Ambience:
The place isn’t that huge, it’s pretty small and cosy but quite nicely done up. You can see families and groups of people sitting around gorging on the amazing food that this place serves. 

Food:
This is definitely the star of the show, the reason for the success of the restaurant. After looking at the menu, I felt like ordering a little bit of everything but we managed with the following delights-

	Bacon wrapped prawns with aam kashundi reduction (my favourite) - Need I say more??!! The combination was finger licking good.
	Murshidabadi shashliks (veg)- they were quite good as well.
	Lemon chicken on Lemon Skewers- Quite delicious and succulent.
	Pan baked bhetki with aam adda sauce- the fish was soft and it almost melted in my mouth. The sauce to go with it was delicious and the portion of rice was overwhelming. 
	Chicken Stroganoff (another favourite)- The dish was a little spicy but was fully packed with flavours. I enjoyed it immensely.
	Classic roast chicken (pepper sauce)
	Rich tomato and cheese sauce pasta (veg)
	Goundhoraaj soufflé (yet another favourite) and Malpua cheesecake- The perfect ending to the amazing array of dishes we had. The malpua cheesecake was a little too sweet for my liking, my mum and the others seemed to have enjoyed it nevertheless.

Pricing:
The place isn’t expensive at all. I found the prices to be quite reasonable at least by Delhi standards.

I would definitely visit this place again the next time I’m in Caclutta and I would definitely recommend people to try this place out.

Just a single visit but i must say one hell of a tongue twister concept restaurant !!
.............................................
MOCKTAILS : Great combos. And Bloody January concept hats off. 
.....................................>>> i had ordered magic potion : zingy and spicy and sweet and refreshing. 
..................................................................................
STARTERS : The combinations about the merging of two elements or products are genius. who would have thought about having chicken with lemon skewers complimenting it instead of a tasteless stick? 
.........................................................
MAIN COURSE: Chicken Stroganoff .......really mentionable. tastes a lot like a milk readied chicken but it isn't what it seems. it's way tingly and one filling main course.
..........................................................

DESSERT : Malpua Cheese Cake : Basically a cheese cake layered with two layers of malpua....a traditional bengali sweet dish. 
.........................................................
PRICING : According to food standards a bit overpriced but a sure revisiter.

Bohrmia is a foodie's paradise!! It truly lives up to it's name as it serves this wide range of dishes mixing banglaiana with other cuisines. Be it the baked crab or joyous mutton cjop every dish had a new taste . But for me the knockout dishes were spiced mango soyffle-a 'sweet' dish with some spices which served as a delightful aftertate and death by choclate which also lives up to it name. So

There are eateries that are good, where you loved every dish you ate. There are  eateries that are excellent, where you would love to have food many a times. And then comes a place which surprises you with each and every bite you take, a place where you would love to have your meals every single day. Bohemia, for  me comes in the last category. Trust me when I say this, it has surprised me with all the dishes that it has served. I have been to this place more than once, and not even for a single time I can say that it has not exceeded all the expectations. This place according to me is " THE BEST" restaurant in town currently. The ambiance and decor are excellent, very much inline with its name. The staff the very helpful, prompt and co-operative. The service is pretty fast. And the food...what do I say, from the Joyous mutton chops to steamed Bhetki with pickeled chiili and cheese, from bacon wrapped prawns to baked crab with kolmi greens..all the starters are excellent.  The kanch lanka mangsho  is an excellent dish which is also done in my house by my mother and I got that similar taste from the dish. It was mind blowing !!! The fusion menu is also excellent be it the jumbo prawns or the baked bhetki.  And then the next course, the desserts. This is one section that would blow your minds.  The fusion here is just outstanding, from malpua cheesecake to channa panchforn mousse.

My pick ( even though all are my favs!!!) - Baked crab with kolmi greens, Joyous mutton chops, Kancha lanka mangsho, Jumbo prawn with picked chilli and cheese, malpua cheesecake.

Pros - Good food, Great ambiance, Prompt service.

Cons - Not really !!!

Pocket pinch - 1500 for 2 if you have 3 course.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. It does not matter where you stay in Kolkata, you must try this restaurant if you are a food lover.

Bohemian means "a socially unconventional person, especially one who is involved in the arts". Whatever can be written, said and expressed about Bohemian, it will not be much of a help for the readers!!! It is truly a different experience altogether! The place dishes out the most delicious surprises ever. This is innovation at its best! The menu plates an extensive variety of Bengali food (with a difference). 
On my first visit to Bohemian, m friend had suggested to try "Chilli Pickle & Cheese Baked Crab with Kolmi Saag". Honestly, till that day i have never ever tasted Crab in my life. But since that day onwards, i cant get over with the feeling i had after i had it. It was sheer divine. 
If is a typical Kolkata Summer afternoon that you are planning to visit, you really need to thirst quenching experience with Gondhoraj julep - Refreshing is all i can say!!! All the main coarse in the Menu list is a must try!!!!
For dessert, Gondhoraj souffle is a must... and if you are a chocolate craving person... Death by chocolate is a must!!! Its surely a KILLER!!!
Love BOHEMIAN!!!!!

i have never been disappointed by the food here and for that alone, recommend it highly to others. however, today ( i was there for lunch), the service left much to be desired... the staff need to be far more 'alive' and helpful (and not chat among themselves when clients are waiting for their attention at tables)... after we paid the bill, it took ages for the change to arrive and despite having called for it at least thrice, there was little response... no apology for the delay just deadpan faces! for a small eatery with excellent, innovative food, the service has to improve drastically for a positive culinary experience.

This is a one of a kind restaurant in Kolkata. The cuisine is basically Bengali but with a lot of twists. The chef really blends other various cuisines with Bengali cuisine and most of the dishes are meaningful innovations which are quite delectable. I love the pork with anlo indian spices, the aplhonso prawns, the grape and chilli prawn, the lemon chicken skewers and the keema wraps. The gondhoraj julep is awesome as well. In desserts I love the malpua cheescake, the other options do not really appeal to me so much. Many of my friends though really like the other available stuff as well. The place is small and the decor is a bit confusing. And weeends can get really crowded and noisy. But the food is what matters which is really quite good.

A place where your tastebuds are in for a wanderlust... Innovative menu..Good food.. but the only factor is the price.. The foos is not worth that amount that one pays for.. apart from this one factor.. the main course, starter nd specially the dessert menu is simply delicious..
The decor of the place is done well nd it suits the name.. wat strikes one immmediately is the washroom.. this is a special suggestion do visit the loo at least once.. the grafiti on the walls are too good...
The cobcept of the memu is also good.. but not for those who do npt lole experimentation.. I loves the food.. the baby tumeric pork bhapa was just finger licking... All in all a good place to visit..

"Bohemian" makes your taste buds wander ,craving  more and gets tempted  for repetitive visits ;)..Each of the dishes are ecstatic in taste with a medley of  Bengali with continental..

The Baked Crab with Kolmi Greens ,Royal Bengal Mutton Roast  , Gandhraj soufle/Cheese Malpoa  are some of  the dishes which should not be given a miss.

The restaurant is filled with rock n roll references aptly complementing the food served..The service is remarkable and serves as a  topping to the entire "Bohemian Experience". Finally post dining you will really feel to walk down  the other side of the kitchen door and thank the creator personally for satisfying your taste buds with such unique dishes.

I read a few reviews of Bohemian before I went there and saw that everybody said how great the food is and many said that the space is too small. The first is undisputed. The second is a matter of what you are used to - I live in Bombay and am used to crammed restaurants. Bohemian seemed fairly well spaced out to me. 
I am a fusion cynic but have to say, Bohemian has got it right! Why they need to have the Italian menu, however, I could not understand. The Bengali-Conti fusion works well by itself! Everybody talks about their baked crab with kolmi greens - with good reason! Getting fusion dessert right, I believe, is more difficult than the main course. The malpua cheesecake was spectacular. 
Points for improvement - 
1) More staff! 
2) More proactive staff - the main course quantities are very large. The staff could have advised us to go easy on the starters or share the main course, so that we did not end up wasting so much at the end. That's what one expects in a specialty dining restaurant. 
3) The kitchen lies behind a sliding door. Every time the door slides, the view of the messy wall behind is not pleasant and takes away from the fine dining experience. 

Definitely going back next time I am in Calcutta.

I am totally in Love with this place!!!! Each and every dish was a masterpiece..The service was good and most importantly I went there for my B'day lunch and the food made my day :)

For starters,we ordered Vodka soaked prawns and chili cheese baked crabs with kolmi greens. Both of them were kick-ass in terns of taste and flavour. We craved for more but thought we should give a try to the main course. We ordered Gondhoraj julep for drinks and believe me it was perfect to beat the heat of Kolkata!! For the main course,we had pancforon flavoured smoked parshe in green chili sauce and pan seared bhetki in aam ada sauce.. Both were excellent and wholesome. For desserts we were full but still dared to order one as we didnt want to regret later.. So we shared one spiced mango souffle and it was a happy ending to our meal. The bill came around 1900 and it was well worth the food.

Had a great time on my b'day and will go back once I am in Kolkata :)

Exceptional - just the word. Have read reviews heard people say it - but if you love food and are in Kolkata. You have to go there. If you manage a seat (that seems to be the problem - we also had a reservation but had to wait outside) get in and enjoy. The Baked Crab starter was out of this world - and I do not like crab - I am having that everytime I go back. The palate cleansers are very needed - we shared the souffles the Gondhoraj and the Honey Mango was wonderful. Mains were superb but I the Chicken Supreme Bundles with Aam Kashundi reduction was unexpected and awesome and would have been a clear winner. But then I had the Malpua Cheese Cake!!!!My wife does not like Cheese Cake and not a great Malpua fan wanted to share but that ended up being the king(or the queen's) share. It was that good. Only problem counted 29 seats - why so few????

What would you like veg or non veg   Do you like mushrooms. Grow up man. A restaurant which categorises food in those basis lacks class and man what attitude. the dishes may not lack character but the staff surely does. A special mention a few versions of their recipes such as the fish gondhoraj is truly special.

Whatever I write for Bohemian would be considered less. Its one of a kind restaurant that serves real whacky bengali dishes.
Has a problem of space crunch though, but the delicious food makes up for it.

We ordered : 1. Bacon wrapped prawns.
                        2. Bacon wrapped chicken supreme bundles with aam kashundi reduction (served with rice and a bowl of tossed vegetables)
                       3. Gondhoraaj souffle.

Bacon wrapped prawns were fabulous with a tangy hint of lime to it. Really good experimentation.  It also had a sauce with it ( I do not know what it is called..sorry!)

The mango sorbet in between as a palate cleanser. That was good too. Haha.

Next was Bacon wrapped chicken supreme bundles with aam kashundi reduction which came with rice and a bowl of tossed vegetables. The rice is sufficiently huge and the chicken tasted awesome. The whole need idea of serving vegetables with the meal is a spot on. It goes really well with the dish. Its very filling and a plate would be more than enough for even the biggest of tummies in town.

Lastly, the gondhoraj souffle is nice, not very sweet and has little lemon extracts and peels to it. Overall, nice.

I fantasize of trying the Malpua Cheesecake soon  ^_^

Pocket pinch : : 900-1000 for two
Do not think about the little hole in the pocket, cause its totally worth it.

Really impressed by the fusion of food that has blended in so successfully. Great going guys.
Cheers ! :)

Global adventure of Bengali Cuisine!

I first visited Bohemian during Pujo last year and what an amazing experience it was! Each and every item on the menu reflected sheer brilliance and, thanks to our large group of school friends, we had tasted and savoured almost everything on the menu. Well, almost! I also had the opportunity to talk to Chef Joy Banerjee then, the man behind the adventure. I revisited Bohemian on last Sunday, only to be pleasantly surprised again.

Bohemian is clearly different from other Bengali eateries, for it is at Bohemian that the global adventure of Bengali food begins! The adventure comes at a price though, but the incredible experience makes up for it. Where else would you get a delightfully tasting concoction of chicken, pomegranate and spicy mustard! Delicacies like bacon wrapped chickens, served in a tangy gravy of aam kasundi, to choose from. Or the Mutton Vindaloo for that matter. And desserts like Gondhoraj Julep to wash it down with. Then there is also the Gondhoraj Souffle of course, and, if you are not the calorie freak, you could also order your 'Death by Chocolate'. The menu in fact can be a bit overwhelming and the knowledgeable staff do give some helpful pointers.

I am yet to try their pastas and hope to try on my next visit. I have heard a lot of good words about the Gondhoraj Bhetki preparation - that is on the list too!

The theme of the place could be labelled Gothic, as someone has pointed out in a review, yet very tasteful; it only gets louder on the walls of the washroom! What I don't like though is how the washroom door opens right into the seating area, something you may not really appreciate while occupying the two-seater at the far end of the restaurant.

We decided to have dinner at Bohemian one weekend evening.  Since there were 6 of us, and having had previous experience of not finding a table when we showed up without reservations, we decided to make a reservation more than a day in advance.  When we showed up at the restaurant at the appointed time, they had our reservation in their books but not the table.  They said they should have a table ready for us within 10 minutes that sounded very reasonable - the 10 min ran into 20, we were assured the table will be available shortly, there was no table after 30 min, 40 and so on.  Finally they found a table a full 1 hour after our original reservation!!!  Obviously they had just not bothered with the reservation and given the table to some other group which had shown up.  So, although the chef Joy Banerjee serves up good Bengali fusion cuisine (I did not try any of their Italian fare - why try that in Kolkata when you can have much better in New York, Florence, or Venice), I am not going back there unless he can ensure a good dining experience for diners.

Whatever I say about this restaurant will fall lesser in words. Every dish is ecstatic in taste over here, and every single recipe is uniquely innovative for which Bohemian can claim copyright. Before visiting it, I heard a lot of brouhaha about their two signature starters: Chilli Pickle & Cheese Baked Crab with Kolmi Greens; Bacon Wrapped Prawns. We ordered both those dishes. Both were surprisingly tasty. Personally I liked the baked crab one more than the other. Then we had Barbecue Roasted Chicken Salad, they supplied breads with it. The mixture used in salad was great and it tasted heaven. As main dish, my parents had Mutton Vindaloo and steamed rice. I ordered pasta/spaghetti with alfredo sauce and chicken. The lingering taste of cheese crust and fine spaghetti threads is still haunting me. Finally we had Malpua Cheese Cake and Death by Chocolate as desserts. Again the melting taste of those were absolutely divine. As parting refreshment, we had Gandhoraj Julep, Blue Lagoon and Bloody January. Bohemian left an indelible impression on me and I'd definitely like to throw another party over there. I'd rate it 4.5 out of 5.

Only one word of caution: please do not forget to book your seats over the phone beforehand, else you'd have to wait for long.. this restaurant is not spacious enough to accommodate many people.

Different is the word most appropriate for this fine restaurant!

I really do not remember the names of the food we had , but the taste is still lingering on my palette. The names are a little complicated but that is irrespective and kinda fun!

The twist is very subtle and exciting which is given to the continental dishes
Just one let down was taht we went on my boyfriend birthday over there and there was no special thing for birthdays!

I don't like that !
apart from that , superb I would say !

If you stay in Kolkata and you are a foodie then you MUST visit Bohemian. Here food really does cabaret with the mind. Once you taste their food you would just want to have everything available on their menu. They have some absolutely yummilicious dishes in their menu. From the vodka soaked prawn to the bacon wrapped chicken to the traditional lonka mangsho- everything tastes just heavenly. Highly recommended.

Excellent food quality, ambience and atmosphere. The whole restaurant, even the bathroom is filled with rock n roll references, both Western and Bengali, aptly complementing the type of food you will find there. The bathroom was filled with strange grafitii, which i actually observed for about 2-3 minutes standing inside. The food is a unique combination of Bengali and Continental cuisines. Definitely try the Baked crab recipe in the appetizer section. Bacon wrapped prawns and grilled mutton chops were very good. Chicken in radhuni sauce was OK. Also bloody January was brilliant. Lastly we had death by chocolate and it was good too. Price was a little more than average, but it was worth it.

went there with my fiancée for a quiet lunch and truly impresses by their arrangement and food... The joyous mutton chops took my heart away and then comes my sizzled bhetki in pickled garlic and the food was amazing.. the entire dish came with cooked herb rice, my fav kolmi shak and the awesome bhetki curry and i totally cleared my plate. My fiancée took chicken supreme in pomegranate & mustard but sadly the dish was ok and had a strange smell but again it was sort of innovative dish.. Finally we took death by chocolate for me & malpua cheesecake for him and they were soooo good... Am coming back soon for more... Simply soooo goood............

Sacrilege, it was, to experiment with Bengali cuisine. No more. Fantastic fusion is the word. Starters to main course to desserts, an unique experience. 
Must try
Starters : Chilli pickle & cheese baked crab & Vodka soaked prawns.
Desserts : Spiced mango souffle & Malpua cheese cake
Beverages : Gondhoraj julep

Bit irritating : house is too noisy when full,. ( call a sound expert or just drape the walls)

Wish : Wine to order.

It's the most interesting addition to Calcutta's food scene in the last many years. First things first, I was told that the lamb chops are good. It's okay. But the rest makes for a memorable meal. What chef Joy has done is combine unusual flavours seamlessly. A small portion of saag appearing from nowhere or the way food is served, it's great. Here's a restaurant that dares to experiment and mostly comes away successful. But to eat at Bohemian one needs to be in a certain frame of mind -- an experimental frame of mind, which doesn't happen often. Also, the lack of alcohol may keep people away. So, hats off to chef Joy, please continue with your experimentation.

Unbelievably good. The only catch is you need to be open to the idea of experimentation - Bengali cuisine on a fusion pallet may not be everyone's cup of team. But if you go there, I assure you will never regret. A bit on the premium side, but the quality of food will never let you feel the pinch. One word of caution - you need to have prior reservation else there can be long queues.

A refreshing change from the conventional dining options in the city,Bohemian is highly recommended for those who like to experiment with their food.the distinct flavours do justice to the fusion menu.The Devilled mushrooms and the chicken tetrazzini are must-tries.

The dessert menu is also different from the standard fare.The Gondhoraj Souffle is an interesting concoction but doesnt match up to the sumptuous Death by chocolate.

The place resembles a small cafe and tends to get rather noisy .it doesn't make for a good choice if a quiet and/or a quick meal is what you have in mind.

Bohemian is a restuarant which can never go wrong with their food. They have created a niche for themselves by chef Joy's sheer creativity and innovation with bengali cuisine. I am a frequent visitor of Bohemian and they have never dissatisfied me. This time I ordered my favourite appetizer baked crab with kolmi greens and it was awesome as usual, just melting in my mouth. I tasted their salad for the first time, Porky indulgence and it was delicious with generous chunks of pork and bacon. For the main dish I tried their pan-braised bhetki with aam ada sauce which was also pretty good. And last but not the least for dessert I had yoghurt and kalojeera brulee which was exceptional as usual. I wish Chef Joy and Bohemian every success in their journey of creating such innovative and mouth-watering cuisine.

This is truly a different experience altogether! The place dishes out the most delicious surprises ever. This is innovation at its best! The menu is quite extensive with a lot of variety. Nobody will feel left out. Appetizers to drinks, main course, sides, desserts...you name it! Its just a whole world of surprises for the Calcuttan Foodie.

I have visited the place twice. On one occasion I ordered Baked Crab for the appetizer. It was simply mindblowing. I strongly recommend it. All the main course items seem inviting. I would suggest trying the ones with Mustard and Mango in them. They are used very skillfully by the chef. THe bacon wrapped chicken was also most satisfying. For folks looking to experiment with gondhoraj lebu dishes, in my personal opinion, though the taste is always refreshingly different and enjoyable, having an entire dish becomes difficult for me because it tastes a little bitter.

Go bonkers over the desserts. There are a number of cheesecakes and mousse with shocking Bengali twists available!

What an unconventional & unique experience @ bohemian. Eating experience revisited with such creativity :)
The Vekti with cheese & chilli took us to surprise at the start. Regret the too small quantity! Even a veg starter with cottage cheese blew me off. I understood what is called perfectly golden fried in all corners!
I never had parshe fillets in any bengali restaurants ever before & hence was pleasantly surprised. Even the bori polau with kolmi saak & chicken in radhuni sauce dish was amazing :) & bohemian kept me gastronomically satisfied with The mutton vindallo, the dhaniakhali murgi & the gondhoraj prawns!
The staff were polite & the ambiance pleasant. My only complaint can be too short a place for this exceptional experience. 
NB: Extra plain rice to be ordered along with all main course dishes for male adults. 
Looking to change your taste buds? Be a Bohemian !

What was avant-garde almost a year back, has evolved into one of the most celebrated eating joints in south Calcutta. Here is a short account of my first visit to the phenomenon called Bohemia.
"But the real revelation was tonight's dinner @ Bohemian - Bacon wrapped prawn struck a sharp taste while Daab ar Gandhoraj diye Shobji'r Monihara had a never-had-before tweak. Add to the lineup (albeit named Calcutta-style) Pork Vindaloo with the distinctive Goan flavor. Hope chef Joy Banerjee continues to bring joy to the unquenchable palates of Calcuttawalas in future."

Ah how do I start. The moment you enter (that is if you get an entry considering that the place has a huge guest list of people trying to get a chance to taste ecstacy) you will be greeted with a face wipe that makes you feel blessed in the eastern heat. The menu is nothing but extra ordinary. You shall feel blessed just by going through the description. The place is small yet wonderful in the decor.
Can't recollect all the names of the dishes but just trt what you like and it will turn good.

Expand expand expand. Only suggestion I can think of, everything else is only to cherish and enjoy here. When I ordered our lunch, I opted for seafood linguini, the waiter has informed us their squid is out of stock, so, we had radhuni enriched bekti in curry sauce, devilled mushroom with stuffed fowl and chicken tetrazinni. We ordered mocktails which were great with bengali gandhoraj wedges, very refreshing (though very tiny in quantity). The real shock was when I sliced the hot crispy stuffed devilled mushroom and poured it into my mouth after moistning with fee drops of sweet chilli oil sauce, i was in 7th heaven. Yummy, yummy yummy, who created this? chef Joy? Must be a gastronomic artist. What a kicking good taste. The tetrazinni and the radhuni enriched bekti were  as good as our starter if not more, even the water spinach provided with bori crust was so good that my mouth is still watering to remember. Staff is very helpful and honest, they actually warned us not to make further order until we finish our first two mains. They were right, very sumptuous huge portions. We have had difficulty in finishing only our single mains. The finishing was with malpoa cheesecake, not as good as the starters or mains though, but, very creatively engineered and portrayed on the dish. A wonderful memory which we definitely reproduce very often. A must try restaurant for anybody who lives in or visits Kolkata.

Bohemian is good for those who like to experiment food for sure. The concoctions that are brought on by Chef Joymalaya is indeed fantastic. The restro.. is a little small but yet its cute and cozy, it has a warm atmosphere. Although my visit to Bohemian was around two weeks back but i do see any harm in writing a few lines about this lovely restro... the food was good i liked the chicken wrapped in beacon and the jumbo prawns and few other dishes names oops!!! sorry chief i cannot recall the items i ate. But Bohemian is a good restro and is recommended.

Bohemian is an excellent place for people who want to surprise their taste buds with subtle combinations of flavors embedded in Bengali and Continental cuisine. I personally don't like the idea of having Bengali food outside my home but this restaurant with its bold and intriguing menu drove me to it for lunch at 3 p.m right before they were closing down for their evening shift. The place was packed since it was a Sunday. However the Manager requested that we wait just as if it would be worthwhile to do so.. and guess what? It was. 
 
The first thing one might notice are the numerous flyers and posters of various artists from the rock'n'roll era, giving a very tasteful look to the interiors. 

As for food, we had Royal Bengali Roast Mutton and Classic Chicken Roast in mushroom sauce for mains, which were delicious and quite sumptuous. For drinks we had Mint and Cucumber Refresher which is aptly named and lastly which stole the show was the Yoghurt and Kalojeere Brulee(which was magical) and the Malpua Cheesecake. By the end of it, our lunch was more than satisfactory and we took an oath to visit the place soon to try out other intriguing items on their menu.

In the past couple of years - I have had multiple people recommend Bohemian multiple times. It has taken people in Kolkata by suprise with its twist with bengali cuisine.

The core essence of Bohemian remains that if Bengali's can become Globalized why not Bengali cuisine ? Amazing concept and very well executed.

Start with Gondhoraj Jullep to Royal Bengal Mutton Roast to Malpua Cheese cake - everything was just amazing. Add to that some Murshadabadi Sashliks, Keema Wraps and Fish fingers to start. You want to experiment with Lemon fragranced prawns , the Chicken in Radhuni sausce and Bhetki in Berry sauce . Its an amazing journey - loved each and every element on the way.

Will certainly go there to see what it has in store and if it can keep suprising me again and again.

I took a parcel from here last week.

Mutton chops, Jumbo Prawn with cheese, Mutton with baby onions with Gondhorak & Pineapple Roast Souffle.
Total came to 1.5k.
Although I saw a lot of complains earlier, though I found the quantity adequate.
Price wise, you pay for what you get so wasn't disappointed in this too. 
Taste wise, the jumbo prawns were stellar. Though the mutton chops had a tad too much going on for taste for my palate.

4 out of 5.

okay let me just make it simple ! just visualize yourself doing this ! one fine sunday morning you just get up and feel to try something off beat and good place to hang out with your family .one thought ,the place for you is BOHEMIAN. well this word means unconventional and the food being served there justifies the name .....

STARTERS
they have amazing starters and all of dem are really offbeat ..I tried Chili Pickle n Cheese Baked Crab and corn which was just out of the world....apart from that vodka dipped prawn is also real good !!

MAIN COURSE

i took bhetki mach platter with mustard sauce and coriander.And trust me ,it was really great !! the smooth aroma of coriander with swing of mustard was out of the world...overall a very mild taste with exact quantity of rice and a side dish of saag was something which was really different.

DESSERT
As they say the best part of the food is dessert ...and bohemian did prove this particular point...i tried the gondhoraj souffle and malpoa cheesecake ..personally i DO not LIKE sweetS so i didnt like the malpoa cheese cake as i felt it was too sweet.

but the gondhoraj souffle is just amazing. soft souffle makes you forget everything ....the small bits and pieces of gondhoraj lebu makes a interesting magic and castes a spell !!

PRICING

ill rate it little too much to the heavier side ....the platters are good but pricing can be done more reasonably ! but as they say ,,monopoly wins the price ..you will never find dese dishes any where and therefore bohemian makes pay soo much !!

BUT ANYWAY ONCE IN A BLUEMOON KINDA RESTAURANT !!

A WORLD FULL OF UNIQUE DISHES AND CRAZY CREATIONS = BOHEMIAN !

This is a place which the city perhaps needed. I will not agree with most of the reviewers who say that the dishes are overpriced. They are fairly correctly priced, even if they are slightly on the higher end. Some of the dishes are truly brilliant. The sauce served with the bacon wrapped prawns had this amazing hint of oranges which completely blew my mind. That dish as a whole is among the best appetisers I have had in a while. The vodka soaked prawns were good as well, but after the first whack of flavour, I doubt anything could have satisfied me.

The ham steak, the parshe and the mutton chops were really good. Was especially fascinated with the ham steak which was wonderful. Flavours, texture, it had everything one could ask for. Was not quite smitten by the cucumber something chicken. The chicken in itself was not very something to be overly impressed by and that was perhaps the only disappointing plate of food I tasted. Loved the gondhoraj sorbet and the mint julep. Very subtle flavours.

The gondhoraj souffle, the cheesecake malpua and the death by chocolate stand up on their own as excellent individual dishes. I was personally really looking forward to the cheesecake malpua, but was slightly less impressed with it. Everyone else on my table really liked it, so it might have just been a personal preference issue. The gondhoraj souffle was on the subtle end and the death by chocolate was on the rich end. Both were great.

My only gripe was the slightly cramped seating which did took me off my comfort level. I mean if you are serving such good food, you shouldn't have people having to concentrate on whether they have enough elbow room. But that is a minor issue. The thing about serving an excellent plate of food (and in this case, quite a few good plates of food) is the fact that you can tend to forgive anything and everything else almost. And if I have to be overcritical, I would complain about the bread they serve with the food. A bit too dry.

Reserving a table is an absolute must. I would love to go back again. Was a wonderful evening to be honest.

Update: Visited the place a second time and the place still continues to amaze my tastebuds. Putting up pictures instead of another full review.

Chef Joy Banerjee has opened the doors to experimentation. The moment you see the menu of Bohemian, you notice words that have been regularly used in our staple Bengali diet, but unlike what we have ever tried before. We normally shy away from "shei Bangali khabar" when we dine out, but Bohemian is all set to change that habit in us. Chef Banerjee has used known spices and recipes from our Mother and Grandmother's kitchen and has transformed them into a global dining experience. The palate is so subtle in its newness that even Bengalis who have grown up with these flavours, discover something new with every spoonful.

Unlike other restaurants where the waiters politely take down whatever you order, suggesting only when asked, here the people are encouraged to assist the diners to choose the best from the menu, for a great culinary experience. 

The menu is detailed and thorough, with ample choices among appetizers, salads, mains and desert. The restaurant doesn't serve liquor, but there are some interesting sorbets and mocktails to choose from.

The top pick in appetizers are the Vodka Soaked Prawns with Grilled Garlic Aioli, Joyous Mutton Chops, Lemon Chicken on Lemon Skewers and Chilli Pickle and Cheese Baked Crab with Kolmi Greens. This last item is a treat. Served in an earthen bowl, like the one on which 'firni' is served; it is delicious and you are left wanting more. There are some healthy options for salads, with lots of greens and it is served with garlic bread on the side. To wash down your food, try the refreshing Orange and Aaam Adaa Sorbet, or drink up a Sex on the Beach.

Bohemian serves all their mains with rice and Kolmi greens. They also decorate the sides of the dish with sprinkled spices. For main course, Bohemian has some good options and you are almost at a loss as to what to choose. Dig into their Bhekti in Bengal Berry Sauce, Steamed Breast of Chicken with Radhuni enriched curry sauce, Prawns stewed with Spicy Alphonso Sauce and Adaa Mouri Mangsho. There are numerous vegetarian options as well. You can dig into a dish of Mushroom and Pineapple Skewers with Spicy Coriander and Kalojeera, Cauliflower and Peas in Lemon, Chilli and Coconut Cream.

The service is fast, with food reaching the table in 15 minutes top!! Once you taste the food, you will be left exclaiming in delight. The sauces are well seasoned and the poultry, meat and fish well cooked and tender. You will never realise that your traditional Bengali spices could create such delicious fusion food.

Everybody loves a round of dessert to wrap up and Bohemian excels here as well. They have a Malpoa Cheese Cake that is the talk of the town. If you are someone who is a die-hard chocolate fan, then the 'Death by Chocolate' will surely leave you stunned. The smooth luscious chocolate served in a Cognac glass, tempts you to try some more. You can also try Yoghurt and Kalojeera Brulee, and Gondhoraj Souffle.

The only problem when it comes to dessert is that the portions are not the same for everyone, so you might be stuck with a diner who gets a bigger looking portion than you.

Bohemian adds to its culinary experience with its hippy decor. There is a display of rock and roll posters in the front while the walls have framed photos of tarot cards. The eccentric nature of the decor is extended even to the loo; it has bright colourful walls with lyrics from famous Bengali songs scribbled all over.

Bohemian is a little over priced, with most of the food items priced between Rs. 150 - 350. A meal for two would cost you around Rs. 1300 (without taxes). A small restaurant with a maximum capacity of 30-40 people, it is always recommended that you book in advance.
If you want to experiment with food, then you should surely visit Bohemian. Tuck into the delicious fusion food and get in touch with your Bonghippy side!

Our choice of starters - Vodka Soaked Prawns, Bacon Wrapped Prawns and Chili Pickle n Cheese Baked Crab with Kolmi Greens were 'ek se bad kar ek'. I liked the second one better than the first, while the last one was extraordinary to my taste buds.The main course was as delightful and unique as the starters with every dish cooked to perfection. I did not like the cocktail with strawberry, orange and ginger ale. The palate cleansers are another unique concept and tastes refreshing and so are the desserts. Service was prompt and the staff were polite and helpful. I would like to give 5/5 for the dining experience and deduct half a star because we had to wait for 50 minutes. Even though the space is cramped and the seating arrangement is not very comfortable, the gastronomical meal that will follow more than makes up for it. A big thumbs up for this one!

Bohemian, the restaurant is true to its name. It's food is bohemian--unconventional. Who would have thought to mix diverse flavours like crabs, cheese and kolmi shaag? 

Who else but the masterchef, Joy Bannerjee himself! For those who have been lucky enough to taste The Chilli Pickle and Cheese Baked Kolmi Greens, it's an oral orgasm, served in a maatir motka. ( they have been serving the same prep. in prawn, but its nearly not that good.
The bacon wrapped chicken is also a starter par excellence. 

Amongst the salads, the Fragrant dream is the best. The Gondhoraj is almost hero in the tale of Bohemian. With its thick chunks of cheese it's a perfect link into the main course from the appetizer section.

While changing courses, do not forget to cleanse your palate with the selections of sorbets. My personal favourite is the Gondhoraj sorbet. The Green mango sorbet is pretty good too .

In the main course, from the seafood section, i like the Jumbo prawns with chilli pickle and cheese. Its out of the world :)
The bacon wrapped chicken supreme bundles and the ham steak require special mention too.
The malpua cheese cake, Mustard and tender coconut mousse and the death by chocolate, sheer sinful. I am salivating as i write this review. Time to dry wipe the keyboard. :S

On a more serious note, the place is a little overpriced, but you get what you pay for. Its a niche restaurant and its awesome. The staff is well mannered, the decor, awesome. 
The bathroom has a psychedelic thing about it. " What a strange trip, this has been" is graffitied on one wall. Reservation is recommended, because its always full. Full of people who love good food. Chef Joy creates a masterpiece every time.
Highly recommended.

My third time in this restaurant, and it never fails to impress me. Every time I leave the restaurant, I am a happy lady. Who knew experimental Bengali cuisine could be so tasty. Last evening, we suddenly decided to drop in. Thankfully we reached there by 7:30 pm, else it would have been impossible to get us a seat.

The menu leaves you spoilt for choice. Every item shouts "try me" at you, and if you are a foodie like us, its very difficult to ignore those little pieces of heaven. To top it, they had the special menu for their "Stay Cool" event, and we took quite some time in deciding what to try.

I ordered a Mocha Slush, while he settled for a Fennel and Rock Sugar Sorbet. The drink was a perfection, the first sip leaving me feeling happy about the evening. For appetizers, we ordered for Vodka Soaked Prawns with Grilled Garlic Aioli, Chilli Pickle and Cheese Baked Crab with Kalmi greens and Joyous Mutton Chops. The prawns were delicious, juicy and heavenly, the mutton wonderful as always, but it was the crabmeat that stole the show. One spoon of it, and we went "Wow!"

For the main course, we went with the special menu and ordered Chicken Breast stuffed with Lychees and Coriander stewed in fresh Dill, and the Sliced Pork and Baby Turmeric in Banana Leaf Envelopes. Both the dishes were epitomes of fusion cuisine gone absolutely perfect. The chicken breasts were juicy and tender, with the occasional lychee taste in your mouth, the spices on the lower side, making it an absolute contrast to the pork that was loaded with the distinct flavours of turmeric and mustard. Absolute gastronomical heaven!

Though we were too full for desserts by this time, who can give their yummy desserts menu a pass? I went for the all time favourite Death by Chocolate (dark chocolate and rum mousse inter layered with dark chocolate cake), while he opted for the Spiced Mango Souffle (a tweaked alphonso souffle enhanced with cracked pepper and other spices). Both were little bundles of joy, the DBC the best I have ever had.

Finally, they serve little complimentary pieces of sinful dark chocolate. All these came to around Rs. 2,600/- and we left feeling happy and contended. This is one place I would love to visit again and again.

went to bohemian for the first time. had heard of the place n so expectations were high. but to be frank they surpassed our expectations. ambience was average. food was just awesome. we ordered murshidabadi sashliks which were mouth watering. we ordered three non veg main course items namely 
1. bacon wrapped chicken in aam kashundi reduction
2. royal bengal roast mutton with bhuna sauce
3. panchforon flavoured parshe fish
you won't believe that till now I have not been able to decide which among these was d best. all of them were perfect fusion and so different from each other....
the desserts malpua cheesecake and smoked pineapple souffle were perfect endings.
it was as if my taste buds were in a vacation to a place of fantasy where there r snow capped mountains, dense green forests and clear sea beaches all together at the same place...
had one of my best dinners in years. ..
highly recommended. .

Another lunch with my family @Bohemian :-)

Its small but the best restro in town serving Bengali cuisine very correctly blended with European essence...everything they serve is right to perfection,but yes again over priced. Otherwise it deserves all the 5 points.

One point I noted- the number of pieces in starters and main course are multiples of 3. Three Bhetki..3 mutton chops..6 prawns..6 chicken skewers etc etc! so for sharing its best if you have a group of 3 ;-)

Ambience is nice and clean. Service is quick.
Our first choice crab with cheese and pickle wasn't available..I wonder how a signature dish of a place is not in stock!
Anyway,we ordered 2 starters-
1.Vodka Soaked Prawns- 6 pieces of single bite sized prawns costs 400! too much! it took less than a minute for 4 of us to finish it even before we could appreciate the taste. I liked it with the dip n wished to have the entire plate.
2.Joyous mutton chops- 3 pieces of mutton cooked in a spicy gravy at Rs 250..again wow! The only hitch why don't they give an extra piece for easy sharing?

Both the starters were crackers but we weren't much happy for Rs 650. Its normal that a couple orders 1 starter, and 4 people will order 2..I wonder why  the restaurant authority set such absurd quantities!

Next we ordered 4  main courses-
All of them came with a moderately filling quantity of steamed rice.the authority assumes only girls, specially celebs on diet visit their place :-P otherwise would have been generous enough to increase the mass by its 1/3 where they charge 300-400 per dish!over it,an extra bowl of steamed rice costs another 100 bucks..
Helllo!! its Kolkata..n you get a kilo of Basmati in that price..and these people take the same for boiling a spoonful of it!

Next there is no option for regular water.
But now coming to food which literally lingers your taste buds for days to come..we had-
1. Bhetki with Radhuni sauce- 3 fillets in spicy Radhuni gravy. Excellent!
2. Prawns with Alphonso cream- 6 pieces of small prawns in a sweet gravy which was innovative but failed to impress us. It was too sweet for my palate.
3. Bhetki with Blue Berry Sauce-  Unique! it was nice with the Kuler Achar flavour.but for me,the Radhuni one was better.
4. Kancha Lonka Mangsho- Mutton pieces in dark green chilli gravy. For this one was outstanding! Our ultimate finish was superb!

Next is my all time favourite desert section where I feel like trying everything available and this time we ordered 3 [their favourite ;-) ]
1. Gondhoraj Souffle,
2. Malpua Cheesecake
and chocolate maniacs should keep their eyes closed and go for Death by Chocolate...rich dark chocolate souffle with chocolate chips! Heaven!

Among the former two, Malpua Cheese Cake is a better one..again the soufflés were served in varyingly miserable quantities.

Bohemian fails to understand we foodies come here to spend generously, expecting the restaurant serves us with generous amount of food!
Lastly we were given a cube of dark chocolate each complimentary instead of regular saunf and pan masala. That was appreciated.
On a whole, I don't prefer spending on Bengali food,which we get at home..but this place was magical!
i would like to go back here innumerable times :-D

I went there two times.
Good things are - Food (4/5), Decor.
Bad - Space, A.C. Sitting arrangement, Furniture (3/5)...

I went there with my Mrs. and tried Bhetki-Gondhoraj/ Panchforan-Parse/ Prawn-Gondharaj/ Breast of Chicken with enriched curry sauce like that, in Main course. (Mocha Mousse in Dessert,that was not good.)
Those were delicious and very good taste. For their food we want to go again...
But Space is so small, for couple (two person) there is only one place near gate, this is far away from A.C. it is very irritating. Other than Weekend it was silent, so you can enjoy anytime without prior appo.
About sitting arrngmnt and furniture those are very bad and non comfortable. Overall-3.5/5.

Fusion food cant get better than this!! Atleast not in Kolkata. Just to read the menu itself,  makes you wonder and salivate at the same time and the taste takes it to a different level!

The sorbets are absolutely refreshing and delightful!! Everything else on the menu is worth trying. I have just been twice to this place and so far, I am IMPRESSED with the food!

When it comes to the ambience, The place is a little cramped up and the absence of a bar really leaves a gap in your experience given that you would be enjoying food which is of the fine dining levels!!

Nevertheless, Its definitely a place I would want to re-visit time and again!!

Passionately recommended by an old friend, who also happens to be a trustworthy foodie, my wife and I landed up on a rainy Sunday morning. We were lucky to find a table right-away. Strangely, what I liked first about the place was not the Food, it was the Music ! They happen to play just my kind of music, tender, melodious numbers from the golden 80's. Suggestions kept pouring into my phone's message inbox as we ordered our starters - Vodka Soaked Prawns and Murshidabadi Chicken Shashliks. While the former was an instant winner, the latter could have done better had the chicken been just a tad softer, but nothing major, really. We chose Gondhoraj Julep to go with it, and it was a refreshing change from the very common Fresh Lime Soda or Aerated options that we normally tend to choose.

For Mains, we ordered "Sizzled Bhetki simmered with Pickled Garlic" and "Bacon-wrapped Chicken Supreme Bundles". Both came with portions of steamed rice and the trademark Kolmi Greens, and both were splendid. If you have a thing for tasty gravies like I do, you'll love most of their offerings. For dessert, we tried "Malpua Cheesecake" and "Gondhoraj Souffle". I liked the Cheesecake more, to be honest, but that maybe due to a dominant sweet tooth that I possess.

The Ambiance is nice and relaxed. There isn't much space to spread your legs, but I am willing to compromise on that front if the food keeps me busy, which was the case precisely.

The price is on the higher side, but justified. I am a Food Photographer by profession and over the next few months I have had the opportunity to go back several times for different shoots for Food magazines and publications, which has also given me an opportunity to have a peep at their kitchen, which, trust me, is as clean as it gets.

"Bohemian" --- Neither the owner is from Bohemia nor their lifestyle is. But truly their taste of food defines and justifies the name itself. It is completely unique, rather I should say the tastes are total fusion of different continents. You may also say as experimental, but definitely they came out with a Bang of good taste. 

I had only 1 visit there till now, but it was enough to enjoy few dishes and make my mind to visit again very soon. I liked Chicken Tossed with Pomegranate very much, Mutton Roast was tasty as well. Hope my taste buds will meet some more exciting fishes next time.

Apart from the food one thing to be said, the place is really very small. Prior reservation is recommended and the service is a bit slow. Though I never care much about it.... but it may seem a little irritating for few.

But overall must go 'Taste' for me.... 

Food- 4.5/5
Ambiance- 3/5
Service- 3.5/5
Value for money- 4/5

Overall - 4/5

it's just a small place...... and at times you need to wait for a long time.....
the good thing is that they take reservations.... anything is good here and please try the sweet dishes... the gandhoraj mousse and the mango mousse are a must.
they also have great snacks to munch in the evening... with juicy salads and burgers at times. 
people can also try their picnic basket

First of all - this restaurant is neither 100% continental nor 100% Bengali but a mixture of both.
A small place ( capacity of at max 25-30 person ) , very neat and clean as well as relaxing environment. The theme of the restaurant though a bit confusing - "Bohemian" literally means socially unconventional and to go with this approach they mixed tarots,black arts,Morrison all in one place!!
Now coming to the food - If you are a real foodie and ready to experiment with your food then this place is a must visit for you. You may be sad with a few of your choices from the menu, but believe me every taste will be almost a new one. Since the place is small and staff are less too, they took time to serve the order but the good part is that every thing is freshly made. 
Apart from some real continental dishes ( with squid too!! ), those Bengali ones which are made with a continental style are also recommendable ( if not better ). 
Staff behavior is also good (they are a little slow though). Though it is a bit on the expensive side, a good place for casual hang out with friends while having delicious fusion foods.

The place is too small with a lot of waiting time. I had to wait for 45mins to get a table for 2. The waiters are ill trained and rookie and lack professional courtesy. The restaurant is short staffed as there are only 3waiters. They don't even serve you the water and just place a mineral water bottle on the table. I ordered steamed betki in appetizer and gandharaj betki and chicken roast in main course. The appetizer was served after 40mins and the main course after 1hour which is too long preparation time and I got frustrated. The ambience is also pretty bad with no privacy from the street and tables are poorly arranged.  The food is good but no good enough to negate all these factors. They took more than 20mins to prepare my cheque and I spoiled my evening here totally.

This place is a must visit ppl. The place is quite small with a maximum seating capacity of no more than 35 But the quality and the consistence of quality and most importantly the taste of the food is a super thumbs up. Awesome fusion of Bengali an continental cuisine, in a way which is so refreshing and is orgasmic to the taste buds. Very good service by the staff though the waiting time for food is a tad bit longer. 

The prawn wrapped with bacon, the mustard crab meat and the gondhoraj prawns are so awesome that Thy will make you flip.

Was expecting great things from Bohemian. A little disappointed I must say. Order a bhetki dish where the combination of spices was a little weird. The radhuni chicken was excellent but way too spicy. The bacon wrapped prawns were strictly okay. The gandharaj jus was excellent. 
Ambience was quite ordinary and so was the service. The crowd was mostly collegial and not someplace where you do a romantic date.

its a small little jaunt very close to ballygunge phari autostand.they have this cute little interior which is very relaxing with its appropriate lighting.the menu suggest a mix-and -match selection,as they are calling it fusion food.bohemian,the name probably suggests that already.there is no definite "gharana" /cuisine here.you can try between a bengali starter and a continental risotto side with some english main dish and  north indian dessert and feel good about your choices because they make them really nice.the pocket pinch is there-a bit on the steeper  side than to your liking.but it has a special impromptu "adda" environment which would enable you to have a quality time with your delectable date.

If you are looking for a cozy atmosphere, great tasting food, look no further. Fusion tastes at their level best! While the more traditionalist would grapple with the food here, it would be in the wish list for those who love experimenting with their taste bud. My only wish is that we could have some great tasting wine with the food.

This is best restaurant I have experienced in recent times.
Bohemian leaves other behind by sheer quality.
Start with Gandhoraj Julep which is awesome.
Then take a starter with prawn or assorted non-veg.
Followed by main course with kacha-lanka mangsho or sizzled bhekti or gandhoraaj.
Do not forget to try Dessert like Gondhoraj Suffle,Cheese malpua or coconut mussee.

The avg price per head comes to Rs.600/

But one must experience this restaurant.

This restaurant is a good one, located in a very decent and convenient place I would say. I was pretty impressed my their interiors. The ambience is quite relaxing and stylish. It gives you a perfect feeling of fine dining. 
Now talking about the food it is very well done and the meat simply melts in your mouth. Even their mushroom preparations are delectable and a must try. After a long time  I had good authentic Italian food in Kolkata. The prices are a bit high but you wouldn't mind after you taste their scrumptious food. 
I rate it 4 and I did have a splendid time and really enjoyed my meal peacefully. You should definitely try their food without fail.

Bohemian.. The name itself now brings back happy memories.. Three of our friends had visited the place wanting to try out the fusion food of Italian and Indian specifically Bengali... All of us are light eaters but oh boy that day did we eat.. Started off with Panchforon flavoured chicken escallops, joyous mutton chops and a selection of mocktails.. The chicken was tender and the mutton chops done to perfection..Then came Abyss--- an out of the world seafood platter which made us sigh with content. Had gandharaj sorbet as pallete cleanser and went on to have Bhetki with radhuni infused curry, Prawns in spicy alphonso cream and Bacon wrapped chicken with aam-kasundi reduction.. All of these left us crving for more but we reaaly were so full..Then came the desserts-- roasted pineapple souffle and yoghurt and kalojeera brulee--- two very quirky dishes. The bill came as not too high when compared to the amount of food, the quality of food, the innovativeness and not to forget the profound contentment it brought to us only comparable to ones mother's home-cooked meals.. Waiting eagerly for the next time we visit this place and the next until we have checked out all they have to offer and then start over again.....

Of the new restaurants that I have been to over the last year or so, Bohemian has been the one that has impressed me most. I am not a fan of "fusion" food, but I will confess that I have enjoyed virtually every dish I have ordered there. Since the range of dishes ordered spans starters, salads, main course items, desserts and beverages, it is an impressive feat on Bohemian's part.

The beverages are interesting. While standard items like the Mint Julep and the Fresh Lime Soda are available, the Gandharaj Julep is my drink of choice, with its unusual combination (in a restaurant, that is) of coriander leaves and cut lemons bobbing about in the glass. Changes the taste of the standard lemonade completely.

For starters, the Vodka Soaked Prawns with Aioli and the Bacon Wrapped Prawns are particularly good. The "Joyous" Mutton Chops are also very good, but should be treated as a main-course dish on account of the quantity served.

Most of the items on offer are slightly tweaked versions of standard dishes. The fish items are possibly the best things on offer, but the Anglo-Indian Pork Curry and the Royal Bengal Mutton are also good. I also liked the Spaghetti with Bolognaise Sauce very much. The use of lightly flavoured rice, boiled/stir-fried vegetables and tossed spinach as accompaniments to main dishes is much appreciated. Some of the vegetarian dishes are also superb, with their innovative use of Bengali spices.

For those who like salads, the Roast Chicken Salad and the Abyss are recommended. I liked the way in which boris were used instead of croutons for crunchiness.

The high point(s) are the desserts. My personal favourites are the Chhana Paanchphoron Mousse and the Kalojeere Creme Brulee. Those who find these two extreme might opt for the Gandharaj Souffle, the Malpua Cheesecake or the regular Death by Chocolate. The Daab Shorshe Mousse varies - sometimes, the mustard overwhelms the taste of the tender coconut.

The small size of the place is a boon - one does not suffer hordes. Service is not too fast, but worth the wait. The only suggestions I have would be that the restaurant not insist that customers buy packaged drinking water (installing an Aquaguard machine/similar water filter is surely not that difficult!) and that they speed up the billing process. Overall, an excellent place to visit for a long, relaxed meal.

Bohemian is my favourite joint. They are very innovative and eating out there,adds a different flavourte one's taste bud. The service is good. They are very courteous as well. However Bohemian should add a personal touch to their customers to make them feel special.. Recently we went to celebrate our friends birthday in Zara for snacks and drinks.We were really touched at their gesture. As they got to know about my friends birthday then all came and wished her. The waiters danced in a Spanish style and presented a small cake. They stood and made her cut the cake as well. We went to have dinner at Benzarong. They also came and wished her and presented her a platter of fruits and fried ice cream. We went to celebrate another friend's birthday in Bohemian. In spite of knowing it the waiters stewards were not bothered at all.
I think these are the small gestures Bohemian should start implementing.

Being a typical bengali food lover I sometimes mob into these kind of restaurants which serve authentic bengali foods. I added bohemian in my wishlist months ago and finally I got a chance to visit this.
  My first experience after entering bohemian was descent. A neat and clean ambiance filled up with authentic bengali odour. The service was fast as it was badly needed, we were very hungry. I would like to suggest sizzled bhetki as it was awesome in taste. The spice touches my soul also.
Overall a good place to take your family with. Thumbs up from my end :)

This place has got a name to itself over the last year or so. Very limited capacity and requires prior booking. Chef joy personally looks around of everything being served. The restaurant has a nice ambience and the staff is courteous too. 
Coming to what they are famous for i.e. Food. They serve what generally known bengali continental fusion. Do rry out their signature dishes like bacon wrapped prawn, joyous mutton chops, gondhoraj chicken, spinach pabda. Also their desserts are awesome specially malpua cheese cake. 
Since all foods are prepared after order, so turnaround time is slow. Price is also on the higher side. Expensive experimentation of bengali fare in continental style.

I went to bohemian just coz everyone hyped it so much...and sure enpugh it didn live up to the hype...I had the vodka soaked prawns which had no trace of vodka in them..and the protion was tiny, the prawns wernt all that well done and gave me a runny stomach the next day, which just proves that they wernt fresh or wernt cleaned well enough...I also ordered the chicken supreme bundles which were a fair portion for 1 person...the bundles were wrapped in bacon which had more fat than required..however they were tasty...for desert I ordered a death by choclate..and it totally lived up to its name...it was awesomtastic...but again the miserly portion was not worth the price..the ambience is ok..nothing excaptional and the staff was also average just doing their job well...overall, its a one time visit place, unless u don't mind goin there just for dessert. A special mention to the fact that they did not charge extra for the water..

Doing full justice to its name-an eat-out at Bohemian is indeed a culinary adventure to say the least. The yellow walls with an ensemble of tarot cards and rock music boards coupled with neatly arranged wooden chairs and tables immediately recreate the aura of an European cafe. Then the moment you make yourself comfortable in the cosy ambience of the place the fusion (english rock + bengali) music in the background sets the tone for the rest of your time in Bohemian. And the primary reason why one should be at Bohemian-the food aaaaaah!  

The food at Bohemian is created with a quirky mix of the western and the quintessential bengali ingredients like kashundi, radhuni, panchphoran and kolmi greens.  The place offers a wide selection of fishy and meaty appetisers. My three course meal kick started with the 'vodka soaked prawns dipped in grilled garlic aioli' (essentially French mayonnaise). The perfectly cooked tender and juicy prawns exuded the right balance of sweetness from vodka and the tanginess of mustard from the aioli. The next few pages of the menu was composed of a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian salads followed by their 'drink-in-between-meal' section rightly termed as the 'palate cleansers'. The correct mix of freshness from lime, mint and honey with the seasonal fruits  is sure to refresh your taste-buds before indulging into their mains. Their mains contained many different fish, mutton and chicken preparations. Their elaborate fish preparations encompassing  a variety of fishes from bhetki, tilapia, prawns and pabda are surely going to leave you confused. I was however longing to have some meaty indulgence and headed straight to my favourite meat form-pork. The slow cooked 'pork chops in a slightly sweet cheesy apple sauce' perfectly complemented with bread rolls and tossed vegetables was the one to die for. The juicy and succulent pork pieces immediately melt into your mouth leaving a cheesy after-effect from the sauce. You just cannot stop saying wow! 

The most enticing part in the Bohemian menu is however the 'desserts'. A glance at the menu and you would gasp at the strange experimental concoctions but nevertheless you would like to have a bite from each one of them. I however had to restrict myself to two only. The 'chhana and panchphoron (bengal five spice) mousse' is the most experimental dessert I have had till date.  The smooth texture of the mousse with neither the chhana nor the panchphoron being too overpowering was absolutely heavenly.  'Death by chocolate' on the other hand with the rich blend of dark gooey chocolate, rum and a layer of chocolate cake in between was just perfect to bring an end to the magical eating experience.

Be at Bohemian if you love experimenting with food. Be there if you like to think out of the box and are not too traditional with your tastes. Be there if you love good food with good music. Bohemian provides a totally satisfying eating experience serving generous portions of food at a reasonable budget.  Just wish that the place was more spread-out providing a larger seating capacity. 

If 'Fat Duck' revolutionised the food business in London then Bohemian is all set to do the same for Kolkata. Kudos  Kolkata for bringing in Bohemian. 

Chantry!

Bohemian serves modern bengali and italian cuisines. It is located at Ballygunge. They royal bengal fish fingers and garlic and coriander keema wraps is well cooked. The combos are tasty too. Prawn stewed with spicy alphonso cream is too good. Pork is also available here. Ambience is nice and staff is polite. The alfredo pasta is delectable too. 
i would rate 3.5 for BOHEMIAN

One of the most unique cusuines ive ever had was at Bohemian. I guess its the only place serving fusion food in town. Malpua cheesecake is BRILLIANT. The chef has unique idea's and the food served is actually new. Their pricing is pretty decent as i feel im getting my money's worth. Its a must try for any experimental foodie. 
The only drawback is that since the place is small, you may have to wait for some time but as they say "safar ka fal meetha hota hai'.
Whenever an out of calcutta guest comes, i try to take them to Bohemian for the sheer newness. Bohemian always surprises you. However you must go with an open mind!

Revising my rating after the recent visit, as I am quite disappointed with the service. 
One of the starters we had ordered was a crab dish, to which the server mentioned that they do not have any crab available, and will prepare the item with prawn. But when I received the bill I was surprised to find that I have been charged almost twice the price of the menu. 
What makes it interesting is that the general price of all the Crab dishes are substantially more than the prawn ones, so not sure why such a swap will make it so much more expensive, especially since the restaurant is making up for the unavailability of an item. 
Lastly I would have expected a heads up from the server that the prices will vary while he was taking the order, rather than getting a surprise with the bill. When I mentioned the same to him, his attitude was also very casual.
Still like the food, but these small things leave a bad taste in the mouth.

My first visit after hearing about it from many people. I loved the fusion concept with unique combination food. However my friends who have been before commented that the quality is no longer the same. How I wish I had gone before but will surely visit again to sample more fusion foods.

The restaurant is tucked away in a by-lane near Ballygunge phari. Small cosy atmosphere and with some excellent fusion food. Chef run place with fusion food which remind us another such place in Kolkata - Curry Club.
Most of the menu is fusion of Continental & Bengali cuisine. The fish and seafood dishes really stand out. The portion are good and also price reasonable. This is a place you must not miss in Kolkata. Prior booking is advisable as the place has limited seating.

However one thing I will like to say to the great "chef Joy" that you can think of about some less spicy, less black pepper versions of the foods in menu. I found they are little in higher side in most of the dishes which sometimes kills the natural flavour of the crab/fish/prawns.

Small yet, brilliantly decorated and stylish restaurant. had gone there with friends on a weekend afternoon.

Ambiance: Wooden tables and chairs, Painted bright walls, hippy posters, Bengali writings, A spray pained bathroom and good food. thats Bohemian for you. wonderfully lit, comfortable seating and a great place to catch up with some lick smacking bonghippy fusion food.

Food: Loved the Sex on the beach drink, the Alphonso prawns were great, mutton vindaloo awesome.. along with that malpoa cheese cake, DBC. The presentation just bang on. there were some other dishes as well, the names of which i dont recall, and they were exceptional. 

Quality: The quality of the food served was awesome, cleaned prawns and hot gravy.

Prices : Prices are a bit on the higher side, but you wouldnt complain after having the food there.

New found favorite for me m/

The modern Bengali cuisine!
Ambience: The ambience is clean and bright but a little confused, according to me. You'll find the weird ensemble of classic rock postcards hanging from windows and framed tarot cards from the bright walls complete with a leafy decor on the back wall....much Gothic, eh? But one must make a visit to the tiny washroom which is spray painted in bright colours with excerpts from popular Bengali lyrics!
Service: I love their service. Very prompt and efficient and cordial. I, once, accidentally broke a glass and they let me go scott free...whew!
Food: Brilliant! Kudos to the genius of Joy Banerjee! On my first visit I shivered at the thought of the chicken and pomegranate combo but at the end of it I was salivating for more! The starters are awesome and so are the mains. I confess a bit disappointed with their short selection of desserts though. To be noted, they serve small but filling amount of rice and veggies (kalmi greens) with their mains,  which is kinda nice!
Recommendation: Chicken with pomegranate and mustard sauce and Pork/mutton vindaloo are must tries!

It is not the regular Bengali restaurant in anyway. But that should not mean it is not good. Just that it might shake away certain predispositions about what exactly a Bengali restaurant usually is or should be.
First thing that strikes is the decor. You will like it if you have an open mind for bold colors and Pink Floyd posters. You will absolutely love it if you are young and are used to boutique Italian joints or small steakhouses/brewpubs! Capacity is less (too less in fact) but that should not bother you if you have an reservation which they declare as preferable.
Food is great. Obviously on relative terms! When we went there the responses ranged from excellent/great given by my brother and me (both of us gorge on continental dishes) to "yeah-Ok-Good-Whatever" given by my parents (sticklers for traditional Bengali food)!! So it is really about how open you are about experimenting with the Bengali fare that you know so well. I was open minded and I loved it.
Coming to specifics, I absolutely loved their Cheese Baked Crab with Kolmi Greens. All the mocktails were great. So was the Pan Braised Betki with Aam Ada Sauce.
All in all, I think this is not a place to be put in the same stage as say 'Bhojohori Manna' or '6 Ballygunge Place'. Not because the quality is worse or better in any way but because the offering is quite different.
But it is definitely worth a visit!

Bohemian was a totally new experience for a typical Peter Cat - Oh Calcutta - Beijing - Big Boss bound person like me !
I went to Bohemain with 10 friends and we ordered around 4 different kinds of appetizers and 4 different types of main courses. I must say , every single dish tasted different , very different ! Must appreciate the hard work and the skill the chef puts in !
We started with the following :

Murshidabadi Shashliks
Lemon Chicken on Lemon Skewers
Bacon Wrapped Prawns
Royal Bengal Fish Finger

These were very very well prepared and with a perfect balance of salt and sweet. Special mention goes for the Lemon Chicken on Lemon Skewers. Skewered chicken with a tinge of Gandhoraj flavour, covered with fried spices - fantastic ! !

For main course we ordered the following :

Spicy grilled bhetki with Radhuni curry
Royal Bengal roast mutton with Bhuna Sauce
Steamed Bhetki with mustard
Jumbo prawns stuffed with pickle and cheese

Again , the food was cooked with perfection and had a superb taste.
The Bori Pilaf side and rice could have been a little more in quantity , as, a couple of us went without rice , though , there was still some curry left.
Small suggestion would be to enhance the mocktail  menu; all printed items are generally not available.

I would definitely recommend this place , if you want to taste some exotic spices exploding inside your palate ! A quattro from me.

This is possibly my most favourite restaurant, of all the places I've ever eaten at. I know, this is bordering on hyperbole, but if there's any place which merits hyperbole, it's Bohemian. Devilled mushrooms with chicken, bacon-wrapped prawns, royal Bengal roast mutton, panchphoron flavoured parshe. :) [I could cry for the royal Bengal roast mutton]

Firstly, I am very finicky when it comes to give ratings and rarely dole out 5 stars to any restaurant. So, you can understand the level of satisfaction that I have had in Bohemian which has prompted me to give a 5 star rating to the restaurant.

I am a big foodie and normally make it a point to try out new places for dining. So, the date with Bohemian was fixed up for a 25th December lunch with my wife. First thing that struck me was the wonderfully done tasteful decor of the place. I am a music fan and just loved the idea of having posters of musicians and various lyrics strung on nylon strings with clothing pegs.

Next, the food. It was awesome to say the least. I'll go over it item by item :- 

Vodka Soaked Prawns :- I am not a big prawn lover, but this one simply blew me away with its succulent pieces garnished with a mouth watering sauce.  - 5 Star

Gondhoraj Julep - One of the most refreshing drinks that I have had. Lovely taste. 5 Star again.

Bacon Wrapped Chicken - The taste still lingers in my mouth. Cooked to perfection with delicious gravy and fragrant rice to accompany the juicy pieces. Can I give 6 stars out of 5, pretty please?

Ham Steak - Marvelous. Period. I might sound boring, but 5 Star yet again.

Now comes the exotic dish of all. 

THE Daab Ice Cream - Although, in all probability they do not make it and outsource it from Fresh & Naturelle (which I found out much to my delight), does not take away their innovative culture which made them include this instead of the tried and tested Nalen Gur-er Ice Cream (from F&N again).

I visited them again on 1st January with my extended family and were treated to culinary excellence yet again with the top performers being Shredded Mutton, Kacha Lonka Mangsho, Vodka Soaked Prawns and Chicken Stroganoff which was the best that I have had in kolkata.

Overall, a very innovative fusion restaurant with an excellent chef at its head. 5 Stars totally deserved.

Point to Note :- It is mandatory to book your tables in advance. The seating capacity is just around 30-40 people max and in all probabilities you won't get a seat without prior booking.

It was a very special occasion as it was my dear sister's treat after she got a job. Thank God as Harvey's denied taking our reservation one day before and then never took our call (through Zomato), we decided to venture a new joint and landed in Bohemian. 

Ahhhh what a delight it was. Starting from the ordering it was special. I normally do not rely on our very own localized (so called) continental food, so I ordered a traditional roast chicken. The person taking the order, if I remember well, Mr. Chatterjee, asked me to order something special very politely. We finally ordered for Lemon Chicken on Lemon Skewers, Pork Chops with Cheesy Apple Sauce, Chicken with Pomegranate and Mustard Sauce, Mutton and Baby Onion with green mango and cheese. For the kids we ordered Pasta in Alfredo Sauce. Well, while I say we ordered, it was definitely a combined effort as we mostly go with what Mr. Chatterjee suggested. 

The food came within 15 minutes, which was under any context an extremely quick delivery time. The food was....ahhhhh!!!! I can bet it is definitely one of the best food I tasted in years and I can rate it among the best fusion restaurants I ate around the world. The only complain I have (as a true Bengali I have to complain), is the mutton. I thought it was a bit hard and it would been better to have lamb instead. The Pork Chops were awesome and green and mustard rice served with the mutton were exceptionally well made. 

Before I conclude, I must say something about the "Death by Chocolate". Oh my God! What could be more appropriate than this. At one point of time, it was extremely tough for me to control myself as I was thinking of using my finger instead of the spoon to eat that. 

Ample space for parking makes this place more comfortable. Just a note of caution to all, that booking is absolutely mandatory in this restaurant and if you book just be there on time. We were about to lose our table as we were 10 minutes late. 

The occasion was memorable but Bohemian made it more special. I must say as the owner of this restaurant, Chef Joy Banerjee (Please forgive me if I am wrong) mentioned a quote of Gregory Peck in his menu card that  "98% of the people cannot do what they love to do I come from the rest 2%". After going to Bohemian, I can tell you that 99% people fail to do what they promise so you belong to the rest 1%. It was an awesome experience and I am sure will come back here again.

The menu comes as a shock to you at first! But then once you start trying their dishes out you are likely to get used to it! Strikingly Unconventional! Their Ham steak is very good! so is the tertazini! But the best thing is the Death By Chocolate! I have tried Death By Chocolates at several places and this one is by far THE BEST! 
You can also call up the Chef Joy's Deli, which is the Bohemian's home delivery unit they will deliver too!
However a suggestion they give VERY LITTLE AMOUNT of Death By Chocolate if you are dining in, but if you TELL THEM TO PACK IT/OR YOU GET IT HOME DELIVERED THEY GIVE YOU THRICE AS THE AMOUNT! 
The only Bad thing about this place is that it is highly unpredictable and it had weird timings! But if and when open Bohemian has the right Ambiance(with rock band posters) to go with their menu!! :)

The thing that first caught my eye about Bohemian (Chef Joy's Deli) was their aberrant menu. This place has recently gained popularity because of its unique cuisine. Its a combination of Bengali and continental cuisine. Getting to the dessert was like a journey. Little did we realize the the dessert will be like a miraculous climax to this love making session we had with our taste buds. Cant stop thinking about the Malpua Cheese Cake, delicately flavored, and skillfully made, or the bitter sweet Gandharaaj Souffle.

The visit to bohemian was pleasantly surprising... ordered vodka prawns, gandhoraj vetki, goraj sorbet, porkchop and spiced mango soufle... everything tasted great... also really liked the ambience... also liked the fact that the waiters asked for customer opinion which is so rare to find in kolkata ... the only negative is maybe for hungry non dieting boys like us the quantities are a bit small...

I had been to Bohemian thrice. On two occasions my experiences were good. But, on the third I found the staff and the owner to be rude. I had made reservations two and left behind my number as well. We were about 1/2 hour late. I tried calling informing them that we would be late but could not get through. On arrival we were told that our table was given away and tables are kept for 15 mins. We saw an empty table and requested that we be seated but were told that we would have to wait for 1/2 hour.
Embarrased and refusing to wait we went off to another restuarant. When I called up Joy to inform him about the incident he too was very rude and said that it was the policy to hold on to a table for 15 mins.
It is fine that they gave the table away but when we saw that a table was lying free and they refused to give it to us it is unacceptable!
It is good behaviour that ultimately sells a product. No matter how good and eclectic the food is bad behaviour is a total turn off. I have not been to Bohemian ever since and do not intend to do so either in future.
It is your loss Joy, not mine!!!!

Very interesting venture. Given a great twist to our traditional taste bud. Job done well Joy.

Place is bit cramped. Difficult to get a booking. Prices reasonably high but can be tried once a month.

My selection:
Murshidabadi Shasliks
Vodka soaked Prawn
Corn and Spinach Wraps
Bekti Gondhoraj
Kacha Lanka Mangsho
Bekti with Radhuni
Bacon wrapped Chicken
Grilled Mutton Chops
Mutton Vindaloo

Visit this place folks but make a reservation. Wont advise take out, food's much better when you try it there. Oh I like the pictures on the wall - funky.

I absolutely love the food at this place. Who knew you could get five star food at affordable prices! I always have the jumbo prawns stuffed with garlic pickle, ALWAYS and for around 400-500, it's quite a filling dish. We've also tried the pork chops with apple sauce and the fish with sorshe, but nothing beats the prawns. For started we've pretty much tried everything but the best has to be the bacon wrapped prawns. Starters will take around 250-350. Plus you have to try out the dessert, especially the death by chocolate (approx 200). The only negative point about this place is the fact that you need to pre book it and that you really have to have good luck to get a reservation, but if you can manage, then you must try this place out.

Nice,clean and thoughtful decor punched with a sure to win menu of fusion between continental and bengali cusine, proves chef Joy's calibre. Our favorites are their bacon wrapped prawns,very succulent pork chop with apple cheese sauce and must-have malpua cheese cake. Truely 5 star quality at affordable price

Today was a pleasant afternoon. Had been looking forward to a meal at Bohemian for a week, and happy to say, it was worth it. It's a bit difficult to find this place (Google navigation doesn't help). Sadly, Of course, for 2 (a friend and I), we couldn't taste a variety. But we tasted Steamed breast of chicken in 'radhuni sauce'. It tasted very well with the rice and 'daal-er bori'. The other combo was Royal Bengal mutton in bhuna sauce. It was very tender meat in a well prepared sauce. But for me, it was the dessert that took the cake. Gondhoraaj souffle...!

Overall a very recommendable experience.

P.S. - Sex of the beach vs. Magic potion - SOTB takes the throne.

Went to Bohemian twice!! Last visit was just yesterday!! can say it is one of the best eating joints in Kolkata..! It is very different from the others..very out-of-the-box stuff.. 
Chef Joy seems to be a super artistic person..all his dishes are so innovative and just right on the ingredients..! U can actually make out all the spices put in a dish,which seldom happens in most of the restaurants!! :P 
I had the very famous Joyous Mutton Chops,Vodka Soaked Prawns,Panchphoron Chicken Escallops,Devilled Mushrooms (chicken) for starters. 
Mutton Chops are a MUST-HAVE!! ^__^ It looks really spicy nd full of masala..but wen u cut into dat piece if mutton chop...its HEAVENLY!! It cuts like butter!! And it tastes super awesome!! U can taste all the herbs..spices...a burst of flavour..and yet so light and delicious!! Then came the Vodka Soaked prawns..which was again full of flavour!! A bit on the sweeter side..! The prawns are soft and yummy! A must-try! Chicken Escallops had the panchphoron flavour but it was not very strong! Mildly flavored nd very juicy! :) 
One more super-awesome starter has to be the Devilled Mushrooms with Chicken! Very spicy and full of stuffing! It had mushrooms wrapped with chicken keema with cheese!! Thumbs-up!! 
The main course is again a continuation of the flavorful nd tasty starters..! Chef Joy seems like a perfectionist too! :P
I had Spicy Pork Curry on my first visit! Pork-very soft nd buttery!! Full of flavour! The gravy was also very good with Anglo-Indian spices! They serve it with rice.. Quite sufficient for one person! 
Next visit i ordered for Chicken with radhuni enriched curry!! Woooow!! It was so light nd delicious! And it was served with bori pilaf,which was so different and tasty! For dessert i ordered for panchphoron mousse! Wooow! U should taste this! Mousse wid panchphoron..who would have thought!? :D
All in all..i cannot think of ONE reason to criticize Bohemian!! It is just so perfect!! ^__^

At the outset Bohemian will not impress you too easily from outside located just off the corner from a busy street the Awnings and the huge busy vinyl board will confuse you...Their tag line though a bit corny " where flavours will do cabaret on your senses" will make u wonder whats this place is all about??
As you get closer you see the window with hanging retro Post Cards and bottles of Spices kept in full view of the passerby... Nicely lit interiors and quite cozy wooden floors and just few tables... If you do the mistake of not booking in for the first time visit you will have to wait patiently on most of the evenings...once you get inside its cosy warm and inviting the only thing is the water feature is bit Confusing..:P 
coming to the food bits...
The sorbets are a great way to start their menu...
The aam ada Sorbet or the Mint Coriander sorbet immediately gets your attention they clear the palate and prepare you for whats to come...
The staff is helpful and quick on their feet only a bit lost if there is a huge crowd  but nevertheless always serving food with a smile...
For starters i have explored almost all their options but my favourites are - Lemon Grass chicken, Panch phoron chicken, The crab and definitely the mutton chops , juicy and just rightly cooked....
For the Mains you have wide range of choices and u might end up getting confused  plus its always good to ask whats available.. i like restaurants where things gets finished meaning they shop regularly and the produce is freshly sourced.. So cant complain about it.. There are too many Favourites but Best of them would be the Pork chops, The PAbda rolls, The Prawns with spicy Alphonso cream, The bhetki  and the Kacha Longka Manghsho( mutton) but over all very difficult not like most of them...
The Dessert are a surprise the Spice mango souffle will actually make you think what the hell is this but the little spices explode into your mouth every now and then yes some kind of cabaret after all....
Finally please do explore their Takeaways , brilliantly packed presented and served... only when you would order would you understand.. less said the better...
Overall Bohemian is not so easily for the faint hearted or the typical traditionalist or the ones who are looking for a fast food... Come with time in hand cos each of the dishes needs to be explored with time, both visually and taste wise... But surely enough its something each Kolkatans should be proud off  cos Chef Joy has challenged the good old bengali orthodox dishes and have given it his own unique twist which works most of the time...and you come out feeling a bit zapped...
I love that hope you would too...

This place has recently gained popularity because of its unique cuisine. Its a combination of Bengali and continental cuisine, Id say.

I dont live in Kolkata but whenever I go back I try to eat at new places. I visited Bohemian twice in August. Its a tiny well decorated place. Very few tables, not more than 25 seats. Quite crowded. Its best to make reservations. 

They also deliver at home. They delivered from ballygunge phari to prince anwar shah road. Im not sure about other places. I like how they parcel their meals. 

We were a huge group, we ordered:

Corn and Spinach wraps: lovely combination, deep fried, like wantons! a lil less in stuffing though, but delicious taste.

Bacon wrapped prawns: Large prawns tossed in a sweet-spicy red sauce, wrapped in a thick layer of smoked bacon. One of the best! Must order.

Mint and coriander sorbet: A very refreshing mocktail.


Vodka Soaked Prawns with Grilled Garlic Aioli: Well cooked prawns marinated in a vodka base sauce. Served with a garlicky tartar sauce. absolutely delicious!

Bhetki gondhoraj served on a bed of rice: well marinated slice of bhetki fish cooked in yellow curry. Quite a traditional bengali dish, the gondhoraj lebu adds a lovely flavour to it.

Bacon wrapped chicken supreme bundles with aam kashundi reduction: Oh! Just awesome! Nothing beats this combination of aam and kashundi! Another must order!

Pork chops with cheesy apple sauce: This one however was not too great! Im not sure why they named it apple sauce, nothing very cheesy about this too. Tasted good though like how a usual pork chop slice would in a sauce similar to brown sauce.If one misses this one out while ordering, he wouldn't be missing out on anything really.

Kancha lonka mangsho- Mutton slow cooked in a spicy, kanchalonka curry. Worth ordering.

Gondhoraj Souffle- Their obsession with gondhoraj lebu is not over just as yet! This dessert is a vanilla souffle flavoured with gondhoraj lebu with little slices of leaves within the souffle. One of the most innovative desserts I ve ever had. Tasted lovely. 

Meal for two - 1500!

I want to try their Malpua cheesecake, its hardly ever available.

Overall - Best with awesome company! 9/10

Bohemian is our first choice every time we go out for dinner these days & don't want to go too far. Lovely food at a price that leaves you feeling even more happy. The mocktails are great, loved the gandhraj julep. It was refreshing and aromatic. For starters the crab souffle is highly recommended, delicately flavoured with mustard seeds, it's leaves one wanting more. For main course though I'd prefer to stay away from the lamb & opt for the beckti or pork dishes, although we were disappointed several times to find the pork unavailable. The salads taste good as well. For desert, the death by chocolate is better shared by two people as it is a bit too sweet on the palate but the gondhoraaj souffle is wonderful. 
The only flipside about this place is that it is too small & even if you book a table in advance you may have to wait for more than an hour on a busy evening.

Bohemian has excellent fusion food. Bengali fused with continental dishes. So in case you like both type of cuisines, Bohemian is an ideal restaurant. The menu is filled with varied choices of veggies, mutton, chicken, fish, prawn and pork. So you can take your pick.

My personal recommendation would be the steamed bhetki with pickled chilli and cheese for starters and their mutton vindaloo for the main course. Simply yummy!

And if you come to this restaurant, their sorbet is a must! Their orange and aam aada sorbet is the best.

Also, their service is good too.
And I love the idea of having a glass wall with postcards of rockstars hanging on strings! Really cool.

A must visit if you love food! :D

I was here on a Friday evening looking for a place to relax and unwind a bit with my wife. I wasn't aware of the fact that a table at this restaurant needed to be pre-booked. Weird since most restaurants in Kolkata don't follow that rule and the few that do are way classier than this one. Anyway, the waiter was quite dismissive and did give us a table. There was a group of three ladies sitting at the table next to ours and all through the meal, it seemed like he was a lot more helpful to them than he was to us. I wonder if it had anything to do with the fact that they spoke Bengali and I didn't. The waiter certainly had a very heavy Bengali accent. I came across a word called Gondhoraj (which is a type of lime) and I called him across to explain what kind of lime this is. His first reply is "This is Gondhoraj". I said yes I can read that but can you explain further, so he says it is a kind of lime. I realized I wasn't going to get much more out of him so I gave up. The meal itself wasn't impressive but since I wasn't aware of he kind of cuisine this restaurant served, I won't comment on that. When the plates were cleared, our dear waiter comes up to our table and cheerfully asks if we would like some dessert. I wondered if this was to influence the size of the tip. Anyway, I asked him, what is good here and he says everything is good, so I said, can I have a death by chocolate? He says, we don't have that, so I opted for a Spiced Mango Souffle. Now this restaurant is pricey by Kolkata standards and for that price you definitely don't expect of the souffle to be almost falling over the rim of the glass it is served in. It gave the impression that it was hastily dumped into the glass. Pretty normal souffle. I must say that the place did get full as were leaving but aside from the bad customer service, I don't think the food will make it up enough for me to go there again.

This place is a SPECTACULAR. The chef (Roy Banerjee if I am not mistaken) pours his heart out into each item you order - and it shows. It's a tiny place (be sure to call ahead and make reservations) and the service can be a little slow by normal standards. However, normal time standards also produce normal food quality. This place takes its time. Everything is FRESH - from the toppings on your pizza to the garnish in your mocktail - FRESH FRESH FRESH. I can't wait to go back for their fusion bengali dishes.

They claim to serve fusion food - I say they serve dreams! Simply fantastic and congratulations to their team.

probably the best place in town for fusion food. Bekti  aam ada and the gondhoraj sorbet is out of this world. Only suggestion is in case they can increase the portion of rice served with the dishes big eaters may have a problem

To begin with, if your in a hurry, don't come to this place, this place is for people who enjoy not only food but also the process of it being prepared, and the eager wait for it to arrive, it has a very cozy ambiance, some vintage rock music playing, rock posters, and pictures of some rock classics on clothes pegs at the window,
I love the thought that went behind every little detail of the place....

The starter was good. but the main course is what left me craving,  the casserole, with its velvety gravy, and delicious greens ( most probably kalmi saag), the delicious spiked gravy of the mushrooms. The lamb too was tender as hell, smooth on the bite and beautiful bhuna gravy with with. The gandharaj prawns are pretty much similar to the Bengali classic chingri maali curry , although the gandharaaj flavors did give it a very Thai feel. The meal was not on well cooked, but the plating aesthetically designed.

Work of not only an experienced chef, but one who loves food and respects every ingredient. Good food should talk to you, and the food here did not only talk, but also make me long for every bite coming, when the main course ended, our stomachs were full to the brim, but we still ordered dessert.

  
Getting to the dessert was like a journey. Little did we realize the the dessert will be like a miraculous climax to this love making session we had with our taste buds. Cant stop thinking about the Malpua Cheese Cake, delicately flavored, and skillfully made, or the bitter sweet Gandharaaj Souffle. And not forget, The Gur-a-mel, now that is nothing new, its caramel made with gur (jaggery). And it was topped over a brown custard.

Craftily designed, and beautifully executed. Chef Joy  Banerjee, Kudos!

I have been to Bohemian several times. I have always appreciated Chef Banerjee's dishes with great respect and sometimes in awe. Bohemian is probably one of very few chef owned restaurants in Kolkata. Another soft corner I have for food in Bohemian is the Continental execution with Bengali and Indian ingredients. I would  talk a few dishes and drinks I had at Bohemian during last few months.

Let me start with the Gandharaaj julep. Chef Banerjee's love for this aromatic citrus is well known to anyone who have had his food. This particular drink hits the spot with the abundance of cilantro, the near hypnotic gandharaaj and the ever so flirting kick of green chillies. One observation I would make that, the drink did not taste exactly the same every time I had it. The kick of green chilies was missing on one occasion. 

One of the main dishes that demands a mention is prawn with muddled grapes. It was beautifully balanced with very counter intuitive ingredients.

Garlic and coriander keema wraps was also a delightful surprise. The use of "phuchka" like shells for the keema fillings was great. The idea of substituting the shell of a fired wonton like thing with a phuchka-ish wrap is mind blowing.

As for desserts, the coconut mustard mousse deserves special mention. It is wonderfully balanced... the pungent mustard and the creamy coconut. The mustard shines through the soothing layer of coconut with just the right kick.

Now about a few not so good points. The website of the restaurant needs to change their map. It is so misleading. The map given is Zomato is the correct one. Chef, please change the map.

The presentation of a lot of dish is very monotonous with bits of red, green and red bell peppers strewn around the plate. I am pretty sure one can come up with a little different presentation.

One dish that was disappointing was the salad called porky indulgence. It was just a mixture of ok quality ham, some fankfurter looking sausage, bacon, some greens tossed with mayonnaise. It definitely lacked imagination and seemed very casually done. At least a better quality sausage would be welcome.

In general, I definitely recommend this place, who appreciated honest ingredients, imagination of an experienced chef and flawless French execution.

Can't wait for my next visit.

A fusion of interesting continental dishes sprinkled with flavours of Bengal.. (and the reverse is true too!) 

It became clear from the moment we had seen the menu that we were in for a delightful treat of fusion flavours. Starters were great, the prawns wrapped in bacon is something we would never get tired off. 

Main courses were equally exotic and experimental. The Mutton and Yoghurt Curry had such a unique and delightful taste to it, that I can have it umpteen number of times without getting tired! Royal Bengal mutton, Mutton Chops and chef's special Ham Steak were equally good. 

Remember to save some appetite for the desserts which were awesome with yet unforeseen combinations like cheese cake with malpoan and mousse with slight hint of green coconut! 

Ambiance is nice with walls painted brightly and decorated with some Bohemian flavours like tarot cards etc. Music is decent too. 

It deserves 5 stars for the food, I gave it 4 due the following reasons. You will not get a seat if you do not book before via telephone. Space is limited with just about 8-9 tables. And here it is strictly quality before quantity, and pocket pinch is slightly high.

Perhaps the only deli in Kolkata,  offers some really innovative dishes. Even the conventional stuff on offer is quite good. Pork Chops for the main course and the Gandhoraj Souffle for dessert are my most recommended.

I visited Bohemian for the first time....n I loved just EVERYTHING about it....d FUSION with the FOOD...d ambience....d music being played there...n this can go on and on!Starting with the Gondhoraj Sorbet which was amazingly refreshing  along with Lemon Chicken in Lemon Skewers as a starter was so perfect!When it came to order for the main course,it was really a confusing one as everything in the menu sounded so delicious. But finally I decided to go for Gondhoraj Bekti. When it was served, I was delighted with the way it was put on the plate. For a person like me who is extremely fond of gondhoraj lemon and can eat it with any bengali dish cooked by my mother, this was just the right choice!And as we say...all's well that ends well, the dessert seemed to exceed this idiom as it just the BEST!I was a bit sad when heard that the Spiced Mango Souffle(as suggested the best fusion dessert in Bohemian)was not avalable that day. So went for Malpoa Cheese cake!I guess things can never go wrong in Bohemian!I had the most innovative and "Superhit" (in filmy style!)dessert!It was so good that I really wished it never would finish!Being a foodie, I was satisfied to the optimum level with my lunch and with all my heart votes Bohemian as one of my favourite restaurant! :)

The taste was very unique and good. The drinks were also very nice and refreshing. Only thing missing was a glass of wine. Wonderful experience. Will take all my foodie friends there. Just loved it! Thanks to the Bohemian team!

We had a great time at the Bohemian. Simple ingredients like Radhuni, Gandharaj Lebu, and Ginger are used to make sauces and sorbets that are out of the world. The ambiance is great for both lunch and dinner and the quantity served is good. Every dish at this place is worth a try and we were quite amazed to see such a fusion of typical Bengali ingredients and western concepts like pasta and Chicken Skewers. The food served was fresh and it makes us wonder exactly how well we know our food.

Today went to this unique restaurant, its strange to see that they dont allow guests if they land there suddenly, fortunately i booked a table over phone otherwise we wouldnot been allowed, saw that most of the tables were empty still they were not allowing many guests buy saying that they didnot book early!! its not good for a restaurant!! now come to food,after order you have to wait very long before the food arrives, we ordered mutton chops and fish fingers, they arrived 25 mins later, for main course we had vetki in aamada sauce, vetki in chilli pickle and mutton vindaloo, though all the items were very good in taste but quantity is very small for the price they ask!! for dessert we had gondhoraj souffle and spiced mango souffle both were good, waiters took very long time to remove plates and giving bill.. overall a good experience but not for repeated visits...

The thing that first caught my eye about Bohemian (Chef Joy's Deli) was their aberrant menu. At first I laughed out loud and managed to annoy a few people sitting nearby but the food definitely did not disappoint me after that. The weird combinations on the menu actually made a very nice mix and I soon realised that it's a restaurant where people would just have to go for quality instead of quantity ;)

Wish it was easier for my pocket :)

Its a really small joint,but I remember i had to attempt 3 times before I first got a seat in this restaurant, and going without a table reservation,especially if its during the weekend is quite foolish! The restaurant appealed to me in the very first glance when i saw its window nicely decorated with postcards of our all time favorite bands(and musicians)like The Beatles, Pink floyd, Doors,Queen,Clapton, nicely stringed together! They play nice music, specially if you like the old genre (they were playing a collection of clapton songs the last day I visited the joint). Now coming to its food, I have only one adjective for it, its Breathtakingly good... British rule ended in India nearly 65 years back but thank god they introduced us to the continental cuisine which goes so very well with our taste buds,but being Bengali we also cannot get over our favorite fishes (Pabda, Parshey,Bhetki, Hilsa etc...) and the way our moms and grandmoms cook them for us. They remain to be our Sunday special lunch favorites. Bohemian,my friend,will satisfy the modern Bengali, who loves the traditional bengali cuisine, with a twist of continental zing!!!!! The starters which I have relished in my several visits to this joint are, Joyous Mutton Chops,( a lovely wanton shaped crispy wrap,filled with tender but vibrant in flavors minced meat,served with a heart melting spicy mango chutney[aam kasundi type]).The panchforan flavored chicken escalops were tender, subtle in flavor with a taste like no other of our commonly had bengali starter! Along with it a Gondhoraj shorbot was just a perfect combination, the freshness of the mocktail and the subtle taste of the appetiser plays like hide and seek in your mouth!! Coming to the main course,the chickem/mutton/fish/pork is served with rice usually or tossed veggies or a salad and the portion is quite satisfying for a moderate eater! Can you imagine a grilled fish with a RADHUNI sauce,well, u get it here and its mouth watering,there is a parshey dish which is served with a corriander puree which is slightly smoked and its just amazing!!!! Coming to the poultry, the Bacon wrapped Chicken breast(also known as chicken supreme in many continental restos) takes a completely different turn as it comes with an Aam kasundi reduction, and oh boy, the flavors will make you go head over heels! The mutton with baby onion in a green mango and cheese sauce will  compell you to lick your plates up,excellent flavors and a very balanced fusion of classic cheese and typical Bengali mango flavors! The traditional combos of Gondhoraj Bhetki or Kancha Lonka Mangsho are no less exciting!!! Now finally coming to deserts, What a take by Chef Joy: The gondhoraj Souffle  is a sophisticated desert with flavors which can make this a hatted dish, the souffle is silky smooth and the pulps add a lovely texture to it and even visually it looks so chique! The spiced mango souffle and the creme brulee are also over rich with classical bengali flavors!!!! 
The joint also serves classic pizzas (margherita)sandwiches,pastas, salads and burgers, though I have never tasted them! 
Overall I can say every time I have walked into this joint I have come out with an exhilarating feeling, and every visit makes me want to visit the joint more often!!! If you love gourmet food, you would not want to miss the place, if you love traditional food you would also not want to miss this place, if you love FOOD, you just dont want to miss this joint!!!!

The menu is Old now....a lot has changed.....food has become even better!!!!

Loved the Steamed Betki Chili Pickle and Cheese and the Chili Cheese and Pickle baked crab....yumm. next was the main course of Royal Bengal Mutton Bhuna (Hot), Chef Joys Ham steak (sweetish) and the Bacon Wrapped Chicken Bundles (Mild).the BBQ roasted chicken salad was super too.

The quality of the Mutton to the fresh Bekti and Crabs made the excellent fusion cooking even better.

The Dessert Malpua Cheese Cake was something you should go and taste....its exactly how a cheese cake should be made...not overpowering cheese screaming out at you, that we get at most places.

lovely experience would have to visit soon for the other items on the menu....and I have heard they make scary big pizzas full of toppings to die for!!!

Average food. Surprisingly it has a system where you have to reserve a table or else they will refuse you if you just land up. Extremely poor service. It is noisy. After we finished it took 15 minutes to present the bill and another 10 mins to complete processing of payment. Poor overall experience.

Bengali food served in continental style - that's Bohemian for you. It is unique, experimental & tasty. 
We ordered orange and aam ada sorbet, vodka soaked prawns with grilled garlic aioli, chilli pickle & cheese baked crab with kolmi greens, Hilasa Baked in bori crust, kancha lanka mangsho and gondhoraj souffle. They were awesome!!! 
Never new Bengali food can be made to taste and look so European yet can retain its Bong flavour. It's a MUST TRY.

If you all are food fanatics like me, then Bohemian is the place for you. This heavenly restaurant is owned by Chef Joy Banerjee who has loads of experience as a chef and has proved his expertise at Oh!Calcutta and The Grand Oberoi. 
 
The restaurant boasts of continental food fused with our traditional Bengali delicacies. To be honest, at first it seems weird to imagine the taste of Pabda with a cheese based broth. But, my dear friends, have faith and you will be made to taste perfect food, the likes of which you have never tasted. I was pleasantly surprised to have been served with such a unique yet tasty way of serving Bengali food. All through my childhood years, I have experienced the unparalleled taste of Rui Maach, Bhaat, Mangsor Jhol, Ilish Bhapa, Mug Dal Macher Matha diye, etc. all of which constitutes ''Maayer haather ranna" that a Bengali sona chele can dream of. But when I tasted the pride of Bohemian I was stunned. It was a completely different experience, but it was successful in holding down to its roots, i.e. the bengali cuisine around which the flavours of the continental foods are constructed.
 
The restaurant is located in a small area with a minimal seating arrangement and I guess that is what helps in maintaining such great quality of food. The walls and the glass windows are adorned by the album covers of many legendary bands like Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Guns 'n' Roses, The Doors, etc. which gives a contemporary or European feel to this restaurant even before you place your order. 
 
The things that I ordered were:-
 
1.Chilli Pickle and Cheese baked Crab with Kolmi Greens :- This is a must-have at Bohemian as an appetiser. The dish is a continental way of serving tender crab meat with a balanced taste of chilli pickle, Kolmi saag, coated with flamed cheese. When you take the first bite you will get tastes in 3 different stages. At first,, you get the taste of the awesome cheese, then slowly the chilli takes over and in the end the bitterness of the kolmi leaves hits the throat while accompanying the fresh and tender crab meat. The dish is served in an Earthen Pot which gives a traditional Bengali feel to this awesome signature dish of Chef Joy.
 
2.Vodka Soaked Prawns with Grilled Garlic Aioli :- This is another great dish. I haven't eaten anything like this before. The prawns were perfectly cooked and had the required sweet taste to them. Served with a Tartar sauce this dish is an excellent way to start the Bohemian experience :D.
 
3. Pabda with a cheese based broth:- The thing that impressed me about this dish is that the Pabda fish retained its fresh flavor despite the continental flair that had been added to it. The fish was sauteed well which helped it to maintain the authentic flavour of the fish and this reminded my mom's style of cooking. I have noticed that many Bengali ladies can't cook the Pabda really well. They tend to deep fry it which destroys the sophisticated or delicate flavour of the fish. But I am happy that chef Joy was successful in pulling this off well and when I say that the food reminds me of my mom then you can take it for granted that the food is really awesome.
 
4. Classic Roast Chicken Mushroom sauce :- Now this is a dish that will always have me craving for it once in every week. The Chicken is perfectly roasted and is served with Mushroom sauce, stir fried vegetables, mashed potatoes and tender soft buns. The sauce is very good and complements the dish really well with its soothing and light flavour giving it a required hint of the cheesy flavour that forms its base. Big chunks of mushroom add to the visual appeal of the food and I can assure you the food goes light on the stomach and still it makes you feel satisfied.
 
5. Gondhoraj Souffle and Mustard & Tender Coconut Mousse:- Now, for dessert we had Souffle. A souffle is a lightly baked cake made with egg yolks and beaten egg whites combined with various other ingredients and served as a savory. It is really smooth and consistent throughout just like a custard. The gondhoraj version of souffle is really good and for only those who can stand the bitterness and the strong flavour of the grated lemon zest that is filled in the souffle. The beautiful balance that is maintained between the sweetness and the bitterness of the dish really makes this a worthy dessert. But more than this, I loved the Mustard and Tender Coconut Mousse. It had a souffle-like consistency but the flavor of the coconut was just awesome. After such a hearty meal the pleasent smell of the Coconut mixed with the consistency of the Mousse and a hint of the mustard just made my day. 
 
To be honest I was more than satisfied with the foods that were served at Bohemian. I must say that even my Dad who is an ardent Bengali food lover, especially the Dhakai style was forced to accept that Chef Joy indeed made a great fusion of Bengal and Europe in a way that can make its way to many Bengalis out there in Kolkata starting from Thakumas to Didas, Boudis to Pishis, Maas to Mashis, Babas to Mamas, Bhais to Didis and Bondhus to Bandhobis. This is a place where the traditional "Bangali" ties its knots with the modern "Bong".
 
My Rating:-
 
Taste:- 8.5/10
Ambience:- 8/10
Service:- 7.5/10
Value For Money:- 8/10
 
Take my word for it and make Bohemian your next destination to be visited if you really want to taste some great food.

Having had a raving recommendation from two food lovers, one from Germany and the other French currently living in Kolkata, I checked out your great web-site, read carefully your menu and all the great reviews and your location on your map.

Yesterday I set out with my wife to have a belated Bengali New Years lunch, map in hand.

Long story short;
The map shows your location at the end of the street of Haldirams, which is INCORRECT!  
After speaking to many people on the street we found Old Ballygunge 2nd Lane but not the 1st Lane. 
I then phoned for directions which was a distance away and called again, as suggested, when we reached Bondal Rd.. After driving around, a third call and further driving around with out success. After about an hour our stomaches and frustration dictated that we give up and we went to one of our usual restaurants.
 
I'm planning to check out the correct location first, and then have a belated New Years meal with my wife and hopefully add to your long list of stellar reviews.

In order to submit this post i've had to indicate the number of Stars, so in anticipation I've given you  four stars. Hopefully next time it will be 5! 

PLEASE POST AN ACCURATE MAP!

We were there on this Paila Baisak (Bengali New Years Day, 1419). The place is small (~30 seater) minimally decorated, ambience wise OK (The glass window should have one way view, avoiding stare of passer-by).  Though  the evening  crowd was not full, service was laid back and could have been a bit more friendly for such an eatery. 
But full kudos to the Chef  for the food- it's a harmonious mix of Bengali and Continental fare, and just cannot be compared with the 'fusion' dishes served elsewhere. The only reason you should  visit the restaurant is for the food- appetizer, main course to souffle it all had "Joy"ous signature!

Bohemian has one of the most astonishing menus I have come across in a standalone restaurant in Kolkata. Chef Joy's innovation marries Bengali and continental cuisines to form a palate of unique tastes that linger long after the meal is over.

Ambience: Good. Place is tastefully done. Music can be a bit better considering the scores of Pink Floyd and Doors posters that line the front window!

Food: Superb. Try the Bacon wrapped Chicken Supreme Bundles with Mango Mustard Reduction. Bohemian almost follows the small plate concept and the competitive pricing facilitates trying out a number of dishes and being surprised by them. Try the Gondhoraj Souffle. Its exotic if nothing else.

In a nutshell:
Very unique & really interesting Continental Cuisine inspired by food of Bengal

Short Description - In case u r in a hurry:

In case u have been to the link above, u wud have figured out that Chef Joy, the owner, Chief Chef & conceptualizer of the restaurant calls it - contemporary Bengali cuisine & I have called it continental cuisine inspired by Bengal. Read more about this debate & about Chef Joy's interaction with us in the detailed description.

If we keep aside the birth credentials of this food, it is good food & appeals to the taste buds & worth a second, third & so on....visit.

The Chilli pickle & cheese baked crab with Kolmi greens was mind-blowing - one of the best oriental flavors of crab I have ever had, mutton & cherry tomato skewers was a superb concept - slightly suboptimal in execution, stir fried prawns with muddled grapes was awesome, Pork Vindaloo & Royal Bengal mutton with bhuna sauce & mashed potatoes was good. The desserts were out of the world - Gondhoraj souffle, Spiced mango souffle & Mustard & tender coconut mousse.

........... a must try

Detailed Description - In case u have the time to enjoy readin:


.... A little touching back on the issue of the origin of the food - My thought: If someone wears a black dress with white flowers on it, I call it a black dress with specs of white. If I am having an ice cream with 'Nolen gur' flavor, I wud call it continental, If I am having a galawati kabab topped with caviar, I wud call it Indian & so on......... anyway, this debate is not important coz the food is super cool.

The Chilli pickle & cheese baked crab with Kolmi greens was a mix of crabmeat & kolmi saag (a green leaf stir fried & eaten in Bengal) and a very interesting & tasty Chilli pickle. This mix was then topped with cheese, placed inside an empty crab shell & then baked................ Awesome, brilliant, excellent, mindblowing...... I can eat it every day & still not get bored for 40 years!!!!

Mutton & cherry tomato skewers was a very very good concept - the mutton pieces suffered from a glitch in execution (I guess that was more of an accident) - it had slightly less than optimal salt - not expected from such a fascinating Restaurant though. The spices in the mutton pieces were not overbearing but were making their presence felt.

Conceptually the tomato (being intrinsically sour) could also have a bit of extra salt (maybe inside) to match up with the salt level of the meat - though its even ok just left as it is.

The Stir fried prawns with muddled grapes & chillies were served with a bowl of dry wilted greens (saag) & rice. The Prawn was very soft & the gravy was mild, creamy & really different. The muddled grapes added a new dimension. Though the name mentioned Chillies, the dish was not 'hot' by any standards. The chillies added a good feel to the dish.

Royal Bengal mutton with bhuna sauce was Sliced Mutton layers, served with mashed potatoes & a new innovative 'bhuna' sauce on top. Very different from anything Bengali I have ever had but very enjoyable. A word of caution is that this is prepared in continental style - so the mutton will not be melt in the mouth like we have in some of our Bengali delicacies & Nawabi biryanis.

The freshly cut & steamed vegetables accompanying the dish r just unadulterated freshly cut & steamed vegetables - u can just forget it in case u r not interested in bland steamed veggies. U will not miss anything.

A tip for the Royal Bengal mutton - U will enjoy this dish much more if u think u r having a continental dish. U might feel uneasy if u think u r eatin Bengali food.

Pork Vindaloo (Kolkata style) was one of the best Vindaloo gravies I had in a long while, The meat was slightly tough in texture if u compare to indian food but will b considered ok if compared to meats in continental food. The pork did not taste any different though & was like any other tasty red meat.

Bongs & their sweet tooth - Gondhoraj souffle was a fine creamy rich souffle with a flavor of Gondhoraj (a kind of aromatic lemon grown in this part of the country). U cud see & taste the tiny specs of Gondhoraj in the souffle. Excellent......

Spiced mango souffle - remined of a spiced raw aam (mango) sweet chutney in the core , incorporated in a souffle - new & wonderful.

Mustard & tender coconut mousse - Very unique, the green coconut flavor was not obvious but does not really matter, the mustard was visible & gave a mildly grainy texture. The taste was ....... Ooooh I wanna have it again.

Post the lunch The Chef walked up to our table for feedback & we invited him to join us on our table. We had a great memorable nice adda (chat) on food & other things Bengali.................. look forward to revisiting the place on my next visit to Kolkata to try out the numerous more curious food listed on the menu.
