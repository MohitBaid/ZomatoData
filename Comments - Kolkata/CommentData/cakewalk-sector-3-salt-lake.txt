hmmm what to say .. i have lost my sweet tooth long time back but still i find the cupcakes and cookies covered with dark chocolate very tempting and always end up eating them..  for the simple reason its not sweet but tastes like real dark chocolate...
Ooh forgot to mention chocolate is knows as soul food...  so eat till our soul allow :)
best of luck and good health to all...
