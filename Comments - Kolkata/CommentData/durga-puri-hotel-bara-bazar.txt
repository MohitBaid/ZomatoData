Service was good but tandoori roti needs some improvement
Chana masala was good but dal was average
Overall service and food are value for money

Place was not so good looking but proper sitting arrangement. Very friendly hospitality and good ambitious by owner and staffs. Service was quick and behavior was also good. They serve here pure dhaba cuisine full of spices and very delicious food. Pure north indian dhaba like desi tadka cuisine in pocket friendly price. Must try place in both seasons. Personal favorite for desi cuisine. Highly recommended to all.
