a most pretentious place run by a snooty owner with no sense of propriety.the cake delivered to us was almost raw, extremely chewy, and tasted like stale paper.a birthday party which should have had a delicious cake was instead marked by inedible morsels which no one wanted to touch.I would not recommend this place to anyone. an absolute disaster!
