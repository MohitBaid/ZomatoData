Foods I tried there mainly are : Mutton Biriyani, Kashmiri Polau, Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Bharta, Hundy Mutton,¬† Chicken Tom Yam Soup in several visit and they are good. Service is little slow but bearable enough. Nice ambience. Communication is good from major part of the city as this is situated at Nerkel Bagan crossing. Pocket friendly !!!

I have no idea why this place has such low rating. I have been a number of times and always the experience has been good. They have Indian, Chinese as well as Bengali cuisines on their menu and I have tried all of them. From each of the cuisines I liked their Mutton Biryani, Tandoori Chicken, Chinese Chopsuey and Chicken Dakbunglow. They service is prompt and tgr staff is very courteous.

Nothing great about it. Moderate food with mediocre taste.. price normal usual. So so ambience. There is no spark at all to mention specifically.
For Rajarhat surrounding IT cloud it is ok to pay one visit.

I would not recommend this place to anyone. It‚Äôs a new restaurant but as per expectations its food is not at all good. The ambiance is not good too. This needs to work on its food quality and ambiance too.

Location : Narkelbagan crossing, Newtown

Ambience: Nothing extravaganza but not dim either.

Food and drinks : If you are thinking of going here, DON'T. If you're thinking of bookmarking this, DON'T.
The service is very slow, the food served is cold. The waiters will argue with u if I say the cold drinks served is not cold and just sugar water. 
Nothing in this restaurant make sense.

Pocket Pinch : As compared to the food and service, they charge a hell lot.

The place is located near rabindra tirtha, narkelbagan crossing. Food is okay. It was surprising that they did not had biriyani ready that also at proper lunch time.  Ch Tikka kabab nam n nawabi pulao tasted well.

Location wise, this restaurant is located at a prime location. It's just beside the Narkelbagan more. I've ordered pan fried fish, egg fried rice and chilli chicken. Pan fried fish was really very tasty, however some may not like this as they prepare it by rahu fish not basa. So the taste is bit different. Egg fried rice was average and the chilli chicken was horrible. Road side shops in kolkata serves better chilli chicken.

Very poor service / delivery. Air conditioning is very poor. Kebabs are good and food tastes average. Too much of noise and chatter all around as they have squeezed the sitting place and other parts are restricted.

I take back my previous comment. There have been subsequent issues when I had a red face when their extremely smart delivery people searched for my place 5-6 kms away from my residence. My guests almost left starving but their impeccable delivery guys kept searching my place in Action Area 2 instead of AA-1  where I stay. And yes, they did it twice. I have shunned taking delivery the 2nd time as my guests already left. Such a shame..!


Bang on Newtown Expressway, on left side while travelling towards Narkelbagan, you find Mehman. It is the closest standard home delivery restaurant from my new residence near Balaka Abasan.

We ordered home delivery twice from here and both times, we got good food at acceptable price. They typically delivered within 30-45 mins at minimum delivery charge. We prefered Chinese here more and we're blessed with our decision. Their mixed friedrice is pretty good.

Food quality- 4.5/5
Price- 5/5
Service- 4.5/5.

Boon for Newtownites like us.. !!!

Horrible Food Total lost of money and time. I spoiled the dinner and huge money in this worst food outlet. Food quality is just the Worst in Kolkata...  Staffs are not from the industry and standard of food is just soooooo bad. Rotten chicken and rice.  I will complain the Food checking Department to immediately intervene this place

This place would give you a deserted feel by being at Narkelbagan crossing. It is equally empty inside. We were the only one at about 9 PM.

And with 3 -4 group it gives you boisterous feel.

Service is horrible. First they don't know what's available and what's not and what's the point of having a menu if most of cuisines are not available.

We ordered chicken biryani and it was not available. Mutton biryani, they said it is on but after 20mins. They mentioned that only 2 is possible. And we were forced to again browse through those pages where most of things are not there.

TELL ME, Where in Kolkata would a restaurant say that Biryani is not available that too when we are the first customers.

We had fresh lime sold - salt and it was no better than sea water. You take a sip and you throw twice the amount outside. Thankfully, they replaced with something acceptable.

They need major improvement in all aspects.

Few days back visited this restaurant. Ambience is good, staff are also friendly. I would like to mention that, I asked them to you serve normal water but the water was not clean and clear. They changed the glass and bottles thrice but every time I found some particle in the water. Finally I ordered mineral water. I ordered manchow and american chopsuey. Food was good and quantity is also ok. I personally  think the menu card is not at all organised.  I will try once again to test the Indian dishes. If you want to spend some time then I would suggest you to check out this place.

One of the best place to eat in New Town. There are four chefs and all of them cook well. For me the best dish is chicken tandoori. Nice staff and it's a great feeling to sit near the window and enjoy your food watching the new town highway at night. Must visit.
