If you are a sweet lover this is a must try. You wouldn’t find fusions like in Balaram Mullick but here you will get the true taste of bengali sweet delicacies. This place is near to my house. I am very frequent to this shop. But believe me they have never disappointed me. Each and every type of sweet is very well prepared.

The sweets here tastes so good. My favourite among them are mishti doi and chocolate talsash. Everytime I go to kankurgachi for some work, I surely stop by ghosh brothers to taste their incredible mishtis and sandeshes.

Kolkata is known for their sweets and reasons are shops like these. Any item can be picked and will surely melt in our mouth. Best are jalbhara items, Misti doi , sandesh are other great items available.

Gosh brothers is a sweet confectionary located at Kankurgachi.

Clean ambience.

Service is good.

Tried Taalsas sondesh & Gulab Jamun. Both were fresh and of good quality.

Pocket pinch is reasonable too.

A nice sweet shop in kakurgachi area. Quality of sweets are good and taste also delicious. Sandesh and gulab jamun are too good. Place is clean and hygienic. Pocket pinch is reasonable.

If you are a bong , perhaps you cannot go without sweets and savoury which this place is famous for.

The family has two signature sweet shops, one bang on 2 minutes walking from Kankurgachi Xing while the other is on the road leading from Kankurgachi towards Bengal Chemical artery road.

The most fascinating thing about Ghosh Brothers is that they have carefully evolved to the genX taste bud keeping in tune with the traditional offerring like " Nalen Gurer Sandesh".

Some of their signature wet seeets are the " Rajbhog,Chum cham,Roshomalai,Chocolate sandesh".

I have been visiting them for the past 7 years and never had a personal issue with their hygiene. 

A must visit for all sweet lovers.

Let's get it straight. Ghosh Brothers is one of the most underrated sweet shop in Kolkata. They sell almost same quality products compared as of to the big names. The talsash, the aam sandesh are to die for. I recommend this place for all sandesh lovers.

One fine day I went to this shop for buying some  sweets for puja at my home. That day onwards I have been a regular visitor to this shop. All the family members of mine like to have a sweet bite from Ghosh Brothers daily.  The staffs are cordial and help you try their innovations with each season. However, in rush hour one can't expect such communication with the staffs. The shop is small,  maintenance is low with few staffs offers every bit of fantasies of old and new world of bengali mishti. The must try are baked kachagolla, baked mihidana, baked chomchom, mango kalakand, chocolate sandesh including all the nolen gur items. All items will fit into your budget.Afterall, when it comes to Ghosh brothers visit the place and ask for some according to your choice and they will surprise you with their innovations.

The ratings here does not show the real picture. The best sweet shop in kankugachi gives us a lots of variety and really lots of variety. Though very small its tidy and serves grt gur and chocolate mishtis a participant of 'cadbury misti shera sriti' is my go to destination every day.Special recomendation are rasogolla,misti doi,butterscotch sandesh and all chocolate sandesh. The jolbhora's are a bit let down and never try their samosa they are the worst nightmare of a samosa lover.

I am a regular visitor of this place since my home is not far away. Have been here numerous times this winter. As usual, bought their nolen gurer sandesh as well as their chocolate sandesh. Both were really very nice. It is quite remarkable that their prices are not high, rather somewhat lower than similar mishti shops. Priced @ Rs. 15, the size of 1 gurer sandesh was as good as two. Not to mention the high quality as well as the taste!
Wanted to rate this place far better, but not doing so due to the very high waiting time! Had to literally fight for my turn, as scores of customers keep walking into this place to satisfy their winter mishti cravings. Had to struggle for some 15-20 minutes to procure 6 pieces of mishti as only 2 people were attending customers, packing and even maintaining cash.
Management should sincerely introduce more staff!
Place is small with no seating arrangements (which is perfectly ok) and hygiene is nice. They have also installed CCTV cameras!
Cheers!

This shop is one of the most famous sweet stations of Kankurgachi, probably one of the oldest too. It is located near Kankurgachi Moore.
The shop is cramped alike most of the sweet shops in and around Kolkata. However, it is very tidy.
They offer a variety of chocolate sandesh and they really taste good. Generally, the stuffs between the price range of Rs10-Rs8 taste good. There roshogollas are soft, sugary and tasteful. However, I don't like their laddus and soamosas.
