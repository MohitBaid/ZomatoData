The worst bar cum restaurant ever visited.Beleive me its not a fake review or other.Very very poor customer service ,poor availability of foods and drinks pathetic ambiance. If you want to spent good time go other places instead this dont throw your money.

I went yesterday with my family, very pocket friendly restaurant. A good place for boozing your partner or friends, specially for ladies. Decorations was not so high, ambience ok. But food is mind blowing, each n every food is delicious. We ordered sweet n sour chicken soup, crispy chicken, chicken resmi kabab and fried chicken with chilled bear. Then we ordered mixed fried rice, mixed noodles with sechzwan chicken and Manchurian chicken. I think little bit of spice should be added in sechzwan chicken, otherwise every preparation was amazing.
Everyone should go there for a new try in a limited budget.

I went to this place with my one friend at Nabami, Durga puja. This retro located near the Madhyamgram Chawmatha, Barasat. The experience was so so and food quality was not hi fy. We ordered two Heineken beers and Chicken pakora. Ambitious was ordinary. Service was not better according to our expectation.

Well First of all this restaurant is not located in Barasat. Its in Madhyamgram and Located in the middle of Chowmatha( Madhyamgram) and Rubber factory(Madhyamgram).
Now Coming to the Ambience, well,the place is Quite dark and I will rate 3 out of 5 in this matter.
Now Looking At The Food Quality, they are quite good nd not the best. I will Always recommend to Try out Chinese Dishes . 
The Only Thing which They Lack Over Here is that the quantity of the Gravy of any side Dish they provide is very less.. 
I will Definately Recommend you to visit this place.
Quick ratings out of 5.
1) Ambience :- 3 
2) Locality  :- 4 ( If u are planing to visit During Day Time and before 8 pm ).
3) Food :- 4 
4) Staff members :- 4

1. Ambiance is not at all very pleasant even at the family bar cum restaurant zone.
2. I have visited a couple of time here but never have seen that Johnnie Walker is available.
3. Cheap food quality if I balance it with the price.
4. Waiters are not much energetic. I would rather say; they are a bit robotic.
5. Poor as far as the location is concern. Nearest bus or taxi stand is over 500 meter & the entire way is unsafe; specially for female.

Being a bar cum restaurant this place is basically meant for bar & not restaurant, this should be the last option if u dont get any food/seat in madhyamgram area. For drinking the place is okay.

Visited here only once due to lack of option on a festive day. It is safe to say before I review any further that I won't be going back again. Shabby entrance, poor lighting, extremely haphazard and uncomfortable seating arrangements will greet you first. Beyond that is loud, distasteful music, horrible food and dirt cheap booze! (No idea how the family section is in comparison). Food quality is beyond disappointing - you might as well just grab something from roadside vendors than try anything here. No ambience or aesthetics, and extremely lousy service. To sum it up, even if you want to get drunk with a very minor pocket pinch, visit at your own risk.
