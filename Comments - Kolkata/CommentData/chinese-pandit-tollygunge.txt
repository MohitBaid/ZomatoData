the food is very tasty the prawn rice and crispy Chilli babycorn but there were only 7 pieces of prawn in their eyes and even after mentioning not to make spicy the baby corn they still made it spicy and it was for a kid so I had to wash it with otou overall it was a good experience

Available on little deals. The purchase shows 50% discount but in reality the prices are almost same on MRP only. So don't get deceived as me. 😒
Food quality was okay to good. Nothing extravagant.Just a little above the roadside eateries.Special mention they gave lots of chicken pieces in the chowmein and fried rice both. Thumbs up.Takeaway/ delivery joint. Not a dine in one.Chicken Manchurian was good. Recommended.
Taste wise quantity wise and price wise okay. So you can try it for change. 
If you are a Chinese food lover or maniac you have already wasted time in reading this review as not there much for you here. Many awesome places for your tummy .

Ordered online for the first time. Ordered schezwan chicken and a snack item - chicken fahley. Good food, nice packaging and delivery before time..Chicken fahley deserves special mention.. it tasted  great...though it's oiliness should be reduced (oil was dripping from entire package)...Considering its affordable price and such good quality...its a hit quick bite.

I ordered pan fried chilli chicken and mentioned it to make less spicy, but it was horribly so spicy that we could not have it. It was a wastage of both money and food. But fried rice was ok but garlic chicken was too much sweet. Its a wierd combination.

The first time I ordered from here, my experience was not bad. Had ordered chicken steam Momo, spicy fried chicken and noodles. Keeping the price in mind, I was taken aback by the quality n quantity. Taste was amazing too. So I decided to order again a few weeks later. But this time I was shocked to see the drastic change in the quality of the food. Chilli garlic noodles was fine but I also ordered chicken manchurian boneless, half plate. To my horror, when I was about gorge on the chicken, I realised that it was not a boneless piece. Each and piece had bones. Even though the gravy was tasty but a tad bit high on sweet, but the chicken pieces were just not up to the mark. I guess will never order from here anymore.

A swiggy delivery yet again. The food from this outlet is like those typical road side eateries we find on the streets of Calcutta. Nothing spectacular about the food. I couldn't basically differentiate between the various types of noodles I had ordered, all the varieties looked the same to me. Quantity is sufficient to fill an empty stomach provided you are willing to compromise on the quality of the food being served.

I dont know why the rating is so poor thank god i deciced to check it myself. They are really good. I ordered combo fried rice and chilly chicken they provided 4 pieces of chicken and i was pretty shocked. The taste was also too good. Ordered extra plate of egg fried rice. It came with a omlet on top irrespective of the rice tossed in scrambled eggs. 
The quality and quantity both were upto the mark. Reallly impressed. 
P.s the food rate is also cheap.
Loved the food and experience.

Ordered for Two Veg Noodles & Chicken Manchurian Combo along with one Chicken Momo Plate containg 6pcs momo and a Thumpsup bottle. The quality and quantity of all the above prepared foods are Good but not the Excellent. And whereas at this price range some restaurant has a slightly better quality and quantity for the Combo.  But still this was good enough at this price tag. Chicken Momo was also Fine but the Soup could have been better. Regarding the taste of the Food, improvement is required though this does not require additional cost and depending mainly on the Cook's capability only. The taste was Just Okay for me. Being a Foodie, I feel that in order to have frequent order we do look for all three - Price, Quality & Taste. Chinese Pandit have two out the three, taste needs improvement but without hampering the other two. Please pay attention to bring out the Taste but not breaking the Price and Quantity or Quality etc.

The restaurant is the best price to quality ratio food stop. You need the value of money that leave your pocket and better the ratio the better the food. Ranging from fried rice and preparing them with extra special preferences is what I got from them. That's why my Chinese food favourite is Chinese Pandit.

13/08/2017: I ordered 2 half plate veg schezwan fried rice, one egg fried rice, 1 full plate chicken Manchurian and one plate chilli mushroom. The delivered rice had glass pieces in it. Was actually disappointed. But I made the mistake when I thought of giving them a second chance by ordering again on 14/08/2017. My last order from Chinese pandit was an incomplete one delivered to me. I ordered for a half plate veg schezwan rice along with full plate chicken Manchurian. Bt to my surprise instead of full plate chicken side dish I received half plate and when I called them back to let them know about the mistake they didn't even cared to receive my call whereas I paid the full amount coz I didn't had the option to check my meal infront of the delivery executive and then pay the bill. Please for the sake of urself folks never ever order food from this restaurant. P.S All my ordered items were for home delivery.

I gave 1 rating because there's no option to rate 0 or in negative. I ordered a Chicken Thupka and Chicken Momo through Zomato online. After waiting for almost an hour I got a call from the delivery executive who apparently had no idea about my location. I waited for another 20 mins after which the food was delivered. I have had bad experiences with food ordered from Zomato but I never faced something like this. The worst momos that you can possibly get in Kolkata. 90% of the thupka was basically cornflour. I guess these people have no idea about Thupkas or any food item in general. Inspite of charging me for packaging the food, the soup and momos came in plastic pouches. Yes, you read that right, hot food in plastic pouches. Please NEVER order food from this place if you value your money or health.

The restaurant is the best price to quality ratio food stop. You need the value of money that leave your pocket and better the ratio the better the food. Ranging from fried rice and preparing them with extra special preferences is what I got from them. That's why my Chinese food favourite is Chinese Pandit.

13/08/2017: I ordered 2 half plate veg schezwan fried rice, one egg fried rice, 1 full plate chicken Manchurian and one plate chilli mushroom. The delivered rice had glass pieces in it. Was actually disappointed. But I made the mistake when I thought of giving them a second chance by ordering again on 14/08/2017. My last order from Chinese pandit was an incomplete one delivered to me. I ordered for a half plate veg schezwan rice along with full plate chicken Manchurian. Bt to my surprise instead of full plate chicken side dish I received half plate and when I called them back to let them know about the mistake they didn't even cared to receive my call whereas I paid the full amount coz I didn't had the option to check my meal infront of the delivery executive and then pay the bill. Please for the sake of urself folks never ever order food from this restaurant. P.S All my ordered items were for home delivery.

I gave 1 rating because there's no option to rate 0 or in negative. I ordered a Chicken Thupka and Chicken Momo through Zomato online. After waiting for almost an hour I got a call from the delivery executive who apparently had no idea about my location. I waited for another 20 mins after which the food was delivered. I have had bad experiences with food ordered from Zomato but I never faced something like this. The worst momos that you can possibly get in Kolkata. 90% of the thupka was basically cornflour. I guess these people have no idea about Thupkas or any food item in general. Inspite of charging me for packaging the food, the soup and momos came in plastic pouches. Yes, you read that right, hot food in plastic pouches. Please NEVER order food from this place if you value your money or health.

Had a combo and momo burger.  1st off all I want to say I was ignoring the restaurant by seeing the reviews and the current reviews showed which were recently given by the consumer was not good and I thought of ignoring it.  But when my roomier ordered today..  I would like to say...  Jst don't go on reviews
Combos were sufficient for me as I am an avg eater and the size of bone chicken were good...  They tasted well and the burger one I think the obvious copy of wow momo,  but the that I didn't get how they maintained almost the same taste of wow momo and that too at a cheaper price...  From my side it's a must go outlet..  I Jst heard 1 demerit they don't have place  to seat so given 0.5 less other wise for food 4. That was detailed review by my side

Tried this restaurant a fortnight back, got a combo offer home delivered. So here I am only going to comment on the food and service. The order was placed at around 9:30-ish with a 45min delivery timeslot. I received my order @11:15-ish a whopping 1hr delay to the actual promised timeline. And now the most important part, the food. The chicken in chicken noodles had huge pieces of boiled chicken which wasn't exactly what u call good food. The chilly chicken was fair and not bad.
However with a place like Kolkata which is teeming with Chinese restaurants and wonderful eateries at that I don't think this place is cut out for it. I won't be ordering from them and I would recommend that you don't either. Give them a miss and you evade a bad dining experience.

Never ever order any combo meals. Other items are over priced for the quality they provide. Combo meals are worst, drips with low grade oil, undercooked, or food has already started going stale so covered up with lots of spices and oil. Order anything other than combo meals or find a better resturant.

A small takeaway outlet located at azadgarh post-office with unique creative name and a mouth watering menu with authentic Chinese taste. I ordered chilly chicken and it was above expectations. Quantity and quality both was above par but they don't have proper sitting arrangement. They make our food delivered at our doorstep. Service was fast.

Good food.
Reasonable pricing.
Located at Azadgarh more.
I visited once with two of my local friends.It was their suggestion to give this outlet a try.Well,i am satisfied.
Tried egg chicken noodles,and 2pcs of chicken momos.The foods were good,though the noodles were a bit oily.Momos had the right fillings.Pocket Pinch is minimum and reasonable.
No idea about home delivery service.

One of the worst food outlets in terms of delivery and customer service. Ordered food at 9:39pm. Expected delivery time was 11:01pm. Even at 12:03am, which is right now as I am writing this, food wasn't delivered. The delivery guy called up once, half an hour ago to let me know that his vehicle broke down and it would take him some more time. I agreed.. now it's nearly 40 minutes after that. No sign of them, no communication at all. I had to cancel my order. Fortunately, it was a COD order.
Service on Zomato's part was good. They followed up on the incident and assured me that the matter would be escalated to higher management.
My recommendation for people: Avoid This Food Outlet. Go through some of the other reviews too related to their delivery time management, whether online or on spot.

The food is undoubtedly very good and their price is extremely reasonable. The quantity of the food is not compromised for that. The only down side was their extremely slow delivery, they took more than an hour to deliver to my home which is barely 5 minutes from their place. They are relatively new and if they can maintain this quality and quantity, they will surely be doing wonders in future ! I will definitely recommend this to my friends and try out the other items myself.

It's a fairly small and new outlet not very far from home so I decided to give it a shot and honestly, I was quite impressed. The food was cooked well and tasted good. The home delivery was speedy and within estimated time and it's also easy on the pockets. The schezwan noodles had a smoky flavour (which thankfully wasn't burned) and the rice was simple and well prepared. Chicken cooked in hot garlic sauce wasn't very spicy so it went well with the rice. Overall, this place is Definitely worth a shot.
