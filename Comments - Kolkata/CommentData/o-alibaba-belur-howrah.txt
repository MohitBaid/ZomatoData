Accepts home delivery from zomato 
First in our locality.. 
Normally a takeaway restaurant, doesn't have any seating capacity other than seating in an umbrella table. 
Well the food is average... 
They make good rolls 
And Biriyani is not so much oily and its lite

Though the address shows it is in belur but it is actually at uttarpara. Quality wise it is good. I have one objection the Biriyani they serve is too oily and they use dalda to prepare it. Kababs are not fresh. It seems that they keep the leftover kababs and sell it on the next day as well. Rolls are better options to have here.

One of the best budget restaurant in Bally - Uttarpara area. Situated opposite to uttarpara college bus stop. Tasted chicken biryani, mutton biryani, egg roll, chicken roll etc. Visited several times. Food quality is good. But not spacious and sitting arrangement is not good. But still visit again to have good quality food in budget price ðŸ˜ŒðŸ˜€
