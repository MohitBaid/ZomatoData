If you want to have some amazing pizza at affordable prices then this place should top your list!
Wanted to try out their pizza for a long time and finally did today.
Ambience-- basic. Like any other pizza outlet.
Order- we ordered two coffees, a medium cheesy chicken pizza, and a triple chocolate sweetzza. However we got a spicy cheese garlic bread free with the medium pizza!! How cool is that!
Food-- the pizza was amazing. Right from the crust to the taste and toppings, everything was top notch. I absolutely loved it! The garlic bread was also very good. And the sweetzza came as a sweet surprise. I am generally wary of sweet pizzas but this one was everything it should be. Balanced sweetness with a great base.
Pocket pinch-- 640. Very affordable according to the food they serve, I feel.
Overall-- Pizza being my soul food, I will definitely visit again because they are one of the best I felt!

We were thinking of visiting this place for the last 2 years. Had some great reviews from friends and families. Atlast we got the opportunity, indeed it is a great place for pizza lover...
We ordered:
‚óè cheese onion chilli garlic bread: garlic breads r itself tasty so as cheese, altogether it was a great combination.. very well cooked..
‚óèchicken mexicana: the pizza was loaded with chicken,cheese and sauce a bit spicy as mentioned in the menu.. tastes so good. I have never tasted so soft pizza crusts..
‚óè garlic prawn: never had prawn with pizza earlier.. the combination of prawn and pizza is so good, that it can't be any better.. the prawn,the cheese, the sauce all were so well cooked and all were in perfect quantity. All over it is a great for pizza nd prawn lovers.
‚óè exotic flavoured mojito(green apple)

everything tastes great. The pizza crusts are soft beyond imagination.
P.s. if u are a student, dnt forget to carry your college identity card, u get 25% discount on the bill..

This small joint, located near Ruby Hospital, serves pizza that is worth trying. Far better than what you get in Domino's or anywhere else. The decor is nothing too fancy. Can accommodate a crowd. Service is average, staff are well-spoken. 
Now coming to the food! 
1) Peri-peri chicken scroll - It was so good! The right hint of spicy and that cheese burst. The crust was on point. (Rating - 4.0)
2) Garlic prawn pizza - Yes, you heard it right. Prawn in pizza. You won't regret it I promise. The garlic-y prawn and the freshness of the squeezed lime on top. Highly recommended! (Rating - 5.0) 
3) BBQ chicken pizza - The topping was ample. Chicken pieces were well-flavored. Taste was good. (Rating - 4.0)
4) Triple chocolate sweetzza - Never thought chocolate pizza would be this good! The crispy pizza crust and the oozing chocolate sauce with the crunchy choco-chips was bliss. Absolutely loved it! Try it. (Rating - 5.0)
5) Fountain coke. 
In addition to such tasty and filling meal, they gave a 101/- off on our total bill. Cherry on top much? In fact, they have an offer on everyday basis. No added taxes charged. What more do you need? Go get your pizza!

A 10 minutes walk from Ruby, Eagle boys' pizza is basically an Australian pizza joint. It offers a variety of chicken and veg pizzas. They have amazing affordable combos as well. A combo for 2 veg and 2 non veg pizzas comes at Rs 380 (*WOW*). although it contains liquid cheese in place of mozzarella, there's no compromise on the taste.

Well this is walkable from my house. Went there and had home delivered too. They make really good pizzas. If you got bored of pizza hut and dominoes then this is really going to revive your buds for pozza again and not to forget the price which is reasonable.

Visited this place today...Being the 1st day of 2018,wanted to have pizza for a great beginning to the New Year....Location is wasily traceable as it lies close to the main road at the side and is easily visible from a distance.Ambience is good.Had the Auusies Favourite Pizza...it was a disappointment....Pineapple on the Pizza was not even grilled...270 bucks...Pizza hardly reached the top of the Pan......Chef's recommendation Chicken Pizza was good but too much cheese.....non veg toppings mushrooms etc was limited can improve considering it costs 590...the cheese crust on the edges were good.....Sweetzaa is great considering it is 150....And I got a complimentary Brownie today which was a pacifier to the food...Overall having had pizzas allover the place...Taste is very much influenced by Dominos' I can say Pizzas here are good but can improve.

The 'Eagle Boys Pizza' is one of the hidden gems in the City of Joy. They serves different varieties of pizzas and other items. This place was in my bucket list for a long time. But, finally yesterday I got a chance to try out their items. Though I opted for home delivery through Zomato. Their service is quite satisfactory. I ordered for a Chicken Keema Pizza. And for dessert, Tripple Chocolate Sweetza. Chicken Keema is a popular dish in India. So keeping the taste of it in a pizza is really a tough job. It was absolutely amazing. I loved the cheese crust with the extra toppings. They literally melted inside my mouth. Coming to the dessert, it was the first ever Chocolate Pizza I've had in my life. And my first experience was awsome. The thin and hard crust of the pizza with lots of chocolate sauce, vanilla and chocolate chips is surely going win over your heart at a first glance itself. This place surely gives a tough competition to the Domino's and the Pizza Hut.

This is the place, which is highly recommendable. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I had a coupons for a chicken pizza, veg pizza both of any choice which was regular size..We also ordered a coke.Both were really cheesy and we loved it..we wanted to try more,so we again ordered their chicken pasta which was equally cheesy and tasty.

Would visit again soon.

Margherita pizza - cheesy and crisp at the right places..
Veggie delight - tasted wonderful with extra toppings of red paprica and olives..
Veg supreme garlic bread - filled with toppings and cheese..superbly delicious and one of the best garlic bread options I have had in the city...
PS. These guys have pineapple as an extra topping optionüòç
The place is definitely worth a try and worth the money...

Heard about Eagle boys alot and thought to try it finally.
I am not dissapointed but dissatisfied definitely.
I ordered 7inch chicken bbq with extra cheeze and extra chicken. I didnt find extra cheeze or extra chicken in my pizza that was disappointing. Due to rain delivery was late so pizza wasnt as hot as expected it to be.
Crust was soft and tasty! It was quite Filling. Loved the taste.
Special mention about the brownie, it was just the best i ever had till date. üòç

Yesterday 1st december eagle boys decided to deliver another pizza to my door step with extra cheese and extra chicken as i was pretty upset with my last order. I am so grateful for the initiative taken by them. Makes me feel that they are serious with the quality of production. Im definitely satisfied and the picture looks yum the taste is out of this world. Extraa cheezyy. Go ahead and i try it out yourself.

This place is making all the right noises among the foodies and pizza lovers. After repeated recommendations from my fellow foodie friends I decided to visit this and it was very evident why each one of them insisted me to visit so bad. Am not a ardent fan of pizza but yeah I do like to grab a bite once or twice a month with close friends over a pizza.
Till now no matter how pathetic Domino's and Pizza hut pizzas were that was the sole place to grab a quick bite,but thanks to the tough competition from this outlet that's a history now. 

Located over Em Bypass near to Ruby. Basic interiors yet the colour choices make it look funky. We ordered Passion fruit Mojito and it's a perfect thirst quenching drink. For appetizers we went for twisted seekh kabab rolls. Beautifully presented and tastes really good. Onion green chilli garlic bread is a bit on the crunchier side and tastes nice. Now for the main course we went for Garlic Prawn pizza, Chicken keema Pizza and Chicken Mexican pizza. Other than the Mexican pizza I had no idea the other@ two kinds of pizza could be ever possible and this no prior expectations to how they may taste. Mind was blown when I took the first. Chicken keema Pizza tastes like a piece of heaven and I highly recommend everyone to do try once. Garlic Prawn pizza amazed me as well. I never thought all those flavours mixed so well and created such marvellously  delicious dish.

And finally for dessert we ordered Tripple Chocolate Sweetza and this is yet another thing that EBP surprised me with. A really innovative dish of a small pizza that's Tripple layered with hot chocolate sauce and topped with choco dust and sugar dust. This has been my instant favourite ever since the day I tasted it here for the first time. I loved it so much I ordered it again and the staff happily delivered the next within just few minutes. Very prompt and helpful people. This place even do offer student discounts. This place has spoiled me for good and am never visiting any other place for pizza again. I highly recommend this place to every pizza lover in town.

The worst pizza joint ever. Their pizzas are fibrous and hard. Their pasta is a waste of money. We tried out some red sauce pasta. It was too sweet and we couldnt dare to finish the whole thing off as we had to forcibly gulp it down. Pizza crust was so hard, one had to hold the pizza with two hands while tugging at the other end with one's teeth. Not at all upto the mark!

Pizza's speak louder than words and maybe it's a way of life for the men of "Eagle Boy's Pizza" for they know how sophisticated is one's feelings are for pizza and thus they try their best to make a pizzaterian's visit,worth a while.

Situated near VIP Bazaar,EBP(Eagle Boys Pizza) specialises in Australian Cuisines but is popularly known for it's Pizza's with a twist in tale üçï

When talking about the decor of this place,simple yet effective is what presentation of this place is all about i.e the mix of colours Pink & Grey makes the place look vibrant and freshens your mood for good.

What's cooking? 

Appetizers :

‚Ä¢ Twisted Seekh kebab roll - The perfect combination of spices blending with the juices of the chicken fibres,beautifully wrapped with a twisted shaped crunchy crust,is a treat to your tastebuds and is the perfect appetizer to start off the "Eagle Boys Journey"

‚Ä¢ Onion Green Chilli Garlic Bread - Perfectly toasted round shaped breads accompanied by cheese batter of onion,garlic and chilli give it an spicy flavour yet the mildness of cheese balancing the overall taste


Drink's :

‚Ä¢ Passion Fruit Mojito - The three layered drink,where each layer had it's own characteristic flavour but wjat made it stand out?
The way each flavour complimented the other and when talking about the presentation,this is all about the passion for colours amd love for fruit.

Pizza's :

‚Ä¢ Chicken Mexicana Pizza -mexicana pizza is all about that characteristic tangy flavour derived from the sauce itself which on being mixed with the spices and the chicken,brings out the flavour of the pizza in full glory

‚Ä¢ Garlic Prawn Pizza - The characteristic feature of this pizza is "Vibrance",the way it looks and the way it tastes.The flavours of prawn is in perfect harmony with that of burnt garlic blending with cheese,giving it a vibrant flavour.The crust offered here is on the thinner side and will slide it's way from your tastebuds to the stomach and will give it a "pat" for welcoming such interesting flavours. FLAVOURSOME & CHEESY

‚Ä¢ Chicken Keema Pizza : Food fusion is in trend & Eagly Boys pizza has left no page unturned and has made their participation known by the introduction of the "Chicken Keema Pizza"
The crust which's offered in this genre of pizza is thick and the reason behind it's fat belly is the injected molten cheese.
The topping of this pizza is generally dominated by the Chicken Keema itself, which's the perfect story of indian spices blending with the cheese,conclusion?
Bursting flavours.

Dessert :

‚Ä¢ Tripple Chocolate Sweetza - Thin crust pizza layered with chocolate sauce,choco chips and nutties with the icing of sugary powder was something i never had before.The crust was on the crunchier side and the crunch was for a purpose and the purpose is to highlight the chocolate indulgences.Loved the presentation and hat's off to the conceptual framework.

With eagle boys pizza,make every hour a pizza hour and yes,good news for students i.e They give special discount to students(Carry your ID proofs) üòç

Great value for money pizzas. They taste great and they give tough competition to Dominos and Pizza Hut. The best pizzas on the menu are the Chicken Feast(Non Veg) & Veggie Feast(Veg).

People who used to have Pizza from Pizza Hut or Dominos‚Äô often goes through some bad experiences like thin crust, dry crust, less cheese & other topping etc. and at the end of the day they charged you a huge amount. This is like common scenario for all Pizza lovers like me. So when I heard about this place and their quality, I hardly resist myself to visit this restaurant with my foodie friends. So let‚Äôs come and explore this place.

The restaurant situated near VIP Bazar Bus Stop, Opposite to Shimla Biriyani. Just a little 2mins walk from the VIP bazar bus stoppage. A cozy small place with max capacity of 30-32 persons at a time. Well maintained and the pinkish touch in their d√©cor is also very attractive and the stuffs are really courteous.

So now let‚Äôs come to the food. The food we ordered were ‚Äì

Starter ‚Äì

1.	Twisted Seekh Kabab Roll (3.75/5.0) ‚Äì Small four pieces roll were there in a plate. The insider chicken portion was spicy and juicy in nature and it was wrapped with twisted shaped crust, which is also good. Mid spicy this item was perfect as a starter.

2.	Onion Green Chilli Garlic Bread (3.75/5.0) ‚Äì Four pieces round shaped bread were covered up with cheese batter of onion, garlic and chilli mixture. Little bit crunchy typed this item was really wow.

Main Course ‚Äì

1.	Chicken Mexicana Pizza [Deep Dish] (4.5/5.0) ‚Äì I always love the spiciness and the raw tangy flavor of Mexican pizza and be frankly speaking, I was really out of world when I take a bite in it. Deep layer of cheese with chicken chunkies, olive and chilly topping on top. Wow, in just one word. The sauce they used over it add the tanginess as well as spiciness which was really good. The cheese portion of the pizza was easily found when I take a slice. Love love and love.

2.	Chicken Keema Pizza [Cheesy Blast] (4.25/5.0) ‚Äì Chicken keema is one of the popular dish for Indians. But keeping that Indian taste with Italian dish was really something you don‚Äôt get everywhere. When the pizza came I became super excited by seeing the super puffy crust. But the surprise is yet to come. Take a bite and you can feel the cheese is coming out from the crust and that‚Äôs itz beauty. Awesome craftsmanship with superior skills of cooking. Olive and the chilly pieces added the extra spiciness which was perfect for Chicken keema flavor. Must ordered item here.

3.	Garlic Prawn Pizza [Big Cheese Base] (4.75/5.0) ‚Äì Probably for the first time I become so much impressed over a pizza only by its look. First come to the crust part, the crust was full made of cheese over the bread base. So, if you tilt down a slice of pizza, the upper crust will slide downwards itself automatically, so much cheesy crust it is. Now comes to the toppings, they have added onion chunk, Kashmiri mirch, small garlic pieces, grated coriander leaf and onion leaf as a veggies and prawn as a non veg toppings. Taste wise it was super awesome and the little prawn fragrance with cheesy touch makes this dish really finger licking. Super recommended item here.

Desserts ‚Äì

1.	Tripple Chocolate Sweetza (6.0/5.0) ‚Äì Basically it was a chocolate pizza made of thin crust. It was the first time, I had any chocolate pizza. The thin hard crust pizza was full covered with Chocolate sauce, vanilla and chocolate chips. The icing of sugar added some really desserts in your mouth. Love the item and love the presentation. Must must try item for any chocolate lover.

Drinks ‚Äì

1.	Passion Fruit Mojito ‚Äì Three layered drinks with full of refreshment. The awesomeness of the drink was as good as its look. Love it.

So in conclusion I will say, this was the best Pizza time experiences I have ever spent. With some finger licking pizzas and awesome desserts, Eagle Boys Pizza really make my day. So just a little request to all Pizza-lovers in Kolkata, please come here at least one and have your pizza according to your taste because EB Pizza will never let you down. Overall a great dining experiences and surely visit this restaurant again. :) :) :) :)

I must say this is the place I had the best pizza of my life till now . Yes the famous Eagle Boys Pizza from Australia is now in our " City Of Joy " with its Italian delicacies . Its just 2 mins away from VIP bazaar at sarada pally , over EM Bypass .¬†
It has a seating capacity of around 30 people , has a very good and friendly atmosphere . Friends r very friendly and well behaved .

¬†Drinks :

* Passion Fruit Mojito - It was a perfect refreshing drink .

* Coke

¬†Appetizers :

* Twisted Seekh Kebab Rolls - We have ate seekh kebab before also but here it has a twist . A piece of seekh kebab coated with a twisted baked light golden coating . Tastes yummm... Strongly recommended.¬†
* Onion Green Chilli Garlic Bread - Garlic Bread topped with green chillies and onions along with grated cheese .

¬†Main Course :

* Garlic Prawn Pizza -¬† First time experience to have Pizzas with seafood in continental style . Large cheesy pizza served with sizzling prawns and melted cheese and veggies.

* Chicken Keema Pizza - Pizza served in a spicy Desi Indian style. Filled with spicy chicken keema along with double layered cheese blast . Its just heavenly for cheese and pizza lovers because of its liquid cheese and soft crust . Very much Recommended
 .
* Chicken Mexicana Pizza - Pizza's in Mexican style with sliced chicken pieces , bellpeppers , onions and with extra shredded cheese . 

¬†Desserts :

* Tripple Chocolate Sweetza¬† - I had chocolate pizza before also but this was a bit different and tasty as well . Small pizza with tripple layered hot chocolate sauce with choco chips and sugar dust as toppings . Must try it hot as soon as it served otherwise the bread must get a bit stiffer . Recommended .

I must say its a great place to hangout with friends , specially who are pizza lovers . And one of the best thing I was going to miss , is to let you all know , specially students , that they are providing special discounts for all students . The only condition is you need to carry your ID card and come in your school or college uniform ... What can be better than this ????????

I am penning down this blog in the extreme excitement of my experience I encountered with the Pizzas last day. I was never a pizza lover until I visited EAGLE BOYS PIZZA. This place changed the whole concept of pizza with their culinary delights. Located at E.M. Bypass in ruby hospital area, this place is heaven for hardcore pizza lovers. The cheesy pizzy affair can be witnessed here very well because they will make sure that the proportion of cheese is as sufficient to make our tummy happy. Guess what is the cherry on top? Students get flat 25% discount all year around; so just show your Student ID and dig into some pizza affair.

In recent few months there‚Äôs many new outlet of Pizza (other than Pizza Hut & Domino‚Äôs) opened in the city of joy, Kolkata. Eagle Boys Pizza is one of the new pizza outlet on the Thakurnagar Panchpota Road, just opposite to Netaji Sporting Club O Samaj Kalyan Parishad. Eagle Boys¬†was an¬†Australian¬†fast food chain specializing in¬†Italian-American cuisine, in particular¬†pizza. Eagle Boys was founded in¬†Albury, New South Wales¬†by businessman Tom Potter in 1987. Since 1992, Eagle Boys national headquarters have been located in¬†Annerley, Queensland. In 2007¬†NBC Capital, a Queensland-based venture capital group, bought Eagle Boys from Potter. At the chain‚Äôs peak, in 2013, more than 340 Eagle Boys stores were operating across Australia. Outlet numbers fell drastically between the end of 2013 and the end of 2014 to around 170. In July 2016, fewer than 130 stores remained open and administrators were brought in to the head office to identify¬†restructuring options¬†ahead of a potential sale of the business, although the move did not extend to franchisee-operated outlets. In November 2016, Pizza Hut announced to media that it had merged with Eagle Boys. As at that date, 114 Eagle Boys stores operated throughout Australia; making it the fourth largest pizza chain in the country, with less than 10% share of the country‚Äôs pizza market.

‚ÄòIt‚Äôs nice to be important, but it‚Äôs more important to be nice‚Äô. I don‚Äôt think I could have said it any better myself. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a bigger pizza lover than me when it comes with some added cheese on Top or in layer !!!. I had the opportunity to dine at the Eagle Boys Pizza with some foodie friends today. The place has a feel of a cafe setting than your typical pizza joint.¬†¬†You can tell this is a local place, but we enjoyed the food and the atmosphere was very laid-back. A great spot if you want some pizza at EM Bypass!

Had a chicken feast pizza(10")delivered home from this joint. To start with, the pizza had a look and feel that was so different from the ones served at Domino's or pizza hut. One bite onto my first slice informed my taste buds that I am in for a treat. Simply delicious! And the best part is they use a generous amount of toppings. The crust was soft and the restrained use of cheese was a plus(too much cheese turn things bland). Recommended!

'Eagle Boy's Pizza' is located near Tagore Park which is close to Ruby. The above raring is not for the food but other reasons which will be discussed below.

We visited this outlet with high expectations . The shop is spacious and can accomdate nearbout 20 people. 

FOOD:- We ordered  one Chicken Supreme Feast Pizza(Chef's Choice) and a 300ml Coca Cola Fountain. The food was delivered to us within ten minutes. The pizza was delicious. The crust was cheese filled and had a helathy amount if toppings. We loved the food.

STAFF: The staff's behavior was amiable towards us. The lady who delivered the food to our table was ver well behvaed and friendly. Afrer our meal was over we could hear raised voices. The lady had not checked whether an order was paid or not. One of the staff,probably the floor manager was abusing her verbally in lewd language. He was threatening to physically abuse her . One thing,  mistakes may occur. One should counsel the person not abuse the person. It was disgusting to see such a thing. The management should look into the CCTV  footage and take appropiate actions. Such behvaior is not welcome in our foodie culture.

They may be good but not in my case.as home delivery we ordered pizza on saptami evening and to our utter dismay the order got an estimated arrival time in aprox 2hours.we were very hungry as we skipped our lunch and we planned to leave home just after having pizza but the order was delivered so late that we had to give up.finally it arrived and the pizza box was wet due to rain and the pizza was cold and chewy.I cdnt enjoy the melting cheese neither I was willing to finish it.
Zomato came as rescue.we had a chat with support team and they quickly reverted our money back.
This place is going ga ga all over kasba but I had a pretty bad experience but still I am willing to give this place another try by visiting there and not by home delivery

First of all I would like to mention that this rating was supposed to be 5 considering the food that was served and the service and ambience.
The pizza was delicious with loads of toppings and yummy crust filled with stringy cheese.
The decor is done tastefully.... though the location is quite like in the middle of nowhere.But they serve good food.
Now coming to the reason behind this rating.When we finished our food and we're about to leave.We heard a staff member badmouthing a lady staff in a very derogatory manner.And in such a high pitched voice that we could hear it all.I strongly oppose this.This type of behavior was totally unexpected and very disheartening.Strict action should be taken by the authority that nothing of this sort should happen again.

Don't compare with other brands. Thinner body with just enough toppings to eat without adding more. Cheese filling adds more mouthful. Cheese flavour is tangy, some may not like it.

Now, as it was a bulk lunch order for 60ppl, we went a nite befre to chk if they can delivery on time.. while placimg d order dwy suggested not to hav thin crust for a delivery as high chnce of getting hard..can have it while ur dere..

However cheese burst was super hit too.. all of d pizza tasted too good. Keema pizza i personally liked a lot.. a prawn garlic was tried by somw frnds and dey liked that aswel.. in short a mustt try for ppl...

This is one place about which i mostly read positive reviews on Zomato and wanted to try it out instantly. Understandably, had quite high hopes from this place but turned out to be an utter disappointment. Its possible that i was unlucky but whatever it was, it was a pretty bad experience.

We ordered:
‚Ä¢ Spicy Cheesy Scroll - It was not baked properly, the fillings were simply too less. The cheese had not melted properly on the inside.
‚Ä¢ Veg Mexicana (with extra cheese) - It felt like they were doing some cost cutting. The toppings were not enough. The cheese was so hard, i could barely chew it. It was like i am having a pizza of some roadside corner shop.
‚Ä¢ Peri Peri Paneer (with Cheese Burst): They tried to copy Dominos but rather unconvincingly. This was better than Veg Mexicana but the cheese burst was somewhat sour because of which i couldn‚Äôt enjoy it enough.

That being said, i would not recommend you to go to this place. Personally, i am never going back there.

Disclaimer: Don‚Äôt be tempted by the photographs. Its just good photography üòâ

In the monopoly of Dominos & Pizza hut all around kolkata,Eagle boys can proudly have their own fair share of stake in the pizzeria field. Any loyal dominos/pizza hut lover would crave for more if they visit eagle boys for their pizzas. So on the eve of choturthi where foodies were fighting over places in major food joints, my friend

Great taste and wide varieties of dishes. Pizzas and pastas are delicious. Although delivery took time, the food taste did easily compromise the matter.

Well very disappointed with the whole first time experience with Eagle boys is what i can say..My online order # 37786124 which was Non Veg Pizza Meal worth 499 . Well after much guidance though my address is situated on the main road the delivery boy made it by 10.50pm before the estimated time 10.53 pm. However he did not deliver the complete order and missed the cold drink delivery. I always order coke/thumbs up along with pizza from dominos/pizza hut and gulp cola along with eating pizza..He went and bought back the thumbs up pet bottle at 11.30 pm by which time the pizza wasn't hot any more..Had to manage with a cold pizza and garlic bread.Hence the pizza did not taste so good..Also I was expecting the cheese content to be more after reading all the reviews but it left a lot to be desired.. all in all a pretty disappointing experience and won't order again..

The pizza crusts are quite buttery and soft and the overall pizzas here are quite cheesy but on the occasions I had ordered via home delivery the toppings were meager given the price range.

This restaurant has the best pizza's in town. You have to compare this restaurant with fire and ice pizzeria. Anyways let me come to my order:-
1) Chicken Feast - The pizza had a lot of toppings and was full of variety. It contained chunky chicken, spicy chicken, fried chicken,mushroom,olives and of course onion. 
2) Garlic Bread - We ordered a super cheesy garlic bread and it was the best garlic bread I have ever had amongst all the pizza fast food restaurants. It was I think mozzarella cheese. Whatever it was it was too good. This restaurant is truly recommend.

Enjoy your food at Eagle Boy's Pizza üçï üçï

Sadly there was no option of giving a rating of 0 else I could have done so. I went there yesterday evening to treat my son on his birthday along with family. I had always wanted to try some different pizza joint since we are a regular at DOMINOS & PIZZA HUT.  We were really looking forward to enjoying delicious pizzas baked by Eagle boys, but never got a chance to taste those highly rated pizzas. As we entered, first of all we were surprised by the dull interiors, unclean floors and total empty place (no customers, nor anybody behind the counter !) We searched for a clean place to sit but couldn't find one and had to call the staff to wipe one table so that we can sit. She made a face which conveyed that we had asked for some out of the line favour, and brought a dry wiping cloth and just waved on the soiled table. We requested her over and over again too please clean the table properly since the food and cola stains were all over the table and floor. There was no eagerness from the lady staff and this kind of behavior totally put us off and we decided to leave. Now the best part is that no one from the eagle boys bothered to even ask us the reason for leaving without having the food. We had to fall back on DOMINOS which serves amazing pizzas and customer satisfaction is of prime importance to them.

Worst restaurant ever visited... Not because ofThe food but the horrible service provided.. we went on Saturday around 1pm.. and there was no pasta, scroll or anything that you wanted.. not even wifi as mentioned by zomato.. we had to settle for potato wedges which were as good as home made "alo bhaja" and the lastly the staff... Who would hardly cater to your needs.. plz don't visit if you value your hard-earned money

Ordered online today from zomato. The prawn pizza was with a thin crust and was delicious, this is something that one will never get in dominos or pizzahut. The chicken feast pizza was a deep dish one and was extremely soft and beautiful. The home delivery service is really good, came pretty fast. The brownie was chocolatey , melt in the mouth and delicious. I'm really happy with Eagle Boys. Keep up the good work guys!!

I have orderedPeri Peri Chicken Pizza [10 Inches]

Base : Thin and Crispy

Non Veg Toppings : Spicy Chicken, BBQ Chicken.
Through Zomato. The Eagle pizza delivery boy had delivered the pizza.
The taste and price wise it is same or slight better(in terms of crust) as Dominos. Nothing different.The oregano mixture should be provided in plastic/paper sealed cover rather in a tissue paper to maintain the hygiene.

Had a decent experience here, would like to talk about the negatives before I get it the positives. Firstly the customer service started off as terrible. I hate the idea that people feel the need to answer a phone delivery instead of take my order while I'm standing right in front of your face, so I had to wait till the server (there was only one at the counter)got off the phone then give my order. Secondly I ordered two personal pizzas asked for the buy one get one free offer and was told it was only offered on Wednesday , though nothing was mentioned on the screen , thus felt like false advertising. Nonetheless I did order 2 non veg personal pizzas, a 10 inch pizza and a pasta also non veg, and a plate of peri peri fries. Didn't have to wait too long for the order to arrive. The taste of the pizzas were all satisfactory nothing great and yet not too bad. The pasta was alright again nothing to die for. However the saving grace were the fries. There was something nostalgic about eating the peri peri fries. The Portuguese spice when mixed with the potato wedges tasted like a flavour of uncle chips that had gone out of the market a long long time ago. I am a bit disappointed that in a pizza parlour, the fries were the best item on the menu. However I will visit this place again just based on the peri peri fries even if I don't order anything else from the menu.

The reason for giving them a rating 2.5 entirely is because of their service. I did not expect such inefficient staff from them after having seen excellent ratings and reviews on zomato. 
We placed our order at around 2:40 in the afternoon and took our seats.. Even after giving them a reminder about our order after nearly half an hour, they had no response to serve us. We could see people coming after us getting their pizzas served. Finally after another 20 mins I decided to see if there is something wrong. Our order was given after our secong complaint. It is really not expected from such a well known restaurant. We had to leave without even having our pizza properly cos of time shortage. Who would like to visit them next time? Highly dissatisfied with their service!

The only con is its location (the car route is difficult). Apart from this, I am quite impressed. What a soft pizza crust!! We ordered prawn garlic pizza(a very simple yet innovative), chicken mexicana and merry panner pizza. All of those were lipsmackingly delicious. Loved the quality of cheese, prawn and chicken.
Very much recommended.

Update:
Reduced the rating from 5 to 3.5, due to the horrible delivery experience!!! It took them more than 1.5 hours to deliver to a place which is 3.5 kms away.

OLD REVIEW:

I have to start by saying that this is by far the best pizza I've eaten in Kolkata. I have had Pizza from Pizza Hut, Dominos, Mezuna, Chilli's, and few other places which are unworthy of individual mentions.

We ordered a Chicken Feast 10", Cheesy Chicken 10" with additional toppings, and Cheesy Garlic Scroll. Why I say this is the best I have had?

(1) The Dough: Its perfect. Not chewy, neither too soft to taste under-cooked. Absolutely yummy by itself.

(2) The Toppings: Woha, I hope they were not generous with the toppings by mistake. I really was amazed by the equal amount of all the toppings on both my pizza.

(3) The Taste & Balance: They have specially aced it in this department. The taste was amazing, to say the least. I have never been so mesmerised by any Pizza in my life. Reason being the perfect  balance of taste and flavour; they are neither inclined towards tanginess, nor salty or any other flavour; it's just the right balance that gives you every taste optimally.

(4) The Garlic Scroll: The bonus score for making the usual pizza starter so good. Cheesy garlic scrolls are unfairly put against Garlic Breads & breadsticks, with such great taste and quality. Hands down champion in this segment.

(5) The Cost: I wouldn't say they are cheap but I will say they are very competitively priced and actually makes more value for money considering the all the above mentioned points.

To end with, I have often seen my feedback for a place creates such sky-rocking expectations that some of my friends and acquaintances end up being a little disappointed. So go with a clean slate and open mind. I'm sure people will like it.

**Revised Review:

Day 1: 
Ordered marghareeta pizza cheese blast.
Order took over 1.5hrs from order to delivery.
The Pizza was cold as shit.... & Hard as rock.
"Never ordering from here again...."

Day 2:

The very next day Mr. Antony, the manager called me up, profusely apologized for the event of last Eve and even sent me 2 pizzas (on the store)

I must say, the pizzas were moist, succulent and fresh ..... Just as pizzas should be!!
It a completely changed the perception of Eagle Boys Pizza.

I should suggest Margarita pizza with big cheese and pinapple as extra topping... And some coke to wash it down with!!.....‚Ä¶.
Tastes like heaven!!!

I must say, the outlet can easily compete with the likes of Domino's and pizza hut.  

The after sales service is awesome!!
Thanks Mr Antony!!

Firstly thanks to zomato for the free brownie treat & for your help in getting the order. Now coming to this restaurant...the only reason I didn't give it a perfect score is because of it's 30-35 minutes delay.:( Everything else is perfect...from pizza to the free cheese garlic roll... although my order was delivered pretty late, it's worth mentioning that not only the food was still hot, the delivery guy was very apologetic...I ordered zesty chicken pizza (medium size) with which I got the garlic bread and brownie treat free.. bill was 317 after 20% discount from zomato which is good enough...other pizza shops are damned expensive. I saw their leaflet... they've great deals for each day.. I'm definitely giving you a visit soon!!!

"Pizza is really good here, better than pizza hut & dominos; but their service is crap. Moreover another complain I have is that they charge extra say for extra cheese, or chicken or extra veg toppings, but one cannot find any extra when the pizza got delivered. So I felt a bit cheated."

The above being my earlier review with a rating of 3, I have changed it to 5 now because of their customer centric behavior coming from both the head & the manager of the store. Extremely happy I am by seeing how they have worked on my complain. Pizza is no doubt the best in town like I have mentioned, they have also made me feel special since I had a bit of issue with their service. Thanks a ton, keep up the good work.

ordered pizzas from eagle boys on a friend's recommendation. Experience was not very good.
It took them 90 mins to deliver one medium sized pizza at a distance of not more than 5kms.
I ordered cheese burst crust which lacked enough cheese, keep aside the "burst" part. This was highly disappointing. We were searching for the cheese in the crust. 
Taste was ok, ofcourse, what is a pizza which doesn't have enough cheese? 
A not so good first time experience, so won't consider visiting it or re-ordering from here again.

Ordered a margarita pizza and a cheese chicken pizza (13 inch) only to find that the pizza solely tasted of burnt cheese.

Having ordered from EBP several times in the past, it saddened me to find that the quality of pizza served had deteriorated so massively. 

However, EBP delivered a margarita pizza to me free of cost yesterday which tasted just as good as it did in the past.

The burnt pizza could have been a one off incident.

A worthy competitor of the other long standing pizzerias of the city. The quality of the pizza is very good, with fresh and soft bread and ample toppings.

Ate a Pizza with Pineapple slices in it today a while ago. There ! Said it and liked it too. Generally , I have heard from certain pizza lovers of Kolkata that Pineapple doesn't go well with pizzas. But I guess , they should have given this a try before settling down with an opinion. Therefore, was at home, hungry so thought of trying out some food from the pizza joint near my place .

Pros.
On time delivery at home.
Courteous Staff.
Liked the taste .

Cons.
Could have improvised a little by including vegetables in the Pizza. It would have really enhanced the taste plus the presentation of the food.

Suggestion for Zomato : Please accept RuPay cards as Credit & Debit Card option since I have ordered through Zomato but was unable to pay by my card.

Its really saddening how they changed a loyal customers preference in an hour. Ordered the pizza 1.5 hours ago. Delivered late. They didn't give the garlic bread at all. All they kept saying is that they'll call and check. Only after telling them I wouldn't accept the order did they deliver it in 5 mins. Extremely sad. They know how to make perfect pizzas but they can't retain customers.

Never been there in the restaurant physically but ordered a lot for home delivery. Very quick response by its delivery boys and behaviour also good. Food quality and packing both are attractive. Will recommend to taste its different pizzas.

A pizza chain to break the monotony finally. The pizza tastes different and different for good. Choices offered are sufficient, restaurant interior is just fine. Service I'd quick and pizza tastes really good. The only downside, only one outlet.

Ordered for pizzas on 23/7/17. The order ( pre paid) was placed at 8:30 pm and was scheduled to be delivered by 9:35 pm. Finally the order reached us at 10:20 pm. My child,  who was all excited for her pizza, waited and waited and eventually  fell asleep without eating anything. The outlet provided the delivery person's phone number but obviously he didn't bother to answer his phone.  The pizza was cold and soggy. No condiments or seasonings were served with the pizza.  This was the first time I ordered from Eagle Boy Pizza and MOST DEFINITELY IT'S THE LAST TIME!!! Disgusting service . Wish there was an option for negative rating. They don't deserve a rating  of even  1 !!!

Eagle boys really serves great pizzas. We had this keema pizza. Pizza was really tasty. We had chocolate brownie also. It was not that great. At the end I would like to say that service need to be improved. The staffs are not at all trained. The should be much more cautious.

Apparently the biggest pizza joint of Australia now opened by the Bypass road close to ruby. I there multiple time. Unlike the photos put up inside the joint the actual pizzas served were nothing like it. Anyways they have their BOGO offer on Wednesday so that when we went there. The pizzas were nice though nothing incredible. It may be just me but I did not like the cheese there .. Dominoes and pizza hut offer better pizzas

So,finally, hearing a lot about this, I with my two friends went there(actually it was a  birthday treat from a friend).Located three bus stops away from Ruby Hospital, it was kind of difficult to reach there as no vehicle(public transport,ps:buses travel by but that's not a stoppage) reaches there,u got to walk but when we reach there, oh! boy it was totally worth it! pleasant sitting arrangement without television!  we sat by the window couch, could see it raining outside!
Abiut food,we ordered one mint mojito,2 fountain coke, chicken mexicana pizza with extra cheese and veg extravaganza(we got it for free as on wedesday you get free pizza on ordering a large ir medium pizza but the free one has to be less or equal to the price of the ordered pizza).The counter's boy served us with all of them! It was super delicious and definetly far far better than all the pizza stores  for thesame price or higher we have in kolkata right now.
The one without the extra cheese was sufficiently cheesed to my surprise! Will visit again  for sure.

This pizza transformed my life . These were its effects :¬†

1>Pizza Addiction Cure --- It made sure that I do'not have any desire to either look or eat any pizza in a long time.

2>Ideology Change ---It changed my "radical mindset of going to the store & confronting the owner" to " Non-violence of Gandhian'ism due to the sheer stomach pain it caused"

3>Rest & Relaxation --- For a Rs 630 medium size pizza ,it made sure that i spend another Rs 100 at the doctor & spend the rest of the day lying in bed disregarding my busy schedule.

How amazing !!!! Ever had a pizza do all that ? ..no ? .. because mine did !!

By now,you've come to understand all the above is sarcasm. The truth is , this pizza is the single most horrendous,tasteless,vomit inducing piece that i have ever ate.I never thought i would say that about pizza.

The pizza itself came off-center,almost coming out of the package ..but its understandable for travelling in road.Perfectly reasonable ..whats not reasonable are these :

1>White not-Cheese : First of all , that white thing you see ,that's not cheese.I too thought it was cheese at first & was so happy ,that i got so much of it ..only it wasn't. Ever had sour milk that had expired ,this tasted exactly like that ,only slimier.

The taste..i gagged at the first taste & forced my self to eat some.I spent the rest of the day in bed with medicine for that mistake.I was retching at the phantom taste even hours after .

2>No slice : Now a pizza is sliced into parts ,right ?? Not this one ,it was like a whole continuous bread ,i had to cut it using knife myself.

3>Is this pizza ? : This was 2 bread (1 above & 1 at bottom) kept flimsily held together by that expired cheese.The top slid away when i put slight force on it.

4>No Add-on : I paid extra for Jalapenos add-on..didn't come.Waste .

5>Onion Extravaganza : I had this same pizza "Chicken Feast Pizza" before...it was not this abomination of a thing.There was 4-5 pieces of meat in this medium Pizza ,a few mushroom thing's & a truckload of onions(did they forget i ordered non-veg pizza ?...onions covered everything).I could have just ate the toppings ...except all of it was covered with that disgusting expired cheese.

This pizza looked & tasted like it was made by a particularly dumb 5 year old who never made pizza ,looked at the manual ,couldn't read & followed the pictures.

My order no. is 29742217 on July 10,2017 at 11:49 AM.

I sincerely hope that you find who prepared this thing & discipline him/her ,because let me tell you if something had happened to me because of this & i would have to go to the hospital(yes..my health was getting that bad ),then i would have sued your store in court for food poisoning along with complaining in the Food Safety NCH forum.

I have kept part of the original pizza for food tasting & analysis .If nothing happens ,i would throw it away.But if it does,well I've got evidence.

Laying in bed I wished i could have force-fed His/her own creation to the pizza maker , now i just want to write a review to warn others ...It will probably be fine if you order in-store but be careful when you ask for delivery.

Biological warfare : I am someone who usually orders pizza for delivery & eats it at the mall- from Domino's,Pizzahut. Now i remembered why ...brand matters.I doubt ,their quality control would have let this disgusting piece get out of the store .Now,sometimes it has happened the pizza is less tasty,lukewarm -these things happen & i don't complain.They are natural mis-steps . But this ,its not pizza ..its biological warfare.

I am tired ,the entire thing was a waste of money ,health , patience ,time ...

I just wanted to let other prospective customers know & be warned & pray this doesn't happen to them ...I wouldn't want this on my worst enemy.

1 hrs and 45 mins is a pretty long time for pizza delivery. I had seen this place thousand time enroute Ruby Hospital, and had been thinking to try this place out for about 2 yrs now. But since I am not a great pizza fan it took me time. When today - on this Saturday evening - I found myself craving for a pizza I decided to put a tick on this pending list. 

I ordered -
Aussies special chicken pizza
Cheese garlic bread
Chicken popcorn
Brownie

It took almost quarter to an hour for the order to reach my place despite the fact that I live just 2 kms away from their outlet. What I could make out from the lukewarm pizza and garlic bread is fact that if eaten hot, they might give dominos a run for their money anyday. 

The brownie was excellent. Full size, rich, right texturs in right places. But chicken popcorn was nothing but the same frozen stuff we get in spencer's. I have given 3 stars anticipating that the pizza experience would have been far better if I would have been served hot, and that the taste and service are different parameters when rating a restaurant. Otherwise it deserves 4. Will go back.

A must go for all the pizza lovers

I gave them 4, because their AC was not working properly and the staffs were not that helpfull! After repeated complain they came and helped us and problem got resolved!

Nevertheless it was an awesome experience! Thank you pizza kolkata

Been here so many times and the food is really nice. But this time we faced a new kind of problem. They do not serve pet bottle of any aerated beverages so we have to take it from outside. So we did it previously. This time they didn't allow us for so. That was quite surprising. Another this the staffs were very loude among themselves and it is kind of disturbing.

Today I visited Eagle Boys with friends, after hearing about its mouth watering pizza. After a long time I enjoyed real good pizza....I was so bored of the usual pizza joints....We ordered Peri Peri Cheese Scroll, veg and non-veg pizza both along with Chocolate pizza as dessert and Mint Mojito. The best part of the pizza was..the bottom and side of the pizza was crunchy, the dough was soft from inside and the toppings were made tasty with plenty of cheese. I just have to point out two things which I feel they need to improve...the service should be little faster and the ambience (Air Conditioner not working properly) must be comfortable for the guests. Having said that, the food was worth waiting. I am looking forward to taste Eagle Boys pizza again....Must go, if you want to experience good pizza.

I have been craving Eagle Boys Pizza since I've heard a truck load of good reviews from my friend. 
They don't offer home delivery in my area so I made it a point to takeaway my pizza one sultry afternoon. 

I ordered for a Peri Peri Chicken with extra chicken and cheese. 

I waited for like 15 mins.

I opened the box and bam! The aroma of the freshly baked bread truly complemented the spicy flavor. Also, there were ample toppings, I couldn't even see the base lol.

It was really fresh and yummy. 

Hoping to try out the other ranges. 

Wish they could open more branches nearby for availing home delivery.

Loved the pizza too good. But had a very bad experience when ordered with swiggy. Swiggy guy took 1 hr 30 mins to deliver. When pizza reached me it was cold but taste was awesome. I m writing here so that restaurant people can talk to swiggy people. Swiggy guy did not have a delivery bag he bought the pizza in the compartment below the svooters sit. I complained to swiggy and uninstalled the app. But will surely visit eagle boys pizza

So we went here and even though the place is kinda awkwardly placed.. you have to get down at vip bazar and walk just 2 mins..
Anyway, it the ambience is ok i guess.. plus the live screening of match(india vs Bangladesh) was going on
The Boys of EBP are well behaved.
We had 3 medium pizzas and 1 i took home..
The crust and the pizzas were all delicious but the problem was.. it was a bit too salty.. 
Had the BBQ chicken, Spicy Chicken, Chicken Mexicana
And took home and ate Chicken Feast..
Loved the last..

Visited on a wednesday.No rush.Empty seats,live Pak vs Eng game(champions trophy) on a big LED screen.nice cozy seats.Easy location.In short the ambience was good.
Ordered-
Aussie's special pizza,non veg,extra cheese and chicken keema.
Tandoori pizza,non veg,extra cheese.
Pasta in white sauce,non veg.
Two cup of coffees.
There was an offer,one medium sized pizza free with another.They pushed me to take that offer.
Well after my order,i paid them before they served.I felt the bill to be extra than what it should be.Then i saw that they have charged for the tandoori pizza which was supposed to be free.After i asked them,they immediately changed the bill and refunded me the balance.Highly satisfactory.
Now coming to food,the pizzas must be the best in the town.Mindblowing.The Aussie's@ special pizza had pineapple chunks which was pretty unique.I topped it with chicken keema and extra cheese.
Pasta on the other hand was equally delicious.
In short,This place is the PIZZA KING.
Only problem is there service.They were really busy but somehow we felt ignored.Had to call them for water.It became hard to grab their attention.This area must be resolved.
Happy Eating.
Highly reccomended.

Had heard a lot of good stuff about this place. So decided to check this pizza point and can say was pretty happy with it. The place appeared to me a bit small but that may be because they want it to be like this only.
Talking about the food... We ordered one veg and one chicken based pizza. And to my surprise they tasted way better than what I was expecting . The cheese and the toppings in comparision to the price at what they were available was quite amazing.Along with tha pizzas we had chicken popcorn(which was pretty good) and cheese garlic bread(a must try)
The only bad experience was the brownie. After such a nice meal I expected the brownie too to be of that level but it turned out to be quite like a store bought artificial chocolate cake. But overall if I ignore the brownie everything about this place can be praised, pizza, staff, cleanliness, everything...

I had been craving a cheesy pizza for a long time and the chicken feast pizza that we had took care of that. We took an extra cheese pizza and boy it was worth every penny. With our order of two cokes and a large pizza got a complimentary cheese scroll and we were all smiles. Would love to visit again. However, the only glitch - the location is a bit odd, you see this joint right there every time you pass e.m.bypass but travelling by local mode of transport and naming the exact stop can be difficult.

I take my pizzas very seriously, and I'm very particular about the base and topping. This pizza joint totally lives upto the expectations to each and every aspect. The Aussie's favorite chicken pizza is what I can definitely call as perfection. With oodles and cheese both in the base and as topping, you're good to go to the path of heaven as you taste it. The desserts are pretty good as well, though the brownie bites we took was a little too hard and burnt once, other than that everything is super awesome. Giving a very tough competition to the pizza leads dominos and pizza hut, this joint has become our hot favorite for pizzas now.

We went there on one Wednesday and ordered a medium non veg pizza. The best thing was that there was an offer and so we got another medium non veg pizza freeüòÅ. We also had simply non veg pizza , virgin mojito and brownie bites. The pizzas were amazing, it had soft crust and toppings had enough amount of cheese and chicken. Now coming to the brownie bites I didn't like the taste at all, I had better brownies in other places. The virgin mojito was refreshing as expected.

Eagle boys has a small stall in my school's cafeteria- a lifesaver when I forget my lunch at home.

The pizzas are good (nothing exemplary or mind-blowing though, which isn't something you should expect at this price point anyway), and the garlic bread is great.

The food is really cheap, especially relative to chains such as pizza hut or domino's that sell food of a comparable quality.

All in all, a great place - I would strongly recommend it to anyone on a student's budget.

Breakdown:-

Food: 4/5

Ambience & Service: I can't really judge them on this since I've only ever eaten at their stall in my school - I've never actually been to the restaurant. I can, however, vouch for their home delivery being quick and efficient.

Ordered the Spicy Chicken pizza online on zomato. Delivery was on time. It cost Rs 205 which is 10 bucks more that what Dominos charges for Spicy Ckicken Pizza. But the taste is way better than Dominos according to me personally. Spicy with a dash of sweetness because of the tomatoes n corn. I absolutely loved it.

The worst pizza ordering experience ever...After a promised delivery of 50 mins it took an hour and a half for the delivery. The pizza was stone cold and the crust had become rubbery. Also when we opened the packets there were no seasonings provided. I have ordered many times but this was a very disturbing experience..

Frankly, pizza isn't that great. Had ordered chicken BBQ pizza which I found very ordinary. Had travelled so much to eat here,but it was a total disappointment.Among the desserts, we ordedred sweetza and brownie which were good but the size of sweetza was huge,we couldn't finish it entirely.

I ordered chicken keema pizza there. It was an online order. Delivery time was more than an hour. Pizza was nice. Indian masala flavoured. Bread was soft but not fluffy. Cheese was little less. I like the Italian seasonings better so may be I didn't find it that good. Dominos is still better choice for me.

Good pizzas and good ambience. The locality isn't all that hot, and there isn't enough parking space around the restaurant. However I believe most of their business is done in home deliveries. So that hasn't probably presented a problem to them.
They make some mean pizzas. Try this place if you've tired of the same old boring Dominos or Pizza Hut. You'll be surprised.

After first visit,must say that eagle boys are much much better than dominos..their pizza bases are much softer, crispy and loaded with full of cheese..tried only two types,keema and bar b q,both of them are too good.. Prices are reasonable,very good service also..but,one big problem...they dont serve cold drink in a pet bottle 600ml....you can order that for take away,but not for dine in..they dont have any valid reason for that..why i take that 600ml bottle for 55 plus vat for take away?so,if you want to take cold drink,you have to take fountain 300ml for 35 for dine in....thats a new type of rule....dont know why...

I have been to Eagle Boys Pizza in Pune, and I liked their pizza very much, because the crust that they use is neither too dry nor too oily and also their Pizzas can satiate my greed for cheese. I saw this outlet in Kolkata on E.M Bypass and insisted my boyfriend to go with me. We also found a little app coupon for this place. It's not difficult to locate. The staff was well behaved and the place was nicely decorated too. It has offers going on during weekdays. The pizzas we ordered were spicy chicken and BBQ chicken. Both of them tasted great and had good amount of cheese. We ordered two coke and the bill for the coke was only 84 including taxes. Loved the place, will visit again.

After booking my first car I thought of celebrating it with a pizza. My girlfriend told me about this chain. She had been in one of their outlet at pune. I was not sure how it will turn out. But the offer of one pizza free with one was lucrative. Finding it was too easy. Right beside EM Bypass near uttar panchanna. 
We ordered one spice chicken classic and got a barbeque chicken classic full free. The price was too Pocket friendly. 
The crusts are really soft and so was the whole pizza. It dint even feel like that am having a whole pizza in just 15 mins. (Though it was heavy in the end and I could not eat much at night)
I will recommend everyone to try out here. It's better than the overpriced pizzas at pizza hut and much tastier. Best part is we took two coke and the bill was just 54. Liked it for their ambiance and ever smiling staffs.

I heard a lot about the place. So went there to have my 21st pizza of this year, as I was bored of Domino's. The location is kind of awkward. It's‚Äãin between of two bus stops. So you may have to walk a little to reach there. I have a discount coupon so I got a BBQ Chicken and a Chick Sheekh, each of 10 inch at just Rs.345 including all the taxes. The actual price is around Rs.948 including taxes. So yes, I got a great deal. There are enough space to sit. It is not much crowded. When I went there, I was the only customer there. Swiggy guys were there for pick up but no more customers. I don't know why. The ambience is more or less good. 
Now coming to the pizza. I ordered the pizza for takeaway. The pizza was ready within 15 minutes, that's‚Äã good. When I reached home, the pizza was cold. It took me a long time to go to home, so can't blame them for that. But still, I opened the box and the smell was enough to make you hungry. Both the pizzas were more than just good. I loved it. They gave me less origanos, but still, it was enough. The crust of the pizza was different from Domino's or Pizza Hut. It was like more softer. I have seen people who don't eat the end of the pizza because it's‚Äã not that soft. But here, you can have it too. You will even love it. The cheese and mayonnaise is like the cherry of this cake.   I enjoyed every bite of it. I hope you will love it too. 
Go there and try out something new.

Updated Review: I decided to update my review because after reading my review the owner himself decided to contact me to apologize for the cold pizza and also offerred another Garlic Prawn Pizza. Now talking about the Pizza which I recieved piping hot this time, it was just wonderful! All the flavors that couldn't come through last time because of being cold was very much present this time. There was a generous amount of Prawns in it, and because it was hot the Pizza was very chessy too. I personally decided to increase my rating because I was blown away by the good behavior of the owner. It's hard to come across people like this nowadays who actually care about their customers. 4 star rating from me. The only reason I am holding 1 star is beacuse I want to order from them in future also and hope they continue delivering hot pizzas!

Always used to watch this place while traveling to my office in Sec V. So on the auspicious day of Poila Boishak decided to order from them. I ordered Chicken Nugget, 10 inch Garlic Prawn Pizza, and 7 inch Australia's Favourite Veg Pizza. Talking about their service, well the delivery boy understood the address the first time I explained him, and it was a pleasant surprise because many delivery boys gets rude this day. Now about my main part, food, well let's just say the Chicken Nuggets were a bit too salty. I mean, from the first bite I regret not ordering from KFC. The Nuggets were salty and just not good at all. The Garlic Prawn Pizza which is a very hyped pizza from them, I guess it would have tasted good if only it was hot. Although the Nuggets were hot when it reached me, the pizza got cold. And as it happens with cold pizzas, it was tough to chew. I personally haven't taste the Australia's Favourite Veg Pizza, but my mother told me it was decent. Overall, I would rate them 2 stars, and would suggest only Pizzas from them as my experience with Nuggets is terrible.

I went there on Friday and at that time some kind of special offer was going on. So we got nonveg medium pizzas(6 slice) in as low as 240/- bucks before tax. Pretty good deal if you ask me. We had Cheesey chicken and BBQ Chicken.What impressed me most is the bread they use,which is much more softer than Dominos or Pizza hut. Cheese,chicken,and onions used were also fresh. Would definitely recommend. Hope they open in multiple locations pretty soon. :)

Have not been to this place physically, but home deliveries from this restaurant has been quite frequent. Though initially I was quite skeptical about opting for this place instead of Domino's, I must say they have proved themselves to be superior each time. I had started of from their very ordinary Cheese Chicken Pizza, and was surprised how amazing the bread was. Soft and fluffy are the two words that instantly hit my mind which is definitely not the case with Dominos. Ever since then, I have tried out their Veggie Feast, Spicy Chicken and the Chicken Feast. Not even one was disappointing. The chicken pieces were quite large and plenty in number which is such a blessing. Their portion of dressings is something i really really like. Definitely waiting to try out some other items from the menu minus the pizzas. The .5 less rating was only because I feel their is still room for a little improvement. But thumbs up to the great quality!

We had ordered BBQ Chicken,AUSSIE FAV PIZZA and Chicken keema pizza. As per their recommendation we went for Chicken keema pizza which I can bet is one of the hidden delicacy ever explored by other pizza houses. Overall a 5 star from my side. Good job Eagle Boys.

Went to pick up their Pizza during Durga Puja when they were a newly opened outlet.There were no customers in the store but the place looked inviting and pretty spacious for a Pizza outlet.Ordered for a Veg Pizza (can't remember the name) and was excited to see the Deep Dish crust option which I absolutely love and hence opted for the same.

The serving time was decent but was very surprised to see 2 of their staff (including the one manning the order counter) get into a bad verbal argument about some work related issue.They didn't even care that we were right there in front of them which was very unprofessional and unpleasant.

Coming to the food,the Pizza was okay but nothing like how a true Deep Dish Pizza should be like.However,it sort was thicker than other options available with their competitors.

There have been changed in their menu since then and I have read great reviews about their Garlic Prawn Pizza.Being a sea food lover,would definitely like to try it sometime

Have only opted for home delivery.

Different from the usual Dominos and PH. 

Their Aussies pizza with pineapples tastes really good... unlike the usual spicy pizzas, this one is not very spicy and the pineapples give a fruity sweet surprise. Add on corn and extra chicken to punch this up.

The default pizza base is way better than that of Dominos, it is soft and buttery.

The other pizza you should try is the Garlic prawn pizza... tastes¬† great, add some jalape√±o to spice up.

But last time I had ordered¬† 2 pizzas and they gave just 2 chilli flakes and one oregano sachet... and that was surprising.

I want to visit their outlet once but their location is really very bad.... specially with this metro construction going on.

Well, have seen the outlet from bus!! Comparatively a new kid on the block, apart from Domino's. Well, have not dined over there ever, so can't judge a book by the cover. Because of their comparatively low price and good quality, it is gaining fame in students' circle. 
We mainly opt for home delivery. Our staple order is - veg singles combo and non-veg singles combo. Well, pizza tastes good but why do they provide tomato ketchup with pizza? No idea. But, they provide very less packets of oregano and chilli flakes. It would be better if they start providing more packets of oregano and chilli flakes

I went to this place with my best friend for¬† casual date. We are both ardent pizza lovers and had our eye on this one for a long time. Finally, the date happened and it was one of our best! Mostly because of the food.We ordered a spicy scroll and¬†a medium sized Chicken Keema pizza. The choice of crusts is an added bonus that no other pizza places in this budget offers. And the food was lipsmackingly good! Do visit this place for authentic pizzas. If you do, I am sure you'll never visit Domino's or PHD ever again! 
Another thing, they got crazy crazy deals for every day of the week! Thank you Eagle Boys Pizza for making pizzas that actually taste like pizzas! 
The Brownie Bites managed to satisfy our sweet tooth immensely!

A much anticipated visit to a much hyped pizza counter which turned out to be disastrous. Read on to find out why...
Ambience is cool. Food is good but nothing exception as most of the reviews suggest and service sucks. There are more than enough ppl to manage the place but I don't know what's wrong with them!! They made a number of blunders.

1. The AC was not on and hence the place was very very stuffy. I had to ask for it.

2. We ordered soft drinks with Aussie's favorite chicken pizza which they forgot to serve. I had to remind them of it. By the time they served it we had already completed eating our pizza.Let me clarify there were no other guests present at that time so I can't imagine how they could possibly have forgotten the order!

3. We ordered triple chocolate sweetza as dessert but again I had to remind them of serving it.

4. I had to ask repeatedly for drinking water. Dirty plates were not removed before serving the next dish.

5. Once I had placed my order and paid I was told the bill would be given at the time of serving the food however it wasn't. Last but not the least service is very very slow.

Only good thing was food. Aussie's favorite chicken pizza tasted good with generous amount of cheese and a fluffy yet a firm base,only disappointment was it had way too less chicken. Non veg penne pasta in red sauce was bland.Star of the show was sweetza. Anyone giving this place a try must have it.All in all a one time try place unlike the ratings!! These days I find Zomato rating so misleading :(

WRONG ORDER
We ordered the chicken supreme 10"  thin crust with extra cheese  and a veg supreme 10"   big cheese crust , but they totally messed up our order and gave us a deep dish veg supreme and a chicken supreme with the big cheese crust.
TIME
It took them 40 minutes to serve the pizza.
STAFF
After the wrong order they gave us,when we ordered the "sweetzaa" for dessert,no plates were given and when we asked them to serve it an unpleasant reaction came from the staff. 
TASTE
The chicken supreme was good, I found the veg supreme a little bland and the sweetzaa was oversweet.
AMBIENCE
The ambience was casual with a glass front.
OVERALL 
The staff was confused,and they hesitate on providing the receipt, they never gave me the receipt for the first order and on asking they just provided the second order's receipt.

We ordered two combos thus 8 pizzas which were sufficient for 7 people - that's the best part 
And these tasty delicious pizzas are quite affordable as well specially for college people! 
The staff was decent as well as they arranged for a suitable place for a group of 7 when we requested ! 

All in all I already quite admired Eagle Boys Pizza 
After this day I do  more!

I ordered a pizza and a garlic bread for home delivery, I was expecting the pizza to be good as told by my friends but was disappointed as the pizza and the garlic bread was not at all warm. Taking a bite of the garlic bread was an effort of a lifetime and the pizza was tasteless and I had to throw both of them away. Pathetic home delivery and also the delivery boy didnt have change.

Recently dropped in at EBP to satiate my craving for some pizzas during a weekend lunch. Out of the mouth watering menu, we settled for the cheesy garlic breads with chicken keema, the peri peri paneer rolls, chicken extravaganza pizza and the garlic prawn pizza. We also ordered a couple of servings of the green apple mojito and passion fruit mojito to wash all that cheese and meat down.

While everything tasted great, three things that lured me into several more bites were the peri peri paneer roll, the chicken extravaganza pizza and the star of the show, the Garlic prawn pizza.

Keeping the Valentine's week in mind EBP served the pizzas in a heart shape, which was cute and in sync with the week at the same time.

The paneer in the piri piri roll was soft and extremely fresh. While the flavor of the piri piri seasoning surfaced brilliantly, it was by no means over powering. On the other hand the cheese burst garlic prawn pizza adorned with chillies and onions was served with couple of lime wedges. If you are by chance confused with the accompaniment of lime wedges with an extremely cheesy pizza, don't be. It was the perfect accompaniment to the pizza, cutting back on the richness, from all that cheese.

Once we had devoured all of this, we went onto ordering the chocolate pizza and enjoyed that every bit as well.

Big shoutout for this amazing australian pizzeria brand! Located near ruby hospital one just cannot miss the attractive facade of this place. Loved the vibrant colored interiors.

I ordered for a green apple mojito which was just the right kind of drink to start. The food item which really created an indelible impression on my mind were garlic bread with chicken keema , garlic prawn pizza and the chicken extravaganza. The food gentally reminded us about the valentines week as all the pizzas were heart shaped.

Coming to the taste garlic bread was fabulous. The garlic prawn pizza was the best due to its sheer topping and the filling of gooey cheese burst mix. Chicken extravaganza was lipsmacking too. What i loved about this pizzeria was the versatility they have. From thin crust to cheese burst they covered it all. To conclude i called for chocolate sweetza which just lived up to its name. This one is for all having a sweet tooth.

Service is pretty quick and the service personnel are courteous. Overall a lovely experience.Highly recommended for pizza lovers. Kudos team Eagle boys pizza.üòçüëåüëç

I always like Eagle Boys Pizza more than Domino's or Pizza Hut!
Ambiance is very good.
Staffs are very courteous and service is swift.
Tried the Green Apple Mojito this time which was good. The Fruit Passion wasn't upto the mark, though.
My favourite was the Paneer Roll.
Loved the Chicken Extravaganza and Garlic Prawn Pizza.
For a sweet ending the Tripple Chocolate Sweetza was great!
Always coming back! Keep up the good work EBP!

If you‚Äôre an ardent pizza lover and tired of the regular pizza chains in this city, then Eagle Boys Pizza should be in the list of your next pizza destination. Came here with a few friends of mine today afternoon and the experience was pretty awesome. Ambience wise, the place had a very basic d√©cor ‚Äì a theme of black, white and pink colours, minimalistic furniture, neat and clean. We had the following items ‚Äì¬†
Drinks ‚Äì
Green Apple Mojito ‚Äì This drink was really awesome. It had a distinct flavour of green apple, very refreshing, very good.
Pizzas ‚Äì¬†
Aussie‚Äôs Favourite Veg Pizza ‚Äì I am generally not into veg pizzas, but this was great. Filled with American Corn, Onion, Capsicum and lots of cheese, this one was mindblowing.
Chicken Extravaganza ‚Äì Loaded with chicken and cheese, I loved this one absolutely. A must have at Eagle Boys.
Garlic Prawn Pizza (Big Cheese) ‚Äì Prawns and Pizza ‚Äì it is definitely a classic combo. The prawns in it were really fresh. It was more like a cheese burst pizza, liked it very much.
Sides ‚Äì¬†
Peri Peri Paneer Roll ‚Äì Goodness! The paneer inside this was so soft that it literally melted inside. Recommended. You should have it!
Garlic Bread Chicken Keema ‚Äì The round shaped garlic bread loaded with cheese on top and chicken keema playing hide and seek with it. Loved the combination of spicy keema and cheese. It was great.
Desserts ‚Äì¬†
Triple Chocolate Sweetza ‚Äì I am a bit orthodox about desserts and generally don‚Äôt like chocolate momo or chocolate pizzas. In this case, this was the latter one. A bit on the sweeter note, the chocolate sauce was warm and gooey with dark and white chocolate chips, half melted or not. It‚Äôs okay to have it if you really crave something sweet to try, otherwise, don‚Äôt.¬†
Overall experience was good. Service was prompt and courteous. This week, they are baking only heart shaped pizzas to celebrate love and that‚Äôs what defines a pizza! The pizzas are not the typical Italian thin crust ones, nor too thick, it‚Äôs okayish. Toppings and cheese used are of good quality and I would recommend you to give it a shot to experience an Australian genre of pizza. Happy Dining! ÔÅä

It's valentine's week and you'll surely get the vibes once you get to taste the platters!
Drop in to fathom what I actually mean üòâ
Well, I'm no pizza lover yet I am charmed by their lipsmacking innovative pizzas!
Too many positive reviews compelled me to try out this place for luncheon and it was tasteful indeed.
We had ordered :
‚úÖGreen apple & Passion fruit (drinks) - Both were refreshing though I liked Green apple more. It has a subtle taste and turns you on with it's flavour.
‚úÖ(Side dishes) Peri peri paneer roll - It was richly stuffed with paneer blocks which was delicious. Beautifully seasoned with salt and oregano.
‚úÖGarlic bread chicken keema - It just stole my heart! Being a chicken lover I couldn't just afford to miss this one. Perfectly baked, nourished & served with Mayo dip.
‚úÖ (Main course) Aussies veg pizza has a thin crust and melts into your mouth to make you more hungry. You simply cannot wait for your turn to savour the next item ;)
‚úÖ Chicken extravaganza- The name is so apt. It's so filling and carefully nourished with loads n loads of chicken pieces. It's creamy gooey and perfect!
‚úÖGarlic prawn pizza - now this one's my FAVOURITE!
It's smooth and creamy.. Absolutely desirable for the prawn treats n the slightest hint of lime in it!
Just loved this one üòá
Last but not the least, arrived the‚úÖ Triple choco sweetza & Brownie - they were like lust on a plate!!!
Tasted better when shared with friends :)
Highly recommended üëçüëç

Tired of Domino's and Pizza Hut? Then please do visit this place atleast once. I bet you will fall in love with the pizzas. The super quality of the cheese and toppings. The taste is someway a bit different than what we generally get in Domino's and all. Try to go for a thick crust and extra cheesy pizzas. You will surely love it here. Moreover here you will get a variety of deserts. I tried one which was full of dark chocolate sauce and small chocolate chips beautifully topped over a thin crust. 
There are offers almost everyday. To avail the best, go for a Wednesday plan. 
Price is all fine and good here . Within 800 you will get 2 large cheesy pizzas.

I'm no Pizza expert nor much of a lover, for a hardcore Mughlai layman, the pizzas were very good. The place is located at an odd crossing to it's disadvantage, however the good quality and interesting daily discounts add up to its benefits. The sweetza is almost an exclusive, so try.

I have been here many times. You can get the best pizza in the city here. Once, they even served us a free pizza to cover for their mistake in taking orders.
The negative point is that they don't have a good network for pizza delivery. Sometimes, this can piss you off too.

Finally tried the pizzas after waiting for a year! They have a major delivery problem, which restricts them to very few places. Anyway tried both the crusts- thin and deep dish with tandoori chicken and chicken keema. Their bread quality is definitely much better than dominos. Personally I preferred the chicken keema and deep dish. Would order that again. Tried chicken nuggets which were also good! 
Keep it up! Would love it if they can deliver to more places in kolkata!

Updated Review : 23rd January 2017, Monday.

Just the day after I posted my experience with the pizzas, the owner of Eagle Boys Pizza called me up and very politely asked me if I could allow them to send me a complementary Garlic Prawn Pizza because I did not like it much when I first ordered it.

I am very happy with the fact that he has taken the pain to go through my review because this is something very rare. People nowadays don't seem to take criticism sportingly but Mr.Owner was very calm and humble.

I was sent a complementary Prawn Garlic Pizza today evening and I am super happy that they tried to rectify all the negatives I mentioned.
It had a thin crust this time with cheese oozing out and the spice quota was right on spot. The pizza was delicious, to say the least and everyone loved it. I would recommend everyone to go for the 'THINCRUST' Garlic Prawn Pizza with Extra Cheese (4.25/5). It's worth a try.:)

Thank you Eagle Boys! It's a great initiative to look into all the reviews and rectify the mistakes.
Way to go! Cheers!
Enjoyed the pizza thoroughly.

_______________________________________________________Finally, after many failed attempts of trying to order from Eagle Boys, on Friday night I was determined to have pizzas from this place.

I chose to order online and it was actually pretty easy. Just took a few minuted and everything was sorted. The pizzas reached our house in 50 minutes which was aptly on time!
The only complaint I have is that they don't have an option to choose the bases while ordering online. So, after ordering I called them up and specifically asked them for thin crust pizzas but sadly, we received the pizzas with normal crusts.

Coming to what we ordered :

1) Chicken Keema Pizza 13" @Rs.675.00 (3.75/5) : The pizza was HUGE - larger than any normal 13" pizza. The toppings included curried Keema (Really good), red onions, jalape√±os and ofcourse cheese! Keema pizza happens to be one of their signature dishes and was really good.

2) Garlic Prawn Pizza 13" @Rs.730.00 (2.5/5) : I don't know what went wrong with this one because the flavours did not just come together properly. The concept was new but the aroma was something no one liked. Even my hardcore fish-loving father was not happy with it. The idea of combining lemony flavour with cheese is kind of bizzare and it did not work out for me. Also, the coriander was kind of overpowering to the tastebuds!

The total check was Rs.1349.00 (Rs.62.94 Tax and Rs.162.98 Vat) after a discount of 20% (for ordering online via zomato for the first time).

Hoping to have a better experience next time!

Reviewing the food first-

1. Aussie pizza with onion, capsicum, pineapple, corn and garlic 7 inches- The pineapple added a sweetness and oomph. We ordered for extra cheese but the quantity of cheese did not justify the "extra" we paid for. Nevertheless, very appetising. 

2. Keema Garlic Bread- Spicy Indian Style Keema stuffed into bread and topped with cheese and garlic.  It was too spicy to eat comfortably and too delicious to stop eating. They add a lot of chopped chillies in this one. 

Two of us were too stuffed after this to try the desert.  Will go back again, the moderate ambiance and offbeat location notwithstanding.

Visited this place yesterday afternoon with 5 other friends. The ambience was fine. We had heard that on Wednesdays this pizzeria has a 'buy one get one' offer on medium and large pizzas.
So we ordered chicken peri peri and opted for chicken tandoori as the free one. We also ordered triple chocolate sweetza considering that this is the only pizzeria offering chocolate pizzas at such low price!
We took deep dish crust. The pizzas were crispy and delicious. Earlier I had thought if a pizza has red paprika it has to be too tangy but here it had just the right quantity of paprika. I had liked chicken peri peri more. Now coming to the sweetza, it had mixed reviews...some of my friends liked it which includes me and others didn't quite like it. The crust was bit hard but otherwise it was fine...though it 'looked' more delicious!üòã 
The service was good. Our bill amounted to ‚Çπ650 inclusive of taxes.Tax was charged at the usual rate 20.59% (VAT   Service Tax). We look forward to visiting this place again... oh yes, on another Wednesday! üòú 
PS- I do hope that the pizzas are cut into equal slices because that created a bit of problem. üòÜ

Visited this place yesterday afternoon. We were a boisterous gang of six people.Tried their Peri Peri Chicken Pizza,Tandoori Chicken Pizza and Triple Chocolate Sweetzza.Both the pizzas were great and loaded with cheese..with the Peri Peri one being slightly tangy! But I liked the Tandoori chicken one more though.The sweetzza was again delicious..but the taste is like Nutella had with bread..nothing new.It can easily be shared among four people.Ambience was drab..nothing special. Service was decent.Prices are reasonable and they have a fantastic buy1get1 free offer on 10" & 13" pizzas on every Wednesday!!

After months of speculations we friends decided to visit this place. The contrasting colours of their logo have attracted my attention long ago. So now I will start with the detailed review,

Location: obviously not at all hard to find because is close to ruby and just off bypass. But still I consider the location to be a little off route for most of the commuters . Then again for a foodie it doesn't matter. 

Ambiance: as I have mentioned the contrasting pink and black is a lovely combination. The interior is not much different from any other pizza stores. The place has comfortable sitting arrangements for all size of groups. 

Service : it wasn't a pleasant one for us as the woman on the counter was very confused about their own menu and what they serve for what price( though everything was clearly mentioned on menu ). But the store manager intervening made everything smooth. 
But I hope, she is a new recruit and will learn eventually. 

Food : well now let's start with the best part. I will say this is one of the best pizza shops in town. Period. 
We were a group of 4 people, we had ordered their basic combo of 4 non veg pizzas, we took chilli onion garlic breads and for dessert their famous sweetzza. 

Pizza : loveliest till date. We took dip dish ones, if you want you can opt for thin crust without any extra charge. The breads were soft. It had liquid cheese topped with generous mozzarella. The toppings were really flavourful and distinct and were in abundance. 

The garlic breads were decent.

The sweetzza was a show stealer. Crispy baked base, topped with gooeyi browny, chocolate sauce and choco chips. It's a must recommendation. 

I am really looking forward for more visits to try out their rest of menu.

Have been to this place with my friend. Pizzas serve @ Eagle Boyz are simply delicious. When I compare the taste/quality/ambiance/price with any other famous brands, Eagle Boyz Pizza is the best. Tried a unique pizza the Triple Chocolate Sweetzza, filled with melted chocolates. ¬†We also had Chicken Mexicana pizza and it was very soft, juicy and spicy. The interior was nice and the price tag is also good. I would strongly recommend if someone wants to have a tasty pizza.

This pizza outlet is near Ruby which offers one of the best pizzas in town giving tough competition to the leading pizza outlets. I love the different offers they provide on every day of the week specially the Wednesday one. We took a combo of four pizzas and each one was amazing, left me licking my fingers. The dessert is also very good and beautifully presented. The ambience is like any ordinary food joint. The service is very good but the staff and the pizzas never keep you waiting for long. The reasonable prices are its greatest attraction. I will give full marks to the presentation, price and the service. The ambience needs to look more presentable. But who looks for other things when you are busy with your cheesy pizza.

So we were craving to go to this place for quite some time and ultimately did go to have a late lunch. this is on the e m bypass opposite jalasaghar or just a few steps away from a hotel named sheldon. Ambiance is fine nothing much to comment about. The staff was courteous as expected. Well the best part is the foooooddddd! Each and every item made us dig for more. The cheese onion garlic bread, potato wedges, veg penne(this was ok ok), chicken peri peri scroll, pizzas _chicken mexicana(yummiest), chicken supreme and garlic prawn were all served at its best. I liked the pizza base though. Go on wednesdays for a 1 to 1 free pizza....all days have offers. So jst go n grab your pizza for prices that dont pinch!

Located off the EM Bypass, Eagle Boys Pizza is definitely a pizza lover's paradise‚ù§ 

The interior of this place is done up nicely, a cozy warm environment. 

Coming to food; they have a very impressive menu serving a wide range of pizzas as well as few different types of dishes which one doesn't generally comes across in other pizza joints of the city. 

The Peri Peri Chicken cheese burst pizza was utterly delicious! ‚ù§ The base was soft with scullent pieces of chicken and cheese oozing out with each bite! üòç

All items are rightly priced. Staffs are well behaved. üòä

If only words could express how much in love I am with this place. Located near Ruby Hospital off E.M.Bypass just on the main road, this place had been in my bucket list ever since it opened its doors. The rave reviews intensified my desire to try out their pizzas and that's when one fine Wednesday afternoon, when this place offers BOGO on pizzas, I decided to drag my friends along to EBP.
Being a vegetarian, I'll review the pizza which I tried : The Peri Peri Paneer with Big Cheese Burst. That pizza had cheese oozing out of its perfectly soft crust and the toppings made it so delicious that I forgot about my basic dining etiquettes while having it. It is a MUST have and deserves a 5/5.
My friends tried the Chicken Mexicana with Cheesy Blast crust and these were their exact words : "For the first time ever, we are feeling high on pizzas". This being said, it comes nowhere close to the pizzas offered by the mainstream pizza outlets in this city.

On my second visit to EBP, I ordered a Tandoori Paneer pizza with Big Cheese Crust upon which I was offered a Cheesy Garlic Scroll as complimentary dish. The scroll had enough moisture to taste good even after 30 mins of being served. Deserves a 4/5. The Tandoori Paneer pizza again was really good but did not match the standards set by the Peri Peri Paneer. People who have not tried the Peri Peri one are definitely going to love Tandoori Paneer. 4/5 again.

Going to EBP and not trying its Sweetza at least once is a sin. It is overloaded with chocolates and its base is really crispy. However, once your satisfaction level has reached its saturation point after trying the amazing pizzas, the Sweetza will seem pretty ordinary. Will rate it 3.5/5.

Coming to the staff, I really love them. They are really hospitable. Waiting to visit this place for the third time to try out new pizzas.

To be very frank this restaurant is not so special after all. They claimed to be the real pizza maker but they dont have any speciality in that section rather i'll say there are some restaurant which offer much tastier pizzas. Besides if u ordered here from online you will get the shitty one. The packaging is too poor that it will get cold in a 15 min delivery  distance. Over all not so special rather as usual.

Been here to taste there delicious pizzas, desserts and side dishes. It was a bloggers Meetup Organised by EBP and hosted by foodzpah. 
Eagle Boys Pizza was an 30 yours old Australia based brand deals in pizzas. It has over 200 outlets in Australia and some outlets in major cities of India also. Their only outlet in kolkata was at VIP main road near Ruby Hospital. It has a capacity of 35 - 40 people's seats. White and pink themed outlet looking teeny and cool. 
Ambience was very impressive and so as hospitality. They take care of their customers very well. Service was in time, staff was friendly and helpful, presentation was really good and price was totally reasonable.
Let's move on to the tasting department by starting with drink we tried.
* Mojito - Classic Virgin Mojito made with Mint and lemon juice syrup. It was soda based and tastes very good. Fizzy, refreshing and delicious.
We tried couple of snacks with drink.
* Peri Peri Potato Widget - Crispy sliced potato deep fried and comes with spread Peri Peri masala. Very less oily, spicy, crispy and tastes good.
* Cheesy Peri Peri Scroll - Baked Scroll filled with Mozzarella cheese, jalape√±o, corn and Peri Peri seasoning. It was so cheesy and tastes amazing with spiciness of Peri Peri.

Made with the toppings of pineapple, corn, onion, capsicum and fresh Garlic. Mozzarella cheese coated and mayo & cream filled cheese brust Pizza. Loved it. Recommended.
We ended our loving lunch with this mouth watering delicious desserts.
* Triple Chocolate Sweetzza - semi hard homemade thin crust topped with liquid dark chocolate and white & brown chocolate buttons. We can call it chocolate Pizza also. Very chocolatey and delicious in taste.

Pizza is said to be the soul and elixir of a foodie. Irrespective of the foodie‚Äôs genre, the love for pizzas is equal among all. But we as Calcuttans have grown to fancy brands like Pizza Hut and Dominos‚Äô; in the process being deprived of quality and variety. Eagle Boys Pizza brings to you some never before tasted flavours and variations all the way from Australia.

Operating for nearly 30 years, EBP have over 200 outlets in Australia and is one of the largest pizza chain in the country. In its expansion phase, EBP have come to India and its only outlet in the city is near Ruby Hospital.

The main logo is clearly visible from afar, designed in an attractive teen-ish font. On the inside, the outlet holds a simple d√©cor with bright lighting. The colour combination for the walls revolves around pink and white, which are also the colours used in their brand logo. You‚Äôll also find some fine LED light work on the ceiling. The place has enough capacity to host about 30 souls at one go.

Over a year strong, Eagle Boys Pizza has already made a name for itself through its outstanding variety of pizzas. The thick crust pizzas here much better than the thin crust ones at some restaurants around the city.

Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!
                                          ...

Got home delivery from Eagle Boys yesterday. They took about 30 mins to deliver in Kasba, which is quite nearby Tagore Park. But the pizzas were warm and soft and tasted fine.
I had ordered the Garlic Prawn pizza and the Chicken feast with Big Cheese base!
Both were quite good...especially the Chicken one. It was full of the ingredients given, chunks of chicken...and the cheese base made it really good! 
Would like to try out some other variants next time.
At least this chain is better than the some of the other popular ones in the city.

The pizza lovers of Kolkata finally have their ultimate destination to enjoy lip smacking and new varieties of pizza. Located near VIP bus stand, this is an Australian fast food chain which has several outlets all over India. The decor is simple and fun. They have a very informative order status displayed on LCD screens. The seating arrangement is comfortable. I visited this place last week with a few friends and had an array of items.
¬†To start with, the mint mojito was very refreshing. The chicken keema garlic bread was generously topped with keema and the bread had a crunchy crust. The Peri peri potato wedges were tangy and spicy. They were crisp on the outside and soft inside. ¬†The twisted seekh kebab roll is a must try. ¬†The sheekh kebab is rolled inside a crusty bread. The garlic prawn pizza was the show stopper! The pizza was one of a kind, topped with succulent prawns and the lime and corriander added a new touch to it. It was extremely cheesy and wonderful! The Aussie's favourite veg pizza is a vegetarian's paradise; topped with pineapple and cheese, the crust was thin and crispy. Chicken chocolate sweetza is the EBP special chocolate pizza. It was generously glazed with chocolate sauce and choco chips. ¬†To end with, the walnut brownie with vanilla ice cream was a simple,but nice dessert. the brownie was freshly baked and steaming hot and went well with the chilled ice cream. It was a fun dining experience and EBP is definitely recommended.

Food-There were many items available in the menu and all were extremely tempting.We tried to try major portion of their menu and the items we liked the most were-

1:Mint Mojito-This drink was a classic lemonade mojito that comes with mint leaves.It was extremely refreshing and tasty.

2:Veg Superior Garlic Bread-They serve 4 portions of this dish.It was topped with semi-liquid cheese and some veggies and tastes good.

*20th December 2016*
A medium sized pizza restaurant and their items are slightly cheaper than the common known pizza suppliers in the city of joy. Ambiance is calm and quite soothing.

Review and Order
‚òÖMint Mojito(9.5/10): This drink is a wonder. In summer days, this will be your best friend, in winter it will last you throughout your food since its cold.

‚òÖVeg Superior Garlic Bread(8.5/10): 4 Big pieces covered in cheese with veggies and garlic essence. A good serve.
‚ú©Chicken Keema Garlic Bread(9/10): This is better than the veg one and has to be, I am 95% Non vegetarian.
‚ú©Spicy Cheesy Scroll(8/10): Looks like a bread but is a bit crunchy filled with veggies and cheesy. Good One!
‚òÖPeri Peri Potato Wedges(8.5/10): Medium thick crunchy potato wedges seasoned with spicy ingredients and tastes best with ketchup.
‚òÖTwisted Seekh Kebab Roll(10/10): Remarkable cooking and palatable rolls. Not too spicy neither plain.
Pizzas
‚òÖ‚ú©Garlic Prawn Pizza(10/10): If you love prawns, you should prefer this any day over the chicken ones(if you have a single option). Make it cheese burst for added taste. The best I've had till date.
‚ú©Chicken Keema Pizza(9/10): This is also a brilliant choice. Sorry, I don't have pics for this one.
‚òÖAussie's Favorite Veg Pizza(8/10): This was topped with pineapple and cheese. Make it thin crust and cheesy. Vegans will love it.
‚ú©Peri Peri Paneer Pizza(8.5/10): This is also a brilliant option if you're a vegan or on your beliefs. Remarkable veg option.

‚ÄªDesserts*
Triple Chocolate Sweetzza(9/10): Sweetness is the king when it comes to desserts and this one, with a crunchy base, topped with chocolate sauce, chocolate chips is a blessing to all the chocolate lovers.

Walnut Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream(9/10): This is also a brilliant dessert option and quite common too, except that the brownie is made of Walnut.

Don't mind my reviews for veg in any review if its low.

Many positive reviews allured me to try Eagle Boys Pizza. So, with obvious good expectations I ordered through Zomato. My box contained a 10 inch Cheezy Chicken Pizza, Spicy Cheesy Scroll and Twisted Sheekh Kebab Roll. There were no chilly flakes or pepper pouches with the pizza. So, I called them up and they apologized. They delivered chilly flakes and pepper. Good service indeed. Now coming to the food, to speak the truth, I liked none of the items. The worst was the Twisted Sheekh Kebab Roll. It was a total waste of money. So, not at all a satisfactory experience for me.

Visited this place with a friend of mine just a day back to grab some lunch. We thought of domino's but as we were passing by this joint, we gave a thought why not try something new. Wala!! ¬†We hopped in.

As per the ambiance, it's like a normal joint and the workers are so nice they Greet us with a smile. And I must say the service is quick. 


We order. 
For dink we had Mint Mojito and it's a okayish drink I must say. And coke.


Food..

Veg superior garlic bread 

*Chicken keema garlic bread 
*Peri peri potato wedges 
*Spicy cheesy scroll 
*Twisted seekh kebab roll 
*Garlic prawn pizza 
*Chicken keema Pizza 
*Peri peri paneer pizza

Both the garlic bread were good loaded with cheese and garlic flakes. And it tastes awesome.

Peri peri potato wedges, sliced potatoes in periperi spices. Crunchy! 

Twisted sheekh kebab roll- a meat roll wrapped in pastry sheets definity giving a crunch on the ¬†outside ¬†with a tender and juicy feeling inside. Loved this 


Garlic prawn pizza - 
This my friend is the ultimate BAD BOY.
Being a prawn lover, munching down a prawn pizza is like I have the entire galaxy in my hand. Everything about this pizza is just so perfect. The bread the saute shrimps on the top, the overloaded cheese just wow! Highly recommended. 


Chicken keema Pizza - chicken, cheese and jalapenos never goes wrong together. 
The base is good soft and definitely not chewy. 

I must say they have so many variety. I loved everything they served.


Even after having so many items I always make sure I have enough to room for desserts. A perfect ending for a meal. 


For dessert we had..

*Triple chocolate sweetzaa 
*Walnut brownie with vanilla ice cream 

Triple chocolate sweetzaa is more like a chocolate pizza except you get lots and lots of chocolate to drool over. The crust was a bit chewy but overall it was nice.

Walnut brownie with vanilla ice cream is always a classic. 

We had a talk with the owner and he's such a gentleman.
Definitely coming back to this place to taste some more pizzas. Cheers EBP !

Visited this place just yesterday, and definitely a thumbs up to the joint!
I thought this is an only pizza place, but I was wrong. They offer a variety of appetizers which I absolutely loved. 
It's located to the left of Ruby hospital towards bypass, easily spotted. 
A cozy interior. 
We ordered ; 
* Mint mojito : which was an okayish drink. It's the usual thing merely. 
* veg superior Garlic bread (mixed veg , mozzarella cheese) and Chicken keema garlic bread : I loved the cheesy indulgence in both the types. Loaded with the toppings and crisp garlicky flavor.
* Twisted sheek kebab roll : personally, this was a star of the meal. A classic meat roll wrapped in golden brown pastry sheet. Crisp and melting within. 
* Peri Peri potato wedges : classic wedge sliced potatoes, with a striking peri peri spicey taste. 
*  spicy cheesy scroll : vegan's will love it. 

Now for the pizzas, you will be amazed by the varieties they present! 
* Garlic Prawn Pizza : hand rolled crust loaded with fresh seasoned shrimps, garlic sprinkles, onions , capsicum and red paprika. Unlike other chewy hard breads, it was a soft base .. and I enjoyed it to the core.
* Chicken keema pizza : again a soft base loaded with chicken minced meat , jalapenos and cheese. A perfect balanced flavour.
* peri peri paneer pizza : with the paneer, corn, peri peri spice , this is sure to be a must eat for vegetarians. 
* Aussie's favourite veg pizza : more like a farmhouse pizza loaded with veggies and cheese. 

Few of th pizzas were filled with mayo within the crusts. But that wasn't quite what I favoured. Nevertheless, they make brilliant pizzas you gotta
Agree.

For desserts now, we got 
* walnut brownie with vanilla ice cream : a classic decent ending to a sumptuous meal. I loved the brownie which actually had ample walnut bits. 
*  Tripple chocolate sweetzza : as trending  this is a chocolate pizza. Topped with brownie batter, chocolate sauce and overdose of white and dark chocolate chips. Though the crust or base of the pizza here was pretty chewy and hard (don't know if they were trying to create a biscotti or not) 

You are sure to have a great pizza day at this place. The owner too was a gentleman to ask whether everything was okay,

Already giving tough competition to the Dominos and Pizza Hut, Eagle Boys Pizza near Tagore Park is making all the right noises among the foodies and pizza lovers!¬†

Went with a large group of friends for a Sunday lunch. Decor and seating arrangements are basic yet funky.¬†

We ordered :¬†

Chicken Keema Garlic Bread: Garlic Bread with keema toppings. When you bite the bread, the mayonnaise will ooze out which is a delight to the eyes and the tongue. Try this one.

Peri Peri Potato Wedges : If you want your favorite potato wedges with a twist, you'll love this perfectly spicy potato wedge preparation.

Twisted Sheekh Kebab Roll : Now, this one is something that you wouldn't want to miss. Strips of delicious Chicken sheekh rolls which will act as the perfect starter and increase your appetite five fold.

Mint Mojito : ¬†A drink as refreshing as it could be. Better than the soft drinks that you gulp while having pizzas.

Chicken Keema Pizza : Medium crust, adequate topping and the perfect amount of cheese....making it super yummy This one is a must-order!

Garlic Prawn Pizza : The Winner hands down. The best of the rest. You will keep wanting more of this amazing thing! Highly recommended!

Triple Chocolate Sweetzza : The only thing that I didn't like was the hard base, which was making it difficult to bite and chew. But the overdose of chocolate chips might make it up for you.

Walnut Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream : Brownie is freshly baked. Tasted good.

For Vegetarians, you'll love their Veg Superior Garlic Bread, Spicy Cheesy Scroll, Aussie's Favorite Veg Pizza and Peri Peri Paneer Pizza!

Service: Excellent!

Price: Reasonable.

Absolutely Recommended!

There are two things in life worth waiting for: A perfect 'Pizza' and a perfect 'Pizza'! Pizza is like entire food Pyramid! Sunday lunch had been the perfect for us.. me and some of my frnds made a walk in to this amazing place!
Eagle boys pizza had been very different positively.. after Domino's and Pizza Hut already taking over the masses!
This place was far better than above 2 pizzerias!
An internationally popular Australian Food Chain.. Eagle boys Pizza specializes in American Italian cuisines.. like pizza, pasta, and desserts.
Location: near Fortis Hospital Tagore Park.
They are located in other locations like Mumbai, Chennai, Pune etc.
The ambience was lively.. with good decor !
The service was quite prompt .. and hospitality was brilliant!
Coming to food.. we had Mint Mojito.. which was amazing with the mint flavour 
Garlic bread of two variants.. veg superior and chicken Keema.. both of them stood perfect!
Coming to pizza we had prawn pizza which was one of a kind.. I have had never tasted a pizza like that.. cheese burst .. hot.. soft bread.. it was a delight to have such a pizza!
Chicken Keema pizza was another show stealer.. very cheesy and awesome..
The moment I had triple chocolate sweetzza.. for the first time.. I was literally licking my fingers.. that was indeed the best dessert I've ever eaten! It was drizzled with chocolate sauce .. and topped with white and milk chocolate chips!

And last but not the least we had walnut brownie with Vanilla ice cream .. brownie was hot and soft .. this was a thumbs up dessert .. I've never eaten such an amazing dessert in any of the pizzerias!
This place is gonna give a tough competition to other pizza hubs in town!

Eagle Boys Pizza is already making much noise all around the town. Australian Brand Eagle Boys has come up with its franchises in Kolkata off EM Bypass, just a few minutes walk from the VIP Bazar Bus stop. They have been already running their bussiness in Mumbai, Chennai, Hydrabad, Pune and Coimbatore. They specialize in Pizza, Breads and Pasta.
                                                                ...

Have been meaning to check out this Aussie Pizzeria since a few months. Finally went for a grand lunch today with my friends. Interiors are done up very brightly in shades of pink,black and white which gives it a funky feeling. The restaurant is spacious with good seating arrangements. Service was quite prompt and we received our orders still hot. Now coming to the food. We had:-
Mint Mojito and Coke : Mojito was good with a distinct mint flavour.
Veg Superior Garlic Bread: Little round bread disks topped with a few veggies and oodles of cheese.
Chicken Keema Garlic Bread: New idea and totally awesome one. Spicy chicken Keema with onions,chillies and lots of cheese. Hardly anything can go wrong here anyway!
Peri Peri Potato Wedges: Crispy potato wedges sprinkled with peri peri seasoning. Lovely appetizer.
Twisted Sheekh Kebab Roll: Soft and Juicy chicken Sheekh Kebab wrapped in a crispy tortilla like bread, this dish was great. Both the concept and execution was brilliant.
Garlic Prawn Pizza: This was my first time trying a Prawn Pizza. Since m allergic to prawns,I decided to have it after taking out the prawn toppings. It was very cheesy and blended with the correct amount of spices. There was a distinct lemony flavour throughout,especially in the Mayonnaise coating underneath the pizza toppings.
Chicken Keema Pizza: Crispy base with a lot if Keema toppings. This vanished quickly.
Aussie's Favourite Veg Pizza: Pineapple, Corn and Capsicum toppings on this pizza made it a winner. This was quite tasty,in spite of being vegetarian üòõ
Peri Peri Paneer Pizza: Spicy veg pizza with lots of paneer toppings. A good option for vegetarians.
Triple Chocolate Sweetzza: The famous chocolate pizza of EBP! This was every bit as good as I thought it would be. A base layered with chocolate and grilled to make it crunchy. Drizzled with chocolate sauce and topped with white and milk chocolate chips and dusted with powdered sugar. This was amazing! It might be a bit too sweet for some people though.
Walnut Brownie with Vanilla Ice cream: The staple dessert in many restaurants. The texture of the brownie was good.
Had an awesome lunch. The pizzas here are definitely recommended. After today I can say EBP is a strong competitior of Domino's and Pizza Hut. Good luck to the team if EBP and thank you for the tasty pizzas and great service.

11. Triple Chocolate Sweetzza: 3rd highlight ! It's basically chocolate pizza . Due to grilling the chocolate tasted heaven accompanied by white and normal choco chips it adds a crunch . Definately every one should order this.
12. Walnut Brownie with Vanilla ice cream : vanila with brownie and lots of chocolate sauce. Heaven.

The food is awsomely gud. I would recommend this place strongly. Please go the three items which I found extraordinary.
1. Prawn pizza
2. Twisted sheek kabaab roll
3. Triple chocolate Sweetzza
Thank you for such a lovely lunch ! Definately will be visiting again .

This place has taken up the long lived pizzerias in the city to stroll! Perfectly baked pizza which variety of options in topings as well a bases.. The good thing is that they have offers on all days of the week which is really eye catchy and makes your experience here better! 
We ordered the Veggie lovers pizza in deep dish with extra cheese and Merry paneer pizza in deep dish. Veggie lovers pizza was just spectacular. Prices are really moderate in comparison to size and quality of the pizzas! 

Its a must try place with courteous staff!

Mostly I have been to the outlet of this shop which is present in the Cognizant Bantala Complex. Apart from that I have been to the bypass outlet of this once.
So I cant expect a good decor in the office premises. As far as the ambiance is concerned I would give a rating of 2.5 for the bypass outlet.¬†
Now coming to the pizza.. if you are searching for budget hangout place this you can put this in your list. They provide veg solo pizza for just rs 50 and non veg for 72 which is pocket friendly indeed. But I would say the food quality is not good,especially the bread. otherwise it is to some extent good. i would rate 3/5 for the food. So the overall rating is 3/5

I ordered Chicken Mexican and Xtrgavanza Pizza and on a serious tone any one going there should try it.. Its lip smacking deliciously yummy.. Though the amount of cheese was a bit less but the quantity of chicken topped on it made for the loss.. I tried pasta and cheesy scroll.. its ok types.. but pizza has a different flavour.. all together a good experience..

The first time I came to this place, I was an uninvited guest to a senior's treat. And the taste and prices have made me return to this place time and again. 

Pizzas have always been the truest form of love for many of us, and when they are all the way from Australia, you simply have no control over your stomach. Eagle Boys Pizza is a treat to not only the stomach, but to the nose and the eyes as well (even to the pocket :P) The place serves all kinds of Pizzas, with different offers going on throughout the week. You have the options of choosing either thin crust or the usual thick bread, with no additional costs! 

But the best part about the Pizzas? Most definitely the taste. I claim myself to be a strict non-vegetarian, but even then, I can't help but appreciate their veg delicacies as well. The cheesy layer on top, and all the toppings done to perfection is totally worth the price. My personal favourites would be the Aussie's Favourite Veg Pizza, Veggie Feast, Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Keema Pizza. 

I haven't tried out their newest Garlic Prawns Pizza, or the small bites, pasta but I do hope to try them out soon enough. Among the desserts, the Chocolate Vanilla Mousse however, is absolutely not recommended. 

Overall, this is the perfect place for hanging out with friends, when the budget is low, and you're bored of the other common names like Dominos and Pizza Hut. Totally recommended.

Eagle boys pizza located near Ruby Hospital is a Australian chain restaurant 
They offers great varieties of pizzazz with both thin crust and deep dish bases.
The veg mexican is good in taste but can't compare to the boss in the business The pizza hut and Dominos,still it has great taste to satisfy your taste buds.

Not that great an experience. Ordered a take away which they said will take 20 mins, but then I got the order after 1 hr. Not professional.
Coming to the food and restaurant, the interior is pretty cool, nice ambience. Ordered the Chicken Supreme Pizza which was pretty good. I didn't like the garlic bread that much as compared to other pizza outlets, but it wasn't bad. The price is in similar range to a Pizza Hut or Domino's. The variety of pizza available was pretty good looking at the menu, hopefully will try more soon and change my rating into something higher.

They say, pizzas speak louder than words. And, if that pizza is all the way from Australia, then the things it says to your tummy and your heart are indelible. When I received a surprise invite from Kolkata‚Äôs finest group of food bloggers, Panch Phoron, I didn‚Äôt realize what to expect ‚Äì from them, or from the newest kid (read pizza parlour) in the block, i.e. Eagle Boys Pizza, despite having ordered in a thin crust Zesty Chicken pizza from this outlet once before. and been sort of impressed by what they delivered. Even as I stepped into the cute pizzeria, full of excitement, I had no idea that I would make friends with people who are as unique as the pizzas we bonded over.

First thing that I would like to say - KUDOS to the Logo Design ! Brilliant !

Spotted Eagle Boys while crossing the By Pass a couple of times. Wanted to try it out of course since I guess it's a third or fourth outlet after Pizza Hut and Dominoes to be solely dedicated to Pizzas. Plus, Australian. :)

So, the other day, my brother ordered for a veg something pizza from Eagle's. I found the taste extremely similar to that of Pizza Hut's. But it wasn't bad. It was decent enough. Wouldn't say REALLY good. But decent enough to be ordered for the 2nd or 3rd time.

But trust me, after a few months, could feel the buttery, oily liquid on the cheese and inside the bread sticking to my throat. After this particular experience being repeated a couple of times, not really keen on visiting the outlet neither ordering from here.

My brother from Australia had visited me a couple of months back. Was super excited on seeing an Eagle Boy's here. But was highly disappointed with the taste too cause it's no where similar to the originals plus very oily.

Word of Advice - Try making it less oily and more similar to the ones from Australia.

Went there remembering the spicy pizza I had at Pune from Eagle Boys. But, since my friend accompanying me was neither a meat eater, nor could take even the least bit of spicy, we ordered the simplest of the veg pizzas on the menu, and that's why I was not too keen on submitting a review right away...but remembering how much she enjoyed the pizza, I think I would settle to a 4‚≠ê for these guys now. Will update (probably with more stars, with my spicy non-veg experience)

The most interesting part of Eagle Boys Pizza outlet is the lighting. Pizza's are nice and full of cheese. Apart from these, there are a few reasons which might discourage you from going there. The pizza takes 40 Mins to be served which almost kills our hunger. The waiting time is too much and unbearable at times due to the continuous smell of the pizzas around you. The Staff are very slow but courteous. A good place to visit if you have a lot of time in hand.

Now coming to food: we ordered a Chicken extravaganza chef's choice pizza and a cheesy garlic roll. The pizza was good, but I have had better. And the cheesy garlic roll was okay, but I would have loved it if it was cheesier. :3

If you're bored of having the same old dominos and Pizza Hut then this place is a huge recommendation to all pizza maniacs out there. Probably the most underrated pizza place in the town, this outlet is located very near to the Ruby hospital. They have a promising menu. We ordered the Spicy chicken and chicken seekh with the Big cheese base. The spicy chicken pizza was actually very spicy and really liked it.  The Chicken Seekh had huge chunks of chicken on it. Both pizzas were genuinely fantastic and the most finest part what we observed is the cost. Ambience seemed nice. Staff were courteous. Highly recommended. Cheers.  :)

This pizzeria is located near Ruby Hospital, about 5 mins walking from there and is visible from the main road. Ambience is nice. The staff is also very polite and friendly. Coming to the food, we ordered the Peri Peri Chicken 13" with thin crust and extra cheese. We also got ourselves two mint mojitos. The mojitis were very refreshing. The thin crust pizza just tasted amazing and left us wanting for more. So we ordered another small Cheesy Chicken. Just one thing to remember they don't do thin crust 7" pizzas. Definitely recommended.

The most underrated pizza place in town.
We ordered Zesty chicken, cheesy chunky and BBQ pizza. Along with that potato wedges and keema chicken garlic bread. The garlic bread was awesome. A must have. The potato wedges were not at all good. Cheesy chunky was truly cheesy and delicious, followed by BBQ and zesty, in that order. Overall, a must visit for pizza lovers.

..
My second review:

This time ordered through Swiggy. The pizzas were cold. Not a good experience. That's why I am rating it lower than before. Delivery was on time but the pizzas and garlic breads were cold and dry and tasted bad.

Please do take note.

If one is a pizza lover and bored of age old dominos and pizza hut or for that matter chicago pizza....then this place is a must try. After seeing the popularity on zomato i decided to visit this place on bypass near ruby hospital. Cleary visible from main road bit one has to take the service lane.

Coming to the pizza. We ordered for 2 varieties....their prawn pizza which was newly launched and chicken peri peri. Both pizzas were tasty with respect to taste....very flavourful. Base was thin and different. I enjoyed it tgouroughly. However the prawn topping on the pizza was too less. 

Also points deducted for poor service. On a saturday evening  ....restaurant was empty but they had lot of deliveries.....which was already running late. We had to wait for long. The water was served to us after 15 mins. Staff seemed to be less interested. The place is full of mosquitoes. All around. On the tables...water. The Air conditioner was switched on only when we requested. 
All staff were sitting in a room n talking too loudly....so there was no one when we asked for the bill. 

Overall tasty food but points deducted on service and ambience. Can improve a lot.

This is one is situated between ruby and VIP bazaar. It was empty when we visited the restaurant. But could hear that home delivery orders keep on coming. The chain claims to be the best pizza brand from Australia. The menu looks similar to the dominos menu sans the garlic bread options. The chicken bar b q pizza was damn delicious. The chicken mexicana was Fantastic with visible chunks of chicken and not processed chicken cubes. The cheese is yum. Also ordered veg Hawaiian which was also delicious. Brownies for dessert were also great. Definitely try again. Only the place is a little downer.

At Bosepukur on Astami my friends & me purchased chicken pizza at your counter. I am writing to let you know that members of my friends became seriously ill with food poisoning following the meal. I have been advised by my GP that the food poisoning almost certainly resulted from the food which had been eaten at your counter.Thank God few of us hadn't eat that pizza. This is because you people serve stale pizza. You are legally obliged to serve food which is fit for human consumption under the terms of the contract between restaurant and consumer.

A Pizzallacious and Sumptuous Affair at Eagle Boys Pizza..!

If you have got bored, by the likes of Dominos and Pizza Hut, then this is the place to be. Located very close to RUBY Bus Stand, and to that of Arsalan Restaurant at Tagore Park, this place serves up delicious and flavorful pizzas right to your table. Their bases are soft and with the use of fresh and flavorful ingredients, there would hardly be a soul who would not be impressed by the likes of them. It was quite thrilling for us to receive an invitation from a brand, which advertises itself it to be Australia‚Äôs Most Favorite Pizza. Much happy and content, we went over to their outlet, but little did we expect the plethora of surprises awaiting us. Following were the pizzas and other dishes which were served to us.

The pizza's are top notch in terms of quality of ingredients and flavour. Look out Dominos and Pizza hut - you got tough competition !

Pizza eating is very much part of our daily practice for the sole reason of being made real quick and having ¬†a full zesty preparation to enjoy satisfactory in this hustle bustle struggles of a routine life where we often get tired not wanting to cook or else desire to eat something very tasteful whether its a regular day or be it an occasion ,pizza is the choice for most. And that‚Äôs why most of us tend to always bookmark the pizza making restaurants app in the technological devices we own or else look forward to hop to the restaurants itself for a nice dine meal with family ,friends or sometimes alone as well as that also works as a joy in itself . One newest place i was invited to was of a renowned pizza making restaurant known as EAGLE BOYS PIZZA which brands itself being ‚ÄúAustralia‚Äôs most favourite pizza‚Äù is actually a very promising pizza restaurant giving the people of Kolkata a moreish taste of Australian pizzas in their own city . Now that is something different i am sure one would like to get their hands upon without a second thought. Yes you have eaten the best of pizzas you have always been claiming all this while before but you must explore a bit more and reach out to restaurants like these and not just stick to the popular ones to get in a fix again for your already taken decision and question yourself that have you really tried anything better like the pizzas EAGLE BOYS makes ¬†? Probably most will say yes they have eaten but my own experience says i guess a no from within as i believe pizzas should have a real crust texture and softness complimenting it all in all a factor either missing or not taken care of in most of the big named restaurants these days but interestingly at Eagle boys i found a difference of largely maintaining the quality,quantity ,presentation and keeping the crust and softness as well as holding an succulent taste and a pleasant aroma fully well balancing all of it positively .Eagle boys pizza is almost completing a year in the city of joy and it surely has given very much joy back in return to the people of Kolkata with their amazing make ,thanks to the owner Mr. Subhrabrata who has taken up the challenge of running a current single franchise of EAGLE BOYS in the city of Kolkata in the exact address of the restaurant which is¬†24,Sarada Pally, Block D, Near Tagore Park, Ruby Hospital Area, .Yes not forgetting there is a wonderful man playing host and taking care of the kitchen who is Mr. Anthony ¬†the Chef as well as the management head over here running the show super good as a result of the hospitality and staff being very pleasing and helpful in nature adding to the courteousness of this restaurant commendably .

This flatbread called pizza¬†with toppings of meats, vegetables, condiments and cheese, has been winning hearts since long, isn‚Äôt it people? Most of us have a dramatic inclination towards pizzas. Even I am a pizza lover! That is why when invited by the Eagle Boys‚Äô Pizza¬†for the food tasting session, I was in affirmation on the first-go. I am already excited for the festive season to come up and pizzas during this time sitting at the leisure of your home, or while out with your bunch of friends, are the best one can ask for.

‚ÄãPizza is one of the most loved versions of Italian cuisine. Be it breakfast, lunch or dinner, a pizza can satiate our hunger at any point of the day. Thus, with the increasing demand for pizzas, the number of pizza corners in the city is gradually increasing. On this contrary, pizza lovers can be divided into two sects ‚Äì ones who prefer thick crust pizza, available particularly in the outlets of the renowned brands Dominos and Pizza Hut, and the ones who prefer crispy thin crust pizza, available in most of the restaurant in Kolkata. Eagle Boys actually serves thick crust pizzas, but these are sure to impress the ones who prefer a thin crust, as in my case, due to the amazing softness of the bread they use and the delicious choice of toppings, all of which are sure to make you drool over it.

‚ÄòEagle Boys Pizza‚Äô has already made a good name in past one year in Kolkata since its inception in the city of joy. People by now are quite aware of the fact that this pizza making wizards are from Australia with headquarters in Queensland. It was founded nearly three decades ago in 1987. Then it started with a single pizza store in outback New South Wales by Tom Potter and today it is a over $8.3m organization. They really do serve amazing Italian-American cuisine, in particular pizzas and pastas. But yes, they are not the sole or biggest pizza making chain in Australia but they produce close to 12-13% pizzas consumed in the country and are truly loved over there. In India, they are fast spreading their wings mostly through franchises and they are giving some good competition to other big pizza delivery chains mainly because of their exemplary flavors and fantastic quality. In Kolkata, they are still not that big since they have got only one stand-alone outlet near Ruby Hospital area (at Sarada Pally) on the EM bypass.

The best pizza in town currently.
this is the only joint where I found veg pizza more tasty than non-veg pizza.
Ordered veg delight with extra cheese, Aussie's favorite chicken, triple chocolate sweetzaa and mint mozito.
Quality is such that this joint can give the brands like dominos and pizza hut, a run for their money.

A small pizza joint though, but makes delicious pizza. If you want a break from the normal dominos and pizza hut, and willing to try something tasty then this is the place. Yummilicious pizza! One large chicken mexicana was more than enough for two. Must try!

Though the pizza is good and unique in a sense but I doubt this is Australia's favorite pizza. I have few friends back in Australia and I have asked them if it is true :P Jokes apart! Pizza is really yummy and different from regular domino's or Pizza hut pizza and their service is too fast like other good pizza outlets. If you are looking for varieties of pizza than this is the place to hit.

These newcomers in Cal serve really tasty pizzas. I have ordered from them in many occasions and I must say I am satisfied with the quality. But since I always get it home delivered, the food comes in cold. Also they refuse to provide extra seasoning. Hope this can be worked upon.

Definitely worth a delivery shot . They are new and are doing better than dominos which had lost its shine. Almost similar in all of its menu with dominos, there is nothing innovative about it but I liked the quality of thier chicken supreme equivalent and found it better than thier rivals. My suggestion would be to keep up with the quality.

The pizza craving got us here on a Saturday evening. Though the road needs major repair leading to this outlet as the diversion from main Bypass has to be taken earlier to get on to service road. So our order was a take away of 4 small non-veg solo combo pizzas of chicken keema, BBQ chicken, spicy and chunky chicken. While the order took a good 25mins to be made, we binged on chicken peri-peri scroll which was nice concept served piping hot with cheese n paprika on chicken. The pizzas were good even when consumed at home. Interiors are nice and bright so is friendly staff. May visit again.

Eagle boys pizza a new pizza chain in town. Not located at a prime location but easily accessible from em bypass. Its has a nice innovative menu that can improve.

The pizza I tried was Veg Mexicana, it had nice topping's and was freshly baked, but the mexican sauce on the top tasted like tomato ketchup, sweet and rich tomato's.

The side dishes menu was innovative, I tried:

Cheesy garlic scroll: This is a scroll with mozzarella cheese filling, I found the scroll to be very cheesy. The garlic portion can be increased though.

Twisted panner rool: It looks awsome with a spiral covering over panner sticks. The spices were too good, and it somewhat tastes like famous Rajasthani snack 'panner pakoda'

For desert I choose tripple choclate sweetzza, which is a thin crust pizza with a choclate paste, topped with choclate sauce with white and dark choclate nuts on the top. I found some white sugar on the top which makes it sweeter which can be avoided.

The offers there are only for pizza's and of 10 or 13 inches though not specified in the menu.

The pet coke in the menu is only for take away amd delivery and not for dine in and one has to rely on fountain coke, which was more on water.

For the garlic bread fans: Though not shown In zomato menu but they have it in store, will order it next time i visit there.

Well, my dissatisfaction from various pizza parlours around the city got me here. And trust me guys. It was amazing... me and my friend visited here for the first time this evening.... the place was very beautiful and classy.. i loved the interior. Every day they have some interesting offers in here. Today we got hold of the order which says that any medium pizza (10") under a certain variety will be for just 199 bucks.. (extra tax applicable).. we ordered the Aussie's favorite pizza.. well, it was one of the finest pizza i have ever had.. i really liked the way how they serve it.. the pizza was very fresh and a treat to the mouth. Then we ordered a chocolate vanilla mousse. The mouse was too frozen so it was a  pain to cut it.. still it was tasty but not as good as the pizza. Well, an amazing place to have really great quality pizza at a good price which will not hurt your pocket... i wanted them to do delivery also. They do deliveries but within 4 km so that was a lil dishurtening for me. Nevertheless.. had an amazing experience... loved it!!!

After searching for pizza joints frantically to quench our love for pizzas, we arrived at Eagle Boys Pizza with a purpose on this Independence Day. One can easily spot this joint with its quirky billboard of white and pink few meters ahead on taking a left from the ruby crossing towards science city. We ordered a 13" chicken feast pizza,13" peri peri chicken pizza(thin crust),7" veg lovers pizza,7" margherita with extra mushroom toppings,peri peri potato wedges,spicy cheese roll,triple chocolate sweetzza,brownie bites,chocolate vanilla mousse and coke to gulp it all down. The pizzas were excellent with generous amount of toppings and chicken which is not usually what we are used to in kolkata barring a few really good restaurants. Besides,we had a rebate offered on the bill since it was a monday and thus prevented ourselves from burning big holes in our pockets. To sum it all up,good food,good service and even better rates. Highly recommended and a must try for all pizza lovers. Thank you !

Eagle Boys Pizza had been in my wishlist for long since I read a gastronomically provoking blog by Shahbaaz Zaman (Foodzpah). :) And only did I experience it last week when I was there at the vicinity due to some personal engagements. The outlet is located on EM Byepass Road in a few feets' distance from the new Arsalan, on the left side if one goes from Ruby stop to Science City. The outlet is distinctly visible from the road with its white and violet billboards asking foodies to drop by. Upon entering the place, I found the set up like a traditional pizza joint with clean interiors and eye-catching violet neons on the ceiling.

Coming to the food we ordered for a Chicken Extravaganza Pizza, Chicken Nuggets, Penne with White Sauce and Mint Mojito. The Pizza was truly extravagant with heart-warming portions of meat, cheese and every other toppings provided, and having it was truly a delight. The Chicken nuggets too was very nice with generous portions of chicken inside each nugget. The pasta tasted good however I personally felt lacking in the amount of white sauce required to make it yummy. The Mint Mojito again was okay however nothing extra-ordinary.

Last but not the least, speaking about the service, the guys over there managed it with a smile on each demands of us which made the journey even more memorable. However, in some cases during the interactions, we found them a bit low in professionalism which I am sure they would work on. The pocket pinch was very low compared to the portions they served. All in all, a good place and definitely recommended from my side if you are a pizza lover and tired of having it from the same chains over and over again.

Among the stellar congregation of giant pizza joints, those who have glorified their name and fame are predominantly Pizza hut and Dominos. Period.
Time flies....so is the mindset of people!!
In the bizarre of the sheer boredom of the aforesaid pizza giants, people started to look for option. Yes I do agree that even if you have already consumed all the variants of the options available after doing all sorts of permutations and combinations of cheese burst and thin crust breads, you would never say "NO" to a smoke exaggerating pizza slice however, I think just for the sake of "‡¶™‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶¨‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶§‡¶®" , this Eagle Boys got a scope to fly high.
Got a glimpse of their first outlet near Ruby more dew months back and got the chance to experience their delicacy yesterday as they have opened a stall at my Office cafetaria itself. I took one "Solo Pizza" which comes in a 7 inch size, one plate of garlic bread and a pasta in white sauce. All the items were genuinely fantastic..the most finest part what I observed is the cost. All the 3 items cost me just 162 rupees including tax and there was not a single pop-up of "compromise" in my mind after finishing them in few minutes. I think they are doing a great job in terms of delivering such excellent pizza and associated sidings. Definitely a must visit if you are a true pizza lover.

The first time my friends and I visited this place, we had to unfortunately leave due to repair work taking place. However, we visited again a week later. The ambience is amazing, although it's not at the best of locations. The food is simply great. We ordered two 10" pizzas; chicken keema and extravaganza, a side if potato wedges and soft drinks. Needless to say, our money was worth and we went home happy. 10/10 would recommend.

I went to eagle boys on a Sunday evening. The service lane leading to the joint was under maintenance, and there wasn't proper markers on the main road so we missed the entry to the service lane, and had to go around two very distant U-turns. 
On entering the joint- it smells very appealing. The place is well lit and looks comfortable. 
We ordered a 10" Veg Hottie, with mushrooms, and a BIG CHEESE crust; a cheesy garlic scroll; a coke (fountain).

The pizza was amazing. It was basically a thin crust pizza with a layer of cheese ( spread like ), followed by a tortilla on which the topping are top layer cheese (mozzarella etc) is put and baked. the pizza I'd not very think, even though there are these two layers. Full of flavour, fresh, not one bit oily- and the cheese was to die for. Has a slight sweetness but that complimented the spiciness of the pizza. It is like a cheese burst in a thin crust pizza. Very different and one of the best of the sorts I've eaten.

The cheesy garlic scrolls were also very good. Flavourful and sufficient amount of mozzarella. A good sider to order.

The reason I mentioned the coke is because they have a funny rule that you can't take a pet (500 ml) bottle for dine in, even though it was on the menu. The fountain coke lacked fizz.

The order was more than sufficient for two people. The bill was Rs. 611, and they don't run any offers on Sunday. So any other day would have been more economical.

Overall, I'm definitely coming here again.

Ambience: 6.5/10
Food: 8/10
Value for money: 8/10

Eagle boyz pizza is very easy to locate. Its just beside the em bypass. 
This place offers awesome pizzas which tastes yum. We had chicken mexicana medium size. We ordered for the big cheese which was the cherry on the cake. The pizza had good amount of the toppings. 
The ambience was nice. Staffs were polite. Definitely coming back to try out the other pizzas. :)

Wanted to have a Pizza but not from the regular dominos or pizza hut.  Found this joint at zomato in my area.  Ordered a 10" chicken keema pizza with big fat cheese as base.  The delivery was prompt.  Got a discount of 20%.  The taste was superb.  Loved it.  Just want to suggest that the quantity of chicken should be a little more.  Otherwise it wont be cost effective for customers.  Anyway loved the pizza,  will order again.  Definitely recommend.

This is one place pretty near to our place, and whenever we want to have a movie night in, this is a place from where we order pizza. We are a little bored of the regular chains that offer pizza. This is where this place comes to the rescue. ¬†However, we have to keep in mind that when you order pizza for home delivery it is difficult to get it piping hot (as in a dine in experience). But the flavours have never disappointed us.

We ordered the peri peri chicken pizza, and we asked for it to be made less spicy. They obliged us well and were were happy. We loved the taste and we will definitely be back for more! (I am, honestly fed up with Domino's). The interiors are well decorated with a stone pieces effect. I must mention that they have an offer everyday and yesterday being a Monday, we got a 30% off on our total bill.

Ordered a Peri Peri Pizza and Aussie's Favourite Chicken... Totally unimpressive. 
We were drawn by the excellent rating on zomato so decided to give it a try but alas our expectation fell flat. I do understand that by ordering at home u dont get that much a hot pizza, otherwise would have had u dined there BUT the crust was over baked like biscuits and the toppings lacked taste big time. I think they should rethink their pizza making process.  :(

We had ordered corn pizza, chicken keema pizza, cheesy garlic scroll and passion fruit mojitos and each of the items was worth the price amount. Besides the ambience is cozy with nice decor. The price is very reasonable and and I would say, cheaper than dominos but taste is way better than it, that's not what I'm saying, my taste bud is saying so...

This Restaurant is very near to my home. Finally tried a Aussie's favorite veg pizza. Awesome in test. Nicely crisp base.

The serving lady Ms Priya not only take order perfectly , but also serve nicely. She done her duty perfectly before, between and after the serve. She make the difference as she know how to take care of guest. 

As per her recommendations One Mojito name Man's drink was fantastic. Nice and comfortable ambience. Very quick and decent service. 

As there is no end of improvements so, out of 5 toppings (capsicum, onion, pineapple, corn, fresh Garlic) Garlic was missing or may be in very less quantity.

Eagle Boys Pizza is a newbie in the pizza community in Kolkata and many of the reviews promised that the place was a fresh change from the usual scene in town. With a Zomato voucher in my pocket, we decided to drop in for lunch one day. 

Our orders comprised of a Peri Peri Chicken Scroll, Chicken Feast medium-sized pizza with Big Cheese crust and a bottle of cold drink. 
The chicken scroll is almost like a small parcel without the flaky crust and has a nice cheesy filling with a spicy hit from the peri peri sauce and red chilli flakes. The quantity of the filling could have been more generous.

The chicken feast pizza is supposed to have three kinds of chicken with olives, mushroom and onion. I found the toppings a bit scantily spread and had much difficulty in spotting a mushroom piece. The taste was pretty normal. There was a lot of big cheese oozing out from the middle of the crust, which tasted a bit more milkier than expected. That was a letdown. 

Nothing was really extraordinary about Eagle Boys' Pizza. Even their prices are at par with the other pizza places in the city, thus failing once again to make this a unique catch. Their service however was quite professional, and the place is spacious and conveniently located near the VIP Bazaar stoppage. 
Overall, this Australian pizza chain can give us a much needed break from the domination of Domino's with some new flavors from their homeland and a couple of interesting sides and desserts.

What an amazing hang out zone with friends! Crave for some good pizza options, just opt this place instead of that regular dominos or pizza hut order! 
Order includes peri peri chicken, chicken mexicana, Aussies favourite, bbq chicken. Whether to name the thin crust or the cheesy blast, both r good in their own way! 
Wonder on wednesdays are the nicest offers among all.
Cheers eagle boys pizza!

And price was too high.. chicken popcorn tastes like frozen chicken popcorn which we can buy from any local food shops.... Which is also a discredit... Service and ambiance was average..

This Pizza joint is located just on the Left side of EM Bypass if you are coming from Ruby to Science City. Exact Stoppage - ¬†Tagore Park. I will suggest you my friends to have a go to this outlet or even try at home. You will just love it. It is better than any of the Pizzas ¬†available in and around you.¬†
Try Chicken Mexicana, Australian Chicken Pizza, Chicken Supreme......I assure you can feel the chicken pops in your month. It's not a counting pcs of chicken like other Pizzas ¬†do.
Also give ¬†a try at the Cheesy Peri Peri...............yumm

I have been eyeing this place since a long time on my way to office specially after going through the zomato reviews. I was basically bored with the familiar pizza chains. So finally yesterday on our way back home we four colleagues dropped into EBP.

The place is right on the EM bypass. The exterior as well the interior decor of the place is quite flamboyant yet not exorbitant.

Two of us ordered for Spicy Chicken and the other two ordered for Veggie feast. The food arrived within 10mins. The veg one looked more colourful as it contained mushrooms, jalapenos, red paprika, corn, capsicum, tomatoes and it is of Gourmet category. Spicy Chicken pizza is of Classic category and it contained Chicken, corn, red paprika.

After the first bite we could understand the reasons for all the accolades EBP has received within this short span of time. They really have mastered the art of pizza making .The base has the right texture. It was fluffy and soft unlike the crunchy version of its competitors. The cheese was generously added and it was of good quality. The chunks of chicken were soft and fresh. The pizzas were not overcooked so flavours of all the ingredients were retained. It is best to consume it slowly as every bite needs to enjoyed thoroughly.

The competitors now would surely have a tough time to lure customers who have already tasted the luscious pizzas of EBP.

One of the better places to have pizza. I had my pizza ordered through Zomato and the pizza was delivered on time. I stay at Santoshpur and I got my BBQ chicken pizza within 45mins. This is really commendable as my place is about 3-4kms away from the restaurant. Now coming to the pizza - the BBQ Chicken pizza tasted very nice with ample toppings. This was my first pizza from them. Hope to visit sometime soon and try other pizzas too.

Honestly , I find this place better than the other common pizza joints. I ordered the paneer thin crust pizza and it was actually really good. The crust was thin and crisp and the toppings were full of flavour. I also ordered their cheese garlic scroll and that too had this amazing smell and taste of garlic with every bite I took. The cheese they use is of very good quality and the crust is neither too dry not too oily. Good place. Would recommend it to everyone.

This is a popular and happening Australian pizza chain that has opened its doors in Kolkata for pizza enthusiasts. At one of their exclusive and extravagant campaigns in Australia they'd introduced a chocolate fudge mousse that'd received a Gold Medal at the "2010 Royal Queensland Food and Wine Show." The pizzeria in Kolkata is located close to Ruby Hospital and can be easily spotted from the road, thanks to the funky color scheme of their 'pink glow' logo designed to create a fun and upbeat feel for customers. Had their Peri Peri Paneer pizza for takeaway, topped with delicious cushiony chunks of peri paneer, red paprika, onions, capsicum, corn and sprinkled with peri peri spice mix. Apart from being boxed in an attractive black pizza-pictured box, the extremely fresh and hot pizza came with sachets of tomato ketchup, oregano seasoning and hot chili flakes. The name of the pizza in the menu is accompanied with two symbols of red chillies, but the pie is not at all that alarmingly hot or spicy enough to burn your tongue and throat or send steam issuing through your ears. The pizza is loaded with just the right amount of spiciness that actually doesn't mar its taste or makes the eater uncomfortable enough to reach for a glass of water. The chili flakes too arent actually 'hot' as they seem. The base is oh-so-soft and thinly crisp, with awesome meltingly gooey yet tight cheese smeared on the fluffy pizza bread. Freshly made, brimming with paneer nibbles, healthy ingredients and bursting with flavor, the pizza was a delight to gorge on and relish. üòä Eagle Boys Pizza dishing out mouthwatering classic and gourmet pizzas can surely give its major competitors Pizza Hut or Domino's a good run for their money. A du jour pizza speciality chain serving lip-smacking Australian indulgence to your plates!

Move over Domino's and Pizza Hut. There is a new big bad guy in town. Located near Arsalan on the EM bypass, this pizzeria is the latest inclusion in the exponentially growing pizza market in Kolkata.¬†

I have tried almost all their pizza offerings and without a doubt, they serve better pizzas than Domino's. The base is very smooth and tender, the size is appropriate, and the toppings are rich in taste. For an extravagant experience, do try their Extra Cheese option.¬†

The interiors are soothing and the furniture is very comfortable. Service is quick and the pricing won't burn a hole in your pockets. Highly recommended by me.

[UPDATED REVIEW]

My previous experience of ordering pizza from this place was not a very pleasant one. I had written a review accordingly, and on reading it the management made a great gesture. I got a call-back within a few hours, and they apologized to me for the inconvenience caused and promised the same order, free of cost. They were very polite and prompt to take action, hence the updated review. 
All 3 pizzas delivered this time were very good (Aussie's favourite veg with cheesy blast, veg extravaganza and chicken feast). They were delivered on time, and warm. The quality and quantity of the cheese and other ingredients were also good this time. All the toppings smelled and tasted fresh, unlike my previous experience. The crust was also soft and buttery. 
They took extra care this time so that their previous mistake did not recur. In fact, the delivery boy said he would wait until I open and check if all the pizzas were fine. 
This response from the management was overwhelming and I must say, these guys know how to do business. Very satisfied with both the service and the food this time. Made me change my mind, and now I'd definitely recorder. Thumbs up üëç

This was more of a spontaneous plan, although we had been eyeing Eagle Boys for long. Although it is located right off EM Bypass, it is easy to miss. And the road leading to it, is also not quite evident at the first glance. So if you are coming from Ruby, you need to take a left at the signal, just after crossing Arsalan. 
Anyway, the ambience is okay. The seats are comfy, much better than Dominoes.¬† The menu is probably a bit restrictive than Dominoes or Pizza Hut, but the fact that they don't charge extra for thin-crust is great. 
The one thing I liked about this outlet, was that they had a small TV, where each order was displayed with the time left, and the name of the customer. So no more worrying about your order number.
Coming to food, we ordered a Chicken Supreme, BBQ Chicken, and Cheesy Garlic Scroll.¬† The cheesy garlic scroll wasn't worth it. It was okay at best. The pizzas on the other hand were good. Obviously, not comparable to gourmet pizzas, but better than its other counterparts. 
The complaint I have though is regarding the oregano and the chilli flakes served. Both seemed to have lost their flavour.

Today we ordered from eagle boys pizza for our meal. We ordered via zomato application.we ordered zesty chicken and tandoori paneer pizza. After one and half hour we received it. Till then we were hungry so much we didn't bother to check we have received the correct order or not. After having the pizza we realize there was no chicken pizza what we have order instead of that we received onion pizza. After all this when we called to the outlet for the concern they asked us to send them the picture of it. We did it the same and again called to the outlet MR.ANIK who received the call was not talking to us properly. Instead of solving the issue he is saying "mill jaiga yaar apko " n all. it sounds that how much EAGLE BOYS PIZZA training the staffs. The name he provided to us I think its fake. 
After all this outlet provided one zesty chicken pizza. After this kind of experience I think I won't recommend anyone to eagle boy's.

I'm so glad that a place like this has opened in the city! Go try out this place, you'll never want to order from Dominos anymore. I found their pizzas just right on the thickness of crust, amount¬† of cheese and¬†with generous amounts of fresh toppings! Fresh is a word I'd emphasize here. On top of that its cheaper than the other so called popular pizza places! I've visited this outlet multiple times and would continue to do so! The staff are very courteous as well and they bring out your pizzas on time! My favourite is the Chicken Mexicana¬†.Go for the Big Cheese base, the extra 75 bucks are worth it!¬†The only downside is their location as the approach road is not fully constructed yet and the buses drop you off a tad too¬†far from the place, but I think that wouldn't be¬†a problem once the road is widened in a few years! :)

Had the most amazing pizza experience in a long time. An alternative to the regular Pizza Huts and Dominos we were a sceptical bunch when we reached Eagle Boys Pizza but we weren't disappointed. Rather we're planning on shifting our allegiance to this place even over Dominos. We ordered the Peri Peri Chicken medium sized pizza,Tandoori Chicken medium with big cheese,Nonveg Pizza Duets,Garlic Bread with mozzarella and brownie bites to end with. The Pizzas were heavenly. Literally dripping with cheese esp. the one with big cheese. The quality was impressive and I recommend all Pizza lovers to definitely try out this place.

Australia depicts a picture of mild sun,golden beaches,fun youngsters and music.Eagles Boys Pizza offers u a whole lot of it.The location can be a bit tricky considering the fact that the road adjacent to ut is under construction. 
However the pizzas made up for it.
We ordered Bar b q chicken non veg duet,tandoori chicken with extra cheese,pineapple n jalepeno veg duet and peri peri chicken pizza along with cheese scroll and brownie.The pizzas were too good with a fair amount of cheese and chicken. The big cheese was worth it with huge amount of molten cheese within it.
Craving for the next gastrocnomic experience.

Today I had my dinner at this restaurant. My dinner was on Zomato as they had been kind enough to offer me a 500 inr gift voucher. This pizza joint is located almost on the EM bypass near Ruby. However the road approaching this restaurant is under construction, and barely motorable. It was a pain to reach over there, but the journey was worth every penny. Taste is a matter of perspective, and according to me I just had the best pizza treat in this town. I ordered two non veg and 1 veg 10" pizzas with big cheese crust. The result was mouth melting cheese ecstasies. 
The ambience is good, and the seats are comfortable. One thing that needs a change is the knives supplied. Butter knives are not enough for cutting pizza pieces. They need to supply better knives, the ones that are used for steaks. 
Overall, a wonderful culinary experience. I would definitely visit this place again. Lastly, thanks to Zomato again!

Do you remember that advertisement of Barcardi ‚Äì ‚ÄòSipping in Barcardi Rum‚Äô? The golden beach, mild sunlight, sea waves, rapturous youngsters, music, fun and frolic it depicted? When I was young, somehow in my mind I always thought the beach to be an Australia beach (not sure why, maybe because it was the furthest my little mind could fathom). And while seeing the ad, I have day dreamed more than once, about sitting on those very beaches and ravishing an authentic Australian pizza; rather than the packaged drinking water that the ad depicted (well my little mind didn‚Äôt get the restüòâ ).Now in Kolkata‚Äôs sultry weather, scorching heat & lack of rain; this dream seems afar. But even in this cloudless sky, there is a silver lining; now Kolkata has AUTHENTIC AUSTRALIAN PIZZA. You can sit at your homes, turn on the air conditioner in full blast and enjoy the authentic flavors of Australia. Eagle Boys Pizza, Australia‚Äôs third largest pizza brand promises you that, and much, much more!

In the year 1987, Tom Potter, a businessman of Albury, New South Wales, opened up a pizza & fast food joint, in partnership with her mother Barbara Potter, named "Beagle Boys". Yes, that's what initially it was known to people, and the name was a kind of inspiration from the world famous Disney Beagle Boys. But after a few months of operation, it was renamed as " Eagle Boys".
And since then this popular fast food chain started its journey.
The company was handed over to NBC Capital in 2007, and the current operating CEO of the company is Nick Vincent(2015 onwards). And while highlighting the long journey of this popular chain, it should be mentioned that "Eagle Boys" extended its branches over India also, which includes the Kolkata outlets, currently operating in 2 places. One is at Sarada Pally on EM Bypass(Ruby hospital area), and another is at Bantala.
So far my experience at Sarada Pally outlet is concerned, the unique color theme with pink and black colors contrasting to each other is eye catching for sure, and a reason enough to draw footfall, generating an impulse to indulge in. The ambience is lively and full of energy vibes that leave you in a state of experiencing and enjoying every bit of your visit. So is decorated the interior d√©cor to fit in with the kind of ambience they offer.
The service persons are genuinely well trained and superb at their service. And yes, the franchise owner Mr. Chattaraj, is a person who deserve special mention. Despite of his busy schedule, he shelled out time to attend us to ascertain that we are enjoying our meal and gathering a delightful experience to carry back home. Also he enlightened us with the details of each and every dish served. A superb team of beautiful people I must say.
Coming to food, the starters, the pizzas and even the veg ones, each and every dish tasted yummilicious like anything. Being a meat person out and out, I was literally surprised to see that even veg pizzas can be that brilliant. And off course, the non veg ones were AMAZING.
Yeah, how can I forget to mention their ultimate showstopper dish. The special "Peri Peri Crown Pizza". My dear foodie friends out there, if you have not tasted it yet, go and grab your bite ASAP. Or else you will miss out on a beautiful taste for your taste bud.
But even after all the excellence, one shortcoming I would like to bring in to notice. There are several scopes of improvement in the dessert segment. The sweetza failed to meet the expectations, the way it is hyped. And options for dessert is very limited.
But otherwise a highly recommended place for a delicious and sumptuous lunch/dinner.

Thanks a lot to

Disclaimer: I am biased towards Pizza. 

It's not very often that I visit the same place twice within a very short span, but I visited EB twice in two consecutive days, which itself speaks volumes about how I liked it. The first visit was for a food tasting event, and the next day when thinking of a place to eat out at, I couldn't think of a name other than its. 

Their Aussies Favorite Pizza is to die for, with its sweet golden corn and tangy pineapple with thin capsicum slices adding the apt amount of spiciness. And make it in the big cheese base, and you surely have a killer combination. This was hands down my favourite. 

Their Crown Pizza, specially made for us, looked beautiful with pieces of meat nested inside the folds of the crown, topped with mayonnaise. 

They also offer a dessert pizza, the Triple Chocolate Sweetzza and though some may find it too chocolatey and too sweet, I personally loved this. A biscuity pizza base with thick chocolate sauce and white and dark chocolate chips can hardly ever go wrong for me. 

Would most definitely order in from them again. And also, I must mention, their service is very good indeed.

Having been fed commercial pizzas from the American chains, there's a fresh wind blowing to the taste of pizzas from this chain. One has a choice of four bases to choose from. The guys at the joint guide the dinner with the intent to let him/her enjoy one's pizza and not force sides which others tend to do. They read the diner well and deliver the best pizza. Hope they come up with more outlets! In the meantime, happy pizza-ing!

Ordered for delivery an hour back and I might as well have baked flour in my house and eaten. we ordered for the cheese paneer roll, garlic twist and a tandoor paneer pizza. Apart from the pizza, the two sides were just baked flour with no taste in them. The pizza was very average. Would not order again from here.

Honestly this is an outstanding pizza place and the prices are significantly lower as compared to Domino's. I personally believe Domino's makes slightly (SLIGHTLY) better pizzas but this place is still amazing especially when considering the Wednesday "buy one get one free" deal.
Overall,great pricing,great service and absolutely amazing and yummy pizzas.

PS:one tiny suggestion which is actually just a personal lust of mine that I'd like to offer is: consider introducing the choice of something like a LARGE size Cheese BURST crust(like actually cheese burst,not just extra cheese) for your pizzas.I realize that not even Domino's has introduced such a thing and it may be expensive as hell....but I'd pay VERY GOOD money for such a crust choice.I imagine others would too.Of course this is just a personal suggestion and regardless of whether something like that gets implemented Eagle Boys will always be somewhere where I order from frequently whenever I have my pizza cravings.üòç

Located a few mins away from the Arsalan (Ruby branch), this Australian chain of pizzeria was on my wish list for a long time.

We ordered:
A non veg duet combo( consisted of four 7" pizzas all with different toppings)
A margarita
A sweetza
A plate of penne in white sauce with chicken
And a coke and a thumbs up.

I loved all of their pizzas. The cheese tasted soo good and way better than domino's and pizza hut.

However, I didn't quite like the sweetza. It was basically a thin crust pizza topped with white and dark Choco chips, drizzled with chocolate sauce and dusted with powdered sugar. It was a bit dry and was quite not the dish I wanted to end my meal with.
So, I ordered the margarita and pasta after these and loved the taste.
Recommended!
            

Update:

I went there again and had a few other pizzas and stuff and I was blown away by one particular pizza : The garlic prawn pizza!

O my God, it was so cheesy and garlic-y and topped with generous amounts of shrimps. I just loved it.

Also Chicken Keema Pizza, Aussie's Favorite Veg Pizza, Twisted Seekh Kebab Roll were awesome!

Eagle Boys Pizza was our destination for lunch on Sunday! 7 of us met up and chose the Australian brand to satisfy our hunger pangs.

Mr. Chatterjee, the owner was kind enough to sit with us throughout and walk us through the menu and explain the pros of the place. They are quite popular on the Kolkata circuit and have already launched their second joint!

Coming to the delectable menu, the following were served to us:
1. Range of drinks¬†
2. Twisted Sheekh Kebab Roll
3. Cheesy garlic Scroll
4. Spicy Cheesy Scroll
5. Veg Mexicana - Amazing Thin Crust
6. Big Cheese - Aussie's Favorite
7. Chicken Extravanganza - Cheese Burst Crust
8. Peri Peri Pizza - ¬†Their House Special - specially crafted crown pizza (looked amazing!!)
9. Sweetzza - Triple Chocloate Sweetzza! Pizza bread laced with chocolate sauce and choco/vanilla chips.
10. Chocolate Mousse
11. Chocolate Brownie with chocolate sauce

The sweetzza needs to be eaten before it gets cold, else the crust turns hard. The sweetness quotient is a little on the higher side.
The staff was excellent!! Special mention for Anthony and Priya.

The best part, personalized parting gifts for everyone! :)

Thanks for the awesome time and happy piizzaa-ing!!!

A place which was shortlisted in my wish list for a long time.

Food- I ordered chicken seekh pizza and cheesy garlic scroll. Pizza was soft cheesy,great in taste. Garlic bread was also good.

Other- I ordered for home delivery.So can not talk about tge ambience. But the delivery was not good.They delivered after 20 min of delivery time.
Highly recommended place to eat.

I had the privilige to order from this place sometime back in April, and hats off to the guys back at Eagle boys. 
Briefly, the order consisted of a nonveg (7") and a veg (10") pizza and both of them where utterly delicious. 
The crust was crisp while the base of the pizza was soft (just as it should be!). The toppings just filled every inch of the pizza (hope Dominos beholds this part). Worth every penny you spend on it.
The service was good yet not amazing (via home delivery) but surely not a let down. One thing which is great that the pizza was hot but that also depends on the location of the customer so the service might not be similar.
In short, it serves amazing pizzas at amazing prices. *slow claps*

Do try it out and comment what are you craving for from here. 
Happy dining.

I tried out Eagle Boys Pizza today, but it was pretty disappointing. Seeing the 4.0 rating, I decided to try it. They delivered the pizza about 20-25 minutes after the said time. By the time it arrived, the crisp of the pizza had gone, and we had to chew ferociously through it. Thus I would recommend you this place only if you are within a walking distance from it.

The food was pretty good. No doubt that it was quite tasty and exactly as i expected. For the price, it was reasonable and did not burn a hole in the pocket. However, delivery was pathetic. I ordered at 8.30pm and the food was delivered by 10.20pm. I had to call thrice to find out what was going on. No calls from them to even say the delivery will be late and to apologise. No discount off the bill for late delivery unlike dominoes.

Ever since its inception i had my heart set upon this new pizza joint. Since there are not many pizza places which does delivery and has round about the same concept as Dominos, i was pretty excited. Located at a little distance away from ruby mor, this shop is easy to find. But i opted for home delivery using the zomato online order app.

I ordered a small chunky chicken pizza with mushroom, capsicum and corn addons. With the addons, the price was on the higher side. Now the good thing is the pizza arrived before the expected time, so I was happy. I found the bread to be softer than dominos, which I liked. The pizza didn't taste great, it was mediocre. There was hardly any mushroom(maybe 2 microscopic pieces) and the chunks of chicken didn't have any taste(literally no taste, I'm not exaggerating) . There were good quantity of capsicum, corn and chicken. Moreover they provided a lot of oregano, chilli flakes and ketchup.

I was probably expecting too much, after seeing amazing ratings/reviews on zomato. Hope they will improve. Wishing the team all the best for the future.

Went to this place with one of my friend, the location is little bit odd but for the pizza, its really awesome. The main thing I like about Eagle Boys Pizza is the base of the pizza, the bread is soft.. Far better than Dominos or Pizza Hut. Good ambience, clean, comfortable sofas. Really a good place to eat when it comes to pizza.

Well to start with, THIS IS MY 50th REVIEW!!! YIPPEEE!!!
I went to this place couple of weeks ago, well it was a nice experience to try their pizzas!
So the place is super neat and clean and has amazing ambience with comfy sofa chairs dignifying their black and pink decor. Soft instrumental music as background score, ideal for big groups because it's spacious! Though there is just a tad bit problem with the location if one comes from Ruby!
Coming to food, we ordered :
‚Ä¢ Medium 10" Chicken Stack pizza in deepdish with cheese burst.
‚Ä¢ Small 7" Cheesy Chicken pizza in thin and crispy base.
‚Ä¢ Triple Chocolate Sweetzza & Coke.
And it was Tuesday they gave us a free Cheesy garlic scroll. :)
Chicken stack pizza was heavenly! Generous pieces of chicken were there in every slices. Actually tasted better than any of the "popular" franchise pizza joints (totally my opinion).
Although I didn't like cheesy chicken pizza much. It was kind of very dry n hard to gulp.
Cheesy chicken scroll was very tasty.
And to end the meal with a triple sweetzza...wow! That was something... Never tasted anything like that before. Marvellous!
A must try for everyone. :)
All of this cost around 800bucks! So pretty economic guys. :)
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

****What's the secret ingredient you ppl pour in that oregano pepper mixture? That f***ing tastes AWESOME!!!!

What an ideal place for pizzas!!...i cn guarantee this is the place serving the best pizzas in our city...i have been here for quite a few times already...recently when i went there which is probably my 6th visit..i took two pizzas..one spicy chicken pizza and one peri peri chicken pizza...i really like the first one..kind of a tangy taste..the peri peri was good enuf!...now talking about the two important parts of pizza..the bread and the cheese..this place excels in both..the bread is fresh..well baked..soft..the ends are not thick and hard..They give generous amount of cheese in their pizzas..even in their normal pizzas...anytime more than the ones of dominos or pizza hut...and for the cheese lovers you should try out their big cheese and cheesy blast types..you will be delighted with its look and its taste..too good!..Now the little not okay parts...i feel the menu is limited..could be increased..some variety could be brought in..then the location and its surrounding..its a bit odd...troublesome to locate...interior and decor is good enuf..nothing great..seating is comfortable...that what matters to me with taste..hence a 5 rating!
If possible visit them on Wednesdays..to make things even better they have a one on one free offer!
U guys are a clear threat to the dominos and pizza hut..keep gng!!

I have been to this joint quite a few times and on my first few visits I found the pizza to be excellent, the ambience and service to be really nice.Today being Wednesday ( buy one get one free) I decided to bring some pizza home. I bought a 13" chicken supreme and chicken feast and this time I was quite disappointed. It's 880 including taxes for a pizza (although I got two for the price of one), but if I am paying that much money I expect a little more cheese and more chicken. There was a marked difference in the quality of food.
Rating based on previous experiences-5/5
Rating based on today's experience-2.5/5 (because I like them)
I have been recommending their pizza to everyone I know, but now I might have to rethink that.

Got a Chicken Mexicana thin crust home delivered. It was disappointing, cold and didn't look appetizing at all. I couldnt find any cheese or hot sauce drizzle as mentioned... and toppings too were sparse. Overall it tasted very bland and evn the chillyflakes or oregano mix couldnt save it. Pocket pinch is obviously quite low as compared to that of Dominoes and Pizza Hut but i would go for them over Eagle Boys.

Well I was very eager to order pizza from eagle boys for the 2nd time but i was very dissapointed. Once the order was here i realised they have wednesday one on one free offer but when i called them aftr the order they tell we dont give the offer when ordered on zomato... So i think I have to take either of the decision as in if i should stop using ZOMATO or ordering from EAGLE BOYS... This requires me to think twice before ordering from zomato and eagle boys.

Really needed a pizza place other than dominoes and pizza hut,  so tried this place.  Located close to my college, therefore was easy to locate.   Decor and seating arrangements were pretty good.  Also the boys working there are courteous. They come and take your order unlike other places.  Ordered an Australian non veg pizza.  The crust was soft and it was tasty!!  Plus every Wednesday there is a buy one get one free offer so is value for money!!  Definitely worth a 2nd visit!!

The taste is definitely distinct from Pizza Hut/ dominoes.. The price is affordable too .. I'll surely order from here more often in the future..

LOCATION & AMBIENCE :
Located on the Bypass ( towards kabsa ruby route), you are sure to miss this place unless you scout for it. A rugged, rickety ride took us to the restaurant. ( roads are very poor here)
From the outside this place looks like an american diner and from the inside the interiors are decent. They have tried to maintain the brand colors ( black and pink) in their decor.

FOOD:
-We ordered for their veg mixed sauce pasta which was not good. I feel its a sin to dump mayo in pasta. ( I am a big pasta snob)
- The pizza ordered was a veg extravaganza with cheese crust. The crust again had mayo in the name of cheese but tasted pretty good. The pizza sauce was tasty and toppings wre generously distributed. Over all a good pizza. Though next time will have it without the cheese crust. But if u like mayo on pizza you may well order it :)
- Sweetza is essentially a chocolate pizza and honestly I wasn't expecting it to be good. I was half expecting the pizza to be loaded with hershey chocolate syrup and some toppings. However! The pizza came exactly how it looked in the picture. Loaded with milk and white chocolate chips and a beautiful in-house chocolate ganache smothered with utmost care. It was topped with powered sugar and trust me, you have to try this dessert pizza!
#recommended
Oh we also ordered for our loyal coke to help UA with the pizza.

SERVICE: The service was extremely good and I was pretty happy with the personal attention given by the staff.

POCKET PINCH: We paid a total of 760 after a discount of 25 percent on the pizza! ( offer going on apparently). So yes the place is cheaper than dominos. ( even comparing other dishes from their American competitor)

This Australian pizza chain is definitely here to stay!
A refreshing change from the dominos monotony!
Who says only Americans and Italians rock the pizza scene? :)

Impressed with the overall quality and presentation of pizza. Taste wise it is more inclined towards the American style than the Italian style. They have a wide variety which indicates towards their in depth understanding of the pizza making. Seating is comfortable and staff is again very warm. Highly recommended pizzeria.

This is located near Ruby. The road to the Eagle Boys Pizza is very narrow and shaby. However once you get into the restaurant...... You will be struck with the warmth of the service there. The staff were very cheerful and that was something to talk home about. 

Coming to the food, the price of the pizza is relatively cheap than the other pizza joints like dominos,pizza hut etc. The pizzas were pretty big and fresh. But the only thing I did not find in their pizza was a crunchy base. The base was very soft and gooey. Reminded me a bit like my mother's pizza made at home.

Talking about the d√©cor inside, it was nice with a big screen TV which have HD channels.

I was waiting to eat here for weeks now. Its only been a few months since it has opened and its already made a name. So , i had to coax my friends and literally drag them here today. It was a Wednesday , so we could avail their BOGO offer. 7 of us shared 6 delicious and cheesy medium pizzas. Chicken mexicana, BBQ chicken and Spicy chicken. Two of Each. We got big cheesy crust for them.  They come with Loads of toppings sp. Corn and jalapenos. I love jalapenos so I couldn't stop eating. The crusts were well baked. I ll prefer this place over Domino's and Pizza Hut anyday. I have to go back soon to try their other pizzas and the triple chocolate sweetza that i've heard so much about. Also, with the BOGO on, the bill came to a little over 200 per head. Which was really pocket friendly :)

Hi,

M a pizza maniac, I really love pizza. According to my financial report and bills in mail (U can check my emails screenshot), last year m spend around 25K bucks only for pizza.

In my area (kolkata 700107 and 700078), only Dominos support home delivery. So, I have no other way to use Dominos Pizza from 2010 but the last few months they didn't pay attention to their customers, especially prepaid home delivery. Last few months, every time I ordered and they gave a hard, thin bread instead a soft pizza. I request them many times to pay attention, but they are as usual ....

So, I want to switch and last month someone informed me that another pizza named "Eagle Boys Pizza" is delivering in our area (kolkata 700107 and 700078) m happy to hear that because m much familiar with this "Eagle Boys Pizza" when I was in Australia. Easily I got it in Zomato and in that last month I ordered 4/5 times from "Eagle Boys Pizza".

Every time they delivered as I expected; good, soft, floppy bread with cheese and toppings, but here comes the TWIST when I order in last night April 02, 2016 (docket no 000-00976). Last night, I was late form office; I try to order them Chicken Wings or Nuggets with a Pizza but as m late, some are out of stock so I have to order Chicken Popcorn with VegSolo Combo. At the time of delivery, I found all boxes are too light like less than 10gms weights and when I opened it, all pizzas are like a paper or some big biscuit and burn, they were so hard, so arid that it looks like thin crust pizza (which I hate so much) above all this, over the phone the store manager or floor manager try to convince me that it was a regular, normal pizza not a thin crust when I ask deliver boy "What it is?" he just keeps silent because he knows m not an idiot what their manager think I am and manager continuously tries to convince me and it was so irritating, I can't explain. A normal pizza dough bread is floppy, soft and 20/25 mm height, but they are thin, hard, and only 1 mm height (U can check my pic). When I try to eat, I really freak out because it was so hard, dehydrate and burn, I feel m eating toast biscuit with cheese by paying around 300 bucks. I try to share it with street dog, but surprisingly, they also don't like to eat as it was so hard. Next time, I have to think twice or thrice or more before I place an order to Eagle Boys Pizza.

By the way - Bestes Gl√ºck

Update : (April 06, 2016)
Next day April 03, 2016, within 3/4 hrs after my review, they again make the 2nd mistake : try to refund me the money; I don't review for the refund or anything else, I reviewed as I don't like it - so I have no other way then to deny the money.

Day after April 03, 2016, on April 04, someone called me from their end. His name is Nisar, he talked with me and understand the whole scenario. After that, today I called him (directly in his mobile) and place a order, again. Love to say that today's order is good as expect form them. In addition, he also added a extra dessert (free of cost), I must say him THANKS for this complimentary dessert.

M also love to increase the ZOMATO RATE for his customer support and handling but not much because a customer support need full help, not a single man's activities. I love to stay with Eagle Boys Pizza in future and if I get satisfactory services from them, I will definitely increase the RATE ....¬†

Update : (April 24, 2016)
AGAIN m really really disappoint form eagle boys pizza service. After April 04, 2016, till yesterday, I ordered lots of time, may be more than 20/30 times but by Nisar (as he told me to do so for good service). Yesterday, April 23rd, 2016, I had guests in my home and unfortunately m suggest them eagle boys pizza

1st - I ordered Nisar and he confirm order at 8:50pm on whatsapp but the order placed after 1hr10 mins at 10:00pm in store (still don't know whose mistake it was).

2nd - As my guest want to get mushroom topping, I requested Nisar and he confirmed me at 8:51pm; but still I didn't received that pizza. Can anyone imagine how humiliating, in front of guest that dinner received 1hr30mins late and still didn't received what you ordered, after confirm order.

3rd - After whatsapp my address and again confirm that address at 9:08pm still delivery boy get a excuse as bill have another address.
 I ordered for North Purbachal, Kolkata-700078 and bill address is Rajdanga Main Road, Kolkata-700107.

Now its clear that -¬†
a) If a customer order by a store contact number, he/she may get 3rd class pizza or service as I received on April 02, 2016.¬†
b) As Nisar promised to provide good service but still he fail and he also provide 3rd class service and support, yesterday.
Now my question is - to whom I call for best or good or at least normal service for eagle boys pizza order ??

Pathetic delivery service! Placed order at 1:10 pm. Neither delivered nor sent any communication till now, 2.40 pm.

Food finally arrived at 3:40 pm. We had to hunt for the chicken in the Chicken Pasta.

Never order from this place. Refund my payment immediately.

Cooking instructions were not adhered to. I had requested not to use green capsicum as I am allergic to it. However our pasta had green capsicum in it.

So this is one tricky place to get to, though it says Ruby Hospital area, it's not nearly there, you have to cross the new Arsalan outlet on E.M. Bypass, walk for about another 5-7 minutes and THEN you get there. But, I will tell you that all that walking is really necessary to, firstly, work up a serious appetite (you will need it) and secondly, while returning to shed a few calories which you will have consumed. JK. But really, though. 

We went here to treat one of our friends for their birthday, and there were five of us. After we located the place, which looks extremely cute outside with all it's pinkness (yes, I am fan-girling, but no, you will not judge me!), we entered the welcome air conditioned restaurant. We chose the large couch on the left, which is a little cut-off from the rest of the restaurant, and that may have been the cause for the little lag in service in the beginning. But as soon as we made our presence realized (which is bound to happen when a bunch of rowdy college kids are present anywhere), the staff made our evening as comfortable as they possibly could. On that note, I would like to say that they are doing a great job, and they should really keep it up!

Then it came down to ordering what we wanted to eat, after a lot of debate, we decided on our classic favourite - a thin crust Margherita Pizza, then we chose a deep dish Chicken Stack Pizza and finally we decided we wanted a Cheesy-Garlic Scroll because of it's exclusivity to this particular brand of restaurants, or maybe because no other pizzeria in the city at least offers this particular dish, and of course, Coca- Colas go hand in hand with Pizzas. 

We had been informed that in case of someone's birthday, one would be offered a 30% discount on the bill, but on going there we learned that on Mondays they also have an offer on pizzas, i.e, on each pizza you order, you will get a 20% discount, which really is as great as it sounds, and we opted for the latter. 

Needless to say, the food was as good as it looks in the pictures and maybe even better to taste, none of that rubbery, chewy crust bullshit. I knew I had fallen deeply is love. The scrolls were delicious and is a must try, the margherita was beautiful and cheesy and I do not have any adjectives to describe it's beauty and the chicken stack was equally as good. 

The prices are not steep at all. In fact, it is MUCH cheaper than any other "popular" pizzeria in the city. And immediately after I left the place I began to crave for more Pizzas and Garlic scrolls. And I HIGHLY recommend it to all you good people and pie lovers.

An order from eagle boys pizza after a long long time left me spellbound. I called Anthony(the manager) and asked him to send in the best he has and it satisfied me to the core. 
A prawn and garlic pizza in a thin crust with creamy filling was one of the best pizza I've had! 
A chicken feast pizza loaded with toppings in a normal cheese crust was great! 
The newly introduced chicken garlic bread with an Indian flavour was lip smacking. The brownie bite remains a personal favourite ‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è
Having tasted pizza in a lot of countries recently I was sceptical about what the city's pizza chains would offer and eagle boys stood up to my expectations! A big shout out to Anthony for the creations and Mr.chattaraj for keeping up with the standard of the place :)

5 of us visited this place yesterday to treat a friend for his birthday. 
Though, the place was a little difficult to locate at first, we were eventually greeted by the signature black and pink decor of Eagle Boys. 
We ordered a cheesy garlic scroll which was perfectly crunchy on the outside with gooey cheese inside, we ordered the all time favorite margherita pizza with a thin crust-what can one say about this classic?
It was just awesome. 
We also ordered a large chicken stack pizza where we opted for the deep dish base and its mentionworthy that the chicken cubes, caramelised onions and mushrooms complemented each other perfectly, with the cheese bringing it all together.

One good thing (among the many) about the pizzas here is that neither is the deep dish base extremely thick and doughy nor is the thin crust base so thin that it becomes difficult to hold a slice without the toppings sliding off it.
The comfy decor and the hospitable services deserve a high five, as well as the numerous discount offers that they provide. 
We had a choice between 30% off on medium and big pizzas ordered (the garlic scroll and two coke bottles were excluded) as it was their Monday offer or a 20% off on the total bill as we had a birthday boy with us.
We chose the former.

Definitely going back here and here's to hoping they soon open numerous branches throughout the city.

I visited this place today with my friends as it was one of my friend's birthday. This place is located near Tagore Park. Not very difficult to locate. The place is pretty cozy. Now coming to the food, we ordered a chessy garlic bread which was very nice with the perfect crisp and cheese. Then we ordered the all time favourite Margarita pizza which was also pretty good. We also ordered a Chicken Stack pizza which I loved the most. Perfect crunch and good toppings. They were giving a 30%discount today which made us very happy.
On a whole, pretty good place and nice food. Reasonable price too.
The service was quick and well behaved stuffs.
Definable coming back.

Went there on sunday with my friends. Ordered on family chicken supreme with extra cheese, one spicy garlic scroll, and one coke. Took them approx 20 mins to serve..the outlet wasnt crowded but there was only one personnel handling the counter who was taking an order over the phone..so had to wait till she finished the call. The tissues wrapping the cutlery were not clean. Food was good, except for the spicy garlic scroll which was underbaked and had very less amount of cheese inside. Compared to other pizza outlets price was in the same range..but variety available is less. Overall..its ok.

This place is located near Hotel Sheldon, a little difficult to locate. You can easily miss it. And the road is also not made properly.
Coming to the order, we ordered a Veg Lovers pizza thin crust and a Tandoori Paneer pizza cheese burst. We also ordered their version of garlic bread. The thin crust pizza was just above average where as the cheese burst pizza was quite good. The garlic bread could be ignored.
For the price they charge, its not good enough. But I think you can try it once. And there are a lot of discount options on little. Do try them.

After seeing the good reviews on zomato I've decided to checkout this place..

I've ordered Zesty Chicken Pizza and Thumbs Up..The Zesty Chicken was ok but it does not match the quality and superior taste as compare to Pizza Hut and Dominos..

The interiors of Eagle Boys Pizza is very good..It gives you the feeling of perfect hangout place with your friends.. The cherry pink and white colour themed is well suited..

It also has a LED TV where you can watch matches with your friends that's I think is an advantage of this pizza restaurant..

Another advantage of this pizza restaurant is that you go the counter, order your food and sit comfortably and wait for your order.. As they serve your order..Moreover,you can also view your name and expected serving time in the LCD display TV so you are well updated..

If you are a Pizza Hut and Dominos lover then this is not a cup of tea for you..But if you loves to hangout to new places then you can surely come and have a nice time over here..

Overpriced pizza joints days are over with this awesome place who serve lip smacking fresh pizza's. Their pizza's tastes amazing and the best part it the prices are very reasonable(specially with their offers). We ordered supreme and extravaganza and we could not decide which one was better as we were too engrossed in their taste. Four 13" double chicken topping filled pizzas with four cold drinks came at 2500. 
Last but definitely not the least their sweetza is a bliss. Never did i think that hot chocolate in pizza can taste this amazing. Definitely try this,its worth it.
The decor is pretty cool with big comfy chairs and extremely courteous staff. This place is sure to become a big time hit.
The location might not be very convenient for many but its worth the travel,cause the pizzas are going blow you away.
They have some amazing offers as well,make sure you check them.
Will be visiting pretty soon again.üòäüòä

Dominos and pizza hut surely have to take a back seat now that Eagle Boys Pizza is here. Ordered chicken supreme and chicken extravaganza. The pizzas had just the right amount of cheese, chicken and spice and were absolutely lip smacking. Last but not the least, the chocolate pizza or the sweetza, we ordered for dessert was a real delight. The decor is likeable too. Eagerly wanting to make the next visit.

Had my eyes on this relatively new pizza parlor for quite some time. Digging up a little, I found that Eagle Boys Pizza has an Aussie origin and their franchise has outlets in few Indian cities like Hyderabad and Delhi. Their only outlet in Kolkata is this one, I am reviewing. In this review, I would be heavily comparing them with Domino's (Yes, our old loyal Domino's) as I have been their regular customer since ages.

First off, their outlet is not really publicized much. If you don't know them, it's really hard for you to know them. The outlet itself is located somewhere off E.M. Bypass, near Tagore Park I believe. I never received any pamphlets in newspapers whereas Domino's would send them almost every week.

Now coming to the meal, I ordered a 13" Chicken Supreme Pizza, Chicken Penne Pasta and Cheesy Garlic Scroll. The order was placed using Zomato and I got a generous discount of 20% on the bill :) The Penne Pasta was replaced with Macaroni Pasta as they had run out of stock on that one.

Chicken Supreme Pizza was quite different from Dominos' variant of the same name. It was less spicier, more cheesier and what to say about the taste, super delightful. Toppings were not excessive, neither very less (about 5-6 chicken pieces per slice). The crust was nice and soft. The pizza was bigger than I had expected, at least an inch bigger than Domino's largest size.

Coming to sides, Cheesy Garlic Scroll was nice, cheese oozing out of it (see the photo). Macaroni Pasta was a disappointment, sauce was not good and it was excessively oily. Oregano and Chilli seasoning sachets was provided.

Pricing is economical, all the above items cost me ‚Çπ795 after discount. At Domino's I easily manage to spend over ‚Çπ1000 if I have no discount coupons around. Packing was okay but a bit unprofessional, pasta and garlic scroll came packed in generic tin foil boxes, no branding on them whatsoever. Bill was totally unprofessional, a handwritten bill. Yes! Handwritten bill, can you imagine in this era. Even most small-scale restaurants nowadays provide a printed bill. Service was a bit unprofessional as well, they called like four times, first to confirm the order, second as they forgot to ask for the sauce in pasta, third to tell that pasta of made choice is not available (great) and lastly to know about the delivery address. Delivery took 45 minutes, and no, they don't have any 30 minutes or free policy.

Narrowing down everything you are looking at a truly good Pizza joint, a great alternative to Domino's. Two suggestions for them, first increase the service efficiency and second, introduce some good sides/appetizers, that section seems to be very empty right now.

And would recommend their sweetzaa, the pizza wit chocolate topping. Blown my mind. So would rate 4.0 for food, 4.0 for deliver on time and 4.0 for the experience. Keeping 1.0 in my reserve for the next experience at EB

To discover a hidden pizza nook amongst the grey , concrete jungle that is Ruby hospital area and to find that it houses some of the best pizzas in Kolkata will surely make you feel like a Bedouin at an oasis . Eagle Boys pizza , with the right marketing , holds the promise to become the next best pizza eatery in the city. With delicacies  like the chocolate sweetza ( chocolate pizza generously coated with hot chocolate syrup and white and brown choco chips) , Chicken Mexicana pizza , Chicken bundi pizza , Extravaganza pizza -the list is long , my friends and I had a ball. The staff is well trained hospitable and courteous, making your visit memorable by offering to click your pictures and featuring in their blogs. Ther business mantra is smart - hosting attractive offers every day of the week till now. ( We went on a Wednesday and availed buy 1 get 1 ). Before winding up , I'd ask all Jerry mice to give this place a swirl !

Their pizza is fantastic- they make especially gold thin crust pizzas. The toppings are generous, the cheese nice and stringy like nowhere else. I only wish they would deliver in a wider radius- their location is rather inconvenient. If they do, they'd give every other pizza joint in town a run for their money.

Both the pizzas were really delicious but the bar-b-q pizza was everyone's favorite. We also tried the garlic bread and the triple chocolate sweetza. I've read a lot of reviews which said that the chocolate pizza was too sweet but for me, it was heavenly. A perfect end to a delicious meal. This is the place I will be visiting for all my pizza cravings :D

After going thoroughly with the reviews in zomato I finally decided to visit eagle boys pizza. As I am a frequent customer of dominos pizza I certainly found some similarities with the menu n pricing. I had ordered for extravaganza nonveg pizza and coke. Crust was soft and it was quite tasty. But I felt it was too oily and here it differs from dominos pizza.

Decoration was nice & clean with a moderate sitting option.Pizza was neither too much tasty neither very bad.It was very just like okay.I found this pizza a little too oily.I could easily figure out the numbers of chicken chunk.I could find a resemblance with DOMINOS in term of pricing.

Finally visited this one after a long time with my childhood friend. We orderd one chicken n corn and another tandoori paneer. I liked the former one much more than the paneer one..but both the pizzas were so delicious. The ambience was quite soothing and also the servicing was pretty fast. Hope to visit this one soon with friends :-D

This is the new den for pizzas now. Being near my college, I have become a frequent visitor here. On Wednesdays they have an offer of 'buy one get one free' available on any pizzas of 10 or 13 inches. I have tasted almost all the pizzas here. Stack Chicken, Chicken Mexicana are my favourites here. The desserts are also quite delicious. Sweetza, a chocolate pizza deserves special mention. The only thing I didn't like here is the chicken wings. Would love to go and taste the other pizzas on the menu. :P

I have ordered twice from Eagle Boys and that defintely says that the food is good. The first time, it was a take away and they were prompt. The quality of the pizza is good and there is enough material on the base to eat. The second time around, I decided to dine in. Again, I ordered a pizza which I relished. The only problem I had was with the chicken wings. What I actually got was chicken drumsticks. Also from a place that adverstises itself as Australian, the drumsticks were definitely north Indian in style. The plate was also garnished with sliced onion and tomato. Defintely not Australian like. Having said that however, they did taste good. I will definitely visit them again but maybe I will just stick to the pizzas.

I have seen this outlet quite a few times on the way to my office. However I was not very sure of the brand and initially thought that this maybe is a single outlet instead of a Pizza chain. Anyway, later I came to know that this is Australia's largest pizza chain. They also visited my office few days back but I missed the chance to try it out then.

Anyway, I ordered One 10" Gourmet Chicken Extravaganza with Extra Mozzarella Cheese and One Cheesy Garlic scroll. I ordered it through an online food order app(not Zomato) and even though the outlet is around 3 km from my house but still they delivered the pizza in around half an hour. So delivery is very good indeed.

Now coming to the quality and price of the food. The pizza was absolutely fresh and the crust was 100% juicy. I have ordered pizza from Dominoes an awful lot of times in my office or home but in most occasions I found the crust(especially the outer circumference) a bit hard. This one from Eagle Boys really impressed me. The toppings too felt fresher than Dominoes. So it really tastes very good. One point though, I was expecting a bit more cheese with the extra mozzarella cheese option but it was not like cheese burst type. I guess for that experience I need to choose other type of crusts. One 10" might not be sufficient for two adults for dining purpose so add a side dish with that if you may.

The cheese garlic was decent but I still love the Dominoes Garlic bread more. Also I didn't get any dips with that and didn't get any option to add any dip additionally while ordering. 

Now considering the quality of Eagle Boys Pizza and the price and quality of the competitors, I would say that the price here is definitely at par or better than others. Also I would surely recommend this outlet to other Pizza lovers.

After seeing lots of positive reviews on Zomato we finally visited today at evening. Eagle Boys pizza is situated at EM BYPASS near VIP Bazaar, ambiance was good enough to notice, very clean place and seating arrangement were spacious and larger. Hospitality was very good. Ordered there chicken stack pizza with big cheese base. 
They use some kind of granular cheese which I found excellent in taste compare to other popular pizza brand in Kolkata. Crust was very thin and crunchy. Overall it was a great experience. Will definitely visit again within a week.

I have been looking forward to trying this place since a long time. Finally went there last Sunday with my sis and the very first thing I wanna say about this place is I am going back this Saturday again. The Chicken Pena Pasta in White sauce is freaking tasty. The best pasta I ever had. The Pizza crust is so thin and when you order for extra cheese you really do get the sticky cheese that you dream of. And, in every bit you will get the toppings filled. I just wish you guys open up in the Malls and in better location. I can bet that Pizza Hut is even going to have a hard time and Dominos doesn;t even fall in competition. Top of it, if you are 1st time visitor, get a 20% off..You guys are amazing. A MUST FOR PIZZA LOVERS. THE BEST WHITE PASTA AND CHICKEN MEXICANA PIZZA WITHOUT A DOUBT.

Ordered today for the first time & loved it. The pizza crust was as soft as Pizza Hut pizzas & the cheese on it was enough. Ordered a simple cheesy chicken pizza medium 10" size. Oreganos & chilli flakes sachets were given in ample too. Price is cheaper than dominos but quality is equal. Will try again.

I have been wanting to try this outlet since long, and I could do it today. Ordered veg spicy pizza through online payment in zomato. And it lived upto its quality and name. Its exactly the thin crust as I love and it was delivered hot and fresh. Pizza was tasty and a medium size is enough for 1 foodie person like me. Im now ordering from here only. Happy im!

Though I'm a little late to put in my review however I thought better late than never. Me and one one my friends had ordered a takeaway from this place sometime back. Our orders consisted of Zesty Chicken Pizza and Chicken Stack Pizza. We had also orders a Brownie as a desert. However, Zesty Chicken Turned out to be quite satisfactory on the other hand, Chicken stack appeared to be surprisingly bad in taste. It tasted a weird combination of sourness and bitter. The brownie too was a little dissatisfying.
Given an option I would rather opt for Dominoes or Pizza Hut rather than Eagle Boys.

The pizzas here are fresh,cheesy and they taste AMAZING.
What makes it better are the offers on Wednesday and Thursday.¬†

Chicken mexicana,chicken extravaganza and spicy chicken are some of the best.
And go for the thin crust cheese burst pizzas,peepul. Absolute bliss. ^____^
Sweetza is suprisingly good. Perfect way to end your pizza meal with something sweet.
Prices are moderate,in fact good enough for what they offer. Service is decent.
The black-and-pink theme colour is attractive. The interior has that vibrant feel a pizza shop is supposed to have.

the pizza was definitely better than domino's pizza-with more cheeze and overall tasted better. However, the paneer in my pizza tasted bitter and i had to pick it out. Cheeze scrolls tasted nice. The thin crust was good and crispy. Deep dish crust was soft. Would have given it a 4 if the paneer wasnt so bitter.

Superb is the word! Never had such delicious pizzas before. Situated on the E.M. bypass makes it very easy to locate the joint. There is an introductory buy 1 get 1 offer going on which makes it even better. We had ordered a chicken mexicana pizza with thin and crispy crust and a chicken keema pizza with deep dish crust. Both were amazing in their own way. The ambience was good and so was the staff. Dominos and pizza hut are surely going to face some serious competition now. Hopeful about seeing more and more outlets all across the city. Would love to visit again and for people reading my review,do pay a visit.

LOVED it! Yes I would really start my review with that! Very cool ambience-with pink lights and pink seats- an uncommon set up. Extremely friendly staff and what they serve is absolutely fresh- that's exactly why they take a lot of time to serve post order but the food is worth the wait! They had a buy 1 get 1 free offer on every 10" and 13" pizza ordered - so We ordered two 10" pizzas - non veg spicy mexicanna (thin crust) and chicken keema pizza(deep crust). The first was v spicy and loaded with flavours while the later was what one calls- lip smacking!However the quantity of chicken in the pizzas could be increased! Nevertheless I think it's a must visit especially if you are a student because its quality food that's made pocket friendly and above all their pizzas are worth a try!

This place has been open for quite sometime and inspite of being a stone's throw away from my house never ate from here before. So i decided to give it a try and the result was mindblowing. Their standard crust is THIN so that itself is a great start. Exceptional mozzarella cheese and hearty toppings. Their customization options are pretty cool as well and all being moderately priced. You can have a full meal for two at around rs. 450. This is one of the best pizzas i ever had. And way better than dominos, pizza hut fare. Will try their non veg items next time. Just a few suggestions...your seasoning is a tad too salty and you need to broaden your pasta, desserts range. Overall mark my house down guys, you will have to deliver here pretty regularly.

It was good. Really good. But doesn't catch up with chili's.

We ordered pizzas to be delivered and this was the condition in which it came!! All the toppings were pushed to one side while the order was being carried. Please put proper cheese instead of mayonnaise!!
And anyway, a die hard fan of Dominos Pizza is quite a challenge to be impressed by any new entry of the Indian market!
Nonetheless, all the very best of luck Eagle Boys Pizza.

We had the Veg Lovers Pizza, since it was our first try there. The crust was deliciously soft and crunchy, a paradox that was sublime to our taste buds. The vegetables were fresh and juicy..they were still crunchy when they got served! 

We had gotten a 30% discount that day and for 318/- it was a delicious meal-snack for the three of us. Arent I right,

I opted for 1. Coffee... good, 2. Mexican pizza 7".... excellent and 3. Brownie bite... perfect, a scoop of vanilla will make it heavenly for sure, but it's not available... anyways, taken home there 1. Chessy blast medium spicy chicken pizza with mushroom and onion as extra veg toppings and tandoori chicken as non veg toppings... it's just heavenly, 2. Chicken popcorn... ok, 3. Chessy garlic scroll... very good, 4. Spicy garlic scroll... excellent, 5. Potato wedges... simple and finally 6. Sweetzza... awesome, excellent, extra ordinary... coming to the pocket pinch its ok as per there quality... Will surely order again...

Has to offer one of the best pizzas in town. Domino's doesn't stand a chance in front of it. Down to their cutlery, I sincerely adored my time here. It is not too pricey as well for its quality and quantity. 

This outlet also has ample space to occupy several persons.

I read a lot of reviews about this place and being a pizza freak I had to go there. For the people who do not know, it a a famous pizza franchisee from Australia. Came here on a Sunday with my wife. The place is not that far but the visibly from the main road is not proper. Once we reached, the place looked nice and clean. There is plenty parking space also. We ordered 3 pizzas margarita, Mexican delight and Australia's special. We ordered all in thin crust and all of them were really tasty. They were fresh and hot and met my expectations. The best was the Australia's special which had pineapple and corn, just loved it. The best part about the place is the staff is super friendly and courteous. I feel in todays maker they are better than pizza hut and dominos as I liked their pizza sauce better than others. I am waiting for them to open more stores in the city centre so that I can enjoy their pizzas more frequently.

We just suddenly decided to go here today and I'm glad we did because the pizza was incredible. We had the aussie's favourite chicken pizza, chicken wings and the cheesy garlic scroll. The chicken wings were spicy, tangy and tasted similar to tandoori chicken which was nice in a way. The garlic scroll was also amazing (I'm a sucker for garlic bread so no wonder the garlic scroll was a hit). The pizza crust was really good and I love pineapple on pizza so the combination of toppings was also amazing! Although I wish they had added pepperoni pizza to their menu because that would have been epic!
The staff is super friendly and we had a great time!

The first meal of the new year I chose Eagle Boys Pizza near Ruby Hospital. The newest kid in pizza world of the city doesn't have decor or location to show off but the pizzas they are serving will soon give Domino's and Pizza Hut a run for their money.

We had Chicken Mexicana, Aussie's Favourite Chicken and Triple Chocolate Sweetzaa. Chicken Mexicana is not as spicy like will give up hiccups topped with Jalape√±o, Onion, Capsicum and Green Chilli with succulent chicken cubes. This should be enjoyed with cheesy blast base. Aussie's Favourite Chicken topped with pineapple chunks, sweet corn, onion, capsicum and fresh garlic. Again this is recommended with big cheese base. Though these ingredients are same as one will find in Domino's and Pizza Hut but Eagle Boys not only use what mentioned in menu but the freshest ingredients too. Hence the pizzas are juicy, soft, delicate and full of taste.
The most innovative pizza I found was Triple Chocolate Sweetzza. The base of the dessert is 7 inches thin crust base topped with rich layer of chocolate sauce with drizzle of dark chocolate and white chocolate chips. The dessert taste heavenly once served piping hot out out of oven.

We got 25% off on total bill and paid INR 1074 inclusive all. On the new year took my myself an oath if ever I try pizza then will be Eagle Boys. Will wish Anthony and his team all the best and keep flying high like eagle. No parking issue faced. Small suggestion keep plastic disposable glass near water dispenser and paper towel or had drier near wash basin.

If Dominoe's pizza is the standard on which you measure other pizzas with, Eagles is higher placed than both Dominoe's and Pizza Hut (which I greatly dislike). Both the Veg extravaganza and spicy chicken pizzas (wednesday loot for buy one get one free), measured up well with soft pizza base and adequate toppings. 

Now the catch is that Eagles scores high only in comparison to Dominoe's, our desi pizza wonder company. If one puts it in the same rank as an international chain of acclaimed pizza offering, it doesn't match up.

 It is another moot point all together whether such international food offering is business-wise viable for Calcutta. For the time being, Eagles is on the same path as Dominoe's - ordering an Indian menu, tapping into local taste buds, and offering competitive prices (and even sending tomato sauce to have with pizza). I see no reason for it to fail, since it has got the trick to crack Indian food market right.

Just one word awesome. If you like pizza you have to try eagel boys pizza its much better than dominos and pizza hut(this is my opinion).
On wednesday the have bogo offer. I ordered a 13 inch chicken supreme and it tasted really good. One more tip when you buy a pizza add extra cheese it tastes heavenly. The staff are very friendly and abience is also very good. Would have rated 5 but one major drawback is the location( Opp to jalshagarh) very difficult to park your car.

I loved the pizza. I had ordered a medium zesty chicken pizza. Since its a wednesday i got another zesty chicken pizza free. The pizza was done to perfection. This was my first time and trust me , I am going to have pizzas from none other than Eagle Boys. Its time to ditch Dominos & Pizza Hut. Quality of cheese is truly good. I ordered for a home delivery and it arrived at the exact time I was mentioned of. Extremely pleased with their service and quality. Gonna visit the outlet soon.

There are those weekends when your so lazy, that you don't feel like going anywhere, and wish there was a good food joint nearby. Well EBP is that food joint for me. It's less than 5 mins walk away, and I have been here a couple times. I'll say this place serves good pizza, although all varieties that they advertise are not available. Here's the catch - They serve pizzas hot and fresh when you are having them in their outlet. However, their home delivery service is not good. 
I'll suggest pizza fanatics to visit this place. They have a unique taste which is different from Dominos or PH, and slightly cheaper too.

A really novel experience..for all these days pizza meant Dominos and Pizza Hut. Pizza hut is really good but owing to the great distance from my home..we usually ordered from Dominos(which isnt really worth the price..:3)
Now after trying here..i felt satisfied . Loved the taste of the pizza..the crust was soft and just right. Had ordered a spicy chicken(deep dish) . The combo of chicken and cheese and corns and jalapenos graced my tongue beautifully...and then i had ordered a Triple chocolate sweetza and a brownie bite. The sweetza is a delicacy here with loads of choc syrup, white and dark choc chips on a pizza bread..its served hot and is a delish. The brownie was a fudgy one and was really good. 
Overall i really loved it..the price was also good and so was the meal.

YUM! After trying Domino's and Pizza Hut here I'd choose EB any day. Best pizzas I've had in a long time (closer to North American style yeah!!). Great prices, offers (BOGO.. Thank you) and flavours. People on the phone were extremely polite and even the guy who delivered was very cordial.  I ordered a Chicken Stack and Spicy Chicken, i asked for the corn to be taken out (as a preference) and was offered a substitution, so i chose mushrooms, that actually didn't happen when the pizzas arrived but no harm. Extremely satisfied, Great job guys look forward to more pizzas from you and I'm gonna tell all my friends too. Only things I would change is the quality of the paper napkins.

We had ordered a medium Chicken Extravaganza and it was quite good. They had a buy one get one free offer on so we tried the Cheesy Chicken Pizza which was nice though I liked the other one better. I would certainly order the Extravaganza again.
Strangely though they are an international chain they don't have a Pepperoni Pizza.¬†
Overall a pleasant experience.

Firstly, good bye dominoes and pizza hut... Will miss u..! :p probably the best pizza joint in town... Try any pizza u will love it... Even the popcorns brownies all are just super good.( too high on food to find any proper adjective)
Secondly the people serving the food were very helpful, interactive.. The gave us a complementary brownie as they took time to prepare the sweetzie... Dunno any other place where they do so...
Thirdly the reasonable price...! 
All these sums up eagle boys... Way to go guys..!! 
Oh, and I forgot the offers.. go on Monday, Wednesday or Thursday....!!

The food is awesome here. The best pizza I've had till date. The Big Cheese add-on is too good. The pasta was out of the world and the brownie was also very good. The staff were also very courteous. I'm definitely going back for more pizza. Yum!!!

I had an eye for this joint ever since i saw the place being constructed and couldnt wait to give it a try. Finally today i ordered online via zomato. Firstly i must say this online process is smooth as cake and very convenient. Hats off zomato!! 

Now coming to eagle boys... Well i think they need lil polishing when it comes to their pizza or garlic bread. I ordered for the chicken mexicana and cheese garlic bread. It fails to stand at par with its other branches. The spicy mix topping is a good addition as it added extra taste but I would any day prefer pizza hut. The pizza was very average and the garlic bread lacked taste. The cheeze does not tantalize ones taste buds for sure. To woo the customers , Guys please come up with some innovations. An average tasting pizza is not what we seek anymore.

The delivery was really quick i have to admit. I read a review that they had poor service and i think they took note of that and made amends which is commendable.

Prices are affordable but the quantity of their wedges is very poor.

A RARE EXPERIENCE -
There are very few places who take their feedback seriously and this place is among them. They took their feedback extremely seriously. Customer Feedback and Satisfaction!!! Every restaurant would be a foodies heaven, if they learn even 1% from this place.

My 2nd order was just a large Veg Extravaganza and they delivered me 2 Large Veg Extravaganza and a Triple Sweetzza for FREE, as a good gesture. Why? Read on...

First Experience - Worst Dessert quality.
They charged 99 for the Triple Choclate dessert and it was not even worth 10. Full of raw sugar and a total crap in the name of chocolates.

Pizzas are ok.

Garlic Breads were not good. Too tight and the edges were just bread.

[6/12/15] Updated Rating from 1.5 to 2.5: They have a good feedback system. Their store manager Anthony calls up customers individually for feedback. Had a conversation with him and he was courteous enough to listen to the feedback and promised on improvement. Will try again and post back.

[6/12/15 Evening] Updated Rating from 2.5 to 4.5
I ordered a Large Veg Extravaganza after a word with their Manager Anthony who had called for feedback. As an wonderful gesture, they provided one more Large Veg Extravaganza free (though it was not a Wednesday as they provide another for free). On top of that, an extra Triple Chocolate Sweetzza was provided for free as a good gesture.
I should have been billed more than 1500 but they insisted on taking only 700 bucks.

The pizzas were definitely good but the Triple Chocolate Sweetzza was still too sweet. Maybe my taste buds will not favor that type ever.

However, they deserve a 4.5/5 because of this rare gesture that I doubt any other place could ever offer. Being so much attentive to Customer Satisfaction, and acting so quick! There is no doubt this place will rocket to be a top Pizza spot in the city.

[24/01/16] A suggestion: Try their thin and crusty Pizza Base. Its way better than the rest.

We all really had great fun over there on the evening of 20th November 2015.
Great place for hangouts, get together and also for small party / celebrations..........

Ambiance, food, behaviour of the staff was simply just outstanding........

I would specially like to thanks the Restaurant General manager Mr. Anthony Tapas Dutta, who took care of our needs in such a wonderful way, ¬†though he was not himself able to present over there during the time of our get together.

Also would like to mention the name of Ms. Dipika......
She took care of our every small needs and confirmed that we are comfortable.....

1 thing I would like to suggest, that -
Please keep the stock of Single Pizzas and deserts in some more quantities.

Though U guys are extra ordinarily wonderful......
keep it on.......
Will visit there very soon...............

Me & my friend went to eagle boys for the first time just to cut the monotony as we have been quite bored to have the same pizzas of dominos & pizza-huts but never thought of the experience would make us so gastronomically satisfied that we will always come back here whenever we feel like having pizzas. 

Kudos to the entire team of eagle boys.

It was a really awesome experience. The pizza's are so delicious an good. I prefer to go to you people more than Domino's or Pizza Hut.
Moreover the service provided with by the employees out there is really appreciative, they know how to handle their customers and provide accurate customer service.

Special thanks to Dipika for providing us such a friendly and kool environment. ¬† 
She has excellent rapo building with her customers.

Our group would surely be back there soon to enjoy the awsome tasty pizza's.
Once again special thanks to DIPIKA.

In the quest to find an alternate to domino's and pizza hut,over the years I have tried quite a few places in the city.With eagle boys pizza,the effort paid off in spades.The propensity to eat handsome food at first sight is an impulse that's older than dirt itself.Over the years,evolution has made made us very particular of what we eat and how much we eat.However,with heart warming food,this evolutionary process seems to¬† be a fallacy in itself.Overeating lead to obesity which is quite frankly,at large these days.I have seen dudes(and dudettes) who are larger than some nations.This merry banter aside,and not making a foray into eagle boys' future prospects in contributing to the nation's overweight problem,I will return to the job at hand.

On a saturday afternoon I found them enlisted in zomato order app,and ordered a 10 inch chicken keema pizza with added pineapple toppings,chicken nuggets and triple chocolate sweetza for a sweet closure.

What's good-Chicken kimma pizza comes under super non veg section,which is equivalent to domino's non veg special,but is cheaper.They also normally use thin crust or deep dish,and it feels like a charity case,because domino's charges extra bucks for these.The domino's horror show,the very infamous and oral mucosa hostile classic hand tossed base is conspicuously and fortunately absent here.The pizza tasted just as good.Moving on,triple chocolate sweetza is one charming dessert,and is closely related to the donut family.However,instead of the customary hoola loop like bread,they use a 7 inch pizza dough and drizzle chocolate and crunchies all over it.This is the one to lookout for.

what's bad-I have tried only one side,the chicken nuggets.They give 6pcs at a reasonable 89/-.But here's the rub.On a good day,a venky's nugget will taste¬† better,even if I am the one frying those babies.The nuggets are small,stymied,and of not particularly healthy deposition.While I may have used semantics to¬† express the same sentiment thrice,it's suffice to say that it's a work in progress.Also,they don't have a 30 minute guarantee,and I received my order almost an hour later.

tidbits-They charge 20% tax(VAT and serivce tax).Best time to order is wednesday(buy one get one free)>monday(30%off)>thursday(10 inch or 13 inch pizza fetches you 50% discount on the second pizza)

Pizza doesn't taste good at all. Topping quantity is also negligible. I guess Dominos (the worst pizza makers in India) serves better pizzas than them. I mean for example if you order a pizza with onion as one of the topping, you will hv to search with a magnifying glass to find one small piece of onion. Disappointed with it. Never gonna order again.

This joint is a refreshing change, offering a middle path between the fast-food and sandwich-shop pizzas and the signature, pricey Dominos and Pizza Hut (I am not including the fine-dining options such as the "kitchens of spaghetti" and "Ice, Fire, and other elements of nature" in my review ;) . Or they are this way at least till they spread their network and consider bumping up prices.

The menu is more or less the regular fare - Supreme, Extravaganza,.. names that we have grown up hearing. The Cheesy Garlic roll is a delightful change from the Dominos version - soft and cheesy on the outside, but a nice crisp outer crust. The pizzas come with liberal amounts of cheese in the garnishing, and fresh and sufficient veggies (BTW, we ordered all veg on our visit). Their bases are more like Pizza Hut's, and their pan pizza base is doused in butter - just the way we like it, allowing us to eat it all the way up to the edge and not stop an inch before! On a Saturday, we got a 'Buy 1 Get 1 Free" on our order ¬†of 1 medium, giving us a meal for 4 for around 700 bucks. Not a bad deal at all! This included 2 drinks and the garlic bread, of course.

Their staff is friendly and ready to serve. The service was prompt (and yes, they bake their pizza bases fresh).

Now for the cons. As this is a new place they are obviously going through some teething. We ordered our eat-in medium on a thin crust and the take-away on a pan. However the order was recorded as pan for both. These are also the only base options available. We were informed that the stuffed base options would be available as soon as the equipment to bake them arrives. The establishment also needs to do something about the pests - too many insects and a few mosquitos too. We understand that this is that time of the year, but they should probably consider increasing the count of their flycatcher lights. Maybe also pump up the air-con to address this problem..

All in all, a thumbs-up to the place! Ideal for eating in if you are a small party (and enjoy brightly coloured interiors). Need to experience their delivery service as of yet. Finally Kolkata has got its alternatives to the big fish! Bangalore, Delhi, Bombay had them, we've got them too now!

Good food, nice ambience, good decor, apt choice of colors, well suited view from the pizzeria makes it an excellent place. The pizza had quite good soft and crunchy crust. I had an regular chicken stack pizza. The pizza requires a few bits of chicken otherwise it's good to go. The only thing it lacks is a good collection of music but they made it up with the hand-written thank you note from the waitress. I liked it very much and I shall be preserving it. I hope you don't mind if I post a picture of it. Looking forward to visit again.

Just yesterday, had my 1st pizza from EB. I ordered chicken mexicana, aussie's favourite chicken n chicken penne. I liked aussie's fav chickn the most. It was a lil bit spicy as well as sweet bcoz of small chunks of pineapple. Chicken mexicana was quite spicy for me n the taste wasnt that much unique. the crust was thin n crispy. Chicken penne was ok type. 1ce earlier had ordered chicken popcorn n tht was below avg. Dont xpect the xact taste that u get at KFC. Offers r good.. overall what i can is that u can give it a try but dont xpect much from the side dishes. Either they r avg or below avg..

Locating the store is a problem. If you are going towards science city from ruby hospital crossing the store is on your left, can be seen from the bypass. But you have to take the kachcha service road much before, from Tagore Park, in front of Hotel Sheldon, to reach the restaurant. However, once you reach, everything is just fine! The decor, the ambience, the service, and above all, the pizzas!! Undoubtedly, the pizzas are better than what Dominos and even Pizza Hut offers. Delicious is the word! A must visit place for all pizza lovers!

Had the greatest pizza of my life at Eagle Boys Pizza Kolkata yesterday! Not only the pizzas were delicious, the base is so soft and tasty that one can eat it without the toppings! The Triple Chocolate Sweetzza, a dessert pizza, deserves special mention. Forget Pizza Hut and Dominos! Go and try Eagle Boys Pizza.

Well, last time I ordered from this place I had a very bad experience and I swore never to order from this place again. Yesterday I got a call from the manager of this place and he offered me a free complimentary meal of the same pizza I ordered last time and a chance to rectify their mistakes. I agreed and the Pizza was delivered.Unlike last time, this time the pizza was brought in a proper pizza bag which keeps it hot instead of a Polly Bag. And hot it was. The chilli flakes they provided along with the other seasonings just burned me. So if you are applying ¬†the flakes on your pizza be aware you don't add a lot.The crust was just what it should be. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The cheese you can really taste and the smell that came out along with the hot steam made this foodie hard to wait without having a bite. The Triple Chocolate Sweetzza I got this time had chocolate chips, both brown and white and it tasted as good as beautiful it looked.
There's hell and heaven difference between what I got last time and what was delivered to me this time. If this is what they deliver every time then this is surely going to climb up my fav pizza joint list much faster than any other. Now I can really recommend this place to everyone and I will be ordering from this place very soon.¬†Special mentions here are their zeal to act on their mistakes and make them better and in literal terms doing what it takes to satisfy their customers.

Its festive mood in Kolkata. That mood was totally destroyed when I decided to order from the newly opened Eagle Boys today.

Firstly the person taking the order on the phone doesn't know how to talk. You can‚Äôt understand half of what he says and every time you have to ask again. I ordered one 10" Chicken Stack, one 7" Chicken Stack, one Triple Chocolate Sweetzza and a coke. When the order finally arrived it was cold and dry. And I was really surprised to see they gave no seasoning in the package and also none on top of the pizza either. How am I supposed to eat a cold dry pizza without any seasoning? Am I supposed to swallow them directly with the coke?

I am glad there are other better pizza places in town so that I never ever have to order from this place ever again. Worst experience ever.
