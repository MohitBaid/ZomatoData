Order placed via Zomato.
Got timely delivery.
Food was good.
INSTRUCTIONS NOT FOLLOWED. Inspite of requesting them not to add( or minimum) chilly to the menu, it was grossly neglected.

A little bit skeptic at first for their pricing which is higher side compared to other restaurant around the area but after tasting their food(chicken and mutton biriyani and mutton handi), I must say that they really done great cooking,
Buttery smooth ordering process provided by zomato,
Delivered early...

A good place to dine. Had been to this place for a couple of times before. It provides a very good value for your money both in terms of service and quality of the food. Definately a to recommend.

Ordering from zomato is soo easy and smooth. The delivery was just on time . and just like the timing the restaurant alao did justice with its dishes.
Very much pocket friendly. 
the chicken was tasty and flavourful.

Really good food. Delivery ison time. We commonly order chicken drums of heaven and love it. Their fish finger is good but fish fry' s cost is higher for its amount. Never dined up here but will surely go once

Going by the reviews I was a bit sceptical about ordering from here....But thought to give it a try....So ordered 1. Chicken Tikka Resmi Butter Masala & 2. Mutton Rezala.....and let me tell you....I was pleasantly surprised and was not let down at all . The delivery was absolutely on time...infact before time... The delivery guy was familer with the location . Now coming to the taste part....It was great...nd I indeed mean GREAT....being a big time foodie , I am very choosy when it comes to food....nd I can vouch for it that the food was indeed FRESH & HOT and super taste...

Highly Recommended.... ^_^

Happy Pet Puja ^_^

I ordered online from this restaurant twice.both times I hated it. food is below average to not so good.and the delivery process is so chaotic and disgusting.first restaurant calls you which is okay.then starts the real part..delivery personal comes to the address but says  incohorently they are in different location.then says they was already in location.I have to come and get it.(zomato has a "new policy"you have to get the order out of your home premises )finally lot of yelling and one and half hour waiting delivery personal came to lacation.I got my order.this happened both time i unfortunately ordered from here. and after I wanted  the paper bill(he was showing )the delivery person showed some very nasty attitude.people who can put up with it and have lots of free time and unlimited patience order from here.they will surely not disappoint you.
