Okay so this place is at Esplanade. It is situated in a very narrow lane among the bazaar. If you are going for the first time, you might not notice the entrance.
Once you go inside, it is really good. They have got two floors. The first floor is for group hangouts where there are cosy sofas and very loud music they play. The second floor has got a decor very cosy for the couples.
Food is nice though nothing extraordinary. The hookah is avaerage. Recently they have started serving drinks as well. The best thing is the prices are reasonable and they don't take tax.
Happy fooding üòä

A very good ambience. The cubicles made with white flowing curtains and dim light with music is the best part. Apart from hookah, the food is too tasty at reasonable cost. The exact location is a bit tough to find at one go for the first timers.

Wanted to try a new place amd zomato showed this place as nearby places.. So tried it

# Ambience - Decor is nice.. You can choose your favorite music and ask them to play and the behavior of the stuff is also nice but the crowd there is very much cheap
# Food- We ordered
@ Chicken Italian pizza - food is great and it was super cheesy
@ Arabiata Pasta- very cheesy and tasty
@ Chicken Hakka noodles - never order this.. Quantity is too little and not at all tasty
@ Crispy Chilli Baby Corn- Tasty but not so great

# Pocket Pinch- It is very cheap we ordered a hookah too and the bill costs 1080..the food costs 580..so yes it is quite cheap..

You can go this place for try once but because of the crowd i will not recommend this..

It was my friend's birthday and hence we were longing for the treat which she actually gave in d-den.. So we were a group of us.. and we ordered pizza, momos, babycorn, cold drink and hookah.. Now the price is quite reasonable over here.. Ofc I won't say cheap but the price is really reasonable not that extravagant at all but it lacked in ambiance. Prompt service ,awesome music and  friendly staffs really made a good combination.

Was introduced to this place by a friend of mine. Went there twice. It is really like a hidden gem, quite difficult to find if you don't already know about it. I was surprised when I had first entered here. The place was actually nice. We were five people and we availed the happy hour offer, which was buy one get one free on hookah. Coal change was only ‚Çπ30 each from the second one. But during the second time they told us that the happy hour offer was limited for up to three people per hookah but as we did not know and they hadn't told us about it earlier they did not say anything. We did not try their foods though. The place has nice atmosphere with good music. A fine place to hang out. Plus totally pocket friendly üòä. A must visit.

One of the worst places.
People choose places for hospitality, restaurants are all about serving in good way. The staff behavior is so bad as if they are serving for free. 
I am so disgusted with the behavior of the staff that I'm sitting here and writing the review. I'm going to write about this in my BLOG as well.
There are offers written in the chalkboard but they are saying not available, then they say we have to order the shisha which is more expensive as we are four people or else we have to take 2 shishas, what will we do with 2 shishas? And if they don't provide 1 shisha for 4 people then how are they allowing the costlier one? Lame very lame.
So Sorry but NOT AT ALL RECOMMENDED!

One of the best kind cafe located near regal cinema. Service was very slow might be because of the crowd. Food was really good we have tried veg fried momo,Hakka noddle,wai wai,pizza and juices. Decor is nice and based on dark theme. Overall a good place to hangout but was too smoky because of the hookah and I don't like hookah remaining everything was good enough to give a try.

This cafeteria is not located far from the Esplanade Metro Station...I visited it on the 31st first night with my girl and a few friends..

Pros :- 1.Sufficient Seating Area spread over 2 floors ¬†2.Innovative Decor ¬†3.Good staffs and good service

Cons :- 1.Food Quality is pretty average ¬†2.Did not find much sophisticated crowd at all and some of you might not want to visit this one for that particular reason 3.Prices are on the higher side compared to the quality as well as quantity 4.Defeaning music and brothel type (sorry to say the truth) ¬†ambience which did not go down well with me at at all ¬†5.Uncomfortable seating area.

What we had :- 1.Crispy chilli baby corn (Wasnt crispy at all...tasted very very ordinary)

2.Fish Fingers (Tasted good...the dip also tasted good)

3.Sex on the beach hookah (A combo of approx 4-5 flavours but one I did not like at all)

Visit recommended purely depending upon your choice after reading the cons...

Now this is a place to rock..

The wall graphiti

The food

The aroma

The snooker table 

The white curtains 

The pink and blue lighting all adds up the mood of being free again.

The mocktails are classy .

Okay I dnt knw why I visited this plce, not at al recommended. Food was worst no taste at all, it was like they have given us the already cooked food coz we had order crispy baby corn and it was not at all crispy, then we ordered chilly chckn which was  okay added to tht they serves the worst hookah I guess, but they were very cooperative price is also not high it is very cheap.  
The decoration of 2nd floor was awsome I must say is was the best decoration I have seen  in any other hookah parlours, but in this busy area atlst there is a hookah parlur which is quite good üòä

Definitely not recommended. No salt, no seasoning. A novice can make better hookah's than the staff......
They have their dishes based on their frozen food quantity. Nevertheless , either they should recognise their mistakes or they should close the place. Waste of money and food

This cafe is located at Esplanade near Regal Cinema, and the place is located inside a colonyBeing a not fan of hookah, I've been to this place. The place is kind of different. They've good seating arrangement.

But the thing in this place doesn't have, is a bit of improper services. Yes, if you're a hookah fan, then you might face some problems regarding asking for coal and proper equipment.
They offers good combos which somewhat they try to be pocket-friendly (good for a group)
Even though with proper seating arrangements, good quality of food and hookah, this place needs to be equipped well and put more concern regarding prices. Nevertheless, it's okay to visit but then it might be disappointment for non-hookah fans.

Being located in the interiors of New Market area beside Regal Cinemas, we had a little tough time finding this place. This is located in the first floor of the building. The second floor of this cafe is beautifully decorated. Try grabbing a seat there. Also they have a big private room for private parties( bookings to be taken a week earlier).
The behaviour of the staffs and the manager is really good and friendly. While entering the building my friend and I were a little shocked as it was very clumsy. But the moment we entered the cafe, our views changed.

Coming to the what we ordered :

Pan freezer flavour hookah. ( Great hookah)
Italian chicken pizza.( highly recommended )
Cheese Balls. ( Could have been a better.)
Mocktails. ( Bartender's choice)
Chicken thin crust pizza. (Extremely tasty.)

Over all a good place to hangout with your friends as the place is pocket friendly.

I have been to this place just once till now. I had been there for a friend's birthday party. Well,the good things were that they had a special place for big groups as well as for couples. The ambience was really nice nd cool,totally perfect for hookah. Good interior and really good place on a whole. Prices were reasonable and quality of food was really nice. Now for the cons,the hookah began to choke a lot aftr a few puffs. The coal finished way to fast and we had ended up changing them  more than a couple of times. The quantity of food was a bit less as compared to other places. On a whole, the atmosphere is nice but if u want to try hookah, I would suggest u to go someothere place. If u want to just relax and nd enjoy places nd restaurants with a cool ambience, then u can try this place.
P.s. I will be coming back to this place during the dunga puja in kolkata, because they will be opening a rooftop area also. So let's hope,they make it worth the wait.

They actually need to work hard on their services . The service staff have no idea what is happening . The manager behaves as if he is paying our bill,  half of the items were not available and service was very slow. Not only us but the table near us was also feeling so hot . The hookah didn't have smoke and when we complained we were told yahan aisa hi banta hai . Dude buck up or there is no business for you in the city

No one to take order after asking for menu it was given after 10 min (hookah) after asking for food menu they were no chef in the kitchen to cook food so no food !!!!!!
So we order hookah  after few min they switch of the ac so we started sweating 
We asked for bill even when we pay the amount no one bother to pick them up so we left .

This is one of the worst hookah place i have ever been to. First of all, the location is so bad and the place just doesnt look right. Secondly, when we entered, they were having some birthday party which were booked. It was really packed and we were seated near the door. We did not like the seat. Thirdly, i find the decorations nothing special. The blue lights, to be honest, gave me a headache and hurted my eyes. Fourthly, they played such loud hindi songs that i could not even hear anything else but the songs itself. Fifthly, they took quite a long time to get our stufts. I know they were busy but they had other customers too. The hookah was fine. I ordered a green apple mojito and it was too sweet. The mint leaves were not even crushed properly. I did not like anything about this place and i would never ever go there. Just pathetic place.

Baby corn was grt

They are new in town, but I don't think they can go for long in this very competitive market.
Quite expensive, compared to the location 
Main reason of disgusting sisha is, who take a single flavour sisha? 
U have to please the customer rather the customer should adjust with you. 
Will move to better cafe rather always

Visited this lounge today afternoon. The location is just opposite to Regal Cinema. The ambiance is absolutely amazing with beautiful decoration. The music is good too and they even play your favorites on request. We ordered their cheese chicken barbeque pizza, fresh lime soda and cold coffee. The service by Pritam was extraordinary and he was very cordial too. The pizza tasted amazing and the beverages were refreshing too. This lounge can be thought for great parties, reunion or get together.

Nice place. Good decoration. Lights are awesome. Crowd is not that much. Maybe because its new. But still its fine. Ambience is superb. Ordered for one brain freezer strong one. Hookah was good but was not that strong. Still smoke was dense for a long time. Overall a good experience. Hoping to visit this place once again.

This place is situated right oppo to regal cinema.Its very new in the chain of hookah lounges and cafes we have in town.

Decor wise I simple loved the place,as it has lots of wall art and graphitti ,its a 2 storey sisha cafe serving to different clientele. Spacious to accommodate large groups and couples alike. 1st storey is more for large groups and the 2nd storey has shamiyana type seating for couples. Lighting is nice with a tad bit of the low side which I think is perfect for sisha lounges,too much light kills the whole feel of it.¬†Ambiance well keeping in mind the locality you will find a mix crowd ,so deal with it,because that's how it is everywhere.Music is something I would request to upgrade.

Food is nice not bad but there's room for improvement alongside sisha variety needs to be added,which I think with time will be done as this is very new and there's always room for improvement.

It pretty easy on the pocket on the pocket,thus worth a try for people who are there around the corner.

I wont even thnk of gng to ths place next tme..served me the worse of worst shisha.(On complaining tht the hookah is not smooth,the hookah maker says "smoke toh aarah h üòÇüòÇ )
Sugar floating down in the mocktails.(Even aftr rectification,they couldnt dissolve the sugar out.)
Note : Its like a bunch of kids and highly unprofessionals are managing ths cafe.
Never ever go to ths place and regret later.

More like chandni bar.. One of the cheapest and shady places you can visit. Food sucks. They can't make hookahs, I mean literally they can't put together a hookah. Ambience is gloomy, n staff r not properly trained. Save ur money n spend it someplace else.
