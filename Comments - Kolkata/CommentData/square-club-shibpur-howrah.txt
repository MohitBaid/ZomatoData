It is an awesome takeaway food joint at Howrah at amazing prices. We had ordered 1 plate of dry chilli chicken, 1chicken fried rice, 1 plate mixed hakka noodles and 1 plate chicken manchurian. The quantity of this much food in good enough to serve 4 people ar ease.  The sides had 8 large pieces of chicken each. The food quality was also good enough to satiate your taste buds.  The overall price was only 540 which is quite affordable. Only thing that needs to be improved is the timely delivery.

Nice food. I had butter roti, chicken tikka masala and hariyali chicken kabab... Kabab was amazing. Roti was huge, so order one if u wanna eat 2...lol i liked the chicken dish also but chicken was pretty tough, and the too much oil. All over a good experience. Pretty good quality food and also pretty cheap... So enjoy.

One of the only places in Howrah that offers good takeaway services.. Their delivery is the best thing.. 

The food is quite good too... Their chicken cheese roll is a must try. One of their best Indian dishes would be Chicken Tikka Masala.. That thing is mind blowing.. Their Aachari Tangri is great too.. The biryani is not too good but they makeup for that in the Fried Rice segment.. 

Allover a great place to order from if you've some guests visiting you or even for any type of get together..

We ordered food from this place for dinner today. Firstly, when they asked about the time, we said 7:30pm but they themselves said they will deliver by 8pm. Still they were late by over an hour.
We ordered Egg Fried Rice, Thai Chicken in Red Pepper, Lemon Fish and Garlic Fish. The chicken and garlic fish was nice. The lemon fish had lemon slices on top and hence got a bit bitter. 
Its not authentic Chinese, but an indian version of Chinese. Quantity is good though.

Once I ordered chicken biriyani for home delivery and they didn't give the chicken in it. I called them up and complained about it. They apologized for there mistake and next day they sent us a plate of chicken biriyani to compensate.

I placed the order for hunan chicken after confirming from them that it woukd be spicy... Bt unfortunately the chicken was not spicy at all instead it had a very mild taste.. The quantities are decent so was the taste and tge staffs at the counter were helpful too..just wish they have a better idea of the dishes they serve... Will definitely order some indian cuisine from here..  Given the puja rush, they were really quick in their service...overall a good experience...

Heard about this simple yet sophisticated restaurant from a close friend of mine, have been trying to set foot there ever since amidst my busy schedules. Interestingly I was searching today for a take-away counter for dinner, noticed that 'Square Club' provides home-delivery too. And I went on ordering the following items:
1. Fish Zombie -as appetizer (delicious vetki fish tossed in a good numbers of herbs and spices)
2. Shanghai fried rice (medium spicy fried rice with generous amount of egg scrambles, minced chicken and prawn)
3. Square Club special chicken (medium spicy chicken gravy item with lots of bell peppers in it)

Items tastes good. Especially the starter. But I must bring up one thing to the restaurant management- cook/fry prawns properly if you are not using fresh day-by-day prawns; otherwise they losses their 'inherent taste'.

Apart from that small glitch, a really good restaurant to eat out. Will visit in person sometimes soon to try their other delicacies.

Probably the best Biryani joint available.. once they were specialist about it and used to have 5-6 variety in their daily course. I tried most of them, and I must say all were quite unique.  Now, they offer you to order food from multi-cuisine  menu card. I didnt anything except Mughali cuisine till time, eventhough I have been ordering food from them for more than 2 years now.
Anytime, I plan to try something different, I end up ordering more Mughlai food. Couldnt get rid of their mouth-watering kababs, Byriani, Mutton/ chiecken dishes easily. Its a must try, if you are in town.

Food quality is OK not very good but worst time management, you order for food and it will take more than 2 hours for delivery. Which is like unprofessional. Half of the menu is not available, always. Sometimes you order for Biryani and it might come with only rice and no chicken/mutton. It has happened with me once.

So as part of service they can get 5 out of 5. Great on time delivery. As part of food quantity it is a pro. If you order 2 plate of lucknow biriani that can serve the purpose for 3 of you. But they need to improve the food quality. They rolls are really good. I heard many good things about this place. But a bit disappointed with the quality. May be it was expectation, which was too high. But they are really new in this field and we should encourage them, hope they will step up their quality. Best wishes for Square club.

Also given the order for Drums of Heaven but later on they informed me they are not able to give that. Portion is Good specially the Kebab. Quality is also good. Reasonable pricing. Will definitely try their chinese section in future. One request they should give bit of more salad with Kebab.

Ordered veg Hakka noodles and chilli paneer for dinner and was surprised by their speedy delivery as I was battling with hunger that night. The Hakka came in huge quantity but the quality was a little shabby as it looked like boiled noodles with a few veggies tossed in and stirred in oil. The paneer tasted great but the restaurant was stingy in its proportion of the paneer. The cost was moderate and I also got it delivered for free.

This probably isn't the best place to have veg food unless you are terribly hungry.

We opted for home delivery of lunch from this restaurant. They had warned us that it would take them 1-1.30 pm to deliver, since they open at 11 am. However, they were a little to early for dinner; the food arrived at 3.30. There wasn't much to complain about in the food itself. Considering the price, we more or less got what we had expected. The wantons were quite a delight. If they had been a little more punctual, I would consider ordering in more often from this place. But, I'm not ready to risk another battle with hunger.

We opted for home delivery of lunch from this restaurant. They had warned us that it would take them 1-1.30 pm to deliver, since they open at 11 am. However, they were a little to early for dinner; the food arrived at 3.30. There wasn't much to complain about in the food itself. Considering the price, we more or less got what we had expected. The wantons were quite a delight. If they had been a little more punctual, I would consider ordering in more often from this place. But, I'm not ready to risk another battle with hunger.

Beware people..when they started off...they were one of its kind restaurant in the area and the food quality was very impressive.. Prompt response and delivery,variety of North Indian and Chinese dishes, and educated staff..however, like all good things don't last,this one is also on its way down,menu options drastically reduced,food quality deteriorating with every passing day..rude behaviour of the staffs,drunk owners..this is one restaurant which seems is on its way down..I'm really sorry to write this as I liked their food before..I just hope they get back on track and rectify themselves.. Wishing them all the best..!

Well I don't have much ideas regarding the restaurants near shibpur area. But this is the one from where I have ordered several times for home delivery. Tried afgan chicken tandoori, awadhi biriyani and chicken bharta from Indian dishes. In Chinese i have tried egg fried rice, chilli chicken, Thai soup, chicken drums of heaven. Each of the items were moderate in taste, quality and quantity wise they are even good.

Still waiting to try the biriyani.... As heard from friends they make some awesome preparation.
But unfortunately when I tried there was no indian dish. So I went for Chinese.
The egg chicken fried rice was really good but along with that they suggested Thai Chicken which was not at all good. Too much cornflour... Not tasty.
Looking for Indian next time.

Well finally got a chance to try biriyani. Yes it's good n tasty. But some how I am not liking the side dishes much. I took chicken bharta but it was not so good to mention about. No doubt biriyani was really nice.

A real hidden gem in howrah..Truely affordable..It's basically a takeaway counter but it offers both Chinese & North Indian cuisine.. I had afghan tandoori,Mutton nawabi Biriyani,Butter naan,chicken tikka butter masala,reshmi & hariyali kebab..The biriyani was not oily & kebabs were really appetizing..

A new take away counter is introduced in our locality named "Square Club". It is located near Chakraberia police station. Well decorated,but small in area. Photos of different mouth watering cuisines are hanging on the wall. I ordered Zafrani chicken Kebab in starter. There were 6 large boneless pieces.  The taste is so yummmm. I felt like it would be better if i ordered another plate. And also ordered Butter Chicken. They serve Indian as well as Chinese. The attendant was there also well behaved. A must try platter they serve is little boy platter. Next time i will must try that dish.

Yesteday I placed an order for four of us by calling Square Club. It was chinese cuisine. The food was delivered on time as was asked. The quality of the dishes was better compared to the others in the league in and around Ramrajatala. But the most pleasing was the 'follow up n get feedback' mantra on the restaurant part. This do give a value to the 1st time experience and obliges us to order more and more.

Pujas are the rush period for eateries all over the city and how the eateries fare snd cope with the pressure is an important parameter. Going by that, the eatery simply fails as it deluvered very late (2 hrs) and the food tasted just about ok and it was cold. On non- puja days they fare better, the food tastes better and the service is more careful. However, there are few good eateries close to my place around a 2km radius and this would rank amongst one of the good ones.

Needs improvement in service.
The food is quite good but not much in quantity. You have to wait longer than expectation to get what you ordered. The price is little higher if compared with it's neighboring outlets but the food is undoubtedly delicious. Overall this place is worth visiting if you want to gobble tasty food with reasonable price.

Thanks a ton to zomato for listing this restaurant over here. This is because square club is the the nearest joint from my place which took place in zomato. I heard the name of it but delayed to visit there. Anyways, its better late than never :)
I was quite surprised to see such a modern and smart looking take away in my area. I ordered chicken tikka kabab and my favorite chicken hariali kabab. Awesome quality I must tell you ! The pieces of chicken were very soft. The behavior of the counter guy(he might be the owner) was very adorable. I've become a weekend visitor after my first sight. 
Thousand cartoons of good wishes and love for square club..
