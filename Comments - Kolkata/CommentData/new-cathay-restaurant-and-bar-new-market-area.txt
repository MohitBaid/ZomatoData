It's been quite a long time since I visited this place. The gloomy ground floor makes this place feel a bit shoddy but once you make your way up to the 1st floor, the ambiance is something to look forward to.

We visited in a group and were accommodated nicely. The place had more customers than I imagined it would during the afternoon hours and yet it didn't feel crowded. Although, the place kinda feels a bit lulling. We ordered an array of dishes like New Cathay Chowmein, Chicken Fried Rice, Singapore Noodles, American Chopsuey, Chilli Baby Corn, Chicken Manchurian, some Fresh lime sodas and other beverages. The dishes were quite generic to be honest but it wasn't a letdown. 

The staff were attentive but later on their behavior felt a bit rude when they literally demanded a bigger tip. Apart from that little hiccup, the whole experience was good enough.

Located in a very posh location near Grand hotel on Chowringhee road. I‚Äôve been ghere couple of times. my first experience was very good where we had chelo kebab etc. second experience was poor with dry chilli chicken and chelo kebab and beer. nithing to say much about this restaurant as it is very ordinary. only if the cleanliness could be improved would have gone a long way in betterment of the restaurant

This restaurant is located close to Grand Hotel in Esplanade, and is spotted to the left on your way to Park Street. The restaurant has dimly lit interiors , with a ground floor seating that resembles coffee house , and an air conditioned area on the first floor. The service here is adequately quick , and the staff are courteous. A nice place to grab a drink over some adda with friends , in the heart of the city .

In The Food space.. I have the utmost respect for two types of Restaurants.. Stand alone places that have survived the test of time, and Restaurants that boast of dishes that are off the beaten path.. Imagine my joy in finding a place that ticks both these Boxes..‚ÄúNew Cathay‚Äù is one such place in Kolkata (In The Hotel Oberoi Grand Building, right next to the Hotel‚Äôs main gate). This third generation Restaurant has been housed in the same premises for the past 70.. I repeat.. 70 years !!! The d√©cor may not be much to write about, but the Food‚Ä¶ different story altogether. Apart from a regular Indian and Chinese Menu (I am told by my foodie friends that the Chinese Food and the desi Chicken Curry is delicious) they have quite a few interesting items that they serve.. I had the ‚ÄúFried Chicken‚Äù (which is served with lime and their inhouse masala powder).. then we went on to ‚ÄúFish Liver Gin‚Äù, and their Version of the ‚ÄúChelo Kabab‚Äù. Although Peter Cat is the first name that comes to mind when one thinks of Chelo Kabab‚Äôs, but, New Cathay‚Äôs is a must try. All in all, some great food.. NOTE : In my humble opinion, an iconic place that has been in business for 70 years is above anyone's rating.. but, have given it a 5, being the highest possible rating.

Surprisingly, this joint is pretty good or some moderately priced booze and average food. The location is extremely approachable- just below the Oberoi Grand hotel. And, if you visit in the evening, go for their mutton Burrah kebab. Its juicy and brilliant. Pro tips: on a good day, call the chef and ask for his suggestion for kebabs. Invariably, he'll suggest this one only and then you go for it. Trust me, it can give many a renowned ones a run for their money. The chilly shrimp is also pretty filling and quite good. Overall, recommended.

If you enjoy old heritages which gives you a sporty feel too..then is a must visit . The ambience is good..they always keep the sports channel on and ppl seat with beer and their favorite snacks or munchies. And enjoy the moment. The staffs are good . Can do a better hospitality. Seating arrangement is kinda old decor. They keep water bottles on every table . Thats kinda awkward. The green  veg soup was not that worthy. But the noodles were good and the ginger chicken was also worthy. We wanted chicken stagnoff..but they couldn't serve it at that time due to some problem. Easy on pocket.  Located under grand archade..if you are visiting new market then give it try.

I used to visit this bar in my college days . Recently I visited this bar & find it decent.¬†
Downstairs can accommodate around 50 peoples & non ac. Upstairs can accommodate small lives & have ac. Both side TV is very small considering their size. Wine price is very cheap considering location. Food menu is large & lot of variety is there. It is quite strange that each plate having huge quantity & sufficient for 2-3 people. No half plate. Better to go there as gang. Restaurant & wash rooms are cleaned & interior is ok. Good for family. Crowds looks decent & less noisy.
Only food quality could have been better.

Went there recently...felt like if Coffee House ever decided to design a modern bar around 2005, New Cathay is exactly what you get...See 2005 ?? Yes , thats is because its not exactly 2016 inside.Thats absolutely fine by me. The waiters are dressed in a proper attire which is always a plus. The service was quite nice as well. Loved the chicken platter, and the shrimp dish. Cant recall the name. The Chicken Kasturi Kebab was made with a 'dashboard' of salt instead of a pinch. It felt like licking a rock from the Dead Sea, however if the cook is a little less generous with the salt , the dish does have plenty of potential I must say. I have heard the Mutton Kakori Kebab is also a delicacy there, will try it next time. The Tutti-Fruity ice cream had fruits which were sour. Not complaining though, it was okay. 

Overall a nice place , will visit again. Soon

The food is really good and comes in huge quantity. I love their Chicken 65 and the fish finger. The price of the drinks is pretty decent compared to similar bars and the service and cordial behaviour of the staff are big advantages. A good place to be for post-work beer sessions.

Whenever I go to Calcutta, I make it a point to visit New Cathay. During the days at Kollata,  I used to prefer this place more than Olypub or regular bars of Park Street. This place has it's own essence which is mostly of the old Calcutta. 
I like to have beer accompanied by chilli chicken at this place. Finger fish and the fries,  accompanied by Tartar sauce is also one of my favourites. From the main course I choose noodles and a chicken dish. They make great chicken stroganoff. 

The waiters are working there for long and I have few known waiters whom I love. They take care of me and my preferences. Such is the care that remind me atleast for once if I tend to have beers more than 3 or 4.

Cheers and love to New Cathay.

The rating would have definitely gone higher had their hospitality been upto the mark. Whatever we requested them to do, we got a point blank no. Example 1: We requested them to keep the bottle of beer in the refrigerator so that it does not become warm while we consumed the first half of the bottle. The answer was a no, and this was a first for us when a restaurant could not help us with such a petty thing. Example 2: We ordered for Fish Finger, I will come to the taste bit later, and asked for extra tartar sauce and was again outrightly refused. This was a first as well.

Now coming to the food: We ordered Chicken 65 and Fish Finger. Both were good. Fish Fingers were really soft and juicy, and was one of the better fish fingers I have had in recent times. The french fries accompanied with the fish were not your usual fries, and we enjoyed it. The tartar sauce was on point as well. The pricing is fair, and the look of the restaurant is straight out of a 1970s hindi movie. 

I would not recommend this place to anyone for whom hospitality is as important as the food.

i cant add any star because of its a male chauvinist restaurant. before going there you have to aware of your gender to order any hard drinks. they dont serve alcohol to female customer. because female customers are CARELESS. a stupid waiter said me so. and they mean it. they ask you to show age proof id cards. but but but... they dont ask any male guy for any age proof. if u go with your male partner then they will allow you to serve alcohol. a very ridiculous mentality. but food is good.

Heard a lot about the Restaurant so planned a visit but did not get an opportunity to taste the food. Yes, the service was that bad.

If you tell them you need a table for 3, the answer is ‚Äúwhere ever you get place........‚Äù

After you look for a place for yourself and sit. They will come and tell you ‚Äúthe table is for a bigger group, look for a different Table‚Äù. In a place, were you can hardly find any unreserved table.

In Short what they mean, it‚Äôs the customer‚Äôs job to run around in the restaurant and find a place for them and if they don‚Äôt then, just get lost.

Though it is not completely your fault but you need to ‚ÄúSWITCH OFF‚Äù your panic bottom when you have a large number to serve.

Hidden in plain sight in the facade of the Oberoi Grand Hotel is this quaint but quite memorable pub. 
       It is located just beside the Oberoi Grand gates towards the new market side. Having heard about it on zomato and by word of mouth, we decided to give it a try on a soggy Saturday evening.
       The interior is quite spacious and it has a 2nd storey which is air conditioned. The air conditioned section was full so we had to settle for the ground floor. We thought it would be mighty uncomfortable but the age-old suspended ceiling fans gave us a run for our money. The crowd inside was a sophisticated one.
          The booze is relatively cheap here and the options are aplenty. You just have to ask for a drink and they have it. The service is proompt.
           For food we sampled Chicken Malai Kebab, Tandoori prawn, and on the request of the chef - Mutton Kakori Kebab. The Malai kebab was fantastically done with the chicken just the right amount of tender and infused with the right spices. The kakori kebab was another highlight with the mutton just falling off the bone. The tandoori prawns were in the right place but i feel they could've been done better.
         Overall we were pretty impressed with the place. They also serve Chinese and Continental which i am planning to go back for.
         It is a good alternative to Fairlawns if you find it full.

Dropped in for lunch. It has two sections, Non-Ac has more seating capacity compared to the AC section on the upper storey which is very cosy.

Under the bourgeois charm of Oberoi Grand, you'll find the shallow entrance of this place...

I used to be a regular when in College... After Olypub increased its price, this place happened to be a oasis to us, the serious alcohol lovers...

This is a full fledged restaurant and bar... So, if you are from a sophisticated domestic background, you'll possibly find this place entertaining your bowels as well as your tastebuds...

Enjoyed sumptuous meals with brandy (as I was suffering from a sore throat)...

Would recommend... Obviously...

A hidden gem in literal sense, this age old bar cum restaurant is located near Grand Hotel in Chowringhee area hidden amongst the footpath hawkers merchandises. It has a pretty vintage feel in the original ground tier section but on a hot summer day one may feel a little uncomfy to seat under generation old huge fans. For them they have a air conditioned upper tier , relatively new. We were looking for some finger foods to go along with booze and opted for Chicken 65 apart from the normal namkeen which they serve along with the Bud and Tuborg we got. Excellent cooking. Tender pieces of chicken, very well balanced taste, the dry chillis were adding a separate zing and the bell peppers, onions were saucy and crispy at the same time. Service is fast enough but like most of the old bars the waiters suffer from same no smile syndrome which makes u reluctant to call them. Overall a nice place.

This place was suggested by a friend. Though it's placed in the heart of esplaned, I haven't noticed it for a long time. The place is famous for cheap booz nd cozy ambiance. They had a big screen as It was IPL season.
Now the food! For starters we had Tandoori Prawn, Chicken Malai Kabab and Fish liver Gin . For main course we had Egg Fried Rice and Chilly Chicken.

The Prawn was very tasty it was one of the best dish we had there. The Chicken was okeish. Now this Fish Liver Gin was something new. The whole buttery Garlicy flavour was very delicious. It's a must try (if you'r having booz). The Egg Fried rice was really good bt I didn't like the Chilly Chicken much. The portions were good. Staffs were really good.

Not that I like this place very much, but whenever I am somewhere around Esplanade, somehow I end up being there.
Quality of food is average. I used to like their 'Fish finger with french fries' a lot, but it has lost its quality, probably the chef has been replaced? Nonetheless, quantity of food is pretty great.
And the most annoying fact is that sometimes they serve not-so-chilled beer. I have beed told quite a few times that they are running out of chilled beer and you have to drink whatever they have in store. That's pretty annoying considering the fact that Beer tastes like piss when it's warm.
Another astonoshing fact is that the waiters are more eager to take orders of drinks only. When it comes to ordering some food, they starts to behave in a nonchalant way.
Nonetheless, it's a pretty good place to visit considering the price and all.

I have been very frequent visitor to this bar cum restaurant. Location is under the grand hotel besides puma shop. Food price is on a higher side. But the best thing is carlsberg or kingfisher beer are served in the company's glass. Alas! nothing such for tuborg though. The place has the look of an old look with large hanging fans, a/c section is on the upstairs. Grab a beer and sink in your thoughts or have adda with friends.

I have been here quite a few times. The beer is comparatively cheap here and the ambiance is soothing. The food is a bit costly. I wish smoking was allowed in the bar area.

Ambience holds the taste of olden days.. With a big hall and tables along with proper chaires scattered in it. The silence and darkness seems to bring solitude for the drinker but then..u can never complain about their food. Try and have Chicken Vegetable, it tastes really awesome and for better taste add a couple of spoon of chilli vinegar and pepper to it. It's really light yet filling. The cost is not really low but u can always split bills with your friends.

This place holds a special place in my heart. It's one of those quirks in your life, you happen to be thrown into a circumstance and you simply walk into a restaurant without any foreknowledge.
At the very onset, let me tell you this isn't a place to impress your gf/wife with. A shady and gloomy den to accentuate the melancholia in you as you indulge in chilled beer and of course chilly chicken.
I haven't tried out so much here to do justice while I rate this place. Egg fried rice and golden fried prawns are the other things you must try here.

The quantity is amazing and so is the taste. The price of the alcohol is welcoming and not prohibitive. Don't compare it with high end restaurants. It's light on the pocket and very satisfying though. This is the place to be in when the friends you bank upon cancel their plans to go out with you

Carry your own music and the trip is completed. It's like you have entered an old world where time has stood still - you will only understand if you be here.

Update: this time the music played here was reminiscent of the 90s. Also jazz and blues. Chicken 65 is another delight.Another thing the main area in the ground floor doesn't have AC. In the upper floor are the seats for family with AC.

An old all day bar cum restaurant situated at the heart of Kolkata on the iconic Oberoi Grand arcade.
Food here is very good and if you want a quick beer or a drink with some quality starters at reasonable pocket pinch then this is the place.
Fish liver gin is an unique preparation here.
Dry chilly prawn is made differently here but tastes great and is accompanied with boiled green peas.
Red pepper chicken is also well made.

Visited this place with friends last month. A good place to have a drink with your friends. Waiters are responsive and polite. Did not know about the AC section, had to sit in the non-AC area. Ordered chili chicken and Butter naan. Chili chicken was OK, Butter naan is a little over priced. Food is just okay. Ambiance is good. If you are going for a drink or two , this is the place for you.

After a hectic week, when you are tired and stressed enough there should be a place where you can release your fatigue with the people you trust and love to hang around.
New Cathay is kind of a place where you can actually do that. This place has a old school architecture which will attract you the most. The ambience was superb and the hospitality was also pretty good.
We took a plate of Crispy Chicken as a starter and nothing can suite better than this while drinking. It was bit spicy which can actually set the mood and the quanitity was also very good.
For the main course we have ordered Mixed noodles along with Schwezuan Chicken to light up our tastebuds more. Both were standard however I felt that the noodles could be better. I would also like to mention please order according to your appetite because the quanitity is really very good.
It is a cheap place in terms of drinking and beverages as well. If you are roaming around maidan, esplanade area and want to have some good food along with drinking, this place will certainly provide you the options of doing that.

One day me n my friends had been searching for a place to have lunch n also something to wash it down with, when we spotted a small door which one of my friends had spotted. We went in to check it out n immediately were transported back in time!!! The overall ambience has the old Calcutta feel. The food is delicious n the drinks are also reasonable enough. After that first day, we have become regulars. Even after leaving the city in pursuit of a living, I still visit this place every time I go back to have a hearty reunion with my dearest pals.

I've never ever seen this restaurant ever, in my 20 years ¬†of life spent running up and down "Grand side-walk"! Suggested by a fellow foodie, my Mamazi, I went in the easy to miss door only to find myself in a massive restaurant. There are two sections,a non-air conditioned and a small air conditioned one, on the floor above! Now, the staircase and the view from their veranda towards the non-AC restaurant instantly wins your heart,with the old-school feel.. It's beautiful.¬†
Coming to the food, It's essentially a bar-cum- restaurant! The selection of beer available is just fine. Coming to the food part of it, we started with Dry Chili Chicken, which was delicious, big win. The Fish Finger were juicy,moist cooked fish and crispy batter and the butter sauce was yummmm!! It was finger lickin' good!! The Crispy Chili Baby Corn smelled so yummy in someone else's table, we ended up ordering it! It was just the way I like it, with crunchy spicy corns. The Hakka Mixed Noodles was a great dish with fenugreek leafs and the shimp and the meat was neat and well cooked.¬†
Though the price is on the higher side in case of this restaurant, but It is delicious itself!¬†

Had to say i liked it very much ... coming straight to important points :
> there are two section - upstairs(AC) and downstairs(NON AC) - I personally liked the downstairs a lot as it had a Old kolkata feel with wooden cushioned chairs and long fans hanging - it had two LCD TVs which played sports.
Upstairs is a medium sized hall with LCD TV playing Bollywood movies - mainly 4 seater tables - newly made - nothing different from other restaurants - but its good.
Note : if you are a couple you can use both upstairs and downstairs without any issue as crowd is generally good.
> Drinks - menu provided here in Zomato is right , only thing is upstairs with cost you RS 10 more . However they have multiple offer going - like we had Smirnoff at RS 15 off per 60ml peg.
> Food - really good but nothing fantastic - but quantity is huge. Like we ordered chilly prawn which cost around RS 290 and it was sufficient to serve 4 people and tasted extremely good.¬†

In short - its a lovely heritage restaurant to feel nostalgic as well as save money and spend quality time with your friends or Family.

We ordered golden fried porn and beer. The food was quite delicious. Just loved it. Ambience is another plus point of the restaurant. It has two floor - ground and 1st. 1st for the ladies. But the space is little bit small.
Overall if u have low budget and wanna have good food and booze with friends , just go for it.

Over the years I have identified particular eateries with a couple of dishes.Friends kind enough to read my reviews must have noticed my penchant for going back for those dishes when I visit a frequently visited eatery like Shiraz,Mahesh Lunch home,Peter Cat or Kake Da.

One of the first places I got drunk in was New Cathay.A century old,they used to carry remnants of the British in their menu and demeanour.Drinks were cheap and entire afternoon sojourns with your friends were not frowned upon.It was suitably dim with a TV just above the entrance door.

Being an Architect I had to visit the Kolkata Municipal Corporation frequently and on my way back loved the cool ambience of Cathay.My choice was the stewed rice with chicken.It was a bed of rice covered with a fabulous chicken stew prepared the Chinese way with succulent pieces of chicken and steamed vegetables.With a dash of chilli sauce this was a wholesome,filling and satisfying meal for me always as it was today.A fresh lime soda with it complements the food.Earlier they also served a pork sausage with mashed potato which was a hot favourite.Dont know whether they still serve it.But ladies and gentlemen,this is another Kolkata foodmark.

It's a bar cum restro hidden away under the grand hotel. One barely notices it while passing. We having had a terrible experience at fairlawns was searching for options and this sounded okayish. We opted for the ground floor as my foot was paining and I could not possibly have gone upstairs. 

Ambiance is a little bit shabby but then it obviously it's not one of the posh restros. 

Ordered two 3 Foster lager, one veg chow,one garlic chicken and one American chopsuey. 
They provide chanachur with the drinks which I liked. Chowmein was good quality wise and quantity wise. Garlic chicken consisted of 10 pieces of medium sized chicken with a lot of gravy. American chopsuey I did not like. Consisted of too much of tomatoes which marred the actual taste. My friends wanted antiquity to wash down the chopsuey. Such was its taste. Need I say anything more?
However service is good and so is pricing. 

Recommended if you want a booze session with your friends at low price. Not recommended for a second visit though.

New Cathay falls on the way towards the New Empire theatre along the Oberoi Grand hotel's pathway.

One of the oldest and the finest hub for getting together for fun. The food is absolutely delicious and the ambience looks simply awesome. It's the big brother to the Olypub you can say. It has an old vintage feel to it because if it's interiors.

The service is prompt and I love their sausages anytime any day.. I miss my visits when I used to live nearby and hope to turn up again as soon as I get the opportunity.

New Cathay is located below Grand Hotel and is probably one of the oldest of its kind in the area..Have visited this place a few months back with my friends..This is an ideal spot for tipplers where the alcohol is quite economical though I won't say they are precisely cheap..The moment you enter you will find smoke filled all over the place due to the heavy cigarette smoking..It is an old establishment which is eminent from its decor and and design and does not have any air-condition facility..there is only a small congested room upstairs which is mostly filled and chances of getting a seat is less..So keep this in mind while visiting this place..Though they serves some pretty decent food this place is essentially not recommended for any family visit,you will mainly find old drinker enjoying their poison..The service is not perfectly smooth and you have to call the servers repeatedly to take your orders..Among the food we tried Chicken Satay, Fish Tikka, Chicken65 and Dry Chilli Prawn..Food is average, nothing great in flavours,it is only with your booze that the food starts to taste better,typical syndrome..Anyways I have found the food to be priced a bit higher compared to the standards of this place..Our total cheque comes to Rs.2100/- for 3 including food and drinks..I would recommend the Chinese/Continental dishes over Indian ones as they are better in quantity..Overall it is one of those typical period Bars ore suited to silver-haired ones than the younger generations..Old times sake..

I've been to this place a lot with my better half. To start with, there are two divisions-one at the ground floor n d other at d first floor, d first floor one being a better option for friends n family. The food tastes good but the service is often delayed and hesitant. The quantity of food in a dish is more than enough for a person, especially if you are going for hard beverages with it.

Though the place is dated and there is nothing great to talk about the decorations, but the place is for perfect for a few quick afternoon drinks if you are in and around esplanade/new market area. I have not really explored through their entire menu chart. But i m a big fan of the chilli chicken dry they serve. Its just perfect companion for your beer. I have taken many friends along on several occasions, and all of them had only nice things to say. Oh, how i miss my college days.

In life as with restaurants you get what you pay for. If you want all the razmatazz and the bowing and scraping and you want eggs Benedict with Hollandaise sauce then this is not the place to go to. If you want cheap booze and decent filling food at very reasonable prices then toss the Hollandaise out the window and scurry on over.

Went here lots as a student, my staples here being chilly chicken, french fries, sandwiches and fish fingers. This place has a presence about it, whenever I walk its like I can imagine the ghosts of Kolkata past all seated around the tables drinking coffee and smoking charminars :).

A grt place to sit have a cold beer and finger food with friends at reasonable prices.

A restaurant cum bar, as it says. 
The prices have increased, of lately.
Suiting ambience. With background music at times.  Second floor is more decent. Speaking of food quality, haven't tried hell of a dishes here, but Fish Finger is worth trying. Other than that fried rice and chowmein are good too. I don't remember having bad taste here. Soft-spoken waiters.
Overall it's fine. :)

This restaurant is primarily a bar but they do offer flavorful indo Chinese food. I have never experimented much over here, always been formulaic and ordered dry chilli chicken with mixed gravy chowmein. Ordering the same dishes again and again (at least 4 times) does not always mean the lack of desire to experiment :). I liked the combination of gravy chow and chilly chicken over here so much that I never was able to convince myself to order anything else. The gravy chowmein is unlike what you have eaten in most chinese restaurants. It is a lot dryer than the normal ones. They make there own chowmein and it has a distinct taste of its own. One portion of chilly chicken contains 12-14 pieces which will surely win over your heart.

If you absolutely have to visit this place then there are a few tips for you.
1. Do not take a table in the ground floor if you are visiting with your family. It is the smoking section, and i personally avoid it. And the ground floor does not have air-conditioning.
2. The first floor however has air-con, but other than that, absolutely no redeeming features as per as decor goes.
3. Food is cheap, and so is the quality of food. but i recommend the Fish Liver Gin. It has 6 pieces of fried fish strips with veggies and is good for two.
4. Alcohol is dirt cheap, but I do not drink.
5. However do not drink like a fish since the toilet is another place that needs to be avoided. 
The place has immense potential, but sadly it lacks maintenance.

Well, This is an old bar cum restaurant located in Grand Hotel Arcade. Decor is ordinary nothing to be surprised. But I would like to say about some dishes which are really awesome
over here. I visited there few weeks ago with my gymming buddies to booz and dine. One of them is a old customer of this place so even chef "Rao" [ to whom we talked latter ] knows him well.
"Baked fish" and "Grilled fish" are two mind blowing dishes which a foodie must try but you should tell the waiter to make it "old style" not newly imported machine cut. Simply loved these dishes. Really just blew my test bud. In both dishes fish was properly cooked and it really comes with decent size. Easily two people can share one plate. "Fried chicken" was average. Also, enjoyed decent "cream of chicken soup". But I must say you just stay away from "kasturi chicken", though this dish was recommended by chef completely disappointed as it was too salty and too oily and out of taste. Pricing are decent and service is quick. Must try for foodies who love continental fish cuisines. I wouldn't mind to visit there couple of times more just for the fish :) !!

The restaurant is in the Grand Hotel Arcade which has degenerated into a stretch of road completely ruled and encroached by the unruly and chaotic hawkers, selling cheap goods and toys etc. In fact, me and my friends have avoided the place for this menace only but Cathay is a restaurant which is an oasis in this chaos.

As one enters through the heavy door, the old and stylish architecture and decor meets the eye and the dimmed illumination gives a soothing feel. The furniture is old school and comfortable and the best part is, they have a smoking area inside, at the back of the restaurant and they have very thoughtfully, placed a few comfortable chairs, ashtray and fans at this place. I do not remember seeing this kind of thoughtful action for smokers by any other similar category restaurant.

The starters and side dishes, particularly Chinese, remain tasty and spicy as before. The Continental is ordinary and the Indian is competent. However, if one wants to have a few cool beers and chat up with friends in and around New Market, this could be a good choice.

This is an update of my earlier review based on a recent visit with an old friend of mine.Ordered Indian dishes here for the first time.We were floored to say the least.We had the Schezwan Fish,Chicken Kasturi kebab,Mutton masala,butter naan,tandoori roti and Smirnoff Flavoured vodka to wash it down.¬†
Firstly the schezwan fish comprised of medium sized cubes of beckti sauteed in green,yellow and red bell peppper,onions and green chillied.It also had liberal amounts of siced garlic and julienne (slices) of ginger and carrot slices.Not very hot but had the right amount of spicy tang to it.Marvellous.The Chicken kasturi kebab was a modified version of tandoori chicken.The outer layer of the chicken had a pale green coating and the pieces of chicken were soft and juicy to the core.Delectable.The mutton masala had boneless pieces of mutton in a fiery red thick gravy of ginger garlic paste in vintage Mughlai style. Not very fiery as it looked.Thankfully the mutton was boiled to perfection-a rarity in most joints.The naan and the tandoori were served piping hot and fresh though not soft and flaky enough to my liking. Last but not the least, the Smirnoff Green apple flavoured vodka was the star of the meal.With a lingering fruity tinge to it, it was bliss to say the least.
Now the service.This was the first time in Kolkata that the chef came out to personally attend to us, enquire about the dishes and recommending what dishes to order.I mean who does that in a ordinary vintage joint? Such things happen only in star joints.The waiter was also attentive enough to fill up our glasses with drinking water-something i am very particular about.I have a habit of sipping water in between my meal.Overall a satisfying experience indeed at the fag end of the festive season on a weekday afternoon during lunch hours.The quantity and quality of the food is top-notch folks.Trust me on that. Seriously a hidden gem for the uninitiated.

On a recent visit with my cousin sampled their food fare during lunch hours.The place was relatively empty - a pleasant surprise from the mad rush outside.We tried out items like the fish tikka,american chopsuey and pepper chicken. The fish tikka was awesome, comprised of four decent sized cubes of soft,succulent fresh beckti.The fish had the right amount of smoky odour and not over burnt at all. The american chopsuey was decent enough and had the right mix of sweet and sour flavour. Chicken pieces were aplenty.Lastly the pepper chicken comprised of huge amount of shredded chicken.It was slightly spicy for me, but i quite enjoyed its fiery flavour. However some pieces of chicken were overcooked(fried in this case) and thus chewy.Service was attentive and courteous. Prices were pocket friendly as expected.

This joint was my favourite watering hole during my College days.I visited this place mostly after visiting the Book Fair at the Maidan. Yes, my attachment to this joint goes long back to the good old "Calcutta" days. Back then this place had its own share of loyal patrons and the tradition continues till today.In my recent visit after almost a decade, was pleasantly surprised.I mean what a relief and welcome change from the shabby interiors of most budget watering holes of Kolkata. People who belong to the Olypub, Chota Bristol,Mags circuit will surely know what i am trying to get at. Newly painted walls,tables adorning a table cloth-unthinkable in a budget joint, polite staff, dirt cheap  prices for booze and pretty impressive food menu at right prices. What more can one ask for ?
 Smirnoff Flavoured vodka-60 ml at Rs 125 says it all.We tried out the Fish Finger and the dry chilli chicken which were pretty well made.New Cathay serves good Chinese dishes and has built a pretty good reputation on this aspect.Thus the joint is also frequented by families and all women gangs regularly.They have an air-conditioned section on the first floor catering to families and women groups. Rowdy gangs and drunken brawls are a rarity,thus women would feel pretty safe visiting this place.And last but not the least the attractive location of Chowringhee/Grand Hotel Arcade is the icing on the cake.
Cheers!!!!!

P.S.:They do accept Credit Cards and  not an all cash outlet like Oly or Bristol.So that is a big bonus.

If your looking for a refined ambience and a sophisticated crowd then New Cathay is not a place to visit but its one of those places with what I call character .... its been around forever and I have spent many lovely evenings with friends filled with stimulating conversation and lots of laughter accompanied by very reasonably priced food and drinks.  
Amongst the starters the fish fingers , mutton or chicken cutlets , chicken liver on toast , cheese balls , chicken reshmi kebab and mutton potato chop are what we usually gorge on. In the mains ( we don't usually have room for the main course) my favourite is the chopsuey and chilli chicken with chicken fried rice. The sandwiches are also not bad. 
The thing about Cathay that I love is the atmosphere .... its not so much the food which is good but not great .... do keep that in mind when you visit and go with a bunch of friends. The First Floor is air-conditioned a few years back but unless its really hot I prefer to sit below , however most ladies would feel more comfortable upstairs.

A good place if you plan a light drink n lunch with friends...very economical and the food quality and quantity is good enough. I like the place upstairs since its usually less noisy and air conditioned. One of my favourites when im hanging around new market side.

You do not want to go any further from this place if you want to have a tipple and are in the Esplanade area. A friend of mine gave a treat there and the chinese cuisine was moth watering to say the least. the American Chopsuey and Prawn Chowmein are a must. The snacks menu is also delicious. The crowning gem of the place is the Bar, well stocked and without the Bar tax that many places take nowadays, it is fantastic. The snacks that come complimentary with the drinks are usually in good quantity. Also the atmosphere is nice for drinking and enjoying with friend. There's a perenially low crowd count, so you are sure to have the place to yourself. The service is prompt and the waiters are respectable. However the place doesn't have an ambience worth boasting and sometimes rowdy groups frequent it. Overall, a good place to eat and drink.

Chakraborty Tip : If you become a regular, they are sure to waive the VAT..

Mutton kakori kabab,Chicken kasturi kabab ,Prawn finger,Chilli garlic chicken chowmein....not to miss!!Huge quantity and very good quality. You won't expect that quality in that kind of ambience unless you try.As other said...precisely for stags,if you want to take family or girl friend then obviously for lunch...not dinner.Any gravy item can be served dry as per your request and you won't regret any single item !!

I went there a few years ago with my friends. The quality of chinese food is really good and the drinks are quite reasonable rather I will say chip with respect to other bars located nearby. But the atmosphere is very noisy. Its because of the crowd there. The service is also good and the staffs hold a good remark. Its a place definitely not to take your family with but you can go with your friends and hang out there easily. Mixed fried rice and chilli chicken were real good.

a heaven for economic stags. make sure u r a big group or at least 3 in number otherwise you will have a tough time finishing their dishes coz they give a hell lot. a satisfactory ambience in probably the most crowded part of the city. the dry chilli fish is a special mention along with the prawn pakora. however this is not a dine out location. purely for stags.

Drinks  are quite  reasonable out there but then again the  ambience sucks  .... crowd is very rowdy ,  if you  are  a  tippler then you can  go to this place , otherwise it is Not  a  Family joint ....  for stags only  ....  try  out  the fish items  on  the  menu  card which are decent  but overall a 50-50 from my side  that  is not  too bad but  not good either ...  go for a quick bite if  you  are around  new market but don't  take  any  female friends/ relatives with  you.... this  place is purely for stags
