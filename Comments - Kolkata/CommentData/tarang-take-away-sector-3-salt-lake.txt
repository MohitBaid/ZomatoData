This inconspicuous place serves decent food. We ordered a salt and pepper chicken and crispy fried sweet corn. The chicken was good. The portion of veggies was great which made up for the less crispy chicken. It was sweet in taste, not like salt and pepper though xD. Anyway the sweet corn portion was great. Good overall.

Worst Hospitality, prices are also pretty high. No A/C in that range of restaurant. Cashier is very rude ,no sense of hospitality. The only thing good about tarang is coffee related products. Food is good. In that price I would rather go to other restaurants.

Had visited yesterday evening. Ordered cold coffee and a plate of chicken momo. The coffee was awesome, much better than any expensive coffee joints and was priced just Rs 25. The momos were soft, juicy and well stuffed. We had ordered a take away parcel of Tarka. The tarka was delicious and sufficient for 2. Would visit again.

Worst place I've had food, plates were dirty.
The glass wasn't clean.
Chili chicken- chicken pieces were the size of marbles, the roti wasn't warm, tadka was too spicy to eat.
Don't waste your money here.

Tarang Restaurant, beside GD bus terminus

A sudden plan for lunch took us to Tarang Take-Away. It is a NON-AC restaurant with 20 people sitting and spacious with TV on the wall. No special ambiance but they serve multi-cuisine. Staffs are very polite and helpful. On 20th October, we ordered:

*Mixed Hakka noodles ‚Äì 1 plate 

*Mixed Gravy noodles ‚Äì 1 plate

*Cold drinks 

The quantity was good as well as the quality. I enjoyed the Hakka noodles because of slight burnt garlic flavour and gravy noodles means lots of veggies which we rarely get to eat in other restaurants but this Tarang‚Äôs gravy noodles was wow! Our bill was only 370/- ÔÅä

On 21st October, we planned a bro‚Äôs birthday so from Bake Club, GD Market bought a small chocolate cake and walked into Tarang and handed the cake to the staff and asked to make some arrangements. They are fabulous with their work. Then we ordered:

*Mixed Fried rice ‚Äì 4 plates

*Chicken Manchurian- 1 plate (8 pieces) 

*Garlic Chicken- 1 plate (8 pieces)

Proper amount of prawns, chickens and eggs were there. I loved the chicken preparations so the Chicken Manchurian was tangy, sweet & salty whereas Garlic Chicken was lil‚Äô Spicy and the chicken chunks were well coated and fried ‚ò∫ .Our bill was only 1070/-  ‚òª

And their refreshment was exceptional ÔÅä ‚ô•

NOTE PLEASE:

‚Ä¢ This restaurant doesn‚Äôt charge VAT/TAX services (we need to pay only the printed price for food)

‚Ä¢ Pocket-Friendly for Students ‚ô•

The only hotel in salt lake that can be compared to any food court at any shopping mall. The range of food they provide is mindblowing. Chinese, north Indian, South Indian, contemporary cuisines and even beverages and drinks like cold coffee are always available. Staffs n waiters are very good. The reaturant's name says its a take away kind but it does provide outdoor and indoor sitting.
Perhaps the only place in the area where one can get good south indian dishes. Vadas and masala dosas are decent enough. The best dish they serve here are crispy chicken and crispy paneer. They pack a punch of a bit spicy and savoury with a light kick of tangyness due to the sauces that are added. I never had enough of these dishes. Size of each portion is enough to fill one's stomach. Ambience is average as they lack in space for sitting and absence of air conditioning. But then again, you have the opion of taking away your orders and eat them at you convenience. Their traditional chinese dishes needs improvement though if you ask me. They tasted bland in comparison to those served elewhere.
But the latest addition of Italian cuisine is absolutely mind blowing! Au-Gratin, chicken Lasagne, creme of (something üòÖ) and Pizza!! Huge portions each of them.... all the italian dishes are loaded with cheese and they are exceptional. My favourite pizza here is Spicy Polo chicken. A Total paisa vasool restaurant!!! I strongly recommend this restaurant to whoever is reading this review.

Located near GD bus terminal,this take away counter is quite famous for its masala kulcha.We ordered the same from them.The masala kulcha is really a Must Try dish and Punjabi Chicken and Veg tarka which is quite decent.
I will like to give some extra point to Tarang for its On time delivery.
For me itz a good option for home delivery food for good price.

I have ordered food from this place quite a few times. Their dishes as far as Chinese is concerned , are quire reasonable and lipsmacking. 
Things which I had ordered and are a MUST TRY.  
1. Veg Hakka Noodles
2. Veg  Manchurian 
3. Chilli Paneer Gravy 
4. Singapore noodles
5. Potato and American corn in hot garlic sauce.  
Though the place is not upto the mark but their dishes in terms of taste are far better than what is provided in most of the restaurants. Even more they are pocket friendly. 
Brownie points for the home delivery :)

Today brought home food from this place. Ordered butter naan, chicken butter masala and mutton kasha. The food tasted good..was tasty and fresh at a reasonable price. However the naan appreared more like paratha than naan and was way smaller and thinner than what naan is supposed to be. Otherwise the food is good and overall a good take away joint with lots of variety in the offering.

I have heard that this outlet is a hot favourite amongst hostel people  so tried their food today by ordering to one of my friend's home. We ordered yellow dal, mix veg and roti. The order was delivered  to us on time but I didn't find the taste of the food great. It is like any other home delivery joints you find near your vicinity though I haven't tried the non veg so I won't say I have a complete idea if their spread if menus but the veg foods suddenly did not work for me. Though the prices are quite reasonable and pocket friendly..

1) ¬†They don"t have a POS Machine & hence, no facility for Card Payment.

2) ¬† They don't have an AC inside

Food is ordinary, nothing to boast of......

Perhaps, the only USP of this joint is that it"s pocket friendly, nothing gret to comment

The place is good. Situated near the GD bus terminus. The place is a good hangout spot for  budget eats. I have tried the Paneer Pakora and the Rumali roti Egg Chicken roll which is a must try for diet conscious people. It contains succulent just off the sheek chunks of chicken kebabs and basically a no oil preparation.

Also worth a try is the Coffee here.

Never ever take home delivery from this restaurant. I took a masala dosa from here. It is very very bad. The dosa was very very cold. It didn't seem like it was made and delivered. It was like a roti prepared in the morning and delivered though delivery distance was hardly 1 KM. It was not at all tasty. Even if it was hot, it would have been bad.

Never ever order anything. I would prefer other restaurants.
